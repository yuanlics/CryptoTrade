        "summary": "  Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has made a bold statement on Twitter, claiming that Ethereum is an \"outdated 'dumpster fire'\" and that his own layer-2 scaling solution, Hydra, is a better way of handling transactions. Hoskinson highlighted the advantages of Cardano's technology, including its ability to process more transactions per second at a lower cost, and its tiered pricing and Babel fees system. He also criticized Ethereum's consensus layer and programming model, which he claimed cannot be changed. Despite Cardano's ADA token being subject to attacks due to its status with the SEC, Hoskinson remains optimistic about its potential beyond financial investment, pointing to its use in educational credentials in Ethiopia and its potential for future growth."

        "title": "How arrival of Ethereum futures ETF may trigger 'brutal fee competition' between fund providers - DLNews",
        "summary": "  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is poised to approve Ethereum futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which could lead to increased demand for Ethereum in the US. The approval could also boost confidence in the asset class and potentially vault it into the mainstream. However, the market for Ethereum futures contracts may follow the same trajectory as their Bitcoin counterparts, with a potential fee war among asset managers. Roundhill, an asset management firm, has already disclosed a 0.19% management fee for its Ethereum futures ETF, which is lower than some other funds. The approval of Ethereum futures ETFs may also decouple from the course of Bitcoin's futures products and could lead to a big shift in assets from futures to the spot market. Investors may also want to consider the differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin, as Ethereum is more of a software play and its proposition is wrapped up in providing financial utility to users, while Bitcoin is now widely seen as a speculative asset."
