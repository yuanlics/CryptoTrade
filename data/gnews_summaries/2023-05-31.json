Five years later, the outcome of the bet is still unknown, as neither party has declared a winner. According to Artemis Chief Operating Officer Jimmy Zheng, all five dapps (WETH, OpenSea, Circle, Tether, and Ether) qualify as dapps as they are built on the Ethereum blockchain and allow for interactions with other contracts/addresses. The definition of an application is seen as a construct, with the smart contracts being the atomic unit, and other contracts/addresses interacting with them."
