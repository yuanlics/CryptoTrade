        "summary": "  Ethereum (ETH) has decoupled from Bitcoin (BTC) due to an increase in spot ETH ETF launches, leading to a lower correlation between the two assets. This decoupling is likely due to ETH's role as a platform for dApps and smart contracts, which differs from BTC's primary use as a store of value and means of payment. The lower correlation makes a case for portfolio diversification, with smart investors spreading their investments across different cryptos to reduce exposure to any one category. Institutional investors may also be impacted by this trend in their trading strategies, such as cross-hedging. However, investors should perform their own due diligence and not take these observations as investment advice."

The Ethereum price has set new yearly highs and recorded a 10% profit over the past week, while most of the altcoin sector still lags behind. A report from BlockScholes suggests that the potential approval of a spot Ethereum Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is behind the current price action, leading to a spike in Ethereum's price volatility and a reversal of its persistent downtrend. The report also notes a decline in the US dollar and a potential loose monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, which could favor a rally in risk assets such as altcoins. If Ethereum continues to gain momentum, the entire altcoin sector could see further profits, with Bitcoin and Ethereum potentially seeing a more significant rally by the end of January 2024."
