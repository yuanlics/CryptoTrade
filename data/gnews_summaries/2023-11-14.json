The reasons for this underperformance are unclear, but some factors include decreased activity on the Ethereum blockchain, regulatory concerns, and the disappointing impact of The Merge, a recent upgrade to the blockchain. Ethereum's correlation with Bitcoin has also weakened, and many other cryptos are outperforming it. Institutional investors are moving their money from Ethereum to Solana, another Layer-1 blockchain. The decision to invest in Ethereum depends on one's view of its long-term growth prospects, with some analysts still optimistic about its potential. The competition from Solana and other Layer-1 blockchains could have a significant impact on Ethereum's future growth."
