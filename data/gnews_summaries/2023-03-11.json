        "summary": "  Sure, here is a summary of the article in less than 256 tokens:\n\nEthereum layer-2 solutions may shift focus away from token incentives, with some networks exploring alternative models for user engagement. Coinbase's Base layer-2 network, for example, does not plan to associate a token with its platform, instead relying on ease of use and distribution to attract users and developers. Other networks, such as Arbitrum, have successfully operated without native tokens, demonstrating the viability of alternative models. However, some experts believe that tokens will still play a role in the future of decentralized networks, particularly in ensuring decentralized control over layer-2 networks."

        "summary": "  Cardano (ADA) and Ethereum (ETH) are two popular cryptocurrencies with similarities and differences. Ethereum is the second-most popular cryptocurrency and enjoys a wider fanbase, handling approximately 1 million daily transactions. Cardano, on the other hand, processes less than 100,000 transactions daily. Ethereum has a higher transaction fee, but Cardano's gas fees are consistently lower.

Both networks have a fair potential to grow in the future, and it's difficult to say which one is the winner. It's important to do your own research before investing in cryptocurrencies."
