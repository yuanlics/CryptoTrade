The ELR has trended lower since September, indicating a decrease in leverage employed by users, which could mean market participants are becoming less willing to assume risk. Additionally, the Ethereum Exchange Inflow has seen a spike in readings, representing a large amount of ETH entering exchanges. Despite the rising Open Interest, the 14-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the OI has trended lower since December 9th. Technically, ETH bulls face a challenge in converting the $2300-$2370 area into a support zone, and the belief in ETH has eroded over the past ten days, with the possibility of bears forcing prices below the $2132 support level."

A rising wedge pattern is developing on the daily chart of ETH/BTC, which could lead to a breakout move before the New Year.

However, veteran trader Peter Brandt disagrees and suggests that the descending wedge pattern could be a descending triangle, which could lead to a break below the lower trend line and a drop to 0.044 BTC. This divergence of opinion highlights the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market and the importance of careful analysis for investors."
