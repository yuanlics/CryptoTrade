The protocol will burn all Cosmos transaction fees during the interim period, signaling a shift towards revised token economics for the EVMOS token. The move is seen as a way to make it easier for Ethereum developers to start working in Cosmos, as current wallets and tools are not compatible with Cosmos. The Interchain Foundation, a non-profit focused on Cosmos adoption, has made onboarding Ethereum developers a large part of its 2024 roadmap."

Solana aims to be the go-to network for on-chain applications and experiences, and its streamlined approach and major partnerships have helped drive up the price of SOL.

        "summary": "  Ether (ETH) is set to surge by over 55% to $3,000, according to a well-known analyst. The analyst pointed to improved network activity and deflationary supply as key drivers of the potential price increase. Ether's supply is turning deflationary again, with the Ethereum network generating fees of around $36 million last week, leading to a higher burn rate. This could boost optimism for the long-term value proposition of Ether. However, the analyst also noted that Bitcoin has increased its market dominance over Ether in recent weeks, which could potentially limit Ether's upside. The ETH/BTC exchange rate recently rallied back to the north of its 21-day moving average, indicating a potential turnaround. If the analyst's target price is reached, ETH/BTC could potentially rise towards resistance in the 0.058 area. However, if Bitcoin continues to lead the broader market rally and Ethereum network activity falls again, a retest of the 2022 lows under 0.05 could occur."
