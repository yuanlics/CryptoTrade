        "summary": "  Kaiko, a crypto analytics firm, has stated that aggressive speculation on Ethereum (ETH) has not yet begun, despite the token's recent price increase. The firm notes that while there is some hype around ETH ETF applications, the data suggests that traders have not yet positioned themselves for a rally. Derivatives data also indicates that recent ETH moves have been driven by spot markets rather than perpetual futures, which suggests that traders are not using leverage in anticipation of an ETH ETF. Additionally, open interest in ETH futures has surged ahead of price, but there has not yet been a major build-up in open interest typical of a bull market. At the time of writing, ETH is trading for $2,473."

The token's price rose by over 12% in the last 30 days, and its daily active addresses and transactions remained relatively high. However, its TVL dropped, and its fees gained upward momentum. Despite a red daily chart, investors are exerting buying pressure on ETH, evident from its supply on exchanges dipping while its supply outside of exchanges went up. Whales are also confident in ETH, with its supply held by top addresses increasing last week. Considering the high ecosystem activity and buying pressure, a price uptick in the coming days cannot be ruled out.
