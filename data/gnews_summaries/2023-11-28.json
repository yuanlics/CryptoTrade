        "summary": "  Ethereum's \"smart account\" adoption is slow, with low retention rates and limited user activity. Despite this, industry participants remain optimistic and are working on proposals to increase usage. The ERC-4337 standard aims to provide a more flexible and secure way for users to interact with crypto wallets, but it is considered a \"semi-native+\" account, meaning users don't need a private key. A new proposal, RIP-7560, aims to move towards a \"native\" smart account, allowing users to specify their own validation logic and removing the need for a private key. However, this proposal has raised concerns about complexity and consensus layer changes."

        "summary": "  Institutional investors are increasingly investing in Ethereum-related trusts and ETFs, with a surge in fund flow observed since November 23rd. This growth is attributed to Ethereum's transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), deflationary supply, and the Shapella upgrade, which have improved security and trust in the protocol. The Total Value Locked (TVL) of Ethereum has also increased by 19.31% in the last 30 days, signaling a growing interest from both retail and institutional investors. The Long-Term Holder Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (LTH-NUPL) indicator has moved from hope to optimism, indicating that long-term holders are no longer fearful but instead believe in ETH's future potential. If the ETH price reaches $2,000 in the coming weeks, this belief could lead to significant accumulation and an extended rally."

His focus now and next: Account abstraction, scalability, and improving decentralization in proof of stake.\n3. Views on the intersection of AI and blockchain: While there are a few areas where AI and crypto intersect, such as zero-knowledge machine learning, the intersection is relatively small. AI's rapid growth makes it important to solve certain problems, like proof of personhood.\n4. Books he's read recently: He's been reading blogs and things on the internet, such as podcasts and science fiction, but hasn't read any books in the last year.\n5.

He argues that the current divide between \"Effective Altruists\" and \"Effective Accelerationists\" is misguided and proposes a new framework called \"defensive accelerationism.\"\n\nButerin's main argument is that both sides of the debate are flawed because they rely on centralized power and ignore the importance of decentralization and democratic decision-making. He believes that a society that develops in a \"defensive\" way is more just and fair, as it discourages attacking others and allows democracy to flourish.\n\nHe also emphasizes the importance of privacy, autonomy, cybersecurity, and infosecurity in the development of technology. He praises systems like prediction markets and community notes for their ability to usefully integrate feedback from any member of the public.\n\nButerin's \"D\" does not stand for \"deceleration,\" but rather \"defensive,\" as he believes technological progress"
