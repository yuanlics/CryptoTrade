        "title": "Ethereum price won't see $2K anytime soon, market data suggests - Cointelegraph",
        "summary": "  Ethereum price may not reach $2K in the near future, according to market data. The price faced strong resistance at $1,920 after a 17.5% rally, with several factors contributing to the limited upside, including worsening macroeconomic conditions, regulatory uncertainty, and weaker demand for decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum network. Derivatives markets also suggest that professional traders are not positioned for a significant price move above $1,920, with the futures premium remaining low and the delta skew indicator indicating balanced demand for options. The total value locked on the Ethereum network has also declined, and DApp usage has decreased. While the price may retest $1,750, bears have better odds of successfully defending the $1,920 resistance in the short term."
