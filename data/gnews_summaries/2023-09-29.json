The approval of ethereum futures ETFs may be seen as a step forward for crypto ETF providers, but the complexity of these products and their higher fees may make them a difficult sell to advisors and retail investors."

This growth is notable as ETH managed to break through the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a crucial technical indicator.

However, caution is advised as the asset could still experience setbacks.\n\nIn addition, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is attempting to break through a support level after a recent dip below the trendline support level. The asset is currently in a skirmish between the bulls and bears at the former support level, which could potentially alter the course.\n\nMeanwhile, the rising tide of the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) is casting a long shadow over the cryptocurrency market, as the dollar's ascendancy is seen as a refuge during turbulent times. This growth is coinciding with a tremor running through the crypto market's spine, as reduced liquidity and volatility are repelling investors."
