        "summary": "  Ethereum (ETH) has seen a sharp price recovery in the past week, up 15% versus Bitcoin (BTC) since the Shapella upgrades. The ETH/BTC pair is eyeing a run-up towards 0.075 BTC by June, based on a fractal setup. The Shapella upgrades may have boosted ETH's appeal as stakers have withdrawn 574,700 ETH worth $1.21 billion since the upgrades. However, institutional investors have shown more interest in Bitcoin than Ether in the past week. ETH's price is at risk of a possible bearish reversal move due to its overbought daily relative strength index. If ETH price retreats, its immediate downside target appears at around $1,984, while an extended sell-off could push the price down to its 50-day exponential moving average near $1,800."
