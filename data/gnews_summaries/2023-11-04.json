The total value of all other cryptocurrencies, excluding BTC and ETH, has risen by 14%, but needs another 9.3% increase to recover recent losses. The MACD indicator on the Ethereum chart suggests a possible bearish crossover, which could lead to a decline if the support level of $1,827 is broken. However, if the sideways momentum meets bullish momentum, a recovery could occur. Altcoins, excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, are faring well, with many layer-2 cryptocurrencies and DeFi tokens seeing significant rises. The market capitalization of altcoins has grown by 14.67% and needs an additional 9.38% growth to recover recent losses. Historically, crypto cycles have followed a pattern of Bitcoin leading the first surge, followed by Ethereum and then"

        "summary": "  Chris Burniske, a partner at Venture Capital firm Placeholder Capital, predicts that Bitcoin and Ethereum could see a repeat of their mid-2019 rally. Burniske believes that the top two cryptocurrencies could \"rip\" from their current levels, leading to a potential new high before a \"final wipeout\" in the first quarter of next year. He notes that the current price action of Bitcoin and Ethereum shares similarities to the period between December 2019 and January 2019 before the \"painful descent into March 2020 lows.\" Burniske warns investors that the rollercoaster \"could get extreme\" and urges them to have their seatbelts on. Macro factors such as rising inflation and interest rates could contribute to a potential decline in Bitcoin."

        "summary": "  Yuga Labs and Magic Eden are launching a new Ethereum NFT marketplace by the end of 2023, focused on paying royalties to creators. The platform will be the first major Ethereum marketplace to contractually obligate paying royalties for secondary sales. Both firms emphasize the importance of respecting creator royalties and hope to encourage innovation by boosting the number of builders and creators. The new marketplace will also aim to reset the royalty allocation standard and hope its principles will be adopted throughout the ecosystem. The partnership seems to taunt OpenSea, one of the largest NFT marketplaces that made royalties optional, highlighting Magic Eden and Yuga Labs' firm stance in favor of creator royalties."

        "summary": "  Ethereum (ETH) saw a significant increase in exchange outflows, with $210 million worth of tokens leaving centralized exchanges (CEXs) in the past week. This is the highest seven-day net outflows since August, suggesting that investors are transferring assets to private wallets. This trend has ignited speculation about the price of Ethereum (ETH) potentially recovering and reaching $2,000. On-chain analytics firm Santiment believes that ETH's rise above $1,800 was aided by network growth and exchange outflows, and if these trends continue, ETH might have the justification to cross $2,000 again. Additionally, the volume settled on Ethereum reached its highest level since the SVB crash in March, with $213 billion in assets transacted on the mainnet alone, and an additional $16 billion on Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base. This increased on-chain activity might indicate that fundamentals are improving, despite potential short-term market corrections."

        "summary": "  Ethereum price is consolidating around $1830, with a resistance level that has been tested for two weeks. The market is uncertain, with a potential for a 16% drop if the consolidation breaks down. The intraday trading volume is $5.3 billion, indicating a 27% loss. The price has been in a rising channel pattern, but a breach of the lower boundary could lead to a short-term downturn. The Fibonacci Retracement Tool shows critical support levels at $1750 and $1700. A correction to these levels could be a precursor to a renewed ascension above $1880. The daily Exponential Moving Averages (20, 50, 100, and 200) are wavering around $1780 to $1700, fortifying this area as a strong support zone. The daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) is forming lower highs within the overbought territory, signaling a possible price retracement."

        "summary": "  Solana (SOL) is gaining traction as a potential \"Ethereum killer\" due to its recent milestones and performance. Despite Ethereum's (ETH) L2s thriving with TVL, Solana has pointed to its TPS, with a much higher number than Ethereum's L2s. Solana's DEX volume has been skyrocketing, and its TVL is recovering. However, Ethereum maxi Ryan Sean Adams criticized Solana's growth, opining that it has a lower TVL than other Ethereum L2s. Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Helius, a Solana RPC, countered Adams' opinion, highlighting Solana's higher TPS and larger community. Other comments also disagreed with Mumtaz's position, considering TPS a vanity metric. Cryptonary, a data-driven trader, noted that the $37 region needs to hold strong to prevent another plunge, and Solana has the potential to grow exponentially in the long term."
