        "summary": "  Ethereum (ETH) price is surging ahead of the highly anticipated Bitcoin (BTC) ETF approval, with a 10% weekly gain. Crypto derivatives traders are betting bigger on ETH, with a higher funding rate and open interest growth compared to BTC. The ETH funding rate marginally exceeds BTC's, indicating increased demand for long positions in the ETH derivatives market. Additionally, ETH open interest has outpaced BTC's, suggesting more new entrants are bringing fresh capital into the ETH market. While there is a potential resistance sell-wall around $2,475, the IOMAP data shows that 567,150 addresses have acquired 398,810 ETH at an average price of $2,475, which could lead to a rapid booking of profits if ETH price approaches that level. However, if derivative traders continue to double their bullish positions, ETH could break above $2,500 for the first time since May 2022."
