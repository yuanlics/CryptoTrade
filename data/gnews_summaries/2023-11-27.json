        "summary": "  Rollups, such as Optimism and Arbitrum, have saved Ethereum users a significant amount of gas fees, according to a recent report by Chainstack. Without these layer-2 networks, transaction fees would be five times more expensive, with an average wait time of nearly twice as long. Rollups help solve the blockchain trilemma by offloading some of the pressure from layer-1 networks, allowing for faster and cheaper transactions. While Ethereum gas fees have seen an uptrend, rollups have still served as a necessary and useful counterbalance."
