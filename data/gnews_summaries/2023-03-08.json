However, wrapping the CBDC comes with risks, such as the possibility of institutional reputational damage or central bank involvement in illegal activities. The project team believes that tokenizing the CBDC will allow consumers to participate in crypto ecosystems using trusted and reliable forms of money and increase the utility of the CBDC."

The recent surge in demand for blockspace has resulted in increased fees for validators, with median transaction gas prices reaching 35 Gwei and exceeding 38 Gwei on February 16, the highest since June 2022, according to Glassnode data. However, analysts suggest that the short-term win for validators may not have a lasting impact, as the success of the Ethereum network depends on various factors beyond gas fees."

According to Arcane Research, the 30-day correlation between BTC and ETH reached an all-time high (ATH) value of 0.97. This indicates that the two assets have been moving in tandem, with ETH following BTC's price movements closely. The correlation between ETH and BTC has been above 0.5 for most of the year, suggesting a decent tie between the two. However, the correlation between ETH and US equities, such as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, has been lower, around 0.5. Arcane Research expects this correlation to soften in the next year due to declining trading volumes in the crypto market. As of writing, ETH's price is around $1,200, down 2% in the last week."

Miners sell almost all the coins they mine, applying constant selling pressure on Bitcoin. However, in a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system like Ethereum, stakers don't incur such expenses and don't need to sell their rewards, providing a different type of selling pressure. This could be a good thesis for being bullish on the ETHBTC ratio. Ethereum is trading around $1,200, down 1% in the last week."

The SEC's definition of a real benefit is broad, and any form of an airdrop could fit their definition. Crypto users can hide unwanted tokens in their wallet interfaces, but it is unclear how the SEC will enforce a ban on airdrops."

Chainlink has been integrated into the Base testnet, and the platform has seen large transactions in recent weeks. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has stated that Base will likely monitor transactions, but did not provide clarity on what this means.
