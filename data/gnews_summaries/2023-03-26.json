        "title": "What Are Stealth Addresses? - Decrypt",
        "summary": "  Stealth addresses provide enhanced privacy protections for Ethereum transactions by concealing the recipient's identity. They work by generating a secret spending key, which is used to create a stealth meta-address that is shared with the sender. The sender then publishes cryptographic data on-chain to help the recipient find the assets, while the recipient uses their spending key to claim the assets. While the technology is still in its early stages, it offers a method of privacy similar to generating a new address for each transaction without the hassle of manually creating them. However, there are still challenges to be addressed, such as gas fees and the need for significant changes to Ethereum-based wallets."
