As of February 2023, 226 validators have been slashed out of 524,060, with most slashings occurring due to attestation violations. The developer highlighted four emerging best practices to reduce the odds of being slashed, including wiping existing chain data on old staking machines, using doppelganger detection, watching buffers and logs on the Beacon Chain, and unplugging everything if something feels wrong. The majority of slashing events have come from attestation violations, and since the Beacon Chain merged with the Ethereum proof-of-work chain in September 2022, only 35 of the total 226 slashings have taken place."
