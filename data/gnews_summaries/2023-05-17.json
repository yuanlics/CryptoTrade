        "summary": "  High gas fees on the Ethereum network are causing frustration for users, but they are also contributing to the network's deflationary model. The Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, implemented in 2021, introduced a mechanism for burning base fees, which has led to a reduction in supply and an increase in value. Institutional investors are taking notice, with many viewing Ethereum as a more attractive investment due to its deflationary nature. The network's fee burns are seen as a form of buyback, similar to traditional finance stock buybacks, which can drive price action for holders of ETH. Other layer-1 protocols, such as Solana, do not generate fees in the same way or burn them to reduce supply, making Ethereum stand out as a more attractive investment."
