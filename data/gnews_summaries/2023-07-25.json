On-chain and technical analysis shows that the ETH network value-to-transaction value (NVT) metric has been overvalued since the beginning of 2023, and the profit levels of short-term and long-term holders may limit the downward movement. However, the on-chain metrics also suggest that the price could suffer some selling pressure from short-term holders and panic selling from investors spooked by relatively lower levels of activity in 2023. The ETH/USD pair shows bearish risk in the short term with an impending death cross on the weekly scale, and the derivatives data indicates that there has been no significant change in the open interest volume for futures contracts. The options data, on the other hand, reveals a bullish bias with a notable concentration of call options between $1,900 and $2,400. The article concludes that Ether's negative selling pressure could persist for a couple of weeks, but there is potential for a strong influx of buyers at"
