        "summary": "  Here is a summary of the article in less than 256 tokens:\n\nEther's price has been stuck below $1,900 since July 21, despite recent positive developments such as PayPal's entry into the cryptocurrency space and increased demand for Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The lack of volatility has led to uncertainty and skepticism among investors, and there are concerns about centralization and control over personal assets with PayPal's entry. The Ethereum network is also facing problems due to high gas fees, which are limiting the demand for decentralized applications (DApps). The total value locked on the Ethereum network has decreased, and the number of active addresses using DApps is down. Derivatives metrics show balanced demand between bulls and bears, with professional traders unable to adopt a bullish stance. The unveiling of Coinbase's Base network could contribute to Ether's challenge of surpassing the $1,900 mark, but the network is facing competition from existing smart contract platforms and challengers with ample resources."
