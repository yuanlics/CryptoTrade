        "summary": "  Sure, here's a summary of the article in less than 256 tokens:\n\nEthereum developers are working on improving data availability on the network, which refers to the concept that data stored on a network is accessible and retrievable by all participants. Current solutions, such as optimistic rollups, can be efficient but also centralize data storage, leading to a single sequencer. Data availability sampling is a solution that involves sampling random parts of a block to gain confidence that it's there, without having to download the full block. This technology uses polynomials to model relationships between variables in a block and can provide arbitrarily high confidence. Projects like Celestia and Avail are building out data availability sampling solutions, with the goal of scaling data availability at the base layer and having execution and roll-up on the second layer."
