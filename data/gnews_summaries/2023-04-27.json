        "summary": "  Ethereum's next upgrade, Cancun, will focus on two key features: proto-danksharding (EIP-4844) and deactivating the SELFDESTRUCT opcode. Proto-danksharding aims to reduce transaction costs by introducing a new transaction type for temporary data storage. The second feature, deactivating SELFDESTRUCT, will pave the way for stateless Ethereum by shifting responsibility for storing the blockchain's full state to more specialized nodes. Other features considered for inclusion in Cancun include transient storage (EIP-1153) and EVM Object Format (EOF), but these are considered less urgent and may be prioritized in a future upgrade."

Despite a brief drop below a multi-year support line, Shiba Inu has seen a buying spree on Coinbase, with 98% of retail investors on the platform purchasing the token. Meanwhile, the largest whales have taken advantage of the price drop to stock up on SHIB holdings.

The lack of motivation from the community stems from the fact that there is no automated way of burning the tokens. Despite this, Shiba Inu is evolving into a self-sufficient ecosystem via Shibarium, a Layer-2 scaling solution."
