While Bitcoin is the pioneer of cryptocurrencies and offers faster transaction speeds and greater liquidity, Ethereum has more utility and enables the development of decentralized applications and smart contracts. Both have their advantages and disadvantages, and it's hard to say which one is a better investment in 2023.

This growth is expected to be driven by the convergence of traditional asset classes and cryptocurrencies, with blockchains like Ethereum playing a dominant role in issuing tokenized RWAs. Currently, around 60% of tokenized RWAs are issued on Ethereum, and if this trend continues, it could significantly boost the demand for Ether (ETH), potentially even rivaling gold's market cap. However, Ether has been performing poorly recently, with weak on-chain activity and falling yields on staked ETH contributing to its decline."
