        "title": "Ethereum Node and Client: A Complete Guide - crypto.news",
        "summary": "  Ethereum nodes and clients are crucial components of the Ethereum network, responsible for validating transactions, executing smart contracts, and ensuring the network's security and decentralization. Nodes are computers that run the software required to interact with the network, while clients are programs that enable nodes to read blocks on the blockchain and interact with smart contracts. There are different types of clients, including full, light, and remote clients, each with varying levels of functionality and data storage requirements. Understanding the difference between nodes and clients is essential for using the Ethereum network effectively."

        "summary": "  Ethereum's proto-danksharding, a proposed upgrade, could drastically reduce the cost of rollups by 10 times, according to Nicolas Liochon, head of zkEVM Linea at Consensys. Rollups are currently limited by the fact that transactions are posted in call data in Ethereum blocks, which is expensive and represents 95% of the cost. Linea's prover only represents a fifth of the cost. The upgrade, EIP-4844, will introduce data blocks that can be sent and attached to blocks, reducing the cost of transactions. Linea aims to be a general-purpose ZK-rollup for various decentralized applications and solutions within the Ethereum ecosystem."

        "summary": "  Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, addressed the platform's ongoing issues, including privacy, consensus, smart contract security, and scalability, in a recent keynote speech. While progress has been made in these areas since 2017, challenges remain, such as legal and acceptance issues surrounding privacy tokens. Buterin introduced the concept of proof-of-innocence to validate tokens without revealing transaction origins. Ethereum has embraced a consensus mechanism but faces centralization concerns and simplifying the protocol. Smart contract security has improved, but hacking incidents remain. Ethereum's focus is on practical solutions, mainstream adoption, and enhancing user benefits."

        "summary": "  Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, revealed that the network is still facing several issues that were present six years ago, including privacy, consensus, smart contract security, and scalability. Despite the progress made, these challenges persist, and smart contract security has made slower progress than other issues. However, the developer community is actively working on innovating and delivering new solutions. Additionally, Buterin stakes only a small portion of his ETH holdings due to security concerns, and a high-profile developer compared Ethereum's staking to sausage manufacturing, implying less appealing aspects of the network's staking mechanism. Ethereum's inability to solve these issues is a concern for the network and its community of developers, as it is the second-largest blockchain project in the industry."

        "summary": "  Ark Investment and 21Shares have filed for regulatory approval to launch an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the price of Ethereum (ETH). This is the first attempt to introduce such a fund in the US. The ETF would hold actual ETH as its underlying asset, closely following the spot price of ETH. This could simplify gaining exposure to ETH for a wider range of investors and potentially stimulate greater demand for the cryptocurrency. The filings have triggered a countdown for a final decision by the SEC. This differs from futures-based Ethereum ETFs, which use derivative contracts rather than actual ETH as their underlying asset. The introduction of an Ethereum ETF could enhance liquidity in the Ethereum market and draw in more traders and investors, potentially leading to elevated trading volumes. As of writing, the news had a minimal impact on ETH's price trend, but this could change once ETF approval emerges."

The move is driven by Bitcoin's enhanced security and decentralization mechanisms, according to Metagood CEO Danny Yang. The transition involves tracing the legacy of each OnChainMonkey NFT back to its Ethereum counterpart, and holders will receive a corresponding Bitcoin Ordinal. While Ethereum still dominates the NFT market, Yang is optimistic about Bitcoin's prospects, envisioning a vibrant Bitcoin-centric NFT ecosystem. The move is facilitated by the inception of Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, which followed the successful Taproot soft fork."

If BTC slips below this level, the odds of a bearish breakdown increase.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is testing a support level at $1,621, which is shaky ground considering momentum is fading. If ETH drops below this level, it could reach $1,529.\n\nRipple (XRP) price has broken out from a descending parallel channel, which could indicate that the downtrend has finished. XRP could reach $0.5547 and $0.5580 resistance levels, or potentially extend to the psychological $0.7000 level. However, there is still a risk of XRP slipping back below the upper boundary of the descending channel and extending to the July 13 lows at $0.4600."

The mechanism uses privacy pools, which are smart contract-based privacy projects that allow users to generate new addresses without revealing their transaction history. Users can publish zero-knowledge proofs demonstrating their compliance with regulations, while maintaining their privacy. The authors believe that privacy and regulation can coexist, and they plan to meet with regulators to discuss the potential of privacy pools in bolstering national security and combating money laundering."
