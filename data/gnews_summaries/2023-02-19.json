Optimistic rollups assume that each transaction is valid until proven otherwise, while zk-rollups use zero-knowledge proofs to verify transactions without revealing sensitive information.\n\nThe advantages of zk-rollups include faster and cheaper transactions, increased security through trustless proof systems, and the ability to withdraw funds without experiencing delays.\n\nHowever, there are also disadvantages to zk-rollups, such as the complexity of building and deploying these systems, the need for specialized hardware, and the reliance on established trusted setups.\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a"

Ethereum uses Proof-of-Work (PoW), while Cardano uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS). PoW requires high computational power to validate transactions, while PoS requires high initial investment. Ethereum has a limited supply of 45 billion tokens, while Cardano has a limited supply of 45 billion tokens. Ethereum's transaction speeds are slower than Cardano's, and its transaction fees are higher. Both platforms have different nodes, with Ethereum having three types of nodes and Cardano having three types of nodes as well. Ethereum was founded in 2015, while Cardano was founded in 2017. Ethereum aims to decentralize products and services beyond just money, while Cardano aims to solve the issues that Ethereum users face."
