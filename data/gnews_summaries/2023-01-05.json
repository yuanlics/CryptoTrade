They explore The Merge, ether, and gas in relation to Ethereum. The Merge refers to the upcoming upgrade that will merge the current Ethereum network with the proof-of-stake (PoS) network. Ether is the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, while gas is the unit of measurement for the computational power required to execute a transaction on the network. The experts highlight the unique features of Ethereum, such as its ability to execute smart contracts and decentralized applications, which set it apart from Bitcoin."

The investor participated in an Ethereum initial coin offering (ICO) and received 150,000 ETH at the ETH ICO price of around $0.31. The value of the 22,340 ETH at the time would have been around $6,925, and the 20,544.14 WSTETH traded for $27 million. WSTETH is the wrapped version of Lido Staked Ether (STETH), which allows for easier integrations with DeFi protocols.

        "summary": "  Sure, here is a summary of the article in less than 256 tokens:\n\nMining activity is surging on proof-of-work blockchains, including Dogecoin, Litecoin, and Syscoin, following Ethereum's switch to proof-of-stake. The increase in mining activity is due to miners switching to these networks, which can be mined efficiently with high-end GPUs. However, it is unlikely that miners are using repurposed GPUs from Ethereum, as the hash rate for these networks has not increased significantly. Instead, miners are buying or selling GPUs and ASICs to mine these networks. The increased mining activity has led to higher hash rates, which can provide more security for these networks. However, the profitability of mining these networks depends on various factors, including energy and equipment expenses, as well as the price of the cryptocurrency."

Despite this, Bitcoin retained its crown in terms of online search interest. The Ethereum network averaged around 1.1 million daily transactions, while Bitcoin's network stood at 255,000. Ether's supply has decreased since October 8, 2022, due to the network's deflationary move. The analyst believes that Ethereum's heftier transaction volumes will continue into the new year, with the potential for a \"flippening\" to occur. However, the distance between Ethereum and Bitcoin's transaction volumes may be more significant than currently shown, as layer 2 transactions are not included in the charts."

This is a concern for long-term investors, as the Shanghai upgrade could enable unstaking once deployed. The price of ETH has been relatively flat in the daily timeframe, but the RSI metric indicates a positive trend. If the upward momentum continues, ETH could retake the $2,000 area and turn most of the staked ETH into profit. However, holders have been holding at a loss for the past 365 days, with a loss of 27.57%."
