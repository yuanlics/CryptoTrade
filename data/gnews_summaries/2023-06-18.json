        "summary": "  Ethscriptions, a new protocol on Ethereum, allows users to create and share digital objects on the blockchain. Developed by Tom Lehman, the project saw explosive interest with nearly 30,000 creations in less than 18 hours. Ethscriptions enable non-financial data, including images, to be written into the main Ethereum blockchain using calldata, which is cheaper and more decentralized than using contract storage. The protocol guarantees global uniqueness of the content and has sparked interest from the NFT community, including a call from Adam McBride, an NFT archaeologist, to \"ethscribed\" famed NFT collection Crypto Punks. While the launch has seen significant interest, some have pointed out that the technology has been around for years and this is the first time it has gained widespread awareness."
