        "title": "Ethereum in 2 Charts: Is It Time to Sell? - The Motley Fool",
        "summary": "  Ethereum (ETH) has seen significant growth in 2023, up over 50%, despite being down over 60% from its all-time high. The recent London hard fork has made Ethereum a deflationary asset, as the total supply of ether is decreasing due to a fixed base fee that is permanently removed from circulation. This means that the price of Ethereum could increase as the supply of ether decreases, especially if there is a bull market on the horizon. Additionally, the number of active addresses on the Ethereum blockchain has been growing, indicating increased demand for the cryptocurrency. Overall, it seems that Ethereum is in a good position and could see significant growth in the future due to its deflationary features and increasing user base."

        "summary": "  The Ethereum Foundation sold $30 million in Ether (ETH) on the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange, causing a brief drop in price. However, the price has since recovered and is holding key support levels. The 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) has capped ETH's downside attempts so far in 2023, and the currency is maintaining its overall recovery trend. The Ethereum Foundation's sales have not had a significant impact on ETH's price trend in the past, and the current market is influenced by broader economic factors such as the U.S. banking crisis and interest rate hikes."

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin And Ethereum Foundation Selling ETH \u2013 Will Prices Fall? - NewsBTC",
        "summary": "  Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation have sold a significant amount of ETH, raising concerns among investors. 200 ETH worth $400,000 was transferred to a cryptocurrency exchange by Vitalik.eth, and 15,000 ETH worth $30 million was transferred by the Ethereum Foundation. This dumping of ETH could pressure prices, especially since the coin is currently down 13% from its April highs. However, there are also positive signs, such as increased adoption from major companies and institutions, which could drive up demand for the cryptocurrency. The burn of ETH due to the meme coin mania could also sustain prices above key support levels. It remains to be seen how prices will react in the days ahead, but the sharp drop on May 6 could anchor the next leg down, forcing more liquidations towards the $1,500 support line."
