The company has received nearly 42,000 payments from MEV bots to date, with the majority of the funds going to validators. The MEV tactics used by Celsius include uber-quick arbitrage, front-running, and so-called \"sandwich attacks,\" which have been controversial due to their permissionless nature and potential exploitation of unaware Ethereum users. The article concludes that it would take Celsius over a decade to pay off its previous legal fee projection through MEV, and potentially hundreds of years to pay off its massive FTC fine."
