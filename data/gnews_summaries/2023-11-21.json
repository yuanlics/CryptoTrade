This accumulation has led to a 4.46% increase in ETH's price over the past 24 hours.

This increase is attributed to a renewed market appetite for assets inscribed with the Ordinals Protocol, which has resulted in over six million Ordinals inscriptions and over 800 BTC in fees being redistributed to the network since late October. The listing of ORDI on Binance and the announcement of a $7.5 million seed round for an Ordinals-based project have also contributed to the uptick in activity."

        "summary": "  Ethereum's supply on exchanges has dropped to 5-year lows, indicating that fewer people are selling their ETH and more are holding or staking it. This could lead to a price increase as the scarcity of ETH increases. The recent surge in ETH price can be attributed to filings of Spot Ethereum ETFs in the US, which has ignited a price spike. Investor sentiment has changed, with investors pulling their assets off exchanges into cold storage after BlackRock's ETH filing. Data from CryptoQuant and IntoTheBlock shows that exchanges have had around 228,450 ETH more in outflows than inflows since November 15. The ETH price is currently trading at $2,013, and many analysts expect it to continue increasing if supply tightens."
