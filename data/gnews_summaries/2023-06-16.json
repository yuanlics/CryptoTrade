The recent Nansen report shows that Arbitrum's daily active users, gas fees, and transaction count have been consistently higher than before the airdrop. The gap between Arbitrum and Optimism in terms of daily active users has also widened. An upcoming Ethereum network upgrade, Dencun, is expected to reduce transaction fees on Arbitrum, which could increase its value proposition. The Arbitrum Foundation has also announced that it will pass on sequencer earnings to the Arbitrum DAO, which could create yields for ARB holders. \"Smart money\" is still holding ARB, and funding rates for ARB perpetual swap contracts have turned negative. The ARB/USD pair has been trending downward since its launch, but could potentially break out to the upside if it breaks above a descending wedge pattern. Technically, ARB shows the possibility"
