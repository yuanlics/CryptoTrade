        "summary": "  Ethereum (ETH) could reach $3,500 if it sustains a weekly close above $2,150, according to crypto technical analyst Ali Martinez. The momentum could be stemmed if traders decide to lock in gains, with all holders standing to gain 7.73% if they sell their holdings at the prevailing price. The upswing is attributed to strong expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2024 and the enthusiasm around spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, the $1,900-$2,100 range is seen as a key area for purchasing, with 5.85 million addresses buying 43.8 million ETH in this range."
