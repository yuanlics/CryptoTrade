The median gas price over a 7-day moving average reached 43.641 gwei, the highest since June 30, 2022. This comes after a period of stabilization around the 20 gwei mark following the Merge in September 2022. The demand for blocks and the network's capacity to meet that demand, rather than the consensus mechanism used, are the primary drivers of high gas fees. Recently, Ethereum network activity has skyrocketed with meme coins like PEPE, which has become the sixth largest by market cap. Despite the mania surrounding meme coins, some warn of the high risk involved."

Meanwhile, Ethereum has generated 28 times the revenue of Bitcoin through its daily fee structure, with layer-2 Ethereum platforms exceeding the BTC network in terms of daily revenue.
