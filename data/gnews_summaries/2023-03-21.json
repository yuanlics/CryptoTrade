        "summary": "  Sure, here's a summary of the article in less than 256 tokens:\n\nEthereum has been in deflationary mode for two months straight, with a surge in on-chain activity on protocols like Uniswap and Blur driving the trend. The upgrade to EIP-1559 in August 2021 led to transaction fees being burned instead of going to miners, contributing to the deflationary nature of the network. Uniswap and Blur have been the main drivers of increased on-chain activity, with a total of 18,291 ETH ($35 million) burned in the past 30 days. The recent depegging of USDC and the collapse of financial institutions have prompted crypto industry participants to advocate for decentralized financial infrastructure, which could benefit Ethereum."

He cataloged 636,000 ETH ($1.15 billion) that is lost, representing 0.5% of the coin's circulating supply. The majority is due to a 2017 bug in the Parity crypto wallet, and the remaining losses are due to typos, user errors, and failed contracts. The estimate may understate the actual amount lost, as many wallets' access has been lost but cannot be determined from blockchain data alone."

        "summary": "  Arbitrum is a scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain that uses optimistic rollups to speed up transactions. It relays transaction information back to the main Ethereum blockchain, increasing its transaction capacity to 40,000 TPS compared to Ethereum's 14 TPS. Arbitrum also supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), making it easy for Ethereum DeFi developers to integrate their decentralized applications (dapps) with Arbitrum without modifications. The platform is transitioning to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and plans to airdrop its new ARB token to allow holders to vote in decisions related to the protocol. Arbitrum does not have a token, as all transactions on the sidechain are settled with ETH, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. The project has been integrated into several decentralized finance protocols and has over $2 billion worth of cryptocurrency locked up in its smart contracts. Users can access Arbitrum through a decentralized application or directly on the token bridge, and will need to pay an Ethereum gas fee for deposits."

According to Pal, the ETH/BTC chart is forming a wedge and a breakout could lead to a surge that puts Bitcoin in second place. He notes that ETH/BTC needs to overcome resistance at 0.077 BTC ($2,115) to verify the breakout. This prediction is similar to one made in 2021, which argued that Ethereum's programmable blockchain and ability to trade other digital assets give it an edge over Bitcoin. However, it's important to note that these are just predictions and Bitcoin remains the top dog among cryptocurrencies."

The hacker sent a message to Euler's Ethereum address, offering to return 10% of the stolen funds in exchange for 10% of the total. When the hacker did not follow through, Euler offered a $1 million reward for information leading to the hacker's arrest and the return of the stolen funds. The hacker then transferred some of the stolen funds to a mixing service, and it is unclear if the hacker is acting alone or if there are multiple people involved. The language used in the hacker's message suggests that there may be more than one person involved.
