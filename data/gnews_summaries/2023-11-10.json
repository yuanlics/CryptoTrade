The Shapella upgrade also went live, allowing speakers to withdraw their staked Ethereum 2.0. Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that supports the development and execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), and it has grown to become one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the world. According to historical data, Ethereum was trading lower than its current market price on Black Friday 2022, and cryptocurrency experts at Changelly have predicted that ETH will reach a minimum of $1,887 and a maximum of $2,089 on Black Friday 2023. Historical prices can provide context for understanding current valuation and future performance potential, and they can also be used to compute useful metrics like trading volume and volatility.

        "summary": "  BlackRock's registration of an Ethereum Trust in Delaware and a spot Ethereum ETF with Nasdaq has led to a \"nuclear winter\" for Ethereum doubters, according to Matrixport's Head of Crypto Research and Strategy Markus Thielen. The price of ether surged over 10% after the filing, with a \"massive short squeeze\" occurring overnight and funding rates reaching the highest ever. Cryptocurrency trading volume exceeded $100 billion in the last 24 hours, with ether rallying to a high of $2,134 and bitcoin dropping around 4% before recovering. The filing has also led to an increase in ether's trading volume and a rise in perpetual futures funding rates for both bitcoin and ethereum, indicating growing optimism among traders. However, caution is still warranted as the market is at crucial resistance levels and bitcoin is printing a triple bear divergence with the RSI. The approval of a spot bitcoin ETF is expected to be delayed until January"

        "summary": "  Sure, here's a summary of the article in less than 256 tokens:\n\nEthereum (ETH) bulls are targeting a price surge of 50% to $3,000, with analyst Jacob Canfield predicting a rally within the next few weeks if resistance at $2,100 is broken. ETH has gained 33% in the past month, fueled by Ethereum ETF prospects and improving crypto market sentiment. On-chain analysis shows little major resistance until $2,500, and most ETH holders are now in profit. However, some minor pullbacks due to profit-taking are likely. The rally has boosted related sectors like DeFi, with total value locked across Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solutions hitting an all-time high above $13.6 billion."

This represents a significant jump from the $847 million in annual inflows reported earlier this week.

It has achieved 100% uptime this year and seen a significant increase in total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi) to $415 million. Some believe that Solana could be the next Ethereum, but it still has a long way to go to catch up with Ethereum's impressive $24.4 billion in TVL. Solana ranks 5th in terms of developer activity, but it lags behind Ethereum, Polkadot, and Cosmos. Notable companies such as Visa and Shopify have incorporated Solana, signaling growing acceptance of its capabilities. However, Solana needs more users to catch up with Ethereum in terms of actual users. While Solana shines in daily transactions, it still has to fill some big gaps in different areas to be considered the next Ethereum."
