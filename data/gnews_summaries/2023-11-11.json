        "summary": "  Ethereum daily revenue has reached a 4-month high of $10 million, according to data from Token Terminal. This surge in revenue is attributed to the platform's average daily income doubling from $5 million in the first five days of November. Improving scalability through layer-2 and sidechain solutions is expected to further boost network revenue, although it is unclear how this will impact revenue in the short term. Ethereum 2.0 aims to increase general throughput by splitting the network into smaller interconnected networks called shards, allowing the mainnet to scale."

        "title": "Bitcoin price will continue dwarfing Ethereum, analyst says - crypto.news",
        "summary": "  Bitcoin (BTC) is expected to continue outperforming Ethereum (ETH), according to Into The Cryptoverse CEO Benjamin Cowen. He suggests that BTC will maintain its dominance in the market, with ETH potentially lagging behind. The ETH/BTC pair is facing resistance after falling below a trendline, and Cowen warns that it will encounter multiple resistance levels to the upside. The recent surge in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices may be driven by expectations of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval and BlackRock's plans to file for an ETH-based ETF. However, altcoins like XRP, DOGE, UNI, and XLM have experienced declines, possibly due to a pause in capital rotation towards smaller tokens. Fed chair Jerome Powell's recent policy address suggests that the Fed might persist with its tightening cycle, which could impact the overall crypto market."
