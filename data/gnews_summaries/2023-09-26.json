        "summary": "  Ethereum operators are complying with US sanctions, leading to censorship concerns among decentralization proponents. 5 of the 6 largest block builders on Ethereum's blockchain censor certain transactions, mostly from decentralized mixer Tornado Cash, which is blacklisted by the Treasury Department. Censorship has been a topic of concern as blockchain technology advances and crypto adoption spreads, as centralized entities have power over decentralized operations. Decentralization is essential, as a concentration of power by a few network participants can harm the whole ecosystem. Two solutions proposed by researchers include an inclusion list to aid censoring entities in handling OFAC-sanctioned transactions and encrypted mempools to make on-chain transactions impossible to censor based on origin or content. Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has advocated for privacy and decentralization, criticizing the US approach to crypto regulations and their impact on networks like Solana."
