        "summary": "  Sure! Here's a summary of the article in 256 tokens or less:\n\nThe Ethereum network has become deflationary for the first time since the Merge upgrade last year. The circulating supply of ETH is now 2.4% lower than it was a year ago, thanks to EIP-1559, which began burning ETH with every transaction. The Merge further reduced the rate of new ETH issuance, making the network deflationary. This means that the overall supply of ETH is decreasing, rather than increasing."

Despite being the go-to network for decentralized applications and solutions, Ethereum needs to scale and become more decentralized. Buterin believes that centralized entities like Binance need to take a back seat for crypto adoption to move forward. The network has transitioned from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake following the Merge, making it harder to shut down. Ethereum is focused on privacy and scaling with the help of zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups, which can reduce the computing workload on the network and promote privacy."

Small investors are also selling their holdings, with the number of addresses holding at least 0.1 ETH reaching a 5-month low. The founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, has also made significant transactions carrying ETH toward centralized exchanges, which has sparked speculation that he is selling and could influence investors to do the same."
