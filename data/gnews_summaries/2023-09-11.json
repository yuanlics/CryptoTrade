        "summary": "  Ethereum is losing favor among institutional investors, with $4.8 million in outflows this past week and $108 million in sales this year, making it the most sold digital asset by large entities. This is according to CoinShares' latest analysis, which also found that sentiment regarding institutions purchasing crypto remains poor. The main reason behind the rampant selling is the strength of the US dollar, which has driven eight straight weeks of green candles. However, the analyst believes that as the year ends, it will become increasingly clear that the soft landing scenario is not the case, especially if high-interest rates kick in. Bitcoin was the most damaged crypto asset last week, with large entities offloading a whopping $69 million worth of the asset despite being in the green the week prior."

The EIP 1559 mechanism has caused a decrease in the ETH burn rate, leading to an aggressive increase in the delta between issued and burned coins. The Ethereum supply has fallen by over 300,000 ETH in the past year due to the activation of EIP 1559. The ongoing anomaly is attributed to low activity of Ethereum accounts, with gas metrics near 2023 lows. MEV bot has become the most productive spender of Ethereum gas, paying over $70 million in gas fees since February. During periods of pale market performance, MEV bots might be responsible for 80-90% of top DEXes' trading volumes."

Privacy pools use zero-knowledge proofs to prove that funds are coming from a legitimate source without revealing the actual source of the funds. The technology is already being developed, but partnerships with organizations or companies that can provide additional information about the source of funds are needed to make it fully effective. The proposal is aimed at addressing the limitations of existing privacy technologies, such as Tornado Cash, which have been used for money laundering and other illicit activities. However, the regulatory compliance of privacy pools across various jurisdictions is still a concern, and it is up to policy makers to decide whether the technology meets their regulatory requirements."
