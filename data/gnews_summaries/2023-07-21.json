        "summary": "  Ethereum (ETH) is showing an ascending price channel, which could lead to a bullish move in the near future. However, ETH recently broke down from the $2,000 level, which could apply downward pressure. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 50, indicating that the prevailing uptrend could still have some steam. Additionally, Ethereum's volatility is lower than usual, which could lead to a significant price movement.\n\nOn the other hand, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is experiencing a rapid reduction in volatility, which could lead to an increase in selling pressure and a potential decrease in momentum. Pepe (PEPE) is showing signs of a potential upward price trajectory, with a 50 EMA support level and a support line on the token's local trend. However, any predictions are contingent on various factors, including market sentiment and overall performance of meme-based cryptocurrencies."

Users can seamlessly use their credentials on the Ethereum network after the collaboration was announced on Thursday. Polygon ID was previously only available on the chain it was issued on. More chains will be added in the coming weeks, including BNB Chain and Avalanche. The solution uses zero-knowledge proofs for privacy and security during identity verification processes, which is a crucial component in the decentralized identity movement. The global market for decentralized identity is expected to grow to $6.8 billion by 2027. Polygon is just one player in the industry exploring decentralized identity solutions, along with other companies like Disco, SpruceID, Iden3, Ceramic, and the Ethereum Foundation."

An RPC node is a computer with blockchain client software installed that can connect to the blockchain network and provide dApps with access to the network's data.\n\nThere are two main types of RPC endpoints: public and private. Public RPC endpoints are shared resources that can be accessed by anyone, while private RPC endpoints are used by a single dApp and are not accessible to other apps. Alternative RPC endpoints can help mitigate the risk of single point of failure by providing backup endpoints.\n\nTo use RPC nodes, developers can use private RPC endpoints provided by RPC node providers, run their own self-hosted nodes, or send traffic through public RPC endpoints. Each method has its pros and cons, and developers should consider these factors when deciding how to use RPC nodes in their dApps.\n\nThe JSON-RPC protocol is used by RPC nodes to define specific methods for requesting services from the node, and core methods such as gossip, history, and state methods are"

The current gas fees are high, and the progress made by Ethereum developers to reduce them has been slow. Buterin's plan involves changing how Ethereum wallets operate, integrating programmable smart contract wallets, and using \"paymasters\" to allow users to pay transaction fees using any token. This proposal aims to reduce gas fees by nearly 100%. The plan is straightforward and won't be disruptive, as it won't require changes to Ethereum's underlying protocol. The proposal features signature aggregators, which will provide more data compression and reduce costs. If successful, this plan will greatly benefit Ethereum users by reducing their gas fees."
