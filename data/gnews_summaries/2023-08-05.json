        "summary": "  Arbitrum, an Ethereum-based layer 2 (L2) scaler, has maintained its position as the largest L2 network by total value locked (TVL) due to its commitment to neutrality. The network has not endorsed any applications, allowing third-party teams to create their own protocols on the chain, fostering competition. This approach has contributed to Arbitrum's success, according to cryptocurrency researcher Patrick McCorry. Despite a recent surge in Optimism's (OP) metrics, Arbitrum remains the leader in the L2s segment, with a TVL of $5.93 billion and 56.16% of the total Ethereum L2s ecosystem."
