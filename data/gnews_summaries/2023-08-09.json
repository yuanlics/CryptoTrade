        "summary": "  Ethereum staking yield may decline due to increasing staked Ether, but it's difficult to predict the exact outcome. The yield is calculated based on the total annual yield paid out to stakers, which is divided by the average ETH staked over the year. As more users stake their Ether, the APY earned decreases. The network's staked tokens as a percent of the total supply are lower than other proof-of-stake coins, which could impact the yield. However, demand on the network and factors such as regulation, infrastructure development, and macro landscape could also affect the staking yield. Currently, the total annual yield paid out to stakers is around 4%, but it could potentially decline to 1%-2% if the amount of staked Ether continues to increase."
