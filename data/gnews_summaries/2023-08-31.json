This move allows users to seamlessly send and receive these cryptocurrencies, diversifying the company's crypto offerings beyond the Ethereum ecosystem. Robinhood has also introduced a swap feature that enables users to trade Ether for over 200 other cryptocurrencies, without holding Ether, and network fees are automatically deducted from the tokens held. The company aims to make crypto more accessible and user-friendly with its wallet, and all users will gain access to the swap feature in the coming weeks."
