        "title": "1 Reason Ethereum Could Lead the Next Bull Market - The Motley Fool",
        "summary": "  Ethereum's new deflationary mechanism, implemented through the London hard fork, could lead to increased demand and lower prices, making it a potential store of value. The mechanism burns fees, which vary depending on network demand, and could lead to a decrease in the total supply of Ether, potentially lowering its price. This is similar to the phenomenon that made Bitcoin valuable, and could position Ethereum as a store of value in the future. Investors may benefit from buying Ethereum while its price is low and enjoying the deflationary feature for the long term."

        "summary": "  Ethereum (ETH) has reached a new high in its burning rate, with over 3,000 ETH burned per day, according to data from oklink. This is the highest point ever seen since November 2022. The increase in burning rate is attributed to the popularity of decentralized exchanges Uniswap and OpenSea, which have recorded significant trading volumes over the past months.\n\nThe Ethereum price chart indicates two possible scenarios: a retracement to the $1,300-$1,350 region or another bullish trend. The recent tap into external liquidity could signal a possible retracement, but if ETH invalidates this movement, it could lead to another upward rally.\n\nIn addition to the burning rate, Ethereum has also reached new highs in total staked ETH on the Beacon chain, with over 16.16 million ETH staked, representing 13.28% of the total Ether supply. Staking services providers such as Lido, Coinbase, and Kraken control a significant portion of the staked ETH.\n\n"
