        "summary": "  Sure, here is a summary of the article in 256 tokens or less:\n\nEther (ETH) price may be poised to hold above $1,800 despite recent SEC lawsuits against exchanges Binance and Coinbase, as three key metrics suggest resilience in the Ethereum network.

These indicators suggest that professional traders are not overly bearish on Ether's price despite the retest of the $1,800 level."
