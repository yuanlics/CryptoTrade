        "summary": "  Ethereum researchers are scaling the network by collecting random data from 100,000 addresses to improve data storage and validation. The \"proto-danksharding\" plan involves introducing a new data storage mechanism and using polynomial commitment scheme KZG commitments to reduce verification requirements. To create a trusted setup, researchers are relying on a \"trusted setup\" mechanism that requires a set of random values as inputs. Anyone with an Ethereum address can participate in the trusted setup by contributing to a randomness pool, with a minimum of 16 transactions required for contribution. The lowered barrier to participation has led to a significant increase in contributions, with over 100,000 unique addresses contributing to the pool."

This standard permanently burns the ERC-721 NFTs on Ethereum and allows users to claim the recreated version of the digital asset on Bitcoin as an inscription. The launch of BRC-721E comes as NFT sales on Bitcoin have fallen 18.50% in the past 24 hours, while Ethereum NFT sales have surged 16.7%. However, the overall Ethereum NFT market has seen a decline in performance, with the Forkast ETH NFT Composite index down 0.26% over the past day and 6.21% on the month."

        "summary": "  Ethereum NFT holders can migrate to Bitcoin via a new bridge, but it's a one-way trip. The BRC-721E token standard enables the migration by burning the original Ethereum NFT and minting a new version on Bitcoin via the Ordinals protocol. However, the original NFT is essentially destroyed in the process, and it cannot be reclaimed. The move may appeal to Bitcoin enthusiasts or those who believe the rise of Ordinals will increase the value of their NFTs, but there are risks involved, such as losing the benefits and perks associated with NFT ownership."

        "summary": "  Arbitrum (ARB) is a Layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain that enables fast smart contract transactions while reducing transaction costs. It uses optimistic rollups to batch transactions, execute them off-chain, and settle them on-chain. Arbitrum's scaling solution differs from other Layer 2s, such as sidechains, as it relies on the main chain for security. The team behind Arbitrum is a New-York based Ethereum startup that secured $120 million in a Series B funding round in September 2021. Arbitrum has an ecosystem of dApps and complex smart contracts, and its token, $ARB, is used for governance and transferring value on the network. To use Arbitrum securely, users need to connect their wallets to a third-party wallet like Metamask and follow the steps to add the network. Buying $ARB can be volatile, and users should do their research and use extra security measures like hardware wallets."

The standard allows for the transformation of Ethereum's ERC-721 NFTs into Ordinals, which can be inscribed on a single satoshi. Users can burn their NFTs on Ethereum and then inscribe valid BRC-721E data onto Bitcoin. The creators of the standard offer solutions to preserve the provenance of the NFTs, such as embedding lower-quality images and key information on the blockchain. The execution of BRC-721E follows the launch of the Ordinal Inscriptions protocol on Jan. 21, which has been well-received and led to a record number of transactions on the Bitcoin network.

Both projects offer unique features and have the potential to increase profit potential while providing a secure platform for trading cryptocurrencies. The price of Ether is essential for establishing the value of Ethereum as a platform and its currency, ETH. Meme coins like Shiba Inu have no real value or use case, but the community is strong and could make a comeback. HedgeUp's NFT marketplace is innovative and could create its own ecosystem. ETH prices tend to impact most DeFi projects, but the HDUP presale is still amassing startup capital. Experts advise traders to only invest what they can afford to lose and to carefully weigh the risks before investing in ETH. The future looks bright for Ethereum and HedgeUp."
