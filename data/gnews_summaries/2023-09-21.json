        "summary": "  Ethereum (ETH) is undervalued, according to The Motley Fool, due to the growing activity on Layer 2 blockchain networks. Despite the lack of price appreciation for ETH, Layer 2 networks are helping to scale Ethereum and contribute to its market dominance in key areas such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi). The article cites a valuation model based on Metcalfe's Law, which suggests that Ethereum could be undervalued by as much as 27%. However, the author acknowledges that the application of this model to cryptocurrencies is controversial and that the price target of $20,000 projected by some models during the last crypto bull market was wildly off the mark."
