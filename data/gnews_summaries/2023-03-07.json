In contrast, the Ethereum network shares more similarities with the complex US economy, with a deflationary supply of ETH and a decentralized financial system. He also compares XRP and Solana to their respective national economies, with XRP resembling the UK and Solana similar to South Korea after the Asian crisis. Pal concludes that the total market capitalization of crypto assets is flashing a \"perfect setup\" between two long-term support levels."
