Buterin noted that both protocols have made different choices in terms of functionality, which have resulted in unique value propositions. He believes that both protocols are valuable and should continue to coexist, as they provide different benefits to users. However, Buterin also acknowledged that both protocols have limitations, particularly in terms of scalability, and emphasized the need for blockchain to evolve beyond its current limitations."

The SEC investigation is ongoing and non-public, according to elected legal counsel Douglas Park. As a result, BarnBridge has stopped creating new liquidity pools and ceased all work on its products. The move has affected about $1.2 million in existing pools and individuals are no longer being compensated for work related to the project until further notice. The development comes amid a string of actions taken against crypto firms, including within the DeFi sector."

        "title": "Ether price charts reflect weakness, but inflow to LSDFi could prevent an ETH sell-off - Cointelegraph",
        "summary": "  Ether (ETH) price has been trending downward, with a resistance level at $2,000. However, there is growing demand for liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) like Lido\u2019s stETH, which could limit the downside. LSD activity is on the rise, with more ETH being moved toward staking than selling on exchanges. The total ETH deposited in staking contracts is 19.7% compared to the centralized exchange balance of around 12.8%. LSD platforms captured most of the inflow, followed by independent validators and staking-as-a-service clients. Despite the downward trend, the LSD sector appears to be the current hotspot for DeFi players looking to maximize their yield. Technically, the ETH price can take two paths from here: find support at the base of the ascending triangle around $1,790 before making a break for the $1,900 resistance level again, or a continued drop toward the long-term resistance and support level of $1,700."

The bridge aims to provide a more efficient and cost-effective solution for layer-3 scaling by using data availability sampling (DAS) instead of data availability committees (DACs). Avail's solution is designed to be more inclusive and efficient, reducing costs and paving the way for a more diverse and secure layer-2 and layer-3 ecosystem. The company has opted to become an independent entity outside of the Polygon product suite to service all kinds of rollups, and it is built using Polkadot's Substrate technology. Avail's new staking token, AVAIL, will facilitate a permissionless validator set of up to 1,000 validators, and the company is exploring the possibility of helping Polkadot build zk rollups on a Polkadot parachain using Avail."

This allows users to store their BRC-20 tokens across blockchains without needing a bridge, and mint new ERC-721 NFTs on Ethereum. The innovation of Emblem's solution is to create specialized vaults that hold the private keys and store the BRC-20 tokens, allowing users to mint new NFTs on Ethereum using a single ERC-721 token. The partnership is seen as a test of what type of asset BRC-20s are most closely related to, and how the community will view and trade them. The creator of BRC-20s and ORDI, Domo, did not reply to a request for comment, but the Emblem team is excited to showcase their creation to the Ethereum marketplace."
