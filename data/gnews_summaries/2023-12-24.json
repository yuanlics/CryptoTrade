        "summary": "  Ethereum HODLers have surpassed Bitcoin in terms of the amount of coins held long-term, with 70% of ETH held by HODLers since December 1st. This suggests that there is conviction in ETH's long-term potential despite price fluctuations. The increase in HODLers implies that investors are willing to hold onto their coins for an extended period, which could lead to a rally in the near term. The Dormancy metric, which measures the ratio of coin days destroyed and total transfer volume, has shown high values, indicating an increase in transactions by older coins. The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the 4-hour chart has also shown a bullish crossover, which could indicate a potential rally in the mid to long term. However, traders may need to be cautious and wait for confirmation of the bullish thesis before making potential gains."
