Bitcoin's bullish factors, such as the possible approval of spot ETFs and upcoming halving, are already priced in.

Traders are closely watching the potential for a reversal at the trendline support level on the ETH/USD chart, but caution is advised due to the current market conditions and network challenges. Ethereum's price chart shows a sharp decline in price after encountering resistance, leaving investors questioning the durability of the bull run. The support for the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem built on Ethereum's blockchain is unstable due to high transaction fees, which has dampened enthusiasm for DeFi projects and compromised Ethereum's potential for a swift recovery. However, Layer-2 networks on Ethereum might change this in favor of the second-biggest blockchain in the industry."
