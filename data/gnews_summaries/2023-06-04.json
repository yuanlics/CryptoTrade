        "summary": "  A large entity has sold off over $55 million worth of The Graph (GRT), an Ethereum (ETH)-based indexing protocol, causing a significant price drop. According to crypto analytics firm Santiment, the whale likely disposed of its GRT stack at $0.130. The current price of The Graph is $0.128. Ethereum itself is also struggling to maintain its price structure as ETH holders are taking profits after a mild price jump. Bitcoin (BTC) could potentially play \"catch up\" with equities and other altcoins in the coming days, especially with the recent news of the US government raising the debt ceiling."

        "summary": "  Here is a summary of the article in 256 tokens or less:\n\nEthereum holders with more than 10,000 ETH have declined to a two-year low, according to recent data. The number of these holders has been decreasing since April, with a steeper drop in May. Meanwhile, Ethereum's supply on exchanges has also declined, which could be due to holders moving their coins to staking wallets. The Netflow metric on Glassnode shows a significant level of movement, with a predominant pattern of negative flow, indicating more outflow than inflow. The total value staked in Ethereum has reached new highs, with over 24 million ETH staked, and the total number of deposits has also increased. The Ethereum price trend has been upward, with a recent breakthrough above its short Moving Average and a 2.4% price increase observed on June 2. However, the price has since lost some ground and is trading closer to the $2,000 region."
