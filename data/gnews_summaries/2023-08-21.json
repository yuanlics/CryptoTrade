        "summary": "  Ethereum price is attempting a recovery above $1,620, but faces resistance at the 100 hourly SMA. The price is trading below $1,700 and the 100-hourly SMA, and could resume its decline if it stays below this level. The 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move is near $1,700, and a close above this level could start a decent increase. However, if Ethereum fails to clear $1,700, it could continue to move down with initial support at $1,640 and major support at $1,600. Technical indicators, such as the MACD and RSI, are losing momentum in the bearish zone."
