        "summary": "  Ethscriptions are a new protocol on the Ethereum blockchain that enables the creation and sharing of digital entities, such as images, in a decentralized and affordable manner. The protocol uses Ethereum's \"calldata\" to inscribe non-financial data directly onto the Ethereum main chain, providing a more affordable and decentralized alternative to contract storage. Ethscriptions are unique and guaranteed to be globally unique, and they can only be images for now but will expand to other types of data in the future. The protocol has gained significant interest and excitement in the Web3 community, with some comparing it to the success of Ordinals, and Lehman plans to continue innovating on the protocol. Ethscriptions represent a promising frontier in the crypto landscape, offering accessible, affordable, and secure data transactions on Ethereum."

During the observed period, both assets formed lower highs on the daily chart and tested a descending trendline, indicating a cohesive downtrend. However, Ethereum has yet to bridge the gap on the upside. The decreasing reliance on Bitcoin correlation is positive for Ethereum, allowing it to sustain a strong rally when the market turns positive for Bitcoin. Factors such as staking, recent withdrawals, and the expansion of DeFi ecosystem are contributing to the increasing liquidity and users of ETH."
