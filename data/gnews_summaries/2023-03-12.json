        "summary": "  Ethereum (ETH) price has been volatile due to various factors, including the failure of Silvergate Bank, a liquidity crisis at another cryptocurrency-friendly bank, and concerns about the US Securities and Exchange Commission's potential crackdown on Ether. Despite a brief drop below $1,400, ETH has managed to maintain above that level, but a sustained break below the 200-Day Moving Average could be a negative sign for the medium-term bullish thesis. Key resistance levels are located around $1,460, while support levels are at $1,350 and $1,240. The upcoming US CPI inflation data release will be closely watched, with bulls hoping for a downside surprise that could reduce the likelihood of a 50 basis point rate hike from the Fed later this month."
