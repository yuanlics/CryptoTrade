Smart accounts are an extension of the existing account abstraction technology, which allows users to access their crypto funds without the need for a seed phrase or complex technical knowledge.\n\nThe benefits of smart accounts include the ability to use a smartphone as a hardware wallet, the ability to set permissions for higher value transactions, and the ability to recover accounts in case of loss or theft. Additionally, smart accounts enable the use of decentralized applications and games, and allow for the creation of new use cases such as recurring payments.\n\nThe article highlights the work of various teams and projects, including Ethereum, StarkWare, and MetaMask, in developing and implementing smart accounts. It also provides a detailed explanation of how ERC-4337 works, including the role of bundlers in decentralizing the payment of transaction fees.\n\nOverall, the article presents smart accounts as a significant improvement in the cryptocurrency space, offering a more user-friendly and accessible way for users"
