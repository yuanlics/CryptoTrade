The upgrade, which includes the Dencun upgrade, is expected to occur in January 2024 if all goes smoothly. The Ethereum Foundation is also planning to launch a new testnet, Hole\u0161ky, which will replace Goerli and is intended to be retired in 2024.

The circulating supply is over 120 million coins, with new coins entering the ecosystem through mining. Ethereum is transitioning from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, which may lead to slower supply growth. The recent EIP-1559 upgrade burns transaction fees, reducing the overall supply of ETH. The future supply of Ethereum is uncertain, but its demand for decentralized applications and innovation will continue to drive its value."

        "summary": "  Ethereum is introducing a new feature called \"blobs\" to improve scalability. Blobs are inexpensive and temporary memory that carry data about transactions, making it more efficient to verify transactions. This will reduce the amount of work necessary to keep data on the Ethereum network, allowing for faster processing and cheaper costs. The upgrade, called EIP-4844, will create two separate fee markets for Layer 1 execution and blobs, reducing the impact of congestion on the Ethereum network. While the upgrade was previously expected later this year, core developers have suggested that it may be delayed until 2024. Layer 2 networks will also need to implement upgrades to support blobs. The introduction of blobs brings Ethereum closer to full sharding, which promises to scale the network exponentially while reducing costs on Layer 2s."

        "summary": "  Ethereum (ETH) price is attempting to break above $1,620 resistance in October 2023, but faces a crucial bearish trend line with resistance near $1,620 on the daily chart. A daily close above $1,665 could start a fresh increase, but a failure to clear these resistance levels could lead to a decline below $1,530 and potentially as low as $1,440."

        "title": "Understanding EIP-4844: Ethereum's Upgrade Focusing On Blobs - Blockzeit",
        "summary": "  Ethereum is set to launch a new upgrade, EIP-4844, also known as Proto-Danksharding, which aims to significantly reduce gas fees by introducing a new transaction type called blobs. Blobs are large amounts of data that are cheaper than current cell data and can be used to carry data efficiently. This upgrade will enhance the Ethereum network's scalability, security, and usability, making it more adaptable and user-friendly. The upgrade will also include the implementation of execution-layer logic, verification rules, and a two-dimensional fee market, necessary for full Danksharding. The expected launch date of the Ethereum Cancun upgrade is September 27, 2023, on the Ethereum Devnet-9 testnet. The upgrade will bring several benefits, including boosted scalability, reduced gas fees, and top-notch security. Overall, the EIP-4844 upgrade is a significant step forward in Ethereum's journey towards addressing its long-standing issue of high gas fees."
