        "title": "Can Ethereum (ETH) price rebound next week? - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "summary": "  Ethereum (ETH) price has declined 5% in the past week, extending a 2% loss in the past 30 days. Despite this, ETH is still up 29.6% YTD. Recent overselling may position ETH for a rebound in the coming weeks, but the token is currently oversold and has a weak RSI. The 30-day EMA continues to slide below the 200-day average, indicating substantial selling pressure. However, ETH is undervalued relative to its fundamentals, making it a favorable time to invest. Ethereum maintains a significant share of the Total Value Locked in the industry and is continuing to evolve and expand with upcoming launches like Holesky testnet."

        "summary": "  Sure, here is a summary of the article in less than 256 tokens:\n\nEthereum's price has been declining against Bitcoin since August, making Bitcoin the better investment. However, historical trends suggest that Ethereum could be on the brink of entering an accumulation phase, which could be a good time to buy. The last cycle shows that an accumulation phase occurred 17 months after the descending channel against Bitcoin, and based on the four-year theory, this could happen again soon. While the current cycle is different from the previous one, the potential for an accumulation phase remains. Investors should consult a financial advisor before making any investment decisions."
