        "summary": "  The Ethereum 2.0 journey has entered a new phase with the Beacon Chain launch in December 2020, marking the beginning of the transition from the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm to the proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithm. The Merge, which occurred on September 15, 2022, further advanced the Ethereum 2.0 journey by integrating the Beacon Chain with the normal Ethereum blockchain, creating a parallel blockchain that runs on PoS.\n\nThe upcoming Shanghai upgrade, scheduled for April 12, 2023, is a significant improvement to the Ethereum network, bringing enhanced scalability, improved security, and better support for smart contracts and decentralized applications. The upgrade will allow validators to withdraw their staked Ether from the Beacon Chain to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the environment where smart contracts are executed.\n\nAdditionally, the upgrade will introduce several new technologies and protocols, including proto-danksharding, a new virtual machine called eWASM, and further upgrades"

        "summary": "  The Ethereum Foundation will deploy the Shapella upgrade on April 12, enabling withdrawals from Ethereum 2.0 staking contracts. The upgrade will impact ETH sell pressure, with some analysts predicting significant selling in the first few days after deployment. However, as more users move to stake ETH due to reduced risk and increased yields, market conditions may favor more upside in the long term. The Nansen report estimates that 59% of illiquid deposits are in profit, and total selling pressure could range from 1.2 million to 3 million ETH. The upgrade will implement a two-tier partial and full withdrawal system, with a minimum staking requirement of 32 ETH. The selling pressure is expected to peak in the first three days, with around $527 million in daily selling pressure. The ETH/USD pair faces resistance at $1,970, and a breakout above this level could see the pair reach bullish targets around $2,330 and $2,750. However, support lies around $1,569 in case of a downturn"

        "summary": "  Zero-knowledge rollups, a breakthrough in crypto technology, can significantly lower transaction costs on the Ethereum blockchain. These rollups offload the computation and execution of smart contracts to a separate layer-2 blockchain, allowing for more efficient use of Ethereum blockspace. The costs of writing data to mainnet from a zk rollup actually decrease as the number of users increases, unlike Ethereum mainnet where more users and transactions lead to increased gas fees. Current zk rollups do not charge fees in a native token but instead use ether, and the specifics of the rollup implementation determine what gets posted back to Ethereum mainnet. There is a competition between systems that emulate the EVM as close as possible and those that optimize proving for a particular VM, and technological and hardware improvements will reduce data availability costs further."
