        "summary": "  Ethereum (ETH) is currently experiencing a \"fire sale\" according to the rainbow chart, a logarithmic price chart that predicts price growth over time. The chart indicates that ETH could be undervalued at its current price levels, but investors should be aware of Ethereum's unique monetary policy changes and other technical indicators before making investment decisions. The shift from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS) has altered Ethereum's inflation rate and introduced a deflationary mechanism through the burning of transaction fees, making the rainbow chart calculations different from those used for Bitcoin (BTC)."

The discounts are due to a disparity between the exchange's prices and global spot prices. However, Binance.US has suspended USD deposits, leaving only users with existing USD on the platform to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity. The situation has raised concerns and sparked a debate on social media, with some users terming it a \"depeg\" of cryptocurrencies. The CTO of Tether, the issuer of the world's largest stablecoin, has addressed the issue, explaining that the lack of market makers willing to arbitrage could be behind the disparity."

The CPI report on July 12 could trigger a rally if it comes in positive. BTC could break the $30,500 mark and record a new range high.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is gaining momentum against the USDT, with momentum indicators pointing to rising momentum. ETH could breach the $2,000 level if it continues to gain traction.\n\nRipple (XRP) price is moving within a steady range, with investors reluctant to make moves due to the long-overdue judgment in the network's case against the US SEC. XRP could extend further toward the $542 level if buyer momentum increases, but the $0.506 range could also be the ideal exit points for investors booking profits."

        "summary": "  Ethscriptions are a new type of NFT on the Ethereum blockchain that use transaction calldata to store digital artifacts. They differ from traditional Ethereum NFTs in that they are stored on-chain, which can save on costs and offer greater decentralization. Ethscriptions are created by converting an image into a base64-encoded data URI and then adding it to a 0 ETH transaction. The creator plans to expand beyond images and include other file formats in the future. Ethscriptions compare to Bitcoin Ordinals in some ways, but they have limitations such as file size and type, and storage vulnerability to pruning. The introduction of Ethscriptions may shift the conversation around NFT innovation back to the Ethereum network and offer Ethereum a chance to maintain its leading position in the NFT market."

The hackers were able to net around $455,000 by exploiting a bug in the smart contract that managed the reserves of two wrapped tokens, darcWETH and darcUSDC. The bug allowed the attackers to drain funds from the reserves without proper checks, and the hackers were able to move the stolen funds through Tornado Cash to make them difficult to trace.\n\nThe Arcadia Finance protocol is a non-custodial DeFi solution that allows users to collateralize their wallets and access up to 10 times more capital than their initial collateral value. However, the hack highlights the risks involved in using wrapped tokens, as the custody of the collateral is not done by the users themselves but by the managers of the wrapped tokens.\n\nThe impact of the hack on the crypto markets has been minimal, with Optimism's native token OP and other similar tokens not suffering significant losses. However, the incident serves as a reminder of"
