        "summary": "  Ethereum (ETH) could witness a price dip as whales take profit, according to a crypto analyst. The analyst, Ali Martinez, noted that whales have been actively taking profits after ETH hit $2,300, which could trigger a massive sell pressure on the world\u2019s second-largest crypto. The analyst predicts that if significant holders continue to sell, the price of ETH could retest the $1,555 support level and potentially drop as low as $1,460 within the next two months. However, the overall market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, leaving room for potential further growth in the cryptocurrency\u2019s price."
