        "summary": "  A large Ethereum holder sold 694 ETH worth $1.13 million for 1,010 Maker (MKR) tokens, despite Vitalik Buterin's recent sale of his MKR stash. The whale's portfolio is heavily invested in ETH, with 10,000 ETH worth $16.3 million, representing over 75% of the total portfolio. MKR has been surging in value, up 125% since June, due to the release of MakerDAO's \"Endgame\" roadmap, which includes plans to launch a new blockchain and introduce two more tokens. Despite Vitalik's sale, the whale is doubling down on MKR, highlighting the token's potential for growth."

This divergence could indicate a potential U-turn towards resistance levels. Meanwhile, XRP is showing signs of life despite recent losses, with its price level trading at approximately $0.50.

Despite this, the asset's burn rate has skyrocketed by 500%, indicating growing network activity. The future of SHIB remains uncertain, with the invalidated pattern either being a stumbling block or a stepping stone for the asset."

        "summary": "  Ethereum (ETH) has seen a decline in transaction volume and activity on its blockchain, leading some to worry about a long-term decline in areas such as NFTs. However, it's possible that users are simply choosing to execute transactions on faster, cheaper Layer 2 blockchains, rather than on the core Ethereum blockchain. Additionally, there has been a wave of selling by so-called Ethereum \"whales\" and even by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Some are concerned that this could be a red flag, but it's also possible that Buterin is simply redistributing his funds among different crypto wallets to protect them from hackers. The author believes that the market is overreacting to the downside and that Ethereum still makes a lot of sense as a long-term investment play. Buying the dip now could be a way to add to one's Ethereum position at a lower price."
