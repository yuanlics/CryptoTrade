While the fund is less than a month old, it could benefit from good timing as increasing number of cryptomarket participants are forecasting significant gains for ether. Some analysts believe that if ether can reach $2,100, a near-term rally could be in the offing, and the fund's valuation could be supported by the fee paid to Ethereum investors for using applications built on the Ethereum blockchain."

        "summary": "  In an interview with Blockworks, Jon Charbonneau, co-founder and partner at DBA, a crypto investment firm, discusses the concept of rollups in the context of scaling Ethereum. Charbonneau defines a rollup as a state derived from data posted on another blockchain, which can be used to run a state transition function. He emphasizes that a rollup doesn't necessarily need to bridge back to the original data layer, as long as it uses the base network for security properties. Charbonneau admits that the question of whether rollups actually scale Ethereum is complex and difficult to answer, as it depends on how one defines scaling. He suggests that rollups can create more efficient execution environments that do more throughput for comparable resources, but notes that the answer lies within a \"fuzzy line.\" Ultimately, scaling with rollups on Ethereum means using the properties of the underlying system in some way and retaining security properties, while also allowing for more interesting things to be done with ether."

However, Cheong expects the ETH/BTC trading pair to remain in a correction for at least six months before Ethereum starts to make gains against Bitcoin.

Lastly, he suggests that Solana (SOL) is poised for a correction after a big rally and other altcoins may start breaking out next."
