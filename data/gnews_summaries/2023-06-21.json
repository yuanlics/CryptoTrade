        "summary": "  Ethereum (ETH) has surged 5.93% in the past 24 hours, reaching $1,821, driven by a combination of factors. The main reason is the growth of Bitcoin (BTC), which recently recaptured the $28,000 level after news of major Wall Street companies launching a crypto exchange. This has led to a wave of price pumps across the crypto market, with Ethereum and other cryptos following suit. Additionally, the entrance of Wall Street players into the crypto space, such as Fidelity and Charles Schwab, may be fueling the sudden spike in prices. However, the SEC's recent charges against Binance and Coinbase have raised concerns about regulatory scrutiny in the crypto industry."

The solution uses Nitro Enclaves to provide an isolated compute environment to protect and securely process highly sensitive data like personally identifiable information (PII) or private keys. Web3Signer runs in the Nitro Enclave and signs attestations and block proposals using the plaintext validator private keys that are loaded into the enclave. The validator private keys are encrypted using a KMS key, and DynamoDB is used to store the encrypted keys. The solution also provides high availability by deploying Web3Signer instances in an Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. Additionally, the solution covers the area in the architecture diagram marked in red, which depicts the components deployed inside the EC2 instances and the general communication flow with external AWS services like DynamoDB and AWS KMS."

However, its slow transaction speed and high costs have been a concern. Ethereum is working on updates to improve these issues, such as switching to proof-of-stake and using layer 2 solutions like rollups. These upgrades could make Ethereum faster and cheaper, potentially quadrupling its market value to reach $1 trillion.

He proposes a novel architecture called \"asset/keystore separation\" to address two issues: users needing to switch between multiple accounts without many transactions, and handling counterfactual addresses (addresses not yet registered on-chain). Buterin suggests a light or heavy version of this system, with different proof schemes to optimize costs. In the long term, aggregating proofs through bundling operations can reduce costs, and Layer 2 solutions should minimize the latency of reading the Layer 1 state.
