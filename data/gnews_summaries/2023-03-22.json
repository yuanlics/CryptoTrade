        "summary": "  Roofstock, a fintech and single-family home sales company, has sold a Georgia home to RealT through a tokenized Ethereum-based NFT. This is the first collaboration between the two companies. The transaction took place in under 3 minutes and raised $214,882. The process involves creating a separate Wyoming LLC for each single-family asset available for sale, which acts as a shell for a corresponding wallet holding the buyer's NFT on Ethereum. The NFT is non-transferable and gets marked with a KYC flag, allowing prospective owners to purchase the NFT on OpenSea or other marketplaces. The sale is being seen as a pioneering effort in the use of blockchain technology in real estate transactions, as US regulators continue to keep a close eye on the industry."

        "summary": "  Ethereum has transitioned from an inflationary to a non-inflationary or deflationary token, making it more attractive to investors. Deflationary cryptocurrencies are considered more valuable as their limited supply drives up prices. Ethereum's deflationary nature is due to its burn rate, which is more than the amount of Ether entering circulation. This has made Ethereum a more desirable asset, with a rich ecosystem and strong fundamentals that drive transactions and applications on the chain. However, being deflationary alone may not be enough to classify Ethereum as a better investment, as other factors such as the developer ecosystem and network effect also play a crucial role in its success."

Account abstraction or smart wallets provide more flexibility and security for crypto wallets, allowing for features like recurring payments and lost key recovery. Argent and Safe are at the forefront of this movement, and Visa has turned to layer-2 solutions like StarkNet for experimentation. Smart wallets could also revolutionize on-chain gaming by allowing for programmable transactions. While custodial wallets still dominate the space, account abstraction is gaining attention as a viable alternative."

This move is part of a broader effort to improve the user experience and make it easier for new users to interact with the network. However, the decision to remove EOAs has sparked controversy within the community, with some arguing that it could lead to compatibility issues and security concerns.\n\nEOAs are a type of account that is managed by a user's private key, rather than by smart contracts. They are the most tried and tested type of blockchain account, and are currently used by popular software wallets and hardware wallets. Removing EOAs would require large-scale code updates and could lead to increased friction for users, as well as potential security concerns.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has not yet provided a timeline for the removal of EOAs, and the issue is still being debated within the community. Some have argued that the removal of EOAs could lead to a fragmented ecosystem and incompatible dApps, while others believe that it is necessary to improve the user"

However, the figure is a rough estimate and does not account for Ethereum units locked through lost private keys or other factors. The lost Ether reduces selling pressure on existing tokens, potentially adding value in the long run. The study also found that about 11.5k Ethers worth approximately $20 million have been sent to a burn address for unknown reasons, and over 11k Ethers have been lost due to NFT minting gone wrong.
