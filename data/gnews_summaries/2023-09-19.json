Since September 2022, blockspace has consistently turned a profit, but in December 2022, it narrowly turned a loss. However, in September 2023, blockspace has accumulated $15.9 million in losses. The decline in profitability is attributed to declining user activity and falling volumes across multiple on-chain subsectors. Despite this, layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum and Optimism maintain healthy activity."

The report uses a modified Metcalfe's law model to arrive at this conclusion, which takes into account the scaling dynamics of Ethereum's network. Despite the current market capitalization of $199 billion, the report suggests that the market has yet to \"price in\" Ethereum's network adoption levels, particularly in the layer 2 space. Ethereum's thriving layer 2 ecosystem, with over 30 networks in play, has seen a surge in total value locked to $10 billion, with projects like Arbitrum and Optimism leading the way in novel scaling solutions."
