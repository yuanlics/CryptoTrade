ETH rose 6% in the last 24 hours, outperforming Bitcoin's 1% gain. The upgrade enables validators to withdraw their staked ETH, leading to increased liquidity. Liquid staking tokens like StakeWise (SWISE) and Frax Share (FXS) rallied 3-6%, while other protocols saw smaller gains. The total value of assets locked on top liquid staking protocols rose 4% in the last 24 hours, with over 8 million ETH tokens worth $16.03 billion staked through these platforms."

While ETH had previously dominated BTC in terms of returns, the tables have turned in recent months. BTC has gained ground, thanks to a falling ETH-to-BTC ratio, and is now within striking distance of topping ETH over the past five years. The analysis suggests that the narrative has shifted somewhat since the 2021 bull run, with BTC gaining strength due to its reliability and hedging against liquidity injections. However, the macro situation has changed since the 2018 bull market, and the Federal Reserve may need to pivot away from its tightening policy soon to prevent a credit crunch."

This update has triggered concerns about the potential impact on ETH's price if a large portion of the deposited funds are sold. The Shanghai update has also integrated several other EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals) to enhance the performance of the Ethereum network. The update launched on April 12, 2023, and has been named Shapella, combining Shanghai and Capella. The update has the potential to improve Ethereum's investment prospects and increase the number of users participating in securing the network by staking their coins. The algorithm predicts the price of ETH to increase to $2,500 in May and then drop to $1,050 in the next 3 months before a massive rally. The Shanghai update is seen as a significant step forward for Ethereum, reducing the power expenditure of the network and enabling validators to withdraw their ETH."

He noted that the recent Shanghai upgrade for Ethereum has been a positive development for the protocol, but there has not been a huge demand for people to withdraw their staked Ether. Instead, there are more people waiting to deposit their money into the contract.\n\nMelker believes that investors are becoming more bullish on Ethereum due to its use cases, but he stresses that both assets are separate and should be viewed as such. He encourages investors to love both or to choose based on their individual preferences, rather than feeling compelled to pick one over the other."
