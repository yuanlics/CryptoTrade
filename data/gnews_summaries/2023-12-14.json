Cronos' zkEVM is expected to progress to mainnet in Q2 2024. Other hyperchains are in development using the ZK Stack, including GRVT and Tradable, which aim to offer institutional-focused and ecosystem-specific chains. Matter Labs sees the zkSync hyperchain as a better option than app-specific chains in Cosmos, as it provides native token bridges to Ethereum and eliminates the need for validator sets and security. The ZK Stack competes with other well-funded networks building zkEVM chains, including Polygon and StarkWare.

        "summary": "  JP Morgan has released its financial outlook for 2024, predicting that Ethereum (ETH) will outperform Bitcoin (BTC) due to Ethereum's upcoming EIP-4844 update, which will enhance network efficiency and scalability. The bank believes that Bitcoin's much-anticipated halving event has already been factored into its current price, while Ethereum's centralized staking mechanism has raised concerns about network security and decentralization. Despite this, JP Morgan favors Ethereum over Bitcoin in the upcoming year."

        "summary": "  Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, has proposed a new solution for Ethereum scalability called \"enshrined zkEVM.\" This would involve implementing a zero-knowledge EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) directly on Ethereum layer 2 networks, which use both optimistic and zero-knowledge rollups. The proposed zkEVM would need to have certain key properties, including compatibility with Ethereum's multi-client system, upgradability, and support for all EVM-based infrastructures. Vitalik believes that the zkEVM should be able to generate proofs within a few seconds to efficiently address scalability issues. The implementation of zkEVM on Ethereum would not replace the need for layer 2 networks, but rather complement them by providing additional functionality and improving the overall user and developer experience."

Technical analysis suggests a rapid rise in altcoin market capitalization. However, some selling pressure could depress Ethereum prices in Q1 2024. The crypto market has seen significant growth since mid-October, with large-cap assets like Ethereum performing well. The altcoin market cap has broken previous highs, with a potential resistance level at $839B. The duration and magnitude of the next cycle could be longer than previous ones, with a possible target of $5T. Ethereum's long-term price appreciation seems inevitable, but holders may face profit-taking in the short term."

Users can convert their staked assets into fungible tokens that can be traded, lent, or used in DeFi platforms. Lido is the leading liquid staking solution on Ethereum, allowing users to stake $ETH and receive stETH tokens in exchange. The minimum entry threshold for Ethereum's Proof of Stake (PoS) is 32 $ETH, but Lido enables users to participate with smaller fractions of Ether and still receive block rewards. stETH tokens are ERC-20 compatible and are minted and burned as soon as users deposit and withdraw their $ETH tokens. To stake Ether on Lido Finance, users must connect an Ethereum wallet and follow the platform's instructions."

This upgrade will likely benefit layer 2 networks such as Optimism and Arbitrum by improving throughput and reducing fees. While Bitcoin has driving factors such as spot ETFs and the 2024 halving event, these are already priced into the price, making a huge upsurge less likely."
