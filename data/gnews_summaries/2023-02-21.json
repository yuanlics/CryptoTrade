        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Supply In Deflation, As Circulation Has Decreased Every Day So Far In 2023 - The Dales Report",
        "summary": "  Ethereum's (ETH) supply has entered deflation as the circulation of the cryptocurrency has decreased every day in 2023, with a total reduction of 52 days. The Ethereum blockchain's proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus has led to a reduction in supply, and the implementation of EIP-1559 has burned a total of 2,928,514 ETH since its implementation in August 2021. The reduced supply is intended to prop up the value of ETH, opposite to the inflationary monetary policy of fiat currency systems. This differs from Bitcoin (BTC), which has a rising supply of mined BTC, although at some point in the future, mined supply will reach zero."

        "summary": "  Ethereum price rally hit crucial resistance as institutional investors are in 'wait and see' mode. Despite a 42.8% increase in Ether (ETH) since the start of 2023, the rally has paused at a crucial bull-bear pivot point. On-chain and technical analysis suggests that Ether bulls failed to overcome resistance at 0.082 Bitcoin (BTC) and are now consolidating below the $2,000 price level. Institutional investors are hesitant to invest in Ether due to regulatory clarity and scalability challenges, and the exuberant gas fees on Ethereum are limiting mass adoption."

        "summary": "  Ethereum derivatives data suggests that the $1,700 resistance level may not hold for long, despite recent price improvements. Investors are concerned about regulatory pressure, but there has been some positive developments in China.

In this summary, we will discuss the current state of Solana, including its native scalability, competitive landscape, developer activity, and key protocol initiatives.\n\nNative Scalability: Solana's unique proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, combined with a timestamping function called proof-of-history (PoH), allows it to process up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS). This is significantly higher than many other blockchains, including Ethereum, which has been forced to scale its network through second- and third-layers.\n\nCompetitive Landscape: Solana has been facing challenges due to the recent collapse of FTX, which had invested heavily in the platform. However, the network's historical association with FTX has contributed to a decline in its value and perception. Despite this, Solana has maintained a focus on improving its resiliency and infrastructure, implementing upgrades to reduce spam transactions and eliminate network outages.\n\nDeveloper Activity"

Despite this, Algorand has been able to attract institutional investors due to its certification of components. The token's value has been on a downward trend since November 2021, but some analysts believe it may be due for a correction and could potentially target $0.410."
