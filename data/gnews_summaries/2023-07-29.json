        "title": "How Many Ethereum (ETH) Addresses Show Real Activity? You Would Be Surprised - U.Today",
        "summary": "  In a recent analysis of Ethereum (ETH) addresses, it was found that only 4.5-7 million of the 27 million new wallets created in the past year authorize at least one transaction per month. Additionally, 70% of these wallets are dropped after 30 days of activity. The majority of Ethereum (ETH) addresses show low activity, with 66% only active for one day and 95.5% active for less than 10 distinct days within the last year. However, a small number of wallets show sustainable activity, with 1.9 million wallets active for over 10 days in the last year. The report suggests that many of these low-activity wallets are likely created by \"airdrop hunters\" using sophisticated software to manipulate retroactive airdrops."
