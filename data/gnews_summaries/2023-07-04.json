        "summary": "  Sure, here's a summary of the article in 256 tokens or less:\n\nEthereum and NEAR are taking different approaches to blockchain scalability: Ethereum is using rollups, while NEAR is using sharding. Rollups execute state transitions off-chain and commit state roots and transactional data to the underlying L1, while sharding partitions the network into distinct segments built directly into the protocol. NEAR's sharding approach offers faster transaction finality and composability, while Ethereum's rollup-centric approach prioritizes resilience and simplicity. The different design philosophies of the two protocols will be interesting to watch as they evolve."
