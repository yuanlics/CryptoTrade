        "summary": "  Ethereum is burning over half of the coins issued since its merge, with 3.5 million coins burned so far. This makes the platform somewhat deflationary as the circulating ETH amount reduces as coins get actively burned on the network. However, ETH prices have not heavily responded to the burns, possibly due to less demand. The project's end goal is for the burn rate to outpace the rate of issuing new coins, turning Ethereum deflationary."

Lido's TVL briefly exceeded $15B in July but fell below the benchmark due to Ethereum's price correction. Despite this, Lido continues to command a substantial share of the aggregate TVL in DeFi. The protocol predicts that the total number of staked Ethereum will surpass 8M in August. The recent exploit of Curve Finance has led to a decline in stETH usage and share within liquidity pools. Other metrics show growing adoption of staked ETH, with an increase in unique addresses holding stETH and amount in lending pools. However, Lido's LDO token struggled in July due to contagion fears in the DeFi market."

The MPC wallets are secured by splitting a user's private key into multiple shards and distributing them through a decentralized network.

However, MPC wallets have faced controversy after a widely used bridge was hacked, losing over $100 million.

This shift has created new opportunities for staking index creation, which can enable social consensus and industry-wide benchmarking. Chris Perkins, the president of CoinFund, has seen the potential for staking yield indexes to provide a non-correlated rate to traditional finance, which could help investors achieve a stream of returns unconnected to conventional asset classes.\n\nAndy Baehr, the managing director of CoinDesk Indices, believes that using the Composite Ether Staking Rate (CESR) as a settlement rate could support a fixed-versus-floating swap market, enabling validators to experience less volatility in their revenue by swapping their variable staking yield for a fixed rate. Guillaume Le Fur, the CEO of Compass Financial Technologies, notes that some ETP providers have begun to offer clients a total return on ETH, and Compass is working with issuers to incorporate the returns from its index into the products.\n\nGreg Schvey"
