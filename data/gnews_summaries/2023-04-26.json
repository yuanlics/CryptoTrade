        "title": "Cryptocurrency Ethereum has slashed its energy use by 99.99 per cent - New Scientist",
        "summary": "  Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has successfully reduced its energy consumption by 99.99% through an experimental update called \"proof of stake.\" This update replaced the previous \"proof of work\" mechanism, which relied on powerful computer hardware to mine new currency and verify transactions. The new system, which was tested in September 2022, allows validators to lodge money with the network in exchange for the right to validate transactions and receive rewards. According to data from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, Ethereum's energy consumption dropped from 16.4 terrawatt hours in 2021 to just 6.6 gigawatt hours annually, a reduction of 99.99%. This is a significant improvement compared to its previous consumption, which was comparable to Switzerland's annual electricity consumption. However, experts say that a similar change in bitcoin, the largest digital currency, is unlikely due to its attachment to its current proof-of-work approach."

        "summary": "  Ethereum's switch to proof-of-stake (PoS) has significantly reduced its energy consumption, aligning with China's sustainability goals. After changing its architecture last September, Ethereum's energy usage plummeted by 99% to 235 kilowatts. Although energy consumption has risen since then, it is still significantly lower than before the change and comparable to iconic structures like the Eiffel Tower or the British Museum. Bitcoin's energy consumption, on the other hand, remains high, consuming 10.3 terawatt hours last month alone, more than 1,500 times Ethereum's annual consumption. China has been promoting blockchain technology and developing its own digital assets, while Hong Kong aims to become a regional virtual asset hub and balance its Web3 initiatives with sustainability goals."

        "summary": "  Ethereum's energy consumption over its lifetime is equivalent to Switzerland's energy use for a year, according to CoinDesk. The energy required to power the network is a major concern for proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithms like Ethereum. However, proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithms are more financially based, making it easier to disrupt the network through token acquisition."

        "title": "Is Ethereum More Decentralized After The Merge? - The Motley Fool",
        "summary": "  Ethereum's transition to proof of stake (PoS) has been completed, but its decentralization and security are still being evaluated. Before the merge, Ethereum had the second-highest hash rate of all cryptocurrencies, but now that it uses PoS, measuring its decentralization and security is more complicated.\n\nSince the merge, the number of validators has been increasing steadily, with over 600,000 validators currently participating. However, a small number of centralized companies control a significant portion of the staked Ether, with four validators controlling 53% of the total amount.\n\nThe staking ratio, which measures the amount of ether staked relative to the total circulating supply, is also lower than other PoS blockchains. Currently, almost 15% of the total ether supply is staked, compared to other blockchains like Cardano, Solana, and Avalanche, which are above 60%.\n\nOverall, while Ethereum's transition to PoS has been successful, it still has some growing pains to overcome in terms of decentralization and security."

The University of Cambridge released a new open-access tool, the Cambridge Blockchain Network Sustainability Index (CBNSI), to track electricity usage from cryptocurrencies, starting with Ethereum. The tool has already tracked electricity consumption from Ethereum before and after The Merge, a recent upgrade that moved Ethereum's proof-of-work model to a proof-of-stake model, which is more energy-efficient. The CBNSI's data shows a 99.99% decrease in Ethereum's electricity usage after The Merge. The tool does not yet have data on Ethereum's greenhouse gas emissions, but work is underway to translate the consumption data into emissions. The launch of the CBNSI aims to provide policymakers with the necessary data for evidence-based debate on the environmental impact of blockchain networks."
