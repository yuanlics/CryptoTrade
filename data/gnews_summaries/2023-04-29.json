        "summary": "  Ethereum (ETH) sharks and whales are not selling despite the coin's 33.93% drop in the last year. On-chain data shows that the number of addresses holding 1,000+ ETH increased by 5.7%. This suggests that these holders have a long-term bullish outlook. However, development activity on the Ethereum blockchain has slowed down, with the metric down to 53. The 365-day MVRV ratio of Ethereum is at 22.79%, indicating that sharks made profits over the last year. While whales have turned to spot buying opportunities, overall activity on the network has slowed down, with active addresses dropping from 7.9 million to 5.8 million. Despite this, the coin's circulation has improved, with a 4.41% increase in the last 24 hours."

        "title": "Bitcoin Could Jump Nearly 70% If the US Defaults: Standard Chartered - Markets Insider",
        "summary": "  Bitcoin could jump by nearly 70% if the US defaults on its debt, according to Standard Chartered's Geoff Kendrick. He believes that bitcoin's reputation as a safe haven asset will help it perform well in periods of stress. However, he also notes that the cryptocurrency may not rally in a straight line and could potentially dip before jumping. Kendrick suggests a long bitcoin, short ethereum trade as the optimal strategy in this scenario. The warning of a catastrophic default by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has investors on edge, with yields on three-month Treasurys reaching a 22-year high. Bitcoin has already rallied 80% so far in 2023, but could potentially see further gains if a default occurs."
