        "summary": "  Ethereum has the most developers overall, but newer chains like Solana, NEAR, and Polygon are growing rapidly in terms of monthly active developers. Despite a bear market in 2022, the crypto industry added 5% more developers year-over-year, with a total of over 23,000 developers now in the industry. Developer activity was busier in 2022 than in the previous crypto winter of 2018, with some devs opting for emerging blockchains like Sui, Aptos, and Starknet. Software for non-fungible tokens saw a 300% jump in developer engagement since 2021. Developer engagement is seen as an early indicator of value creation, with developers building killer applications that attract more customers and draw more developers."

        "summary": "  Sure, here's a summary of the article in less than 256 tokens:\n\nEthereum's shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) has increased institutional interest in staking, with institutions such as Anchorage Digital and Bitwise Asset Management seeing a significant increase in staking activity. The total reward rate for staking ETH is around 4%, and the number of staked ETH has increased by 117% in the past five months. Most participants in staking are retail investors or crypto-native hedge funds, but as the market matures, the range of investors participating will grow. The Shanghai upgrade in March will allow stakers to withdraw their ETH at any time, which is expected to substantially grow the staking market. However, staking is not riskless, and many service providers in the space are new, so it's important to be cautious. Institutions and other investors are waiting for the next stage of updates to the Ethereum network before jumping in."

An ascending triangle pattern is forming on the ETH/BTC weekly chart, indicating a bullish continuation pattern. However, the pair has attempted to break above the triangle's resistance trendline eight times since May 2021, with previous rallies fizzling out at the 0.082-0.085 BTC area. The ETH deflation narrative is also discussed, with Ether's market capitalization rising to nearly 20.5% of the entire crypto market valuation in January 2023. The Ethereum network's transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) has had a deflationary impact on overall supply, and the ETH/BTC price has grown nearly 250% since December 2020 despite still being down roughly 50% from its all-time highs."
