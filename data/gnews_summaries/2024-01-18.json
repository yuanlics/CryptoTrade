This has led to a notable increase in whale accumulation and a surge in demand pressure. The intraday trading volume in Ether has also seen a significant gain of 10.3%. The ETH price has rallied by 77% in the past four months, with a formation of an expanding channel on the daily time frame chart. While the coin price has rebounded thrice from this channel, there is a possibility of a further decline of 8-9% to reach the lower trendline around $2300. However, recent developments indicate that Ethereum is likely to rebound from this level and surge past $3000. The ETH/BTC pair has also seen a rebound from a crucial support level, with a weekly bullish divergence suggesting an upcoming uptrend. Overall, the outlook for Ethereum is optimistic, with bullish momentum expected to continue in the near term."

ETH's dominance against Bitcoin (BTC) is rising, with a 22.4% increase in price dominance in the past week. Network engagement is also increasing, with 90K new addresses created daily. The latest upgrade to the Ethereum network, codenamed \"Dencun,\" is expected to reduce transaction costs and introduce new functionalities. However, the ETH price is currently experiencing a corrective phase within a triangle pattern, with buyers aiming to maintain the price above $2,450. The market momentum is leaning towards the sellers, but a reversal or rebound from the current value could indicate a strong inclination for purchasing during dips. If the price breaks the pattern at $2,600, it could potentially surge to $2,700. Conversely, if the price continues to fall below $2,400, it could lead to a retest of the critical support zone at $2,130-$2,200."

        "summary": "  Ethereum (ETH) price is down 1.165% since yesterday, according to CoinStats. The hourly chart shows a bounce back from local support at $2,503, with a chance of testing resistance by tomorrow if buyers maintain control. However, bears are still more powerful on the bigger time frame, and a failure to return to the $2,600 zone could lead to a decline to $2,400. From a midterm perspective, ETH has a chance to continue rising, but a loss of the $2,447 level could lead to a correction down to $2,300-$2,400 by the end of the week. As of press time, Ethereum is trading at $2,527."
