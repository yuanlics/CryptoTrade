        "summary": "  Ethereum (ETH) has reached a 6-month low, with a large number of old coins moving out of wallets. This could signal a potential drop to $1,500, according to on-chain analytics platform Santiment. However, the platform also notes that the altcoin's burn mechanism could rescue it in the long term. The Mean Coin Age (MCA) has decreased, indicating a massive movement of UTXOs that have been immobile for a long period. Despite this, the funding rate for ETH perpetual futures contracts is negative, indicating bearish sentiment among traders. To recover, Ethereum may need to rely on other metrics, such as its burned supply, which has increased to 4.25 million."

Galler suggests that parallelism and performance can be improved by design, rather than being inherent to the execution layer. Offchain Labs senior software engineer Raul Jordan agrees that the EVM is \"fairly slow for many reasons,\" but notes that developers are already capable of building DeFi primitives and other applications with the current EVM. Jordan suggests that empowering developers with faster or new constructs could lead to even more innovative applications. Somani expresses concerns about the potential for an excess of layer-2 protocols, which could lead to liquidity fragmentation and poor end-user experience. However, Galler notes that sufficient local fee markets in virtual machines can mitigate this issue. Jordan concludes that the EVM is not the ceiling for scaling, but rather the floor, and that there is still much room for improvement in the execution layer."

The Churn Limit regulates the number of validators allowed to join or exit the network within a specific timeframe.
