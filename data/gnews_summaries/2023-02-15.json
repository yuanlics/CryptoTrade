The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is considering four options: selling a part or all of its Ether (ETH) for a stablecoin, staking part or all of its ETH on Lido in the form of Lido Staked Ether (stETH), or a combination of both. The proposal comes as ETH staking withdrawals are set to be enabled through Ethereum's Shanghai and Capella upgrades. The DAO is wary of not having enough Ether on hand in case of need, but also wants to prepare for any change in market conditions that may lead to increased operating expenses. Most LidoDAO members are in favor of partially selling and staking a portion of the 20,304 ETH locked in its Aragon smart contract. The total value locked (TVL) of stETH fell 6.66% from Feb. 6 to Feb. 13."

Polygon's Web3 strategy is gaining traction, with the integration of Web2 companies and the development of over 60 metaverse projects. However, the Ethereum sidechain's DeFi sector has stalled due to macroeconomic pressure and regulatory crackdowns on stablecoins. Total liquidity across DeFi applications on Polygon has remained below November 2022 levels, but favorable liquidity conditions could benefit Polygon when focus on DeFi picks up.
