        "summary": "  Here is a summary of the article in less than 256 tokens:\n\nEthereum has a higher concentration of its supply held by whales compared to Bitcoin, with 39% of Ethereum's supply held by large addresses compared to 11% of Bitcoin's supply. This is despite Ethereum's increased development activity and potential for future price growth. The concentration of crypto wealth in the hands of a few large holders is a controversial topic, with some arguing it is a natural market outcome and others claiming it goes against the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrency. The implications of this concentration on the future of the Ethereum ecosystem and its price are uncertain."
