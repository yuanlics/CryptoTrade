Buterin notes that the launch of Uniswap in 2018 marked the beginning of the DeFi era, with TVL reaching $1b by early 2020. NFTs are now core to the crypto industry, with applications in gaming, metaverse, and DeFi. Ethereum NFTs mostly comply with the ERC-721 standard, but can adopt other standards like ERC-1155."
