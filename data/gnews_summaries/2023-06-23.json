        "summary": "  Sure, here's a summary of the article in less than 256 tokens:\n\nBitcoin ETFs are gaining traction, with BlackRock's recent filing reviving a decade-long effort to launch a bitcoin ETF. Other firms have also filed for similar products. However, the fate of ether ETFs remains uncertain, with the SEC treating them differently than bitcoin ETFs. While some expect an ether ETF to be approved if a spot bitcoin ETF is approved, others believe it's premature and the SEC may prefer to evaluate ether futures ETFs first. The article concludes that the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF could pave the way for an ether ETF, but the SEC's reasoning and the market's characteristics will be crucial in determining the fate of such a product."
