        "title": "Ethereum stakers 'terrified' of slashing. Company coalition looks to make it nearly impossible - DLNews",
        "summary": "  Ethereum staking providers are concerned about \"slashing,\" a risk that can result in losing Ether due to mistakes in infrastructure. Cubist, a blockchain key management platform, has formed the Secure Staking Alliance with 16 other firms to address this issue. Cubist's solution involves creating an abstraction layer to prevent validators from accidentally publishing incorrect data, which can lead to slashing. The solution also includes using a \"sky key\" to ensure validators' messages contain the correct data. While this approach addresses the risk of slashing, it also raises concerns about the potential for unfair punishment of stakers. Other areas of staking, such as restaking protocols, also present unique slashing conditions that require additional protection."
