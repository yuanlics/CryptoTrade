        "summary": "  ERC721-C is an extension of the ERC721 non-fungible token standard on Ethereum that aims to give NFT creators more control and customization over their NFT collections and how royalties are treated. It is opt-in, and individual NFT holders can decide whether or not to adopt it. The new token standard is currently supported on certain NFT marketplaces, but full enforcement of royalties on-chain is still limited under ERC721. ERC721-C aims to change this by allowing creators to incorporate royalty logic directly into smart contract code, giving them more control over royalty settings. This could reduce the influence of marketplaces over royalties and incentivize creators to remain engaged in their projects."

        "summary": "  Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have remained relatively stable despite US SEC lawsuits against top crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase. The SEC has accused these exchanges of offering securities without proper registration, but the prices of these digital assets have only seen a slight decrease of 2-3% over the past week. Industry experts suggest that the SEC's crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges may have actually benefited Bitcoin, as investors have priced in the regulatory risks. Ethereum prices have gained over 3% in the past week, while other digital assets like Cardano, Solana, and Polygon have held steady or slightly increased in value. Binance.US has transitioned to an all-crypto exchange and denied the SEC's allegations, while Binance has expressed disappointment in the SEC's decision to file a complaint."
