Stellar saw a 10% increase in price, possibly due to a tweet from the Stellar team. There were also several announcements of adoption and partnerships in the crypto space, including the London Stock Exchange Group using blockchain technology to build an exchange, European Central Bank executive board member Fabio Panetta criticizing private stablecoins, and top-five South Korean financial conglomerate Hana Financial Group partnering with crypto custodian BitGo. Additionally, Visa expanded its settlement options to include USDC on the Solana blockchain, and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) voted to change how companies disclose crypto holdings.

Burniske, who accurately predicted the 2022 crypto bottom, believes Solana has factors that give it an edge over Ethereum, including quiet product launches, upgraded functionality, lower fees, and more throughput.

        "summary": "  Here's why the price of Ethereum barely moved after Ark Invest filed for an Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US:\n\n* Supply and demand balance: Large holdings are concentrated near Ethereum's current price, consolidating prices in a tight range.\n* Automated buying and discretionary selling: Discretionary sellers overtook the narrative after bullish traders bought the news. This is likely due to FTX's upcoming liquidation of reportedly $3B in crypto holdings.\n* Cautious trading: With Ethereum and Solana tokens constituting a significant portion of FTX's holdings, traders are being cautious due to the impending liquidation.\n\nThe ETH price continues to move sideways on the daily timeframe, with a negligible 0.1% price increase in the last seven days."

        "title": "2 Cryptocurrencies That Could Dwarf Ethereum - The Motley Fool",
        "summary": "  Two cryptocurrencies, Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL), have been gaining traction and could potentially surpass Ethereum (ETH) in value. Cardano, with a market cap of $9 billion, needs to increase in value by a multiple of 20 to 25 to reach Ethereum's current size, while Solana, with a market cap of $8 billion, needs a big idea to drive 50-fold valuation gains. Both cryptocurrencies have been making improvements and upgrades to their blockchain technology, with Cardano focusing on decentralized finance (DeFi) and Solana targeting mobile crypto. However, the chances of overtaking Ethereum are difficult, as it is a market leader with a first-mover advantage. Solana has a higher potential for growth, according to the author, due to its innovative approach to blockchain technology and mobile crypto."

        "summary": "  Bitcoin Spark is a new Bitcoin fork that aims to address the limitations of its predecessor while carving out a distinct path. It offers faster and more cost-efficient transactions, a more scalable platform for building smart contracts and decentralized applications, and a novel consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Process (PoP). PoP combines elements of Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Work, requiring miners/validators to provide a stake and processing power to the network in order to confirm blocks and earn rewards. Bitcoin Spark also introduces a unique real-world application for the ecosystem by renting out miners' processing power to organizations and individuals requiring significant amounts of remote computational power. The approach greatly reduces the power and work required for mining, promoting true decentralization and increasing the blockchain's security. Bitcoin Spark is currently in its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) stage, offering investors a chance to get BTCS before the network's official launch."
