SBTs represent credentials, affiliations, and commitments, but they lack the social context required for a decentralized society. Decentralized social graphs act as a bridge between SBTs and society, giving users greater control over their online identities while addressing privacy, security, and ownership concerns.\n\nRelation Labs, a Hong Kong-based Web3 company, has developed Semantic SBTs (EIP-6239) on Ethereum, which enables machines to understand complex actions in a subject/predicate/object manner. This allows for seamless encoding and decoding of social data with other decentralized applications (DApps) and platforms, enabling users to interact with their social graph and decentralized identity across different services.\n\nThe integration of decentralized social graphs and social identity benefits the Web3 space by enabling pseudonymous chatting over NFT marketplaces, DAOs, or"

The developers believe that this could make NFTs entirely different from jpegs, becoming new internet identities with the ability to interact and use them.
