        "summary": "  The European Investment Bank (EIB) has issued a \u00a350 million digital bond on a private blockchain, using Ethereum for transparency and efficiency. This is the first digital bond issued in GBP and marks a milestone in the tokenization of capital markets. The EIB, a public institution owned by the EU's 27 member states, opted for a private network for privacy and efficiency, and the bond was recorded on Ethereum to provide evidence of issuance while maintaining anonymity of bondholders. The new vehicle is expected to bring benefits such as reduced costs, improved efficiency, and real-time data synchronization to market participants. Digital bonds have gained interest from financial institutions in various countries, and the Luxembourg legal framework that enables firms to issue dematerialized securities using distributed ledger technology was enacted into law in January 2021."

Ethereum's value has been volatile, with a peak of over $4,500 and a low of below $1,000. The current price of $1,552.26 represents a significant increase from the starting point.\n\nThe reason for Ethereum's growth is its smart contract capability, which has attracted a critical mass of developers and venture capital funding. Coinbase, MetaMask, and OpenSea are some of the companies working to make Ethereum more usable. The blockchain has also undergone significant changes, including an upgrade from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, which reduced energy consumption by 99%. Upcoming upgrades, such as \"The Surge,\" \"The Verge,\" \"The Purge,\" and \"The Splurge,\" aim to improve scalability, speed, and user and developer friendliness.\n\nHowever, Ethereum faces competition from other blockchains"

        "summary": "  Ethereum (ETH) price is aiming for $1,800 in February, according to analysts, driven by improvements in investor sentiment in ETH derivatives and the formation of an ascending triangle pattern. However, the repeated failures to break the $1,680 resistance and negative newsflow may give bears power to cancel the bullish triangle pattern. The ETH derivatives market shows that traders are not comfortable with adding leverage longs, but are not worried if the $1,570 ascending channel support breaks. The article concludes that traders will watch to see if ETH bulls can keep the price within the bullish triangle formation for the next two weeks, but if the macroeconomic environment allows, ETH derivatives point to a potential rally towards $1,800."

This approach has raised concerns about driving up transaction costs and marginalizing peoples in developing countries who will have to pay more to run their Bitcoin nodes and send transactions. Despite the controversy, Ordinals brings the quest for NFTs on Bitcoin closer than ever, as it does not require a sidechain or layer-2 solution or an additional cryptocurrency to work."
