        "title": "Ethereum's 'Dencun' upgrade likely delayed into 2024 - CryptoSlate",
        "summary": "  Ethereum's next major upgrade, Dencun, is likely to be delayed into 2024 due to ongoing development and testing. Despite being mostly complete, Dencun still needs to be deployed to a testnet before it can be launched on the mainnet. The Ethereum Foundation member, Tim Beiko, stated that if they don't deploy to a testnet before Devconnect in November, it's unlikely that mainnet launch will occur before the Christmas holidays. Developers are considering testing Dencun on an older testnet, Goerli, before moving to the new Holesky testnet for the second and third forks. Dencun combines two upgrades, Deneb and Cancun, and brings new features, including proto-danksharding, which will improve Ethereum's scalability when it's finally launched on mainnet."

This decrease is a positive sign for Ethereum's utility and adoption, as lower fees make it more affordable to use the network. However, the impact on ETH price has been limited, with the token continuing to trade below the $1,600 mark.

Despite this, the on-chain analytics platform Santiment notes that rising utility is often the case due to Ether tokens becoming more affordable to circulate."

        "title": "ETH Price Struggles Continue Despite Record Low Network Fees - DailyCoin",
        "summary": "  Ethereum's network fees have hit a new low in 2023, averaging around $1.15 per transaction. This is a significant decrease from the high fees witnessed in 2021 and 2022, which were driven by increased demand for processing power. The lower fees make the network more economically viable for users and could contribute to increased adoption and utility. However, despite this development, Ethereum's price has struggled to break free from ongoing selling pressure, with a modest 2.6% decline over the past week. The drop in fees may be driven by decreased network activity rather than increased efficiency, which could challenge Ethereum's ability to retain its user base and attract new users."

The upgrade, which aims to improve scalability, was scheduled to be launched before Devconnect, an Ethereum-focused developer conference in November. However, the consensus-layer team has expressed concerns about the delay, stating that the upgrade needs more time to be tested on public testnets like Holesky, Goerli, and Sepolia. The team is now focusing on a localized developer network called \"Devnet 9\" to assess the functionality of Dencun before it goes to the public testnet phase. While the delay may be frustrating for users, it's better to wait for a flawless upgrade than to use subpar functionalities."
