        "content": "Top analyst and crypto commentator who goes by @hedge__x on X (formerly Twitter) is sure that Ethereum (ETH) has all chances to outshine Bitcoin (BTC) in the coming bull run.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Max pain for Bitcoin Dominance\": Trader skeptical about Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency, is going to set a new all-time high in this cycle. However, even over $100,000 per BTC, it will be disappointing for many Bitcoiners, @hedge__x shared on Jan. 19 on his X.\n\nCorn is going higher this cycle but many will be disappointed at $100k peak.\n\n\n\nETH has much more upside potential w many more future catalyst including ETF.\n\n\n\nMax pain for BTC.D. Max gain for Total2. \u2014 Hedgex.eth (@hedge__x) January 19, 2024\n\nBy contrast, Ethereum (ETH) has way more impressive upside potential compared to the orange coin. Among other catalysts, Ethereum (ETH) has possible ETF approval ahead. This might be an amazing catalyst for the next ETH rally.\n\nIt should be noted that Ethereum (ETH) is getting closer to EIP-4844 or Proto-Danksharding upgrade activation. It is set to change the game in L2s and make them more resource-efficient.\n\nAs such, the analyst is positive about the potential of Total2, an indicator of cumulative cryptocurrency markets capitalization excluding Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nThe Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) indicator is due to go through \"maximum pain,\" the trader concluded.\n\nLegal status of Ether is crucial for ETH ETF approval\n\nIn January 2024, Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) is losing momentum. After registering a local high over 55% on Jan. 9, it lost 7.5% (4.6 points) in less than 10 days.\n\nEthereum ETF is one of the most anticipated events for the cryptocurrency segment in 2024. The community and experts are moderately optimistic about its potential approval.\n\nHowever, the court processes between the U.S. SEC and crypto exchanges over illegal securities offering might affect the timeline of the ETH ETF approval.\n\nTogether with other large-cap altcoins, Ether is one of the tokens the SEC claimed to be unregistered securities."

        "content": "Crypto analytics firm Kaiko says that speculative fervor on Ethereum (ETH) hasn\u2019t yet kicked off, despite being well off its 2022 lows.\n\nIn a new report, Kaiko says that Bitcoin has benefited from the hype surrounding the approval of BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, but that speculation on an Ethereum ETF has not yet begun.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently decided to delay its decision on banking giant Fidelity\u2019s spot market Ethereum ETF application until March.\n\nSays Kaiko,\n\n\u201cWhile there is some hype around ETH ETF applications, the data suggest that aggressive speculation hasn\u2019t yet begun. ETH trade volume has spiked, but derivatives markets have lacked the telltale signs of traders positioning for a rally. ETH futures ETFs have also had a slow few months of trading.\n\nETH and BTC correlation has sunk to multi-year lows as each asset matures and develops its own narratives. While ETFs were one of the most catalyzing narratives in BTC\u2019s history, it remains to be seen whether ETH will be able to replicate this. However, ETH has many narratives it can lean on; if ETFs don\u2019t spur enthusiasm, perhaps new Layer-2s or the success of EigenLayer and restaking can.\u201d\n\nKaiko says that derivatives data also indicates that recent ETH moves have largely been driven by spot markets rather than by perpetual futures, which the firm says provides evidence that traders are not using leverage in anticipation of an ETH ETF.\n\n\u201cSeptember and October marked a low point in futures markets, with aggregated open interest (in USD) falling more than 20% from its summer levels. At this time, there was little price movement and funding rates were neutral\u2026\n\nPost-BTC approval, funding rates have reset to neutral, while open interest has surged ahead of price, indicative of increased shorting. Even still, we have not yet seen a major build-up in open interest that is typical of a bull market.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, ETH is trading for $2,473.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is currently on the edge, with increasing concerns that Grayscale might persist in selling its Bitcoin holdings. This fear stems from investors shedding shares of the GBTC ETF, sparking a wider market sell-off. Amid this downturn, the second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum formed a local top at $2700 and entered a new correction phase.\n\nWithin a fortnight, the ETH price is down 9% to currently trading at $2467. Moreover, a notable development in Ethereum\u2019s Implied volatility and Option writing for coming months projects that future traders are expecting a prolonged correction for this asset.\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH Price Analysis: Expanding Channel Pattern Sets Dive Below $2400\n\nThe formation of an expanding channel pattern reflects increased uncertainty among market participants.\n\nA healthy retracement in ETH price keeps the overall trend bullish\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $4.63 Billion, indicating a 39% loss.\n\nThe last two months\u2019 recovery in Ethereum price can be followed using two diverging trendlines of an expanding channel pattern. Amid this rally, the coin price has showcased several rebounds from the two trendlines indicating the traders have taken a strict on the pattern structure.\n\nOn January 12th, the ETH price witnessed its latest reversal from the upper trendline, which initiated a new bear cycle within the channel. By the press time, the ETH price is trading at $2469, trying to hold above local support of $2400.\n\nAs per the recent data from Deribit Insight, Ethereum\u2019s implied volatility (IV), as measured by the Dvol proxy over the past week, experienced a significant decline, dropping from 64% to 47%, largely driven by structured call selling in both markets.\n\nThis indicates a change in strategy, with some investors possibly exiting long positions or engaging in overwriting strategies against their Ethereum holdings. Key transactions include the selling of 45,000 February calls with a strike price of $2,700, and 28,000 March calls at a $2,900 strike price. Additionally, there was a strategic move where 25,000 January $2,600 calls were covered, followed by the selling of April calls at a $2,900 strike.\n\nSuch Heavy Call selling at the aforementioned psychological level indicates the option traders believe the Ethereum coin is less likely to surge higher in coming months but rather remains in a sideways or correction trend.\n\nWill ETH Price Correction Hit $2000?\n\nIf the broader market continues to fuel selling pressure, the Ethereum price is likely to break the immediate support of $2400. The post-breakdown fall would tumble the price another 6.5% to retest the channel\u2019s lower trendline at $2300.\n\nThe rising trendline has acted as dynamic support for over two months and its possible breakdown intensifies the supply pressure. The extended downfall may plunge the ETH price to following support of $2140, and $1920.\n\nMoving Average Convergence Divergence: A bearish crossover between MACD and the signal line reflects an active correction sentiment in the market.\n\nBollinger Band: The upper boundary of the Bollinger band going flat reflects a weakening in bullish momentum.\n\nRelated Articles:"

This seemed to be the case as ETH\u2019s fees gained upward momentum.\n\nIn addition to the uptick, the blockchain\u2019s revenue also followed a similar increasing trend. However, a negative flag was the drop in its TVL.\n\nWill ETH\u2019s price move up further?\n\nThough ETH\u2019s value surged in double digits last month and network activity remained high, its daily chart turned red. The king of altcoins was down by more than 2% in the last 24 hours.\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $2,477.74 with a market capitalization of over $297 billion.\n\nTo see how investors were reacting to this, we checked Santiment\u2019s data. Our analysis revealed that investors were exerting buying pressure on the token. This was evident from the fact that Ethereum\u2019s supply on exchanges dipped while its supply outside of exchanges went up.\n\nAdditionally, whales were also confident in ETH as its supply held by top addresses increased last week.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nConsidering the high ecosystem activity and buying pressure, the possibility of a price uptick in the coming days can\u2019t be ruled out. Therefore, AMBCrypto then took a look at ETH\u2019s liquidation heatmap to see the upcoming resistance levels.\n\nOur analysis revealed that ETH would face strong resistance near the $2,600 mark. If it managed to climb above that level, it would again face resistance between $2,770 and $2,800."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2024, Is $6000 Possible? - Live Bitcoin News",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has recently shown remarkable resilience and strength in the crypto market. As of now, Ethereum is trading at $2,563, reflecting a minor drop of -2.67% over the past 24 hours. This decline follows a period of impressive growth in which ETH surged by 23.22% in just three weeks. The recent bullish momentum has catapulted Ethereum back above the 50% level, signaling a potential continuation of the positive price action in the coming months. The ETH price prediction algorithm paints an even more optimistic picture, forecasting a staggering +253% price increase by the second quarter of 2024. If this prediction holds, Ethereum could be valued at an all-time high of $6,339.What\u2019s driving this anticipated surge? The primary catalyst is the upcoming Bitcoin (BTC) halving event, a significant occurrence in the world of cryptocurrency.\n\nUnderstanding the Bitcoin Halving and Its Timing\n\nThe Bitcoin halving event takes place approximately every four years or after every 210,000 blocks mined. During this event, the rewards miners receive for verifying transactions and securing the network are halved. This reduction in mining rewards introduces deflationary pressure into the Bitcoin ecosystem, gradually decreasing the supply of new BTC entering circulation. Historically, Bitcoin\u2019s deflationary mechanism has triggered new bull markets for cryptocurrencies. Each halving event has been followed by a surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price, ultimately leading to new all-time highs. The last Bitcoin halving took place in 2020, and the next one is scheduled for April 15, 2024.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Potential Post-Halving Growth\n\nEthereum has a history of significant price increases following Bitcoin\u2019s halving events. After the previous BTC halving, Ethereum\u2019s price skyrocketed by +2133%. This remarkable surge firmly established Ethereum as the second-most valuable cryptocurrency, propelling its native token, Ether (ETH), from $217 to an astonishing $4,864 within 18 months. One trader, known as Sporia on TradingView, has charted a long-term projection for ETH\u2019s price. The chart highlights two parallel trading channels that Ethereum has followed since the 2018 alt season, featuring a strong support line that has withstood the bearish market conditions of 2022 and 2023. Sporia points out an essential indicator: the reversal indicator signal, which has only been triggered four times in Ethereum\u2019s history, each time preceding a massive rally. According to Sporia\u2019s analysis, Ethereum is likely to maintain this market structure over the next five years. The upper resistance line in the chart provides price targets for Ethereum during the next two bullish phases of Bitcoin\u2019s four-year cycles, including a target of $16,090 in 2025. This represents an impressive +799% price increase from its current level. While Ethereum has experienced relative underperformance compared to other cryptocurrencies during recent bullish periods, with a +60% gain compared to the total crypto market cap\u2019s +80% rise in the past year, this should not raise alarm. Ethereum underwent a significant upgrade during the bear market, transitioning from a proof-of-work to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, known as The Merge. Moreover, Ethereum has benefited from increased regulatory clarity from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the introduction of new exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 scaling solutions have made substantial progress, further boosting the demand for the native ETH token. In summary, Ethereum is poised for significant growth, with a price prediction algorithm suggesting a +253% increase in the next seven months. This projection aligns with the timing of the next Bitcoin halving event, which could catalyze Ethereum\u2019s surge to new all-time highs. Amid the excitement surrounding Ethereum\u2019s potential and the upcoming Bitcoin halving, another cryptocurrency is making waves in the crypto market\u2014Retik Finance (RETIK).

It would allow investors to gain exposure to digital assets without directly owning them.\n\nAccording to James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg, the SEC may choose to approve a batch of spot Ethereum ETFs as it did with Bitcoin. Seyffart pointed to May 23 as the next key date, the deadline for the regulator\u2019s decision on VanEck\u2019s Ethereum ETF application.\n\nThe SEC approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs last week, allowing such funds to be traded for the first time in the U.S. Before the approvals, the SEC rejected all spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nEther price outshined Bitcoin\u2019s price following the approvals surging past US$2,600 for the first time since May 2022, CoinGecko data shows.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is currently awaiting the introduction of an Ethereum ETF after the approval of a Bitcoin ETF. Meanwhile, because of Pullix\u2019s security, investors are becoming more interested in ERC20 tokens.\n\nWhat Has Happened To Bitcoin (BTC) Since Its ETF Approval?\n\nThe United States Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs\u2014the news of the approval spiraled across the crypto community.\n\nBefore the approval, analysts predicted a surge in Bitcoin price due to increased inflows from institutional investors. Standard Chartered analysts predicted fund inflows ranging from $50 billion to $100 billion in 2024.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin has yet to rally a few days after the Bitcoin ETF approval. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin price has fluctuated between $41,753.68 and $48,494.62 in the past week.\n\nAt the moment, Bitcoin is facing huge selling pressure around the $48k level. Still, analysts remain bullish on the flagship cryptocurrency. All eyes are now on the Bitcoin halving to spark a bullish run. Analysts predict a surge to $50k and $100k in the long run.\n\nEthereum (ETH) ETF Approval Coming?\n\nSince the US SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETF, the crypto community has been betting on spot Ethereum ETFs. While some analysts believe spot Ethereum ETFs could be next in line, others have a different opinion. An example of such an analyst is JPMorgan\u2019s Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou.\n\nAccording to the analyst, the regulator must classify Ethereum as a commodity before approving spot Ethereum ETFs. On the other hand, Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas forecasts a 70% possibility that an Ethereum ETF will be approved by May.\n\nSeveral big firms, including Fidelity and BlackRock, have filed for spot Ethereum ETFs. An approval of Ethereum ETF could push the price of Ethereum as high as $4500, per analysts.\n\nPullix (PLX) Native Token Catches Investors\u2019 Interest\n\nPullix (PLX) ERC20 token, PLX, has been the main talk of investors since the beginning of its presale. The token is built on the Ethereum blockchain, meaning more security. Also, its price has increased 100% to $0.08 in less than a month. All these have gained attention among investors.\n\nThe upcoming launch of the Pullix exchange also adds to the increased interest from investors. This DeFi project is prepared to launch in Q1 2024 following its presale. It is a hybrid exchange platform, combining the strengths of both centralized and decentralized exchanges.\n\nUsers of the Pullix platform are able to trade in a range of markets such as stocks, commodities, forex indices and options. Daily turnover in the forex market is more than $6.6 trillion. Given the profit-making nature of PLX, analysts are positive about its growth in 2024. Pullix allows users to generate passive revenue by staking the PLX altcoin.\n\nStaking basically implies locking tokens in a smart contract to strengthen the platform\u2019s liquidity. Based on the quantity and duration of staking, a reward is issued. As the period of investment increases, the profits increase, too. Pullix further presents the Market-Making Liquidity Contribution, which means that any user can act as a market maker and contribute liquidity to this platform.\n\nThe annual return paid to market makers on Pullix is between 8% and 18%. This strategy is likely to increase the number of users using Pullix, which will encourage its use. With its price now standing at $0.08 per token, Pullix is already regarded as one of the best DeFi projects to invest in 2024.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile Bitcoin ETF approval has not given the expected price movement, investors are hoping Ethereum will perform differently. Meanwhile, analysts are predicting a 100x rise in Pullix\u2019s altcoin value.\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Crypto Price Prediction: The cryptocurrency market is experiencing relative stability during the weekend, following a bearish trend earlier in the week. This downturn saw Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, fall from a high of $49,000 to $40,300, marking a 17.85% loss.\n\nThis selling pressure is largely attributed to Grayscale beginning to sell its Bitcoin holdings in response to investors offloading shares of the GBTC ETF. The outflow of $2.2 billion from Grayscale\u2019s GBTC and concerns about the Bitcoin ETF being a \u2018sell-the-news\u2019 event have led most major cryptocurrencies into a correction phase.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDespite this, several industry experts view the current downturn as a natural correction, necessary for the major cryptocurrencies to gather strength for future growth.\n\nOn the Bitcoin weekly time frame chart, there\u2019s a notable struggle to sustain above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, around $42,300. This effort to reclaim 50% of the lost value from the recent downtrend reflects a growing conviction among market bulls and a weakening hold by bears on the asset.\n\nWith a positive outlook for the near future, the following cryptocurrencies Ethereum(ETH), Solana(SOL), and Luna Classic (LUNC) can offer suitable pullback opportunities to traders.\n\nWhy Ethereum (ETH) Price Nearing a 22% Breakout Rally\n\nAmid the current downturn in the crypto market, the Ethereum price recently hit a local high of $2700 before starting a correction phase this week. The price now stands at $2487, reflecting a loss of 8.35% over the past two weeks.\n\nA closer examination of the 4-hour chart reveals that this correction is contained within two converging trendlines, forming what appears to be a pennant pattern. If this pattern proves accurate, it suggests that the current correction phase could be a consolidation period, allowing buyers to gather strength for a potential upward movement.\n\nAdding to this bullish perspective is a notable observation by Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, regarding Ethereum\u2019s staking activity. On January 18th, he highlighted in a tweet that 24% of Ethereum\u2019s total supply is now staked, with only 11% available on exchanges. Contrary to expectations of significant unstaking post the Shapella upgrade, the staking rate continues to rise.\n\nGiven these technical and on-chain developments, the ETH price might break through the pennant\u2019s upper trendline, indicating an end to the correction phase. This breakout could potentially spark a rally of around 22%, pushing the price beyond the $3000 mark..\n\nNew Found Support Bolsters Solana (SOL) Price Rally to $125, But There\u2019s More\n\nSolana, the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has displayed impressive resilience amid the broader market\u2019s downturn, holding steadily above the crucial $85 mark. This level coincides with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement, signaling that buyers are maintaining a strong foothold.\n\nAs highlighted in a recent analysis by Coingape, the Solana price correction is shaping the \u2018handle\u2019 of a larger Cup-and-Handle pattern, a bullish chart formation. This suggests that the ongoing retracement could rejuvenate the bullish momentum, potentially driving the SOL price up by 35% to breach the critical neckline resistance at $125.\n\nA successful breakout from this neckline, particularly if backed by a daily candle closing above it, would be a robust indication of a trend reversal. Such a development could set the Solana price on a path towards a significant target of $255.\n\nTerra Classic (LUNC) Price Wavering In a Mark-or-Break Scenario\n\nThe Terra Classic (LUNC) price has been in a corrective phase since December 2023, with its price dropping from a high of $0.00028 to its current value of $0.000118, indicating a substantial 60% loss.\n\nThe coin found crucial support at the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level around $0.0000102, changing its course from a downward trend to sideways. The daily chart shows that this consolidation has evolved into a symmetrical triangle pattern, typically a sign of the continuation of the existing trend.\n\nA breakdown below this triangle\u2019s lower support trendline might lead to further price declines for LUNC, potentially towards $0.0000975 and then $0.0000842. Alternatively, a rare upside break from this pattern could signal an attempt by buyers to regain bullish momentum.\n\nIf buyers manage a breakout, they could be looking at an upward rally towards resistance levels at $0.000147, followed by $0.000173, providing a much-needed boost to reverse the bearish sentiment.\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "content": "SEC extends spot ETH ETF decision by 45 days\n\nMore ETH flows out of exchanges as the wait begins\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has taken its first concrete step of the year on the route to either approving or rejecting an Ethereum spot ETF. This action was conveyed through a response sent by the SEC to Fidelity.\n\nSEC responds to Fidelity\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF application\n\nAs per a letter dated 18 January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has decided to extend its decision-making process regarding the Fidelity spot Ethereum ETF application. The application, submitted on 17 November 2023 and opened for comments on 6 December, will now undergo an extended resolution period. This follows the SEC\u2019s choice to extend the decision timeline by 45 days.\n\nConsequently, the resolution is anticipated to be around 5 March 2024. Also, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart suggests that approval may be possible in May. Notably, BlackRock\u2019s CEO Larry Fink is pretty confident of the value attached to a spot Ethereum ETF. He claimed so in an interview shortly after the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nEthereum remains in a downtrend\n\nUpon the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF, there was no notable surge in price, with analysts attributing this to it being priced in before the announcement. Interestingly, for Ethereum, the news of the proposal submission and the subsequent decision announcement may significantly impact the price more than the actual approval.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was trading at around $2,400, experiencing a slight loss of less than 1% in 24 hours. Although it seems to be on a downtrend, ETH\u2019s present value is higher than what its value was a year ago.\n\nAn analysis of the daily timeframe chart revealed that ETH did not reach the present price level over the previous year. Additionally, the ongoing bull trend continued while showing signs of weakening. Notably, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remained above the neutral line, indicating a bullish trend at press time.\n\nObserving the exchange flow\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s examination of Ethereum\u2019s exchange flow showed that the balance between inflow and outflow shifted around 14 January. Since then, there has been a consistent trend of more outflow than inflow. This suggested that a more significant amount of ETH is leaving exchanges, compared to the incoming volume.\n\nAlso, the trend implied that fewer Ethereum assets are being offered for sale recently.\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nAs of 18 January, the data highlighted that over 90,000 ETH have moved out of exchanges, further supporting the notion that market participants are withdrawing their assets from exchange platforms."

The chart depicts a clear downward trajectory as SHIB failed to maintain its position within the ascending triangle pattern it had formed over the past few months.\n\nThe breakdown was signaled as SHIB prices breached the key support level at $0.000009, which had previously acted as a reliable floor for the price during consolidation phases. Following this, SHIB prices tumbled further, slicing through subsequent support near $0.0000087. This price action marked a decisive shift in market sentiment from accumulation to distribution.\n\nThe next support level to watch is at $0.0000082, where SHIB may find a temporary reprieve from the selling pressure. If this level fails to hold, the next critical support lies at $0.0000076, which could serve as the last line of defense before a more significant drop.\n\nFor a reversal to occur and for SHIB to regain its upward momentum, it would need to reclaim previous support levels and transform them back into supports. This would require a substantial influx of buying pressure, potentially sparked by positive developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem or broader cryptocurrency market rallies.\n\nThe first sign of a possible reversal would be a return above $0.0000087, followed by a sustained move above the $0.000009 price level. A breakout above these levels, accompanied by increasing volume, could indicate that the downtrend is losing steam and that bulls are regaining control.\n\nSolana paints reversal pattern\n\nSolana has been developing a subtle yet potentially pivotal chart pattern. The asset has been tracing a slow and steady ascending channel, a formation that suggests a controlled and consistent uptrend. This pattern, characterized by higher lows and higher highs contained within two parallel trendlines, speaks to potential for continued growth.\n\nThe significance of this pattern lies in the momentum it could provide for SOL. Should the price action remain strong within the upper half of the channel, and particularly if it challenges the upper trendline, we could see Solana break through and embark on a more aggressive rally.\n\nSuch a bullish scenario would likely be supported by increased trading volume and positive developments within the Solana ecosystem, such as new project launches or updates that enhance network performance.\n\nThe immediate local resistance stands at around $55, and a confident push beyond this could confirm bullish sentiment. Inversely, if Solana's price dips below the channel's lower boundary, around $48, it could indicate that a bearish narrative is taking hold.\n\nEthereum momentum decreasing\n\nEthereum is exhibiting signs of waning momentum, as observed in recent price movements. The asset, which has long been considered the backbone of the decentralized finance sector, is facing a pivotal moment that could determine its trajectory for the coming weeks.\n\nThe provided chart illustrates Ethereum's struggle to maintain its grasp on the market. The price has been on a downward trend, edging closer to the local 26-day Exponential Moving Average. This level, currently near $2,465, is critical; if Ethereum fails to hold this line, we might see it descend to test the more significant 50 EMA, which stands around the $2,300 mark.\n\nThe 26 EMA serves as a short-term sentiment gauge, and its breach could signal a lack of immediate bullish support. Should this level fail to act as a springboard for price recovery, Ethereum's next stop could indeed be the 50 EMA. A breach below this longer-term moving average could potentially open the gates for a test of lower support levels, highlighting the need for investors to brace for more volatility.\n\nMarket participants are now recalibrating their expectations, understanding that the road to sustainable gains is a long-term journey."

        "content": "ETC\u2019s price has dropped by double digits in the last week.\n\nDespite the price dip, bullish momentum remains.\n\nFollowing a post-ETF-approval rally, Ethereum Classic [ETC] has begun to shed its gains. AMBCrypto reported earlier that Ethereum-linked tokens ETC and Ethereum Name Service [ENS] climbed to 12-month highs after the long-awaited ETF decision on 10th January.\n\nAs of this writing, ETC exchanged hands at $23.90, dropping by 19% in the last week, data from CoinMarketCap showed.\n\nBullish momentum remains\n\nETC\u2019s price surge post-ETF approval was backed by no real uptick in demand for ETC. Now that the excitement surrounding the ETF has waned, the coin has witnessed a drop in value.\n\nHowever, despite the recent price pullback, an assessment of ETC\u2019s price movements on a daily chart revealed that bullish momentum persisted. At press time, the coin\u2019s momentum indicator rested above their respective center lines, suggesting that buying pressure exceeded coin sell-offs.\n\nFurther, the coin\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) returned a value above the zero line. When an asset\u2019s CMF value rests above zero, it signals the presence of more buying pressure.\n\nAt 0.06 and in an uptrend when writing, ETC\u2019s CMF showed rising liquidity being supplied to the coin\u2019s spot market. This is known to drive up an asset\u2019s value.\n\nConfirming the bullish trend, readings from ETC\u2019s Directional Movement Index (DMI) showed its positive directional index (green) resting above the negative directional index (red).\n\nWhen these trend lines are positioned in this manner, it suggests that the strength of the bulls exceeds that of the bears.\n\nHowever, the price decline experienced in the last week has resulted in a fall in ETC\u2019s futures open interest. According to data from Coinglass, since 12th January, ETC\u2019s open interest has plunged by 22%.\n\nAs of this writing, the coin\u2019s futures open interest was $162.34\n\nVolatility lingers in the market\n\nThe hike in ETC price post-ETF approval led to a surge in market volatility.\n\nWith the gap between the upper and lower bands of the coin\u2019s Bollinger Bands (BB) indicator still widening at press time, ETC remained prone to price swings."

        "content": "As the weekend unfolds, Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a notable uptick, trading at $41,700 with nearly 1.40% increase on Saturday. Despite this positive momentum, skepticism remains as The New York Times maintains a cautious stance on Bitcoin\u2019s prospects. Adding to the wary outlook, the RBI Governor has flagged cryptocurrencies as a risk to the stability of the Indian Rupee, urging investors to proceed with caution.\n\nMeanwhile, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has reported a loss of $2.3 million by the cryptocurrency exchange Debiex due to alleged romance scams, highlighting the vulnerabilities within the crypto space. Furthermore, the strength of the US Dollar Index (DXY) is seen as a potential threat to Bitcoin\u2019s recovery, compounded by the selling pressure from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).\n\nWith such diverse factors at play, investors are pondering whether it\u2019s the opportune moment to buy into Bitcoin and Ethereum as the latter taps the $2,500 mark.\n\nRBI Governor Cautions: Cryptocurrency Threatens Rupee Stability\n\n\n\nGovernor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Shaktikanta Das, has spoken about the serious risks that come with cryptocurrencies, particularly for developing nations. Das underlined the possible effects on the monetary system, currency stability, and financial stability. He voiced worries about cryptocurrencies\u2019 lack of underlying assets and their ability to replace money in payment systems and banking.\n\nDas highlights the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies and sees considerable risks, even in spite of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission having approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The governor\u2019s cautious approach increases the regulatory obstacles that cryptocurrencies must overcome and may lead to more volatility in the market.\n\nCFTC Reports: Debiex Exchange Hit by $2.3M Romance Scams\n\n\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has labeled cryptocurrency exchange Debiex as a \u201cfraudulent digital asset platform,\u201d accusing its senior staff of orchestrating romantic deceptions to defraud money.\n\nCFTC Charges Bogus Digital Asset Platform with Fraud and Misappropriation in an Online Romance Scam: https://t.co/RpskNapy7i \u2014 CFTC (@CFTC) January 19, 2024\n\nThe CFTC\u2019s report alleges that Debiex representatives engaged in forming intimate relationships with potential clients, gaining their trust, and subsequently persuading them to open and fund trading accounts. This scheme reportedly siphoned over $2 million, with five victims currently identified over two years.\n\nThese romance scam allegations add to a series of challenges within the cryptocurrency industry, potentially impacting investor sentiment and activity by undermining the trust and credibility of crypto exchanges.\n\nUS Dollar Rally and GBTC Sell-Off Endanger Bitcoin\u2019s Recovery\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Dollar Index\u2019s (DXY) rally, up 2.71% from its December 27 low, poses a challenge to Bitcoin\u2019s price recovery. Bolstered by robust retail sales and positive economic data, the DXY has seen significant gains. Concurrently, Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has experienced substantial outflows, with around 38,000 BTC withdrawn since January 11, when spot Bitcoin ETFs were introduced.\n\nEconomist Peter Schiff attributes these GBTC outflows as a key factor preventing Bitcoin\u2019s price rise. Technical analysis suggests Bitcoin could potentially fall back to around $34,000, having been repelled at the $48,000 level, which aligns with the upper limit of an ascending parallel channel."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency analysts are currently divided on the future trajectory of Bitcoin (BTC) in relation to Ethereum (ETH), its closest counterpart in market capitalization ranking.\n\nOne prominent analyst, known by the handle @hedge__x on X has predicted that Bitcoin\u2019s price will experience an upward trajectory in the current market cycle.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, the forecast comes with a caution \u2013 the analyst suggests that despite the optimism, many investors might find themselves disappointed if the peak only reaches $100,000.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Ascent Signals Potential\n\nAmidst the varied sentiments surrounding Bitcoin\u2019s projected peak, there is a prevailing belief in the crypto space that Ethereum (ETH) holds significant upside potential.\n\nThe analyst highlighted Ethereum as a potentially more lucrative investment compared to Bitcoin. Similar predictions were made at the start of January that Ethereum would reach $10,000 which prompted a series of debates and analysis.\n\nThis perspective is anchored in the anticipation of several catalysts, prominently the potential introduction of an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) product for Ethereum. The sentiment echoes through the crypto community, suggesting that while Bitcoin may experience a peak at $100,000, Ethereum is poised for more substantial gains.\n\nThe ongoing discussion around Bitcoin\u2019s peak performance and Ethereum\u2019s potential rise highlights the complex dynamics that shape the perceptions of analysts and investors in this rapidly evolving market.\n\nFor instance, Samson Mow recently made a big claim on the X platform in his Silver comparison as the \u201cpoor man\u2019s gold.\u201d In the post, he also took a jab at Ethereum, comparing it to the link between silver and gold. He even made a direct claim that Ethereum is the \u201cstupid man\u2019s Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nBrighter Upsides for ETH\n\nIn the ever-evolving world of the cryptocurrency market, analysts and investors diligently scrutinize multiple factors to make informed predictions and investment decisions. According to some market analysts, Ethereum (ETH) is poised to overtake Bitcoin as the dominant player in the market in 2024.\n\nRegulatory developments, technological advancements, and market trends are among the critical aspects under constant observation. The overall market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market is alluded to by the analyst @hedge__x\u2019s reference of \u201cTotal2\u201d in his analysis.\n\nAs debates rages on in the crypto community, attention will be on Ethereum (ETH), especially as the protocol is undergoing one of its most important upgrades thus far \u2013 the Dencun Upgrade."

However, it raises the question of whether this has influenced the overall transaction volume on these networks.\n\nSui and Solana take in the Ethereum flow\n\nWormhole data showed that around $370 million in liquidity shifted away from Ethereum in the last month. Sui and Solana accounted for about 90% of this outflow.\n\nPresently, these two networks continue to dominate, with an Ethereum outflow totaling over $106.2 million. Sui received around $68 million, while Solana received approximately $27 million, making up a combined 89% of the outflow from Ethereum.\n\nAnalyzing the Sui and Solana volume\n\nA recent analysis of Sui\u2019s volume on DefiLlama showed a significant uptick in the past few days. Examining the chart reveals that the volume witnessed in January surpassed that of the preceding three months.\n\nThe upward trend peaked on 13th January, reaching over 76 million, marking the highest point in months. As of this writing, the volume was around 44 million.\n\nNotably, Sui\u2019s Total Value Locked (TVL), despite a recent dip from around $344 million to $322 million, remained at its historically highest level.\n\nConversely, Solana has experienced a shift in volume trends. While the network\u2019s volume increased towards the end of the year, it has witnessed a recent decline. Presently, the volume is over $740 million, reflecting a decrease but still outpacing Sui\u2019s volume.\n\nSOL and SUI post different price trends\n\nAnalyzing the daily price trend of Sui showed an uptrend that peaked around 15th January, reaching around $1.3 with a notable 9% increase.\n\nDuring this rise, the price entered the overbought zone, as evidenced by the Relative Strength Index (RSI). After this peak, the price experienced declines, causing the RSI to dip below 60.\n\nAt present, the price has decreased by nearly 5%, trading at around $1.1.\n\nRead Solana (SOL) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nIn contrast, Solana has dipped below the neutral line on its RSI, reflecting a decline in the price over the past three days.\n\nAs of this writing, SOL was trading at around $92, marking a decrease of over 1% in its price."

Hence, the continued uptick in staking deposits acted as a major catalyst towards making ETH elusive for trading.\n\nMoreover, with more ETH getting locked up, the volatility was bound to drop eventually. This could pave way for steadier prices in the future, akin to a store of value.\n\nOn-chain analyst Leon Waidmann observed these developments and said,\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re witnessing an ETH scarcity like never before, eclipsing all past Bullrun! Eventually, this supply squeeze will lead to a massive price explosion.\u201d\n\nIs your portfolio green?

        "title": "What Are Parallelized EVMs? A Beginner's Guide - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Parallelized Ethereum Virtual Machines (PEVMs) enhance blockchain scalability and efficiency, allowing multiple transactions to be executed at the same time rather than sequentially.\n\nThe blockchain landscape is constantly evolving to overcome limitations and unlock new possibilities. One of the latest innovations to address scalability within the Ethereum ecosystem is Parallelized Ethereum Virtual Machines (PEVMs).\n\nRead on to learn about parallelized EVMs and the potential impact of parallelization on Ethereum\u2019s scalability.\n\nWhat Are Parallelized EVMs?\n\nTo understand parallelized EVMs, let\u2019s first grasp the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nThe EVM allows for the execution of smart contracts on the Ethereum Network. It provides the infrastructure vital to all transactions happening on the blockchain. The growing adoption of Ether and other Ethereum-based tokens strains the EVM, leading to calls for its scaling.\n\nOne intervention that\u2019s gaining traction is parallelized EVMs.\n\nParallelized Ethereum Virtual Machines (PEVMs) enhance blockchain scalability and efficiency by allowing multiple transactions to be executed simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\nImagine them as supercharged versions of their predecessor capable of handling multiple transactions together. This approach is crucial in tackling the blockchain trilemma as it significantly reduces latency, boosting transaction throughput.\n\nSome of the front runners in the PEVM adoption are the Sei network, Neon, and Monad. The Sei Network went live in August 2023, attracting roughly 29,000 active users. Neon is also active and working on integrating Ethereum decentralized applications (dApps) into the Solana ecosystem. Meanwhile, Monard is yet to launch despite being production-ready.\n\nHow Do Parallelized EVMs Work?\n\nPEVMs leverage the power of parallel processing to achieve timely and scalable transactions.\n\nUnlike the typical EVMs that handle transactions back-to-back, PEVMs split transactions into smaller, independent tasks that can be tackled simultaneously. This means setting up different points for the concurrent handling of multiple trades.\n\nThere are many approaches to parallel processing, but two popular ones stand out:\n\nSharding : Imagine dividing the Ethereum blockchain into smaller, self-contained shards, each with its own EVM. Transactions are then distributed across these shards, allowing for independent and simultaneous processing.\n\nRollups: These batch transactions off the main Ethereum chain, processing them on a separate layer, and then re-submitting them to the mainnet for verification. This significantly reduces the burden on the main Ethereum network, leading to faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nThe Potential Impact of Parallelized EVMs on Ethereum\n\nPEVMs can significantly reduce transaction times and fees by removing network bottlenecks, making Ethereum more user-friendly and accessible to developers and users alike.\n\nWith PEVMs paving the way for faster and cheaper transactions, Ethereum can potentially handle a much larger volume of activity. This opens the door to widespread adoption of dApps and DeFi, bringing the power of blockchain to a broader audience.\n\nThe increased processing power of PEVMs could unleash a wave of more complex and resource-intensive dApps, pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible on Ethereum. Applications that might have previously been impractical on the blockchain could become feasible.\n\nAdditionally, making improvements on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet could significantly impact other Ethereum layers. L2 scaling solutions could gain more attention, leading to further development and adoption among users.\n\nPEVMs, however, also present a possible downside. The technical complexity required to implement parallelized EVMs might lead to centralization if only a few big players can implement it. They could also present backward compatibility and transition challenges to existing smart contracts.\n\nBenefits and Drawbacks of Parallelized EVMs\n\nPEVMs could hold so much promise for crypto enthusiasts. But like any technology, it could have its drawbacks too.\n\nPros\n\nReduced transaction latency: Devolving transaction handling to many units hastens their confirmation. Users will no longer have to endure lengthy completion times due to network clogging.\n\nLower transaction fees: PEVMs streamline transactions, eliminating the need to pay more for prioritized exchanges, which makes transaction fees more affordable.\n\nEnhanced Interoperability: PEVM projects such as Neon are working on bringing Ethereum dApps to Solana. Such initiatives will make it easy for users to interact with their peers on different networks without migrating to their platforms.\n\nCons\n\nIncreased complexity: Implementing and maintaining robust PEVMs can be technically demanding. As such, developers and users may face a steep learning curve.\n\nPotential security risks: Parallel processing introduces new synchronization and coordination challenges, increasing the likelihood of bugs and errors with improper implementation\n\nFinal Word\n\nParallelized EVMs are the latest attempt at achieving Ethereum scalability. By introducing parallel processing capabilities, PEVMs open the doors to various applications, from real-time financial transactions to seamless cross-chain exchanges. However, these novel projects require meticulous development and rigorous security edits to ensure stability."

        "content": "Ethereum continues to be the number one blockchain among crypto developers, with more than 70% of new contract codes first deployed on the network, according to the latest report by Electric Capital.\n\nAlso, there has been a spread in the distribution of developers globally, with more crypto devs living outside North America, as opposed to steady growth recorded in regions such as Latin America and Western Africa.\n\nMore Devs Involved in Multi-Chains\n\nElectric Capital\u2019s 2023 Crypto Developer Report revealed that most of the smart contract code launched on the Ethereum network is unique, while 71% of contracts are first deployed on Ethereum, making it the top blockchain choice for developers.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of multi-chain developers expanded in 2023. Based on the report, multi-chain developers grew from three percent in 2015 to 34% in 2023, signaling a growth of over 10x in eight years.\n\nIt is also no surprise to see the cross-pollination of developers across Ethereum and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchains. Such blockchains include BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, and several layer 2 networks. These chains all use the same smart contract logic as Ethereum.\n\nAccording to Electric Capital, cross-pollination occurs between BNB Chain, Polygon, and Ethereum, with all three chains sharing \u201cat least 30% of their multi-chain deployers with each other.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, BNB shares the largest number of multi-chain devs, with Ethereum at 39%, followed by Polygon at 36% and Arbitrum at 24%, while Avalanche is the lowest at 18%.\n\n40% of Developers Worked on Ethereum and Bitcoin in 2023\n\nIn all, a fourth of all blockchain developers deploy either on Ethereum or Bitcoin, with the latter accounting for a larger number of monthly active developers at 7,864 as of December 2023, which was, however, a 25% drop from over 10,400 the previous year,\n\nBitcoin, meanwhile, recorded 1,071 monthly active developers, declining 19% from 1,322 in December 2022. Most of the decline came from part-time developers and those working on multi-chains, with the report noting that developers who focused solely on Bitcoin were likely to continue working on the network.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 1000 developers have supported Bitcoin since 2017. The highest number of new developers joined the network in 2022, at over 2,700.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin transaction volumes skyrocketed in 2023 following the resurgence of Ordinals, only three percent of all Bitcoin developers worked on the project, while 40% were dedicated to Bitcoin layer 2 networks and other scaling solutions.\n\nApart from Bitcoin and Ethereum, there were also over 9,300 monthly active developers working on the top 200 crypto ecosystems by market capitalization as of December 2023. The figure, however, is a 31% reduction from 2022 records.\n\nTotal Number of Blockchain Devs Fell By Almost a Quarter in 2023\n\nAs noted on Electric Capital\u2019s report, monthly active developers dropped 24% to 22,411 in 2023, from 29,611 the previous year, with newcomers less than one year in crypto contributing to a majority of the losses.\n\nMost of these developers with the least tenured experience came into the industry during the bull market and tended to leave during the bear market. The number of newcomers peaked in 2022 at over 90,000 after Bitcoin\u2019s value rose to more than $69,000 and the total market capitalization at nearly $3 trillion in November 2021\n\n\u201cNewcomers who joined in 2022 are the ones who churned and are driving the overall -24% developer loss.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, those who have been in crypto for at least over a year continue to grow and contribute to the ecosystem, with 75% of codes by such developers.\n\nBlockchain developers with more than one year of experience in the industry grew 16% in 2023, while their established colleagues \u2014 people over two years in crypto \u2014 grew 52% in the last five years, reaching an all-time high.\n\nThe report also touched on developer distribution globally, stating that 74% are located outside of North America, while the US lost 14% of its developer share since 2018, controlling only 26% in 2023.\n\nBlockchain developers, however, are growing in Latin America, Western Africa, South Asia, Southern Europe, and Eastern Europe, increasing by 20% since 2018."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nFollowing a model established by Ethereum, modern blockchains can run a variety of applications.\n\nHowever, various user groups have developed preferences for different blockchains, based on their relative merits.\n\nBlockchain specialization runs counter to the generalized logic first proposed by Ethereum.\n\nInspired by Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized design, yet frustrated with its lack of programmability, Vitalik Buterin designed Ethereum as a general-purpose smart contract platform that could support complex software applications. Later generations of blockchain have largely followed Ethereum\u2019s model. In theory, each of these Turing-complete platforms can execute any computation a user requires, as long as they have sufficient gas money. Nevertheless, the universe of blockchains that exist today can be differentiated by their strengths.\n\nOf course, Ethereum remains a powerful force in Web3. But a countercurrent to its generalist logic can also be observed in the distinct specialization of various crypto tribes: communities of Solana, Tron, BNB and Polygon users who have each carved out a niche for their favored blockchain.\n\nThe Rise of DeFi on Solana\n\nAlthough Ethereum\u2019s Uniswap protocol is usually credited with ushering in the revolution in Decentralized Finance, these days, most DeFi trading activity has migrated away from the Layer 1 Ethereum network to more efficient platforms with lower gas fees.\n\nFor example, since Uniswap V3 branched out to sidechains and Layer 2s, the protocol\u2019s Arbitrum and Polygon deployments have typically generated 3 to 5 times higher trading volumes than its Layer 1 instance. Meanwhile, alternative ecosystems now host an array of new DeFi platforms that have forged ahead on their own.\n\nAs we go deep into Jupuary, we would like to acknowledge everyone who's making it possible. Additional shoutout to @jito_sol for the excellent airdrop lib we are building on top of and @Austin_Federa for being super proactive and pulling together everyone needed from labs! https://t.co/Ktrsz4VKJf \u2014 Jupiter \ud83e\ude90 (@JupiterExchange) January 17, 2024\n\nWhile BNB was the first independent blockchain to challenge Ethereum\u2019s status as the most popular DeFi venue, the breakout success of 2023 was Solana. In the last 30 days, the platform\u2019s top 3 DeFi services \u2013 Jupiter, Raydium and marginfin \u2013 attracted a combined total of 1.5 million users, surpassing the most popular BNB and Ethereum DeXs.\n\nSince mid-December, Solana\u2019s burgeoning DeFi ecosystem has been boosted by surging interest in SPL meme coins like Bonk.\n\nTron Takes the Stablecoin Crown\n\nMirroring the trend set by DeFi users, stablecoin activity has also relocated in recent times, with Tron being the most notable beneficiary of the flight from Ethereum.\n\nIn the last 3 years, Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin transaction count has fallen by around 20%, while Tron\u2019s surged by 600% in the same period.\n\nMoreover, where a strong lead in trading volume balances Ethereum\u2019s dwindling DeFi user base, the same can\u2019t be said for stablecoin activity. Not only does Tron beat Ethereum\u2019s transfer count, but it also comes close to matching its overall transaction volume.\n\nCongratulations on USDT on #TRON 's circulation exceeding $50 billion for the first time. Everyone in the TRON community has made a huge contribution to this achievement. The goal of issuing $100 billion on TRON stablecoins will be achieved soon! @paoloardoino @Tether_to pic.twitter.com/X7d3zm4EAE \u2014 H.E. Justin Sun \u5b59\u5b87\u6668 (@justinsuntron) January 13, 2024\n\nThe majority of Tron\u2019s stablecoin volumes stem from USDT transactions, which accounted for over 98% of the $366 billion sent over the network in the last year. On January 15, USDT circulating on Tron exceeded $50 billion for the first time, representing over half of the stablecoin\u2019s total supply.\n\nWAX: The Chain of Choice for Low-Cost NFTs\n\nWhen judged by purely financial metrics, Ethereum is by far the most dominant NFT chain, accounting for over 80% of the total market. But just as Ethereum\u2019s high gas fees have driven DeFi and stablecoin users elsewhere, they have also limited its viability for many NFT use cases.\n\nLaunched in 2017, WAX was specifically designed to make NFTs more affordable. Unlike many blockchains, minting new tokens on WAX costs just a few cents, and transferring NFTs between wallets doesn\u2019t incur transaction fees.\n\n\ud83c\udf7bHappy Friday, #WAXFAM ! Let's celebrate incredible #WAXNFT creators, from talented #artists to innovative #game developers & inspiring community leaders. Who inspires you on WAX? Tag your favorite creator & share your $WAXP wallet address below \u23ec pic.twitter.com/iux0iwZlQh \u2014 WAX (@WAX_io) January 12, 2024\n\nThanks to its fee-free transactions, when ranked by total cumulative sales, WAX hosts 8 of the 20 most popular NFT collections, more than any other blockchain.\n\nThe platform is especially prominent in the blockchain gaming space. After Axie Infinity, which runs on the Ethereum sidechain Ronin, WAX-based Alien Worlds is the most popular NFT game. Since its launch in 2020, around 920,000 Alien Worlds users have generated over 7 million sales.\n\nThe Diverse Ecosystem of BNB DApps\n\nAs the first blockchain built for decentralized applications (DApps), Ethereum\u2019s enduring popularity is maintained by a sizable network effect. According to DAppRadar , there are now more than 4,000 Ethereum-based DApps, but the platform has been knocked from the top spot by BNB chain, which hosts over 5,000\n\nBecause it was created to provide an Ethereum-like development experience, BNB\u2019s DApp ecosystem can draw from a well-established pool of Solidity developers and is home to an array of applications.\n\nOriginally created by Binance to facilitate cryptocurrency trading, the first generation of BNB DApps skewed toward DeFi, but the ecosystem has since evolved into one of the most diverse.\n\nOften incubated by Binance Launchpad, BNB DApps are a hotbed of Web3 innovation. For example, in recent weeks the AI-powered relationship simulator SleeplessAI has emerged as the most popular BNB-based application, amassing over 3 million users since its launch earlier this month.\n\nJoining SleeplessAI at the intersection of blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI), the crypto-focused knowledge-sharing platform QnA3 has also gained significant traction since its launch in December 2023."

        "content": "Ethereum price prediction: ETH has been on a remarkable upward trajectory within an ascending parallel channel since October 2023. The Ethereum price has recently achieved a significant milestone, touching a value of $2,467. This marks a subtle yet noteworthy 2.78% increase in just 24 hours, reflecting a market sentiment. The trading volume has also surged, reaching $6.7 million in the same period. With a robust market capitalization of $295 billion, ranked as the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nThe digital currency experienced a peak at $2,717 on January 12. Over the past week, it has consistently traded above the $2,400 resistance level, indicating a strong positive trend. Ethereum\u2019s value has shown fluctuations within a specific range, depicting a balance of strength and uncertainty. Observing these trends, Crypto analysts suggest a bullish short-term outlook, fostering a sense of optimism about Ethereum\u2019s prospects.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Cryptocurrency has recently been oscillating between $2,100 and $2,400, with bears and bulls exerting influence over the past week. Ethereum has witnessed a significant 54% increase over the past year, demonstrating resilience and an enduring bullish sentiment despite occasional dips. Moreover, in the last month alone, Ethereum has seen an impressive rally, surging by over 10%.\n\nTechnical Indicators Bolstering ETH Bullish Outlook\n\nCrypto analyst Tony highlights the critical $2,400 level for Ethereum, suggesting its breach could signal further growth. He predicts a potential rise above $2,500 soon. Despite market fluctuations, Ethereum shows remarkable on-chart resilience. Currently approaching the key resistance zone, this movement might lead to a significant breakout, continuing its upward trend.\n\n$ETH / $USD \u2013 Update Important level to hold here at $2,400 legends. Keep an eye on this and make a note of it pic.twitter.com/TK750wv4Up \u2014 Crypto Tony (@CryptoTony__) January 19, 2024\n\nIf Ethereum breaks out of its current range, the next target could be the channel\u2019s upper resistance trend line at around $2,700. If the bullish momentum continues, there\u2019s a possibility that Ethereum could reach as high as $3,000 in the short term. However, it\u2019s crucial to note that a fall below the wedge\u2019s support line, particularly at $2,410, could lead to a decline toward the channel\u2019s lower support trend line, currently at $2,300.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers near the 53 level, indicating a relatively balanced market momentum. Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory on a daily chart shows an upward trend, especially after breaking above its 200 Moving Average (MA) and exiting a key descending channel. This bullish trend is further evidenced by three consecutive four-hour green candlesticks, showcasing positive market sentiment.\n\nAdditionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line crossing above the signal line further supports a bullish outlook. A rising histogram complements this. The upward trajectory of the 20 Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the 50-day SMA crossing above the 200-day SMA reinforces the bullish sentiment. Furthermore, the Chaikin Money Flow indicator, currently at 0.10, is in positive territory, suggesting a bullish market outlook for Ethereum.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "The broader digital currency ecosystem remains on edge as market bulls fight to prop up Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) prices amid Grayscale\u2019s $2.2 billion GBTC outflows and conflicting Options data.\n\nIs Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) Bottom In?\n\nAt the time of writing, the duo of Bitcoin and Ethereum brandishes slightly conflicting price outlooks with the former growing by 0.58% to $41,784.51 and the latter slipping by 0.48% to $2,467.64. Despite this relatively stable price outlook, the conversations around potential price bottom settling are invalidated by Deribit Options data.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAccording to Insights from the platform, the GBTC-ETF wargames triggered a massive spike in Implied Volatility (IV) of Ethereum which dropped from 64% to 47% for the week using the Deribit Volatility (DVOL) proxy. Bitcoin also recorded a shrunken volatility featuring a drop from 55% to 47%, a trend powered by Call selling.\n\nThe implications of the IV for both Bitcoin and Ethereum differ slightly. Notably, the steep drop in Ethereum came with massive selling trades recorded for the coin as some traders not only gave up on Longs with other traders but also overwriting ETH Spot AUM.\n\nPer the data presented, a total of 2,700 Calls sold about 45,000 ETH, and in March 2,900 Calls sold 28,000 ETH. This sustained selloff underscores the likelihood of a further drop in Ethereum shortly. Bitcoin on the other hand is witnessing intense accumulation as traders are leveraging the slump in prices to stack up the coin.\n\n2) The most impactful IV selling trades originated on ETH, predominantly Call selling, some giving up on Longs, and some overwriting ETH Spot AUM.\n\nFeb 2.7k Calls sold 45k\n\nMar 2.9k Calls sold 28k\n\nJan 2.6k covered to sell Apr 2.9k Calls 25k\n\nSignificant other Call 2way in Feb Calls. pic.twitter.com/8XU3djFRVV \u2014 Deribit Insights (@DeribitInsights) January 20, 2024\n\nWith this outlook, Ethereum\u2019s bottom might be far from being set while Bitcoin\u2019s drawdown might be clearing with the current accumulations.\n\nGrayscale Shaping Market Sentiment\n\nWith the approval and launch of the spot Bitcoin ETF being the most important update from the US stock market, the dumping of Grayscale\u2019s GBTC has shifted the longevity of Bitcoin in investors\u2019 portfolios.\n\nData from the crypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock pegged the average time held of coins transacted to 9 months. For this timeframe, a total of 371,930 BTC was transacted with the average price pegged at $42,663.24.\n\nWhile Grayscale\u2019s influence is still dominant as one of the largest Bitcoin holders among the spot ETF issuers, the BTC holding timeline may shrink further as the firm\u2019s 1.5% fee might serve as a discouragement for its existing holders to move their coins to other funds. If this selloff trend continues to play out, the spot and Options market volatility may continue for the rest of the month and price will also reflect this trend."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction as QQQ and SPY ETFs Hits Record - Bankless Times",
        "content": "Ethereum price has pulled back in the past few days as sentiment in the crypto industry has waned a bit. After peaking at $2,717 on January 12th, the coin has moved into a correction, falling by over 10%. It has dropped to its lowest point since January 10th.\n\nRisk-on sentiment\n\nEthereum, Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrency prices have plunged in the past few days as investors sell the spot Bitcoin ETF news. This is a common occurrence where an asset rallies ahead of a major event and then pulls back after it happens. It happens because the news event, in this ETF approval, was already baked in the market.\n\nStill, there are a few potential catalysts that could push Ethereum price higher soon. First, investors are embracing a risk-on sentiment as evidenced by the performance of the stock market. Last Friday, Invesco QQQ (QQQ), which tracks the Nasdaq 100 index and the SPDR S&P 500 index (SPY) jumped to a record high.\n\nThese indices jumped as the earnings season continued last week. Some of the notable companies that released their results last week were Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and some regional banks. The earnings season will continue this week as companies like P&G, Tesla, and Netflix publish their results.\n\nThe surge in America\u2019s equities is a sign that investors have embraced a risk-on sentiment, which is a positive thing for stocks and cryptocurrencies. In most periods, these coins tend to rally when there is this sentiment as we saw during the 2021 rally.\n\nThe other catalyst for Ethereum is that some companies like Blackrock have applied for a spot Ethereum ETF. That ETF will track the price of Ethereum and make it easier for institutional investors to invest.\n\nHowever, it is not clear whether the SEC will approve the ETF because of Ethereum\u2019s staking features, which it introduced in 2022. Staking allows people to earn a return by just holding the tokens, something the SEC sees as problematic since Ethereum is not regulated.\n\nEthereum price forecast\n\nThe daily chart shows that the ETH price has pulled back sharply in the past few days, pushing it into a correction. It has retested the key support at $2,450, the highest swing on December 28th. At the same time, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Stochastic Oscillator have retreated to their neutral point.\n\nEthereum remains above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), a bullish sign. Therefore, the outlook for ETH price is mildly bullish, with the next point to watch being at $2,700. This price is about 12% above the current level."

So what are the lessons learned?\n\nEveryone wants to make money and everyone wants to make a lot of it. Cryptocurrency has emerged as an option to reap significant rewards, as well as an opportunity to take part in a different type of financial world. One of the most commonly Googled phrases is \u2018How to Make Money With Crypto\u2019. So we compiled a few of the most important lessons learnt on how to do this safely and effectively. Let\u2019s get started.\n\nLesson 1: Ethereum & The Importance of Multifaceted Uses\n\nEthereum\u2019s success in the cryptocurrency market teaches the importance of investing in platforms with multifaceted uses beyond just currency. Its combination of digital currency, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (dApps) creates a dynamic ecosystem that drives demand and increases its value. Investors in Ethereum benefit not only from its rising value but also from the ecosystem\u2019s growth.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s shift to a proof-of-stake model introduces opportunities for earning passive income through staking. This highlights that cryptocurrencies with innovative technologies and multiple applications can offer varied and potentially more stable investment opportunities.\n\n$SCORP Presale In Its Final Stage!\n\nLesson 2: Scorpion Casino & The Importance Of Innovation Alongside Tangible Rewards\n\nScorpion Casino\u2019s Presale has illustrated a key lesson in cryptocurrency investment: the value of innovation and tangible rewards.

        "title": "Ethereum Fork PulseChain Records TVL Surge - CoinGape",
        "content": "PulseChain, an Ethereum fork, has surpassed the Total Value Locked (TVL) of $403 million. The growth has positioned it as the 11th largest in terms of TVL, according to DefiLlama.\n\nPulseChain houses 34 protocols and has seen a TVL increase of 110% over the past week.\n\nadvertisement\n\nPulseX is the largest protocol on PulseChain. It is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that contributes a TVL of $234.45 million to the chain. As an Ethereum competitor that was born to solve the scalability issue on the OG blockchain, it is still behind.\n\nPulseChain is 0.71% of total TVL\n\nIn terms of total dollars locked, PulseChain accounts for only 0.71% of the market, while Ethereum dominates at over 57%.\n\nHowever, its recent rise is noteworthy. This surge in TVL began post-January 8, when it was just over $128 million. At the same time, the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETF was just around the corner. The US SEC approved the much-awaited ETP on January 10, pushing liquidity into the market.\n\nThis contributed to the rise in the chain as well, with the TVL hitting $209 million by January 14 and soaring to $496.5 million by January 19. In the process, the conversation around Ethereum ETFs has also been adding optimism to the chain. In December, GoPulse said in a statement that it has unleashed interoperability by allowing trading between Pulse and Ethereum.\n\nPulseChain launched in May last year and has been operational for eight months. Meanwhile, PulseX enables users to exchange tokens on the blockchain in a decentralized setup. It is somewhat akin to Uniswap on Ethereum.\n\nPulseChain comes wrapped in controversies\n\nRichard Heart, the founder of HEX and developer of PulseChain and PulseX, said in a recent post on X that there are benefits of integrating major stablecoins like $DAI, $USDC, and $USDT directly on PulseChain. According to him, this could enhance security and reduce costs.\n\nIf you got $DAI, $USDC & $USDT to have their stable coins directly on PulseChain, as they do on other networks, it would increase security and reduce costs. PulseChain is nearly the most decentralized and secure L1 in the world. PulseChain has operated flawlessly since launch\u2026 pic.twitter.com/xVWRuWkfjn \u2014 Richard Heart (@RichardHeartWin) January 20, 2024\n\nDeFi analyst @goldk3y_ underlined the growth of PulseChain, citing over 700,000 active wallets. He is betting on PulseChain\u2019s growth, stating, \u201cThere is currently $112M bridged to PulseChain. Up +$42M in the past 7 days.\u201d\n\nHe highlighted that PulseChain boasts 100% uptime, low transaction costs, a growing developer community, and over 52,000 validators, making it a strong competitor in the space.\n\nThe Pulse Wallet noted on Saturday that DAI is increasingly moving from Ethereum to PulseChain. It has reportedly surpassed its previous high, which was achieved in June 2023. Although confidence in the chain is on the rise, it\u2019s not without setbacks.\n\nIn July last year, the SEC sued Heart for conducting an unregistered securities offering, targeting HEX, PulseChain, and PulseX.\n\nMeanwhile, the founder also has a reputation for boosting his project with massive claims. He was pulled up by not only the regulators but also the community for misrepresentation and making potentially fraudulent claims."

If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThe year 2024 is shaping up to be a landmark year in the world of cryptocurrencies, with Chat GPT making bold predictions for prominent players like Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH).However, the spotlight is increasingly shifting towards a rising star in the decentralized finance (DeFi) realm \u2013 Retik Finance (RETIK), which is showing potential to outperform its more established counterparts.\n\nSolana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH): Predictions and Prospects\n\nSolana\u2019s 2024 Trajectory\n\nSolana, known for its high-speed transactions and low fees, is poised for a significant recovery in 2024. Chat GPT predicts a resurgence in SOL\u2019s value, considering its technical robustness and growing adoption.Solana\u2019s ability to handle up to 65,000 transactions per second positions it as a preferred choice for DeFi and NFT projects. This advantage could drive SOL\u2019s price upwards, potentially reaching the $200 mark, a significant increase from its current standing.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Progressive Outlook\n\nEthereum, the leading smart contract platform, is expected to continue its dominance, especially with its upcoming Ethereum Cancun upgrade. This upgrade, anticipated to increase scalability and efficiency significantly, is likely to draw more users and developers to the platform, bolstering ETH\u2019s price. Chat GPT foresees Ethereum potentially breaking past its previous all-time high, with a price target hovering around $5,000 by the end of 2024.While Solana and Ethereum have their strengths, Retik Finance is emerging as a formidable contender in the DeFi space. Priced attractively at $0.08, Retik Finance is not just another token in the crypto market; it\u2019s a revolution in the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nRetik Finance (RETIK): A New Era in DeFi\n\nDespite the promising outlook for SOL and ETH, Retik Finance is emerging as a potential market leader, offering groundbreaking innovations in DeFi. Recently audited by Certik and listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, Retik Finance is gaining credibility and visibility in the crypto space.\n\nWhy Retik Finance Stands Out\n\nRetik Finance is revolutionising DeFi with its comprehensive suite of products, including DeFi debit cards, a next-gen payment gateway, AI-powered P2P lending, and a highly secure multi-chain DeFi wallet. These offerings are not just technological advancements but also practical solutions that address real-world financial challenges, bridging the gap between cryptocurrencies and everyday transactions.\n\nCertik Audit \u2013 A Testament to Security and Reliability\n\nThe Certik audit of Retik Finance underscores the platform\u2019s commitment to security and reliability. This audit provides an additional layer of trust and confidence for investors, ensuring that Retik Finance\u2019s smart contracts are robust and secure against potential vulnerabilities.\n\n2024: The Year of Retik Finance\n\nChat GPT\u2019s analysis suggests that 2024 could very well be the year of Retik Finance. With its innovative features and growing ecosystem, RETIK is projected to experience substantial growth, potentially outperforming both Solana and Ethereum.\n\nRobust Features and Market Appeal: Retik Finance\u2019s array of features, particularly its DeFi debit cards, are set to transform how people interact with cryptocurrencies. These cards will facilitate the widespread adoption of crypto in everyday transactions, a significant leap towards mainstream acceptance.\n\nAI-Powered Lending \u2013 A Game-Changer: The platform\u2019s introduction of AI-powered P2P lending is a significant innovation in the DeFi space. This feature is expected to attract a broad user base, offering a more accessible and efficient lending and borrowing mechanism.\n\nMarket Confidence and Adoption: Retik Finance\u2019s presence on prominent platforms like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, coupled with its Certik audit, is building market confidence. These factors contribute to a growing investor base eagerly anticipating the platform\u2019s full launch.\n\nBold Price Predictions for Retik Finance\n\nLooking at Retik Finance\u2019s trajectory and market potential, Chat GPT predicts a remarkable performance in 2024. The platform is expected to provide substantial returns for early investors, with a price prediction indicating a surge of over 900% from its current value. This growth is not just based on market speculation but also on the tangible utility and innovation Retik Finance brings to the DeFi landscape.\n\nConclusion: A Transformative Year Ahead\n\nAs 2024 unfolds, the cryptocurrency market is set for a transformative journey. While Solana and Ethereum are predicted to see significant growth, Retik Finance is poised to make a more substantial impact. With its innovative solutions, Certik audit, and listings on key crypto platforms, Retik Finance is not just another token in the crowded crypto space; it\u2019s a harbinger of change in DeFi. For investors and enthusiasts alike, Retik Finance represents an opportunity not just for substantial financial returns but also to be part of a revolution in decentralized finance.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance Presale\n\nVisit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):\n\nWebsite: https://retik.com\n\nWhitepaper: https://retik.com/retik-whitepaper.pdf\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/retikfinance"

        "content": "Shopping on the internet and using digital money are closely connected in the evolving world of online finance. Recognized currencies such as Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) are widely accepted, and a recently introduced digital currency called Pushd (PUSHD) has gained attention from informed investors.\n\nLet\u2019s explore the connection between online shopping and digital currency, explaining why Pushd\u2019s presale is gaining attention from Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiasts. We will analyze market trends, insights from influential figures, and the influence Pushd (PUSHD) is having in the decentralized marketplace.\n\nJoin us as we navigate the coming together of these dynamic fields, where opportunities for innovation are plentiful.\n\nEthereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) Market Overview\n\nSamson Mow, the Chief Executive Officer of Jan3 and a strong supporter of Bitcoin (BTC), subtly expresses concerns about other assets such as Silver and Ethereum (ETH), highlighting the superiority of Bitcoin.\n\nDespite continuous discussions, Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization exceeds that of Ethereum, and Mow refers to Ethereum as the \u201cless intelligent person\u2019s Bitcoin.\u201d BTC shows a positive signal known as a golden cross on the weekly chart, indicating potential long-term upward momentum.\n\nNevertheless, Bitcoin encounters a challenge in surpassing the $43,000 mark, and Santiment reports historically elevated risk levels for both Bitcoin and alternative coins.\n\nPushd (PUSHD) \u2013 Web3 Marketplace Revolutionizing E-commerce\n\nPushd (PUSHD) enters the scene as a decentralized web3 marketplace challenging traditional e-commerce giants like Amazon and eBay. Operating on the blockchain, Pushd connects global buyers and sellers, offering instant deposits, withdrawals, and a swap service.\n\nThe presale introduces Pushd (PUSHD) tokens with governance rights, allowing investors to propose platform changes. Pushd emphasizes transparency, decentralization, and cost-effectiveness, positioning itself as a first-mover in the evolving market.\n\nWith eternal locked liquidity, investors perceive Pushd (PUSHD) as a secure and promising opportunity for early investment.\n\nMarket Dynamics and Investor Considerations\n\nBitcoin (BTC) experiences selling pressure despite robust ETF inflows, with Santiment signaling high-risk profit levels. Ethereum\u2019s valuation debate continues, with Mow\u2019s analogy fueling discussions.\n\nPushd\u2019s entry into the decentralized marketplace aligns with the growing demand for transparent and user-friendly e-commerce solutions. Investors anticipate capitalizing on Pushd\u2019s potential to disrupt the e-commerce sector as the presale unfolds.\n\nThe focus on blockchain, decentralization, and governance adds value to Pushd\u2019s appeal in a rapidly evolving crypto landscape.\n\nIn summary, the convergence of e-commerce and crypto gains momentum with Pushd\u2019s (PUSHD) presale, offering a unique approach to decentralized online marketplaces amidst broader market dynamics and debates surrounding leading cryptocurrencies.\n\nFind out more about the Pushd presale at their official website\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Grok AI picks 3 cryptocurrencies to invest in 2024 - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Grok, an artificial intelligence (AI) developed by xAI under Elon Musk\u2019s guidance, has quickly gained popularity on X (formerly Twitter) and in the crypto world. The model processes diverse data streams and has real-time analysis of X\u2019s user-generated content.\n\nPreviously, Grok made waves by choosing an ideal cryptocurrency for payments on X.\n\nIn the meantime, cryptocurrencies are getting ready for what could be a brewing bull market. Investors are managing their portfolios, looking for the best opportunities and value asymmetry to invest in 2024.\n\nFinbold turned to Grok, seeking valuable insights on three recommended cryptocurrencies for three different investment profiles. Particularly, we asked xAI\u2019s model to pick one cryptocurrency for a conservative, aggressive, and very aggressive investor.\n\nGrok picks Ethereum (ETH) for conservative investors\n\nFirst, Grok named Ethereum (ETH) as the ideal investment for a conservative cryptocurrency profile in 2024. The AI forecasts a fair value of $8,000 to $10,000 for ETH, which justifies its pick.\n\n\u201cEthereum is a well-established and widely adopted platform with strong fundamentals and a large developer community. The successful implementation of Ethereum 2.0 and the continued growth of DeFi and NFT projects on the Ethereum network could drive its value higher.\u201d \u2014 Grok, by xAI\n\nGrok picks Ethereum (ETH) for conservative investors. Source: Finbold\n\nElon Musk\u2019s AI names Polkadot (DOT) to invest in 2024\n\nMeanwhile, aggressive investors should look at Polkadot (DOT) and a price range of $200 to $300 in 2024.\n\n\u201cPolkadot is a promising interoperability platform that enables cross-chain communication and transactions. With its strong development team, growing ecosystem, and potential to become a critical infrastructure for the next generation of blockchain projects, it could see significant growth in the coming years.\u201d \u2014 Grok, by xAI\n\nGrok picks Polkadot (DOT) for aggressive investors. Source: Finbold\n\nChainlink (LINK) is for the very aggressive investors, according to Grok\n\nFinally, Grok names Chainlink (LINK) as the right pick for very aggressive speculators looking for higher risks. LINK is expected to reach the price range of $150 to $250 per token, according to the AI.\n\n\u201cChainlink is a decentralized oracle network that provides real-world data to smart contracts. As the demand for reliable off-chain data in DeFi and other blockchain applications continues to grow, Chainlink\u2019s adoption and value could increase significantly.\u201d \u2014 Grok, by xAI\n\nGrok picks Chainlink (LINK) for aggressive investors. Source: Finbold\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, three different types of investors could benefit from deploying capital to Ethereum, Polkadot, and Chainlink, according to Grok. Notably, each project focus on different use cases like Web3 infrastructure, cross-chain solutions, and real-world data oracles, respectively.\n\nNevertheless, Grok warned for the speculative nature of its predictions and that \u201cthe cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and unpredictable.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "In the bustling world of cryptocurrency, where the quest for the next big investment never ceases, three names have risen to prominence: Avalanche (AVAX), Ethereum Classic (ETC), and Scorpion Casino (SCORP). Each of these digital assets offers unique avenues for growth and profitability. But which one holds the key to unlocking 10x returns in February? Let\u2019s dive deep into the characteristics and potential of these three crypto giants.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) \u2013 The Speedster of Blockchain\n\nAvalanche stands out for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and low fees, a refreshing change in a world where network congestion and high costs often dampen the crypto experience. Its unique consensus mechanism and multiple subnets provide a flexible and scalable platform, attracting a growing number of developers and projects. Avalanche\u2019s platform facilitates diverse applications ranging from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), making it a versatile player in the crypto space.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) \u2013 The Undying Legacy\n\nEthereum Classic, the original Ethereum blockchain, remains true to the original ethos of the Ethereum project, prioritizing immutability and resistance to censorship. Its commitment to the original Ethereum codebase and philosophy attracts purists and those disillusioned with the frequent updates and changes in its successor, Ethereum (ETH). Despite being overshadowed by Ethereum, ETC has maintained a loyal community and continues to receive updates and improvements, ensuring its relevance in the ever-evolving crypto landscape.\n\nScorpion Casino (SCORP) \u2013 The Future of Crypto Gaming\n\nScorpion Casino is not just a digital asset; it\u2019s an entry into the lucrative world of online gaming. With blockchain technology at its core, SCORP ensures transparency and security in online gambling. The casino\u2019s unique tokenomics, including buy-backs and burns, enhance the staking experience. Its revenue-sharing system is insulated from the typical volatility of the crypto market. With a platform offering everything from sportsbooks to classic roulette, Scorpion Casino provides a diverse and engaging gaming experience.\n\nThe project\u2019s recent milestones, including a successful V2 launch and notable partnerships, underscore its growth potential. A key feature of SCORP is the ability for investors to withdraw their daily USDT rewards during the presale period, providing immediate financial benefits\n\nWho Will Come Out On Top\n\nIn comparing Avalanche, Ethereum Classic, and Scorpion Casino, each presents compelling reasons for investment. While AVAX and ETC offer technological innovation and a strong heritage in the blockchain space, Scorpion Casino emerges as the standout choice for those seeking a blend of entertainment, profitability, and stability. Its unique approach to online gaming, coupled with a robust tokenomics system, positions it as a golden goose for those in search of passive income. As we edge closer to the conclusion of SCORP\u2019s presale, this is a prime opportunity to invest in a project poised for explosive growth.\n\nJoin in on the Scorpion Casino Presale While You Still Can!\n\nPresale: https://presale.scorpion.casino/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ScorpionCasino\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/scorpioncasino_official\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the crypto market enters 2024, Ethereum (ETH) and Stellar (XLM) are experiencing mixed trends,\n\nInQubeta (QUBE), an innovative AI cryptocurrency ICO, is gaining momentum in January, 2024.\n\nSupporters of InQubeta (QUBE) can take part in pre-sale and buy tokens here.\n\nEthereum (ETH might be due to healthy correction\n\nEthereum, the second best cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has recently undergone a notable correction, retreating to key support levels. Despite this downturn, Ethereum has shown signs of resilience, indicating a potential resurgence from a lower level. Technical indicators paint a mixed picture; the Hourly MACD reveals diminishing bullish momentum, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for ETH/USD hovers just above the equilibrium point of 50. This suggests a degree of hesitation in the market, reflecting the uncertainty and fluctuating investor sentiment.\n\nStellar (XLM) community remains strongly optimistic\n\nStarting 2024 on a bearish note, Stellar has struggled to maintain or boost its price since December. Investors who hoped for a positive change in price trajectory with the new year have been disappointed, as Stellar records a decline in price value.\n\nAdditionally, trading volumes for Stellar have been decreasing, contributing to the negative sentiment surrounding the token. Experts anticipate that Stellar may break out of its bearish form in the coming weeks, but the current trend indicates a period of challenge for this top altcoin.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE) pre-sale gains momentum\n\nInQubeta emerges as a beacon of positive momentum in the crypto space. This platform, powered by its QUBE token, is starting to turn heads in the investment world, especially among those keen on the growing intersection of AI and crypto. What makes InQubeta stand out is how it's making it simpler for everyday investors to get into AI startups. With QUBE tokens, fractional investments are possible, opening up a field that was mostly played by the big guns.\n\nOn the InQubeta platform, AI startups have the opportunity to create popular NFTs that represent either rewards or a stake in their company. This offers investors a variety of direct ways to invest, which is pretty exciting. It's a win-win: startups get the funding they need, and investors have the chance to benefit from the success of these innovative AI ventures.\n\nThe QUBE token is at the heart of all this. It's a deflationary ERC20 coin, and it's got a unique approach where each transaction gets a 2% tax that goes to a burn wallet. Plus, there's a 5% tax that's set aside as a reward for those holding their coins.\n\nInQubeta, a new ICO, is tapping into what's hot right now: investments in AI startups. If we take a leaf out of crypto history, QUBE, InQubeta's token, could be gearing up to be a major player in the next bull run. It's this kind of potential and excitement that keeps the crypto arena interesting and full of surprises.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities"

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nCryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors alike are turning their attention to Retik Finance, a rising star in the decentralized finance (DeFi) arena. Priced at a modest $0.08, Retik Finance is emerging as a formidable competitor to Ethereum, with ambitious predictions pointing toward a significant surge to $26 in 2024. Let's delve into the unique features, strategic initiatives, and market dynamics that position Retik Finance as a compelling Ethereum alternative with the potential for substantial growth.\n\nEthereum Competitor Retik Finance (RETIK)\n\nRetik Finance distinguishes itself by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its DeFi ecosystem, setting it apart from traditional players. The platform offers a range of innovative features, including Futuristic DeFi Debit Cards, Smart Crypto Payment Gateways, and AI-Powered Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending. This unique combination of cutting-edge technology aims to redefine the landscape of decentralized finance, offering users advanced functionalities and a forward-looking approach. Retik Finance's journey to prominence has been marked by impressive fundraising achievements. The project not only secured an exceptional $1 million within a brief nine-day span but has continued to soar, accumulating nearly $6 million in less than a month. The presale structure, featuring ten stages with incremental pricing, has been a key contributor to Retik Finance's financial milestones, currently surpassing $11 million. Beyond the numbers, Retik Finance actively engages its community through a mega $333,000 giveaway, fostering a sense of inclusivity and support. Priced at a modest $0.08, Retik Finance presents an attractive entry point for investors seeking promising projects with substantial growth potential. As Ethereum faces scalability challenges and increased gas fees, Retik Finance positions itself as a viable alternative, leveraging its AI-driven approach and strategic features to offer a more efficient and cost-effective DeFi experience. The projected surge to $26 in 2024 suggests that Retik Finance is not only gaining attention and also garnering confidence in its ability to deliver on its ambitious goals.\n\nFactors Fueling Retik Finance's Projected Growth\n\nRetik Finance's ascent in the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape is fueled by several strategic pillars. First and foremost, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) across its offerings sets Retik Finance apart, bringing forth heightened efficiency, bolstered security measures, and an enhanced user experience. This commitment to cutting-edge technology positions the project with a distinct advantage, as it seeks to redefine the DeFi space. In tandem with its technological prowess, Retik Finance thrives on the strength of its community engagement initiatives. A vibrant and supportive user community has been instrumental in the project's success. Notably, ongoing initiatives such as the mega giveaway contribute to fostering a positive and inclusive ecosystem, where community members actively participate in the project's growth and development. The strategic listings of Retik Finance on major platforms such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko form another crucial component of its growth strategy. These listings not only provide transparency but also instill trust and accessibility for a broader audience. By ensuring visibility on these widely recognized platforms, Retik Finance opens avenues for users and potential investors to access real-time information, token metrics, and community-related details, contributing to sustained growth and credibility. Moreover, Retik Finance has undergone a rigorous and comprehensive audit conducted by Certik, a reputable blockchain security firm. The successful completion of this audit not only underscores Retik Finance's commitment to robust security measures and also instills confidence in users and potential investors. The Certik audit serves as a stamp of approval, assuring users that Retik Finance's smart contracts have undergone meticulous scrutiny, minimizing vulnerabilities and reinforcing the platform's reliability in the rapidly evolving DeFi space.\n\nChallenges and Risks on the Horizon\n\nWhile Retik Finance's trajectory appears promising, it's essential to acknowledge potential challenges and risks that could impact its journey. These may include market volatility, regulatory developments, and competition within the ever-evolving DeFi landscape. Navigating these challenges with resilience and adaptability will be crucial for Retik Finance's sustained success. As Retik Finance continues to carve its niche as an Ethereum competitor, its unique features, strategic initiatives, and community-centric approach position it as a project to watch in 2024. The projected price surge to $26 reflects the growing recognition of Retik Finance's potential to redefine decentralized finance. As investors seek alternatives to established players, Retik Finance's journey from a modest $0.08 to a projected $26 underscores the dynamic and transformative nature of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAbout Retik Finance\n\nRetik Finance (RETIK) is a cutting-edge decentralized finance (DeFi) project revolutionizing global transactions with its innovative suite of financial solutions.

This revolutionary method, enabled by Particle Network\u2019s full-chain solution, provides a simple interface and increased security.\n\nAccording to the report, the platform has over 120k on-chain addresses and about $3M gas consumption that have been caused by inscriptions which is a clear indication of strong early adoption.\n\nThe successful launch of ALLY Marketplace reflects an increasing trend towards account abstraction, a technology from which user participation within the blockchain infrastructure can be reinvented.\n\nALLY is positioned to create a long-term trend on the EVM in terms of its high trading volume and vibrant community"

He keeps a keen interest in blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize finance. Whether he's trading or writing, Sohrab always keeps his finger on the pulse of the crypto world, using his expertise to deliver informative and engaging articles that educate and inspire. When he's not analyzing the markets, Sohrab indulges in his hobbies of graphic design, minimal design or listening to his favorite hip-hop tunes.\n\nStory Highlights ETC price action shows a retest phase of a bullish breakout of the consolidation range in the weekly chart.\n\nThe range breakout ends the long-term lower-high formations and marks a trend reversal.\n\nAs per the Fibonacci levels in the weekly chart, the reversal trend can reach the $40 mark.\n\nFollowing the impressive recovery of 37% last week, the ETC price shows a minor pullback this week. With a 6.47% decline, the minor pullback humbles the Ethereum Classic buyers and retests the breakout level.\n\nWith the weekly chart signaling an overall trend reversal spark getting brighter in the ETC price trend, the retest comes as an entry spot. Moreover, our ETC price prediction aligns with the trend reversal possibility as we expect a bull run for Ethereum Classic in 2024.\n\nSource \u2013 Tradingview\n\nETC Price Prepares A Takeoff Beyond $30\n\nIn the daily chart, the recent correction marks a quick retest of the 50-day EMA and the 38.20% Fibonacci level. However, the increased demand at lower levels pushes the Ethereum Classic price higher back with a long-tail bullish candle.\n\nFurther, an uptick in the trading volume supports the idea of a bullish comeback to conclude the ongoing retest. Currently, the ETC price trades at $24.82 and shows a 2.05% drop, resulting in a new bear candle, teasing a sideways shift above $24.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nStochastic RSI: The K and D lines in the stochastic RSI maintain a declining slope and approach the oversold boundary. Hence, a bounceback is possible as the lines may soon reverse from the oversold.\n\nEMA: In the daily chart, the 50-day EMA reflects a dynamic solid support ready to absorb overhead supply.\n\nWill Ethereum Classic Price Reach $40?\n\nFollowing the impressive reversal last night from the confluence of supports at $24, the Ethereum Classic sustains the uptrend. In addition, the weekly chart reflects a potential trend reversal with the range breakout.\n\nHence, the technical chart signals an entry opportunity for sideline traders in both weekly and daily charts.\n\nIf the buyers manage to lift the uptrend, the ETC price may break past $30 to reach $40 shortly. However, if ETC fails to maintain its momentum, it may break the $24 level to test the $20 mark."

        "content": "TLDR\n\nBNB experiences wild price swings in a week, but experts expect bulls to come soon.\n\nEthereum Classic surges 21% in a week, and analysts foresee more growth.\n\nRebel Satoshi continues attracting more investors after jumping 120% thus far.\n\nAs the crypto market continues to balance bears and bulls, top altcoins like BNB (BNB) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) have performed differently. As a result, investors are confused about which cryptocurrency to invest in. On the other hand, Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ), an emerging meme coin, has stolen the limelight after raising over $1.5 during its public presale.\n\nWhich is the best crypto to buy now, BNB, Ethereum Classic, or Rebel Satoshi? Let\u2019s find out!\n\nBNB Continues Experiencing Volatility: Will Bulls Take Over?\n\nBNB has performed modestly over the past seven days. On January 10, BNB was changing hands at around $294.13. However, the January 11 news of Binance announcing that BNB Chain had transitioned to BEP333 saw BNB climb 316.40 on the same day. Nonetheless, BNB failed to maintain these gains and plunged as low as $291 on January 13.\n\nThis sharp decline came after investors liquidated their BNB holdings after a report revealed the outflow of funds from Binance is worse than former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao indicated in December. Luckily, the news of HypeGPT and BNB Chain collaborating on January 15 saw BNB start climbing again.\n\nBy January 17, BNB had stabilized at around $311.26. This price means BNB has gained 5.82% in a week. So, is BNB a good crypto to buy now? Per experts, BNB will maintain its upward trajectory to close January at $387.42. Experts peg this prediction on BNB gaining more adoption after Binance burned 2,141,487.27 BNB on January 17.\n\nEthereum Classic Jumps 21% in a Week: What\u2019s Next?\n\nEthereum Classic has performed well over the past seven days. On January 10, BNB was changing hands at around $21.33. After the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF on January 10, ETC gained traction and peaked at $32.06 on January 12. However, ETC experienced a downward correction soon afterward.\n\nBy January 17, ETC had leveled off at around $25.91. This price means ETC has gained 21.47% in a week despite the retracement. Based on this bullish performance, is Ethereum Classic a top crypto to invest in? Let\u2019s see what experts have to say.\n\nPer analysts, ETC will continue its uptrend to close the month at $41.40. Analysts peg this prediction on ETC gaining more adoption as Ethereum Classic inches closer to the Spiral hard fork, which is slated for January 31.\n\nRebel Satoshi Nears Its Launch in February After Starting Monarchs Round 4!\n\nRebel Satoshi, an upcoming meme that seeks to push the crypto sector to a new era of decentralization, has caused a stir in the crypto market after completing the first four rounds of its presale. This achievement has made Rebel Satoshi the fastest-growing meme coin, attracting more investors.\n\nInvestors are buying $RBLZ, Rebel Satoshi\u2019s governance and membership token, because of its supply cap of 250 million coins, which is lower than most meme coins. Moreover, investors are buying $RBLZ because it is the key to accessing the Rebel Satoshi ecosystem, which features a staking program, a P2E game, and an NFT marketplace.\n\nAs of January, Rebel Satoshi was in Monarchs Round 4 of its ongoing presale. Investors can now use Bitcoin (BTC) and 50 other cryptos to buy $RBLZ at $0.022. This price means $RBLZ has jumped 120% from the Early Bird Round price of $0.010. This yield is set to increase to 150% when $RBLZ hits its listing price of $0.025.\n\nOn the other hand, Monarchs Round 4 investors will enjoy a 13.64% ROI when $RBLZ reaches $0.025. On top of this, experts predict $RBLZ will surge further when it gets listed on top decentralized exchanges in February. This prediction makes $RBLZ the best cryptocurrency to buy now!\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

As of the ongoing Retik Presale Stage 6, with a RETIK token priced at $0.080. The project has raised $10,925,698. Tokens sold amount to 192,013,934 out of the targeted 220,000,000. With 87.28% of the USDT goal reached, the project\u2019s positioning in the presale reflects significant investor interest, emphasizing its potential as a must-have crypto. Retik Finance is set for a significant breakthrough, with plans to strategically list on two of the top five centralized exchanges in Q3 2024. This strategic move aims to enhance Retik\u2019s visibility, accessibility, and liquidity. The project\u2019s recent audit by Certik added trust and transparency, aligning with its mission for secure financial solutions. Retik has also secured listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, validating its legitimacy. These developments position Retik Finance as a must-have crypto in your portfolio in 2024.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Unleashing the Power of Smart Contracts\n\nNo discussion about must-have cryptocurrencies is complete without shining a spotlight on Ethereum (ETH). Launched in 2015, Ethereum has evolved into a powerhouse, providing a robust platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. Its founder, Vitalik Buterin, envisioned a blockchain that goes beyond simple transactions, enabling complex functionalities through self-executing smart contracts. One of Ethereum\u2019s key strengths lies in its vibrant ecosystem, which hosts a myriad of decentralized applications that span the realms of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and more. The platform\u2019s transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake in 2022 not only addressed environmental concerns but also positioned Ethereum as a more scalable and sustainable blockchain. As we delve into the intricacies of Ethereum, it\u2019s crucial to recognize its pivotal role in the ongoing evolution of financial instruments. The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs in the United States has set the stage for Ethereum to follow suit. BlackRock\u2019s CEO, Larry Fink, expressed his belief in the value of an Ethereum ETF, signalling a potential future breakthrough in the market. The inherent versatility of Ethereum and its continuous development make it a cornerstone of any cryptocurrency portfolio. Its capacity to facilitate innovative projects and adapt to emerging trends solidifies Ethereum\u2019s position as a must-have crypto in your portfolio.\n\nSolana (SOL): The Trailblazer in Speed and Efficiency\n\nIn the race for scalability and cost-effectiveness, Solana (SOL) emerges as a frontrunner. Launched in 2020, Solana quickly gained recognition for its unique architecture, allowing it to process thousands of transactions per second at minimal costs. This feat is achieved through the combination of the proof-of-history algorithm and a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Despite facing a dip in value during the 2022 bear market, Solana\u2019s resilience and impressive ecosystem have kept it at the forefront of the cryptocurrency market. The platform\u2019s decentralized exchanges witnessed a staggering $10.1 billion in trading volume in the last seven days, surpassing the volume generated by decentralized exchanges on Ethereum during the same period. Solana\u2019s ascent up the market rankings, securing the 5th spot and closing in on the 4th, demonstrates its potential to disrupt the status quo. Decentralized exchange volume rankings and the platform\u2019s overtaking of established cryptocurrencies underscore Solana\u2019s position as a force to be reckoned with in the crypto space. The recent integration of SOL by leading hardware cryptocurrency wallet manufacturer Trezor further solidifies Solana\u2019s standing. As the crypto market evolves, Solana\u2019s speed, efficiency, and impressive ecosystem make it an indispensable addition to any well-balanced portfolio.\n\nConclusion: A Crypto Trinity for the Future\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum, Retik Finance, and Solana collectively form a crypto trinity that encapsulates the diverse facets of the blockchain revolution. Ethereum\u2019s status as a pioneer in smart contracts and decentralized applications, Retik Finance\u2019s mission to bridge the gap between fiat and crypto, and Solana\u2019s unparalleled speed and efficiency create a dynamic blend that addresses various investor needs. As the cryptocurrency market continues to unfold, these three tokens showcase the potential for innovation, integration, and efficiency. Whether you\u2019re a seasoned investor or a newcomer to the crypto space, considering Ethereum, Retik Finance, and Solana for your portfolio can be a strategic move toward a more diversified and future-ready investment strategy.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance Presale\n\nVisit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):\n\nWebsite: https://retik.com\n\nWhitepaper: https://retik.com/retik-whitepaper.pdf\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/retikfinance\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

The lending platform has dumped $125 million worth of $ETH on exchanges amidst the record day of staked Ethereum redemptions.\n\nThis massive sale has increased the selling pressure of $ETH.

Let\u2019s find out why $GFOX is the best crypto to invest in today.\n\n>>BUY $GFOX TOKENS<<\n\nSelling Pressure on Ethereum Increases As Celsius Dumps $125M $ETH\n\nCelsius Network, the embattled crypto lender that filed for bankruptcy in July 2022, has begun repaying its creditors. Arkham Intelligence reported that from January 8 to January 12, Celsius sold off more than $125 million worth of Ethereum coins.\n\nWhile the sale of the $ETH coins is to be used in repaying creditors, Dune Analytics reported an even bigger selling trend.

Despite losing the recently acquired $2,600 level, the price of Ethereum showed remarkable resilience, remaining above $2,500.\n\nIn addition, there has also been a surge of activity in the Ethereum dApp ecosystem. This trend has supported Ethereum\u2019s resilience and could further back an increase in the coming days.

        "content": "The Final Stage Of The Presale Has Now Started!\n\nThe crypto market has entered into an embrace with the bears, with Ethereum struggling and Optimism facing its own challenges. In the dull market investors and analysts\u2019 search for a bright spot have landed them at the doors of Scorpion Casino (SCORP), a token with a blockbuster presale and great ambition. Join us as we examine the reasons for Ethereum and Optimism\u2019s underperformance and SCORP\u2019s allure.\n\nWill Ethereum\u2019s Slide Continue?\n\nThe recent descent of Ethereum\u2019s price by 1.165% triggers concerns within the crypto community. Despite a hopeful rebound from the local support of $2,503, the looming bearish influence raises the possibility of a continued decline to $2,400. Midterm prospects remain optimistic as Ethereum clings to levels above $2,447. However, the decisive factor lies in buyers\u2019 ability to reclaim the $2,600 zone, preventing a potential tumble.\n\nIn the bigger picture, bears exert more influence than bulls, and without a swift return to the $2,600 zone, a prolonged decline to $2,400 becomes likely. ETH, however, retains a chance for an upward trend, given its current position above the $2,447 level. The stakes are high, and the correction could lead to a test of the $2,300-$2,400 zone by the week\u2019s end.\n\nOptimism\u2019s Rollercoaster Ride Continues\n\nIn contrast to Ethereum\u2019s uncertainties, the Optimism (OP) token and ecosystem have showcased resilience and growth in recent months. A significant surge followed the approval of the Bitcoin Spot ETF, propelling the Optimism (OP) token to $4.23. However, a subsequent correction on January 14 saw a decline of 18.1%, settling at $3.50. Amidst this correction, the mention of Optimism RetroPGF round 3 and the release of the first on-chain RWA, 3DNS, inject optimism into the market. Industry experts predict a bullish future for the Optimism (OP) token, forecasting a rise above $5 in 2024.\n\nBy January 11, the Optimism (OP) token rose by nearly 5% to trade at $4.23 before correcting again. On January 14, the Optimism (OP) token was down by 18.1% to reach $3.50. Amid the OP correction, Vitalik Buterin spoke about Optimism RetroPGF round 3, which had distributed over $100 million on January 12. The first on-chain RWA, 3DNS, was released on the Optimism network on January 12 as well. Due to these developments, experts are bullish on the Optimism (OP) token going forward. They predict the Optimism (OP) token will rise above $5 in 2024.\n\nScorpion Casino: Unique Crypto Presale Inspires Surge\n\nAgainst the backdrop of Ethereum\u2019s turbulence and Optimism\u2019s rollercoaster, Scorpion Casino emerges as a standout player in the crypto arena. The presale, marked by daily withdrawable USDT rewards, gains immense traction, selling out rapidly. Some $SCORP holders have already reaped over $5,000 USDT in less than 30 days. With four renowned ambassadors, singers, and TV stars with vast followership, Scorpion Casino positions itself as a force to be reckoned with. As the presale enters its final phase and anticipates listing on BitMart, Scorpion Casino stands as a testament to the changing landscape of crypto presales.\n\nScorpion Casino\u2019s presale is characterized by daily USDT rewards that are withdrawable during the pre-sale, creating a sense of urgency as it surges and sells out rapidly. Early adopters, or $SCORP holders, have already experienced substantial gains, with some exceeding $5,000 USDT in less than a month. The strategic move to enlist four well-known ambassadors, singers, and TV stars further amplifies Scorpion Casino\u2019s presence. As the presale advances into its final phase, the imminent listing on BitMart marks the beginning of a new era for Scorpion Casino, solidifying its position as a rising star in the crypto presale realm.\n\nScorpion Casino Leads as Giants Tumble\n\nIn a market that has turned its back to major altcoins; where Ethereum faces uncertainties and Optimism navigates its own challenges, Scorpion Casino stands out as the beacon of promise. The presale\u2019s daily USDT rewards, swift sellouts, and substantial earnings for early holders amplify its significance. With celebrity endorsements and listing on BitMart, Scorpion Casino not only captures attention but sets a new standard in the crypto presale space. With a perfect blend of utility, community and long term potential SCORP could just be the bright spot that the market needs right now.\n\nJoin in on the Scorpion Casino Presale Before it Sells Out\n\nPresale: https://presale.scorpion.casino/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ScorpionCasino\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/scorpioncasino_official\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nIn the fast-paced and ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, discerning which coin offersthe best utility is an ongoing debate. Each cryptocurrency, with its unique characteristics andmarket dynamics, presents a different value proposition for investors and users alike. In thisarticle, we delve into the specifics of three distinct cryptocurrencies: Dogecoin, Ethereum, and Meme Moguls, to evaluate their utility and potential in the current market landscape.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE): The Original Meme Coin - A Cultural Crypto Phenomenon\n\nDogecoin is the original meme coin, and it has seen fluctuating fortunes. Priced at $0.07909, its recent performance showcases resilience with a slight uptick of 0.09% in a day. However, it's down 13.95% over the last week and 19.47% in the past month. The yearly performance, though, paints a brighter picture with a 3.08% increase, suggesting a long-term faith in itscultural and community-driven value.\n\nEthereum (ETH): The Blockchain Innovator - Powering a Decentralized Future\n\nEthereum, a cornerstone of the blockchain world, exhibits more robust growth. Its price of$2,414.31 reflects a strong daily increase of 5.22%, coupled with consistent gains over theweek (1.58%) and month (3.28%). Impressively, Ethereum has surged by 81.72% over thepast year. This growth trajectory underscores Ethereum's integral role in supporting a wide range of blockchain applications, from DeFi to NFTs, bolstered by its ongoing technologicaladvancements.\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS): The New Frontier in Crypto - MergingMemes with Market Potential\n\nA newer entrant is carving out its niche by blending the viral appeal of memes with financialopportunities. Although specific price data isn't readily available, the project has madesignificant strides. Having raised $1.57 million in its ICO and entering its fourth phase, Meme Moguls is witnessing strong investor interest.\n\nIts play-to-earn model and unique metaverse platform, 'Mogul Land,' creates a fusion ofentertainment and investment. The platform's presale has already surpassed the $900K mark, indicating a high level of excitement and anticipation among investors. Experts forecast thatthe MGLS token, currently trading at $0.0027, could see a substantial rally in 2024, possiblyreaching $0.19, which would mark it as a profitable investment in the DeFi space.\n\nConclusion\n\nEach of these cryptocurrencies offers distinct prospects: Dogecoin's cultural significance, Ethereum's foundational blockchain utility, and Meme Moguls' innovative blend of memesand finance. While Dogecoin and Ethereum have established their presence and show varyingdegrees of growth, Meme Moguls presents an intriguing, speculative opportunity in thecryptocurrency market.\n\nDogecoin doesn\u2019t offer much utility other than memes. It\u2019s mostly a Bitcoin fork that\u2019sinflationary so transactions aren\u2019t that expensive. Ethereum on the other hand hasrevolutionized the crypto world when it introduced tokens.\n\nMost memecoins don\u2019t have any utility at all while in Meme Moguls we have MogulsCasino, the Moguls Exchange Platform, Moguls Fantasy Trader and most importantlyMoguls Land Metaverse. It\u2019s hard to say if Ethereum has more utility than Meme Moguls.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not hard to predict which one has stronger growth potential since Ethereum isalready established. Meme Moguls is a new project that hasn\u2019t skyrocketed yet. It\u2019s no wonder analysts are predicting it to outpace the growth of Dogecoin and Ethereum reaching1000% during the presale and an x100 surge afterward.\n\nVisit Meme Moguls\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum, as the \"world computer,\" has been at the forefront of the crypto revolution, introducing smart contracts and decentralized applications. Despite facing challenges such as scalability issues and high gas fees, Ethereum remains a dominant force in the cryptocurrency space. The eagerly awaited Ethereum Dencun Upgrade seeks to enhance the efficiency, security, and scalability of the Ethereum blockchain. This upgrade holds the promise of significantly improving transaction speeds and reducing fees, potentially reinvigorating Ethereum's position in the market. Ethereum's role as the birthplace of the DeFi movement cannot be overstated. The platform hosts a myriad of decentralized finance projects and protocols that have contributed to the exponential growth of the DeFi sector. As the demand for decentralized financial services continues to rise, Ethereum's established ecosystem and active developer community provide a solid foundation for further growth.\n\nEthereum's influence extends beyond decentralized finance, as it has maintained its dominance in the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) space. The majority of high-profile NFT projects and marketplaces operate on the Ethereum blockchain, highlighting its pivotal role in the rapidly expanding NFT market. The intersection of NFTs and decentralized finance adds a dynamic dimension to Ethereum's role in the upcoming bull run, as these sectors synergize to create new opportunities and avenues for growth."

A speculation about a Blackrock XRP ETF approval after Ethereum came up online last year, leaving most investors wondering what will become of XRP\u2019s price, however, this news was later debunked as fake news.\n\nHowever, this year, the CEO of Ripple foresees an expansion of cryptocurrency-related ETFs to cryptos like Ripple, following the establishment of Bitcoin ETFs. Notwithstanding, Ripple coin still shows a promising price outlook just like Ethereum. On the other hand, Pullix is positioned for a higher rally as over 11,000 users joined its presale in a month.\n\nRipple\u2019s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse Foresees ETFs Approval for Other Cryptocurrencies\n\nRipple (XRP) CEO is optimistic about the approval of various Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, expecting them to pave the way for similar cryptocurrency investment products in 2024.\n\nWhile he didn't explicitly predict approval for an ETF for Ripple, Garlinghouse anticipates that an Ether ETF will likely receive the green light soon.\n\nIn another talk with Thinking Crypto, James Seyffart doubts the chances of a spot XRP ETF in the U.S. by 2024, attributing it to the unresolved Ripple and SEC lawsuit and the absence of a comparable regulatory framework for Ripple.\n\nHe suggests that only after the Ripple and SEC case concludes and U.S. crypto regulations improve might a spot XRP ETF be considered, possibly in 2025, resolidifying Ripple as one of the top crypto coins.\n\nJP Morgan\u2019s Prospect of an Ethereum (ETH) ETF Approval in the U.S.\n\nMarket optimism surrounds the potential approval of a spot Ethereum (ETH) ETF by May 23, the SEC's deadline for the Ark 21Shares application. JPMorgan gives a 50% chance for approval, influenced by Ethereum being seen as the next ETF candidate after Bitcoin.\n\nSome believe the SEC's omission of Ethereum in recent lawsuits hints at potential commodity classification, a key for ETF approval. However, JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou express skepticism, seeing less than a 50% chance for approval by May.\n\nThe recent surge in Ethereum price this year is tied to hopes for an ETF approval, providing U.S. investors exposure to Ethereum without direct ownership. Ethereum price is currently on a weekly range of $2,450 to $2,600\n\nThe shift in how Ethereum operates and the ongoing legal issues with the SEC regarding certain exchange services are making it tough to approve an Ethereum ETF until these matters are resolved.\n\nPullix\u2019s (PLX) DeFi Potential, Innovative Features, and Projected Market Growth\n\nWith over 11,000 participants, the Pullix (PLX) presale has garnered substantial interest in its DeFi market potential. Pullix stands out by merging features from centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) exchanges, aiming to create a platform that overcomes common issues in online trading, such as asset limitations.\n\nThis innovative approach positions Pullix uniquely, allowing trading across various asset classes, including forex, gold, and cryptocurrencies, leveraging the significant $6.6 trillion daily volume of the forex market.\n\nThe presale has seen 70+ million PLX tokens sold, with the current value at $0.08\u2014a 100% increase from its initial price. Experts anticipate a potential 280% increase before the presale concludes, ranking PLX among top crypto coins this year.\n\nWithin the Pullix ecosystem, exciting features include Copy Trading, enabling users to replicate successful trades, and a Lending Protocol, providing a flexible money market for lending and borrowing.\n\nThe PLX native token serves a dual purpose as a trading tool and as part of a revenue-sharing model. Stakers stand to receive a portion of Pullix's daily revenue positioning PLX as a good crypto to buy for gains. Furthermore, users can stake various currencies like DOGE and ETH for a fixed interest rate.\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities"

Be quick if you want to get your hands on those lucrative tokens before they're all gone.\n\nPresale Closing Soon \u2013 Seize Opportunities Now!\n\nEthereum (ETH): Navigating the ETF Approval Landscape\n\nEthereum (ETH) is currently experiencing a significant shift in narrative due to speculation about a potential exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in the USA. While an Ethereum spot ETF could potentially boost altcoin prices, it's prudent to temper expectations and invest judiciously. The market is closely monitoring the upcoming Bitcoin halving and the U.S. presidential election, both of which could significantly impact Ethereum's (ETH) trajectory.\n\nEthereum's (ETH) price has been fluctuating within a range of $2,188 to $2,736. The 10-day Moving Average is at $2,493, while the 100-day Moving Average is at $2,418. Key support levels are identified at $1,357 and $1,904, with resistance levels emerging at $3,000 and $3,548.\n\nShould regulators approve an Ethereum ETF, the token\u2019s price will probably soar. However, the influence of global events and broader economic trends cannot be overlooked \u2013 the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the USA, possibly affected by the presidential election's outcome, could also impact Ethereum (ETH). Ethereum's (ETH) future price movement is likely to be shaped by these external factors, as well as its own technological advancements and adoption rate.\n\nSolana (SOL): Riding the Altcoin Season Wave\n\nSolana (SOL) is gaining recognition as a prominent player in the emerging altcoin season \u2013. the Altcoin Season Index recently exceeded the critical threshold of 75, signaling the start of this period. Known for its high throughput and low transaction costs, Solana (SOL) has demonstrated a notable price increase and is now forming a bullish pattern on its chart.\n\nThe current price range for Solana (SOL) is between $64.84 and $132.36. The 10-day Moving Average lies at $96.62 and the 100-day Moving Average stands at $65.74. Solana (SOL) has support at $27.97 and faces resistance at $163.01 and $230.54.\n\nSolana's (SOL) performance during the altcoin season and its technical indicators suggest a bullish outlook. However, the volatile nature of the crypto market should not be underestimated \u2013 significant gains are possible, but so are losses. The sustainability of this momentum and Solana's (SOL) ability to reach new heights will be closely monitored by the community.\n\nXai (XAI): The Rising Star in Gaming Cryptocurrency\n\nXai's (XAI) recent price surge is attributed to several key developments: an airdrop that distributed free coins, listings on major exchanges like BNB, and a strong presence in the gaming world's digital currency scene. With a blockchain designed for the gaming community, Xai (XAI) aims to address common challenges faced by gamers online.\n\nXai (XAI) is currently nestled between $0.93 and $1.124. The 10-day Moving Average sits at $0.87 and the 100-Day Moving Average hovers at $0.97. Support levels are set at $0.67 and $0.85, with resistance levels looming at $1.22 and $1.41.\n\nXai's (XAI) near-term prospects appear promising given its recent airdrop and new exchange listings that provided a significant boost. However, to prosper in the long run, Xai (XAI) has to sustain its momentum and capitalize on the potential of the gaming sector. If it innovatively integrates blockchain with gaming and creates new ways to share games, the Xai (XAI) token stands a great chance of growing and succeeding.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs has notably influenced the crypto market, particularly benefiting Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Xai (XAI) and heralding the beginning of an 'altseason' \u2013 a period during which alternative cryptocurrencies gain in value and prominence. Ethereum (ETH) is poised for growth with the potential of an ETF approval, Solana (SOL) is capitalizing on its technical strengths during the altcoin season, and Xai (XAI) is emerging as a significant player in the gaming cryptocurrency sector. Their future price action depends on several factors which are tech developments, market adoption, and broader economic and regulatory events.\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "How To Buy Sell and Trade Tokens On The Arbitrum Network - CryptoDaily",
        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nThe Arbitrum (ARB) network is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that aims to address the scalability and high transaction fees. It is developed by Offchain Labs and utilizes a technology called Optimistic Rollups to achieve its objectives.\n\nOptimistic Rollups work by processing most transactions off-chain and then periodically submitting a summary of those transactions to the Ethereum mainnet. This approach reduces the transaction costs significantly and increases the throughput of the network while maintaining the security guarantees of the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nIn other words, the optimistic rollup feature allows Ethereum smart contracts to scale by passing messages between smart contracts on the Ethereum main chain and those on the Arbitrum second layer chain. Much of the transaction processing is completed on the second layer, and the results of this are recorded on the main chain \u2014 drastically improving speed and efficiency.\n\nOne of the key features of the Arbitrum network is its compatibility with existing Ethereum smart contracts. Developers can deploy their contracts on the Arbitrum network with minimal modifications, allowing for easy migration of decentralized applications (dApps) from Ethereum to Arbitrum.\n\nAlso, the arrival of the Ethereum network introduced a groundbreaking transformation in the realm of blockchain technology, providing a platform for the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and propelling the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi). Nevertheless, as Ethereum\u2019s preeminence soared, it encountered hurdles related to scalability and exorbitant transaction fees.\n\nThis is where the Arbitrum network enters the picture as a Layer 2 scaling solution, poised to tackle these challenges while ensuring seamless integration with Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem. In this article, we will explore the core features of the Arbitrum network and examine its immense potential in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nFeatures Of Arbitrum Network\n\nThe promise of Scalability:\n\nScalability has long been a bottleneck for Ethereum, causing network congestion and skyrocketing transaction fees during times of high demand. Arbitrum tackles this challenge by implementing Optimistic Rollups, a technology that allows for most transactions to be processed off-chain. By aggregating multiple transactions into a single summary, ARB achieves significant scalability improvements, enabling faster confirmation times and a higher throughput. This scalability boost unlocks the potential for a more efficient and seamless user experience on the Ethereum network.\n\nEcosystem and Adoption:\n\nThe Arbitrum network has garnered significant attention and interest within the Ethereum ecosystem. Several prominent projects and protocols have announced plans to deploy on Arbitrum or explore integrations. This growing ecosystem includes decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending platforms, gaming applications, and more.\n\nThe increased adoption of Arbitrum provides users with a wider range of options for interacting with decentralized applications (DApps) and accessing various DeFi services.\n\nSmart Contract Execution:\n\nArbitrum Network makes use of a technique called optimistic execution to process smart contracts. It assumes that most transactions are valid and executes them off-chain. This enables the network in providing fraud proofs, which allows anyone to challenge invalid transactions by submitting evidence to the Ethereum mainnet. This approach enables efficient and secure smart contract execution.\n\nDecentralization and Security:\n\nWhile Arbitrum relies on the Ethereum mainnet for final settlement and security, it maintains a high level of decentralization and security. By leveraging Ethereum\u2019s robust consensus mechanism, Arbitrum benefits from the security guarantees of the Ethereum network. The periodic submission of transaction summaries to Ethereum ensures that any potential fraudulent activity can be detected and resolved.\n\nSeamless User Experience:\n\nUsing the Arbitrum(ARB) network is designed to be seamless for users. They can continue using their existing Ethereum wallets, such as MetaMask, to interact with the Arbitrum network. This familiarity and compatibility make it easier for users to transition from Ethereum to Arbitrum and enjoy the benefits of improved scalability and reduced transaction fees without significant changes to their workflows.\n\nWhat Makes Arbitrum Unique?\n\nThe Arbitrum (ARB) network is designed to provide an easy-to-use platform developers can use to launch highly efficient and scalable Ethereum-compatible smart contracts. It offers a range of exciting possibilities for developers and users alike. Some examples of what can be done on the network include:\n\nHigh EVM compatibility\n\nArbitrum(ARB) is considered to be one of the most EVM-compatible rollups. It\u2019s compatible with the EVM at the bytecode level, and any language that can compile to EVM works out of the box \u2014 such as Solidity and Vyper. This makes it easy to build on since developers do not need to get to grips with a new language before building on Arbitrum.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi) applications:\n\nThe Arbitrum (ARB) network can be used to build and run DeFi applications, such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending and borrowing platforms, and stablecoin systems. These applications can benefit from the network\u2019s fast transaction processing times and low gas fees, enabling efficient and affordable transactions.\n\nLow transaction fees\n\nAs a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, Arbitrum isn\u2019t just designed to boost Ethereum\u2019s transactional throughput, it also minimizes transaction fees at the same time.\n\nThanks to its extremely efficient roll-up technology, Arbitrum is able to cut fees down to just a tiny fraction of what they are on Ethereum, while still providing sufficient incentives for validators.\n\nWell-developed ecosystem\n\nArbitrum is already working with a wide variety of Ethereum DApps and infrastructure projects, including the likes of Uniswap.\n\nCross-Chain Interoperability\n\nThe Arbitrum (ARB) network can also be used to enable cross-chain interoperability between different blockchains. This could allow for the seamless transfer of assets and data between different blockchain ecosystems, enabling greater interoperability and connectivity across the entire blockchain space.\n\nThe Arbitrum network\u2019s fast transaction processing times, low fees, and security and decentralization features make it a compelling choice for a wide range of use cases.\n\nTo buy and sell tokens on the Arbitrum (ARB) network, you must first get a metamask wallet. MetaMask is a popular browser extension wallet commonly used for interacting with blockchain networks like Ethereum. It is available as a browser extension for popular browsers such as Google Chrome.\n\nEnsure your Metamask Wallet has been added to your browser as an extension by clicking on the \u2018Add to Chrome\u201d icon on the top right as shown below:\n\nOnce installed and set up, MetaMask allows users to manage their cryptocurrency wallets, interact with decentralized applications (DApps), and securely execute transactions on supported blockchain networks directly from their browsers. (Make sure to write down your seed phrase on a piece of paper and keep it in a safe place. Do not store it online or on your device).\n\nNext, add the ARB network to your Metamask wallet by following the instructions provided on the Metamask website here.\n\nIn order to execute trades on the ARB network, you will need to fund your wallet with Ethereum (ETH) so as to enable you to cover gas fees even though the majority of the trading activity takes place on the Arbitrum layer 2 solution. This is because the Arbitrum network periodically submits transaction summaries and proofs to the Ethereum mainnet, which requires paying Ethereum gas fees.\n\nYou can buy ETH on centralized exchanges such as Binance, copy your wallet address from Metamask, and then send the ETH from Binance to your Metamask wallet.\n\nYou can also purchase ETH directly within the Metamask wallet using traditional payment methods such as credit or debit cards, etc.\n\nJust click on the \u201cBuy/Sell\u201d button within Metamask to open the interface. Here, you can put how much ETH (or any other token) you want to buy in terms of dollar terms, pick your payment method, and then click \u201cBuy\u201d.\n\nNote that to buy crypto directly within Metamask, you will need to provide info such as your country and state. However, it is a straightforward process that only takes a minute.\n\nIt\u2019ll only take a couple of minutes at most for your ETH to arrive in your wallet. Once the ETH arrives, you are all set to begin trading tokens on the ARB network. So, head over to UniSwap to get started on your trading journey.\n\nUniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to trade Ethereum-based tokens directly from their wallets without the need for intermediaries or traditional order books. Uniswap offers users a simple and straightforward way to buy and sell a wide variety of tokens.\n\nEndeavour to be on the right Uniswap website to protect your wallet from any fraudulent activity. The first step is clicking on the \u201claunch app\u201d button at the top right corner, as shown in the image below:\n\nThe next step is clicking on the connect wallet option on UniSwap at the top right corner, as shown in the image below:\n\nConnect to your preferred wallet as shown below. (In this case, it\u2019s Metamask):\n\nOnce connected, switch Metamask to the ARB network. (If you\u2019re already on the ARB network, you do not need to switch):\n\nAfter connecting MetaMask to the ARB network, go to UniSwap, and then you can start trading on the ARB network using UniSwap.\n\nThe next step is to select your preferred tokens on the UniSwap interface and since Uniswap operates on a token to token trading model, click on the \u201cselect token\u201d button to select the trading pair you want to trade against.\n\nFor example, if you want to buy USDT using ETH, select ETH \u2013 USDT, enter the amount, then click on \u201cswap\u201d or \u201ctrade now\u201d and confirm the transaction in your Metamask wallet. You can view the tokens in your wallet\u2019s asset list.\n\nARB Network users can also buy and sell tokens using the Metamask extension wallet already connected to the ARB network.\n\nTo do this, make sure you\u2019re connected to the ARB network and have ETH to swap and pay for gas fees. Then, navigate to the \u201cSwap\u201d button as shown below. This will take you to the Swap interface inside Metamask.\n\nUsing the image above as a guide, you can also search for tokens using the name or the contract address, just like on UniSwap. Input the amount of ETH you want to swap, confirm that you have the correct token, and then click \u201cSwap.\u201d Once the transaction is confirmed, the tokens you just bought will be sent to your wallet.\n\nUsers of the Arbitrum (ARB) network can take advantage of on-chain tools like Dexscreener to gain access to comprehensive market insights for specific tokens. These insights include price data and contract information, empowering users to make well-informed trading decisions based on reliable and up-to-date information.\n\nWith Dexscreener on the Arbitrum network, users can stay informed about token metrics and market dynamics, enhancing their trading strategies and overall trading experience.\n\nDexscreener offers a variety of advantageous features tailored to users on the Arbitrum network. Among these features, an exceptional one is the charting functionality, which delivers both real-time and historical price data for a wide range of tokens.\n\nBy utilizing these charts, users gain valuable insights into price trends, trading volumes, and other pertinent metrics. This enables them to pinpoint potential entry or exit points for their trades with precision and confidence.\n\nTake a look at the example below:\n\nIn conclusion, the Arbitrum network offers a compelling ecosystem for buying, selling, and trading tokens, providing several notable advantages over other platforms. With its seamless integration of on-chain tools like Dexscreener, users gain access to detailed market insights, real-time price data, and historical charts, enabling them to make informed trading decisions with confidence.\n\nAdditionally, Arbitrum\u2019s scalability and low transaction fees enhance the overall trading experience, ensuring quicker and more cost-effective transactions. By leveraging the power of the Arbitrum network, traders can enjoy a secure, efficient, and feature-rich environment that empowers them to navigate the world of token trading with ease."

Do you think Sui can beat L1, which already has a solid place called Ethereum?\n\n\u25b7 Ethereum's Smart Contract System (EVM) lacks scalability and is slow. Of course, we try to solve this through L2. However, whenever there are points to be supplemented, I don't think it's an essential solution to fix them one by one.\n\nIf it is a structure in which complementary points continue to occur, problems will continue to arise in the future. I think it's right to restructure the structure from the beginning. The Sui team is a project that has created a different structure through long consideration and research. I think it's competitive here.\n\nLet's think of a carriage. No matter how fast you try, a carriage is a carriage. Let's turn the idea upside down. How about making a car. Rather than finding and supplementing complementary points, it is changing from the beginning.\n\nEthereum is too heavy, dull and slow. Various rollups and layer 2 connections to Ethereum are used to solve problems, but in the end, the problems of Ethereum itself still remain. We are going to redesign the cause of the problem.\n\n\uc0ac\uc9c4 \ud655\ub300 The Trilema of the Blockchain For this reason, there is a \"trilema\" that blockchain cannot solve three problems at once: scalability, decentralization, and security. Ethereum tries to solve the Trilema by redesigning the L1 itself through L2 that connects other chains to Ethereum. <Picture=Hashinet>\n\n\u2015 There are many projects that talk similar to Sui. There are Solana and Aptos. Everyone calls themselves the \"Etherium Killer.\" Wouldn't the new L1 actually be a red ocean?\n\n\u25b7 The first chapter in the development of the blockchain industry was Bitcoin. It's value saving. The second chapter is Ethereum, where smart contracts are possible.\n\nThis is the third chapter. As Web2 companies move to Web3, it is expected that numerous users of those companies will move over. Blockchains with high speed and high scalability to accommodate many users will have many opportunities. It wouldn't be a red ocean.\n\nIn the case of Sui, various technologies were developed in preparation for this. For example, there is a 'ZK login'. Just as Web2 companies make ID easily with Facebook and Google accounts. The process of making Sui's blockchain wallet can also be done with social accounts. It allows Web2 users to move to Web3 in a familiar environment.\n\n\"It's fast. The network has never stopped. The size of the community is also vast.\"\n\n\uc0ac\uc9c4 \ud655\ub300 Sue's price rose 45% in January alone.\n\n\u2015 Sui prices and assets (TVL) accumulated in the Sui network have risen sharply in recent years.\n\n\u25b7 I will not comment on the price. But you can think about this. Sui is a new blockchain. The programming language used is also different. As a result, it will take time to create a new ecosystem. As that time has passed, I think the use of Sui blockchain has increased significantly.\n\nAs the utilization of the Sui blockchain increases, the utility of the token increases, and the token price will also have risen.\n\nThe same goes for TVL. This is a sharp increase as outstanding developers come in, create apps, increase usability, and increase value.\n\n\u2015 Compared to the competition layer 1, it increased significantly.\n\n\u25b7 Sui is five times faster than Solana. The completeness is also three to four times better. The community is also much bigger. There are also differences in the programming language on which Sue is based. Places that use the programming language \"Solidity,\" which designed Solana and others, have stability problems while using bridges, and the \"Sui Move\" used by Sui is easy and secure from the developer's point of view.\n\nCompared to Aptos, they use the same language of Move, but Sui's CTO is the one who founded Move. Sui Move is an upgraded language than Move.\n\n\"The value of tokens comes from network competitiveness\"\n\n\uc0ac\uc9c4 \ud655\ub300 In a parliamentary audit of the National Policy Committee last year, Min Byung-deok of the Democratic Party of Korea claimed that coin exchanges are hurting domestic investors by listing foreign coins such as Sui and neglecting price declines.\n\n\u2015 We cannot help but talk about the distribution volume while introducing \"Suyi\" to domestic investors. However, the distribution volume in coins seems to be quite a complicated problem. Coins can't be seen as completely stocked, but they can't just be seen as \"utility tokens\" such as amusement park passes.\n\n\u25b7 The value of the token seems to be duplicated.\n\nFrom the perspective of an economist (Ciurunis is a professor of economics at the Pantheon College of Social and Political Sciences in Athens, Greece), the value of stocks is the present value of all dividends that will be received in the future combined.\n\nBut coins are a network economy. The more participants in the blockchain network, the more exponentially the value increases. Token prices increase in value as utilities increase. So I think we should look at it in a slightly different way.\n\nThe problem is that there are many people who buy coins on the coin exchange. They do not use blockchain networks. Buy tokens hoping for an increase in prices. For them, it feels like buying stocks.\n\nTo be cool, however, the Sui Foundation has no obligation for retail investors to be responsible for the value or part of the token. Instead, it is working hard to expand its education business. I want to participate in the Sui network so that I can feel the utility of the token, so that I can know the value that comes from the network.\n\n\u2015 This may be an answer that feels a little cowardly for those who invest in Sui.\n\n\u25b7 I think it's because it's a double structure. In terms of investment, it is also good to have regulations. Regulations should come when necessary. I don't think there is a need for regulation in the part of using the Sui blockchain. This part is only about technology. However, people who want to store value in tokens, or if they want to use tokens as currency, I think regulations for consumer protection are necessary.\n\nMost people in the industry want to have reasonable guidance and have predictable and transparent regulations that allow participants to make economic decisions. In particular, I hope there will be a part about investor protection.\n\n\"Sui's goal is to change the world\".\n\n\uc0ac\uc9c4 \ud655\ub300\n\n\u2015 Last year, Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, pointed out. It seems that the absolute majority of blockchains are still not producing real results. Will Sue be different?\n\n\u25b7 Changing the world takes time. We are looking at the Sue project in a very long timeline.\n\nIn order for Sue to have value, there must be a place where she can use it. Recently, Sui is implementing the idea of enabling the exchange or transaction of such authentication information in fields such as certification for clean energy.\n\nIt is also creating a structure that records weather data through home devices throughout the house and makes economic profits by buying and selling this data.\n\nThe most important thing in implementing these concepts is that they must be sustainable. I have a variety of ideas and am working on it from a long-term perspective.\n\n\u2015 What is Sui's ultimate goal?\n\n\u25b7 It is to create a project to benefit people's lives. We are creating a fast and scalable project for that.\n\nThere are technicians in Sui who created the iPhone, Instagram, and WhatsApp. I get motivated by them. This is why the philosophy of changing people in real life was created.\n\nSui is not just a project that says \"fast\" or \"network fees are low.\" In June last year, the company achieved a record of 68.7 million transactions per day worldwide. Unlike other coins, the network has never been paralyzed or hacked for hours."

        "title": "Crafting tokens & ICOs on Ethereum: The Ether Alchemist - Guardian Nigeria",
        "content": "Ethereum has emerged as a revolutionary force in the world of blockchain technology, offering a platform for decentralized applications (DApps), smart contracts, and, of course, tokens. This knowledge is invaluable for those keen on navigating the complexities of the blockchain world. While Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, the creation and management of tokens have become an integral part of this ecosystem. This article explores the art of crafting tokens and conducting Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) on Ethereum, shedding light on the various aspects of this fascinating and rapidly evolving domain. For individuals looking to broaden their understanding of investing concepts, Ethereum Code an investment education firm, offers comprehensive insights and guidance.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum Tokens\n\nWhat are Ethereum Tokens?\n\nEthereum tokens are digital assets built on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike Ether (ETH), which serves as the native currency and fuel for the network, tokens on Ethereum are unique digital assets with various use cases. These tokens can represent anything from ownership in a project to access rights, loyalty points, or even a unique piece of digital art.\n\nERC-20 Tokens: The Standard for Fungible Tokens\n\nERC-20 tokens have become the industry standard for fungible tokens on Ethereum. They adhere to a common set of rules and functions, allowing for easy integration with wallets, exchanges, and other services. These tokens are interchangeable with one another, making them ideal for use as traditional currencies or tradable assets. Examples of popular ERC-20 tokens include USDC, DAI, and Chainlink (LINK).\n\nERC-721 Tokens: NFTs and the World of Non-Fungible Assets\n\nERC-721 tokens, known as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), represent a unique class of digital assets. Each NFT is distinct and indivisible, making it suitable for representing ownership of rare collectibles, digital art, and unique digital assets. The Ethereum blockchain has witnessed a surge in NFT popularity, with NFT sales reaching remarkable highs.\n\nICOs on Ethereum: An Overview\n\nInitial Coin Offerings (ICOs) Explained\n\nICOs are a fundraising method that gained tremendous popularity on the Ethereum platform. In an ICO, a project or startup offers a new cryptocurrency token to the public in exchange for established cryptocurrencies like Ether. These tokens often serve as a means of participating in or supporting the project\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nThe Role of Ethereum in Revolutionizing Fundraising through ICOs\n\nEthereum transformed the fundraising landscape by enabling the creation of custom tokens and providing a secure platform for ICOs. The network\u2019s robust and widely adopted smart contract functionality made it a preferred choice for new projects looking to access a global pool of potential investors.\n\nNotable ICO Success Stories on Ethereum\n\nEthereum-based ICOs have seen significant success stories. Notable projects like Ethereum itself, which conducted a groundbreaking ICO in 2014, and projects like EOS, Tezos, and BAT, have all raised substantial amounts of capital through their ICOs. These projects have contributed to the growth and development of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nCrafting Your Own Token on Ethereum\n\nThe Process of Creating a Custom Ethereum Token\n\nCreating a custom Ethereum token involves defining its characteristics, such as its name, symbol, and the total supply of tokens. This is typically done through smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the token embedded within them.\n\nSmart Contracts and Their Role in Token Creation\n\nSmart contracts play a pivotal role in token creation. They are self-executing pieces of code that govern the rules and behavior of the token. By utilizing smart contracts, token creators can ensure trustless and transparent token management.\n\nCustomization Options and Considerations When Designing Tokens\n\nToken creators can customize various aspects of their tokens, including the divisibility, supply, and governance features. It\u2019s essential to carefully consider these options and align them with the project\u2019s objectives and user expectations.\n\nLaunching an ICO on Ethereum\n\nThe Steps Involved in Launching a Successful ICO\n\nLaunching an ICO is a multi-step process that involves setting clear objectives, establishing legal compliance, creating a whitepaper, and executing a marketing and fundraising strategy. A successful ICO requires a well-thought-out plan and execution.\n\nRegulatory Challenges and Compliance Requirements\n\nThe ICO landscape is subject to evolving regulatory frameworks. It\u2019s crucial for projects to navigate these challenges by ensuring compliance with the laws and regulations of their target markets. This might involve KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures, accredited investor requirements, and more.\n\nCase Studies of ICOs on Ethereum\n\nNumerous ICOs on Ethereum have seen varying degrees of success. Case studies of both successful and unsuccessful ICOs provide valuable insights into what works and what doesn\u2019t. Learning from these examples can help future projects navigate the ICO landscape more effectively.\n\nRisks and Challenges\n\nSecurity Concerns and Vulnerabilities in Token Creation\n\nToken creation and ICOs come with security risks, including vulnerabilities in smart contracts and the potential for hacking. Understanding these risks and implementing rigorous security measures is critical to safeguarding both the project and its investors.\n\nLegal and Regulatory Challenges Associated with ICOs\n\nLegal and regulatory challenges can vary greatly by jurisdiction. Navigating this landscape requires a deep understanding of local and international regulations, as non-compliance can result in legal repercussions.\n\nLessons from Past ICO Failures and Scams\n\nThe cryptocurrency space has witnessed its share of ICO failures and scams. Learning from these unfortunate incidents can help future projects make informed decisions and avoid common pitfalls.\n\nThe Future of Tokenization and ICOs on Ethereum\n\nEvolving Trends in Tokenization and Fundraising\n\nThe field of tokenization and fundraising is constantly evolving. Emerging trends include decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, governance tokens, and Security Token Offerings (STOs). Understanding these trends is essential for staying relevant in the space.\n\nThe Role of Ethereum 2.0 in Shaping the Future\n\nEthereum 2.0, an upgrade to the Ethereum network, holds the potential to enhance scalability, security, and sustainability. It\u2019s expected to have a profound impact on the future of tokenization and ICOs on Ethereum.\n\nPredictions and Prospects for Ethereum-based Projects\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem continues to expand with new projects, DApps, and decentralized services. The prospects for Ethereum-based projects remain promising as the technology matures and gains mainstream acceptance.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, Ethereum has played a pivotal role in advancing the blockchain ecosystem by providing a versatile environment for creating tokens and hosting ICOs. As technological and regulatory dynamics undergo continuous transformation, the processes of token crafting and ICO execution on the Ethereum network will persistently evolve, reshaping the landscape of fundraising and digital asset management. This ever-evolving space holds the promise of innovation, abundant investment prospects, and the need for entrepreneurs and developers to tackle emerging challenges.\n\n"

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Defines L2s on Celestia as Validiums, Not Rollups - CryptoDaily",
        "content": "Ethereum Foundation co-founder Vitalik Buterin has recently weighed in on the classification of the blockchain's Layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions and declared that validiums associated with Ethereum should not be confused with genuine rollup solutions.\n\nThe discussion gained momentum this week, when Ethereum enthusiast and Soul Wallet co-founder Zeng Jiajun noted that ethereum.org and Buterin define \"Layer 2 = rollup\" and added that \"if one uses any other chain (Celestia, for example) as DA [data availability], it is a Celestia L2.\"\n\nButerin agreed with Daniel Wang, the founder of Taiko, an Ethereum rollup solution, who suggested that Ethereum rollups relying on external data chains for data availability, like Celestia, should be classified as validiums.\n\nThis is correct.\n\n\n\nThe core of being a rollup is the unconditional security guarantee: you can get your assets out even if everyone else colludes against you. Can't get that if DA is dependent on an external system.\n\n\n\nBut being a validium is a correct choice for many apps, and\u2026 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 16, 2024\n\nButerin shared the defining feature of rollups, stating that \"the core of being a rollup is the unconditional security guarantee: you can get your assets out even if everyone else colludes against you.\" He also pointed out the inherent security risks when data availability (DA) is dependent on an external system and recognized that a validium is a viable choice for many applications. He suggested that implementing robust, distributed DA systems could significantly bolster the practical security of a validium.\n\nValidiums, as defined by ethereum.org, are a scaling solution for Ethereum that enhances transaction processing capacity by allowing off-chain transactions through zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs while relying on the blockchain's mainnet for verification processes and security. Unlike rollups, validiums bypass storing all transaction data to an L1, boosting scalability by limiting on-chain data storage.\n\nValidiums also introduce reliance on third-party operators for accurate proof postings, potentially impacting data availability, a challenge less prevalent in rollups. Validiums are crucial in balancing transaction speed and privacy in systems like Celestia's modular blockchain.\n\n\n\nCelestia uses a modular design, differing from Ethereum's architecture, by separating data availability and validation into distinct layers. This structure offers customizable data availability and independent validation layer deployment.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, Ryan Berckmans, a member of the Ethereum community and the founder of Ethereum payments app 3cities, challenges Buterin's view. Berckmans commented that validiums should be considered L2 networks, arguing that a Layer 2 chain is defined by its settlement on Ethereum, not by the location of its data availability. He emphasizes the industry's flexibility in still being able to define 'L2' and suggests a more inclusive definition encompassing both rollups and validiums. Berckmans also references L2Beat, a platform tracking the adoption of layer-2 protocols, which currently includes validiums in its L2 lists.\n\nYes, but validiums are L2s.\n\n\n\nThis is a new industry, we can define \"L2\" to mean whatever we want.\n\n\n\nThe maximally useful definition of L2 includes both rollups and validiums.\n\n\n\nThat's why L2Beat lists validiums today.\n\n\n\nL2 = rollup or validium https://t.co/WwtkAV2sAE \u2014 Ryan Berckmans ryanb.eth (@ryanberckmans) January 16, 2024\n\nL2Beat's website, however, states that validiums are not L2s: \"by not publishing data on L1 they introduce additional trust assumptions on top of it. If the data to reconstruct the state is not made available by the operators of the off-chain DA solution, funds are at risk.\" So L2Beat considers validiums to fall outside the scope of traditional rollup-style L2 solutions.\n\n\"We include Validiums and Optimiums along with L2s mainly for historical reasons. We introduced them when the L2 space was still in its infancy and we wanted to provide a comprehensive overview of the space. We will continue to track these projects to provide the community with a broader perspective on the state of the space and to provide tools to evaluate the different tradeoffs between the various solutions.\"\n\nAlthough there is still debate over whether a validium should fall under the L2 umbrella, Vitalik clearly sees the structure as something separate."

        "content": "Renowned Ethereum founder, Vitalik Buterin, has ignited a fervent debate within the crypto industry, urging stakeholders to prioritize transparency and accountability. Drawing attention to recent governance challenges, Buterin\u2019s insights shed light on a critical need for open dialogue and the industry\u2019s responsibility to rectify its past missteps.\n\nEthereum Founder: Address Crypto Industry\u2019s Governance Issues\n\nButerin\u2019s reflections were prompted by two prominent incidents that have rattled the crypto sphere: the controversy surrounding Sam Bankman-Fried and governance issues within the OpenAI board. However, his focus extends beyond these specific cases, delving into the broader challenges faced by the tech and crypto sectors.\n\nCentral to Buterin\u2019s argument is the call to address the industry\u2019s governance shortcomings, which he refers to as a \u201cfoundational sin.\u201d He emphasizes that the core issue lies not only in the controversial actions themselves but also in the lack of transparent and accountable dialogue with the public. This failure to foster trust and engagement has far-reaching consequences for the industry\u2019s credibility and long-term sustainability.\n\nI feel like my response survived ok: my main critique in both cases was \u201crespect public legitimacy more\u201d (Sam\u2019s sin was the fraud plus the \u201cwoke shibboleths\u201d thing, the OpenAI board\u2019s sin was making a sudden huge decision and feeling entitled to not explain itself to the public) \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 20, 2024\n\nThe FTX scandal serves as a timely example of the consequences of this foundational sin. Buterin underscores the importance of substantiated evidence before passing swift judgment on high-ranking CEOs involved in deceptive behavior. The absence of a governing board at FTX highlights the critical need for robust oversight mechanisms to ensure checks and balances within corporate structures.\n\nEthereum currently trading at $2,409 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nButerin: Rectify \u2018Foundational Sin\u2019\n\nButerin\u2019s astute analysis examines the intricacies of corporate governance, especially within the ever-evolving ethereum and crypto landscape. He argues that rectifying the industry\u2019s foundational sin requires a paradigm shift that values public trust and legitimacy. Instances like Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s fraudulent activities and the opaque decision-making process at OpenAI serve as cautionary tales, exposing the pressing need for improved governance practices in the tech and crypto sectors.\n\nThe key question arises: How can crypto companies restore trust, transparency, and accountability? Buterin proposes a governance model that not only complies with legal mandates but also genuinely engages with the community. By fostering open dialogue and involving stakeholders, companies can rebuild public trust and address the industry\u2019s governance challenges head-on.\n\nWhile the Ethereum founder\u2019s vision has garnered support from many quarters, skeptics question the practicality of implementing such a governance model in the complex crypto landscape.\n\nAs the crypto industry grapples with these profound challenges, the discussions ignited by Buterin\u2019s insights on transparency and accountability have become pivotal to its evolution.\n\nFeatured image from Getty Images"

        "title": "EigenLayer's Approach to Enhancing Ethereum's Security - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "EigenLayer, a significant player in the blockchain domain, is steering the Ethereum ecosystem towards a new horizon of security and efficiency. Spearheaded by Sreeram Kannan, the co-founder of EigenLabs, the protocol is gearing up to introduce a security model.\n\nThe model is not only poised to revolutionize the way protocols are launched on Ethereum but also to address the inherent risks associated with the process.\n\nA paradigm shift in protocol security\n\nThe core of EigenLayer\u2019s innovation lies in its pooled security model. The model is designed to economically and efficiently launch protocols by leveraging a shared pool of capital. However, the model isn\u2019t without its critics. Some skeptics argue that while it reduces costs, it might inadvertently promote a culture of increased risk-taking. Addressing these concerns, Kannan revealed an upcoming feature that could be a game-changer for the protocol and its users: the introduction of \u201cinsurance\u201d or \u201cattributable security.\u201d\n\nThe new feature, detailed by Kannan in a series of posts and a presentation at a conference in Istanbul, is a technical solution aimed at mitigating collateral damage. In essence, it allows protocols, known as Actively Validated Services (AVSs), to purchase a claim on a designated portion of the restaked capital. The mechanism acts as a safety net, ensuring that in the event of a failure or hack, the damage does not ripple uncontrollably through the network.\n\nThe mechanics of restaking and pooled scurity\n\nEigenLayer\u2019s approach to enhancing Ethereum\u2019s security is multifaceted. It starts with the concept of restaking, where Ether is locked up or \u201cstaked,\u201d forming the backbone of Ethereum\u2019s security. However, the process can be technically daunting and financially burdensome for individual investors. EigenLayer bridges the gap by connecting these investors with node operators\u2014entities equipped to manage the capital and hardware required for maintaining the blockchain.\n\nThrough restaking, EigenLayer achieves a dual-purpose security model. It not only secures Ethereum but also extends the security to a variety of other protocols without the need for separate blockchains. The model, while still in its infancy, has already garnered significant attention and funding, with user deposits exceeding $1.7 billion.\n\nEigenLayer\u2019s Balancing innovation with responsibility\n\nDespite the excitement surrounding EigenLayer\u2019s pooled security model and its potential to democratize and fortify the Ethereum ecosystem, the road ahead is paved with challenges and critical decisions. The concept of pooled security, likened by Kannan to a military alliance, offers cost-effective benefits but also introduces complex risk dynamics. Critics like Chunda McCain and Meir Bank have pointed out the potential pitfalls of the model, emphasizing the need for a balanced and cautious approach.\n\nThe introduction of attributable security is a response to these concerns. It promises a hybrid security model where AVSs can enjoy the benefits of pooled security while having the option to mitigate risks through a dedicated security reserve. The model, though potentially increasing the cost of launching AVSs, introduces a layer of financial prudence and risk management into the ecosystem.\n\nAs EigenLayer progresses towards implementing these changes, the industry watches closely. The protocol\u2019s cautious yet innovative approach reflects a deep understanding of the complexities involved in securing a vast, decentralized network like Ethereum. With plans to launch node operators and an EigenLabs-built AVS in the first half of 2024, followed by third-party AVSs, EigenLayer is setting a deliberate pace. The measured approach, emphasizing security and sustainability, could very well set a new standard for blockchain protocols and contribute profoundly to the stability and growth of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nConclusion\n\nEigenLayer is at the forefront of a transformative phase in the Ethereum ecosystem, introducing a novel security model that marries innovation with responsibility. The protocol\u2019s pivot towards a hybrid security model, encompassing both pooled and attributable security, represents a strategic response to the complexities and risks inherent in blockchain technology. By enabling a more secure, efficient, and scalable framework for launching protocols, EigenLayer is not just enhancing the robustness of the Ethereum network but also setting a precedent for the future of blockchain security. As the industry anticipates the roll-out of these groundbreaking features, EigenLayer\u2019s deliberate and meticulous approach underscores its commitment to fostering a more resilient and inclusive blockchain landscape."

        "title": "Cardano (ADA) Surpasses Ethereum (ETH) in Whale Transactions, Signals Strength Amid Bearish Market - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "Despite facing market declines, Cardano surpasses Ethereum in large transactions, with daily volumes reaching $13 billion.\n\nCardano\u2019s ADA price dropped by 2.56% to $0.5177, while Ethereum saw a milder 0.85% decrease to $2,516.35 in the past 24 hours.\n\nCardano (ADA) has recently outpaced Ethereum (ETH) in large transaction volumes. Data from the crypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock (ITB) reveals that Cardano\u2019s 30-day volume of large transactions, defined as those exceeding $100,000 in fiat value, significantly surpasses Ethereum\u2019s. This development emerges as the crypto market attempts to navigate through a bearish phase.\n\nCardano whales have been quite active for the past few months. $13B in large transactions (>$100k) is being settled on Cardano daily on average. A significant amount, if you compare it to Ethereum's $5B 7-day average. pic.twitter.com/8rjeQZaonU \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 18, 2024\n\nCardano, known for its scientific approach to blockchain development and a strong focus on sustainability, has seen its market price and capitalization dip by 4% in the past 24 hours, at $0.5 and $17 billion respectively. In contrast, Ethereum, the industry\u2019s foremost smart contract network, has experienced a milder decline of 1.96% in the same period, with its price adjusting to $2,487.35.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Position in the Market\n\nWith a slower growth rate, Ethereum holds its position, while Cardano shows a strong influx of large transactions. According to IntoTheBlock data, the weekly average of Ethereum\u2019s huge transactions\u2014mostly those made by market whales\u2014is approximately $5 billion. Ethereum\u2019s transaction volume has, however, recently increased. Over the past 24 hours, it has increased by 6.74% to $4.16 billion. This increase contrasts Cardano\u2019s higher volume, currently at $11.24 billion but has dropped 8.74% in the same period.\n\nEthereum continues to be a major force in the cryptocurrency market, having been the first to develop smart contract technology and spur the emergence of decentralized apps (dApps). It continuously upgrades to a proof-of-stake consensus process to address scalability and environmental concerns, factors crucial to its long-term viability.\n\nThe competition between Layer-1 networks like Ethereum and Cardano reflects the larger dynamics in the cryptocurrency market. To have the Cardano protocol surpass Ethereum in market valuation is one of the community\u2019s aspirational goals. This objective seems far-fetched, though, given that Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization is $302,549,903,898 while Cardano\u2019s is only $903,898.\n\nCardano\u2019s immediate focus may be leveraging its current strengths, including the recent surge in whale transaction volume and its ongoing developer activity. These factors play a crucial role in establishing Cardano as a strong competitor in the blockchain market, which could challenge Ethereum\u2019s established dominance.\n\nThe Bearish Sentiment and Future Prospects\n\nThe prevailing bearish sentiment in the crypto market has impacted both Cardano and Ethereum, albeit in different magnitudes. ADA has recently fallen below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a critical market sentiment indicator. This drop is typically considered a bearish signal, often leading to further declines or a market consolidation period. The significance of this drop lies in the combination of high transaction volumes with ADA\u2019s negative price action, raising questions about the long-term strategies of large-scale investors in Cardano.\n\nDespite these challenges, Cardano\u2019s community remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, especially in its ambition to surpass Ethereum in market capitalization. However, with Cardano\u2019s market cap currently at $18.3 billion, significantly lower than Ethereum\u2019s $302.5 billion, this goal appears more aspirational in the current market context.\n\n."

        "title": "SEC Delays Decision on Ethereum ETF: Market Anticipates Impact on ETH Prices - The Currency Analytics",
        "content": "In a recent development, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has opted to prolong its assessment of Fidelity\u2019s application for a spot Ethereum ETF. This decision, conveyed through a letter to Fidelity dated January 18, 2024, marks a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency landscape, prompting industry watchers to contemplate potential parallels with the journey of Bitcoin ETF approvals.\n\nThe application, initially submitted on November 17, 2023, and open for public comments since December 6, will now undergo an extended evaluation process, with the resolution expected around March 5, 2024. Notably, this 45-day extension has fueled speculation, with Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart suggesting that approval might materialize in May. BlackRock\u2019s CEO, Larry Fink, expressing confidence in the value of a spot Ethereum ETF, added weight to the conversation, noting the significance of such a development shortly after the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nWhile the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF failed to trigger a notable surge in prices, Ethereum, on the other hand, might experience a more pronounced response to both the proposal submission and the eventual decision. The cryptocurrency, currently trading around $2,400, has witnessed a minor loss of less than 1% in the last 24 hours. Despite this apparent downtrend, Ethereum\u2019s current value surpasses its worth from a year ago.\n\nAnalyzing the daily timeframe chart, it becomes evident that ETH did not reach its present price level over the past year. The ongoing bull trend, while displaying signs of weakening, remains evident, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicating a bullish trend at press time by remaining above the neutral line.\n\nThe impact on Ethereum\u2019s market trends is being closely monitored. Unlike Bitcoin, where the ETF approval had a minimal immediate effect on prices, Ethereum\u2019s market may be more responsive to the news of the proposal submission and subsequent decision. As of the latest update, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at approximately $2,400, reflecting a marginal loss of less than 1% in the last 24 hours. Despite the current downtrend, Ethereum\u2019s value remains higher than its position a year ago.\n\nAnalyzing the daily timeframe chart for ETH/USD, it becomes evident that the present price level was not reached over the past year. However, the ongoing bull trend shows signs of weakening, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remaining above the neutral line, indicating a prevailing bullish trend.\n\nExamining the exchange flow of Ethereum, it is notable that the balance between inflow and outflow shifted around January 14. Since then, a consistent trend of more outflows than inflows has emerged. This suggests a significant amount of ETH is leaving exchanges, with fewer Ethereum assets available for sale recently. This dynamic in exchange flow could potentially impact the cryptocurrency\u2019s market dynamics in the coming weeks.\n\nTaking a closer look at Ethereum\u2019s exchange flow, a recent examination by AMBCrypto reveals a noteworthy shift in the balance between inflow and outflow around January 14. Since then, a consistent trend has emerged, indicating more outflow than inflow. This suggests a substantial amount of ETH is leaving exchanges, while the incoming volume remains comparatively lower. Furthermore, this trend implies a reduction in the number of Ethereum assets available for sale in recent times.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency community awaits the SEC\u2019s decision, the impact on Ethereum\u2019s market dynamics and valuation remains a focal point of discussion. While the spot Bitcoin ETF approval did not lead to an immediate surge in prices, Ethereum\u2019s unique circumstances and the increasing outflows from exchanges raise questions about how the market will react.\n\nPotential investors and enthusiasts are advised to stay vigilant, as the SEC\u2019s decision holds the potential to reshape Ethereum\u2019s trajectory in the coming months. Whether the market will witness a surge in prices following approval or if the current trends in exchange flows will continue, only time will tell.\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of digital assets, regulatory decisions play a crucial role in shaping market sentiment. As Ethereum enthusiasts and investors eagerly await the outcome of the SEC\u2019s review, the cryptocurrency market is poised for a period of heightened anticipation and speculation."
