        "title": "So your layer-2 is 'secured by Ethereum' \u2014 what does that mean? - Blockworks",
        "content": "The chief selling point of layer-2 blockchains built atop Ethereum \u2014 aside from increased throughput \u2014 is security. Ideally, it should be faster and cheaper to interact with L-2s, but also as safe to transact as using Ethereum.\n\nUnsurprisingly, in practice it\u2019s complicated and not always black and white.\n\n\u201cSecurity,\u201d in this context, refers to the settlement guarantees on Ethereum mainnet. That translates to how certain a user can be that their L-2 transactions will be finalized correctly \u2014 without censorship \u2014 and whether assets remain safe from being stolen by the more performant layer-2.\n\nWe\u2019re not talking security from smart contract bugs at the level of applications (it\u2019s not about avoiding exploits or rugpulls), but whether the Ethereum Virtual Machine runs the code and reconciles its state per specifications.\n\nThere\u2019s not a universally accepted definition of what it means to be \u201csecured by Ethereum.\u201d According to Louis Guthmann, ecosystem lead at StarkWare, a key feature of assessing whether an L-2 qualifies is the existence of an \u201cescape hatch\u201d \u2014 a way to permissionlessly exit with one\u2019s assets back to Ethereum mainnet.\n\n\u201cA layer-2 requires a mechanism that allows itself to resolve its challenges using the main chain,\u201d Guthmann told Blockworks.\n\nData aggregator L2Beat defines a layer-2 as \u201ca chain that fully or partially derives its security from [Ethereum mainnet] so that users do not have to rely on the honesty of L2 validators for the security of their funds.\u201d\n\nIt provides a handy \u201crisk analysis\u201d framework for keeping track of various L-2 options. Projects are ranked by total value locked (TVL), not security, but the framework compares all active layer-2s across a spectrum of security-related criteria.\n\nSource: L2Beat\n\nOf these, the \u201cstate validation\u201d method is what L2Beat deems \u201cmost important\u201d because that is how the chain \u201censures that L2 validators cannot cheat and include invalid transactions in a L2 block, e.g. mint coins out of thin air or steal your coins,\u201d according to the site\u2019s FAQ.\n\nValidation occurs through either validity proofs (also known as ZK proofs) or fraud proofs (also known as fault proofs).\n\nA zero-knowledge proof is a cryptographic technique used in layer-2 rollups to verify the correctness of a transaction or computation without revealing any sensitive information.\n\nImagine you have a treasure chest with a secret combination lock, and you want to prove to your friend that you know the correct combination without actually telling them the numbers. With a zero-knowledge proof, you can demonstrate conclusively that you can open the chest and thus have the combination, without actually disclosing the code.\n\nFraud proofs are an alternative way to detect and prevent malicious activities or errors in the transaction processing on a rollup. It ensures that the transactions executed off-chain are honest and accurate.\n\nThe proof on Ethereum mainnet acts like a referee who checks the moves of a chess game to make sure they are legal. If anyone tries to cheat or submits an incorrect game state, the fraudulent or faulty action won\u2019t be accepted.\n\nData availability refers to whether transaction data is stored on Ethereum mainnet \u2014 the most secure \u2014 or elsewhere.\n\nCombining these two, we have four widely accepted varieties of Layer-2s. Per L2Beat:\n\nzkRollups \u2014 Validity Proofs with data on L1 Ethereum;\n\nOptimistic Rollups \u2014 Fraud Proofs with data on L1 Ethereum;\n\nValidium \u2014 Validity Proofs with data kept off-chain; and\n\nPlasma \u2014 Fraud Proofs with data kept off-chain.\n\nEach of these varieties entails tradeoffs, and some may be more suited to specific use cases than others.\n\nThe first zk proof-based rollup was Loopring, which launched a dex back in February 2020. But it has stagnated in recent years, L2Beat data shows, processing about one transaction every 10 seconds, while the chain\u2019s TVL has fallen 88% from its 2021 peak, and consists of over 50% LRC \u2014 the chain\u2019s own native token.\n\nA new focus on its smart wallet and gaming initiatives remains.\n\nOptimistic rollup launch\n\nThe first optimistic rollups to hit mainnet were Arbitrum (ARB), launched in August 2021, and Optimism (OP) which followed in December 2021. Both took up the \u201csecured by Ethereum\u201d mantle through the mechanism of fraud proofs.\n\nAccording to Optimism developer OP Labs, \u201cfault proofs\u201d is a more accurate term.\n\n\u201cThe system isn\u2019t always detecting \u2018fraud,\u2019 the majority of the time it\u2019s just \u2018fault\u2019 (i.e. a node wasn\u2019t synced and it agrees with an incorrect output root, etc.),\u201d an OP Labs spokesperson told Blockworks. But L2Beat uses the more common \u201cfraud proof\u201d and they are conceptually interchangeable.\n\nThe difference initially was in the details of the fraud proof implementation. Optimism opted for a simpler \u201csingle-round\u201d proof design, while Arbitrum developer Offchain Labs preferred \u201cinteractive proofs.\u201d\n\nA subsequent audit of Optimism by security researcher Yoav Weiss showed in March 2022 that \u201csingle-round fraud proofs are hard to secure,\u201d for which he received a retroactive grant from the Optimism team.\n\n\u201cIf fraud proofs become too complex, they could make full decentralization too risky,\u201d Weiss wrote. \u201cA malicious sequencer could corrupt and rugpull the entire rollup if it can make an unprovable state transition.\u201d\n\nThe sequencer is a key component of rollups responsible for transaction ordering and can be centralized or decentralized, but today\u2019s examples are predominantly centralized.\n\nOptimism switched to an approach more similar to Arbitrum\u2019s, in its \u201ccannon\u201d release, although Ben Jones, director at the Optimism Foundation, told Blockworks the \u201cvulnerabilities were not the driver for us changing course.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is true though that some flexibility is limited, and our decision to pioneer the first EVM equivalent L2 codebase made that flexibility and modularity more important than ever,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThis was the main driver, alongside research breakthroughs resulting from the development of cannon.\u201d\n\nOf the two major optimistic rollups by TVL and activity, only Arbitrum has implemented fraud proofs. That has been a major point of contention between the two teams over security claims, with Offchain Labs co-founder Steve Goldfeder going so far as to analogize Optimism\u2019s current status to \u201cbuilding cars without engines\u201d but then trying \u201cto sell one by putting a sticker on it that says \u2018very powerful engine\u2019.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nRelative immaturity\n\nOptimism\u2019s recent Bedrock upgrade introduced a number of improvements, but fault proofs were not among them. Jones didn\u2019t specify a timeline, but said \u201cfault proofs are a key priority on our decentralization roadmap.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are aiming towards reaching [L2Beat\u2019s] Stage 2 decentralization as quickly as possible, and in our view, Stage 2 requires multiple implementations of the fault proof.\u201d\n\nL2Beat released its framework of \u201cstages\u201d earlier this month, building upon Ethereum co-found Vitalik Buterin\u2019s proposed milestones. It notes the stages focus on decentralization \u201cmaturity\u201d which is not necessarily directly analogous to security \u2014 although there are clear parallels.\n\n\n\nBedrock now has multiple execution clients, a unique feature Jones said, that is \u201cpaving the way for multiple [fault] proofs.\u201d\n\nThe OP Stack\u2019s \u201csuperchain\u201d concept isn\u2019t limited to fault proofs, but can include zero-knowledge proofs as well. The Optimism Foundation recently put out a request for proposal to develop exactly that, encouraging teams such as Mina protocol\u2019s O(1) Labs to complete its design.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nJones said a successful candidate will improve composability between superchains in addition to providing redundancy.\n\n\u201cA very important note on this RFP is that it is for the same exact state machine which the fault proofs run,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThis means that having a ZK-secured chain will not require sacrifices to EVM equivalence.\u201d\n\nStarkware\u2019s Guthmann said \u201chaving more adoption of zk as their underlying proof system is very exciting for the ecosystem \u2014 it\u2019s more investment more research and hopefully more efficient provers and infrastructure for blockchain to develop.\u201d\n\nHe views L2Beat\u2019s concept of Stage 0-to-2 rollups as \u201ca bit too strict.\u201d\n\nTo reach Stage 1, a rollup must have deployed a \u201ccomplete and functional proof system,\u201d with \u201cat least five external actors who can submit fraud proofs,\u201d and users must be able to exit to Ethereum mainnet \u201cwithout the help of the permissioned operators.\u201d\n\nStage 2 further requires \u201cthe rollup becomes fully managed by smart contracts,\u201d with a permissionless fraud proof system \u2014 anyone can submit a proof \u2014 and at least a 30-day timelock for system upgrades, giving users \u201cample time to exit.\u201d\n\nThis goes back to the notion of an \u201cescape hatch.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe gap from 0 to 1 is tremendous,\u201d Guthmann said. \u201cAnd even from 1 to 2 is unrealistic for any L-2 that\u2019s going to have a governance, because basically number two assumes that you\u2019re never going to upgrade your system, which is problematic,\u201d he said.\n\nJones said \u201cpermissionless withdrawals are insufficient to be \u2018secured by Ethereum,\u2019 if there is still a multisig which can unilaterally break security properties.\u201d\n\nMulti-signature wallet schemes are frequently used to manage the upgradability of smart contracts.\n\n\u201cThe ability to withdraw to L1 \u2014 to another environment \u2014 is what makes them more interesting as a scaleability solution where you keep self-custody,\u201d Guthmann said. Governance of a system relies on some kind of upgradeability, whether it\u2019s Ethereum\u2019s social consensus process, or proof-of-stake token voting, or a multisig controlled by a smaller group.\n\nIt\u2019s fundamentally a question of where chains fall on the decentralization spectrum, and Gutman said zero-knowledge tech enables scaleability gains to come without undermining decentralization.\n\nOf the major rollups, only Arbitrum has reached Stage 1. (Decentralized exchange dYdX is listed based on its deployment on Starkware\u2019s StarkEx system, but it will soon migrate to a Cosmos-based sovereign rollup.)\n\nGuthmann thinks that classification is fully justified. \u201cThey\u2019re doing much better than any of the other teams combined,\u201d he said.\n\nBut ultimately, he expects zero-knowledge tech to become the standard on both a security and scalability basis.\n\n\u201cThere is a difference between Optimism and their lack of fraud proofs, and zkSync and what Starkware does. There is a difference of technological advancement.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The Ethereum Name Service (ENS), a decentralized domain name system built on the Ethereum blockchain, will implement Layer 2 interoperability with ENS domains, according to the project\u2019s developer, ENS Labs, during a community call on Thursday.\n\nThe team said it identified Layer 2 interoperability as a crucial upgrade in the pipeline. Layer 2 solutions, such as Arbitrum and Optimism, are \u2018off-chain\u2019 mechanisms designed to handle transactions away from the Layer 1 Ethereum blockchain to improve scalability and reduce costs. By providing a mechanism for Layer 2 solutions to interact with ENS domains, the team aims to make domain name registrations and transactions more accessible to a broader user base.\n\nThe team plans to utilize off-chain resolvers with the help of an ENS off-chain registrar contract and various service providers, including the Coinbase-operated project cb.id, Lens Protocol (on Polygon), and OptiNames (on Optimism), among others.\n\nGasless import of web names\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThe team announced that web-integrated domain name TLDs, including .art and .box, are collaborating with ENS Labs for close integration. This will allow users to register browser-supported names via ENS. Furthermore, it will also enable DNS names to be traded as NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain for the first time this year.\n\nIn this context, a new roadmap feature discussed during the call and included in the roadmap is the option to import DNS, the web naming protocol, into ENS at no transaction costs, thus making it \"gasless.\" This feature, slated for release in the third quarter of the year, has the potential to improve web accessibility to the ENS ecosystem and lower the barrier to entry for traditional internet users, the team noted.\n\n\u201cGasless DNS names and expanded Layer 2 interoperability, which we aim to launch before the end of Q3, are the next steps in our goal to make ENS names the standard for decentralized digital identity in Web3,\u201d Nick Johnson, ENS founder and lead developer, said in a statement to The Block. \u201cThese types of developments are key for us as we work towards simplifying onboarding and increasing the accessibility of Ethereum and crypto.\u201d"

        "title": "Why Ethereum, Shiba Inu, and Bitcoin Cash Are Rising Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nMost cryptocurrencies moved higher today, as more mainstream financial institutions filed to launch spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and as altcoins gained steam.\n\nSince late afternoon yesterday, the price of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH 0.42%), traded 3.4% higher as of 10:35 a.m. ET today. Meanwhile, the price of the meme token Shiba Inu (SHIB 0.73%) traded 4.5% higher, while the price of Bitcoin Cash (BCH 3.59%) had jumped nearly 26%.\n\nSo what\n\nEver since the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF, cryptocurrencies have been rallying on the belief that more interest in the sector from mainstream financial giants will ultimately increase exposure.\n\nWhile other spot Bitcoin ETFs have been rejected by the SEC, BlackRock's filing seemed to change the game because it proposed a surveillance-sharing agreement with the Nasdaq, where it intends to list the ETF. This agreement would share information about trading activity and the identity of customers, which the SEC believes is necessary to prevent market manipulation.\n\nFollowing BlackRock, a swarm of other players have proposed Bitcoin ETFs with the SEC and the latest is Fidelity, which has also proposed to have a surveillance-sharing agreement. These ETFs would ultimately make it easier for investors to gain access to Bitcoin without having to buy the cryptocurrency itself.\n\nIn other news, Bitcoin Cash has been exploding higher all week, most recently on a ton of trading volume out of investors in South Korea. The excitement continues to be fueled by the news that Bitcoin Cash is one of four cryptocurrencies being listed by a new exchange called EDX Markets, which is backed by Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and Citadel.\n\nInterestingly, the exchange decided to list Bitcoin Cash because it believes regulators are likely to determine that the cryptocurrency is a commodity and not a security. Whether or not cryptocurrencies are commodities or securities is a big point of contention in the crypto ecosystem right now. Commodities would be regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, while securities would be overseen by what is presumed to be the much stricter SEC.\n\nIn more regulatory news today, a new bill that formally recognizes cryptocurrencies as a regulated financial instrument and investment was officially made a law today in the United Kingdom. Many believe that regulatory clarity is a necessity for crypto to be able to move forward.\n\nNow what\n\nNews regarding spot Bitcoin ETFs has been the biggest driver of cryptocurrencies in recent weeks, so it makes sense that the news regarding Fidelity continued to fuel the sector today.\n\nBut the fact that investors are pouring into Bitcoin Cash because they think the token is likely to be deemed a commodity instead of a security is interesting and could represent a newer trend in the industry.\n\nWith the SEC seemingly getting more aggressive in its attempts to bring more cryptocurrencies under its purview, investors may start to favor those that they view as commodities. While I still like Ethereum the best in this group of cryptocurrencies, this is certainly a trend that bears watching."

        "content": "Since the collapse of FTX in November, the conversation around crypto has been dominated by dark mutterings about its demise or endless chatter over regulation. That\u2019s why it was refreshing to speak to Joe Lubin, one of the cofounders of Ethereum who is now best known for overseeing ConsenSys, which has evolved from a chaotic crypto incubator to a software company known for the popular MetaMask wallet.\n\nUnlike many in the industry, Lubin is brimming with optimism. He still espouses the original gospel of Ethereum, which celebrates decentralized software projects and views blockchains as a vehicle for a new political and social order beyond the reach of Big Tech. In our recent chat, he told me he\u2019s untroubled by the fallout from FTX, which wiped out the likes of Voyager, Celsius, and other centralized crypto services.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t consider them real crypto companies. They co-opted our messaging to cheat naive consumers,\u201d says Lubin, suggesting the troubles of the past nine months amounted in part to a healthy cleansing.\n\nHe added that the demise of the centralized services has helped true crypto companies focus and rebuild, paving the way for \u201cour broadband moment\u201d\u2014an analogy for when widespread fiber build-outs helped millions of consumers appreciate the benefits of the internet. To this end, ConsenSys is rebranding\u2014replete with bright new colors\u2014with the goal of expanding its services beyond a select group of developers and end users. Lubin says the new focus will be on making crypto tools ever easier to use and empowering people of all stripes to participate in building a new version of the web, based around people, not data-gobbling monopolies.\n\nA lot of what Lubin had to say echoes the theories put forth by venture capitalist and Web3 evangelist Chris Dixon prior to crypto\u2019s massive downturn. I\u2019m not sure how much of this I buy\u2014especially since governments and old-line tech companies seem as powerful as ever, and as much of the public has soured on crypto. For now, it might be more prudent for the crypto industry to focus less on Web3 utopias and more on ensuring that people stop getting robbed.\n\nThat said, Lubin made a strong case that crypto is on the cusp of a new breakthrough to follow the sudden rise of DeFi and then of NFTs. He says the area to watch right now is wallets, especially as companies like Coinbase start building \u201cwallet as a service\u201d tools intended to make it easier for firms of any kind to integrate crypto into their operations. This doesn\u2019t feel far-fetched given how giant brands like Starbucks, Nike, and Reddit are also quietly using crypto and NFTs behind the scenes.\n\nIn the broader picture, though, Lubin\u2019s sunny vision feels far-fetched in many regards, but if even a portion of it is true, then the crypto industry is indeed poised for another big leap forward.\n\nA quick programming note: There will be no newsletter Monday or Tuesday given the July Fourth holiday. So have a safe and happy Independence Day, and to those of you north of the border, happy Canada Day. Go enjoy some hot dogs.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nBitcoin has been trading in a narrow range of $1,500 since hitting a 52-week high of $31,400 a week ago, a sign of ongoing strength, analysts say.

If there is a move below $1,820, the price could drop toward $1,790. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,740 support.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,820\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,880\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Cardano's co-founder Charles Hoskinson has taken a swipe at Ethereum, the blockchain he helped create, over its staking mechanism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a pointed tweet, Hoskinson responded to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin's comments on the complications of staking Ether, the blockchain's native cryptocurrency.\n\nHoskinson claimed that \"all of our ADA is staked,\" insinuating that this is how a correctly designed proof-of-stake protocol should operate.\n\nThe comments came in reply to a user question about the percentage of Hoskinson's ADA that was staked, compared to Buterin's Ether.\n\nButerin had previously admitted that he only staked a relatively small portion of his Ether, explaining that the process was complex.\n\nHe noted that staking Ether required the associated keys to be made public, a requirement that raises safety concerns. As a solution, multi-signature (multi-sig) transactions are recommended, but Buterin admits these are still somewhat difficult to set up. \"And you know, it gets complicated in a bunch of ways,\" he added.\n\nHoskinson's criticism is the latest in a series of swipes at Ethereum. As reported by U.Today, he previously called Ethereum \"a dumpster fire.\" He also forecast that Ethereum could lose its popularity in the same way as older apps like MySpace and Netscape. His prediction suggested that Ethereum might eventually become obsolete, much like those early Internet giants that were eventually superseded by more innovative solutions.\n\nThe Cardano founder has also boldly suggested that Ethereum might one day migrate to Cardano, citing the potential for Cardano to become a better, faster, and cheaper platform with higher liquidity and more users"

This contrasts with the high-value Ethereum NFT market, which has recently declined in trade volume.\n\nAccording to information provided by CryptoSlam, the sales of Solana NFTs on the secondary market generated close to $24.2 million over the previous day, while sales of Ethereum totaled $21.2 million.\n\nBlockchain sales by NFT volume | Source: CryptoSlam\n\nDespite the slight disparity between the platforms, this is the first time the smaller Solana market has surpassed Ethereum in terms of the dollar amount earned by sales over 24 hours in over one year. According to CryptoSlam, sales of Solana NFTs increased by 166.11% over that previous window\u2019s 24-hour period.\n\nYou might also like: Solana\u2019s Cardinal Protocol shuts down due to economic challenges\n\nLast year, Solana surpassed Ethereum in 24H sales volumes for the first time, reportedly fueled by Trippin\u2019 Ape Tribe.

As a result, it outperformed all other Ethereum and Solana initiatives during that time by a significant amount. Ethereum\u2019s Bored Ape Yacht Club, which generated $3.5 million in sales, came in second.\n\nOpenSea supports Solana NFTs\n\nSoon, these achievements might become more typical. In a recent fundraising round, OpenSea, a major NFT marketplace valued at $13.3 billion, announced that it would now support Solana NFTs. Before Polygon (MATIC) NFTs, OpenSea was only a marketplace for Ethereum NFTs. Shortly after, OpenSea\u2019s rival Rarible swiftly imitated OpenSea\u2019s actions and enabled Solana NFTs on its platform.\n\nEven though Solana is displaying several signs of growth, the Ethereum market continues to be considerably more valuable overall. According to CryptoSlam, Solana NFT trade volume over the past seven days has been close to $41 million, while Ethereum trading volume has been close to $166 million. The difference between Solana and Ethereum after 30 days considerably widen to about $380 million.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Layer3\n\nSan Jose, CA, June 30, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In the last few years of blockchain development, the Layer paradigm has been changing from Layer 0 to Layer 3. Not long ago, Ethereum founder VitalikButerin stressed the significance of Layer 3, saying that the architecture can optimize and improve the network. The heavy-hitting Layer 3 super public chain will link every blockchain to build a truly open, transparent, inclusive, fast and secure decentralized world.\n\n\n\n\u25ce The congestion problem under the Ethereum boom needs to be solved\n\nAs the most mainstream smart contract platform, Ethereum is known for its security and decentralized characteristics, but it still lags behind in terms of scalability: Ethereum's current TPS (the number of transactions that can be processed per second) is between 10 and 15, and the supply is insufficient and the demand is strong, resulting in high fees determined by bidding, and each transaction needs to spend several dollars to tens of dollars.\n\n\n\n\u5fae\u4fe1\u56fe\u7247_20230628162753\n\nIn other words, on the first layer of the Ethereum blockchain, the growing demand for network usage has led to network congestion and pushed up transaction costs.Increased storage, network speed, and throughput are fundamental to meaningful mass adoption of Ethereum. Decentralization, Security, Scalability, the three can only choose two, which is also known as the blockchain impossible triangle. Ethereum's initial choice was to abandon scalability and bring it into line with the most important values of Web3.0. But if you implement scalability in a clean and crude way, you sacrifice security or decentralization! In this context, the congestion problem under the Ethereum boom needs to be solved.\n\n\n\n\u25ceLayer 3 brings the perfect solution for Ethereum cross-chain scaling\n\nThe congestion problem of the Ethereum boom caught the world's attention, and Scaling was the solution - and that's where Layer 3 came into being. Layer 3 has been actively looking for Ethereum scalability solutions, and after the full research and development of the technical team, it has determined the cross-chain expansion route combining on-chain and off-chain expansion. Layer 3 combines cross-chain technology with Layer 1 and Layer 2 expansion solutions to bring a new chain expansion solution, support cross-chain interaction between major public chains, complete block transactions faster with lower GAS fees, and bring users a silky transaction experience.\n\n\n\nLayer 3, as an Ethereum expansion solution, aims to solve the congestion problem of Ethereum and realize the decentralized, low-cost and high-concurrency Ethereum ecosystem that people yearn for. It can be said that Layer 3 public chains start from the underlying algorithms and consensus protocols to help different public chains connect with each other and exchange value. Layer 3 public chain From the architecture design, to ensure that every public chain, even if there is no first-mover advantage, can be mirrored on the Layer 3 public chain, so that thousands of people understand and use.\n\n\n\nThe Layer 3 public chain's original series of core technologies build a cross-chain ecosystem integrating public chain, wallet, decentralized transaction, decentralized application and other layers to serve finance, artificial intelligence, metauniverse and other fields.\n\n\n\nIn short, the Layer 3 super public chain brings a new paradigm of the digital economy.\n\n\n\nFrom the perspective of technical architecture, Layer 3, like Layer 2, also contains the application Layer, and Layer 3 has better cross-chain interoperability, which means that there will be a lot of use cases that can be migrated to Layer 3.\n\n\n\nIn addition, for those types of use cases that require greater transaction throughput support and strong demand for further reducing network use costs, such as decentralized exchanges and blockchain games, transaction efficiency can also be improved on Layer 3 and real cost reduction and efficiency can be experienced.\n\n\n\nLayer 3's Ethereum cross-chain scaling solution has been tested to be the most secure and widely used scaling solution. The Layer 3 super public chain will truly link every blockchain and build an open, transparent, inclusive, fast and secure decentralized world.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompany\uff1aLayer Three Expansion Technology Inc\n\nWebsite:https://www.layer3.team\n\nTwitter\uff1ahttps://twitter.com/eth_layer_3\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, or intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Cancun Upgrade: ETH price to Reach $3000 soon? - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is preparing for a significant upgrade known as Cancun-Deneb (Dencun). This upgrade is expected to enhance the scalability, security, and usability of the Ethereum network. With these improvements on the horizon, many are speculating whether this could be the catalyst that propels Ethereum\u2019s price to the $3,000 mark.Let\u2019s take a look a this Ethereum Cancun upgrade.\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun Upgrade: What to Expect\n\nThe Cancun upgrade follows the recent activation of Shanghai, another significant upgrade to Ethereum\u2019s execution layer. The Cancun fork includes the highly anticipated Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, also known as \u201cProto-Danksharding.\u201d This feature is a milestone that lays the groundwork for full Danksharding implementation, which is expected to significantly enhance the network\u2019s scalability.\n\nThe Importance of Proto-Danksharding\n\nEthereum core developer P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi has emphasized the importance of Proto-Danksharding, stating that it should be the primary focus of the upgrade. Proto-Danksharding will act as an intermediate upgrade to help scale rollups on the network, a crucial step towards improving Ethereum\u2019s scalability and transaction speed.\n\nOther Key Features of the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun upgrade may also include several other Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), such as EIPs 4758, 6046, 6190, which involve the removal of the SELFDESTRUCT function, and EIP-663, which allows for unlimited SWAP and DUP instructions. Other potential features include EIP-5920, the PAY opcode, and EIP-1153, which introduces transient storage.\n\nUnderstanding Danksharding\n\nDanksharding is the third and final part of the ETH2/Serenity upgrade, following the successful rollout of the Beacon chain and The Merge. This new sharding architecture will replace the project\u2019s initially proposed idea of introducing 64 shard chains. Instead of increasing the number of transactions, Danksharding focuses on increasing data availability for rollups, a Layer 2 technology that bundles together blockchain transactions and processes them off-chain.\n\nThe Role of Proto-Danksharding\n\nProto-Danksharding, proposed by Ethereum developers Protolambda and Dankrad Feist, is an interim upgrade to the Ethereum network. It is described as a \u201cstopgap\u201d solution that will dramatically reduce rollup gas fees ahead of full sharding implementation. This feature introduces a transaction type called \u201cblob-carrying transactions,\u201d which can contain up to two blobs and will be more cost-effective than the current transaction data storage method.\n\nThe Impact of the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade\n\nThe Cancun upgrade aims to prepare the network for full data sharding while scaling rollups in the interim. The introduction of blob-carrying transactions will increase data availability for rollups and make them considerably cheaper. After the activation of Cancun, Ethereum users should expect faster, cheaper payments when using the ecosystem\u2019s native cryptocurrency, applications, and ERC-based tokens.\n\nCan Ethereum Reach $3,000?\n\nETH/USD Weekly- TradingView\n\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to predict with certainty, the Cancun upgrade could potentially be a significant catalyst for Ethereum\u2019s price. By enhancing the network\u2019s scalability, security, and usability, the upgrade could attract more users and developers to the Ethereum ecosystem, thereby increasing demand for ETH and potentially driving its price towards the $3,000 mark. However, as with all investments, it\u2019s essential to do your research and consider the risks before making any decisions.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Path to $3,000: A Predictive Analysis\n\nAs of today, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $1,855.58. To reach the $3,000 mark, it would need to increase by approximately 62%. This is a significant leap, but not an impossible one, especially when considering the potential impact of the upcoming Cancun upgrade.\n\nHistorically, major network upgrades have often led to increased demand for cryptocurrencies. For instance, Ethereum\u2019s price increased by about 60% in the two months leading up to the launch of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s Beacon Chain in December 2020. If the Cancun upgrade has a similar effect, it could potentially push Ethereum\u2019s price towards the $3,000 mark.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s increasing adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) could also contribute to price growth. As more users and developers flock to the Ethereum network to take advantage of these innovations, demand for ETH could increase, driving up its price.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum (ETH) is priced at $1,855.58. For Ethereum to reach the $3,000 mark from its current price, we need to calculate the percentage growth required.\n\nThe formula to calculate percentage growth is:\n\n((Target Price \u2013 Current Price) / Current Price) * 100\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n\n((3000 \u2013 1855.58) / 1855.58) * 100\n\nThis calculation results in a required growth of approximately 61.7%.\n\nIn simpler terms, Ethereum\u2019s current price needs to increase by about 61.7% to reach the $3,000 mark. This is a significant increase, but it\u2019s not unprecedented in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nFor instance, if we consider Ethereum\u2019s performance in 2021, it has shown periods of rapid growth. From January 2021 to May 2021, Ethereum\u2019s price increased from around $730 to a peak of over $4,000, representing a growth of over 450%.\n\nWhile past performance is not a guarantee of future results, it does illustrate Ethereum\u2019s potential for rapid price increases. With the upcoming Cancun upgrade and the continued growth of applications like DeFi and NFTs on the Ethereum network, a 61.7% increase to reach the $3,000 mark is within the realm of possibility. However, investors should always consider the inherent risks and volatility associated with cryptocurrency investments.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is important to note that this is a predictive analysis and not a guarantee. Cryptocurrency prices are influenced by a wide range of factors, including market sentiment, regulatory news, and broader economic trends. As such, while the $3,000 target is achievable, it\u2019s essential for investors to do their own research and consider the risks before making any decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

        "content": "Share:\n\nNFT sales on Solana exceeded that on the Ethereum blockchain for the first time in the two altcoin\u2019s history.\n\n24 hour NFT sales on the Solana blockchain exceeded $25.5 million while on the Ethereum blockchain it was capped at $24.5 million.\n\nEthereum creator Vitalik Buterin recently expressed his support for Solana and other ETH competitors.\n\nSolana ranks among the altcoins labeled as \u201csecurities\u201d by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC\u2019s clampdown on cryptocurrencies triggered a steep decline in SOL price and resulted in a delisting of the altcoin across crypto exchanges.\n\nThe total NFT sales on Solana exceeded that on Ethereum for the first time in the two altcoins\u2019 history.\n\nAlso read: Attorney John Deaton says Judge Torres decision on SEC vs. Ripple is important to crypto for this reason\n\nNFT trade on Solana explodes in a 24 hour timeframe\n\nThe total volume of NFT sales on the Solana blockchain crossed $25.5 million, based on data from tracker Sol Bulletin. At the same time, the NFT trade volume on the Ethereum blockchain exceeded $24.5 million, lagging behind Solana by nearly a million.\n\nNFT sales volume by blockchain\n\nFor the first time in the history of the two altcoin blockchains, Solana outperformed Ethereum. This is a key milestone for SOL as the asset is tackling selling pressure from the SEC\u2019s crackdown and series of delisting across crypto exchanges and social trading platforms.\n\nSolana price failed to catch up with the surge in the altcoin\u2019s NFT trade volume. Interestingly, the DeFi protocols building on the Solana ecosystem are no match for Ethereum, therefore the NFT sales volume supported the theory of rising adoption and utility of the SOL blockchain.\n\nDeFi data tracker DeFiLlama pegs the total volume locked (TVL) in the Ethereum blockchain at $26.7 billion, while for Solana it is a meager $265.57 million. If the NFT trade volume on the Solana blockchain continues rising, there is a likelihood of the protocol\u2019s TVL climbing in the long term, fueling SOL price recovery."

        "content": "A recently organized team of researchers, the \u200b\u200bSpecial Mechanisms Group (SMG), demonstrated Thursday how to take advantage of a facet of the proposer-builder separation market to force through an Ethereum block containing just one transaction: theirs.\n\nProposer-builder separation (PBS) is intended to increase censorship-resistance by separating the roles of block builders and block proposers in the more-or-less unceasing Ethereum blockchain. But the group found a way to use the feature to make a very public point.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThe block\u2019s lone transaction embedded a URL to a presentation and research paper on SMG\u2019s website, describing the problem and proposing potential ways to address it.\n\nReactions were decidedly mixed.\n\nRyan Berckmans, a former software engineer at Augur, was among many who pointed out that Ethereum\u2019s gas fee market would make it difficult to delay transactions using this method for long, but noted it did reveal certain problems in the way some applications on Ethereum calculate fees needed to get transactions included in a block.\n\n\u201cThe interesting thing about the quoted method is that to censor all transactions for one block, they only have to outbid priority fees.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nEthereum is designed to be \u201ccredibly neutral,\u201d and therefore any time user transactions can be prevented from being included in a block, it\u2019s cause for alarm.\n\n(Technically, post-Merge they\u2019re called \u201cslots,\u201d but the terms are interchangeable.)\n\nBut most people conceptualize \u201ccensorship\u201d as preventing a transaction permanently, not merely delaying it for a short time. It\u2019s also not a new problem.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThe SMG group disagrees.\n\n\u201cWhen bidders in an auction, or agents in a financial system can censor their competition, the efficiency of these systems erodes,\u201d they tweeted. \u201cIn other words, censorship-resistance is about more than just ensuring a transaction gets on-chain \u2018eventually.\u2019 It needs to be fast.\u201d\n\nSMG\u2019s head of research and one of the paper\u2019s authors, Max Resnick, told Blockworks, \u201cwe are more worried about 12 seconds being enough time to cause a problem than 10 mins,\u201d although he said the critics overestimate the cost of increasing the delay period further.\n\nEven on a short timeframe, however, \u201cthere are a lot of useful mechanisms (like auctions) that we can\u2019t build on chain because it would be easy for participants to censor their competition\u2019s bids,\u201d Resnick said.\n\nSome use cases that don\u2019t tolerate inclusion delays could migrate to layer-2s, but not all, he said.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s use enshrined PBS as an example, because that is an auction that we want to run on-chain and can\u2019t really be run on a rollup.\u201d\n\nEnshrined PBS, or ePBS, would implement PBS at the protocol level \u2014 the Ethereum mainnet consensus layer \u2014 but how to do this is an active research topic and remains a relatively distant prospect.\n\n\u201cThis is particularly relevant in auctions, but also applies to fraud proofs and oracle updates to a lesser extent,\u201d Resnick said.\n\nIn other words, this case implies that it may be hard to reduce the window for producing a fraud proof in optimistic rollups, although it does not impact ZK rollups.\n\n\u201cI think if we could make the base chain more censorship resistant, then optimistic rollups would have better user experience,\u201d Resnick said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin stakes a small amount of his ETH due to concerns about security and the complexity of staying safe.\n\nSpeaking on the Bankless Podcast, Buterin said he doesn\u2019t stake all his Ethereum, only \u201ca fairly small portion,\u201d because staking safely on the network requires multi-sig, which remains a tricky process.\n\n\u201cif you stake your ETH, the keys to access it have to be public on some system that\u2019s online. For safety, it has to be a multi-sig, and multi-sigs for staking are still fairly difficult to set up. It gets complicated in a bunch of ways.\u201d\n\nMulti-sig refers to requiring more than one user to sign and authorize a transaction. Therefore, crypto assets remain secure even if a private key is compromised.\n\nIn 2021, Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake said he doesn\u2019t stake all his ETH. Explaining why, he used a sausage-making analogy, adding that rare, unpredictable events also influenced his decision.\n\n\u201cwhen you make the sausage, you know how it\u2019s made, and there\u2019s a bunch of tail risk that\u2019s difficult to quantify.\u201d\n\nInput-Output CEO and Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson seized upon Buterin\u2019s comments, saying he stakes all of his ADA \u2013 taking the opportunity to infer Ethereum is not \u201cproperly designed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had to listen to this a few times. I\u2019m just at a loss for words. All of our Ada is staked. Guess what, that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be for a properly designed Proof of Stake protocol.\u201c\n\nHowever, Max Radeleus, the co-Founder of INTU, a protocol that introduced dEOAs (decentralized externally owned accounts) at ETHDenver this year, argued that Buterin might be underestimating what\u2019s possible with continued Ethereum innovation.\n\nEOAs are the most basic type of Ethereum accounts using a public and private key pair. INTU introduced a cryptographic method to split private keys without needing a smart contract wallet, the kind of account likely referenced by Buterin when talking about multi-sigs.\n\n\u201cAs Mr Buterin so succinctly highlights, secure solutions on chain are currently difficult; I mean if he has issues with it, who wouldn\u2019t? However, we\u2019re not done innovating on Ethereum yet! dEOAs make it simple to launch multi-party (MPC) accounts which solve many of Vitalik\u2019s issues here, and just perhaps, this is what is needed for further staking adoption.\u201d\n\nMentioned in this article"

In a remarkable twist, Solana has taken the center stage as it relates to the overall trading volume of its non-fungible tokens (NFTs) when compared to that of Ethereum.\n\nPer the data embedded in the screenshot shared by Sol Bulletin, Solana's NFT trading volume topped $25.5 million in a 24 hour range while that of Ethereum was pegged at $24.5 million. Notably, this bullish growth milestone is the first time Solana will be beating Ethereum in terms of total NFT trading volume.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 BREAKING NEWS: @solana JUST FLIPPED @ethereum IN 24 HOUR SALES VOLUME FOR THE 1ST TIME IN HISTORY. pic.twitter.com/MDB6UwZyfK \u2014 Sol Bulletin \ud83d\udccc (@SolBulletin) June 30, 2023\n\nComparing Solana and Ethereum ecosystems\n\nAs Layer-1 blockchain protocols, the duo of Ethereum and Solana both have decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. While Solana has a notable functional DeFi ecosystem, it is by no means a match for Ethereum.\n\nData from DefiLlama pegs the total value locked (TVL) on Ethereum at $26.7 billion, a figure that surpasses more than half of the entire industry TVL. Solana's TVL, on the other hand, is pegged at $265.57 million.\n\nTheir respective market capitalization is also a major distinguishing metric, with Ethereum's pegged at $231.17 billion while that of Solana is pegged at a mere $7.38 billion.\n\nEthereum has been tagged as the most liquid blockchain for smart contracts, and while Solana is an able contender, it is still miles apart. While Ethereum dominates in many ways, Solana's developers are arguably more laser focused on introducing unique real world utility into the protocol, which has led to the launch of the Saga Mobile Phone.\n\nObvious similarity\n\nWith the diversity in their ecosystem that makes them different, the duo of Solana and Ethereum are powered via the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model. Solana was designed as a PoS protocol from the start, but Ethereum transitioned to this new model from proof of work (PoW) through the Merge as the call for scalability and sustainability takes shape."

He expressed empathy over the issues they are dealing with, particularly with regulators marking certain cryptocurrencies as securities and the resulting effect on their market performance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a recent social media post, Buterin said, \"The one comment I'll make is that I feel bad that Solana and other projects are getting hit in this way. They don't deserve it, and if Ethereum ends up 'winning' through all other blockchains getting kicked off exchanges, that's not an honorable way to win, and in the long term probably isn't even a victory.\"\n\nThe one comment I'll make is that I feel bad that @solana and other projects are getting hit in this way.

If a cryptocurrency is labeled a security, it falls under a different regulatory framework, potentially limiting its market reach and disrupting its trading on many exchanges. This development has put pressure on Solana, which is currently under investigation by authorities for its possible classification as a security.\n\nMoreover, Solana has also been grappling with recovery after the FTX crash. While it managed to bounce back, the road to recovery has been steep and complicated by regulatory issues.\n\nButerin's empathetic sentiment sheds light on the challenges faced by the whole blockchain ecosystem. Instead of seeing this as a competitive struggle between Ethereum and other projects, he views the real competition as the expanding centralized world imposing itself on the blockchain and crypto space.\n\nIn his post, Buterin implied that Ethereum's victory would not be meaningful if it came at the expense of other projects getting kicked off exchanges due to regulatory pressures. He suggests that the entire industry should stand together to face the threats posed by the growing centralized world."

The move was significant for the cryptocurrency market as it provided institutional investors with a regulated platform to trade Bitcoin futures, allowing for greater mainstream adoption and potentially increased liquidity in the market.\n\nThe launch of Bitcoin futures on CME was, however, attributed to the consequent market slump though, although Tim McCourt, Global Head of Equity and FX Products at CME Group, dismissed such speculations.\n\nCME executive: Bitcoin futures did not tank market in 2017\n\nThe launch of Ethereum futures trading on CME followed in February 2021, which made it easier for institutional investors to gain exposure to the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nThe exchange saw over 151,000 Bitcoin, or $4.67 billion in current prices, allocated in Bitcoin futures contracts in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinGlass.\n\nEthereum futures at CME saw 226,000 ETH, or $429.2 million, over the span.\n\nOver the past several years, the CME Group also expanded its digital asset offerings to both Bitcoin and Ethereum options, as well as for micro BTC and micro ETH futures contracts."

At the time of writing, this stood at $9.78 billion, with Arbitrum [ARB] enjoying a 60% market share and a total value locked (TVL) of $5.87 billion.\n\nENS domain name purchases in Q2\n\nAccording to data from on-chain analytics platform Dune Analytics, monthly ENS domain name registrations totaled 79,463 last quarter.\n\nWith June marked by a steep fall in gas fees paid on the Ethereum Network, the month logged the highest count of registrations during the three-month period under review. Per data from Dune Analytics, 35,932 ENS name registrations were made in June alone.\n\nInterestingly, while monthly. eth name registrations ended Q2 with a rally, primary ENS name registrations experienced a significant decline. A primary ENS name is a unique domain name registered and associated with an Ethereum address on the ENS platform.\n\nFurther, protocol revenue logged a decline, according to Token Terminal. Notably, ENS registered a cumulative $4.8 million as profit between 1 April and 30 June. Inasmuch, its revenue dipped by 21% during this period.\n\nAccording to the data provider, on an annualized basis, ENS\u2019 revenue has fallen by 5.11%.\n\nIncreased purchase of ENS tokens\n\nA look at ENS\u2019 price performance on a daily chart revealed an uptick in ENS accumulation since the middle of June. Since then, the alt\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) indicators have been on an uptrend.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ENS worth today?\n\nIn the same position at press time, they rested at 56.24 and 73.90, respectively. Within the same period, ENS has logged a corresponding 22% growth in value.\n\nWith the alt\u2019s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator posting slightly elongated histogram bars and its MACD line resting above the trend line, a bullish run was underway at press time."

        "content": "Despite belonging to the same industry, the various networks in the crypto market often engage in conflicts. Ethereum [ETH], in particular, has faced criticism and backlash for its transition to the proof-of-stake [PoS] consensus mechanism. While Ethereum\u2019s staking mechanism has been successful, Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Cardano, took the opportunity to make a snide remark aimed at the second-largest cryptocurrency network.\n\nIn a tweet exchange, Charles Hoskinson called out Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum. This statement came in response to Buterin\u2019s comments about the challenges associated with staking Ether [ETH]. Buterin previously stated that only a small portion of his Ether is staked as it gets complicated. Buterin pointed out that staking Ethereum involves the need to make the associated keys public, which raises concerns about security. To address this, he suggested using multi-signature transactions. However, he admitted that setting them up can still be challenging.\n\nHoskinson emphasized that all of Cardano\u2019s native token ADA is staked. This statement implied that Cardano\u2019s proof-of-stake protocol is well-designed and functioning effectively. This was done by indirectly highlighting potential flaws in Ethereum\u2019s approach.\n\nI had to listen to this a few times. I'm just at a loss for words. All of our Ada is staked. Guess what that's how it's supposed to be for a properly designed Proof of Stake protocol. https://t.co/ye6va1DH06 June 29, 2023\n\nEthereum\u2019s deposit contract value hits all new high\n\nFollowing the implementation of the Shanghai upgrade, which introduced the ability to withdraw staked Ethereum, there has been a notable increase in the number of individuals opting to lock their coins in beacon deposit contracts. This surge in staked Ethereum is evident as the amount has rapidly grown and has set a new record since the update.\n\nThe number of Ethereum that has been staked has now surged to 25.8 million ETH, marking a new all-time high ATH. At present, this staked amount is valued at over $48 billion.\n\nAmidst this, Ethereum continued to struggle to hit $2,000. At press time, the second largest crypto asset was trading for $1,889.79 with a 2.66% daily surge."

        "content": "Liquid Staking Tokens control 41% of staked ETH, raising concerns about dependency and leveraging risks.\n\nLido and Rocket Pool dominate, witnessing increased interest in stETH and rETH tokens.\n\nLiquid Staking Derivative protocols have been increasingly occupying the DeFi space, gradually becoming dominant players in the Ethereum[ETH] staking arena. As a result, the tokens associated with these protocols experienced a massive surge in interest and adoption.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nLSTs on the rise\n\nAccording to Kate Young Ju, an analyst on CryptoQuant, Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) have successfully utilized 41% of the total ETH staked in the ecosystem. This high level of utilization raises concerns, as it indicates a significant dependency on this particular form of staking.\n\nFurthermore, it was worth noting that these LSTs were leveraged by a factor of 2, introducing potential dangers and weaknesses to the ecosystem. Leveraging amplifies both gains and losses, making investments more volatile and susceptible to market fluctuations. This increased risk can pose challenges for participants involved in LSTs and may impact the stability and resilience of the ecosystem as a whole.\n\nAt press time, the largest players in this sector were Lido and Rocket Pool. The staked ETH tokens associated with both protocols, stETH and rETH respectively, witnessed a notable surge in interest and usage. This surge was evident from the growing number of token holders, indicating an increasing interest among various addresses.\n\nIn addition to the growing number of token holders, the velocity of these tokens also witnessed an uptick. This suggested that the frequency with which these tokens were being transferred and used also increased, reflecting a higher level of activity within the ecosystem.\n\nEthereum plays a big role\n\nHowever, it was essential to highlight that the growth of Liquid Staking Tokens was not solely driven by their own appeal, but also by the broader interest in the Ethereum protocol and ETH. Users are increasingly drawn to Ethereum, contributing to the rising traction and adoption of Liquid Staking Tokens.\n\nOver the past month, the revenue generated by validators witnessed a significant decrease of 62.07%. Despite a decline in revenue for validators on the Ethereum network, the number of validators experienced a notable surge of 7.65% in the last 30 days, reaching a count of 637,732 according to Staking Rewards\u2019 data. This sustained interest in staking remains intact, even in the face of falling revenue.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nAs for the price of Ethereum, it was trading at $1,855.10 at press time according to CoinMarketCap\u2019s data. It experienced a slight decline of 0.2% in the last 24 hours. Additionally, its trading volume decreased by 28.20% during the same period."

        "title": "Why Are People Burning CryptoPunks for Ordinals NFTs? - nft now",
        "content": "On June 17, CryptoPunk #8611 was permanently removed from circulation. The NFT, which had recently sold for 54.49 ETH (just over $94,000 at the time), was soon after transferred to an Ethereum burn address, meaning it can never be recovered. From there, a digital asset visually similar to the original CryptoPunk was inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain as an Ordinal, that ecosystem\u2019s version of an NFT, and then sent to a Satoshi wallet. Moreover, anyone who burns a Punk will receive an allowlist spot for a new Bitcoin Ordinals collection: Ordinal Maxi Biz.\n\nThe event has raised Web3\u2019s collective eyebrow, and for good reason. Punk #8611 isn\u2019t the only Ethereum-based NFT or NFT project to make an appearance in the Bitcoin Ordinals ecosystem, and it certainly won\u2019t be the last. But CryptoPunks are no regular NFT collection. One of the first projects minted on the Ethereum blockchain, the OG PFP project from Larva Labs has achieved an iconic status not only within the crypto art world but in the world of fine art collecting as well. They\u2019re also obscenely valuable as a digital asset, as the lower end of the collection will cost you a cool 44.9 ETH ($86,000 at the time of writing).\n\nSo, why exactly are people burning these legendary and costly Ethereum NFTs? To answer that, we need to look at who\u2019s behind the Ordinal Maxi Biz project, their aim, and how this could affect the original CryptoPunks collection.\n\nWho\u2019s behind the CryptoPunks burn trend?\n\nThe buyers of Punk #8611 are part of a Web3 collective called Bitcoin Bandits, an Ordinals project of pixelated NFT characters led by Natan Stein. Stein has spent the last month leading an unspecified number of Bitcoin Ordinals enthusiasts in their mission to collectively buy a CryptoPunk and \u201cmove\u201d it to the realm of Ordinals Inscriptions. While it\u2019s impossible to translate an NFT from one blockchain to another like this, you can burn an Ethereum NFT (taking it out of circulation) and create its visual equivalent as an Ordinal on Bitcoin, which is what happened with Punk #8611. From a surface-level perspective, the NFT disappeared from one and appeared on the other.\n\nThe burning of CryptoPunks is part gall and part belief in the historicity of the Bitcoin\u2019s Ordinals NFT movement, something that has split the Bitcoin community in two: Bitcoin purists, who oppose Ordinals (sometimes referred to as Bitcoin maxis), and those who welcome the change.\n\nHolders from @banditsbtc are crowdfunding to burn a CryptoPunk\n\n\n\nThe idea is to use @an_app_by_bb to burn a Punk on ETH, inscribe it on BTC and send it to Satoshi wallet!\n\n\n\n+ win @OrdinalMaxiBiz WL\n\n\n\nLet`s underunstand how the process will workhttps://t.co/dIekg2YaMF pic.twitter.com/b8IS1GMQoN \u2014 NatanStein (@natan_stein) June 16, 2023 TLDR:\n\n\n\n1 Share (0.01 BTC) = 1 Fraction of a CryptoPunk + 1 Fraction of a OMB\n\n\n\nMake history joining us on Phase #1https://t.co/dIekg2YaMF \u2014 NatanStein (@natan_stein) June 16, 2023\n\nBut the move also includes two other aims. For Bitcoin Ordinals enthusiasts, the first goal is to emphasize that blockchain\u2019s potential for innovation in the NFT space. While the blockchain is far older than Ethereum, the latter has, without question, been at the forefront of NFTs for years. With the introduction of the Ordinals protocol in January of this year, a major shift has occurred, and many Web3 enthusiasts believe a golden age for the Bitcoin ecosystem is on the horizon.\n\nLikewise, a portion of Bitcoin Ordinals supporters believe in shaking up the ossified cultural lines that divide the two NFT ecosystems. Burning such well-known and respected NFTs and inscribing them on the Bitcoin as Ordinals, they claim, is a bold and symbolic way to achieve this, though few in the Ethereum ecosystem see it that way.\n\nCredit: OMB\n\nOn June 15, the team behind Bitcoin Bandits opened up their burn site for CryptoPunks, offering Punk holders an Ordinal Maxi Biz allowlist spot in return for inscribing their highly-valued Ethereum NFT to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Punk #8611 was the first to cross the threshold, leaving the Ethereum chain forever. #8611 was also fractionalized, and its ownership is split between the individuals who raised money to buy the original Ethereum NFT. A few days later, CryptoPunk #9146 followed suit.\n\nCryptoPunk #8611. Credit: Larva Labs CryptoPunk #9146. Credit: Larva Labs\n\nOrdinal Maxi Biz\n\nThe Ordinals collection that CryptoPunk burners received allowlist spots for is Ordinal Maxi Biz, a project from zk shark and Web3 historian Nullish consisting of roughly-sketched heads with varying traits, including red, green, and blue eyes drawn by Tony Tafuro. Red-eyed OMBs were the first in the collection, with blue-eyed OMBs being added later and inscribed on Bitcoin Block 78, which was created in 2009.\n\nWith a recent introduction of 1,900 green-eyed pieces (inscribed on Block 9, one of the blocks mined by Bitcoin\u2019s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto), the collection currently stands at 2.1k pieces and has a healthy total trading volume on Magic Eden\u2019s Ordinals marketplace of over 173.44 BTC ($5.3 million). Top sales include OMB #27 for 3.33 BTC ($88,321) and OMB #64 for 3.2 BTC ($83,453). The collection features no enforced royalties or metadata changes and will never move to another chain, according to a collection manifesto posted by the team in March.\n\nOMB NFTs. Credit: Magic Eden\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nNot everyone is pleased with what Bitcoin Bandits and OMB are doing to the legacy Ethereum collection, with some members of the CryptoPunks community expressing disbelief that people would ever consider burning the NFTs for the new Bitcoin Ordinals collection. Some have speculated that reducing the supply of Ethereum CryptoPunks could drive the price of that collection up, though not many seem pleased with the prospect even if it does occur, given the cultural and historical ramifications of burning a CryptoPunk.\n\nBut Bitcoin Bandits isn\u2019t satisfied with just going after CryptoPunks, either. On June 27, the team tweeted out a call for people to burn their Azuki NFTs to bring them over to the Bitcoin ecosystem in just the same way.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let your beautiful Azuki NFTs get diluted with Elementals, bring them to Bitcoin,\u201d the team wrote in a seeming attempt to capitalize on the recent controversy surrounding Azuki\u2019s troubled Elementals mint.\n\nOrdinals Maxi Biz is still a relatively young Ordinals collection, and it remains to be seen just how its existence and gravity affect CryptoPunks in the long run. Regardless, the pull of the Ordinals protocol continues to be one of the dominant forces in the crypto art world and might just be getting started."

Additionally, looking at the position of ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI), it could be stated that there was significant buying pressure in the market. This was because ETH\u2019s RSI stood at 60.25 and was seen moving towards the overbought zone.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today\n\nAdditionally, ETH\u2019s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line (blue) stood above the signal line (red) above the zero line. This indicated a strong bullish movement for ETH. However, despite the bulls supporting ETH as of 30 June, traders should maintain caution.\n\nThis was because ETH\u2019s Awesome Oscillator (AO) flashed red bars above the zero line. A slight dip in the buying pressure may drive changes to the position of the indicators and a price correction for ETH."

        "title": "Market Activity Shows Whales Are Favouring InQuebta (QUBE) over Ethereum (ETH) and Polygon (MATIC) as Analysts ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The crypto market is filled with excitement as investors and industry insiders closely watch the movement of whales, those with significant crypto holdings, who have been making strategic bets on promising projects. InQubeta (QUBE) has emerged as a dark horse, captivating the attention of whales who are choosing it over established crypto giants like Ethereum (ETH) and Polygon (MATIC) to potentially make exponential gains in 2023.\n\nWe explore the reasons why whales are flocking to InQubeta, its unique features, and the potential for significant growth, positioning it as an enticing investment opportunity.\n\nInQubeta: Disrupting the AI Funding Landscape\n\nInQubeta is revolutionizing the AI funding landscape by providing an ecosystem that connects AI startups with investors. Here\u2019s why whales are favoring InQubeta over Ethereum and Polygon:\n\nInnovative Fractionalized NFTs: InQubeta introduces fractionalized non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that enable investors to participate in funding AI projects. By fractionalizing NFTs, investors can gain exposure to high-potential startups with a smaller investment, spreading their risk across multiple projects. This democratized approach to AI funding appeals to whales who seek diversification and the potential for substantial returns. QUBE Token: Utility and Governance: InQubeta\u2019s native token, QUBE, plays a crucial role within the ecosystem. It serves as both a utility token for accessing services and a governance token, allowing holders to participate in decision-making processes. Whales recognize the value of QUBE in driving the ecosystem\u2019s growth and actively seek to accumulate the token, driving up demand and potentially increasing its value over time. Experienced Team and Advisors: InQubeta boasts a team of experienced professionals with deep expertise in the AI and blockchain industries. Their knowledge and connections position InQubeta for success, attracting whales who recognize the importance of a strong team in executing the project\u2019s vision. Additionally, the project has secured influential advisors who provide guidance and open doors to potential partnerships, further bolstering its appeal to whales. Burn Mechanism and Scarcity: InQubeta has implemented a burn mechanism for QUBE tokens, gradually reducing the token supply over time. This burn strategy creates scarcity and potentially contributes to price appreciation, attracting whales who anticipate a limited supply and increased demand for QUBE tokens in the future.\n\nInQubeta vs. Ethereum and Polygon: Differentiating Factors\n\nWhile Ethereum and Polygon are established players in the crypto market, InQubeta offers unique differentiating factors that attract whales:\n\nNiche Focus on AI: InQubeta focuses specifically on the AI industry, catering to a niche market with immense potential for growth. Whales recognize the significance of AI advancements and the transformative impact it can have across various sectors. By betting on InQubeta, they position themselves at the forefront of this disruptive industry, potentially reaping significant rewards. Early-Stage Investment Opportunities: InQubeta\u2019s ecosystem provides whales with early-stage investment opportunities in AI startups. This allows them to get in on the ground floor of potentially groundbreaking projects, maximizing their potential returns. In contrast, Ethereum and Polygon, being more mature platforms, may offer fewer opportunities for early-stage investments. Ecosystem and Community Development: InQubeta fosters a vibrant ecosystem and community where startups, investors, and AI enthusiasts converge. This collaborative environment creates opportunities for networking, knowledge sharing, and potential partnerships. Whales recognize the value of being part of a thriving community and the potential for additional growth and opportunities that it brings.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith its innovative AI funding ecosystem, fractionalized NFTs, utility and governance token (QUBE), and experienced team, InQubeta presents a unique investment opportunity that appeals to whales seeking exponential gains in 2023. While Ethereum and Polygon have their own merits, InQubeta\u2019s niche focus, early-stage investment potential, and community-driven approach make it an enticing choice for whales looking to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on the transformative power of AI.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "He suspects investors may be less concerned about inflation, and more interested in tilting towards potential revenue opportunities in AI. \u201cIt could just be that there is a level of mean reversion and some of the assets with the biggest falls from 2022 are bouncing back for no reason other than they fell quickly,\u201d Mr Brycki added.\n\nThe second-highest performing ETF this financial year, the Global X Fang+ ETF was one of the worst performing in the 2022 calendar year, returning -37.02 per cent. Similarly, the provider\u2019s ultra-long Nasdaq 100 hedge fund returned 42 per cent in the financial year to June 23, but was down 70.36 per cent over the 12 months to December 31.\n\nGlobal X Australia head of investment strategy Blair Hannon said there had been a \u201csubstantial\u201d change in market sentiment for mega-cap tech stocks in the United States between 2022 and 2023. \u201cYou would have to live under a rock to avoid being inundated with news on generative AI and many of the FANG+ names are at the forefront of this trend,\u201d he said.\n\nNvidia\u2019s position as one of the leading companies producing AI hardware, coupled with Google and Microsoft\u2019s decisions to implement AI into their search engines also boosted the ETF, Mr Hannon added.\n\nBetaShares\u2019 global robotics and AI ETF also returned 39.6 per cent in the 12 months to June 23, 2023, but, likewise, was down 38.31 per cent over 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLosers\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Global X\u2019s ultra-short Nasdaq 100 hedge fund, Betashares\u2019 crude oil, currency hedged synthetic ETF and the Global X physical palladium ETF were the worst performers, followed by BetaShares US equities currency hedged ETF.\n\nHowever, in 2022, Global X\u2019s ultra-short Nasdaq 100 fund, and Betashares\u2019 crude oil and US equities currency hedged ETFs were among the 10 products with the highest returns.\n\nMr Hannon said Global X\u2019s ultra-short Nasdaq ETF struggled simply because the Nasdaq itself was performing well.\n\n\u201cIt is actually performing exactly as it is designed to do. This does underscore the need for investors to understand how geared ETFs work, so they can use them effectively in a portfolio,\u201d he said.\n\nStockspot\u2019s Mr Brycki said the lesson for investors is to simply pay \u201cno attention\u201d to one-year returns, as they have no bearing on future performance, \u201cor even whether some products are investible\u201d.\n\n\u201cInstead investors should be focusing on the areas that they can control when investing: diversification, costs and their own behaviour.\u201d"

        "content": "After a week-long rally, the crypto market is taking a breather. Most cryptocurrencies that were on a surge are seeing minor market corrections. Bitcoin (BTC) is still trading above $30,000, and Ethereum (ETH) is trading above $1800. A price analysis of both suggests another rally is on the way.\n\nHowever, both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have huge market capitalizations. They have already had years of explosive growth. They may still show profits, but they will be minor.\n\nTMS Network (TMSN), on the other hand, is a newly launched small-cap cryptocurrency with a great value proposition. This sets it up for a robust rally. Industry experts forecast a 100-fold increase during the upcoming bull run. This has made the token a hot pick among investors in its ongoing presale.\n\nTMS Network (TMSN) is a newly launched decentralized trading platform with many unique features, including margin trading, social trading, and an integrated derivatives market. This has made it attractive to traders looking for a more seamless and enjoyable trading experience.\n\nRead on as we examine expert projections for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), as well as the potential of TMS Network (TMSN) as a more promising pick.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction\n\nLast week, Bitcoin (BTC) embarked on a remarkable rally, temporarily surpassing the $31,000 mark to signal a comeback. The spike began shortly after BlackRock announced the launch of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). This was quickly followed by similar announcements from Fidelity Digital Assets and Citadel Securities. The resulting excitement caused Bitcoin (BTC) to rise 16.5% in one week, setting a new yearly high.\n\nThe current price of Bitcoin (BTC) is $30,519, with a daily trading volume of $13,551,974,388 and a market cap of $592,467,241,402. Bitcoin (BTC) has gained 1.67% in the last 24 hours and 3.79% in the last week. It is the largest cryptocurrency in the entire ecosystem, with a 50.4% market share.\n\nBitcoin is facing significant resistance at the $30,700 and $30,932 levels. If Bitcoin (BTC) breaks over this level, it will reclaim $31,000, with the next resistance level at $31,190.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Prediction\n\nEthereum (ETH) has managed to maintain a generally bullish year despite all the turmoil. ETH has traded above the crucial support level of $1075 for the better part of 2023.\n\nThe recent buzz surrounding Bitcoin ETFs spilled over to Ethereum (ETH), creating an upward trend that saw the token trade between $1,872.94 and $1,932.53 last week. Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $1,849.58, with a daily trading volume of $6,350,186,741. It is the second largest cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin (BTC), with a market valuation of $222,332,625,253. Ethereum (ETH) holds a market share of 18.9%.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has dropped 1.51% in the last 24 hours and 2.09% in the last seven days.\n\nIn a bullish scenario, Ethereum (ETH) should grow by 0.10% during the next week, reaching $ 1,858.24. ETH faces resistance around $1,868.03, $1,904.49, and the highest resistance at $1,932.53.\n\nTMS Network (TMSN) is more Attractive For Explosive Gains\n\nWhile Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum promise around 10% growth, TMS Network (TMSN) is on course for nearly 500%. TMSN has recently been dominating in presale, hitting one milestone after another. The presale recently surpassed $6.2 million, with more investors continuing to make deposits.\n\nTMS Network (TMSN) not only has the potential for explosive growth, but it also has a strong value proposition. The trading ecosystem is brimming with tools to help traders maximize profits. These include strategy builders, MT4 and MT5 compatibility, and on-chain analytics.\n\nThe platform goes to great lengths to accommodate even novice traders. Anyone can follow and copy the most successful traders on the TMS Network (TMSN) Social Trading Network and profit from their trades. The platform also provides trading classes that instruct users from the most fundamental notions of price analysis up to a pro-level, helping them become better traders.\n\nFinally, TMS Network (TMSN) offers a unique revenue-sharing model that ties everything together. Holders of TMSN tokens earn commissions on trading volumes generated by other traders on the platform. This encourages increased trading activity, which generates more revenue for the platform and token holders.\n\nOverall, TMS Network (TMSN) is an exciting project with the potential to shift the way people trade derivatives and turn token holders into millionaires. The network\u2019s ongoing presale campaign provides a fantastic opportunity to purchase the TMSN token at a discount and enjoy explosive gains once the project launches into the market.\n\nFor more information on TMS Network (TMSN):\n\nPresale: https://presale.tmsnetwork.io/\n\nWebsite: https://tmsnetwork.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/tmsnetworkio\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/tmsnetwork_io\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "After the successful deployment of the Shapella upgrade that enabled staking withdrawals, the Ethereum (ETH) development team is preparing for the launch of the Dencun upgrade, expected in late 2023, which promises to bring lots of new updates and could even lead to an ETH price hike.\n\nSpecifically, \u2018Dencun\u2019 is a joint term for two major Ethereum upgrades \u2013 Cancun, which is the upgrade to Ethereum\u2019s execution layer (EL), and Deneb, which refers to the consensus layer (CL) upgrade, as described in an article published by Ethereum-focused cryptocurrency market news site EtherWorld on June 24.\n\nAs it happens, the Cancun upgrade introduces several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) focused on improving storage, scalability, and optimizing gas efficiency, such as through the regulation of block rewards and delaying the gradual increase in Ethereum mining difficulty for a smooth transition to Ethereum 2.0.\n\nAt the same time, Deneb focuses on expanding the size and efficiency of the Ethereum blockchain, with one notable EIP that aims to upgrade its proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm toward increasing its power and improving user experience.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nWhile the Ethereum crypto community eagerly awaits this major overhaul, the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is currently $1,888.99, recording an increase of 1.13% in the last 24 hours, 0.49% across the previous seven days, and 1.19% in its monthly chart, as per data on June 30.\n\nETH 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nTaking into account all the advances and innovations that Dencun aims to unlock, the price of Ethereum could react to this major upgrade as it nears, as well as after the development team fully deploys it, particularly as the token continues to gain investors\u2019 confidence as a go-to asset for passive income.\n\nIndeed, taking into account the best-case scenario data from the historical Ethereum Rainbow price chart patterns, the price of ETH, as the end of the year nears, could actually skyrocket toward $5,000 and even end up in the zone of around $7,000. However, if a more bearish chart pattern reoccurs, then ETH could well remain in the $1,880 area.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Network Fees Experience Significant Growth In 2023 Q2, Here\u2019s Why | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "The Ethereum ecosystem had a positive run in the second quarter of 2023. From the Shapella upgrade in April to May\u2019s memecoin frenzy, there was a lot of buzz surrounding the most prominent smart contract blockchain.\n\nThis was reflected in the network\u2019s on-chain activity and gas fees. According to the quarterly report by blockchain analytics company IntoTheBlock, Ethereum recorded an 83% increase in network fees in the past three months.\n\nEthereum Network Fees Surge Due To Memecoin Frenzy\n\nThe network fee surge experienced by the Ethereum network has been linked to the rise of Ethereum-based memecoins in the Q2 of 2023. In the last few months, new memecoins, like APED, BOBO, PEPE, etc., have taken over the market, with some of these tokens recording huge gains.\n\nAccording to an IntoTheBlock report, speculative activity in the memecoin market is one of the major forces behind the elevated Ethereum network fees.\n\nThe impact of memecoins on Ethereum\u2019s network activity was so high that it caused a shift in the top gas-burning altcoins at some point in April. Meme tokens, such as TROLL, APED, and BOBO, were amongst the top 10 gas-burning altcoins, displacing popular assets, like ETH, Wrapped ETH (WETH), and USDT, from their positions, according to a Santiment analysis.\n\nInterestingly, Bitcoin also saw increased network fees in 2023\u2019s second quarter, resulting from creating tokens via the BRC-20 standard. IntoTheBlock\u2019s report revealed that Bitcoin fees increased by over 300% in the second quarter \u2013 the highest since Q2 2021.\n\nQuarterly Update: #Bitcoin transaction fees increased 4x compared to last quarter, marking the highest increase since Q2 2021. The surge is primarily driven by Ordinals-related activity.\n\nStay tuned, we\u2019ll share more updates on this past quarter in the coming days. pic.twitter.com/sUuilxWBNN \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) June 30, 2023\n\nIt is worth noting that the Ethereum network fees have cooled since the May highs, returning to a range of 15-20 Gwei in recent weeks.\n\nETH Supply Reached All-Time Low In May\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s network fees rose in May, the supply of Ether tanked, reaching its all-time low. According to IntoTheBlock\u2019s analysis, Ether\u2019s annualized net issuance rate dropped as low as 3.75% during the memecoin frenzy.\n\nFollowing the Merge last September, the amount of ETH issued per block dipped by 90%, making Ether more prone to deflation during fee spikes. Notably, the ETH supply trend has stabilized since the network fees dropped back into the normal range.\n\nSource: IntoTheBlock\n\nAccording to CoinGecko data, ETH trades at $1,935, gaining 4.6% in the past 24 hours. The token is the second-largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of roughly $233 billion.\n\nETHUSD trading at $1,922 | Source: ETHUSD chart from TradingView"

        "title": "Solana (SOL) Still Standing: Can It Challenge Ethereum (ETH) in the Long Run? - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "Solana has emerged as a serious contender to Ethereum due to its high speed, low transaction fees, and scalability.\n\nSolana\u2019s key innovations, including Proof-of-History (PoH), Tower Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), and Turbine, enhance its performance and network throughput.\n\nAccording to a report from the Finance Feed on Binance, Ethereum has been a significant player in the blockchain industry, particularly in the realms of decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi). However, its scalability issues and high transaction fees have opened the door for other networks to compete. Solana, a blockchain network, has quickly gained attention for its high speed, low fees, and scalability, positioning itself as a promising alternative to Ethereum.\n\nSolana\u2019s Advantages Over Ethereum\n\nCompared to Ethereum, Solana stands out with its high speed, low transaction fees, and scalability. It has achieved this by building scalability into its Layer 1, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which rely on Layer 2 solutions. Additionally, Solana utilizes a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, offering greater scalability and energy efficiency compared to Bitcoin\u2019s energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism.\n\nKey Innovations Enhancing Solana\u2019s Performance\n\nSolana has introduced key design innovations that enhance its performance. First, the Proof-of-History (PoH) protocol establishes a chronological timeline for transactions, reducing transaction overhead and increasing network throughput. Tower Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) reduces network latency and enhances speed and efficiency. Finally, the Turbine protocol implements data sharding, increasing the network\u2019s capacity to handle large traffic volumes.\n\nChallenges and Concerns\n\nDespite its performance advantages, Solana has faced security concerns and network outages due to excessive transactions. To address these issues, Solana has partnered with Jump Crypto to build a new validator client, aiming to increase the network\u2019s throughput capacity. The successful mitigation of these issues will be crucial for Solana\u2019s long-term success.\n\nThe Quest for Mass Adoption\n\nTo challenge Ethereum and achieve mass adoption, Solana needs to maintain scalability and infrastructure as the user base and number of transactions increase. Interoperability with other blockchains through technologies like the Wormhole bridge will attract users and developers. Additionally, fostering a strong developer community to build diverse dApps will be essential for Solana\u2019s growth.\n\nThe Investor\u2019s Perspective\n\nOne anonymous crypto investor believes Solana still has the potential to challenge Ethereum. The investor questions whether Ethereum\u2019s 40x larger market cap truly reflects its superiority and suggests that Solana could become a strong competitor if it continues to innovate, provide better scalability, lower costs, and attract more dApps.\n\nConclusion\n\nSolana has emerged as a serious competitor to Ethereum, offering high speed, low transaction fees, and scalability. While challenges remain, addressing security concerns, maintaining scalability, fostering interoperability, and building a vibrant developer community will be crucial for Solana\u2019s long-term success. With its promising position in the blockchain industry, Solana has the potential to become a leading Layer 1 blockchain and challenge Ethereum\u2019s dominance.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "content": "After the Shanghai upgrade enabled staked Ethereum (ETH) withdrawals, more people are choosing to lock up their coins in beacon deposit contracts, demonstrated by the fact that since the update, the amount of staked Ethereum has increased rapidly and set a new record.\n\nSpecifically, the amount of Ethereum staked has reached a new all-time high (ATH) as it surpassed 25.8 million ETH, currently worth over $48 billion, according to the recent data shared by the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry analytics platform CryptoRank in a tweet on June 29.\n\nEthereum deposit contract value. Source: CryptoRank\n\nNotably, the Ethereum deposit contract balance had crossed the value of $40 billion in late May, demonstrating a sharp move upward since the introduction of the critical feature that was not present during Ethereum\u2019s transition from the proof-of-work (PoW) to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism after the Merge upgrade.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum was at press time changing hands at the price of $1,885.63. This represents an increase of 2.08% in the last 24 hours, a 0.24% gain across the previous seven days, and an advance of 0.80% on its monthly chart, as per the latest information retrieved on June 30.\n\nEthereum 24-hour price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nRecently, the richest Ethereum non-exchange addresses have been growing their holdings while the top exchange addresses marked record lows, near genesis levels, illustrating fears of further lawsuits against crypto exchanges, as Finbold reported on June 27.\n\nIndeed, after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued crypto trading platforms Coinbase and Binance, fears seem to have caused an increase in the migration of digital assets off them, including the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset, Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum naming system developers plan to utilize off-chain resolvers.\n\nENS achieved an impressive milestone of over 2.2 million registered domain names.\n\nDuring a community call on Thursday, ENS Labs, the Ethereum Name Service developer (ENS), announced its plans to integrate Layer 2 interoperability with ENS domains. This decentralized domain name system, built on the Ethereum blockchain, aims to enhance its functionality by enabling seamless communication between Layer 2 solutions and ENS domains.\n\nThe team emphasized the significance of Layer 2 interoperability as a vital upcoming enhancement. Layer 2 solutions, such as Arbitrum and Optimism, improve scalability and reduce costs by facilitating off-chain transaction processing separate from the Layer 1 Ethereum blockchain.\n\nRecognizing the importance of accessibility, the team aims to enable the interaction between Layer 2 solutions and ENS domains. This initiative seeks to broaden the user base by making domain name registrations and transactions more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nENS\u2019s Plans for Layer 2 Interoperability\n\nAs Ethereum gained popularity, the surge in gas prices prompted market participants to seek more economical alternatives. Among these alternatives is the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which had previously expressed its plans to implement Layer 2 interoperability.\n\nThis has been in the works for some time and involves the incorporation of ENSIP-10 for Wildcard Resolution and EIP-3668 for CCIP Read, enabling secure off-chain data retrieval. According to the developers, enabling the interaction between current solutions and ENS domains would enhance accessibility regarding domain name registrations and transactions for a broader range of users.\n\nLooking ahead, the Ethereum naming system developers plan to utilize off-chain resolvers by implementing an ENS off-chain registrar contract and partnerships with various service providers. These providers include cb.id, a project operated by Coinbase, Lens Protocol on the Polygon network and OptiNames on Optimism, among others. By leveraging these resources, the developers aim to facilitate seamless integration and expand the reach of ENS domains.\n\nGasless Import: ENS Roadmap Feature to Lower Barriers and Enhance Web Accessibility\n\nThe ENS team announced the close collaboration between ENS Labs and web-integrated domain name TLDs such as .art and .box. This collaboration aims to establish seamless integration, allowing users to register browser-supported names through the ENS platform. Additionally, it marks a significant milestone as DNS names can be traded as NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain for the first time this year.\n\nDuring the community call, the team discussed a new feature added to the roadmap. This feature entails the option to import DNS, the web naming protocol, into ENS without incurring any transaction costs, making it a \u201cgasless\u201d process. Additionally, this upcoming feature, scheduled for release in the third quarter of the year, has the potential to enhance web accessibility within the ENS ecosystem and reduce barriers for traditional internet users, as highlighted by the team.\n\nEthereum Name Service Domain Registrations\n\nUndeterred by the tumultuous state of the digital asset market in the previous year, ENS achieved an impressive milestone of over 2.2 million registered domain names. Furthermore, this number has consistently increased, reaching a current total of 2.73 million spread across nearly 700,000 unique addresses. To further enhance accessibility and convenience, ENS introduced a new fiat on-ramp for domain registrations in April.\n\nThis innovative feature, facilitated through the Web3 fiat payment gateway MoonPay, allowed Web3 users to register decentralized .eth domains seamlessly. Additionally, this integration enabled users to utilize popular fiat payment options like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and debit and credit cards, expanding the range of choices available for domain registration.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

Once this happens, it signifies that the asset might be weak and ready to sell off.\n\nRight now, the Ethereum price is rallying higher, but the MACD indicator is showing a clear sign of a downtrend.\n\nThis tells us that \u201cwhile the price might be moving up, bullish volume is dying down\u201d and if this continues, sooner or later the ETH price will reverse.\n\nFinal Verdict!\n\nThe ETH price has broken out of the 4-hour timeframe converging Triangle pattern and is pushing higher! So for now we remain bullish on the Altcoin price.\n\nHowever, we are beginning to see signs of weakness creep into the price chart as Ethereum is diverging from the MACD indicator.

        "title": "June NFT market shake-up: Ethereum reigns, Bitcoin falters | - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "There\u2019s a surprising shift in the ether winds of the non-fungible token (NFT) realm as Ethereum solidifies its dominance while Bitcoin\u2019s momentum ebbs. In this article, we take an illuminating journey into the depths of the NFT market landscape as it stood in June 2023.\n\nEthereum ascends as Bitcoin descends\n\nEthereum-based NFTs made a mark in June, with total sales eclipsing the $452 million milestone, which equates to over 63% of the entire NFT market\u2019s turnover.\n\nThis represented a nearly 8% growth from May\u2019s sales, reinforcing Ethereum\u2019s stronghold over the market, especially as Bitcoin-based NFT transactions fell.\n\nThe king of cryptocurrency saw a staggering fall of 42.36% from May to June, closing the month with a total of $110.3 million, a significant decrease from the previous month.\n\nSolana, however, held a different narrative. It played the part of an unexpected dark horse, showcasing an impressive surge in its NFT sales. Solana\u2019s NFT transactions skyrocketed by a staggering 65%, reaching an astounding $70.42 million.\n\nThis surprising growth story demonstrated the potential of Solana\u2019s infrastructure for NFT enthusiasts and investors.\n\nMythos and Polygon trail behind amid the shift\n\nFurther down the ranks, Mythos and Polygon, despite their emerging platforms, unfortunately experienced a dip in their NFT transactions. Mythos saw a slump of nearly 20%, recording $28,322,124 in NFT sales.\n\nPolygon fared worse, suffering a sharp 45.91% drop to $27,846,781. This shows that not all networks could weather the market fluctuations and compete effectively against the might of Ethereum or ride on the rapid momentum of Solana.\n\nJune marked the meteoric rise of an unsung hero \u2013 Uncategorized Ordinals. The collection outpaced other contenders in the NFT market, boasting sales of a whopping $52.91 million, which marked a modest but crucial 1.44% increase from May.\n\nTrailing behind it was the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), which posted sales of $49.76 million, a robust 28.20% higher than its performance in May. Other noteworthy NFT collections that marked their presence were Azuki, Azuki Elemental, and SMB Barrel Raffle.\n\nNoteworthy NFT sales: The exception to the rule\n\nDespite Bitcoin\u2019s struggle, it had a prominent presence among the highest-priced NFT sales for June. In a fascinating twist, four of the top five most valuable NFT sales were based on Bitcoin, proving that Bitcoin\u2019s appeal still holds sway among some sections of the NFT market.\n\nThe sole exception was the Ethereum-based NFT, Fidenza #545.\n\nJune brought about a shift in the NFT market that underlines the dynamic nature of this digital assets landscape. The surge of Ethereum and the rise of Solana, alongside Bitcoin\u2019s falter, point to a market that is constantly evolving.\n\nThese shifts invite market participants to remain vigilant and adapt to the changes. It will be intriguing to watch how these patterns evolve as we venture further into the world of NFTs."

This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nJoin Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage\n\nA GMX crypto whale that has been on an ETH shorting spree might be facing huge liquidation soon.\n\nPnL data shows that they are in danger of losing 80% of their funds if the Ethereum price touches the $1950 mark.\n\nPopular crypto Twitter influencer Taiki Maeda made his community aware of this situation via his tweet.\n\nLet's track this $ETH shorter on $GMX together On-chain positions create a social element to taking/monitoring positions, versus people just posting PnL after winning CEX trades. Never been a big fan of \"copy-trade\" platforms but might gain more traction If on-chain perps level\u2026 https://t.co/5XNds8jOBx \u2014 Taiki Maeda (@TaikiMaeda2) June 23, 2023\n\nMany crypto influencers on Twitter are asking, \u201cwhy so many shorts\u201d after seeing a chart showing that the GMX whale has shorted ETH 24 times between June 18th to June 22nd alone.\n\nGMX Trader Can\u2019t Stop Shorting\n\nThe GMX whale has implemented this strategy of shorting ETH in a way that no one can explain. Many are saying that he is implementing Delta Hedge. And others are countering that argument by saying that it would not be ideal to use GMX to implement this strategy.\n\nWhat is Delta Hedge? Delta Hedge is an options trading strategy that a trader implements to reduce or hedge the risk related to the price movements of an underlying asset.\n\nThe yellow circles represent the shorting zones\n\nOne user has also stated that it is pretty \u201cinsane\u201d that the whale has conditioned their orders to add all the way to their liquidity.\n\nAs you can see from this data, the liquidity price has been set at $1953. That is the reason many investors are wondering why the whale would take that position.\n\nAnd some investors are being cheeky about it, saying that GMX bears are adding a margin to their already low position.\n\nClick here to check to monitor the whale\u2019s action by yourself.\n\nGMX Price Analysis\n\nWhen it comes to GMX, the price of the asset has been stable above the $53 range since last month. The chart shows that mid-June was the only time that the token dropped in the red zones, crashing past the $45 mark.\n\nBut a quick rebound has allowed it to move past the $52.98 support. The current candle shows red signs. If GMX falls below its current support, it will try to stay above $50.\n\nCurrently, the token\u2019s RSI is around 55 \u2013 keeping it a bit in the oversold zone. But GMX\u2019s current stable trend doesn\u2019t make it seem like it will drop any time soon.\n\nMaybe They Know Something We Don\u2019t \u2013 Twitter\n\nThe whale\u2019s recent actions have started a slew of conspiracy theories, with many saying that the trader knows something that we don\u2019t. While others say that the trader might know too much.\n\nmaybe he knows too much \u2014 zkspy\ud83d\udfe0 (@Krypt0psy) June 25, 2023\n\nGMX is performing similarly to Ethereum (in a stable state). Ethereum\u2019s current price chart on CoinMarketCap doesn\u2019t show any volatility other than a little morning dip. At press time, it is trading around the $1916 mark.\n\nYou can check out our yearly price predictions about Ethereum in our Ethereum price forecast guide.\n\nWhich Other Cryptos Whales Are Buying?\n\nWhile we have highlighted shorter crypto in our article, they are not the only ones making rounds in the market. There are other tokens that users are interested in. Most of them are available as presales.\n\nPresale tokens are favored by those who don\u2019t want to deal with the current volatility of the crypto market. While the recent trends are showing some signs of stability for the tokens we have mentioned, all it would take is one negative news to spread, and the bears might take over.\n\nIn such situations, presales allow users to make gains without being subject to the market\u2019s erratic behavior. This is why some of the best presales that whales are interested in include the following:\n\nWall Street Memes (WSM)\n\nWall Street Memes is a community-centric asset that leverages memes to grow up in value. Inspired by the Reddit Group Wall Street Bets, Wall Street Memes aims to transform memecoins \u2013 a seemingly \u201cuseless\u201d asset into a wealth generator.\n\nThe token\u2019s appeal has grown since the launch of its presale. And it has already raised more than $11.7 million at press time. The community backing this token has a million followers across multiple social media platforms, and even Elon Musk has interacted with the group.\n\nThese factors can fuel it to make it the next 10x crypto of this year.\n\nThug Life (THUG)\n\nAnother token to have been inspired by the memecoin genre and has gained a lot of attention in a short time is Thug Life.\n\nThug Life is a \u201cballer\u2019s\u201d memecoin inspired by the \u201cThug Life\u201d mean, representing stoic individuals who got a perfect comeback for everything. That \u201cgrind\u201d mentality also permeates across Thug Life\u2019s official website, whose content uses \u201cstreet talk\u201d to communicate what the project is about.\n\nThug Life has been able to use this uniqueness to raise more than $180k within three days.\n\nIt is one of the top four crypto assets recommended by our resident crypto expert \u2013 Jacob Crypto Bury.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile GMX\u2019s whale recent move is heading them toward liquidation, there is a bigger picture that many retail investors aren\u2019t seeing. This is why investors must look for alternative investment opportunities, such as Wall Street Memes and Thug Life.\n\nBoth are highly popular memecoin presales that have quickly gained the market\u2019s attention. And if they follow the same trends as other ICOs in the past, early movers might make a 10x return.\n\nRelated\n\nNew Crypto Mining Platform - Bitcoin Minetrix Rating Audited By Coinsult\n\nDecentralized, Secure Cloud Mining\n\nEarn Free Bitcoin Daily\n\nNative Token On Presale Now - BTCMTX\n\nStaking Rewards - Over 50% APY Learn More"
