        "title": "Ethereum price won't see $2K anytime soon, market data suggests - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The price of Ether (ETH) faced strong resistance at $1,920 after a 17.5% rally between June 15 and June 22. Several factors contributed to the limited upside, including worsening macroeconomic conditions, the regulatory cryptocurrency environment and weaker demand for decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum network.\n\nETH price faces macroeconomic headwinds\n\nOn June 26, a federal judge denied a motion from Binance that could have stopped the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from issuing public statements related to the case.\n\nIn addition, in its mid-year outlook, HSBC Asset Management\u2019s report warned of an economic downturn in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, followed by a \u201cyear of contraction and a European recession in 2024\u201d. The report also noted that \u201ccorporate defaults have started to creep up.\u201d\n\nFinally, International Monetary Fund chief economist Gita Gopinath told CNBC on June 27 that central bankers should \u201ccontinue tightening\u201d by keeping interest rates high for longer than expected.\n\nEthereum network demand, gas fees drop\n\nUsage of DApps on the Ethereum network failed to gain momentum as gas fees dropped 60%. Notably, the seven-day average transaction cost dropped to $3.7 on June 26, down from $9 four weeks prior.\n\nDApp active addresses also declined by 27% in the same period.\n\n30-day Ethereum DApp activity. Source: DappRadar\n\nA large chunk of the decline was concentrated on Uniswap and MetaMask Swap, while most nonfungible token (NFT) marketplaces saw a surge in their unique active wallets (UAW).\n\nDespite Uniswap NFT Aggregator\u2019s lackluster performance, the sector faced a decent influx of users on OpenSea, Blur, Manifold, LooksRare and Unick.\n\nMore concerningly, however, is that the total value locked (TVL) \u2014 measuring the deposits locked in Ethereum smart contracts \u2014 reached its lowest level since August 2020. The indicator declined by 6.9% between April 28 and June 28 to 13.9 million ETH, according to DefiLlama.\n\nETH price rally not supported by derivatives markets\n\nSo how are professional traders positioned for the next ETH price move? Let\u2019s look at Ether futures to gauge the odds of ETH/USD breaking above the $1,920 resistance.\n\nETH quarterly futures are the preferred instruments of whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts usually trade at a slight premium to spot markets, as they demand an additional fee to postpone settlement.\n\nAs a result, in healthy markets, ETH futures contracts should trade at a 5\u201310% annualized premium, a situation known as contango.\n\nEther two-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nAccording to the futures premium \u2014 known as the basis indicator \u2014 professional traders have been avoiding leveraged longs (bullish bets). Despite the modest improvement to 3%, the metric remains far from the neutral 5% threshold.\n\nTo exclude externalities that might have solely impacted the Ether futures, one should analyze the ETH options markets. The 25% delta skew indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options, and will turn positive when fear is prevalent because the protective put option premium is higher than the call options.\n\nEther 30-day 25% skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe skew indicator will move above 8% if traders fear an Ether price crash. On the other hand, generalized excitement reflects a negative 8% skew.\n\nAs displayed above, the delta skew has been flirting with moderate optimism since June 22 but has been unable to sustain it for long. Presently, the negative 2% metric displays a balanced demand for options.\n\nResistance below $2,000 remains formidable\n\nJudging by the ETH derivatives metrics, and declining TVL and DApps use, bears are better positioned to defend the $1,920 resistance. Moreover, the worsening macroeconomic conditions and cryptocurrency regulatory news confirm the moderate pessimism for risk-on assets, including Ether.\n\nRelated: 3 reasons why Ethereum\u2019s market cap dominance is on the rise\n\nThat does not necessarily mean that Ether is bound to retest $1,750, but it certainly presents an enormous hurdle for ETH bulls after failing to break the $1,920 level on three occasions between June 21 and June 25.\n\nConsequently, at least for the short term, bears have better odds of successfully defending this important price level.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum price is slowly moving lower from the $1,920 resistance against the US Dollar. ETH could extend its decline toward the $1,790 support.\n\nEthereum is still struggling to surpass the $1,920 resistance.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,900 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $1,885 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could decline further toward the $1,790 support in the coming sessions.\n\nEthereum Price Stuck In A Range\n\nEthereum\u2019s price attempted another upside break above the key $1,920 resistance zone. ETH failed to gain bullish momentum for a close above the $1,920 level, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nA high is formed near $1,912 and the price is now moving lower. There was a break below the $1,900 level. The price declined below the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $1,838 low to the $1,912 high. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $1,885 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEther is now trading below $1,900 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is now testing the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $1,838 low to the $1,912 high.\n\nIf Ethereum stays above $1,850, it could attempt another increase. Immediate resistance is near the $1,880 level or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The next major resistance is near the $1,900 level.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe main barrier is still near the $1,920 and $1,930 levels. A close above the $1,930 zone could start a steady increase and send the price further higher. The next resistance sits near $2,000, above which the price could rise toward the $2,050 level. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $2,120 resistance.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,900 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,850 level.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,840 level. If there is a move below $1,840, the price could accelerate lower toward $1,790. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,750 support.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,840\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,900\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Discover SCENE\n\nThough the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is waging legal war across the crypto space, Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin isn\u2019t breaking a sweat.\n\nWhen asked about regulators potentially treating Ether (ETH) like a security, the Consensys CEO explained during a Tuesday interview with CNBC that the regulatory verdict on Ethereum is already in.\n\n\u201cThe SEC has spoken,\u201d he said, referring to former SEC commissioner Bill Hinman\u2019s 2018 speech on crypto securities and Ethereum.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNew documents have revealed that Hinman received multiple warnings from colleagues that the speech could confuse markets into thinking that the SEC had already deemed the asset a non-security.\n\n\n\nA security is a financial instrument often (but not always) associated with some kind of investment contract. A commodity, by contrast, is a basic or natural good, like gold, wheat, or cattle.\n\n\u201cThe CFTC has spoken very crisply a number of times that they consider Ether like a commodity,\u201d added Lubin.\n\nWhile Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Rostin Benham agrees that many cryptocurrencies are securities, he also thinks the three top assets\u2014including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum, and Tether (USDT)\u2014belong under his agency\u2019s jurisdiction as commodities.\n\nSEC Chairman Gary Gensler, by contrast, has only publicly deemed Bitcoin as such.\n\n\n\nOn the topic of Ether, Gensler has kept a tight lip. Some videos from his time as an MIT professor suggest he once thought it was a security, while others indicate he believed it had graduated from a security into a commodity by 2018.\n\nMembers of Congress are drafting legislation to clear up this issue, including Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand, and have voiced agreement with the CFTC that Ether is a commodity alongside Bitcoin.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a forgone conclusion at this point,\u201d said Lubin. \u201cThere may be a regulator or two in the United States that can\u2019t bring himself to utter the fact that Ether is not a security, but I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s the case.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe SEC sued Binance and Coinbase earlier this month alleging that over a dozen assets listed on their platform were securities, including Paxos-issued stablecoin BUSD.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, experienced a sharp price drop recently, moving from $1,940 to $1,847. While various factors play into the volatility of cryptocurrency prices, the substantial sell-off by a particular \"whale\" is believed to have significantly contributed to Ethereum's decline in this instance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA \"whale\" in the crypto universe refers to an individual or entity that holds a large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. When such a player makes substantial trades, it often triggers notable price movements. In this case, an Ethereum whale strategically deposited 25,000 ETH (valued at approximately $47.24 million) to Binance, the popular crypto exchange platform, and withdrew 15.9 million USDT 12 hours later.\n\nThe smart whale who deposited 25K $ETH ($47.24M) to #Binance yesterday withdrew 16M $USDT again 9 hrs ago.\n\n\n\nThe drop in $ETH price 11 hrs ago was most likely due to the sell-off of this whale.\n\n\n\nAnd the whale may have ~8K $ETH ($14.7M) left unsold.https://t.co/EucQrT7C4w pic.twitter.com/Aogfv9vOdO \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 29, 2023\n\nRenowned for buying low and selling high, this crypto whale has maintained a perfect win rate for Ethereum trading over the past couple of months. This successful strategy, while profitable for the whale, has recently resulted in downward pressure on ETH's price.\n\nJust nine hours after the initial transaction, the whale proceeded to withdraw another 16 million USDT, further contributing to Ethereum's downward spiral. Analysts believe the sudden drop in Ethereum's price was largely attributed to this whale's substantial sell-off.\n\nWith approximately 8,000 ETH (roughly $14.7 million) yet to be sold, this influential whale's future trading activities could potentially exert additional selling pressure on Ethereum's market value. However, it is also crucial to note that crypto markets can be affected by a myriad of factors, including global economic trends, regulatory news and changes in investor sentiment.\n\nThis recent event underscores the amount of power and influence whales have on the cryptocurrency market. Retail investors should always stay cautious and track large wallets to avoid unexpected sell-offs like this one."

This is ahead of competitors, including liquid staking services provided by major centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, which control roughly 12% of the market combined.\n\nSince Ethereum enabled staked Beacon Chain ETH withdrawals, LSD platforms have enjoyed heightened interest as several institutions like Celsius have been restaking their ETH holdings.\n\nFor context, the Token Unlocks dashboard shows that over 7 million ETH tokens have been deposited in the Beacon Chain since withdrawals were enabled. At the same time, 3.52 million ETH were withdrawn during the same period.\n\nThis heightened interest has seen the total amount of staked ETH exceed the ETH balance on centralized exchanges, including Coinbase and Binance.\n\nLSD tokens struggle\n\nDespite the milestone, tokens in the liquid staking sector have struggled in the last 24 hours, rising by just 0.26%, according to CryptoSlate data.\n\nAccording to the data, only Lido\u2019s LDO and Stafi\u2019s FIS saw their value rise by 1.18% and 0.51%, respectively, during the reporting period.\n\nOthers like Rocket Pool, Frax Share (FXS), Ankr, pSTAKE Finance (PSTAKE), and StakeWise (SWISE) recorded slight losses.\n\nCryptoSlate data further shows that all of the assets in the sector declined by 7.25% in the last seven days.\n\nOverall, the market cap of the crypto tokens in this sector sits at $3.03 billion as of press time.\n\nMentioned in this article"

Earlier this month, Gensler\u2019s hammer struck twice as the SEC filed landmark lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase for purportedly offering cryptocurrencies that the regulator deems to be unregistered securities.\n\nThe commission\u2019s chairman has also hinted that ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, fell under this umbrella after the network\u2019s monumental shift to a proof of stake consensus mechanism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Gensler wasn\u2019t always so trenchant a detractor. Before becoming the chair of SEC, he taught courses on digital currency at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and consulted with that school\u2019s Digital Currency Initiative.

Recently unmasked documents revealed that Hinman dismissed warnings from other SEC staffers who believed his comments would cause immense market confusion.\n\nNotably, Gensler refused to say whether ether was a security during a five-hour-long hearing in April. \u201cIt\u2019s really a forgone conclusion at this point,\u201d Lubin observed. \u201cThere may be a regulator or two in the United States that can\u2019t bring himself to utter the fact that Ether is not a security, but I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s the case.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, industry figures and billionaires like Mark Cuban are calling out the SEC for failing to provide crypto firms with a clear registration process to comply with."

        "content": "Proof of State is the Wednesday edition of Fortune Crypto where Leo Schwartz delivers insider insights on policy and regulation.\n\nThe myth of crypto as an untraceable haven for cybercriminals has long been busted, even if Bitcoin still carries the reputation as a dark web currency used to buy drugs and hire hit men. If anything, blockchain\u2019s immutable records provide better opportunities for insight into illicit activity than plain old cash, creating a golden age for law enforcement investigations thanks to the rise of analytics firms like Chainalysis and TRM Labs.\n\nA new report from TRM Labs adds another wrinkle to the Whac-A-Mole game between illicit actors and law enforcement, as its global head of policy, Ari Redbord, a former Department of Justice prosecutor and U.S. Treasury undersecretary, put it. Cybercriminals are also aware of the tracing reality of crypto and have acted accordingly. As the report notes, Bitcoin has receded dramatically, accounting for 97% of total illicit crypto volume in 2016 and just 19% in 2022. \u201cWe lived in a world again, just a few years ago, where really all you needed was to track and trace the flow of funds on Bitcoin,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cTracing certainly has changed.\u201d\n\nThe report lays out an arms race between cybercriminals and global law enforcement, where illicit actors are using new attempts to evade detection, from privacy coins like Monero and Zcash to mixers like Tornado Cash, and regulators are close on their tail. According to TRM Labs, illicit actors have mostly turned to Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain for hacks, with 68% and 19% of overall volume, respectively, and have almost exclusively turned to Tron for terrorist financing, which represents 92% of overall volume. \u201cReally, over the last few years, we\u2019ve seen a shift to digital battlefields, where wars are fought on blockchains,\u201d Redbord said.\n\nDespite the ever-evolving methods of illicit actors, Redbord maintained that law enforcement\u2014and especially regulators, including the Treasury Department\u2014are mostly winning the battle. While hacks are still happening at a fast clip, a priority has been closing off-ramps into fiat currency for state actors like North Korea, with the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control controversially sanctioning crypto addresses and mixers for the first time last year.\n\nThe growing popularity of cybercriminals turning to Tether on Tron\u2014a confluence of two notoriously unregulated crypto tools\u2014provides another challenge. As a stablecoin, Tether is particularly appealing because of its peg to the U.S. dollar. Tron has the advantage of lower transaction fees than other blockchains like Ethereum, along with the perception of existing outside the watchful eyes of regulators.\n\n\u201cWe have seen Russian cybercriminals, drug cartels, and even North Korean state actors look to Tron, where there is an ecosystem of noncompliant crypto businesses ready to convert funds,\u201d Redbord said, adding that there has been a 240% increase in the use of Tether on Tron over the past year for terrorist financing.\n\nWhile TRM Labs is able to provide tracing capacities on Tron, the shift still demonstrates the ongoing risks that offshore crypto venues pose to regulators. Last week, the Department of Justice announced a new cyber section within its national security division. Even if Congress is dragging its feet on crypto, the rest of the government isn\u2019t waiting around.\n\nLeo Schwartz\n\nleo.schwartz@fortune.com\n\n@leomschwartz\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nA Nevada regulator said that crypto custodian Prime Trust had a \u201cshortfall of customer funds\u201d and placed the firm into receivership.

Dhamodharan told Fortune that:\n\n\u201cA lot of the things people cover and talk about these days in crypto are the regulatory aspects of it and all the technology and investment as an asset and so forth,\u201d\n\nHe added that the underlying technology that powers crypto is \u201cactually quite useful.\u201d\n\nThe company confirmed its commitment to crypto in the official announcement, which flagged the move as a \u201cnatural evolution\u201d for a \u201cwider range of payment solutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur goal is to support the wider digital asset industry and interested parties to help fortify confidence in its future.\u201d\n\nMastercard\u2019s previous forays into the digital asset sector include non-fungible tokens (NFTs), crypto-linked credit and debit cards, crypto infrastructure, and developer tools.\n\nThe firm also offers products such as \u2018Crypto Secure,\u2019 \u2018Crypto Source\u2019 and \u2018Crypto Credential\u2019 which it claims bring \u201cmore transparency and trust to this space.\u201d\n\nPrograms and applications on the new \u2018app store\u2019 can be written in Solidity, the Ethereum programming language.\n\nMoreover, developers using the beta will be able to experiment with tokenized commercial bank deposits and blockchain data that state how much cash someone has in their bank account.\n\nMastercard plans to make MTN available in additional markets around the world over time, according to the announcement.\n\nCrypto Market Outlook\n\nCrypto markets have begun their retreat from Bitcoin\u2019s resistance zone above $30K. As a result, total market capitalization is down 1.4% today at $1.20 trillion, according to CoinGecko.\n\nBTC remains above $30K but only just, trading at $30,100 at the time of writing. Meanwhile, Ethereum prices are beginning to break down again, with a 1.8% decline to $1,831.\n\nThe entire top 50 altcoins were in the red at the time of writing."

        "content": "Institutional staking provider Chorus One is partnering with Nexus Mutual to bring insurance coverage for stakers on Ethereum.\n\nThe company will be one of the first node providers to purchase on-chain staking coverage from Nexus Mutual to protect its users from slashing, Hari Iyer, marketing manager at Chorus One told Blockworks.\n\nStaking has been a relatively appealing source of income following the Shapella upgrade for institutional investors.\n\n\u201cInstitutions are looking for a safe source of yield, but no matter how much protection you have, how good the infrastructure set up is, there can be incidents of downtime or slashing,\u201d Iyer said.\n\nSlashing is a penalty for validators who engage in dishonest or inactive behavior. Although it is extremely rare, penalties can be severe, Iyer explained.\n\nValidators could lose a cut of their stake or be removed from a network completely if they are slashed.\n\n\u201cWhen staking your ETH, even with the best technical set-up and expertise, mistakes can happen and slashing can occur,\u201d Hugh Karp the founder of Nexus Mutual said in a statement reviewed by Blockworks. \u201cThe most professional operators recognize this and put in place protection for their users.\u201d\n\nNexus Mutual itself dedicates a portion of the ether in its capital pool to staking as a way to generate revenue for the DAO.\n\nChorus One will provide base coverage for all users who stake Ethereum through OPUS, its multi-chain staking API for institutions, until the end of this year. This measure aims to protect customers from potential slashing losses.\n\nOPUS serves as a non-custodial staking solution that enables investors and institutions to stake their tokens securely. Additionally, institutions have the option to integrate OPUS into their products, allowing them to provide staking services to their customers.\n\n\u201cOur customers also have the option of going for an upgradable insurance cover on other networks outside of Ethereum as well,\u201d Iyer said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin Cash, a spin-off from the oldest digital asset, has struggled to find a market since launching in 2017. But it\u2019s been on a roll this month: since the start of June, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is up 98%, jumping from $113 to $224.\n\nThe slightly obscure digital asset\u2014one of many cryptocurrency \u201cforks\u201d\u2014is following Bitcoin, like many other coins and tokens which have surged in price since the biggest digital asset experienced a run. But BCH is doing by far the best.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhy? The coin is one of the lucky four chosen for EDX Markets, a new crypto exchange backed by major Wall Street players Charles Schwab, Citadel Securities, and Fidelity Digital Assets.\n\nEDX, which launched last week, decided to let its traders\u2014institutional investors only\u2014start off with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nThe reason is simple: regulatory clarity.\n\n\u201cThese specific cryptocurrencies are generally perceived as commodities by regulatory bodies, which significantly mitigates potential legal challenges,\u201d Sei Labs co-founder Jeff Feng told Decrypt.\n\nYouwei Yang, Chief Economist at BTCM, added that the four assets are \u201cwidely regarded as digital commodities, making them relatively safe\u201d from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission because they are made with electricity\u2014a commodity.\n\nIn perhaps its toughest regulatory crackdown yet, the SEC has gone after a number of major crypto brands for allegedly flogging unregistered securities. Earlier this month, it went after Coinbase for allegedly offering and selling unregistered securities via its staking service. It also targeted Binance, the world\u2019s biggest exchange, with a massive lawsuit for allegedly \u201coperating as a fking [sic] unlicensed securities exchange in the U.S.A. bro,\u201d according to the SEC.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn February, it hit Kraken with a $30 million fine for allegedly failing to register the offer and sale of its crypto asset staking-as-a-service program.\n\nThese regulatory enforcements are all because SEC Chairman Gary Gensler thinks\u2014and has said for years\u2014that most cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities.\n\nBut he has made it clear that Bitcoin is a commodity. He has been less clear on Ethereum, but the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CTFC) has said the asset is a commodity.\n\nAnd Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin are both Bitcoin forks\u2014new cryptocurrencies that emerged from the asset\u2019s original code\u2014meaning they are likely to have the same status in the eyes of regulators.\n\nGreg Moritz, Co-Founder at the crypto hedge fund AltTab Capital, said that \u201cnone have been listed by the SEC as unregistered securities,\u201d adding that all four assets are established and have history, \u201ckey factors in the decision-making process of EDX\u2019s backers.\u201d\n\nEDX Markets CEO Jamil Nazarali also said that he felt \u201cvery comfortable\u201d that the four assets weren\u2019t securities.\n\nFor now, these four \u201cold school\u201d cryptocurrencies will give \u201cold school\u201d investors a taste of the crypto world. But things could change, Feng noted. \u201cAs regulations evolve and the understanding of different cryptocurrencies becomes more nuanced, we could anticipate exchanges like EDX broadening their offerings,\u201d he added.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "It\u2019s official. ZK Stack is now available to developers.\n\nMatter Labs, developers of the zero-knowledge layer-2 scaling solution zkSync Era, recently released the open-source code to the public.\n\nSo what\u2019s so special about it?\n\nMatter Labs\u2019 Alex Gluchowski and Anthony Rose spoke to Blockworks on the 0xResearch podcast (Apple/Spotify) about the nuts and bolts of the Ethereum-compatible open-source protocol that rivals Optimism\u2019s OP Stack.\n\nZK Stack is a modular framework for building highly customizable blockchains, CEO Gluchowski told Blockworks. The layer-2 tech uses cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs rather than the \u201coptimistic\u201d approach to rollups, which assumes transaction validity unless proven otherwise.\n\nSenior vice-president of technology Rose says the system includes all the \u201ccore components\u201d that together would be used to form \u201chyperchains.\u201d\n\nThe stack will also include \u201cthe tooling around that,\u201d he says, like compilers, SDKs for configurations and so forth. \u201cEssentially,\u201d it\u2019s everything needed \u201cto be able to deploy a version of this system that looks like Era today, but over time could be more flexible.\u201d\n\nCustomize or copy-paste\n\n\u201cYou can start with all the defaults. Just copy the configuration of zkSync Era,\u201d Gluchowski explains. \u201cOr you can say, I want this component to look differently.\u201d\n\nGluchowski explains the sequencer can be customized to be centralized or decentralized in functionality, depending on the developer\u2019s needs and preferences.\n\nWhile certain enterprises, banks or gaming companies might not feel a need to decentralize the sequencer, Gluchowski expects most chains to sequence transactions in a decentralized manner.\n\n\u201cYou will be able to choose all of the parameters, which consensus algorithm you want to use, how you secure it, what token you want to use there and so on.\u201d\n\nThe data availability mechanism is also customizable, Gluchowski continues.\n\n\u201cZK rollup is an architecture in which you publish data availability through the Ethereum network,\u201d He says. \u201cYou rely on Ethereum\u2019s layer-1 as your data availability layer.\u201d\n\nBecause the technology relies on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet for security, it is \u201cby far, the most secure option,\u201d he says. But as of now, he admits, this security comes \u201cat a price.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the rollups on Ethereum \u2014 Optimistic and ZK rollups alike \u2014 share the same data bandwidth, the same limited block space which you can utilize for your data.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s currently pretty limited,\u201d he says, but will be extended once proto-danksharding is implemented on Ethereum. Data availability demands will be \u201ca bottleneck\u201d for now, he says, adding it may need to be managed by other parties in the meantime to handle demands.\n\nA seamless experience\n\nAccording to Gluchowski, one major advantage of the new tech is its ability to provide complex interactions between decentralized parties in seamless transactions.\n\nUsers will be able to interact with all the DeFi protocols like Uniswap or Curve \u201con the ZK rollup side,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cImagine Uniswap would launch their own \u2018Uni-chain\u2019 as a separate hyper chain in the zkSync network,\u201d he says. The chain would be fully separate with its own sequencer and enjoy all the benefits of security provided by Ethereum.\n\nIf an individual with funds in a wallet on zkSync Era wanted to interact with Uniswap on-chain and execute a trade, it would appear as one seamless transaction to the user, he says.\n\nThe transaction would bridge from Era over a \u201chyper-bridge\u201d to the Uniswap chain, where it would reach the smart contract and swap tokens. The tokens would then be sent back over the bridge to the user wallet.\n\n\u201cAll of that will happen asynchronously, but atomically,\u201d Gluchowski says. In other words, \u201call of these transactions will be scheduled and they cannot be stopped.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor you as a user, you just wait a couple of minutes and the funds come back.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "In a recent CNBC interview, Consensys founder Joseph Lubin made a bold statement affirming that Ethereum (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, should be classified as a commodity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLubin referenced past statements by regulatory bodies, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), as supportive evidence for his stance. Despite this, Gary Gensler, the chairman of the SEC, has not yet explicitly acknowledged Ether as a commodity, even though he has recognized Bitcoin as such.\n\nIn the interview, Lubin highlighted former SEC official Bill Hinman's speech in 2018, which he described as having effectively declared Ether not a security.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder pointed out that 18 of Hinman's colleagues collaborated on the speech, indicating a consensus within the SEC at the time. However, he admitted there might still be a few regulators who have yet to concede that Ether is not a security, although he did not see it as a significant issue.\n\nLubin also reflected on the progress within the cryptocurrency industry over the past year. He pointed to successful developments and launches in 2022, and emphasized that the initiative to \"clean up the CeFi rot\" has been incredibly valuable for the industry. CeFi, or centralized finance, has faced numerous criticisms in the past for not aligning with the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrencies.\n\nLubin's statements are compelling, but they have no effect on the official classifications of Ether. A formal recognition from Gensler and the SEC, classifying Ether as a commodity, is yet to come."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nPolygon Labs is moving ahead with plans to reinvent its entire architecture as part of its goal to become the \"value layer of the Internet.\"\n\nPolygon 2.0 will have a fundamentally different architecture that makes it easier and more seamless to spin up new chains in the Polygon ecosystem. Polygon itself is an Ethereum layer two. It was designed to address some of Ethereum's limitations through a sidechain solution.\n\nAs its upgrade seeks to make it easier to create new Polygon chains, it will also feature a shared bridge to improve interoperability between those chains and eliminate the need for wrapped tokens. A wrapped token, like Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), allows users to move assets off their native blockchain. In this case, WBTC allows users to move their Bitcoin onto the Ethereum and Tron networks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe way that\u2019ll work on Polygon 2.0, native Ethereum tokens will be deposited into a single contract on Ethereum mainnet. When a user wants to use their tokens across different Polygon chains, the corresponding assets will be mapped to the tokens deposited on Ethereum, which Polygon says will eliminate the need for wrapping them and improve user experience.\n\n\u201cThe coordination layer allows us to optimistically confirm cross-chain transactions in a way that\u2019s safe and nearly instant,\u201d said Polygon co-founder Brendan Farmer. \u201cIt\u2019s the first multi-chain design that will truly deliver unified liquidity.\"\n\nAs a further step, Polygon says it will integrate zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs as part of the system to improve. When using online services, for example to make a payment, personal identifying information like names or birth dates are required to access them. Using a ZK proof, a party must prove they know what is in a transaction without revealing the known information directly in order for it to be verified.\n\nIn the new system, both the original Polygon network and the new one will rely on ZK proofs that will store the validated transactions on the L1, and the actual transaction data on the L2 that will be added. Together, they will lower costs and improve privacy for Polygon users.\n\nPolygon co-founder Mihailo Bjelic said that the vision behind the upgrades is to fill in \"the missing piece of an Internet\" and contribute to a \"digital economy that serves everyone.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"The vision for Polygon 2.0 is to create the Value Layer of the Internet,\" Bjelic said in a press release. \"In the same way that the Internet allows anyone to create and exchange information, the Value Layer will allow anyone to create, exchange, and program value.\u201d\n\nThese changes echo in part suggestions from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin earlier in June. In a post titled \u2018The Three Transitions\u2019, Buterin said Ethereum's future would hinge on adaptations to greater privacy, increased use of L2 scaling solutions, and a move to smart contract wallets. Polygon 2.0 utilizes at least two of these elements."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAs Coinbase\u2019s Ethereum layer-2 network Base draws closer to a mainnet launch, the cryptocurrency exchange said Wednesday its technology has been extensively vetted by security researchers.\n\nMore than 100 people recently pored over the network\u2019s code as part of an audit contest, Coinbase said in a blog post. And across various parts of the network\u2019s architecture, experts couldn\u2019t find any major flaws.\n\n\u201cThe more eyes we can get on a codebase, the better,\u201d Coinbase said. \u201cWe [...] are happy to report there were no significant vulnerabilities discovered.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe contest conducted through Code4rena spanned 14 days and tasked people with looking for weak points in the network\u2019s smart contracts, bridges, and other areas. $100,000 in stablecoin USDC was ultimately up for grabs in awards, which no one appears to have won, based on Code4rena\u2019s page for Base that show no results.\n\nCoinbase said that engagement with its audit contest for Base was high, and the exchange is still sorting through all the submissions it received, working to address \u201cinformative or minor issues\u201d that were brought to light.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s layer-2 network is being constructed in collaboration with Optimism, known for its use of Optimistic Rollups to help scale Ethereum. Base uses Optimism\u2019s OP Stack, and its mainnet launch is expected to come sometime in 2023.\n\nLayer-2 solutions are designed to make transactions on networks like Ethereum cheaper and more efficient by processing transactions in a different space and then relaying results back to their respective network.\n\nThe latest round of critical eyes assessing Base\u2019s robustness follows security audits from Spearbit and Sherlock, Coinbase notes, adding that Coinbase\u2019s Protocol Security team has already vetted those findings.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOther measures are being developed to ensure Base\u2019s security, Coinbase said, such as a tool that lets developers scan smart contacts for flaws and another that will monitor Base\u2019s network for irregularities called Pessimism.\n\nAs Coinbase looks to diversify its revenue beyond a reliance on trading fees that come from customer trades, it has leaned into subscriptions and services, such as staking. In March, the company announced \u201cWallet as a Service,\u201d expected to dovetail with Base as a way for firms to add digital wallets to their apps.\n\nWhen Base was announced in February, Coinbase said the network will be home to its future on-chain products. It also expressed hopes that Base will also become a popular ecosystem among developers, courting projects to the emerging layer-2 network."

        "title": "Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: BTC edges closer to recovery after sweeping Monday's low - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price attempts to overcome the $30,711 hurdle after a 26% run-up.\n\nEthereum price looks primed for a breakout that could trigger a minimum rally of 21% to $2,439.\n\nRipple price continues to bounce between the $0.548 and $0.413 barriers, awaiting a breakout.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price seems to be edging closer to ending its ongoing sideways movement. This development comes after BTC swept this week's lows, suggesting that a potential rally in the opposite direction is likely not just for the big crypto but also for Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP) and other altcoins.\n\nBitcoin price at inflection point\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price remains still after its 26% ascent since June 15. After its recent uptick, BTC has set up a new high at $31,430 after taking out the previous local top at $30,968. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has flipped above the mean line at 50, and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) has produced a green histogram bar above the zero line. This development is a clear sign that bullish momentum is on the rise.\n\nTherefore, a decisive three-day candlestick close above the Momentum Reversal Indicator\u2019s (MRI) State Trend Resistance level at $30,711 will be a buy signal. A move after this flip will allow Bitcoin price to target the weekly Bearish Breaker\u2019s midpoint at $35,260.\n\nAlthough unlikely, if the bullish momentum continues to remain dominant, Bitcoin price could attempt a retest of the Bearish Breaker\u2019s upper limit at $41,273.\n\nBTC/USDT 3-day chart\n\nAdditionally, the lower timeframe chart, as seen below, shows a much more nuanced outlook for Bitcoin price. On June 28, BTC swept Monday''s low at $29,890. The intention of this move was to collect the sell-side liquidity, which often signals a move in the opposite direction. Therefore, the next short-term target for Bitcoin price could be the equal highs at $31,050 followed by the June 23 swing high at $31,500.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nThe bullish outlook for Bitcoin price makes sense considering the momentum indicators, but investors need to take a closer look at the RSI. While BTC has produced three higher highs since January, RSI has produced three lower highs. This setup is termed \u201cbearish divergence\u201d and often results in correction of the underlying asset.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin holds above $30k as investors await historically strong July, eye options expiry\n\nEthereum price awaits buy signal\n\nEthereum (ETH) price looks extremely promising, not just from a technical point of view, but the indicators are also suggesting a bullish outlook. Between May 31, 2022, and June 28, 2023, ETH has set up an ascending triangle with roughly three equal highs and four higher lows.\n\nThis technical formation forecasts a 45% ascent to $2,915 upon the breakout of the $1,865 hurdle. The theoretical target is obtained by measuring the distance between the first swing high and swing low and adding it to the breakout point of the $1,865 resistance level.\n\nTherefore, Ethereum price needs to produce a decisive flip of the aforementioned barrier to kickstart this massive bullish move.\n\nSupporting this outlook are the RSI and AO indicators, both of which have moved above their respective mean lines - 50 and 0. This development signals a shift in momentum favoring the bulls. Furthermore, the Wave Trend indicator has produced a bullish crossover just above the oversold zone, adding credence to the bullish thesis.\n\nTherefore, investors need to be patient as this is a long-term outlook that will take quite a while to play out.\n\nETH/USDT 3-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum price produces a decisive three-day candlestick close below $1,639, it will invalidate the ascending triangle\u2019s bullish thesis. A further spike in selling pressure could trigger a near 15% descent to $1,408.\n\nRipple price needs clarity\n\nRipple (XRP) price has been stuck trading between the $0.548 and $0.413 barriers since March 26. A decisive flip of the upper limit at $0.548 into a support floor would be a clear buy signal. In such a case, XRP could trigger a 40% ascent to $0.778, which is the target of the potential double bottom pattern, as shown in the chart below.\n\nInterestingly, the aforementioned Ripple price target also coincides with MRI\u2019s State Trend Resistance level, making it a key level to book profits.\n\nXRP/USDT 3-day chart\n\nWhile it is assumed that a breakout of $0.548 would lead to a Ripple price rally, investors need to take another look at the indicators. The RSI and AO indicators have produced clear lower lows, while the XRP price has produced equal highs. Such a setup is termed \u201cexaggerated bearish divergence,\u201d and it often leads to a steep correction for the underlying asset.\n\nThe Wave Trend indicator has also signaled a bearish divergence, aligning with the overall bearish outlook. Therefore, a pullback that breaks below the $0.413 support level will invalidate the bullish thesis. Such a move could result in a 17% correction to the next State Trend Support level at $0.334.\n\nAlso read: New evidence suggests SEC's common enterprise claim against Ripple doesn't hold, John Deaton says"

        "title": "Exclusive: Fxhash 2.0 Debuts Ethereum Integration and On-Chain Minting - nft now",
        "content": "Over the past few years, fxhash has solidified itself as a premiere, community-focused, and accessible platform for generative art. A longtime major facet of the Tezos NFT ecosystem, the platform is now seeking to double down on its mission to enhance and untether the creative potential of artists in the generative NFT space with an ambitious expansion.\n\nWith its forthcoming update, dubbed fxhash 2.0, the platform aims to bridge the gap between Tezos and Ethereum, fostering an environment that promotes the unique creative freedom of its users. This ETH integration is expected to expand the platform\u2019s capabilities, allowing for both minting and collecting unique generative artworks on both Tezos and Ethereum directly from within the fxhash ecosystem.\n\nFxhash 2.0\n\nBorn in 2021, fxhash easily carved a niche for itself as an open ecosystem for generative art, encouraging artists to mint their innovative creations without the barriers typical of curated platforms. The result has been a bustling, diverse marketplace boasting over two million unique pieces of art since its inception.\n\nWith its 2.0 upgrade, fxhash breaks new ground by integrating Ethereum, widely known as the leading blockchain network. Notably, this update responds to the fxhash community\u2019s feedback, showcasing the platform\u2019s commitment to user needs. With a dual-blockchain approach, artists and collectors can choose between Tezos and Ethereum depending on their unique needs, enhancing the creative and collecting experience.\n\nCredit: fxhash\n\nBeyond blockchain expansion efforts, the update also introduces fully on-chain minting on both Ethereum and Tezos, ensuring artists have expanded options and tools for immortalizing their works fully on-chain. According to a press release shared exclusively with nft now, this feature reflects fxhash\u2019s primary mission to empower its global community of artists to \u201cearn a living from their digital works of art, independent of their location on the planet.\u201d\n\nFxhash 2.0 features\n\nTo this end, previously established features like fx(params), redeemables, and third-party integration tools that are already on fxhash will now be compatible with Ethereum from day one of the fxhash 2.0 launch. Thus, the platform ensures a seamless transition for artists accustomed to the existing tools while expanding their potential reach.\n\nfxhash 2.0\n\n\u2014 a multichain future\n\n\n\nToday, we're super excited to share some major news with you! We've started working on a significant platform expansion built around integrating Ethereum & on-chain minting.\n\n\n\nLet's talk about what the fxhash 2.0 future looks like \ud83d\ude0e\u2b07\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/00z8qErpCD \u2014 fxhash (@fx_hash_) June 29, 2023\n\nFor the developers working on the 2.0 release, maintaining a unified front for showcasing generative art remains a key principle, regardless of the blockchain used for minting. This is evidenced by the fact that artworks will continue to be displayed together, with the focus being on the art and artist rather than the blockchain. As far as the marketplace aspect is concerned, pieces and collections will simply be denominated in either XTZ or ETH.\n\nBy adopting a multichain approach, fxhash 2.0 seems ready to punch above its weight, offering a seamless movement between Ethereum and Tezos that we have yet to see perfected by any single marketplace. Surely the integration will provide artists with exposure to different audiences and extend the reach of their generative projects. At the time of writing, the release of fxhash 2.0 is slated for late 2023 and promises to bring a series of URL and IRL events celebrating this milestone.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This article was written by an nft now staff member in collaboration with OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4."

        "content": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) recently received an influential exchange listing and a network upgrade, which triggered sudden investor interest in the token. On the other hand, Ethereum (ETH) whales have continued buying, with their holdings striking a new all-time high.\n\nMeanwhile, VC Spectra (SPCT) recently launched its initial public presale and is poised to skyrocket 10x of its current value. The platform has captivated investors with its unraveled precision in identifying profitable projects.\n\nBUY SPECTRA TOKENS NOW\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) Soars High as Global Adoption Skyrockets\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) has skyrocketed by 5.08% to $231.99 in the past 24 hours. With the Bitcoin offshoot platform experiencing increased adoption, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has attracted massive investor sentiment. Recent data shows that the number of unsettled futures or open interest soared to over $400 million earlier in the week from $75 million the previous week.\n\nMost of this trading interest emerged from Binance, where traders launched $240 million worth of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) on short or long positions. Furthermore, increasing open interest indicates new money flowing into the market as participants increase their allocation.\n\nDespite Bitcoin Cash\u2019s (BCH) improved performance, investors remain cautious as they seek to speculate and mine on digital assets. Recent reports show that Bitcoin Cash (BCH) registered a mining difficulty of approximately 369.96 (G) and a total hash rate of around 3.9 (EH/S). Moreover, Bitcoin Cash\u2019s (BCH) FDV was approximately $4.6 billion, assuring traders of massive liquidity.\n\nMarket projections indicate that Bitcoin Cash (BCH) can surge by 0.12% to reach $236.61 by July 2023 as Bitcoin Cash (BCH) improves its transaction speeds and scalability.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAnalyst Predicts Ethereum (ETH) Price Surge as Stacked ETH Surpasses Exchange Balances\n\nAn analyst has revealed a massive supply wall that Ethereum (ETH) must conquer. In a tweet, the analyst mentioned that 832,640 addresses purchased over 26 million ETH between $2,000 and $2,060. According to the analyst, if Ethereum (ETH) overcomes that resistance zone, its price will skyrocket to $2,750.\n\nMeanwhile, stacked ETH has outpaced the Ethereum (ETH) balance on centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. Data from June 26, 2023, suggests 23.36 million ETH (approximately $44 billion) has been staked, accounting for 19.4% of the existing supply. Similarly, Ethereum (ETH) held by centralized exchanges fell to 23.35 million ETH on the same day.\n\nAccording to available data, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) holdings of centralized exchanges have been reduced by 5 million ETH after the Shapella upgrade.\n\nEthereum (ETH) trades at $1,882.79, representing a 0.16% surge in the past 24 hours. Moreover, as mentioned, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) value is projected to surge to $2,750 in the coming months.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) Projected to Surge Before Its Presale Ends\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) is a decentralized hedge fund driving innovation in the cryptocurrency world. It offers its users quarterly dividends and buybacks from the earnings it gains from investments.

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Drops Due Whale Selling, Key Levels To Watch - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, experienced a price drop of over 3% within the last 24 hours. The reason is presumably a significant sell-off carried out by a prominent whale. The whale deposited 25,000 ETH (worth around $47.24 million) on Binance, only to withdraw a significant amount of USDT shortly afterwards.\n\nAs the on-chain data provider Lookonchain reports, the whale has probably already sold a part of his ETH. According to the on-chain data, the whale withdrew 16 million in USDT. \u201cThe drop in ETH price [a few hours] ago was most likely due to the sell-off of this whale,\u201d the analysts note, further explaining that the whale still owns around 8,000 ETH ($14.7 million) unsold.\n\nNevertheless, ETH bulls continue to show strength. A look at the 1-hour chart of Ethereum reveals that the price has formed a bull flag. In technical analysis, a flag is a short-term consolidation pattern that occurs after a strong price move and indicates a temporary break in the trend.\n\nA bullish flag forms during an uptrend with the flagpole pointing upwards, followed by a consolidation phase before a possible continuation of the upward movement. For now, the pattern has held, ETH has bounced up from the 4H 200 EMA at $1,825. In this respect, the bulls remain in control (despite the whale) for the time being.\n\nBasically, two scenarios are conceivable. If the aforementioned support levels are broken to the downside, especially the underside of the flag, Ethereum could face a further price decline towards $1,750. Conversely, a breakout from the flag pattern to the upside (around $1,900) could trigger a price rise towards $2,000.\n\nHowever, according to analyst Ali Martinez, that\u2019s where the price will hit Ethereum\u2019s key supply wall, which is in the $2,000 to $2,060 range, where 832,640 addresses have bought over 26 million ETH. \u201cIf ETH can break through this resistance barrier, we can expect an upswing to $2,330 or even $2,750,\u201d Martinez believes.\n\nEthereum Options Expiry On Friday Confirms Outlook\n\nThe most important event this week for Bitcoin, Ethereum and the entire crypto market will be the expiration of over $7 billion in options tomorrow, Friday, June 30. The current options volume on the largest exchange Deribit is 14,107 calls, 9,445 puts and a put-call ratio of 0.67 for Bitcoin. For Ethereum, there are currently 76,776 calls, 39,779 puts and a put-call ratio of 0.52.\n\nA put-call ratio below 1 typically means that the number of call options is higher than the number of put options, which indicates a more bullish market sentiment. In this case, the put-call ratio for ETH is 0.52, which means that there are more call options compared to put options. Thus, the ratio indicates that market participants are more prone to bullish bets on the ETH price.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin disclosed his least favorite aspects of the cryptocurrency industry in a recent Twitter AMA session.\n\nResponding to a question by crypto enthusiast David Hoffman, Buterin expressed his disappointment in those who perceive the main innovation of cryptocurrencies to be merely tokenization.\n\nHe further identified several secondary concerns, including massive capital misallocation, people compromising their principles, unrealistic purist beliefs and unnecessary conflicts within the industry.\n\nHarmony with Bitcoiners?\n\nButerin's comments highlight a tension within the crypto community. The tokenization aspect has opened avenues for new economic models and democratized access to financial instruments, but it appears Buterin believes that viewing it as the main innovation undermines the broader potential of the technology. Blockchain technology, the foundation of cryptocurrencies, offers potential solutions in trust, transparency and decentralization, areas that extend far beyond token creation and management.\n\nDuring the Q&A session, Buterin also suggested ways to create harmony between Ethereum and Bitcoin proponents. He stressed the importance of collaboration to support freedom and privacy tools outside the blockchain. These tools could include end-to-end messaging without phone number requirements, internet anonymity, secure operating systems like graphene and qubes, open hardware and open VR.\n\nMoving to Mars?\n\nAdditionally, Buterin exhibited interest in the potential of human settlement on Mars, responding to a question about the possibility of relocating should Ethereum's transactions per second (TPS) hit 60 million. He noted his decision would depend on the quality of life, jurisdictional properties and culture present on Martian settlements. While only a lighthearted hypothetical, it signals Buterin's broader perspective on the intersection of technology, society and future human endeavors."

This novel type of contract will enable individuals to invest simultaneously in bitcoin and ether, thereby streamlining the investment process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA futures contract, for those who may not know, is an agreement to buy or sell a particular asset at a predetermined price at a specific time in the future. It's essentially a bet on the future price of an asset. Traders can either go long, predicting the price will rise, or go short, predicting the price will fall.\n\nThe Ether/Bitcoin Ratio futures will be paid in cash based on the final prices of Ether and Bitcoin. This innovative product is aimed at unlocking opportunities for a broader clientele to hedge positions and implement various trading strategies in an economical way.\n\nCME Group has consistently broadened its cryptocurrency-related product offerings. In 2017, it unveiled plans to launch Bitcoin Futures in the fourth quarter, marking a pivotal moment in the mainstream financial world's acceptance of cryptocurrencies. However, this announcement was not without controversy.\n\nCritics argued that the introduction of Bitcoin futures would lead to increased market manipulation and volatility. Despite these concerns, the CME proceeded with the launch, and over time, these futures have become an essential tool for institutional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin.\n\nIn February 2021, the company launched Ether futures, further expanding its suite of crypto derivative products. Later in the same year, Micro Bitcoin futures and Micro Ether futures were launched, offering investors another way to gain exposure to these digital assets but with a smaller capital requirement. Additionally, CME Group incorporated Bitcoin Euro and Ether Euro futures into its portfolio in August."

        "content": "This year, Cardano has made significant strides regarding development.\n\nThe network\u2019s advancements are translating into real-world adoption.\n\nVodafone has sparked excitement by choosing Cardano over the competition.\n\nDespite recent regulatory troubles in the United States, Cardano has had a great year in network development, with upgrades ranging from node updates to governance and scalability.\n\nAs the network continues to evolve, it is beginning to attract greater real-world adoption and edge out competitors in some cases. In the latest instance, Vodafone, one of the world\u2019s largest telecommunications companies, has revealed that it will launch an NFT collection on the Cardano network, snubbing other popular NFT venues like Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana.\n\nVodafone Chooses Cardano\n\nOn Tuesday, June 27, Vodafone\u2019s German Customer Service Twitter account stirred up excitement within the Cardano community with a tweet hinting at the launch of an NFT collection on the Cardano network.\n\nAmidst the speculation that followed the cryptic tweet, NMKR founder Patrick Tobler has confirmed that the German arm of the telecommunications giant would be launching an NFT collection on the Cardano network in a tweet on Wednesday, June 28. The mint will notably take place on the prominent NFT marketplace.\n\nIn conversation with DailyCoin, however, Vodafone insisted that it was still testing the waters and was yet to fully commit to launching an NFT collection.\n\nStill, Vodafone hailed Cardano for its vibrant community, sustainability, and cross-chain capabilities in a message to community members on the project\u2019s Discord server.\n\n\"The reason we chose this particular chain comes down to community, sustainability as well as cross-chain possibilities. We are still in the early stages of this project, so everyone who is here now is already a super early supporter and we appreciate that,\" the message read.\n\nVodafone has notably emphasized that any planned NFT collection would focus on \u201creal utility and benefits for Vodafone customers.\u201d Still, the firm maintained that it was yet to decide what these benefits would be and was open to suggestions from community members.\n\nThe team noted that it could only guarantee direct benefits to German customers but was exploring avenues to include the international community.\n\nThe recent development has unsurprisingly sparked excitement within the Cardano community.\n\nCardano Community Excited\n\nProminent Cardano community influencer Chris O hailed the NMKR team for their effort, highlighting that Vodafone Germany had about 31 million customers and 40% of the market share.\n\n#Cardano, Amazing work by @Padierfind & @nmkr_io team! @vodafone_de will be launching a utility NFT for their German customers in the near term.

Vodafone auctioned its first-ever SMS for $121,000 worth of ETH in December 2021.\n\nVodafone Germany did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nIt is not immediately clear what the NFT project will focus on.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nVodafone choosing the Cardano network for its NFT launch over competitors like Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana suggests that institutions are beginning to recognize its potential for real-world adoption.\n\nRead this to learn more about one of the Cardano network\u2019s most recent upgrades:\n\nHow Cardano Improves Node Performance in New Update\n\nCoinbase wants the SEC case thrown out.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthscriptions akin to BTC inscriptions are a new way for users to create non-fungible tokens on Ethereum.\n\nBarely 48 hours after the launch, the project has recorded over 30,000 image NFTs with slight congestion on the blockchain.\n\nUnlike BTC ordinals, the project has received widespread optimism among developers and users, although some feel it\u2019s just a \u201ccopycat.\u201d\n\nEthereum developers have drawn inspiration from Bitcoin in non-fungible tokens (NFTs), an area of speciality for the decentralized blockchain giant.\n\nA new protocol that offers users a new way to create NFTs hit Ethereum over the weekend with lots of buzzes over its possibilities. Developed by Tom Lehman, the co-founder of Genius.com, the project is termed Ethscriptions, coined like inscriptions in Bitcoin because of the shared similarities.\n\nEthscriptions allow for non-financial data to be written on the Ethereum network so far as it is under 96 kilobytes. It currently only allows for image-based NFTs, but developers say it will be expanded in the future. Lehman noted that Ethscriptions utilize \u201ccall data\u201d which is data derived within a call to a smart contract making it cheaper and more decentralized than others.\n\n\u201cIt guarantees global uniqueness of the content of all valid Ethscriptions. it\u2019s skating to where the puck is going in an L2 world,\u201d he added.\n\nThe launch has already sparked significant interest in major players in the Ethereum network. Within hours of its launch, over 10,000 inscriptions were recorded. The figure grew to over 30,000 over the weekend, with its debut project, \u201cEthereum Punks\u201d being claimed in a few hours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLehman hailed the project as a success, claiming that its high adoption almost led to a temporary crash of the official Ethscription site.\n\nCommunity backs innovation\n\nModelled along the lines of Bitcoin Ordinals, the developers Ethscriptions hope to achieve the same results as the community moved in unison, at least for now. BTC Ordinals was launched with huge dissenting views, with many calling it an \u201cattack\u201d against the normal use of the network.\n\nThese views got louder when the blockchain was congested due to the high inscription volume recorded in May. For Ethscriptions, most users focus on the positives calling for more innovation and adoption. Adam McBride, an NFT enthusiast, capped off the community\u2019s sentiment with his views.\n\n\u201cThe exciting thing for me about Ethscriptions, similar to Ordinals, is that developers are playing around again with blockchain technology. It\u2019s this experimentation that drives innovation and adoption,\u201d he stated.\n\nDespite this, McBride also noted that technology has existed on the network for years with few artists deploying it, noting that this would be the first time it gets massive publicity."

The project gets its security from Bitcoin miners via a process known as merged mining that originally was presented by Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto in 2010.\n\nJust as layer 2 networks or \u201crollups\u201d atop the Ethereum blockchain allow for faster transactions, the Rollux network can process 700 transactions per second assuming basic transfer, versus three to five per second on the base Syscoin layer, according to Sys Labs CEO Jagdeep Sidhu.\n\n\u201cMerged mining is a way to provide another system to open the doors to scale into a rollup,\u201d Sidhu said in an interview. He said the project has been in the works for eight years.\n\nRollups like Optimism, Arbitrum and zkSync have profilerated atop Ethereum, notorious for its sometimes exorbitant fees, as a means of avoiding congestion. Bitcoin (BTC) is the original and largest blockchain and is considered the most secure, but lacks Ethereum\u2019s programmability via smart contracts.\n\nSidhu said a deal has been struck to store data on Filecoin via Lighthouse Storage."

The event will feature captivating talks, engaging panels, immersive workshops and a vibrant festival atmosphere, encouraging holistic growth of the mind, body and soul. Networking spaces will provide ample opportunities for forging meaningful connections, while a hackathon will spur innovation and inspire partnerships.\n\nManu Alzuru, founder of DoinGud and co-organiser of ETHBarcelona, said:\n\n\u201cMany of us got into Web3 to build a better world where technology serves as a catalyst for positive transformation. Our mission at ETHBarcelona is to foster a sustainable community where we promote ethical tools that safeguard the principles of human freedom, sovereignty and privacy. Our event is more than a conference \u2014 it is a festival of ideas and a celebration of knowledge exchange that transcends boundaries. We believe in cultivating a holistic environment that nurtures the growth of the mind, body and soul like no other event in the Web3 space. We will keep fostering a community dedicated to creating public goods and leaving a lasting impact on our collective journey toward a brighter tomorrow.\u201d\n\nETHBarcelona anticipates a remarkable turnout comparable to the previous year, as 2,200 enthusiastic attendees gather to engage in exploration, learning and collaboration. Emphasizing its commitment to inclusivity and diversity, preliminary data reveals that 50% of the event\u2019s speakers and 40% of its attendees are women. The event aims to foster an environment where individuals from diverse backgrounds can come together to contribute their unique perspectives and collectively shape the future of technology.\n\nAbout ETHBarcelona\n\nETHBarcelona is a community-led passion project about the Ethereum blockchain, cryptocurrency and decentralization that celebrates the community and its values. It focuses on education, innovation, art and creating positive social impact. The event\u2019s goal is to give people the tools they need to further their knowledge in blockchain technology and learn how to build projects that can make an impact on society."

        "title": "Best NFT Wallets for 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "5 best NFT wallets\n\nHere are some of the top NFT wallets available right now.\n\n1. Metamask\n\nMetamask is one of the most popular cryptocurrency wallets. Its browser extension provides easy access to web3 sites such as NFT marketplaces with just a couple of clicks. Metamask also makes it easy to set up multiple addresses so you can hold your NFTs at an address that's separate from your cryptocurrency, or you can set up a single address for each NFT you purchase.\n\nConsenSys, the company behind Metamask, built a mobile application in 2020. Holdings sync flawlessly across the desktop and mobile versions of the wallet. The mobile application also includes a built-in browser for decentralized applications, or dApps, and NFT marketplaces.\n\nIf you need to swap currencies to buy an NFT, Metamask has a built-in swap feature. You can also limit how much you pay in gas fees, though there's the risk of a transaction failing. If you need to use a different blockchain, Metamask offers support for alternative platforms.\n\n2. MathWallet\n\nMathWallet offers a strong alternative to Metamask. Its biggest differentiator is that it supports more than 150 blockchains. It offers a web, desktop, and mobile version of the wallet that sync across devices, and it has integrations with several hardware wallets as well. Math Wallet will also let you create multiple addresses.\n\nMath Wallet has a dApp browser built in that enables users to view NFT marketplaces. It includes several other features for cryptocurrency holders -- staking, swapping, etc. -- and it also offers its own utility token.\n\n3. AlphaWallet\n\nAlphaWallet is an open-source cryptocurrency wallet. While it has a few limitations -- it's mobile-only and Ethereum-only -- its native support for blockchain games and NFTs makes it stand out.\n\nThe simple user interface makes it very easy for beginners to understand. There's a whole section of the wallet dedicated to NFTs and gaming tokens. It also allows users to add meta tags to their tokens so they can easily search and filter them when browsing their collection.\n\nAlphaWallet works directly with OpenSea, CryptoKitties, Dragonereum, and ChainZ Arena, among other NFT marketplaces and blockchain games. Like others, it has a built-in dApp browser to find more NFT marketplaces and direct access to DeFi applications such as Compound.\n\n4. Coinbase Wallet\n\nMany people know Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) for its cryptocurrency exchange. It also offers a non-custodial wallet suitable for holding NFTs and other tokens. Unlike holding cryptocurrency on Coinbase's exchange, holding assets in the Coinbase Wallet gives the user full control over their crypto.\n\nCoinbase released a browser extension in 2021, making it easier for users to use their wallet across devices to purchase NFTs and use other dApps. Users can also access dApps through the built-in browser in the mobile wallet.\n\nOne unique advantage of Coinbase Wallet is the ease of transferring tokens to others by using usernames instead of public wallet addresses. It can make transactions feel more personal and provide a greater sense of security knowing that you're sending assets to the right person.\n\nCoinbase also offers a one-click cloud backup for your private keys, storing them on your personal cloud drive. That can help ensure that you don't lose access to your NFTs or other funds held in the wallet.\n\n5. Ledger NFT Wallet\n\nLedger is a hardware wallet -- a small piece of kit that's usually around the size of a USB. You can use it to keep your crypto assets offline in what's known as \"cold storage.\" Generally speaking, hardware wallets are more secure than hot wallets, which are connected to the internet. There are several hardware crypto wallets that work with NFTs, including Trezor. However, Ledger stands out because it connects to top NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea and Rarible.\n\nLedger has several different devices at different price points. Each of them support multiple cryptocurrencies as well as NFTs. You can connect all Ledger products to Windows and Mac systems. Be aware the Ledger Nano S Plus, which is the lowest cost option doesn't connect to iPhones or iPads. Ledger also suffered a security breach in 2020. While no crypto assets were lost, hackers accessed customer information and the company's reputation took a hit."

        "content": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors are starting to lose confidence in the project after several setbacks in 2023. These setbacks have caused Shiba Inu\u2019s value to fall to its lowest value since 2021, with thousands of investors selling their holdings.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) and Collateral Network (COLT) are quickly becoming fan favorites, with many choosing a dollar cost averaging (DCA) strategy to build their portfolios.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai Success Halted By The SEC Announcement\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade was a huge success. It pushed Ethereum\u2019s value to over $2000 and triggered a huge influx in the number of investors staking their Ethereum holdings.\n\nIts most notable feature was the new ability for stakers to withdraw assets from the Ethereum Beacon Chain. This new option has resulted in an additional 2.96 million ETH being staked in May, a sign of how popular Ethereum has become.\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price has declined by 7.59% in the past ten days following the SEC lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase. At the time of writing, Ethereum was down to $1,672.89.\n\nNonetheless, investors remain bullish about Ethereum. Ethereum\u2019s daily trading volume is consistently hitting over $7 billion, and the amount of Ethereum being staked is the highest it\u2019s been in 2023.\n\nShiba Inu Hits A Two Year Low\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s price fell to its lowest level since 2021 this week, declining to $0.00000543 following new SEC lawsuits. This marks a monthly decline of 23.00%, with Shiba Inu trading at $0.00000675 at the time of writing.\n\nGiven that Shiba Inu has failed to give back to its audience several times in 2023, price predictions are now turning bearish. Just one month before its crash, Shibarium, Shiba Inu\u2019s new layer 2 scalability platform, was delayed once again, causing frustration throughout the community.\n\nAlthough holders are looking to salvage Shiba Inu by burning tokens, its value continues to decline. Consequently, Shiba Inu\u2019s daily trading volume has dropped below $65 million and many holders are choosing to sell.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCollateral Network Presale Is Expected To Rise By 3500%\n\nThe Collateral Network presale is one of the fastest growing in the market. Having already increased in value by 68%, momentum is continuing to build with hundreds of new investors buying into the project daily.\n\nCollateral Network is a DeFi asset-backed lending marketplace designed for assets such as supercars, real estate, and other premium assets. The project has been doxxed and KYC audited, and Collateral Network tokens also have locked liquidity for 33 years.\n\nThe aim of Collateral Network is to replace many of the outdated systems in the crowdlending market. To begin, Collateral Network values assets using AI and mints them as fractionalized NFTs. NFT fractions are then sold to investors who loan cryptocurrency to fund the loan and are rewarded with a fixed interest rate.\n\nBefore the end of its presale, Collateral Network\u2019s native token is expected to increase 35x, the current price of the token is a bargain $0.0241 and represents a 141% increase for early buyers.\n\nHolders will be granted a number of bonuses and enjoy several additional price increases once COLT tokens are listed on major exchanges, making COLT one of the most in-demand presale tokens in the market.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://presale.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Hedera vs. Ethereum: Find the Right Chain for the Right Job - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "What you will learn\n\nUnlike Ethereum, Hedera is natively Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)-resistant. This ensures that DEXs and other decentralized finance applications and marketplaces are fairer to users.\n\nHedera, but not Ethereum, offers asynchronous Byzantine fault tolerance, which affords fair transaction ordering, consensus timestamps, and leaderless node operation.\n\nA single Hedera transaction requires only 0.02 watt-hours per transaction but 30 watt-hours on the Ethereum network.\n\nHedera transactions settle with finality in 3-5 seconds, while it can take up to 15 minutes on Ethereum.\n\nDecentralized applications rely on cryptographic and distributed ledger technology for trusted digital transactions, but the technology can come in varied forms. Hedera and Ethereum are two very different types of distributed ledgers that enable developers to build and deploy smart contracts to create immutable and transparent economies, while improving business processes. Ethereum, one of the leading blockchain-based ledgers, is very well known. Hedera is smaller, but is quickly carving out its place in the web3 space.\n\nWhen you weigh Hedera vs Ethereum, your first point of comparison is the former\u2019s directed acyclic graph (DAG) technology, hashgraph, with the latter\u2019s blockchain format. Understanding DAG-based ledgers is essential to understanding the difference between the two networks.\n\nIt also helps to understand what it means to be asynchronous Byzantine fault tolerant (ABFT). ABFT is an essential measurement of whether a ledger is safe against attackers, and Hedera is one of the only public aBFT layer 1 networks in the broader web3 market.\n\nThis article will examine those issues and more as it compares Hedera and Ethereum and their roles in a decentralized economy.\n\nAn overview of Hedera and Hashgraph Consensus\n\nThe Hedera network was launched in 2018 to overcome five major obstacles faced by distributed ledger technologies (DLTs): performance, security, governance, stability, and regulatory compliance. Hedera believed the most compelling DLT use cases required consensus latency measured in seconds. Per Hedera\u2019s whitepaper, it was also essential that \u201ca general-purpose public ledger be governed by representatives from a broad range of market and geographic sectors.\u201d\n\nFrom the get-go, Hedera aimed to be governed by up to 39 leading global organizations, with no single entity having control and no small group having undue influence. Today, the Hedera governing body is led by 28 of the world\u2019s leading organizations, including IBM, Dell, Chainlink, Ubisoft, Google, LG, and Boeing.\n\nCouncil members vote on proposals and codebase changes that are submitted by Hedera\u2019s developer ecosystem through the Hedera Improvement Proposals (HIPs) program. This program ensures that changes to Hedera\u2019s codebase, standards, and ecosystems are driven directly by folks building web3 applications and engaging the network daily.\n\nHedera optimizes its network speeds using a DAG-based architecture. Directed acyclic graphs have vertices and edges that never form a closed loop. When used in a DLT, the distributed node network resembles a graph more closely than a blockchain. For example, Hedera\u2019s gossip-about-gossip protocol lets each node communicate with all others in the network, sharing new information. When one node learns new information, it passes it to a randomly-selected node. Each of the two nodes then selects another random node to share the information with, and those nodes do the same. This graph-based architecture lets nodes pass data throughout the network at unprecedented speeds. Uniquely, gossip-about-gossip also shares how every node on the network has previously voted on transactions when coming to consensus; because every node knows what the others know, this reduces the network\u2019s overall bandwidth and compute consumption when coming to consensus.\n\nHedera\u2019s speeds are further enhanced by its robust mirror network. Mirror nodes function as read-only nodes that contain a verifiable history of all transactions on the network exposed across various network explorers and data APIs. Mirror nodes efficiently pass historical transaction information to users and dApps without impacting the main network, leaving it free to handle transaction processing.\n\nHashgraph consensus\n\nHedera\u2019s hashgraph consensus algorithm is a core element of its operation and success. Hashgraph improves upon blockchain technology in numerous ways. Blockchains can be represented as a single chain of blocks, with new blocks falling in line as the chain grows. If two blocks are created simultaneously, the network must choose one chain and discard the other. Hedera hashgraph comes to consensus on every transaction individually, weaving newly-created transactions back into the ledger and ordering them fairly.\n\nBlockchains must artificially slow down their growth to ensure blocks aren\u2019t added faster than they can be validated. In contrast, there is no negative impact when the hashgraph\u2019s data structure grows quickly.\n\nIts hashgraph algorithm makes Hedera one of the only ABFT distributed ledgers, meaning honest nodes are guaranteed to agree on consensus and the ordering of transactions, even if malicious nodes exist. No distributed ledger network can ensure consensus if more than one third of the nodes are compromised, but ABFT networks are guaranteed to come to consensus if one third or fewer of the nodes are compromised.\n\nAdditionally, with Hedera\u2019s proof-of-stake, there is no bonding or slashing for validators or stakers \u2014 this is because of hashgraph\u2019s aBFT property and lack of a blockchain mempool. Because validators are literally unable to behave nefariously by re-ordering transactions, there is no need for these punitive measures seen on other networks.\n\nConsensus service\n\nHedera is the only layer 1 public network to offer developers a tool to create decentralized logs of immutable and timestamped events for mission-critical web2 and permissionless web3 applications. These applications include tracking products in a supply chain, logging sensitive user access information, building DAO tooling, creating an asset bridge, and more.\n\nEnabled by low, fixed fees, scalable transactions, and native consensus timestamps, the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) acts as a \u201cdecentralized Kafka,\u201d delivering multi-party trust and verifiability for streaming data at web scale.\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nThe Hedera platform is known for its low, fixed fees, scalable throughput of 10,000 transactions per second, and robust security. Transactions on Hedera are paid for using its native token, HBAR cryptocurrency. Payments on Hedera can be performed using institutionally-backed stablecoins, such as USDC, or your own cryptocurrency.\n\nThe Hedera Token Service allows any entity to configure, mint, and manage fungible and non-fungible tokens using just a few lines of code. These tokens map to Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 and 721 standards for interoperability, and the Hedera developer community is always staying up-to-date on the latest standards for Hedera to support via its Hedera Improvement Proposals (HIPs) program.\n\nThe token service is integrated with the Hedera Smart Contract service for enhanced flexibility. Hedera also offers numerous compliance configurations to reduce regulatory burdens, such as optional KYC flags for accounts and token associations. This can prevent spam airdrops by requiring an account to associate a token before successfully receiving it in their account.\n\nSmart contracts\n\nThe Hedera network makes it easy for developers to create and deploy smart contracts using the EVM, as they can configure them using Solidity or port existing Solidity code in just a few minutes. The Hedera Smart Contract service is compatible with the most ubiquitous libraries, tooling, and development environments supported by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This means Ethereum developers can easily start building on Hedera using the tools they\u2019re most familiar with, such as HardHat, Truffle, Foundry, web3JS and ethersJS. In addition, developers and retail users can use MetaMask with the Hedera network to test their dApps or connect into Hedera\u2019s thriving permissionless DeFi, ReFi, and NFT ecosystems.\n\nOverview of Ethereum\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain initially employed a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism. PoW consensus relies on miners competing to solve intricate mathematical problems to gain the right to add new blocks to the blockchain. Miners were incentivized to participate with ETH rewards.\n\nPoW consensus mechanisms were controversial due to the vast computing power needed to reach consensus and the energy it burned. According to Ethereum\u2019s website, their PoW energy requirements were comparable to the nation of Uzbekistan, with a carbon emission equivalent to that of Azerbaijan.\n\nEthereum began transitioning from PoW to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism in 2022. Validators in a PoS system stake ETH to participate in the network. Per Ethereum, this change cut their annual energy consumption from 78 TWh to 0.0026 TWh (2,600,000 KWh).\n\nThe overall structure of Ethereum is made up of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the Ethereum World State. The EVM, a decentralized computer running on every node in the Ethereum network, is responsible for executing smart contracts. The Ethereum World State is a database containing all data on the Ethereum network, such as account balances, transaction history, and smart contract code. The Ethereum World State isn\u2019t stored on the blockchain. It is stored using a Merkle Patricia tree (trie), a data structure with \u201cchild nodes\u201d that branch off of \u201cparent nodes.\u201d\n\nEthereum consensus mechanism\n\nEthereum uses the Gasper consensus mechanism, a collection of technologies that secure Ethereum\u2019s PoS blockchain. Gasper combines Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (Casper-FFG) and the LMD-GHOST fork choice algorithm.\n\nCasper-FFG is a PoS-based partial consensus mechanism that helps the Ethereum network handle network latency or deliberate attacks. In a blockchain, each parent block should link to a single child block. However, if multiple child blocks branch off one parent block, Casper would choose which child block acts as the next link in the canonical chain.\n\nThe LMD-GHOST fork choice algorithm helps the Ethereum network handle forks. When a fork occurs, the LMD-GHOST algorithm chooses the side with more support from validators rather than the side with a longer chain.\n\nGasper helps Ethereum achieve consensus to validate transactions as long as two-thirds of the nodes are honest. Per the Ethereum website: \u201cIn Gasper, there is an additional line of defense against a liveness failure, known as the \u2018inactivity leak.\u2019 This mechanism activates when the chain has failed to finalize for more than four epochs. The validators that are not actively attesting to the majority chain have their stake gradually drained away until the majority regains two-thirds of the total stake, ensuring that liveness failures are only temporary.\u201d\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nETH is the Ethereum network\u2019s native cryptocurrency. Ethereum also has multiple token standards for creating new tokens on the Ethereum network. For example, the ERC-721 standard is used to create NFTs, while the ERC-20 standard is used to create cryptocurrencies and other fungible tokens.\n\nSmart contracts\n\nEthereum was the first blockchain to introduce smart contract technology. Developers can use smart contract coding languages, such as Solidity or Vyper, to deploy automatically-executing smart contracts on the Ethereum network.\n\nComparison of Hedera and Ethereum\n\nNow that you know how Ethereum and Hedera work, let\u2019s compare these peer-to-peer networks.\n\nCost\n\nEthereum transactions require gas fees to cover the computational effort needed to create new blocks. Each block has a base fee that increases exponentially based on the size of the previous block. For transactions to be validated, the gas fee must be equal to or greater than the base fee. This model makes Ethereum fees relatively predictable, but they still vary from day to day.\n\nHedera\u2019s fee structure is decided by its governing council with input from ecosystem stakeholders and is represented in USD but paid in HBAR. Hedera\u2019s low transaction fees comprise a service, network, and node fee. You can use Hedera\u2019s fee calculator to estimate the amount you\u2019ll owe for a particular type of transaction. The calculator lets you choose a Hedera service, such as the cryptocurrency or smart contract service, the configurations you\u2019ll be using, and the number of transactions and signatures.\n\nSustainability\n\nDistributed ledger technology requires energy to process transactions, execute contracts, and run decentralization applications. The required energy depends on the computational effort needed for the task. The Hedera network is carbon-negative, meaning Hedera removes more carbon from the environment than it generates.\n\nThe UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies determined that a single Hedera transaction requires only 0.02 watt-hours. Comparatively, the Ethereum network requires 30 watt-hours (0.03 kilowatt-hours) per transaction.\n\nPerformance\n\nIn its simplest terms, a network\u2019s performance boils down to how many transactions it can handle per second and how quickly they are finalized. Hedera transactions settle with finality in 3-5 seconds, and its native services reliably scale to 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) and beyond. The Ethereum network handles between 27-30 TPS, and finality can take up to 15 minutes.\n\nEase of use\n\nFor the average user, ease of use will be based on the dApps and marketplaces interacting with a given network. This is influenced by how easy it is for developers to use the network. Native Hedera Token Service allows for the creation of ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens interpreted as smart contracts (EVM addresses) created in just a few lines of code. In addition, royalties are configured in just a few lines of code and are at the protocol level, meaning all marketplaces, wallets, and SDKs have to abide by those royalty fees. Hedera offers developers the ability to use familiar libraries, tools, and development environments, such as HardHat, Truffle, Foundry, web3JS, and ethersJS, to build, test, and deploy their smart contract applications on the network.\n\nThe Ethereum network lets developers use Solidity, Vyper, or a range of other common EVM coding languages. This makes it easy for developers to get started with Ethereum.\n\nHedera vs. Ethereum use cases\n\nHedera and Ethereum differ in numerous ways. Hedera\u2019s speed, security, compliance tools, and scalability give it an edge in many industries. However, Ethereum\u2019s popularity makes it better suited for certain applications.\n\nHedera\u2019s speed and security make it ideal for tracking goods and materials through a supply chain. Its low fees make it well-suited for real-time payments, and its compliance tools make it perfect for financial services. Additionally, Hedera is more suitable for government applications because it is secure, affordable, and scalable. Here\u2019s a look at some Hedera use cases.\n\nHedera use cases\n\nNFTs\n\nHedera offers low, fixed fees, native royalties, scalable transactions, and a carbon-negative footprint, making it a robust best network for NFT applications and projects. Royalties are enforced at the protocol level, and you can incorporate NFT royalty fees with just a few lines of code and ensure payment to creators for all secondary sales. Immutable royalties on Hedera are paid by the NFT recipient and can optionally include a fallback fee.\n\nMore than 600,000 NFTs have been minted on the Hedera mainnet and more than 1.1 million NFT transfers have been performed. Hedera\u2019s NFT ecosystem has thousands of fast-growing projects, including the Dead Pixels Ghost Club, Hangry Barboons, and Koala Hash Klub.\n\nHedera and its robust NFT ecosystem offers all the tools developers need to create an NFT marketplace, project, financial application, or ecosystem tool. You can buy, sell, mint, and bid on NFTs using marketplaces and launchpads built on Hedera. And Hedera\u2019s permissionless application ecosystem is a great place to create or import a Hedera account for free, buy HBAR and USDC using a bank card, manage tokens and NFTs, and achieve other goals.\n\nDecentralized Finance\n\nUnlike Ethereum, Hedera is natively Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)-resistant. This ensures that DEXs and other decentralized finance applications and marketplaces are fairer to users.\n\nHedera doesn\u2019t use a mempool to hold transactions prior to their processing and there\u2019s no bribing of nodes. Transactions are guaranteed to be ordered fairly, so there\u2019s no threat of frontrunning. Also, Hedera can process up to 15 million gas per second, the same as what Ethereum aims to achieve in an entire block.\n\nDevelopers can build and deploy EVM-based smart contracts using the most popular languages, including Solidity and Vyper, to create DeFi applications and protocols on Hedera.\n\nSustainability\n\nIn an environmental impact study by UCL comparing different distributed ledger networks, Hedera was proven to be the most sustainable network. With Hedera\u2019s low energy network and with world class governance, developers can build, deploy, or access solutions for fast-growing sustainability ecosystem.\n\nTYMLEZ, a pioneer in the development and delivery of carbon reporting and guarantee-of-origin solutions, was built on the Hedera network. TYMLEZ provides companies across the globe with world-class solutions designed to empower them in their decarbonisation journeys.\n\nAnd the Hedera Guardian is an open-source platform that leverages the Hedera public distributed ledger network to enable digital-first sustainability policies and enables dMRV (Digital Measurement, Reporting, and Verification) requirements-based tokenization implementation. The Hedera Guardian provides auditable, traceable, and reproducible records that document the emission process and lifecycle of carbon credits, which reduces fraud in the ESG market.\n\nDecentralized Logging\n\nHedera is the only layer 1 public network that offers developers a tool to create decentralized logs of immutable and timestamped events for mission-critical web2 and permissionless web3 applications. You can, to name just a few of the many possibilities, track products in a supply chain, log sensitive user access information, build DAO tooling, and create an asset bridge.\n\nWith its low, fixed fees, scalable transactions, and native consensus timestamps, the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) acts as a \u2018decentralized Kafka\u2019, delivering multi-party trust for streaming data at web scale.\n\nPayments\n\nOn Hedera, you can make scalable, real-time, and affordable payments in HBARs, supported stablecoins, or your own cryptocurrency. Hedera enables token issuers to define account-level KYC verification and freeze, token supply management, transfer, and more.\n\nHedera is a USDC-compatible platform and has more than $250 million in USDC liquidity.\n\nHedera is working on a global scale to streamline payments. To expedite cross-border transactions, Shinhan Bank, the leading bank in South Korea, and Standard Bank, the largest bank in Africa, united in a proof-of-concept Stablecoin on Hedera. And Banxa, an international financial technology platform, became in 2022 the first retail platform to support USDC on Hedera.\n\nDecentralized Identity\n\nOn Hedera, developers can build decentralized identity right into their applications. Hedera is a member of W3C and has registered a DID Method to the W3C Credentials Community Group\u2019s Decentralized Identifier (DID) registry.\n\nThe Hedera Consensus Service, using the open DID specification developed by the W3C DID working group, offers developers building on Hedera the ability to manage credentials through their lifecycle in a secure, standards-based and privacy respecting manner.\n\nAmong the organizations taking advantage of Hedera\u2019s performance and efficiency are:\n\nEarth ID, a decentralized identity platform\n\nServiceNow, a digital platform for digital workflow\n\nMeeco, a cloud-based platform for data/identity management and reporting.\n\nHedera, Ethereum, and the future\n\nHedera and Ethereum are two of the leading DLTs for decentralized applications and ecosystems, driven by smart contract innovation and development. Hedera\u2019s DAG architecture and aBFT consensus mechanism make it particularly adept at handling high-throughput transactions, processing fair and secure decentralized finance applications, and meeting regulatory compliance needs. Its low, predictable fees and carbon-negative operations make it an attractive choice for many developers.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s popularity and robust developer community make it a popular choice based on the size of its existing ecosystems. It isn\u2019t as fast or affordable as Hedera, but its transition to a PoS consensus algorithm has made it more energy-efficient than it once was. Choosing whether to use the Hedera or Ethereum network may depend on your intended use case. However, you can easily build new or transfer existing smart contracts from Ethereum to Hedera if you\u2019ve decided to make the switch."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, one of the co-founders of Ethereum, revealed his disfavor for certain aspects of the cryptocurrency sector during a recent Twitter Ask Me Anything (AMA) session.\n\nWhen asked by crypto enthusiast David Hoffman, Buterin conveyed his dissatisfaction with individuals who solely perceive tokenization as the primary breakthrough in cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile acknowledging that tokenization has facilitated the emergence of fresh economic models and democratized the accessibility to financial instruments, Buterin seems to argue that such a narrow perspective undermines the wider scope of the technology\u2019s potential.\n\nCan we truly appreciate the profound impact of cryptocurrencies if we limit their significance to just tokenization?\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe Broader Potential Of Cryptocurrencies: Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Insight\n\nOn Twitter, Buterin expressed his disappointment in those who solely view tokenization as the primary innovation within the realm of cryptocurrencies. This revelation raises important questions about the broader potential and transformative power of this technology.\n\nAs always, people who think that the main innovation of crypto is to put tokens into things. \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) June 28, 2023\n\nUndoubtedly, the advent of tokenization has revolutionized the landscape of economic models and democratized access to financial instruments. By converting real-world assets into digital tokens, tokenization has enabled fractional ownership, increased liquidity, and fostered new avenues for investment. It has empowered individuals worldwide to participate in financial activities that were once exclusive to a privileged few.\n\nHowever, the Ethereum architect contends that restricting the significance of cryptocurrencies to tokenization alone would be an oversight that undermines the technology\u2019s true potential. While tokenization has undeniably been a game-changer, it represents just one facet of the broader transformative capabilities that cryptocurrencies bring to the table.\n\nEthereum: Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Secondary Concerns\n\nAlongside his reservations about the limited perception of tokenization, Buterin highlighted additional challenges that warrant attention.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder also expressed worry over the massive capital misallocation occurring within the cryptocurrency sector. With increased investment and growth, there is a risk of funds being allocated to projects lacking genuine innovation or long-term viability, hampering overall progress.\n\nI feel like there\u2019s lots of #2s: * Massive capital misallocation\n\n* People who easily violate their principles (cough cough fake-libertarians\u2026)\n\n* On the other side, totally unrealistic purist beliefs (\u201c12 word seed phrases are good enough for anyone!\u201d)\n\n* Unnecessary conflict \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) June 28, 2023\n\nIn addition, Buterin noted the potential compromise of principles within the industry. As it gains mainstream attention, individuals may prioritize short-term gains over upholding core principles such as decentralization and transparency, thereby undermining the essence of cryptocurrencies.\n\nHe also cautioned against unrealistic purist beliefs that disregard the complexities and practical challenges faced by the industry. While ideals are essential, they must be balanced with real-world implementation to navigate the industry\u2019s complexities effectively.\n\nEthereum price currently at $1,853 on the ETHUSD daily chart at TradingView.com\n\nLastly, unnecessary conflicts within the cryptocurrency space were a concern for Buterin. While differing perspectives are natural, fostering constructive dialogue and collaboration is vital for the industry\u2019s advancement and collective growth.\n\nButerin\u2019s insights shed light on the challenges that must be addressed to ensure Ethereum and the industry\u2019s sustainable evolution. By tackling issues such as capital misallocation, compromised principles, unrealistic beliefs, and unnecessary conflicts, the cryptocurrency industry can overcome obstacles and pave the way for future growth and innovation.\n\nFeatured image from Security.org"

        "title": "Celsius Cleans House: All Altcoins To Be Sold For Bitcoin And Ethereum | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Defunct crypto lender Celsius Network has proposed a joint reorganization plan to resolve its outstanding claims and interests under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n\nAs part of this plan, Celsius has requested court approval to convert all altcoin holdings, except those designated for Withhold or Custody accounts, to Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to the filing, the conversion will be done using commercially reasonable efforts to maximize value. If the plan is approved, Celsius will begin converting the altcoins on July 1.\n\nCelsius Customers Alert\n\nFor several reasons, celsius\u2019 move to convert all altcoins to Bitcoin and Ethereum is strategic. Firstly, it allows the company to streamline operations by focusing on the two most popular and valuable cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis will simplify the management of Celsius\u2019 cryptocurrency holdings and potentially reduce costs associated with holding and managing a diverse range of altcoins.\n\nSecondly, Bitcoin and Ethereum are widely accepted and traded in the cryptocurrency markets, making them more liquid than most altcoins. By holding Bitcoin and Ethereum, Celsius can easily buy and sell these cryptocurrencies as needed without worrying about other altcoins\u2019 liquidity.\n\nHowever, David Adler, lawyer and representative of Celsius customers, has raised concerns over the company\u2019s proposed reorganization plan. In a statement, Adler claimed that the plan violates consumer lending laws at both the state and federal levels.\n\nAdler\u2019s objection primarily focuses on treating Retail Borrow Claims, which the Debtors have elected to treat through the Set Off Treatment.\n\nAdler argues that although the Debtors are demanding repayment of the loans, they have no intention of performing their contractual obligations by returning the collateral to the borrowers. According to Adler, this is a clear violation of consumer lending laws.\n\nIn addition to this objection, Adler also criticized Celsius for failing to communicate with the borrower group for six to seven weeks. He believes that further exclusivity extensions are not warranted and that Celsius needs to demonstrate \u201ccause\u201d to justify an extension.\n\nThe Celsius Network Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors has already approved the plan, but opposing parties can submit written objections to the court electronically. These objections will be heard during the June 28 hearing, and opposing parties must submit their objections by June 26 and appear in court to have their claims assessed by the court.\n\nOverall, the defunct crypto lender\u2019s proposed plan of reorganization is facing opposition from some parties, including a group of Celsius customers represented by David Adler. It remains to be seen how the court will rule on these objections and their impact on the network\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "Amidst the ongoing battle between bullish and bearish sentiments in the broader cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH) has not been immune to the struggle. The digital currency has been striving to surpass the psychologically significant threshold of $1,900, while its wealthiest non-exchange holders have been accumulating their holdings.\n\nAccording to data shared by Santiment, a blockchain and crypto analytics platform on June 26, the non-exchange addresses with the highest amounts of ETH have been consistently growing richer. Conversely, the top exchange addresses have either reached their lowest holdings or are at levels similar to when Ethereum was first introduced.\n\nthereum top 10 non-exchange vs. exchange holdings. Source: Santiment\n\nIn more specific terms, as of late June 2023, the top 10 non-exchange addresses collectively hold a staggering 33.47 million ETH. This represents the largest quantity ever held by these crypto wallets. On the other hand, the top 10 exchange addresses only hold 6.78 ETH, the smallest amount since September 2015, accounting for a mere 9.2% of the total Ethereum supply.\n\nNavigating the Ethereum Price Landscape\n\nAt the time of reporting, Ethereum was being traded at a value of $1,874.88, reflecting a decrease of 0.98% within the day. However, the cryptocurrency has managed to maintain moderate weekly gains of 8.41% and a modest increase of 1.41% on its monthly chart, based on the most recent data retrieved on June 27.\n\nAdditionally, it is noteworthy that according to the Ethereum Rainbow chart, the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization is projected to fall within the range of $2,593 to $3,668 or the range of $5,290 to $7,705 by January 1, 2024. This suggests that Ethereum has the potential to surpass the $1,900 milestone in the coming months.\n\nThe Rainbow Chart provides valuable information regarding possible price levels for Ethereum, drawing from its past performance. It enables investors to visualize historical areas where ETH has faced resistance or found support, indicating potential upper and lower price boundaries.\n\nCurrently, the Rainbow Chart indicates that Ethereum is situated within the \u201cHODL!\u201d band (highlighted in yellow). This suggests that it could be an opportune time to consider investing in ETH, as the chart implies a likelihood of price appreciation from this point onward."

        "title": "Ethereum Co-founder Joseph Lubin Says Eth Is a Commodity - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "In an interview, Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin argued that ETH is a commodity, even if Gensler may not admit it. The regulatory landscape in the United States mainly tries to redeem cryptocurrencies and tokens into security; the Securities and Exchange Commission chair, Gary Gensler, once needed to specify the ETH classification during a screening.\n\nEthereum is a Commodity, says Joe Lubin\n\nThe recently released Hinman documents, which is a 2018 speech given by former SEC commissioner Bill Hinman, has garnered a lot of attention. People working in the agency argued that this could create confusion that the SEC has agreed on classifying ETH as non-security.\n\nMoreover, Lubin feels that when Ethereum transitioned from energy intensive proof-of-work (PoW) consensus to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is crossed the border of being called a security. The Canadian-Amarican entrepreneur, contributed heavily towards development of the second most powerful blockchain ecosystem. He is also the founder of a Brooklyn-based software production studio, ConsenSys.\n\nThe main factor slowing regulatory authorities from bringing a comprehensive regulatory framework is the classification of digital assets. The tussle between the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC is far from over. If they are classified as commodities, they come under CFTC; if they are securities, they\u2019ll be governed by the SEC.\n\nThe upcoming two digital assets legislation would provide significant power to the CFTC. Slated to be voted on in early July 2023, it would place CFTC ahead of the financial watchdog SEC in the race to instil crypto regulations.\n\nPer the Howey test used to classify assets as securities, a security is any financial instrument associated with a kind of investment contract. On the other hand, a commodity is an essential or natural good, for instance, gold, wheat, etc. Lubin argued that the CFTC often asserted that the agency considers Ether as a commodity.\n\nCFTC chairman Rostin Benham also argues that some of the cryptocurrencies are securities. He also thinks that the top three digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether, and Tether, fall under the jurisdiction of the CFTC.\n\nDuring his tenure as an MIT professor, SEC chair Gary Gensler lectured on classifying cryptocurrencies into securities and commodities. However, the regulatory crackdown on the crypto industry by the agency over the past few years, with an aim of declaring every other cryptocurrency as a security is contradictory to his statements as a professor.\n\nBerenberg argued in a June 21, 2023 report that after attacking digital assets and crypto exchanges for unregistered securities, their next target could be stablecoins and decentralized finance (DeFi). Stablecoins act as the backbone of the entire DeFi system. Hence a blow at the right point could hamper the whole ecosystem.\n\nMembers of Congress, including Cynthia Lummis and Kristen Gillibrand, are trying to clear the air surrounding the classification of cryptocurrencies. They are drafting legislation helping the cause and echoing CFTC\u2019s belief that Ether and Bitcoin are commodities.\n\nThe Hinman documents were unsealed on June 13, 2023, and they revealed that the financial watchdog of the United States might need to be a better agency to police the crypto industry. During a 2018 speech, he argued that Ether should not be classified as securities.\n\nThe regulatory action by the SEC against the crypto industry increased by 183% after the infamous FTX collapse. In their defence, the regulators are trying to safeguard the citizens from investing in an unregistered financial instrument, but their modus operandi is not welcomed by the crypto community."

        "content": "During an interview with CNBC, Consensys creator Joseph Lubin recently shared his insights on Ethereum (ETH) and its classification. Lubin referred to previous statements from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to support his argument that Ethereum should be categorized as a commodity.\n\nNotably, he pointed out SEC chairman Gary Gensler\u2019s acknowledgment of Bitcoin as a commodity, while highlighting that Gensler has yet to accept Ether in the same manner formally.\n\nThe founder of Consensys says it's clear Ether is a commodity, not a security amid regulatory crackdown on crypto, as he unveils the first ever survey on perception over crypto and Web3.@ethereumjoseph @tanvirgill2 @willkoulouris #BTC #ETH #TRON #Web3 @Consensys pic.twitter.com/IBIsvdQRlW \u2014 CNBC's Street Signs (@StreetSignsCNBC) June 28, 2023\n\nLubin drew attention to a lecture by former SEC official Bill Hinman in 2018, where he declared Ether not to be a security. He emphasized that 18 of Hinman\u2019s colleagues collaborated on the speech, implying a consensus within the SEC at the time. Lubin indicated that while some regulators may still be deliberating on Ether\u2019s status, he regarded their hesitancy as insignificant.\n\nMoreover, Lubin delved into the advancements within the Bitcoin sector, emphasizing the importance of initiatives aimed at \u201ccleaning up the CeFi rot.\u201d Centralized finance, commonly called CeFi, has been criticized due to its deviation from the decentralized principles of cryptocurrencies. Lubin highlighted the successful innovations and launches in 2022, illustrating the positive trajectory of the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nWith the ongoing discussions surrounding Ethereum\u2019s classification, Lubin\u2019s insights shed light on the regulatory landscape and its impact on cryptocurrencies. While Gensler\u2019s stance on Ether remains uncertain, Lubin\u2019s reference to Hinman\u2019s lecture suggests widespread agreement within the SEC regarding Ethereum\u2019s non-security status. Lubin\u2019s optimistic outlook on the future development of the Bitcoin sector indicates the positive outcomes achieved in 2022 as the industry strives to align with the decentralized ethos.\n\nJoseph Lubin\u2019s recent interview with CNBC addressed Ethereum\u2019s classification as a commodity and shed light on the ongoing regulatory debates. Lubin\u2019s remarks highlighted the significance of previous SEC statements and the need for a clear stance on Ether\u2019s classification.\n\nFurthermore, Lubin emphasized the positive advancements within the Bitcoin sector, showcasing the industry\u2019s efforts to address concerns surrounding centralized finance. As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, regulatory clarity and technological innovation remain critical focal points for industry participants and observers alike."

        "title": "Ultimate showdown: Polygon vs Ethereum - www.crowdwisdom.live",
        "content": "Ultimate showdown: Polygon vs Ethereum\n\nWithin our digital world, Ethereum and Polygon are two significant players in the blockchain space. You might know Ethereum as a leader in this realm, famous for its innovative \u2018smart contracts\u2019 that opened the door for countless new applications. Then we have Polygon, the friendly sidekick, designed to help Ethereum run smoother, faster, and more efficiently. This article will offer an easy-to-understand look at both Ethereum and Polygon, highlighting what they bring to the table, the challenges they face, and how they work together to continuously reshape the online world.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum\n\nWhen talking about blockchain platforms, Ethereum is often one of the first that comes to mind. Introduced in 2015, Ethereum broadened the blockchain horizons by adding a game-changing feature: smart contracts. Think of smart contracts like digital agreements that automatically carry out transactions when certain conditions are met, without needing a middleman. This made Ethereum not just a platform for cryptocurrency, but also a tool to build a whole new kind of online application, known as Decentralized Applications (DApps).\n\nHowever, despite its innovative leap, Ethereum has had some hiccups. The platform\u2019s ability to process transactions is a bit like a busy highway during rush hour \u2013 it can handle only around 15 transactions per second. When compared to traditional financial systems that handle thousands of transactions per second, it\u2019s easy to see why this could be a bottleneck.\n\nAnother challenge lies in Ethereum\u2019s \u2018gas fees\u2019. Now, these aren\u2019t fees for filling up your car, but rather fees for processing transactions on the Ethereum network. They act like a service charge, and when the network gets congested, these gas fees can skyrocket, making transactions expensive.\n\nUnderstanding Polygon\n\nEnter Polygon, the superhero sidekick to Ethereum\u2019s protagonist. Born as Matic Network and later rebranded to Polygon, this platform aims to enhance Ethereum\u2019s performance by tackling its challenges head-on.\n\nImagine you\u2019re trying to send a large file over email, but it\u2019s just too big to go through. What do you do? You might use a service that can compress or \u2018zip\u2019 the file to make it smaller. That\u2019s kind of what Polygon does for Ethereum. It compresses transactions to make them faster and cheaper.\n\nOne of the ways Polygon achieves this is through a method called \u2018side chains\u2019. Imagine a busy highway (Ethereum). Now, imagine if we built a bunch of extra lanes (side chains) to help handle the traffic. This allows Polygon to speed up the process, handling up to 65,000 transactions per second on a single side chain. That\u2019s a big leap from Ethereum\u2019s transaction count!\n\nAnd those gas fees we talked about? Well, because Polygon processes transactions on these side chains instead of directly on Ethereum, it can reduce those costs significantly. So, you can make many more transactions without breaking the bank.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all Polygon does. It also allows different blockchain networks to communicate with each other more easily, similar to how your phone can connect to different Wi-Fi networks. This interconnecting feature makes Polygon extremely flexible and widens its usability.\n\nComparison Between Ethereum and Polygon\n\nNow that we\u2019ve introduced our two contenders, let\u2019s have a friendly face-off to see how they compare in different aspects.\n\nSpeed: Imagine you\u2019re in a race where Ethereum is a bicycle and Polygon is a sports car. Ethereum, due to its design, can only process about only a few transactions per second. Polygon, with its side lanes, is a speed demon, processing up to thousands of transactions per second on a single side chain. It\u2019s clear who wins the speed round!\n\nCost: Next up is the money round. Transacting on Ethereum can sometimes feel like dining at a fancy restaurant \u2013 great experience, but you might get a heart attack when the bill arrives, thanks to the high gas fees. Polygon, on the other hand, is more like a casual dining place \u2013 you get great service (quick transactions) without emptying your wallet. So in terms of cost-effectiveness, Polygon takes the cake.\n\nFlexibility & Interoperability: Think of Ethereum as a solo artist and Polygon as an orchestra conductor. While Ethereum can handle its own transactions well, Polygon brings together different blockchain platforms to work harmoniously. This interconnection gives Polygon an edge in terms of flexibility and interoperability.\n\nSecurity: When it comes to security, both Ethereum and Polygon take it seriously, like a bank vault guarding your valuables. Ethereum, with its long history and widespread usage, has proven its mettle. Polygon, though newer, ensures security through its architecture. It\u2019s like having a modern security system alongside a trusty guard dog.\n\nYou might be thinking, \u201cWell, it looks like Polygon is the clear winner.\u201d But remember, they\u2019re not competing against each other. Instead, they work together to make the whole ecosystem better.\n\nWhy They\u2019re Not Competitors\n\nEven though we\u2019ve been comparing Ethereum and Polygon, it\u2019s important to understand they\u2019re actually on the same team. They\u2019re more like buddies working together to make the blockchain world more user-friendly.\n\nThink of Ethereum as a popular singer and Polygon as the sound engineer. While the singer gets the crowd going with their voice, the sound engineer enhances the performance with good acoustics. Similarly, Ethereum provides the basic platform and Polygon enhances its performance.\n\nMany projects choose to use both Ethereum and Polygon, leveraging the strengths of both. They utilize Ethereum\u2019s well-established platform and wide acceptance, and Polygon\u2019s speed and low-cost transactions. It\u2019s like having the best of both worlds!\n\nThis cooperative relationship is key to the growth and development of the blockchain ecosystem. With such collaborations, we\u2019re likely to see more innovative and efficient applications in the future.\n\nUse Polygon and Ethereum on BlockWallet\n\nLooking to use both Ethereum and Polygon. The best way to do it is with BlockWallet. This is truly the best Polygon Wallet blending simplicity, convenience, and power in one user-friendly app.\n\nWith BlockWallet, you can easily buy tokens directly using fiat currency, no need for a degree in rocket science. The app simplifies the buying process, making it as easy as getting your favorite e-book online.\n\nWhere BlockWallet really stands out is its ability to bridge tokens between networks. You can move your assets from Ethereum to Polygon (and vice versa) right within the app. This seamless bridging lets you leverage the best of both platforms, depending on your needs, without having to jump through technical hoops.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re ready to embrace the potential of Ethereum and Polygon without the complexities, BlockWallet has you covered. Start your journey today with BlockWallet and take control of your digital assets with ease."

The price is following a bullish flag but ETH seems to be losing momentum below $1,880.\n\nEthereum Price (ETH) Starts Correction\n\nThis past week, we saw a strong increase in Ethereum above the $1,800 level against the US dollar. The ETH/USD pair was able to clear the $1,880 resistance level.\n\nIt even spiked above the $1,920 level but there was no upside continuation. A high is formed near $1,938 and the price is now correcting lower, similar to Bitcoin. There was a break below the $1,880 support level and the 50 Simple moving average (4 hours, blue).\n\nEthereum price 4-hours price chart | Source: ETH/USD on TradingView.com\n\nThere was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,628 swing low to the $1,938 high. The bulls are now active above the $1,800 level.\n\nIt seems like ETH is following a major declining channel with resistance near $1,885 on the 4-hour chart. It is rising and approaching the 50 Simple moving average (4 hours, blue). The first major resistance is near the channel zone at $1,885.\n\nThe next major resistance is near the $1,910 level. The main resistance sits near the $1,935 level. A close above the $1,935 resistance might start a fresh rally. In the stated case, Ethereum could rise toward the $2,000 resistance. The next key resistance is near the $2,150 zone. Any more gains could send ETH price toward the $2,250 level.\n\nMore Losses?\n\nConversely, Ethereum price might struggle to clear the bullish flag resistance at $1,885. Immediate support is seen near the $1,820 level.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,780 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,628 swing low to the $1,938 high. The main support sits at $1,745. If there is a move below $1,745, there is a risk of an extended decline.\n\nIn this scenario, the price may perhaps test the $1,700 support. Any more losses below $1,700 could send the price toward the $1,625 zone.\n\nOverall, Ether\u2019s price is correcting gains below the $1,900 level. If the price fails to clear the $1,900 resistance, it could drop toward $1,780. On the other hand, it could rise toward $2,000."
