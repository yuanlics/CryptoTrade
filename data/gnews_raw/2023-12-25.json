        "content": "If you decided to invest $100 in each BTC and ETH last Christmas, how much would they be worth today?\n\nAs the market is seemingly out of a prolonged crypto winter that began in early 2022, on Christmas day, we\u2019re witnessing a significant contrast in the value of major cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), compared to the previous year\u2019s values.\n\nIf an investor had the foresight to invest or gift someone $100 worth in Bitcoin and Ethereum last Christmas, they would be reaping some handsome profits.\n\nLet\u2019s delve into the numbers. On Christmas Day in 2022, Bitcoin was valued at approximately $16,900. Fast forward to today, it stands at around $43,500. This substantial growth means that a $100 investment in Bitcoin a year ago would now be worth approximately $257.4, representing a 157.4% increase.\n\nYou might also like: SEC met multiple spot Bitcoin ETF applicants on Dec. 21\n\nEthereum has shown a similar performance. It has soared from around $1,200 on Christmas Day 2022 to about $2,290 today. Consequently, a $100 investment in Ethereum last Christmas would now amount to approximately $190.83, marking a 90.8% increase.\n\nHeading into 2024, the market is beaming with positivity, as the hype of Bitcoin ETFs and halving is poised to bring the market back to its all-time highs. Analysts are hoping for this bull market to stretch beyond next Christmas, but it will depend on which side of the scale market sentiment goes in the new year.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Ethereum price is correcting gains from the $2,350 resistance zone. ETH could start a fresh increase if it stays above the $2,200 support zone.\n\nEthereum started a downside correction from the $2,350 resistance zone.\n\nThe price is trading near $2,275 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,285 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could attempt a fresh increase unless there is a close below $2,200.\n\nEthereum Price Remains Supported\n\nEthereum price failed again to gain pace for a move above the $2,350 level. ETH formed a short-term near $2,350 and recently started a downside correction, like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a move below the $2,320 and $2,300 levels. The price even spiked below $2,250. A low was formed near $2,247 and the price is now correcting higher. There was a move above the $2,265 level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,326 swing high to the $2,247 low.\n\nEthereum is now near $2,275 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,285 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,285 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nThe trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,326 swing high to the $2,247 low. A close above the $2,285 resistance could send the price toward $2,350.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA clear move above the $2,350 zone could start a major increase. The next resistance sits at $2,420. Any more gains could start a wave toward the $2,500 level, above which Ethereum might rally and test the $2,550 zone.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,285 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,220 level.\n\nThe first key support could be the $2,200 zone. A downside break and a close below $2,200 might send the price further lower. In the stated case, Ether could revisit the $2,170 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,120 level in the coming sessions.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,200\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,285\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nIn recent weeks, Ethereum\u2019s price has witnessed a growing surge of confidence as the total crypto market cap prepares to gain old momentum. As Bitcoin\u2019s dominance exhibits a minor downturn, traders are increasingly placing their bets on Ethereum. This has steered Ethereum\u2019s price towards critical immediate resistance levels. Analysts are now keenly observing whether Ethereum will break the $2,500 mark, marking a significant surge, or if it will encounter a decline.\n\nOI Loses Momentum Near High\n\nData from Coinglass reveals a recent decline in Ethereum\u2019s open interest (OI), signaling a reduction in market momentum. The OI decreased from a peak of $7.95 billion to $7.57 billion, marking a drop of more than $380 million. This trend indicates that traders are actively closing their futures positions, which in turn is leading to a decrease in Ethereum\u2019s volatility.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, Ethereum\u2019s price experienced a total liquidation exceeding $15 million. This occurred as Ethereum struggled to break above the $2,300 mark, resulting in the liquidation of $10 million worth of long positions.\n\nA recent report by crypto analytics firm IntoTheBlock shows that Ethereum\u2019s market cap has surged by 87% in the past year, rising from about $149 billion to its present value of $280 billion. Despite this growth, Ethereum\u2019s performance, when compared to other major assets, indicates that there is still room for improvement, particularly given the numerous positive developments the asset has undergone in 2023.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Layer 1 scalability challenges and high transaction fees have halted the expansion of its DeFi ecosystem. Despite being a leading player in decentralized applications, Ethereum\u2019s scaling limitations have resulted in high costs and slower transactions, leading to user and developer dissatisfaction.\n\nIn contrast, Solana has been advancing rapidly, outpacing Ethereum with its high throughput and low-cost transactions. Solana has been dominating the altcoin market recently with robust buying demand, capturing a significant market share and surpassing ETH.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nEther\u2019s price surged past the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), reaching $2,300, but failed to hold momentum due to increasing selling pressure. Currently, bears are aiming for a decline to solidify their positions. As of writing, ETH price trades at $2,278, declining over 0.8% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nShould the price remain above $2,300, it is anticipated that Ether might approach its 52-week peak of $2,403. This level is crucial for sellers to defend, as a breakthrough and sustained trading above this mark could trigger the next upward trend phase, potentially pushing the ETH price towards the $2,500 mark.\n\nConversely, if Ether faces resistance at this key level and starts to decline, it might retest the significant support level around $2,200. For the sellers to gain an advantage, they would need to break the ascending support line. In that case, we might see ETH price below the $2K mark."

        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission is pushing back its decision on several Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to May 2024. The agency delayed its decision on the Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF and the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF. The Hashdex Ether ETF aims to hold both spot Ether and futures contracts, while Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Futures ETF is seen as a \u201ctrojan horse\u201d that would corner the SEC into allowing Grayscale to convert its Ethereum Trust to a spot Ethereum ETF. In the filings, the agency said it was instituting proceedings that involve gathering further public input around whether or not the ETFs should be listed. The agency also pushed back its decision on the VanEck spot Ethereum ETF and the spot Ethereum ETF lodged by Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest and 21Shares.\n\nHowever, some analysts still expect approvals by early 2024 regarding Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETFs. Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas anticipate that the U.S. SEC will approve a spot Bitcoin ETF in January 2024 despite multiple last-minute amendments that applicants are scrambling to add to their proposals. Seyffart shared his observations about BlackRock\u2019s latest spot Bitcoin ETF update, which accepted the SEC\u2019s cash redemption system instead of in-kind redemptions or those implying non-monetary payments like BTC.\n\nThe analyst noted that multiple applicants, such as ARK, Bitwise and Valkyrie, have already set up a cash-only model, while some \u2014 including Grayscale and WisdomTree \u2014 still have in-kind or cash in their filings. In mid-December, finance lawyer Scott Johnsson predicted that ETF applicants would eventually have to bend their knee to using a cash creation and redemption model for their ETF.\n\nMontenegro won\u2019t extradite Do Kwon\n\nA court in Montenegro has canceled the extradition approval of Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon to either the U.S. or South Korea. The High Court of Podgorica previously determined the legal requirements for Kwon\u2019s extradition in November 2023, leaving the final decision on Kwon\u2019s extradition to Montenegro\u2019s minister of justice. According to the latest decision by the appeals court, Kwon\u2019s defense has successfully appealed that decision, and the case should be returned to the Podgorica Basic Court for retrial. The panel of the appellate court specifically assessed that the previous decision by the High Court of Podgorica was affected by a \u201csignificant violation of the provisions\u201d of Montenegro\u2019s Criminal Procedure Code.\n\nContinue reading\n\nBinance will pay $2.7 billion to CFTC\n\nA U.S. court has entered an order against crypto exchange Binance and its former CEO, Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao, that will see Binance pay $2.7 billion and CZ pay $150 million to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The CFTC announced that the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois had approved the previously announced settlement and concluded the enforcement action first issued by the CFTC in November. \u201cThe court finds Zhao and Binance violated the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations, imposes a $150 million civil monetary penalty personally against Zhao, and requires Binance to disgorge $1.35 billion of ill-gotten transaction fees and pay a $1.35 billion penalty to the CFTC,\u201d wrote the CFTC in a statement. The approved settlement marks the conclusion of a long-running case against CZ and Binance by the CFTC. The agency sued the executive and his exchange for evading federal law and operating an illegal derivatives exchange.\n\nContinue reading\n\nChina will tighten the regulations of online gaming\n\nThe General Administration of Press and Publication of China (GAPP) aims to restrict the scope of activities related to in-game tokens. The GAPP published a draft of its guidelines for the online games industry, suggesting physical goods purchases and the exchange of game tokens for legal tender should be banned. The guidelines contain 62 articles and cover a wide range of issues related to the regulation of online games. It proposes some stricter regulations: The companies will have to obtain a license in China, store their customers\u2019 data for up to two years, ensure that their content complies with a list of national and socialist values, and expel any opportunity for anonymous registration of users.\n\nArticle 23 regulates the use of game tokens. It intends to ban the use of game tokens for buying physical goods, exchanging them for \u201cproducts and services of other units\u201d or \u201clegal tender.\u201d The latter point leaves room for speculation, given that cryptocurrencies don\u2019t qualify as legal tender in China, and no specific mention of \u201ccrypto\u201d is present in the guidelines. However, it appears the GAPP is trying to insulate online game economies from a tighter interchange with a real economy.\n\nContinue reading"

        "content": "focus-text-wrap]Key Takeaways[/focus-text-wrap]\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF filing could significantly boost Ethereum\u2019s price in 2024, enhancing mainstream adoption.\n\nGlobal regulations will shape Ethereum\u2019s 2024 price, impacting investor confidence in DeFi and NFTs.\n\nIncreased institutional investment and DeFi ecosystem growth in 2024 could drive Ethereum\u2019s demand and price.\n\nMacroeconomic factors, including inflation and market health, will indirectly influence Ethereum\u2019s price in 2024.\n\nIn 2024, the price of Ethereum is likely to be influenced by a number of key factors, including\n\nExchange Traded Fund (ETF)\n\nAs reports surfaced that BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, submitted an application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the iShares Ethereum Trust, a spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF), Ethereum\u2019s price experienced a notable increase and is likely to edge the ETH price higher in 2024.\n\nRegulatory Changes\n\nGlobal cryptocurrency regulations will be crucial, especially given Ethereum\u2019s prominence in the DeFi and NFT sectors. Clear, supportive regulations can boost investor confidence, while restrictive policies might dampen it.\n\nInstitutional Adoption And DeFi Growth\n\nIncreased institutional investment in Ethereum and the expansion of its DeFi ecosystem can drive demand. Ethereum\u2019s ability to attract and sustain big players will be essential.\n\nMacroeconomic Environment\n\nThe broader economic climate, including inflation rates and overall market health, can indirectly sway Ethereum\u2019s price as investors seek digital assets as potential hedges or speculative opportunities.\n\nMarket Trends and Competition\n\nThe overall sentiment in the crypto market and the rise of competing blockchains can impact Ethereum\u2019s dominance and price. Technological advancements within and outside the Ethereum ecosystem will also play a part.\n\nEthereum Vs. Bitcoin Outlook For 2024\n\nUnderstanding The ETH/BTC Ratio: Key Indicator For Altcoin Market Sentiment And Investor Behavior\n\nFor investors and analysts, monitoring the ETH/BTC ratio offers valuable insights into the broader altcoin market. A strengthening ETH against BTC can be interpreted as a sign of bullish sentiment toward altcoins, while a weakening ETH/BTC ratio may suggest a more cautious or bearish outlook.\n\nThis correlation is beneficial for understanding market cycles and investor behavior in the cryptocurrency domain.\n\nImpact Of Proof-of-Stake On The ETH/BTC Price Dynamic Since November 2021\n\nEthereum continues to be a significant player in the cryptocurrency landscape, second only to Bitcoin. In September 2022, Ethereum shifted from the energy-intensive proof-of-work model to a more scalable proof-of-stake framework.\n\nSince November 2021, the ETH/BTC chart has shown a consistent devaluation against Bitcoin. A downward trend indicates that, during this period, holding BTC would have been a more strategic choice in the long term than holding ETH or most altcoins, except for a few outliers that outperformed Bitcoin.\n\nCurrent Market Position And Future Outlook After BlackRock ETF Filing\n\nToward the end of 2023, the ETH/BTC pair is at an exciting juncture. Without a decisive upward movement, there\u2019s a risk of further downside if the critical support level of 0.053-0.049 is not held. However, a crucial development in the market could influence this trajectory.\n\nThe recent move by BlackRock to file for an Ethereum ETF is a significant step that could bolster investor confidence in Ethereum. While the current downtrend might persist in the short term, this development is a potential catalyst for reversing the upside in 2024.\n\nThe ETH/BTC pair may experience a short-term downtrend considering these factors. However, the BlackRock ETF filing could be a pivotal factor for a bullish reversal in the coming year, potentially altering the current market dynamics.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe price of Ethereum and its movement versus Bitcoin in 2024 will likely be shaped by a confluence of factors, including the potential launch of an Ethereum ETF by BlackRock, global regulatory changes, institutional adoption, DeFi growth, and the macroeconomic environment.\n\nThe ETH/BTC ratio remains a critical indicator of market sentiment, with Ethereum\u2019s shift to a proof-of-stake model adding another layer to its price dynamics.\n\nWhile current trends suggest a cautious approach, the anticipated Ethereum ETF and other developments could catalyze a positive shift in Ethereum\u2019s market position. As such, investors and market watchers should closely monitor these evolving factors to navigate the crypto landscape effectively in 2024.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow will an Ethereum ETF affect its price in 2024?\n\nThe potential launch of an Ethereum ETF, like the one proposed by BlackRock, could significantly boost Ethereum\u2019s price in 2024 by increasing mainstream adoption and investor confidence.\n\nWhat role will regulatory changes play in Ethereum\u2019s price in 2024?\n\nEthereum\u2019s price in 2024 will be heavily influenced by global cryptocurrency regulations, especially due to its role in DeFi and NFTs. Supportive policies could enhance investor confidence, while restrictive ones might have a dampening effect.\n\nHow might institutional adoption and DeFi growth impact Ethereum in 2024?\n\nEthereum\u2019s price in 2024 could rise with increased institutional investment and growth in its DeFi ecosystem, as these factors drive demand and showcase Ethereum\u2019s utility and adoption in larger financial contexts.\n\nWhat impact will the macroeconomic environment have on Ethereum\u2019s price in 2024?\n\nThe broader economic climate, including inflation rates and market health, will indirectly affect Ethereum\u2019s price. Investors might turn to Ethereum as a hedge or speculative asset, influencing its market value."

        "title": "Anatoly Yakovenko jokes 'Solana is Ethereum' in ironic social media exchange - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "In a recent exchange on social media, Solana creator Anatoly Yakovenko, made a remark that was misinterpreted in our previous coverage.\n\nIn a Dec. 25 tweet, Yakovenko playfully suggested that Solana could be considered an Ethereum layer-2 (L2) solution through its Wormhole eigenlayer. This statement was part of a tongue-in-cheek response to a tweet listing various L2 solutions like Arbitrum, Aztec, and Polygon. He quipped:\n\n\u201cSolana is ethereum! Solana is an ethereum L2 through the wormhole eigenlayer. Once danksharding is scaled up no one is going to stop you from submitting all the Solana blocks into some data validating bridge contract on ethereum.\u201d\n\nThis playful assertion was meant to ironically juxtapose Solana, a distinct and independent blockchain, with Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 solutions. The mention of a Wormhole eigenlayer and the speculative reference to submitting Solana blocks to Ethereum were part of this jest.\n\nOur initial report, however, presented it seriously and failed to recognize its ironic nature, and thus our coverage suggested that he meant it in earnest. We sincerely apologize for the error and for any confusion caused by our failure to recognize the ironic intent behind it.\n\nOn the rise\n\nYakovenko\u2019s jesting aside, Solana is poised to close the year on a high note. December was a particularly active month for the blockchain, showcasing one of the quickest price recoveries in the final quarter. The total value locked (TVL) on Solana more than doubled, escalating from $671.62 million at the beginning of the month to $1.529 billion by December 26th.\n\nHowever, when denominated in SOL, the increase was more modest, from 11.35 million SOL to 12.56 million SOL in the same period. This discrepancy reflects the significant rise in SOL price, which climbed from $59.2 to $121.4, affecting the USD valuation of the TVL.\n\nNotably, Solana overtook XRP in market cap, becoming the fifth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $34.8 billion as of December 20, 2023, following an 11% increase in Solana\u2019s value, which outpaced the broader market\u2019s 3% gain. The SOL/ETH ratio, comparing Solana\u2019s value to Ethereum\u2019s, also shows recovery, highlighting Solana\u2019s competitive stance.\n\nThe SOL/ETH ratio, a metric comparing the value of Solana (SOL) to Ethereum (ETH), is a critical measure of Solana\u2019s competitive position. This ratio has experienced significant fluctuations, with the most recent data showing a recovery in Solana\u2019s standing against Ethereum.\n\nSolana\u2019s blockchain technology, known for its high performance and scalability, is designed to support decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) use cases. The platform\u2019s success is attributed to its unique consensus algorithm, \u201cProof of History,\u201d which enables high transaction speeds and low fees, making it a popular choice among developers for dApps and DeFi projects."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a recent development that has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community, Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, has raised eyebrows with a significant withdrawal of $13.8 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) from Binance. The transaction was highlighted by PeckShieldAlert, a prominent blockchain security company, in a tweet that raised suspicions surrounding the withdrawal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe tweet mentioned that the address 0x9FCc...19Fe had initiated a withdrawal of 6,166 ETH (equivalent to approximately $13.8 million) from Binance. The mention of \"Suspicious Justin Sun related\" has triggered concerns and speculation within the crypto space, leading many to question the motives behind such a substantial withdrawal.\n\nAs of the latest data , the current price of Ethereum stands at $2,239, reflecting a 1.55% decrease in the last 24 hours. However, the cryptocurrency has witnessed a more significant surge of 7.22% over the past 30 days. Interestingly, despite recent market fluctuations, Ethereum's trading volume has surged by over 14.89% in the last 24 hours, reaching a total of $9,184,315,852.\n\nJustin Sun's cryptic moves\n\nThis development comes on the heels of Justin Sun's earlier notable withdrawals, where he pulled out massive amounts of Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens from Binance. The first withdrawal involved a staggering 500 billion SHIB tokens, followed by another withdrawal of approximately 77 billion SHIB tokens. These transactions had already raised eyebrows within the crypto community, prompting discussions about Sun's strategic moves on the market.\n\nAdding to the intrigue, on May 11, Justin Sun announced his decision to actively engage in trading meme coins and promising projects through his public address. The declaration indicated a shift in Sun's investment strategy, opting for more speculative and meme-driven digital assets.\n\nThe latest Ethereum withdrawal only adds to the growing concerns and speculations surrounding Justin Sun's cryptocurrency activities. The crypto community is now closely monitoring further statements or actions from Sun that may shed light on his motives and intentions behind these significant transactions."

        "content": "Former Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal believes that Ethereum (ETH) is poised to outperform Bitcoin (BTC) over the coming weeks and months as investors move their capital within the crypto markets to generate more gains.\n\nPal tells the 21,300 subscribers of his YouTube channel that Ethereum will \u201cmassively outperform\u201d Bitcoin just like how lower-rated junk bonds tend to surpass the higher-rated treasuries when investors rotate their capital.\n\nAccording to Pal, the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) will positively impact Ethereum as he expects market participants to reinvest their BTC gains in ETH.\n\n\u201cSo ETH is just doing what it\u2019s supposed to be doing. But it\u2019s not giving us the big surprise. I think that surprise comes the moment the ETF is out in Bitcoin and people will focus on the ETH ETF. And it\u2019ll bring the ETH ecosystem alive.\n\nThis year, it\u2019s been a story of Solana which I\u2019ve been long all year, and Bitcoin. That barbell has been the best trade in the world. Or, in fact, just saying SOL has been the best trade in the world bar none. But ETH, it will play catch-up, it will do well.\u201d\n\nTurning to Bitcoin, Pal says that the flagship crypto asset\u2019s price action going forward is likely to mirror its 2015 bull market price action when Bitcoin witnessed a massive burst to the upside without a major correction.\n\n\u201cI think this cycle we\u2019re in now looks more like that 2015, 2016, 2017 than it did 2019-2021. [In] 2019, [Bitcoin] came out of the gates really, really fast then corrected, then we had Covid-19, which we\u2019re not going to repeat.\n\nI know many people are expecting \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going to get a 50% collapse and you buy that one.\u2019 It\u2019s not going to happen.\n\nOf course, you\u2019ll get corrections. I think they\u2019re most likely more sideways, give or take a 20% to 30% range, because that\u2019s the world we live in in crypto.\n\nBut we should keep going into the end of 2025 if we\u2019re just repeating the same old cycle, which I think we are.\u201d\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSolana, which soared past the $100 mark over the weekend, has cooled slightly. At the time of this writing, SOL is trading for $109.20\u2014down 11% in the past day.\n\nBut notably, SOL has remained above $100 since it edged past that milestone on Saturday. This increase is part of a broader positive trend in the crypto market, with Solana's market capitalization ranking it as the fourth largest crypto asset. That's spurred a lot of trading activity. In the past day, volume reached $5.6 billion, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn fact, SOL did its highest 1-day volume of the year\u2014$6.2 billion\u2014and could be on track to beat that again today. It's now doing more than double the volume that Binance's BNB token has seen in the past day. BNB is a utility token for the Binance crypto exchange, which is used to trade and pay fees. Solana recently flipped BNB and took its spot as the fourth-largest asset by market capitalization on CoinGecko.\n\nMeanwhile Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest crypto assets by market capitalization, have each taken a 4% haircut. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $41,861.48 and Ethereum for $2,197.27.\n\nBoth BTC and ETH have rallied, thanks to anticipation around possible spot ETF approvals. A handful of Ethereum ETF applications have only recently been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but analysts expect that the SEC will issue a decision on several Bitcoin ETF applications in the next two weeks.\n\nSolana's recent performance has been particularly noteworthy, considering its association with the fallen crypto empire FTX and the disgraced crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried. Despite the turmoil surrounding FTX's bankruptcy in November 2022, Solana has made a remarkable recovery, with an 880% increase year-to-date. This rebound is further highlighted by a significant rise in network activities and an increase in new addresses on the Solana network.\n\nThe institutional interest has been accompanied by lots of meme coin activity. Solana meme coin BONK has held onto its place in the top 100 assets, although it has fallen a bit since rising as high as 69. BONK hit an all-time high after it began trading on Coinbase. Despite its rapid rise, it's still an incredibly volatile meme coin. It's currently trading for $0.00001615, down 15% since yesterday.\n\nThere's an even newer dog-themed meme coin, too: Dogwifhat. It rose as high as $0.33 on Friday\u2014an all-time high for the coin that had only started trading on December 13. However, it has since lost some of that momentum and is currently trading at $0.15, down 30% in the past 24 hours.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This article was written with the assistance of AI.

        "content": "Ethereum price is consolidating gains below the $2,350 resistance zone. ETH could revisit the $2,200 support before it starts a fresh increase.\n\nEthereum is still holding gains above the $2,250 support zone.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,280 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,290 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could extend its decline and revisit the $2,200 support zone.\n\nEthereum Price Remains In A Range\n\nEthereum price started a downside correction from the $2,350 level. ETH declined below the $2,320 and $2,300 levels. It even spiked below the $2,250 level.\n\nA low was formed near $2,247 and the price is now attempting a fresh increase, like Bitcoin. There was a move above the $2,265 level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,327 swing high to the $2,247 low.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $2,280 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,290 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,290 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nThe trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,327 swing high to the $2,247 low. A close above the $2,290 resistance could send the price toward $2,320.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe main resistance sits at $2,350. A clear move above the $2,350 zone could start a major increase. The next resistance sits at $2,420, above which Ethereum might rally and test the $2,550 zone.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,290 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,250 level.\n\nThe first key support could be the $2,220 zone. A downside break and a close below $2,220 might spark more bearish moves. In the stated case, Ether could revisit the $2,120 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,040 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,220\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,290\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "An analyst who nailed the end of the 2021 Bitcoin bull market believes that Ethereum (ETH) will rally behind a catalyst that\u2019s been overshadowed by the potential approval of a spot market BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nPseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 727,600 followers on the social media platform X that the possible approval of spot Ethereum ETFs next year will likely give ETH a much-needed shot in the arm.\n\nEarlier this year, multiple asset management firms including BlackRock, Fidelity and Hashdex filed applications for spot-based Ethereum ETFs with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nPentoshi says that Ethereum will likely generate bullish momentum as market participants anticipate the event.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been bull tweeting the BTC ETF since $25,000-$28,000. Soon, we get to do this all again with the ETH ETF in 2024.\n\nNo matter what you believe, it\u2019s all game theory. As the date approaches, people will be less willing to sell, and others will feel the need to buy. $2,7xx and $3,400 on the table.\u201d\n\nPentoshi is not the only crypto strategist who believes 2024 will be a good year for ETH. Trader Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe tells his 678,200 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum is likely in the process of carving a bottom against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC).

        "title": "The year of ZK-proofs: 4 layer 2s that helped Ethereum scale in 2023 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s ongoing evolution has gathered pace in 2023, with the ecosystem shifting focus to scaling solutions and protocols to improve throughput and reduce costs for decentralized applications (DApps) and users.\n\nThe transition from energy-intensive proof-of-work mining to a proof-of-stake consensus also laid the foundation for what had previously seemed like impossible scalability upgrades before the Merge. Several approaches have emerged that enable the network to handle more transactions without increasing the size of nodes.\n\nLayer-2 solutions have become the favored mechanism for scaling Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem. These networks, which operate independently from Ethereum\u2019s chain, process and batch transactions as \u201crollups\u201d before submitting the summary data to Ethereum. Rollups aim to increase Ethereum\u2019s throughput and reduce the cost of transactions for users.\n\nRelated: Are ZK-proofs the answer to Bitcoin\u2019s Ordinal and BRC-20 problem?\n\nEthereum has two types of rollups that currently help the network scale. The first is optimistic rollups, which execute transactions off-chain and post transaction data to the mainnet as call data.\n\nAs Ethereum\u2019s information database explains, these rollups are dubbed \u201coptimistic\u201d because they assume off-chain transactions are valid and don\u2019t publish proofs of validity for transaction batches posted on-chain.\n\nThis is a distinguishing factor from zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups), which also bundle transactions off-chain but submit a validity proof of the changes required to represent all transactions in a batch.\n\nThe validity proof is a cryptographic assurance that the state changes proposed by the rollup come from having actually executed the transactions themselves. ZK-rollups only need to provide validity proofs to finalize transactions instead of posting all transaction data on-chain like optimistic rollups.\n\nRelated: Ethereum\u2019s proto-danksharding to make rollups 10x cheaper \u2014 Consensys zkEVM Linea head\n\nThere is no delay when moving funds from a ZK-rollup to Ethereum\u2019s mainnet because transactions are executed when the ZK-rollup contract verifies the validity proof. Withdrawals from optimistic rollups have a delay that allows users to carry out fraud proofs to double-check the validity of batched transactions.\n\nWhile opinions vary, ZK-powered layer 2s have become increasingly popular in 2023 because they bypass the need for fraud proofs. A handful of solutions powered by the technology have taken center stage, and Cointelegraph revisits the leading players that have emerged this year.\n\nPolygon zkEVM\n\nPolygon has become a household name in the Ethereum scaling ecosystem, and the protocol has made significant strides in developing its tech stack in 2023. This includes the evolution of its own Polygon zkEVM and its Chain Development Kit, which allows developers to launch bespoke ZK-powered layer-2 protocols on Ethereum tailored to the requirements of their project.\n\nPolygon released its open-source zkEVM mainnet beta in March 2023, which delivers reduced transaction costs and increased throughput of smart contract deployments. The technology allows thousands of transactions to be batched off-chain, with cryptographic proof containing a minimal data summary posted to the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nPolygon\u2019s zkEVM mimics the transaction execution environment of Ethereum\u2019s mainnet. The open-source zkEVM allows DApps to scale through transaction batching, unlocking higher performance.\n\nThe Polygon zkEVM explorer reflects the usage of the network from its inception in March 2013, with over 8.6 million transactions processed to date. Over the past six months, the network has processed an average of 20,000 to 40,000 daily Ethereum transactions.\n\nZkSync Era\n\nZkSync Era claims to be the first Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible ZK-rollup to launch an alpha version of its network, which it did in February 2023 after a lengthy four years under development by Matter Labs.\n\nThe alpha release the following month grabbed headlines as major decentralized finance players \u2014 including Uniswap, Sushi, Maker and Curve \u2014 launched on the zkEVM.\n\nSource: DaapRadar\n\nThe network has attracted a significant user base since then, with data from DappRadar reflecting over 150 active DApps at the time of writing. The network also has 6.2 million unique active wallets and has processed more than 200 million transactions to date at seven transactions per second, according to information from L2scan.\n\nLinea\n\nConsensys, the development firm behind core Ethereum products like MetaMask, joined the ZK-rollup race with its zkEVM network, Linea.\n\nThe platform allows Ethereum developers to build or migrate DApps to its networks and went live with its alpha release in July 2023. Linea was integrated with Ethereum\u2019s browser-based wallet MetaMask, giving Linea users access to its token bridge, swap and buy functionality.\n\nSource: L2scan\n\nLinea completed its public launch in August 2023 and bridged over $26 million in Ether (ETH) in its first month of existence. Linea currently has over 2 million unique active wallets and has processed 34 million transactions since its launch to mainnet. Data from L2scan also reflects that the network can process five transactions per second.\n\nStarknet\n\nStarknet joins this list of layer 2s that have scaled Ethereum, operating as a validity rollup or ZK-rollup. It is not classified as a zkEVM, as it operates on its native Cairo virtual machine and bespoke programming language.\n\nAccording to Starknet\u2019s developer resource, the Cairo VM is intentionally tailored for validity proof systems and is touted to be optimized for memory access. Starknet notes that EVMs read and write memory requires more computation to generate proofs.\n\nSource: Starknet\n\nDespite operating on a different type of virtual machine, Starknet provides the same functionality as Polygon zkEVM, Linea and zkSync Era in that it bundles transactions into an off-chain computed STARK proof.\n\nAt the time of writing, Starknet\u2019s ecosystem metrics reflect 48,104 ETH bridged into the network, valued at $108 million. The layer 2 has processed 19.4 million transactions\n\nWatch this space\n\nZK-rollups continue to attract significant value from the broader Ethereum ecosystem, given the throughput increase and reduced costs provided by the central players touched on above.\n\nThe latter half of 2023 also saw the likes of Scroll, another zkEVM, go live, showcasing the increasing number of ZK-powered layer 2s coming online.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of room for healthy competition, though. Several project leads have expressly told Cointelegraph that a variety of ZK-powered platforms serve to make the Ethereum ecosystem more robust.\n\nMagazine: Big Questions: What did Satoshi Nakamoto think about ZK-proofs?"

        "content": "Crypto traders\u2019 interest in Solana remains very high as the trading volume for the digital asset surpassed that of Bitcoin and Ethereum on major centralized exchanges during the weekend.\n\nConor Grogan, a director at Coinbase, first pointed out this milestone on Dec. 24, saying SOL saw more trading than the combination of the top two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.\n\nRiyad Carey, an analyst with Paris-based crypto intelligence platform Kaiko, further corroborated this finding, saying the same trend was observed on Kraken and Gemini, two of the largest U.S.-based crypto trading platforms.\n\nSOL\u2019s trading volume also beat BTC and ETH on UPbit and MEXC for the past 2 and 3 days, respectively.\n\nCarey further shared a chart showing that SOL\u2019s trading activities, compared to ETH and BTC, were experiencing an uptrend. According to the chart, SOL trading is approaching 40% of trading activities on centralized crypto platforms, while ETH and BTC were declining.\n\nAccording to Carey, these metrics are \u201cunprecedented\u201d and show the sustained interest SOL is currently generating in the market.\n\nWhy SOL volume is rising\n\nOver the past year, Solana has experienced remarkable growth, defying earlier associations with Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder of the bankrupt FTX cryptocurrency exchange. Despite this, the network has flourished, attracting an expanding user base.\n\nDuring this period, Solana forged strategic alliances with renowned global financial players like Visa and Shopify. These partnerships harness blockchain technology to streamline payment procedures, showcasing SOL\u2019s network\u2019s potential to a broader global audience.\n\nMoreover, the recent surge in interest surrounding the Solana-based BONK memecoin and the resurgence of decentralized finance (DeFi) activities on the smart contract-enabled blockchain have contributed significantly to its recent upward trajectory.\n\nThese developments have helped push the price of SOL to new highs, up more than 800% on the year-to-date metric to nearly $120 as of press time, according to CryptoSlate\u2019s data."

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a sudden market shake-up, over $170 million worth of Solan, Bitcoin and Ethereum were liquidated, as depicted by the latest crypto liquidation data. This flash-crash event has rattled the crypto sphere, occurring just a week before the New Year \u2014 a time when such volatility is not typically unexpected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe end-of-year period often sees a shift in market behavior. Retail investors are known to cash out for the holidays, and larger investors close their positions to avoid unpredictable swings during times of reduced liquidity. The liquidation data reflects this trend, showing a substantial number of positions being wiped out in the face of rapid price movements.\n\nOrder books tend to thin out during the holiday season, with reduced trading volumes and some market makers stepping back, increasing the potential for volatility spikes. This environment can lead to quick and severe market movements, as currently evidenced on the crypto market.\n\nDespite this, the overall market still exhibits signs of an uptrend. The $170 million in liquidations, while significant, is not indicative of a market downturn but rather a typical response to the year-end climate. It is a pattern familiar to seasoned crypto enthusiasts, where the combination of profit-taking and risk aversion can momentarily disrupt the market.\n\nHistorically, as the New Year begins and normal trading volumes resume, the market stabilizes. The situation usually improves by mid-January, once institutional and individual investors return to their desks to reengage with the market.\n\nLooking at the broader picture, the uptrend trajectory remains intact. The recent liquidations, although impactful, are unlikely to derail the general market direction. The crypto ecosystem is known for its resilience, and the current liquidation wave is just another test of this attribute."

These instruments are integral to the liquidity and price discovery of the crypto market.\n\nSolana's lead in this metric is particularly noteworthy, given that Ethereum has long been a dominant player in the field.\n\nFiring on all cylinders\n\nEven when comparing spot trading volume, Solana maintains its lead with a volume percentage of 8.43% against Ethereum's 4.62%.\n\nFurthermore, Solana's market capitalization has soared above the $50 billion mark, establishing it as a significant contender in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nAdding to Solana's impressive performance, it has recently surpassed Ethereum in 24-hour DEX (Decentralized Exchange) trading volume.\n\nThis marks yet another milestone for Solana, challenging Ethereum's stronghold in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.\n\nAnalysts attribute this surge to the increasing total value locked on Solana's platform, which has reached over $1.4 billion for the first time since last year's market turbulence.\n\nThe platform's competitive transaction fees and high-speed operations, coupled with a burgeoning ecosystem of meme coins and community interest, have contributed to its rally."

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nCryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors are beaming with excitement as renowned crypto analyst Lark Davis shares a bold prediction for Ethereum in 2024. In his latest YouTube video, Davis dives deep into the untapped potential of Ethereum, emphasizing that the path to riches in the Ethereum ecosystem is not as straightforward as one might think.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Price Trajectory: More Than Just Numbers\n\nWhile Davis acknowledges Ethereum\u2019s potential to reach between $10,000 to $15,000, marking substantial gains, he stresses that simply buying and holding Ethereum isn\u2019t the golden ticket to wealth. With Ethereum\u2019s price currently at $2,295, investors might see up to a 600% return, which is impressive, but Davis suggests there are even more lucrative opportunities to explore.\n\nThe real financial game-changers lie in Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 solutions \u2013 networks built on top of Ethereum to enhance its scalability and efficiency. He highlights that these Layer 2 platforms, such as StarkNet, ZK Sync, and others, are hotbeds for potential explosive growth, much greater than Ethereum\u2019s main asset itself.\n\nA New Era of Opportunities\n\nDavis points out that new token listings on these Layer 2 networks are critical areas to watch. He uses Celestia as an example, which saw a 500% increase in value within a month of its listing. For those seeking significant returns in a short period, paying attention to these new listings could be key.\n\nFurthermore, Davis emphasizes the potential of airdrops in the Layer 2 space. He shares insights on how to participate in these airdrops, like those from Manta Network and zkSync, by engaging in on-chain activities and staking. These airdrops could be lucrative, offering more immediate and potentially higher returns than traditional investments in ETH.\n\nAt press time, the largest altcoin was worth $2,295. Several experts are projecting a spike to $2,500 in the next five days before the year is over. Currently, Ethereum weekly and daily charts are both in the green, with the Fear and Greed index tilted on Greed, signifying the bulls\u2019 strength. Moreover, Ether is expected to be among the leaders of next year\u2019s anticipated bull run."

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nDisclaimer: This is not a validation of cryptocurrency or any particular provider, service, or product. It should not be taken as advice to engage in trading or use any services. Please check our terms and conditions .\n\nQuick Answer: There are over 7,000 cryptocurrencies, with Ethereum being the second most popular after Bitcoin. Unlike other cryptocurrencies which function mainly as a store of value or medium of exchange, Ethereum\u2019s blockchain allows for the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications. Transactions on the Ethereum network are confirmed by miners who prioritize transactions with higher gas fees. The number of confirmations for a transaction can vary depending on the crypto exchange used, with different exchanges requiring different numbers of confirmations. Coinbase, for example, requires 35 confirmations for Ethereum, which typically takes around ten minutes. Binance requires 12 confirmations, also processed in under ten minutes, while Kraken needs 20 confirmations, which can take about five minutes. The number of confirmations for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies also varies by exchange. Generally, Bitcoin transactions are considered final after at least three confirmations, which can take about 30 minutes depending on the network congestion and transaction volume. Overall, the confirmation time for Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies is influenced by the chosen exchange, the transaction fee (gas), and the current network load. Users should select platforms with high transaction throughput for faster confirmation times.\n\nOn the cryptocurrency market, there are over 7,000 digital currencies, such as Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Monero (XMR), Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Cardano (ADA), EOS, Zcash (ZEC), and many others.\n\nNext to Bitcoin, Ethereum is the second most popular digital currency. However, unlike Bitcoin and other altcoins, Ethereum has been designed as more than just a store of value or a medium of exchange.\n\nThe Ethereum network is a decentralized and open-source computing network and operating system used for creating smart contracts and decentralized applications. Now, the question: how many confirmations does ETH need? Generally, ETH confirmations depend on the crypto exchange you are using.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll explain to you how Ethereum works and how the confirmation is done. After we finish explaining this, we\u2019ll be able to give you the number of confirmations you need for Ethereum for the three most popular exchanges.\n\nHow Many Block Confirmations Ethereum\n\nSame as Bitcoin and other digital currencies, Ethereum works on a blockchain network basis. A blockchain is a distributed, decentralized public ledger on which all the cryptocurrency transactions are recorded and confirmed.\n\nThe term distributed means that anyone who participates in the Ethereum network has an equivalent copy of the public ledger, which allows the participants to have an insight into all previous transactions.\n\nThe Ethereum network is decentralized due to the fact that it\u2019s maintained and operated by all the holders of the distributed ledger and not by any centralized authority.\n\nMoreover, this network is secure because its participants use complex cryptography to verify and confirm the transactions. Ethereum is unique because its users can develop apps that run on the Ethereum blockchain, just like software runs on our computers. These applications allow users to deal with complex financial transactions or transfer and store personal data.\n\nHow Many Confirmations Does Ethereum Need\n\nEvery Ethereum transaction contains the wallet address of the receiver, the amount of Ethereum that will be transferred, the private key to authenticate the transaction, and the transaction fee that the sender will pay (called a gas fee).\n\nSimilar to how the Bitcoin network works, the Ethereum network also consists of miners or validators who confirm the transactions and select the one with the highest fee first.\n\nThis means that if the amount of gas is larger, the miners will put this transaction on the blockchain as a priority, and the confirmation time will be shorter. On the other hand, lower gas leads to more time for transaction confirmation. The number of transactions that are pending is available on Etherscan.\n\nOnce you send the transaction, the coins won\u2019t be added to the block right away. Instead, they\u2019ll be redirected to the transaction pool, a place where all unconfirmed transactions end up.\n\nThe Ethereum miners pick up a transaction from this pool, authenticate the particular transaction, and create a block. Afterwards, in order to add the new block to the blockchain, the miners have to solve complex math equations. When the miners resolve these math equations, the new block gets confirmed and attached to the blockchain.\n\nThe number of transactions that the miners can incorporate into the blockchain is limited due to the blockchain gas limit. Therefore, the Ethereum network can process limited blockchain transactions.\n\nAfter the miners attach a new block on the blockchain, they can collect their reward in cryptocurrency tokens. The tokens that are used on the Ethereum network are known as Ether. With these tokens, you can sell and buy goods and services.\n\nHow Many Confirmations for Ethereum\n\nThe number of Ethereum block confirmations appears to be undecided. The Ethereum white paper suggests that seven confirmations can be sufficient in order for one transaction to be confirmed, which should take about two minutes.\n\nHowever, Ethereum transactions are usually made through cryptocurrency exchanges, and the number of block confirmations that are needed depends on the cryptocurrency exchange that you are using.\n\nIn other words, each cryptocurrency exchange decides the number of Ethereum confirmations needed. This isn\u2019t the case only with Ethereum, it\u2019s the same for Bitcoin, Litecoin, ZEC, Monero, BCH, EOS, ADA, and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges and the number of confirmations they require.\n\nHow many confirmations does Coinbase need?\n\nCoinbase supports over 50 cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. For every one of these cryptocurrencies, Coinbase has a required number of confirmations:\n\nEthereum \u2013 Coinbase requires 35 confirmations, which takes around ten minutes;\n\nBitcoin \u2013 Coinbase requires 3 confirmations, completed in 30 minutes;\n\nLitecoin \u2013 12 confirmations in 30 minutes;\n\nEOS \u2013 It requires only one confirmation which takes only one minute.\n\nBinance ETH Confirmations\n\nBinance also supports over 50 cryptocurrencies, and it\u2019s well known for having some of the lowest transaction fees. Here are the number of confirmations that Binance requires:\n\nEthereum \u2013 Binance requires 12 network confirmations processed in under 10 minutes;\n\nBitcoin \u2013 It requires only one confirmation, which takes approximately 10 minutes.\n\nKraken how many confirmations?\n\nKraken is another reliable cryptocurrency exchange on the market. Same as Coinbase and Binance, Kraken supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Let\u2019s see what the numbers look like here:\n\nEthereum \u2013 Kraken needs 20 confirmations and manages to process them in five minutes;\n\nBitcoin \u2013 It needs 4 confirmations that take 40 minutes;\n\nLitecoin \u2013 It needs 12 confirmations, and it takes 30 minutes;\n\nEOS \u2013 It doesn\u2019t need any confirmation, meaning it\u2019s nearly instant.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow many confirmations does a Bitcoin transaction need?\n\nA Bitcoin transaction needs at least three confirmations before it can be considered final. The number of confirmations needed depends on the network congestion and the amount being transacted.\n\nHow long is 12 network confirmations?\n\nThe length of 12 network confirmations depends on the blockchain protocol used. For example, Bitcoin uses 10 minutes for each block confirmation, whereas Ethereum takes around 15 seconds per block.\n\nHow long is 35 network confirmations?\n\nThe average number of blocks needed for a transaction to be confirmed on the Bitcoin blockchain is currently around 10 minutes. This means that if you send 1 BTC from one wallet to another, it will take about 30 minutes before it appears in both wallets.\n\nA Few Words Before You Go\u2026\n\nOur team hopes that we\u2019ve managed to introduce you to the Ethereum cryptocurrency and how its decentralized network works.\n\nYou\u2019ve also learned that the number of Ethereum confirmations largely depends on the cryptocurrency exchange you\u2019re using, and even the gas fees can affect Ethereum confirmation time, which is why you should always opt for a platform with high transaction throughput like the ones suggested here.\n\nShare on: Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit\n\nAbout The Author"

        "title": "Worrying Pattern Signals Potential Dump in ETH: What to Expect? (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s recent surge in momentum encountered a significant obstacle upon reaching a pivotal resistance area, encompassing the upper boundary of a multi-month wedge and the static resistance at $2.4K.\n\nDespite this, the emergence of a head and shoulders pattern suggests an impending retracement towards the $2K support zone.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nEthereum witnessed a robust uptrend, achieving an annual peak of $2.4K, underscoring the prevailing influence of buyers in the market. This upward trajectory is further emphasized by a golden cross on the daily chart, signaling an overall bullish sentiment for Ethereum.\n\nHowever, the ascent was impeded upon encountering a critical resistance zone formed by the upper boundary of the multi-month wedge coinciding with the crucial static support at $2.4K. The resultant heightened selling pressure put a halt to the existing bullish momentum.\n\nDespite these challenges, a potential head and shoulders pattern, a widely recognized bearish reversal formation, has taken shape. The price is teetering on the brink of breaking below the pattern\u2019s neckline, represented by the orange line. Additionally, an extended bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator suggests the potential for downward movement in the coming days.\n\nConsidering recent price developments, a breach below the neckline of the pattern could pave the way for a short-term downward movement. The anticipated retracement would likely lead the price back toward the substantial support range at $2K.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nA closer inspection of the 4-hour chart reveals that amid recent sideways movement, the price found robust support within the critical range between the 0.5 ($2,211) and 0.618 ($2,166) levels of the Fibonacci retracement indicator. It acted as a barrier, preventing further downward attempts.\n\nNotably, this essential support range aligns with a dynamic, supportive trendline, adding additional strength against Ethereum sellers. Nevertheless, a scenario in which sellers gain control and push the price below these crucial support levels could trigger a notable cascade, prompting a retracement towards the $2K support region.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nIn the realm of on-chain data analysis, delving into the sentiment reflected in the futures market provides valuable insights into Ethereum\u2019s overall outlook. The accompanying chart depicts Ethereum\u2019s open interest metric. Traditionally, heightened values signify increased volatility and the potential for market reversals, whereas lower values indicate a more sustainable trend.\n\nThe chart underscores that bullish market movements often coincide with a gradual uptick in the Open Interest metric. However, reaching elevated levels or experiencing steep surges could signal the potential for a significant market reversal, often attributed to long/short squeeze events.\n\nThe open interest has been trending upward, albeit not yet reaching the values witnessed during the market\u2019s significant highs. Consequently, while corrections remain a plausible scenario, the futures market is yet to reach a point of overheating. The ongoing bullish trend is likely to endure in the long term, given the moderate levels of open interest. It becomes imperative to closely monitor this metric to discern any potential shifts in market sentiment."

        "content": "About 339,121 ETH coins have exited circulation since the Merge.\n\nThe number of active ETH validators jumped by 58% since the Shapella upgrade.\n\nEthereum [ETH] has witnessed two major events over the last 15 months \u2014 the Merge and the Shapella upgrade \u2014 that have fundamentally altered the way the network is run.\n\nHowever, the ETH fanbase would take a lot of heart from the fact that the impact of these events has been positive, even by conservative estimates.\n\nETH becomes deflationary\n\nAbout 339,121 ETH coins have exited circulation since the Merge, with the rate of deflation accelerating significantly in the last quarter of 2023, according to AMBCrypto\u2019s scrutiny of ultrasound money data.\n\nAs of this writing, ETH\u2019s total circulating supply was 120.18 million, the lowest since the network transitioned from the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nAs analyzed from the graph above, the net supply shrunk at an annual rate of 0.220%. Had the transition not taken place, ETH\u2019s total supply would have increased by more than 4.8 million, with an annual inflation rate of 3.168%.\n\nTypically, a bullish market with high network usage aids deflation and vice versa. This is because a part of the fee charged for validating transactions, called the base fee, is burned and removed from circulation.\n\nHence, the higher the network activity, the more the deflationary pressure on ETH.\n\nStaking gets a boost\n\nThe Shapella upgrade launched earlier in the year, which enabled staking withdrawals, also gave a fillip to ETH staking activity.\n\nAs per a report by staking service provider P2P.org, the number of active ETH validators jumped by 58%, equating to $23 billion of new ETH stake.\n\nHowever, the sharp increase has started to pose new problems for the network.\n\nIs there an overdose?\n\nThe staking rewards curve is designed to decrease the yield paid to validators in proportion to increases in the validator count. This is to restrict excess capital inflow and maintain a liquid supply of ETH for use in transactions.\n\nHowever, emerging DeFi avenues like liquid staking and restaking have increased the potential yield which can be earned by staking ETH. These have boosted capital inflows and the validator count on the network.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe growing validator set will degrade network performance at some point and may also make future essential updates more challenging to implement, P2P.org noted in the report.\n\nAs of this writing, ETH was holding strong at $2,285, with weekly gains of 5.14%, AMBCrypto spotted using CoinMarketCap\u2019s data."

Yakovenko's stance indicates a broader view of what defines a layer-2 solution, challenging traditional boundaries and proposing a more fluid and interconnected blockchain ecosystem.\n\nSolana's market resurgence\n\nAs reported by U.Today, Solana has recently marked a significant achievement by surpassing Ethereum in a key trading metric: perpetual futures trading volume.\n\nSolana's lead in both perpetual futures and spot trading volumes, coupled with a soaring market capitalization, positions it as a formidable competitor in the crypto space, even challenging Ethereum's dominance in the Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and decentralized finance (DeFi) sectors.\n\nThe interest in the Solana ecosystem mostly stems from the meme coin frenzy that was fueled by the rise of the Bonk (BONK) token."

This wave of institutional interest is reshaping the narrative around Ethereum, as industry insiders anticipate a surge in bullish momentum\n\nETH/BTC Poised for Growth\n\nPentoshi\u2019s optimism resonates with other crypto strategists, such as Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, who foresees a promising year for Ethereum.

Below the current price action, the 20-Day Exponential Moving Average and the $2,100 level jointly provide robust support. Furthermore, the decreasing interest rates in the United States are rendering riskier assets like cryptocurrencies increasingly appealing. As a result, traders are inclined to seize value opportunities whenever they materialize.\n\nETH and BTC Intertwined\n\nConsidering the overarching landscape, it is apparent that Ethereum's fortunes are closely intertwined with those of Bitcoin, the dominant player in the crypto realm. As Bitcoin experiences an upward surge, Ethereum tends to follow suit, as we have seen multiple times in the past. However, it is essential to remain vigilant regarding the trajectory of interest rates, as a sudden rise could pose a substantial headwind to the Ethereum market.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, the prevailing scenario suggests a continued upward pressure on Ethereum. The overarching sentiment appears bullish, with Bitcoin leading the way. Nonetheless, it is prudent to acknowledge that liquidity may become somewhat constrained in the coming days as market participants shift their focus from trading to the festivities of the holiday season.\n\nWhat sets Ethereum apart during this period is its active trading during the Christmas and New Year's Day sessions, in contrast to many traditional financial markets that observe closures. This distinction affords Ethereum traders unique opportunities to navigate the market dynamics during these holidays.\n\nIn the end, Ethereum's recent rally and its proximity to a significant resistance level underscore the cryptocurrency's potential for further gains. While potential obstacles exist, the prevailing narrative points toward continued upward momentum, driven by the interplay of market dynamics and interest rates. As the holiday season approaches, Ethereum's active trading status sets it apart in the crypto world, offering opportunities for traders even amidst the holiday festivities.\n\nReady to trade ETH/USD?

        "title": "Why Ethereum is seeing waning bullish sentiment - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum saw a drop in the Estimated Leverage Ratio.\n\nIn combination with other metrics, the inference was that bullish certainty was falling.\n\nIn a report last week, AMBCrypto highlighted that Ethereum [ETH] has underperformed Bitcoin [BTC] in recent weeks.\n\nComparing their performance in December, AMBCrypto found that ETH has gained 11.3% at press time, while BTC has gained 14.8%.\n\nThis meant that market participants had a valid reason to question their short-term ETH holdings. Evidence for this was present in the form of a dropping Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR), AMBCrypto found.\n\nThis metric warranted a closer look and could reveal what the market expects for Ethereum over the next month.\n\nThe ELR has trended lower for a while now\n\nAs the name suggests, the ELR is an estimation that divides the exchange\u2019s Open Interest with the exchange\u2019s coin reserve to approximate the average leverage employed by users.\n\nThis metric generally trends higher during bullish market conditions, when market participants are encouraged to assume more risk in search of gains during a trending market.\n\nThe ELR chart from CryptoQuant showed that the metric has trended higher since the first week of September. Around that time, ETH dipped to $1531 but bounced higher and began to rally.\n\nOn the 8th of December, the 14-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the ELR began to drop. At press time, this dip was still in progress. This meant that users were less willing to assume risk.\n\nThey might also be pivoting to long-term holding strategies.\n\nTo better understand what is happening, AMBCrypto looked at other metrics. One of them was the Ethereum Exchange Inflow. A rising ELR alongside a rise in the inflows would be a strong signal that participants were bearish on ETH.\n\nOn the 11th and the 18th of December, the inflow metric saw a spike in the readings. This represented a large amount of ETH entering exchanges. Looking at the 14-day SMA, we can see that it has trended upward.\n\nCombined with the depressed ELR, it is a sign that selling pressure has been on the rise over the past two weeks.\n\nWhat is the market sentiment like?\n\nThe Open Interest is a good gauge of market sentiment. Trending prices and a rising OI are strong signals that market participants have expectations of further gains and are positioned long in the market.\n\nAs we can see, the OI has also trended higher from mid-September. In particular, the uptrend in prices and OI in October and early December came alongside rising prices, signaling a firm bullish conviction.\n\nHowever, after the 9th of December, we see the 14-day SMA of Ethereum\u2019s OI slide lower. Despite the OI spike on the 22nd of December, the trend appeared to be pointed lower.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nFrom a technical perspective, ETH bulls faced a massive challenge when attempting to convert the $2300-$2370 area to a support zone.\n\nThe inference from the metrics was that Ethereum\u2019s bullish momentum was likely slowing down. The belief in ETH has eroded over the past ten days. It remains to be seen whether ETH bears can force prices to fall below the $2132 support level."

The catalyst behind this optimistic forecast is the expected approval of spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the coming year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this year, major players in the asset management arena, including Ark Invest and 21Shares, submitted applications for spot-based Ethereum ETFs to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). If approved, these ETFs could pave the way for increased institutional participation and capital inflow into the Ethereum market.\n\nETF approval boost\n\nIn a tweet, Pentoshi stated that they had been expressing bullish sentiment about the Bitcoin ETF when its price ranged between $25,000 and $28,000.

Pentoshi pointed out that figures of $2,7xx and $3,400 were potential scenarios for Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nAs of the latest market data, the current price of Ethereum stands at $2,281, representing a marginal decline of 0.37% over the past 24 hours. The market now awaits regulatory decisions regarding Ethereum ETFs, with potential approval seen as a crucial factor in determining the short-to-medium-term trajectory of ETH prices.\n\nWhile market analysts and enthusiasts closely monitor developments in the ETF approval process, the crypto community remains divided on the potential impact of such regulatory decisions. Some believe that ETF approval will act as a strong catalyst for Ethereum's price, opening new avenues for institutional investment. Others caution that market reactions may be unpredictable, emphasizing the need for careful analysis and risk management."

Going to buy it and then throw it in my cold wallet and let this get me rich in 2024.\u201d\n\nAltcoin Sherpa pointed out the approachability and affordability of the Solana chain for novel users, especially those transacting with smaller sums, \u201cWhat furthered my thesis even more on SOL was watching retail people who were getting into crypto for the first time interact on- chain. ETH was impossible, even other stuff was pretty expensive at times.

        "content": "As Ethereum Classic (ETC) has been gearing up for a \u2018Spiral\u2019 upgrade, Monero(XMR) is preparing for \u2018Monero Meet Up 2023.\u2019 However, with its amazing presale run, Borroe Finance ($ROE) looks like a bright prospect for financial success. Which is the top crypto to buy now\u2013ETC, XMR, or $ROE? Let\u2019s explore more.\n\n>>BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum Classic Announces Spiral Upgrade Amid Price Fall\n\nOn December 5, Ethereum Classic announced that the ETC network is gearing up for a \u2018Spiral\u2019 Upgrade, which is set to be activated at block 19,250,000. This upgrade will align the Ethereum Classic chain with the Ethereum mainnet, ensuring EVM compatibility.\n\nFollowing the announcement by Ethereum Classic, ETC experienced a notable surge in price, climbing from $19.55 to $22.85 on December 9. Despite this uptick, Ethereum Classic\u2019s positive momentum was short-lived. Then ETC again retraced to $20.02, representing a 2.40% increase on December 19 since the announcement.\n\nAs ETC faced rejection at the $23.50 resistance level, Ethereum Classic faced a downturn. Also, the technical indicator of Ethereum Classic, like MACD, displays a rising red histogram, prompting stronger selling pressure in ETC. This led to a mixed pattern where ETC\u2019s bulls lost confidence, and bearish influence started to take over Ethereum Classic.\n\nMany crypto analysts speculate that this upgrade will fuel the return of the Ethereum Classic. If bulls gain momentum, ETC might surge up to $22.50 by the end of 2023. Thus, many investors consider it the best crypto investment for the short term.\n\nCape Town to Host Exclusive Monero Event\n\nOn December 13, Monero revealed on X about their upcoming \u201cMonero Meet Up 2023\u201d, which is to be held in Cape Town on December 22. Monero invites all their developers, users, enthusiasts, and anyone else interested in XMR.\n\nBesides that, Monero has been performing well in December. With a bullish outlook on Monero\u2019s network, XMR has become one of the best coins to invest in as its bearish trend reverses. Since the start of the month, the XMR price has been consolidated between $165 and $180.\n\nOn December 19, XMR was trading around $170, marking a 0.57% increase in the past seven days. However, Monero\u2019s technical analysis reveals that XMR will have a strong bearish influence in the upcoming market. The MACD on the Monero chart shows a red histogram, suggesting a bearish trend streak for XMR.\n\nYet, crypto analysts say if the bulls gain power back and hold above $170, then XMR is likely to surge over $185. But, if XMR fails, the altcoin price is likely to drop to $155. Crypto analysts suggest caution before taking a position in XMR.\n\nBorroe Finance Presale Catches Investors\u2019 Eyes\n\nBorroe Finance, one of the new DeFi projects, is an AI-powered funding marketplace. Interestingly, Borroe Finance has already raised over $2 million, selling more than 177 million $ROE tokens.\n\nBorroe Finance\u2019s unique value proposition has made $ROE one of the most demanding tokens.

        "title": "Ethereum vs. Bitcoin: Technical Analysis Predicts Potential ETH Rise - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "Technical analysis suggests possible upside for Ethereum versus Bitcoin, with rising wedge patterns indicating an imminent rebound.\n\nEthereum could experience a significant rise against Bitcoin, marking a potential shift in crypto market dynamics.\n\nThe current dynamics between Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) in the cryptocurrency market suggest a potential turnaround for Ethereum. According to recent technical analysis, Ethereum could be setting up for significant appreciation against Bitcoin. This analysis provides a detailed perspective on the possible price trends of Ethereum versus Bitcoin and their implications for cryptocurrency investors.\n\nEthereum Versus Bitcoin: Favorable Technical Indicators\n\nBased on the rising wedge pattern developing on the daily chart of Ether versus Bitcoin, there is an increasing likelihood of a breakout move before the New Year. This classic bullish reversal pattern , characterized by the formation of lower highs and higher lows with two converging trendlines, would resolve with a breakout above the upper trendline and a rise to a level equal to the maximum distance between the upper and lower trendlines.\n\nETH/BTC Near a Falling Wedge Breakout\n\nThe ETH/BTC pair is currently trading within a similar descending wedge pattern, looking to break its upper trend line. Depending on the breakout point, the pair could rise towards the 0.056-0.059 BTC area by the New Year, which would represent a 6-13% increase from current price levels.\n\nLonger-term charts suggest the possibility of a rebound by the New Year and during the first quarter of 2024. For example, Ether\u2019s price is forming lower highs while its relative strength index (RSI) is making higher lows on the weekly chart, indicating a bullish divergence. This discrepancy suggests that bearish momentum is weakening and a reversal to the upside could be imminent.\n\nIn addition, price is also near a confluence of support comprising a multi-year uptrend line and the 0.048-0.052 BTC area. This confluence limits the bearish outlook for the ETH/BTC pair in the coming weeks, allowing for a bounce towards the 200-week EMA (the blue wave) near 0.057 BTC by the New Year, which is also the aforementioned target of the descendingwedge.\n\nPossible Alternative Scenarios\n\nHowever, veteran trader Peter Brandt disagrees and argues that the mentioned descending wedge pattern could be a descending triangle, a bearish indicator. In this regard, Brandt suggests that a break below the lower trend line of the descending wedge could take the ETH/BTC pair towards 0.044 BTC, which would be an 8.5% drop from current price levels.\n\nImplications for Cryptocurrency Investors\n\nThis divergence of opinion among analysts highlights the speculative and highly volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market. Investors should carefully consider these analyses and be prepared for the possibility of price fluctuations. While some indicators suggest upside potential for Ethereum versus Bitcoin, others warn of the possibility of continued bearish performance.\n\nAnalysis of the ETH/BTC ratio offers valuable insight into current trends in the cryptocurrency market. As Ethereum and Bitcoin continue to be leaders in the crypto space, their price dynamics are crucial to understanding the overall direction of the market. With multiple factors at play, investors must remain informed and adapt their investment strategies to navigate this ever-evolving market.\n\n."

        "title": "Are Bitcoin And Ethereum Heading For A Santa Claus Rally? - Blockzeit",
        "content": "It\u2019s that time of the year again when everyone is in a festive mood. One of the anticipated events this week is the so-called \u201cSanta Claus Rally.\u201d So, will we see major gains in Bitcoin (BTC) and/or Ethereum (ETH) this season?\n\nSanta Claus Rally in a Nutshell\n\nPreviously, we discussed what the Santa Claus Rally is all about. In a nutshell, it\u2019s a phenomenon in stock investments happening within \u201cthe final five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the following year.\u201d Since 1950 to 2023, the market has shown gains at an 80% probability.\n\nNow, there\u2019s an ongoing narrative that cryptocurrencies may exhibit surges these holidays. With that, let\u2019s take a look at the background and possibilities of a Christmas rally in Bitcoin and Ethereum on our way to 2024.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Santa Claus Rally\n\nBitcoin does not appear to play ball during the Santa Claus Rally. Since cryptocurrencies trade 24/7 compared to stocks which are only limited by the operating schedules of the stock market, Techopedia compiled the performance of BTC starting from December 25th to January 2nd.\n\nSource: Techopedia\n\nBased on the illustration above, BTC only indicated significant gains on a scale of four out of ten or 40% of the time. The most increase it got during these periods was in the days leading to 2021 when it soared 35.9%. The worst was in the run to the following year when it shed 6.9% of its value.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Santa Claus Rally\n\nUsing the same formula, the source examined how Ethereum moved throughout the event from its launch in the Christmas of 2015 to the New Year of 2023.\n\nSource: Techopedia\n\nFrom the looks of it, ETH has outclassed BTC in most instances. In an eight-year frame, the crypto pumped five times, translating to a 62.5% chance of benefitting from the Christmas rally. Even if we narrow Bitcoin\u2019s stats from 2015 to the last occurrence, it\u2019s still three out of eight times on the charts or a mere 37.5%.\n\nThe best return for ETH during the rallies was 29.6% in 2017 while its worst was a dip of 5.4% in 2021. It should be noted, however, that Ethereum appeared to track the movements of Bitcoin from 2019 onwards.\n\nWill BTC and ETH Pump?\n\nAs displayed by the charts, Ethereum has better chances of outpacing Bitcoin during the Santa Claus Rally. But then again, if the two key narratives of BTC are placed in the equation being the anticipated mass approval of its spot exchange traded funds (ETFs) and halving all happening in the coming year, the premier crypto in terms of market cap could blow the roof.\n\nIf not during the Xmas season, the massive gains of Bitcoin might happen on the way to January 10 when the US Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to give all the applications a go. Meanwhile, Ether will most likely follow its crypto comrade in the coming bull run."
