        "title": "1 Reason Ethereum Could Lead the Next Bull Market - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "For many years, Bitcoin has been touted as a premier store of value and has even drawn comparisons to gold due to its inherent scarcity and low inflation rate. But another cryptocurrency might be poised to beat Bitcoin at its own game: Ethereum (ETH 0.39%).\n\nIn August 2021, Ethereum developers implemented the London hard fork, an upgrade to the blockchain that added a few new perks to the way the Ethereum network functions. The most meaningful change to come out of this was a new feature that would make Ethereum deflationary.\n\nA crucial upgrade for price increases\n\nUntil the London hard fork, there was no limit to the amount of Ethereum that would enter circulation. And while that still technically is the case, the newly introduced deflationary mechanism will ensure that the rate at which new Ethereum enters circulation is reduced. And rather than only slowing the rate of newly minted coins, developers took it a step further and made it so that the total supply of Ether can actually be reduced.\n\nIt's a complicated process, but essentially, what has happened is that after the switch to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, the fee that previously would have gone to miners is now burned. The size of the fee varies depending on network demand, referred to as gas. Theoretically, the dynamics of the London hard fork make it so that as demand picks up, more Ether is burned.\n\nAs demand increases and more Ether is burned, Ethereum's price will probably climb. At this stage, Ethereum users are more likely to hold and not spend, while investors will look to reap the rewards of price increases. This will lead to fewer transactions and, therefore, less Ether getting burned, thereby increasing supply and perhaps lowering its price.\n\nAs the price comes down, users will have less of an incentive to hold and more pressure to spend. But as more spending occurs, more Ether will be burned, and the cycle between supply and demand and inflation and deflation will unfold once again.\n\nEthereum in the post-Merge world\n\nWe have yet to experience a full iteration of this cycle, but we are in the beginning stages of one. Since the Merge, the number of Ether tokens in circulation has remained nearly stagnant, hovering around 120 million. Before the switch to proof of stake and introducing burning, Ethereum's inflation rate was at about 4.5%, but since the Merge, it has moved to -0.009%. For comparison, Bitcoin's current inflation rate is about 1.7%.\n\nIf Ethereum still utilized proof of work and hadn't introduced the burn mechanism, there would have been an additional 1.5 million tokens in circulation just since the Merge in September 2022. But since implementation, the total supply of Ether has actually dropped by about 4,000.\n\nAn opportunity awaits\n\nDue to the recency of the Merge, we probably still haven't seen the true effects of this phenomenon, but when that day comes, it could bring some serious returns for investors. Despite its price being down more than 60% from its all-time high, Ethereum still is one of the most widely used blockchains in the world. As activity on the network picks up -- which it seems to be doing as of late -- demand should follow and add further deflationary pressure.\n\nOver the coming years and even decades, Ethereum might become subject to the whims of limited supply and increased demand, a phenomenon similar to the one that made Bitcoin the most valuable cryptocurrency today and spurred people to view it as a supreme store of value.\n\nCould Ethereum take over Bitcoin's role? Perhaps. But whether it does isn't too important right now. Instead, investors should use this time as an opportunity to grab some Ethereum while its price is still struggling and enjoy the benefit of its new deflationary feature for the long haul."

        "content": "Russia\u2019s largest bank, Sberbank, is moving forward with the plan to launch its decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, preparing to trial the product in a few months.\n\nSberbank expects to launch open trials of its DeFi platform by May 2023, Sber\u2019s Blockchain Lab product director Konstantin Klimenko announced, the local news agency Interfax reported on Feb. 3.\n\nCurrently being tested in private beta, Sberbank\u2019s upcoming DeFi platform will be fully open by the end of April, enabling users to conduct the first commercial transactions, Klimenko said.\n\nThe executive noted that the blockchain platform will be compatible with the Ethereum blockchain, allowing customers to use major wallets, such as MetaMask, to move their assets. Klimenko also noted that users will be able to transfer their assets from other platforms.\n\nThe blockchain executive stated that Sberbank\u2019s DeFi platform aims to become a prime DeFi ecosystem in Russia. He also expressed confidence that DeFi systems are able to displace the traditional market of banking services.\n\nThe announcement comes in line with Sberbank\u2019s previously disclosed plans to enable DeFi applications on the bank\u2019s infrastructure. In November 2022, Sberbank announced a set of new features for its proprietary blockchain platform, including compatibility with smart contracts and applications on the Ethereum network.\n\nIt appears to be unclear how the upcoming platform is going to be regulated because Russia is yet to come up with digital currency regulation. According to Anatoly Aksakov, the head of the Duma\u2019s Committee on Financial Market, Russia will \u201cdefinitely\u201d adopt crypto regulations in 2023.\n\nRelated: Iran and Russia want to issue new stablecoin backed by gold\n\nAs previously reported, Sberbank was struggling to launch some blockchain tools over the past few years due to multiple delays of registration by the Russian central bank. Originally expecting to launch its digital asset issuance platform in 2021, Sberbank eventually received the Bank of Russia\u2019s approval in spring 2022. The Russian government is the majority shareholder in Sberbank, holding 50% + 1 share.\n\nOn Feb. 2, Alfa Bank, one of the largest private banks in Russia, became the fourth financial institution in the country allowed to issue digital assets alongside Sberbank, the state-backed tokenization platform Atomyze and fintech company Lighthouse."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price went up by over 40% since January.\n\nNetwork growth, however, declined.\n\nWith a price increase of over 40%, Ethereum [ETH] had a successful January. Although short-term investors can consider this a success, would it be advantageous to hold the asset for the foreseeable future?\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nETH sees a three-day straight increase\n\nA glance at Ethereum on a daily timeline revealed that its surge began at the beginning of 2023. It was up about 1.7% as of this writing, and was trading at about $1,670. The asset would record a third straight gain in three trading periods thanks to the price increase.\n\nAdditionally, a review of the daily timeframe of the Relative Strength Indicator revealed that ETH was in a bull trend. The RSI line was at 65 and displayed a reasonably strong bull trend. However, how favorable is this trend for traders looking to go long?\n\nDeducing ETH\u2019s strength through Aroon\n\nThe daily chart of Ethereum\u2019s Aroon Indicator showed that bullish sentiment had deteriorated dramatically over the previous few weeks. However, as of the time of writing, the Aroon Up line had pumped to 100%, and the Aroon Down line was visible at 42.8%.\n\nThe rise of the Aroon Up line coincided with the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announcement.\n\nThe Aroon indicator can be used to determine whether an asset is trending or trading sideways. Additionally, it detects when a trend has begun and ended. The indicator\u2019s rise on the ETH chart suggests that the current uptrend is robust, which could be excellent news for long-term buyers.\n\nNetwork growth declines\n\nWhile the indicator mentioned above provided some good news for investors, this other metric suggested that they should proceed cautiously.\n\nAn examination of the network expansion statistic revealed a severe decline. Network growth dropped to roughly 25.9 from its previous steady state of 65. As a gauge of a cryptocurrency\u2019s health and growth prospects, this metric assesses how widely it is being utilized.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nAn increasing network growth indicator may suggest that a cryptocurrency is growing in popularity and adoption, while a decreasing indicator may indicate the opposite.\n\nGiven the convergence of these two important signals, this level may be a favorable chance for investors seeking to go long on Ethereum. They should exercise caution, though, because a dip in price is probable. However, a rally is imminent in the longer term."

        "title": "Ethereum Burning Reaches New High, Is ETH Warming Up For Another Rally? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "While the global cryptocurrency market continues with its ubiquitous movement, Ethereum seems to be sneaking out to break a new record. The latest achievement Ethereum obtained is setting a new high in its burning-per-day mechanism.\n\nPer a recent report from WuBlockchain citing data from oklink, Ethereum\u2019s burning amount exceeded 3,000 ETH at a figure of 3,040 ETH on February 2. This new record sets the crypto asset burning rate highest point ever seen since November 10, 2022. According to the reporter, the primary source where the burning was aggressive was two popular decentralized exchanges, Uniswap and OpenSea.\n\nOver the past months, both platforms have recorded significant usage and trading volumes which correlate with the increased burning of ETH tokens. Data from CoinGecko shows Uniswap trading volume has moved from $558 million seen at the beginning of this year to $1.1 billion as of February 3, up by more than 50% over the last 25 days.\n\nIs ETH Warming Up For Another Rally\n\nWith an upcoming catalyst like the Shanghai upgrade coming soon to the Ethereum network, ETH could be in a warm-up stage before another rally. Following the demand for ETH surging, the crypto asset greed index has also made some significant movements in the past weeks ranging above 60 in recent days.\n\nThe increase in the greed index signifies a massive level of FOMO and anticipation amongst ETH investors waiting for the right moment to buy and result in another rally. Data aside, so far, the Ethereum price chart has only indicated two possible scenarios, which are to either retrace a little bit more or proceed with another bullish trend.\n\nLooking at the 1-day time frame of the ETH/USDT price chart, we can see ETH recently tapped into external liquidity \u2014 a move that signifies a possible retracement to take out the liquidity of the buyers below. A retracement confirmation could mean ETH returns to the $1,300-$1,350 region.\n\nMeanwhile, should ETH invalidate the possible retracement and tap into the $1,684 zone declining a retrace, we could see another upward rally as the crypto asset appears to be consolidating at the moment, waiting for a significant movement (expansion) either to the upside or downside.\n\nEthereum Continues Recording New Highs\n\nNotably, the burning rate hasn\u2019t been the only new high Ethereum recurred in the past weeks. Last month, NewsBTC reported the total staked ETH on the Beacon chain reached an all-time high of over 16.16 million ETH. The figure cumulates to more than 13.28% of the total Ether supply and represents $26.13 billion at current prices\n\nOut of the 16 million ETH staked, about 11.408 million ETH have been staked via staking services providers such as Lido, Coinbase, and Kraken, among others \u2013 representing 70.86% of the total staked on the Beacon chain. Lido dominates ETH staking with 29.3%, Coinbase controls 12.8%, while Kraken holds 7.6%, and Binance controls 6.3% of the total stake, according to Glassnode on-chain data.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum total validators recently surpassed the 500,000 benchmarks and currently sit at 512,432 as of February 3, according to data from BeaconScan.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

It will allow ETH stakers to withdraw their cryptocurrency currently locked in the ETH 2.0 smart contract. But the question is, will unlocking this amount cause immense selling pressure?\n\nA dress rehearsal (Zhejiang testnet) for the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade is about to begin. It serves to replace the Shandong testnet because when the latter was launched, it included several EIPs that will not be rolled out with the upgrade.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAccording to Paritosh, Developer at the Ethereum Foundation, the Zhejiang testnet is a great opportunity for all tools to test out how they want to collect, display and use the withdrawal information. Making the experience smooth for users is one of our highest priorities now!\n\nHow Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Will Impact ETH\u2019s Price?\n\nAt the time of writing, the current price of Ethereum is $1,667.61 with a one-day trading volume of $9,876,481,170. ETH has risen by nearly 5.51% during the past 24 hours. The coin strongly holds the second position on CMC, with a live market cap of $204,071,388,357.\n\nOn the bearish side of things, the cryptocurrency market is still at the edge of a bullish-bearish trend. There are many reasons for it like many investors are not over with Terra Luna and FTX contagion. Also, macroeconomic factors are bearish that might pressure original Ethereum stakers to sell their staked ETH.\n\nIn conclusion, Shanghai Network Upgrade can lead Ethereum toward a massive surge, or investors can witness the price dump.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nNouns, the Ethereum NFT-based project building open-source IP, has already put its vibrant characters into a Super Bowl commercial, the annual Rose Parade, and elsewhere around the physical and digital worlds. Now they\u2019re headed to bookstores and comic shops.\n\nTitan Comics, which specializes in licensed comic books tied to IP like \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d is bringing Nouns to physical comic books starting in April with a six-issue run of \u201cNouns: Nountown.\u201d It\u2019s written by Titan Senior Editor David Leach and illustrated by Danny Schlitz, with an eventual graphic novel to be published by Penguin Random House.\n\nAs with many other Nouns-related projects, the comics project was backed by the DAO\u2014or decentralized autonomous organization, a type of tokenized online group\u2014made up of Nouns NFT holders, who control a sizable treasury to fund IP development and other projects. Currently, Nouns DAO oversees about $46 million worth of ETH.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSample artwork from the first issue of \"Nouns: Nountown.\" Image: Titan Comics\n\nIn this case, the comic project was proposed by industry veteran Adam Fortier through his Comics DAO organization, in collaboration with Nouns-centric collective SharkDAO, and received $210,000 worth of ETH through a unanimous vote in August. It\u2019s one of the latest efforts to propagate the Nouns IP through a mass-market channel.\n\n\u201cA lot of the people who read it might not even know that there were NFTs backing it, but at the end of the day, it was the NFTs that created the on-chain incentives to get this thing produced,\u201d pseudonymous Nouns co-founder 4156 told Decrypt. \u201cBut the end user doesn't ever have to know that.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t a simple licensing play for Nouns DAO. First, Nouns itself falls under a Creative Commons 0 (CC0) license, meaning all of its assets are freely available for anyone to use and commercialize. Theoretically, anyone could make a Nouns comic book, but Titan Comics has established distribution channels with retailers.\n\nFurthermore, \u201cNouns: Nountown\u201d will be released in tandem with Ethereum NFTs that provide access to digital issues while also representing ownership in copies of the printed comics, including a chance to receive a couple of different types of limited-edition versions.\n\nThe project has two different NFT rarity levels: the mosaic NFT at 0.069 ETH (about $115) and generative NFT at 0.3 ETH (nearly $500), with the latter comic covers featuring a randomized mix of Nouns from the collection.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn each case, Titan Comics will pull the first 420 comics from the press (and film the process for proof) and then hold them in a secure vault by 4K, a startup that specializes in NFTs backed by physical items. There will also be a limited supply of issues for each NFT presale in which each issue owner can ask the artist to draw whatever Nouns characters they request.\n\nA CC0 experiment\n\nNouns has a distinctive vibe in the NFT space, with the platform auctioning off one colorful pixel character each day. Each has a version of the brand\u2019s familiar Nouns glasses (or \u201cNoggles\u201d), but otherwise uses a mix of amusing traits\u2014including heads based on a wide array of inspirations, including a pineapple, skateboard, igloo, flamingo, and plenty more.\n\nGiven that mishmash of avatars, what is the Nouns comic book about, anyway?\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s] a deeply moving coming-of-age drama about a small-town thimble salesman caught up in a politically-charged espionage caper involving a stolen atom bomb, a signed picture of the Pope, and a man with a fox head,\u201d the official synopsis reads.\n\nCover artwork for the first issue of \"Nouns: Nountown.\" Image: Titan Comics\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s absurd and chaotic. Fortier told Decrypt that there are some adult elements in the mix, such as an evil character that\u2019s grinding up Nouns characters to create an alternative to Beyond Meat. He described it as \u201cunconstrained anarchy with good intent,\u201d and that the tone is \u201cso over-the-top\u201d and \u201cso \u2018Looney Tunes\u2019\u201d in nature.\n\n\u201cSomebody who read the first issue described it as \u2018exhausting,\u2019\u201d he joked, likening the challenge of spotlighting so many Nouns characters to the process of herding cats.\n\nDeveloping a comic book around already-minted NFTs in an open-source property also means that the creative team is building around characters that other people own the original NFT of, and may feel an attachment to. Their interpretation of such characters has already led to some \u201cangry emails\u201d from Nouns owners, Fortier admitted.\n\n\u201cWe kind of put the writer and artist in a room and said, \u2018Don't go on Twitter. Don't engage [with] people,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cOnce people start advocating for their character to appear in a certain way, or act in a certain way, it can harm the creative process.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting experiment and test case for the CC0 model. And not only are the comics based on open-source characters, but the team will also release the art files to the community so that creators can develop whatever derivative works they please.\n\nIt\u2019s open-source all the way around, in other words, but also packaged in a way that can reach a broad audience. In Fortier\u2019s view, that provides an opportunity to entice people with a tale\u2014and then potentially clue them into the crypto elements that helped bring the adventure to life.\n\n\u201cWhen you say the term \u2018Web3\u2019 or \u2018crypto\u2019 to people, often their eyes glaze over. And you have a sense of fear or a sense of confusion,\u201d he said of the challenges of onboarding the masses. \u201cJust telling a fun story is like sneaking them in the back door.\u201d"

        "title": "How to Choose the Best Ethereum Trading Bot? - Crypto Times",
        "content": "When it comes to trading with cryptocurrencies, it\u2019s important to choose a trading platform that suits your needs. While some platforms are designed for more advanced traders, others are user-friendly and can help beginners make the most of their investments. The year 2022 has brought the crypto market to a halt and is now paving the way for a bull run in 2023.\n\nCrypto predictions for 2023 suggest that the prices of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum, will pick up by Q3 as the market has bottomed out and has a tendency to rebound. It becomes important to prepare your portfolio for upcoming bullish trends. Therefore, this article will help you choose the best Ethereum trading bot, which you can also consider when selecting a bot to trade any cryptocurrency.\n\nBefore we get into how to choose the best Ethereum trading bot, let\u2019s understand what a crypto trading bot is.\n\nWhat is a Crypto Trading Bot?\n\nA crypto trading bot is automated software with special algorithms that analyze the data of crypto exchanges and offers additional tools to make it simpler for you to execute trades. Simply put, crypto trading bots automatically execute orders based on your trading strategy without manual intervention.\n\nAs such, automated trading saves time as you don\u2019t need to gawk at your screen 24/7, and crypto bots in a way give you an edge over manual traders. You can also check out these top 10 crypto trading bots for 2023 to step up your trading game. Moving on, let\u2019s learn what factors you should tick off to choose the best Ethereum trading bot to maximize your returns.\n\nFeatures to Consider when choosing an Ethereum trading bot\n\nWhen choosing an Ethereum trading bot, it\u2019s important to look for options that can handle a variety of markets. Traders should be able to find a bot that can trade across several Ethereum exchanges, including Huobi, Binance, Kraken, and HitBTC. And since Ethereum is a volatile currency, you may want to pick a trading bot that uses Trailing Stop orders. These orders ride strong market moves and capture more upside than a simple holding.\n\nWell, there are several factors for choosing an Ethereum trading bot, and here we will discuss specific parameters that you must consider before signing up for any crypto bot.\n\nBefore choosing an Ethereum trading bot, you must check the parameters it is offering for technical indicators and market information.\n\nTrading bot should have a user-friendly interface.\n\nBacktesting is essential for traders. Using historical data, you can create a trading strategy that works well. If you have an established trading strategy, you can then use bots to automate the process. Bots are better than humans at detecting opportunities, placing orders, and executing trades in a timely manner. Moreover, they allow you to analyze more than one cryptocurrency.\n\nThe trading bot should be reputed and to check authenticity, you must see how many years the platform has been on the market and what are the reviews of users.\n\nBefore using a trading bot, pay attention if the bot is compatible with well-known crypto exchanges. This is important to check the authenticity of the platform.\n\nConclusion:\n\nTrading bots are not meant to be money-making machines. They are designed to save you time and stress. There are various types of bots to choose from. Some bots are cloud-based, while others are server-based. It is important to test a trading bot before signing up. You can get an idea of how the bot will work by using a demo account.\n\nA trading bot can be useful when you don\u2019t have the time or energy to analyze the market yourself. The best ones are easy to set up, run, and monitor. Once you have a good bot, you can start putting your crypto portfolio to work."

        "title": "Ethereum's 2023 Bull Run: Why the Best Is Yet to Come - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Through the first 30 days of the year, Ethereum (ETH 0.34%) is up a surprising 37.53%, and now trades close to $1,700. Heading into the year, though, many traders expected Ethereum to consolidate its gains after The Merge and trade sideways in early 2023. Some even thought Ethereum might drop below $1,000. As a result, many investors are now asking: Is Ethereum's 2023 bull run sustainable?\n\nThe answer to that question can be found using one single metric: total value locked (TVL). This metric is useful as a shorthand way of tracking how much activity is happening on a blockchain. Generally speaking, the higher the number, the better it is for a blockchain. Let's take a deep dive into this metric and see what it tells us about Ethereum's future prospects.\n\nWhat is TVL and why should I care?\n\nTotal value locked, as might be guessed by its name, refers to how much of a cryptocurrency is \"locked\" on a blockchain. There are various ways of \"locking\" your cryptocurrency, such as by choosing to participate in a crypto staking program. With staking, you agree to \"lock up\" your crypto to earn rewards for a certain amount of time, during which you can not trade it. Thus, blockchains that have successful staking programs also typically rank very high when it comes to total value locked.\n\nFrom a long-term investment perspective, you can think of TVL as a way of measuring trust in the future potential of a particular blockchain. At the very least, you need to trust that the blockchain is going to return your crypto funds after the \"lock up\" period is over.\n\nHow to use TVL to value Ethereum\n\nBy simply examining a table of blockchains ranked by TVL, you can immediately see which blockchains are having success in getting investors to \"lock up\" their crypto funds. According to this metric, Ethereum ranks No. 1 in the world, with $29.39 billion in TVL. And it's not even close. The No. 2 blockchain is Tron, with $5.35 billion in TVL. Taking a big-picture view, Ethereum is responsible for close to 60% of all blockchain TVL. That's a very compelling argument in Ethereum's favor, since it means Ethereum is having a lot of success in encouraging investors to \"lock up\" their funds and trust the blockchain.\n\nBut that's just the start. You can also use TVL with another popular metric -- total market capitalization -- to arrive at a much more nuanced view of which cryptocurrencies are overvalued and which cryptocurrencies are undervalued. For example, many investors like to divide total market capitalization by TVL to arrive at the crypto market's version of the price-to-book ratio. This ratio should be familiar to stock market investors, since it is often used to spot stocks that are trading very low compared to their overall intrinsic value.\n\nSo, for example, you can divide Ethereum's total market capitalization ($204.837 billion) by its TVL ($29.39 billion), to arrive at a very rough approximation of a price-to-book ratio for Ethereum. When you compare Ethereum's price-to-book ratio to that of its direct peers, you can see immediately how Ethereum is doing on a relative basis. For example, Ethereum has a 6.97 price-to-book ratio, compared to 34.36 for Solana, which is up more than 100% in 2023. Again, this is a very encouraging number for Ethereum, since it lets investors know that Ethereum may still have some room to run as part of its bull market rally, while the market might be getting too frothy and speculative for Solana.\n\nDeveloping an investment thesis for Ethereum\n\nThe final step in using TVL to evaluate Ethereum is to come up with an investment thesis based on where funds are moving on the Ethereum blockchain. Using a website like DeFi Llama, it's possible to see exactly which decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are attracting the most action. For example, the top DeFi protocol for Ethereum involves staking. This makes sense, since Ethereum instituted staking as part of The Merge last year.\n\nYou can also see one of the top staking protocols involves Coinbase Global. This, too, makes sense. It appears that Coinbase is having relative success at getting its clients to stake Ethereum directly on its platform. Taken as a whole, Ethereum's success with staking should be a net positive for its long-term growth potential.\n\nAs a long-term investor in Ethereum, you might decide to track TVL over an extended period of time, to see which areas are growing. This can alert you to developments that are still under the radar for many investors.\n\nTVL is useful, but not perfect\n\nTVL can be a very useful metric. It can help you spot when a cryptocurrency is undervalued, and can let you see how a particular blockchain compares to its peers. And, finally, it can let you put actual numbers to some of the hype and speculation you might see in the media. For example, before The Merge, many analysts were hyping the importance of staking for Ethereum. Well, several months later, it looks like they were right. Looking at TVL, it appears staking is very important to Ethereum.\n\nAdmittedly, TVL is not a perfect metric, and there are plenty of analysts who claim the number really needs to be cleaned and scrubbed before it can be used with any accuracy. However, based on my own analysis of TVL, I remain bullish on Ethereum long-term."

There are hundreds, if not thousands, of tokens on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, which is making it hard to keep track of them all. To help you, we have prepared a list of the top Ethereum ERC20 tokens to buy in February 2023.\n\nHere are the best ERC20 tokens you can buy\n\nWrapped Bitcoin\n\nWrapped Bitcoin is one of the most popular ERC20 tokens and it represents Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain. As of writing, the WBTC price stands at $23,821.35, up 3.41% in the last 24 hours, according to CMC.

This cryptocurrency is used to incentivize Chainlink node operators to securely transfer data to and from blockchains. LINK has stood up with a gain of 6.55% costing each token somewhat more than $7.30. Its current stand in the market is $3,705,475,596.\n\nShiba Inu\n\nThe list of the top ERC20 tokens is incomplete without Shiba Inu. From the shibarium launch to making a blast with SHIB-themed burgers, this meme coin has started 2023 with a blast. Shiba is currently trading around $0.00001205 with a one-day trading volume of $343,987,105. Recently, SHIB has seen significant growth, with a price increase of 4.21% over the past 7 days.\n\nThe SandBox\n\nAn Ethereum-based metaverse and gaming ecosystem, The Sandbox allows users to create, build, buy, and sell digital assets in the form of a game. Just like other ERC20 tokens mentioned in this article, SAND has surged by nearly 7.97% during the day. Currently trading at $0.7716 it has increased by 4.38% in the past seven days.\n\nAlso Read: Top 10 Sandbox Crypto Metaverse Projects To Watch For 2023\n\nNote: The information in this article is solely the author\u2019s opinion and not investment advice."

How did traders respond to it, and how might their responses impact the future price of ETH?\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nBreaking resistance briefly\n\nThe daily timeframe price chart for Ethereum [ETH] may not have indicated any significant price movement on 2 February. When that timeframe is examined more closely, it could be observed that ETH broke the $1,700 barrier and briefly traded at $1,713.\n\nFor the first time in more than four months, the price exceeded $1,500, which prompted traders\u2019 reactions.\n\nThe asset was trading at roughly $1,640 as of the time of this writing, and it appeared to have lost a small value. The price was still trading above the support line that was established near $1,500 despite the modest value drop.\n\nAdditionally, according to the Relative Strength Index, Ethereum was still moving in a bullish direction. As of the time of writing, the RSI was above 60 on a daily timeframe.\n\nScramble for profit\n\nThe Netflow measure may be a more accurate reflection of how investors reacted to Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) modest gain on 2 February. The observed Netflow data shows that on 2 February, more Ethereum (ETH) flowed into exchanges than leaving them.\n\nSellers were ready to cash in since the inflow was over 29,000. The observed influx, however, was consistent; there was no noticeable surge.\n\nThe lack of a spike could indicate that the inflow is insufficient to affect the price of ETH significantly. At the time of this writing, the trend line had turned, and outflow exceeded inflow.\n\nExchanges see 11% of the total supply as supply in profit rise\n\nCoinMarketCap estimates that there is currently more than 122 million Ether in circulation. The amount now available on exchanges represents about 11% of the overall supply.\n\nEven though there was a scramble to cash in when the price of ETH spiked, this suggests that only a tiny fraction of the overall supply made its way to trading platforms.\n\nLooking at Glassnode\u2019s Percent Supply in Profit also revealed that a sizable portion of the ETH supply is currently earning interest. Over 64% of the supply, as seen in the observed graph, was profitable as of this writing.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nShort-term investors may be tempted to cash out their ETH holdings now that the price is at its highest point in months. Observed indicators suggest that more ETH are being held than sold, so this development should not have a profound effect on the price of ETH."

However, he revisited the idea of the blockchain in 2013 and began to see real potential in it. He saw that possibilities were opening up between the field of ICT and game theory, and he wanted to be an active player.\n\nThat same year, a mutual friend introduced Wood to Vitalik Buterin. At the time, Buterin had only recently published the Ethereum whitepaper, and Ethereum was still a theory. Immediately after Wood got his hands on the Ethereum whitepaper, he started building its codebase.\n\nBy early January 2014, Wood had already built the first Ethereum client. It was a proof of concept of sorts and was the first sign that Ethereum could be built. And Wood had built everything all alone. He also wrote the Ethereum Yellow paper, which specified the Ethereum virtual machine. It was the first formal specification of a blockchain\u2019s state machine to be published.\n\nWhen the Ethereum team disbanded over questions surrounding Ethereum\u2019s future, Wood sided with the winning faction. Over the next two years, he focused mainly on Ethereum and built much of the architecture supporting it. This includes the general platform, the initial solidity design (Ethereum\u2019s smart contract programming language), and most of the C++ client."

However, it remains to be seen how the crypto market would react in the short term.\n\nAlso Read: Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) To Rank In Top 100?: SHIB Community Bullish\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH To The Moon?\n\nAccording to Bitcoinsensus, ETH\u2019s price action is replicating the pattern that formed basis for last bull run. Essentially, the support strength is accumulated for the next Ethereum bullish breakout in the long term. Between 2019 and 2020, ETH price went through a triangular movement in fluctuation before following an upward curve going into the 2021 bull run. Hence, a similar price momentum can\u2019t be ruled out given the current macro scenario and the Ethereum development scene.\n\n\u201cEthereum is forming similar price action as it formed in the last bear market. Are we in the final months of bearishness?\u201d\n\nShort term projections for the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) are also in favor of the crypto market, as the dollar finds resistance way below the current level of 102 at 90. The Ethereum Shanghai upgrade is scheduled for March 2023. This will be the biggest upgrade on the network after The Merge was completed in September 2022. Against the run of market expectations, The Merge failed to spur a price growth in not just Ethereum but other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAlso Read: Dogecoin News: DOGE To Get Forked By This Ethereum Competitor?\n\nAs of writing, ETH price stands at $1,678, up 0.61% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGape price tracker."

        "title": "NFT market shows signs of recovery as January trading volumes hit 7-month high - TechCrunch",
        "content": "It appears the NFT market is slowly getting back on its feet. Trading volumes rose for two months straight, with January scoring the highest volumes since June last year, according to the Dapp Industry Report: January 2023.\n\nThe growth in January marked a stark difference from the trend of the past few months \u2014 October saw trading volumes dip to a low of $662 million \u2014 but in November, the market halted the downward trend to stay at $662 million, per the report.\n\nVolumes then recovered in December, rising slightly to $683 million, and increasing 38.5% from that number to $946 million in January.\n\nA number of blockchains allow traders to buy and sell NFTs, but Ethereum has held the leading position with over $36 billion in all-time sales, data from NFT aggregator CryptoSlam showed. In comparison, Ronin and Solana \u2014 the second and third largest blockchains by NFT sales volume in total \u2014 had about $4.2 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively.\n\nJanuary was strong for both Ethereum and Solana, which saw trading volumes of $659 million and $85 million, respectively.\n\nFebruary is showing signs of continued strength as well \u2014 at least so far. As of February 3, the Ethereum blockchain had $26.5 million sales across more than 25,500 unique buyers, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nWhile Ethereum accounts for the lion\u2019s share of trading volumes, with more than 78% of all trades on the blockchain, Polygon had the biggest influx of traders in January, the report showed.\n\nPolygon\u2019s trading volume grew 124% to $46 million in January from $20 million in December. In the past week, NFT sales volume on the blockchain grew 43.5% to reach $2.8 million, indicating continued interest in the blockchain.\n\nIn late December, two large Solana NFT projects, DeGods and y00ts, said they would leave the blockchain in 2023, which stirred up conflicting sentiments across the community. DeGods said it would migrate to Ethereum, and y00ts plans to move to Polygon.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of the year, we noticed that much of the creator economy\u2019s attention was focused on ETH and Solana,\u201d Ryan Wyatt, CEO of Polygon Studios, previously told TechCrunch. \u201cTherefore, we decided to go against the trend and focus on the untapped potential of web3 by onboarding large enterprise brands, DeFi platforms and gaming companies. We did this successfully through ecosystem fund investments and white-glove partnership support.\u201d\n\nAs big NFT collections like DeGods and y00ts diversify their alliances to blockchains, it could also draw in other holders who are seeking new opportunities or see value elsewhere.\n\nThe consecutive growth of the past couple months could also point to a broader upward trend across the crypto market. It could also potentially help drive creators and projects to form new use cases in the NFT world as they look to capitalize on the bullish marketplace."

Thus, market cap is always less or equal to FDV.\n\nBy printing time, Optimism (OP) has only 5% of its tokens released into the circulating supply: as such, its market cap is sitting at $664 million, while the FDV targets $13.3 billion.\n\nSolana (SOL) sees its FDV at $13.2 billion, while its market capitalization is over $9.1 billion; SOL, therefore, is the 12th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Optimism's OP holds the 76th position in this ranking.\n\nAlso, Evan van Ness noticed that another \"Ethereum killer\" Avalanche (AVAX) is well beyond both Solana (SOL) and Optimism (OP) with its FDV over $15.3 billion.\n\nIs Optimism (OP) more centralized than Solana (SOL)?\n\nHe slammed Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) as an \"ill-performant Web2 database\" and a \"Go Ethereum (geth) fork (...) with big blocks and sidechains,\" respectively.\n\nPseudonymous DeFi and NFT expert Foobar (@0xfoobar on Twitter) opined that Optimism (OP) is more centralized than Solana (SOL) so far. Evan van Ness responded that Optimism (OP) is only attempting to retain Ethereum's (ETH) level of security while Solana (SOL) is centralized by design.\n\nAs covered by U.Today yesterday, Optimism (OP) is getting closer to Bedrock, an upgrade that, if passed, might advance its throughput and interoperability with Ethereum (ETH).\n\nOptimism (OP) continues to increase its share in net TVL of all Ethereum's L2 ecosystems: today, Feb. 4, it surpassed 33%, L2Beat data says."

It will bring several important changes to the network, including increased efficiency, reduced gas fees, and a new consensus algorithm.\n\nThe upgrade is expected to make Ethereum more secure, scalable, and user-friendly, which will be a big boost for developers and users alike.\n\nThe conference call also discussed the progress of the Shanghai upgrade on various testnets. The Zhejiang testnet will activate the Shanghai upgrade on February 7th, followed by releases on the Sepolia testnet (mid-February) and Goerli testnet (late February and early March).\n\nHowever, the smooth activation of the upgrade on these testnets will be crucial to ensuring a successful mainnet launch.\n\nRelated Reading | India\u2019s Retail Behemoth Set To Add CBDC Support"

        "content": "Staking in cryptocurrency is gaining popularity over its ability to offer investors benefits such as passive income. Therefore, several crypto projects are dominating this area based on the value staked in their respective networks.\n\nAs of February 2, 2023, Ethereum (ETH) ranked top among leading smart contract crypto projects by staking market cap with a valuation of $29.1 billion, followed by Cardano (ADA) at $10.4 billion, while Binance Coin (BNB) occupies the third spot at $7.5 billion, according to Cardano Daily data.\n\nElsewhere, Avalanche\u2019s (AVAX) market cap ranks fourth at $5.6 billion, while Polygon (MATIC), with a valuation of $4.3 billion, occupies the fifth spot. Interestingly, Polkadot (DOT) accounts for the highest reward rate at 14.47%, with a market cap of $3.8 billion to rank sixth overall.\n\nOther smart contract crypto projects making the top ten list based on market capitalization include Tron (TRX), NEAR protocol (NEAR), Algorand (ALGO), and Fantom (FTM).\n\nTop ten smart contract platforms by staking market cap. Source: Cradano Daily\n\nEthereum and Cardano\u2019s staking dominance\n\nIt is worth noting that both Cardano and Ethereum have undergone extensive network development activity that has contributed to their high ranking. For instance, after the Merge upgrade, Ethereum investors got an opportunity to start staking their ETH.\n\nIn this line, the Ethereum community is looking forward to withdrawing their staked ETH once the Shanghai hard fork goes live. In the meantime, ETH stakers are currently simulating the withdrawal process after the Zhejiang testnet was rolled out.\n\nIndeed, the staking feature is considered monumental for the Ethereum ecosystem that has been touted to help the second-ranked crypto by market capitalization.\n\nCradano\u2019s ecosystem growth\n\nElsewhere, Cardano\u2019s staked amount currently contributes to over 70% of ADA\u2019s supply. Notably, the staking feature on Cardano has recorded significant growth in recent months. For instance, a Finbold report in October 2022 noted that the platform added about 20,000 new staking addresses on average for more than a year.\n\nOverall, the network has been a hub of development activity that continues to be received well by the crypto community. In this line, features such as smart contracts have surpassed the milestone of over 5,000 as the blockchain moves to realize its potential to become an \u2018Ethereum killer.\u2019\n\nLastly, the platform also ranks second among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by GitHub development activity as of February 2023."
