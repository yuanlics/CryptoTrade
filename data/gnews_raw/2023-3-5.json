        "title": "Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade: What you need to know - Kraken Blog",
        "content": "The Shanghai upgrade is a set of changes to the Ethereum protocol that will allow users to unstake, or withdraw, their staked ether (ETH).\n\nBefore the Shanghai upgrade, any ETH dedicated to staking remained locked within the Ethereum blockchain. The Shanghai upgrade will include a change to the Ethereum protocol that allows this staked ETH to be unlocked for the first time.\n\nShanghai is the first major change to the Ethereum blockchain after its transition from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nThis transition process, known as The Merge, laid the technical foundation for future scalability improvements on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nHave more questions about Ethereum\u2019s transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake? Check out our beginner\u2019s guide to The Ethereum Merge.\n\nWhat will the Shanghai upgrade include?\n\nThere are currently four Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) included in the Shanghai upgrade:\n\nEIP-3651 Warm COINBASE\n\nEIP-3855 PUSH0 instruction\n\nEIP-3860 Limit and meter initcode\n\nEIP-4895 Beacon Chain withdrawals\n\nThe most notable of the changes is EIP-4895.\n\nThis EIP allows users who staked their ETH in order to maintain Ethereum\u2019s new proof-of-stake \u201cBeacon Chain\u201d to withdraw or \u201cunstake\u201d their funds for the first time.\n\nOn December 8, 2022, the Ethereum core team held an All Core Developers (ACD) meeting. The Ethereum team agreed to target March 2023 as the release date for Shanghai\u2019s mainnet launch. However, this is a tentative date based on the assumption that the Zhejiang, Sepolia, and Goerli testnets are successful.\n\nShanghai + Capella = Shapella\n\nA second hard fork will also be taking place alongside Shanghai, called Capella. This is why you might see \u201cShanghai/Capella\u201d or \u201cShapella\u201d mentioned simultaneously in the run-up to the network upgrade.\n\nNow that Ethereum has a proof-of-stake execution chain and a consensus chain (Beacon Chain), new changes can require hard-forking both layers.\n\nIn this instance, Shanghai references the upcoming execution chain hard fork, while Capella references the consensus chain hard fork.\n\nHow the Shanghai upgrade impacts Kraken clients\n\nKraken has no control over the success of the Shanghai testnet or when the Shanghai upgrade may take place. For U.S. clients impacted by the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s recent decision regarding Kraken\u2019s on-chain staking program, Kraken will return all staked ETH to their spot wallets after the Shanghai upgrade takes place.\n\nFollowing the hard fork, Kraken clients who staked their ETH will be able to withdraw their assets for the first time. Because there may be a high demand in a concentrated period of time from ETH stakers looking to access their coins, unstaking could take a few hours. Kraken also has no direct control over ETH unstaking time frames, as the unstaking feature operates according to the withdrawal conditions set by the Ethereum development team.\n\nUseful official links\n\nThese materials are for general information purposes only and are not investment advice or a recommendation or solicitation to buy, sell, stake, or hold any digital asset or to engage in any specific trading strategy.

        "title": "Warning sign for ETH price? Ethereum volume profile is down 90% since March 2020 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The price of Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), has recovered 78% since June 2022. But this doesn\u2019t guarantee further upside, particularly with declining trading volumes suggesting that the risk of a major correction is high.\n\nEther volume profile drops 90% since March 2020\n\nA \u201cvolume profile\u201d indicator displays trading activity across prices, with the blue indicating buying volume and the yellow indicating sell volume.\n\nIllustration of a volume profile bar. Source: TradingView\n\nIn March 2020, when the market bottomed, Ether\u2019s volume profile on a weekly chart showed about 160 million ETH trades across the $85\u2013$270 price range. At the time, the selling volume was greater than the buying volume by around 4 million ETH.\n\nBut Ether buying volume regained momentum after ETH price rallied above $270 in July 2020.\n\nNotably, between July 2020 and November 2020, the Ether volume profile displayed about 64.25 million ETH trades across the $270\u2013$450 range, with buying volume exceeding selling volume by almost 1 million ETH.\n\nETH/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe price-volume trend remained largely synchronous with one another until November 2021, when ETH/USD reached its record high at around $4,950.\n\nIn other words, most traders purchased Ether as its price climbed, illustrating their confidence in the longevity of the bullish reversal that followed the March 2020 crash.\n\nHowever, that confidence is missing in the 2023 Ether market rebound.\n\n2022 ETH price bottom differs from two years ago\n\nAt first, the Ether volume profile at the beginning of it price recovery in June 2022 from $900 shows 12.50 million ETH trades, down more than 90% from March 2020.\n\nBut despite a 75% price recovery, fewer traders have been participating in Ether\u2019s potential bottom this time around when compared with the beginning of the 2020 bull market.\n\nWhat\u2019s further concerning is the rising sell-volumes during the current ETH price rebound.\n\nFor instance, the red horizontal line in the daily chart below, dubbed the \u201cpoint of control,\u201d or POC \u2014 which represents the area with the most open trading positions \u2014 shows a net 8.21 million ETH volume of around $1,550, with sellers exceeding buyers by 170,000 ETH trades.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIn other words, ETH\u2019s ongoing price recovery might not have the legs it did in March 2020, especially when coupled with the overall volume profile decline over the past two years.\n\nMost Ether investors are still in profit\n\nMore downside cues for Ether come from one of Ethereum\u2019s widely monitored on-chain metrics that tracks the percentage of ETH\u2019s circulating supply in profit.\n\nRelated: Ethereum eyes 25% correction in March, but ETH price bulls have a silver lining\n\nAs of March 6, about 65% of ETH was bought at a lower price. In other words, investors\u2019 probability of securing profits remains high in the event of a significant price drop.\n\nEther circulating supply in profit. Source: Glassnode\n\nTherefore, Ether price could see the real bottom if the supply in profit falls below 30% (green zone), which would reflect previous market cycles and the March 2020 bottom, as shown in the chart above.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Arbitrum co-founders see opportunity for continued layer-2 growth through DeFi, gaming - TechCrunch",
        "content": "As we segue into March, the Ethereum layer-2 space is continuing to see strong demand: One of its largest scaling solutions, Arbitrum, is seeing renewed exponential growth through subsectors in the ecosystem.\n\nWhile base blockchains (layer ones, or L1s in crypto-speak) remain the bedrock of the web3 landscape, technology built on top (layer two chains, or L2s) are exploding. Arbitrum recently surpassed the Ethereum chain that it is built on in terms of total transactions processed.\n\nArbitrum is an L2 Ethereum-focused scaling solution that aims to act like Ethereum but with transactions that cost way less and processing that\u2019s way faster. It makes up about 54% of the market share on Ethereum and has about $3.38 billion total value locked, according to L2Beat data. The TVL, which is tracked through the amount of tokens locked in all escrow contracts for an L2, is near its highest point since May 2022, the data shows.\n\nL2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, Immutable X, StarkWare and others are built on top of layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum. But L2s function in a faster, cheaper way and reduce the load on L1s by bundling up transactions and only recording final results on the main blockchain. That way it doesn\u2019t clog up the network.\n\nGrowing DeFi and other use cases\n\nDecentralized finance continues to dominate most demand for L2s, but there may be other areas that could gain stronger traction, such as gaming. \u201cIn the short term, DeFi is showing the most traction,\u201d said Harry Kalodner, CTO and co-founder of Offchain Labs, a developer of Arbitrum. But DeFi may not be the path to onboard \u201chundreds of millions of users,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe path to mass adoption is where the user doesn\u2019t know they\u2019re using a blockchain and can just get the benefits of using it,\u201d Kalodner said. \u201cIt seems like gaming and social applications could [drive] that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis growth feels very real because we\u2019re seeing it across all metrics with new addresses, number of transactions and TVL: Across the board we\u2019re seeing an increase,\u201d Kalodner said.\n\nIf transaction volume is \u201cway up\u201d and everything else were deflated, that wouldn\u2019t make sense, but all the core metrics are higher, said Offchain Labs co-founder and CEO Steven Goldfeder.\n\nThe broadly positive movement in metrics may imply that the L2 boom is not predicated on a fad, or single-point distortion in the incentive structure of Ethereum-focused transactions; at times in crypto\u2019s history, changes to business models, the introduction of new chains, and at times even hacks have led to swings in different activity levels. The L2 market can simply claim growth as the reason for its changing numbers \u2014 growth that, by our understanding, appears predicated on regular use instead of near-term arbitrage.\n\nOn Feb. 21, Arbtirum passed Ethereum in total daily transactions at 12.77 transactions per second compared to Ethereum\u2019s 12.55 TPS but has since fallen back into second place, according to L2Beat data. But the average total L2 TPS across all scaling solutions has been higher than Ethereum\u2019s for the past few months, meaning that the user base is depending more and more on L2 solutions to handle transactions than the core Ethereum L1 chain?\n\nThink of it like uploading a PDF file: Uploading every word in a document would take up a lot more space and time than bundling it into one document and shipping it out. Now apply that to transactions on the blockchain.\n\nGrowing the pie\n\nGoing forward, the focus for 2023 is \u201cgrowing the pie,\u201d Kalodner said. \u201cThat\u2019s the path to even more growth.\u201d\n\nWhile its DeFi ecosystem will be \u201cgrowing itself\u201d in the short term, the team also plans to make an active effort to expand scaling solutions further for gaming and NFTs so nontechnical and nonfinancial users could also expand on the platform, Kalodner said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t pick favorites; we work with everybody and we want as broad of an ecosystem as possible,\u201d Kaldoner said. \u201cBut we\u2019re much more focused on gaming and NFTs for active outreach.\u201d\n\nArbitrum is also \u201cvery much going after the crypto-native adoption as well as institutional adoption including financial institutions, social platforms,\u201d Goldfeder said. \u201cFundamentally we have dominant market share in DeFi today and our focus is pretty general, but definitely DeFi and gaming are our strongest spots right now.\u201d\n\nBut in order to grow the pie, so to speak, Arbitrum has to make its platform more inclusive to developers and users, Goldfeder said. \u201cOur thesis is we have to bend our technology to developers instead of making them bend to us \u2026 the way to get [a] billion users is through the next million developers. We have to expand the pod.\u201d"

The network saw an outflow of $10.15 million during the same period.\n\nThe network\u2019s significant inflow occurred on Mar. 5 when it recorded an inflow of $16.57 million in one day.\n\nDeFillama data showed that USD Coin (USDC) accounts for 67% of all stablecoins on Arbitrum with $968.63 million. Other dominant stablecoins on the network include Tether\u2019s USDT and DAI, with a cumulative balance of $394.81 million.\n\nThe increased stablecoin inflow also coincided with a period when transaction activity on Arbitrum increased. The L2 network saw its transaction volume reach a new all-time high of 690,000 in Feb. Besides that, the increased network activity saw its transaction volume surpass Ethereum for the first time.\n\nMeanwhile, Arbitrum is the second most popular network for decentralized exchanges (DEX). For context, its total volume in the last 24 hours was $207.29 million, ahead of rivals like Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, and Optimism. However, it is miles below Ethereum, which is $1.03 billion.\n\nAccording to L2Beat, the total value of assets (TVL) locked on Arbitrum is $3.37 billion, rising 0.17% in the last seven days.\n\nOptimism stablecoin inflow rises 5% in seven days.\n\nSince the beginning of March, Optimism\u2019s (OP) stablecoin inflow increased 4.89% to $669.11 million, according to DeFillama data.\n\nOptimism\u2019s significant inflow occurred on Mar. 3 when it recorded around $6.3 million.\n\nThe increased inflow is in contrast to February when it recorded an outflow of nearly $120 million.\n\nUSDC is also the dominant stablecoin on Optimism. The Circle-issued stablecoin accounts for roughly 55% of the stablecoins on the network, with $364.56 million. The other stablecoins in the top three include Synthetix protocol\u2019s sUSD and USDT, with a combined value of $145.77 million.\n\nOptimism\u2019s TVL stands at $1.89 billion, according to L2 beats data.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Ethereum is in an \u201cobvious accumulation range of all time,\u201d this crypto analyst notes on a Twitter post on March 3.\n\nWill Ethereum Spring To $5K?\n\nCrypto analyst \u201cMoon\u201d thinks there could be more upside potential for ETH in the near future, strongly believing that many would want to get involved once the coin has broken out, rallying to the $5,000 and $7,000 trade range. As it is, ETH prices are within a bear formation in higher timeframes. Still, it is relatively solid from its lows in November 2022.\n\n$ETH in one of the most obvious accumulation ranges of all time, lot of hindsight analysis will be done when its at $5k, $7k, whatever in a few years why you didnt buy more here, and people are flipping out over $100 moves pic.twitter.com/HS9fJuHTfx \u2014 moon (@MoonOverlord) March 3, 2023\n\nETH is trading at around $1,580 and has failed to breach the $1,700 resistance level marking February highs. On the lower end, the coin has support at about the $1,500 line.\n\nFor the uptrend to take shape, buyers need to push ETH above February resistance lines and register new Q1 2023 highs. This would comprise a bullish breakout, setting the base for another leg up that may thrust ETH to new all-time highs above $5,000 to $7,000. It is a preview that ETH proponents hold, citing technical and fundamental factors.\n\nAccording to the analyst, at present levels, traders and investors wishing to hold the coin for months and years should be buying the dips lest they be left by the ETH bull train.\n\nEven though proponents are optimistic about the ETH\u2019s prospect, it should be noted that it must break above the current range, ideally with expanding participation. Should this be the case, then not only will ETH rally above $2,000, but it stands to possibly more than double, rallying to retest 2021 highs.\n\nAt that time, ETH soared to retest $4,900, a high, more than tripling from 2017 peaks when ETH tested $1,300. Presently, the coin is above that critical high of late 2017, acting as support.\n\nWhat Will Make Or Break ETH?\n\nStill, traders and investors should proceed with caution. Several fundamental factors, as the events of 2022 reveal, could impact the crypto markets, including ETH.\n\nFor instance, despite decreasing inflation, the United States Federal Reserve has said it could increase interest rates as a tool. Besides, the economy remains weak with relatively weak labor conditions, factors that the central bank might consider.\n\nOn the more positive side, ETH bulls cite the network\u2019s \u201cburn rate.\u201d So far, billions of ETH have been taken out of supply. Over the months, ETH\u2019s inflation could drop even further, making the coin deflationary.\n\nFeatured Image From Canva, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAn ancient Ethereum whale has made a sudden appearance after being dormant for over five years. The whale address, which had accumulated 10,266 ETH in 2017 through mining activities, recently transferred the entire amount, worth around $16 million, out of the wallet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe transfer also included the movement of 1,322 ETH, worth around $2 million, to cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex, which suggests that the whale may be planning to liquidate some of their holdings. The timing of the transfer is significant, as it coincides with Ethereum's recent price dip, which has seen it fall to a local support level.\n\nAn address that has been dormant for more than 5 years transferred 10,266 $ETH ($16M) out.\n\n\n\nThe 10,266 $ETH was obtained through mining in 2017.\n\n\n\nAmong them, 1,322 $ETH ($2M) was transferred to #Poloniex.https://t.co/hsXiBh5iS2 pic.twitter.com/7L1nkx6Fe6 \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 6, 2023\n\nThe whale's sudden move is not an isolated incident, as other dormant whales have recently woken up and begun to move large amounts of Ethereum. These moves have been seen as a sign of profit-taking activities, as these whales may be looking to cash in on their holdings before a potential market downturn.\n\nThe activity of dormant whales on the Ethereum network is an important factor to consider, as it can significantly affect the supply and demand dynamics of the cryptocurrency. However, it is important to note that whales are not necessarily bad actors, and their activity is often a natural part of the market cycle.\n\nAs Ethereum continues to move downward, we might see more profit-taking activities. The overall impact of the profit-taking from a relatively small whale will most likely not appear on the market even in the case of market selling without proper distribution. However, Ethereum is not in the best position right now, which is why even a slightest spike in selling activity might lead to downward movement."

        "content": "Happy Monday, everyone. The annual pilgrimage known as EthDenver wrapped up this weekend, and after two days of diving into the festivities, I came away heartened by the optimism and the sheer vitality of the scene. Sure, there was cringe aplenty, and I\u2019ll never quite get used to grown men dressed as unicorns, but the raucous event felt as big as a Broncos game and was a reminder that\u2014even after its annus horribilis\u2014crypto is very much thriving.\n\nWhile the event was dedicated to all things Ethereum, it also featured dozens of booths and people plugging rival blockchains, including the Near Protocol, which launched a \u201cproduct-first operating system\u201d designed for browsing Web3 products like exchanges and NFTs. All of this reminded me of a question that\u2019s long nagged at me: Why are there so many blockchains in the first place?\n\nFor years, would-be contenders like Solana and Polkadot have branded themselves as \u201cEthereum killers,\u201d even as others launch yet more blockchains, including Sui and Aptos, which are being pushed by teams once tied to Facebook\u2019s aborted crypto ambitions. The backers of these projects will tell you they offer new innovations and that they are cheaper and faster than Ethereum. But I\u2019m not so sure.\n\nI can\u2019t shake the feeling that the primary goal of these newer projects is not so much to share a better blockchain with the world, but for the founders to get filthy rich by dumping millions more tokens into a crypto ecosystem already awash with them. This is not necessarily a bad thing. After all, the founders of Ethereum made out like bandits, and every startup in the traditional tech world reserves blocks of shares for its board and early employees.\n\nThe difference between traditional startups and new blockchains, however, is that the latter never go away\u2014even if it\u2019s clear they will never catch on. In Silicon Valley, most startups fail after a year or two and, at best, someone acquires them for parts. Failed blockchains, by contrast, take on a Walking Dead\u2013like afterlife as bag-holders pump their tokens for years on social media in hopes of finding new suckers even after it\u2019s clear the chain is a zombie.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that the blockchain world needs to be limited to the twin titans of Bitcoin and Ethereum. But it would be nice if the crypto world took note of the critical mass at EthDenver, and started putting more wood behind fewer arrows.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nEco, a startup backed by a16z and others, told customers its touted 2.5% to 5% yields came from lending to Goldman and Fidelity\u2014but in reality, it was putting funds in DeFi.

        "title": "ETH Risks Falling to $1500 if Bearish Sentiment Intensifies (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price action has been very choppy in recent weeks after facing rejection from a significant resistance. However, there are multiple levels that could provide support and hold the price in the event of a deeper pullback.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily chart, the price was rejected from the $1800 level and the higher boundary of the large symmetrical triangle pattern earlier in February. It has since broken below the 50-day moving average, located around the $1600 mark.\n\nCurrently, the price is consolidating below the broken MA and is yet to show an impulsive move after the bearish breakout. If the cryptocurrency fails to reclaim the broken 50-day moving average, the 200-day moving average, trending around the $1400 level, could be the next support, followed closely by the $1300 static zone.\n\nOn the other hand, a break back above the 50-day moving average would likely lead to an eventual breakout above the symmetrical triangle and a bullish rally in the short term.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nLooking at the 4-hour timeframe, it is evident that the price has been oscillating in a very tight range following an impulsive rejection from the $1650 resistance level a few days ago. $1500 seems likely to be tested in the short term, and if it fails to hold the market, the price could plunge toward the next support area, which is located around the $1350 mark.\n\nThe RSI indicator is also moving sideways, but it is still showing values below 50%, which points to the bearish momentum and further boosts the probability of a bearish continuation in the coming days.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nEthereum Taker Buy Sell Ratio (SMA 100)\n\nAs Ethereum\u2019s price has been consolidating below significant resistance levels in the past few weeks, it would be useful to evaluate the futures market sentiment to gather further insights into what the market would do next.\n\nThe Taker Buy Sell Ratio is one of the most useful metrics to achieve this, as it measures whether the bulls or the bears are currently executing their trades more aggressively. Values above one indicate dominant buying pressure, while values below 1 are associated with negative sentiment.\n\nThis metric has been trending down for the last few weeks, indicating that the buying pressure is fading in the futures market, and the recent consolidating price action also validates this interpretation.\n\nYet, the metric is currently approaching the 1 threshold, and a drop below would mean that the bears are in control once more, which could lead to a price decline in the coming weeks if this trend continues."

        "content": "ETH\u2019s short-term recovery could depend on the USD and interest rates trend.\n\nTechnical indicators suggest short-term consolidation.\n\nThe first few days of March have failed to give Ethereum [ETH] holders a much-desired breather. Despite the reality of despair, any hope for respite could depend on one condition, according to Chris Burniske.\n\nThe ex-crypto investment head at ARKInvest opined that ETH, alongside Bitcoin [BTC], would only recover if the dollar and interest rates drop.\n\nFor much of February the dollar and rates went higher, while crypto hung in there. If the former two start to drift lower, $BTC could push through $25K, and if $ETHBTC pushes alongside that we could get another round of fireworks. \u2014 Chris Burniske (@cburniske) March 5, 2023\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nStriving for stronghold\n\nRecall that the first two months of the year brought glaring greens to the market, with the top two cryptocurrencies earning gains for their holders.\n\nIn addition, the Fed rates increase in February had initially triggered reds in the market. But ETH, led by BTC ensured that the drawdown only lasted a few hours. So, does the ETH technical outlook appear encouraging yet?\n\nWell, the ETH/USD daily chart showed that the asset volatility was exiting its long-standing contraction status at press time.\n\nMeanwhile, the lower part of the Bollinger Bands (BB) which measures an asset\u2019s volatile condition was at par with the ETH price. Since the bands did not squeeze, this status indicates that ETH was oversold and had fewer chances of a significant breakout.\n\nHowever, the Directional Movement Index (DMI) suggested that the altcoin might not be ready for a rally, and the condition mentioned above could be instrumental.\n\nThis was because the -DMI (red) positioned higher than the +DMI (green) at 20.71 to 18.60. Moreso, the chart above revealed that the Average Directional Index (ADX) had no strong support for either a breath or bullish move.\n\nThe ADX (yellow) at 25, indicated a strong directional movement while a value below it shows a weak one. At the time of writing, the ADX was 14.90.\n\nPortfolios hang in the balance\n\nApart from the downside projection of the technical indicators, the liquidations over the past few days have faded signs of a bullish crossover. But some ETH holders are optimistic that the Shanghai upgrade could offer a slide ways from the bears.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nThere have, however, been shifts in the final mainnet event after it was initially slated for March. But Ethereum developers seemed to have made progress with the Sepolia Testnet success, and Georli in view. So, how has the ETH decline to $1,561 affected its holders?\n\nAccording to Santiment, the 30-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio was -3.171%. The metric shows the ratio between the current price and the average price acquired in relation to market profitability.\n\nHence, the MVRV ratio drawdown implied that most of those who acquired ETH a few weeks back remained underwater."

        "content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nThe expected release of the Shanghai hard fork by Ethereum developers has been postponed by around two weeks. The upgrade was initially planned to be launched in late March, but now it is expected to be rolled out in the first two weeks of April. The delay was disclosed during an Ethereum developer meeting on March 2. In the meeting, the main developers agreed that the Shanghai hard fork would take place approximately two weeks after the Goerli testnet release, which is scheduled for March 14. The Goerli testnet is going to be the last trial run before the Shanghai upgrade is implemented on the mainnet.According to Tim Beiko, a coordinator and core developer of the Ethereum project, they typically give users at least two weeks' notice after making an announcement before implementing an upgrade on the main network. Assuming everything goes well with the Goerli testnet release on March 14, and they agree to proceed with the mainnet upgrade on March 16, the earliest possible time for the Shanghai hard fork to take place would be during the first week of April.On March 2, Beiko mentioned in a series of tweets that they did not decide on a specific date for the mainnet release yet. However, they are likely to determine a date during the upcoming developers' meeting on March 16, given that the Goerli testnet runs smoothly.The Shanghai Capella, which is also known as Shapella, will be the final opportunity for Ethereum clients and staking providers to make sure that the Shanghai hard fork can be carried out without any issues when it is eventually released on the main network. This mainnet upgrade has been highly anticipated, and it will allow the slow withdrawal of ETH that has been staked on Beacon Chain.To ensure the stability and safety of the Ethereum network, withdrawals of ETH will be adjusted dynamically based on the number of validators who are exiting at any given time. Validators are required to complete a two-step process, which includes joining an exit queue and undergoing a withdrawal period. Consequently, the withdrawal of ETH will occur gradually over time.Presently, there are about 17.1 million ETH staked on the Beacon Chain, which represents slightly over 14 percent of the total Ethereum supply and is valued at approximately $28 billion, given the current asset prices."

        "content": "Israel's Tax Authority in Jerusalem is investigating the possibility that two NFT (non-fungible token) creators did not report revenues of approximately NIS 8 million from the sale of an NFT based on a 3D scan of the stones of the Western Wall, according to a Friday report from the Tax Authority.\n\nThe suspects are Avraham Cohen from Jerusalem and Antony Polak from Har Adar. They are the owners of the website holyrocknft.com, which -according to its own literature- works to \"combine the business world and technological progress with Jewish faith and spirit.\" Through this site, according to the Tax Authority, the two sold their NFTs.\n\nThe investigation revealed that the suspects have sold 1,700 works since 2021 and obtained 620 Ethereum in payment which, at the time of the transactions, was equivalent to approximately NIS 8m. According to these findings, these revenues are, in fact, business earnings - but the pair did not report them as such.\n\nSome of the funds received by the suspects were even transferred between digital wallets, which raises additional suspicion of criminal concealment of property. Women are seen walking across the Western Wall site in a photo taken February 9, 2023 (credit: MARC ISRAEL SELLEM/THE JERUSALEM POST)\n\nThe judge presiding over the case, Judge Amir Shaked of the Jerusalem Magistrate's Court, released the suspects under restrictive conditions, reported the Tax Authority. These conditions included the suspects' turning over their digital wallets where the Ethereum is stored.\n\nThe Tax Authority reported that the investigation is ongoing.\n\nAs of press time, the Holy Rock NFT Project's website reads: \"In accordance with the settlement we reached with the State of Israel (Ministry of Religions), as part of the proceedings 67258-11-21, we would like to update that we have decided to agree to leave the temporary restraining order, which prevents us from selling additional Holy Rocks NFT, valid until the end of legal proceedings with the state Israel, however, we will make it clear that all other activities planned for the community will take place as scheduled.\"\n\nRecent Western Wall NFT criminal activity\n\nBen Benhorin, a graphic designer from Tel Aviv who specialized in creating and selling NFT-type digital art, was arrested on Feb. 26 for not reporting his revenues totaling approximately NIS 3 million from his sales as well as not reporting the conversion of 30 Ethereum-type digital currencies that he received as payments.\n\nBenhorin creates and sells NFT art on the Opensea International platform under the brand name WUWA. It was found during the investigation that as part of the annual report to the tax authorities in 2021, the suspect did not report any income from sales on the platform at all. Advertisement\n\nAccording to the suspicion, Benhorin converted some of the cryptocurrency he received for the sale of the NFT into other currencies, using the Uniswap platform and didn't report this to the tax authority, an action that is considered a sale and taxable.\n\nNo reports of such conversions were found in the tax returns submitted by the suspect.\n\nWalla! contributed to this report."

        "content": "By EWN \u2022 Published: 05 Mar 2023 \u2022 10:15\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the cryptocurrency that started it all, has been on a wild ride since its inception in 2009. It has gone from being worth just pennies worth a couple of pizzas to reaching a high of nearly $65,000 in 2021! So, what does the future hold for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and the newest meme-coin gem Dogetti (DETI)?\n\nBullish Bitcoin Predictions\u2026\n\nWell, according to some experts, Bitcoin is going to the moon! And no, I don\u2019t mean literally, but in terms of price. Some analysts predict that by 2024, Bitcoin could reach anywhere from $100,000 to $500,000. That\u2019s right, folks, we\u2019re talking Lambo money!\n\nBut what\u2019s causing this sudden surge in optimism for Bitcoin? Well, there are a few factors at play. First, institutional investors are starting to take notice of Bitcoin\u2019s potential as a store of value. Companies like Tesla, MicroStrategy, and Square have all invested in Bitcoin, and more are sure to follow.\n\nSecond, there\u2019s the limited supply of Bitcoin. There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in existence, and with the halving that occurs every four years, the rate at which new Bitcoins are created is slowing down. This scarcity is driving up demand and, in turn, the price.\n\nEthereum To Follow Suit!\n\nNow, what does all of this mean for other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH)? Bitcoin\u2019s success will likely lead to increased interest and investment in other cryptocurrencies. After all, the more people are familiar with crypto, the more likely they will branch out and explore other options. And as we have seen many times, as Bitcoin increases in price, the entire crypto market generally follows suit!\n\nAs for Ethereum, it has been making waves of its own lately. The Ethereum network is the foundation for many decentralised applications (dApps) and smart contracts, making it a valuable tool for developers. Ethereum\u2019s price already hit all-time highs in 2021, and some analysts predict that it could reach $10,000 or more in the coming years.\n\nDogetti \u2013 The Latest Ultra Low-Cap Gem that could 100x\n\nAre you ready to join the latest addition to the meme coin family? Well, hold on to your leashes because Dogetti (DETI) is here, and it\u2019s not playing fetch! Inspired by the Mafia theme, Dogetti promises to reward its loyal family with a 2% reflection protocol. That means the more you invest, the more you get to eat, so make sure you bring your appetite!\n\nBut Dogetti isn\u2019t just about food; it\u2019s also about trading. With DogettiSwap, you can exchange any ERC20 token with ease, thanks to its user-friendly interface. And if you\u2019re looking for a new furry companion, DogettiNFTs will let you mint your very own Dogetti pet.\n\nBut what does Bitcoins blow up mean for ultra-low cap gems, such as Dogetti (DETI)? Similar to Ethereum\u2019s outcome, Bitcoins increased gains will only lead to an increase of interest in the other altcoins; therefore, everyone will be on the hunt for the next gem \u2013 which is obviously the coin you are reading about! As Dogetti hasn\u2019t seen gains yet, there is a chance this coin could explode, giving you a 100x return\u2026\n\nWith all these exciting features, you may want to consider joining their family soon. Who knows, you might just get an offer you can\u2019t refuse!\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThere you have it! As Bitcoin rises, as experts predict \u2013 the rest of the crypto market should follow suit. As this happens, you want to be ahead of the crowd and choose coins with great potential, such as Ethereum and Dogetti!\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to put timings on these things, and predictions are never certain, but one thing is for sure: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are here to stay, and they\u2019re only going to become more prominent as time goes on. So, grab your moon boots, and let\u2019s blast off into the future of finance!\n\nFor More Information On Dogetti (DETI):\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nSponsored\n\nWARNING: The investment in crypto assets is not regulated, it may not be suitable for retail investors and the total amount invested could be lost\n\nAVISO IMPORTANTE: La inversi\u00f3n en criptoactivos no est\u00e1 regulada, puede no ser adecuada para inversores minoristas y perderse la totalidad del importe invertido"

        "content": "A crypto strategist who nailed the end of the Bitcoin bull market in 2021 is warning Ethereum holders, saying that ETH could witness significant downside risk.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 677,100 Twitter followers that bearish momentum could go to the next level for Ethereum if it trades below a key support level.\n\n\u201cBelow the gray area COULD get ugly. I\u2019ll talk a long down there with a tight stop. It\u2019s a nice spot for some short to mid term invalidation for longs. If we start to close, below it\u2019s an easy out and a paper cut.\u201d\n\nLooking at Pentoshi\u2019s chart, he appears to be referring to support around $1,480. At time of writing, Ethereum is worth $1,576.\n\nFellow analyst Smart Contracter is also bearish on Ethereum. According to the crypto trader, Ethereum has taken out the diagonal support of a bearish continuation pattern.\n\n\u201cBear flag structure breaking down on ETH.\u201d\n\nLooking at the analyst\u2019s chart, he appears to be predicting a move down for Ethereum toward the $1,480 price level.\n\nAs for Bitcoin (BTC), Pentoshi believes that the king crypto is not yet done correcting. According to the crypto strategist, he sees BTC going all the way down to $21,500 before bulls could mount a small bounce.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to see this and would be wanting to play it for a bounce.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $22,490.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "New Date For Ethereum (ETH) Shapella Upgrade, Orbeon Protocol - CoinGape",
        "content": "It has been a busy week in the world of cryptocurrencies, with news on the Ethereum (ETH) Shapella upgrade, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) entering the ninth stage of the presale with a new price for tokens of $0.0835 and Bitcoin (BTC) showing continued volatility in the market. Let\u2019s take a moment to look at each of these events in turn.\n\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is a digital currency that operates on a decentralized, peer-to-peer network without the need for intermediaries like banks or governments. Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin (BTC) has become one of the most talked-about and controversial financial innovations of the past decade.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) continues to move higher year-on-year, but the Bitcoin (BTC) market remains volatile due to a variety of factors. Investors should be aware that large price swings are possible at any time and exercise caution when investing in Bitcoin (BTC).\n\n2021 saw Bitcoin (BTC) reach all-time highs of above $68,000, but since then, Bitcoin (BTC) has plummeted to recent lows just above $22,000. The good news for Bitcoin (BTC) holders is that the currency seems to be finding its footing above $23,000 and making a push higher.\n\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second most widely used cryptocurrency in the world, is preparing to launch its highly anticipated Shapella upgrade. This upgrade is anticipated to significantly enhance the performance of Ethereum (ETH), providing users with an improved experience.\n\nShapella is the term used to describe a dual Ethereum (ETH) upgrade consisting of two distinct updates, namely \u201cShanghai\u201d and \u201cCapella.\u201d These updates are designed to enhance the performance of the Ethereum (ETH) network by improving both the consensus layer of the Beacon Chain and the execution layer\u2019s ability to facilitate Ethereum (ETH) withdrawals.\n\nWhen the Ethereum (ETH) Shapella upgrade goes live, Ethereum (ETH) validators will be able to withdraw their staked rewards for validating transactions on the new proof-of-stake network. This is encouraging news for Ethereum (ETH) holders, and it is just another step towards a more efficient, secure and reliable Ethereum (ETH) network.\n\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\n\nOrbeon Protocol (ORBN)\n\nOrbeon Protocol (ORBN) takes a decentralized approach to crowdfunding by leveraging the power of blockchain technology to create a more transparent and secure fundraising process. This use of blockchain technology allows Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) to replace traditional shares with equity-backed NFTs that can be broken into smaller pieces.\n\nOrbeon Protocol (ORBN) opens up the world of fundraising to any investor, regardless of their financial background. In fact, just $1 USD can buy you an NFT on Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) \u2013 allowing anyone to become exposed to unicorn startups around the world.\n\nSmart contracts are another essential part of Orbeon Protocol (ORBN). They provide a secure and automated layer of trust between investors and entrepreneurs, allowing for an easier and more efficient process. Solid Proof, a third-party auditing company, audits all Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) smart contracts to ensure the trustworthiness of transactions.\n\nBut what role does the ORBN token play within this process? The ORBN token is the native currency of Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) and acts as a utility token, allowing individuals to access various elements of the network.\n\nWith this being one of the final Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) presale stages, sidelined investors don\u2019t have long to grab ORBN tokens for cheaper prices, especially with a 50% discount bonus for tokens currently. The release of ORBN onto exchanges later this year will likely cause the tokens to surge in price, estimated to be a 6000% increase in returns with a price of $0.24, so those who purchase now can be in for a treat.\n\nFind Out More About The Orbeon Protocol Presale\n\nWebsite: https://orbeonprotocol.com/\n\nPresale: https://presale.orbeonprotocol.com/register"

        "title": "What Is a Sovereign Rollup? Rollkit Pitches Second Layer for Bitcoin - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Just a few months after the very first NFT was inscribed into Bitcoin, developers are trying to imbue the age-old blockchain with another new-age technology: rollups.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what Rollkit\u2014a self-described \u201cmodular framework for rollups\u201d\u2014claimed over Twitter on Sunday, revealing a research integration that would allow \u201csovereign rollups\u201d on Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to Rollkit, its new rollup solution lets users produce rollups by retrieving and storing data on the Bitcoin blockchain. It was inspired by Ordinals, the Bitcoin NFT protocol which showed developers that\u2014using Taproot\u2014users could post arbitrary data to the blockchain.\n\nHow did we do it? \ud83d\udca1 Ordinals showed us it was possible to publish arbitrary data to Bitcoin. We saw this and decided to follow a similar process. At its core, all that was needed was two functions: one to submit rollup blocks, and another to retrieve them. pic.twitter.com/u6etICUAtg \u2014 Rollkit (@RollkitDev) March 5, 2023\n\nIn the traditional sense, rollups are batches of transactions that are \u201crolled up\u201d off chain into one transaction, and then posted to Ethereum as a single on-chain transaction. This helps free up blockspace and lower transaction costs on the network, while still inheriting the settlement assurances of the base chain.\n\nA sovereign rollup is one that does not need a smart contract or use a settlement layer for validation\u2014scalable and secure and with the \"sovereignty\" of a layer 1.\n\nHowever, some proponents of Ethereum, a network known to use layer-2 \u201crollups\u201d as a transaction scaling solution, have taken issue with Rollkit\u2019s use of the term.\n\nRyan Berckmans, a Web3 and Ethereum investor, said on Twitter that the sovereign rollup \u201cis actually an alt L1 that stores its block data on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nAccording to Alexei Zamyatin, founder of the Bitcoin DeFi protocol Interlay, sovereign rollups as proposed by Rollkit inherit \u201cnothing\u201d of Bitcoin\u2019s security.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cData availability\u2014okay, but honestly, that's been used since 2012,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe entire post describes 'I write some data to Bitcoin' with fancy buzzwords.\u201d\n\nRollkit is still bullish on the possibilities.\n\n\u201cThis new integration expands the possibilities for rollups, and also has the potential to help bootstrap a healthy blockspace fee market on Bitcoin, enabling a more sustainable security budget,\u201d the company writes.\n\nSome are likening sovereign rollups to Stacks, a high functionality layer 1 protocol that settles its blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain for security purposes. Stacks co-founder Muneeb Ali said on Twitter that this is an apt comparison, but noted some key differences.\n\nOn one hand, it takes 150 Stacks blocks before a transaction reaches\u201dBitcoin finality\u201d on Stacks, but only 1 with sovereign rollups. On the other, Stacks blocks publish their data to Bitcoin in an efficient manner by merely hashing the data on-chain, whereas sovereign rollups publishes the full data.\n\n\u201cThe technically challenging part for both the Stacks layer and sovereign rollups is moving BTC in and out of the layer, said Ali. \u201cThe decentralized BTC peg is the most important part.\u201d"

        "content": "Per recent updates, the ETH Denver event is in progress with even more announcements and features being released to the crypto community.\n\nERC-4337 launched\n\nEthereum has for years supported three different iterations of smart contracts, that is, ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155. However, at this year\u2019s ETH Denver, a new class of ERC-20 tokens was launched, ERC-4337.\n\nReports suggest that ERC-4337 aims to bring a new solution of providing investors with accounts that can be easily managed, offering bank-like features. It is reported that this standard would allow investors to set limits for their accounts, just like in banks.\n\nProponents claim this standard will make crypto more user-friendly, promoting faster adoption as people can now use standard passwords and simple two-factor authentication. With ERC-4337, investors will no longer need to write down long seed phrases.\n\nEthereum Foundation security researcher Yoav Weiss said the standard will be revolutionary since \u201cthe next billion users are not going to write 12 words on a piece of paper.\u201d He also highlighted that better usability is critical to cryptographic keys.\n\nWhat else happened?\n\nThe launch of ERC-4337 was one of the many standout events at ETH Denver. Many discourses and panel discussions explored the crypto landscape.\n\nFor instance, Robert Habermeier, Polkadot\u2019s founder, took centerstage at ETH Denver, discussing various aspects of technology, tooling, and scaling for an hour.\n\nCult DAO has also played a significant role in making ETH Denver successful, presenting a small presentation. There have been lots of mentions of CULT DAO\u2019s presence.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/iamcomingundone/status/1632016243921395713\n\nPolygon, another popular crypto network, also participated in the ETH Denver. Polygon\u2019s presentation was done on Mar. 4, where they discussed their Polygon ID. Another layer-2 scaling solution, Arbitrum, made an appearance. Its CTO and co-founder, Harry Kalodner, discussed the latest developments in the layer-2 realm.\n\nThere was also a panel discussion between crypto influencers, including David Palmer, Victor Rortvedt, and Aaron Wright.\n\nThe theme was \u201cInvestment DAOs in Adolescence \u2013 Lessons from the Early Days of a New Form of Human Coordination Panel.\u201d They looked into the possibility of a new organizational form for DAO.\n\nPerhaps to lighten the mood, a toilet paper with Sam Bankman Fried\u2019s face was seen in the washrooms.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Digital asset investment firms poured $2.7 billion into decentralized finance projects in 2022, up 190% from 2021, while investments into centralized finance projects went the other way \u2014 falling 73% to $4.3 billion over the same timeframe.\n\nThe staggering rise in DeFi funding was despite overall crypto funding figures falling from $31.92 billion in 2021 to $18.25 billion in 2022 as the market shifted from bull to bear.\n\nAccording to a March 1 report from CoinGecko, citing data from DefiLlama, the figures \u201cpotentially points to DeFi as the new high growth area for the crypto industry.\u201d The report says that the decrease in funding toward CeFi could point to the sector \u201creaching a degree of saturation.\u201d\n\nFunding amount by sector in the cryptocurrency market between 2018-2022. Source: CoinGecko\n\nThe near three-fold increase in DeFi investment is also a staggering 65-fold increase from 2020, at the start of the last bull run.\n\nAccording to CoinGecko, the largest DeFi funding in 2022 came from Luna Foundation Guard\u2019s (LFG) $1 billion sale of LUNA tokens in February 2022, which came about three months before the catastrophic collapse of Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) and TerraClassicUSD (USTC) in May.\n\nEthereum-native decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap and Ethereum staking protocol Lido Finance raised $164 million and $94 million, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, FTX and FTX US were the largest recipients of CeFi funding, having raised $800 million in January \u2014 accounting for 18.6% of CeFi funding in 2022 alone. The crypto exchanges, however, collapsed only 10 months later and filed for bankruptcy.\n\nOther areas of investments included blockchain infrastructure and blockchain technology companies, which raised $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, a trend that has remained strong over the last five years, said CoinGecko.\n\nHenrik Andersson, the chief investment officer of Australia-based asset fund manager Apollo Crypto, says his firm is looking at four specific sectors within crypto as of late:\n\nThe first is \u201cNFTfi,\u201d which he said results from the combination of DeFi and NFTs.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nLast year was one of the most chaotic for the broader crypto industry.\n\nAfter FTX\u2019s collapse, thousands of employees were laid off, and many firms, especially those in the mining sector, shut shop entirely.\n\nAfter layoffs and bankruptcies, cryptocurrencies were also hit hard. The industry's market cap plummeted from roughly $2.23 trillion at the start of 2022 to just $832 million at the start of 2023, starting in earnest from June onwards and intensifying following the implosion of FTX, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStill, software industry insiders claim there's never been more demand for blockchain developers.\n\nDemand for blockchain programming skills increased by 552% in 2022, as per a report by DevSkiller, compiling over 200,000 skills assessments. Tech firms can use these assessments as part of their hiring process to vet a developer\u2019s proficiency.\n\nWith asset prices down and crypto firms tightening their belts, why the jump in developer demand?\n\nBlockchain beyond tokens\n\nDevSkiller CTO Tomasz Nurkiewicz told Decrypt that much of this demand likely stems from non-crypto companies looking to scoop up developers with industry experience.\n\nHe said that firms could be \u201ctaking advantage of blockchain for different reasons, not necessarily just for cryptocurrencies, but for storage or for having a decentralized proof of something within their own companies.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe idea of decentralized storage and databases has already attracted some serious shows of faith. In September, Microsoft\u2019s venture capital fund M12 invested $20 million into Space and Time, a startup that aims to build a decentralized data warehouse with SQL-like database capabilities.\n\nThe firm says its cryptographic protocol, dubbed \u201cproof-of-SQL,\u201d will allow blockchain applications to perform analytics faster.\n\nFinance firms looking to build their own blockchains could be another key driver of demand for developers, according to BlockApps president and CEO Kieren James-Lubin. This may be due to some private financial markets which are, in his words, \u201cilliquid and weird.\u201d\n\nSeveral of the mainstays of traditional finance, including Blackrock, have made bold statements supporting tokenization, essentially bringing stocks, bonds, and other traditional financial assets onto a blockchain network.\n\nMoves like this could mean hiring more developers with blockchain experience.\n\nMathew McDermott, Goldman\u2019s Head of Digital Assets, echoed this sentiment in an interview with CNBC, saying that one of his key focuses for 2023 was on tokenization and \u201cdigitalizing the lifecycle.\u201d\n\nPeer-to-peer gaming has been another growth area in the past few years, and firms in this niche will likely keep hiring blockchain devs, according to Nurkiewicz.\n\nHe said, \u201cthe field is still gaining popularity despite the issues with crypto markets and crypto exchanges.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA report by DappRadar and the Blockchain Game Alliance (BGA) found that Web3 Gaming and metaverse projects raised $7.6 billion in 2022, a 59% rise since the year before.\n\nThat same year, blockchain gaming accounted for almost 50% of the on-chain activity.\n\nMore than just speculation\n\nMore broadly, James-Lubin from BlockApps said job opportunities will gradually move away from \u201cspeculative\u201d use cases.\n\n\u201cFrom a credit perspective, we\u2019re seeing a flight from really speculative use cases,\u201d explained James-Lubin. \u201cOne of the effects of the current market sentiment and of high-interest rates is that interest in more speculative returns farther in the future just collapses.\u201d\n\nHe said that investors are also much more cautious following the November meltdown of FTX and will generally want to invest in real-world use cases, as opposed to crypto-native opportunities.\n\n\u201cIt's a good or bad thing, depending on your perspective,\u201d said James-Lubin. \u201cAll of tech suddenly now has to think about profitability in a way that hasn't been the case in the last almost decade or so.\u201d\n\nDue to trends like this, future demand for blockchain developers won\u2019t necessarily correlate neatly with crypto prices.\n\n\u201cCrypto companies will hopefully learn to do sensible financial planning, in which the asset prices are less directly affecting their ability to employ people, such as keeping some of their funds in fiat currency,\u201d explained James-Lubin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStill, Nurkiewicz had reservations that some investors might not understand the difference between \u201cthe technology and the market,\u201d and be put off blockchain projects anyway.\n\n\u201cWe might see some kind of psychological moves here, which are not entirely justifiable by the underlying tech,\u201d Nurkiewicz explained.\n\nWhat's a dev to learn?\n\nAccording to both Nurkiewicz and James-Lubin, they are seeing a large increase in demand for people with experience using the programming languages Solidity and Aetherium, as well as people who have experience using supporting tools within the Ethereum development environment such as Hard Hat.\n\nThough both execs told Decrypt that it\u2019s a great time to be starting out as a blockchain developer, Nurkiewicz thinks that aspiring developers should try to get a strong traditional computer science background alongside any blockchain skills.\n\nThis could include demonstrating practical knowledge of key aspects of blockchain infrastructure. This could be having examples of smart contracts that they can display on their GitHub page, or understanding how Merkle trees work.\n\nIn terms of pay developers can expect, DevSkiller reports that the average salary for blockchain-focused devs worldwide was around $79,983. This figure ballooned to $177,500 for those based in the U.S., making it one of the best-compensated specialties among developers.\n\nThough demand for blockchain skills exploded in 2022, the overall demand for these skills pales in significance to the old guard of programming languages such as JavaScript, Java, SQL, and Python.\n\nAccording to the 2022 Stack Overflow Survey, Solidity was only in use by 1.45% of developers, compared to over 65% using JavaScript or 55% using HTML.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAdditionally, blockchain development is still niche. Out of all the areas surveyed, only 2.5% of those surveyed described themselves as pure-play blockchain developers.\n\nBeing a \u201cblockchain developer\u201d isn\u2019t nearly as synonymous with being an employee at a crypto firm as in 2017. Opportunities are also cropping up in lucrative fields like traditional finance and gaming.\n\nAs a result, blockchain development could be a great career path regardless of market sentiment, says James-Lubin.\n\nBut even if crypto-related jobs dislocate from the price of Bitcoin, he said it\u2019s foolish for young people to base their entire careers on what's \u201chot right now.\u201d\n\nInstead, the CEO said people should focus on their true interest as trends, be it blockchain, AI, or delivery apps, come and go."

Photo: Toru Hanai/Reuters\n\nBitcoin experienced a 5% drop in the past week as traders speculate that upcoming creditor payouts from the bankrupt MT Gox exchange could impact the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe civil rehabilitation trial surrounding the Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange has concluded and payouts to creditors are scheduled to begin this Friday, March 10.\n\nHowever, there are fears that the 142,000 bitcoin to be released to creditors could be dumped on the market as soon as they become available.\n\nRead more: How a bitcoin court case in Japan may create crypto millionaires\n\nThe magnitude of a possible $3bn bitcoin payout has led crypto-analysts to warn of a possible market shock where recipients dump their newly acquired bitcoin en masse after taking back ownership of their coins.\n\nThe amounts to be dispensed are 142,000 BTC (BTC-USD), 143,000 bitcoin cash (BCH-USD), and 69 billion Japanese yen (JPY=X).\n\nHowever, the total amount of assets to be paid out to creditors after the 2014 hack of the MT Gox exchange will not be released to creditors immediately, but at stages over the coming months.\n\nAny resulting increase in bitcoin supply could drive prices lower at a time when the market is already facing stern headwinds from the recent problems at Silvergate bank, and the upcoming Shanghai upgrade of the Ethereum network (ETH-USD).\n\nStock in the crypto-friendly Silvergate bank (SI) is down 95% over the past year, and it is facing US regulatory probes due to the collapse of significant clients such as FTX and related hedge fund Alameda Research.\n\nEthereum's Shanghai upgrade will allow those who have 'staked' their ether to withdraw it, giving them the option to sell on the market again. Staking is the process of locking ether on the blockchain for a set amount of time to validate the network.\n\nRead more: Crypto live prices\n\nThe MT Gox creditors have waited nearly a decade to get a portion of their money back after hackers stole 850,000 bitcoin from the MT Gox exchange in 2014.\n\nOnly a portion of the total amount of stolen bitcoin has been retrieved, resulting in a pay-out of only 21% of each creditor's original claim.\n\nWith headwinds increasing, both bitcoin and ether are starting the week off flat, with the world\u2019s largest digital asset at $22,416, and ether at $1,569.\n\nWatch: 'Bitcoin will eat into global finance until it's $1m per coin' | The Crypto Mile"

        "title": "Big Eyes Coin, Bitcoin and Ethereum Capitalising On the Momentum from January - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The year 2022 was nothing short of a catastrophic year for digital assets, with the crypto world caught up in the chaos of one of the industry\u2019s largest scams. One of the biggest crypto exchanges FTX was a two-week nightmare that experts and analysts predicted will damage and have a long-term effect on crypto users around the world. Albeit, as we just start the month of March, crypto investors may be able to breathe a sigh of relief. Because since January a few coins have been experiencing a bullish-like trend, which crypto enthusiasts hope will continue.\n\nAs crypto users want to invest in the market\u2019s more established digital assets, a \u2018big-eyed\u2019 feline is purring away and grabbing the attention of investors. Because of its enticing features and advantages for investors, Big Eyes Coin (BIG) is becoming more and more well-known.\n\nNonetheless, several well-known cryptocurrencies had a difficult 2022 as a result of the collapse of the FTX exchange. In this challenging time, new cryptocurrencies like Big Eyes Coin saw great improvements.\n\nMake BIG Returns with Big Eyes Coin Loot Boxes\n\nA meme coin project called Big Eyes Coin (BIG) seeks to bolster the crypto market by bringing wealth and more users. It is a cat meme coin that aims to become accepted on the Ethereum blockchain and offer more benefits to its community. Big Eyes Coin is a DeFi solution that promises to combine exchanges, liquidity pool purchases, staking, and other features like NFTs and the metaverse. Since the start of its presale, the meme coin has raised a sizable sum of money and has already gained widespread attention.\n\nLoot boxes will be available for the Big Eyes Coin community. Several adventure-style video games feature mystery boxes called loot boxes. These may be used to unlock new in-game goods, weapons, or clothes. They come randomly when playing a game.\n\nA fortunate member of the BIG community might win up to $100,000 in tokens from one of the three available loot boxes, which are all filled with $HUGE tokens. Today a fourth box has been launched called the \u201cExcali-Paw Master Chest\u201d worth $9,999 and will have rewards ranging from $10k to $1,000,000.\n\nBitcoin \u2013 Where It All Began\n\nAfter running a mining network for almost two years, Satoshi Nakamoto established the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain in 2009. The coin\u2019s introduction as a proof-of-work currency ushered in a new era of decentralised finance in which crypto tokens will dominate a sizable portion of the world financial market.\n\nBefore being made accessible for trading and exchanging, Bitcoin (BTC) was once a token that users had to mine. As users held power over the token\u2019s future, the mining was compatible with its decentralisation aims. Specialised graphics processing units like ASICs can still mine Bitcoin, even though doing so on mobile devices is no longer cost-effective. This has drastically restricted mining to large companies.\n\nBTC relied on scarcity rather than the qualities of the protocol to climb the cryptocurrency rankings. Its main contribution to DeFi was the development of private, secure blockchain technology, which increased user security and promoted the transfer of assets throughout the world.\n\nBlockchains also record each transaction that users make. Only for security reasons may the data be obtained; they cannot be used to identify somebody. Public keys are generated for each transaction, and each user has a private key. For tracing transactions on the blockchain, the public keys operate as reference points.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Making good market performance has become more challenging for cryptocurrencies than ever. Hence, TRON (TRX) and Solana (SOL) have faced many roadblocks in their run. On the other hand, the demand for TMS Network (TMSN) presale has skyrocketed. TMS Network (TMSN) has posted a growth rate of 700% during its presale\u2019s first stage.\n\nTRON (TRX) Processes Most Transactions Per Second\n\nA recent tweet by the TRON community claimed that the TPS (transactions per second) of TRON (TRX) is more than that of Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Ripple. As per the tweet, the TPS of TRON (TRX) is 88.20, while it is just 11.96 for Ethereum and 3.43 for Bitcoin. This has also caused a spike in the number of transactions on the TRON (TRX) network. Analysts believe that if the activities continue to increase, the number of activated addresses on the TRON (TRX) network can surpass 2 million. Meanwhile, TRON\u2019s (TRX) value has declined by 5% in the last seven days. However, the price of TRON (TRX) has increased by 3.44% on the monthly chart. Currently, TRON (TRX) trades at $0.0667, which is 78% below its all-time high of $0.30.\n\nNetwork Outage Dents Solana\u2019s (SOL) Image\n\nAfter suffering a network outage for the 10th time, Solana (SOL) has announced upgrading its software update processes. Recently, Solana (SOL) suffered a massive downtime that affected all transactions on the network. Solana (SOL) also faced severe criticism for this outage. Some experts called the Solana (SOL) network unstable and questioned its maintainability. Responding to all these concerns, Solana (SOL) has assured that it would improve its network to avoid any further downtime. After the network outage, Solana (SOL) witnessed a fall in its price. The market value of Solana (SOL) has fallen by 12% in the last seven days. Consequently, the trading price of Solana (SOL) has come down to $21.10, which is 92% below its peak of $260.06.\n\nTMS Network (TMSN) Records Gigantic Growth Of 700%\n\nTMS Network (TMSN) is a comprehensive trading platform that has successfully raised over $500k during the first stage of its presale. TMS Network (TMSN) facilitates the trading of various digital assets using cryptos as payment. TMS Network (TMSN) allows the trading of digital assets without opening an account.

The network authorizes the trading of any asset class, including stocks, cryptocurrencies, futures, forex, and more. This unique trait maintains sufficient liquidity on TMS Network (TMSN), helping traders complete their transactions quickly.\n\nTMS Network (TMSN) is known for offering transparency and security in all trade-related activities. The platform has put smart contracts in place to oversee all trading activities, and all proceedings on the network are automatically recorded on a public ledger. The network assists traders in investing in a broad range of digital assets at a lower cost. The essential feature of TMS Network (TMSN) is its scalability.

        "title": "Ethereum can help enterprises in achieving transparency - Premium Times",
        "content": "Business chain relationships in the finance and tech industry are genuinely global in reach and complexity. Supply chains are often dangerously opaque, with a lack of transparency leading to adverse environmental and societal effects. Therefore, enterprises actively seek decentralized solutions for tracking goods across value chains to achieve transparent supply chain management. Anyone can trade Ethereum on a trusted platform like ethereum code\n\nEthereum is a public blockchain that has high levels of scalability and privacy. Furthermore, because it can transfer value without relying on a trusted entity, Ethereum will provide an efficient solution for achieving transparency in business chains through Smart Contracts.\n\nSmart contracts- The key to businesses:\n\nThe Smart Contract can act as a digital platform between counterparties to collaborate and develop supply chain relationships across borders autonomously through intelligent contracts utilizing Ethereum technology. Consumers, companies, and financial institutions have all sought to connect around the globe to increase efficiencies. The rise of the internet has enabled this global connectivity; however, this connectivity isn\u2019t based on trust alone. Therefore, enterprises need to maintain trust through transparent communication of their products and services.\n\nIt is where Ethereum comes into play; it provides a foundation for transparent communication between counterparties and third-party auditing services. The results from these audits can then be used as information by enterprises or consumers in furthering trade and developing business chains. As a result, Ethereum has a wide range of applications ranging from financial services to supply chains; the list goes on.\n\nThese DAOs can manage and automate numerous types of workflows and businesses. The price for Ethereum has risen dramatically over the past year, which is incredibly encouraging for its continued growth. This rise also shows that enterprises increasingly recognize its potential as a business-driven protocol in many different industries, not just as an investment asset or an efficient alternative to Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum can help enterprises in the following way:\n\n1. Ethereum can help track products:\n\nManaging a supply chain (whether it\u2019s products or services) can be extremely hard, time-consuming, and costly. The challenging logistics of the supply chain make it difficult to track the products as they move from one location to another. Most importantly, a lack of transparency can lead to the illegal trade in products and services banned in many countries. Ethereum\u2019s business use cases can include many industries, such as food supplies, pharmaceuticals, equipment, etc.\n\n2. Ethereum can help enterprises in achieving transparency:\n\nEnterprises increasingly seek decentralized solutions for tracking goods across value chains to achieve transparent business chain management. The use cases of Ethereum technology may include tracking products across different locations and countries to ensure that compliance standards are maintained.\n\nMany supply chain-related activities require trust collaboration, such as the exchange of information or the review process of a product to get it authorized for legal use. For example, the drug is checked for authenticity and compliance with FDA regulations in the pharmaceutical supply chain. Furthermore, healthcare centers must comply with local regulatory requirements of their geographical area if we consider healthcare industries. In addition, the product should be safe and capable enough to serve its intended purpose effectively. Ethereum can help in these cases by providing a trusted and transparent platform for healthcare information and its products.\n\n3. Multi-Signature and Corruptible Contract Security Mechanism:\n\nEthereum is a public blockchain that works in a decentralized manner. There are no central authorities managing transactions, and each user holds the private keys of their accounts. The multi-Signature feature involves three parties: buyer, seller, and escrow agent.\n\nThe protocol is designed so that it involves an escrow agent, ensuring that any transaction between two parties remains clear and transparent to both parties. So, if there\u2019s any dispute between two or more parties involved in the transaction, then they can take it up with the escrow agent who can act as an arbitrator. Ethereum\u2019s triple transactions feature will reduce the chances of fraud and increase the trust among parties.\n\nEthereum is a perfect technology for the business chain industry. However, smart contracts in the value chain industry will only work if they can achieve transparency, speed, and cost-efficiency. People can use Ethereum to achieve those goals in several aspects of the value chain, such as logistics financing and contract terms verification through intelligent contracts. Once these intelligent contracts have been developed, they can be used extensively by enterprises online and offline. However, the financial industry can be tricky, with many overlapping regulations and standards across countries.\n\nTamper-resistant documentation:\n\nEnterprises can use the trustless properties of blockchain to reduce the chances of fraud. For example, if all parties access the same information in real-time, they can verify each transaction. In addition, Ethereum enables intelligent contracts to be shared across different parties without any chance of tampering or manipulation. For example, supply chain transactions likely include just a few parties and no intermediaries.\n\nEthereum will help ensure that all parties have real-time access to the same information. So, if there\u2019s any dispute between two or more parties involved in the transaction, then they can take it up with the escrow agent who can act as an arbitrator.\n\nProviding value to customers:\n\nCustomers want their products delivered fast, efficiently, and accurately. They want to avoid entering into a contract with one value chain member only to find numerous intermediaries involved during the delivery process.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nWhatsApp\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

        "content": "The price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been struggling recently, much like the general market, which has been impacted by various macroeconomic factors and increased regulatory uncertainty. However, the price movement has partly sparked investor interest in accumulating the meme coin, as exhibited by Ethereum (ETH) whales.\n\nIn this regard, Shiba Inu has emerged as the top cryptocurrency held by the top 100 Ethereum whales at 12%, with a value of $601.2 million worth of SHIB, according to data shared by WhaleStats on March 5.\n\nSHIB accounts for the top spot excluding stablecoins USDC and USDT, which have a share of 16% and 14%, respectively, among Ethereum whales.\n\nTop Ethereum whale holding. Source: WhaleStats\n\nThe latest development comes after previous data by WhaleStats on March 3 indicated that SHIB had flipped Chainlink (LINK) for the most traded token among the top 100 Ethereum whales.\n\nOther top cryptocurrencies held by ETH whales include Bitpanda Ecosystem Token (BEST) at $155.9 million, Polygon (MATIC) at $150.2 million, SwissBorg (CHSB) at $131.7 million, Chainlink at $130.9 million, Uniswap (UNI) at $72.7 million, Locus Chain (LOCUS) at $70.1 million, and Decentraland (MANA) at $63.3 million.\n\nImplication of SHIB ranking among Ethereum whales\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s ability to emerge on top among the Ethereum whales has potentially renewed investor interest, which could impact SHIB\u2019s price, which has been dominated by bearishness.\n\nThe meme coin now finds itself in a distinctive position, with the potential to reap the rewards of the heightened trading volume. However, it also implies that any abrupt decline in volume could harm the coin\u2019s price.\n\nMoreover, the development complements other Shiba Inu on-chain activities, specifically the upcoming launch of Shibarium, a layer-2 scaling solution that the Shiba Inu community eagerly anticipates. While there is no official release date yet, Shibarium is highly anticipated for the enhancements it will provide to the network.\n\nShiba Inu price analysis\n\nBy press time, SHIB was trading at $0.000011, with daily losses of almost 1%. On the weekly chart, Shiba Inu is down about 10%.\n\nSHIB seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nOn the other hand, SHIB\u2019s technical analysis on TradingView is mainly bearish. The summary of the one-day gauges aligns with \u2018sell\u2019 at 12. Moving average sites are recommending the \u2018strong sell\u2019 sentiment at 11. Oscillators are for \u2018buy\u2019 at 3.\n\nSHIB technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nMeanwhile, regarding SHIB\u2019s price projection, machine learning algorithms at CoinCodex indicate that SHIB is likely to experience bearish sentiments towards the end of the year. As per the projection, the token might trade at $0.00000361 on December 30, 2023.\n\nWith SHIB still lacking significant use cases, the token heavily relies on the adoption and success of network development. At the same time, the token will depend on the general market sentiment. Moreover, based on historical price movements, SHIB has the potential to reclaim previous highs that ushered in a new crop of crypto millionaires.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Scroll, a Layer 2 Ethereum network utilizing zk-rollups technology, has announced that it raised $50 million in its most recent funding round. Participants included Polychain Capital, Sequoia China, Bain Capital Crypto, Moore Capital Management, Variant Fund, Newman Capital, IOSG Ventures, and Qiming Venture Partners. According to a source with direct knowledge of the matter, this brings Scroll\u2019s total valuation to an estimated $1.8 billion. The company has raised $83 million in funding, following two earlier rounds that had not yet disclosed their respective valuations.\n\nHow Scroll uses zk-rollup technology to increase Ethereum scalability\n\nFounded in 2021, Scroll aims to bring Ethereum to a billion users. As a Layer 2 network, it works by processing transactions off-chain and then porting them back to Ethereum, thus increasing transaction speed and reducing costs. Scroll looks to revolutionize how people interact with blockchain technology through this innovative approach.\n\nScroll\u2019s zk-rollup technology enables scalability on its network. Recently, Scroll launched its zero-knowledge Ethereum virtual machine (zkEVM) on the Goerli testnet, marking a move out of the pre-alpha testing phase. According to co-founder Sandy Peng in an interview, traction on the pre-alpha testnet was strong, with one million unique addresses and 16 million transactions. The mainnet launch is estimated to be within the next three to four months.\n\nScroll is one of several Ethereum scaling networks that use zk-rollups, such as Polygon, StarkWare, and Matter Labs. According to Peng, Scroll\u2019s competitive edge lies in its three core values: community-driven, security first, and decentralization at every level. With the recently acquired capital, Scroll aims to continue developing its product, launch its mainnet and grow its ecosystem. Additionally, Scroll intends to expand its current team of 60 to nearly 100 soon."
