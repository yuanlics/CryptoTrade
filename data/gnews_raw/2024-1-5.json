        "content": "What Are Ethereum Layer 2 Blockchains and How Do They Work?\n\nBy Lipsa Das\n\nBeginner\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: \u2014 As the pioneering smart contract chain, Ethereum has become the second-largest blockchain network.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Due to the network\u2019s prioritization of decentralization and security over scalability, its increased popularity has led to major network congestion.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Ethereum Layer 2 solutions are blockchains built with one primary purpose: to provide a faster, cheaper route to executing Ethereum transactions.\n\nEthereum\u2019s ecosystem has grown significantly in the last decade \u2014 with a surge of decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and NFTs. While this activity brings us closer to the ultimate goal of Web3 mass adoption, the question remains: is the underlying technology equipped to handle it all?\n\nIn Ethereum\u2019s case, this growth has brought key scalability issues to the forefront; namely, high transaction fees (gas fees), network congestion, and slow transaction times during periods of high network activity. While core upgrades like the Merge aim to make transactions faster, Ethereum still needs a scaling solution built to handle the masses.\n\nEnter Layer 2 solutions: blockchains that increase scalability by sharing the burden of transaction processing. In this article, you\u2019ll learn about the different types of Ethereum Layer 2 blockchains, how they help solve the scalability issue, and which are the most popular ones. Let\u2019s get started.\n\nEthereum Layer 2s Explained\n\nBuilt on top of Ethereum, Layer 2 blockchains help speed up transaction processing while keeping the costs down for the L1 network. They do the heavy lifting of transactions that Ethereum cannot, simply because it wasn\u2019t designed to prioritize speed.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is the second most popular blockchain network by market share, conceptualized by Vitalik Buterin in 2013, and launched two years later. Ethereum became popular due to its self-executing smart contracts.\n\nTo explain, smart contracts are essentially computer programs that execute automatically if certain conditions are met. This competent tech is what paved the way for dApps, and from there, Ethereum took off. From DeFi protocols to the NFT mania to the significant growth of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), the wide-ranging innovations from dApp developers have indicated a field of endless possibilities when it comes to potential crypto use cases. The network boasts the highest number of developers. In fact, 16% of all crypto developers are building on Ethereum.\n\nWhat is a Layer 2 blockchain network?\n\nA Layer 2 solution is a secondary blockchain network, which reduces the load on the parent chain by handling part of its capabilities.\n\nThink of Ethereum as a boss whose desk is overflowing with paperwork (validating & executing transactions). A Layer 2 blockchain is an efficient assistant who takes the bulk of the workload to their desk (L2 network) to process.\n\nHowever, the final approval still comes from the boss. So, the assistant sends the processed paperwork back to the boss, who adds it to the final ledger upon approval. In other words, when approved, the transactions processed on the L2 network are added to the main Ethereum blockchain.\n\nWhat are Ethereum Layer 2 blockchains for?\n\nEthereum developers, like all blockchain developers, faced an age-old challenge: the blockchain trilemma. The blockchain trilemma, coined by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, states that a blockchain architecture needs to choose between decentralization, security, and scalability. Ethereum prioritizes the former two aspects, so scalability inevitably took the backseat.\n\nHowever, compromising scalability comes with obvious drawbacks: slow and expensive transactions. Currently, Ethereum\u2019s transaction processing capability stands at a mere 15 to 30 TPS. To provide context, VISA processes around 1,700 transactions per second.\n\nMoreover, transaction finality, when a transaction is added to the blockchain and becomes irreversible, takes roughly 15 minutes on Ethereum. Furthermore, the network is often overwhelmed and congested during periods of high demand, which causes abrupt surges in gas fees.\n\nEthereum layer 2 networks are, therefore, designed to tackle these issues and offer cheaper, faster transactions. They inherit Ethereum\u2019s security and, by processing transactions of the parent chain, make the process more efficient.\n\nLayer 2 Solutions on Ethereum\n\nLayer 2 solutions mainly differ in how they reduce Ethereum\u2019s transaction load. The most common ones are sidechains and blockchain rollups.\n\nSidechains\n\nSidechains are independent blockchains with native tokens and consensus mechanisms whose purpose is to help scale the parent network. They connect to the parent blockchain using a two-way bridge that enables users to move assets to and from Ethereum.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s no real transfer of assets between the two chains. Sidechains use something called a two-way peg. A smart contract locks up assets on the main chain and mints a mirror image of the tokens on the sidechain. The value of these new assets is pegged to the assets on the original chain.\n\nLet\u2019s use the boss and assistant analogy once again. In this case, the boss (Ethereum) sets aside a bunch of the workload (locks the tokens). The assistant (sidechain) works with a copy of the workload (pegged assets) to execute transactions. Once done, the sidechain destroys its copies and unlocks the original tokens on Ethereum.\n\nBlockchain Rollups\n\nBlockchain rollups are layer 2 scaling solutions that \u201crollup\u201d or bundle a bunch of transactions and then send them to Ethereum as a single piece of data. This network then adds this to an Ethereum block and confirms it.\n\nUsing the earlier analogy, the assistant carries the paperwork (transactions) to their desk, processes them, and compresses a big pile of paperwork into a single file. The assistant then sends that file, instead of the whole pile, back to the boss (Ethereum). This way, the boss has to deal with a fraction of the paperwork, which occupies less space. Therefore, as a user, you pay less gas fees because your transaction is grouped with many others and occupies less data space on the block.\n\nThere are two different types of rollups: Optimistic rollups and zero-knowledge (zk) rollups. Optimistic rollups assume that all transactions bundled together are valid unless otherwise proven. Zk rollups, on the other hand, produce a single cryptographic proof called \u201cvalidity proof,\u201d which attests to the validity of the transactions bundled together.\n\nPopular Ethereum Layer 2s:\n\nOver the years, several Ethereum Layer 2 solutions have emerged \u2014 each prioritizing a specific audience, use case, or solution to Ethereum\u2019s scaling efforts. Here are some of the most popular Ethereum Layer 2 solutions in the industry today:\n\nPolygon\n\nPolygon is one of the most popular Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solutions. It is an independent Ethereum sidechain faster and cheaper than its parent blockchain. Theoretically, Polygon can process up to 7,200 TPS, although the TPS currently stands around 1,000. Then for each of these transactions, the average gas is $0.01. It also plans on improving its transaction finality. Established brands like Starbucks use the network for loyalty programs due to the above benefits.\n\nArbitrum\n\nLaunched by Offchain Labs, Arbitrum is an optimistic rollup that cuts down the speed and cost of transactions by bundling them and processing them off-chain. Arbitrum manages a total of 40,000 TPS, with transactions costing around two cents on average. Additionally, Arbitrum\u2019s compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs) helps Ethereum developers launch their dApps on Arbitrum without too many modifications to the code.\n\nBase\n\nLaunched in August 2023, Base was incubated within Coinbase and built using the MIT-licensed OP Stack developed by Optimism. Notably, the total value locked (TVL) on the network surpassed $300 million by November.\n\nBase subscribes to the vision of a \u2018super-chain\u2019, a collection of inter-connected blockchains built on the OP Stack, that will together scale Ethereum. Optimism and Base are the first two chains that will make up the super-chain.\n\nImmutableX\n\nImmutableX is a zk-rollup scaling solution focused on non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Web3 games. To that end, ImmutableX has built out software development kits (SDKs) and application programming interfaces (APIs) for game developers to simplify the tedious backend infrastructure.\n\nAlong with fast transactions, ImmutableX aims to offer gas-free, carbon-neutral NFT minting. It also claims to offer transaction speeds of up to 9,000 TPS.\n\nRonin\n\nRonin is an Ethereum sidechain launched by Sky Mavis, which created the popular NFT game Axie Infinity. It uses a proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus mechanism where Sky Mavis and the community select network validators based on expertise and reputation. The gaming-focused blockchain boasts \u201cnear-instant\u201d transactions with an average cost of less than half a cent.\n\nETH L2s: A new way to explore Ethereum\n\nFor Ethereum to become a global payment system, it must be accessible. Ethereum L2s are designed to do just that by solving the parent network\u2019s scalability challenges. Whether you want to play Web3 games, exchange tokens, mint NFTs, or trade ETH, L2s help you do it faster and cheaper.\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to dive deeper into Ethereum Layer 2 networks it doesn\u2019t need to be difficult. Through the Ledger ecosystem, you can access Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, and many other L2s.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Enjoy the confidence of self-custody as you explore what the world of Ethereum Layer 2s has to offer through Ledger Live. After all, what is the virtue of crypto without self-custody?"

        "title": "Ethereum Once Looked Unstoppable. But It's 1 Crypto I'm Avoiding in 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Heading into 2023, Ethereum (ETH 1.25%) looked unstoppable. Ethereum had just pulled off The Merge, which was often cited as one of the greatest technical accomplishments of 2022. As a result of The Merge, which made the entire network much less energy intensive, Ethereum appeared to be well positioned to continue its dominance in just about every meaningful niche of the blockchain world.\n\nHowever, since August 2022 -- one month before The Merge -- Ethereum is only up 10%, at a time when other cryptos posted stellar triple-digit returns in 2023. From my perspective, Ethereum suddenly looks very vulnerable, which is why it's one crypto I'm avoiding in 2024. Let's take a closer look.\n\nNew strategic roadmap\n\nEthereum just released its new strategic roadmap for 2024, and I'm not impressed. Even Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin acknowledges that there are only minor changes planned for the year ahead. The primary focus is on resolving some of the blockchain design problems that resulted from The Merge. Fair enough -- it's probably expecting too much from Ethereum to come up with a wildly new strategic roadmap after a breakthrough achievement like The Merge.\n\nHowever, what concerns me is that some of the initial grand strategic goals of The Merge keep getting scaled back. For example, at one time Ethereum promised a total throughput speed of 1 million transactions per second. That has now been scaled back to 100,000. And according to Ethereum's own strategic roadmap, that goal probably won't be achievable in its current stage of development. Meanwhile, rival blockchain Solana (SOL -1.55%) says it already has the ability to handle 65,000 transactions per second.\n\nOn top of all that, Buterin seems to be backing away from what he refers to as the \"financialization\" of Ethereum's blockchain. Simply put, this term means the mainstreaming of Ethereum's blockchain for Wall Street institutions, ensuring that the blockchain's architecture makes sense for the modern financial world. If you're a long-term investor, that's exactly what you want to see, because it would be huge for Ethereum's future growth prospects.\n\nHowever, Buterin now seems to be leaning into what he calls a \"cypherpunk\" (a mashup of \"cyberpunk\" and \"cipher\") approach to blockchain development to recapture some of the early mystique of crypto. Kudos to Buterin for staying true to his original vision for the blockchain. But as a cold-hearted investor, I find that somewhat worrisome. Are top Wall Street firms really going to partner with a bunch of cyberpunks?\n\nRise of new competitors\n\nBy itself, a less-than-compelling strategic roadmap would not be enough to get me off Ethereum. I mean, really, this is Ethereum we're talking about. This is a blockchain that has a strong track record dating back to 2015. Ethereum's Buterin has been featured on the cover of TIME magazine as \"the prince of crypto,\" and it's hard not to think of him as one of the brightest minds of our generation.\n\nHowever, take a step back and consider the overall competitive landscape. One of the primary reasons for investing in Ethereum has always been the fact that it is a best-in-class blockchain, with an obvious dominant market share in key blockchain niches. But now there are several very credible competitors all nipping at the heels of Ethereum. Right now, three of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap -- Solana, Avalanche (AVAX 0.19%), and Cardano (ADA -0.33%) -- are direct competitors to Ethereum.\n\nMoreover, all three of these competitors now appear to be growing faster than Ethereum, especially Solana. At the end of 2022, for example, Solana started to eclipse Ethereum in terms of NFT trading volume and decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume. And institutional investors really appear to be buying into the argument that Solana is a faster, more cost-efficient version of Ethereum. For example, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest recently appeared on CNBC, talking up the merits of Solana.\n\nHow can Ethereum get its mojo back?\n\nRight now, I'm not adding to my Ethereum position until it moves out of The Merge stage of development and into what the crypto's leaders have dubbed \"The Surge\" stage of development. To me, the remainder of The Merge stage is filled with a bunch of wonky technical improvements that aren't truly disruptive in nature. In contrast, The Surge is when Ethereum is supposed to hit that 100,000 transactions per second threshold. That's exciting, because even a world-class payment network like Visa, Inc. (V -0.34%) can't deliver that type of throughput.\n\nAt the same time, I'll be watching to see how well Ethereum preserves its market-leading position in key blockchain niches. If Ethereum can show that it is fending off rival blockchains such as Solana, then I will be much more inclined to restore my bullish outlook for Ethereum."

But the question is what takes precedence?\n\nAndrew Ashikhmin, software engineer on the Erigon client team, suggested that the EVM Object Format (EOF) would be one candidate to drive the next upgrade without distracting from longer-term work on Verkle Trees, because it could be implemented by a smaller team, and was a more isolated change to the code base.\n\n\u201cBut Verkle should be the main focus,\u201d he said.\n\nEOF was originally considered for the Shapella hard fork, but was considered too big to be paired as a \u201cpassenger\u201d alongside the main \u201cdriver,\u201d Proto-Dank sharding or EIP-4844.\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s Next Upgrade To Focus on Blobs\n\nEOF is \u201cdefinitely not a passenger\u201d according to Justin Florentine, protocol engineer on the Besu client team, but he said that Besu had already made \u201ca lot of progress\u201d on the feature, and therefore was in favor of its adoption in Pralectra\n\nGeorgios Konstantopoulos, chief technology officer and researcher at investment firm Paradigm, which is building the Rust Ethereum (Reth) client, said his team was \u201cOK [with] EOF as it\u2019s [a] one man job and [needs] isolated testing.\u201d\n\nBut Ethereum Foundation developer Marius van der Wijden shared the opinion that \u201cEOF is not going to be in the small fork.\u201d\n\nAnsgar Dietrichs at the Ethereum Foundation supported EOF for inclusion in Pralectra last April, and noted on Thursday\u2019s call that the Solidity team \u2014 maintaining the EVM\u2019s main smart contract programing language \u2014 was strongly in favor.\n\nNo one on the call was there to explicitly advocate for EOF, however, prompting Nethermind founder Tomasz Stanczak to remark, \u201dif nobody champions EOF on this call this would summarize why it has not been shipped yet.\u201d\n\nStanczak called EIP-7002 or \u201cExecution layer triggerable exits\u201d the most upvoted EIP in the Ethereum Magicians forum and \u201csuper important,\u201d because it fixes a \u201cmajor design bug with staking [and] cannot come early enough.\u201d\n\nFellow core developer Parithosh Jayanthi, known by the nickname \u201cPotuz\u201d said if he had to choose one feature to ship it would be EIP-7002. However, in his view, EIP-7549 \u201cshould definitely be in.\u201d\n\nThis feature, which only affects the consensus layer, fixes a bug in Ethereum\u2019s design and aims to reduce the average number of pairings needed to verify consensus rules. A pairing is an operation used in certain cryptographic algorithms involving elliptic curves.\n\nCurrently, to reach consensus it\u2019s necessary to verify a minimum of 1366 attestations \u2014 indicating agreement between validators \u2014 but after EIP-7549 it would be reduced to just 22.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s trivial to implement and it\u2019ll save a lot of aggregation time,\u201d Potus said. \u201cIt can help on trustless bridges \u2014 and zk-provers, zk-bridges \u2014 it\u2019s something that should definitely be in whatever fork we do next.\u201d\n\nThe goal of the call was to kickstart discussion, and the specific approach and improvement proposals will be decided at a later date. Ethereum upgrades are consensus-driven; there is no explicit hierarchy of authority, or voting mechanism to determine priorities.\n\nIt can at times appear challenging or chaotic to make progress, not unlike herding cats, but that\u2019s the nature of the decentralized beast.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

The exit queue has reportedly reached 16,000, according to data from ValidatorQueue. The queue represents more than 510,000 ether ($1.1 billion), with a maximum validator stake of 32 ether per validator.\n\nThe processing time for completing the exit queue will be five days, with a total withdrawal length of more than 14 days.\n\nThis comes as Celsius, going through restructuring after filing for bankruptcy protection last year, shared its plans to cancel its stake in the Ethereum network \u2014 intending to distribute assets to its creditors.\n\nCelsius\u2019 withdrawal request of more than 200,000 ETH ($450 million) has contributed to the heightened validator exit queue. However, it seems that Celsius is not alone. Nansen data shows that only 32% of exits belong to Celsius. 54% (350,000 ETH) of the validators waiting to be withdrawn are associated with staking provider Figment.\n\nTom Wan, an analyst at 21 Shares, thinks that those tagged as Figment may also belong to Celsius. \u201cIt is also likely that the withdrawal by Figment belongs to Celsius. Earlier in June, when Celsius redeemed 428k stETH from Lido, it re-staked 197k ETH via Figment,\u201d Wan said. Still, not all of Figment\u2019s withdrawals would account for Celsius, Nansen clarified.\n\nThere are currently a total of 29 million ETH staked on the network, according to The Block dashboard.

The blockchain has suffered a few outages, the most recent of which occurred in December.\n\nThese outages have been caused by problems with the blockchain\u2019s Sequencer \u2014 a part of the network used to verify, organise, and transfer transaction bundles to the Ethereum mainnet for finality.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nArbitrum\u2019s Sequencer is not the only one of its kind that suffered a temporary failure. ZkSync, another Ethereum layer 2, faced a similar problem last Christmas.\n\nApart from Arbitrum\u2019s recent gains, Ethereum\u2019s layer 2s have been experiencing a period of significant growth. At $20.7 billion, their combined TVL is greater than that of all other layer 1 networks, excluding Ethereum, which stands at $19.7 billion.\n\nApples and oranges\n\nThere is, however, one important caveat with the TVL valuation as it compares figures from two sources \u2014 L2Beat for layer 2 networks and DefiLlama for so-called layer 1 blockchains.\n\nL2Beat\u2019s combined $20.7 billion figure includes not only investor deposits but the market value of the native tokens of these layer 2 networks. In comparison, the reported TVL for layer 1 networks \u2014 $19.7 billion \u2014 only encompasses the value of investments tied up in their respective decentralised finance markets.\n\nZkSync and Arbitrum have even managed to handle more transactions than Ethereum in the last 30 days, data from L2Beat, a layer two tracking portal, shows.\n\nBlessing in disguise\n\nWhile these achievements suggest some layer 2s are knocking Ethereum off its perch, this does not necessarily imply a negative impact on the mainnet. In fact, the opposite may be true, as these developments are contributing to positive economic outcomes for Ethereum.\n\nFor one, these milestones mean more money for Ethereum validators.\n\nLayer 2 networks pay fees when rolling up their bundled transactions to the Ethereum mainnet for finality \u2014 the process of making transactions irreversible, which ensures the blockchain maintains immutability.\n\nApart from increased validator earnings, the layer 2 transaction uptick is also contributing to mechanisms designed to induce deflation for Ether token supply.\n\nEthereum also has a deflationary mechanism brought on by a network upgrade in August 2021. This upgrade, EIP-1559, made changes to Ethereum\u2019s fee structure with a portion of the transaction fee burned, thus reducing net Ether token inflation.\n\nThree of the top-10 fee burners are currently layer 2 networks, according to data from Ethereum explorer Etherscan.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

        "content": "The Ethereum network is witnessing a surge in validator exits, which hit a record high of over 16,000 validators in the exit queue on Jan. 5, on-chain data showed.\n\nThe rise in exits has caused the wait time for unstaking to spike to an average of 5.6 days. Around 15,140 validators are still in the queue as of press time.\n\nThe surge was primarily driven by withdrawal requests from defunct CeFi lender Celsius Network and staking provider Figment, which collectively make up roughly 75% of total withdrawals in the queue.\n\n550k ETH\n\nCelsius, which is currently undergoing a restructuring process after declaring bankruptcy last year, has initiated a large-scale withdrawal from Ethereum staking.\n\nThe move, aimed at reallocating assets to satisfy creditors\u2019 demands, involves the withdrawal of more than 200,000 ETH, valued at approximately $450 million.\n\nThe situation is exacerbated by the involvement of Figment, another major staking provider, which is linked to 54% (350,000 ETH) of the total withdrawals in the queue.\n\nTogether, the two entities want to withdraw approximately 550,000 staked Ethereum \u2014 roughly 1.7% of the 29 million ETH staked across all platforms.\n\nEntries drying up\n\nAmid these substantial exits, the entry queue for new Ethereum validators remains notably low, hovering near zero. This is a stark contrast to the swelling numbers in the exit queue.\n\nThe Ethereum network operates with a churn limit, which restricts the number of validators that can enter or exit the network per day to 2,925, based on 13 validators per epoch.\n\nThe surge in exit requests has also impacted the staking yield for Ethereum validators. As of press time, the staking rewards reference rate is about 3.4%, down more than 50% from the nearly 8% yield recorded in May 2023.\n\nThis significant shift in validator dynamics poses potential challenges to the Ethereum network\u2019s stability, given the crucial role of validators in securing and processing transactions.\n\nMeanwhile, the extended wait time for unstaking, now at an average of 5.6 days, has raised concerns about the network\u2019s ability to handle large-scale exits."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Crash Looming? Celsius To Unstake $465 Million ETH - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Celsius Network, the bankrupt cryptocurrency lending company, is gearing up to unstake approximately $465 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) as part of its efforts to compensate creditors. This development follows the company\u2019s bankruptcy filing in July 2022, leaving creditors in a prolonged 18-month wait for financial recompense.\n\nCelsius\u2019s decision to unstake a substantial amount of ETH is seen as a necessary step to ensure liquidity for creditor compensation. The company\u2019s official announcement, made via X (formerly Twitter), highlights the strategic nature of this move:\n\n\u201cIn preparation of any asset distributions, Celsius has started the process of recalling and rebalancing assets to ensure ample liquidity. Celsius will unstake existing ETH holdings, which have provided valuable staking rewards income to the estate, to offset certain costs incurred throughout the restructuring process. The significant unstaking activity in the next few days will unlock ETH to ensure timely distributions to creditors,\u201d the announcement reads.\n\nCelsius Responsible For Over 86% Of ETH In Exit Queue?\n\nBlockchain analytics firm Nansen states that Celsius possesses approximately one third of the total Ether in the unstaking exit queue, totaling around 206,300 ETH. This figure translates to a market value of around $465 million. To date, Celsius has already withdrawn over 40,249 ETH.\n\nTom Wan, an on-chain data analyst at 21.co (parent company of 21Shares), elaborated on the situation, \u201cOver 540k staked ETH (16,670 Validators) are currently withdrawing from the Ethereum Beacon chain. To fully exit and withdraw now, it will require 14.5 days.\u201d The researcher added that 352,000 ETH (54.7%) waiting to be withdrawn belongs to Figment and 206,000 ETH (32%) belongs to Celsius.\n\n\u201cIt is also likely that the withdrawal by Figment belongs to Celsius. Earlier in June, when Celsius redeemed 428.000 stETH from Lido, they have re-staked 197.000 ETH via Figment,\u201d he added. Therefore, Celsius might be responsible for unstaking 86.7% of all ETH in the queue.\n\nEthereum Price Crash Looming?\n\nWhile some investors express concern that the release of such a large volume of tokens from staking could adversely impact Ethereum\u2019s price, others maintain a more composed outlook, believing that the market is robust enough to absorb this additional volume.\n\nEven in the unlikely event that all ETH from the queue is sold, liquidity appears to be strong enough to absorb such a process, which would be gradual rather than sudden. According to Coinmarketcap, the current ETH trading volume stands around $11.35 billion, suggesting that the market could withstand the potential sale of Celsius\u2019 entire ETH holdings without any major ETH price crash. Fear-mongering is therefore superfluous.\n\nAfter receiving approval for its settlement plan, Celsius has allowed eligible users to withdraw 72.5% of their cryptocurrency holdings, with this option available until February 28. A court document filed in the previous September revealed that approximately 58,300 users possess a total of $210 million in assets, which the court has classified as \u201ccustody assets.\u201d\n\nAt press time, ETH traded at $2,250. The 1-week chart for ETH/USD indicates that, over the past five weeks, the price of Ethereum has formed a consolidation range. The chart defines this zone with a lower boundary at $2,125, indicated by the red area, and an upper boundary at the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level, located at $2,441.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

But ETH, like many other cryptocurrencies, recovered quickly. Ether currently trades at $2,244, forecasting a potentially explosive move to the upside.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers around 42 after its recovery from the oversold region a few days ago. A higher low formation could indicate a slow but steadily gaining upward momentum.\n\nThe Awesome Oscillator (AO) is much more optimistic than the RSI, which shows a decline in bearish momentum as the indicator approaches the zero line. A flip of the mean level would indicate that the bullish momentum is in play and could push Ethereum price higher.\n\nIn such a case, if Ethereum price flips the $2,300 hurdle into a support floor, it could move higher and retest the $2,400 barrier.

Hence, overcoming this blockade could send ETH to the next critical level of $2,859. Here, roughly 10.77 million addresses that accumulated 5.2 million Ether are sitting at a loss.\n\nTherefore, a potential move into this hurdle could see a considerable spike in selling pressure from these holders trying to break even.\n\nETH GIOM\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum price flips the range low of $2,144, it will create a lower low and invalidate the bullish thesis. In such a case, ETH could slide 6.50% and revisit the $2,000 psychological level.\n\nAlso read: Following spot Bitcoin ETF applicants, SEC holds meetings with NYSE, NASDAQ and other exchanges"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s validator community has encountered an unexpected exodus.\n\nMajor players like Celsius and Figment have triggered a significant withdrawal trend among validators.\n\nNew validators and a regulated limit have contrasted the worrying exodus.\n\nEthereum\u2019s bustling validator scene, long a hive of activity, is witnessing a surprising trend: a mass exit of validators. Thousands of validators entrusted with safeguarding the network are lining up to withdraw their staked ether, raising questions about the future of the platform\u2019s Proof-of-Stake model.\n\nEthereum Exit Fueled by Celsius and Figment\n\nWhile the reasons for this exodus remain murky, some prominent players are driving the surge. Celsius, the embattled crypto lender still navigating bankruptcy, plans to exit the network and distribute its Ethereum holdings to creditors. Its substantial stake, a whopping 200,000 ETH, has undoubtedly contributed to the growing queue.\n\nBut Celsius isn\u2019t alone. Figment, another major staking provider, also appears caught in the exit wave. Data suggests over half of the waiting validators belong to Figment, though experts like Tom Wan of 21 Shares suspect some overlap with Celsius.\n\n\u201cIt is also likely that the withdrawal by Figment belongs to Celsius. Earlier in June, when Celsius redeemed 428k stETH from Lido, it re-staked 197k ETH via Figment,\u201d Wan explains, hinting at a potential indirect link.\n\nIs It Time to Panic?\n\nWhile this mass exit paints a worrisome picture, it\u2019s not the whole story. The queue for new validators remains stagnant, suggesting the exodus hasn\u2019t triggered a wider panic. Additionally, the churn limit, which dictates the pace of validator movements, controls both entry and exit queues.\n\nHowever, a more concerning trend emerges with staking yields. Once hovering near 8% in May 2023, they\u2019ve sunk to roughly 3.4%. This decline could result from the validator exodus, potentially discouraging new entrants.\n\nThe question now looms: is this a temporary blip or a sign of deeper systemic issues within the PoS network? While the churn limit offers some reassurance, the declining yields remain a cause for concern. Whether this exodus represents a healthy market correction or the first tremor of a larger earthquake remains to be seen.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nThe validator exodus might not necessarily signal a systemic flaw within the Proof-of-Stake model.\n\nThe declining staking yields might prompt a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe departure of a few major players could create opportunities for smaller validators or new entrants to increase their influence within the network.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe next few months will be crucial in understanding the long-term implications of this validator movement. The community will undoubtedly be watching closely, hoping that the churn limit and potentially new initiatives to boost yields can stabilize the network and entice fresh participation.\n\nTo learn more about Celsius unstaking $464M ETH ahead of creditor repayments, read here:\n\nCelsius to Unstake $464M ETH Ahead of Creditor Repayments\n\n\n\nCurious about EVM parallelization and its role in driving SEI hype?

        "content": "Arbitrum (CRYPTO: ARB) is among the leading large-cap cryptocurrencies in the market this week. As of 1:45 p.m. ET, Arbitrum has surged 27.2% since last Friday's close and is one of the only top cryptos to have reached a fresh all-time high this past week.\n\nFor mega-cap cryptos, it's been a rather ho-hum week. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), for example, ended the week up 3.7% and down 3.4%, respectively. Hence, the outsize interest in names like Arbitrum.\n\nHere's what investors are watching closely when it comes to this Layer-2 Ethereum scaling solution right now.\n\nArbitrum passes Ethereum in decentralized exchange volume\n\nThe big headline that drove an incredible amount of interest in Arbitrum relative to other top cryptos over the past week is a surge in decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume on the Arbitrum network. Earlier today, Arbitrum pushed past Ethereum to process a 24-hour trading volume of $1.83 billion, making this the leading platform in terms of daily DEX volume.\n\nArbitrum's surge in trading volume was very noticeable, with overall volume increasing more than 32% over the past week. Ethereum's corresponding volume dropped nearly 5% over the same period. Arbitrum's infrastructure, which includes using optimistic rollups to improve speed, scalability, and cost on its network, appears to be striking a chord with traders. In the highly competitive market for DEX market share, Arbitrum is not so quietly rising in the ranks.\n\nTo make things better, Arbitrum also announced record-high total value locked (TVL) metrics this week. The project's overall TVL surged past the $2.5 billion mark for the first time, surpassing Layer-1 network Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) in the process.\n\nAdditionally, Orbit (a Layer-3 project providing developers with the ability to build applications on Arbitrum) announced this week that ARC-20 tokens can now be used for transaction fees. This added benefit for Orbit's individual blockchains and corresponding decentralized applications appears to be spurring overall ecosystem growth for Arbitrum.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat now?\n\nArbitrum appears to be firing on all cylinders. The network's lower-cost, higher-throughput ecosystem is clearly one developers are looking to build upon and users are flocking to. So long as these fundamental metrics continue to improve, this project could certainly continue to see momentum well into 2024.\n\nNow, some of Arbitrum's transaction volume surge can be attributed to a meme token-driven frenzy in recent months. Most conservative investors wouldn't bet the farm on that continuing, and at some point, I think the fuel this catalyst is providing will run out.\n\nThat said, Arbitrum's infrastructure and value as a scaling solution are being validated in a big way by the market. For those betting on growth within the Ethereum ecosystem (with the majority of the spoils in terms of volume going to scaling solutions like Arbitrum), this is a crypto to keep your eye on.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ARB right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ARB, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and ARB wasn't one of them.

Earlier this week, the figure reached nearly 50%.\n\nThe Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), an enforcement agency of the US Treasury Department, maintains this list.\n\nUnlike permissionless crypto networks like Bitcoin which allow any user to broadcast any transaction for inclusion in an upcoming block, OFAC-compliant relays on Ethereum censor wallet addresses that appear on US sanctions lists.\n\nThe widely popular software Maximum Extractable Value Boost (\u2018MEV-Boost\u2019) censors these wallets by default and many relays use its default settings. Mev-Boost also outsources validators\u2019 block production to a third-party marketplace operated by itself, maximizing revenue by exploiting everyday Ethereum users via front-running, back-running, sandwiching, and other quantitative trading tactics.\n\nImage courtesy of Mev Watch.\n\nRead more: Here\u2019s how insiders are getting rich off the Ethereum Merge\n\nSome examples of MEV-boost relays include Flashbots \u2014 by far the largest \u2014 and others like BlockNative, Manifold, Eden, BloXroute Max Profit, BloXroute Ethical, and BloXroute Regulated.\n\nRelay operators who comply with US sanctions censor which users may broadcast transactions into the Ethereum blockchain. Sanctioned users may still try to gain inclusion of their transaction by routing through a non-OFAC-compliant pathway.\n\nGot a tip? Send us an email or ProtonMail.

Here is a quick analysis of where the money is flowing next\ud83d\udc47 \u2014 Metaquant (@QuantMeta) January 4, 2024\n\nThe analyst added that in the past ten days, AVAX and SOL have cooled down after their huge runs, while ETH went sideways without showing signs of weakness. \u201cThe next run will likely be on ETH and its ecosystem,\u201d he said.\n\nAdditionally, the activity on Ethereum and layer-2 networks has been growing steadily for months. Total value locked across the L2 ecosystem hit an all-time high of $21 billion on Jan. 4, according to L2beat.\n\nIn addition to the TVL peak, daily active addresses, layer-2 fees, and layer-2 stablecoin market capitalization have also been steadily increasing.\n\nSince ETH prices have been lagging as attention was elsewhere, \u201conce price goes up, everyone will move again on ETH and L2s,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNote how there is no bull run without an ETH on-chain season. So, it\u2019s a matter of time before this starts to happen.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, embattled crypto lender Celsius has just announced that it is unstaking ETH to return to creditors.\n\nWhile this may cause some short-term volatility if they sell, it has been viewed as a positive for Ethereum markets without the vampirical cloud of Celsius and its huge ETH bags hanging over them.\n\nETH Price Outlook\n\nETH prices have remained flat on the day at $2,242 at the time of writing. However, the asset is down 8% from its weekly high of $2,434 on Dec. 2 as markets cool.\n\nZooming out, Ethereum has been consolidating at current levels for the past month.\n\nAdditionally, analysts have been mulling potential price peaks for ETH this year. Some see it hitting $10,000 quite easily. This is only double its all-time high in the last cycle, in which it made a $4,800 gain from trough to peak."

        "content": "2023 was not particularly Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) best year. Although the second-largest cryptocurrency rallied almost 90%, other altcoins, such as Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX), were miles ahead. SOL\u2019s price went up by nearly 1000% in 2023. AVAX, on the other hand, saw an increase of over 200%. However, things may change for ETH in 2024, as there is a possibility that the project could surge to new heights.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum to \u201cEasily\u201d Rally 350% and Hit $10,000: Predicts Analyst.\n\nEthereum (ETH) to hit $10,000 in 2024?\n\nOne of the biggest drivers for ETH\u2019s price would be a bull run for the crypto market. Analysts anticipate a bull market in 2024, fuelled by the SEC\u2018s (Securities and Exchange Commission) possible approval of a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) and BTC\u2019s halving event in April. Both developments could usher in a 2021-like bull run for the crypto market. In such a scenario, BTC might hit a new all-time high. If BTC reaches a new peak, ETH is likely to follow.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum: ETH Could Hit $3500 in Q1, But There\u2019s a Catch\n\nThe second factor that could send Ethereum (ETH) to $10,000 is the possibility of an ETH ETF. The world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, is among the interested parties. Moreover, the SEC has accepted ETH as a commodity. Hence, an ETH ETF approval could be smooth sailing for the industry.\n\nAnother aspect to consider is that an Ethereum (ETH) rally is long overdue. Other altcoins, such as Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA), etc., rallied hard towards the end of 2023. ETH, however, kept calm. Hence, we may see a late rally for the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is also one of the most-used networks right now. The project dominates in terms of applications and adoption. This metric will play a vital role in ETH\u2019s journey to $10,000."

The selloff Ethereum experienced pushed its price to a low of $2,181 before bouncing back to $2,236.77 which it currently trades at.\n\nEthereum\u2019s recovery was signaled by the reduced selloff with the rate of growth in price and market capitalization staying at 0% in the past 24 hours.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nInsight Into the Whale Ethereum Accumulation\n\nAccording to data from the crypto analytics platform Spot On Chain, the whale with the address \u20180x931\u2019 spent $48 million to buy a total of 21,192 ETH at an average price of $2,265 a couple of hours before writing. This brings the valuation of the stash to $47,999,880.\n\nThe whale has no special preference for centralized exchanges as the accumulation thus far has been conducted through Binance and Decentralized Exchanges.\n\nPer the data shared, since January 13, 2023, the whale has purchased a total of 79,500 ETH at an average price of $1,790 with a total of $36.84 million.\n\n??

This has proven to be effective considering the win rate.\n\nThe whale\u2019s purchases have come from different sources including revolving loans from Aave lending protocol and Liquidity.\n\nPer Spot On Chain\u2019s observations, the Ethereum whale appears to be long on Ethereum and the accumulation thus far has yielded a total of 25.9% in unrealized profit.\n\nEthereum Retracement Underway?\n\nThe accumulation of Ethereum by this whale mimics related bullish moves of Michael Saylor, the Chairman of MicroStrategy, the firm that recently acquired $615 million worth of Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, the committed capital is potentially not large enough to cause a significant shift that can trigger Ethereum\u2019s long-sought bullish retracement.\n\nDiscounting this accumulation, the hype surrounding Bitcoin spot ETF has the potential to trigger a rally in the price of Ethereum as the bullish sentiment that might accompany a likely approval might send prices of all assets correlated with BTC to new heights."

        "title": "Better Buy: Bitcoin or Ethereum? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After Bitcoin (BTC 2.11%) soared by more than 150% last year, investors are now looking far and wide for cryptocurrencies that might be able to outperform Bitcoin in 2024. One intriguing candidate is Ethereum (ETH 1.19%), which is still the world's second-most valuable cryptocurrency with a whopping $270 billion market cap.\n\nWhile Ethereum might not get the same hype as Bitcoin, it's certainly worth a closer look, especially if some of the catalysts expected to push Bitcoin higher fail to materialize. Let's take a closer look.\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nJust about everyone agrees that investor anticipation of a new spot Bitcoin ETF is the key factor pushing Bitcoin higher right now. The underlying logic makes sense: A new regulated financial product for investing in Bitcoin should attract money from both retail and institutional investors. If institutional investors with trillions of dollars of assets under management allocate just 1% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, that could result in literally tens of billions of dollars flowing into Bitcoin. That would almost certainly cause the price of Bitcoin to soar.\n\nBut there are several problems with that argument, says JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.05%). In a December research note to clients, JPMorgan Chase specifically pointed out that much of the hype around the Bitcoin ETF might be undeserved. For one, spot Bitcoin ETF products exist elsewhere in the world (in both Canada and Europe), and they have experienced relatively weak demand. What's to say that the U.S. market will be different?\n\nMoreover, there are other Bitcoin investment products to choose from right now. Popular choices include Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC 4.57%) and ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO 4.38%). So instead of huge flows of new money into Bitcoin, we might just see a reshuffling of money out of existing Bitcoin investment products and into the new spot Bitcoin ETF. The net impact, in that case, would not be nearly as great as some are now predicting.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving\n\nThe second major catalyst for Bitcoin is the approaching halving event. This event, which occurs only once every four years, is coming up in April, and it's likely to be one of the most talked-about developments in the crypto market this year. In three past halvings, the price of Bitcoin has soared, and many investors are expecting the same to happen again. In fact, some are now predicting that Bitcoin could push through the $100,000 mark by the end of the year.\n\nBut keep in mind that a growing number of influential voices on Wall Street think that much of the Bitcoin halving's impact might already be priced in. If you buy into the efficient market hypothesis, which says that all publicly available information is already factored into prices, then maybe the halving will be a non-event.\n\nAfter all, the entire market knows when the halving is going to take place. There are websites with clocks counting down the seconds. And the entire market has plenty of historical data to work with. Granted, the crypto market may not be as efficient as the equity market at pricing in information, but it's safe to say that every major Wall Street firm is aware of the implications of the Bitcoin halving.\n\nThe case for Ethereum\n\nWhile Ethereum may not have the same kinds of catalysts as Bitcoin, it is working on significant improvements to its overall blockchain architecture. Ethereum has not really delivered on everything it originally promised for The Merge, when it transitioned to a much more energy effective network. This year might be an opportunity to reassure investors that everything is still on track. If these improvements lead to lower fees, faster transaction speeds, and higher overall throughput, it could make Ethereum much more attractive to investors.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum is more likely to benefit from increased development activity in crypto than Bitcoin. That's because Ethereum, unlike Bitcoin, is active in just about every major niche of the blockchain and crypto world, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), blockchain gaming, the metaverse, and Web3. During the long crypto winter that set in during 2022, many of these areas went into hibernation. But in a crypto spring, they could come back to life.\n\nAnd the better buy is...\n\nI've tried to make a compelling case for Ethereum, but if forced to choose between Bitcoin and Ethereum, I'm still going with Bitcoin. Yes, the new spot Bitcoin ETF might be overhyped. And yes, the Bitcoin halving cycle might be underwhelming this time around. But with so much institutional investor support behind it now, Bitcoin is closer to going mainstream than at any time in its history. If there's just one crypto to buy in 2024, it's Bitcoin."

        "content": "Decentralized exchanges (DEX) transaction volume on Arbitrum, a layer2 network, surpassed that of Ethereum for the first time during the past day, according to DeFillama data.\n\nDuring the reporting period, DEXs on Arbitrum saw their volume soar to $1.843 billion, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s $1.444 billion and Solana\u2019s $683.59 million.\n\nThis surge aligns with Arbitrum\u2019s continuous weekly growth, rising by 32.58% to $6.804 billion, a new all-time high, though still trailing Ethereum\u2019s $9.581 billion. However, it surpasses Solana\u2019s $5.039 billion and notably exceeds Binance Smart Chain\u2019s daily volume by nearly fourfold.\n\nThe rising DEX volume also coincided with high-network activity on the layer2 network. During the past day, Arbitrum\u2019s daily transaction per second stood at 14.05, while Ethereum mainnet\u2019s was 12.92, according to L2beat data.\n\nUniswap dominates\n\nThe increased trading volume can be attributed to heightened activity on Arbitrum\u2019s DEXs like Uniswap, Camelot, Ramses Exchange, and Trader Joe. Data from DeFillama shows that these protocols have enjoyed double-digit growth to new highs during the past week.\n\nUniswap Labs, the developers of the popular decentralized trading protocol Uniswap, revealed that Arbitrum became the first layer2 network to cross a billion in daily volume on the platform on Jan. 4.\n\nUniswap is the largest DEX protocol by trading volume across all chains, with an average volume of more than $1.5 billion during the past week.\n\nArbitrum\u2019s rising TVL\n\nThe rising DEX volume has also coincided with a sharp increase in the total value of assets locked on the Ethereum-based layer2 network.\n\nData from DefiLlama shows the TVL on Arbitrum-based applications has increased by around $1 billion in the last six months to nearly $2.5 billion, with the dominant DeFi protocol being GMX, a decentralized spot, and perpetual exchange, which controls about 20% of the network\u2019s total TVL.\n\nAdditionally, Arbitrum\u2019s native ARB token recently reached a new all-time high of more than $2 on Jan. 4 but has retraced to $1.94 as of press time, according to CryptoSlate\u2019s data."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst is warning that interest in the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem is declining as attention shifts to Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIn a new strategy session, Nicholas Merten, the host of DataDash, tells his 510,000 YouTube subscribers that future crypto development will likely focus on Bitcoin, which may diminish Ethereum\u2019s future value.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very good chance of a rotation, a sector rotation in altcoins from legacy plays like Ethereum and other EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) chains towards other different types of plays in the space. That can be alternative L1s (layer-1s), but it also is mainly going to be Bitcoin-related infrastructure.\n\nBitcoin is the focal point here. And if you want to build a programmable layer for Bitcoin, you can do that. There are programmable layers like that. There\u2019s Stacks. There\u2019s a whole range of other plays out there, a lot of new EVM-compatible L2s (layer-2s) for the Bitcoin network that are being built right now. And I think this showcases a very big hole in Ethereum\u2019s value proposition.\u201d\n\nThe trader also says that there don\u2019t appear to be new developments in the ETH ecosystem generating much excitement.\n\n\u201cIt does feel like Ethereum is like a deadweight chain right now. No new exciting things that have gotten me really juiced up here, no new applications on Ethereum, nothing, for example, that couldn\u2019t be deployed on a dozen other EVM chains that will easily steal that ecosystem activity because they\u2019re much more scalable, they have lower fees.\n\nAnd\u2026 I think that they\u2019re in just as much trouble because they suffer from almost the same position that Ethereum is in. They don\u2019t have any ties to Bitcoin. They\u2019re seeing practically zero single-digit growth. If anything, they\u2019re declining in their stablecoin liquidity deposited on the chain, or any other kind of metrics that we utilize, developer commits, etc.\u201d\n\nThe trader says his analysis is supported by the fact that Ethereum is declining against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC).\n\n\u201cEthereum is losing out against Bitcoin. It might be going up in dollar terms, but the name of the game here in crypto is you either buy Bitcoin or you buy into plays that are consistently helping you to outperform Bitcoin as an asset. If you\u2019re not, why not just buy the king? Why not just buy the largest position in the market, the safest bet? Because Ethereum right now, for four months, has been below the 200-week (moving average). This is not a good sign to see.\u201d\n\nETH/BTC is trading for 0.0512 BTC ($2,218) at time of writing.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko has expressed confidence that their blockchain can handle the growing demand for decentralized applications (dapps) without needing layer-2 solutions like those employed by Ethereum.\n\nSolana Doesn\u2019t Need Layer-2 Solutions\n\nIn a post on X, Yakovenko argued that Solana\u2019s design, which utilizes a hybrid consensus mechanism, enables it to scale efficiently without relying on additional layers. The co-founder explained that their goal is to eventually synchronize a global atomic state machine \u201cas fast as the laws of physics allow.\u201d With this stance, Yakovenko appears to be downplaying the role of layer-2 off-chain options like Arbitrum and Base.\n\n\u201cSolana aims to synchronize a global atomic state machine as fast as the laws of physics allow,\u201d Yakovenko said on X. \u201cIn this end state, any layer-2, side chain, or zero-knowledge proof Valadium amounts to the same thing. They are external execution environments that cannot ensure atomic composition with the rest of the layer-1 state.\u201d\n\nDespite the position Yakovenko takes, the co-founder said the floor is open for developers to create layer-2 solutions. However, it won\u2019t be necessary because the network can handle such demand without such workarounds.\n\nEthereum Is Confident Layer-2s Will Be Key To Scaling\n\nThis stance contrasts Ethereum\u2019s approach, which increasingly relies on layer-2 solutions to alleviate congestion and high transaction fees. Layer-2 options such as Optimism and Arbitrum have gained popularity for their ability to offload transactions from the mainnet while maintaining compatibility with existing smart contracts.\n\nTo quantify their role in scaling Ethereum, L2Beat data shows that the layer-2 solutions have a combined total value locked (TVL) of over $20 billion. The largest of them is Arbitrum, which manages $10 billion of assets when writing on January 5.\n\nThough Yakovenko\u2019s comments reflect Solana\u2019s focus on providing a high-performance, low-cost environment for apps, there have been instances when the network froze, calling its reliability into question. To resolve this, the platform plans to upgrade its client, adding the Firedancer for increased node reliability and performance.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum seems to be going the layer-2 route. During their developer call, it was decided that Ethereum\u2019s gas limit won\u2019t be increased further from the 30 million gwei level. This, analysts concluded, meant the delay of on-chain scaling ambitions for off-chain methods, specifically off-chain and sidechain rails.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum validator exit hits all-time high of 15,000 as Celsius announces mass ETH unstaking - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum on-chain data shows that the current exit queue has a wait time of 5 days and 4 hours.\n\nCelsius announced that it would be unstaking its existing ETH holdings in order to offset restructuring costs.\n\nThe collective value of ETH set to be removed from the Ethereum validator chain is over $1.09 billion.\n\nEthereum Shanghai update introduced the option to withdraw the ETH staked by investors, essentially giving validators the option to exit the market. Since then, Friday marked the biggest day for the network as it noted the highest count of validator exits in the queue, all thanks to Celsius\n\nEthereum validator backlog\n\nEthereum is witnessing a historical moment. For the first time since it activated the withdrawal of staked ETH, a mass exit event can be witnessed. At the time of writing, the chain had an exit queue of 15,358 validators, and the expected wait time is presently five days and 4 hours.\n\nThis means that any validator that attempts to exit now will have to wait for five days before they can get their 32 ETH back. Furthermore, based on the value of one validator staking being 32 ETH, the chain is set to note an outflow of $1.09 billion worth of staking over the next few days.\n\nEthereum validator exit queue\n\nHowever, despite being such a humungous figure, it will barely make a dent in the network or sway the price action. This is because, at the moment, Ethereum has over 905,000 validators, and the total amount staked on the network is 28.8 million ETH. This represents nearly 24% of the entire circulating supply of the digital asset.\n\nThe reason behind the backlog\n\nCelsius, a prominent name in the crypto space until its bankruptcy in July 2022, is in the process of restructuring the entire company. This includes asset distribution, for which Celsius has begun recalling and rebalancing assets to ensure ample liquidity.\n\nConsequentially, the company announced that it would be unstaking all its existing ETH holdings in order to offset the costs it has been facing throughout the restructuring process. It also addressed the backlog caused by this decision, stating that the process would take a few days given the enormous amount of ETH set to be unstacked."

        "content": "Ethereum, one of the most prominent cryptocurrencies within the digital assets realm, recently gained significant traction across the broader crypto market following a noteworthy transaction on Saturday. According to the on-chain data floating over the crypto horizon, Paradigm, an institutional liquidity network, dumped substantial amounts of ETH to Coinbase, one of the world\u2019s leading crypto exchanges.\n\nThe dumping of Ethereum to the aforementioned CEX soon nabbed noteworthy attention among crypto market enthusiasts globally as the transaction surfaced within the market amid the token\u2019s price drop. Intriguingly, Ethereum\u2019s price today traded briefly in the green, fueling market optimism. However, with the transaction emerging within the crypto landscape, the price promptly went downwards, curating a hurricane of speculations for the cryptocurrency.\n\nadvertisement\n\nParadigm\u2019s ETH Transfer To CEX: Report\n\nAccording to the data unveiled by Lookonchain, a platform streamlining on-chain metrics, Paradigm deposited 6,500 ETH, worth $14.67 million, to Coinbase today, January 6, 2024. Intriguingly, Paradigm accumulated these ETH at phenomenal price lows.\n\nMoreover, as per past market data, Paradigm seems to be mirroring smart money addresses, gathering colossal amounts of ETH amid bearish market sentiments and thereafter selling the same in bullish markets. Concerning this, even today\u2019s ETH deposit was accumulated at a price low when ETH was evaluated at less than $500. Now, as the price crosses $2,200, Paradigm appears to have sold the aforestated number of ETH to Coinbase, garnering notable profits.\n\nAlso Read: OpenAI & Microsoft Face Another Lawsuit Amid NYT Woes Over AI Training\n\nEthereum Price Dips\n\nAs of writing, the Ethereum price noted a marginal drop of 0.81% over the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $2,236. Moreover, this dip was further accompanied by a weekly drop of 2.83%, followed by a monthly fall of 1.66%.\n\nIntriguingly, today\u2019s price briefly traded in the green, amassing significant attention among crypto market traders and investors globally. However, it soon started moving downwards, aligning with Paradigm\u2019s massive selloff around the same time period.\n\nAlso Read: Solana (SOL) Price Falls Below $95 Amid Wider Crypto Sell-Off"

        "title": "Ethereum Layer 2 Networks Just Set A New Record - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The total value locked (TVL) on Ethereum layer-2 networks recently hit a new all-time high in January, a testament to the continued adoption of Ethereum. Layer 2 networks sit on top of the Ethereum blockchain and help scale it by processing transactions off-chain before sending data back to the main blockchain.\n\nAccording to data from L2BEAT, a layer-2 analytics platform, the TVL on these scaling solutions recently reached an all-time high of $21.16 billion, representing a 340% growth from the same day last year.\n\nEthereum Layer-2 Networks Hit New Milestone\n\n2023 was a great year for Ethereum, as the altcoin and its scaling solutions registered a steady increase in TVL despite strong competition from other networks like Solana and Cardano. Data from L2Beat shows the TVL on these scaling solutions started in 2023 with $4.81 billion but grew steadily throughout to end the year at $19.98 billion dollars, a 315% growth.\n\nThis growth was particularly exacerbated in the last quarter of 2023 and continued into 2024. The TVL grew by $1.18 billion in the first three days of January to reach $21.16 on January 3, its current all-time high.\n\nAt the time of writing, the TVL is now at $20.41 billion, still up by 3.82% in the past seven days. A large fraction of this layer-2 TVL can be attributed to Arbitrum One, with the scaling solution currently having $10.05 billion worth of cryptocurrencies locked.\n\nOP Mainnet, formerly called Optimism, is second with a current TVL of $5.84 billion. 57% of this TVL is composed of OP tokens, compared to Arbitrum One, whose ARB token constitutes only 36% of the TVL.\n\nETH price holds $2,200 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nState Of The ETH Network\n\nThis massive growth shows that Ethereum users are flocking to layer 2 networks to escape high gas fees and congestion on the mainnet. Ethereum\u2019s TVL also witnessed steady growth throughout the year, adding $7.6 billion in the last quarter of 2023. Data from DeFiLlama shows the TVL on Ethereum is now at $28.532 billion.\n\nHowever, Ethereum has seen its daily active addresses and transaction count plunge in the last few months. Data from Artemis revealed the network is currently being surpassed by Solana and Sui in terms of daily transaction count. Recent competition from Solana prompted an analyst to describe Ethereum as digging its own grave by relying too much on its layer-2 networks for scalability.\n\nSome layer-2 chains are also currently processing more transactions than Ethereum itself. L2BEAT puts the monthly transactions on zkSync Era and Arbitrum at 39.91 million and 35.54 million respectively, ahead of Ethereum\u2019s count of 33.91 million transactions.\n\nFeatured image from Yahoo Finance, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Despite a heavy sell-off on January 4th, the ETH price showcased its sustainability above the $2140 support which is above the safety net of 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level.

        "content": "The surge in Arbitrum\u2019s daily volume likely stems from the upcoming Ethereum upgrade dubbed Dencun, not the memecoin frenzy experienced by other blockchain networks.\n\nArbitrum, a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, has taken the lead in daily volume on decentralized exchanges (DEX) for the first time in Arbitrum\u2019s history, according to the most recent data from crypto analytics firm DefiLlama.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, the total value of transactions made on Arbitrum by crypto users stands at $1.83 billion, taking the lead from base layer blockchain Ethereum, which has a 24-hour volume of $1.44 billion. In fact, the combined 24-hour volume of Solana, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Optimism and zkSync Era is less than that of Arbitrum.\n\n\n\nThe historical leader in 24-hour volume has been Ethereum, though its seat on the throne has been challenged recently. Solana, a layer 1 blockchain that implements proof-of-history, surpassed Ethereum\u2019s daily DEX volume for several days in December 2023. Now, less than a month later, Arbitrum has taken the lead.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy feat, there\u2019s a lot of chains and not many have been able to do that, even if it\u2019s just temporarily,\u201d said Martin Lee, content lead at on-chain metrics firm Nansen, to Unchained via Telegram. \u201cWhile it\u2019s an impressive achievement, ideally, I\u2019d want to see this trend continue over a longer time horizon before putting any weight behind it. We\u2019ve seen moments where chains get massive spikes in activity but few manage to maintain it.\u201d\n\nDencun\u2019s Impact\n\nThe spike in Arbitrum\u2019s volume likely stems from the upcoming Ethereum upgrade known as Dencun, Lee noted. Set to be activated on several testnets this month, Dencun is the first major upgrade to Ethereum since Shapella in April of last year, which enabled stakers to withdraw their ETH. The newest upgrade includes EIP-4844, also known as proto-danksharding, which is designed to scale Ethereum in a decentralized way.\n\n\u201cProto-danksharding reduces the cost of posting large amounts of data to Ethereum and thereby lowers the operational cost of rollups,\u201d wrote Galaxy\u2019s vice president of research Christine Kim in a research report last June. \u201cEIP 4844 is considered a boost to Ethereum scalability because it makes Layer-2 networks built atop Ethereum more cost-effective,\u201d the report said.\n\nIn addition, Carlos Mercado, data scientist at blockchain data firm Flipside Crypto told Unchained over Telegram that \u201cArbitrum over the last few weeks has been preparing for Arbitrum Orbit, their competitor to the Optimism \u2018Superchain\u2019 thesis,\u201d a network of chains that all share Optimism\u2019s open-source development stack.\n\nNotably, the surge in Arbitrum\u2019s daily DEX volume is not from the recent memecoin frenzy that has gone viral on other Layer-1 networks such as Bitcoin, Solana, and Avalanche. Memecoins \u201cnever took off\u201d on Arbitrum, according to Nansen\u2019s Lee.\n\nARB, the native governance token for the Arbitrum ecosystem, has slid roughly 11% in the past 24 hours, but has gained nearly 27% in the past seven days to change hands at $1.86, according to CoinGecko.\n\nDisclosure: Arbitrum is a sponsor of Unchained."

        "content": "Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\n\nWith market conditions trending higher, many speculators are contemplating whether Ethereum (ETH) could hit $10,000 in 2024. Currently, it is trading at $2,254, up 2.9% this month and 81% year-to-date. However, some analysts are backing Bitcoin Minetrix after its presale hits $7.5 million.\n\nAnalysts bullish on Ethereum\n\nGiven Ethereum\u2019s trajectory in the last bull run, market participants are eagerly anticipating for the coin to hit $10k, hoping it comes in the early stages of the upcoming bull market rally.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum suffered highest losses due to rug pulls and hacks, data shows\n\nFollowing the last Bitcoin halving, Ethereum rose from $200 to over $1,200.\n\nIf the same growth applies, ETH may soar above $13K by the end of 2024.\n\nEven so, several variables are at play, mainly Ethereum\u2019s significantly higher market cap of $272 billion.\n\nAs such, it is not as simple as using past data to determine future results. However, several analysts have weighed in on this possibility in 2024.\n\nGeoff Kendrick, head of FX Research, West, and Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered Bank, believes the coin could be headed to $4,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nThe analyst referenced the Bitcoin halving, speculating it \u201cshould lift all boats.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, X commentator icircle_nft recently said ETH will rally to $5K by the end of 2024.\n\nHowever, the analyst has higher hopes for ETH in 2025, forecasting it will reach $18K.\n\nMeanwhile, FieryTrading said the coin is trading inside a rising wedge pattern and may reach $16K by the end of 2025.\n\nThat said, analyst CrediBULL Crypto is even more optimistic, speculating Ethereum could reach highs of $20K or a minimum of $10K by the end of 2024.\n\nUltimately, whether Ethereum will underperform, equal, or outperform its last market cycle remains to be seen. While most analysts are bullish, there are many opinions on where it could be headed.\n\nThough many analysts expect Ethereum to outperform in 2024, some are more bullish on Bitcoin Minetrix after raising $7.5 million in the ongoing presale.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix raises $7.5 million in presale: what\u2019s next?\n\nBitcoin Minetrix allows users to earn passive BTC rewards by staking on Ethereum.\n\nThe project is a cloud mining solution where users can stake BTCMTX for Bitcoin mining credits.\n\nThey can then burn these credits on the Bitcoin Minetrix platform for cloud mining power, receiving Bitcoin.\n\nThis use case requires no hardware or technical know-how from users, making it ideal for beginners.\n\nAnother benefit is that the decentralized and transparent BTCMTX eradicates the risk of cloud mining scams.\n\nOther advantages include no space or noise constraints on the user and it offers a more eco-friendly way to mine Bitcoin.\n\nThese benefits seem to be supporting the project in the ongoing presale which has raised $7.5 million so far.\n\nFor what it offers, an analyst, Jacob Bury, says BTCMTX is set for more gains after launching.\n\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

        "content": "Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius will unstake 206,300 Ethereum, worth around $470 million, as part of efforts to facilitate the distribution of assets to creditors, according to a Jan. 4 statement on social media platform X (formerly Twitter).\n\nCelsius said the planned \u201csignificant\u201d unstaking event will occur in the next few days and further revealed that its staked Ethereum holdings provided the failed company a \u201cvaluable staking rewards income\u201d to offset certain costs incurred throughout its restructuring process.\n\nFollowing the news, Nansen\u2019s Ethereum Shanghai (Shapella) Upgrade dashboard shows that the lender wants to withdraw 206,300 ETH, or 32% of all ETH awaiting withdrawal, valued at nearly $470 million.\n\nThe dashboard further shows that the firm is among the top 10 firms that have withdrawn their staked ETH since withdrawals were enabled last year. Celsius has withdrawn a total of 40,249 ETH as of press time.\n\nAdditionally, Celsius\u2019s decision has led to a notable surge in the Ethereum validator exit queue. According to data from beaconcha.in, the queue has spiked to over 16,000 today, a record high, and the waiting time has extended to approximately six days.\n\nMeanwhile, the recent announcement signifies progress in Celsius\u2019s restructuring journey and the imminent return of customers\u2019 assets. The court has already approved a restructuring plan that could enable creditors to recover up to 79% of their holdings.\n\nNevertheless, criticisms have emerged due to the absence of a disclosed effective distribution date, with customers expressing weariness over continual preparation updates.\n\nWhat does this mean for ETH price?\n\nCrypto community members are concerned that Celsius\u2019s move might increase the selling pressure on the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization.\n\nLast December, CryptoSlate reported that the bankrupt lender sold $250 million of digital assets, including Ethereum, in 30 days. At the time, observers suggested that the firm was selling to capitalize MiningCo, a Bitcoin mining company that creditors of the failed firm would own.\n\nHowever, Celsius said, \u201cEligible creditors will receive in-kind distributions of BTC and ETH as outlined in the approved Plan.\u201d"

One does not simply fade a 35% liquidation dump in the strongest uptrend of all the top 10 coins in a bull run.\u201d\n\nBluntz utilizes the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis. The Elliott Wave theory states that the main trend of the price of an asset moves in a five-wave pattern while the correction happens in a three-wave pattern.\n\nLooking at his chart, the trader suggests Solana is in the process of printing a five-wave pattern to the upside that will cause SOL to cross the $145 level.\n\nSolana is trading for $98.70 at time of writing, down nearly 7% in the last 24 hours.\n\nNext up, the trader predicts that the newer layer-1 blockchain project Sei Network (SEI) could soon hit the $1 level after completing a three-wave correction.\n\n\u201cEven though it\u2019s starting to go parabolic, all dips are constantly three-wave moves down with no signs of slowing down yet. $1 feels programmed at this point.\u201d\n\nSEI is trading for $0.72 at time of writing, down nearly 8% in the last 24 hours.\n\nLastly, the trader believes a breakout is incoming for Lido DAO (LDO), a crypto project that aims to allow users to stake Ethereum without locking assets or maintaining infrastructure. He also says LDO is making gains against Bitcoin (LDO/BTC).\n\n\u201cI have a love/hate relationship with LDO but I think it\u2019s finally going for the price discovery breakout. There\u2019s also weekly bullish divergence on the BTC pair.\u201d\n\nLooking at the trader\u2019s chart, he suggests that LDO is about to take out the key resistance level at $3.17, and its value against Bitcoin could soon soar to 0.000140 BTC ($6.16).\n\nLDO/BTC is trading for 0.00007549 BTC ($3.32) at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction with Major Gains Expected in 2024 \u2013 Can ETH Surpass Its All-Time High?\n\nThe Ethereum price has gained 2% today, rising back to $2,260 as the wider market recovers from a sharp selloff earlier in the week.\n\nETH\u2019s current price means that it has lost 4% in a week and 0.5% in the last 30 days, yet the biggest altcoin in the market remains up by a very healthy 81% in the past year.\n\nIn other words, this week\u2019s haircut hasn\u2019t done much to dislodge Ethereum from its strong position, with the coin potentially on course to ride a bull market in 2024 to new highs.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction with Major Gains Expected in 2024 \u2013 Can ETH Surpass Its All-Time High?\n\n\n\nEthereum\u2019s indicators are in a mixed position right now, with the coin\u2019s recent rallies arguably putting it in a position where it should correct downwards for a bit.\n\nFor instance, its 30-day average (yellow) has been well above its 200-day (blue) for a couple of months now, implying that traders had overbought it in recent weeks and that it needs to cool down.\n\nAt the same time, ETH\u2019s relative strength index (purple) is hovering around 50, having been high at the start of December.\n\nIts downwards trajectory since last month could mean that it\u2019s on course to fall further, perhaps towards 30, before we see some concerted rises again.\n\nYet one thing holders can take heart from is the fact that ETH\u2019s support level (green) has risen and held up consistently well since November, so even if ETH struggles to rise in the short term it\u2019s unlikely to fall significantly.\n\nIn terms of when we can expect a recovery, the SEC\u2019s potential approval of Bitcoin ETFs will lift the wider market massively, including Ethereum.\n\nAnd given that the market is expecting the Fed to soften its rate stance this year, crypto could see another strong bull market, helped along by Bitcoin\u2019s next halving.\n\nEthereum L1 is an API for security guarantees. Everything happening on top is a cambrian explosion of innovation, attracting the brightest minds of our generation. ETH is the asset powering this ecosystem, being deflationary and yielding 5%+. Thats it. My thesis for 2024ff. \u2014 f1go.eth \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@FigoETH) December 31, 2023\n\nAs the second-biggest coin in the market, this will all feed into the Ethereum price, which could hit $3,000 by the middle of the year.\n\nAnd given that ETH\u2019s fundamentals are among the strongest in the whole sector, the coin is likely to enjoy growth on its own account.\n\nIt could even trouble its current ATH \u2013 of $4,878 \u2013 by the end of the year.\n\nOther High-Potential Altcoins to Consider\n\n\n\nETH may be one of the strongest major tokens in the market, but it isn\u2019t the only coin with the potential to rally big in the coming weeks.\n\nIndeed, there a wide variety of exciting newer tokens now available, including a number of presale coins that have been able to accumulate substantial momentum.\n\nProbably the best example of this at the moment is Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), an Ethereum-based stake-to-mine platform that has raised over $7.5 million in its presale.\n\nWhat Bitcoin Minetrix promises to do is to make Bitcoin mining more accessible and decentralized, by enabling anyone capable of staking tokens to mine BTC.\n\nThat is, by staking its native BTCMTX token, users receive tokenized mining credits in return, which they can use to purchase Bitcoin hashing power.\n\nDoing this enough will provide participants with newly mined BTC, while staking will also provide them with a passive income in the form of BTCMTX.\n\nThat Bitcoin Minetrix is set to be so rewarding for users explains why its presale has already done really well, with newcomers able to join the sale by heading over to the official Bitcoin Minetrix website.\n\nExplore the #BTCMTX #Telegram Community, with over 10,000 participants. \ud83d\udcca Stay updated with the latest advancements in cloud mining.\n\n\ud83d\udcac Participate in discussions alongside passionate fans.\n\n\ud83d\udd10 Unlock exclusive perspectives and priceless guidance. \ud83d\udd17 https://t.co/jjqYaqOtyv pic.twitter.com/rBRo7ZOUrx \u2014 Bitcoinminetrix (@bitcoinminetrix) January 5, 2024\n\nBy connecting their crypto wallets (e.g. MetaMask), they can buy BTCMTX before it lists at a price of $0.0126 per token.\n\nThis price is set to increase tomorrow, while the coin\u2019s eventual listing on exchanges in the next month or so could see it rally big.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix NowDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s robust development continued with confirmed testnet upgrades.\n\nETF developments and changing options market sentiment added more layers to the Ethereum narrative.\n\nDespite recent market volatility, Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] development activity remained robust, as highlighted in the latest Ethereum developers\u2019 call, ACDE#178.\n\nThe testnet upgrade timelines for Dencun were confirmed, with Goerli on 17th January, Sepolia on 30th January, and Holesky on 7th February.\n\nConcerns were raised about the tight schedule and the 13-day gap between Goerli and Sepolia, prompting further discussions.\n\nWhat next\n\nLooking ahead, the Ethereum community is gearing up for the Prague/Electra (Pectra) upgrade, with debates centered on prioritizing Verkle as the sole focus or concurrently increasing work on Verkle while shipping a smaller feature fork.\n\nThe final decision will hinge on community consensus and ongoing discussions in future meetings.\n\nACDE#178 just wrapped up (hello 2024!): we confirmed the testnet upgrade timelines for Dencun, appetite for Verkle as the next L1 prio, and had an open floor for other proposals for the Prague upgrade. Agenda: https://t.co/iHrS7vkmhH\n\nStream: https://t.co/oZPtQ5pO5W Recap below: https://t.co/Q8ZXH6Uhbq \u2014 \u064b (@lightclients) January 4, 2024\n\nThe potential impact of these developments on Ethereum is significant, indicating a commitment to ongoing improvement and innovation within the network. The upcoming upgrades are poised to enhance Ethereum\u2019s capabilities and overall functionality.\n\nMoreover, these upgrades could have an impact on price movement. Due to this, there is some volatility to be expected from ETH down the road.\n\nThe ETF hype continues\n\nAnother aspect that could add to the volatility would be Ethereum-based ETFs.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart suggested that the SEC\u2019s approval of the Ethereum futures ETF last year hinted at accepting ETH as a commodity, potentially paving the way for an ETH spot ETF launch in 2024.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s final decision on VanEck, ARK 21Shares, and Hashdex Ethereum Spot ETFs is expected in May 2024, introducing new dynamics to Ethereum\u2019s market.\n\nHere we go \u2026 expect more spot #ethereum ETFs filings in the coming days. NOTE: this is an S-1 and not a 19b-4. Which means it does not start a clock in any way \u2026 yet. Expect 19b-4\u2019s soon. https://t.co/sNus2vr5qV \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) September 6, 2023\n\nTrading behaviors\n\nThe put-to-call ratio for ETH fell from 0.37 to 0.35, indicating shifting sentiments in the options market. This change suggests an optimistic view among investors, showing that most traders haven\u2019t been affected by the prospects of increased volatility in the future.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $2,361.39, reflecting a -1.21% decline in the last 24 hours.\n\nDespite short-term fluctuations, Ethereum\u2019s long-term prospects appear positive, driven by ongoing development efforts, potential ETF developments, and evolving market dynamics."

        "content": "Recent data from CryptoDiffer reveals that Cardano (ADA) has taken a substantial lead in the average daily size of developer activity on GitHub over the past month, surpassing Ethereum (ETH) by 245%. With an average daily GitHub commit size of 449, Cardano is setting the pace in the development race, leaving Ethereum's daily average of 183 behind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis development not only solidifies Cardano's position but also positions it as a frontrunner in blockchain innovation, outperforming other projects such as Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR), which trails with a daily GitHub commit size of 282.\n\nThe significance lies in the potential impact on ADA's market performance. A more active development phase typically correlates with increased functionality and utility. As Cardano attracts more developers, there is an expectation of heightened demand and usage for its native blockchain token, ADA.\n\nDevelopment first\n\nAnalysts believe that Cardano's current development surge is a positive indicator of a growing ecosystem. The project's focus on improving interoperability and fostering collaboration through global workshops has contributed to its leading position in the blockchain-oriented landscape.\n\nWhile the precise impact on the ADA price remains uncertain, the correlation between development activity and token demand suggests a positive trajectory for Cardano. As the project continues to outpace competitors in development, the crypto community anticipates further advancements and innovations from Cardano in the decentralized finance space."

        "content": "The total time taken to fully exit and receive staked ETH surged over 13.5 days.\n\nThe backlog was likely created by Celsius Network.\n\nWaiting time for Ethereum [ETH] validators to withdraw their staked ETH shot up dramatically in the last 24 hours, reaching levels not seen since the option was made available following the Shapella Upgrade last year.\n\nUnstaking queue gets crowded\n\nAs of this writing, a validator would have to wait for nearly five days to exit the network and become eligible for withdrawals, AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of validatorqueue.com dashboard revealed.\n\nThe waiting time surged due to an exponential jump in validators in the exit queue. Indeed, the backlog increased to over 16,766 on the 5th of January, compared to just 26 a day before.\n\nMoreover, the total time taken to fully exit and receive the staked amount was more than 13.5 days, AMBCrypto discovered using data from rated.network.\n\nAs per the withdrawal mechanism, validators need to raise an exit request manually to be eligible for full withdrawals i.e, getting both initial deposits plus profits.\n\nHowever, upon completion of the process, they lose the right to validate transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nCelsius slows down ETH unstaking operations\n\nApparently, the backlog was created as a result of bankrupt cryptocurrency lender Celsius Network\u2019s plans of going ahead with its unstaking plans.\n\nThe company, which filed for bankruptcy protection in July 2022, said that it was rebalancing assets. This was to ensure Celsius had sufficient liquidity under the bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nAMBCrypto noticed using Nansen data that about 31.5% of all the ETH waiting for withdrawal was initiated by Celsius. Moreover, the 53.8% share by Figment was also linked to Celsius, as per popular on-chain researcher Tom Wan.\n\nOverall, the amount of staked ETH was 29.19 million as of this writing, with as many as 910,225 active validators.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nSigns of FUD?\n\nTypically, such large-scale unlockings are taken with a pinch of salt by market participants. Well, this was because of the belief that they would be sold off.\n\nPerhaps the anxiety played into the minds of weak hands as ETH slipped 1.39% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. But it remained to be seen if the FUD gets bigger in the days to come."

        "content": "ETH stored off exchanges outweighted the custodial coins.\n\nA 50% rally may open if exchange inflow reduces and volatility remains high.\n\nThe number of large addresses holding Ethereum [ETH] held on non-exchange wallets tapped a new All-Time High (ATH), AMBCrypto noted.\n\nIn the same vein, the top 150 exchange wallets have been decreasing. On-chain data from Santiment also showed that the exchange wallets could be on the verge of hitting the lowest point since June 2018.\n\nAt press time, the supply held by the top non-exchange addresses was 43.41 million. This increase is a sign that many market participants are buying ETH at a fast rate.\n\nAlso, keeping the altcoin in self-custody and shredding the number held on exchanges means that the intent to sell was almost non-existent.\n\nSellers need to take a break\n\nThis was evident in Ethereum\u2019s price action. As of this writing, ETH changed hands at$2,261, due to the drawback experienced on the 3rd of January. But with rising accumulation, the coin might be on its way to retest the $2,444 resistance.\n\nIf ETH hits and breaks the resistance, there is a high chance that the price will cross the $2,500 mark. In the long term, many predictions agree that the altcoin price would melt faces.\n\nBut the projected rally might not happen in the short term. This was because of the exchange inflow and outflow. At the time of writing, ETH\u2019s exchange inflow was 36,000. On the other hand, the exchange outflow was 25,000.\n\nAMBCrypto uncovered that the recent selling pressure Ethereum faced was the reason the inflow outpaced the outflows. If ETH is starting to eye $2,500, then the selling pressure must decrease.\n\nETH is volatile but promising\n\nLike the exchange flow, the Ethereum seven-day Realized Volatility showed that buying the coin for the short term could be risky. Realized Volatility shows the standard deviation of returns from the mean return of a market.\n\nWhen the value is low the Realized Volatility indicate a phase of low risk in that market. As a measure of the log returns over a certain window, the metric reading at 58.18% indicated that price fluctuations might be extreme for now.\n\nSo, traders targeting short-term gains may need to halt opening long or short contracts for now. If they do, they could end up biting their fingers in regret.\n\nHowever, the mid to long term looks promising for the Ethereum clan. This was confirmed by the state of the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) as shown by the daily chart.\n\nAs of this writing, the 50 EMA (blue) had crossed over the 200 EMA (yellow). This position is considered bullish for those planning on HODLing ETH. Should the position remain the same, then ETH may jump 50% in a few months while crossing the $3,000 mark.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nAnother indicator considered is the Supertrend. At press time, the Supertrend indicator was below ETH\u2019s price. This confirms the bearish trend initially mentioned.\n\nBut as highlighted earlier, the trend is not a sign for traders to open short positions, irrespective of the RSI\u2019s decrease."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) transaction fees surged in 2023 and continue at higher levels. Facing expensive transaction costs, people started seeking more efficient cryptocurrencies to use as payment, like Litecoin (LTC).\n\nIn this context, monthly payment data by one of the largest cryptocurrency payment services, BitPay, evidences this phenomenon.\n\nNotably, the platform\u2019s users favored Litecoin by 38.25% in December, surpassing Bitcoin (23.24%) and Ethereum (10.45%). This trend started in November 2023 when LTC dominated 34.52% of BitPay payments, against 30.55% using BTC.\n\nPayment count by cryptocurrency. Source: BitPay\n\nAdditionally, Dogecoin (DOGE) got fourth place with 7.38% of BitPay users\u2019 transactions in December 2023. Followed closely by Bitcoin Cash (BCH), with 6.18%; Polygon (MATIC), with 5.09%; and Circle USD (USDC), with 2.07%.\n\nBitPay relevancy on cryptocurrency payments\n\n\u201cBitPay is the leading crypto payment processor in the world.\u201d \u2014 BitPay\n\nBitPay\u2019s relevancy is notable, with reportedly 390,401 crypto transactions processed over the last six months. In December, the platform processed 51,896 payments with cryptocurrencies, of which 19,850 used Litecoin.\n\n6-month and 30-day crypto transactions processed. Source: BitPay\n\nFurther data on Litecoin, Bitcoin, and Ethereum payments\n\n\u201cLitecoin is the cryptocurrency most commonly used for transactions\u201d \u2014 BitPay\n\nInterestingly, data from BitInfoCharts, retrieved by Finbold on January 6, shows a similar dominance for Litecoin transactions.\n\nIn particular, the Litecoin network had $1.23 billion sent in 525,888 transactions in the last 24 hours. This amount accrues for 25.28% of LTC\u2019s market cap, according to BitInfoCharts.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin had $15.88 billion sent in 418,600 transactions, for 1.86% of its capitalization. Meanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s volume was lower than $3 billion, representing less than 1% of its market cap. Nevertheless, the number of transactions on the Ethereum network surpassed the 1 million daily mark.\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin transactions data. Source: BitInfoCharts\n\nIn closing, Litecoin started earning protagonism in the realm of cryptocurrency payments. This is mostly due to Bitcoin\u2019s inefficiencies as a medium of exchange, with users migrating to more efficient alternatives."

        "content": "An Ethereum (ETH)-based altcoin that\u2019s flying under the radar is moving against the largely bearish crypto price action this week after surging over 110% in the past seven days.\n\nPower Ledger (POWR) is a blockchain that\u2019s designed for decentralized and distributed energy markets.\n\nThe project\u2019s native token, POWR, is trading at nearly $0.737 at time of writing, a massive rise from its weekly low of $0.35. The 171st-ranked crypto asset by market cap is also up nearly 25% in the past 24 hours alone.\n\nAccording to Powerledger\u2019s official website, the crypto project aims to aid the decentralization of the energy grid, help transition toward renewable energy and assist consumers in keeping track of their power usage.\n\nPOWR\u2019s gains materialized amid this week\u2019s unveiling of xGrid 2.0, the latest version of Powerledger\u2019s blockchain-enabled energy trading platform.\n\nThe project says the new trading platform has a \u201cmodern and minimalistic\u201d user interface (UI) and increased flexibility with demand and percentage-based secondary market power purchase agreements (PPA).\n\nPPAs are typically used for renewable energy sources and consist of third-party developers installing and operating energy systems on their customers\u2019 properties, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The customer can receive low-cost energy while the developer gets to sell excess electricity from the system.\n\nDespite POWR\u2019s gains this week, the token remains more than 61% down from its all-time high of $1.89, which it hit all the way back in January 2018, according to CoinGecko.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The Ethereum network is on the cusp of a major upgrade, one that is set to bring significant improvements and changes to the platform. This upcoming update is called the Prague upgrade, also referred to as the Pectra upgrade, and has been a hot topic in the Ethereum community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTestnets are essential staging grounds for new features, and the Dencun upgrade will first roll out across several testnets: Goerli on Jan. 17, Sepolia on Jan. 30 and Holesky on Feb. 7, 2024. These testnets will allow developers to fine-tune the upgrade in a controlled environment, ensuring everything operates smoothly before going live on the main network.\n\nThe core development team is currently in a debate over prioritizing the implementation of Verkle trees, a data structure that would optimize storage and access to information on Ethereum. While some developers advocate making Verkle trees the sole focus, others suggest pursuing a smaller feature fork alongside the Verkle development.\n\nThe main argument for concentrating solely on Verkle trees stems from their complexity and the time investment needed to implement them effectively. This could mean that if Verkle trees become the next priority, no new execution layer (EL) features might appear for 12 to 24 months, or possibly longer.\n\nNevertheless, there is an understanding that even if the focus shifts to Verkle trees, minor updates to the Ethereum Layer (EL) might still be necessary. For example, changes to the gas limit for data availability are crucial for Ethereum's scaling solutions and require coordination across both the execution layer and the consensus layer (CL).\n\nThe Prague upgrade is set to include various proposals that aim to refine the Ethereum platform on different layers, including precompiles for specific cryptographic operations, a new EVM object format (EOF) and modifications to smart contract capabilities.\n\nThe Prague upgrade promises to be a significant event that will shape the future of the Ethereum ecosystem. It is a step forward in ensuring that Ethereum continues to offer a secure, efficient and scalable platform for decentralized applications."

        "content": "Arbitrum Surpasses Ethereum Mainnet in Milestone Achievement Jan 6, 2024\n\nArbitrum Surpasses Ethereum Mainnet in Milestone Achievement\n\nIn a noteworthy development highlighting the escalating adoption of Ethereum layer 2 blockchains, Arbitrum, the largest in terms of market capitalization, has achieved a significant milestone by surpassing the Ethereum mainnet. This milestone was marked by Arbitrum\u2019s decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume exceeding that of Ethereum\u2019s mainnet, a first for Arbitrum or any layer 2 blockchain. According to DefiLlama data, Arbitrum\u2019s DEX volume reached $1.8 billion, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s by nearly $400 million.\n\nArbitrum\u2019s Impressive Growth and Achievements:\n\nArbitrum\u2019s recent success is part of a broader surge in the blockchain\u2019s performance. In the past week, Arbitrum achieved three all-time highs in total value locked (TVL), DEX volume, and the spot price of its native token, ARB. TVL, indicating the investments locked in a blockchain or DeFi protocol, surged, making Arbitrum the leader in net inflow of investor funds among all layer 2 blockchains, securing $365 million in the last seven days. Ethereum still leads in this metric with $705 million, as reported by DefiLlama.\n\nChallenges Faced by Arbitrum:\n\nDespite these accomplishments, Arbitrum has faced challenges, including several outages. The most recent occurred in December and was attributed to issues with the blockchain\u2019s Sequencer, a component used to verify, organize, and transfer transaction bundles to the Ethereum mainnet for finality. It\u2019s noteworthy that similar problems were faced by ZkSync, another Ethereum layer 2, around Christmas.\n\nLayer 2 Growth Across Ethereum Ecosystem:\n\nBeyond Arbitrum\u2019s gains, Ethereum\u2019s layer 2s have witnessed substantial growth. With a combined TVL of $20.7 billion, these layer 2 networks surpass the TVL of all other layer 1 networks, excluding Ethereum, which stands at $19.7 billion. However, it\u2019s essential to note a discrepancy in TVL valuation sources, as L2Beat includes the market value of native tokens in layer 2 figures, whereas DefiLlama considers only the value of investments in layer 1 blockchains\u2019 decentralized finance markets.\n\nPositive Impacts on Ethereum Mainnet:\n\nWhile some layer 2s show signs of challenging Ethereum\u2019s dominance, these developments are not necessarily detrimental to the mainnet. On the contrary, they contribute positively to Ethereum\u2019s economic outcomes. Increased validator earnings result from layer 2 networks paying fees when rolling up bundled transactions to the Ethereum mainnet for finality. This process contributes to the deflationary mechanisms for Ether token supply, aligning with Ethereum\u2019s overall strategy for reducing net Ether token inflation.\n\nConclusion:\n\nArbitrum\u2019s achievement in surpassing Ethereum\u2019s mainnet in trading volume showcases the growing prominence of layer 2 blockchains. Despite challenges, the successes of layer 2 networks contribute positively to Ethereum\u2019s economic landscape, reinforcing its position as a leader in the blockchain industry."

        "title": "ETF Analyst: Approval of Ethereum Spot ETF in US Could Happen This Year - Coinspeaker",
        "content": "The imminent approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs in the United States is expected to pave the way for more fund managers to apply for Ethereum spot ETFs in the near future.\n\nThe approval of several Ethereum (ETH) futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States in October last year undeniably paved the way for spot ETFs in the near future. According to Bloomberg\u2019s ETF and crypto analyst James Seyffart, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) cleared the way for spot Ethereum\u2019s ETF, having implicitly classified Ether as a commodity through its actions. Notably, crypto leaders in the United States are pushing for most digital assets to be classified as commodities in a bid to avoid the stiff regulations associated with securities.\n\n\u201cThe CFTC is blatantly calling Ethereum a commodity. They do not call them securities. The SEC has approved Ethereum futures ETFs. So again, Gary Gensler will not explicitly say whether Ethereum is a security or a commodity, but in their action, by approving those Ethereum futures ETFs, they\u2019re implicitly accepting those Ethereum futures as commodities futures,\u201d Seyffart noted.\n\nThe Grayscale Investments\u2019 court win against the US SEC on the spot Bitcoin ETF ruling has significantly changed the agency\u2019s approach to the cryptocurrency industry. Consequently, should the US SEC approve the dozens of spot Bitcoin ETFs on Friday, the approval of Ether\u2019s spot ETF will significantly increase. Moreover, the US political leaders want to get the attention of the 52 million plus Americans invested in cryptocurrencies by favoring policy changes. Additionally, Seyffart noted that the US SEC does not want to contradict its sister agency, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which has already signaled that Ethereum is a commodity.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t just be the SEC going against the crypto industry. If they call Ethereum security, it\u2019ll be going against their sister regulator, CFTC. That\u2019s why I think we could see potential Ethereum ETFs approved this year as well,\u201d the analyst added.\n\nMarket Implication on Ethereum and Price Action\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem has grown to a mature network providing liquidity to the majority of web3 tokens. With a market cap of about $279 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of around $18 billion, the king of smart contracts has more room for growth in the coming years, fueled by institutional investors. In case the US SEC approves the dozen spot Bitcoin ETF applications, Ethereum\u2019s price will rise in tandem with the flagship coin. Additionally, the Ether rise will even be more violent after the US SEC approves the Ethereum spot ETFs.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum is a deflationary coin with high demand from all around the world. According to a recent report by CoinShares, Ethereum\u2019s investment products registered a cash inflow of about $78 million in 2023, and the rate is anticipated to spike further in the coming years amid the crypto bullish sentiments."

        "content": "Blockchain analytics firm Nansen reports that almost a third of the ETH in the pending withdrawal queue belongs to Celsius, totaling 206,300 ETH valued at approximately $468.5 million at current prices.\n\nCelsius Network, a once prominent but bankrupt crypto lender, has announced plans to unstake a substantial amount of Ethereum (ETH) in the coming days to offset costs incurred during its restructuring process. This decision comes after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 2022, following a liquidity crisis triggered by the volatile crypto market.\n\nThe Celsius Network Ethereum Unstaking Plans\n\nCelsius Network revealed in a follow-up post on X that \u201cthe significant unstaking activity in the next few days will unlock ETH to ensure timely distributions to creditors\u201d. The Ethereum holdings, previously staked by the company, have served as an income stream to offset costs incurred during the restructuring process.\n\nThis development is particularly welcomed by customers who have patiently awaited the return of their funds for over 18 months. According to the firm, as part of the recovery plan, Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum will be distributed to the creditors.\n\nBlockchain analytics firm Nansen reports that almost a third of the ETH in the pending withdrawal queue belongs to Celsius, totaling 206,300 ETH valued at approximately $468.5 million at current prices. While concerns have been raised about potential market impact due to a large sell-off, some view the move as positive for the Ethereum markets in the long run.\n\nIn November 2023, Celsius Network outlined a scaled-back post-bankruptcy strategy focusing on Bitcoin mining. The plan to shift towards Bitcoin mining, however, has faced skepticism from some creditors, and regulatory hurdles still need to be cleared, including approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nAt the time, Celsius acknowledged the regulatory requirements and mentioned that if the mining venture doesn\u2019t proceed, an alternative plan for liquidation may be implemented. However, with a settlement plan approved by a Federal Judge, Celsius Network has allowed qualified users to withdraw 72.5% of their crypto until Feb. 28.\n\nAccording to court filings from September, approximately 58,300 users held $210 million in what the court categorized as \u201ccustody assets.\u201d The move is seen as a step towards fulfilling the commitments made under the recovery plan.\n\nCelsius\u2019 Founder\u2019s Legal Troubles\n\nMeanwhile, the founder and former CEO of Celsius Alex Mashinsky, who is facing fraud charges and is currently out on bail, is scheduled for a jury trial on September 17. Though, with less impact, his legal situation adds another layer of complexity to Celsius Network\u2019s already difficult journey.\n\nIn December, Celsius Network entered into an interim agreement with Bitcoin mining company Hut 8. The agreement involves Hut 8 constructing and deploying new mining operation centers in Cedarvale, Texas, for Celsius creditors. The facility is expected to host approximately 66,000 miners, powered by a robust energy supply exceeding 215 megawatts at full operational capacity.\n\nThe partnership with Hut 8 signals a potential avenue for Celsius Network to recover and move forward, emphasizing the resilience of the crypto industry amid challenges."

Its ICO has so far raised $7.9 million.\n\nInQubeta: Empowering an ecosystem of AI startups\n\nInQubeta enables people to safely invest in startups and shape the future of AI innovation. It has a simple investment model that takes care of all stakeholders\u2019 requirements.\n\nUsing Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts, InQubeta provides a transparent NFT marketplace that allows fractional investment. By purchasing a fraction of the NFT, a user can invest in a part of a startup\u2019s project. All transactions, including the sale of NFTs and deduction of taxes, are conducted in terms of InQubeta\u2019s native cryptocurrency, the QUBE token.\n\nThe total supply of QUBE is fixed at 1.5 billion, and the QUBE token is built on the ERC-20 standard.\n\nMore than half of the supply has been allocated for public sale, while the rest goes towards operations. The remaining stock of tokens is used for paying legal advisors, and developers, funding marketing campaigns, injecting liquidity into the network, and paying staking rewards.\n\nThe QUBE token has a deflationary character that\u2019s handy for countering the impact of inflation. The model reduces supply whenever inflation is high. As demand exceeds the supply, the price remains stable. If the supply surges when markets are volatile, the supply is pruned by destroying excess tokens in circulation.\n\nInQubeta leverages a decentralized governance structure for decision-making. The model favors a community-driven approach where all stakeholders participate in decisions. If anyone has a suggestion on how to improve the InQubeta protocol, they can run it by the community. The suggestions are discussed and then put to a vote.\n\nAs token holders have voting rights, they participate in the process to decide if the suggestions should be implemented.\n\nStartups and investors can communicate through InQubeta\u2019s NFT portal. The marketplace facilitates fractional investment in startup projects. The NFTs are based on the offers created by companies for investors. They stand for the rewards that an investor can gain by backing a startup\u2019s project.\n\nFunding aside, these startups can bank on InQubeta to guide them in areas like business development, legal support, and mentorship. InQubeta ropes in experts in various fields to assist startups in expanding operations.\n\nInnovators can connect AI experts and investors to gain insights about the sector. They could seek legal and accounting support to avoid financial challenges during their growth journeys.\n\nThe team has mapped several initiatives for 2024 to ramp up the platform. These include rolling out a staking dApp, getting the QUBE token listed on exchanges, and adding multi-chain capabilities to the network.\n\nAccording to analysts, InQubeta is among the altcoins to watch out for, and its presale success is just a peek into its future potential.\n\nVitalik Buterin proposes new Ethereum vision to tackle design weakness\n\nEthereum is a full-scale ecosystem that can be leveraged for deploying dApps, crypto tokens, NFTs, blockchains, and other decentralized infrastructure. Due to Ethereum\u2019s versatility and flexibility, it can be used in combination with other leading technologies like zero-knowledge solutions.\n\nIts native token, ETH, is used for all transactions on the network. These transactions are confirmed through the proof-of-stake consensus protocol.\n\nEthereum is among the best cryptocurrencies to buy in 2024 as it can open multiple new avenues for developers. Its co-founder Vitalik Buterin is known for his keen insight into the blockchain industry. He recently hinted at a new vision for Ethereum, which fixes its design weaknesses.\n\nTraders have forecasted a record 141% upside for ETH as it has come up with many new interesting updates and remains one of the most popular cryptocurrencies preferred by many users across the world.\n\nConclusion\n\nAnalysts often recommend Ethereum and InQubeta, as these tokens can end all your concerns about deciding what cryptos to buy now. These two tokens can be added to diversify portfolios and potentially register huge gains in the long term.\n\nEthereum is a developer-friendly blockchain technology, and InQubeta is a user-friendly platform for AI startups. Together they prove that cryptocurrencies are not a convoluted affair. Instead, they are quite straightforward assets that promote financial independence.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities\n\nDisclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

        "content": "Celsius has decided to unstake its ETH holdings to repay its creditors.\n\nThe last week has seen a decline in demand for ETH.\n\nIn a series of posts on X, bankrupt cryptocurrency lender Celsius Network [CEL] announced plans to unstake its Ether [ETH] holdings as a part of its ongoing restructuring process.\n\nIn preparation of any asset distributions, Celsius has started the process of recalling and rebalancing assets to ensure ample liquidity \u2014 Celsius (@CelsiusNetwork) January 4, 2024\n\nThe beleaguered crypto lender, which has been in bankruptcy court since it made its Chapter 11 filing in July 2022, noted that it has initiated a process of recalling and rebalancing assets to guarantee that it has sufficient liquidity to offset its liabilities under the bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nCelsius added that the unlocking event is expected to take place within the next few days. It further said that eligible creditors will receive in-kind distributions of Bitcoin [BTC] and ETH as per the approved restructuring plan.\n\nEthereum at risk?\n\nAccording to data from Nansen, 32% of ETH coins awaiting withdrawal are currently linked to Celsius. This accounts for a substantial 206,300 ETH, valued at about $468.5 million based on the leading altcoin\u2019s current price.\n\nWith such a large volume of coins ready to be released onto the market, some believe that it would put downward pressure on ETH\u2019s price. Others, however, opined that it might benefit the ETH market once Celsius concludes its restructuring efforts.\n\nAs of this writing, ETH exchanged hands at $2,250. The alt has witnessed a 5% drop in value in the last week, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe coin\u2019s momentum indicators observed on a 24-hour chart have trended downward since the year began, suggesting a decline in buying momentum since then. At press time, ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 48.82, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) was 54.74.\n\nIts Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) spotted below the zero line confirmed that traders have increasingly removed liquidity from ETH markets. Fears of a blanket SEC rejection of Bitcoin ETFs could be driving this capital removal.\n\nA significantly positive correlation exists between BTC and ETH. Hence, should the rejection result in a decline in BTC\u2019s price, ETH\u2019s price is sure to witness a retraction as well.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThe coin\u2019s negative directional index (red) rested above the positive directional index (green) at the time of writing. This suggested that selling pressure exceeded coin accumulation.\n\nThese lines have been so positioned since 3rd January, corresponding with the decline in demand."

        "content": "On-chain data shows the largest of the Ethereum whales have continued to buy more recently as their supply sets another new all-time high.\n\nLargest Ethereum Wallets Have Been Rapidly Accumulating\n\nAccording to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the largest non-exchange Ethereum wallets have continued to show some rapid accumulation recently.\n\nThe relevant indicator here is the \u201csupply held by top non-exchange addresses,\u201d which keeps track of the total amount of Ethereum that the 150 largest self-custodial wallets are carrying in their combined balance right now.\n\nNaturally, the 150 largest non-exchange wallets would belong to the top whale entities of the network. As such, the trend in the metric can provide hints about the sentiment around the cryptocurrency among these humongous holders.\n\nWhen the indicator goes up, it means that these whales are expanding their holdings currently. Such a trend naturally suggests that they are bullish on the asset at the moment.\n\nOn the other hand, the metric registering a decline can be bad news for the cryptocurrency\u2019s price, as it implies that these large investors have decided to participate in some selling.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the supply held by the top non-exchange Ethereum addresses over the past couple of years:\n\nLooks like the metric's value has been constantly going up during the last few months | Source: Santiment on X\n\nAs displayed in the above graph, the supply held by these top 150 whales has been rapidly going up since April 2023. This would suggest that the rally in the early months of the year caught the attention of these large entities, leading them to accumulate.\n\nInterestingly, the slump between August and October was also not enough to dissuade these holders, as they only continued to buy more. Likewise, these whales have continued to push through the latest plunge in the cryptocurrency\u2019s price as well.\n\nAfter the most recent buying spree, the supply of these top non-exchange Ethereum wallets has reached 56.25 million ETH, which is a new all-time high for the indicator.\n\nIn the same chart, the analytics firm has also attached the data for the supply held by the top exchange addresses. This metric naturally measures the total number of coins that wallets attached to centralized platforms are carrying currently.\n\nWhile the self-custodial whales have ramped up their supply, the top 150 exchange-bound wallets have moved flat in the same period. At present, this indicator has a value of 9.46 million ETH right now, which is nearly the lowest level observed since June 2018.\n\nGenerally, one of the main reasons why investors deposit their coins to exchanges is for selling purposes. So the supply of these exchange whales remaining low is a positive sign.\n\nThe rapid accumulation that the self-custodial whale entities are showing, combined with the fact that the top exchange wallets are at low levels, could mean the long-term outlook may be optimistic for Ethereum.\n\nETH Price\n\nWhile Bitcoin has already made some recovery from its crash, Ethereum has only been able to rebound a bit so far, as its price is trading around the $2,250 level.\n\nThe price of the asset appears to have been mostly moving flat since the plummet | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Flavio on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) validator exit queue attained an all-time high at 16,400 amid plans of Celsius ETH staking withdrawal. The waiting time for validators in the queue had extended to more than 5 days. This abrupt surge in validator exit queues could be linked to Celsius, the bankrupt crypto lending platform. The crypto lender recently confirmed its initiation of recalling and rebalancing crypto assets, including Ethereum to repay its creditors.\n\nCelsius ETH Unstaking Plans\n\nCelsius, entrenched in bankruptcy proceedings since its Chapter 11 filing in July 2022, has strategically begun shifting assets to guarantee ample liquidity in anticipation of potential asset distributions. Thereafter, in a recent post on X, Celsius wrote, \u201cThe significant unstaking activity in the next few days will unlock ETH to ensure timely distributions to creditors.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nThis comes after the firm announced that their creditors would receive BTC and ETH distributions, according to the approved plan. Moreover, the latest move by Celsius carries positive implications for customers who have patiently awaited the return of their funds after 18 months of uncertainty.\n\nThe liberated Ethereum from this unstaking operation will serve a dual purpose for Celsius. Apart from repaying creditors, it will be employed to offset certain costs incurred throughout the restructuring process, providing financial maneuverability.\n\nAlso Read: Judge Approves Celsius Network\u2019s Shift to Bitcoin Mining Company\n\nAccording to data from Nansen, a blockchain analytics organization, nearly one-third of the ETH currently in the pending withdrawal queue is attributable to Celsius. The crypto lender\u2019s 32% share accounts for a staggering 206,300 ETH. Its withdrawal share is valued at approximately $467 million based on the price of $2264.64 at press time.\n\nETH Validator Exit Queue Spike\n\nFurthermore, Nansen data revealed that 19,906 validators were awaiting a complete exit a few hours before the massive validator exit queue was cleared. In addition, the stats noted that a total of 637,564 ETH staking was awaiting a full exit.\n\nAccording to Validator Queue analytics, 16,425 validators exited staked ETH positions on Friday, January 5, 2024. Additionally, it\u2019s worth noting that the unprecedented spike led to an all-time high in the validator exit queue on Beacon Chain. The wait time for clearing the queue was recorded to be 5 days\n\nThe recent spike comes exactly a month after the ETH validator queue recorded a peak in December. The network witnessed an exit of 3,829 validators on December 5, 2023. Currently, the number of active validators is 905,879. Moreover, the total staked ETH figure exceeds 28.9 million, representing 24.05% of the total supply.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Layer-2 Transactions Skyrocket 330% In 2023, ARB And OP Take The Lead"

        "content": "ETH witnessed its highest drop in over two months.\n\nThe Ethereum in profit has gone below 80%.\n\nEthereum [ETH] experienced a significant decline in its price, leading to a corresponding decrease in profit supply.\n\nEthereum sees highest drop in months\n\nOn the 2nd of January, Ethereum faced a notable decrease of over 6%, settling at about $2,210 based on a daily timeframe chart. The chart analysis showed a positive start to the year, with some intermittent declines up to the 2nd of January.\n\nHowever, the most recent dip marked the steepest drop observed in the past few weeks.\n\nAdditionally, this price drop caused the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to fall below the neutral line. As of this writing, the RSI remained below the line despite a slight uptick in the price.\n\nThe price was around $2,230, with less than a 1% increase as of this writing. Also, the short-moving average (yellow line) continued to act as support for now. Nevertheless, this support could shift if the price falls below the existing range.\n\nEthereum sees more outflows\n\nSurprisingly, Ethereum witnessed increased outflows on the 3rd of January, even in the face of a declining price. Leading up to this date, there was a prevailing trend of inflows, signifying a greater influx of ETH into exchanges for potential sale.\n\nHowever, this pattern shifted on the 3rd of January, with over 22,000 ETH leaving exchanges. The netflow on exchanges remains positive, albeit marginally, indicating a higher sales volume.\n\nIt is notable that, at press time, there was no evident indication of an imminent sell-off.\n\nETH supply in profit takes a slight beating\n\nThe impact of the price decline extended to the Ethereum supply in profit. AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of the supply in profit on Santiment showed a significant reduction in the volume of ETH that was in a profitable position.\n\nBefore the 3rd of January, the supply in profit was over 110 million ETH, constituting over 84% of the total supply.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nHowever, by the conclusion of the day on the 3rd of January, this figure had decreased to around 107 million, accounting for about 82% of the supply.\n\nAs of this writing, the supply in profit had further reduced to around 104 million, representing about 79% of the total supply."

        "title": "Tether Investors' Surge Towards Mollars, Ethereum\u2019s New Store-of-Value Token - Baltimore Post-Examiner",
        "content": "A new cryptocurrency, still in its initial coin offering (view ico here) stage & scheduled to debut on the Ethereum Blockchain in 2024, is quickly gaining a lot of notoriety among crypto enthusiasts. Branded \u201cMollars\u201d, this crypto project aims to position itself as the ERC-20 network\u2019s new Bitcoin or being more technical, a decentralized Store-of-Value token.\n\nThe token remains in its presale phase and has been steadily accumulating sales each day, nearing the completion of its initial funding round. Notably, among the communities expressing significant interest in Mollars are the holders of Tether (USDT).\n\nWhat Are Store of Value Tokens?\n\nOne of the most fascinating aspects about cryptocurrencies is that, even though at their core they are different from commodities like gold or assets like stock, they are still able to fulfill the roles of these types of assets with a faster and more decentralized exchange platform.\n\nStore-of-Value (SoV) cryptocurrencies are inherently characterized by their limited supply, akin to precious commodities such as gold. These digital tokens, exemplified by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) , possess a predetermined maximum issuance, fostering scarcity similar to finite resources. This scarcity factor contributes to their perception as a secure and enduring form of value storage. It also fosters trust and utility akin to traditional assets, despite their intangible nature. The confidence in their finite supply reinforces their role as reliable instruments for wealth preservation in the ever-evolving landscape of decentralized finance.\n\nWhat Makes Mollars an SoV?\n\nMollars boasts several key features that solidify its standing in the crypto market. Firstly, its decentralized nature aligns with the ethos of cryptocurrencies, having no central ownership, thereby promoting trust and autonomy among users.\n\nWith a capped total supply of only 10,000,000 tokens, scarcity plays a pivotal role in establishing its value, making it one of the [SOV] cryptos with the most limited supply to ever enter the blockchain. The token\u2019s debut on the ERC-20 leverages the network\u2019s technological prowess, offering advanced transactional capabilities and minimal fees, appealing to investors seeking efficiency and cost-effectiveness in their transactions.\n\nThis scarcity, combined with Ethereum\u2019s robust infrastructure, positions Mollars as a potential safe haven from external volatility, potentially attracting both Ethereum blockchain enthusiasts and investors seeking long-term value preservation in a digital asset.\n\nTether Investors Are Buying Mollars\n\nAnalyzing Mollars\u2019 presale address, it is easy to spot a recent spike of buyers who are Tether ($USDT) holders. Every day, USDT investors are acquiring thousands of dollars in $MOLLARS.\n\nAs a stablecoin pegged to the dollar, Tether is commonly used as a medium between crypto and fiat, due to its stability. However, these types of crypto are unable to serve as an SoV digital currency due to the fact that it is \u2018centralized\u2019 around the U.S. Dollar.\n\nPerhaps for this reason, these holders are opting to acquire a currency that is positioning itself for tremendous growth as it enters the market, and also becomes the unofficial SoV for the World\u2019s most active and largest blockchain.\n\nUnderstanding Mollars Presale: Potential 10.000% ROI\n\nAfter only a couple of weeks, the project\u2019s presale has already sold nearly 60.000 tokens. This means that those who are looking to buy the currency have limited time to obtain $MOLLARS at $0.30.\n\nThe thirty-cent offer is limited to the first 100.000 tokens sold on the presale. Its second phase will offer the token for $0.40.\n\nIf the project can reach the presale hard cap, $MOLLARS will debut on the market with a price of $0.62. This means that investors obtaining the token at $0.30 can reach a 100% ROI right at the listing date.\n\nHowever, the true potential for holding this new token lies beyond its ICO. As an ownerless, safe, and limited supply token, Mollars has the potential to become the blockchain\u2019s go-to asset when investors are looking to keep their money stored in an asset that is poised to become deflationary over time.\n\nThe overwhelming interest from Tether holders during its presale could also symbolize a shift in investment approach in the market today. As the entire market grows in adoption, utility, and popularity, the idea of holding a crypto pegged to a fiat currency could become obsolete in the future.\n\nAs Mollars emerges as an alternative for everyone in the Ethereum Blockchain, and if it succeeds in becoming the platform\u2019s Store of Value, today\u2019s worth of $0.30 could be over 100 times higher.\n\nDiscuss the latest updates on Mollars with other token presale investors via social community reddit (r/MollarsToken).\n\nView the latest stats or purchase $MOLLARS before it lists on a public crypto exchange via Mollars.com \u2014 the official website."

        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is in a state of constant evolution, with both established players and new entrants vying for investor attention. Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is looking poised for a significant surge in 2024. Meanwhile, the emergence of new meme coins, like Rebel Satoshi (RBLZ), signals an intensifying competition in the meme coin arena, which is currently dominated by Dogecoin (DOGE).\n\nEthereum\u2019s Bullish Predictions\n\nEthereum has been a trailblazer in the crypto realm, known for its smart contract functionality and potential to revolutionize various industries. After recovering from the downturn of 2022, ETH is on the cusp of another potential rally. Experts from FieryTrading suggest that a breakout from its bullish triangle pattern could propel ETH to $5,000 by the close of 2024 or early 2025. Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou of JPMorgan further fueled the optimism, highlighting Ethereum\u2019s upcoming EIP-4844 upgrade, which could elevate its price to a staggering $8,000 by 2026. Even the notable crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe believes that while ETH might see minor corrections, it could touch the $3,400-$3,800 range in Q1 2024.\n\nDissenting Voices and Market Indicators\n\nHowever, not everyone is aboard the Ethereum hype train. Renowned trader Peter Brandt remains sceptical, emphasizing Ethereum\u2019s challenges with gas prices and its comparison with Bitcoin as a store of value. Additionally, market watchers have been keeping a keen eye on the ETH spot Ether ETF\u2019s potential approval, a development that could further boost Ethereum\u2019s value, with predictions suggesting a target of $3,210.05 by Q1 2024.\n\nRebel Satoshi (RBLZ) vs. Dogecoin (DOGE)\n\nWhile Ethereum continues its upward trajectory, the meme coin arena is witnessing fresh competition. Dogecoin, one of the top altcoins, with its iconic Shiba Inu branding, has long been the poster child of meme coins. However, Rebel Satoshi (RBLZ) is emerging as a formidable contender. Built on the Ethereum network, which offers robust security and functionality, Rebel Satoshi has quickly gained traction. With over 92 million $RBLZ sold and $1,000,000 raised, its citizens round 3 has exceeded the coveted $1.2 million mark. What sets Rebel Satoshi apart is its commitment to safety; its smart contracts have undergone rigorous auditing by the esteemed Source Hat auditing firm. This is one of the many reasons why it is regarded as the best meme coin.\n\nThe Rebel Satoshi Opportunity\n\nFor those looking to explore the meme coin space, Rebel Satoshi presents a promising opportunity. As it gears up to challenge giants like DOGE, early investors could potentially reap substantial rewards. Being on the Ethereum network further fortifies its credibility, given Ethereum\u2019s stature as one of the top crypto coins globally. If the current momentum is any indication, Rebel Satoshi\u2019s journey is one that investors won\u2019t want to miss.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\n2024 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for cryptocurrencies. While Ethereum gears up for a potential rally, new entrants like Rebel Satoshi are injecting fresh energy into the meme coin space. As always, while the crypto market promises lucrative opportunities, it\u2019s crucial for investors to conduct their due diligence and stay informed. Whether it\u2019s Ethereum\u2019s ascent or Rebel Satoshi\u2019s emergence, the crypto landscape continues to be as dynamic and exciting as ever.\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAmid the recent market recovery, Ethereum (ETH) has attracted attention as prominent whales embarked on a sizable accumulation of the crypto asset.\n\nOn-chain data from Santiment reveals a persistent trend among Ethereum\u2019s largest non-exchange wallets, indicating ongoing accumulation by the top 150 self-custodial whales.\n\nThe latest figures show an all-time high accumulation, with these whales currently holding 56.25 million ETH.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nInsights Into Massive Non-custodial Ethereum Accumulation\n\nA whale, identified by the address \u20180x931\u2019, accumulated ETH totalling 21,192 at an average price of $2,265, amounting to an investment of $48 million.\n\nSpot On Chain, a crypto analytics platform, revealed insights into this strategic accumulation. Notably, this whale has been actively purchasing Ethereum since January 13, 2023, amassing a total of 79,500 ETH at an average price of $1,790, with a total investment of $36.84 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8 Massive whale 0x931 spent $48M to buy 21,192 $ETH at $2,265 on avg ~2hrs ago.\n\n\n\nIn total, the whale has bought 79,500 $ETH from #DEX and #Binance at $1,790 on avg since Jan 13, 2023, with $36.84M (+25.9%) in unrealized profit.\n\n\n\nThe purchases were financed through revolving\u2026 pic.twitter.com/mD245C060o \u2014 Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) January 5, 2024\n\nThe accumulation strategy employed by this whale stands out for its precision in targeting specific retracement points, effectively maximizing potential uptrends. This calculated approach has proven successful, evidenced by the whale\u2019s favorable win rate derived from these strategic purchases.\n\nInterestingly, the acquisition strategy involves diverse sources, including leveraging revolving loans from the Aave lending protocol and liquidity resources.\n\nThe cumulative effect of this accumulation has yielded a significant unrealized profit of approximately 25.9% for the Ethereum whale. This substantial profit margin signals a considerable bullish position, showcasing the investor\u2019s confidence in Ethereum\u2019s prospects.\n\nThis surge in holdings by the largest non-exchange wallets has been steadily rising since April 2023, even during market downturns, showcasing a consistent pattern of accumulation.\n\nConcurrently, according to Santiment, the holdings of top exchange-bound wallets remain relatively stagnant at 9.46 million ETH, signalling minimal movement of coins to exchanges for selling purposes.\n\nIs a bullish price move imminent amid Spot ETF speculations?\n\nThe contrasting behaviours between the self-custodial whales and those tied to exchanges suggest differing strategies significant Ethereum investors pursue.\n\nThe continual accumulation by the self-custodial whales hints at a potential optimistic outlook for Ethereum\u2019s long-term trajectory.\n\nDespite Ethereum\u2019s current price hovering around $2,250, lagging behind Bitcoin\u2019s recovery from the recent market crash, the ongoing accumulation trend among Ethereum\u2019s largest wallets indicates a sustained interest and confidence among these significant investors.\n\nAmid these whale accumulations, the overarching optimism surrounding the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF has emerged as a notable market catalyst. The anticipated bullish sentiment accompanying a potential ETF approval for Bitcoin might trigger a broader market rally, potentially influencing Ethereum\u2019s price surge and aligning with BTC\u2019s movement."

        "title": "Ether (ETH): More Than Just a Cryptocurrency \u2013 The Fuel of the Ethereum Ecosystem - Punch Newspapers",
        "content": "In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, Ethereum stands as a titan. While Bitcoin may be the undisputed king, Ethereum offers something far more versatile: a platform for building decentralized applications (dApps) and powering a vibrant ecosystem that extends far beyond simple transactions. And the fuel that keeps this engine running? That\u2019s where Ether (ETH) comes in.\n\nBeyond a Currency:\n\nThink of ETH not just as a digital coin, but as the lifeblood of the Ethereum network. Every transaction, every smart contract execution, every interaction within the dApp universe requires ETH to function. It\u2019s the gas that powers the engine, the oil that keeps the gears turning.\n\nHere\u2019s how ETH plays its crucial role:\n\nTransactions: Sending ETH to another address incurs a transaction fee, paid in \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 ETH. These fees compensate miners (or validators in Ethereum 2.0) for verifying and securing the network.\n\nSmart Contract Execution: Deploying and executing smart contracts, the self-executing agreements that power dApps, also require ETH. The complexity of the contract and the computational resources it demands determine the fee.\n\nDApp Interaction: Whether you\u2019re playing a blockchain game, trading on a DeFi platform, or buying an NFT, most dApps require ETH for various functionalities within their ecosystems.\n\nMore Than Just Transactions: ETH\u2019s utility extends far beyond simple payments. It\u2019s the key that unlocks a world of possibilities within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi): Borrow, lend, trade, and earn interest on your crypto assets without intermediaries using DeFi protocols, all powered by ETH.\n\nNon-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): Own and trade unique digital assets like art, music, and collectibles with the security and transparency of the Ethereum blockchain, facilitated by ETH.\n\nDecentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): Participate in community-governed organizations without central authorities, using ETH for voting and contributing to the DAO\u2019s treasury.\n\nThe Metaverse: Explore and interact within virtual worlds built on the Ethereum network, buying land, participating in events, and engaging in the economy, all fueled by ETH.\n\nThe Future of Ethereum\n\nWith Ethereum 2.0 on the horizon, promising increased scalability and sustainability, ETH\u2019s future looks bright. As the dApp ecosystem continues to grow and evolve, ETH\u2019s demand and value are likely to soar.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to remember that ETH, like any cryptocurrency, is a volatile asset. Its price can fluctuate significantly, and investing in it carries inherent risks. Do your own research and invest responsibly.\n\nETH is more than just a cryptocurrency; it\u2019s the beating heart of the Ethereum ecosystem. It fuels the transactions, powers the dApps, and drives innovation across various sectors. As the blockchain revolution unfolds, ETH is poised to play a central role in shaping the future of finance, technology, and even society itself. So, the next time you hear about ETH, remember \u2013 it\u2019s not just a digital coin, it\u2019s the fuel that ignites the possibilities of a decentralized future."

Ethereum\u2019s market cap is $269.95 billion, and it holds a market dominance of 16.18%. Over the last 24 hours, the ETH price has seen a 0.48% increase. In the last seven days, the ETH price has decreased by -4.42%.\n\nOn November 10, 2021, Ethereum achieved its highest price of $4,867.17, while its lowest price was recorded on October 21, 2015, at $0.420897. The lowest price since its all-time high was $897.01 (cycle low), and the highest ETH price since the last cycle low reached $2,448.66 (cycle high). Currently, the sentiment for Ethereum\u2019s price prediction is neutral, and the Fear & Greed Index registers 72 (Greed).\n\nWith a circulating supply of 120.18 million ETH, Ethereum has a current yearly supply inflation rate of -1.79%, indicating that -2.19 million ETH were created in the last year. In the market cap ranking, Ethereum holds the top position in the Proof-of-Stake Coins sector and is ranked second in the Layer 1 sector.\n\n\u2014> CLICK HERE TO BUY ETH<\u2014\n\nCan the Ethereum price rise?\n\nOver the past year, Ethereum (ETH) has exhibited robust performance, witnessing a remarkable 79% increase in its price. Impressively, it outpaced 53% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies during this period, demonstrating its strength within the volatile crypto market. Trading consistently above the 200-day simple moving average signifies a sustained positive trend. The coin boasts high liquidity, as reflected in its substantial market capitalization.\n\nHowever, recent market trends reveal a degree of volatility, with only 14 green days in the last 30 days, accounting for 47% of the observed period. Moreover, ETH currently stands at a -54% decline from its all-time high, highlighting the challenges the cryptocurrency has faced in maintaining its peak valuation. These multifaceted indicators underscore the dynamic nature of Ethereum\u2019s journey in the crypto landscape.\n\nWill the ETH Price Hit $10,000 in 2024?\n\nOver the long term, positive trends, such as the circulating rumors surrounding a potential Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) by BlackRock, have the potential to significantly influence and drive the price of Ethereum (ETH) higher. The introduction of an ETF, particularly from a financial heavyweight like BlackRock, could enhance Ethereum\u2019s accessibility and appeal to a broader range of investors.\n\nSuch a development might instill confidence in the market, attracting institutional and retail investors alike, and potentially leading to increased demand for Ethereum. Positive sentiments surrounding strategic financial instruments often contribute to sustained upward momentum in the cryptocurrency market. As these rumors persist, they may act as a catalyst for increased adoption and investment, fostering a positive trajectory for Ethereum\u2019s price in the long run.\n\nThere is a possibility of another substantial surge in Ethereum\u2019s price in the upcoming months. Ethereum shares similar bullish factors with Bitcoin. The reduction in Bitcoin\u2019s supply due to the Bitcoin Halving and the potential introduction of spot ETFs could lead to a substantial increase in demand, potentially influencing Ethereum\u2019s price positively.\n\nPresently, the Ethereum price appears to be intricately connected to the fluctuations in the Bitcoin market, possibly more than ever. In the event of a significant surge in Bitcoin prices, there is a likelihood that the Ethereum value could experience a delayed but notable increase. Moreover, the introduction of an Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) has the potential to contribute to additional upward momentum in the Ethereum price.\n\nNevertheless, a projection for the Ethereum price in 2024 doesn\u2019t currently indicate a value of $10,000. However, a surge to $5,000, surpassing its previous all-time high, could be plausible in a bullish cryptocurrency market over the next 12 months.\n\n\u2014> CLICK HERE TO BUY ETH<\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

        "title": "Top 14 Uniswap Alternatives - Most Similar On-Chain Swap Platforms - CoinCodex",
        "content": "Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are bringing a revolution to the cryptocurrency space, which is currently still dominated by centralized platforms. By building directly on the blockchain, projects are trying to overcome some of the biggest downfalls of centralized exchanges. When using a centralized exchange, you have to essentially hand over your coins to them, and trust that they will store them competently and honestly. Changes are also vulnerable to hacks or interventions from regulatory authorities, who can shut them down and make your funds unavailable.\n\nBlockchains, on the other hand, function 24/7 and their decentralized design makes them almost impossible to shut down; which essentially puts to rest the questions, \u201cIs Uniswap safe?\u201d and \u201cCan I trust DEXs with my coins?\u201d There have been many different approaches to decentralized trading, but it seems like the winning formula was found by Uniswap, at least for now.\n\nEven though Uniswap is still a great place to trade, there's a number of Uniswap alternatives that can perform certain tasks better. In this article, we will be showcasing 12 Uniswap alternatives that can take your decentralized trading to the next level.\n\nUniswap is the standard for DEX trading\n\nIf you\u2019re at all familiar with decentralized finance (DeFi), you\u2019ve probably already heard of Uniswap. This pioneering protocol was the first to introduce the automated market maker (AMM) design, which has since become the standard for decentralized cryptocurrency trading.\n\nIn AMMs, there is no order book like what you would find on a decentralized exchange. Instead, liquidity providers (LPs), supply their tokens into liquidity pools. For example, if you want to provide liquidity to a USDC-ETH pool, you need to supply ETH and USDC. If a trader were to tap into this pool\u2019s liquidity to exchange USDC for ETH, the price of ETH would increase because there would now be more USDC in the pool and less ETH.\n\nIn AMM exchanges like Uniswap, the total value of both types of tokens held by the pool needs to be equal. For example, if there are 1,000 USDC and 10 ETH in a pool, the price for acquiring ETH from the pool is 100 USDC (plus a transaction fee).\n\nOf course, this is just a surface-level explanation of how an AMM like Uniswap works. What\u2019s important for the purposes of this article is that Uniswap and similar platforms allow you to trade cryptocurrencies directly on the blockchain on a 24/7 basis, wherever in the world you are.\n\nAlso, DEXs can facilitate the cheapest ETH swaps and swap ERC20 tokens more competitively than their centralized counterparts. What\u2019s even better is that you don\u2019t have to deposit your crypto to a third party \u2013 all the trades are executed automatically through smart contracts that are deployed on the blockchain.\n\nOn Uniswap and other AMMs, you can also choose to provide liquidity to a pool, and collect rewards from the transaction fees that users pay to perform token swaps.\n\nTrade on Uniswap\n\nAt the time of writing, Uniswap has a 24-hour volume of $1.7 billion, and over $2 billion worth of assets in TVL (total value locked).\n\nTop 12 Uniswap Alternatives - Similar On-chain Swap Platforms\n\nUniswap\u2019s success has spawned numerous competitors and copycats, but the competition ultimately drives developers to add innovative features to attract users to their side. In this article, we will be checking out the top 12 alternatives to Uniswap that you can use for your decentralized crypto trading needs. Most of them employ a similar AMM concept to Uniswap, but some of them, like dYdX and Synthetix, offer their own unique approaches.\n\n1inch - Best multichain alternative\n\n- Best multichain alternative PancakeSwap - Best alternative for BNB Chain BEP20 tokens\n\n- Best alternative for BNB Chain BEP20 tokens SushiSwap - Multiple chain alternative with additional features\n\n- Multiple chain alternative with additional features QuickSwap - Low fee alternative deployed on Polygon\n\n- Low fee alternative deployed on Polygon dYdX - Derivatives and margin trading alternative\n\n- Derivatives and margin trading alternative GMX - A highly efficient decentralized derivatives platform\n\n- A highly efficient decentralized derivatives platform Binance DEX - CEX-like alternative on BNB Chain\n\n- CEX-like alternative on BNB Chain Serum - Best alternative built on Solana\n\n- Best alternative built on Solana Kwenta - Low slippage and derivative tokens\n\n- Low slippage and derivative tokens SunSwap - TRON-based decentralized trading alternative\n\n- TRON-based decentralized trading alternative CoW Swap - A DEX aggregator with MEV protection\n\n- A DEX aggregator with MEV protection DODO DEX - Best alternative for reduced impermanent loss risk\n\n- Best alternative for reduced impermanent loss risk Orca - The most popular DEX on Solana\n\n- The most popular DEX on Solana Osmosis - A feature-packed DEX for the Cosmos ecosystem\n\n1. 1inch - Best multichain alternative\n\n1inch is a DeFi project that\u2019s active across multiple blockchains \u2013 they have created solutions for Ethereum, Polygon and Binance Smart Chain. 1inch have launched their own AMM called Mooniswap, but most users know them for their DeFi aggregator protocol.\n\nLet\u2019s say that you want to swap some of your ETH for DAI. 1inch will then scour through different DeFi protocols in order to find the most efficient swap for you, and it even gives you the option to either optimize for the highest return or the lowest gas costs. 1inch splits orders across multiple decentralized exchanges, in order to minimize slippage and give you the most out of your crypto.\n\nA very unique aspect of 1inch is that it also supports limit orders, which are a rarity in the DeFi space. You can simply set the token you want to spend and the token you want to receive, set a desired price and the duration of the order. If the price of the token moves to the price you specified, 1inch will automatically execute the trade for you at the best rates available on the market.\n\n1inch also features the 1INCH token, which serves both as a utility and governance token.\n\n1inch summary\n\nDeFi aggregator\n\nSupports Ethereum, Polygon and Binance Smart Chain\n\nAutomatically finds the most efficient route for token swaps\n\nSupports limit orders\n\nTrade on 1inch\n\n2. PancakeSwap - Best alternative for BNB Chain BEP20 tokens\n\nPancakeSwap is the most popular decentralized exchange on the Binance Smart Chain blockchain. It functions very similarly to Uniswap, but the project has also introduced some unique features to reward their users.\n\nPancakeSwap lets you instantly swap between different BEP-20 tokens that operate on the Binance Smart Chain blockchain. The platform also has its own token called CAKE, which performs a number of functions in the PancakeSwap ecosystem. For example, you can stake your CAKE tokens in \u201cSyrup Pools\u201d to earn more CAKE tokens, or even other types of tokens in some cases.\n\nThe PancakeSwap platform also has other features like yield farming, where you can stake your LP Tokens to earn CAKE tokens. Another unique part of PancakeSwap are initial farm offerings or IFOs, where users have the opportunity to earn newly launched tokens from projects. For all the aforementioned reasons, PancakeSwap is widely regarded as one of the best Uniswap alternatives.\n\nPancakeSwap summary\n\nTop decentralized exchange on Binance Smart Chain\n\nHas its own token called CAKE\n\nSwap between BEP-20 tokens or earn fees by providing liquidity\n\nSupports yield farming, Syrup Pools, IFOs and other innovative features\n\nTrade on PancakeSwap\n\n3. SushiSwap - Multiple chain alternative with additional features\n\nSushiSwap is one of the biggest Uniswap competitors on Ethereum, but the team has also expanded the protocol to other blockchain platforms like Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Fantom and others.\n\nSushiSwap was launched in August of 2020 as a fork and direct competitor to Uniswap. However, the team made one big change to their product that Uniswap wasn\u2019t offering at the time. By depositing Uniswap LP tokens to SushiSwap, users could earn SUSHI tokens, which could then be staked to earn a portion of the total fees generated by SushiSwap. This strategy proved to be immensely effective, and SushiSwap was at one point a real threat to overtake Uniswap as the number one decentralized exchange at the time.\n\nUniswap later defended itself from this \u201cvampire attack\u201d by launching their own token called UNI, which brought the odds back in its favor.\n\nRegardless of how SushiSwap started, the project has taken a life of its own and is supported by a very strong community of users and developers. The SushiSwap protocol has been deployed to other blockchain platforms besides Ethereum, and the broader Sushi ecosystem now offers a pretty comprehensive set of DeFi features like yield farming, lending and staking.\n\nWhether you\u2019re looking to swap between token on-chain or engage with DeFi in some other way, SushiSwap and the Sushi ecosystem are definitely an option worth considering.\n\nSushiSwap summary\n\nDecentralized exchange on Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Fantom and other platforms\n\nSwap tokens or provide liquidity\n\nHas its own governance token called SUSHI\n\nThe Sushi ecosystem also offers yield farming, lending, staking and more\n\nTrade on SushiSwap\n\n4. QuickSwap - Low fee alternative deployed on Polygon\n\nQuickSwap is a fork of Uniswap that\u2019s deployed on the Polygon blockchain. Polygon is a scalability solution that offers lower fees and faster transactions than Ethereum. QuickSwap offers the standard AMM functionality of swapping tokens and providing liquidity.\n\nHowever, QuickSwap does have some tricks up its sleeve \u2013 it features a liquidity mining program, where users can deposit their LP Tokens in order to earn the QUICK governance token. QuickSwap now also supports IDOs, or initial DEX offerings. IDOs give users a chance to purchase tokens that are being launched by up-and-coming crypto projects.\n\nIf you\u2019re exploring the Polygon as a way to cut down on your transaction costs, QuickSwap is certainly a DEX that\u2019s worth checking out.\n\nQuickSwap summary\n\nDecentralized exchange on the Polygon blockchain\n\nUses the AMM model popularized by Uniswap\n\nCan be a good option if you want to save on Ethereum transaction fees\n\nHas its own governance token called QUICK\n\nTrade on QuickSwap\n\n5. dYdX - Derivatives and margin trading alternative\n\ndYdX is an Ethereum-based decentralized trading platform that specializes in derivatives and margin trading. As you probably know, trading in derivatives like futures contracts and options is currently dominated by centralized exchanges like Binance Futures and Bybit. dYdX is attempting to change this by bringing derivatives on-chain, through Ethereum smart contracts.\n\ndYdX\u2019s most unique feature are its perpetual contracts, which you can use like the perpetual contracts that are popular on centralized exchanges. They allow you to enter leveraged positions and speculate on the price movements of various cryptocurrencies, giving you an opportunity to go either long or short.\n\nThrough a partnership with Starkware, dYdX has deployed its perpetual contracts on the StarkEx layer 2 Ethereum scalability solution. StarkEx enables transactions to be processed much cheaper than Ethereum\u2019s layer 1, making dYdX a viable option for active traders.\n\nCurrently, the dYdX platform is in the process of launching its DYDX governance token, which will likely expand the functionality of the platform even further.\n\ndYdX summary\n\nDecentralized leverage trading platform\n\nPerpetual contracts on StarkEx layer 2, providing cheaper transactions\n\nUsers can speculate on the price movements even for tokens that are not on Ethereum\n\nAlso offers margin and spot trading on Ethereum layer 1\n\nTrade on dYdX\n\n6. GMX - A highly efficient decentralized derivatives platform\n\nGMX is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange specialized in derivatives, more specifically perpetual futures contracts. The GMX exchange is currently available on the Arbitrum and Avalanche blockchain platforms.\n\nThe GMX ecosystem features two tokens: GMX and GLP. GMX is a utility and governance token which accrues 30% of the fees collected on the GMX exchange. Meanwhile, GLP is the platform\u2019s liquidity provider token, which accrues 70% of the fees collected on the exchange.\n\nGLP represents an index that currently consists of 8 different crypto assets which are supported on the GMX exchange for swaps and leverage trading. Users can mint GLP by supplying any of the supported assets to the pool, or redeem GLP for assets held by the pool.\n\nThe platform supports trading with up to 50x leverage, which is competitive compared to most centralized crypto derivatives platforms. Recently, the GMX team has launched a beta version of their v2 protocol, which offers more assets, supports multiple collateral types, and provides faster trade execution speeds.\n\nGMX summary\n\nTrade perpetual contracts with leverage on chain\n\nAvailable on Arbitrum and Avalanche\n\nTrade top coins such as ETH, BTC and LINK\n\nUp to 50x leverage\n\nTrade on GMX\n\n7. Binance DEX - CEX-like alternative on BNB Chain\n\nBinance DEX is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange originally developed by Binance. It was launched in April of 2019, and offers a trading experience that\u2019s very similar to trading on centralized exchanges. Binance DEX is built on Binance Chain, a blockchain that Binance specifically designed for the decentralized trading use case. Binance Chain uses BNB as its native asset and is also interoperable with Binance Smart Chain, which is currently much more popular.\n\nLike other DEXes, Binance DEX is non-custodial, which means that you stay in control of the private keys to your cryptocurrency \u2013 you don\u2019t have to deposit it to someone else and trust that they will take good care of it.\n\nIf you\u2019re used to trading on centralized exchanges but want to give decentralized exchanges a try, Binance DEX can be a good place to start. However, decentralized exchanges using the AMM model have turned out to be more popular among traders.\n\nBinance DEX summary\n\nDecentralized exchange created by Binance\n\nOffers a similar interface and trading experience to centralized exchanges\n\nFunctions on Binance Chain\n\nNon-custodial design\n\nTrade on Binance DEX\n\n8. Serum - Best alternative built on Solana\n\nSerum is a decentralized exchange built on Solana, a blockchain platform that\u2019s designed with a focus on scalability. Solana users can take advantage of Wormhole, a solution for bridging ERC-20 tokens over to the Solana blockchain.\n\nThe goal of the Serum project is to deliver a decentralized exchange that rivals its centralized counterparts both in terms of performance and user experience.\n\nIndeed, the Serum DEX interface looks more like what you\u2019d typically see on a centralized exchange. There\u2019s a price chart in the middle, an orderbook, and a section for submitting your orders. When trading on Serum, you can submit limit orders, which is a fairly unique feature in the DeFi space.\n\nThe Serum project has a utility and governance token called SRM. The token is available on both Solana and Ethereum and provides benefits for holders when using the Serum exchange.\n\nNotably, the Serum project is backed by prominent players from the cryptocurrency space, such as Alameda Research, Multicoin Capital, FTX, and others.\n\nSerum summary\n\nDecentralized exchange built on the Solana blockchain\n\nProvides a similar experience to centralized exchanges\n\nFast and cheap transactions thanks to Solana\u2019s scalability\n\nSRM governance and utility token\n\nTrade on Serum\n\n9. Kwenta - Low slippage and derivative tokens alternative\n\nKwenta is a decentralized exchange powered by Synthetix, a unique DeFi protocol that enables the creation of derivative tokens, or \u201cSynths\u201d. The idea behind Synths is that they are tokens that track the price movements of other assets, for example, fiat currencies like USD and EUR, other crypto assets like Bitcoin, and even stocks and stock market indices.\n\nThe Kwenta DEX uses a peer-to-contract (P2C) model, where trades are executed against Synthetix smart contracts. This combats some of the biggest shortcomings of peer-to-peer models and provides better liquidity and lower slippage. Another interesting feature of Kwenta is that all Synths supported by the Synthetix protocol can be traded against each other \u2013 there\u2019s no limited set of trading pairs that users have to choose from.\n\nKwenta is an interesting option for users who are looking for a DEX but would like to expand their trading beyond just standard crypto tokens. Kwenta allows users to gain exposure to real-world assets and other cryptocurrencies in a non-custodial manner while staying on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nKwenta summary\n\nPowered by the Synthetix protocol\n\nUsers can trade Synths, which are tokens that track other assets\n\nGain exposure to equities, indices, forex, and other cryptocurrencies while staying on Ethereum\n\nHas a Layer 2 deployment on Optimistic Ethereum for better scalability\n\nTrade on Kwenta\n\n10. SunSwap - TRON-based decentralized trading alternative\n\nSunSwap is an AMM built on the TRON blockchain with very similar functionality to Uniswap \u2013 you can use it to either swap between different TRON-based tokens, or provide liquidity to earn rewards. SunSwap also has a liquidity mining program where users can stake LP tokens to earn rewards in the form of TRX and other tokens.\n\nSUN.io acquired JustSwap in October 2021 and renamed the DEX to SunSwap. As a part of the change in ownership, a native utility and governance SUN Token was introduced to the platform. To put inflationary pressure on the SUN Token, its circulating supply is regulated via the SUN Buyback & Burn program.\n\nIf you\u2019re an avid user of the TRON blockchain, JustSwap is one of the main options for decentralized trading that\u2019s worth considering. Thanks to TRON\u2019s delegated-proof-of-stake design, trading on JustSwap is also cheap and fast.\n\nSunSwap summary\n\nDecentralized exchange on the TRON blockchain\n\nBased on the AMM model\n\nSwap between TRON-based tokens or provide liquidity to earn fees\n\nLiquidity mining program\n\nTrade on SunSwap\n\n11. CoW Swap - A DEX aggregator with MEV protection\n\nCoW Swap is a unique decentralized exchange aggregator that protects users from various forms of MEV (maximal extractable value) such as arbitrage, front running and sandwiching. The ultimate result of this is that users on CoW Swap are likely to get a better deal than if they were using another DEX or aggregator with no MEV protection.\n\nIn fact, CoW Swap is described as a \"meta\" decentralized exchange aggregator, as it acts as an aggregator of aggregators. As such, it looks at decentralized exchanges directly, as well as other aggregators to find the best possible price for users.\n\nThe name CoW Swap is derived from the economic concept of a \"Coincidence of Wants\". CoW Swap implements batch auctions to facilitate direct settlements between traders instead of relying on market makers or external liquidity providers (where possible).\n\nAs an interesting aside, we should mention that Ethereum inventor Vitalik Buterin used CoW Swap to sell his MKR token holdings.\n\nCowSwap summary\n\nAggregator of aggregators\n\nProvides MEV protection to ensure the best deals\n\nBased on the concept of Coincidence of Wants\n\nTrade on CoW Swap\n\n12. DODO DEX - Best alternative for reduced impermanent loss risk\n\nDODO DEX is a decentralized exchange that uses a Proactive Market Maker (PMM) design, which is a variant of the AMM design we\u2019ve already discussed in this article. According to the DODO DEX team, the PMM design reduces the risk of impermanent loss faced by liquidity providers. Another interesting feature of DODO DEX is that liquidity providers don\u2019t have to deposit two tokens to a pool, as the protocol supports single-token deposits.\n\nFrom the trader\u2019s perspective, PMM helps reduce slippage, allowing for trades to be executed at more predictable prices.\n\nDODO DEX is live on both the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain blockchain platform, and also has some unique features like Crowdpooling, which gives cryptocurrency projects a new way of distributing tokens to users.\n\nThe DODO token is used to facilitate governance, but also powers a fee-sharing mechanism and provides membership perks. For example, DODO holders can access trading fee discounts on DODO DEX and participate in initial DEX offerings hosted by the platform.\n\nDODO DEX summary\n\nDecentralized exchange on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain\n\nUses the Proactive Market Maker design, which is a variant of the Automated Market Maker design\n\nDODO token enables governance and gives special benefits to holders\n\nThe platform also hosts initial DEX offerings (IDOs)\n\nTrade on DODO DEX\n\n13. Orca - The most popular DEX on Solana\n\nOrca is a Solana-based decentralized exchange that has received backing from prominent crypto investors such as Polychain, Placeholder, Solana Ventures and Coinbase Ventures. At the time of writing, Orca is the leading decentralized exchange on the Solana blockchain, with nearly $300 million in 24-hour trading volume.\n\nWhile Orca's TVL and trading volume suffered following the collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, this DEX saw a major resurgence in 2023 during the Solana bull run. With more and more DeFi activity happening on Solana, Orca is a natural destination for users looking to swap Solana-based tokens.\n\nOrca sports solid liquidity and an excellent user experience, and a portion of the trading fees collected by the platform goes towards the Orca Climate Fund, which invests in enterpreneurs who are focused on sustainable technologies. In total, the Orca Climate Fund has raised over $1.6 million in this way. The Orca DEX has a governance token called ORCA, which allows users to influence key decisions related to the protocol.\n\nOrca summary\n\nThe go-to DEX for Solana token swaps\n\nGood liquidity and excellent user experience\n\nPortion of transaction fees is used to fund sustainable technologies\n\nTrade on Orca\n\n14. Osmosis - A feature-packed DEX for the Cosmos ecosystem\n\nLaunched in June 2021, Osmosis is a decentralized exchange (DEX) project that uses the automated market maker approach to determine prices of digital assets, facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P) trading, and run liquidity pools. Built using the Cosmos SDK, the Layer-1 Osmosis blockchain allows developers to deploy customized AMMs by using various trading modules and Osmosis\u2019 Proof-of-Stake (PoS) enabled on-chain governance.\n\nOsmosis is the leading decentralized exchange in the Cosmos ecosystem, and has a TVL of roughly $185 million with a daily trading volume of $60 million at the time of writing. The Osmosis protocol is governed by holders of the OSMO governance token.\n\nBesides basic token swaps, the Osmosis ecosystem also includes a variety of other trading tools including staking, margin trading and on-chain perpetual futures contracts.\n\nOsmosis summary\n\nLeading decentralized exchange in the Cosmos ecosystem\n\nGovernance through the OSMO token\n\nAlso powers features such as margin trading and perpetuals\n\nTrade on Osmosis\n\nWhy do I need alternatives to Uniswap?\n\nThe Uniswap team has developed a great protocol, which is likely to stand the test of time as one of the most successful projects in DeFi. However, competitors are also making their case, and this competition will ultimately bring better products for everyone to use. You might also want to find alternatives to Uniswap if your swaps on Uniswap are failing or if there is insufficient liquidity on Uniswap.\n\nIf you\u2019re using a blockchain like Binance Smart Chain or TRON where there is no Uniswap, it\u2019s always good to know that there are suitable alternatives that you can use to trade tokens. Even on Ethereum, where Uniswap is currently dominating, other DEXes might provide unique perks or better prices.\n\nMeanwhile, if you're also interested in centralized exchanges, make sure to check out our list of the best crypto exchanges in 2024."

        "content": "Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, exhibited a brief upswing today, instilling confidence among investors.\n\nHowever, a notable transaction occurred amid a marginal dip in the token\u2019s value, shedding light on the ongoing battle between bullish and bearish sentiments.\n\nParadigm, an institutional liquidity network, executed a deposit of 6,500 $ETH (equivalent to $14.67M) into Coinbase a few hours ago. The strategic move by Paradigm, known for accumulating Ethereum during bear markets and divesting in bull markets, has contributed to the current slight decline.\n\nSimultaneously, whales in the Ethereum market are capitalizing on these minor downturns, seizing the opportunity to accumulate more $ETH.\n\nWhale \u201c0x9314\u201d recently expended $48M to acquire 21,192 $ETH at a price of $2,265 from the decentralized exchange (DEX). Notably, this entity has acquired a total of 79,980 $ETH ($143M) since the onset of January 1.\n\nJustin Sun, the founder of TRON, withdrew a substantial amount from Binance, pulling out 11,267 $ETH ($25.3M) just five hours ago and a cumulative 17,433 $ETH ($39.2M) since December 26.\n\nThis nuanced interplay between Paradigm\u2019s strategic deposit, whale accumulation, and Justin Sun\u2019s withdrawals highlights the intricate dance between bullish and bearish forces within the Ethereum market.\n\nInvestors closely monitor these movements, seeking insights into the overall sentiment and potential future trajectories for the cryptocurrency. As Ethereum navigates the ever-changing crypto landscape, these contrasting actions shape its market valuation, adding layers of complexity to the ongoing narrative of the crypto market.\n\nDisclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

        "content": "SEC Implicitly Recognizes Ether as Commodity, Paving Way for ETF\n\nAn Ethereum (ETH) spot ETF is due to reach the U.S. market after a slew of Bitcoin (BTC) based equivalents are likely greenlighted next week, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart.\n\nDuring a private webinar with CryptoQuant on Thursday, the analyst argued that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has quietly recognized ETH as a commodity rather than a security, placing it in the same regulatory category as BTC.\n\n\u201cThe SEC has approved Ethereum futures ETFs,\u201d noted Seyffart, referring to the mass approval of funds from VanEck, ProShares, Bitwise, and Valkyrie in August.\n\nSponsors were inspired to apply at the time after witnessing the SEC approve the first leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF in June. This signalled to the market that regulators might now be willing to list crypto products with a higher risk profile, like Ethereum futures.\n\n\u201cSo again, Gary Gensler will not explicitly say whether Ethereum is a security or a commodity, but in their action, by approving those Ethereum futures ETFs, they\u2019re implicitly accepting those Ethereum futures as commodities futures,\u201d explained Seyffart.\n\nThe distinction is important: commodities and securities face different regulatory, tax, and reporting requirements, with greater burdens arguable attached to the latter.\n\nThe Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) \u2013 the SEC\u2019s sibling market regulator \u2013 has long considered both BTC and ETH to be commodities.\n\nBy contrast, SEC chairman Gary Gensler has long kept a tight lip regarding ETH\u2019s classification, dodging interviewers when probed on the matter.\n\nThat said, the agency excluded mentioning ETH in its lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase last year, which named dozens of other top cryptos including Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC) as securities.\n\nLikelihood Of ETF Approval\n\n\n\nThe SEC has also offered few explicit details about whether it will approve or deny Bitcoin spot ETF applications its received from BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and others, only noting that it\u2019s making a \u201cfresh evaluation\u201d of such proposals after losing its court case with Grayscale in August.\n\nGiven rising engagement and discussion with applicants in recent months, analysts like Seyffart assign a 90% likelihood to ETFs being approved early next week. Ethereum ETFs aren\u2019t quite so guaranteed yet, but the SEC will have a hard time denying them. He added:"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCryptocurrencies have been prone to fluctuations which have varying effects on investments. Veteran traders pay attention to market data and watch the analysis to step in at the right moment and back the right assets. This analysis goes into the latest market trends around two of the biggest coins in the crypto market, Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nWe will also take a look at Pushd (PUSHD), a newcomer that is bringing decentralization to global e-commerce and online marketplaces.\n\nSupporters of Pushd (PUSHD) can take part in pre-sale and buy tokens here .\n\nEthereum (ETH) community enjoys new high\n\nThe second biggest crypto in terms of market capitalization, Ethereum (ETH) is a popular decentralized asset for many traders. The network has an expansive number of use cases including for smart contracts and DeFi. Its blockchain also serves as the base for many other networks and tokens.\n\nYet, keen observers would notice that Ethereum (ETH) has dropped by around 5.61% in the last 24 hours, and around 6.26% in the last 7 days. It has also seen a significant decrease in trading volume in that period. Analysts have attributed this trend to several factors including a period of short-term profit-taking and price movements of other assets.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) supporters enthusiastic as standoff with SEC continues\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is considered the pioneer of cryptocurrencies and has the highest market cap of any digital asset. However, it is still not immune to the volatility in the market. The value of 1 Bitcoin BTC declined by 4.46% in the past day, liquidating some $500 million worth of positions.\n\nThis was following a report by Matrixport, a financial services company, that predicted that the SEC would reject Bitcoin (BTC) Spot ETF proposals. While some experts argue that this reversal in value is not connected to the report, it seems to have affected confidence in the asset. Other analysts believe technical price metrics are instead responsible for the drop in value.\n\nPushd (PUSHD) presale gains traction\n\nThe innovative project promising to revolutionize how online marketplaces work through blockchain technology, Pushd (PUSHD), has recorded an important milestone. Pushd (PUSHD) saw over 5,000 new users register for its presale in just five days. This represents a growing confidence in the world's first decentralized online marketplace.\n\nKey features like the absence of KYC verification and its associated delays continue to make Pushd (PUSHD) stand out, on top of its lower fees and faster transactions. It also has a unique rewards program, allowing users and investors to benefit in many ways, including for completing milestones. Coins can also be swapped quickly and with no extra cost, a feature unique to Pushd (PUSHD)."

        "content": "The main developers of the Ethereum team are proposing plans for a hard fork, following Dencun after the proposed date is mid-March 2024. The main controversy is whether it would be better to concentrate on a limited set of features or prioritize the major protocol upgrade, Verkle Trees.\n\nVerkle Trees are very important for addressing Ethereum\u2019s long-term state bloat problem because of the huge advantages listed above in terms of data storage and verification speed. Implementing them, however, is a complicated process that may need 18 months or longer.\n\nFor instance, Guillaume Ballet of the Ethereum Foundation is arguing for Verkle Trees to be included in Prague-Electra (Pralectra), which should become an exclusive upgrade focus. Others, such as Lukasz Rozmej of Nethermind, suggest focusing on a feature-rich fork first to avoid delays.\n\nACDE#178 just wrapped up (hello 2024!): we confirmed the testnet upgrade timelines for Dencun, appetite for Verkle as the next L1 prio, and had an open floor for other proposals for the Prague upgrade.\n\n\n\nAgenda: https://t.co/iHrS7vkmhH\n\nStream: https://t.co/oZPtQ5pO5W\n\n\n\nRecap below: https://t.co/Q8ZXH6Uhbq \u2014 \u064b (@lightclients) January 4, 2024\n\nSome of the potential features that were discussed include EVM Object Format (EOF) and Execution layer triggerable exits EIP-7002. 7002 fixes a significant bug related to staking, and EOF could be implemented by a less large team without distracting from Verkle Trees development.\n\nAlthough no agreement emerged on the precise method for Pralectra, this call stood as a significant debate that will define Ethereum\u2019s future.\n\nThe decentralized quality of the project means that progress can seem slow and chaotic at times, but in the end, the community will decide where to head next."

        "content": "STAMFORD, Conn., Jan. 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Grayscale Investments\u00ae , the world\u2019s largest crypto asset manager*, and manager of Grayscale\u00ae Digital Large Cap Fund ( OTCQX: GDLC ) (Digital Large Cap Fund), Grayscale\u00ae DeFi Fund ( OTCQB: DEFG ) (DeFi Fund), and Grayscale\u00ae Smart Contract Platform Ex-Ethereum Fund (GSCPxE Fund), today announced the updated Fund Component weightings for each product in connection with their respective fourth quarter 2023 reviews.\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the CoinDesk Large Cap Select Index methodology, Grayscale has adjusted GDLC\u2019s portfolio by selling certain amounts of the existing Fund Components in proportion to their respective weightings, and using the cash proceeds to purchase Avalanche (AVAX) and XRP. As a result of the rebalancing, Polygon (MATIC) has been removed from GDLC. At the end of the day on January 4, 2024, GDLC\u2019s Fund Components were a basket of the following assets and weightings.**\n\nBitcoin (BTC), 69.15%\n\nEthereum (ETH), 21.90%\n\nSolana (SOL), 3.65%\n\nXRP, 2.54%\n\nCardano (ADA), 1.62%\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) 1.14%\n\nThe information below has been derived from publicly available information concerning AVAX and XRP.\n\nAvalanche\n\nAVAX is a digital asset that is created and transmitted through the operations of the peer-to-peer Avalanche network, a decentralized network of computers that operates on cryptographic protocols. No single entity owns or operates the Avalanche network, the infrastructure of which is collectively maintained by a decentralized user base. The Avalanche network allows people to exchange tokens of value, called AVAX, which are recorded on a public transaction ledger known as a blockchain. AVAX can be used to pay for goods and services, including computational power on the Avalanche network, or it can be converted to fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, at rates determined on digital asset exchanges or in individual end-user-to-end-user transactions under a barter system. Furthermore, the Avalanche network was designed to allow users to write and implement smart contracts\u2014that is, general-purpose code that executes on every computer in the network and can instruct the transmission of information and value based on a sophisticated set of logical conditions. Using smart contracts, users can create markets, store registries of debts or promises, represent the ownership of property, move funds in accordance with conditional instructions and create digital assets other than AVAX on the Avalanche network. Smart contract operations are executed on the Avalanche blockchain in exchange for payment of AVAX. Like the Ethereum network, the Avalanche network is one of a number of projects intended to expand blockchain use beyond just a peer-to-peer money system.\n\nThe Avalanche network uses a variation of a proof-of-stake consensus protocol. Unlike with other blockchains, whereby every validator node validates every transaction, each Avalanche validator is only required to validate what is known as the \u201cPrimary Network.\u201d The Primary Network in turn secures the following three blockchains, which are each dedicated to a specific use and, together with the Primary Network, comprise the core Avalanche infrastructure: the Exchange (X) Chain, on which AVAX and other assets exist and are traded; the Platform (P) Chain, which coordinates validators and creates subnets (as defined below); and the Contract (C) Chain, which executes smart contracts.\n\nWhereas all validators are required to validate the Primary Network and the three blockchains described above, active validators of the Primary Network may additionally elect to validate certain non-core blockchains (i.e., blockchains that are not fundamental to or necessary for the Avalanche Network to operate) of the Avalanche Platform. Avalanche uses a dynamic set of validators to validate the non-core blockchains (each such set of validators, a \u201csubnet\u201d). This integration functionality is intended to allow Avalanche users to tokenize and transact in any digital asset. Avalanche is reportedly one of the fastest networks when measured by transaction time-to-finality at relatively low transaction costs. The Avalanche Network was founded by Professor Emin G\u00fcn Sirer, a professor at Cornell University, and launched in September 2020.\n\nXRP\n\nXRP is a digital asset that was created by Chris Larsen, Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto and David Schwartz (the \u201cXRP Creators\u201d) in 2012. Built out of the frustrations of Bitcoin\u2019s utility for payments, the XRP ledger (the ledger to which XRP is native) is designed to be a global real-time payment and settlement system. The XRP Creators developed this unique digital asset to solve the scalability concerns that they believed were inherent in the structure of Bitcoin. In particular, XRP was created to improve the efficiency of payments. To this end, the open source code (available at https://github.com/ripple/rippled/) was designed to maximize speed, scalability, and stability. For example, the XRP ledger can accommodate 4,400 transactions per second. This is, in part, because XRP is not mined like Bitcoin, but is designed for the ledgers to close in seconds based on a system of consensus. Further, because of the consensus methodology underlying the XRP design, network transaction fees are substantially lower than Bitcoin, typically less than $0.01.\n\nGiven the unique qualities of XRP and the natural suitability of this digital asset to solve the friction experience with payments, the XRP Creators started a company, calling it Ripple, to further develop the ecosystem around XRP and build software solutions to address the friction in sending, processing, and sourcing liquidity for global payments. Thus, the company, Ripple, began as, and continues to be, a payments software company. Today, Ripple is focused on designing and deploying state-of-the-art and industry-leading software to enable banks and financial institutions to more easily effect cross-border payments. For maximum efficiency, Ripple\u2019s software can integrate XRP to solve liquidity and value transfer challenges.\n\nIn 2020 the SEC filed a complaint against the promoters of XRP alleging that they raised more than $1.3 billion through XRP sales that should have been registered under the federal securities laws, but were not. In the years prior to the SEC\u2019s action, XRP\u2019s market capitalization at times reached over $140 billion. However, in the weeks following the SEC\u2019s complaint, XRP\u2019s market capitalization fell to less than $10 billion, which was less than half of its market capitalization in the days prior to the complaint. In addition, major digital asset trading platforms announced that they would delist XRP from their platforms. Effective January 4, 2021, the Fund removed XRP from the Fund\u2019s portfolio and sold the XRP holdings to purchase additional tokens of the remaining Fund Components in proportion to their respective weightings.\n\nSubsequently, in July 2023, the District Court for the Southern District of New York held that while XRP is not a security, certain sales of XRP to certain buyers amounted to \u201cinvestment contracts\u201d under the Howey test. The SEC sought an interlocutory appeal of the district court\u2019s verdict that XRP is not a security, which appeal was denied by the district court in October 2023. Following the court\u2019s decision, major digital asset trading platforms announced that they would once again list XRP on their platforms, and subsequently, XRP met the inclusion criteria of the DLCS Index. The SEC\u2019s action against XRP\u2019s promoters underscores the continuing uncertainty around whether or which digital assets are securities, and demonstrates that such factors as how long a digital asset has been in existence, how widely held it is, how large its market capitalization is and that it has actual usefulness in commercial transactions, ultimately may have no bearing on whether the SEC or a court will find it to be a security. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risk Factors Related to Digital Assets\u2014A determination that a digital asset is a \u201csecurity\u201d may adversely affect the value of such digital assets and the value of the Shares if such digital asset is a Fund Component\u201d in the Fund\u2019s Annual Report.\n\nIn accordance with the CoinDesk DeFi Select Index methodology, Grayscale has adjusted DEFG\u2019s portfolio by selling certain amounts of the existing Fund Components in proportion to their respective weightings. As a result of the rebalancing, Curve DAO Token (CRV) was removed from DEFG. At the end of the day on January 4, 2024, DEFG\u2019s Fund Components were a basket of the following assets and weightings.**\n\nUniswap (UNI), 41.11%\n\nLido (LDO), 23.90%\n\nMakerDAO (MKR), 13.39%\n\nAave (AAVE), 12.63%\n\nSynthetix (SNX), 8.97%\n\n\n\nNo new tokens were added or removed from GSCPxE Fund. At the end of the day on January 4, 2024, GSCPxE Fund\u2019s Fund Components were a basket of the following assets and weightings.**\n\nSolana (SOL), 44.54%\n\nCardano (ADA), 19.77%\n\nAvalanche (AVAX), 13.89%\n\nPolkadot (DOT), 9.75%\n\nPolygon (MATIC), 8.25%\n\nCosmos (ATOM), 3.80%\n\nNeither GDLC, nor DEFG, nor GSCPxE Fund generate any income, and all regularly distribute Fund Components to pay for ongoing expenses.

        "title": "3 Crypto Predictions for 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After a brutal crypto winter in 2022, the resurgence that swept through the crypto asset class in 2023 was more than refreshing. With signs that a bull market might be looming ahead, 2024 is shaping up to be a year for the history books.\n\nWhile they might seem outlandish, here are three predictions for the upcoming year. Remember, this is crypto -- stranger things have happened.\n\nIt's still Bitcoin's year\n\nLet's cut to the chase: Bitcoin (BTC 2.11%) might have a better 2024 than it did in 2023. With the first prediction for the new year, Bitcoin should hit a new all-time high.\n\nLast year, Bitcoin's rise could be attributed to the anticipated approval of the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) and fresh interest in novel use cases like Ordinals, a Bitcoin-based equivalent of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nWhile these two catalysts helped renew sentiment across the crypto market, they will likely prove to be minor accelerants compared to what 2024 has in store. The most influential development pushing Bitcoin toward an all-time high is the upcoming halving. Hardwired into Bitcoin's code, the halving reduces Bitcoin's inflation rate in half roughly every four years. Currently sitting at 1.75%, in April of this year it will fall to 0.85%.\n\nHistorically, halvings have been significant drivers of price appreciation as demand must adjust to a diminished inflation rate. In years that a halving occurred, Bitcoin has grown by more than 128% on average. A jump of this magnitude would put Bitcoin's price at $99,000 -- a new all-time high.\n\nTo take it a step further, this halving will be unlike any other. For most of Bitcoin's history, the rate of freshly mined supply more or less kept up with demand. But that shifted recently. Currently, only 2.3 million coins are available on exchanges for purchase, a level not seen since 2017. As a result, the upcoming halving will be the first time in history that there are fewer available coins than at the previous halving. With an unprecedented supply shock inbound, don't be surprised if Bitcoin hits six figures in 2023.\n\nThe Bitcoin renaissance continues\n\nCategorized as a Layer 2 blockchain since it operates in tandem with a Layer 1 blockchain, Stacks (STX -3.13%) unlocks Bitcoin to take on new use cases and realize its true potential as the foundation of a decentralized economy.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the popularity of Ordinals sparked interest in building Bitcoin-based solutions, allowing it to take on use cases beyond just a store of value. As general interest transformed into a movement, Stacks became a natural beneficiary with its Bitcoin compatibility and rose more than 200% in 2023. Yet this is just scratching the surface of what may come in 2024.\n\nScheduled to go live in April, the Nakamoto Release will unveil novel functionality that allows Bitcoin holders to swap their Bitcoin for a new asset, sBTC, and then use that token across the DeFi economy. Once finishing their DeFi activities, holders can seamlessly redeem their sBTC for the original BTC. Since sBTC's price is pegged to BTC, there is no slippage, and best of all, the exchange process is done in a decentralized and secure fashion through the use of smart contracts, preserving Bitcoin's distinct characteristics.\n\nFor the second prediction of 2024, expect Stacks to double in value and become a top 20 most valuable cryptocurrency. With the Bitcoin renaissance gaining steam, Stacks is in an ideal position to continue growing and claim the spotlight.\n\nEthereum is overdue for a run\n\nWhile Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies rode waves of momentum in 2023, Ethereum (ETH 1.22%) more or less watched from the sidelines. It still jumped an admirable 80% but paled in comparison to other notable altcoins like Solana, which made gains of more than 900%, and Avalanche, which jumped 250%.\n\nBut this might change in 2024 as Ethereum is scheduled to get another critical upgrade. Known as EIP-4844 and expected to be released in the second half of the year, the upgrade will reduce transaction costs and boost throughput to 100,000 transactions per second, effectively solving two of the main challenges hampering Ethereum's maturation. Building off of The Merge from 2022, a previous upgrade that switched the blockchain from proof of work to proof of stake, EIP-4844 is just one out of a series of upgrades that aims to \"grow Ethereum until it's powerful enough to help all of humanity.\"\n\nDespite its lackluster performance in 2023, Ethereum remains the premier blockchain for novel use cases of cryptocurrencies such as decentralized finance, NFTs, yield farming, and more. When considering the added benefit EIP-4844 will bring to the ecosystem, my third prediction for 2024 is that it should be the year that Ethereum reminds the crypto world that it is the undisputed home of decentralized finance and makes a run of historic magnitude."

        "title": "Ethereum Name Service: V. Buterin Impels a 72% Increase - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Fri 05 Jan 2024 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Mikaia A.\n\nThe ENS is \u201csuper-important,\u201d claims Vitalik Buterin. This is why the Ethereum co-founder is calling for Layer 2 solutions like Polygon and Optimism to utilize it to make it accessible and affordable for Ethereum network users. His call for the democratization of ENS address registration has also positively impacted the native cryptocurrency\u2019s price of Ethereum Name Service. Although the price has stabilized at $12.9, the initial increase demonstrates the influence of Buterin and the optimism surrounding ENS.\n\nVitalik Buterin triggers a spectacular surge in ENS\n\nAfter presenting the new Ethereum roadmap, Vitalik Buterin turns his focus to another topic: Ethereum Name Service. For him, it is time to democratize ENS, and Layer 2 networks such as Arbitrum, Polygon, and Optimism have a responsibility in this new direction.\n\nAll L2s should be working on (trustless, merkle-proof-based) CCIP resolvers, so that we can have ENS subdomains registerable, updateable and readable directly on L2s.\n\n\n\nENS is super-important, it needs to be affordable!https://t.co/Ice1lTttFE \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 3, 2024\n\nAccording to Cryptopolitan, the governance token of Ethereum Name Service (ENS) experienced a spectacular rise of 72% on January 3rd. The praises from Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, largely contributed to this bull run.\n\nIndeed, he has called ENS \u201csuper-important\u201d and urged for its integration into Layer 2 networks, such as Optimism and Polygon.\n\nThis momentum propelled the crypto\u2019s price to new heights, reaching $14.7, its highest level in eight months, reflecting the enthusiasm and the potential for increased adoption of ENS.\n\nA vital role in the Ethereum ecosystem\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service simplifies transactions by replacing complex alphanumeric addresses with \u201c.eth\u201d domain names. This simplification enhances the usability and accessibility of transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that the Shiba Inu team has recently launched a domain name variation more suited to Web3: \u201c.shib.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s proposal in September 2022 to impose a 3% tax on ENS domain names aims to discourage speculative hoarding and promote broader adoption and decentralized ownership. Thus, ENS is falling in line with the fundamental principles of Ethereum.\n\nIn summary, ENS has seen its value and legitimacy increase following Vitalik Buterin\u2019s endorsement. The platform, at the heart of the Ethereum ecosystem, continues to play a crucial role in simplifying transactions. At the same time, it perfectly aligns with the principles of decentralization dear to the Ethereum community. Vitalik, in search of a new approach to better cement this decentralization, recently made the laughing stock of the Cardano community.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "BONK Meme Coin Leads Solana: Is NuggetRush The Next Crypto Gem In Ethereum?\n\nCrypto has been on a tear since October 2023. With Bitcoin prices rallying, other altcoins have also benefited. Among them, Solana (SOL) has gone up more than 10X, rising from as low as $10 to above $110. As SOL prices boomed, the Solana ecosystem blossomed as enterprising developers launched meme coins. Though launched in Q4 2022, when critics deemed Solana dead, the Bonk coin meme led the altcoin surge in 2023, outperforming even the world's most capitalized meme coin, Dogecoin (DOGE).\n\nAmid this upswing, traders and investors have been exploring Ethereum, looking for potential projects that could replicate BONK and SOL in 2024. Among the few, interest is on NuggetRush (NUGX), a project whose presale is ongoing, raising over $1.5 million from the crypto community.\n\nWhat Is BONK, And Why Is It Rallying?\n\nLike Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin, BONK is a meme coin. However, one big difference is that the token was distributed to affected Solana and Solana ecosystem token holders when prices plunged in late 2022 following the collapse of FTX.\n\nBONK was meant for relief holders, but due to its large community and SOL revival in 2023, the meme coin bounced strongly to be one of the top-performing assets in 2023.\n\nTo illustrate, BONK soared by over 270X in 2023, lifting the token from obscurity to commanding a market cap of over $700 million as of early January 2024.\n\nHowever, because of the team's mission of eventually integrating BONK across multiple chains, incorporating it in decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming, the meme coin could find utility, rising as Solana recovers after the dump in 2022.\n\nDue to its rising popularity, BONK is available for trading on some of the world's mainstream exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase.\n\nEven so, after the rally in 2023, the upside momentum is fading as prices retrace. When writing, BONK is down 60% from early December 2023 peaks.\n\nAccordingly, some investors are considering alternatives, with NuggetRush emerging as an option.\n\nNuggetRush: The Next Big Thing in Ethereum?\n\nNuggetRush is deploying on Ethereum--a Solana competitor--and aims to add utility to meme coins, including BONK.\n\nThe platform plans to launch a play-to-earn (P2E) where the goal is for players to have fun and, at the same time, benefit NUGX holders.\n\nNUGX complies with the ERC-20 standard on Ethereum. Besides serving as a utility, meaning it will be used as an ecosystem currency, holders can also participate in governance. This is part of the project's plan to ensure the project is decentralized.\n\nAlready, the team has declared plans to eventually renounce its audited smart contracts to the community. Afterward, NUGX holders will directly determine how the project is developed. SolidProof has audited all NuggetRush code as a preventive measure against hacks.\n\nNuggetRush will reward players with in-game NFTs, tradable on the platform's marketplace. NUGX is a medium of exchange. As such, NFT holders can swap them for NUGX or other NFTs. At the same time, NFTs can be staked for up to 20% APY, payable in NUGX.\n\nWith its strong community, unique tokenomics, and potential for utility, NuggetRush has the potential to be the next big thing in the Ethereum ecosystem. Some even argue it can track and possibly outperform BONK in the months ahead, especially if 2024 is bullish.\n\nIn the NuggetRush presale in progress, NUGX is available for 0.015 USDT in stage 4. Over $1.5 million has been raised.\n\nEventually, NUGX will launch at $0.02 once the presale ends.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs the crypto market warms up, new opportunities are emerging. The community is exploring these opportunities, and some analysts suggest that NUGX may follow in BONK's footsteps, bringing the meme coin scene on Ethereum back into the limelight.\n\nVisit NuggetRush Presale Website\n\nThis post was authored by an external contributor and does not represent Benzinga's opinions and has not been edited for content.

        "content": "Celsius ends Ethereum staking rewards to pay back creditors\n\nBankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network said it will start unstaking its Ethereum holdings to generate sufficient liquidity and facilitate asset distributions to its creditors.\n\nThe announcement, made via a tweet on X, comes as part of Celsius\u2019 ongoing restructuring process. The decision to unstake Ethereum aims to counterbalance costs incurred during the bankruptcy.\n\nThe platform\u2019s staked Ethereum has been a source of income, providing staking rewards which have been beneficial to the estate. According to analytics firm Nansen, Celsius currently holds 32% of Ethereum awaiting withdrawal, amounting to 206,300 ETH, valued at over $466 million at current market rates.\n\nThe crypto lender filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the New York bankruptcy court in July 2022, following a severe liquidity crisis exacerbated by the plummeting crypto market. This crisis led to the freezing of withdrawals on the platform, impacting numerous users and their assets.\n\nAs part of its bankruptcy settlement plan, Celsius has allowed qualified users to withdraw 72.5% of their crypto holdings, with this opportunity available until February 28. A court filing from September last year revealed that nearly 58,300 users held custody assets valued at $210 million.\n\nA U.S. bankruptcy judge has given the green light to Celsius last week to shift its business focus to bitcoin mining. The collapsed lender agreed to pay $4.7 billion in a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission. Incidentally, the amount coincidentally matches the approximate debt Celsius owes to 1.7 million customers whose funds were frozen when the exchange ceased withdrawals last year.\n\nMeanwhile, Alex Mashinsky, the founder and former CEO of Celsius, was arrested on fraud charges and is currently out on bail. He is scheduled for a jury trial on September 17.\n\nDuring a hearing at the Manhattan federal court, Alex Mashinsky pleaded not guilty to multiple charges, including securities, commodities, and wire fraud, as well as manipulating the price of CEL tokens. Celsius\u2019 chief risk officer, Roni Cohen-Pavon, is also facing the same charges. If found guilty, both executives could face lengthy prison sentences, spanning several decades."

The approach also releases $225 million worth of cryptocurrency assets, initially earmarked for other projects but turned down by the SEC.\n\nThe new company, dubbed MiningCo, is set to be managed by Hut 8 under a contract spanning four years, focusing on mining operations.\n\nThe deal includes managing five Texas-based mining facilities, collectively equipped with a computational power of roughly 12 EH/s, akin to 122,000 miners, and a total energy output exceeding 300 MW.\n\nMiningCo is set to concentrate on staking and mining activities, with an anticipated balance sheet reaching $1.25 billion, including $450 million in readily available cryptocurrency assets.\n\nAccording to court filings, the enterprise aims to generate annual profits between $10 and $20 million from staking cryptocurrencies on the Ethereum network.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"
