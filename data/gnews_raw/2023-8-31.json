        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum records more long-term holders than Bitcoin, according to on-chain data from IntoTheBlock.\n\nWhile there is a notable increase across the board, ETH outranks BTC when it comes to large holders.\n\nMetrics such as percentage coins in USD, time held, and number of addresses were considered.\n\nExperts attribute this margin to Ethereum\u2019s DeFi dominance as the network offers more functionality besides being a crypto, unlike Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has shown a significant correlation with Bitcoin (BTC) price, tracing almost similar price actions with momentum indicators also aligning. A closer look, however, reveals that ETH has outranked BTC on several metrics, particularly where large holders or whales are concerned.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum price outperforms Bitcoin on speculation that SEC may approve ETH futures ETF sooner.\n\nOn-chain data from IntoTheBlock shows a commendable rise in long-term holders over the last year, with Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin. Specifically, Ethereum boasts a stark 73.5 million long-term holders (those who have held the cryptocurrency for more than one year) vs Bitcoin\u2019s 33.61 million.\n\nWhen it comes to whales, ETH boasts 5,370 addresses holding between 1,000 to 10,000 ETH. BTC, on the other hand, only has 1,920 addresses with between 1,000 and 10,000 Bitcoin.\n\nETH assets by time held\n\nThe number of humpbacks (addresses holding more than 5000 ETH) is also very high: 106,000 Ethereum holders own between 10K-100K, compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 103,670 holders.\n\n108 addresses hold more than 100,000 ETH versus only four holding as many BTC.\n\nETH Addresses by holdings\n\nIn addition, six wallets hold over a million Ether.\n\nBTC assets by time held\n\nThe percentage of Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings in USD also paints a similar picture in favor of ETH.\n\nBTCassets by holdings\n\nPossible reasons for Ethereum flippening Bitcoin\n\nExperts attribute the disparity, which favors Ethereum, to the network\u2019s decentralized finance (DeFi) space dominance. Specifically, the proof-of-stake (PoS) token has more functionality or use cases than Bitcoin, which is valued only as a digital currency.\n\nAmong the applications of the Ethereum network include:\n\nHosting other cryptocurrencies and stablecoins.\n\nCreation and trading of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nDevelopment of decentralized applications (DApps) in finance, web browsing, gaming, and advertising, among others.\n\nProviding access to financial services, including but not limited to crypto-lending, yield farming, and initial coin offerings (ICOs).\n\nCreation and maintenance of digital identities for individuals, companies, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.\n\nThe share of ETH locked in the DeFi landscape is also vast, recording up to $22.31 billion, relative to Bitcoin\u2019s $162.6 million locked within the same domain. This explains why Ethereum has more long-term holders.\n\nBitcoin price is up approximately 31% year-to-date, while Ethereum price is up only 6.8% over the same timeframe. Needless to say, the variation shows that dynamics in the cryptocurrency market are not limited to valuation alone. Despite Bitcoin being the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum has managed to attract more large holders."

        "title": "Ethereum Staking Services Accept 22% Validators Limit Amid Criticism From ETH Community - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nSome ETH staking service providers agreed to a self-imposed limit.\n\nThe limit restricts the amount of the staking market they control.\n\nThey promise to hold no more than 22% of the Ethereum staking market.\n\nPotential centralization of ETH liquid staking behind the move.\n\nEthereum has always been at the forefront of the debate about decentralization and now this is being protected by the adoption of a ground-breaking self-limit regulation by Ethereum staking providers.\n\nThe 22% Self-Limit Rule\n\nIn order to maintain Ethereum blockchain\u2019s decentralized nature, at least five Ethereum liquid staking providers, including Rocket Pool , Stader Labs , Diva Staking , Puffer Finance , and StakeWise , have either adopted or are actively working to implement a self-limit rule. This regulation limits their ownership to no more than 22% of the Ethereum staking market.\n\nThis figure was selected due to Ethereum\u2019s consensus algorithm requiring a 66% validator agreement on the network\u2019s state. This rule mandates the collaboration of at least four major companies for finalizing the chain, making transactions unchangeable by setting the limit at 22%.\n\nStruggling Against Centralization\n\nThe Ethereum community has had ongoing concerns about staking service centralization, as indicated by the self-limit proposal presented by Superphiz, an Ethereum core developer, in May 2022 . The main goal is to maintain the network\u2019s decentralized nature by preventing any one entity from obtaining disproportionate influence over it.\n\nThese providers are committed (or are in the process of committing) to self-limit to <22% of Ethereum validators. This is how our chain will be successful: Coordination above greed. Cooperation instead of winner-take-all.@Rocket_Pool @stakewise_io @staderlabs @divastaking \u2014 superphiz.eth \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@superphiz) August 30, 2023\n\nLido Finance Mysteries\n\nThe biggest Ethereum liquid staking service, Lido Finance, stands out as an important exception to this trend. According to data from Dune Analytics , Lido has now a commanding 32.4% of all staked Ethereum, leaving Coinbase with just an 8.7% market share.\n\nIn an unexpected move, Lido Finance voted against self-limiting in June, with a whopping 99.8% majority.\n\n\u201cThey have expressed an intention to control the majority of validators on the beacon chain,\u201d Superphiz said in an August 31 post.\n\nVarious Views in ETH Community\n\nThe self-limit rule has received a mixed reception from the Ethereum community. Some claim that the rule ignores the Ethereum tenets in favor of concentrating on economic self-interest. They argue that if proponents of the self-limit rule were in Lido\u2019s position of power, they may view things differently.\n\nEasy to commit to self-limit when it seems that most of these will likely never reach 22% market share of Liquid staking on Ethereum. Folks in the ETH community should not shame more user-friendly solutions as greedy products. https://t.co/65vgti3Jrm \u2014 Neel Daftary \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@DaftaryNeel) August 31, 2023\n\nOn the other hand, several members of the Ethereum community voiced worries about the risks of centralization posed by Lido\u2019s substantial market share. They call this domination \u201cselfish\u201d and push for measures to maintain the health and decentralization of the larger Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nYeah because they have way less market share than that now\u2026 easy to chirp from the cheap seats. This has nothing to do with \u201cEthereum alignment.\u201d None of these teams would self limit were they in Lido\u2019s place. Everyone is doing the economically selfish and rational thing\u2026 \u2014 Mippo \ud83d\udfea (@MikeIppolito_) August 31, 2023\n\nThe debate over Ethereum\u2019s decentralization will persist as it evolves. The 22% self-limit rule is a significant step in striking a balance between market growth and network decentralization.\n\nIt underscores the Ethereum community\u2019s commitment to preserving decentralization for impartiality and permissionless innovation on the platform.\n\nThe Ethereum community\u2019s commitment to decentralization is demonstrated by its acceptance of the 22% self-limit rule. This novel strategy aims to protect the fundamental values of the Ethereum platform by preventing any one company from exerting undue control over the Ethereum staking market.\n\nWhile opinions may vary, it underscores the Ethereum community\u2019s ongoing commitment to striking the right balance between market dynamics and network integrity."

Finalization refers to the state of the blockchain which guarantees transactions within a block cannot be altered.\n\n\u201cThis is a low bar, but a good start,\u201d Superphiz said, adding that the first step was to make sure a staking service did not gain control of 33% of validators.\n\nIn the event that it happens, he noted that they would essentially have the power to prevent finalization if they chose, and even resist a forced slash by the network.\n\nSome users pointed out that verbal commitments such as this one were easy to make when the likelihood of one staking service provider reaching 22% of market share was fairly low.\n\nVerbal commitments from some of these solutions will melt away as quickly too \u2013 if & when they do reach the 22% threshold. Network security should not be based on such commitments in the first place \u2014 Neel Daftary \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@DaftaryNeel) August 31, 2023\n\nOthers highlighted that Lido already controls 32.4% of the staking market, with the amount of ETH staked through the platform amounting to over 22% of the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply. Interestingly, 99.8% of the Lido community voted against imposing a self-limit on its share of the staking market in June."

        "content": "Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] have remained unrivaled in terms of their standing. Nevertheless, there has been a major shift in a lot of aspects. Data provided by IntoTheBlock indicated that Ethereum currently has 73.9 million long-term holders. However, Bitcoin has 33.6 million HODLers, showcasing a disparity of over 40 million between the two assets.\n\nWhile both digital currencies encountered an expansion in this regard when examining year-over-year information, Ethereum once again outperformed with a significant surge of 44.2%, in contrast to Bitcoin\u2019s modest growth of 17%. The foremost position for achieving the highest percentage increase was claimed by Cardano [ADA], as it observed a remarkable upsurge of 170% in its long-term holders over the past year. Following suit, Litecoin [LTC] also exhibited a notable increase of 100%. Dogecoin [DOGE], the OG meme coin and one of the earliest cryptocurrencies, encountered a 26% rise. Currently, it entails 3.4 million long-term holders.\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin\n\nThere are multiple factors behind Ethereum\u2019s overtaking of Bitcoin. Firstly, the ETH network has continuously evolved since its inception. Ethereum\u2019s journey began with the intention of establishing itself as a programmable network. Notably, significant transformation was introduced through events like The Merge, which brought about substantial changes across the network. Conversely, Bitcoin has retained its role as a peer-to-peer payment network and a store of value for its stakeholders.\n\nEthereum\u2019s supremacy in the realm of decentralized finance [DeFi] stands unchallenged. The restricted capabilities of Bitcoin undeniably provide Ethereum with an advantage. The ETH network extends its functionality beyond merely serving as a digital currency. It encompasses features like decentralized applications and intelligent contracts.\n\nDespite a significant drop in the amount of value that Ethereum has secured within the DeFi sector, it continues to maintain a lead over Bitcoin. Among the $38 billion that is locked within the DeFi landscape, Ethereum holds a substantial share of $22.31 billion. In comparison, Bitcoin has a relatively modest amount of $162.6 million locked within this domain.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Is Becoming \u2018Cheaper\u2019 Amidst Rising L2 Transactions\n\nPrice and profitability\n\nRegarding price, Bitcoin has unquestionably outperformed as it predates the introduction of ETH. Bitcoin\u2019s price and market cap have remained unmatched for the longest time.\n\nThe second-largest crypto has witnessed a remarkable increase of 61,363.72% over its complete timeline. In contrast, BTC has achieved an even more extraordinary overall growth of 44.22 million. Similarly, a greater percentage of Bitcoin holders are in a profitable position when compared with Ethereum. Information from IntoTheBlock indicated that approximately 63% of BTC holders are currently in profit, while only 56% of ETH holders are experiencing gains at the present value of the asset. In spite of Bitcoin\u2019s performance, Ethereum has succeeded in attracting a larger number of long-term holders. This also suggested that the market\u2019s dynamics extend beyond valuation.\n\nAlso Read: Is Ethereum Better than Bitcoin?"

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as Bears Push ETH Down to $1,600 Level \u2013 More Pain on the Way?\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is experiencing waves of volatility, with Ethereum at the forefront of this turbulence.\n\nCurrently trading at $1,644, Ethereum has seen a 3.72% decline in the last 24 hours, pushing its market cap to approximately $197.67 billion.\n\nThis bearish movement, reflected in its trading volume of $6.4 billion, raises concerns about the potential for more losses.\n\nAs Ethereum holds its position at #2 on the CoinMarketCap ranking with a circulating supply of 120,215,528 ETH coins, the market anxiously awaits its next move.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction\n\nEthereum\u2018s valuation struggled to surpass the $1,750 mark, consequently erasing its gains relative to the greenback. A further downward trend might emerge if ETH breaches the $1,630 threshold.\n\nDespite attempts, Ethereum could not maintain its footing above $1,700 and subsequently witnessed a significant decline reminiscent of Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory.\n\nA notable dip occurred beneath the $1,660 marker, with the price momentarily plunging under $1,640. After probing the $1,630 support, it\u2019s currently in a phase of loss mitigation.\n\nFurthermore, an emerging bearish trend line, with a resistance around $1,690, is discernible on the hourly ETH/USD chart.\n\nSubsequent resistances lie around $1,680 and near the trend line at $1,700 \u2013 proximate to the 50% Fibonacci retracement of its recent downtrend.\n\nEthereum Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nShould Ethereum surpass $1,700, it could potentially approach $1,750.\n\nA decisive ascent beyond $1,750 may pave the way for Ethereum to target the $1,800 barrier. Further positive traction could propel it towards the $1,850 mark.\n\nConversely, if Ethereum is unable to transcend the $1,700 barrier, we might observe a continued descent.\n\nImmediate support is located around $1,640, with significant supports at $1,630 and $1,600 respectively.\n\nA drop below the crucial $1,600 benchmark might amplify the decline to $1,540.\n\nFurther descent may push Ethereum closer to the $1,480 mark in the foreseeable future.\n\nWall Street Memes \u2013 The Alternative Coin Worth Considering\n\nCurrently, many investors are exploring diverse opportunities within the cryptocurrency realm, and Wall Street Memes has caught their eye. The $WSM presale, representing a meme coin, has stirred considerable excitement among the investment community.\n\nOriginating from Wall Street Memes, a renowned online community catering to these enthusiasts, this coin is making waves.\n\nThe crypto project by Wall Street Memes commenced its presale on May 26, 2023, accessible through their official portal wallstmemes.com.\n\nDuring its initial phase of the thirty-stage rollout, the WSM token was offered at a price of $0.025.\n\nThe response to the Wall Street Memes presale was overwhelmingly positive, with the first day witnessing a collection exceeding $300,000, eventually amassing a total of $25 million.\n\nCurrently, the WSM tokens in this presale phase are available for acquisition at $0.0337.\n\nSeizing this opportunity could pave the way for potential growth.

        "content": "Arkham Intelligence identified Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust as the second-largest Ethereum (ETH) holder in a tweet on Sept. 1.\n\nThe company said that the trust is the \u201csecond largest ETH entity globally\u201d and that the fund contains $5 billion of ETH (seemingly rounding up from $4.9 billion).\n\nAkrham said those funds are divided across more than 500 addresses, each containing $30 million or less. Arkham said it identified those addresses by analyzing activity and cross-referencing with balances that Grayscale reported publicly.\n\nThough Arkham claims that these holdings have never been identified, Grayscale\u2019s own website reveals that its Ethereum Trust has nearly $5.0 billion in assets under management. As such, it seems that Arkham is the first to identify the particular addresses tied to the fund and not the first to discover the fund\u2019s balance.\n\nNotably, there appears to be a significant discrepancy between Arkham\u2019s data and Grayscale\u2019s own reports regarding its other crypto funds. While Grayscale says its Bitcoin Trust holds $16.3 billion, Arkham reports that Grayscale has only $92.1 million in Bitcoin holdings. Various other cryptocurrency assets are also listed on Arkham\u2019s profile for Grayscale.\n\nArkham previously identified Robinhood as the holder of the third-largest Bitcoin wallet (holding $3 billion) and the fifth-largest Ethereum wallet (containing $2.5 billion). Unlike those discoveries, the findings about Grayscale do not concern a single crypto wallet.\n\nNews comes alongside court victory\n\nGrayscale obtained a legal victory on Aug. 29 as courts overruled an earlier rejection from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The current legal outcome will require the SEC to review, but not necessarily approve, Grayscale\u2019s proposal for converting its GBTC fund to a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nGrayscale seemingly abandoned plans to create an Ethereum futures ETF in May, according to reports from Bloomberg at that time.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "US Court Scraps Uniswap Lawsuit, Declares Ethereum a Commodity - Securities.io",
        "content": "After digital asset manager Grayscale secured a win against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), now the leading decentralized crypto exchange (DEX) Uniswap has also bagged a victory.\n\nIn a Wednesday filing, a New York court dismissed a proposed class action lawsuit against Uniswap while classifying popular cryptocurrencies Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) as \u201ccommodities.\u201d\n\nUniswap is an Ethereum-based DEX that allows anyone to swap ERC20 tokens. Any token can be added to the DEX by funding it with an equivalent value of ETH and the ERC20 token being traded. Any ERC20 token can be listed on Uniswap, and there is no requirement for permission, with each one having its own liquidity pool.\n\nA report released by \u200b\u200bthe Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute last year claimed that 97% of tokens on Uniswap were \u201crug pulls\u201d and received pushback from the crypto community.\n\nThe platform charges a 0.3% fee for swapping tokens, which is split by liquidity providers proportional to their contribution to liquidity reserves.\n\nThe DEX was launched in Nov. 2018, but it didn't start gaining significant traction until 2020 as liquidity mining and yield farming platforms gained popularity. Around this time, Uniswap airdropped its governance token UNI to every wallet address that had interacted with the Uniswap protocol.\n\nUniswap released its V2 in May 2020, allowing for direct ERC20 to ERC20 swaps and added support for incompatible ERC20 tokens like stablecoin Tether (USDT) to make it more desirable to use. Then, in May 2021, Uniswap V3 was launched, which brought concentrated liquidity and multiple fee tiers.\n\nIn June 2023, Uniswap published the code for its next iteration, dubbed v4, which will feature limit orders, automated fee revenue compounding for liquidity providers, and customizable plugins. Uniswap v4 pools will also allow traders to execute large orders over time. Uniswap Labs plans to launch v4 after Ethereum's next major upgrade, Dencun.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, Uniswap processed roughly $110 billion worth of trades, surpassing that of the biggest centralized crypto exchange (CEX) in the US, Coinbase, at $90 billion. Uniswap's quarterly spot volume first exceeded Coinbase in Q1, with the exchanges facilitating approximately $155 bln and $145 bln worth of trades, respectively.\n\nThe DEX (v1, v2, and v3 combined) had its highest monthly volume of 2023 in March at just above $70.80 billion and earned $74.26 million in fees, which has been continuously falling to record the lowest for the year at $22.90 bln and $34.27 mln respectively in August, according to DeFi Llama. Uniswap accounts for 64% of all DEX market share.\n\nClick here to learn all about investing in Uniswap (UNI).\n\nScam Token Issuers Real Defendants Not Uniswap\n\nIn April 2022, a group of investors filed a class action lawsuit against Uniswap, its creator and CEO Hayden Adams, foundation, and venture capital backers. This group was composed of six individuals who bought tokens between Dec. 2020 and March 2022 on Uniswap.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform violated US securities laws by failing to register as an exchange or broker-dealer while offering and soliciting securities on an unregistered exchange. This way, the class action lawsuit alleged that the protocol conducted securities sales disguised as digital tokens.\n\nThe suit was looking to hold the platform and the related parties accountable for investors losing money to \u201cscam tokens\u201d that were issued and traded on Uniswap. The \u201cscam tokens' cited in the lawsuit included EthereumMax (EMAX), Alphawolf Finance (AWF), and Bezoge (BEZOGE).\n\nArguing on behalf of a \u201cnationwide class of users,\u201d the lawsuit alleged that Uniswap Labs controlled liquidity pools created by the scammers.\n\nAccording to the plaintiffs, their claim was backed up by the fact that Uniswap held \u201cliquidity provider funds and newly created tokens in Uniswap's proprietary core contracts,\u201d and the defendants \u201clikely\u201d held the majority (at least 88%) of the UNI tokens.\n\nBut the ruling to scrap the lawsuit before it could go to trial said that the true defendants of the case were the issuers of the cited \u201cscam tokens\u201d and not Uniswap. Being a decentralized platform means the protocol cannot control which tokens are listed or who can interact with it.\n\nIn the opinion following Wednesday's order, Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) said the decentralized nature of the protocol made identifying scam token issuers \u201cunknown and unknowable,\u201d leaving no \u201cidentifiable defendant\u201d in the case.\n\nShe then clarified that the plaintiffs argue they have no way to identify the \u201cactual issuers\u201d of the scam tokens. They claim that Uniswap, by \u201cproviding a marketplace and facilities for bringing together buyers and sellers of securities\u201d for a fee, is complicit in the problematic trades. Therefore, they hope the Court might overlook the regulatory gaps in cryptocurrency that leave them without recourse for their specific claims in this case.\n\nA Huge Win for the DeFi Industry\n\nThe case against Uniswap was built on the transfer of title theory, under which the plaintiffs argued that by writing and maintaining the smart contracts that enabled token transactions, Uniswap was effectively transferring the title of the tokens to them. However, the court dismissed this argument, which stated that the protocol's responsibilities in drafting the platform's contracts did not imply it had the title to the tokens traded on the platform.\n\nAnother theory the case was built on was solicitation, which accused Uniswap of directly promoting and soliciting tokens to the plaintiffs in order to increase the value of its native UNI token. However, the court found this theory implausible, which said the plaintiffs failed to provide any substantial evidence to prove that Uniswap had actively solicited the purchase of a security for financial profit.\n\nThe judge also said that the drafter of computer code underlying a particular software platform could not be liable for a third party's misuse of that platform.\n\nAs for plaintiffs' argument that Uniswap was like a self-driving car manufacturer and that the protocol and its creators caused harm by creating a system that allowed for scam tokens, the court stated: \u201cIndeed, this is less like a manufacturing defect, and more like a suit attempting to hold an application like Venmo or Zelle liable for a drug deal that used the platform to facilitate a fund transfer.\u201d\n\nNoting the lack of clarity surrounding how securities laws apply to DeFi, Judge Falia said, \u201cWhatever concerns DeFi transactions engender, the law is currently developing around these exchanges,\u201d she wrote. \u201cRegulators may someday address this gray area.\u201d\n\nShe further called out the lack of relevant regulation and concluded that the concerns of the investors \u201care better addressed to Congress than to this Court.\u201d\n\nShe also cited the unsuccessful class action brought against Coinbase last year for unregulated securities sales in her reasoning. The case has been dismissed with prejudice and, hence, cannot be retried.\n\nIn the ruling, Judge Polk Failla called Ethereum a commodity and declined to \u201cstretch the federal securities laws to cover the conduct alleged\u201d in the case against Uniswap. This is in direct contrast to the SEC chairman Gary Gensler's views, who has called all cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin a security.\n\nThe court's opinion on its dismissal of the class action suit is yet another huge win for the crypto market as it clarifies just how US securities law applies to DeFi. Moreover, the decision showed an understanding of DeFi.\n\nNot to mention, this decision can influence future litigations against decentralized protocols. Crypto lawyers can further use this case as a precedent to defend DeFi applications (DApps) against similar accusations in the future.\n\nThis could empower other DeFi projects to leverage their distributed nature as a defense against allegations of regulatory non-compliance or illegal activities. The dismissal further highlights the challenges regulators face in overseeing the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency industry, particularly in the DeFi space, where traditional regulations may not apply seamlessly.\n\nThis comes only a week after the arrest of Roman Storm, founder of Tornado Cash, who is now out on bail. However, the crypto community is still concerned about attacks on decentralized software development.\n\nAnd it only shows that crypto and DeFi continue to face significant regulatory hurdles in the US. For example, just last week, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) proposed legislation requiring DEXs, NFTs marketplaces, and other entities facilitating digital asset trading to comply with stringent reporting requirements when serving users based in the US.\n\nThis context of evolving regulation makes individual cases against crypto companies especially significant. One such noteworthy case is overseen by Judge Polk Failla, who is also handling the SEC lawsuit against the publicly traded crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), accusing it of facilitating trading of unlicensed securities.\n\n\n\nImpact on Price: Crypto Assets in a Decline Still\n\nDespite this win, the price of the 22nd largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $3.3 bln UNI has fallen 6% in the past 24 hours to now trade at $4.39. The altcoin is down 30.4% in the past month and more than 15% in 2023 so far.\n\nUNI is also recording a negative performance of 27.5% over the past year while being down 90.27% from its all-time high (ATH), according to CoinGecko.\n\nThese latest losses for UNI have actually been due to Bitcoin taking a dip and being back under $26K.\n\nAt the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap has been trading at $26,029, while Ether has been exchanging hands at $1,646. With this, Bitcoin and Ether are up 57.2% and 37.65% year-to-date (YTD) while being down 62.32% and 66.3% from their respective peaks.\n\nToday, the broad crypto space is in red, with the total cryptocurrency market cap down by 3.6% at $1.087 trillion.\n\nThe drawback in prices came after Bitcoin spiked to a high of $28,127 on Tuesday following investment fund manager Grayscale's court victory over the SEC in the crypto company's bid for a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nA federal court ruled that the SEC must review its rejection of Grayscale's attempt to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. This potentially opens the door for a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF is expected to enable greater public interest in investing in the oldest crypto asset without having to actually hold the digital asset. But the SEC has disapproved every such ETF application it's reviewed to date.\n\nNow, earlier this week, Circuit Judge Neomi Rao, writing the DC Circuit Court of Appeals' opinion, said that federal agencies are required to \u201ctreat like cases alike,\u201d referring to the SEC's approval of Bitcoin futures ETFs but denying approval of Grayscale's bitcoin fund \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d The order, however, did not direct the SEC to immediately approve Grayscale's bid to convert its ETF application but rather to review the application again. The SEC has started \u201creviewing the court's decision to determine next steps.\u201d\n\nThis resulted in the price of Bitcoin surging by 8%, one of the largest hourly moves since Terra's collapse last year, in part due to low liquidity. However, BTC has since given up all of those gains and returned to its pre-court decision level.\n\nBitcoin plunged under $26,000 Thursday afternoon and continues to show weakness on Friday, which will see the release of the monthly US jobs report, after the SEC delayed decisions on six applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock, WisdomTree, Invesco Galaxy, Wise Origin, VanEck, Bitwise, and Valkyrie Digital Assets.\n\nThe SEC has delayed making a decision on these applications until October. On Thursday, the Commission extended existing comment periods, allowing for greater public feedback on the applications. With this, the new deadline is mid-October.\n\nWhile the price dipped as decisions on applications got delayed, many have already been expecting a gradual sell-off in Bitcoin. While the approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF will be bullish for BTC and the whole crypto market, until then, currently negative technicals and market fundamentals will be driving the price, which translates to the further downside over the next couple of months.\n\nClick here to learn all about buying Uniswap (UNI)."

        "content": "In an effort to expand its exposure toward cryptocurrencies, Robinhood Markets, Inc. HOOD has added wallet support for Bitcoin and Dogecoin.\n\n\n\nEarlier, the Robinhood wallet \u2014 a multi-chain, self-custody and Web3 wallet \u2014 was restricted to sending and receiving tokens built on the Ethereum blockchain only. However, as customers asked for more assets on more chains, Robinhood decided to expand its product offerings.\n\n\n\nThe company said that now all users of Robinhood wallet can send and receive Bitcoin and Dogecoin.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Robinhood has begun rolling out swap features for selected users that allow them to trade Ethereum for more than 200 different assets.\n\n\n\nThe Robinhood wallet can charge gas fees from its users, which is the price for transacting on Ethereum, from any tokens they hold.\n\n\n\nThus, the crypto wallet will now allow users to own, send and receive crypto on Arbitrum, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Optimism and Polygon networks; swap cryptocurrencies on Ethereum and Polygon; and connect to a wide range of decentralized applications.\n\n\n\nThe Robinhood wallet, which combines a simple and intuitive design with powerful tools that push the boundaries of a typical wallet, gives its users full control over their cryptocurrencies such that only they can hold and maintain the private keys to their assets.\n\n\n\nThe Robinhood wallet was launched for the general public six months ago. Since then, the wallet has seen significant adoption globally, with hundreds of thousands of users in more than 140 countries.\n\n\n\nOver the past six months, shares of Robinhood have gained 13.7% against the 10% decline of the industry.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCurrently, HOOD carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The amendment post-July gave banks the go-ahead to begin exploring cryptocurrency operations.\n\n\n\nA few years ago, banks were not very interested in the crypto and digital asset space. But, after witnessing increased demand for the emerging market, banks and financial institutions started to embrace cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\nIn July 2021, JPMorgan JPM became the first major bank in the United States to allow its financial advisors to give all its wealth-management clients access to cryptocurrency funds. Next month, it came to light that JPMorgan was offering its Private Bank wealth management customers access to an in-house passively managed bitcoin fund. The offering was being made in partnership with bitcoin powerhouse New York Digital Investment Group.\n\n\n\nJPMorgan also launched a division focused on digital assets named Onyx. The Wall Street giant even launched its digital currency, JPM Coin.\n\n\n\nIn August 2022, BlackRock, Inc. BLK partnered with cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase Global, to provide its institutional clients access to digital currencies.\n\n\n\nThrough the partnership, BLK\u2019s institutional clients have access to crypto trading, custody, prime brokerage and reporting via Coinbase Prime, which is the exchange\u2019s institutional platform, providing a wide range of features and tools.\n\n\n\nAlso, BLK launched a spot Bitcoin private trust for institutional clients in the United States. The fund seeks to track the performance of Bitcoin, less expenses and liabilities of the trust.\n\n\n\nHowever, in July 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said that the application filed by BLK for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund was inadequate.\n\n\n\nReportedly, the filing did not have enough detail with respect to the \u201csurveillance-sharing agreements.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "A new zero-knowledge proof (ZK-proof) technology is set to improve the ability to access and verify historical data from the Ethereum blockchain, with deep chain validation cited as a usability barrier of the network.\n\nTechnology firm Herodotus has released its on-chain accumulator, which uses storage-proof cryptography, allowing users to verify data from any point of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain without needing a third party. The solution makes use of StarkWare\u2019s STARK proofs, the ZK-proof technology co-invented by mathematician Eli Ben-Sasson.\n\nStarkWare presented Herodotus with a custom-built instance of its shared prover service SHARP, which enables advanced scaling efficiency using recursive proofs. The latter allows a virtual machine to provide \u201cproofs of proofs\u201d by generating proofs of transactions or blocks in parallel and real-time, batching them into a subsequent proof.\n\nRelated: More TPS, less gas: Ethereum L2 Starknet outlines performance upgrades\n\nAt a slightly more technical level, the accumulator acts as a cache that stores block headers. If the accumulator has a header in its cache, the respective storage-proof computation can use it for validation.\n\nA visual representation of the possible use of recursive proofs to batch a variety of information into subsequent verified and cached proofs. Source: StarkWare\n\nIf the header is not cached, the prover has to generate a proof to cover the requested block range, add the block header to the accumulator and then complete the requested storage proof computation.\n\nAs the name suggests, the on-chain accumulator essentially accumulates proofs that rollup prior proofs, drastically reducing the time it takes to verify the Ethereum blockchain and associated data at any point in the network\u2019s history.\n\nHerodotus chief technology officer Marcello Bardus notes that the technology removes the need to traverse the entire blockchain on the blockchain itself:\n\n\u201cWe can do it off chain, generate an accumulator and just cherrypick one specific block without iterating from the entire chain on the chain itself.\u201d\n\nStarkWare notes that Storage proofs could prove groundbreaking as an alternative to cross-chain bridges that rely on third-party oracles to track and verify data.\n\nRelated: StarkNet overhauls Cairo programming language to drive developer adoption\n\nHerodotus co-founder Kacper Koziol added that the accumulator is an innovation that Ethereum has long needed to align with blockchain principles of transparency and accessibility. The technology will essentially allow any user to access any point in Ethereum\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cThis will be very powerful. For the first time in the history of blockchains, people are going to be able to prove the correctness of any aspect of anyone\u2019s on-chain information.\u201d\n\nThe two teams highlight the potential for storage proofs to build \u201cWeb2 equivalent applications,\u201d tapping into the pioneering ability to access and verify Ethereum blockchain data autonomously.\n\nAccount recovery is touted as one potential use case, where the ability to verify on-chain data could trigger a proverbial dead man\u2019s switch or automate insurance protocols that use historical on-chain events to trigger smart contract payouts.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Recursive inscriptions: Bitcoin \u2018supercomputer\u2019 and BTC DeFi coming soon"

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst says that one mid-cap altcoin could see a massive correction as whale transactions including the asset see a decline.\n\nCrypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 29,900 followers on the social media platform X that blockchain oracle provider Chainlink (LINK) could dip by as much as 50% from its current price.\n\n\u201cChainlink: unlike the June LINK price correction \u2013 where whale transactions and their holdings rose as prices fell \u2013 this time, we\u2019re seeing whale transactions decline while their holdings stay steady.\n\nThis isn\u2019t good! If LINK breaks below the $5 support level, expect a correction to $4 or even $3.\u201d\n\nAccording to his chart, whale transactions of at least $1 million in LINK since May 19th reached a daily high of about 20 in late July. In the final days of August, transactions declined to under 10 and were nearly nonexistent on August 31st. A dip in whale transactions is a bearish sign indicating a lack of trading interest.\n\nChainlink is currently trading for $5.98, down 0.1% in the last 24 hours.\n\nNext, the analyst says that Bitcoin (BTC) could decline 10% from its current value if it loses a key support level.\n\n\u201cBitcoin: On-chain data suggests that BTC lacks strong support below the $25,400 mark.\n\nIf BTC breaks below this threshold, it could swiftly correct down to $23,340.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading for $25,827 at time of writing, down 4.7% in the last 24 hours.\n\nLastly, the analyst is warning that Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 blockchain Optimism (OP) is trading in a bearish flag pattern, suggesting that it is on the verge of a continued move to the downside.\n\n\u201cOptimism appears less than optimistic! OP is developing a bear flag on the 4-hour chart.\u201d\n\nThe trader\u2019s chart suggests Optimism could decline to $0.71 over the next two months, a more than 47% drop from its current price of $1.35 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Relic Protocol ports all of Ethereum's data to layer-2 - Blockworks",
        "content": "Data recorded on the blockchain is often perceived as everlasting, and in many ways, it is. Ethereum, for instance, is expected to operate for as long as the internet exists. Every piece of data in every block is publicly accessible, forming a continuous chain from its genesis in 2015 to the present \u2014 18+ million blocks later.\n\nBut when it comes to smart contracts, only the previous 256 blocks \u2014 less than an hour of data \u2014 are accessible.\n\nAccessing all of Ethereum\u2019s historical data relies heavily on platforms like Etherscan, which indexes the data off-chain, and oracles like Chainlink. While these are essential tools, they require users to trust the data providers.\n\nRelic Protocol, developed by blockchain security firm ChainLight, instead offers a trust-minimized way for smart contracts to call upon Ethereum\u2019s vast history, replacing platforms with pure mathematical precision.\n\nV2, which launched today, will now bring that data to other blockchains as well, starting with zkSync Era.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to build the building blocks for the app developers to build on top of,\u201d Brian Pak, ChainLight\u2019s CEO, told Blockworks.\n\nBayo Akins, who handles business development at zkSync developer Matter Labs, noted that Relic is the first oracle provider on zkSync to use zk-SNARKs as part of their oracle design.\n\n\u201cThis deployment not only improves data accessibility and cost-efficiency in the Ethereum scaling ecosystem but also provides developers with the tools they need to innovate and operate trustlessly,\u201d said Akins.\n\nRelic Protocol enables access to the data on-chain thanks to zero-knowledge proofs, removing the need to trust traditional oracles. It stores historical data in a compressed format, allowing developers to prove certain past facts. For example, a user can verify Uniswap pricing for a specific token from a year ago \u2014 all within a smart contract \u2014 without needing to push that data on-chain from an oracle.\n\nThis could be a boon for applications like borrowing and lending markets. Historical price volatility data could be used to tweak lending parameters trustlessly, minimizing the need for governance involvement.\n\nThat\u2019s not possible today. Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts, by design, depend on third-party data sources to access older data, due to the so-called \u201cBLOCKHASH\u201d operation in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nThe reason for the 256 block lookback period is largely pragmatic: Maintaining the hash of every block ever produced would require substantial and ever-growing storage requirements on every Ethereum node and would be detrimental to the system\u2019s scalability and performance.\n\nIf a smart contract needs access to data from blocks older than that, the workarounds available require trust assumptions and can be costly.\n\nEthereum\u2019s history has shown the status quo is not ideal. For instance, DeFi protocols have suffered hundreds of millions of dollars in losses due to oracle manipulation attacks.\n\nSimilar approaches\n\nOther teams have set out to tackle the same problem.\n\nAt the StarkWare Summit in San Francisco, Herodotus, a startup working on storage proof technology, today debuted an \u201con-chain accumulator\u201d which uses STARK proving and will also make historical Ethereum data accessible on Starknet.\n\nBy early October, the whole history should become verifiable, according to StarkWare.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an innovation that is sorely needed to bring Ethereum in line with the principles of transparency and accessibility that are so central in blockchain communities,\u201d said Kacper Koziol, co-founder of Herodotus.\n\nStarkware president Eli Ben-Sasson noted that the work by Herodotus will boost layer-2 usability and transparency.\n\n\u201cWhen we started scaling on layer 2, we said to ourselves that this is going to lead to all sorts of out-of-the-box ideas that we can\u2019t yet envisage, and it\u2019s so exciting to see this happening,\u201d he said in the statement.\n\nA ChainLight spokesperson noted Herodotus is also working on zkSync support.\n\nFairer airdrops\n\nOn the identity front, the Relic Protocol can facilitate the creation of an account\u2019s reputation based on its past interactions with the blockchain.\n\nThat can come in handy for prospective DAOs looking to distribute a governance token using an airdrop scheme. Currently, developers have to use an Ethereum archive node to take a snapshot in time and determine which accounts interacted with a given protocol or had a certain token balance.\n\nFrom that, they typically build a Merkel tree to determine how many tokens a given account qualifies for, and finally deploy an airdrop contract with that Merkel tree root. Users then connect and provide a Merkel proof to receive their tokens.\n\nTrust is required each step of the way; the archive node or the person deploying the airdrop contract could maliciously corrupt the data in a way that\u2019s hard to detect, ChainLight\u2019s chief technology officer Andrew Wesie said in a presentation last month.\n\nRelic saves those steps. \u201cInstead they just call into Relic to verify that the account should be eligible for the airdrop,\u201d Wesie said, who pointed to the use of a storage or transaction proof, for instance.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s really about taking something that used to require off-chain centralized trusted service and instead of bringing it on-chain and doing it in a way that is trustless,\u201d he said.\n\nChainLight envisions a world where the benefits of both Ethereum and zkSync can be seamlessly integrated, offering developers the best of both worlds, and without sacrificing decentralization. Through an open-source SDK, developers can access circuits and smart contracts.\n\nLike Herodotus, ChainLight has plans to extend support to more chains.\n\n\u201cUltimately, this is not just enhancing options on zkSync Era to meet the differing needs of application developers, but it will open the path for new use cases to be created,\u201d Matter Labs\u2019 Akins said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Polygon's new open-source L2 chain developer stack to support Ethereum ZK-powered layer 2s - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Ethereum ecosystem could welcome a variety of new layer 2 (L2) protocols built on Polygon\u2019s newly released open-source codebase, Chain Development Kit, which harnesses zero-knowledge proof (ZK-proof) technology to ensure security and fast finality.\n\nJordi Baylina, co-founder and technical lead for Polygon, spoke to Cointelegraph exclusively about the new toolset, which is publicly available on a GitHub repository:\n\n\u201cThe motivating idea is simple: It should be easy and seamless for developers to launch a ZK-powered layer 2 on Ethereum, tailored to the requirements of their project.\u201d\n\nAccording to Baylina, a key aspect is that Polygon CDK enables automatic access to liquidity across all of Polygon\u2019s chains as well as the wider Ethereum ecosystem, providing \u201con-demand scale, without fragmenting liquidity.\u201d\n\nThe Ethereum developer pointed to a number of different projects building CDK-powered chains across a variety of use cases, including payment-specific L2s, decentralized finance, gaming, social-specific platforms, and creator or nonfungible token platforms.\n\nRelated: Are ZK-proofs the answer to Bitcoin\u2019s Ordinal and BRC-20 problem?\n\nBaylina also highlighted the customizability of CDK for different appchains, featuring customizations for rollup or validium mode, zkEVM or another ZK-powered execution environment, various data availability solutions, native token and gas token customization, centralized or decentralized sequencer mode as well as permissioned networks with granular allowlists.\n\nThe importance of ZK-proof technology is another factor Baylina stressed, highlighting Polygon Labs\u2019 belief that zero-knowledge is the future of scaling Ethereum. As the Hermez zkEVM lead explains, chains launched with Polygon CDK are automatically connected to a shared ZK bridge and plugged into an \u201cinterop layer,\u201d which is a cross-chain communication protocol.\n\n\u201cSuppose there are thousands of chains in the Polygon ecosystem. It\u2019s inefficient for each of these to submit their proofs directly to Ethereum. Instead, the interop layer will receive proofs from chains and submit a single ZK-proof that proves the state of all Polygon chains.\u201d\n\nBaylina said the technology unlocks sub-minute cross-chain transactions and creates the perception of a single-chain environment.\n\nCointelegraph also asked about the key differences between CDK and other Ethereum ecosystem programming languages like ZK-proof pioneer StarkWare\u2019s Cairo codebase.\n\nBaylina explained that the architecture unlocked by Polygon CDK is different in that it enables automatic access to shared liquidity through a ZK bridge and interop layer of an L2 ecosystem secured by working ZK-proofs.\n\nHe finished by reaffirming the belief in ZK-proofs as the future of Ethereum scalability given its fast finality and withdrawal times, when compared with week-long delays by fraud proofs that feature in optimistic rollup L2 solutions.\n\n\u201cZK makes better bridges but also secures chains by rigorous math, without a need for social-economic components required by fraud proofs.\u201d\n\nCointelegraph previously explored the Ethereum layer-2 ecosystem, unpacking the basics of Ethereum rollups and the different approaches to scaling the smart contract blockchain.\n\nMagazine: Recursive inscriptions: Bitcoin \u2018supercomputer\u2019 and BTC DeFi coming soon"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction for 2023, 2024, 2025, 2030 and Beyond - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum has rapidly become the second most valuable cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. With its recent transition to a proof-of-stake consensus model and its expanded capabilities, Ethereum\u2019s future looks bright. This guide provides a data-driven Ethereum price prediction for the short, medium and long-term.\n\nWhat is Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain platform created by Vitalik Buterin in 2015. Like Bitcoin, it uses a blockchain to store transaction records. But Ethereum\u2019s key innovation was enabling decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts on its blockchain.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain serves as a secured public ledger for verifying and recording transactions. Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform that acts as \u2018gas\u2019 to power transactions and run smart contracts.\n\nSome key aspects of Ethereum include:\n\nSmart contracts\n\nThese are applications that run exactly as programmed without risk of downtime or third-party interference.\n\nDecentralized platform\n\nEthereum operates via a global peer-to-peer network, avoiding centralized control.\n\nProgrammable blockchain\n\nDevelopers can use Ethereum to build and deploy decentralized applications of all kinds.\n\nProof-of-stake consensus\n\nEthereum has transitioned to a more efficient proof-of-stake system called Casper that requires less energy.\n\nThese features make Ethereum extremely versatile and a promising platform for decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, DAOs, dApps and much more.\n\nFactors Influencing Ethereum Price\n\nEthereum\u2019s growth has been explosive, but not without volatility. Here are some factors that affect ETH prices.\n\nCryptocurrency Market Trends\n\nLike most cryptos, Ethereum price depends heavily on trends in the overall crypto market. Bitcoin\u2019s price actions in particular have a ripple effect on altcoins.\n\nGas Fees and Transaction Costs\n\nEthereum gas fees rising during times of network congestion reduces usage and can suppress price. Efforts like scaling solutions aim to lower transaction costs.\n\nMainstream Adoption\n\nWith increasing real-world Ethereum usage cases in DeFi, NFTs etc. mainstream adoption is rising, leading to higher demand and prices.\n\nCompetition\n\nWhile Ethereum is the dominant smart contract platform currently, competition from projects like Solana, Cardano etc. can potentially erode its market share and affect ETH prices.\n\nRegulations\n\nRegulatory crackdowns or increased clarity on crypto/Ethereum can both positively and negatively impact prices by affecting investor sentiment.\n\nTechnology Upgrades\n\nRecent Ethereum developments like the Merge upgrade to proof-of-stake or ETH 2.0 implementating sharding may improve capabilities and affect value over time.\n\nBurning Ether\n\nBurning ETH taken out of circulation through EIP-1559 helps reduce supply and may gradually increase the value of remaining Ether.\n\nEthereum Price History\n\nEthereum launched in 2015 at an initial price of around $0.30. Here is a look at key price developments since then.\n\n2015-2017 \u2013 The Early Days\n\nAfter launch, Ethereum traded in the $1-$15 range till early 2017. As crypto markets gained steam in 2017, Ethereum shot up to $380 by June.\n\nSeveral factors drove growth:\n\nIncreasing developer adoption with global Ethereum hackathons held in 2017. Hundreds of projects were built on Ethereum.\n\nMainstream coverage of Ethereum as a revolutionary technology in magazines like Forbes\n\nICO boom \u2013 projects raising millions via Ethereum-based ICOs bought Ether at inflated prices\n\nThis growth was unsustainable long-term and by September 2018, ETH had fallen to around $170. But immense developer interest and real-world usage potential was now apparent.\n\n2018-2020 \u2013 Building During the Bear Market\n\nIn the 2018-2020 bear market, Ethereum stayed afloat better than most altcoins, remaining above $100.\n\nMajor mileposts include:\n\nDespite market conditions, steady progress continued on Ethereum 2.0 upgrades like Beacon Chain, proof-of-stake, and sharding.\n\nIncreasing DeFi (decentralized finance) dominance with Ethereum facilitating over 90% of activity and billions in value.\n\nLaunch of Ethereum-based Tether (USDT), the most used stablecoin. USDT transactions dwarfed payment coins.\n\nERC-20 standard became the de-facto for issuing new tokens. Most ICOs continued to launch on Ethereum.\n\nThis demonstrated Ethereum\u2019s real-world utility and helped prevent steeper declines.\n\n2021 \u2013 2022 \u2013 From Mainstream Mania To Manic Depression\n\n2021 marked a parabolic rise for Ethereum, breaking out beyond crypto circles into mainstream recognition. The parabolic rise also brought an abrupt peak, sending Ethereum prices crashing all throughout 2022 as the US Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates to the highest levels in decades.\n\nKey factors driving this bull run:\n\nContinued DeFi growth, with the total value locked in DeFi rising from $20B to over $100B during 2021.\n\nNFT mania beginning in early 2021, with Ethereum hosting headline-grabbing sales like Beeple\u2019s $69 million digital art piece.\n\nEthereum network upgrades like Berlin hard fork and London\u2019s EIP-1559 built investor confidence.\n\nLarge companies like Visa and JP Morgan began settling transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nInstitutional investment rose with SEC allowing Ethereum futures ETFs.\n\nThis perfect storm took ETH from under $800 in January 2021 to an all-time high of $4,800 in November 2021. In 2022 the crypto market endured a painful bear market, with Ethereum dropping below $1,000.\n\nHowever, a major milestone was reached in September 2022, with Ethereum completing The Merge upgrade to become a proof-of-stake blockchain. This reduced Ethereum inflation and carbon footprint.\n\nWhile sentiments remain low currently, The Merge was a huge technological leap cementing Ethereum\u2019s lead in blockchain development. The stage is potentially set for the next bull market.\n\nRecent Ethereum Price Performance\n\nUnlike Bitcoin which found a local bear market bottom in November 2022, Ethereum set a local low in mid-June at around $878 per ETH. An almost immediate bounce took Ether over double from the low to $2,000, but retested $1,000 before the year ended. Throughout 2023 while Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have recovered, Ethereum\u2019s rally has been relatively muted.\n\nIn August 2023, Ethereum once again retested $1,500, possibly putting in a lower low before the start of a more substantial rally or collapse.\n\nShort Term Ethereum Price Prediction for 2023\n\nSince the 2022 local bottom, Ethereum has been forming an Ascending Triangle pattern. This is predominantly a bullish pattern, but can occasionally appear in a bear market before the final move in a sequence, ultimately breaking down.\n\nTargets based on the measure rule put an immediate upside breakout around $3,800 per ETH, while a breakdown would send Ether back down to $871 for a double possible double bottom or new low. With only a few months left in 2023, trajectories will be limited based on time.\n\nMedium Term Ethereum Price Prediction for 2024 \u2013 2025\n\nBased on historical 4-year market cycles and Elliott Wave Principle patterns, Ethereum appears to be at a critical junction, where it could retrace further and break down from a large rising wedge structure, or could rally and fill out the upper portion of the pattern one more time.\n\nThe black-colored wave scenario puts ETHUSD at $10,000 between 2024 and 2025. Meanwhile, the red-colored corrective wave scenario suggests Ether will reach around $440 during a C-wave of continuation.\n\nLong Term Ethereum Price Prediction for 2030 and Beyond\n\nIf Ethereum establishes itself as the primary platform for decentralized apps and finance by 2030, its utility could be immense. Based on a long-term linear mean, Ethereum could fluctuate between $20,000 and nearly $100,000 per ETH by the year 2030 arrives.\n\nEthereum Price Predictions by Experts\n\nHere what some industry experts and analysts forecast for Ethereum:\n\nPopular analyst Benjamin Cowen is conservative in his Ethereum price prediction, claiming that \u201cEthereum has the potential to eventually achieve $10,000 to $15,000 per ETH in the next five to ten years.\u201d He cautions that scaling needs to be achieved without diluting ETH\u2019s value.\n\nRealVision CEO Raoul Pal predicts ETH at $20,000 by 2025. CertiK CEO Ronghui Gu forecasts Ethereum at $30,000 to $50,000 by 2030. Justin Bennett sees ETH potentially reaching $40,000 if bullish sentiment returns.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction FAQs\n\nHere are some common questions about Ethereum price predictions:\n\nWhat was Ethereum\u2019s lowest price?\n\nEthereum hit record lows between $0.4 to $0.7 in 2015 and 2016 during its earliest days. Its recent low was around $800 in June 2022.\n\nWhat was Ethereum\u2019s highest price?\n\nEthereum\u2019s all-time high price was $4,891 reached in November 2021. It also briefly exceeded $4,600 in the same month.\n\nHow high can Ethereum realistically go long-term?\n\nBased on expert forecasts and models, Ethereum potentially could reach over $100,000 by 2030, and even $500,000+ in the 2050 timeframe as a bull case scenario if it achieves global adoption.\n\nCan Ethereum drop to zero?\n\nWhile unlikely, the possibility that Ethereum drops to near zero can\u2019t be ruled out entirely. Competition, failure to scale sufficiently, or critical bugs in the codebase are threats.\n\nWhy is Ethereum price volatile?\n\nAs a relatively new asset class, Ethereum is prone to high volatility. Speculation, hype cycles, and changing investor sentiment amplify price swings.\n\nWhen will Ethereum\u2019s price stabilize?\n\nEthereum price volatility should stabilize significantly once it achieves full-scale mainstream adoption as a blockchain platform, which could happen within the next 5-10 years.\n\nWill Ethereum go up in 2023?\n\nThe most likely scenario based on market trends is Ethereum rising gradually throughout 2023, although price will remain volatile in the short-term.\n\nInvestment Disclaimer: The content provided in this article is for informational and educational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum price prediction: The crypto market experienced a slight uplift, courtesy of Grayscale\u2019s triumph over the SEC. While some investors cashed in their profits, a majority of the cryptocurrencies continued to reflect bullish tendencies. Ethereum is now under the microscope, with many wondering if it will hit the $2,000 mark before January 2024.\n\nWhy is Ethereum Price UP?\n\nAfter consolidating briefly around the $1,650 mark, Ethereum leaped towards $1,750, registering a remarkable increase of more than x% in just 24 hours. While some profit-booking did take place, the price has now stabilized around $1,705. The rally can be attributed to Grayscale\u2019s successful lawsuit against the SEC, which has reignited the flame of hope for wider cryptocurrency acceptance.\n\nWhat is Grayscale Investments?\n\nFor those unfamiliar, Grayscale Investments is not a new player on the block. Established by Barry Silbert in 2013, it has been a giant in the digital currency asset management space. As of my last update in September 2021, Grayscale was recognized as one of the dominant institutional holders of Bitcoin, among other cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Will Ethereum reach $2,000?\n\nThe million-dollar question: Will Ethereum climb to $2,000? All signs seem to lean towards a positive trajectory. If Ethereum can consistently hold above the $1,700 price level, we might witness a steady climb towards the coveted $2,000 mark. This optimism stems from Ethereum breaking through a significant medium-term resistance, generally seen as a bullish sign. However, like any financial forecast, there are caveats. Should Ethereum fall below $1,680, the scenario could change, dragging it down to a range between $1,600 and $1,650.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin briefly dropped below $26,000 early this morning as optimism around the approval of a Bitcoin ETF application was again delayed.\n\nYesterday, the SEC extended the deadline to approve or deny six ETF decisions by 45 days, citing the need for additional time to evaluate the applications.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe negative price movement over the past day reversed the bullish gains in BTC following the Grayscale court decision earlier this week.\n\nOn August 29, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturned the SEC\u2019s decision to block Grayscale from converting its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to a spot Bitcoin ETF, ordering the Commission to review the application again.\n\nThe ruling raised hopes of imminent approval, pushing Bitcoin\u2019s price surged to a peak near $28,000, per CoinGecko, on Wednesday after the court\u2019s verdict came out.\n\nAnother delay from the securities regulator crushed the market\u2019s optimism, however, sending Bitcoin prices back towards $26,000.\n\nEthereum (ETH) followed the top cryptocurrency with a 3.5% dip since yesterday.\n\nThe crypto market cap declined by 3.5%, losing $11.2 billion overnight.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNotably, Maker (MKR) and Toncoin (TON) resisted the bearish move, standing above the rest of the market with positive gains. MKR was up 5% and TON 3% over the last 24 hours.\n\nMaker\u2019s governance token has likely benefited from accumulation by wealthy investors.\n\nOn-chain analysis outlet Santiment reported that addresses holding between 100 and 10,000 MKR coins bought around 61,500 MKR tokens since mid-July, worth $70.9 million at current prices, per CoinGecko.\n\nToncoin\u2019s bullish momentum can be attributed to ecosystem development by the TON Foundation, the team managing and developing atop the Ton blockchain.\n\nThe Foundation released a Telegram-centric Web3 app store and also launched a community-driven initiative, Believers.ton, for promoting ecosystem development.\n\nMacro signals mean uncertainty for crypto\n\nThe global macroeconomic landscape also sent mixed signals yesterday, jarring all financial markets, including crypto.\n\nThe US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) released key economic data that reduced the market's expectations regarding a potential interest rate hike.\n\nA higher benchmark interest rate eats into corporate profits while making low-risk instruments such as government bonds more lucrative, diminishing the future values of stocks and other risk assets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index for July stood at 3.3%, 0.3% higher from June.\n\nThe PCE index is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, tracking the prices of goods and services that consumers purchase.\n\nWhile the inflation levels were higher than the previous month, PCE readings for July aligned with the market\u2019s expectations raising hopes that the Fed might pause on interest rate hikes.\n\nThe S&P 500 index traded slightly lower on Thursday, closing 0.16% lower at 4,507.67 points. While the dollar index (DXY) against other global reserve currencies gained 0.44% Thursday, last trading at 103.56 points.\n\nInvestors are now eagerly awaiting the August U.S. employment data scheduled for release today, which will provide more clarity about the potential rate hike decision."

        "content": "The crypto markets suffered hard over the past 24 hours. From a technical analysis standpoint on higher timeframes, Ethereum\u2019s price seems willing to drop further, as things still look bearish.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Edris\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily chart, the price was able to retest the critical $1,750 level but has failed to maintain above it, getting heavily rejected to the downside. If ETH breaks below the short-term $1,650 support level, it will lead to a deeper drop toward the $1,400 area.\n\nMoreover, the 50-day and 200-day moving averages are about to go through a bearish crossover, with the 50-day crossing the 200-day to the downside (Death Cross). This is considered a very negative signal and could mark the beginning of another mid-term bearish phase.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nLooking at the 4-hour timeframe, it is evident that the $1,750 resistance zone has rejected the price to the downside, pushing it back toward the $1,650 support level. The market is yet to show any intention for a rebound from the mentioned support area, as it is trying to break through it.\n\nThe RSI indicator has also dropped below the 50% threshold, indicating that the bears are now in control. Therefore, if ETH fails to hold above the $1,650 level and reclaim the $1,750 area quickly, a further decline would be imminent.\n\nOn-Chain Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nEthereum Taker Buy Sell Ratio\n\nFollowing weeks of consolidation in a tight range, Ethereum\u2019s price has recently experienced a significant drop. Analyzing the futures market metrics would be beneficial in determining where the price is likely to go next.\n\nThis chart shows the 30-day standard moving average of the taker buy-sell ratio metric. The metric indicates whether buyers or sellers are executing their orders more aggressively. Values above one are considered bullish, while values at one are associated with a bearish sentiment.\n\nAs the chart demonstrates, the taker buy-sell ratio has decreased over the past few months, constantly dropping deeper below one. As long as this trend persists, bearish price action is more likely. For the price to start a new impulsive uptrend, futures traders should buy more aggressively (using market orders), as indicated by the metric rising above one."

Earlier, the SEC\u2019s Chair, Gary Gensler said that every cryptocurrency, other than Bitcoin, is a security and falls under the purview of his agency. However, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) maintained that Bitcoin and Ethereum are commodities.\n\nJudge Failla is overseeing the lawsuit of the SEC against Coinbase, which alleged that the crypto exchange listed several unregistered tokens.

        "content": "In under a day, the pre-sale for the newest smartphone running on Ethereum sold out. This launch saw all 50 units, equipped with a special operating system, fly off the shelves.\n\nSource : ethOS Website\n\nWhat is the Ethereum Phone?\n\nThis phone is a version of the Google Pixel 7a. But, it\u2019s not just any phone. It runs on ethOS. EthOS stands for Ethereum operating system. The name also has roots in Greek, meaning \u201ccharacter\u201d.\n\nOne special thing about this phone is its built-in Ethereum light client. It allows the phone\u2019s system to validate blocks on its own. So, the phone becomes a \u201clight node\u201d in the Ethereum network.\n\nThe Ethereum phone comes packed with tools. You can manage payments, send messages, and more. Plus, it\u2019s user-friendly. For example, it links up with the Ethereum Name Services. This lets users make payments simply. The device also supports Ethereum Virtual Machines and Layer 2 networks.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/EthereumPhone/status/1694755024121811426\n\nSpecial NFT Purchase Method\n\nThis phone wasn\u2019t just up for grabs. Only 50 were for sale. If you wanted one, you first needed an ethOS non-fungible token (NFT). You\u2019d then \u201cburn\u201d or destroy this NFT to get your phone.\n\nOn OpenSea, some are selling the ethOS NFT for three Ethereum. That\u2019s about $5,000. It\u2019s a huge jump from the $499 Google Pixel 7a.\n\nFrom the Website:\n\nWant the first phone with ethOS ready to go? This Pixel 7a has a special ethOS to honor Nouns for backing the project. After making your NFT, you\u2019ve got a year to swap it for the phone.\n\nBig thanks to our first supporters. All the pre-sale ethOS phone NFTs are now claimed!\n\nStarting in Fall 2023, we\u2019ll have more for sale. Thanks for loving ethOS!\n\nHow Do I Get My Phone?\n\nBuy the NFT: Get the ethOS NFT for 0.39\u039e. Swap & Get Your Phone: Trade in your NFT for a phone loaded with ethOS.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe rapid sell-out of the Ethereum phone showcases the growing interest in the fusion of smartphones and blockchain technology. With the unique ethOS and features tailored for the Ethereum network, this phone has set a new standard for Web3 devices. As the lines between digital assets like NFTs and everyday gadgets blur, consumers and tech enthusiasts eagerly await what\u2019s next in this innovative space. Keep an eye out for the regular sales in Fall 2023, as the ethOS phone\u2019s journey is just beginning!\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Ethereum"

This individual seems to have a knack for making poor choices when it comes to perpetual contracts, and their recent moves have left many in the crypto world utterly baffled.\n\nString of disastrous investments\n\nThis particular investor has seen their Ethereum long positions go up in smoke not once but twice during recent market downturns. The losses? A jaw-dropping $5.1 million. Most people would probably take this as a sign to step back and rethink their approach. Not this investor. In a bewildering move, they have decided to go long on Ethereum yet again, this time diving in at an entry price of $1,717.\n\nRolling dice once more\n\nWhat is truly perplexing is that Ethereum's current market value is teetering around $1,704.75. This means our audacious investor is already staring down the barrel of another loss. What is the game plan here? Are they hoping for a miraculous market turnaround, or are they simply throwing caution to the wind?\n\nWhile Ethereum's market has been holding steady, this investor's puzzling actions have not gone unnoticed. Market watchers and crypto pundits are scratching their heads, trying to make sense of it all. Is this a case of overconfidence, or perhaps a lack of understanding of the inherent risks?\n\nIgnoring basic principles can lead to catastrophic financial setbacks. Whether this investor is an eternal optimist or just lacks trading acumen, their actions serve as a lesson to us all: have a well-thought-out strategy and prepare for every possible scenario."

        "title": "Ethereum Traders Capitulate As Rally Slows Down: Why This Is Good - NewsBTC",
        "content": "On-chain data shows that Ethereum traders are capitulating following the slowdown of the rally, something that may turn out to be positive.\n\nEthereum Traders Are Selling At A Loss Right Now\n\nAccording to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, ETH investors are getting increasingly frustrated as they are now participating in significant loss-taking.\n\nThe relevant indicator here is the \u201cratio of daily on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss,\u201d which, as its name already implies, compares the profit-taking volume to the loss-taking volume for any given cryptocurrency.\n\nThis metric works by going through the on-chain history of each coin being sold/transferred to see the price at which it was previously moved. If this last selling price for any coin was less than the current spot price, then that particular token is now being sold at a profit.\n\nNaturally, the sale of this coin would count under the profit-taking volume. Similarly, the opposite type of coins would contribute towards the loss-taking volume.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in this ratio for some of the top assets in the cryptocurrency sector over the past few months:\n\nLooks like the value of the metric has been negative for most of these coins in recent days | Source: Santiment on X\n\nWhen the value of this metric is positive, it means that the profit-taking volume outweighs the loss-taking volume right now. On the other hand, negative values suggest the dominance of loss-taking in the market.\n\nFrom the chart, it\u2019s visible that many of these top assets have seen negative values of the indicator recently as the rally that began following the Grayscale news has slowed down.\n\nEthereum, however, stands out among these coins as the indicator\u2019s value for the asset is significantly more negative than the likes of Bitcoin and Cardano, who are observing loss-taking volumes that are only mildly more than the profit-taking ones.\n\nAt the metric\u2019s current value, the Ethereum investors are making loss-taking transactions at a rate nearly double that of the profit-taking ones. This difference between ETH and the other top assets would suggest that the coin traders are showing the least amount of patience.\n\nThis could be because they don\u2019t think the cryptocurrency would continue its rally anymore, or if it does, the profits wouldn\u2019t be as large as for some of the other altcoins, so they may be exiting here at losses to go to greener pastures.\n\nThis high amount of loss-taking could, however, actually turn out to be beneficial for Ethereum. Historically, whenever investors have participated in capitulation, rebounds in the price have become more probable.\n\nThe likely explanation behind this pattern may be the fact that investors pick up the coins that these relatively weak hands sell with a stronger conviction, who provide a better foundation for a sustainable price surge.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Ethereum can use this capitulation to bounce off towards higher levels or if the rally will remain muted for a while longer.\n\nETH Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $1,700, up 3% in the last week.\n\nETH has been moving sideways since the surge | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "DISCLAIMER: This article is a SPONSORED Press Release and does not constitute Finbold's editorial content nor undergo monitoring. Crypto assets/products involve significant risks. Do not invest unless you are prepared to lose your entire investment. For a full disclaimer, please click here.\n\nAs the end of August approaches, leading cryptocurrencies look set to close the month at a lower price than when they entered it. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down around 6.1% in the previous 30 days. Meanwhile, Ethereum was down roughly 8.3% and XRP had lost nearly 25% of its value.\n\nAll three suffered from a significant price crash on August 17. Despite a strong rally that was felt across crypto markets on Tuesday (Aug. 29), it was short lived and none of them fully recovered from their mid-month losses.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the top cryptocurrencies\u2019 prospects going into September.\n\nCan Bitcoin Reclaim $30,000 by the End of September?\n\nHistorically, September has not been a good month for Bitcoin. Out of 13 of them, only four have seen the cryptocurrency appreciate in value. And every year from 2017 onward, BTC has closed the month at a lower price than when it started. Will 2023 buck the trend of recent years?\n\nFor Bitcoin traders, $30,000 represents a critical symbolic milestone, yet the cryptocurrency has only briefly traded above the $30,000 mark a few times this whole year, and it remains a difficult ceiling to break through.\n\nIn a recent analysis of Bitcoin\u2019s 20-day moving averages, the crypto analyst Eric Krown errs on the side of a more bearish forecast. But, in general, he anticipates another sideways month for Bitcoin, which he expects to trade within the $26,000 to $28,000 range for most of September.\n\nHowever, Krown made his initial prediction for the month before Tuesday\u2019s rally. In a later video on Wednesday, he discussed the potential for a bearish breakout if it shows sustained momentum in the coming days.\n\nAccording to Krown, should BTC manage to stay above $27,200, it could go on to climb as high as $31,000 or $32,000 in the coming weeks.\n\nETH On Track to Outperform BTC\n\nJust as BTC has barely broken above $30,000 all year, ETH has had similar trouble holding ground above $2,000.\n\nYet if the cryptocurrency manages to break through that barrier in September, it may be on track for a major rally. Moreover, so far in the second half of 2023, ETH has outperformed BTC. And as the analyst Ibrahim Ajibade recently argued, if it breaks above $2,000, this trend is likely to continue.\n\nOne important fact that Ethereum price analysts often consider when making forecasts is the level of Bitcoin Dominance, i.e., the value of Bitcoin as a proportion of the total crypto market capitalization.\n\nAfter peaking at 52% at the end of June, Bitcoin dominance has steadily fallen for the last two months and currently stands at just below 50%.\n\nCommenting on this trend in a recent video, the analyst and trader known as CryptoWorld Josh noted that the Bitcoin dominance rate is showing signs that it could break down and fall even further. If this happens, he said that ETH could significantly outperform BTC.\n\n\u201cIf we do end up seeing a confirmed break below around 47.5%, [\u2026] that is where we could see a possible altcoin season and much bigger gains in the altcoin market compared to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHowever, he noted that this could still take some time: \u201cIt\u2019s likely that that will not happen for at least the next month,\u201d he remarked.\n\nXRP Price Tied to 200-Day EMA\n\nAs with other leading cryptos, XRP has closely tracked its moving averages in recent months.\n\nExponential moving averages (EMAs) are a set of widely observed technical indicators in the world of cryptocurrency trading. They represent the average closing price of an asset over a given time period, adjusted for its volatility.\n\nAt present, XRP\u2019s 200-day EMA suggests a slight increase from its current price of $0.528\n\nto around $0.6 by the end of September.\n\nHowever, should it break with this long-term pattern, it could drop to a range of between $0.5040 and $0.4600, the crypto analyst Lockridge Okoth noted recently. He added that any movement below $0.4800 would increase the odds for a continued downtrend, potentially sending the price of XRP down as much as 10%.\n\nConversely, Okoth observed that bullish momentum may see the price of XRP surge as high as $0.8 per token, a high point the cryptocurrency hasn\u2019t seen since July.\n\nOther Cryptos to Watch in September\n\nAlongside the more established coins, it\u2019s always worth keeping a tab on new cryptocurrencies, which can often see quicker gains than bigger coins.\n\nWith that in mind, here are two new tokens to watch in September.\n\nWall Street Memes Set for Tier-1 Exchange Debut at the End of the Month After $25m Raise\n\nOne cryptocurrency lots of traders have been talking about in recent months is Wall Street Memes (WSM), which has seen over $25 million invested into its presale.\n\nInspired by the Wall Street Memes subreddit, WSM has managed to amass the largest presale event of the summer thanks to an active community of supporters and viral social media strategy.\n\nWith an online following that numbers over a million, WSM brings together all the things that have propelled more established memes coins like DOGE to their current heights: strong community engagement, eye-catching design, and a total disregard for Wall Street and its traditional financial markets.\n\nWhile analysts are divided on what will happen to the price of BTC, ETH or XRP in the next month, one thing is for certain: At the end of September, WSM will be listed on exchanges, where many commentators believe it will rise well above its low presale price of just $0.0337.\n\nIn fact, the development team behind WSM is aiming for a $1 billion market capitalization once the token hits the open market. This would represent a 15x return on investment for early investors.\n\nVisit Wall Street Memes Presale\n\nSonik Coin Also Turning Heads as Stake-to-Earn Meme Coin Raises Nearly $900K\n\nSonik Coin (SONIK) is another new meme coin that has exploded onto the scene faster than anyone could have anticipated.\n\nSeemingly out of nowhere, SONIK has now raised nearly $900,000 in its presale. That means the project is almost halfway toward its presale goal of just over $2 million.\n\nSONIK\u2019s fundraising efforts were lighting fast from the beginning. But fueled by a red hot crypto market and surge of bullish sentiment, the new token has accelerated its path toward $2 million in recent days.\n\nAt its current pace, SONIK is on track to hit its target within the next five days. However, until then, early investors still have a chance to purchase tokens for just $0.000014 each.\n\nOnce the presale is finalized, the team behind Sonik Coin are targeting a market capitalization of $100,000. And given the pace with which the initial coin offering (ICO) has unfurled so far, their ambition to be the fastest zero-to-one-hundred-million market cap meme coin may just be realized.\n\nFor reference, a $100 million market cap would see presale participants multiply their investment nearly fifty times over!\n\nBut, given SONIK\u2019s built-in staking mechanism, they might not be in a rush to sell their tokens. Of the total supply, 40% of all Sonik Coins are reserved as rewards to people who opt to hold and stake instead.\n\nVisit Sonik Coin Presale"

        "content": "Bitcoin was back in red on Thursday as traders took some profit off the table amid the volatile market sentiments. The ruling by the Federal Court on Tuesday is seen as a clearing the path for a spot bitcoin ETF by the Grayscale. However, overall sentiments remain volatile for the traders.\n\n\n\nBitcoin was back in red on Thursday as the largest crypto token dropped about a per cent but remained above $27,000-levels. Its largest peer, Ethereum, declined more than a per cent to breach below $,1700 mark again. Price action in the altcoins was on the lower side during the early trade.\n\n\n\nBitcoin has stabilized its price above the $27,000 threshold, as the markets self-corrected following rapid expansion caused by Grayscale\u2019s victory against the US SEC yesterday, said Edul Patel, Co-Founder & CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"This ruling, though, has cultivated a sense of cautious hope within the market regarding an impending verdict on the Bitcoin spot ETF within the United States. Investors are in anticipation of an update from the SEC about Bitwise's application, with the initial deadline set for September 1st. In contrast, Ethereum has been trading around $1,700,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring a few exceptions, all top crypto tokens were trading slightly lower on Thursday. Solana dropped more than 4 per cent, while Polkadot tanked 3 per cent. Polygon and Tron shed 2 per cent each. Among the gainers, Toncoin jumped about a per cent, while Dogecoin posted mild gains.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading slightly lower, falling to $1.08 trillion-mark, as dropped as much as a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes tanked more than 45 a per cent to $29.74 billion.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market has traded sideways with downward pressure in the last 24 hours. Investor sentiment, however, continued to climb and jumped 3 points since yesterday; currently in the neutral zone with a score of 52/100. Most of the top 10 cryptos by market capitalization were trading in the red, said Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager at CoinSwitch Markets Desk.\n\n\n\n\"Robinhood, one of the largest financial brokers in the US, has been gaining significant traction in its wallet app after enabling wallet support for BTC and DOGE.

The withdrawal of the ETF application was unexpected; however, in the filing, a statement read, \u201cThe fund seeks to provide investors with capital appreciation. There can be no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objective.\u201d\n\nBitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan advocated for SEC approval of all ETFs in a recent Bloomberg interview. The ETF intended to invest in either Bitcoin (BTC) futures contracts or Ether (ETH) futures contracts, determined by market capitalization. Bitwise also collaborated with ProShares to launch another ETF around the same time.\n\nIn the withdrawal statement, Bitwise said:\n\n\u201cThe Trust no longer intends to seek effectiveness of the Fund and no securities of the Fund were sold, or will be sold, pursuant to the above-mentioned Post-Effective Amendment to the Trust\u2019s Registration Statement.\u201d\n\nThe SEC has delayed its decision on Bitcoin ETF applications from WisdomTree, Invesco Galaxy, Valkyrie, VanEck, BlackRock, Bitwise and Fidelity. According to a SEC filing dated Aug. 31, the commission has designated a longer period in which it may review spot Bitcoin ETF applications from WisdomTree, VanEck, Invesco Galaxy, Bitwise and Valkyrie, Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust proposed by Fidelity, as well as BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF. The next set of deadlines for the SEC is in mid-October, but these may also be delayed to the SEC\u2019s third batch of deadlines in January or to the final possible decision dates in March, April and May of next year.\n\nBitwise was among the early asset management firms that lodged applications with the SEC for Bitcoin ETF products. Its January 2019 application with the U.S. securities regulator proposed a BTC-backed ETF tracking the Bitwise Bitcoin Total Return Index, which is calculated based on the value of Bitcoin derived from BTC transactions taking place on exchanges.\n\nRelated: SEC delays decision on 6 spot Bitcoin ETF applications\n\nThe company\u2019s proposed Bitcoin ETF was touted to draw market data from a number of cryptocurrency exchanges in an effort to provide a trusted representation of the wider cryptocurrency markets. The firm would also require third-party custodians to physically hold Bitcoin.\n\nBitwise\u2019s recent withdrawal isn\u2019t its first. Earlier this year, it submitted an application for an Ethereum Strategy ETF designed to invest in both front-time and back-time Ethereum futures.

        "content": "OnlyFans Parent Company's Ethereum Investments Revealed in Financial Report\n\nRecent financial documents from the UK have unveiled that Fenix International, the leading company behind the subscription service OnlyFans, had a significant investment in Ethereum, the popular cryptocurrency. The disclosure shows a close to $20 million investment made over the span of 2021 and 2022.\n\nHowever, as crypto witnessed some fluctuations last year, the investment didn't entirely go in their favor. By the close of November 2022, the value of their Ethereum holdings shrunk by $8.5 million. By that month\u2019s end, when Ethereum\u2019s market price stood at $1,295 per unit, the company's total Ethereum was valued at roughly $11 million.\n\nYet, this financial setback in the crypto domain didn't cast a shadow on the company\u2019s overall performance. Fenix International, throughout the year ending November 30, 2022, saw its revenues soar. There was a noticeable 17% boost in their earnings, rising from $5 billion the previous year to an impressive number of almost $6 billion.\n\nMoreover, the subscription-based platform, predominantly known for adult content, also reported substantial growth in its user base.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nA NY judge dismissed a planned class action lawsuit against Uniswap.\n\nPlaintiffs say it harmed investors by allowing the trading of fraudulent tokens.\n\nDisproving SEC, the judge labeled Ether (ETH) as a commodity.\n\nThe same judge will hear the case involving Coinbase and the SEC.\n\nA New York judge dismissed a planned class action against the top decentralized cryptocurrency exchange Uniswap on Wednesday, August 30, 2023, and classified popular cryptocurrencies Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) as \u201ccommodities\u201d.\n\nBreach of U.S. Securities Laws\n\nThe DeFi platform allegedly breached U.S. securities laws by failing to register as an exchange or a broker-dealer, offering and soliciting securities on an unregistered exchange. It also failed to register as a broker-dealer, according to a complaint brought by a group of investors in April 2022 against Uniswap and its founder, Hayden Adams.\n\nIn the lawsuit , investors who fell victim to scam tokens created and traded on the protocol are seeking to hold Uniswap accountable. Tokens like EthereumMax (EMAX), Bezoge (BEZOGE), and Alphawolf Finance (AWF) are among those named in the lawsuit..\n\nThe recent decision to dismiss the lawsuit before trial identified the alleged \u2018scam token\u2019 issuers as the defendants, not Uniswap. Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the Southern District of New York recognized ETH as a commodity and declined to apply federal securities laws to the claims against Uniswap.\n\nThis was in contrast to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chief Gary Gensler who has so far refrained from referring to the cryptocurrency as a security.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision to dismiss the class action may have an impact on future lawsuits against decentralized protocols and potentially even lawsuits on breaking U.S. securities laws.\n\nAdditionally, Judge Polk Failla is in charge of the SEC\u2019s case against Coinbase.\n\nCase Thrown Out\n\nAccording to Judge Polk Failla\u2019s ruling published after the order on Wednesday, August 30, 2023, the decentralized architecture of the Uniswap Protocol made it impossible to identify scam token issuers, resulting in the absence of an \u201cidentifiable defendant\u201d in the case\n\n\u201cUndaunted, they now sue the Uniswap Defendants and the VC Defendants, hoping that this Court might overlook the fact that the current state of cryptocurrency regulation leaves them without recourse, at least as to the specific claims alleged in this suit,\u201d the Judge stated .\n\n\u201cIt defies logic that a drafter of computer code underlying a particular software platform could be liable under Section 29(b) for a third-party\u2019s misuse of that platform.\u201d\n\nPlaintiffs claimed that Uniswap facilitated the trades in question by \u201cproviding a marketplace and facilities for bringing together buyers and sellers of securities\u201d for a transaction fee in the absence of \u201cactual issuers\u201d of the \u201cscam tokens,\u201d \u201choping that this Court might overlook the fact that the current state of cryptocurrency and especially ETH regulation, leaves them without recourse, at least as to the specific claims alleged in this suit.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 stated that Uniswap was similar to a self-driving car maker and that the protocol\u2019s developers harmed people by designing a system allowing fraudulent tokens, but the court rejected this.\n\nThe Judge asserted: \u201cThe Court declines to stretch the federal securities laws to cover the conduct alleged, and concludes that Plaintiffs\u2019 concerns are better addressed to Congress than to this Court.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the case is more akin to holding a platform like Venmo or Zelle accountable for facilitating a drug trade via financial transactions, rather than a manufacturing flaw, as the opinion noted.\n\nThe court concluded that the investors\u2019 grievances are \u201cmore suitable for Congress than this Court,\u201d citing the absence of relevant regulation.\n\nWrapped BTC Viewed As a Commodity?\n\nConsenSys regulatory chief, Bill Hughes, on social media that The SDNY (Failla, J.) made it clear in its ruling that Ethereum is classified as a commodity, not a security, in the Risely v. Uniswap case.\n\nHe elaborated on how, albeit tentatively, this notion suggests that wrapped BTC might be viewed as a commodity. He is quite certain that the adage \u201cEthereum is a commodity\u201d is true, and he is so convinced of this that he is willing to stake his own home on it. It doesn\u2019t appear like the judge inserted this adage by accident.\n\nThe SDNY (Failla, J.) also explicitly found in its August 29 decision in Risely v. Uniswap that Ethereum is a commodity, not a security. No analysis of the issue, just the conclusion, but still, pretty definitive statement if you ask me. \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/KEc5Pf5kTC \u2014 Bill Hughes : wchughes.eth \ud83e\udd8a (@BillHughesDC) August 30, 2023\n\nThings have improved, Hughes continued, emphasizing that liquidity providers retain ownership of their tokens when contributing to a pool. He stressed the importance of this concept beyond AMM-related matters, as it influences how courts perceive liquid staking procedures and the taxation of various smart contract transactions."

        "content": "ETH breaking the $1,700 may have set the tone for altcoins to blossom.\n\nBTC dominated the market but attention has been shifting toward SOL and ADA.\n\nEthereum [ETH], considered the pioneer altcoin and the one with the largest market cap, seems to be setting the stage for what could potentially be the resurgence of the altcoin season, Glassnode founders opined.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nThe term \u201caltcoin season\u201d refers to a period where cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin [BTC] outperform the king coin. While there\u2019s no such thing as guaranteed gains during the period, altcoin season is usually a good time for traders and investors to diversify their portfolios.\n\nETH is about to shift the trend\n\nWhenever the altcoin season is in its early stages, ETH\u2019s dominance increases and serves as a catalyst for others to gain momentum. Founders of the on-chain analytic platform Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, who used the Negentropic handle on X, said ETH crossing the $1,700 resistance, was a sign that dominance was shifting to altcoins.\n\nRally for Summer Closing ETH thrives in the ongoing bull market, with price surging to $1736, breaching $1700 resistance. ?Tether, Binance Coin, Ripple, Cardano, Dogecoin, Solana, Tron, and Polygon also join the profit-making spree. ?Amid asset rally, Altcoin Signal shifts\u2026 pic.twitter.com/PQziTNQU24 \u2014 ??????????? (@Negentropic_) August 31, 2023\n\n\n\nThe duo also noted that also mentioned that assets like Cardano [ADA], Ripple [XRP], and Solana [SOL] could also be gearing up for more gains. However, Grayscale\u2019s partial win against the U.S. SEC seems to have reduced ETH\u2019s potential to take over the market dominance from BTC.\n\nGlassnode gives an insight into the dominance using the BTC-ETH dominance metric. The BTC-ETH Dominance tracks the macro outperformance trends between the top two crypto-assets.\n\nIt considers only the Market Cap of Bitcoin, relative to the combined market cap of Bitcoin plus Ethereum. Lower values and downtrends indicate outperformance by Ethereum. On the other hand, higher values and uptrend suggest Bitcoin still dominates the market.\n\nAt press time, peak ETH dominance was -0.085 while for BTC, it was +0.085. The disparity in these values indicated that ETH had not yet flipped BTC\u2019s dominance. Therefore, the altcoin season might take a while before resumption.\n\nADA, SOL rise to the occasion\n\nBut is attention actually shifting to Ethereum and other altcoins? One metric that describes this possibility is social dominance. Social dominance compares the number of posts/discussions around an asset compared with other cryptocurrencies in the top 100.\n\nAt the time of writing, ADA\u2019s social dominance was 1.643%. SOL\u2019s social dominance was down to 0.774% while XRP was 1.421%. Of all three, only the metric for XRP decreased while ADA and SOL increased.\n\nIf the social dominance continues to maintain the same level or improve, then the altcoin season may appear soon.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Cardano Profit Calculator\n\nHistorically, this season occur about ten months before the Bitcoin halving. Considering the current market condition, the altcoin season may just be a few weeks or months away."

It unlocks all the opportunities of popular EVM-compatible networks ti the developer communities of WASM-compatible languages. Besides cross-ecosystem compatibility, the new development makes Arbitrum Nitro operations faster and cheaper.\n\nWASM developers can build dApps on Arbitrum Nitro as Stylus launches in testnet\n\nArbitrum Stylus, a programming environment for WebAssembly languages, goes live in testnet on Arbitrum Nitro. With this instrument, millions of C, C++ and Rust developers can deploy their dApps and tokens on Arbitrum (ARB) ecosystem blockchains without changing their codebases.\n\nArbitrum Day is here! \ud83d\udc99\ud83e\udde1\n\n\n\nCongrats to the @offchainlabs team for the monumental achievement of Stylus.\n\n\n\nWe are excited to educate our community on this breakthrough, and hold discussions in the forum as the #ArbitrumDAO will have to vote soon on upgrading the ecosystem with\u2026 https://t.co/PDctYQ5Qbb \u2014 Arbitrum (\ud83d\udc99,\ud83e\udde1) (@arbitrum) August 31, 2023\n\nThe novel instrument offers a new level of composability and modularity: with Arbitrum Stylus, a Solidity developer can easily call a Rust program or rely on another dependency in a different language. Also, for instance, a token contract written in Rust can be deployed to the EVM chain.\n\nArbitrum representatives stressed that this release is a landmark milestone in terms of blockchain accessibility as there are only 20,000 Solidity developers in the world, while millions are working on WASM languages:\n\nAt the heart of Stylus is EVM+: bringing the best of both EVM and WASM worlds. Developers still get all of the benefits of the EVM, including the ecosystem and liquidity, while getting efficiency improvements and access to existing libraries in Rust, C, and C++. All without changing anything about how the EVM works. EVM equivalence is no longer the ceiling, it\u2019s the floor.\n\nA major addition to the Arbitrum (ARB) stack was unveiled on Arbitrum Day (Aug. 31); Arbitrum One launched in mainnet two years ago, while Arbitrum Nitro kicked off on Aug. 31, 2022.\n\n$20,000 bounty campaign kicks off at ETHGlobal\n\nThe new technical design allows non-EVM dApps to be operated faster and cheaper. Per the estimations of the Offchain Labs team, Arbitrum Stylus allows for 10x improved computation and 100x improved memory usage.\n\nThis, in turn, paves the way for previously unseen use cases for the blockchains of the Arbitrum (ARB) ecosystem:\n\nCryptography libraries can now be deployed as custom precompiles, permissionlessly. RAM-intensive generative art libraries, bringing existing games written in C++ on chain, and compute-heavy AI models all become more accessible.\n\nTo introduce new development to the global Ethereum (ETH) community, Offchain Labs starts a $20,000 bounty program. It will go live at ETHGlobal in New York on Sept. 22, 2023.\n\nIn the coming weeks, Arbitrum Stylus will be audited by the Trail of Bits Web3 cybersecurity team, Offchain Labs statement goes."

Notably, a July ruling by a U.S. federal judge classified XRP as a security when sold to institutional investors, but not when sold to the general public or distributed to staff members.\n\nFollowing the ruling, SEC Chair Gary Gensler was left \u201cdisappointed,\u201d with the agency planning to appeal the decision.\n\nThe disagreement between regulatory bodies adds another layer of complexity. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have been debating jurisdictional rights concerning cryptocurrencies.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler's assertion that \"everything other than Bitcoin\" falls under the SEC's jurisdiction as securities, which clashes with the CFTC's claim that cryptocurrencies, including Ether, should be treated as commodities.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies has prompted lawmakers to introduce various bills in Congress aimed at bringing clarity to the issue.\n\nHowever, these bills propose differing solutions, including categorizing cryptocurrencies as securities or commodities, and determining the regulatory authority responsible for overseeing them.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmong these bills, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act suggests a process for classifying cryptocurrencies.\n\nOn the other hand, the Digital Commodity Exchange Act proposes the registration and regulation of crypto spot exchanges under the CFTC.\n\nMeanwhile, the Digital Asset Market Structure Bill introduces the concept of SEC certification for cryptocurrencies, ensuring sufficient decentralization before granting commodity status."

The information emanated from a financial disclosure that Fenix invested $19.9 million in ETH. Moreover, the CEO, Leonid Radvinsky, is stated to have added to the Ethereum holdings.\n\nThe surge of institutional investors joining decentralized finance has generated a lot of discussions and traction in the financial sector. Organizations seek to invest in the crypto industry due to the potential of the imminent projects to generate massive capital gains. The new entrant, Bitcoin Spark, has managed to amass retail and individual investors.\n\nIs Ethereum a Good Investment?\n\nThe debate circulating Ethereum's capability of being a solid investment that will generate massive returns for investors never seizes. Having its digital currency, ETH, the crypto is stated to have an enormous surge in the coming years. Ethereum is among the safest long-term investments that entrepreneurs can seek as they diversify their portfolios. However, Bitcoin Spark\u2019s potential suppases that of Ethereum.\n\nBitcoin Spark Attracts Institutional Investors\n\nThe development of digital currency depends on promising platforms willing to offer scalability, efficiency, and interoperability. The new bitcoin hard fork, Bitcoin Spark, has created a frenzy in blockchain and traditional finance markets. Investors seek such opportunities to enter the ecosystem as these projects tend to perform well in the long run.\n\nTo provide security to investors, the project has been audited by three prominent leading auditing firms: Cognitos, Vital Block, and Contract Wolf. Bitcoin Spark is considered the new era of improved consensus mechanisms that will promote equality and incentivize ledger technology development through a validation process. For this reason, the platform aims to be the best Bitcoin alternative in the entire DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThe network has its gas token, referred to as BTCS. The platform rewards users who actively participate in activities engaging in the network's operations. For instance, validators are rewarded in BTCS tokens for participating in confirming new blocks and providing processing power to the network.\n\nBitcoin Spark has a similar number of token supply to that of Bitcoin's 21 million. The tokens have been allocated to launch supply (4.55 million), averaging 21.66%, and mining rewards (16.45 million), averaging 78.33%. Community members can continue to mine BTCS for not less than 120 years.\n\nThe ongoing Bitcoin Spark's presale has been a roaring success. As the project looks to start phase 4 of its ICO, the retail token price will increase. Currently, the ICO phase three is winding up and this might be the last time BTCS tokens retail at low prices.\n\nIn the final touches of the third ICO phase, crypto whales have joined the bandwagon. Investors seeking to participate in the project can purchase BTCS at $2 and earn a 12% bonus. Not even another imminent presale project has offered such incredible perks to its community members. Moreover, the audacious investors who purchased the token in the third stage will have 560% capital gains during the launch period set to occur on November 30th.\n\nLearn more about Bitcoin Spark on:\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article.

The SEC also claimed that Uniswap\u2019s governance token, UNI, was itself a security that should have been registered with the agency.\n\nHowever, the court ruled that the SEC failed to prove that UniSwap or UNI met the criteria of the Howey test, which is used to determine whether an asset is a security or not. The court also stated that Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, are commodities and not securities, as they are not backed by any central authority or issuer.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision is a significant boost for the cryptocurrency industry, as it provides more clarity and certainty on the legal status of digital assets in the US. It also reaffirms the distinction between centralized and decentralized platforms and recognizes the innovation and potential of DeFi.\n\nUniswap\u2019s founder, Hayden Adams, celebrated the victory on Twitter, saying that \u201cthis is a huge win for UniSwap and the whole crypto community. We are grateful for the support of our users, developers, and partners who believe in our vision of a more open and fair financial system.\u201d\n\nThe SEC\u2019s director of enforcement, Gurbir Grewal, announced on August 30 that the agency would focus on the \u201cmost significant\u201d cases of fraud and manipulation involving digital assets, and that it would not target DEXs or their users for merely listing or trading tokens that may be deemed as securities.\n\nAdams praised this approach as \u201cbased\u201d, a slang term that means admirable or courageous, and said that it would foster innovation and experimentation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. He also argued that DEXs are not responsible for the quality or legality of the tokens that are traded on their platforms, and that users should exercise due diligence and research before investing in any project.\n\n\u201cDEXs are permissionless protocols that enable anyone to create and trade any ERC20 token. They do not perform any vetting, endorsement, or promotion of the tokens that are listed. Users are solely responsible for their own actions and decisions,\u201d he wrote. Adams added that Uniswap, the leading DEX by trading volume and liquidity, has implemented several measures to protect users from scam tokens, such as displaying warnings, requiring manual token imports, and removing default token lists.\n\nHe also encouraged users to report any suspicious or fraudulent activity to the SEC or other relevant authorities, and to use tools such as Etherscan or DeFi Pulse to verify the legitimacy and security of the tokens they trade. Adams concluded his tweet by saying that he hopes the SEC\u2019s stance will encourage more developers to build on top of Uniswap and other DEXs, and to create innovative and valuable products and services for the DeFi community.\n\nThe market also reacted positively to the news, as UNI surged by more than 4.70% in the following hours, reaching a new all-time high and currently trading above $4. Bitcoin and Ethereum also gained momentum, breaking above $27,000 and $1,700 respectively.\n\nFirstMate raises $3.75 million in Dragonfly-led Round\n\nFirstMate, a startup that provides AI-powered solutions for maritime logistics, announced today that it has raised $3.75 million in a seed round led by Dragonfly Capital. Other investors include Y Combinator, Naval Ravikant, and several angel investors from the shipping industry.\n\nThe company, which graduated from Y Combinator\u2019s Winter 2021 batch, aims to streamline the complex and fragmented processes involved in global trade. FirstMate\u2019s platform uses machine learning and computer vision to automate tasks such as vessel tracking, cargo inspection, and document verification. The platform also provides data-driven insights and recommendations to help shippers optimize their operations and reduce costs.\n\nFirstMate\u2019s co-founder and CEO, said that the company was born out of his own frustration with the inefficiencies and lack of transparency in the maritime sector. And has a background in naval engineering and shipping management, said that he wanted to create a solution that would make the industry more modern and accessible.\n\n\u201cWe believe that maritime logistics is ripe for disruption and that AI can play a key role in transforming it. Our vision is to build a platform that connects all the stakeholders in the trade ecosystem and enables seamless and secure transactions. We are thrilled to have the support of Dragonfly Capital and other investors who share our vision and have deep expertise in both AI and shipping,\u201d Smith said.\n\nDragonfly Capital\u2019s partner said they are impressed by FirstMate\u2019s team and technology. Dragonfly said FirstMate has the potential to become a leader in the maritime logistics space and create significant value for its customers.\n\n\u201cFirstMate is tackling a huge and underserved market that has been largely overlooked by the tech industry. They have built a powerful platform that leverages AI to solve real pain points for shippers and carriers. We are excited to partner with them and help them scale their business,\u201d Lee said.\n\nFirstMate said that it will use the new funding to expand its team, develop new features, and grow its customer base.

        "title": "Cardano to be Bigger than Bitcoin and Ethereum? Hoskinson Reveals Why ADA is Primed to Explode - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nSpeaking during an event at the end of August, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of the popular blockchain Cardano, gave some insight into the future of the network. The foundational speech, titled \u2018The Future of Cardano Governance in the Age of Voltaire,\u2019 was delivered at the opening of Rare Evo, a prominent blockchain and crypto conference in Denver, Colorado.\n\nHoskinson highlighted the importance of Cardano as a leader in the blockchain space, saying that \u201cthe other two big guys, Ethereum and Bitcoin, have recused themselves\u201d. He emphasized that both Bitcoin and Ethereum refused to have on-chain governance. He mentioned that in the case of Bitcoin, this anarchy meant that people had to rely on everything the initial founder did.\n\nThis makes changes to the original infrastructure impossible, and any changes imposed on the blockchain result in a fork, rendering the forked network useless for purists. It also implies relying on the original developer to get all aspects right on the first try, an almost unattainable feat.\n\nThe fundamental idea behind the blockchain is to establish a system that functions without the need for trust among participants. However, as per Hoskinson, Ethereum doesn\u2019t even attempt to incorporate on-chain governance. This absence of governance efforts permits the platform\u2019s founder to uphold an enduring dominant position without checks.\n\nCardano Aims to Change the Way We Live\n\nUnlike Ethereum, for example, Cardano\u2019s endgame is to achieve full decentralization and to operate through user consensus and voting rather than being controlled by a single party. He acknowledged that this idea might seem intimidating to some but emphasized its necessity to drive positive change and move away from the traditional top-down hierarchy. He admitted that \u201cit takes [power] away from people,\u201d which is why many shy away from true decentralization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardano\u2019s stability record stands out, with zero downtime since its launch in 2017, spanning almost 6 years. This accomplishment can be attributed to its engaged community, which has established nearly 3,200 stake pools and is currently staking around 23 billion ADA. These efforts contribute to both decentralization and the blockchain\u2019s security. In contrast, certain other blockchains, including Solana, have faced network outages, and even tech giants like Amazon and Google have experienced downtime.\n\nThe co-founder of Ethereum highlights that Cardano\u2019s strength comes from its decentralized nature, emphasizing his belief that the blockchain will encompass a purpose beyond mere monetary functions.\n\nHe envisions Cardano to be the \u201cbiggest cryptocurrency in the world,\u201d adding, \u201cI think it\u2019s going to become more than a cryptocurrency; I think it\u2019s going to become the backbone of a new digital nation, a new society, a place where we can finally trust each other again.\u201d\n\nCardano would be a platform encompassing voting, money, and \u2018every dimension and aspect\u2019 of our digital lives.\n\nThough technical challenges are still being worked on, Hoskinson says these can be overcome, as the true challenge lies within the social changes to leverage Cardano to make the world more equitable and fairer for all. While Hoskinson has a bold vision for Cardano, the transition to a fully decentralized governance will make or break the whole ecosystem."

        "title": "Cross-Chain Versus Multi-Chain - LCX",
        "content": "What Is Multi-Chain?\n\nMulti-chain is a form of blockchain technology in which multiple chains are interconnected in a federated setting. Federated chains enable permissioned access between specific entities while preserving the autonomy of each network individually. This also means that in order for participants on one chain to transact with participants on other chained networks, they must first agree upon a set of norms. It also allows organizations or individuals to securely maintain their own private data stores, as each network could independently operate its own consensus algorithm.\n\nIn a multi-chain environment, each instance of a decentralized application (dApp) comprises a set of smart contracts that are isolated from other applications on other blockchains. Through the evolution of the multi-chain ecosystem, the availability of new on-chain environments has increased the total aggregate throughput of the smart contract economy, resulting in the enrollment of more users who can transact at a lower cost. In addition, each network takes a unique approach to scalability, decentralization, mechanism design, consensus, execution, data availability, and privacy, among other factors. All of these approaches can be implemented and battle-tested simultaneously in the multi-chain ecosystem to advance Web3 development.\n\nWhat Is Cross-Chain?\n\nCross-chain is a form of blockchain technology in which multiple chains are interconnected in an interoperable environment, enabling the exchange of assets and data across multiple networks. This permits the development of decentralized applications (Dapps), smart contracts, and secure transactions across multiple chains without the need for a centralized intermediary or controlling entity.\n\nCross-chain functionality enables developers to build natively cross-chain applications, where a single instance of a decentralized application (dApp) can function across multiple smart contracts deployed across multiple blockchains, as opposed to deploying multiple individual instances across distinct networks.\n\nIn a cross-chain context, different smart contracts on different chains execute distinct duties while remaining synchronized and supporting a single use case within a unified application. This allows developers to take advantage of the unique benefits of various networks.\n\nDifferences Between Cross Chain and Multi Chain\n\nWhile cross-chain and multi-chain are often used interchangeably, they actually refer to different concepts. Cross-chain refers to the ability to transfer assets between different blockchain networks, while multi-chain refers to the use of multiple blockchains within a single ecosystem.\n\nThe primary difference between these two concepts is their focus. Cross-chain technology is primarily concerned with interoperability, and enabling communication between different blockchains. Multi-chain technology, on the other hand, is primarily concerned with scalability and flexibility, enabling multiple blockchains within a single ecosystem.\n\nAnother key difference between cross-chain and multi-chain is their use cases. Cross-chain technology is well-suited for use cases that require the transfer of assets between different blockchains, such as decentralized exchanges or cross-chain lending platforms. Multi-chain technology, on the other hand, is well-suited for use cases that require the use of multiple blockchains within a single ecosystem, such as gaming platforms or supply chain management systems.\n\nUse Cases for Cross-Chain and Multi-Chain\n\nCross-chains are ideal for DApps that require high scalability, low latency, and cost-effectiveness due to their open and interoperable nature, whereas multi-chains provide superior security options for protecting sensitive data or information in a closed environment. Due to their distinct advantages over conventional solutions, there has been an increase in use cases for both technologies in recent years, spanning from finance to healthcare to gaming.\n\nCross Chain Scalability versus Multi-Chain\n\nCross-chain increases scalability by enabling multiple ledgers to communicate and interact with one another in order to process more transactions. Multi-chain, on the other hand, is limited by the number of nodes participating in the network, as only certain entities are permitted access. Nonetheless, multi-chains offer enhanced security because the data stored within them can be kept confidential and secure.\n\nCross-Chain vs. Multi-Chain Security\n\nCross-chain and multi-chain security are contingent upon the underlying consensus mechanism. Cross-chains utilize a distributed system in which data is cryptographically stored across multiple ledgers, so an assault on a single node does not compromise the entire network. Multi-chains are typically permissioned, so only certain nodes have access to the network, making it difficult for outsiders to obtain access or alter data stored within them.\n\nCross-Chain Versus Multi-Chain Cost-Efficiency\n\nCross-chain transactions typically require more computing power and energy than single-chain transactions, rendering them less cost-effective over time. Multi-chain networks are also costly to maintain due to the fact that each network requires its own hardware resources. Cross-chain solutions can provide enhanced scalability and interoperability, making them a beneficial investment for some organizations.\n\nCross-Chain vs. Multiple-Chain Performance & Speed\n\nAs data can be swiftly transferred between numerous ledgers, cross-chain networks typically offer quicker transaction times. Multi-chain networks, on the other hand, may be slower due to their permissioned nature and the requirement that all participating nodes attain consensus. Cross-chain and multi-chain each have their own distinct advantages and disadvantages, depending on the application. Cross-chain solutions should be considered by organizations seeking improved scalability, cost-effectiveness, and performance, whereas multi-chain networks may be advantageous to those seeking enhanced security. Before choosing the most appropriate technology for your project\u2019s requirements, it is essential to evaluate its scope.\n\nInteroperability in a Cross-Chain Environment as Opposed to a Multi-Chain Environment\n\nCross-chain technology provides increased interoperability between blockchains, enabling the transfer of data and assets between networks. This means that users can access a variety of services from various chains without relying on a singular blockchain or set of protocols. As they are governed by a specific set of rules and protocols, multi-chain networks are typically less flexible.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, cross-chain and multi-chain are two important concepts in the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. While these terms are often used interchangeably, they actually refer to different concepts. Cross-chain technology enables the transfer of assets between different blockchain networks, while multi-chain technology enables the use of multiple blockchains within a single ecosystem.\n\nBoth cross-chain and multi-chain technology are helping to shape the future of blockchain technology, enabling new use cases and applications that were previously impossible. As the world of cryptocurrency continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how these technologies continue to develop and evolve."

        "content": "Stablecoins, including sDAI and GHO, propelled Aave V3\u2019s $100 million loan record.\n\nAssets staked on the protocol reduced in the last 24 hours.\n\nA whopping $100 million\u2014 that was the value of loans issued on Aave [AAVE] on Monday 28 August. The landmark, a record high, was reported by Lucas Outumoro, IntoTheBlock\u2019s Head of Research.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s AAVE\u2019s market cap in ETH terms\n\nAs a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol, Aave allows users to participate as suppliers, lenders, or borrowers. Suppliers on Aave v3 can provide liquidity to the market, and earn interest on the assets provided.\n\nBorrowers, on the other hand, are able to borrow assets like Ethereum [ETH] using overcollateralized means. The recent surge in activity has sparked considerable interest and speculation about the factors behind this sudden growth.\n\nsDAI and GHO change the game for Aave\n\nAccording to Outumoro, the remarkable turn of events could be linked to the introduction of sDAI and ETH borrow costs. In turn, it increased demand for the loans.\n\nThe daily amount of loans issued in Aave v3 on Ethereum hit a record high of $100M+ on Monday The introduction of sDAI as collateral and improvement of $ETH borrow costs appear to be driving the increase in demand pic.twitter.com/F8Eh6b3YXe \u2014 Lucas (@LucasOutumuro) August 31, 2023\n\nFor context, sDAI allows DAI depositors to earn interest on any protocol while maintaining liquidity. The sDAI idea is similar to the way users earn with Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs).\n\nFurthermore, Aave\u2019s V3 lending platform\u2019s ability to smash the record for previous loans on the Ethereum network has now placed it in the top spot as the go-to market for ETH borrowed.\n\nAccording to data from TheBlock, Aave beat other protocols including Compound [COMP], Iron Bank, and dForce to take the top spot. Besides, being the number one lending platform was not just limited to DAI.\n\nBut Aave also topped other projects when it comes to involving other stablecoins like Circle [USDC] and Tether [USDT]. As a result of the increase, Aave also became the largest holder of sDAI. As of this writing, it boasts owning 5.38% of the entire supply.\n\nJust a day before, the protocol was second in this regard. However, the activation of its decentralized stablecoin GHO ensured that it reached the milestone in little time.\n\n22 hours later.. @AaveAave is the largest holder of $sdai with 5.38% (40.5m) of the supply, while spark is second with 4.63% (35m) ? Well done for the quick integration! @lemiscate & team. https://t.co/tWRwXWXkiH https://t.co/EgqcuNyAX5 \u2014 StablesCap (@StablesCap) August 31, 2023\n\nNot the required catalyst for a TVL boost\n\nHowever, Aave\u2019s remarkable performance in lending failed to positively impact its Total Value Locked (TVL). At press time, Aave\u2019s TVL was $4.52 billion\u2014a 2.81% decrease in the last 24 hours.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 AAVEs worth today?\n\nThe TVL is a metric used to measure the total value of assets locked or staked in a protocol. If the TVL increases, then it means the protocol in question has become more trustworthy.\n\nHowever, a decrease in the TVL implies restriction in uniquely depositing assets into the protocol. Therefore, Aave\u2019s decrease in the TVL means market participants resisted increasing the liquidity of the Aave protocol."

        "title": "The Merge of Ethereum - krungsri.com",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nEthereum is a blockchain-based technology that manages and stores data in a manner similar to the better-known Bitcoin, but which has its own native coin1/ called Ether, or ETH, a type of cryptocurrency that may be used to pay for services and transaction fees. Ethereum also differs from Bitcoin by providing users with additional programming capabilities that may be coded to execute automatically once certain conditions are met. The possibilities offered by these \u2018smart contracts\u2019 are one factor underpinning interest in Ethereum and driving efforts to extend its capabilities and improve the efficiency of its operations. Most recently, this has led to \u2018the Merge\u2019, an event that has marked a major change in how the Ethereum blockchain operates.\n\n\n\nBlockchain Trilemma\n\nWithin the realm of digital assets, blockchain technology should be developed to optimize all 3 of these characteristics simultaneously within a blockchain network, which include:\n\nDecentralization: The ability to operate in the absence of middlemen and other types of intermediations, i.e., eliminating the need for a central authority. Security: The ability of the system to deter threats and maintain cybersecurity. A secure blockchain ensures the integrity of transactions and the confidentiality of sensitive information. Scalability: The ability of a blockchain network to handle a growing number of transactions and users without compromising its performance.\n\nHowever, investors and blockchain gurus alike agree that at least up to the present day, it has been impossible to fully satisfy all three requirements simultaneously, the challenge that has been named the \u2018blockchain trilemma\u2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the current shape of the digital asset landscape, most blockchain networks meet at most only two of these three requirements. Improving one aspect often comes at the cost of another. Although Ethereum was both secure and decentralized3/ , it had previously failed to meet the requirement for scalability. However, this weakness has been addressed by the Merge of Ethereum, which has formed part of the move to upgrade the network\u2019s capabilities and to ensure that the blockchain trilemma is resolved by achieving the perfect balance between scalability, security, and decentralization.\n\n\n\nWhat is The Merge of Ethereum\n\nPrior to the Merge, to verify transactions and to record data, account balances, and smart contracts coded and operating on it, the Ethereum Mainnet (i.e., the live Ethereum blockchain deployed for daily use) was based on a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm. However, the use of a PoW mechanism carries with it significant problems with regard to scalability, and so to overcome these difficulties, a decision was made to switch to a Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm instead. The transition from a PoW to a PoS consensus algorithm occurred in two major phases: (i) the creation of a separate yet parallel network alongside the Mainnet called \u2018the Beacon Chain\u2019 that uses the PoS mechanism; and (ii) the process of merging the Beacon Chain with the existing Mainnet, also known as 'The Merge'.\n\nThe Beacon Chain was developed as a separate layer of the Ethereum blockchain. In the initial phase of the switch to the PoS consensus algorithm, the Beacon Chain operated in parallel with the Mainnet, allowing developers to test the system and to deal with problems as and when they arose, without this impacting the functionality of the existing Ethereum network itself. Once it was clear that the Beacon Chain was operating as designed and that use of the PoS mechanism would not generate problems for users on the Ethereum blockchain, it was then possible to integrate the two layers.\n\nThe Ethereum Mainnet and the Beacon Chain have been successfully integrated\u2014this is The Merge of Ethereum\u2014and so the Ethereum blockchain now fully operates on a PoS rather than a PoW consensus mechanism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the success of the Merge, the Ethereum network is now looking at implementing a new method of storing data called sharding, which may be used on blockchains. Under this system, the network is split into separate smaller self-managing units called shards, which in the Ethereum network can be connected using the Beacon Chain, with the goal that 64 shard chains will operate simultaneously. The result of this will be to allow the Ethereum network as a whole to process up to 100,000 transactions per second (TPS), significantly cutting processing time and costs and dramatically extending the network\u2019s scalability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVitalik Buterin, the Russian programmer behind ETH and the Ethereum blockchain, spoke about how Ethereum might solve the blockchain trilemma at Ethereum 2022 (EthCC), an annual conference devoted to its namesake technology that in 2022 was held in Paris between 19 and 22 July . At the conference, Buterin outlined the details of how upgrades to the Ethereum network would enable it to meet all three of the main requirements for a comprehensive blockchain solution. At that point, the Merge was more than 90% complete, with just some work on Testnet remaining to be completed5/. It was later announced that as of 20:42 Thailand time on 15 September 2022, the Merge of Ethereum had been successfully completed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBringing The Merge to completion\n\nIn the recent past, one criticism leveled at cryptocurrencies has been their voracious energy consumption, a situation that many believed was only likely to worsen in the future. In particular, the demands placed on power supplies by the cryptocurrency industry escalated sharply over 2018-2022, and estimates place the industry\u2019s total global power consumption at 120-240 TWh annually. This is a significant amount of electricity, and in addition to being in excess of the total national demand of major economies such as Argentina and Australia, cryptocurrencies are estimated to account for 0.4-0.9% of global energy demand.10/ Alongside other blockchains, Ethereum was guilty of profligate energy consumption, and prior to the Merge, the Ethereum blockchain is estimated to have used 46.31-93.98 TWh of electricity annually,11/ an astounding amount that resulted in a carbon footprint12/ of 11,016,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e).13/\n\nProblems with some blockchains\u2019 excessive energy consumption originate in the use of the PoW consensus algorithm. This contributes somewhere close to 100 TWh annually to global energy demand, a figure that is itself comparable to the entire annual electricity consumption of Colombia or the Czech Republic, and so this was a major driver of the desire to transition the Ethereum network to the PoS mechanism. The total electricity demands generated by using PoS systems to verify transactions come to just 0.0026 TWh per year, or something like 0.01% of the PoW total (i.e., this represents a 99.99% energy saving). In terms of estimated overall consumption, the Merge should thus result in the Ethereum blockchain going from using as much electricity as a mid-sized economy to using as much as a small US town containing around 2,100 households.14/ The collapse in energy usage associated with the PoS systems stems from the fact that rather than being selected through a race to the first correct answer, the system employs a semi-random selection process to find Validator,15/ who adheres to the blockchain regulations to verify transactions. As a result, there is only one validator per block.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs described above, the Merge was undertaken with the aim of increasing Ethereum\u2019s scalability and of reducing the congestion on the network that was being generated using the PoW mechanism. The upgrade has also had the twin results of helping to bring Ethereum closer to meeting the three desired characteristics of the ideal blockchain, and of increasing the network\u2019s security. The latter is due to the transition to the PoS algorithm and the requirement that transaction validators stake 32 ETH16/ of collateral in exchange for the right to be considered as a validator. Participants are therefore incentivized to be much more careful about validating transactions correctly and accurately since otherwise, they run the risk of forfeiting their stake. At the same time, it is now easier to compete for a position as a validator since these are chosen randomly, rather than by solving hugely complex mathematical problems; in the latter situation, race conditions mean that PoW validators, or miners, are forced to make considerable upfront investment in high-end and quickly outdated machinery as they try to gain an edge over the competition, and this then functions as a significant barrier to entry. The net effect of these changes should therefore be to make it easier to become a validator, and with a deeper pool of validators available, the process will become more decentralized. Despite these positives, the Merge carried with it fears of possible risks to the Ethereum blockchain. (i) The transition from the PoW to PoS mechanism was a major change to the way in which the network operates and although this was thoroughly tested in advance, there was still a risk that the upgrade would result in an interruption to Ethereum services or the departure of some users. (ii) These changes should have the effect of increasing overall security but carrying out such a major overhaul of the network\u2019s technological plumbing opened up the possibility that security holes might be created, which could then be exploited by threat actors. (iii) Some worried that swapping over the consensus algorithm might impact the price of ETH, and given the volatility of cryptocurrency prices, it also was possible that this could affect prices for other coins built on the Ethereum blockchain. However, in the roughly 10 months between the completion of The Merge of Ethereum in mid-September 2022 and the present, these fears have not come to pass. Thus, there have been no interruptions to the operation of the Ethereum network and no security flaws have come to light that have resulted from the Merge. Rather, security has been improved. Moreover, those who hold ETH can participate as validators in the blockchain. As regards prices for ETH, these have fluctuated over the intervening period, but this has been as a result of market mechanisms, not as a consequence of the upgrade, and these have not had a noticeable impact on the prices of other cryptocurrencies. The next stage of Ethereum\u2019s development As described by Vitalik Buterin, The Merge of Ethereum was just one stage in the ongoing development of the Ethereum blockchain, and to continue extending the capabilities of the network, a series of further upgrades have now been scheduled. The Surge: This will increase the processing capabilities of the Ethereum blockchain. In general, the blockchain is limited to recording only around 15-20 transactions per second (TPS), but the upgrades that will be implemented during the Surge should vastly expand this, taking the cap to 100,000 TPS. The Surge is planned for the second half of 2023. The Scourge: This upgrade aims to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of the network, partly by ensuring that platform users are protected against unwanted kinds of MEV17/ extraction. The Verge: This upgrade will increase the network\u2019s efficiency by optimizing storage on Ethereum through replacing \u2018Merkle trees\u2019 with the use of \u2018Verkle trees\u201918/ in the verification process. By reducing the quantity of data that each node needs to store and process, overheads should be cut by as much as 85%. The Purge: The removal of unnecessary data marks a pivotal phase for Ethereum, accomplished through the implementation of EIP-4444: Bound Historical Data in Execution Clients. This proposal seeks to assist in purging redundant blockchain data, resulting in reduced computational workload and shorter data transfer times. The Splurge: The final upgrade of the currently envisaged round of Ethereum will implement two EIPs: (i) to reduce the volume of ETH in circulation, EIP-1559 specifies mechanisms for burning ETH when this is generated from transaction fees; and (ii) EIP-4337: Account Abstraction will increase the network\u2019s flexibility and efficiency by using Verified Delay Functions (VDFs), which will then accelerate the verification of large transactions when these are processed on the network faster.\n\nMarket reactions to The Merge of Ethereum\n\nThe Merge was one of the most significant events to occur in the crypto space in 2022, following its successful completion, prices for ETH failed to rise, despite predictions from many investors that this would be the case. Rather, prices immediately dipped and then stabilized. This short-term decline was partly driven by rumors and misunderstandings surrounding the upgrade, with many believing that the Merge would result in the formation of a new blockchain, \u2018Ethereum 2.0\u2019, and a newly minted coin to go along with this, \u2018ETH2\u2019, though as has been shown above, neither of these claims were true. In addition, the Merge coincided with the latest \u2018crypto winter\u2019 and significant turbulence in the crypto world. Among the most important causes of the latter was the collapse of the FTX19/ cryptocurrency trading platform, which prior to its being declared bankrupt was after Binance the world\u2019s second largest crypto exchange. The value of ETH was thus impacted by the FTX scandal, losing over 30% of its value overnight; on 8 November 2022, ETH traded at USD 1,574.80 but only a day later, its value had slumped to USD 1,083.29.20/ The market for ETH then remained choppy through 2022, closing out the year at around USD 1,300.\n\nIn addition to troubles originating from these market-driven price swings, the regulatory authorities have also begun to take a closer interest in ETH and its exact legal status. Gary Gensler, Chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stated that following the merge and the 2022 transition from the PoW to the PoS consensus mechanism and the introduction of staking, it was possible that ETH could henceforth best be regarded as a security, and in that case, it would come under the purview of the US SEC. In assessing the case for this, the SEC applied the \u2018Howey Test\u2019. For ETH, this required considering whether holders of the coin expected to earn profits from a common enterprise, or in other words, the test assessed whether holding ETH was a type of profit-seeking investment. The result of the SEC\u2019s assessment was that holders of ETH did indeed buy ETH exactly because they expected to earn a profit from doing so, and as such, ETH could be regarded as a type of security.21/ However, at around the same time, on 13 December, 2022,22/ the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (US CFTC) issued its indictment of Sam Bankman-Fried, the ex-CEO of FTX, and in this, the CFTC clearly regarded ETH as a commodity, much like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This conflict over the status of ETH and whether it should be classified as a security or a commodity then generated considerable uncertainty in the investor community since if it is the former, ETH will be regulated by the SEC, whereas if it is the latter, it will be regulated by the CFTC. Following the disagreement between the regulatory authorities, the waters were perhaps muddied further by comments made in May 2023 by Dan Berkovitz, ex-general counsel for the Securities and Exchange Commission, on the Unchained podcast, where Berkovitz stated that it is possible that from a legal perspective, ETH could fall within the scope of both the SEC and the CFTC.23/\n\n\n\nFollowing this period of volatility, demand for ETH benefited from a number of factors, including the decision by Google to offer blockchain node hosting,24/ for which Ethereum was the first blockchain to be chosen. Vitalik Buterin also announced that following the Merge, the next upgrade to be made to the Ethereum network would be the Scourge,25/ which would help to address problems with validators claiming additional fees for adding transactions to the blockchain. The Shanghai upgrade,26/ which was implemented at the start of April 2023, also allows validators to withdraw ETH that has been staked on the blockchain. These have then helped to improve perceptions of the Ethereum network and as such, prices for ETH have rallied; in the wake of the successful Shanghai upgrade, ETH prices broke through the USD 2,000 barrier for the first time in 8 months.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestors and commentators are agreed that by expanding its transaction handling capabilities, beefing up its security, and slashing its energy overheads, the Merge has had major benefits for the Ethereum network and added to interest in the possibilities on offer.\n\n\n\n\n\nKrungsri Research view: The Merge of Ethereum\n\nWithin the crypto world, the Merge was a major event on the 2022 calendar, and across the space, the success of the upgrade was closely tracked. This intense interest stemmed from the expectation that the Merge would achieve the difficult task of shifting the Ethereum blockchain into the sweet spot at the center of the blockchain trilemma, and by reducing problems with scalability, Ethereum would much better balance this with the other demands of security and decentralization.\n\nFrom the point of view of the banking and finance industry, this upgrade to Ethereum\u2019s capabilities brings with it significant benefits but also implies major impacts, too. With regard to the former, the Ethereum blockchain is already capable of supporting decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts, and combined with the network\u2019s trustworthiness and decentralization, these offer an easy and convenient solution for processing a wide range of financial transactions. Moreover, because the smart contracts that are built on the Ethereum blockchain self-execute when specified conditions are met, this adds to efficiencies and reduces the risk that contracts can or will be amended after having been agreed.\n\nIn addition, the very sharp cuts in electricity consumption that the Merge has enabled will serve to provoke greater interest from investors attracted by the promise of digital assets and who are focused on the development of Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) goals. Within the blockchain universe, the Ethereum network is thus establishing itself as a leader in the field and is the choice for a \u2018green blockchain\u2019 for those interested in this area, and by occupying this position, the network will appeal to investors looking to push forward with the development of the industry and the generation of benefits for stakeholders. More generally, blockchain technologies are finding an ever-growing range of applications across the economy, including in the real estate sector, where their use is allowing for asset tokenization and for simpler document storage and exchange; the arts and entertainments industry, where blockchains can be used to encode artists\u2019 rights, prevent copyright violations and ensure that payments are made directly to originating artists; and the health industry, where blockchains may be used to securely store patient records, easing bottlenecks created when individuals are seen in a number of different hospitals or clinics. Ultimately, blockchain technologies may be used to simplify and streamline work processes, and through this, reduce operating overheads. And with the introduction of PoS mechanisms on the Ethereum blockchain, this is now becoming an environmentally friendly option, too.\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "InQubeta (QUBE) has the potential to enjoy over 1,000% growth by 2024 as its presale raises over $2.4 million in its early stages, making it one of the best cryptos to invest in. The presale has been a massive success despite bearish cryptocurrency markets and the recent price crashes.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s presale structure puts investors who join now in a position to grow their funds by 300% before the event ends. Prices have the potential to grow significantly once $QUBE tokens are launched on exchanges, and some projections have prices growing as much as 1000% by 2024.\n\nEthereum (ETH) wasn\u2019t exempt from the recent price crash, but many cryptocurrency analysts expect prices to quickly rebound. Ethereum\u2019s impressive functionality gives it the potential to one day become the most popular cryptocurrency project as successful crypto projects like InQubeta and Polygon (MATIC) are launched on its blockchain.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE) project established as one of the best cryptos to invest in\n\nThe InQubeta project is one of the most impressive cryptocurrency platforms to be launched in recent years. It doesn\u2019t replicate services other cryptocurrencies already provide but instead takes a cutting-edge approach to opening up investment prospects in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nIt delivers a much-needed solution that the millions of people denied entry to traditional investment channels will appreciate. Many of these firms have discriminatory requirements like investors having to prove earning over $200k for two years straight for access to angel investment opportunities. InQubeta\u2019s solution makes it easier than ever to invest in AI while driving up the flow of capital to firms that advance artificial intelligence.\n\nThe AI industry has emerged as a favorite among mainstream investors with total investments rising by over $110 billion since 2015. Investments in AI are projected to go beyond $1.5 trillion by 2023. InQubeta\u2019s innovative solution puts it in place to help guide a large portion of these funds to AI firms.\n\nHow the QUBE process works\n\nInQubeta uses ERC20 coins to create a more secure, transparent, and accessible way to invest in AI on its blockchain. Companies first have to be evaluated by the operations team to earn eligibility to fundraise on the platform.\n\nOnce approved, these AI startups raise funds by creating and selling equity-based ERC20 coins that are the InQubeta version of stocks. These tokens denote part ownership of the companies behind them and provide other bonuses like discounts or profit sharing.\n\n$QUBE are used for all transactions on the InQubeta ecosystem and investors get control over their tokens once trades are completed. Investors can track the value of their portfolios in their QUBE account and they can sell whenever they choose.\n\nInvestors who join the InQubeta presale don\u2019t have to invest in AI startups to earn substantial profits. They can also invest directly in the project by holding on to their tokens or staking to help run the network. A 1.5 billion cap of $QUBE and burn taxes help to foster their long-term price growth.\n\nEthereum (ETH) poised to regain recent losses\n\nEthereum runs an open-source decentralized network that serves as a platform for many other cryptocurrency projects and decentralized smart contracts. The platform aims to serve as a global network that allows users to create and execute software that\u2019s resistant to fraud, downtime, and censorship.\n\nMany crypto analysts expect Ethereum to someday replace Bitcoin as the most popular cryptocurrency thanks to its more capable blockchain that now runs a proof-of-stake protocol.\n\nSummary\n\nTop altcoin InQubeta is one of the best cryptos to invest in as its presale emerges as one of the most profitable opportunities. Prices are expected to rise exponentially once these undervalued tokens hit exchanges and markets establish their real price. Some expect prices to grow up to 1000% by 2024.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

The class action lawsuit sought to hold Uniswap, Paradigm, et al responsible for users\u2019 losses and damage caused by illicit third-party actors.\n\nThe lawsuit\u2019s argument was built around losses that users incurred from investing in scam tokens and crypto Ponzi schemes traded on Uniswap.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal both refitted the SEC\u2019s claims, signaling the start of a lengthy litigation process.\n\nGrayscale emerged victorious over the SEC 14 months after going to court with the commission. The SEC remained adamant in rejecting Grayscale\u2019s conversion of its GBTC fund to a spot Bitcoin ETF, citing market manipulation concerns.\n\nA trio of judges completely sided with Grayscale and ruled against the SEC\u2019s rejection of Grayscale\u2019s ETF application.\n\n\u201cThe denial of Grayscale\u2019s proposal was arbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar product,\u201d said United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. The ruling pointed to the SEC\u2019s approval of Bitcoin Futures ETF, a similar product to the high-sought-after spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\n\u201cThe courts remain our last, best hope\u201d said Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal after the news."

Do not invest unless you are prepared to lose your entire investment. For a full disclaimer, please click here.\n\nDuring a persistent bear market, both Ethereum (ETH) and Cosmos (ATOM) have experienced declines over the past month. Ethereum (ETH) faced competition from Cardano (ADA) in NFT floor prices, challenging its leadership. Meanwhile, Cosmos (ATOM) has seen a downturn since introducing penalties for Neutron halt validators. In contrast, VC Spectra (SPCT) continues to shine with substantial investor gains.\n\nBut the question remains: How does VC Spectra (SPCT) outperform competitors during these challenging market conditions?\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCardano Surpasses Ethereum (ETH) in NFT Floor Price Battle\n\nAs the bear market continues to undermine the prices of many tokens, Ethereum (ETH) has dropped by 7.70% from $1,790 on August 17 to $1,652 on August 28. The price drop raises concerns for Ethereum (ETH) as a market leader amid competition from platforms like Cardano (ADA).\n\nCardano\u2019s NFT floor price index soared 22% higher than that of Ethereum (ETH) on Stocktwits NFT in the past seven days. This shift indicates Cardano\u2019s (ADA) potential as a rising NFT trading platform, challenging the historical dominance of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) price drop can also be attributed to suspicions of futures market liquidation. The price of Ethereum (ETH) recently plunged after weeks of consolidation, often tied to futures market liquidations. The Ethereum (ETH) price dip coincided with a notable reduction in Open Interest, suggesting a significant liquidation wave.\n\nCosmos (ATOM) Faces Slide After Neutron Validator Penalties\n\nExperiencing a 10.24% decline, Cosmos (ATOM) has seen its price drop from $8.10 on August 17, 2023, to $7.27 on August 28. While this dip aligns with the broader bearish trend in the crypto market, it also reflects a continuation of Cosmos\u2019 (ATOM) extended downward movement.\n\nThe price of Cosmos (ATOM) has dropped by 18.68% since August 1 from $8.94 to $7.27. Neutron, a blockchain designed for smart contracts in the Cosmos (ATOM) ecosystem, faced an unexpected halt on August 1.\n\nThe Cosmos (ATOM) leadership is currently deliberating on the next steps, pushing their initial proposal to slash Replicated Security validators. However, this development has not positively impacted Cosmos (ATOM), as the effects are expected to continue in the coming weeks.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT): Profit Haven Amidst Market Challenges\n\nAs Ethereum (ETH) and Cosmos (ATOM) experience declines, VC Spectra (SPCT) emerges as an investor favorite, delivering profits.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT), known for its innovation, offers investment management services using AI and expert analysis, seeking investment opportunities with high profit potential and minimum risk.\n\nThe heart of its innovation is the VC Spectra (SPCT) token, a BRC-20 standard token on the Bitcoin blockchain. Employing a deflationary model, VC Spectra (SPCT) provides dividends, buybacks, and access to exclusive pre-ICOs.\n\nAfter a successful private seed sale raising $2.4 million, VC Spectra (SPCT) enters Stage 3 of its public presale, surging 212.5% from its Stage 1 price of $0.008 to the current $0.025.\n\nNew Stage 3 VC Spectra (SPCT) investors anticipate a 32% profit in Stage 4, with the price reaching $0.033. In addition, the price of VC Spectra (SPCT) is projected to reach $0.08 by the public presale\u2019s end, promising a 220% profit for token buyers.\n\nLearn more about the VC Spectra presale here:\n\nPresale: https://invest.vcspectra.io/login\n\nWebsite: https://vcspectra.io\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/VCSpectra\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/spectravcfund"

It also supports layer-2 Arbitrum, Optimism and Polygon.\n\nIn addition to exchanging cryptocurrencies on Ethereum and Polygon, it also allows connecting to a wide range of dApps (decentralized applications), with a simple and intuitive design designed for mass use.\n\nThe goal is precisely to onboard the next new generation of Web3 users, giving them full control over their cryptocurrencies.\n\nRobinhood other crypto wallet features: beyond Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Ethereum\n\nAnother feature that has already been added is a Web3 browser that allows users to connect to dApps directly from the wallet.\n\nThey also recently allowed US users to purchase cryptocurrencies directly on the wallet by paying in fiat currency through Robinhood Connect.\n\nIn addition, they have expanded the incentive program to include learning rewards that allow users to earn USDC by completing short lessons.\n\nFor the future, they promise to add support for other layer-2s as well, while for now they do not yet promise the addition of other blockchains. In particular, the addition of Lightning Network, which is the main layer-2 of Bitcoin, is expected.\n\nIn addition to launching new features, they are keeping the focus on security and privacy high by offering a number of tools to help customers protect their wallets.\n\nCommentary\n\nRobinhood Crypto GM Johann Kerbrat said:\n\n\u201cWith Robinhood Wallet we stripped away many of the complexities of DeFi and the broader Web3 ecosystem, and reduced some of the challenges and barriers to entry for everyday people."

        "title": "3 Best Ethereum Staking Platforms Offering High APY for 2023 - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "Staking over the Ethereum blockchain is emerging as a good idea. Easier node running, no need for significant investments in energy or hardware, and joining of the staking pool at any value make the ETH staking more efficient. The concept came into action on 1 December 2020, offering more staking and more earning.\n\nWant to stake over the Ethereum blockchain? Here are some top ETH staking platforms to discover in 2023.\n\nBybit\n\nThe very first name that came to mind is Bybit, which offers staking facilities in more than 150 nations. The cryptocurrency exchange was introduced in March 2018 to help crypto traders get ultra-latching engines, multilingual community support, and excellent customer service. The platform supports a wide range of digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Tether (USDT), Solana (SOL), etc. Bybit has approximately 100 tokens listed and around 300 spot trading pairs. Contributing Ethereum to the Bybit platform helps in earning a 6% Annual Percentage Yield (APY) in rewards.\n\nThe exchange automatically swaps the staked ETH for stETH at a 1:1 ratio and initiates daily earning rewards on the particular amount. Minimum entry threshold, depth access to the trading volumes, and opening long and short-term positions are some major benefits of Bybit.\n\nLido\n\nLido is another powerful platform to explore in 2023 for ETH staking. The project was launched in December 2020 when Ethereum 2.0 was launched. Simple, decentralized, and efficient staking make the platform stand out from other available options. Significant liquidity is one of the key benefits of the platform enabling around $1.5 Billion offered on Curve. The facility helps crypto traders easily transfer the staked ETH to other assets.\n\nStaking with Lido offers 4.8 APY, making the platform more advantageous, beneficial, and flexible to use. Lido also helps individuals participate in different DeFi applications while waiting for the Ethereum platform to upgrade. In addition, the platform does not require any technical expertise for staking, making it a user-friendly platform to operate with.\n\nBinance\n\nBinance, a US crypto trading platform is another significant name in the list of top Ethereum Blockchain exchanges. The platform is mainly beneficial for US residents, offering them facilities to buy, sell, and trade a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Binance is considered one of the safest exchange platforms compared to other powerful names in the market.\n\nBinance was introduced to the crypto market in July 2017 and within 6 months of time, the platform grew as one of the largest digital asset exchanges in the trading world. Low transaction fees, a wide range of use cases, and high transaction speed helped Binance secure a strong position in the crypto market. Focusing on APY, individuals can earn up to 4.49% APY by staking ETH over the platform.\n\nConclusion\n\nEarning rewards, more crypto, and interest rates made Ethereum stalking a popular practice in the crypto world. Lido, Binance, and Bybit are some popular and beneficial exchanges for staking ETH and earning rewards."

From its inception to an all-time high of $68,789 in November 2021, to trading below $30,000 today; we all have witnessed its turbulent journey.\n\nEven analysts are not predicting a strong BTC comeback in 2024, leaving crypto fans doubting whether they will be able to make a profit. After analyzing BTC\u2019s recent performance, prudent investors would be wise to look for alternative avenues with stable revenues and growth.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Forecasts: Is The Party Over?\n\nEthereum is facing a pivotal phase, prompting speculations about its worth as it joins other coins in the red market. After rising to a high of $2,127 on April 16, ETH is now hovering just above $1643.

After reaching its all high of $0.73 in May 2021, investors wonder what would it take to see this again.\n\nThe fact that it is a speculative and risky asset, analysts don\u2019t predict an astronomical shift in its prices. Is this euphoric party drawing to a close? DOGE\u2019s price seems to be highly dependent on external factors like support from Elon Musk or market resurgence.\n\nBoth are seemingly unlikely phenomena, and there is no guarantee that the DOGE price will rise.\n\nConclusion\n\nUnless there is a wider recovery, the market will remain volatile and challenging in 2024.\n\nAt this point, projects like ScapesMania with 500x potential are your opportunity for sustainable gain.

        "content": "Robinhood Markets, the commission-free brokerage, has broadened the capabilities of its crypto wallet by adding support for Bitcoin (BTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Ethereum swaps. This move extends Robinhood\u2019s reach beyond the Ethereum ecosystem, responding to user demand for more diverse asset coverage across various blockchain networks.\n\nRobinhood\u2019s user-centric expansion\n\nInitially launched for Apple devices in March, Robinhood\u2019s wallet was confined to supporting the Polygon and Ethereum networks, along with a select range of tokens like COMP, MATIC, SHIB, SOL, UNI, and USDC. The wallet\u2019s expansion was driven by user demand for broader asset coverage across different blockchain networks.\n\nThe wallet now allows select users to trade Ethereum for more than 200 different assets. Unlike other wallets, Robinhood\u2019s platform enables users to swap without holding Ethereum, as network fees are automatically deducted from their existing tokens. Android users can expect this functionality to be available later this year.\n\nFinancial and regulatory implications\n\nThe expansion comes on the heels of Robinhood\u2019s recent earnings report, which revealed a drop in crypto-related revenue from $38 million to $31 million in the previous quarter. By adding support for popular tokens like Bitcoin and Dogecoin, Robinhood aims to boost its crypto business and enhance user engagement.\n\nEarlier in June, the platform delisted three crypto tokens\u2014Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC)\u2014following intensified U.S. regulatory actions against major cryptocurrency exchanges. Robinhood currently offers 18 different tokens, a relatively limited selection compared to crypto-native platforms like Coinbase.\n\nHowever, the zero-fee app intends to expand its crypto offerings in response to consistent customer requests for a more extensive set of coins and tokens.\n\nIn summary, Robinhood\u2019s decision to expand its crypto wallet to include Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Ethereum swaps is a strategic move influenced by user demand, financial performance, and regulatory considerations. The expansion not only aims to boost Robinhood\u2019s crypto revenue but also positions the platform as a more versatile player in the competitive crypto market."

        "title": "Offchain Labs launches Arbitrum Stylus to expand smart contract development on Ethereum's Layer 2 network - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Offchain Labs has launched Arbitrum Stylus, a novel tool designed to expand the programming languages available for smart contract development on Ethereum\u2018s Layer 2 network. This initiative aims to democratize access to Ethereum-compatible smart contract development by supporting languages that can be converted to WebAssembly (WASM), such as Rust, C, and C++.\n\nBefore the advent of Arbitrum Stylus, the primary language for Ethereum smart contracts was Solidity. The tool\u2019s introduction marks a significant shift, allowing developers to write smart contracts in languages they are already familiar with. According to Offchain Labs, this could potentially bring over 3 million Rust and C developers into the Ethereum smart contract ecosystem, which has largely been dominated by approximately 20,000 Solidity developers.\n\nSteven Goldfeder, CEO and co-founder of Offchain Labs, emphasized the importance of building an inclusive developer community. \u201cGrowing and building the most inclusive developer community is incredibly important to us,\u201d Goldfeder stated. He further noted that the wider language support and improved efficiency of Stylus could benefit projects in areas like social media or gaming that require high computational power.\n\nRachel Bousfield, tech lead at Offchain Labs, elaborated on the utility of Arbitrum Stylus. She indicated that the tool would significantly reduce friction for companies looking to bring their applications to the blockchain. For instance, a video game company that has already invested in C++ talent would find it easier to transition to blockchain technology.\n\nInteroperability and cost efficiency\n\nOne of the most compelling features of Arbitrum Stylus is its interoperability. Different coding languages can work in tandem, allowing for a seamless development experience. For example, a developer programming in Rust can import a Solidity interface and vice versa. This feature is enabled through Arbitrum Nitro, a significant tech stack upgrade to Arbitrum One that occurred in 2022.\n\nMoreover, Stylus promises to cut costs dramatically. According to Bousfield, Stylus could reduce computational costs by 10 to 100 times, depending on the task. This is achieved through the use of two virtual machines: one unmodified Ethereum Virtual Machine for Solidity contracts and a separate WASM virtual machine for other languages.\n\nCommunity feedback and future developments\n\nOffchain Labs has made the code and testnet for Arbitrum Stylus publicly available and is actively seeking community feedback. The team is also considering adding more programming languages to Stylus to further reduce fees. A date for a vote on whether the Arbitrum DAO will adopt Stylus has not been set, but indications suggest that the plan is to gather testnet feedback before submitting a proposal.\n\nIn summary, the introduction of Arbitrum Stylus by Offchain Labs marks a pivotal moment in the Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystem. By broadening language support and offering cost-efficient solutions, Stylus has the potential to attract a diverse range of developers and projects, thereby enriching the blockchain landscape. With the tool\u2019s testnet already launched and community feedback being actively sought, the next steps for Arbitrum Stylus could set new standards in smart contract development."

        "content": "PancakeSwap, a popular decentralized exchange, has recently launched on Base, a growing platform in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This development has sparked interest in the price projections for top crypto coins such as Ethereum (ETH), VC Spectra (SPCT), and BNB (BNB).\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) vibrant developer community and upcoming Ethereum 2.0 release hold promising prospects, BNB (BNB) has been influenced by Ripple\u2019s legal victory and Grayscale\u2019s ETF case. Meanwhile, VC Spectra (SPCT) has experienced a remarkable surge in its token value during its ongoing presale, offering potential returns and unique benefits to investors.\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum\u2019s (ETH) Thriving Ecosystem Boosts Prospects In Stablecoin Competition\n\nOn August 25, 2023, a Bloomberg crypto analyst evaluated Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) stance regarding the so-called \u201cstablecoin wars.\u201d\n\nThe examination revealed that Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) worth extends past just its native ETH token. Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) vibrant developer community fosters innovation through layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism. These have noticeably increased the adoption of the network and ETH price prediction.\n\nAt first, the news did not provide any encouraging ETH price prediction due to the high volatility in the market. From August 25 to September 1, Ethereum (ETH) has been in steady decline. The price of Ethereum (ETH) went from $1,660 to $1,640, a 1.2% decrease.\n\nHowever, with the Ethereum 2.0 release in the fourth quarter of 2023, many crypto analysts anticipate bullish forecasts for ETH price prediction as the market rebounds.\n\nRipple\u2019s Legal Victory And Grayscale ETF Case Impact BNB\u2019s (BNB) Price\n\nRipple found success in its ongoing legal battle with the SEC on July 23, 2023. This win for Ripple greatly impacted digital asset prices, especially XRP and BNB.\n\nFollowing the court victory, XRP\u2019s market cap surpassed BNB\u2019s for the first time within 24 hours, as some holders cashed out of BNB, hoping to profit from XRP\u2019s price increase.\n\nAs a result, the BNB coin price plunged from $260 to $240, a 7.69% decrease. The slump continued as BNB dipped an additional 9.58% to reach $217 by August 28. Broader market volatility exacerbated BNB\u2019s downtrend during this period.\n\nIn a stunning reversal, top altcoins such as BNB and XRP rebounded on August 29 after Grayscale won its ETF case. The BNB coin price went 6.46% higher within a day, climbing from $217 to $231.\n\nHowever, the initial positive momentum was short-lived, as the BNB coin price retraced back to $213 due to market volatility. Many experts anticipate that BNB\u2019s value will continue to decline if the overall market remains bearish, which is reflected in their BNB price prediction.\n\nVC Spectra\u2019s (SPCT) Token Skyrockets In Presale\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) continues to defy market odds by experiencing a significant surge in its token value during its ongoing public presale. The VC Spectra (SPCT) token price went from $0.008 to $0.025.\n\nIn Stage 1 of the presale, investors enjoyed an impressive return on investment (ROI) of 212.5%. Stage 2 also saw a substantial return of 127.27%. Now, in Stage 3, investors have the opportunity to purchase VC Spectra (SPCT) tokens at $0.025. By doing so, they have the potential to benefit from a projected surge of 220% by the end of the presale, which would result in a value of $0.08.\n\nMoreover, the decentralized hedge fund rewards token holders with quarterly dividends during the public presale and buybacks from investment profits. VC Spectra (SPCT) token holders also get access to new ICOs in seed/private sale and voting rights.\n\nThe VC Spectra (SPCT) token adheres to the BRC-20 standard and powers the Spectra platform\u2019s exchange, decentralized trading, asset management capabilities, and transaction processing.\n\nBuilt on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain infrastructure, SPCT has a deflationary model owing to a burn mechanism that progressively decreases the number of tokens in circulation over time. It means the VC Spectra (SPCT) token is scarce and will retain its value over time.\n\nLearn more about VC Spectra (SPCT) and its presale:\n\nBuy Presale: https://invest.vcspectra.io/login\n\nWebsite: https://vcspectra.io\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/VCSpectra\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/spectravcfund\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: As ETH Forms A Dreaded 'Death Cross,' Here's What To Expect Next - Inside Bitcoins",
        "content": "Don\u2019t invest unless prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nJoin Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage\n\nEthereum (ETH) has formed a so-called \u2018Death Cross,\u2019 but history suggests it may not necessarily prove deathly for the cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nThis Death Cross occurs when a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term moving average. In this case, it is the 50-day Simple Moving Average (red) and the 200-day SMA (green). The name comes as the crossover often triggers a bearish phase in the market in the long run.\n\nWith the Death Cross executed on the daily chart for the ETH/USD trading pair, a prolonged downside may be imminent and the price may drop below the psychological $1,000 level to the critical support of $882. This level, which is about 46% down from the current price level, has provided crucial support in the history of Ethereum\u2019s price action.\n\nEthereum Price Support from a Historical Perspective\n\nIf we take a look at the extended daily price chart of ETH/USD since 2018, the cryptocurrency has experienced six Death Crosses. Yet it has often moved contrary to expectations.\n\nOut of the previous five death crosses, ETH\u2019s price has experienced significant losses only twice. The above chart\u2019s first and last death cross shows downside price movement. However, after the 2nd Death Cross, prices have remained in consolidation.\n\nFurthermore, the prices have moved in the upside direction after the 3rd and 4th Death Crosses. These contrary movements were due to the formation of the Golden Cross immediately after the Death Cross.\n\nPossible Outcomes\n\nNow, given this scenario, we can assume two outcomes:\n\nEthereum price will continue to fall until $882, its critical support in the long run, and it will experience double-digit losses following this Death Cross.\n\nEthereum price might move in consolidation and reverse back to the upside on the formation of Golden Cross in the next few days.\n\nTo conclude, the formation of the Death Cross is expected to decrease prices a little. However, it should be noted that the Death Cross indicator alone is not a reliable method for analyzing the future price movement of an asset.\n\nOn-chain Metric: IntoTheBlock\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows that at current prices, 57.62% of token holders are incurring losses (out of the money), while only 36.43% are making a profit (in the money). Meanwhile, 5.96% of token holders are breaking even (at the money).\n\nWith the lion\u2019s share of token holders suffering losses, Ethereum\u2019s price could fall soon. This will come as the cohort that is \u201cout of the money\u201d looks to sell to avoid suffering more losses. They could either sell at current prices or wait for when they finally break even. The ensuing selling pressure is likely to send ETH market value downward, thereby activating the death cross effect.\n\nA Promising Alternative To Ethereum\n\nGiven the risky outlook for Ethereum, investors may want to consider alternatives such as SONIK Coin. Inspired by Sonic the Hedgehog, it has recently gained significant momentum. In its presale, the project has raised nearly $960,000 in total. Currently available at a presale price of just $0.000014 per token, investors have the opportunity to get in early. Once the project reaches its $2 million target, it will be listed on exchanges, potentially driving its value higher.\n\nOnly 3 days and 20 hours are left for the presale to end. This limited time period is an alarm for interested investors to join the project for future benefits.\n\nThe Sonik Coin team is ambitious, aiming for a market capitalization of $100 million. The market is expecting to see nearly fiftyfold return on initial investments following the end of presale.\n\nFurthermore, Sonik holders can stake their tokens to earn rewards along with the potential price gains.\n\nThe team has allocated about 40% of the total supply for distribution among stakers over the next four years. The current staking rate offers an annual percentage yield (APY) of 88%, which is above industry\u2019s average. This stake-to-earn feature of a newly appeared memecoin is what giving strength to this project.\n\nHere is how to buy SONIK\n\nAlso Read:\n\nNew Crypto Mining Platform - Bitcoin Minetrix Rating Audited By Coinsult\n\nDecentralized, Secure Cloud Mining\n\nEarn Free Bitcoin Daily\n\nNative Token On Presale Now - BTCMTX\n\nStaking Rewards - Over 50% APY Learn More"

        "title": "Ethereum Imposes 22% Self-Limit Rule To Ensure Decentralization - Blockzeit",
        "content": "Ethereum, one of the leading blockchain platforms, has been at the forefront of discussions surrounding decentralization. In recent developments, Ethereum staking services have embraced a groundbreaking self-limit rule, aimed at safeguarding the network\u2019s decentralized nature.\n\nThe 22% Self-Limit Rule Explained\n\nAccording to Cointelegraph, at least five Ethereum liquid staking providers, including Rocket Pool, Stader Labs, Diva Staking, Puffer Finance, and StakeWise have either adopted or are actively working to implement a self-limit rule to keep the decentralized nature of the Ethereum blockchain. This rule restricts their ownership of the Ethereum staking market to no more than 22%.\n\nThe inspiration behind this number lies in the fact that Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism requires 66% of validators to agree on the state of the network. By setting the limit at 22%, the rule ensures that a minimum of four major entities must collude for the chain to reach finalization, which is the point where transactions on the blockchain become immutable.\n\nThe Quest for Decentralization\n\nThis self-limit proposal, introduced by Ethereum core developer Superphiz in May 2022, reflects a deep-rooted concern within the Ethereum community about the potential centralization of staking services. The primary objective is to prevent any single entity from gaining excessive control over the network, thereby preserving its decentralized essence.\n\nThese providers are committed (or are in the process of committing) to self-limit to <22% of Ethereum validators. This is how our chain will be successful: Coordination above greed. Cooperation instead of winner-take-all.@Rocket_Pool @stakewise_io @staderlabs @divastaking \u2014 superphiz.eth ????????????\ufe0f (@superphiz) August 30, 2023\n\nThe Lido Finance Conundrum\n\nOne notable exception to this trend is Lido Finance, the largest Ethereum liquid staking provider. Lido currently dominates the Ethereum staking market, accounting for a substantial 32.4% of all staked Ether, with Coinbase trailing behind at just 8.7% market share based on data sourced from Dune Analytics.\n\nTop Ethereum Stakers (Source: Dune Analytics)\n\nIn a surprising move, Lido Finance, by an overwhelming 99.81% majority, voted against self-limiting in June.\n\nDivergent Opinions within the Ethereum Community\n\nThe Ethereum community\u2019s response to the self-limit rule has been far from unanimous. Some argue that the rule doesn\u2019t align with the principles of Ethereum, focusing instead on economic self-interest. They suggest that those pushing for the self-limit rule might have a different perspective if they were in Lido\u2019s dominant position.\n\nBalancing Decentralization and Growth\n\nOn the other hand, there are those within the Ethereum community who express concerns about the centralization risks posed by Lido\u2019s substantial market share. They view this dominance as \u201cdisgusting and selfish\u201d and advocate for measures to ensure the broader Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s health and decentralization.\n\nThe Future of Ethereum\u2019s Decentralization\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve, the debate surrounding its decentralization will persist. The 22% self-limit rule represents a critical step towards maintaining a balance between market growth and network decentralization.\n\nIt serves as a reminder that the Ethereum community is vigilant in its commitment to keeping the platform decentralized, thereby enabling credible neutrality and permissionless innovation on the network.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Ethereum community\u2019s embrace of the 22% self-limit rule underscores its dedication to decentralization. This innovative approach seeks to prevent any single entity from gaining undue influence over the Ethereum staking market, thereby safeguarding the platform\u2019s core principles.\n\nWhile opinions on this issue may vary, it highlights the Ethereum community\u2019s ongoing commitment to striking the right balance between market dynamics and network integrity."

        "content": "Home \u00bb De-Fi How to Bridge Bitcoin to Ethereum? A Guide to BTC-ETH Conversion Methods De-FiJournal How to Bridge Bitcoin to Ethereum? A Guide to BTC-ETH Conversion Methods Petar Jovanovi\u0107\n\nBridging Bitcoin to Ethereum refers to the process of transferring BTC from the Bitcoin blockchain onto the Ethereum blockchain. This allows Bitcoin holders to access the Ethereum network and participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications built on Ethereum.\n\nThere are two main methods for bridging BTC to Ethereum:\n\nWrapping BTC into an ERC-20 token via services like WBTC, RenBTC or tBTC Performing a native swap of BTC directly to ETH via DEXes like RocketXchange or Thorswap Using centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase to convert BTC to WBTC\n\nWrapping effectively locks up your BTC and mints a new ERC-20 token to represent your BTC on Ethereum. This allows your BTC to interact seamlessly with smart contracts and dApps on Ethereum.\n\nSwapping refers to exchanging your BTC for ETH directly by utilizing liquidity pools and exchange protocols. This converts your BTC to ETH so you can use the ETH natively on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nWrapping BTC into an ERC-20 Token\n\nWrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), renBTC, and tBTC are three popular ERC-20 token protocols for wrapping BTC on Ethereum. Here\u2019s an overview of each:\n\nWrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)\n\nWrapped Bitcoin is an ERC-20 token backed 1:1 with Bitcoin. The process involves BTC being locked up in a custodial manner and WBTC tokens generated to represent that BTC on Ethereum.\n\nAnyone can initiate the minting process by sending BTC to WBTC\u2019s custodian, BitGo. BitGo will then verify the BTC and signal the minting of an equal amount of WBTC, which is sent to the user\u2019s Ethereum address.\n\nThe process is reversed when burning WBTC to unlock the BTC. WBTC is sent to a burning address, triggering BitGo to release the equal amount of BTC from custody.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f WBTC benefits:\n\nAllows BTC to be used in Ethereum DeFi apps for lending, borrowing, liquidity pools etc.\n\nPegged 1:1 to BTC, so maintains equal value\n\nBacked by full bitcoin reserves, providing transparency\n\nIntegration with major DeFi protocols like Compound, MakerDAO, Uniswap etc.\n\nStrong legal protections through custodian agreements\n\n\u274c Drawbacks:\n\nRequires KYC identity verification for minting/burning\n\nCentralized through BitGo custodianship\n\nRisk of mismanagement by custodian\n\nrenBTC\n\nrenBTC is an ERC-20 token that enables a decentralized, permissionless and trustless wrapping solution for BTC on Ethereum. It uses RenVM, a virtual machine, to facilitate the minting and burning of renBTC.\n\nTo mint renBTC, users send BTC to a RenVM Darknode. The Darknode will lock up the BTC and mint an equivalent amount of renBTC tokens to the user\u2019s Ethereum wallet.\n\nThe Darknodes earn fees for providing the minting service but also must stake Ren\u2019s native token, REN, as collateral to act honestly. If malicious activity is detected, the staked REN can be slashed.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f renBTC benefits:\n\nDecentralized, no KYC required\n\nNon-custodial, users maintain control of keys\n\nDarknodes provide security through staked collateral\n\nPermissionless access, anyone can mint/burn\n\nIntegrated with major DeFi apps and DEXs\n\n\u274c Drawbacks:\n\nComplex system reliant on Darknodes\n\nRequires overcollateralization with REN tokens\n\nLow liquidity and market cap relative to WBTC\n\ntBTC\n\ntBTC aims to bring Bitcoin to Ethereum in a decentralized, permissionless and trust-minimized manner. Users initiate minting by sending BTC to the tBTC protocol smart contracts.\n\nA group of participants called signers then facilitate the BTC to tBTC swap. Signers take custody of the BTC and mint tBTC on Ethereum to the user\u2019s address.\n\nTo provide security, signers must stake ETH as collateral. Additionally, \u201ckeepers\u201d monitor the system and can trigger slashing of signer bonds if they act maliciously.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f tBTC benefits:\n\nDecentralized, no KYC needed\n\nNon-custodial, users control private keys\n\nSigners and keepers provide security\n\nOpen access, anyone can integrate tBTC\n\nGrowing adoption on Ethereum DeFi platforms\n\n\u274c Drawbacks:\n\nComplex system with many moving parts\n\nSecurity dependent on collateral stakes\n\nLow market cap and liquidity relative to WBTC\n\nRead also:\n\nNative Swaps of BTC to ETH\n\nRather than wrapping BTC into a token, another option is to directly swap BTC for ETH using atomic swap protocols. This converts your BTC into ETH so you can interact natively with the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nPopular decentralized exchange protocols for trustless BTC to ETH swaps include THORChain and RocketXchange.\n\nTHORChain\n\nTHORChain is a decentralized liquidity network that facilitates native swaps between different blockchain assets using decentralized liquidity pools.\n\nTo swap BTC for ETH on THORChain:\n\nVisit app.thorswap.finance Connect your wallet containing BTC Select BTC as the input asset and ETH as the output asset Review swap details and submit the transaction Complete any wallet confirmation prompts\n\nYour BTC will be exchanged directly for ETH using THORChain\u2019s liquidity pools. The ETH can then be used seamlessly on Ethereum without any wrapping required.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f THORChain benefits:\n\nDirect swap of assets, no wrapping tokens\n\nNon-custodial, you hold private keys\n\nNo intermediaries or kyc\n\nFast, cross-chain trading\n\nGrowing liquidity pools and adoption\n\n\u274c Drawbacks:\n\nLimited coin availability compared to DEX aggregators\n\nComplex protocol reliant on validators\n\nSlashing risks if validators misbehave\n\nRocketXchange\n\nRocketXchange is a DEX aggregator that sources liquidity from both centralized and decentralized exchanges to provide the best swap rates across chains.\n\nTo use RocketXchange to swap BTC to ETH:\n\nVisit rocketx.exchange Connect wallet containing your BTC Select BTC as input asset and ETH as output asset Review estimated swap rates across multiple sources Execute swap through the best rate Confirm any wallet prompts to complete transaction\n\nRocketXchange will automatically direct your swap through the most optimal exchange rate for BTC/ETH. This provides trustless, no KYC swaps between the assets.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f RocketXchange benefits:\n\nSwaps assets directly, no wrapping required\n\nAggregates liquidity across CEXs and DEXs\n\nFinds best rates to optimize swaps\n\nIntuitive interface for easy swapping\n\nNon-custodial, users maintain asset control\n\n\u274c Drawbacks:\n\nReliant on external exchanges\n\nSwap execution can be complex\n\nLiquidity fragmentation across exchanges\n\nLimited coin availability\n\nUsing centralized exchanges\n\nAnother option for bridging Bitcoin to Ethereum is utilizing centralized crypto exchanges (CEXs) as an intermediary. This involves first depositing BTC into a CEX account, trading the BTC for ETH on the exchange order books, and then withdrawing the ETH to an Ethereum wallet address you control.\n\nMajor exchanges like Binance, Coinbase , and Kraken allow seamless trading between BTC and ETH trading pairs. The ETH received can then be used natively on the Ethereum blockchain for transactions and dApps.\n\nAlternatively, some centralized exchanges like Binance support direct withdrawals of BTC as wrapped assets like WBTC on the Ethereum network. For example, you can deposit BTC to Binance, and then withdraw those funds as WBTC directly to your Ethereum wallet. This combines the speed and liquidity of a CEX with the interoperability of wrapped BTC in a single seamless transfer.\n\nThe benefits of bridging BTC to ETH via CEXs include fast settlement speeds, high liquidity, and simple user interfaces. However, centralization risks and lack of custody mean users must trust the exchange to facilitate the bridge properly. Decentralized bridges offer superior transparency and user control, but may have lower liquidity and slower swap execution.\n\nConclusion\n\nBridging Bitcoin to Ethereum can be accomplished through either wrapping BTC into an ERC-20 token or performing a direct atomic swap into ETH. WBTC, renBTC and tBTC are leading wrapping solutions, each with their own merits and tradeoffs. THORChain and RocketXchange allow trustless swapping of BTC into ETH without tokenization.\n\nThe optimal method depends on factors like the application you intend to use ETH for, importance of decentralization, and required transaction speed.

        "title": "VC Spectra (SPCT): Best Presale Performance - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nThe crypto market is currently in an uptrend due to Grayscale\u2019s recent victory in its case against the SEC. The win pumped BTC\u2019s price alongside top altcoins in the market. BNB (BNB) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) have benefited greatly from this win. However, the Ethereum Classic price prediction shows a little twist in its ongoing price surge.\n\nOn the flip side, VC Spectra (SPCT), one of the new DeFi projects, continues to prove its potential in its ongoing presale. VC Spectra (SPCT) recently recorded an impeccable price surge that\u2019s unmatched by both BNB (BNB) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). Let\u2019s find out more!\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nBNB Integrates Backed: Grayscale\u2019s Win Pumps Price\n\nOn August 29, 2023, Backed revealed it will be expanding its native token issuance to the BNB Smart Chain (BSC). The news suggests an increase in BNB\u2019s adoption and utility within the blockchain system.\n\nThe Backed announcement was followed by Grayscale Investments\u2019 victory in its case against the SEC. This caused an upsurge in Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price, which pumped the price of other altcoins, including BNB.\n\nBetween August 29 and August 30, 2023, BNB made a 3% increase from $217.67 to $225.26. Due to its integration with Backed, market analysts suggest that BNB is bound to see some increase in its market capitalization in the coming weeks. As a result, the BNB price prediction shows that the token can reach $237.68 by September 2, 2023.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) Surges Due to Grayscale\u2019s Victory\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) has been trading in red over the past weeks. Since the beginning of August, the unity token has been trying to maintain the $18 price level. Sadly, the general market decline pushed Ethereum (ETC) down to $14 on August 17, 2023.\n\nHowever, due to Grayscale\u2019s Victory that pumped Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price, Ethereum Classic (ETC), along with other altcoins, appears to be making a comeback.\n\nBetween August 29 and August 30, 2023, Ethereum Classic (ETC) rose from $15.64 to $16.95. This represents an 8% increase in the price of Ethereum Classic (ETC) since Grayscale\u2019s win on August 29, 2023.\n\nDespite its recent price pump, the Ethereum Classic price prediction still shows a pessimistic outlook. Market analysts suggest its current surge is a phase that will die soon. Due to its performance in the past months, experts predict that Ethereum Classic (ETC) will decline to $15.23 by September 2, 2023.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) Yields Impeccable Returns In the Presale Stage\n\nIn a rapidly evolving landscape, VC Spectra (SPCT) has emerged as one of the top DeFi coins in the world of asset management blockchains.
