        "title": "Is Ethereum Losing Steam in 2023? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The crypto market has been having a tough year, to put it mildly. Prices are down across the board, the FTX implosion has left a bad taste in many investors' mouths, and more skeptics are voicing their concerns about the industry's future. While Ethereum (ETH 0.09%) has consistently given investors reason to be optimistic, it's also been hit hard -- falling nearly 70% from its peak in late 2021.\n\nGiven everything that's been happening in the crypto market lately, is Ethereum still a strong investment? Or is it losing steam in 2023? Here's what you need to know.\n\nReasons to be optimistic\n\nDespite the current market volatility, 2022 was a big year for Ethereum. The network successfully completed The Merge, transitioning from a proof-of-work (PoW) mining protocol to proof of stake (PoS), and dramatically decreasing its energy usage.\n\nThis was a major win for Ethereum and could also help it gain market share from the notoriously energy-intensive Bitcoin. It also sets the stage for future updates that will help improve Ethereum's speed and efficiency.\n\nPerhaps the biggest reason to be optimistic about Ethereum's future, though, is its potential in the decentralized application space. Ethereum is one of the most diversified investments in the crypto space because it's the leading blockchain within multiple niches. It's the most popular platform for NFT marketplaces, for example, and a key player in the metaverse. Its smart-contract abilities could also revolutionize a variety of industries.\n\nThe blockchain can also host other cryptocurrencies. Ethereum is home to well-known projects like Shiba Inu, Polygon, Decentraland, and The Sandbox. If NFTs, the metaverse, smart contracts, or any of these Ethereum-hosted cryptocurrencies succeed, the network will benefit from it.\n\nDownsides to consider\n\nThe biggest reason to be skeptical of Ethereum right now is the fact that crypto, in general, is still speculative. Nobody knows for certain whether crypto will succeed over the long term or if it will even exist a decade or two from now. If the entire sector fails, it won't matter how strong the individual cryptocurrencies are.\n\nAlso, because the crypto industry moves so quickly, a new blockchain could disrupt Ethereum's competitive advantage. While Ethereum is a clear leader in the crypto space, its sluggish transaction times and high fees have been holding it back -- and users are getting frustrated.\n\nThe network does have updates in the pipeline to address these issues. But the major ones aren't expected to be completed until late 2023 or 2024, at the earliest. (And Ethereum has a history of delaying upgrades by months or even years.)\n\nThat's a long time in the crypto world, and a smaller competitor could swoop in and steal market share from Ethereum in the meantime.\n\nIs Ethereum still a good investment?\n\nWhen deciding whether to invest in Ethereum in 2023, it's important to weigh risk versus reward. The cryptocurrency has its drawbacks, and the future of crypto, in general, is still uncertain. There are no guarantees that any investment will survive over the long term, so consider your risk tolerance before you buy.\n\nThat said, Ethereum remains one of the strongest crypto assets in the game right now. It's not only the second-most-popular crypto behind Bitcoin, but it's also diversified into several different areas of the industry -- from NFTs to the metaverse, and more.\n\nIn short, Ethereum is a key player in the crypto industry. Despite its short-term volatility, it has a better chance of succeeding over the long run than many other cryptocurrencies. While nobody knows for certain what will happen, Ethereum still has plenty of growth potential."

        "content": "Ethereum layer-2 networks have gone through an explosive growth phase over the past couple of months, a trend that is set to continue in 2023.\n\nAccording to recent data, the leading layer-2 networks have seen an increase in daily active users thathas translated into a growth in fees for the respective ecosystems.\n\nAccording to analytics provider Token Terminal, Polygon leads the pack with 313,457 daily active users as of Jan. 17, a metric that spiked to over 600,000 daily active users earlier in January.\n\nThat\u2019s a 30% increase in activity since the beginning of October, resulting in nearly $55,000 worth of daily fees for Polygon.\n\nOptimism has seen even faster growth, with a 190% gain in daily active users over the past three months. This resulted in daily network fees of $119,475, a gain of almost 140% since the beginning of the year.\n\nArbitrum One currently has 41,694 daily active users, an increase of around 40% over the past three months. Daily fees on the network are just over $40,000, according to the data.\n\nMeanwhile, L2 ecosystem analytics platform L2beat states that Arbitrum has a market share of 52% in terms of total value locked (TVL), which is currently at $2.55 billion. Aribtrum has seen a 9% increase in TVL over the past week.\n\nOptimism, the second-largest L2 network, has a TVL of $1.46 billion, giving it a market share of 30%. Its collateral locked has surged by 15% over the past seven days.\n\nThe two together account for more than 80% of all the collateral locked in layer-2 platforms.\n\nRelated: Optimism and Arbitrum flip Ethereum in combined transaction volume\n\nThere has been an increase of almost 10% in TVL for all L2s over the past week, pushing the total TVL up to $4.89 billion. However, that figure is still down 34% since its peak in April.\n\nNevertheless, this decline is less than half of the retreat DeFi TVL has made since its all-time high. DeFi collateral has declined by 75% since December 2021, according to DeFiLlama, suggesting that there is greater demand and momentum for layer-2 networks at the moment."

This time last week, the crypto market hovered around a $943 billion capitalization; today, that figure is over $1 trillion.\n\nHas Bitcoin bottomed yet?\n\nWith Bitcoin eyeing the key $21,000 level, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has once again surpassed the $1 trillion mark, something experts see as a sign of the market\u2019s potential recovery after the painful crypto winter of 2022.\n\nAccording to CoinGecko\u2019s recent annual crypto industry report, last year, which saw the demise of several high-profile players, ended with a total crypto market capitalization of $829 billion, which is 64.1% lower than the $2.3 trillion in January 2022.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDaily trading volumes have steadily trended downwards over 2022 as well, averaging at $86.0 billion, said the report.\n\nSource: CoinGecko.\n\n\u201c2022 marked a turning point for the crypto industry\u2014one that flushed out unsustainable excesses from the bull run,\u201d CoinGecko co-founder Bobby Ong said in a statement shared with Decrypt. \u201cIn this new year, we hope to see crypto slowly make a recovery, with more efforts going towards rebuilding trust and credibility.\u201d\n\nAs for last week\u2019s performance beyond the top ten, the three top gainers performers are Solana (SOL), which is up 28.5% over the past week, the Ethereum-based meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB), whose price rallied 20.7% over the span, and Polkadot (DOT) with a 10.9% surge."

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price hovers around $1,550 after a bullish start to 2023.\n\nInvestors are already detailing fundamental reasons why the current levels are the best place to accumulate ETH.\n\nDeveloper activity, deflationary status, and staking are a few of the most important reasons that make the smart contract token stand out from the rest.\n\nEthereum has played an extremely important role in building the cryptocurrency ecosystem in the world. Although many blockchains were launched after Bitcoin\u2019s start in 2009, ETH became a major focus of speculation due to the wide range of potential applications it could offer if it were to be successful. Now, Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world, with a market capitalization of $187 billion.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at three reasons why Ethereum may be a good long-term investment.\n\nDeveloper Activity\n\nDespite a good start to 2022, the latter half of the year was brutal and caused investors to suffer significant losses as key players in the industry collapsed. This caused many projects to go under due to affiliation or lack of funds. Regardless, the developer activity seen in the Ethereum blockchain failed to decline.\n\nThe ETH blockchain saw an addition of 234 new developers between December 2021 and 2022, with a total of 5,750 developers working on the smart contract platform. The number of developers combined with the activity of these builders is one of the best ways to measure the value of a particular blockchain. Additionally, as noted in Electric Capital\u2019s developer report, ETH\u2019s ecosystem of developers is 2.8x higher than the next one, which is Polkadot.\n\nElectric Capital\u2019s developer report\n\nDeflationary status\n\nSince the implementation of the Merge update 126 days ago, a total of 2,464 ETH have been burned or taken out of existence. The Merge was a hard fork that migrated Ethereum from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol. In contrast, if Ethereum had stuck with PoW, there would have been 1.48 million ETH added to the network.\n\nFrom a long-term perspective, the deflationary aspects make Ethereum one of the best investment vehicles as Bitcoin is still an inflationary asset since roughly 328,000 BTC are minted per year until all 21 million BTCs are mined.\n\nETH ultrasound\n\nStaking\n\nEthereum enabled staking when it moved from PoW to PoS, and since then, 16 million ETH have been staked. The current staking reward sits around 5.3% Annualized Percentage Rate (APR).\n\nMore recently, it was announced that the Ethereum blockchain would soon undergo another upgrade known as Shanghai, which will enable withdrawals of staked ETH.\n\nETH staked\n\nCombining this information with the Ethereum being a deflationary asset, the real staking yields will only increase in the future. Additionally, with the Shanghai upgrade, users can stake and unstake at will, which is likely to result in a high participation rate, pushing the total staked ETH much higher by 16 million ETH."

ETH is the world\u2019s second-biggest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $187 billion and has generated enormous profits for investors during its hay day. From a modest start of $1 in the indices in 2015 to touching a high of $4,878 in 2021, ETH has created millionaires along the way. Despite the dip in 2022, ETH remains to be a safe long-term investment as it boasts various use cases in the Defi sector.\n\nAlso Read: XRP or ADA: Which Cryptocurrency Might Reach $1 First?\n\nHere\u2019s Why Ethereum Is A Safe Long Term Bet\n\nHighest Developer Activity\n\nEthereum is always buzzing with developments as it receives the highest developer activity compared to other Layer-1 blockchains. Despite the market downturn, the blockchain experienced an increase in activity and a spurt in projects supporting the DeFi cause. Around 5,750 developers work on different smart contract platforms adding 234 new developers between December 2021 and 2022 alone.\n\nElectric Capital published data showing that Ethereum\u2019s developer activity is 2.8x higher than its competitor PolkaDot. The network is always brimming with activity making it the centerpiece of decentralized blockchain technology.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Prediction: Is ETH Gearing Up to Reach $1,800?\n\nSource: Electric Capital\n\nThe ETH Deflationary Status\n\nThe Ethereum network went from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake protocol after The Merge in September 2022. Since the Merge, around 2,464 ETH have been burned and removed from circulation. If Ethereum remained as PoW, it would have added 1.48 million ETH to the network.\n\nThe ETH Staking\n\nThe staking option is now enabled after the Ethereum network moved from PoW to PoS last year. Since then, 16 million ETH is staked and the present staking returns are around 5.3% Annualized Percentage Rate (APR). ETH being a deflationary asset with staking yields, many investors would earn passive income throughout the tenure. The total staked amount would go much above 16 million in 2023 putting the tokens constantly to work.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin at $20,000 is Full of Roses: Where are the Thorns?\n\nIn conclusion, all these developments make Ethereum a safe long-term bet that could pay off in the long run.\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $1,549 and is up 2.1% in the 24 hours day trade. ETH is down 68.2% from its all-time high of $4,878, which it reached in November 2021."

        "content": "EY and Polygon have updated the public domain source code for Nightfall to enable the development of privacy-focused enterprise blockchain solutions.\n\nNightfall is an optimistic zero-knowledge roll-up that helps enable private transactions on the public Ethereum blockchain. Using Nightfall, enterprises can orchestrate private transactions efficiently on the Ethereum mainnet without compromising the transparency, data immutability and security that Ethereum provides.\n\nEY first contributed Nightfall to the public domain in 2019 as a set of protocols to enable private transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. In September 2021, EY teamed up with Polygon to create a beta version of Nightfall that can mitigate network congestion and high transaction prices resulting from increased usage and wider adoption of Ethereum.\n\nEY OpsChain and EY Blockchain Analyzer both use Nightfall, and both solutions are delivered through EY Blockchain\u2019s SaaS platform, Blockchain.ey.com.\n\nThis version of Nightfall introduces two important changes over prior versions: First, to prevent control by an organization or group, the code can be deployed on a fully decentralized basis. Second, to prevent anonymous usage while retaining an open and permissionless network model, users are required to have an enterprise-class X.509 identification certificate to deposit or withdraw.\n\nNightfall will remain in the public domain to facilitate the adoption of privacy-focused enterprise solutions among companies seeking to enter Ethereum and conduct business on the network.\n\nPaul Brody, EY global blockchain leader, said: \u201cThis update marks the readiness of Nightfall to enable development of enterprise solutions. With more than six months of testnet operations, we consider this a \u2018production beta\u2019, ready for enabling client supply chain and business operations.\u201d\n\nAntoni Martin, Polygon co-founder responsible for Nightfall, said: \u201cThe move to update Nightfall in the public domain is a major milestone in scaling the Ethereum ecosystem and will open up new use cases for enterprises in Web3.\u201d"

In June, an investor used the stablecoin to purchase carbon credits.\n\nNAB\u2019s stablecoin will also allow for carbon credit trading, the AFR reported. Other functions could include cross-border payments and repurchase agreements.\n\nIndividual banks are working on their own stablecoins after a failed attempt to cooperate on a single industry-wide Australian dollar stablecoin.

        "content": "A new annual report from early-stage venture firm Electric Capital shows massive developer activity growth on four blockchain projects, including two Ethereum (ETH) rivals.\n\nAccording to the firm, active developers on the Polygon (MATIC) and Cosmos (ATOM) blockchains along with ETH rivals Solana (SOL) and Polkadot (DOT) shot up in 2022 by more than 400% from five years ago.\n\nSays Maria Shen, an investor at Electric Capital,\n\n\u201cWhile prices are at 2018 levels, developer ecosystems are multiples bigger.\u201d\n\nThese four blockchain projects each saw less than 200 monthly developers in 2018, but that increased to more than 1,000 in 2012.\n\nAccording to the report, Polygon has just over 1,000 monthly active developers, Cosmos just under 2,000, Polkadot about 2,000 and Solana about 2,250.\n\nIn the crypto space as a whole, developer activity started off at 1,000 monthly active developers writing code in the first seven years of the nascent technology.

        "content": "Tel-Aviv, Israel --News Direct-- SSV.Network\n\nssv.network DAO is launching a $50 Million Ecosystem Fund dedicated to supporting the development of Distributed Validator Technology (\u201cDVT\u201d) based applications. To usher in the next wave of Ethereum staking technologies, a host of Staking companies and VCs from the crypto space - including the likes of DCG, OKX, HashKey, NGC, Everstake, HackVC, GSR, Chorus.One, SevenX, 1kx, and more - have joined forces to help advance the next generation of staking solutions. All of these major players have come together to promote Ethereum\u2019s decentralization through the use of DVT.\n\nThe Fund is the first of its kind, dedicated solely to DVT use cases. Partners backing up the Fund are placing a special emphasis on helping projects that will support Ethereum\u2019s decentralization over the long run as more stakers join the network. DVT and the various use cases being built using the tech are similar to the early days of L2 implementations. However, each technology works on its own specific problem, DVT, focusing on Ethereum\u2019s security and decentralization, and L2s, which focuses on transaction speed and lowering costs.\n\nThe Fund's purpose is to Solidify DVT as critical Ethereum infrastructure\n\nDVT is a key component in Vitalik\u2019s Ethereum's roadmap toward a fully decentralized Ethereum 2.0. The ssv.network is the first implementation of DVT and has positioned itself as Ethereum's security layer - or Layer 0. With each Ethereum validator that uses DVT, the network becomes more decentralized and secure, bringing it one step closer to a global network uncensorable by any one entity.\n\nEarlier this year, the ssv.network DAO pledged $3 Million for developer grants. In less than 12 months, over $1.2 Million has been allocated to over 20 leading companies in the Proof of Stake (\u201cPOS\u201d) ecosystem. Among the grantees are industry-leading builders, including Blockscape, ANKR, Stader, Moonstake, and others using DVT to build their next-gen applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe time to build is now!\n\nTotal ETH at stake has officially reached 16 million, with the majority of it concentrated in the hands of a few players. It leaves the Ethereum ecosystem in demand for decentralizing factors such as DVT. Considering that the Shanghai update and the ssv.network\u2019s mainnet are approaching in 2023, there has never been a better time to build than the present.\n\nAlon Muroch, Core Dev Lead - \u201dDistributing Ethereum\u2019s security layer has never been more important. The protocol is currently secured by a small group of companies which, when put together, control the entire Blockchain. DVT\u2019s aim is to distribute Ethereum\u2019s security by offering quick and easy access to an open-source, public good that will completely change the way staking is operated today. There are already more than 20 companies building on top of ssv.network\u2019s DVT protocol, and that list is expected to grow significantly with the Eco Fund\u2019s launch\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe that we are currently in a pivotal moment in ETH staking. We expect staked assets to increase as staking yields are considered the benchmark return for ETH owners. A near-term tailwind is Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade, which is due to be released in the first half of this year and will enable liquidity for those contributing to the network\u2019s core infrastructure. Few teams are as well-positioned as SSV to convene the diverse and cutting-edge products and applications that are using and developing staking technology. We are excited to support those projects as a founding member of this ecosystem initiative.\u201d According to Samantha Bohbot, VP Growth for DCG.\n\nAbout ssv.networks\n\nsv.network is a leader in the development of Distributed Validator Tech. DVT enables the distributed operation of Ethereum validators through a network of trustless nodes. As a core component of Ethereum\u2019s roadmap, DVT aims to solve protocol-wide correlation and downtime risks. The network is constructed as a community-owned public good run by hundreds of nodes across the globe. The Network supports over 50 development teams building next-gen ETH staking applications. The various use cases ranging from staking services to solo stakers built on the SSV protocol will usher in the widespread usage and adoption of the DVT primitive.\n\nContact Details\n\nMarketAcross\n\nItai Elizur\n\nItai@marketacross.com\n\nCompany Website\n\nhttps://ssv.network/\n\nView source version on newsdirect.com: https://newsdirect.com/news/ssv-network-launches-50-million-ecosystem-fund-to-support-ethereum-pos-decentralization-562449608"

The FKWME NFT passes will be released to the public on February 1, with a price of 0.19 ETH\u2014about $290 each at present.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement, NYX Global Brand President Yann Joffredo said GORJS was created to shine a light on \u201c3D creators\u201d and give them \u201ca path to success within the Web3 ecosystem.\u201d\n\nJoffredo sees digital \u201cmakeup\u201d designs as being radically different from what's possible with physical cosmetics, because creators can go above and beyond with surreal elements that defy the laws of physics.\n\n\u201cFrom extraterrestrial glass skin to morphing elemental lashes, makeup and digital fantasy are entwined in an aspirational, accessible way,\u201d Joffredo told Decrypt via email. \u201cIn one instance, eyelashes might be stacked in a multi-tier beauty application norm; in Web3, they could dramatically flare into lifelike flames that dare the viewer to dream.\u201d\n\nNYX\u2019s DAO, then, is a move beyond physical cosmetics sold at drug stores\u2014an exploration of what makeup means in the digital age of avatars and pseudonymity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe believe that a new generation of Web3 creators will help redefine beauty,\u201d Joffredo told Decrypt.\n\nThis Web3 push also appears to be a move away from NYX\u2019s traditional diet of beauty influencer content, which typically consists of smartphone footage of creators applying makeup shared to Web2 social media platforms like TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube.\n\nWhen asked how NYX\u2019s DAO and NFTs align with the brand\u2019s demographic, Joffredo said that NYX has always been a \u201cpioneer in the digital and aspiring artistry space.\u201d Joffredo also said NYX has a history of supporting \u201crising makeup creators\u201d and \u201cyoung creators\u201d in the beauty industry.\n\nDespite the decline of the NFT market over the past several months, Joffredo believes GORJS will still be able to deliver on its ambitious vision.\n\nThe Ethereum DAO\u2019s members will use non-transferable GORJS governance tokens\u2014capped at a total supply of 100 million\u2014as voting chips for various DAO proposals and projects. A DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, is a group of crypto enthusiasts who attempt collective governance over pooled resources using tokens for community voting.\n\nIn an ideal DAO structure, there is no single entity that holds all the power, and the community is able to execute on a common goal or mission\u2014whether it's supporting a protocol, collecting valuable assets, etc.\u2014using a more egalitarian power structure instead of a top-down one.\n\nImage: GORGJS DAO.\n\nDAO members can earn the \u201csoulbound\u201d GORJS tokens in a variety of ways, including by purchasing a FKWME Pass NFT (pronounced \u201cfuck with me\u201d). If a token is \u201csoulbound,\u201d it means it\u2019s non-transferable and cannot be moved from the holder\u2019s wallet.\n\nJoffredo told Decrypt the FKWME name was chosen because it\u2019s \u201ca casual phrase used when you want others to share the same vision as you: to join you, connect with you, and vibe with you on a social level.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe NFT automatically grants the holder a daily yield of GORJS tokens, and also allowlists the holder for future NFT airdrops and exclusive future sales. The DAO will also offer an NFT minting tool, allowing members to mint their art through its site.\n\nSomething new in beauty just dropped\ud83d\udc40\n\nINTRODUCING GORJS \u2728 Want to find out what we mean?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 https://t.co/WApCVh5CTZ #TheFutureIsGORJS #LFG pic.twitter.com/hyNSwkA1u9 \u2014 NYX Pro Makeup US (@NYXCosmetics) January 10, 2023\n\nGORJS founding members include NYX\u2019s Joffredo, NYX Global VP of Digital and Ecommerce Matthieu Guerin, and three other NYX executives. Each NYX executive will hold 2% of the total token supply at launch.\n\nThe DAO also has a number of Web3-focused executives on its advisory team, including The Sandbox co-founder Sebastien Borget, Ready Player Me founder Timmu Toke, Polygon Labs Metaverse Lead Brian Trunzo, and Amber Ward, CEO of creative agency Invisible North.\n\n\u201cI decided to join as [an] advisor because they are genuinely purpose-driven,\u201d Borget told Decrypt in a message. \u201cI believe they have designed a DAO system which truly benefits the digital talent, creators, and artists.\u201d\n\nWard told Decrypt that NYX isn\u2019t necessarily trying to target its retail customer base with its Web3 efforts.\n\n\u201cThe primary demographic for GORJS is creators and digital artists who are native to Web3,\u201d Ward said in a message. \u201cThis is a niche, long-term play.\u201d\n\nThe DAO\u2019s litepaper suggests it may lean heavily into \u201cartist referrals\u201d to grow its community, rewarding those who successfully bring their creative friends into the DAO with GORJS tokens.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile this could be interpreted as a type of multi-level marketing (MLM) scheme, that\u2019s apparently not the case here because GORJS tokens cannot be converted into real funds. More referrals won\u2019t give members money directly, but it could lead to more individual power in the DAO.\n\nThe litepaper also explicitly states that GORJS tokens are not an \u201cinvestment\u201d and \u201cunder no circumstances are tokens able to be exchanged for any L\u2019Oreal equities, securities, or currency.\u201d\n\nBorget told Decrypt that the soulbound nature of the GORJS token solves what otherwise could lead to governance token speculation, which crypto founders like Ethereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin have disparaged in recent months.\n\n\u201cThe governance is truly meant to be a recommendation engine through relying on [soulbound tokens] that cannot be sold, and hence does not risk becoming a financial instrument,\u201d Borget said.\n\nNYX\u2019s dive into Web3 aligns with parent company L'Or\u00e9al\u2019s fascination with crypto. L'Or\u00e9al is already involved in the metaverse and digital community-building space, having invested in metaverse startup Digital Village through its VC arm, Bold. It\u2019s also no surprise that NYX has entered Web3, considering L'Or\u00e9al\u2019s 17 trademark applications filed last year for NFTs and blockchain uses for its brands including NYX, Kiehl\u2019s, and Urban Decay.\n\nAs NYX moves forward with its Web3 plans, it remains unclear whether the average NYX customer is interested in crypto\u2014or whether NYX\u2019s Web3 world will garner a new demographic of users entirely.\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to correct the list of project advisors following a last-minute change to the announcement materials."

        "content": "SSV DAO, the decentralized autonomous organization behind the decentralized staking protocol SSV.network, is starting a $50 million ecosystem fund to help mature Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) infrastructure.\n\nDVT refers to a technology development that would allow an Ethereum proof-of-stake validator to be run on more than one node simultaneously. The technology is a key component in Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Ethereum road map for decentralization.\n\nBecause of the high cost of entry to run a validator node, critics say that the Ethereum protocol is uncomfortably centralized across only a handful of major actors. While there are just over 500,000 validators, the majority are concentrated in a handful of pools: Lido has just over 25% of the validators in its pool, Coinbase (COIN) has 11.7%, Kraken has 7%, and Binance has 5.4%.\n\nThe fund is being led by SSV and Digital Currency Group (DCG). DCG is also the parent company of CoinDesk.\n\nIn July, SSV launched a $10 million pool to distribute grants to build DVT projects using the SSV protocol. So far, it has granted $2 million, and high-performing grant recipients will be shortlisted for this new ecosystem fund. Grantees included Blockscape, ANKR, Stader and Moonshake.\n\n\"It\u2019s important because DVT is becoming a major focus for Ethereum,\u201d Alon Muroch, technical lead, SSV Network, said to CoinDesk in a note. \u201cMore funds, companies, DAOs are getting involved. It\u2019s going to be as widespread as layer 2s, and Maximal Extractable Value after the tech hits the Ethereum mainnet in 2023. The funds involved are at the ground level supporting this change.\"\n\nEarlier this month blockchain startup Obol Labs raised $12.5 million in a round co-led by Pantera and Archetype to build out a DVT platform for Ethereum."

        "content": "The National Australia Bank has developed a stablecoin for carbon trading and overseas payments.\n\nAUDN will launch on Ethereum and Algorand.\n\nThe National Australia Bank (NAB) has become the second major Australian bank to create a stablecoin, titled the AUDN. The stablecoin would allow its business customers to settle transactions on blockchain technology using Australian dollars in real-time.\n\nStablecoin launched on Ethereum and Algorand\n\nAccording to a report by AFR, AUDN will launch on the Ethereum [ETH] and Algorand [ALGO] blockchains. NAB\u2019s Chief Innovation Officer, Howard Silby, stated that AUDN could also serve other purposes, such as carbon credit trading and repurchase agreements.\n\nNAB\u2019s stablecoin is fully backed, one-for-one, with Australian fiat money held in trust by the bank. This currency comes nine months after the Melbourne-based rival ANZ created their own stablecoin, known as A$DC.\n\nThis move highlighted the growing role of banks in driving innovation in the digital economy. NAB plans to launch the stablecoin by the middle of 2023 if everything goes well.\n\nThe creation of stablecoins by individual banks has emerged after the big four banks of Australia attempted to create an industry-wide Australian dollar stablecoin early last year, but the effort failed due to competition concerns and banks being at different stages in their crypto strategy.\n\nAustralia\u2019s crypto policy\n\nAustralia\u2019s government was still mulling over stablecoin regulation at press time. Notably, stablecoin regulation was part of a private member\u2019s bill that Australian Senator Andrew Bragg drafted in September 2022.\n\nTo strengthen safety around crypto, the Australian government has promised to establish a framework for the licensing and regulation of crypto service providers in 2023. Additionally, the country\u2019s central bank has started a pilot test to explore potential use cases for Australia\u2019s own central bank digital currency. The creation of CBDCs will likely be completed by mid-2023 as well."

        "title": "Ethereum Name Service (ENS) DAO Proposes 10,000 ETH Auction To Diversify Treasury - Ethereum World News",
        "content": "Summary:\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service governance proposal aims to create an extra runway for the project should the crypto market suffer another downturn.\n\n10,000 ETH would be sold for Circle\u2019s USDC via a Gnosis auction, Wednesday\u2019s proposal suggested.\n\nENS DAO held around $2.4 million in stablecoin and some 40,000 Ether in its treasury at press time.\n\nA member of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) DAO submitted a governance proposal aimed at diversifying the protocol\u2019s treasury and hedging against further downturns in the crypto market. The details of the draft proposed offloading 10,000 Ether (ETH) worth around $13 million at today\u2019s prices.\n\nThe ENS treasury held over 40,000 ETH and almost $3 million in Circle\u2019s USD Coin (USDC), crypto\u2019s second largest stablecoin by market cap. According to the member\u2019s proposal, swapping 10,000 ETH for 13 million in USDC will allow the project to hold enough liquidity to offset operating costs for the next 24 months, regardless of crypto asset prices.\n\nIndeed, the broader digital asset and financial markets suffered huge downturns in 2022 following harsh macro conditions and a series of industry implosions like Terra. When Ethereum Name Service fully launched its service and token in November 2021, Ether peaked at over $4,000 and set an all-time high.\n\nETH\u2019s price has since dipped over 60% in over a year and currently trades around $1,500. The ENS community member argued that securing liquidity is essential since the project\u2019s primary revenue is in Ether.\n\nThe DAO currently keeps almost 100% of its spendable treasury in ETH. While ENS generates protocol revenue in ETH, having so much exposure to a single volatile asset places the DAO in a vulnerable position.\n\n2.8 Million Ethereum Name Service Domains Registered in 2022\n\nEthereum Name Service enjoyed massive user activity in 2022 despite crypto prices taking a beating. Dune Analytics data showed over 2.8 million domains registered and over 600,000 unique wallets created.\n\nENS runs atop the Ethereum blockchain and was initially a part of the Ethereum Foundation in 2017. However, the service broke off as a standalone entity a year later in 2018, and is managed by True Names Limited.\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service protocol allows users to attach a simple name like \u201cxyz.eth\u201d to their ETH wallets. ENS was built as a solution to make crypto wallets more accessible, meaning that users do not have to memorize complicated long-form addresses.\n\nIndeed, the service is similar to web2 domain registrations where users link a dot-com name to their numeric internet protocol addresses."

        "content": "Several countries have been planning to explore stablecoins despite the initial reluctance and more recent implosion of Terra. The latest one to jump on the bandwagon is one of Australia\u2019s four largest financial institutions \u2013 National Australia Bank (NAB).\n\nThe new Australian dollar-pegged stablecoin created by NAB, dubbed AUDN, is set to be launched on the Ethereum and Algorand blockchain networks. It is expected to be completed by mid-2023.\n\nAustralia\u2019s Second Stablecoin Initiative\n\nAccording to the Australian Financial Review (AFR) report, the AUDN will enable users to settle transactions on blockchain technology in real-time with the help of Australian dollars. The NAB also said the stablecoin is designed to serve multiple purposes, such as carbon credit trading, cross-border money transfers, and repurchase agreements. Furthermore, the bank will be in charge of holding the Australian fiat-backed stablecoin.\n\nIn a statement, NAB Chief Innovation officer Howard Silby was quoted saying,\n\n\u201cWe certainly believe there are elements of blockchain technology that will form part of the future of finance [\u2026] From our point of view, we see [blockchain] has the potential to deliver instantaneous, transparent, inclusive, financial outcomes.\u201d\n\nThe current infrastructure for overseas transactions is dominated by the SWIFT network, which is undoubtedly a legacy system. However, AUDN\u2019s launch could provide an effective alternative for many users.\n\nThe development comes four months after Australian Senator Andrew Bragg drafted a bill aiming to put the domestic cryptocurrency sector under strict supervision. The bill required digital asset exchanges and stablecoin issuers to reveal their operations to authorities. It also targeted Chinese banks dealing with digital yuan in the country.\n\nOther Countries Dabbling in Stablecoins\n\nWith the creation of AUDN, NAB has become the second major bank in the country to launch an Australian dollar-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum network. Last year, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) minted a stablecoin pegged to the Australian fiat in collaboration with crypto custodian Fireblocks.\n\nThis week, Russia and Iran were reportedly engaged in talks over launching a new cryptocurrency backed by gold. Alexander Brazhnikov, executive director of the Russian Association of the Crypto Industry and Blockchain, asserted that the token would be developed as a stablecoin."

        "title": "3 Cryptocurrencies to Buy in Any Bear Market - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "In 2022, investors watched in dismay as the value of cryptocurrencies crashed back down to earth. By the end of the year, the entire market cap of the crypto market was less than $1 trillion, meaning that more than $2 trillion was wiped out during the year. Even worse, these losses were across the board, as nearly every cryptocurrency finished the year in the red.\n\nThat said, there are a handful of cryptocurrencies that could make for interesting investments during a bear market. Bitcoin (BTC 0.50%), Ethereum (ETH 0.09%), and Cardano (ADA -0.60%) are at the top of the list.\n\nBitcoin\n\nAs the top crypto by market capitalization, Bitcoin has become the favorite crypto asset to buy for both retail and institutional investors. In part, this is due to its truly staggering investment returns. During the 10-year period from 2011-2021, Bitcoin was the top-performing asset in the world, and it wasn't even close.\n\nWhile past performance is no guarantee of future results, it's hard to argue with this type of success over a long period of time. The hope, quite frankly, is that last year was just a temporary setback.\n\nAfter all, Bitcoin has demonstrated a strong track record of bouncing back from previous market declines. Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has undergone a handful of different bear market crashes, and has emerged healthier each time. Moreover, Bitcoin has had two other years -- 2014 and 2018 -- that were just as bad as the year investors just experienced, so there's plenty to like about Bitcoin's resilience. In 2014, Bitcoin fell by 58%, and in 2018, Bitcoin fell by 73%.\n\nOne other factor in Bitcoin's favor involves the accelerating pace of its global adoption. This helps provide important diversification. The U.S. market might be tanking, for example, but other markets around the world could be surging. Ever since El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender back in 2021, nations around the world have explored how Bitcoin adoption might spur future growth. For example, in December 2022, Brazil announced sweeping new Bitcoin legislation that clearly delineates how this crypto can be used for both online payments and investments.\n\nEthereum\n\nJust like Bitcoin, Ethereum has also bounced back from market declines ever since its launch back in 2015. Ethereum is the world's second-leading crypto by market capitalization, and its blockchain is increasingly being integrated into the tech stacks of major companies around the world, from Wall Street to Main Street. Banks on Wall Street are exploring new products and services based on Ethereum, while consumer brands are using Ethereum for new marketing promotions that involve non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nNow that Ethereum has pulled off The Merge and upgraded to a proof-of-stake blockchain, it is faster and more efficient. This important new upgrade will continue to support the growth of the world's most vibrant crypto ecosystem, which includes decentralized applications, smart contracts, and tokens.\n\nEthereum is the market leader in important blockchain niches such as NFTs, decentralized finance (DeFi), and the metaverse. This provides an important diversification benefit, since Ethereum -- unlike many other cryptos -- is not a one-trick pony. When arriving at a valuation for Ethereum, investors need to take into account the value of this broader ecosystem.\n\nCardano\n\nFinally, there's Cardano, which remains firmly entrenched as one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Similar to Ethereum, Cardano is a Layer 1 blockchain that offers smart contract functionality. As a result, the same type of diversified ecosystem that exists for Ethereum also exists for Cardano, albeit on a smaller scale. This might not be too surprising, given that Charles Hoskinson, one of the co-founders of Ethereum, is the founder of Cardano.\n\nIn 2022, Cardano ranked as the top blockchain in terms of development activity, and has one of the largest developer communities in the world. It also has a peer-reviewed approach to blockchain development, which ensures that any changes or upgrades to the blockchain have been rigorously tested and reviewed. While this sometimes slows the introduction of new offerings, it does protect Cardano from the typical pitfalls experienced by other blockchains that are trying to grow fast.\n\nGiven this strong base, Cardano is precisely the type of crypto that will continue to build during a bear market. Cardano's vision is to become the top blockchain in the world for the unbanked, and the blockchain stands out for the work it is doing to power growth in developing markets such as Africa.\n\nBear-proof your crypto portfolio\n\nOf course, it is impossible to bear-proof your crypto portfolio. As investors saw in 2022, a widespread market decline will take down all cryptos, even market stalwarts. But if you are looking for relatively safe, stable cryptos that you can hold for the long term and buy even during bear markets, then Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano should be at the top of your list."

The company has recently come under fire for its role in censoring Ethereum transactions.\n\n$1 Billion Valuation\n\nFlashbots is changing its business model.\n\nAccording to a report from The Block, crypto\u2019s leading MEV organization is looking to raise between $30 million and $50 million at a $1 billion valuation.\n\nInterestingly, Flashbots is reportedly conducting a reverse-pitching process: instead of pitching prospective investors, the organization is inviting investors to make their own pitches\u2014meaning that they need to convince the company to accept their funds. Crypto investment fund Paradigm is reportedly leading the investment round; the firm was Flashbots\u2019 lead investor in its seed-stage fundraise in 2020.\n\nMEV stands for \u201cMaximal Extractable Value.\u201d The term refers to arbitraging on-chain trading opportunities by reordering transactions within a block while it is being produced. Flashbots provides an off-chain block-building marketplace for on-chain traders and validators, with the stated aim of streamlining MEV and mitigating its negative impacts on users. According to Flashbots data, MEV has extracted more than $687 million from blockchain users since January 2020.\n\nFlashbots, which has marketed itself as an Ethereum public good in the past, has recently come under controversy over its willingness to censor Tornado Cash-related transactions on Ethereum in order to comply with OFAC sanctions. According to MEV Watch, at the time of writing 66% of Ethereum blocks are being produced by MEV-Boost relays that have expressed their intention of censoring such transactions; Flashbots is responsible for producing over 65% of these censorious blocks. In a sense, the organization\u2019s fundraising efforts mean that investors may be financially rewarded for censoring Ethereum transactions.\n\nDisclaimer: At the time of writing, the author of this piece owned BTC, ETH, and several other crypto assets."

        "content": "PALO ALTO, Calif., Jan. 20, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mega Matrix Corp. (\u201cMTMT\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NYSE American: MTMT), today announced that the Company closed its initial round of private placement (\u201cPrivate Placement\u201d) launched on December 23, 2022 and will issue an aggregate of 4,314,615 shares of Common Stock, at a price of $1.30 per share for aggregate gross of approximately $5.6 million. In addition, the Company had completed the private placement of $4.4 million previously in October 2022.\n\n\n\nIn the past 3 months, the Company raised over $10 million in total to develop its new business model in digital assets staking. The new business model is two-fold: engaging in solo-staking and providing staking as a service (\u201cStaaS\u201d). The Company has previously explored Solo-Staking in Q3 2022 and plans to pursue its StaaS under Saving Digital Pte. Ltd., the Company\u2019s Singapore subsidiary.\n\nSolo-Staking enables the Company to utilize its Ethereum (ETH) treasury to stake on the Ethereum beacon chain and to earn ETH-denominated rewards directly from the Ethereum protocol. The Company will operate StaaS through its staking platform \u201cMarsProtocol,\u201d an individual and institutional grade designed staking platform, assisting users to participate in staking to earn ETH rewards and yield in a safer, more stable, and more efficient way. For more information, please visit: http://www.marsprotocol.com.\n\nFollowing the transition by Ethereum on September 15, 2022 from proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism (the \u201cMerge\u201d), Ethereum shifted to a PoS validation system where validators stake their ETH into a smart contract on Ethereum to serve as collateral that can be destroyed if the validator behaves dishonestly or lazily. The validator (selected randomly) is then responsible for processing the blockchain transactions, storing data and adding new blocks to the blockchain. To become a validator on Ethereum, a participant must stake 32 ETH. MarsProtocol will seek to provide a non-custodian StaaS platform where its users\u2019 private keys are not stored in its data base to ensure the safety of its users\u2019 digital assets.\n\n\u201cWe are very excited about our new business strategy, and we are looking forward to provide the excellent digital assets staking services through MarsProtocol enabling users to earn ETH rewards through an easy-to-use platform,\" said Mr. Yucheng Hu, CEO of Mega Matrix Corp.\n\nAbout Mega Matrix: Mega Matrix Corp. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a holding company located in Palo Alto, California with four subsidiaries: Saving Digital Pte. Ltd., a Singapore corporation (\u201cSaving\u201d), MarsProtocol Inc., an exempt company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, Mega Metaverse Corp., a California corporation (\u201cMega\u201d) and JetFleet Management Corp. a California corporation (\u201cJetFleet\u201d). The Company will engage in solo-staking and provide staking as a service (\u201cStaaS\u201d) services through its staking platform \u201cMarsProtocol,\u201d and will continue to focus on third-party management service contracts for aircraft operations through our majority owned subsidiary JetFleet, which was part of our legacy business.

        "content": "Crypto.com\u2019s 2022 report notes that global crypto ownership increased by 39% despite \u2018winter\u2019\n\nEthereum (ETH) owners grew by 263% from 24 million in January to 87 million in December, accounting for 20% of global owners.\n\nCrypto.com has published its Crypto Market Sizing Report 2022, which provides insights into the actual dynamics within the digital asset market.\n\nThe key takeaway of the report is that global crypto owners increased by 39% in 2022, rising from 306 million in January to 425 million in December in spite of macro headwinds, namely high inflation, the conflict in Europe, supply chain disruptions, and lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs to the top crypto assets in the market:\n\nBitcoin (BTC) owners grew by 20% from 183 million in January to 219 million in December, accounting for 52% of global owners;\n\nEthereum (ETH) owners grew by 263% from 24 million in January to 87 million in December, accounting for 20% of global owners.\n\nFor Bitcoin, the strongest growth in 2022 happened in April when the Central African Republic became the second country to adopt BTC as legal tender after EI Salvador and Goldman Sachs offered its first BTC-backed loan, showing further signs of increased interest in crypto from Wall Street institutions.\n\nCrypto.com further explained that the main catalyst behind Ethereum\u2019s high adoption growth rate \u2013 ETH owners grew by 263% vs BTC owners that grew by 20% \u2013 was The Merge: a highly anticipated event that marked the completion of the network\u2019s transition from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm.\n\nEthereum\u2019s rising adoption in 2022 was also due to interest from institutional investors and the popularity of ETH liquid staking.\n\nCrypto.com lays off 1,000 people and delists Tether (USDT) in Canada\n\nAlthough Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced a positive week in terms of market prices, the FTX contagion is spreading and made a new victim. Genesis, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nAmid the \u2018crypto winter\u2019, digital assets exchanges have been announcing lay offs. This is the case for Crypto.com, which plans to lay off 20% of its corporate workforce, or nearly 1000 people, in order to adapt to current market conditions, CEO Kris Marszalek said in a tweet on Friday.\n\nEmployees were told the firm was seeking to trim expenses and narrow its focus to more-promising businesses amid chilly crypto winter. Marszalek said several factors played into their decision to reduce headcount. Despite maintaining a strong balance sheet, he claims, Crypto.com had to navigate economic headwinds and unforeseeable industry events. He explains that they grew ambitiously at the start of 2022, aligning with the broader industry, but the trajectory has now changed with a confluence of negative developments.\n\nCrypto.com also made headlines after it told its Canadian customers that it will delist Tether\u2019s stablecoin (USDT) trading, transactions, deposits and withdrawals by the end of this month.\n\nThe write-off of the world\u2019s largest and most liquid stablecoin comes as the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) has banned crypto exchanges operating in the region from touching Tether (USDT). The decision dates back to 2021 when the stablecoin was deeply linked to alleged market manipulation, and it was the only prohibited digital asset in the country."

        "content": "The number of non-fungible tokens sold in 2022 reached 101 million.\n\nThe NFT market generated $24.7 billion in trading volume in 2022, a minor fall from $25.1 billion in 2021.\n\nThe number of Non-Fungible Tokens [NFTs] sold in 2022 reached 101 million, a surge of 67.57% over the previous year. The results were released as part of a Dapp Radar report on blockchain and decentralized application adoption in 2022.\n\nAs per the report, the Ethereum [ETH] ecosystem dominated the NFT ecosystem, accounting for 21% of the market and processing over 21.2 million transactions. Wax [WAXP] (14.5 million), Polygon [MATIC] (13.3 million), and Solana [SOL] (12.9 million) followed suit.\n\nTransaction activity in the Solana and ImmutableX ecosystems increased by 440% and 315%, respectively, compared to 2021. Meanwhile, the data showed no change in the Binance [BNB] ecosystem, with approximately one million transactions expected in both 2021 and 2022.\n\nWithin the last two years, the dominant category of dApps on various chains shifted as well. DeFi apps dominated all but two of the 13 chains in 2021. There was a significant shift toward gaming and NFT dApps in 2022.\n\nEthereum and Cardano [ADA] remain the most active developers, with 223 and 151 active protocols, respectively. Modular blockchains such as Polkadot [DOT] and Cosmos [ATOM] saw their network developer activities rise by 16% and 131.7% respectively.\n\nNFT trades were worth $24.7 billion in 2022, down from 2021\n\nAccording to a previous Dapp Radar report, the NFT market generated approximately $24.7 billion in organic trading volume across blockchain platforms and marketplaces in 2022. This represented a slight decrease from the $25.1 billion total recorded in 2021.\n\nThe data excludes trades suspected to be wash trades, or trades that have been manipulated in some way.\n\n2022 saw the transaction of 101 million NFTs, compared to around 58.6 million NFT transactions in 2021. In other words, most of the NFTs were traded at lower USD values due to falling NFT prices amidst a crumbling crypto market.\n\nNFTs have continued to play an important role in the growing Web3 industry. They have also initiated a shift away from hype-based drops to utility-centric projects with long-term value."

        "content": "China launches smart contracts for its digital yuan, on leading shopping application Meituan.\n\nEthereum smart contracts are still healthy and likely to outpace the completion.\n\nChina is still on the path of increasing adoption for its country\u2019s central backed digital currency (CBDC). In its most recent attempt to further usage, the country has launched interactive smart contracts for its CBDC ; the digital yuan.\n\nChina kicks off the new year with a recent smart contact functionality launch. It took place on the 17th of January 2023, and runs on one of the country\u2019s most popular application Meituan.\n\nThe smart contract launch comes four months after the country\u2019s PBOC\u2019s Digital Currency Institute teased the integration of a smart-contract functionality. Shortly after, the announcement was followed up with the launch of a smart contract-based function. It was designed to halt the collection of funds from payees, who might be making away with prepaid funds.\n\nIn a bid to attract users, the smart contract is giving users a daily price for usage. Users can take in as much as 8,888 RMB (1,312) on a daily basis.\n\nHowever, the offer is only open to users who make a purchase for payment on the application, using China\u2019s digital yuan.\n\nAs reported by a local media platform, users are able to earn a portion of the 8,888 RMB. When the smart contract tracks and finds specific keywords from the users\u2019 items and purchases that tally with the words it generated for that day.\n\nIf both the words generated by the smart contract, and the words on the users\u2019 items and name matches, the user will win some of the money up for grabs. The cash prize will be transferred into their digital yuan wallet.\n\nIs China\u2019s new smart contract relevant enough to outperform Ethereum\u2019s?\n\nMeituan is a leading E-commerce shopping application. Formerly known as Meituan-Dianping, the application helps users local customer products and other retail services.\n\nAccording to data from the statistics platform expandedramblings, Meituan had a monthly merchant count total of 8.3 million. The application also had an active monthly user count of 290 million and 600 million registered users as of April 2018.\n\nWith a large number of users on the platform, adoption for the digital yuan is likely going to surge in the near future. The added daily benefits are also attractive to users, and is poised to increase usage of the newly integrated smart contract.\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s smart contract platform might not be severely affected by the digital yuan\u2019s smart contract. This is particularly because the demand for Ethereum smart contracts is still notably high.\n\nAdditionally , statistics from Web3 dev platform Alchemy, revealed that Ethereum smart contract deployment surged by an outstanding 293% in 2022. During the fourth quarter of the same year, smart contract deployment on Ethereum surged by 453%.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

This number increased by 293% when compared to 2021, reaching rates that were comparable to the peaks of the previous year.\n\nRemarkably, this peak of activity occurred in the fourth quarter of 2022, coinciding with the collapse of FTX, which caused significant capital outflows across the industry\u2019s main exchanges.\n\nPer the findings of the study, the number of operational smart contracts in the fourth quarter of 2022 increased by an astounding 453% over the previous quarter to reach an impressive 4.6 million.\n\nQ4 2022 operation smart contracts. Source: Alchemy\n\nThe transition that Ethereum made in September 2022 from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) led to a surge in interest in staking on the part of a number of different stakeholders, including institutions.\n\nFinally The Ethereum network will also undergo another significant upgrade in the form of its Shanghai update in March 2023. The key points include a drop in the gas fee for layers 2 solutions, which has the potential to enable Ethereum usage post-Shanghai both quicker and more cost-effective.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Despite 2022 being a rough period for many participants in the cryptocurrency market, be it in terms of prices, bankruptcies, high-profile arrests, or legal proceedings, the adoption of crypto nonetheless continued to increase, rising sharply throughout the year.\n\nAs it happens, the total number of global crypto owners grew by 39% in 2022, increasing from 306 million in January 2022 to 425 million in December of the same year, according to the new research report published by Crypto.com on January 19.\n\nTotal number of crypto owners in millions.

With the announced release of staked ETH in March 2023, it is likely that this interest will grow further.\n\nNumber and growth rate of Ethereum owners.

        "content": "UXD is gravitating toward the Ethereum ecosystem. In this situation and with this step, it will be in a position to utilize a variety of approaches through the Ethereum rollups, and also, with the adequate utilization of an interoperability solution, it will find itself in the position of being able to effectively connect with a lot more inclined users, leading to the obtaining of further liquidity.\n\nThere are some differences between UXD (Solana) and UXD (Ethereum, rollups) in this specific case scenario. In the case of the UXD (Ethereum, rollups), it happens to be ably supported by various approaches right through the Ethereum and rollups, with the correct usage of an interoperability solution. However, where the UXD (Solana) is concerned, there happen to be limitations with regards to being supported with approaches for Solana only.\n\nAt the present moment in time, the Solana team members are carrying out work on three approaches to Ethereum. The first happens to be the delta-neutral position on optimism. It will presumably be positioned on Perpetual Protocols. The second one uses Rage Trade\u2019s delta-neutral vault and is the delta-neutral position on Arbitrum. The third one, which is also the last, entails using the yield aggregators Beefy Finance on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Optimism. All of these strategies will help to bring the price of UXD to USD into a more reasonable range.\n\nIn the middle of Ethereum and rollups, UXD will also become completely fungible. Users can either mint or receive UXD back on Ethereum, rollups, and the chains that connect them. The fundamental situation in this case will be the application of LayerZero as an interoperability solution. The UXD Protocol will continue to focus on achieving minimal volatility and a higher yield.\n\nUXD Protocol is also going to be in the business of building a fresh governance token to be offered conventionally on Ethereum. Through this, users will become capable of connecting governance tokens with rollups, which in turn will open up cross-chain functions. The money made by the UXD Protocol on Ethereum and rollups will then be utilized to purchase the governance tokens.\n\nFinally, the governance token will be allotted to UXP (Solana) token holders. UXD on Ethereum and rollups need insurance funding in order to be able to balance probable losses coming from a variety of approaches. The proposal is to transfer $35 million USDC from Solana to Ethereum in order to stand up for UXD on Ethereum and many other rollups."
