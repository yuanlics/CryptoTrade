        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s latest update hasn\u2019t quite panned out as expected, according to JPMorgan Chase.\n\nA team of analysts at the bank, led by managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, said in a note late last week that although Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade in April made important changes to the network, the update has in other ways shown to be lackluster.\n\n\u201cThe Ethereum supply is shrinking and staking rose sharply (with the amount of ether staked up by 50% since the Shanghai upgrade),\u201d the note said, adding that \u201cthe increase in network activity has been rather disappointing.\u201d\n\nThe Shanghai update enabled users to withdraw staked Ether that was put up following last year\u2019s much-ballyhooed Merge, which reduced the blockchain\u2019s energy footprint by 99% by transitioning the network to proof of stake from the more energy-intensive proof of work.\n\nSince the Shanghai upgrade, daily transactions on Ethereum have fallen by 12%, while the number of daily active addresses and the total value locked on the network have dropped 20% and 8%, respectively, according to JPMorgan.\n\n\u201cWhile staking has jumped by 50% since the Shanghai upgrade, which helps to improve network security, the share of liquid staking protocols such as Lido remains uncomfortably high, raising questions about centralization,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nThe next major update to Ethereum is the planned EIP-4844 upgrade, also known as \u201cprotodanksharding,\u201d which is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year. It aims to allow Ethereum to process more data than it could previously.\n\nThe analysts wrote that they hoped this update would help turn the tide for activity on Ethereum, but \u201ccontinued bearish crypto forces remain a headwind.\u201d"

        "title": "Implement a CI/CD pipeline for Ethereum smart contract development on AWS \u2013 Part 2 | Amazon Web Services - AWS Blog",
        "content": "This post discusses the implementation details of an Ethereum smart contract CI/CD pipeline as outlined in a previous post, which is considered a prerequisite to the topics discussed in this post. Part 1 highlighted some of the challenges faced by a multi-developer team implementing a decentralized application (dApp) and how CI/CD can help address those challenges. Part 1 also provided an overview of all the AWS services needed to implement a CI/CD pipeline. In this post, we discuss those services in detail and the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) stack to install and configure those services.\n\nSolution overview\n\nThe AWS CDK code in this post is built on the solution architecture from Part 1, which is depicted in the following diagram.\n\nThe AWS CDK code is available in the AWS Sample GitHub repository. The README file in the GitHub repository has instructions on how to deploy the AWS CDK stack so it creates all the resources shown in the architecture. When you deploy the stack in your AWS account, after installing and configuring all the AWS services, it will also run the CI/CD pipeline.\n\nAWS CDK project code organization\n\nThe following screenshot shows how the AWS CDK project implementing our CI/CD pipeline is laid out.\n\nAll the AWS CDK constructs are defined in the cdk-stack.ts file. The three folders, DataSyncTaskExec , ECSTaskExec , and EFSManagement , contain AWS Lambda code that supports the AWS CDK custom resources in the cdk-stack.ts file. All the various configurations and .zip files needed in the stack are in the resources folder. ShareToWin-dApp has the implementation of a sample decentralized application and is used as a base application for the CI/CD pipeline. We discuss some of these files in detail later in this post.\n\nEthereum development network: Hyperledger Besu\n\nAs discussed in the first part of this series, an Ethereum development network allows an unlimited supply of Ethers for testing and debugging purposes and therefore is widely used during the development phase. To support a multi-developer team, this development network needs to be run on an infrastructure that allows multiple developers to connect to it. The sample CI/CD infrastructure discussed in this post uses Hyperledger Besu as the development network and is installed on AWS Fargate with Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) configured as the container volume. To support the Besu network, the sample AWS CDK stack creates an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster and defines a task definition that will run a single container of the Besu image. The following code is the ECS task definition construct that runs the Besu container:\n\nlet besuNetworkTaskDef = new ecs.FargateTaskDefinition(this, \"AMB-CICD-Blog-BesuNetworkTaskDef\", { cpu: 2048, executionRole: besuECSExecRole, family: \"AMB-CICD-Blog-BesuDevNetwork\", memoryLimitMiB: 4096, runtimePlatform: { operatingSystemFamily: ecs.OperatingSystemFamily.LINUX }, taskRole: besuECSExecRole, volumes: [ { name: \"EfsBesuNodeStorage\", efsVolumeConfiguration: { fileSystemId: elasticFileSys.fileSystemId, rootDirectory: \"/\", transitEncryption: \"ENABLED\", authorizationConfig: { accessPointId: efsBesuDirAccessPoint.accessPointId, iam: \"ENABLED\" } } } ] });\n\nThere are two configuration files, dev.json and config.toml , that Besu reads at the time of starting the Besu node. Both files are copied from Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to Amazon EFS by AWS DataSync. The following screenshot shows the AWS CDK construct of the Besu container.\n\nThe dev.json file, which is provided as the genesis file, creates 10 test Ethereum addresses. Its public and private keys are provided in the dev.json file. These addresses are based on a hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet and are the same addresses that are configured on the dApp. The AWS CDK project provides a mnemonic string that is used to generate these addresses. These addresses are included for convenience to experiment within this solution. The GitHub repository also provides a utility in the Mnemonic-Generator folder that randomly creates a new mnemonic phrase and 10 accounts with its public and private key pairs that you can use to create your own accounts. The README file of the GitHub repository has detailed steps of how to run this utility.\n\nNote: Do not use the mnemonic provided in the AWS CDK project or any public or private key derived from this mnemonic string in any production CI/CD pipeline you create using this solution. The mnemonics and addresses derived from them should solely be used for learning purposes in a development network where no real Ethers are associated with them.\n\nStoring mnemonics and other secrets\n\nThe CI/CD pipeline requires certain security-related parameters, like an Amazon Managed Blockchain billing token, mnemonic strings for the address generation to deploy to various Testnet and Mainnet networks, and access keys and secret keys for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication. These secrets are stored in AWS Secrets Manager and the AWS CDK stack creates the following construct for Secrets Manager:\n\nlet secMgrSecrets=new secretsmanager.Secret(this, \"AMB-CICD-Blog-Secrets\", { secretName: \"AMB-CICD-Blog-Secrets\", description: \"Captures all the secrets required by CodeBuild and ShareToWinLambda\", removalPolicy: cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY, secretObjectValue:{ \"/CodeBuild/BesuMnemonicString\":cdk.SecretValue.unsafePlainText(\"default mnemonic provided as part of the sample code\"), \"/CodeBuild/GeorliMnemonicString\":cdk.SecretValue.unsafePlainText(\"To be entered\"), \"/CodeBuild/MainnetMnemonicString\":cdk.SecretValue.unsafePlainText(\"To be entered\"), \"/CodeBuild/AccessKey\":cdk.SecretValue.unsafePlainText(\"To be entered\"), \"/CodeBuild/SecretKey\":cdk.SecretValue.unsafePlainText(\"To be entered\"), \"/CodeBuild/BillingTokenUrl\":cdk.SecretValue.unsafePlainText(\"To be entered\"), } });\n\nDo not use the preceding mnemonic for any purpose other than testing on development networks.\n\nIn the preceding code, only the mnemonics associated with the development network are provided; the rest of the secrets are left to be entered by the user after the AWS CDK stack is created. The AWS CDK resource only provides the placeholders for these secrets.\n\nS3 bucket\n\nThe AWS CDK stack creates a S3 bucket called amb-cicd-blog-s3bucket and copies all the files located in the resources/BucketFiles folder of the AWS CDK project on the GitHub repo. The files in the BucketFiles folder are as follows:\n\nBlockchainDevLayer.zip \u2013 This .zip file is used to create Lambda layer for the dependencies of Lambda that are part of the deployed dApp.\n\n\u2013 This .zip file is used to create Lambda layer for the dependencies of Lambda that are part of the deployed dApp. config.toml \u2013 This is the configuration file of the Besu node.\n\n\u2013 This is the configuration file of the Besu node. deploy.js \u2013 This file is needed to deploy the smart contract to Ethereum networks.\n\n\u2013 This file is needed to deploy the smart contract to Ethereum networks. dev.json \u2013 This is the genesis file of the Besu network.\n\n\u2013 This is the genesis file of the Besu network. hardhat.config.js \u2013 The CI/CD pipeline internally uses Hardhat to compile and deploy the smart contract. The networks of both Besu and Goerli are defined in this file.\n\n\u2013 The CI/CD pipeline internally uses Hardhat to compile and deploy the smart contract. The networks of both Besu and Goerli are defined in this file. ShareToWinLambda.zip \u2013 This .zip file contains the source code for the Lambda function that is created to support the dApp.\n\nCustom resource providers\n\nTo configure and run the Besu development network, the AWS CDK defines three custom resource providers. These providers are configured with Lambda functions to run at the time of creation, update, and deletion of the AWS CloudFormation stack.\n\nEFS folder creation\n\nThe Besu node requires a certain folder structure on the file system. After the EFS volume is created by the AWS CDK stack, Lambda functions defined in lib/EFSManagement folder are run that create the config and data folders on the EFS volume. The config folder contains the files that are needed at the time of running the Besu node, and the data folder contains the ledger database, key, and other files needed by the Besu node. The locations of both of these folders are provided as commands when the Besu node is started.\n\nFiles copied from Amazon S3 to Amazon EFS\n\nThe custRsrcDataSyncTaskLambdaExec custom resource is responsible for copying files from Amazon S3 to Amazon EFS via a DataSync task. The AWS CDK stack defines a DataSync task that has Amazon S3 as the source location and Amazon EFS as the destination location. The Lambda functions associated with this custom resource, located in lib/DataSyncTaskExec , run the DataSync task, which copies config.toml and dev.json files before the Besu node on the ECS cluster can be started.\n\nECS task to run Besu node\n\nThe Fargate task created by the AWS CDK stack that launches Besu node is started by a custom resource called custRsrcEcsTaskLambdaExec . Its associated Lambda functions are located in the lib/ECSTaskExec folder. The ECS task is started with the public IP enabled. This public IP is an output parameter of the AWS CDK stack and also is configured as an environment variable for other AWS CDK constructs that we discuss later.\n\nCode repository for the decentralized application\n\nThe GitHub repo of this post provides a sample dApp that is used as the basis for creating a CI/CD pipeline. This sample application consists of a smart contract AssetToken.sol in the ShareToWin-dApp/SmartContractCode/contracts folder and a Lambda function in the ShareToWin-dApp/LambdaCode/index.mjs file that invokes functions in the smart contract. This sample dApp is the same as discussed in Develop a Full Stack Serverless NFT Application with Amazon Managed Blockchain \u2013 Part 1.\n\nMultiple developers working on the same or different smart contracts are only required to upload their smart contract file (*.sol) to the contract folder in this repository. This way, they are free to use any IDE tool and extension of their choice in their local development environment and only push the unit tested .sol file to the GitHub repository to be integrated in the CI/CD pipeline. Developers should also add any npm dependencies of their smart contract in the project.json file of the smart contract code so the CI/CD can inject those dependencies at the time of building and deploying the smart contract.\n\nA .zip file containing all the code of the dApp is created and is stored in the resources/ShareToWinCode folder to make it available to the AWS CDK stack. The stack creates an AWS CodeCommit construct that creates a git repository and copies the smart contract code and the Lambda code in it. Any change in the smart contract code in this repository triggers the CI/CD pipeline.\n\nCodeBuild projects\n\nThe AWS CDK stack has two AWS CodeBuild projects defined, one for building and deploying the smart contract on the Besu development network, and the other for the Goerli network using Managed Blockchain. The buildspec files associated with these CodeBuild projects are located in the resources/StaticFiles folder. The buildspec file for the Besu CodeBuild project is called besubuildspec.yml , and the buildspec file for the Goerli CodeBuild project is called goerlibuildspec.yml . The following screenshot shows the code snippet of the besubuildspec.yml file, which we discuss in more detail.\n\nCodeBuild uses Hardhat to compile and deploy the smart contract. The choice of Hardhat is a personal preference and it can be easily replaced by Truffle or Foundry. It first gets the smart contract source code from the CodeCommit GitHub repo, then it installs all the npm packages that are listed as dependencies for the smart contract. It also installs all the required Hardhat packages that are needed to build and deploy the smart contract. Hardhat expects the various blockchain network that it needs to interact with in the hardhat.config.js file. This file is part of this AWS CDK project and is uploaded to Amazon S3 to be made available to CodeBuild. The following code in the buildspec file downloads these two files from Amazon S3 to be made available to the CodeBuild environment:\n\naws s3 cp s3://amb-cicd-blog-s3bucket/deploy.js . aws s3 cp s3://amb-cicd-blog-s3bucket/hardhat.config.js .\n\nThe following screenshot shows the various blockchain network configurations as defined in the hardhat.config.js file.\n\nThe next step in the build process is to compile and deploy the smart contract to the Besu network, which is accomplished by running the following two commands:\n\nnpx hardhat compile CONTRACTSADDRESS=$(npx hardhat run --network besudev deploy.js)\n\nAfter running these commands, the CodeBuild environment has access to both the newly deployed smart contract address as well as the smart contract\u2019s application binary interface (ABI) file that is generated as an output of the compilation command.\n\nThe next step in the build and deploy process is that CodeBuild runs test scripts that are provided in the smart contract code repository. If the test scripts fail, the entire build pipeline is rolled back and the pipeline is in a failed state.\n\nWhen the test script is successful, it takes the smart contract\u2019s ABI along with the Lambda code in the dApp Lambda repository and creates a new .zip file that is used to deploy a new version of the Lambda code. It also updates the dApp Lambda environment variable to point to the newly deployed smart contract address. The following code snippet shows how this is done in the buildspec file:\n\ncd .. && mkdir lambda-build && cd lambda-build cp ../SmartContractCode/artifacts/contracts/AssetToken.sol/AssetToken.json . cp ../LambdaCode/index.mjs . zip -r ShareToWinLambda.zip . aws lambda update-function-code --function-name AMB-CICD-Blog-ShareToWinLambda --zip-file fileb://ShareToWinLambda.zip aws lambda wait function-updated-v2 --function-name AMB-CICD-Blog-ShareToWinLambda aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name AMB-CICD-Blog-ShareToWinLambda --environment \"Variables={CONTRACTADDRESS=$CONTRACTSADDRESS\n\nAt this time, the CI/CD pipeline is in the manual approval stage. Before approving this stage, make sure the Managed Blockchain billing token URL and Goerli-related mnemonic string in Secrets Managers are updated; otherwise, the Goerli build project will fail because it can\u2019t retrieve these secrets.\n\nThis sample code uses the Managed Blockchain billing token to access the Ethereum node on Managed Blockchain. There are two ways to access the Managed Blockchain node: via the billing token or via SigV4. For more information about these methods, refer to Using token based access to make Ethereum API calls to Ethereum nodes in Amazon Managed Blockchain (AMB) and the video Connecting to an Ethereum node on Amazon Managed Blockchain.\n\nClean up\n\nTo terminate the resources that we created in this post, run the following:\n\ncdk destroy\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post, we expanded on Part 1 and discussed the implementation details of an Ethereum smart contract CI/CD pipeline. This entire CI/CD pipeline implementation is provided as an AWS CDK project and is available on GitHub.\n\nTry out the sample code and reach out to us with your feedback in the comments.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nRafia Tapia is a Blockchain Specialist Solution Architecture.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin deposited $630,000 worth of ETH into Coinbase.\n\nObservers are uncertain if transactions reflect a broader strategy or just portfolio management.\n\nCrypto market has been volatile recently.\n\nAny significant moves by key players can impact market dynamics.\n\nVitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, recently deposited a substantial amount of ETH, approximately $0.63 million, into Coinbase during a volatile crypto market. This move has left his intentions and strategy unclear, adding suspense to his cryptocurrency actions.\n\nButerin is one of the most well-known individuals in the cryptocurrency industry. While the cryptocurrency market struggles with unpredictability, Buterin\u2019s moves have generated interest and rumors.\n\nA Standard Transaction?\n\nData from the Ethereum blockchain scanning tool Etherscan show that Buterin made the most recent transfer into Coinbase on Monday, depositing 400 ETH worth approximately $630,000. Many in the crypto world are considering the consequences of this shift.\n\nMeanwhile, Buterin\u2019s ongoing cryptocurrency deposits follow a recent pattern of transactions, adding intrigue to his intentions. His wallet has seen significant ETH movements in the past week, leaving uncertainty about whether this is routine portfolio management or part of a larger strategy.\n\nLooking at Buterin\u2019s most recent transactions, the mystery surrounding his transfer activity intensifies. His wallet address delivered 300 ETH to Kraken, another well-known cryptocurrency exchange, in addition to the 400 ETH put on Coinbase. Additionally, 200 ETH moved from his wallet into USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar.\n\nPossible Consequences for the Crypto Market\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s recent actions are drawing significant attention, particularly in a volatile market. As an Ethereum co-founder, his moves can sway investor sentiment, yet his intentions remain unclear.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, saw a 3.5% drop last week amidst market turbulence. Key players\u2019 actions can profoundly impact the overall market narrative in such conditions.\n\nHis activities and transactions are being intently watched by market participants and enthusiasts who are trying to determine how they might affect Ethereum and the larger cryptocurrency market.\n\nIn a recent interview , Buterin mentioned that Ethereum might be better equipped to resist government intervention, especially with the current implementation of a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nButerin clarified that proof-of-stake offers better anonymity and resistance to shutdown attempts than proof-of-work. He pointed out that proof-of-work relies on extensive physical infrastructure and high energy consumption, areas where law enforcement has experience in detection.\n\nIn the midst of market turmoil, Buterin\u2019s recent transactions have sparked interest in the crypto community. Ethereum\u2019s one-day trading volume surged to $4.7 billion, while its price dipped by 0.6% to $1,630.61 at the time of writing, all while his intentions and strategies remain uncertain.\n\nHacked Twitter Account Results in Theft Of $700K\n\nA cyber attacker successfully breached Vitalik Buterin\u2019s official X account, resulting in a loss exceeding $690,000, as detailed by blockchain investigator ZachXBT.\n\nThe hacking method involved compromising Buterin\u2019s account and posting on his behalf, marking the introduction of Proto-Danksharding to the Ethereum platform.\n\nIn a now-infamous post, Buterin shared his intentions to release a series of commemorative NFTs from ConsenSys. Regrettably, the post included a malicious URL and was sent to his 4.9 million followers, resulting in some falling victim to the deception."

Ethereum\u2019s recent narrow trading range has resulted in persistently negative funding rates, fostering a pessimistic outlook as traders brace for potential ETH price drops.\n\nNotably, \u201cGreatest Trader\u201d a pseudonymous analyst with popular crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant emphasized this trend in a post shared by the firm today.\n\nThe Potential for a Short Squeeze\n\nWhile prolonged periods of negative funding rates typically suggest a bearish market, they can also set the stage for a short squeeze, or a scenario where short sellers are forced to buy back their positions to cover their losses, resulting in a sudden price rebound. \u201cGreatest Trader\u201d further underscored the likelihood of such a sequence, explaining, \u201cConsistent negative funding rates bear the potential to initiate a chain reaction of short liquidations, which, in turn, could catalyze an abrupt price rebound.\u201d\n\nWhales and Traditional Investors Prepare for Volatility\n\nIn a related development, Ethereum options on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) have hit a record high of $352 million in open interest, signalling a spike in interest from traditional investors. This coincides with rising expectations of an Ethereum futures Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approval scheduled for next week.\n\nThis surge in open interest indicates investor positioning for a potential bullish outcome, with data from Santiment showing Ethereum whales holding between 100,000 ETH and 1,000,000 ETH accumulating just over 1 million ETH after the September 11 price dip. Afterwards, the cryptocurrency witnessed a noteworthy uptick indicating significant accumulation by big investors.\n\nAt press time, Ethereum price was trading at $1,574 after a 1.19% drop over the past 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap data."

        "title": "Number Of Ethereum Addresses Losing Money Just Reached A New All-Time High - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum holders have been subject to uncertainty over the last few months as bulls and bears have struggled for control. With the bears winning at a much higher rate than the bulls, Ethereum holders have found their holdings have continued to lose value. This time around, the plunge has sent the number of investors losing money to a new all-time high.\n\nNumber Of Ethereum Addresses In Loss At ATH\n\nOn-chain data tracker Glassnode Alerts on X (formerly Twitter) has revealed a shocking development regarding Ethereum addresses. According to the tracker, the number of addresses seeing losses on a 7-day moving average (MA) has jumped to its highest level ever.\n\nThis metric takes note of the price at which the ETH coins being held on addresses were last moved. Then it is compared to the current price of the altcoin to figure out if the addresses are seeing gains or losses. The metric had been rapidly climbing in 2023 due to the bear market, culminating in a new all-time high.\n\nAccording to Glassnode\u2019s report, the total number of addresses in loss is now sitting at 49,939,211.006, rising from its previous all-time high of 49,921,736.464 that was reached on September 15. If the price of ETH continues to drop, then this figure will likely hit another all-time high soon.\n\nNumber of addresses in loss hit new all-time high Source: Glassnode\n\nOther ETH Metrics Flashing Bearish\n\nEthereum\u2019s open interest in perpetual futures contracts had also taken a hit with the price struggles. It dropped to a one-month low $445,789,354, just weeks after hitting a previous one-month low of $450,965,900 on September 13.\n\nAccumulation also seems to be dropping among mid-sized investors in the meantime. Glassnode also reports that the number of addresses holding at least 10 ETH had plunged to a 3-month low of 347,825. This suggests that these investors may be offloading their holdings to prevent more losses.\n\nSmall investors are also not left out of this trend. Another metric that tracks the number of Ethereum addresses holding at least 0.1 ETH also showed a decline in recent months. This has led to a 5-month low for the metric, with only 5,120,950 addresses holding 0.1+ ETH.\n\nThese declines come as no surprise as the ETH price had lost support above $1,600. With the bears dragging the price below $1,600, the losses for holders had climbed rapidly as the altcoin\u2019s price fell to two-week lows.\n\nFounder Vitalik Buterin had also made transactions carrying a significant amount of ETH toward centralized exchanges. This has sparked speculations that the founder is selling, which in turn could influence investors to sell as well.\n\nETH bears take control of price | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Blockchair, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nPrices of leading cryptocurrencies stayed stable over the last seven days. Market leader Bitcoin (BTC) held the fort at $26,569, more or less exactly the same price as last week, while Ethereum (ETH) dropped a slight 2.8% to trade for $1,592.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt was another of crypto\u2019s relatively less volatile weeks, which seem to be occurring more frequently this year. There were no major price swings among any of the forty biggest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization\u2014except for Chainlink.\n\nHolders of LINK found their stashes swell by 12% this week to hit $7 on Saturday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Toncoin (TON) was posting seven-day gains of 31%, but the coin\u2019s rapid rally\u2014which ran for just over a week on news that parent company Telegram had integrated a TON self-custodial wallet into the messaging app\u2014appears to have cooled off by the weekend.\n\nToncoin enters Saturday just 3.7% up at $2.33.\n\nAdoption news\n\nThis week\u2019s Fed policy meeting concluded with no new interest rate hikes, positively contributing to stabilizing crypto prices. The more difficult it is to borrow, the more people offload speculative assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThere were more headlines indicating that global crypto adoption is continuing apace.\n\nOn Monday, banking giant Citigroup launched a digital token service utilizing blockchain and smart contract technology to facilitate rapid cross-border payments between institutions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Wednesday, PayPal announced that Venmo users will be able to purchase the payments giant\u2019s dollar-pegged Ethereum-based stablecoin PYUSD \u201cin the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nPolitics\n\nThere were also several political developments with regard to crypto this week.\n\nThe former chair of the leading British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), confessed at a conference on Tuesday that during his tenure (2018\u20132022), the FCA faced \u201cpolitical pressure\u201d to accept several of the 43 firms currently approved to offer crypto services in the UK. He further said that \u201call the evidence\u201d suggested that it \u201cwasn\u2019t a very good idea.\u201d\n\nLater in the week, the FCA publicly urged British crypto companies to register with existing financial promotions legislation. All companies promoting crypto in the UK, whether based in the territory or not, have to make an application and pay a fee to get approved or promote their services through approved parties.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned by the poor engagement from many unregistered, overseas crypto asset firms who have U.K. customers on this important change,\u201d the FCA wrote in its statement.\n\nIn the States on Wednesday, the House Financial Services Committee (HFSC) passed the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, laying the groundwork for a future vote on the legislation on the House floor.\n\nProposed by crypto-friendly Congressman Tom Emmer (R-MN), the legislation hopes to block the Federal Reserve from issuing a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to individuals. Emmer has called CBDCs \u201cfinancial surveillance tools.\u201d Presidential candidates Ron DeSantis and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have opposed CBDCs for similar reasons."

Since the Shapella upgrade of the Ethereum network, users can stake and unstake their ether (ETH) at will, significantly de-risking staked ETH from a liquidity standpoint. This has been reflected in the staked ether, or stETH, discount to ETH, barely dipping past 30 bps since Ethereum\u2019s last major upgrade. Before the Shapella upgrade, stETH was a poor collateral asset due to its illiquidity and discount volatility. Now that stETH has been derisked, we have seen it overtake ETH as the primary collateral asset throughout DeFi."

        "content": "The Ethereum blockchain is notable for its smart contract functionality and various other things. However, many might not be conversant with the challenges the network encounters. In a recent interview, Ethereum\u2019s founder, Vitalik Buterin, revealed the biggest of them all.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Biggest Challenge\n\nSpeaking with CNBC, Buterin mentioned that the biggest challenge that the \u201cEthereum ecosystem\u201d faces is ensuring that it builds products that provide value to its users. According to him, the last decade was test-running, but now Ethereum needs to provide utility.\n\nEthereum is known to host some of the biggest decentralized applications (dApps), including prominent decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap, Curve Finance, and Sushiswap. The network has also grown massively to the extent that several Ethereum layer-2 networks have sprung up in a bid to scale the network.\n\nDespite this, it seems that Buterin believes that there is more to be done, even as Ethereum has asserted itself as the go-to network for dApps and other decentralized solutions. Meanwhile, ETH, its native token, is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nButerin also spoke about how cryptocurrencies enjoy greater use in less-developed countries as people use crypto tokens to make payments and for savings.\n\nCryptocurrencies have long been touted as a hedge against inflation, and it would seem that crypto is being put to use where it is needed most. A recent report by Chainalysis showed that the highest-ranked countries for crypto adoption are being plagued with a devaluing fiat currency.\n\nThe Ethereum founder also stated that centralized entities like Binance need to take a back seat for crypto adoption to move forward. While he appreciates these entities\u2019 role in growing the crypto industry, he believes crypto needs to become more decentralized.\n\nHis reason for saying this isn\u2019t far-fetched as he noted that these entities are vulnerable to \u201cboth pressure from the outside and to themselves being corrupted.\u201d Truly, centralized entities have taken many hits this past year, which has had far-reaching consequences on the industry.\n\nLast year, one of the biggest crypto exchanges, FTX, collapsed, which had several ripple effects on the crypto industry and market. Meanwhile, the two largest crypto exchanges by trading volume, Binance, and Coinbase, are currently embroiled in legal battles against the SEC.\n\nETH price sits at $1,578 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nThe Future Of Ethereum\n\nLast year, Ethereum transitioned from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake following the Merge. Buterin stated this move has made the network more decentralized as it is \u201charder to shut down\u201d than a proof-of-work network.\n\nHe also banished the idea that the network was heavily reliant on him, which many had identified as a weakness as the government could easily go after him to clamp down on the network.\n\nRelated Reading: What The Drop In Spot And Derivatives Volumes Means For The Price Of Bitcoin\n\nAccording to him, Ethereum has grown to become independent of him and the Ethereum Foundation. He points out how several independent applications on the blockchain have taken the workload off him and made the network more autonomous.\n\nAs to Ethereum\u2019s future plans and projects, he said that the network is focused on privacy and scaling with the help of zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups. ZK rollups are layer-2 scaling solutions that help scale the Ethereum network by moving computation off-chain, thereby reducing the computing workload on the network. It also promotes privacy, as one can verify transactions without knowing what it is about.\n\nFeatured image from Bloomberg, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Moreover, recent transactions involving his ETH holdings have added intrigue to his cryptocurrency movements.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s Strategic Cryptocurrency Moves Amid Market Uncertainty\n\nVitalik Buterin, one of the most prominent figures in the cryptocurrency space, has taken significant steps involving his cryptocurrency holdings recently. While the crypto market grapples with uncertainty, Buterin\u2019s actions have drawn attention and speculation.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAccording to data sourced from the Ethereum blockchain scanning platform Etherscan, Buterin deposited 400 ETH, valued at around $0.63 million, into Coinbase in the latest move on Monday. This transfer has left many in the crypto community pondering its implications.\n\nMeanwhile, the deposit follows a recent trend of Buterin\u2019s cryptocurrency transfers, further fueling curiosity about his strategies and intentions. Over the past week, his wallet address saw multiple transactions involving substantial amounts of ETH. This pattern raises questions about whether these moves are part of a larger strategy or merely portfolio management.\n\nThe intrigue surrounding Buterin\u2019s transfer activities deepens when we consider his recent transactions.

        "content": "Data shows the Ethereum funding rates have been quite negative in recent days. Here\u2019s what this could mean for the cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nEthereum Funding Rates Have Been Under The Zero Mark Recently\n\nAs explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, a short squeeze may be a possibility for the asset currently. The \u201cfunding rate\u201d is an indicator that keeps track of the periodic fees that traders on the futures market are exchanging with each other.\n\nWhen the value of this metric is positive, it means that the long contract holders are paying a premium to the short holders right now. Such a trend implies the longs outweigh the shorts currently, and hence, a bullish mentality is the dominant force in the sector.\n\nOn the other hand, negative values suggest the majority of the futures market users share a bearish sentiment at the moment as the shorts are the ones paying a fee.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum funding rates over the past week:\n\nLooks like the value of the metric has been quite negative in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nAs displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum funding rates had been positive until just a couple of days back, implying that the majority of the futures traders had been betting on the asset\u2019s price to go up.\n\nThe metric\u2019s value has plunged to the negative zone during the past day or so, however, suggesting that a complete flip in mentality has occurred among the investors.\n\nThis bearish sentiment, though, may not necessarily be bad for the price. This is because the more the mentality has become skewed in one direction historically, the more probable the price of the cryptocurrency has become to show a sharp move in the opposite direction.\n\nOne major reason why this happens is that mass liquidation events, which are popularly called \u201csqueezes,\u201d are more likely to involve the dominant side of the futures market.\n\nDuring a squeeze, a sudden swing in the price ends up liquidating a large amount of contracts at once. Such liquidations only provide fuel for the price move that caused them, thus amplifying it further. This can lead to a cascade of more liquidations.\n\nAs shorts have piled up in the Ethereum futures market recently, the probability of a short squeeze occurring would be elevated. Naturally, if such an event does take place, the asset\u2019s value could see a sharp rebound.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t necessarily have to happen, of course, and if it does, it may not be soon. From the chart, it\u2019s visible that the funding rate had remained at notable positive values for a while before the ETH price finally registered its plunge.\n\nETH Price\n\nEthereum has taken a hit of more than 3% during the past week as the asset\u2019s price is now trading under the $1,600 level.\n\nETH has gone down in the last few days | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price could attempt a move to the 50% retracement level, between the $28,208 and $28,815 range.\n\nEthereum price coils up for a move north and could test the $1,650 resistance level in a 5% climb.\n\nRipple price deliberates the next move after rejection from the mean threshold at $0.5337; the odds still favor bulls.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is pushing north, but the headwinds continue to oppose the recovery rally. However, the odds still favor the upside, though only narrowly. On the other side, Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) investors and traders have a lot going on with both price actions leaving longs and shorts a lot to ponder over. Generally, the market has a lot to decipher, with a quick rally in the cards, according to experts.\n\nAlso Read: Week Ahead: No ETFs, but crypto markets might be preparing for a quick rally ahead of Powell's speech\n\nBitcoin price could test the 50% Fib\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is in an overall uptrend, in what appears to be a recovery rally, with the $26,000 psychological level holding forte for the flagship crypto even as profit takers engage the load-shedding gear. Increased buying pressure above this level could send BTC north, confronting the resistance confluence between the 200- and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) at around 26,933, before heading up to the 100-day EMA at $26,962.\n\nHowever, it would take more than just buying pressure to drive Bitcoin price north, considering the low volatility in the market. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) moving north, momentum is growing. With such bullish interest, BTC bulls could launch a subsequent attack at the range limit presented by the EMAs before the next breakout.\n\nTraders must also put off their profit-taking appetite, with a confirmed break and close above the $27,771 likely to fuel optimism that could send BTC to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level around the $28,208 to $28,215 range.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, selling pressure from the supplier congestion zones indicated by the EMAs could extend the downtrend for Bitcoin price, with a likely retest of the $25,613 range. In the dire case, the slump could extrapolate to the $25,100 support level, last tested during mid-June. Such a move would constitute a 5% slide.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price action culls $30 million longs ahead of Fed Chairman speech\n\nEthereum price could make a move north\n\nEthereum (ETH) price appears due for a move north, supported by the promising outlook of the RSI, which is about to signal a call to buy as its edges closer to the signal line (yellow band) in the rising trajectory.\n\nTraders heeding this call could send Ethereum price north, likely to the $1,650 resistance level. In a highly bullish case, the gains could extend to the 50-day EMA at $1,672. Such a move would constitute a 5% ascent above the current level.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flip side, profit-taking could send Ethereum price back towards $1,551 or lower to collect the sell-side liquidity resting underneath.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum whales prepare ahead of futures Ethereum ETF approval on October 2\n\nRipple price rejected from the supply zone\n\nRipple (XRP) price was rejected from the mean threshold of the supply zone order block at $5,337. This was expected, considering the zone is characterized by aggressive selling. With the 50-, 100- and 200-day EMAs at $0.5300, 0.5468, and 0.5391, all resting within the supply zone, the bears have the advantage.\n\nHowever, the RSI is showing rising momentum, while the Parabolic SAR continues to track XRP from below, acting as support at $0.4760. These are both bullish indicators, likely to give Ethereum price the pivot for its move north.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nIn the same way, the token has been recording lower highs and lower lows, indicating growing seller momentum. This could see ETH break below $0.4191 or in the dire case, send ETH below the $0.4600 to tag to mid-July.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple Price Forecast: Declining network growth and underwater XRP holders suggest more downside for XRP price"

        "content": "In a recent disclosure, Steven Nerayoff, a former Ethereum advisor known for his insightful statements, has provided some clarity on the speculation surrounding Vitalik Buterin's past interest in Ripple and XRP. The community has long wondered whether Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, had a genuine fascination with Ripple.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis talk follows earlier comments by Matt Hamilton, the former director of developer relations at Ripple, who revealed that Buterin had sought an internship opportunity at Ripple and had even slept on the couch of the company's CTO, David Schwartz.\n\nNerayoff, who had conversations with Buterin, shared some insights into Buterin's thought process. He mentioned that Buterin had once expressed a desire to implement smart contracts on the Bitcoin network. However, his proposal was met with resistance from developers, which may have led him to explore other blockchain projects.\n\nRegarding Ripple, Nerayoff explained that his discussions with Buterin about the company were based on his encounters with Ripple representatives, whom he himself viewed as exemplars of effective operational practices within the blockchain industry.\n\nNo idea. He told me he wanted to implement smart contracts on Bitcoin but the devs didn\u2019t want it. I spoke to him about Ripple but that was bc I had met the Ripple folks and used them as an example of how a company should be operated in this space. Ripple has been following me\u2026 \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) September 23, 2023\n\nNerayoff also recalled an incident from 2015 when he attended a conference where he encountered Chris Larson, a co-founder of Ripple, and another member of the Ripple team. During this event, questions related to XRP were directed to only one specific individual within the organization.\n\nNerayoff's insights have reignited the debate surrounding Vitalik Buterin's true interests and intentions during his interactions with Ripple. The question remains: Did Ethereum founder harbor a genuine interest in Ripple and XRP, or were there more nuanced factors at play behind the scenes?"

        "content": "Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion.\n\nEthereum has a bearish market structure across multiple timeframes.\n\nThe psychological support level at $1500 could face a retest in the coming weeks.\n\nEthereum [ETH] has been in a rough spot on the price charts since early August when the price slipped below the $1850 level. The trend pointed downward even on the higher timeframe price charts and the buyers could have a torrid time correcting this course.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nReports that the SEC acknowledged review of the Ethereum ETF applications from VanEck and Ark Invest was a positive development in the long run. The falling transaction fees were also a talking point as the network could enter a phase of inflation.\n\nThe bearish structure would likely see ETH fall to $1500\n\nThe 1-day price chart above showcased Ethereum forming a series of lower highs and lower lows since early August. This characterized a downtrend. The Fibonacci retracement levels from mid-March showed that the $1533 level was the 78.6% retracement level.\n\nIt was tested as support on 11 September, and consequently, ETH bounced to the $1663 resistance. The bulls met with failure at that level and took losses over the past few days. As a result, the market structure was bearish on the lower timeframe charts such as 4-hour.\n\nThe RSI has been below neutral 50 on the daily chart since mid-July and signaled a downtrend in progress. The OBV has also shown no intent of breaking its downtrend from June, which meant buying pressure remained weak.\n\nHence, even though the $1533 was technically significant and was close to the $1500 psychological support, buying ETH in that region could be risky.\n\nThe metrics showed recovery was possible but is another wave of selling imminent?\n\nThe mean coin age took a large hit on 11 September as holders exited the market in large numbers. It had been in an uptrend since June and resumed its upward trajectory over the past two weeks.\n\nThis showed an accumulation of the token across the network. The MVRV ratio was negative and showed the token was likely undervalued.\n\nHow much are 1, 10, or 100 ETH worth today?\n\nThese findings were encouraging for buyers but the exchange flow balance metric saw a large spike on 23 September, Saturday. The positive spike conveyed 65.4k ETH tokens arriving in exchange wallets, amounting to $100 million.\n\nWhile every such spike does not mean a sell-off will occur within a week, it was strong evidence that ETH could post further losses on the price chart. Therefore the $1500 support level could see a retest."

        "content": "After rising above $1,600 and staying above this level since September 12 reaching out toward $1,670, the Etherum price finally dropped on Wednesday, September 20. The drop came after the coin spent several days fluctuating between $1,550 and $1,670, its primary resistance preventing it from going up to $1700.\n\nAs the price dropped, it encountered support at around $1,575, briefly stopping the coin from sinking. However, the selling pressure was too intense, and the coin did not bounce back up. Instead, the bearish wave pushed further down, sending it to $1,570.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $1,578, down 0.8% on the day. Ether\u2019s trading activity has increased significantly over the last 24 hours, rising by 108% to $4 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nOn the weekly timeframe, ETH remains bearish after dropping 2.75% over the last seven days. It is also down 4.5% and 11% over the last 30 days and six months respectively.\n\nAs a result of the losses, altcoin\u2019s 14-week RSI fell to the support level at 38. The price strength is 40, and experts believe it will reach 30. If this happens, chances are good that ETH will see an additional price drop that might take it below $1,500 toward $1,200.\n\nETH/USD Weekly Chart\n\nIt is worth noting that some believe that this is an excellent opportunity to take a long position. This is supported by the bullish SuperTrend indicator. This trend-following chart overlay indicator is still green after turning bullish and moving below the price in April. As long as this indicator continues to trail the price, the largest altcoin by market capitalization will remain bullish on the weekly timeframe.\n\nAs such, if ETH manages to breach the current resistance and move up to the one sitting around between $16,44 and $1,774, embraced by the 100-weekly Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the 50-weekly SMA respectively.\n\nOvercoming this level would see Ethereum rise above the $2,000 psychological level to reach the optimistic target of a symmetrical triangle at $2,050. This would represent a 30% ascent from the current price.\n\nThis positive narrative is also supported by on-chain data from blockchain analytics platform Santiment which said that the odds are good that Ethereum will soon bounce back. According to the company, one factor could make this happen. The platform noted that Ethereum\u2019s network fees had dropped to its lowest levels this year.\n\n\u201cEthereum network fees have dropped down to its lowest level of 2023, at just $1.15 per transaction.
