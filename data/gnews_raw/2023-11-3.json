        "title": "Bitcoin's Golden Cross, Ethereum's And Dogecoin's Bellwether Indicator: A Look At Cryptos Into The Weekend - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) were trading relatively flat during Friday\u2019s trading session on lower-than-average volume despite the general market surging following the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision Wednesday to hold interest rates steady.\n\nThe three popular cryptos have been consolidating since Oct. 24, after Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin surged on hopes the Security and Exchange Commission is close to approving a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nFrom a technical analysis standpoint, the cryptos have been consolidating near highly important technical levels, with Bitcoin trading under strong resistance at the $36,000 mark and Ethereum and Dogecoin moving horizontally above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA).\n\nThe 200-day SMA is an important bellwether. Technical traders and investors consider a stock trading above the level on the daily chart to be in a bull cycle, whereas a stock trading under the 200-day SMA is considered to be in a bear cycle.\n\nThe 50-day SMA also plays an important role in technical analysis, especially when paired with the 200-day. When the 50-day SMA crosses below the 200-day SMA, a death cross occurs whereas when the 50-day SMA crosses above the 200-day, a bullish golden cross takes place.\n\nWant direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial.\n\nThe Bitcoin Chart: Bitcoin has been consolidating sideways on lower-than-average volume, while rejecting the important $36,000 mark on each attempt. The consolidation has been taking place on declining volume, which is often followed by a burst in high volume.\n\nThe sideways consolidation is helping to lower Bitcoin\u2019s relative strength index (RSI), which has been trading above the 70% level since Oct. 19. When a stock\u2019s or crypto\u2019s RSI is above 70%, it\u2019s considered to be overbought, which can be a sell signal for technical traders.\n\nBullish traders want to see Bitcoin\u2019s RSI continue to lower and then for big bearish volume to come in and break the crypto up through $36,000, which could accelerate a move to the upside toward $40,000. Bearish traders want to see big bearish volume come in and break Bitcoin down below the eight-day exponential moving average, which would negate the crypto\u2019s current uptrend.\n\nIt should be noted that a golden cross, which occurs when the 50-day SMA crosses above the 200-day, formed on Bitcoin\u2019s chart on Oct. 29, which suggests the crypto is in a strong bull cycle.\n\nBitcoin has resistance above at $35,593 and at $38,105 and support below at $31,862 and at $31,418.\n\nThe Ethereum and Dogecoin Charts: Ethereum and Dogecoin have been consolidating sideways near the 200-day SMA, with Ethereum trading sideways above that area and Dogecoin under it. Both Ethereum and Dogecoin have been consolidating near the 200-day on decreasing volume, which like Bitcoin, indicates a larger move in one direction is on the horizon.\n\nWhile Ethereum is trading in an uptrend within its consolidating pattern, Dogecoin is trading in a tightening range, forming a triangle formation. If the cryptos break bullishly from their respective patterns, a more powerful move to the upside could be in the cards.\n\nBearish traders want to see Ethereum break down under the 200-day SMA and for Dogecoin to break down from the lower ascending trendline of the triangle. If either of those two things happens, downside pressure is likely to accelerate.\n\nEthereum has resistance above at $1,825 and at $1,937 and support below at $1,717 and at $1,615.\n\nDogecoin has resistance above at $0.069 and at $0.075 and support below at $0.065 and at $0.061.\n\nRead Next: Jack Dorsey's Block And Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy Are Both Big On Bitcoin \u2014 But Here's The Real Winner - MicroStrategy\n\n\u00a9 2023 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Below $2,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Despite being up nearly 50% for the year, Ethereum (ETH 1.80%) seems to have fallen out of favor with investors. While other cryptos have been soaring in value of late, Ethereum has not. Currently trading at just under $1,800, Ethereum has repeatedly failed to surge past the $2,000 price mark this year and is now significantly underperforming Bitcoin (BTC 4.25%).\n\nAll of which makes Ethereum an intriguing investment right now. It's still the second-largest digital asset in the world (trailing only Bitcoin), and there are at least two good reasons Ethereum's price could start to move upward as we head into 2024.\n\nThe clear market leader\n\nFirst and foremost, Ethereum is still the 800-pound gorilla of the blockchain world. Ever since it pioneered the concept of smart contracts back in 2015, Ethereum has consistently been the first to market with just about every new blockchain innovation. And that has given Ethereum an enviable first-mover advantage in key areas such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nIn both areas, Ethereum is still the clear leader. For example, Ethereum is responsible for an eye-popping 54% of total value locked (TVL), arguably the single-best metric for measuring overall DeFi strength. No other blockchain even comes close.\n\nUntil rival blockchains, such as Solana or Avalanche, begin to chip away at Ethereum's market dominance at a faster pace, it's safe to say Ethereum will remain entrenched as the premier Layer 1 blockchain in the world. And that's exactly what I'm looking for in a long-term investment prospect: a clear market leader with an established track record of excellence.\n\nContinuous cycle of improvement\n\nEthereum's success to date has not been an accident. Ethereum boasts the largest developer network in the world, and these developers are highly focused on maintaining Ethereum's market-leading position. Case in point: Last year, Ethereum pulled off The Merge, one of the most difficult and complex technical achievements ever in the blockchain world. Some compared its difficulty to that of changing the engine of an airplane while mid-flight.\n\nWhat makes Ethereum particularly enticing to long-term investors is that it has a very detailed roadmap for future development. Even after The Merge, Ethereum has plans for new technical changes to its blockchain to boost performance, lower fees, and improve overall scalability. The next major upgrade (known as Dencun) is now tentatively scheduled for the first quarter of 2024 and has already received plaudits from Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs.\n\nWhy has Ethereum fallen out of favor?\n\nSo the obvious question becomes, \"If Ethereum is so great, why has it fallen out of favor with investors?\" While there are several possible explanations, the most likely is that The Merge may have over-promised and under-delivered. There was so much buzz and speculation surrounding The Merge that it couldn't possibly live up to the hype.\n\nInvestors woke up the next day to find that nothing really seemed to have changed with the Ethereum blockchain. Transaction processing times were faster but only marginally so. Transaction fees were still high, and there were still pressing questions about the future of staking on the blockchain (something Ethereum fixed in April). On top of all that, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin himself acknowledged that a lot of work still had to be done. So, The Merge wasn't some kind of magic rocket fuel that was going to send Ethereum soaring. That lack of immediate sizzle certainly disappointed a lot of investors.\n\nAdd in that many of the blockchain sectors that initially generated a lot of buzz for Ethereum -- such as NFTs and the metaverse -- fell out of favor with users, developers, and investors in 2022. And don't forget, the unprecedented rise of ChatGPT out of seemingly nowhere late last year led to a tremendous swing in investor sentiment. Suddenly, generative artificial intelligence (AI) became the talk of the investment world, and Ethereum admittedly didn't have much to offer in this regard.\n\nInvest in Ethereum for the long haul?\n\nFrom my perspective, Ethereum remains a great long-term investment play. Right now, investor sentiment seems to be at a low point, but that could change soon. Buying Ethereum now, while it's still below $2,000, seems like a fantastic bargain. You're getting a proven market leader at a discount price, combined with a potential catalyst (the new Dencun tech upgrade) to start off the New Year with a bang."

        "content": "The assets in question were traced back to Christopher Castelluzo, who conducted narcotic operations from 2010 to 2015. While his illicit activities began in 2010, Castelluzo only transitioned to using Bitcoin (BTC) for narcotic transactions on darknets in 2013.\n\nCastelluzzo is currently serving concurrent 20-year federal and state prison sentences for drug distribution convictions.\n\n30k ETH bought at ICO\n\nWhat is particularly noteworthy is that Castelluzo initially acquired the 30,000 ETH during its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in July 2014, using 15 BTC stemming from his illegal narcotics business. At the time, the 30,000 ETH was worth a mere $9,000, but its current value has surged to more than $54 million as of press time.\n\nIn addition to Ethereum, Castelluzo also obtained 30,000 Ethereum Classic (ETC) in 2016, which he used to acquire other cryptocurrencies.\n\nSubsequent to his arrest and incarceration, Castelluzzo attempted to launder the 30,000 ETH while in prison. However, U.S. authorities foiled this scheme by intercepting recorded prison telephone calls in 2021, ultimately leading to the seizure of the assets.\n\nU.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger stated:\n\n\u201cThe civil action we are taking today seeks to recover millions of dollars of cryptocurrency, which the defendant allegedly obtained from drug sales. Whether it\u2019s as simple as bags of cash or as sophisticated as cryptocurrency, we will take the steps necessary to seize financial gains defendants obtain from criminal activity.\u201d\n\nJames E. Dennehy, the FBI Special Agent overseeing the case, emphasized that the forfeiture action serves as a warning to others involved in criminal activities. He added that the government is committed to holding criminals accountable for their actions."

        "content": "Ethereum price corrected lower from the $1,875 zone against the US dollar. ETH retested the $1,780 zone and might soon attempt a fresh surge.\n\nEthereum holds the key support at $1,780 and $1,750.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,820 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a steep bearish trend line with resistance near $1,795 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start a fresh increase toward the $1,850 and $1,875 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Revisits Uptrend Support\n\nEthereum attempted a fresh increase above the $1,850 resistance but upsides were limited, like Bitcoin. ETH traded as high as $1,874 and recently started a downside correction.\n\nThere was a move below the $1,850 and $1,820 levels. The price even spiked below the $1,800 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It retested the $1,780 support zone. A low is formed near $1,777 and the price is now attempting another increase.\n\nThere was a break above a steep bearish trend line with resistance near $1,795 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum is now trading near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $1,874 swing high to the $1,777 low.\n\nOn the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $1,810 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The first major resistance sits at $1,825 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $1,874 swing high to the $1,777 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIf ETH surpasses the $1,825 resistance, it could again start a steady increase and test $1,875. The next key resistance is near $1,920, above which the price could accelerate higher toward the $2,0000 level. Any more gains might call for a move toward the $2,050 level.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,825 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,780 level or the recent low.\n\nThe next key support is $1,750. A downside break below the $1,750 support might spark a bearish wave. In the stated case, Ether could drop toward the $1,650 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,780\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,825\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH), has seen a surge in exchange outflows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock, $210 million worth of ETH left centralized exchanges (CEXs) in the week, representing the highest seven-day net outflows since August.\n\nExchange outflows often suggest that investors are transferring assets from centralized exchanges to private wallets.\n\nThis week, $210M worth of ETH left CEXs, the largest 7-day net outflows since August. pic.twitter.com/frYWasXvwZ \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) November 3, 2023\n\nOne of the most popular explanations for rising exchange outflows is that long-term investors are withdrawing assets to retain them for a longer period. This can be interpreted as a sign of confidence in the cryptocurrency's long-term potential.\n\nThe surge in exchange outflows has ignited speculation about the price of Ethereum. Many are wondering if this bullish trend will lead to a recovery and maybe boost the price of ETH.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was up 1.57% in the last 24 hours to $1,836.\n\nOn-chain analytics firm Santiment believes ETH's rise above $1,800 was aided by network growth and exchange outflows. It states that if the long-term trend of network growth continues and exchange outflows are sustained, ETH might have the justification to cross $2,000 again.\n\nEthereum volumes are on rise\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock, the weekly value of assets settled on Ethereum (including ETH, stablecoins and the top 50 tokens) reached its highest level since the SVB crash in March.\n\nThe volume settled last week on Ethereum surpassed $213 billion on the mainnet alone, with an additional $16 billion being transacted between Arbitrum, Optimism and Base.\n\nThe increasing amount of volume settled on-chain might show that fundamentals are improving.\n\nThough market prices may see a short-term correction, improved on-chain activity and increased spot-driven inflows indicate that strong demand is driving crypto's advance."

With the Fed\u2019s decisions having a major impact on the crypto market, the stakes are high for altcoins like Ethereum and Cardano.\n\nWill Ethereum\u2019s price continue to fall, or will it rebound in anticipation of the Fed\u2019s announcements? And will Cardano\u2019s summit provide the catalyst for a much-needed rally? Read on to find out.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Price Crash\n\nEthereum (ETH) saw a 4 percent drop during the early New York trading session on Friday, moving from $1,872 to around $1,788. While Ethereum\u2019s daily 200 Moving Average (MA) remains strong, the price seems set for a mid-term correction due to a developing downward divergence on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and a potential double-top pattern.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum\u2019s daily average trading volume has dropped by over 50 percent in the past two days, falling from about $20 billion to approximately $8 billion at the time of this report.\n\nCardano Summit Excitement At A High!\n\nThe Cardano (ADA) community is thrilled as the CardanoSummit2023 takes place at the Grand Hyatt Dubai Conference & Exhibition Centre in Dubai.

However, ADA enthusiasts are preparing for a weekend filled with uncertainty, similar to Ethereum\u2019s situation, as indicated by technical indicators.\n\nADA\u2019s price has been supported by a strong bear market rebound and the emergence of a four-hour golden cross between the 50 and 200 Moving Averages. Nonetheless, both the daily and four-hour Relative Strength Indexes (RSI) are showing signs of a mid-term bearish divergence. Therefore, ADA\u2019s price could retrace to the support range between 27 cents and 28 cents before potentially resuming the eagerly anticipated end-of-year crypto rally."

Driven by advancements in blockchain technology, regulation and adoption, the market is looking like it will be changing again.\n\nOne of the seminal moments of Q3 2023 was the avalanche of applications for Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETFs (exchange-traded funds) by major asset management firms.\n\nThis was fueled by Grayscale Investments\u2019 victory against the SEC in August 2023, which gave the firm a green light for its BTC spot ETF initiatives.\n\nThis surge in institutional interest is a sign of mainstream financial acceptance.\n\nThe technical upgrades in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem \u2013 particularly the upcoming Cancun upgrade \u2013 promise to redefine how decentralized applications (DApps) operate.\n\nThese exciting developments have set the stage for a transformative Q4.\n\nBTC spot ETFs gain regulatory approval\n\nIn Q3, the world watched as traditional asset management giants threw their hats into the cryptocurrency ring.\n\nBlackRock led the way with its application for a BTC spot ETF, followed closely by other players like Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Valkyrie, Bitwise and VanEck.\n\nThis was not just a bandwagon effect but a strategic move to embrace an asset class that has proven its ability to stay in the game and stay profitable.\n\nAfter Grayscale\u2019s win over the SEC, BTC spot ETFs are set to gain regulatory approval.\n\nA Henley and Partners Crypto Wealth Report showed that as of Q3 2023, there are approximately 425 million cryptocurrency holders globally.\n\nOut of these, a little over 88,000 are \u2018crypto millionaires,\u2019 and nearly half have invested in BTC.\n\nThe coin\u2019s substantial presence in affluent portfolios shows that it is a legitimate asset class that management giants simply cannot ignore.\n\nForbes Advisor also anticipates a bullish Q4, with BTC projecting an increase of 63.3% on the year-to-date and Ethereum set to increase by 40.2%.\n\nBoth BTC and Ethereum are up by 40.9% and 22% respectively as of time of writing.\n\nBitcoin halving and \u2018four-year cycle\u2019 theory\n\nThe four-year cycle theory in cryptocurrency was born from Bitcoin\u2019s halving events.\n\nApproximately every four years, Bitcoin\u2019s mining rewards are halved \u2013 meaning, the number of Bitcoins mined in each new block is reduced by half.\n\nSome groups believe that Bitcoin\u2019s halving event leads to price increases, which in turn affects the entire cryptocurrency market.\n\nWhile this theory seems to have some degree of accuracy, there is no guarantee the four-year pattern will hold.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is complex and influenced by multiple factors, including the global economy, market sentiment, tech development and regulatory shifts.\n\nEthereum Cancun upgrades and implications\n\nThe Cancun upgrade is set to improve the performance metrics of layer two.\n\nThis is especially relevant for projects within the OP ecosystem like Coinbase\u2019s Base, Binance\u2019s opBNB, Gitcoin, Celo and Loot, which adopted the OP Stack for infrastructure and application development.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Cancun upgrade has far-reaching implications across abstract wallets, cross-chain bridges and decentralized storage systems.\n\nThe upgrade significantly enhances Ethereum\u2019s data processing capabilities with an overhaul in the data storage method.\n\nFor Ethereum and its native currency, this positive development means a stronger position in a landscape that is well-known for experiencing rapid evolution.\n\nThe future holds strong\n\nQ4 2023 is shaping up to be a defining period for the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe anticipated BTC spot ETF approval and Ethereum\u2019s Cancun upgrade are markers of more extensive changes on the horizon.\n\nThe crypto landscape is at last steering toward mainstream acceptance and integration.\n\nGiven the landscape, tokens with market caps below $5 billion are expected to have a higher chance of growth \u2013 particularly when assessed across utility dimensions.\n\nUtility has increasingly become the goalpost by which tokens are evaluated, especially as the market is inclined towards tokens that deliver on this front.\n\nAccording to several trader forecasts, DeFi (decentralized finance) and tokens with high utility value are likely to rise as the hot sectors in 2024.\n\nThe rapidity of these developments only heightens the need for all market stakeholders to keep up with these changes, given the formative influence they may wield on future markets.\n\nWhether it\u2019s BTC making its way into traditional asset management portfolios or Ethereum and Avalanche pushing technical breakthroughs, the end of 2023 could look very different from its first quarter.\n\nAmid this whirlpool of changes, tokens that can demonstrate real utility should find themselves at the van of market trends.\n\nRyan Lee is the research chief analyst at

Ethereum has seen a negative supply growth of 0.19%, with an issuance of 697K ETH per year and a burn rate of 924K ETH per year. However, a notable shift has been observed since September. In the last 30\u2026 pic.twitter.com/NP3M0cXMHg \u2014 TheBit Research (@TheBitResearch) November 2, 2023\n\nFor such reasons, the Ethereum price is likely to return to $1,800 in the next couple of weeks, before reaching $1,900 or $2,000 by the end of the year.\n\nAnd if 2024 brings Bitcoin ETF approvals, ETH is likely to surge in the following months.\n\nNew Alts With Strong Fundamentals\n\n\n\nWhile Ethereum remains one of the strongest alts in the market, it\u2019s always a good idea to diversify, with traders advised to devote a segment of their portfolios to newer tokens with big upside potential.\n\nThis includes presale coins, which can often rally big when listing on trading platforms for the first time.\n\nAnd probably the highest potential presale token right now is Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), a tokenized cloud mining platform that has raised more than $3.1 million in around a month.\n\nThis figure indicates how enthusiastically investors have taken to Bitcoin Minetrix, which will provide the opportunity to mine Bitcoin (BTC) by staking its native token, BTCMTX.\n\nSuch a stake-to-mine system is likely to open Bitcoin mining up to a wider demographic, with users who stake enough BTCMTX receiving actual BTC in return.\n\nStakers also receive freshly issued BTCMTX, making the token potentially highly profitable, especially if it experiences big price rises.\n\nIt will have a total cap of 4 billion BTCMTX, with buyers able to join its sale at the official Bitcoin Minetrix website.\n\n1 BTCMTX presently costs $0.01140, although this will rise to $0.01190 by the tenth and final stage of the sale.\n\nThis gives investors a limited amount of time in which to buy the coin at the lowest prices, with BTCMTX set to rally once it lists on exchanges in the next few weeks.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix NowDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

        "content": "2023 has been a great year for Ethereum (ETH), summing up $74.5 billion to its capitalization year-to-date (YTD). This amounts to an increase of 50.9% from the $146.31 billion market cap observed on January 1.\n\nMoreover, investors are continuously staking ETH, with subsequent all-time highs for the total value staked in the Ethereum 2.0 smart contract. It recently achieved the value of a $32 million stake, according to data from CryptoQuant retrieved by Finbold on November 4.\n\nEthereum: Total Value Staked. Source: CryptoQuant\n\nWithin the current positive outlook for Ethereum and the cryptocurrency market expectations for a coming bull market in 2024, Finbold asked ChatGPT to forecast a price range for ETH by the start of the next year.\n\nChatGPT-4: Ethereum price will be between $3,000 to $10,000 in 2024\n\nNotably, the ChatGPT-4 forecasts Ethereum price to trade between $3,000 to $10,000 in 2024. The lowest price in this range would mean an increase of 63% for ETH from its price of $1,835 per ether by press time.\n\n\u201cPredicting Ethereum\u2019s price in 2024 involves analyzing current trends and factors. As of now, Ethereum\u2019s price moves impelled by increased adoption, platform upgrades, and market sentiment. Its price could range between $3000 and $10,000 by 2024. The breadth of this forecast attributes to the volatile crypto market.\u201d \u2014 ChatGPT-4\n\nInterestingly, the GPT-4 artificial intelligence has also mentioned \u201cexpanding institutional adoption\u201d and the role of ETH 2.0 proof of stake network for its price prediction.\n\nEthereum price prediction for 2024 Source: Finbold (ChatGPT-4 Telegram Bot)\n\nAdditionally, it has also pointed toward technical analysis indicators to justify the mentioned price range for Ethereum.\n\n\u201cAnalyzing with indicators like Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Bollinger Bands, Ethereum is on a bullish trend.\u201d \u2014 ChatGPT-4\n\nHowever, the ChatGPT also mentioned that factors like regulatory changes or a significant tech advancement by competitors could potentially drop ETH\u2019s value in 2024.

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price, along with Bitcoin, is presently moving sideways after hitting $1,857 and $35,000 respectively.\n\nSmall-cap cryptocurrencies are making gains fuelled by high investor participation.\n\nThe total value of all other cryptocurrencies, excluding BTC and ETH, has risen by 14% but needs another 9.3% increase to recover all the recent losses.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum price initiated the bullish momentum that pulled up the entire cryptocurrency market. However, even as their rally comes to a halt, the rest of the altcoins seem to continue making the most of the situation, resulting in a significant rise over the past couple of days.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum price halt\n\nBitcoin, after hitting $35,000, stepped back for a while, and Ethereum price did the same after reaching $1,857. Both the cryptocurrencies for the past few days have been moving sideways as the market cools down, but there is an inkling that this sideways price action could result in a decline.\n\nIn the case of Ethereum, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator contributes to this forecast as the receding green bars on the histogram suggest the bullishness is waning. If this is followed by the signal line (orange) moving over the MACD line (blue), a bearish crossover would be confirmed.\n\nThis would occur only if Ethereum price loses the support of $1,827, which coincides with the crucial 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement from $2,005 to $1,539. The ensuing bearish momentum would not only confirm a bearish crossover but also bring ETH down to 50% Fibonacci line at $1,772.\n\nETH/USD 1-day chart\n\nHowever, if the sideways momentum meets bullish momentum via broader market cues and the $1,827 line is tested as a support floor, a recovery is on the cards. Breaching the 78.6% Fib retracement at $1,906 would not only invalidate the bearish thesis but also flip $1,900 into support.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies are faring rather well\n\nWhile BTC and ETH are seeing waning bullishness, the past few days have been spectacular for altcoin investors. Many layer-2 cryptocurrencies, as well as Decentralized Finance (DeFi) tokens, have seen significant rises along with the majority of the layer-1 tokens.\n\nAnalytics platform IntoTheBlock, in regards to this shift in capital, stated,\n\n\"This week's trend suggests this rotation is beginning to take place as Bitcoin and Ether trend sideways while DeFi and alternative L1 tokens record a strong rebound.\n\nThis was verified by the fact that SushiSwap noted a 63% rise in the past three days. Other top DeFi tokens like THORChain (RUNE), PancakeSwap (CAKE), and Aave (AAVE) noted about 35%, 31%, and 15%, respectively.\n\nThis resulted in the market capitalization of altcoins, excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, observing a 14.67% growth, adding 47.13 billion since mid-October. This has brought the market cap to $368 billion, but for the recent losses to be recovered, altcoins would need to collectively raise the market capitalization by 9.38% and register inflows worth $34.55 billion to bring it to a 2023 high of $402.5 billion.\n\nAltcoin market capitalization\n\nHistorically, crypto cycles have followed a pattern of Bitcoin leading the first surge, followed by Ethereum rising, and eventually, capital progressively being allocated to lower-cap and riskier bets. However, if the broader market cues turn bearish, these altcoins could also note sideways movement.\n\nRead more - SushiSwap price rallying by 63% in four days causes $4.8 million worth of short liquidations"

        "content": "Key takeaways\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is expected to reach new all-time highs in Q2 2024, following the next Bitcoin halving event\n\nThe Bitcoin halving occurs approximately every four years and has historically ushered in a new bull market for blockchain-based digital assets\n\nETH rose +2133% after the previous BTC halving to reach its all-time high of $4864, Sporia on TradingView expects a similar level of upside this time around\n\nHere\u2019s how high AI predicts Ethereum price will go after next halving\n\nEthereum (ETH) is currently valued at $1788 after dropping -2.67% in the past 24 hours. This follows a period of upside in which ETH climbed +23.22% over the course of a 3-week period at the end of October.\n\nThe recent surge from ETH means that it has now reclaimed the 50% level on its July-October range in a single bullish move. So far, ETH has held up well at the range\u2019s midway point and early forecasts are suggesting that the positive price action could continue over the coming months.\n\nThe ETH price prediction algorithm has forecasted a +253% move by Q2 2024. This would place ETH at $6,339 \u2014 a new all-time high for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The main catalyst for the projected move is the Bitcoin (BTC) halving event, where the total mining rewards in each BTC block are cut in half.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin halving and when is it due to happen?\n\nThe Bitcoin halving event occurs every 210,000 blocks, which works out to approximately every four years. The process of reducing the blockchain\u2019s total mining rewards by half provides a greater level of deflationary pressure \u2014 after each halving event, the current circulating supply for BTC becomes increasingly scarce.\n\nWhen each block miner was awarded 12.5 BTC, the circulating supply increased by 1,800 BTC each day. After the 2020 halving event, each block miner was then awarded with 6.25 BTC, which meant that there were just 900 BTC being created each day. As a result, the proportion of the circulating supply that is newly mined is continually reduced, making those that are already in circulation more scarce, and in theory, more valuable.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s deflationary mechanism has historically ushered in a new bull market for blockchain-based digital assets. BTC formed new all-time highs in 2013, 2017, and 2021 \u2014 approximately one year after a halving event took place. Right now, the next Bitcoin halving event is expected to occur on 15th April 2024.\n\nHow high could ETH go after the next halving event?\n\nETH shot up +2133% in total after the previous BTC halving. The move cemented Ethereum\u2019s position as the second-most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, taking the ecosystem\u2019s native token from $217 to $4,864 in a period of 18 months.\n\nA trader who goes by the username Sporia on TradingView shared a long-term projection for the price of ETH. The chart highlights two parallel channels in which ETH has been trading since the 2018 alt season, including a strong support line that has been held throughout the bear market of 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe reversal indicator signal has fired off just 4 times in ETH\u2019s history, each time preceding a massive rally. Image source: TradingView (@Sporia)\n\nSporia expects that ETH will continue to hold this market structure over the next 5 years. The upper resistance line provides the ETH price target during the next two bull stages of Bitcoin\u2019s 4-year cycles, including a $16,090 price target in 2025. In total, this would be a +799% price increase from the current level.\n\nBottom line: AI sets bullish near-term target for ETH and long-term outlook remains positive\n\nETH has been a relative straggler during recent bullish moves in the crypto markets, climbing +60% while the total crypto market cap climbed +80% over the past year. The relative underperformance of ETH during this time frame has increased Bitcoin dominance to more than 50%, which in itself is a metric that has historically heralded a fresh period of upside for the entire crypto market.\n\nThe slight underperformance from ETH in recent times should not be a cause for concern. The network was upgraded during the bear market as Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism changed from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake during The Merge, which helped make the blockchain more energy efficient.\n\nETH also benefits from new ETFs and a degree of regulatory clarity from the SEC. On top of that, Ethereum\u2019s various layer-2s have been making major progress in isolation and each one provides an increasing level of buy pressure for the native ETH token.\n\nTo summarize, there are plenty of bullish catalysts for ETH, and it seems only a matter of time before the digital asset starts gaining momentum. As things stand, the ETH price prediction algorithm expects a +253% move in the next 7 months, which would take ETH to a new all-time high just 2 months after the next BTC halving event."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency landscape has seen remarkable growth and innovation over the years, but few developments have generated as much anticipation and excitement as Ethereum 2.0. This significant upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain promises to transform not only the crypto ecosystem but also the broader world of technology and finance. In this article, we will delve\n\nThe cryptocurrency landscape has seen remarkable growth and innovation over the years, but few developments have generated as much anticipation and excitement as Ethereum 2.0. This significant upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain promises to transform not only the crypto ecosystem but also the broader world of technology and finance. In this article, we will delve into Ethereum 2.0\u2019s potential impact, the problems it aims to solve, and how it might reshape the future.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum 2.0: The Beacon of Progress\n\nEthereum, often referred to as the \u201cworld computer,\u201d has been a driving force behind blockchain technology since its inception in 2015. Ethereum introduced smart contracts, enabling developers to create decentralized applications (DApps) and launch their tokens via initial coin offerings (ICOs). However, the Ethereum network has faced challenges, primarily scalability issues that have limited its potential for mass adoption.\n\nEthereum 2.0, also known as Eth2 or Serenity, aims to address these fundamental issues by transitioning from a Proof of Work (PoW) to a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, among other improvements.\n\nLet\u2019s explore the potential impacts of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s transformation.\n\n1. Scalability and Speed: Unleashing the Next Wave of DApps\n\nOne of the most pressing issues Ethereum has faced is scalability. The existing Ethereum network can become congested during periods of high demand, resulting in slow transaction speeds and high gas fees. Ethereum 2.0 introduces shard chains, each capable of processing transactions independently. This enables parallel processing, significantly increasing the network\u2019s capacity and transaction throughput.\n\nThe impact on DApps is profound. With greater scalability and faster transaction speeds, developers can create more sophisticated and responsive applications, potentially unlocking new use cases across various industries, from finance to gaming.\n\n2. Energy Efficiency: A Greener Blockchain\n\nEthereum 2.0\u2019s transition to PoS is not just about scalability; it also addresses environmental concerns associated with PoW blockchains like Bitcoin. PoS reduces the energy consumption required for mining and securing the network. This shift aligns with the growing global emphasis on sustainability and environmentally responsible technology.\n\nAs the world looks for more eco-friendly alternatives, Ethereum 2.0\u2019s green approach might attract more investors and users, leading to broader adoption and investment in the platform.\n\n3. Security and Decentralization: A More Robust Network\n\nThe move to PoS enhances the security and decentralization of the Ethereum network. Validators, who replace miners in validating transactions, are incentivized to act honestly by staking their own cryptocurrency as collateral. This reduces the risk of attacks, making the network more secure and resistant to manipulation.\n\nA more secure and decentralized network can attract a wider range of applications, including those in sectors where data integrity and trust are paramount, such as healthcare and supply chain management.\n\n4. Staking Opportunities: Passive Income for Cryptocurrency Holders\n\nEthereum 2.0 introduces the concept of staking, where users can lock up their cryptocurrency as collateral to validate transactions and earn rewards. This provides an opportunity for passive income for cryptocurrency holders, potentially making Ethereum more attractive for long-term investors.\n\nThe ease of participation in staking can attract a broader demographic of users and investors, further expanding the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n5. DeFi and NFT Growth: Fueling the Crypto Renaissance\n\nEthereum is already the epicenter of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Ethereum 2.0\u2019s improvements will only enhance these sectors. Faster transaction speeds and lower fees will make DeFi applications more efficient and user-friendly. Moreover, the increased security will boost confidence in DeFi platforms.\n\nFor NFTs, Ethereum 2.0\u2019s scalability will enable artists and creators to mint and trade NFTs with less environmental impact and lower costs, potentially fueling the growth of the digital art and collectibles market.\n\n6. Cross-Chain Compatibility: A More Interconnected Crypto Ecosystem\n\nEthereum 2.0\u2019s enhancements are not limited to its own blockchain. The introduction of shard chains and the Beacon Chain will facilitate greater interoperability with other blockchains. This cross-chain compatibility could lead to the creation of a more interconnected crypto ecosystem, where assets and data can flow seamlessly between various networks.\n\n7. The Broader Impact: Eth2 Beyond Crypto\n\nWhile Ethereum 2.0\u2019s primary focus is on blockchain and cryptocurrency, its impact extends beyond these realms. The emphasis on energy efficiency aligns with global sustainability goals. The security and trust elements are applicable to various industries, from logistics to legal, where blockchain can be a transformative force.\n\nAlso, read \u2013 Ethereum 2.0: What\u2019s New and What Is The Future Of Ethereum 2.0\n\nHow ethereum 2.0 has changed the world?\n\nEthereum 2.0, often referred to as Eth2 or Serenity, is poised to bring significant changes to the world, not just within the crypto ecosystem but also in broader technological and financial contexts. While the full impact of Ethereum 2.0 is still unfolding, here are some of the ways it has already started to change the world: 1. Scalability and Speed: Unlocking New Possibilities Ethereum 2.0\u2019s transition from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) and the introduction of shard chains have addressed scalability challenges. This has led to faster transaction speeds and significantly increased capacity. With these improvements, Ethereum 2.0 is enabling a new wave of decentralized applications (DApps) and services that can serve a global audience at scale. This opens up opportunities across industries, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to supply chain management and gaming. 2. Energy Efficiency: Embracing Sustainability The move to PoS has not only enhanced network security but has also made Ethereum more energy-efficient. PoW blockchains, like Bitcoin, are known for their energy-intensive mining processes. Ethereum 2.0\u2019s reduced energy consumption aligns with global sustainability goals and addresses concerns about the environmental impact of blockchain technology. In a world increasingly focused on green and eco-friendly solutions, Ethereum 2.0\u2019s approach has made it more attractive to environmentally conscious investors and users. 3. Network Security: Building Trust The transition to PoS enhances the security and decentralization of the Ethereum network. Validators, who replace miners in validating transactions, are incentivized to act honestly by staking their own cryptocurrency as collateral. This reduces the risk of attacks and makes the network more robust. The improved security and trust in the network are extending to various sectors where data integrity and trust are crucial, such as healthcare, finance, and legal applications. 4.

Ethereum 2.0 represents a beacon of progress, signaling a new chapter in the evolution of blockchain technology.\n\nFAQ\u2019s About Ethereum 2.0\n\n1. What is Ethereum 2.0? Ethereum 2.0, also known as Eth2 or Serenity, is a major upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to improve scalability, security, and sustainability by transitioning from a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to Proof of Stake (PoS).\n\n2. Why is Ethereum 2.0 needed? Ethereum 2.0 is needed to address the scalability issues of Ethereum 1.0. It will increase transaction throughput, reduce energy consumption, and enhance the overall network\u2019s security and efficiency.\n\n3. What is Proof of Stake (PoS)? Proof of Stake is a consensus mechanism in which validators are chosen to create new blocks and confirm transactions based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and are willing to \u201cstake\u201d as collateral. This is in contrast to Proof of Work, which relies on miners solving complex mathematical puzzles.\n\n4. What are the main components of Ethereum 2.0? Ethereum 2.0 comprises the Beacon Chain, Shard Chains, and Docking. The Beacon Chain is already live and acts as a PoS blockchain, while Shard Chains aim to enhance scalability by dividing the network into smaller chains. Docking is the process of migrating from Ethereum 1.0 to Ethereum 2.0.\n\n5. When will Ethereum 2.0 be fully deployed? Ethereum 2.0 is being rolled out in several phases. The Beacon Chain, which launched in December 2020, is already operational. The full transition from Ethereum 1.0 to Ethereum 2.0 is expected to take a few years, with no fixed completion date."

        "content": "Partner at the Venture Capital firm Placeholder Capital and prominent figure in the crypto community, Chris Burniske, has given an instance where assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum could see a repeat of what happened in mid-2019.\n\nNew Highs Before A \u201cFinal Wipeout\u201d\n\nIn a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Burniske mentioned that a repeat of mid-2019 could happen if the top two cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, were to \u201crip\u201d from their current levels. If that happens, the crypto founder believes that the broader crypto market could follow suit.\n\nAs to how these crypto tokens could go, he noted that they could rise enough to make people believe that they could hit new all-time highs soon, but that may not be the case as these investors could endure a \u201cfinal wipeout\u201d soon after (possibly in the first quarter of next year) with these tokens steady declining to higher lows.\n\nTo drive home his point, Burniske suggested that Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s current price action shared similarities to the period between December 2019 and January 2019 before the \u201cpainful descent into March 2020 lows.\u201d According to him, although that period was the COVID era, \u201ceverything is also the same about the actors on the stage.\u201d\n\nBurniske seemed to be certain about his assertions. In a subsequent post, he warned investors that the rollercoaster \u201ccould get extreme\u201d in relation to what he had said earlier and urged them to have their seatbelts on.\n\nETH price sitting at $1,844 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nMarket Cycle And Macro Factors Affecting Bitcoin And Ethereum\n\nMany didn\u2019t seem to react well to Burniske\u2019s projections, considering that it could mean that the crypto market and everyone in it could be in more pain, even if a massive rally (as the crypto founder predicts) is likely to happen before that.\n\nA particular X user, however, seemed to agree with his position as he stated that Burniske\u2019s prediction makes so much sense as that is how the \u201ccycle psychology\u201d works, just that this time, it happens to line up \u201cperfectly\u201d with some highly likely macro scenarios. Burniske responded to the post as he agreed that those were the points he was trying to drive home.\n\nOne of these macro scenarios, which was alluded to, could be the rising inflation and how the Federal Reserve and other authorities globally are increasing interest rates to battle the economic downturn. Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone had once mentioned how Bitcoin could crash to $10,000, with inflation being one of the factors that could lead to the decline.\n\nAnother crypto analyst, Nicholas Merten, had also noted that Bitcoin could decline further if the Feds do not do enough to curb the rising inflation.\n\nFeatured image from The Street, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

The recently launched Devnet 11 is up and running. A Goerli shadow fork is also scheduled to occur.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum developers are most likely to launch a new devnet, Devnet 12, for further code testing.\n\ngm, a few updates from the eth dev call yesterday, acdc #121:\n\n- devnet 11 is up and running\n\n- goerli shadow fork today\n\n- devnet 12 launch probably not till early december\n\n- goerli public testnet launch not likely until after the holidays (my opinion)https://t.co/HniCazLSWc \u2014 Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) November 3, 2023\n\nAs stated in a report detailing the latest Ethereum AllCore Developers Consensus Call, if developers do not work on updating client releases during the week of Devconnect, an Ethereum developer-focused conference in mid-November, Devnet 12 will likely launch sometime in early December.\n\nGiven these new estimates for testing, it seems unlikely that developers will also be able to launch the upgrade on the Goerli testnet in late November, as planned. Developers will most likely begin upgrading public Ethereum testnets after the holidays in Q1, 2024.\n\nEthereum fees soar 30%\n\nAccording to on-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, total Ethereum fees climbed by 30% this week due to many smaller-cap tokens seeing a surge in on-chain trading volumes.\n\nAccording to Santiment, at the start of November, Ethereum network growth reached its highest level in 24 days, while supply on exchanges fell to its lowest level since ETH's inception.\n\nNew Ethereum addresses surpassed 38,000 by the end of October, as the ETH exchange supply fell further to 8.37%.\n\nThe Ethereum price increased to $1,875 on Nov. 2, which Santiment believes was helped in part by the highest \"day\" of new addresses established since Oct. 7. At the time of writing, ETH had fallen below that high and was down 0.09% in the last 24 hours to $1,808."

        "content": "Share:\n\nRender price slipped to trade at $2.22 after a nearly 8% decline following the failed breach of $2.55.\n\nThe Render Network successfully completed upgrading its core infrastructure to Solana from Ethereum.\n\nRender Foundation, in accordance with the upgrade, allocated $2.5 million worth of RNDR as a reward to migrate RNDR tokens to the Solana blockchain.\n\nRender price exhibited a reaction opposite to market expectations after the Render Network achieved a milestone, upgrading from Ethereum to Solana. The network, seeing as to how the transition might affect its users, is assisting by granting subsidies using RNDR tokens.\n\nRead more - Breaking: FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried found guilty on all counts, including stealing $8 billion from users\n\nRender moves to Solana from Ethereum\n\nRender Network, which is a blockchain and crypto-enabled protocol that enables individuals to contribute unused GPU power to help projects render motion graphics and visual effects, was launched on Ethereum back in 2017. But after six years, the project is moving from the \"home of Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\" to Solana, also known as the \"Ethereum killer\".\n\nThe move was touted to be a \"watershed moment\" for Render and seen as an attempt at capitalizing on the benefits of the Solana blockchain. Jules Urbach, the founder and architect of the Render Network, commenting on the transition, stated,\n\n\"Solana's incredible transaction speeds, low costs, and commitment to web-scale architecture make it a perfect fit for the Render Network as we continue building a scalable and decentralized metaverse infrastructure.\n\nIn the announcement, Render Network noted that the transition of assets from Ethereum to Solana is being facilitated by Wormhole. Furthermore, to ease the transition for its users, Render also stated that it has allocated up to 1.14 million RNDR worth about $2.5 million at the current price in grants.\n\nThis would be used to subsidize user transfer fees on Ethereum associated with the upgrade for up to three months.\n\nInterestingly, the market reacted much differently than what was expected out of RNDR.\n\nRender price takes a hit\n\nRender price at the time of writing, trading at $2.22, noted a 7.8% decline in the past day despite the historic milestone. The influence of the broader market cues trumped the impact of the network upgrade, resulting in RNDR falling through the support level at $2.26.\n\nThe altcoin is still in the bullish zone, as noted on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), albeit observing a downtick. If the investors' sentiment remains negative, a further downfall can be expected, which might bring RNDR down to $2.08 and RSI to test the neutral line at 50.0 as support.\n\nIf the broader market cues further push the Render price downward, losing the support of $2.08 is possible, sending the token to tag the support line at $1.91. This level is also coinciding with the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).\n\nRNDR/USD 1-day chart\n\nHowever, if the Render price bounces above $2.08, it could invalidate the bearish thesis. The confirmation of the same would be achieved when the RSI bounces off the neutral line. This would enable RNDR to reclaim the support at $2.26."

This sudden increase has left many wondering: Is the Ethereum network experiencing a revival?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBehind this surge lies a whirlwind of network and development activity. Ethereum's ecosystem, known for its flexibility and adaptability, is currently brimming with developers and innovators. The 30% uptick in trading fees is not just a random fluctuation; it's a direct reflection of the intensifying work being done on the Ethereum platform.\n\nTotal Ethereum fees climbed by 30% this week due to many smaller cap tokens seeing a surge in on-chain trading volumes pic.twitter.com/nwmoxiOEat \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) November 3, 2023\n\nInterestingly, the state of the Ethereum network mirrors a pattern often seen in the crypto world. Historically, periods of retracement and correction on the cryptocurrency market have been accompanied by spikes in developmental activity. This phenomenon is straightforward to understand: when the market takes a step back, it often presents an opportune moment for developers to dive in. It is akin to building the foundation of a house during calm weather, ensuring that it stands firm during a storm.\n\nThese moments of market calm, paradoxically, are buzzing with innovation. Developers and investors are aware that launching projects during these times can be strategically advantageous. With the market in a lull, newer assets and initiatives have room to grow, breathe and establish themselves. Moreover, these periods are magnets for new investors, many of whom are hungry for fresh opportunities. These investors often perceive newer projects as more lucrative compared to assets that have already peaked and reversed.\n\nAs Ethereum's fees continue their upward trajectory, the underlying message is clear: Ethereum is alive and kicking. The platform, with its decentralized applications and smart contracts, is once again proving its worth in the crypto sphere."

        "content": "A trader who accurately predicted the crypto bottom in November of 2022 is expressing bullish sentiment on Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nPseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 54,100 YouTube subscribers that he foresees Bitcoin getting a \u201cmassive pump\u201d that will siphon funds from altcoins and into BTC.\n\nDonAlt says that Bitcoin could afterward consolidate, a move that would positively impact altcoins.\n\n\u201cAnd then you might see another [Bitcoin] consolidation like this [BTC ranging roughly between $33,400 and $35,200], another rotation into altcoins where people chase the 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and then maybe we get a little bit of nice altcoin action.\u201d\n\nBTC is worth $35,223 at time of writing, after hitting a new 2023 high of just under $36,000 earlier in the day.\n\nOn the likely next course of action for Ethereum (ETH) over the short term, the trader says,\n\n\u201cETH\u2026 my view on it is I think there\u2019s a good chance it bounces in general like altcoin sentiment seems to be up, like people are kind of euphoric right now on the altcoin front, even though like they\u2019re only bouncing a tiny percentage of what they lost before. So as long as that maintains you could see a little bit of a bounce.\u201d\n\nETH is trading at $1,831 at time of writing.\n\nTurning to Solana (SOL), DonAlt says a buying opportunity could arise if and when the seventh-largest crypto asset by market cap starts consolidating after the recent rally.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no real good pullback level to buy [Solana]. I think if it goes back to $30, that is scary. It\u2019s a pullback level but it\u2019s scarily close to where it\u2019s actually just full-blown invalidated. And it starts looking really shitty.\n\nOn this one, if this consolidates maybe you just buy the consolidation, like that\u2019s a pullback of sorts that I could see.\n\nOtherwise, if Bitcoin tops [out], this probably goes down. If Bitcoin rips, this probably just keeps on going.\u201d\n\nSOL is trading at $43.21 at time of writing, up by more than 30% over the past week.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "A massive amount of ETH has made its way to centralized exchanges, increasing the Ethereum balances of these exchanges. Given the implications of exchange inflows, it could be a barrier to the cryptocurrency when it comes to claiming the $2,000 resistance.\n\nInvestors Send 13,000 ETH To Exchanges\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows a massive amount of ETH headed toward exchanges as the price rose. The total inflow volume as of October 31 when the price first cleared the $1,800 resistance was at 480,570. However, by the start of November, this number had blown up massively.\n\nNovember 1 saw the total ETH flowing into exchanges reaching 774,890, and by this time, the bulls had established their dominance above the $1,800 level. With outflows coming out at just around 630,000 ETH, the netflows come out to approximately 130,000 ETH flowing into exchanges on November 1. This showed a willingness among investors to start taking profit from their holdings.\n\nSource: IntoTheBlock\n\nAs the data tracker shows, the majority of Ethereum investors had moved back into profit after crossing $1,800. Even following the retracement, the total percentage of ETH investors in profit is sitting at 55.40% and it is no surprise that some of these investors would want to secure profit.\n\nBy November 2, though, there has been a relaxation from investors when it comes to inflows. Data shows that on Thursday, the ETH inflow figures fell to 637,070, although this is still much higher than the previous week\u2019s figures. The exchange net flow is now down to 31,040 ETH as of Thursday.\n\nETH price recovers above $1,800 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nEthereum Large Holders Swing Into Action\n\nEthereum has also seen a spike in the number of large transactions being carried out on the network as well as the transaction volume of these large holders. The total number of large transactions sat at 1,900 on October 29. But by November 2, the figure ballooned to 4,320, an over 100% increase in just four days.\n\nThe transaction volumes of these whales also saw a rise in an almost similar manner compared to the number of large transactions. Large transaction volumes were at 741,440 ETH on October 29. But on November 2, the volume reached 2.21 million ETH. In dollar figures, large transaction volumes went from $1.33 billion to $4.04 billion.\n\nLooking at the bullish and bearish transactions (i.e those who are buying versus those who are selling), there isn\u2019t a large difference bulls still continue to lead in the asset. The 7-day total for bulls came out to a total of 98 bulls compared to 87 bears. But the gap is closing further on a daily basis where IntoTheBlock shows 14 bulls and 12 bears.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "How to Invest In Ethereum | 4 Simple Methods to Start Now - CoinJournal",
        "content": "What to Consider Before Investing in Ethereum\n\nThere are a variety of issues to consider before investing in Ethereum. We will go over some concepts in this section of the article.\n\nFees\n\nGas fees are paid in Ethereum\u2019s native currency, ether (ETH). Gas prices are denoted in Gwei, which itself is a denomination of ETH\u2014each Gwei is equal to 0.000000001 ETH. As you can probably imagine, this can be a relatively negligible amount of money. Exchanges will also charge fees in relation to Ethereum transactions, but these are usually roughly around 0.1%.\n\nRisks\n\nThere are several risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies. And the first of these is that the market is highly volatile compared to many other asset classes. This can be an advantage, leading to big profits from relatively small investments, but it can also, naturally, result in the opposite as well.\n\nAnother issue with cryptocurrencies is that they remain relatively unregulated. Both governments and central banks have been involved in crypto regulation in recent years, and the situation has certainly improved. But they are not as regulated as other aspects of the financial system, with debates continuing over whether they should be regarded as commodities or virtual currencies.\n\nCryptocurrencies can also be vulnerable to theft and hacking, while hard forks and discontinuation can also cause problems for cryptocurrency investors. CFD contracts associated with cryptocurrencies are also highly speculative, and can result in both massive gains, but also huge losses when not used diligently.\n\nPayment methods\n\nThere are several payment methods associated with Ethereum. Considering the popularity of cryptocurrency, most fiat currencies are supported, as are such payment methods as PayPal, Neteller and Skrill. Bitcoin can also be exchanged for Ethereum.\n\nWhy Invest in Ethereum?\n\nThere are several viable reasons to invest in Ethereum. Firstly, the cryptocurrency niche is growing, and is expected to expand still further in the future. Considering that Ethereum is one of the most established tokens, this makes it a good investment option as per veteran investors and traders.\n\nEthereum has also expanded on the functionality delivered by Bitcoin, meaning that it is poised to match, or even exceed, this pioneering cryptocurrency.\n\nThe market position of Ethereum also seems to be extremely strong. Ethereum has outperformed a majority of cryptocurrencies in the past few years which is undoubtedly encouraging for investors.\n\nSummary of Investing in Ethereum\n\nEthereum has been one of the major success stories of cryptocurrency, thanks to its technological improvements that have led to a faster blockchain than the market-leading Bitcoin. This means that institutional money has flowed into Ethereum, making it popular among the investment community.\n\nThere are many different ways to take advantage of the potential of Ethereum, with several trading strategies available. And there is no barrier to entry for beginners either, with algorithmic traders ensuring that entry to the cryptocurrency market, and Ethereum investing in particular, is possible for anyone.\n\nThe investment risk can be suitably managed by using some investment strategies such as hedging. Other strategies like day trading aim to take advantage of price movements around-the-clock. Check out our Ethereum price forecast guide for more information on future price movements."

The withdrawal of ETH suggests a willingness to accumulate.\n\nSome large holders may prefer to hold their assets long-term, removing them from exchanges as a way to store them securely and reduce the temptation to engage in short-term trading.\n\nThe possibility also lies in the fact that the withdrawal could be part of a larger trading strategy or a speculative move based on market trends.\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, the whale deposited 24,495 ETH worth $45 million to Binance on Nov. 2 after the ETH price increased in a profit-taking move. It further adds that the whale traded ETH eight times since Feb. 12, seven of which were profitable, with a win rate of 87.5% and a total profit of $13 million.\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrencies, large holders, often referred to as \"whales,\" can have a significant impact on the market.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was responding to the massive whale buy with a 2.64% spike in the last 24 hours to trade at $1,840 at press time.\n\nCrypto markets experienced a volatile week as the current rally expanded beyond Bitcoin into smaller-cap assets. This caused Ethereum fees in the week to climb by 30% as many smaller-cap tokens saw a surge in on-chain trading volumes."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Distribution Phase at Key Resistance Hints 16% Drop - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Since the onset of November, Ethereum has experienced heightened volatility with the $1830 level proving to be a formidable resistance, impeding its upward trajectory. This resistance has led to two weeks of indecisive trading, as evidenced by long-wicked candles which reflect the market\u2019s current uncertainty. Investors are pondering whether this consolidation could usher in another bearish downturn.\n\nAlso Read: US Seizes $54 Mln Crypto, Including Ethereum, In Narcotics Scheme\n\nadvertisement\n\nIs a Correction Underway?\n\nThe channel pattern leads to the current consolidation in the ETH price\n\nA bearish breakdown channel pattern would set the price at 16%.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $5.3 Billion, indicating a 27% loss.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nThe ongoing recovery in the Ethereum price journey initiated from the mid-October low of $1522 to a three-month high of $1874, amounting to a 23% increase. Nonetheless, this rally brought it to a resistance level that aligns with the upper trendline long-standing wedge pattern, potentially introducing a new supply zone for the market participants.\n\nMirroring the Bitcoin price consolidation, the ETH price is encountering substantial selling pressure around the $1830 threshold, as suggested by the long-wicked rejection candles. However, a detailed analysis at shorter timeframes, reveals a rising channel pattern demarcated by two ascending trendlines.\n\nShould this pattern hold, we might see this altcoin oscillate within the $1800 to $1880 band, indicating a moderate bullish continuation.\n\nFrom a bearish viewpoint, a breach below the channel\u2019s lower boundary could precipitate a short-term downturn for Ethereum. The Fibonacci Retracement Tool delineates critical support levels at $1750 (corresponding to the 38.2% Fibonacci level) and $1700 (at the 50% retracement mark).\n\nA retracement to these zones could potentially be a precursor to a renewed ascension above the $1880 threshold, maintaining the larger bullish narrative.\n\nCan the ETH Price Fall Back to $1500?\n\nEthereum\u2019s daily chart over the last seven months illustrates a methodical pullback within the confines of a descending wedge pattern. The latest uptick was a part of this pattern, testing both of its boundaries. If the pattern endures, a correction towards the $1500 mark might materialize, though traditionally, such a pattern concludes with a bullish reversal, as Coingape mentioned in our previous article.\n\nExponential Moving Average: The daily EMAs (20, 50, 100, and 200) waver around the $1780 to $1700 price bracket, fortifying this area as a strong support zone.\n\nRelative Strength Index: The daily RSI forming lower highs within the overbought territory signals a possible price retracement."

        "title": "Monolithic vs. modular blockchains - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Looking at all the cryptocurrency in tracking sites like Coinmarketcap.com may leave most beginners confused at the number of tokens being offered to the public. Layer-1, layer-2, metaverse, DeFi, gaming, liquid staking, real world assets, memes and the like are like the toys in a large toy shop. Each has its own separate world.\n\nOne of the more recent types of tokens that have hit the market are called layer-2 scaling solutions. Examples of these tokens are Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync, Polygon zkEVM, Consensys Linea, Coinbase Base, Starkware and a few that are not yet well known.\n\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin stated something called the Blockchain Trilemma. A blockchain tries to be secure, fast and decentralized. But according to Buterin, it is very hard to achieve all three. Ethereum, for example, is secure and decentralized, but it is quite slow. Transactions can sometimes take an hour or so to finalize if the network is congested. It is secure and decentralized because more than 500,000 independent validator nodes now secure the network and approve transactions by consensus. That is also why it is slow compared to a blockchain that only has a handful of nodes that validate transactions by consensus.\n\nThe early blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Binance Smart Chain and others basically tried to do all the work of a blockchain by themselves. This is somewhat similar to a restaurant manager who is also the one taking orders, cooking the food, chopping the vegetables, manning the cash register, pouring the drinks and cleaning the tables and floors. The next customer would need to wait until the one-man crew is ready to take their order. Hence, a long line forms outside the restaurant.\n\nThe new layer-2 scaling solutions basically take some of the blockchain functions and only do the final settlement on the Ethereum chain. To the user, they may not notice and might be surprised that Ethereum is still behind the scenes as the one that records the final transaction. But the front end portion of the transactions are handled by the layer-2 chains.\n\nSome time ago Ethereum underwent an upgrade called Shapella. This upgrade allowed the people who staked their ETH for validator nodes to withdraw these. Another upgrade that was done previously was to shift from Proof of Work (like Bitcoin) to Proof of Stake.\n\nThe problem is that Ethereum transactions are still slow and the gas (transaction) fees are still expensive. This is actually what the layer-2 scaling solutions want to address. For example, someone who wants to buy an NFT might not want to pay $50 for transaction fees on a $200 NFT. On the other hand, the buyer might be more amenable if the transaction fee was only $5, but the transaction is done on a layer-2 scaling solution that in turn finalizes on Ethereum.\n\nConversely, if you are transacting something worth a million dollars, having the security of Ethereum might be worth a $20 gas fee just for your own peace of mind.\n\nThe way the layer-2 solutions work is sort of like dealing with the waiter and server at a restaurant, on the ordering, serving and payment. But you don\u2019t actually see the chef who cooked your food. That\u2019s how a layer-2 scaling solution works. It is still working on top of Ethereum, but you just see the scaling solution fee and speed.\n\nOne problem that comes up when you have many Ethereum layer-2 tokens is that when you are using one distributed application (dApp), you need one kind of layer-2; then for another dApp, you need another layer-2. That\u2019s somewhat similar to having non-interchangeable poker chips from one casino to another. Although, right now you can bridge in between these different assets, but everytime you do so, you pay gas fees.\n\nWhether this strategy of performing most functions on layer-2 over Ethereum will dominate other layer-1 monolithic, \u201cdo everything\u201d blockchains is still anyone\u2019s guess. But the upcoming wave of layer-2 tokens looks like they will try to do just that.\n\nZain Jaffer is the CEO of Zain Ventures focused on investments in Web3 and real estate.\n\nThis article was published through Cointelegraph Innovation Circle, a vetted organization of senior executives and experts in the blockchain technology industry who are building the future through the power of connections, collaboration and thought leadership.

        "content": "Cross-chain non-fungible token (NFT) platform Magic Eden has partnered with Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) creator Yuga Labs to launch a new Ethereum marketplace, according to a press release on Nov. 4.\n\nThe new marketplace\u2014to be launched by the end of 2023\u2014will focus on royalties to uphold the principle of ownership and empower creators to \u201ccontinue receiving royalty payments for their original work.\u201d\n\nNFT creator royalty is a percentage of the sales price that the original creator of an NFT receives every time it is sold or transferred to a new owner. It allows creators to continue earning from their digital assets as they change hands in the secondary market, providing an ongoing source of income and incentivizing artists and content creators to participate in the NFT space.\n\nMagic Eden co-founder and CEO Jack Lu noted in the statement:\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to the betterment of the web3 creator ecosystem, steadfast in our belief that we should champion creators who are the heart and soul of the industry\u2026 Right now, it\u2019s a priority to provide creatives with the support they deserve with creator royalty programs.\u201d\n\nThe press release claimed that the new platform will be the first major Ethereum NFT marketplace that is \u201ccontractually obligated\u201d to pay royalties to creators for secondary sales. The \u201cunified vision\u201d of the companies involves \u201ccreating a fair and rewarding ecosystem for imaginative content contributors.\u201d\n\nCreator royalties are non-negotiable\n\nMagic Eden and Yuga Labs have unequivocally announced that \u201crespecting creator royalties is non-negotiable.\u201d Therefore, Yuga Labs will exclusively work with marketplaces that pay royalties for all its future collections, according to the press release.\n\nBoth firms emphasized that the new Ethereum-based platform will be a testament to their long-term \u201ccommitment to protecting creator royalties.\u201d The jointly launched platform will also aim to encourage innovation by boosting the number of builders and creators.\n\nDaniel Alegre, CEO of Yuga Labs, said:\n\n\u201cMagic Eden is putting their money where their mouth is, and together we are supporting the building of an Ethereum marketplace that will back creators, without whom web3 would not exist.\u201d\n\nLu added that the new marketplace will \u201creset\u201d the royalty allocation standard and hopes that its principles will be adopted throughout the ecosystem.\n\nIn a post on X, Lu also noted that Magic Eden has already \u201cmanaged to solve\u201d the problem of royalties on Solana. The firm partnered with Metaplex, the protocol that enables NFT minting on Solana, to roll out royalty protection protocols.\n\n\u201cNow, Royalties are the norm on SOL. And we believe we can do the same on Eth.\u201d\n\nOpen taunt to OpenSea\n\nThe press release seemingly taunted OpenSea, one of the largest NFT marketplaces that made royalties optional in August. Highlighting their firm stance in favor of royalties, Yuga Labs and Magic Eden noted that they have \u201ca clear stance amidst a sea of other marketplaces who turn their backs on creative entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nYuga Labs has publicly criticized OpenSea\u2019s stance on royalties before. In August, Yuga Labs said it would shortly end support for Seaport, OpenSea\u2019s marketplace contract, indicating that its NFTs will not be available on the marketplace in the future."

        "title": "Why the \u201cEthereum killer\u201d narrative may be back in Solana\u2019s favor - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Solana\u2019s recent milestones seem to have created discomfort within the Ethereum clan.\n\nWhile Ethereum L2s thrived with TVL, Solana pointed to its TPS.\n\nA few years ago, when Solana [SOL] launched, the Ethereum [ETH] community was thrown into chaos. The obvious reason for the disarray was because Solana, which combines the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism and Proof-of-History (PoH) entered the ecosystem, and was performing functions that ETH users were hoping that Ethereum would.\n\nRead Solana\u2019s [SOL] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nEthereum still cannot boast about the speed and low transaction costs that Solana offers. But unfortunately for Solana, these metrics were not the only factors in becoming the \u201cEthereum killer.\u201d\n\nWhile Solana excelled with speed and low costs, the project found it difficult to keep its network stable. In fact, between 2021 and 2022, the number of Solana outages worried the crypto community.\n\nThe battle of the vain metrics begins\n\nBut 2023 has been one of Solana\u2019s best years as AMBCrypt reported in a number of articles. As a result, the conversation around taking Ethereum out has risen again. One of the reasons the discussion picked up again was Solana\u2019s DEX volume.\n\nThe DEX volume is the total amount of crypto traded on a DEX within a specific period. According to on-chain analyst Patrick Scott, Solana\u2019s DEX volume has been skyrocketing. Scott also referred to the recovering Total Value Locked (TVL).\n\nDEX Volume on Solana exploding the past few days. Important to note that Solana's volume over the past 24 hours has been nearly 3X its total DEX TVL ($424M vs $153M). In comparison, other major chains have less 24 hour volume than TVL. High volume/TVL should push fees higher,\u2026 pic.twitter.com/6Q0XkQsmvU \u2014 Patrick Scott | Dynamo DeFi (@Dynamo_Patrick) November 3, 2023\n\nThe TVL is a metric that measures the value of assets locked or staked in a protocol. The higher the TVL, the more trustworthy a project is perceived to be, and vice versa. Scott also mentioned that Solana has the potential to attract more liquidity because of that.\n\nMeanwhile, another conversation appeared on another end of X (formerly Twitter). This time, it was Ethereum Maxi Ryan Sean Adams criticizing Solana\u2019s growth. Adams opined that, despite Solana\u2019s milestone, every other Ethereum L2, had a higher TVL than it.\n\nEvery layer 2 is under $10 billion right now while solana floats above $22 billion. If you compared SOL with OP, ARB, and MATIC then SOL would be\u2026 1st in market cap yet 3rd in active users and 4th in total locked value. Do with this what you will. I know what I'm doing. pic.twitter.com/iWJIwPK4XJ \u2014 RYAN S\u039eAN ADAMS \u2013 rsa.eth (@RyanSAdams) November 3, 2023\n\nExamples of Ethereum L2s are Optimism [OP], zkSync, and Arbitrum [ARB]. These projects were developed as scaling solutions for the project while offering low exchange fees, and faster transactions.\n\nWhere do SOL and ETH stand?\n\nHowever, Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Helius, quickly rebuffed Adam\u2019s opinion. For context, Helius is Solana\u2019s leading Remote Procedure Call (RPC). An RPC is a type of computer server that allows users to read data on the blockchain and send transactions to different networks.\n\nMumtaz told Adams that the TVL was a \u201cnoisy\u201d metric. He also pointed out that SOL had a much higher Transaction Per Second (TPS) than Ethereum. Adams said,\n\n\u201cTVL and active addresses are easily gamed, noisy metrics \u2014 especially in the context of people who farm L2 airdrops Solana does more TPS than all those combined while being 100x cheaper and having a much larger community.\u201d\n\nThe TPS is the maximum is the maximum number of transactions that a blockchain can carry out in a second. At the time of writing, AMBCrypto\u2019s investigation showed that Solana\u2019s TPS was 65,000.\n\nHowever, according to ETHTPS.info, none of Ethereum\u2019s L2 came close to Solana with respect to the metric.\n\nThere were also other comments which did not agree with Mumtaz\u2019s position. As the Helius CEO said, other ETH maxis also responded that the TPS was a vanity metric. With respect to SOL\u2019s price, Cryptonary, a data-driven trader, noted that the $37 region needs to hold strong to prevent another plunge.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s SOL\u2019s market cap in ETH terms\n\nIn the long term, the analyst noted that Solana has the potential to grow exponentially. He opined that the $32.50 to $33 could be a good entry point."

        "content": "An analyst opined that BTC and ETH could reach new ATHs before Q1 2024 ends.\n\nAnother analyst suggested that altcoins could benefit from the potential buying momentum in November.\n\nThe increase in value recorded by Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] could only be the tip of the iceberg, according to Chris Burniske.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nBurniske, a partner at blockchain network and web3 infrastructure firm Placeholder, noted that a breakout for ETH and BTC could lead to new All-Time Highs (ATHs) for the cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn fact, Burniske noted that the projection could become reality before the end of the first quarter (Q1) of 2024. For context, BTC\u2019s ATH was $68,789 in 2021 while ETH was 4,891 in the same year.\n\nHistory could be set again\n\nTo back up his point, the analyst referred to the historical performance of the coins, particularly the December 2018 to January 2019 period. He also noted that both cryptocurrencies were showing similar price actions.\n\nIf $BTC & $ETH rip here, and then everything else follows, we could be in for a mid-2019 repeat \u2014 going just high enough to get people to believe that maybe, just maybe, new ATHs are around the corner, before enduring a final wipeout (Q1 \u201824?) and putting in firm higher lows. \u2014 Chris Burniske (@cburniske) November 2, 2023\n\nA look at CoinMarketCap\u2019s data showed that Bitcoin moved from around $4,000 to $10,000 within the period mentioned above. For ETH, it jumped from $113 and closed at around $268.\n\nWhile beating the ATH might sound like a challenging record to break, on-chain data showed that a hike could remain in place. AMBCrypto obtained this inference from the Short Term Holder Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio.\n\nBTC and ETH sellers are fatigued\n\nAt press time, Bitcoin\u2019s STH-MVRV was 1.22. This metric measures the behavior of short-term investors whose demographic is less than 155 days.\n\nWith the metric increasing over the last few months, Bitcoin may be able to maintain the increase it has seen lately over the next few months.\n\nFurthermore, AMBCrypto analyzed Ethereum\u2019s Seller Exhaustion Constant, which also seemed to support the bullish thesis.\n\nUsing the 30-day price volatility, the Seller Exhaustion Constant detects periods of possible high losses and the period when it could be a relatively good period to make gains.\n\nAt press time, the metric had left the danger zone (colored red) and was up to 0.025. This implies that ETH\u2019s value has more room to increase in the short term than its chance of a decrease.\n\nAdditionally, another analyst who weighed in on the BTC/ETH price action was Altcoin Sherpa. According to Sherpa, the value of ETH and BTC may drop for a while. However, he added that the month of November remains a good buying period for both coins.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nSherpa, in his tweet, also mentioned that altcoins besides ETH may reap from the buying pressure in December and January.\n\n$ETH: ETHBTC tanking, I think that altcoin buying opportunity is getting better each day. It's looking more and more like the .048 area is going to get tagged. Expecting November to be a good buying period and then alts do really well in December/January. #Ethereum pic.twitter.com/3qTaTAsskB \u2014 Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) November 1, 2023\n\nAs it stands, both BTC and ETH could hit notable highs. However, making a new ATH is something that looks very difficult to achieve. At the same time, it should not be ruled out."

        "content": "In recent developments, US authorities led by US Attorney Philip R. Sellinger successfully seized $54 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) from Christopher Castelluzzo, a convicted drug dealer operating in Lake Hopatcong, New Jersey.\n\nMassive Crypto Bust\n\nThe US Attorney\u2019s Office filed a civil forfeiture action to recover previously seized cryptocurrency that was determined to be the proceeds of an illegal narcotics distribution scheme operating in and around New Jersey.\n\nUS Attorney Philip R. Sellinger emphasized law enforcement\u2019s \u201ccommitment\u201d to seizing financial gains from criminal activity, regardless of the form they take. Sellinger further stated:\n\nThe civil action we are taking today seeks to recover millions of dollars of cryptocurrency, which the defendant allegedly obtained from drug sales. Whether it\u2019s as simple as bags of cash or as sophisticated as cryptocurrency, we will take the steps necessary to seize financial gains defendants obtain from criminal activity.\n\nAccording to the US Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) press release on the case, the prosecution sheds light on using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum by criminals on the darknet to evade detection.\n\nIn addition, James E. Dennehy, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in Newark, stated that the FBI played a critical role in uncovering the illegal conduct and ill-gotten proceeds.\n\nDrug Trafficker\u2019s Ethereum Stash Seized\n\nAccording to court documents and the investigations conducted, Christopher Castelluzzo and his associates conspired to sell narcotics between 2010 and 2015.\n\nIn 2013, they allegedly began trading drugs on darknet platforms in exchange for Bitcoin. Castelluzzo, using proceeds from narcotics sales, participated in Ethereum\u2019s Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in July 2014, acquiring 30,000 Ethereum. Additionally, Castelluzzo received 30,000 ETH Classic in 2016.\n\nCastelluzzo\u2019s plan to move the funds to a tax haven in Ireland, Malta, or the Bahamas, or potentially keep them in USDT (Tether), was revealed in forfeiture documents.\n\nHowever, a subsequent search warrant led to the raid of Brian Krewson\u2019s residence, an associate of Castelluzzo. Police discovered the relevant crypto wallets under Krewson\u2019s control, and after obtaining the necessary passwords, law enforcement executed the seizure of the Ethereum, valued at $31 million at the time.\n\nCurrently serving concurrent 20-year federal and state prison sentences for drug distribution convictions, Castelluzzo attempted to evade taxes and transfer the 30,000 Ethereum out of the United States while incarcerated.\n\nHowever, Castelluzzo\u2019s plans were intercepted when recorded prison telephone calls exposed his efforts to launder the cryptocurrency. As a result, the United States intervened and seized Castelluzzo\u2019s cryptocurrency holdings linked to his drug trafficking crimes.\n\nThe current value of the 30,000 Ethereum stands at approximately $54 million, underscoring the significant impact of the seizure.\n\nAs of the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,815, reflecting a 0.9% increase over the past 24 hours and a steady upward trend of over 2% in the past seven days, exhibiting strong bullish momentum in the market.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCrypto\u2019s JPEG market is showing signs of life\u2014despite mass layoffs at prominent marketplace OpenSea on Friday\u2014as NFT trading volume grew by $99 million in October compared to the month before, according to a report released by crypto data firm DappRadar.\n\n\u201cThe yearlong downward trend in NFT trading has been broken,\u201d DappRadar wrote, noting that NFT trading volume increased 32% from $306 million in September to $405 million last month. The firm described it as levels of sales not seen since August.\n\nNFTs are unique digital tokens that represent the ownership of an item, often digital art. While the market for NFTs was bubbly in 2021 and early 2022, this year has been tough for many profile picture (PFP) projects so far\u2014as hype for collections like Yuga Labs\u2019 Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) chills amid a prolonged crypto winter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, signs of warmth in the broader digital assets industry could be at play. The uptick in NFT trading volume came as the price of Bitcoin bounced above $35,000\u2014touching its highest price in 16 months on anticipation that a spot Bitcoin ETF could be approved in the U.S. soon, analysts say.\n\nDappRadar\u2019s report highlighted Solana as a notable network in terms of growth. NFT trading volume on the speedy layer-1 grew 15% from $24 million to $27.6 million, DappRadar reported. Meanwhile, the price of Solana itself surged 65% in October, jumping from $23 to around $38, according to CoinGecko.\n\nNFT trading volumes across a breadth of blockchains that support the class of tokens are captured in DappRadar\u2019s report. And across all networks, a 50% jump in NFT trading volume on Ethereum\u2014crypto\u2019s second-largest coin\u2014kept it \u201cleading the pack,\u201d DappRadar said.\n\nAs the flow of JPEGs grew in October, the floor price\u2014or cheapest listed NFT on a secondary marketplace\u2014for some popular PFP projects increased as well. For example, the floor price of NFTs from the aforementioned Bored Ape Yacht Club rose from $40,000 worth of Ethereum to around $55,000.\n\nAn uptick in the price of PFP projects boasting large market capitalizations was recently touched on by Punk9059, director of research at NFT startup Proof. \u201cUptober has arrived,\u201d the pseudonymous researcher said on Twitter last week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe've had 4 consecutive weeks of rising NFT volume. pic.twitter.com/GnuqmxA5xN \u2014 NFTstats.eth (@punk9059) November 3, 2023\n\nWhile DappRadar\u2019s report could provoke WAGMI-like hopes among some NFT traders, $405 million in NFT trading volume throughout October is a paltry sum compared to the $2 billion in JPEGs that traded hands in March. Additionally, NFT sales continued to slump last month.\n\nDespite the rise in trading value, the overall number of NFTs sold in October slid by 5%, from 3.58 million in September to 3.4 million last month, DappRadar reported. Still, the decrease was less severe than when NFT sales fell by 290,000 in August.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "Ethereum Price As Open Interest Stays Aloft At $5.88B, Is $3000 Next? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price alongside other selected tokens like Solana, XRP, Chainlink, Cardano, and more have sustained gains since Bitcoin price broke out in early October. This bull run is riding on optimism around the potential green lighting of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US. Ethereum price bounced off support at $1,500 as investors and traders alike rushed to book positions ahead of what some have come to refer to as an early \u201cSanta Claus rally.\u201d\n\nThe fear of missing out (FOMO) coupled with rumors around the approval of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin spot ETF kept the momentum surging behind Ethereum, which quickly gained ground above key levels, starting with the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (red), the 100-day EMA (blue) and the 200-day EMA (purple).\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Facing The First Litmus Test\n\nThe growing interest in Ethereum provided traders with scalping opportunities, allowing them to buy and sell on short timeframes, further creating liquidity that sustained the run-up above $1,800.\n\nHowever, Ethereum snapped out of the uptrend late last week after trading October highs around $1,862. Traders started to lock in the gains as Ethereum price corrected below a stubborn multi-month falling trendline.\n\nFollowing a few weeks of bullish action, Ethereum currently hovers at $1,815 while bulls fight to reclaim support/resistance at $1,800.\n\nAn immediate recovery seems like a pipe dream based on the prevailing technical outlook as shown by the Directional Moving Index (DMI). The uptrend was sustainable as long as the +DI line in blue was trending higher while the -DI persistently dropped.\n\nHowever, with the +DI falling and the -DI starting to move up, chances of ETH immediately resuming the uptrend are slimming. Traders would be on the lookout for at least two key things.\n\nFirst, Ethereum price must step above $1,800 to keep investors confident in the uptrend. The second would be to watch out for a continued decline \u2014 a move that may break down investor confidence in the uptrend and possibly trigger a sell-off.\n\nThe first major support lies at $1,740 where bulls will try to assert their influence on the trend if declines increase below $1,800. Below this level, we could be staring at a larger breakdown below $1,700, with areas at $1,665, $1,585, and $1,500 ready to serve as tentative support levels.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that a longer downtrend is unlikely, especially with more support expected from all three applied moving averages; the 50-day EMA, the 100-day EMA, and the 200-day EMA.\n\nOn the bright side, an immediate run-up above $1,800 would give bulls another chance to battle the falling trendline. Breaking above this level could signal the start of a prominent rally targeting highs above $2,000 and eventually the much-anticipated bull run.\n\nEthereum Open Interest Still Elevated\n\nAccording to data by Coinglass, a platform tracking the crypto derivatives market, Ethereum\u2019s open interest (OI) is growing consistently, reaching $5.88 billion after falling to $4.76 billion in August.\n\nOpen interest refers to the number of options or futures contracts held by traders in active positions. An increasing OI implies that new or additional capital is coming into the market.\n\nCrypto trader @MacnBTC said via a post on Twitter (now X) that high funding rates on altcoins imply a local top signal. This means that the recent rally could have topped out and pullbacks are likely to occur.\n\nIronically high funding rates on alts = still a local top signal in the bull market this does not apply, which tells me we are still in the very early phases of a run https://t.co/puq7M8KcPC \u2014 Mac \ud83d\udc3a (@MacnBTC) November 3, 2023\n\nHowever, a pullback is not obvious, and leaning on technical analysis might help traders make informed decisions.\n\nWhat\u2019s Ahead for Ethereum Price As ProShares Unveils Inverse ETH ETF\n\nProShares introduced a new product into the market this week, which allows investors to seek exposure to ETH shorts. This means that investors can bet against Ethereum price without actually owning the crypto.\n\nThe ProShares Short Ether Strategy ETF will see investors profit when Ethereum price falls, providing them with returns that are inversely correlated to the usual Standard & Poor\u2019s CME Ether Futures Index.\n\nIn a nutshell, when the index dips by 1% the ETF strategy will ideally gain by 1%. The product is connected to Ethereum futures contracts and not the ETH spot price.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "title": "Bored Ape Creator Yuga Labs and Magic Eden Launching Ethereum NFT Marketplace That Enforces Royalties - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nMulti-chain NFT marketplace Magic Eden announced Saturday that it will launch a new Ethereum platform by the end of the year in collaboration with Bored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs\u2014with a firm commitment to honor creator royalties on NFT sales.\n\nThe companies said in a statement that Magic Eden will have a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d to pay Yuga Labs its share of secondary market sales of its future NFT collections.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very much happy to put our money where our mouth is,\u201d Magic Eden co-founder and CEO Jack Lu told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLu said that Magic Eden\u2019s overhauled Ethereum marketplace would use new smart contracts\u2014which contain the code that powers decentralized apps (dapps)\u2014with technical innovations that it says will ensure that royalties are paid out during secondary market sales.\n\nTechnical details will be revealed before the marketplace launches, but Lu did confirm that the standard ERC-721 Ethereum non-fungible token (NFT) standard will indeed be in use. NFTs minted with certain \u201cproperties of the marketplace contract\u201d will have royalties enforced.\n\nThe change will not impact the way that traders interact with Magic Eden, Lu said; for example, it does not mean that they\u2019ll have to identify themselves via know-your-customer (KYC) checks.\n\nRoyalties disputes\n\nA creator royalty is a small fee set by the artist or company behind a project and taken from the sale price of any follow-up sale of an NFT. The fee typically ranges between 2.5% and 10% of the sale price, and such fees had initially been widely honored by marketplaces as a way for creators to benefit long-term from their tokenized creations.\n\nBut in the second half of 2022, with NFT sales fading, some upstart marketplaces began using workarounds to let traders skip such creator fees, or pay smaller amounts. Major players then followed suit to keep pace, and prominent marketplace OpenSea ultimately decided to stop enforcing royalties this past August after previously committing to honor such fees.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYuga Labs criticized OpenSea in late 2022 when it publicly said it had considered moving away from royalties and came out swinging again this past August after the decision was finalized. The Bored Ape creator said that it planned to stop supporting OpenSea\u2019s marketplace contracts with new collections and those collections with upgradeable contracts.\n\n\u201cObviously, the genesis of this was what we saw happening in the overall ecosystem with secondary royalties,\u201d Yuga Labs CEO Daniel Alegre told Decrypt. \u201cThe gauntlet that unfortunately OpenSea dropped made it very clear to us that we, as a company at the forefront of the NFT space, had to stand up for content creators.\u201d\n\nA press release from Yuga Labs and Magic Eden announcing the news appears to subtly jab at OpenSea, noting that the companies have \u201cmade it unequivocal that respecting creator royalties is non-negotiable, a clear stance amidst a sea of other marketplaces who turn their backs on creative entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoing forward, for new collections, Yuga Labs will exclusively engage with marketplaces that uphold these principles, ensuring fair treatment of creators,\u201d the release notes.\n\nAlegre said that Magic Eden\u2014which is also in a working group with Yuga Labs in OMA3 (the Open Metaverse Alliance of Web3) to improve royalties standards\u2014has pledged to address any loopholes or workarounds with this new technological solution.\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t an exclusivity deal with Magic Eden, either. The companies say that other marketplaces can choose to use the same kind of contracts introduced through this collaboration, and that Yuga Labs hopes to see them broadly adopted. Furthermore, other NFT creators can mint their projects using the contracts to adopt similar protections.\n\nShifting strategies\n\nMagic Eden, best known for its original iteration on Solana, is one of those aforementioned marketplaces that switched to optional royalties last year after pressure from rising rivals. The platform also launched an Ethereum NFT marketplace last fall, but eventually took it offline ahead of the planned revival.\n\nLu acknowledged that Magic Eden \u201cwent through our own changes\u201d in regards to royalties enforcement on Solana, but that it always wanted to support creators\u2014it just wanted a \u201ctechnical solution\u201d for that. Such solutions have emerged on Solana over the past year, and now Magic Eden is among the builders trying to enact such standards on Ethereum, too.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe want to be on the right side of history here,\u201d Lu said.\n\nAlegre said that he\u2019s confident that this approach of supporting marketplaces that enforce royalties will work, and that Magic Eden will work to address any shortcomings of the tech once it\u2019s in the wild. But he also admitted that Yuga has another potential way of encouraging traders to use such marketplaces: withholding future benefits for those who buy NFTs elsewhere.\n\nThe Yuga CEO said that the company will \u201cprovide value to holders who engage with the platforms that make the most sense.\u201d Asked if there will be consequences for NFT buyers who purchase Yuga assets from marketplaces that don\u2019t enforce royalties, Alegre replied that his team is \u201cstill thinking through exactly what that means.\u201d\n\nLanded in HK, pumped for Day 1 of #ApeFestHK & to support @yugalabs on this Had to pick out this this clean boy with Magic Eden colors to celebrate. We've been non stop cooking at @MagicEden across all ecosystems lately - Rare Sats & BTC Amsterdam, Tokenized Pokemon Cards &\u2026 https://t.co/sPXt17U83a pic.twitter.com/wMmLRlunub \u2014 Jack Lu (@0xLeoInRio) November 3, 2023\n\n\u201cYou can imagine situations where we say, \u2018Look, if the last trade was done on a certain platform, then certain benefits in ongoing engagement or ongoing experiences may actually not accrue to the holder of that asset,\u2019\u201d Alegre explained. But he said that Yuga would rather not \u201cput the onus on the consumer\u201d to deal with that because it becomes \u201ccomplicated.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ideal way is actually to ensure that you're working with the right partner,\u201d he said of Magic Eden, \u201cand you direct as much traffic as you possibly can to that partner.\u201d\n\nThat ability to restrict perks and benefits to NFT holders is framed as a potential backup plan for now\u2014a nuclear option, if needed. But Alegre and team hope instead that Magic Eden\u2019s approach will prove to be the solution to flagging creator royalties enforcement.\n\n\u201cWe're confident in the capabilities of Magic Eden,\u201d Alegre told Decrypt. \u201cWe're obviously leaning in very heavily into this partnership, and we have full trust in Jack and his leadership team. And for now, that\u2019s the approach that we're going to take.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "Digital Assets Soar In 2023: Bitcoin And Ethereum Outperform Traditional Assets - TronWeekly",
        "content": "The digital asset market in 2023 continues to impress, with both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) outperforming traditional assets such as gold by 93% and 39%, respectively. Market corrections for these major cryptocurrencies have been shallower than in previous cycles, indicating strong investor support and positive capital inflows.\n\nThe digital asset market continues to post impressive performance, with $BTC and $ETH appreciating meaningfully against USD and gold.#Bitcoin dominance also continues to rise, outpacing traditional and digital assets.\n\n\n\nRead more in our latest analysis\ud83d\udc47https://t.co/e2Js9FinHY pic.twitter.com/yIRh1WRtFA \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) November 1, 2023\n\nGlassnode\u2019s latest analysis reveals the digital asset market\u2019s robust performance and the data presents various key insights. BTC prices have surged by over 30% in recent weeks, partly due to positive developments related to Bitcoin ETF applications awaiting approval from the SEC. Comparatively, BTC and other digital assets have outperformed traditional asset classes like commodities, precious metals, equities, and bonds.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum have exhibited remarkable relative strength in 2023, with BTC gaining 93% in gold terms and Ether rising by 39%. This impressive performance coincides with growing global uncertainty, attracting the attention of traditional investors.\n\nThe correlation between their returns on a rolling 30-day basis is evident, with similar downswings and BTC displaying stronger performance during upswings. Digital assets also exhibit higher volatility compared to gold.\n\nWhen examining the deepest corrections during macro uptrends, Ethereum has outperformed by experiencing a milder correction of -26% from its 2023 high, compared to -60% or more in previous cycles. BTC\u2019s deepest correction in 2023 has been just -20.1%, considerably better than previous cycles.\n\nRising Bitcoin Dominance\n\nHowever, Bitcoin dominance, which measures its market cap relative to the entire digital asset market, has been steadily increasing, reaching 53% in 2023, up from a low of 38% in late 2022. It suggests a prolonged trend where Bitcoin\u2019s dominance rises in the aftermath of bear markets.\n\nThe Altcoin Indicator highlights positive market momentum for digital assets, supported by capital inflows into BTC, Ethereum, and stablecoins. This indicator turned positive on October 20th, preceding a significant BTC price increase.\n\nWhile altcoins have seen a notable 37% increase in market cap, BTC surged 110% in 2023. It indicates that while altcoins are outperforming traditional assets and fiat currencies, they still lag behind the performance of Bitcoin.\n\nRelated Reading | MicroStrategy\u2019s Q3: 158,400 Bitcoin & AI Integration Drive Strong Performance"
