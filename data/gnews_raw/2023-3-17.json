        "title": "Better Buy: Coinbase vs. Ethereum - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The crypto winter has crushed valuations for tokens and companies that operate trading exchanges. Ethereum's (ETH 1.37%) price has fallen roughly 65% from it's record high set in November 2021. Meanwhile, leading exchange-services provider Coinbase Global (COIN 0.78%) has seen its valuation plummet 81% from its peak.\n\nWould investors be better off putting their money behind the leading Layer-1 blockchain services provider's ether token or buying Coinbase stock based on today's pricing levels? Read on to see why two Motley Fool contributors have differing takes on which looks like the better investment right now.\n\nEthereum is a category leader in blockchain services\n\nKeith Noonan: Launched in 2015, Ethereum has proved its staying power and has established itself as the clear leader in Layer-1 blockchain services. The company's network has become the go-to destination for those looking to build, deploy, and scale blockchain-based applications, and this foundation provides a key fundamental support for the value of the Ether token.\n\nIf Ethereum continues to attract new projects and facilitate their growth, that should create demand for the ether token and be a price catalyst.\n\nWhile Coinbase might appear to have lower risk based on the fact that its core business is providing trading and holding services for the broader crypto ecosystem, I actually see this as a source of greater risk.\n\nCoinbase's platform allows users to easily buy and sell an incredibly wide range of cryptocurrencies, but I think that most of these coins will probably trend toward zero on the valuation scale, and it seems almost inevitable that even some relatively high-profile projects will eventually blow up in big scandals.\n\nCoinbase has already had some scandals of its own -- including security breaches, insider trading, and allegations of insufficient safeguards against money laundering.\n\nThe crypto industry is still very much in its infancy, and the low barriers to launching and promoting a token mean that investors should take a highly selective approach to their investments in this sector.\n\nI view the vast majority of crypto projects to be of very low quality, so the prospect of investing in a business whose core services revolve around crypto trading and wallet services does not seem appealing. By comparison, Ethereum has already proved itself to be a much higher-quality project.\n\nIn general, I think that investors should only focus on crypto projects and related companies with proven track records. Ethereum fits the bill, has proved to be relatively scandal free, and can stand through the rise and fall of other projects and businesses in the crypto industry.\n\nCoinbase has demonstrated its potential\n\nParkev Tatevosian: Coinbase stock has been hammered in recent quarters due to the decrease in popularity of cryptocurrencies as an asset class. In the early stages of the pandemic, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies reached $3 trillion. That figure has dropped to about $1 trillion.\n\nCoinbase, a platform that lets users buy, hold, and sell digital currencies, attracted millions of new customers during the crypto frenzy. Admittedly, many of those folks will leave if the popularity and prices of crypto assets don't recover. Still, Coinbase stock can be lucrative for investors as long as it can retain a meaningful portion of those early customers.\n\nThe explosive growth peaked in 2021, when Coinbase's revenue reached $7.8 billion and operating income hit $3 billion. That showed investors the magnitude of profits it could generate at scale. It will need to lower expenses to match a smaller scale if the industry doesn't rebound to pandemic highs.\n\nThere is a risk that Coinbase might not be profitable on a smaller scale. However, the stock is trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 4.5, which is significantly below the ratio of more than 18 at its peak. The stock might come with high risk, but it also has plenty of upside for investors with a high risk tolerance.\n\nSo which is the better buy?\n\nFor investors seeking broad-based exposure to the crypto space, investing in both Ethereum and Coinbase could be the right move. Otherwise, it makes sense to focus on their differing characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses and then determine which potential investment vehicle is better aligned with the direction you see the crypto space heading in.\n\nIf you're looking to take a narrower approach to investing in crypto and think that Ethereum will continue to be a top provider of network services, then it's probably the better buy. On the other hand, if you're positioning for an overall rebound in crypto valuations and are seeking investment vehicles that have a diversified exposure to the broader market, Coinbase stock is likely the better fit for your investment priorities."

        "title": "Ethereum liquid staking braces for April 12 withdrawals - Protos",
        "content": "Listen to this article.\n\nWith Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai update scheduled for April 12, holders of liquid staking tokens are likely keen to find out how the event will affect their holdings. ETH liquid staking tokens belonging to just two services \u2014 Lido (stETH) and Coinbase (cbETH) \u2014 are worth over $10 billion. Other services include RocketPool, StakeHound, Frax, StakeWise, Bitcoin Suisse, and Liquid Collective.\n\nPrior to Shanghai, any ETH deposits into these protocols were not able to be withdrawn from Ethereum\u2019s (deposit-only) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system. After Shanghai, albeit subject to lengthy withdrawal queues, users will be able to unstake their ETH and sell or migrate to a new liquid staking service.\n\nSpecifically, holders of a liquid staking token like stETH will be able to request a redemption for actual ETH from Lido, redeeming their stETH for official ETH. In the case of stETH, a token holder will soon be able to request a redemption from Lido DAO\u2019s smart contracts, the issuer of stETH.\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s largest staking service finally regains stETH peg\n\nAs a result, all liquid staking administrators will have to compete against other staking services just to retain their current depositors.\n\nPrior to Shanghai, liquid staking services have only been competing for inflows. Next month, they\u2019ll also compete to retain their investors.\n\nOf course, each service issues a different token and advertises slightly different reward mechanisms to pass along the yield earned from Ethereum\u2019s PoS validation. Below is a review of Ethereum\u2019s major liquid staking services.\n\nCoinbase holds 11% of staked ether\n\nCoinbase has the advantage of being one of the world\u2019s oldest and largest digital asset exchanges. It also operates one of Ethereum\u2019s largest liquid staking services.\n\nCoinbase customers send ETH directly to the Coinbase Earn product where Coinbase will stake it on the customer\u2019s behalf. This simplicity has allowed it to accumulate an 11% share of staked ETH.\n\nIn August 2022, Coinbase launched its native \u2018staked Ethereum\u2019 token, cbETH. Unlike Lido DAO\u2019s 1:1 peg of its liquid staking token (stETH) to ETH, Coinbase recalculates cbETH\u2019s value on the original amount of staked ETH plus the rewards it\u2019s earned over time.\n\nThis feature means cbETH holders may redeem one cbETH for more than one ETH after the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nOne risk factor is that Coinbase operates only one validator. Although its validator is enterprise-grade and properly maintained, if it goes offline, none of the stakers using Coinbase\u2019s staking platform can earn rewards. In addition, Ethereum\u2019s protocol would slash Coinbase\u2019s stake as a penalty for downtime.\n\nAs a trade-off for convenience and simplicity, Coinbase offers lower rewards than most ETH staking pools. It currently offers customers a 3.89% APY on Ethereum staked into Coinbase Earn.\n\nRead more: Kraken settles with SEC over crypto staking \u2014 is Coinbase next?\n\nLido validators are less likely to get bored\n\nBy far the largest liquid staking platform with 31% share of all staked ETH, Lido has more than 5.8 million ETH in its staking pool.\n\nUnlike self-administered, so-called \u2018solo staking,\u2019 Lido offers compounded yields on staked holdings. This essentially allows Lido Staked Ethereum (stETH) token holders to earn interest on previously earned interest. It has a 10% fee on staking rewards that it splits between node operators and the treasury of Lido DAO.\n\nLido gives staking rewards daily by rebasing its liquid staking token, stETH. Rebasing is a technique whereby a protocol adds and/or subtracts tokens directly within wallets that have approved rebasing actions. Rebasing increases the quantity of stETH by a small percentage each day.\n\nBecause staked ETH is obviously yield-bearing, this feature ensures that holders can redeem stETH tokens for ETH at a 1:1 ratio when Shanghai goes live.\n\nLido claims to be highly selective in choosing its third-party validators. It says it chooses committed, professional validators less likely to get bored and turn off their machines after a few months. A deactivated validator is subject to slashing and cannot earn rewards while offline or out of consensus.\n\nOne downside is that Lido reserves the option of socializing the risk of slashing, reducing the earnings of all stakers on its platform to avoid a major hit on any single staker.\n\nAs a smart contract-based protocol, Lido is exposed to risks of hacks and exploits. Like all other smart contracts, the price of its liquid staking token could collapse if hackers are successful.\n\nRocketPool says it will socialize slashing penalties\n\nRocketPool has more than 430,000 ETH in its staking pool. Unlike Coinbase, it has 2,199 validators, making it one of the most distributed liquid staking services by number of validators. Like Coinbase, RocketPool calculates the value of its rETH token on the amount of initially staked ETH plus earned rewards over time.\n\nRocketPool offers two options for staking.\n\nUsers can simply stake any amount of ETH and earn interest.\n\nIf they are willing to stake at least 16 ETH, users can also stake and run a node for a higher APR plus RPL rewards. RPL is the proprietary governance token of the RocketPool community. It advertises its \u2018Stake + Run Node\u2019 option as half as expensive as solo staking, which requires at least 32 ETH for activating an official set of validator keys.\n\nRocketPool bases its APR on a seven-day moving average, which currently sits at 5.97% for simple staking \u2014 far higher than Coinbase\u2019s 3.89% \u2014 and as high as 7.12% for its \u201cStake + Run Node\u201d option.\n\nRocketPool says it will socialize slashing penalties and other losses from a bad or deactivated node, which reduces the loss to any individual staker.\n\nStakeWise does things a little differently\n\nStakeWise operates a little differently by offering two liquid staking tokens.\n\nWhen a user contributes ETH to StakeWise, StakeWise gives them deposit tokens plus reward tokens used to pay the \u2018interest\u2019 for staking ETH. Instead of simply rebasing the original token like Lido does to its stETH, StakeWise has sETH2 grant daily rewards in a token called rETH2. Holders can redeem rETH2 for ETH at a 1:1 ratio.\n\nStakeWise offers real-time node monitoring as well as an API for third-party app development.\n\nFrax does things VERY differently\n\nFrax takes a very different approach with its token rewards. When users send ETH to its \u2018frxETHMinter\u2019 tool, they receive an equivalent amount of frxETH token. However, frxETH isn\u2019t eligible for ETH staking rewards on its own.\n\nUsers have to go through one additional step to earn rewards. They need to exchange their frxETH tokens for \u2018staked frxETH,\u2019 or sfrxETH. Then they can earn interest on their deposited frxETH. Their sfrxETH will be worth the original frxETH, plus any frxETH rewards they received.\n\nAs one might expect, sfrxETH trades slightly higher than frxETH.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, Coinbase, Lido, Stakewise, and Frax are four of the biggest ETH liquid staking pools. They may experience large redemption requests or a run on their liquidity pools on secondary exchanges after Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Shanghai update enables withdrawals of staked ETH. Shanghai could activate by April 12.\n\nOn the other hand, the Shanghai upgrade might strengthen these liquid staking services by enabling true redemption of pooled, staked ETH via Ethereum\u2019s official protocol.\n\nOver the next four weeks, liquid staking will undoubtedly continue to provide a popular way to stake ETH while retaining a liquid staking token that usually trades close to par with ETH.\n\nFor more informed news, follow us on Twitter, Instagram, and Google News or subscribe to our YouTube channel."

        "content": "Ethereum Scaling Solutions Surpass Mainnet By 48%\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nActivity on Layer 2 networks has surged to new all-time highs, with combined L2 activity beating out mainnet Ethereum transaction volume by 48% on Thursday.\n\nMore than 1.54M transactions were executed on Layer 2 networks in the past day, compared to 1.04M on Ethereum, according to Orbiter Finance. L2 transactions previously peaked at 1.52M on Feb. 22.\n\nThe data shows that Ethereum users are increasingly migrating onto Layer 2 scaling solutions, which offer faster and cheaper transactions compared to Ethereum\u2019s mainnet.\n\nLayer 2 and Ethereum mainnet transaction volume. Source: Orbiter Finance.\n\nArbitrum One, the leading Layer 2, beat out Ethereum\u2019s volume alone with 1.08M transactions. Optimism ranked second with 267,288 transactions, followed by Arbitrum Nova with 52,070, and zkSync with 49,410.\n\nArbitrum To Airdrop Long-Awaited ARB Token On March 23 Layer 2 Network To Decentralize And Add Support For Layer 3 Blockchains\n\nEthereum fees have remained relatively low for the past nine months, generally averaging between $2 and $6 since mid-2022, according to BitInfoCharts. But fees abruptly tripled amid the chaos caused by the USDC stablecoin de-pegging over the weekend, highlighting Ethereum\u2019s need for a robust Layer 2 ecosystem.\n\nAverage transaction fees trended between $20 and $60 at the peak of the bull market in Q4 2021.\n\nCapacity Constraints\n\nNick Bishop, director of NotCentralised, a web3 venture studio, said that while Ethereum is excellent at providing security, it is also \u201ccapacity constrained.\u201d\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha? Become a premium member of The Defiant and join our DeFi Alpha community. Start for free\n\n\u201cL2s have a natural tailwind from rising DeFi usage,\u201d Bishop continued. \u201cAs the usage of tokens expands into high volume, real-world ecosystems, higher throughput is essential.\u201d\n\nDaniel Bar, the founder of venture capital network Bitfwd Capital, said the spike in L2 activity marks a new era of L2-focused blockchain development.\n\n\u201cThe maturation of the various L2s, particularly Arbitrum and Optimism, set a trajectory for multichain L2 ecosystems to flourish on their own,\u201d Bar said. \u201cWe can expect this trend to grow exponentially in the next bull run as more users flood the products that are getting built on these L2s.\u201d\n\nLayer 2 Adoption\n\nLayer 2 networks now secure $6.6B in total value locked (TVL), according to L2beat. That equates to 14% of overall DeFi TVL and 23% of Ethereum\u2019s DeFi TVL, according to data from DeFi Llama.\n\nThe sector is dominated by Arbitrum and Optimism, which represent 86% of its TVL. Both are optimistic rollup networks. Rollups work by bundling together transactions on Layer 2, and then submitting them to the Ethereum mainnet for finalization.\n\nOptimistic rollups were fast to gain market share because of their compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, Ethereum\u2019s core smart contract engine. However, mainnet withdrawals are slow, requiring a 7-day delay because of the fraud prevention methods employed by optimistic rollups.\n\nCompeting With ZK Technology\n\nArbitrum and Optimism may soon face stiff competition from a new generation of EVM-compatible rollups secured by zero-knowledge proofs (zkEVMs). Proponents tip that zkEVMs will offer faster finality and enhanced security guarantees compared to optimistic solutions.\n\nPolygon, Matter Labs, Scroll, and Consensys will each launch a mainnet zkEVM in the coming months, with Polygon\u2019s zkEVM expected to arrive first on March 27.\n\nBishop expects the increasing adoption of Ethereum L2s will undermine the value proposition of low-cost EVM-compatible Layer 1 networks and force them to either \u201cmorph into L2s or die.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo chain has surpassed Ethereum in ecosystem breadth and flexibility of smart contract deployment,\u201d he continued. \u201cEthereum will sink further down in the web3 tech stack to a foundational, secure set of rails on top of which L2, L3, and L4 iterations will flourish.\u201d"

        "content": "Coinbase users may face delays in unstaking their ETH after Ethereum's Shapella upgrade, due to on-chain processing. Coinbase advises users to be patient and offers a liquid staking option, \"cbETH.\"\n\nCoinbase has warned its users that unstaking requests for ETH on its platform may take weeks or even months to process after the upcoming Ethereum network update in mid-April. The Shapella upgrade will enable stakers to withdraw their ETH holdings after they were locked up during the Ethereum Merge event in September 2022, which transitioned the network from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nCoinbase anticipates a flood of unstaking requests once the functionality is enabled, but as a channel to pass unstaked ETH to customers once released by the protocol, it has no control over the on-chain processing of requests. Unstaking requests will open to all Coinbase customers at the same time and be queued based on when they are received.\n\nWhile Coinbase cannot give an exact timeframe for unstaking, it expects considerable wait times due to the time it takes for the Ethereum network to process transactions. In the meantime, Coinbase provides a liquid staking option called \"cbETH,\" which lets stakers trade ETH while it is still locked up, with the promise of redeemability at a later date.\n\nThe Ethereum Merge was a significant milestone for the network's scalability, transitioning from PoW to PoS to reduce energy consumption and improve transaction processing times. While the Ethereum network remains the leading platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts, ETH stakers have been unable to access their holdings since the Merge. The upcoming Shapella upgrade will finally provide a solution, allowing users to withdraw their staked ETH and stake more without being subject to an indefinite lockup period.\n\nOverall, Coinbase's warning of potential delays in unstaking ETH highlights the complexities and limitations of on-chain processing. While the Ethereum network continues to evolve and improve, users must be patient and consider alternative options like Coinbase's cbETH to mitigate the inconvenience of locked-up assets."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin took to social media to tout the benefits of using multi-sig and social recovery wallets for self-custody of crypto assets.\n\nButerin said that self-custody is important as centralized entities can become untrustworthy and people can lose their funds without notification. However, he added that being solely responsible for the entirety of one\u2019s security system carries inherent risks that can be minimized by using multi-sig and social recovery technology wallets.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder said he and the Ethereum Foundation use multi-sig wallets to secure most of their crypto assets.\n\nMulti-sig & Social recovery\n\nAccording to Buterin, multi-sig wallets \u2014 like Gnosis Safe \u2014 should be used for cold storage of crypto-assets as they require multiple keys to sign off on transactions.\n\nUsers can assign multiple people to hold their keys and set up their wallet, so x amount of keys are required for a transaction to be approved \u2014 this could be all keys or some.\n\nMeanwhile, social recovery wallets are a nascent technology being developed recently and are set to become more accessible in the coming months with applications like the \u201cSoul Wallet.\u201d\n\nSocial recovery wallets allow transactions to be approved with a single \u201cmaster key\u201d which can be recovered if lost. Users can assign people to hold \u201crecovery keys,\u201d which can be used to reset the master key if lost.\n\nButerin said that once social recovery technology is made more accessible, he would recommend using it for hot storage.\n\nHe added that both technologies allow people to safeguard their assets in their lifetime and ensure they are recoverable after their deaths.\n\nGuardians\n\nButerin said an important part of using these technologies is choosing the \u201cguardians\u201d wisely. Guardians are people one would designate as holders of keys to confirm transactions or recover wallets. He said:\n\n\u201cTwo key questions in using multi-sig wallets and social recovery wallets securely are: (i) whom do you choose as guardians, and (ii) what instructions do you give them?\u201d\n\nAccording to Buterin, guardians have to be people who will not lose keys and who will not conspire to steal the holder\u2019s assets. As such, guardians should be as decentralized as possible. He added that each guardian\u2019s risks should differ, and people should avoid commonalities when choosing guardians.\n\nHe said guardians could be people or devices, and using one\u2019s device or wallet to act as a guardian does not reduce decentralization and is okay. However, most guardians should not be devices under a single person\u2019s direct control.\n\nButerin recommended using guardians that do not know each other, and where possible, guardians should be in different countries. He said that guardians would only need to know each other in the case of a holder\u2019s demise, and in those cases, these guardians would naturally find each other by reaching out to friends and family.\n\nAdditionally, Buterin said that guardians must be tested multiple times a year to ensure they still have access to their keys and there are no operational issues.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "A popular crypto analyst known for calling the 2018 Bitcoin (BTC) bottom is predicting a massive rally for Ethereum (ETH).\n\nThe pseudonymous analyst Smart Contracter tells his 221,400 Twitter followers that Ethereum appears to be at the end of a correction and ready to surge.\n\n\u201cETH/BTC just took out a six-month low, only 3% lower before my major buy zone.\n\nNot the circumstances I was expecting this to happen under (I thought ETH and BTC would be falling but ETH more so) but there\u2019s no chance I\u2019m missing the monster ETH rally that\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nLooking at his chart, the analyst shows ETH/BTC in a downward correction and about to tap the crucial 0.618 Fibonacci retracement support, which traders see as a likely point for a bounce.\n\nSmart Contracter\u2019s bullishness on ETH comes as crypto analytics platform Santiment says sharks have accumulated 3.61 million ETH coins in the past year, worth a whopping $6.13 billion.\n\nHowever, whales unloaded more than double that amount.\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s large addresses have shifted their supply held substantially. Addresses holding 10-10,000 ETH have collectively added 3.61 million coins in the past year. Meanwhile, addresses with 10,000-10,000,000 ETH have collectively dumped 9.43 million in the same timeframe.\u201d\n\nThe crypto analyst also says Optimism (OP) is also looking bullish.\n\n\u201cBullish expanded flat on daily for OP against USD, BTC and ETH pairs. Looks like one of the alts that will perform very well in my opinion.\u201d\n\nUsing the Elliott Wave theory, an advanced technical analysis method that forecasts future price action based on crowd psychology manifesting in waves, Smart Contracter says Optimism is at the bottom of a correction and setting the stage to move to the upside.\n\nEthereum is worth $1,819 and Optimism trading at $2.57 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Use Multi-Signature And Social Recovery Wallets To Achieve Self-Custody, Ethereum Creator Says - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin advised crypto investors to use social recovery and self-custody wallets. Buterin\u2019s suggestion comes amid heightened expectations for the new Arbitrum token airdrop scheduled on March 23 and the upcoming Shanghai upgrade.\n\nThe recommendation makes sense given the increased cyber-related crimes in crypto, with hackers targeting a vulnerability in user wallets. The Ethereum co-founder suggested multi-signature and social recovery wallets so that users can hold self-custody of their funds.\n\nSelf-Custody Is Crucial In Crypto: Ethereum Creator\n\nSocial recovery wallets are smart-contract-powered wallets that allow users to recover access to their stolen funds even if they lose their private key. On the other hand, a multi-sig wallet requires two or more private keys to authorize a transaction or access funds.\n\nIn a tweet, Buterin noted that self-custody is crucial in the crypto ecosystem, especially with the last year\u2019s event. The many hack exploitations in 2021 and 2022 with the FTX fiasco magnified the need for self-custody wallets.\n\nButerin suggests multi-sig wallets for long-term holdings and social recovery wallets for short-term day-to-day trading activities.\n\nFollowing his recommendation, Buterin made a Reddit post that detailed his opinion on how users should choose guardians for social recovery and multi-sig wallets. In his Reddit post, the founder recommended multi-sig wallets like Gnosis Safe, an easy and reliable wallet to store funds.\n\nButerin explained that centralized organizations are trustworthy but pose risks of regulatory pressure, including system and human errors. Therefore he advised users not to trust centralized entities.\n\nFurther, he stated that social recovery wallets are easier to use than multi-sig wallets. The ERC-4337 account abstraction and newly built smart contract wallets like Soul Wallet bolsters wallet security.\n\nChoice Of Wallets, Key Guardians Can Minimize Risks Of Assets Loss\n\nIn addition, Buterin suggested using social recovery for hot wallets that store smaller portions of funds and multi-sigs for cold wallets that store more funds. Also, he noted that selecting good guardians is crucial.\n\nGood guardians improve the security of crypto funds by reducing the chances of losing keys, funds theft, and risks of sharing private keys with others. In the post, Buterin detailed how to choose a secure guardian.\n\nOne of the comments to Buterin\u2019s post talked about the importance of having guardians that can use hardware wallets. It also noted that using guardians for hardware wallets is better than storing keys in Metamask or Google Drive.\n\nWhile responding, Buterin said that hardware wallets are unnecessary due to issues that might arise with the issuing company. However, he agreed with the commenter that using Google Drive or Metamask to store keys are risky.\n\nButerin\u2019s posts followed several wallet attacks that led to a loss of thousands of dollars. These include MyAlgo Wallet exploit, which saw massive amounts of money stolen from users\u2019 accounts.\n\nThat is not Buterin\u2019s first time recommending social recovery wallets. On January 11, 2021, Buterin posted a blog detailing the need for crypto investors to adopt recovery wallets. In the article, Buterin said multi-sig is his favorite of all wallet categories. He introduced recovery wallets as easy to use with high-level security.\n\nFeatured image from Pixabay and chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Who is Thomas Greco? Is the Mysterious Ethereum Adviser Shiba Inu Ryoshi? - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "The crypto community seems awash with a renewed obsession to uncover the identity of Ryoshi, the mysterious Shiba Inu founder.\n\nOver a week ago, Coinbase Director of Project Strategy & Business Operations, Conor Grogan, drew links between the anonymous crypto founder and Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s Alameda Research, sparking speculation that SBF is Ryoshi. And as reported today, prominent crypto Youtuber Ben Armstrong, aka Bitboy Crypto, tapped one of the founders of Unification as Ryoshi, a claim that the Unification founder has denied.\n\nIn response to the latest speculation, Digital Asset Investor, another crypto Youtuber has pointed Bitboy in the direction of Thomas Greco (at least that is who he identifies himself as), a mysterious figure in the early days of Ethereum.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNotably, the first hint that he could be Ryoshi is that he appears in a picture attached at the end of Ryoshi\u2019s first Medium blog along with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum Foundation Executive Director Aya Miyaguchi and two other unidentified persons in Japan. The picture was supposedly taken during Devcon 2019, with a YouTube video from Coin Bureau two years ago identifying him as Ryoshi.\n\nBut first, Who is Thomas Greco?\n\nWell, no one really knows, and those who do are tight-lipped, as highlighted by Digital Asset Investor, who also shared a clip of prominent crypto journalist Laura Shin asserting that Buterin was reluctant to talk about the mysterious figure.\n\nA search of the name Thomas Greco does not turn up much and mostly links to a community economist who writes about alternative monetary exchange solutions like private credit clearing systems, complementary currencies, and local currencies. However, when you add the keyword Ethereum, you will find a handful of videos where the so-called Ethereum adviser can be seen with Buterin or speaking at Ethereum events and articles that cite him as an adviser on the OmiseGo project as well.\n\nIn a Financial Times interview of Buterin from 2018 that turns up in the search, Greco is described as a \u201ccollaborator\u201d and \u201cdeveloper\u201d who Buterin asserts has worked with him for years. In an Epicenter Podcast episode with Laura Shin from 11 months ago dissecting her book \u201cThe Cryptonians,\u201d which also turns up in the search, the journalist relaying the information from Ethereum Foundation members at the time alluded to Greco as a close friend of Buterin who played the role of gatekeeper deciding who gained access to the founder and influencing key decisions along with another likely pseudonymous friend called Wendell Holmes.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHowever, by far, the most well-put-together account of the Mysterious Ethereum figure is by an individual known only as Kevin, who runs an alternative income blog called Turtle Investor. Kevin\u2019s account is also the first that alludes to the fact that Greco is an assumed identity while also pointing out that the enigma went on to advise on other popular projects, including Polkadot and Cosmos. As highlighted by Kevin, Greco could be seen at almost every event with Buterin from 2017.\n\nKevin is yet to respond to a request for comment from The Crypto Basic at the time of writing.\n\nCould He be Ryoshi?\n\nWhile there is no clear-cut evidence to prove this, it is worth noting that assuming Buterin to be the friend mentioned by Ryoshi in his first Medium blog post, it is easy to see how this argument can be made.\n\nRecall that Ryoshi claimed to have started SHIB with a friend with whom he shared his ideas of a decentralized ecosystem. The friend, who he alluded to as a successful businessman and influential person in the crypto space, helped him write the Shiba Inu smart contract and put up 10 ETH (which he described as \u201cnothing\u201d for this friend) to provide the initial liquidity for SHIB\u2019s Uniswap pool.\n\nFollowing this narrative, it appears to be a no-brainer. However, there\u2019s a catch, Ryoshi claims to have met this friend at Devcon 2019 in Osaka, and from what we know, Greco has been in the picture since at least 2017.\n\nDoes this mean Greco can not be Ryoshi? Not necessarily. It could also be that the supposed friend is not Buterin. Recall that Buterin has denied involvement in the creation of the project. Whatever the case, we may never know. The famous picture of Buterin walking a dog in Japan with other supposed ETH developers remains potentially the strongest clue to Ryoshi\u2019s identity."

        "title": "How to Navigate Etherscan - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "You probably know what Etherscan is, but you may not know how to use it. Let\u2019s take you under the hood to see how Ethereum works.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to understand the complicated mechanics of blockchain technology to use cryptocurrency. But learning a bit about how your transactions are processed can be illuminating and valuable.\n\nWith block explorers, you can see on-chain data in an organized format. To the untrained eye, all the alphanumeric digits and phrases may be overwhelming. Here is how you can begin navigating them.\n\nWhat Is a Block Explorer?\n\nA block explorer is a web interface for viewing activity on a blockchain network. It connects to a blockchain node, allowing users to retrieve information from the network \u2014 or even interact with it.\n\nA block explorer can fulfill several functions:\n\nSearch engine : to look up historical block data, transactions, gas prices, wallet addresses, smart contracts, and other on-chain data;\n\nAuditing platform : to verify smart contracts and look for suspicious activity;\n\nBlockchain API : to read (query), write (pass commands), or deploy new smart contracts on the blockchain; and\n\nAnalytics platform : to use the various data charts to analyze on-chain activity.\n\nEvery blockchain has one or multiple explorers, often maintained by outside developers. Some of the most popular include Blockchair for Bitcoin, PolygonScan for Polygon, the Cardano blockchain explorer, and the BNB Beacon Chain explorer.\n\nThis guide will explain the applications of blockchain explorers by benchmarking Etherscan, the most famous explorer in the Ethereum network. However, since most explorers follow a similar broad design, this guide should also help you understand transactions on other networks.\n\nFamiliarize Yourself With the Block Explorer\n\nThe Etherscan homepage provides an overview of recent activity on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nTransactions accepted during consensus form the block, while the demand for block space dictates the gas price.\n\nThe search field lets you look up any activity (transactions and blocks) or identity (addresses and smart contracts) on the blockchain. The transactions are stored with a unique identifier that represents a particular transaction (under \u201cLatest Transactions\u201d) called a hash.\n\nUnder the search bar, we find an overview of the Ethereum blockchain and the ETH token. The gas price, block time, and transactions per second (TPS) give an idea of the traffic on the blockchain. For example, high demand for block space increases block time (time taken to generate a block) and gas prices, while low demand decreases them.\n\nLet\u2019s look more closely at one of the blocks. To do so, click on any of the block number links.\n\nSome noteworthy tidbits:\n\nStatus : \u201cUnfinalized (Safe)\u201d means that at least two-thirds of the validators have validated the block. After the epoch (a period of just under 6.5 minutes) ends, the block becomes finalized.\n\nGas used : The block used 42.62% of its gas limit. Comparing this with subsequent blocks can give an idea about the on-chain traffic. (A simple ETH transfer typically costs 21,000 gas in moderate traffic. Users often pay several times more than that during peak traffic.)\n\nBlock reward and burnt fees : When the block burns more ETH than it mints as rewards, ETH becomes deflationary. Quite evidently, the ETH supply was inflationary in this block.\n\nNext, let\u2019s explore how a particular transaction looks. Click on any transaction link from the homepage or the \u201cTransactions\u201d row. (There are 131 in this block.)\n\nSome noteworthy details:\n\nStatus and block confirmations : The green tick represents a successful transaction. The probability of a block reorganization (an event where seemingly confirmed blocks of transactions are dropped in favor of a new chain of transactions) decreases as the number of block confirmations increases.\n\nInteracted with : This indicates which contracts the sender address interacted with during the transaction (in this case, the CryptoPunk NFT contract).\n\nSender and receiver addresses : You can reference these to cross-check if the correct address received the transaction.\n\nGas usage : This denotes how many gas units were consumed by the transaction. The gas fee is measured in Gwei and fluctuates with demand. (Use the Gas Tracker to find the latest price.)\n\nTip: Use the transaction decoder (More > Transaction decoder) for a streamlined summary of the transaction data.\n\nFind an Address\n\nEach wallet on Ethereum is associated with both a public and private address. The private address is used to sign transactions and is kept secret. The public address is derived from your private address; it is your on-chain identity and is used to receive transfers.\n\nNote: Smart contracts do not have any owner. Therefore, they only have a public address.\n\nHere is how a typical address page looks. It shows the ETH balance and a list of ERC-20 tokens the wallet holds. You can also view how the address interacts with other addresses and contracts on the blockchain.\n\nSome addresses use the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). ENS is a naming system that converts an alpha-numeric Ethereum address into a human-readable string. ENS names have \u201c.eth\u201d at the end. On the Etherscan homepage, go to \u201cMore > ENS Lookup\u201d to search ENS addresses.\n\nFollow the Money\n\nWhile writing data on the Ethereum blockchain costs gas, querying it does not. Users can access the entire transaction history of the network for free. Let\u2019s open a transaction overview and follow the money.\n\nThe overview page has all the details one might need to trace the movement of ETH or ERC-20 tokens. Necessary fields generally verified by users are transaction status, block confirmation (the higher, the more \u201cfinal\u201d), sender and receiver addresses, gas, and the transfer amount.\n\nNote: The Bitcoin network follows a different record-keeping model from Ethereum, called UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output). The balance in a Bitcoin wallet is the difference between spent and unspent transactions. Notice that the transaction has two recipients, with the second one as the sender itself receiving back the \u201cunspent\u201d BTC.\n\nInteract With and Analyze Smart Contracts\n\nBlockchain enthusiasts and developers can leverage Etherscan to learn about smart contracts, audit their code, and even interact with them using a wallet address. For example, check out the Uniswap V2 contract on Etherscan.\n\nThe transactions tab lists all the addresses that have interacted with the contract. Click on the \u201cContract\u201d tab to access the source code.\n\nThe green check mark on the tab means the source code has been verified to match the on-chain bytecode. Etherscan lets users interact with the contract in several ways:\n\nCode : Use this tab to verify or analyze smart contract code.\n\nRead contract : Smart contracts comprise several functions, and users can query these functions to watch how other addresses have interacted with the contract.\n\nWrite contract : Decentralized applications are accessed via their official website. Still, using Etherscan, you can also pass commands to those underlying smart contracts. Note that this will cost gas and require connecting Etherscan with a Web3 wallet like MetaMask.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nEtherscan is a valuable tool for exploring the Ethereum blockchain. You should now be empowered to navigate the block explorer. As you start monitoring the Ethereum blockchain regularly, you will notice block activity patterns that help you make more conscious decisions about when and how to make transactions."

        "content": "The global cryptocurrency market capitalization has declined by 2.16% over the past 24 hours to $1.07 trillion after witnessing a rally that saw the global market cap register $1.13 trillion at the back of a week of red trading.\n\nThe rally seemed rather brief as table-toppers Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) lost steam in daily trading, prompting several other altcoins to fluctuate in their prices. And while the industry grapples with the controversies surrounding the closure of US-based banks, Silvergate Capital, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank, new meme token Big Eyes Coin (BIG) has been steering its way toward its launch with several new and unique presale offers.\n\nBitcoin - Downward Correction Following 20% Rally\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the most popular digital asset in the cryptocurrency industry, slid by 0.67% in 24-hour trading to trade at $24,711.48 after a multi-day rally in which BTC registered a 90-day high of $26,514.72.\n\nDespite the price shed, Bitcoin was still indicating a weekly upward movement of 13.52%, prompted by a roughly 20% price rally shortly after the weekend. At the time of writing, Bitcoin held a market capitalization of $476 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $42.5 billion.\n\nEthereum - Weekend Rally Reversed\n\nEthereum (ETH), the industry\u2019s second-largest virtual cryptocurrency, has fallen by 2.83% overnight to trade at $1,659.86. Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum was also on a multi-day rally, having posted a 90-day high of $1,779.92 last week.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum was indicating a weekly growth of 7.97% and held a market capitalization of $203 trillion, a 2.82% decline from the previous day, while registering a 24-hour trading volume of $12.5 billion.\n\nBig Eyes Coin - Cute NFTs, BIG Returns\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is an Ethereum-powered meme token that self-propagates for its development using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) while offering its holders access to more content and events.\n\nThe project is currently having its Initial Coin Offer (ICO) and plans to launch after 15 stages of presale and achieves a target of $50 million presale tokens. Now in stage 12, Big Eyes Coin has raised $31.66 million in presale tokens, with a BIG token currently worth $0.00049, a 390% spike from its launch price of $0.0001.\n\nThe ERC-20 token has a total supply of 200 billion tokens, with 70% of it sold via its presale, 20% for exchanges, 5% added to a market wallet, and 5% held in a visible wallet which will be donated to several ocean-saving charities.\n\nAn ICO is a perfect opportunity for traders to expand their crypto portfolio and also invest in the token at a discounted price before it is available to the general public when it launches. Big Eyes Coin, which is a community-owned token, in its biggest giveaway to date, has launched the vault PIN \u2018300\u2019, which buyers simply have to enter when purchasing $100 or more worth of BIG presale tokens. This will allow the buyer to earn an additional 300% in Big Eyes Coin Loot Boxes.\n\nBig Eyes Coin Loot Boxes is the project\u2019s video game feature that can be found during gameplay, earned as a reward, or paid for with real money and offers a maximum return of 5000% per loot box. It features the Saver Tin, Cute Box, Kitty Vault, Super Saiyan Box, and Excali-Paw Master Chest, each carrying a maximum ROI of $500, $5000, $25,000, $100,000, and $1,000,000 worth of BIG tokens, respectively.\n\nThe Big Eyes Coin Loot Boxes run through during the presale only and will end when the project goes live. The results are always random, and the investment will never be lost since buyers will be returned their capital in BIG tokens if they do not win the loot box result.\n\nLearn more about Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/"

        "content": "Amid the hype surrounding the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade and the Arbitrum airdrop, co-founder Vitalik Buterin recommends crypto investors using social recovery wallets and multi-signature wallets to achieve self-custody of crypto funds. He also uses a multisig wallet personally to store his funds, as does the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nVitalik Buterin in a tweet on March 17 said self-custody is important in the crypto space. It has become even more crucial amid recent events experienced in the last year period. He suggests using social recovery wallets for normal daily activities and multisigs wallets for long-term savings.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cSelf-custody is important. And social recovery and multisig is a great way to do it. A quick reddit post on how I think about choosing guardians for social recovery and multisig wallets.\u201d\n\nVitalik Buterin on Using Multisig and Social Recovery Wallets\n\nAccording to the post, Vitalik Buterin recommends using multisig wallets such as Gnosis Safe to easily and securely store funds. He claims central entities that seemed trustworthy, but should not be trusted as they have significant risks such as regulatory pressure and human or system errors.\n\nSocial recovery wallets are easier to use than multisig wallets. With the ERC-4337 account abstraction and upcoming smart contracts wallets like Soul Wallet, wallet security will improve. Vitalik Buterin proposes to use social recovery for hot wallets that store a small portion of a person or organization\u2019s funds, and multisigs for cold wallets that store a person or organization\u2019s savings.\n\nMoreover, he also gave interesting suggestions on selecting guardians to improve the security of crypto funds by minimizing the chances of guardians losing keys, stealing money, and having shared risks with other guardians.\n\nReplying to a comment that says it is important to have guardians that know how to use a hardware wallet, which is better than storing keys in Metamask or Google Drive, Vitalik Buterin said:\n\n\u201cSome should use a hardware wallet but no need for all of them to imo. You don\u2019t want to freak out if you discover tomorrow that there\u2019s a serious issue with that one hardware wallet company that most of your friends buy from. But yeah, all your guardians using google drive or metamask is definitely something to avoid.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Spikes Over 10000% After A Day Of Massive Pullback\n\nShanghai upgrade and Arbitrum Airdrop\n\nTwo events related to Ethereum, the Shanghai upgrade and Arbitrum airdrop are creating a massive hype in the community.\n\nEthereum core developers revealed that the Shapella (Shanghai and Capella) upgrade on the mainnet is scheduled to happen at epoch 6209536 on April 12 at 10:27:35 PM UTC.

        "content": "Buy and sell Bitcoin the easy way Start your crypto portfolio today! Get started\n\nIn a big move to say thank you to those who saw the potential in the cat-themed coin and supported it from the onset, Big Eyes Coin (BIG) has announced that it will be hosting its very first NFT drop, and investors who came in stages 1\u20133 will be whitelisted to mint for free.\n\nBIG\u2019s announcement is supported by a generally optimistic prognosis for the overall cryptocurrency market, which appears to have recovered since the beginning of the week as a result of the U.S. government\u2019s action to safeguard Silicon Valley Bank depositors.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is up by 10% at $24,837.30, while Ethereum (ETH) rose by 7% to $1,690.09 at the time of writing.\n\nThe overall cryptocurrency market gained more than $70 billion in 24 hours and jumped back above $1 trillion on Monday.\n\nBig Eyes Coin To Drop First NFT\n\nBIG is proving that loyalty pays.\n\nThe cute currency will be releasing its first NFT, #SushiCrew, and in its usual fashion, it will be rewarding early investors with minting rights. These are those who bought into the coin\u2019s vision in stages 1-3. The meme coin informed investors through its Twitter page that its early investors will be whitelisted to mint the NFTs for free.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts can buy, sell, or trade NFTs, which are digital assets. They can grow in value in the future, thereby increasing the potential for wealth for token holders.\n\nBig Eyes offers a lot of incentives to its community, including vault pins that enable one to massively increase their bonuses (as if a bonus isn\u2019t enough), loot boxes, and more.\n\nBitcoin And Ethereum See Green Again\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has extended its three-day winning streak as the top cryptocurrency by market value increased to a three-week high of $24,837.30. Prices have almost entirely recovered from the decline from $25,000 to $19,500 that was observed in the second half of February.\n\nFrom their lows on Friday, Bitcoin and Ether, the two most popular coins, have increased by a fifth as traders gained confidence from US regulators\u2019 assurances that accounts at the bankrupt Silicon Valley and Signature banks will be safeguarded. Bitcoin increased by 6% just on Monday.\n\nInvestor confidence has increased as a result of the authorities\u2019 actions to support SVB and safeguard depositors in these institutions.\n\nCryptocurrency Losing Some Of Its Big Supporters\n\nThe crypto markets have been on a rollercoaster ride since Silvergate Capital, a significant lender to the cryptocurrency industry, collapsed last week.\n\nMid-last week, Silvergate announced that it was closing its bank and reducing staff. Then, on Friday, Silicon Valley Bank fell, marking the largest banking failure since the global financial crisis of 2008. In response to the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s increase in interest rates, both Silvergate and SVB invested money in U.S. Treasury bonds, which have since lost value.\n\nIn order to prevent the spread of the problem to the larger banking industry, U.S. regulators also shut down Signature Bank on Sunday. Signature Bank was a significant lender in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAlthough the crypto industry was hit by the news of some of its friendly banks collapsing, we are beginning to see the market rebound, a testament to its resilience. On the other hand, Big Eyes Coin continues to expand its offering, both to the existing community and to potential investors. The coin just crossed the $31.57 million mark in its presale, and with only three stages left, BIG is on course for a successful launch.\n\nFind Out More About Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the author should not be considered as financial advice.

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has emphasized the importance of having a varied set of \u201cguardians\u201d to maximize the safety of crypto asset self-custody via multisig and social recovery wallets.\n\nGiven the ever-growing rate of crypto scams and hacks over the past few years, and several major crypto firms going bust in 2022, self-custody and maintaining sufficient wallet safety procedures have never been more critical.\n\nIn a March 16 Reddit post on the r/ethereum community titled \u201cHow I think about choosing guardians for multisig and social recovery wallets,\u201d Buterin gave a detailed run down of how he approaches wallet security.\n\nSelf-custody is important. And social recovery and multisig is a great way to do it.\n\n\n\nA quick reddit post on how I think about choosing guardians for social recovery and multisig wallets:https://t.co/FY1iyJ6BFC \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) March 17, 2023\n\nWhile their structures differ, multisig and social recovery wallets rely on guardians, which serve as external sources to recover funds or approve transactions. Generally, guardians can be sets of external wallets belonging to the same individual or addresses controlled by other people or entities.\n\nAccording to Buterin, it\u2019s important to decentralize wallet guardians, as owning more than one of your guardians provides a \u201ctricky tradeoff: you get to trust other people less, but you\u2019re also concentrating more power into yourself, which can create a risk if you get hacked, coerced, or incapacitated or die.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy rule of thumb is that enough guardians should be controlled by other people that if you disappear there are enough other guardians left to recover your funds.\u201d\n\nButerin went on to advise that someone\u2019s set of guardians should not know of each other, as this \u201cgreatly reduces the risk that they collude\u201d to attack their wallets and assets. However, they should still be able to find each other in case something happens to the wallet owner.\n\nComments on Buterin\u2019s post. Source: Reddit\n\n\u201cIf something happens to you, they will still be able to find each other, because there are obvious standard protocols that naturally come to people\u2019s minds in such a situation (e.g. contact your family),\u201d he wrote.\n\nAdditionally, the Ethereum co-founder suggested that people should \u201cinstruct guardians to ask a security question\u201d that only they and the guardian will know when confirming an operation \u2014 and only confirmed when the correct answer is given.\n\nRelated: DeFi sees its biggest hack in 2023 as Euler loses $197M: Finance Redefined\n\nFor degen traders or those not making long-term hodl plays, the Ethereum co-founder also stressed that they should use guardians that can respond quickly to suit their fast-moving needs.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re doing degen stuff with on-chain contracts, you may need to act quickly: pull money out if a contract gets a vulnerability, move money around if you are close to being liquidated, etc. If your needs include this, then you want to find guardians who can act quickly on short notice.\u201d\n\nFinally, Buterin recommended testing each guardian at least once a year, as this will confirm that they \u201chaven\u2019t forgotten or lost their accounts.\u201d\n\nGiven the ever-growing rate of crypto scams and hacks over the past few years, and several crypto firms going bust last year, maintaining sufficient wallet safety procedures has never been more important."

        "content": "Down more than 81% from its all-time high and yet up by more than 88% since the beginning of 2023, Coinbase Global (COIN 0.78%) is in a peculiar position. Benefiting from the recent rally in the crypto market, Coinbase's price jumped significantly in the past few months as a renewed sense of optimism has investors hoping that the worst might just be over.\n\nHowever, there is reason to believe that bumpy and dangerous roads are ahead.\n\nAfter a tumultuous and controversial 2022, which was riddled with multiple cryptocurrency companies going bankrupt, U.S. regulators have ratcheted up pressure on the crypto industry as a whole. This could be bad news for Coinbase.\n\nRegulators turn up the heat\n\nAt the beginning of February, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reached a settlement with the cryptocurrency exchange platform Kraken after alleging that their staking service met the criteria of an unregistered security. As a result, Kraken was forced to discontinue its staking product and pay a $30 million fine.\n\nMore recently, the New York Attorney General introduced a lawsuit with KuCoin, another cryptocurrency exchange. Similar to the SEC-Kraken case, the state of New York alleges that KuCoin's staking products are technically unregistered securities and, as such, are currently out of compliance.\n\nFurthermore, the New York AG took the allegations a step further and claimed that not only were the staking products technically securities, but that the world's second-most valuable cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH 1.31%), also met the criteria of a security.\n\nThis is where things could get particularly troublesome for Coinbase.\n\nThe staking problem\n\nTo diversify revenue outside of just transaction fees, Coinbase has prioritized building out its staking services and intends to become \"the best platform to generate rewards on crypto.\"\n\nPotentially even worse for Coinbase is the New York AG's allegations that Ethereum is technically a security. If this is judged to be true, it could deal a serious blow to Coinbase's future profits.\n\nThe reason is due to a planned Ethereum upgrade scheduled for 2023 and Coinbase's dependence on the cryptocurrency to generate revenue.\n\nThe new upgrade, known as Shanghai, would allow those who stake Ethereum to withdraw their funds. Currently, users are unable to do so, and as a result, the number of users who stake Ethereum is drastically lower than other proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies which allow withdrawals, like Cardano or Solana.\n\nIn a recent report by J.P. Morgan, analysts found that around 25% of all trading volume on Coinbase is Ethereum-based. The company generates roughly $50 million from clients currently staking the cryptocurrency. J.P. Morgan analysts continued that with the promise of Shanghai looming, Coinbase could significantly bolster profits if it leads to an increase in users looking to utilize the exchange for their staking needs.\n\nJ.P. Morgan estimated that on the low end, profits could increase to $225 million and possibly even up to $545 million if 95% of retail investors currently using the platform decide to stake their Ethereum.\n\nBut this could all come crashing down. There are arguably too many question marks around Coinbase's Ethereum staking. It's a potentially significant moneymaking project, but regulators have to pin down their approach to this stuff to make it an investable quality. If Ethereum is deemed a security in the New York case and the SEC decides to zero in on Coinbase, it could deal a serious blow to Coinbase's future revenue growth.\n\nWhile much remains unknown in the regulatory environment, it might be best to hold off on adding any Coinbase to portfolios until a clearer picture comes into focus. There are plenty of alternatives available to crypto investors who want a proper stock in the digital asset sector, after all."

        "content": "Negative swings in the market price of Ethereum may have had a material impact on the company\u2019s earnings and carrying value.\n\nPLBY Group (NASDAQ: PLBY) has announced that it lost about $4.9 million in the value of the Ethereum (ETH) assets it held last year. The parent company of Hugh Hefner\u2019s Playboy confirms that the impairment loss came as a result of the crypto winter that swept through the industry and significantly impacted market prices across the board.\n\nPLBY Group Gives Analysis, Claims Impairment Losses May Not Be Recovered\n\nAccording to a recent filing, the lifestyle and media company says it was accepting Ethereum as payments for its \u201cRabbitars\u201d non-fungible tokens (NFTs). And these assets, it holds as digital assets in its balance sheet, says PLBY Group. The filing, however, reveals that the value of its digital assets was $327,000 as of last year. Whereas, an earlier filing on September 30 had valued the company\u2019s digital assets at $1.75 million.\n\nDespite the discrepancies, the company says it operates with the concept that its digital assets are \u201cindefinite-lived intangible assets,\u201d and are subject to impairment losses. That is, the fair value of the assets may fall below their carrying value at any time.\n\nPLBY also explains further that such impairment losses on digital assets may not be recovered. That is even if the fair value of the assets rises again after taking the hit. Part of the filing reads:\n\n\u201cTherefore, negative swings in the market price of Ethereum could have a material impact on the company\u2019s earnings and carrying value.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the company also revealed the only time a price rise can potentially impact its earnings positively. According to the filing, this can only happen when the Ethereum it holds in its balance sheet, is sold at a gain.\n\nSince PLBY launched its \u201cRabbitar\u201d NFT project in October 2021, Ethereum has lost about 60% in value, per TradingView data.\n\nIt might be worth noting that the Rabbitars NFT is not Playboy\u2019s first foray into the NFT space. Before launching the project, the company carried out an NFT drop called \u201cLiquid Summer\u201d in early 2021.\n\nPlayboy is also keen on blockchain technology. It first delved into the blockchain technology industry in 2018. That was when Playboy TV started accepting bitcoin payments before later expanding to Playboy.com in June. The company also announced its MetaMansion project in February, signaling its intent to move to the metaverse."

Source: Ycharts\n\nThe chart above demonstrates the inconsistent nature of Ethereum gas fees and their tendency to spike.\n\nThe launch of BASE is set to introduce Web 3.0 solutions and networks to a whole new audience of users. Coinbase has an estimated 110 million verified users and US$80 billion worth of assets locked on its platform. The launch of BASE is potentially a watershed mainstream moment for the layer 2 space and it now appears to be cemented into the crypto consciousness. BASE arrives with the layer 2 space booming. One important feature of layer 2s is that they are designed to maximize the blockchain User Experience (UX) which is a perfect fit for Coinbase, a platform that has made crypto accessible for millions.\n\nL2beat, a layer 2 analytics platform, says that over the last year the US dollar value locked on Ethereum layer 2 platforms has risen from US$4.1 billion to US$6.2 billion, a ~51% rise. The amount locked onto layer 2s has also risen in ETH terms from ~3.45 million ETH to 3.96 million ETH, an ~15% increase. L2beat does not include the Polygon network, an Ethereum scaling solution, which many technologists state is not a \u2018true\u2019 layer 2. If we add Polygon\u2019s TVL to this mix, the layer 2 TVL then becomes ~US$7.3 billion.\n\nCurrently, the top layer 2 platforms in the world are Ethereum-focused, but platforms such as Stacks, which is focused on building scaling solutions for the Bitcoin blockchain, are growing in popularity. The layer 2 solutions space is being developed rapidly.\n\nSince August 2022, transaction activity on Arbitrum, the top Ethereum layer-2 platform, has surged.\n\nThe wider trend for Ethereum, the base chain that Arbitrum supports, is much more flat and apart from a few isolated spikes, the daily transaction activity for Ethereum is marginally lower than it was 18 months ago.\n\nArbitrum transactions exceed Ethereum\u2019s \u2013 Source L2Beat.com\n\nOn February 22nd, the total number of transactions on the Ethereum chain hit 100,080,869. On Arbitrum on the same day, the total number of transactions was 100,103,187. This has not happened since or before but indicates that daily transactions on a single layer 2 can top those on the base chain.\n\nThere are forecasts that eventually layer 2s will replace Ethereum as the platforms for everyday transactions while Ethereum will maintain utility as a settlement/verification layer. What happened on February 22nd, is a clear indication that this future is possible.\n\nTypes of Layer 2 Solutions\n\nTrue Layer 2s\n\nOptimistic Rollups \u2013 This is the technology that supports the two most popular \u2018True\u2019 Roll-up solutions, Arbtitrum and Optimism. Like other layer 2 solutions, Optimistic Rollups reduce computation on the Ethereum chain by processing transactions and state-storage off-chain.\n\nOptimistic rollup operators bundle multiple off-chain transactions together in large batches before submitting them to the Ethereum main chain. This method enables the spread of fixed costs across multiple transactions. Rolling them up into batches reduces fees and the compression techniques used also reduce the amount of data posted on Ethereum.\n\nOptimistic roll-ups are called \u2018Optimistic\u2019 because they assume the transactions they shift off-chain are valid. There is no onchain proof of validity.\n\nArbitrium and Optimism makeup over 80% of the Layer 2 market share.\n\nZero-Knowledge Rollups \u2013 This is the solution used by dYdX, Loopring, and ZkSync Lite. ZK roll-ups in many ways are similar to Optimistic Roll-ups, Zero Knowledge roll-ups publish cryptographic proofs-of-validity for off-chain transactions. Operators of ZK rollup chains submit validity proofs to the main chain that demonstrate with cryptographic certainty that the proposed changes to Ethereum\u2019s state are due to a batch of valid transactions that were processed off-chain.\n\nZKrollups are inherently more secure but because they are less scalable they have been less popular. Optimism can process larger batches of transactions more quickly. It is also more popular because it is easier to implement and operate.\n\nValidium \u2013 A more niche solution that is used by a number of EVM-based Dapps including Immutable X, ApeX, Sorare. Validium, like Zk-Rollups, proves the validity of transactions with Zero-Knowledge proofs; it does not store transaction data on-chain, which significantly reduces the amount the Validium contract interacts with the Ethereum mainnet. Storing data transactions has trade-offs like security, but significantly increases throughput and scalability. Validium\u2019s throughput is reportedly comparable to Optimism and is said to be able to process ~9000 transactions per second.\n\nForks and Hybrids (Optimistic chains like Metis) \u2013 There are a few forks of layer 2 solutions that add modifications designed to optimize the original solutions. An example of this is the Metis platform, launched by MetisDAO. Metis propose that they offer a best-of-both-worlds solution, combining the scalability of Optimistic roll-ups with the security of Zero-Knowledge proofs. Metis has its own suite of unique dapps like Hummus exchange (a fork of platypus finance) and Hermes (a fork of Solidly).\n\nSidechains\n\nPolygon \u2013 A scaling solution that is in a category of its own. Polygon is actually a variety of scaling layers built with a Polygon infrastructure that has built a technology to communicate with Ethereum. The most popular is the Polygon Proof-of-Stake (PoS) sidechain that is currently live and actively used. Polygon PoS supports faster and cheaper transactions for the Ethereum main chain by running a parallel sidechain, with its own consensus model and token, which periodically checks in with the base chain for security purposes. Polygon\u2019s scaling technology is supported by Plasma.\n\nPrice performance of Layer-2 tokens\n\nOptimism (OP) \u2013 Price at the start of the year \u2013 US$0.917, Price now \u2013 US$2.47.

        "content": "In a recent blog post on Reddit, Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin emphasised on self-custody of funds through Multisig wallets and Social Recovery wallets to ensure the safety of funds, instead of handing them over to a \u201ccentralized entity\u201d.\n\nSelf-custody is important. And social recovery and multisig is a great way to do it.\n\n\n\nA quick reddit post on how I think about choosing guardians for social recovery and multisig wallets:https://t.co/FY1iyJ6BFC \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) March 17, 2023\n\nHis statement is coming amidst the ongoing devastation in crypto-friendly banks such as Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, to name a few, and the collapse of centralised crypto firms including FTX, Voyager Digital, and others.\n\nVitalik stated in a blog post, \u201cI use a multisig wallet personally to store the bulk of my funds, as does the Ethereum Foundation.\u201d\n\nMultisig wallets are digital wallets that require the approval of all authorised members to sign transactions through signature. It means no single owner can get access to funds. On the other hand, funds locked in social recovery wallets can be recovered by a group of keys held by other people if the main key gets lost.\n\nHe said social recovery wallets are more incorporative than multisig with ERC-4337 account abstraction and upcoming wallets like Soul Wallet. ERC-4337 is the recently deployed smart contract on the Ethereum network and is expected to boost mainstream crypto adoption.\n\nBoth types of wallets rely on \u201cguardians,\u201d which are individuals or entities holding keys that can approve transactions or recover funds.\n\n\u201cMy recommendation will be to use social recovery for hot wallets that store a small portion of a person or organization\u2019s funds, and multisigs for cold wallets that store a person or organizations\u2019s savings,\u201d he added.\n\nIn a post, he shared guidance to choose guardians, in which he stated"

        "title": "Meme Coin Star, Big Eyes Coin, Surpasses Ethereum and Theta Network Presale Records - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has witnessed numerous presale events, but those of Ethereum and Theta will continue to stand out from the rest. Both presale events generated about $19 million, with Ethereum (ETH) setting the record in 2015 and Theta (THETA) matching it in 2017. Now Big Eyes Coin (BIG), the meme coin that rocked late 2022, has generated more than $25 million in its presale, surpassing mother blockchain Ethereum\u2019s 2015 record. Read on to find out more about the alluring feline meme coin and join the presale while you can.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) blockchain was developed in 2015 to provide a better relatable crypto platform for easier transactions, as Bitcoin was disappearing out of sight in terms of value. The Ethereum blockchain promised a more extensive, feature-packed protocol that gave users and developers opportunities to get the best out of their crypto journeys.\n\nEthereum (ETH) initially launched with a proof of work protocol similar to Bitcoin\u2019s code. The code base allowed users to mine ETH tokens while they received rewards. As the protocol got more popular and DApps increased, the need for supplementary networks arose, and platforms like Polygon were used to improve the quality of blockchain services on Ethereum.\n\nThe desired move to a proof of stake occurred in 2022, as the developers moved the entire blockchain to a PoS code that promised faster transactions at lower gas fees. The move has also improved the platform\u2019s security, as users can stake their ETH assets to better Ethereum\u2019s security.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has delivered on every metric as it has profound involvement in key crypto sectors. Its NFT trade sector is the largest, with a capitalization of over $500 million and its blockchain is host to numerous Metaverse platforms and tokens, propagating Decentralized Finance all over the crypto space.\n\nEthereum (ETH) currently sells for about $1,671.84 on CoinMarketCap.\n\nTheta Network (THETA)\n\nTheta Network (THETA) is the only blockchain solution available that upgrades video quality for its users. The platform uses several DApps to increase the bandwidth available for video streaming. Edgecast, a notable Ethereum DApp, enables users to contribute their bandwidth to enhance video sharing and streaming.\n\nTheta initially existed on the Ethereum network, where its access to the many DApps caused its success before and after the presale. The platform moved to an independent blockchain, in 2019, where it runs on a Byzantine Fault Tolerance protocol, a variation of the conventional proof of stake protocol. The BFT protocol allows for faster transactions, as it uses a small unit of validators who work round the clock to validate transaction blocks.\n\nTheta Network (THETA) has two tokens used to run the platform. There is the non-tradable TFUEL token that runs the network\u2019s economics by functioning as fuel, and THETA token that is used to vote on protocol changes and the platform\u2019s future. The THETA is tradable and listed on various exchanges on the cryptocurrency market.\n\nTHETA is available on CoinMarketCap for about $1.17.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is a cat-meme token that sought to dominate the meme coin sector in the crypto space. The coin started its presale in September, during the crypto collapse, and is edging closer to the launch date. Unlike many meme coin platforms, Big Eyes (BIG) boasts a value-packed protocol that ensures users within its meme community access some of the benefits of DeFi.\n\nBig Eyes\u2019 most notable feature is the anticipated Sushi Crew project. Sushi Crew is an NFT marketplace where users will be able to create, mint, and trade their NFTs. The developers have decided to have NFT trades at no cost, thus relieving users of the enormous Ethereum gas fees, as the token will launch on the Ethereum blockchain. The NFTs will keep projects like a Metaverse within sight for future upgrades.\n\nBig Eyes (BIG) also plans to host a supportive community where every user contributes to the token\u2019s plans and has a stake in its future. The developers also plan to help newbie users with tutorials to put them through the basics of DeFi and its principles. This will help make the community more close-knit, a common feature of successful crypto projects.\n\nThe final days are here, and we expect the launch date anytime. Click here to buy your BIG tokens and join the already-growing Big Eyes (BIG) community.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "According to a criminal record report published by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, cryptocurrency investment scams increased from 907 million dollars in 2021 to 2.5 billion dollars in 2022, which is a 183% rise. The FBI also stated that the crypto investment scams saw an unprecedented rise in the number of victims in 2022, and Most of the victims assumed huge debt to cover losses from these fraudulent investments. As per the FBI report, the crypto fraudsters targeted people ages 30-49. The FBI noted in its report that the scams were socially engineered and trust-enabled. Most of the scams began with romance or confidence and later evolved into cryptocurrency investment fraud, the report mentioned.\n\nThe crypto community is being introduced to various new cybercrimes every day. This emphasizes the importance of having a safe vault to protect crypto investments. Lockyourcrypto.com is one such digital fortress that provides crypto investors with a highly-secured place to keep their valuable digital assets away from cybercriminals.\n\nBitcoin And Ethereum Rise\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are the two major icons of the crypto world. Even People who do not know about cryptocurrencies and their values are aware of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The influence of these currencies reaches beyond the virtual world and affects the ordinary man in our real world.\n\nThough both coins are regarded as the most credible and valuable digital assets in the market, they suffered a week-long downtrend in the market in March. Between March 9-14, the price of BTC fell below $20K and rose to $26K. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at around $24,800.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, also stumbled in the market in the past week. ETH price slumped below $1,300 and rose to $1,700 over the past 7 days. It was trading at around $1,600, at the time of writing.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained 15% and 8.52% respectively over the past seven days.\n\nThis volatile nature of the crypto market can make a weak-handed person panic sell their stocks which could result in loss or reduced profit. Lockyourcrypto.com has a perfect feature for these weak-handed investors to control their paper hand and increase their chance to earn more.\n\nLockyourcrypto.com \u2013 A Digital Fortress\n\nThe crypto industry has two types of wallets called non-custodial wallets and custodial wallets. With non-custodial or self-custodial wallets, the investors will have control of their private keys and cryptocurrency holdings. They will be responsible for maintaining security measures to protect their crypto funds.\n\nNon-custodial wallet users will need a backup mechanism to use if they forget the private keys. They can employ Cold wallets or hardware wallets, which are in physical form and can store the private keys offline. Since these physical wallets can be stolen and broken, they are also not safe.\n\nBut with custodial wallets, a third party like Lockyourcrypto.com will be in control of your private keys. Many investors prefer custodial wallets as they don\u2019t wish to risk forgetting their private keys and losing their entire investments.\n\nLockyourcrypto.com protects your private keys in multilayer security. It uses a password pin or fingerprint authentication to eliminate unauthorized access to the vault.\n\nThe users will need to log in to the Lockyourcrypto.com platform to transfer their digital assets to the vault. After transferring the funds, the users can choose the time frame for the funds to be locked up. This lock-up feature would help weak-handed investors to control their paper hands during market volatility. The added advantage of the lock-up time frame is that depositors can not withdraw or transfer this fund during this period except in case of an emergency.\n\nLockyourcrypto.com platform uses high-level encryption to protect funds from cyber attacks. It also ensures the privacy of the depositors.\n\nAlong with all these safety measures, investors should be aware of various forms of cyberattacks in the crypto industry to avoid falling prey to such scams in the future.\n\nCheck it out at the links below:\n\nWebsite: www.Lockyourcrypto.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Lockyourcrypto\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Not Just A Meme: Big Eyes Coin's Presale Is Reminiscent Of Early Successes Of Ethereum And Filecoin - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Within the crypto market, there is always an interest in what could be the new big thing on the scene. And if current indications are anything to go by, the new meme coin sensation Big Eyes Coin (BIG) could be just that. Amid a blistering presale, it\u2019s generating numbers that could draw legitimate comparisons to Ethereum (ETH) and Filecoin (FIL).\n\nPresales are useful to investors and cryptos alike. They help investors in knowing how a coin could be potentially trading on the crypto market, and likewise, coins can assess what kind of impact they could have. This is where Big Eyes Coin will be looking to carve its name. It\u2019s enjoying a presale of historical magnitude, and the project will look to use this as a springboard for better things once the meme coin enters the crypto market and begins trading on the live market.\n\nNot Just A Meme, But A Community That Believes In Itself\n\nBig Eyes Coin has sustained itself through a strong emphasis on its community and has shown that it\u2019s no laughing matter. Meme coins can be contagious, and Big Eyes Coin is quickly spreading in the crypto community as a new crypto to watch out for.\n\nMeme coins are not always taken seriously, given the warm and laid-back nature of these tokens. They have introduced an element of humour to the crypto market by connecting the crypto industry to the internet meme culture. This is often why many meme coins will have strong communities behind them, and Big Eyes is an example of this.\n\nThis can include integrating those holding BIG tokens into its decision-making process or hosting friendly competitions on Twitter to promote a sense of community by webbing people together.\n\nWhat it has done is result in a truly spectacular presale that is still not finished. The feline coin has been trading exceptionally well as it entered Stage 12 in pursuit of its $50m target. It is more than halfway there, having generated more than $31m in sales. Even during a bearish market, Big Eyes Coin has found ways to continue attracting investors to its platform.\n\nBig Eyes Coin\u2019s Loot Boxes Is A Token Boon\n\nIt\u2019s worth looking at why Big Eyes Coin does well in its presales and how this ties in with its emphasis on community. If the two weren\u2019t linked, you might wonder why BIG cares so much about creating a community. Yet the two are related and exist in symbiosis. Big Eyes Coin has done well, at least in part, because it prioritises its community.\n\nAn example of this is its loot boxes. These are mystery gifts sealed in boxes that are acquired through purchases, and Big Eyes Coin has provided four of them. First, there is the Cute Box which offers a maximum reward of $100. The Kitty Vault follows this with the possibility of earning $25k from it in BIG tokens. The next box is the Super Saiyan Box which offers you a mouthwatering $100k in tokens. And if you thought that was amazing, wait until you hear about its final box. The Excali-Paw Master Chest brings with it a possible $1m in BIG tokens.\n\nAnd here is the best bit about these boxes. They\u2019re designed so that you cannot make a loss on them. The lowest offering of tokens in each loot box is equal to what you pay to acquire them. Every other possible reward within each box trumps what you pay, meaning you cannot make a loss on them. This is an example of the steps Big Eyes Coin has taken to cultivate a relationship of trust with potential investors and encourage them to begin trading for BIG tokens and come to regard it as the next big token in the crypto market.\n\nThere Are Comparisons To Be Made Between Ethereum And Filecoin\n\nBig Eyes Coin has been a glowing presale success that outstrips the performances of many other coins. It has established itself as the next big thing on the meme coin scene, and its numbers are comparable to that of Ethereum and Filecoin. For example, more than seven million ETH tokens were sold in the immediate hours of its presales. These tokens were worth over $2.2m.\n\nFilecoin performed as vibrantly as it produced around $52m in its presales. Considering Big Eyes Coin is well on its way to achieving its target of $50m, there is more than one good reason to see why its supporters are giddy with excitement when you consider the successes of Ethereum and Filecoin since going live.\n\nIf you are excited about what Big Eyes Coin is doing and would like to know more, then visit the links below!\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BigEyesCoin\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ethereum Shanghai upgrade goes live April 12; Will ETH hit $2,000? - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) investors are inching closer to accessing their staked ETH after the network\u2019s developers announced a new possible date for the highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade.\n\nIndeed, Ethereum\u2019s core developers, in a meeting on March 16, set the date of April 12 for the crucial Shanghai-Capella upgrade, also known as Shapella, on the main network.\n\nAccording to the developers, the Shapella upgrade was successfully launched on the Goerli testnet as the final dress rehearsal before the mainnet launch. The upgrade is scheduled to take place at 10:27 a.m. UTC on April 12, with epoch number 620,9536.\n\nThe highlight of the upgrade is Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4895, which will enable validator staking withdrawals on the main network, a critical feature that was not included during Ethereum\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus last September after the Merge upgrade.\n\nFurthermore, the Shapella upgrade will include three additional improvements to optimize gas costs for specific activities. Ahead of the withdrawals, the developers have previously conducted various public testing phases on three tests since February, including Sepolia, Zhejiang, and Goerli.\n\nETH withdrawals from their respective validator sets were also successfully processed on all three testnets.\n\nImpact on ETH\u2019s price\n\nThere are projections that the Shanghai upgrade will likely have a positive impact on Ethereum\u2019s price, considering that before the Merge upgrade, there was a significant influx of capital, which appeared to be a case of \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news.\u201d\n\nWith the Shanghai upgrade set to introduce more staking options, analysts view it as a positive development for Ethereum\u2019s value. The possibility of driving Ethereum\u2019s value higher is further validated by the fact that the upgrade will give room to the release of staked ETH, a possible bullish trigger.\n\nAt the same time, one of the Merge upgrades long term projected benefits is the introduction of institutional investors on the platform.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nIn the meantime, Ethereum has been trading in tandem with the general market. Amid the current market rally, Ethereum has capitalized by breaching the $1,700 resistance level. By press time, Ethereum was trading at $1,723 with weekly gains of over 20%.\n\nEthereum seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nIf the upcoming upgrade acts as a bullish aspect for Ethereum, it will be a crucial foundation for the second-ranked cryptocurrency by market cap to target reclaiming $2,000. On the flip side, Ethereum faces the possibility of retesting the $1,500 position, which is acting as a key support level.\n\nAdditionally, the regulatory impact on staking activities will likely also have an impact on the value of Ethereum.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Listen to this article.\n\nParent of Hugh Hefner\u2019s Playboy, PLBY Group, has disclosed a loss of $4.9 million on the Ethereum it held last year \u2014 citing a crypto winter as the cause.\n\nPlayboy\u2019s NFT collection, Rabbitars, launched in 2021 at the peak of the NFT craze. According to its 10-K form filed on Thursday, the value of its digital assets was $327,000 as of last year. But in September 2022, PLBY\u2019s filings showed a value of $1.75 million in digital assets.\n\nIndeed, since Rabbitars were released two years ago, the price of ether has plummeted over 60%.\n\nPLBY considers its digital assets as \u201cindefinite-lived intangible assets.\u201d\n\nThey are subject to impairment losses if the fair value of assets falls below carrying value at any time.\n\nImpairment losses can\u2019t be recovered \u2014 even if fair value increases once more.\n\n\u201cThe market price of one Ethereum in our principal market ranged from $964 \u2013 $3,813 during the year ended December 31, 2022, but the carrying value of each Ethereum we held at the end of the reporting period reflects the lowest price of one Ethereum quoted on the active exchange at any time since its receipt,\u201d PLBY explained in its filing.\n\n\u201cTherefore, negative swings in the market price of Ethereum could have a material impact on the company\u2019s earnings and carrying value, while only time a rise in prices will impact the company\u2019s earnings positively, is when the Ethereum held in the balance sheet, are sold at a gain,\u201d the filing said.\n\nPlayboy has been crypto curious for years\n\nPlayboy has actually had a long history with NFTs, Bitcoin, and blockchain. In 2018, it planned to integrate a crypto token called Vice Industry Token (VIT) onto its platforms. VIT would have been used to reward viewers for watching its content, leaving comments, and voting.\n\nIt even planned to introduce a crypto wallet on its websites. However, the Canadian blockchain startup it partnered with to make it happen, Global Blockchain Technologies (GBT) was sued by Playboy for fraud and breaching contract.\n\nRead more: NBA Top Shot NFTs could be unregistered securities, judge says\n\nPlayboy has also released archival photographs and magazine covers as non-fungible tokens, featuring celebs like model Lenna Sj\u00f6\u00f6blom and Burt Reynolds.\n\nIts own Rabbitar series has dwindled in value since 2021 \u2014 some owners are selling their digital collectibles for over 1,000 ether, but offers hover around 0.06 WETH on OpenSea. Floor price for Rabbitars is 0.07 ETH at press time.\n\nFor more informed news, follow us on Twitter, Instagram, and Google News or subscribe to our YouTube channel."

        "content": "In a landmark move for the world of cryptocurrency, the supply of Ethereum has been reduced by 66,000 ETH in 2023, according to the information shared by market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock published on March 18.\n\nThis comes as a result of Ethereum\u2019s \u2018Merge\u2018 transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus that took place in September 2022. With the new consensus mechanism, a fraction of ETH transaction fees is being burnt. This made Ethereum deflationary.\n\nIn 2023, the supply of Ethereum reduced by 66k $ETH due to burning a fraction of transaction fees. This move has made Ethereum deflationary, which is great news for crypto enthusiasts seeking scarce digital assets. #Ethereum #deflation pic.twitter.com/2RuwiioffW \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) March 18, 2023\n\nFor those who are not familiar with the term, a deflationary currency is one where the supply of currency decreases over time. This is in contrast to inflationary currencies, which see the supply of currency increase over time.\n\nNotably, deflationary currencies are particularly attractive to crypto enthusiasts who are seeking scarce digital assets, as they believe that scarcity can drive up the value of an asset.\n\nApril\u2019s Shanghai upgrade\n\nIt is worth mentioning that another highly anticipated Shanghai-Capella upgrade, also known as the Shapella upgrade is scheduled to go live on April 12, 2023.\n\nThe most notable aspect of this upgrade is Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4895, which will introduce validator staking withdrawals to the main network. This is a crucial feature that was left out during Ethereum\u2019s shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus in September last year, following the Merge upgrade.\n\nAs of the time of writing, the ETH price is hovering around $1,816.52 per coin. The asset\u2019s price registered solid growth in the last 7 days, rising by 26%."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) vs Bitcoin (BTC) - Which is the Best Cryptocurrency? - Crypto Economy",
        "content": "In our previous articles, we compared the three best altcoins \u2013 Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA). In this post we move forward into the magnificent world of cryptocurrencies to draw a detailed analysis of the two crypto heavyweights \u2013 Ethereum (ETH)vs Bitcoin (BTC). As we dive deep into their details, it will become easier to understand which is the best cryptocurrency.\n\nFor the longest time, investments have been limited to assets such as real estate, gold, bank deposits, and stocks. However, over the past few years, a new investment asset class called \u201cCryptocurreny\u201d has garnered immense popularity among investors and traders all across the world. This latest form of asset has been doling out good returns for its investors, promising to disrupt the monopolistic traditional financial ecosystem. Suddenly, from global conglomerates to street artists, everybody wants a piece of this action.\n\nCryptocurrency \u2013 A Financial Revolution\n\nThe saga of this new financial revolution started with the inception of Bitcoin (BTC) in 2009. Since then, the popularity of cryptocurrencies immediately took off with scores of other digital tokens getting launched one after another. The growing popularity of these digital assets in the past decade and the recent acceptance of Bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender in El Salvador suggest that there is growing acceptance of these instruments and that cryptocurrencies are here to stay.\n\nComparatively new, Ethereum (ETH) which was launched in 2015 took the crypto industry by storm becoming the second most valuable cryptocurrency after Bitcoin (BTC). Soon, both the tokens gained astronomical traction becoming the \u201cCoca- Cola and Pepsi\u201d of the crypto universe. Over the past couple of years both the digital tokens have witnessed substantial price growth, attracting infinite new investors all around the globe to the burgeoning crypto industry.\n\nThus, gaining knowledge about the differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum will allow us to know exactly which cryptocurrency best suit the need of each investor. In order to understand the digital tokens in depth, we need to start from the beginning. Let us begin by looking at their history.\n\nBrief History of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is known to be the biggest and oldest coin in the crypto world. It was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The primary purpose of Bitcoin was to establish itself as a viable alternative to traditional fiat currencies backed by countries.\n\nThis means, it is basically a store of value and often used as a medium of exchange. Since its well-known globally, this coin has been leading the market for the past decade. Over the years, it has experienced several major surges, and each time it has broken records, touching new all-time highs.\n\nThe digital coin has also experienced a fair share of ups and down during its journey till date. In 2017, Bitcoin\u2019s price skyrocketed enabling the crypto industry to forge a ground-breaking financial renaissance as well as gain its own identity. However, following the rally, a massive correction took place dragging Bitcoin (BTC) to be termed as a bubble, and a failed asset. Several people predicted the crypto industry would come to an end.\n\nDespite the negative sentiments, Bitcoin doubled in value again in just three years, reaching a new all-time high in 2021. It is worth noting that Bitcoin improves upon gold by offering increased portability. Unlike physical gold, which has to be mined from the earth and transported to markets, Bitcoin can be easily transferred over the internet, rightfully earning the title, \u201cDigital Gold\u201d.\n\nBrief History of Ethereum\n\nAs for Ethereum (ETH), it was created in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, a computer developer. It is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts used to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) whose back-end code is placed in a distributed peer-to-peer network. The vital goal behind Ethereum is to form a decentralized suite of financial products that are capable of providing trustless products and services.\n\nThe decentralized applications are built on Ethereum that can be used for a variety of purposes including finance, gaming and social media. As the native currency on the Ethereum platform, ETH or Ether is needed to run dApps on the global computer that is the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nEther works very similarly to Bitcoin and can be used for peer-to-peer payments. People can use Ether to pay for transaction fees and gas, which is a unit of measurement used to calculate the amount of computational power needed to run a dApp.\n\nMain differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin\n\nAs both the digital tokens race for dominance, it is becoming increasingly common to hear investors and developers weighing in their options between Bitcoin vs Ethereum. Although both Ethereum and Bitcoin are powerful digital assets, each platform has some major advantages as well as disadvantages. In order to compare the two crypto behemoths, let us segregate both the platforms under some basic categories\n\nBlockchain\n\nAlthough, Bitcoin and Ethereum are both based on the \u201cblockchain\u201d technology, Bitcoin (BTC) was created for the sole purpose of providing a way for people to transfer value from one to another without a central bank. It was designed to be an alternative to traditional currencies and hence a medium of exchange and store of value.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum is seen as a general purpose blockchain that outpaces Bitcoin when it comes to developing smart contracts and distributed applications. Owing to the boom in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT) in the recent past, Ethereum (ETH) has witnessed an exponential growth.\n\nHowever, it depends completely on user requirements. Bitcoin works better as a peer-to-peer transaction system while Ethereum works well when an individual needs to create and build distributed applications and smart contracts. In a nutshell, Bitcoin uses Blockchain to store transaction data while Ethereum uses Blockchain to execute code on it. Bitcoin Blockchain keeps records of payments while Ethereum Blockchain keeps records of a computer program.\n\nConsensus Mechanism\n\nA consensus mechanism is a program used in blockchain systems to achieve distributed agreement about the ledger\u2019s state. Bitcoin uses a consensus protocol called proof of work (PoW). This consensus mechanism uses a lot more energy to do verify one block as it uses randomly selected validators to confirm transactions and create new blocks.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum started as a PoW protocol, but shifted to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus in September 2022 through a software upgrade called, \u201cThe Merge\u201d. This made the Ethereum network more scalable and secure. PoS also substitutes computational power with staking, making it less energy-intensive. With regards to block time, Ethereum is quicker than Bitcoin- an ether transaction is confirmed within seconds compared to minutes for Bitcoin.\n\nEcosystem\n\nFor decades, the Bitcoin ecosystem was limited to storing and transferring value. Hence, developer activity on the world\u2019s oldest blockchain network was minimal, to say the least. But things began to change with the emergence of various Bitcoin DeFi protocols such as Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Stacks (STX), Rootstock (RBTC), etc.\n\nMoreover, the utility of the Bitcoin network has been expanded even further with the arrival of the Ordinals Protocol. This latest innovation allows developers and artists to create and store digital artworks directly on the Bitcoin blockchain.These platforms have helped to create new use cases for the big daddy of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe TwelveFold auction has ended. Congratulations to the top 288 bidders \u2013 you will receive your inscription within one week. Valid bids that did not rank in the top 288 will have their bid amount returned to their receiving address within 24 hours. \u2014 Yuga Labs (@yugalabs) March 6, 2023\n\nOn the contrary, Ethereum takes the trophy for a much bigger ecosystem. The Ethereum ecosystem is growing by leaps and bounds, thanks to the surging popularity of its dApps in areas such as DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and technology.\n\nWith a large developer community, robust development tools, it provides developers with a vast array of options for building decentralized applications and smart contracts. It is home to some of the most innovative and successful Blockchain projects, including Uniswap, Compound, and MakerDAO.\n\nUse Cases\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has a limited range of use cases such as remittances, quick international payments, and privacy-focused transactions, for those who want to keep their costs low and avoid high banking fees. It allows users to securely transfer money without the need to go through traditional financial institutions.\n\nThe decentralized nature of it also helps with eliminating fraud, double spending and other issues that can occur with online payments. In a nut shell, Bitcoin is an ideal solution for people looking to purchase goods or services without using their bank account.\n\nConversely, the most promising real-world use cases for Ethereum (ETH) is decentralized finance applications. It provides a decentralized storage facility while the blockchain can also be used to quickly and securely transport data between millions of servers while encrypting it.\n\nWith the increasing DeFi related activitiesthe uses cases of Ethereum has gone through the roof. It has also steadily trotted into the banking systems, particularly because of its decentralized nature making it nearly impossible for hackers to gain access to the network.\n\nBanks and various financial institutions have started using Ethereum-based payment systems as a channel to make payments and remittances because of its security. The world\u2019s second biggest cryptocuurency is also being used in the shipping industry to track cargo and prevent misplacement of goods.\n\nSecurity\n\nTo see how Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) stack against security features, we need to check on their respective hashing algorithms. Hashing algorithms are how these systems can maintain their privacy and ensure security. Bitcoin uses a hashing algorithm known as SHA-256 and Ethereum uses a cryptographic algorithm called \u201cEthash\u201d.\n\nThe most significant difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum is that the Ethash algorithm is memory intensive while the SHA-256 algorithm is not. However, Ethereum\u2019s hash rate is generally much higher than Bitcoin\u2019s, meaning that Ethereum is much more secure against cyber attacks.\n\nDecentralization\n\nIn the context of cryptocurrencies, Decentralization refers to the shift of control and decision-making power from a central authority to a participatory network of peers. Bitcoin and Ethereum, without a doubt, sit on two different sides of the decentralization spectrum. However, Bitcoin is arguably more decentralized than Ethereum as the only way to alter the network is if more than 50% of the network voted in favor of a change.\n\nHowever, with the successful transition to PoS, Ethereum decentralization has increased. It is estimated that since April 2022, Ethereum\u2019s decentralization level has risen by 50%.\n\nComparative Table Ethereum vs Bitcoin\n\nEthereum (ETH) Bitcoin (BTC) Launch Date 30 July 2015 3 January 2009 Max. Token Supply Infinite 21 Million Consensus Mechanism Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Proof-of-Work (PoW) Transactions Fees $2-$6 (depending on network traffic) $0.77 \u2013 $1.95 per transaction Transactions Per Second 30 transactions 7 transactions Programming Language Solidity C++ Web https://ethereum.org/en/ https://bitcoin.org/en/\n\nConclusion\n\nAs the battle between the two giants heat up, we can say that fundamentally Bitcoin and Ethereum are both very different ideas: Bitcoin is considered as a store of value whereas Ethereum is considered as a decentralized platform to program other decentralized ideas. From an investment point of view both the cryptocurrency seem to have huge potential and have lots of reasons to grow further.\n\nSo, to the address the question, \u201cWhich one to buy, Ethereum or Bitcoin\u201d there\u2019s no clear answer. The fact is both the coins have individual uses, cases and great potential, along with having a reason and room to grow.\n\nThis article is for information purposes only.
