        "title": "Ethereum Improvement Proposals to watch in 2024 - Blockworks",
        "content": "The latest Ethereum All Core Developers meeting finally put some tentative dates on the upgrade schedule for the next mainnet hard fork, Dencun.\n\nWith the caveat that it\u2019s only \u201cif no major issues arise,\u201d Ethereum devs are eyeing the following dates for forking Ethereum\u2019s public testnets:\n\nGoerli: Jan. 17\n\nSepolia: Jan. 30\n\nHolesky: Feb. 7\n\nThis will be the last time that Goerli is included in the testing regimen, as the network is slated for deprecation.\n\nThey also discussed what comes next \u2014 the as-yet-un-nicknamed Prague/Electra upgrade. The Ethereum community is considering whether to focus on a large core feature \u2014 which could take a year of work \u2014 or structure the upgrade around multiple smaller improvements, which could be feasible for late 2024.\n\nA decision will come in the new year, but for now, here are some of the improvements to watch in 2024 in the wake of Dencun:\n\nEIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding)\n\nThis is the big kahuna among Dencun EIPs, which were the focus of many news stories in 2023.\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s next upgrade to focus on blobs\n\nThe upgrade \u201cwill reduce the cost of data availability across all layer-2s,\u201d StarkWare co-founder Eli Ben-Sasson told Blockworks. \u201cSo that\u2019s something that Starknet is very much anticipating so that users can have lower costs.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s at the \u201cforefront\u201d of what Lucas Henning, chief technology officer of Web3 wallet developer Suku, calls \u201ca year of groundbreaking improvements for Ethereum.\u201d\n\n\u201c[EIP-4844 is] a transformational enhancement\u201d that will slash rollups gas fees \u201cby up to 100x,\u201d Henning told Blockworks.\n\nRead more: Core devs rule out Dencun fork this year\n\nAccount abstraction comes into its own\n\nAlso at the top of Henning\u2019s mind are improvements taking advantage of account abstraction: ERC-4337 and its extension, ERC-6900.\n\nERCs are a subset of EIPs focusing specifically on token standards within the Ethereum ecosystem. They define rules for token implementations to ensure interoperability. Unlike some EIPs that modify the core protocol, ERCs typically don\u2019t require a hard fork.\n\nERC-4337 went live in March and the concept of account abstraction \u201cwill play a pivotal role as the most significant changes for the end-user,\u201d Henning said.\n\n\u201cAccount abstraction is set to revolutionize the way we perceive and interact with wallets, making gasless transactions the standard and secure social logins the new norm, fundamentally reshaping the Ethereum user experience,\u201d he said.\n\nTraditionally, Ethereum has two types of accounts: externally owned accounts (EOAs) controlled by private keys and contract accounts controlled by their code. Account abstraction blurs this distinction, allowing users to create accounts that behave more like smart contracts.\n\nIt can enhance both user experience and security, and allows for more complex account logic, such as multisig wallets or social recovery of lost keys.\n\nERC-6900, introduced the concept of \u201cdelegated transactions.\u201d This standard, which also did not require changes to Ethereum\u2019s mainnet consensus, allows users to delegate the ability to send transactions on their behalf, for instance, to make one approval for a batch of actions to save time and hassle.\n\nEIP-1153 (transient storage opcodes)\n\nThis proposal, part of Dencun, aims to introduce a new mechanism for handling temporary or transient storage during smart contract execution.\n\nTraditional storage operations on Ethereum are permanent and consume gas. This can be inefficient for temporary data that doesn\u2019t need to persist for longer than one transaction.\n\nEIP-1153 is an opcode (operational code) that would allow smart contracts to use transient storage \u2014 storage that would be wiped clean at the end of transaction execution.\n\nThe Uniswap team lobbied for 1153 to be included, and wanted it already in Shapella, but they couldn\u2019t rally enough support to reach consensus among the core developers. The upgrade is expected to play a significant role in enhancing the capabilities and efficiency of Uniswap\u2019s upcoming v4 protocol.\n\nRead more: What has Uniswap Labs cooked up for v4?\n\nBy enabling temporary storage, EIP-1153 can reduce the gas costs associated with storing data during contract execution and provide developers more flexibility in designing smart contracts.\n\nAnd by reducing the burden on permanent storage and minimizing state bloat, EIP-1153 can contribute to the overall scalability of the Ethereum network.\n\nEIP-4788 (Beacon block root commits)\n\nImagine Ethereum as a vast library with two main sections: the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) section, which is like the reading room where people come to read books (execute smart contracts), and the Beacon Chain section, which is like the library\u2019s catalog system, keeping track of all the books and their locations (consensus and coordination of the Ethereum network).\n\nBefore EIP-4788, these two sections functioned somewhat independently. The EVM section doesn\u2019t have direct access to the up-to-date catalog; it has to rely on indirect methods to understand what\u2019s happening in the Beacon Chain section.\n\nEIP-4788 proposes to put a \u201cBeacon Block Root\u201d (a summary or hash tree root of the parent block) into each EVM block.\n\nIt\u2019s like moving from an outdated card filing system in a library \u2014 inefficient and sometimes inaccurate \u2014 to a system with a real-time, accurate and direct link to the main library database.\n\nIn this modern library, every time a new book is added, moved or removed (the Beacon Chain updates), the readers (EVM) have immediate and accurate information. Readers can trust they\u2019re getting the most current information and the library operations (like executing smart contracts) are more aligned with the overall catalog system (the state of the consensus layer).\n\nAll this happens in a trust-minimized manner, eliminating the need for external oracles to provide this data, and thereby reducing potential points of failure or manipulation.\n\nThis change is particularly beneficial for liquid staking protocols such as Lido, smart contract-based bridges and restaking solutions, as it allows these protocols to access crucial data like validator balances and states directly from the consensus layer, enhancing their security and operational efficiency.\n\nEIP-4788 essentially introduces a protocol-level oracle, relaying Ethereum\u2019s consensus state throughout the mainnet.\n\nMisha Komarov, founder of Nil Foundation, which is deploying a zkOracle for Lido, called it \u201cdefinitely helpful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey need the consensus layer state root within their application logic (right now it is being proven by Casper FFG proof done via zkLLVM to the execution layer within the zkOracle design,\u201d he told Blockworks.\n\nRead more: New Ethereum rollup takes a zero-knowledge approach to sharding\n\nEIP-5656 (MCOPY opcode)\n\nThe EVM operates using a set of opcodes that dictate various operations.\n\nEIP-5656 introduces a new opcode called MCOPY, which is proposed to optimize the process of copying data in memory during the execution of smart contracts.\n\nIn the current EVM architecture, copying large data segments can be inefficient and costly when using existing opcodes. MCOPY offers a more efficient way, one which is expected to reduce the gas fees associated with these operations, while improving performance.\n\nFaster memory operations mean quicker execution of contracts, and developers would have more tools at their disposal to optimize their smart contracts \u2014 particularly when dealing with large data structures or complex operations that involve memory manipulation.\n\nEIP-6780 (restrict SELFDESTRUCT)\n\nIn Ethereum, the SELFDESTRUCT opcode allows a smart contract to delete itself from the blockchain.\n\nWhen executed, it removes the contract\u2019s code and storage from the state and sends the contract\u2019s remaining ether to a specified address.\n\nHowever, this feature has led to several issues, including complexity in state management and potential security vulnerabilities.\n\nBy restricting SELFDESTRUCT, Ethereum can better manage its state size, leading to a more stable and predictable blockchain.\n\nThis is crucial for the network\u2019s long-term scalability and maintenance, as it will simplify future Ethereum upgrades.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

The difference in volume between Solana and Ethereum was over $13 billion, according to Artemix.xyz.\n\nStablecoin volumes across major blockchains | Source: Artemis.xyz\n\nThis landmark for Solana (SOL) followed a flurry of activities on its blockchain ranging from an inscriptions craze to memecoin mania with some traders turning a few bucks into six-figure hauls. Airdrops like Jito also attracted thousands of users to SOL\u2019s blockchain.\n\nThe interest in Solana directly impacted SOL as the crypto returned to prices not seen since Terra\u2019s collapse in 2022. SOL gained 1,000% last year, and the digital asset traded above $110 when this report was written.\n\nYou might also like: Trader earns $5.7m after investing 30 SOL\n\nAs interest and significant price appreciation occurred, on-chain trading followed suit as crypto.news reported. Decentralized exchanges (DEX) on Solana recorded over $28 billion in volume during December alone. The blockchain also set new highs for monthly active addresses, with SOL\u2019s market cap surpassing $50 billion.\n\nThis surge allowed SOL to leapfrog Ripple\u2019s XRP token as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency on the market. At press time, Solana was on the heels of Binance\u2019s BNB coin and even boasted greater 24-hour trading volume per Coingecko.\n\nWith upcoming token airdrops, more rewards for SOL participants may be on the way.

        "title": "Ethereum's Netflow Continues To Surge As Short-Term Holders Exit! Will ETH Price Hold Bullish Momentum? - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nThe new year sparked a rise in crypto buying sentiment, pushing the total market cap up by over 5% to $1.84 trillion, a level last seen in May 2022. This surge helped both BTC and ETH prices break through key resistance levels. Yet, there\u2019s a risk of correction. On-chain data suggests that short-term buyers, currently sitting on high profits, might sell off at these higher levels, potentially creating selling pressure.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Netflow Continues Its Surge\n\nAfter hovering around a bearish consolidation range, Ethereum\u2019s price finally achieved a breakthrough, surpassing the closely watched $2,400 level. This upward movement resulted in a total liquidation of $25.8 million, with sellers offloading more than $16.4 million in positions.\n\nYet, as Ethereum\u2019s price rally paused above $2,430, a decrease in buying momentum was observed. This shift occurred as short-term buyers cashed in their positions, aiming to book maximum gains on the recent surge. Data from Coinglass indicates that approximately $9.4 million in long positions were liquidated during this period.\n\nThe potential for bearish momentum is growing, as indicated by a consistent rise in Netflow over the past week, based on data from IntoTheBlock. Following a dip to -111K ETH on December 26, there has been a notable shift with more Ethereum being moved to exchanges, as inflows began to exceed outflows.\n\nConsequently, Netflow has moved into positive territory, currently at 45.5K ETH, following a boost in buyer confidence in ETH\u2019s price. Typically, a rising Netflow signals bearishness, suggesting that the increased inflow of an asset to exchanges often signals its sale at or near market peaks.\n\nThe hourly long/short ratio is showing a bearish trend, having fallen below the 1.0 threshold and currently trading at 0.8769. This indicates that bears are in control, with approximately 53.2% of positions anticipating a decline in value. In contrast, only 46.7% of positions are expecting a price increase in ETH.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nEther faced a rejection at $2,433 recently and is aiming to correct its price in the coming hours, indicating that bears are exerting pressure at higher levels. As of writing, ETH price trades at $2,370, surging over 2.9% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nOn the bullish side, the price has managed to stay above the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $2,333, bringing some hope. However, there\u2019s a risk of increased selling if buyers fail to drive the price above the $2,500 soon.\n\nShould the 20-day EMA be breached, ETH price could decline towards the ascending support line at $2,250.\n\nConversely, a successful break and close above the channel would signal that bulls are still in the game. In this scenario, buyers might attempt to push the price beyond $2,433-$2,500, aiming for an uptrend towards the $3,000 mark. With the RSI level now stabilizing, we might see a strong rebound from the EMA20 trend line."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin Shares Ethereum Roadmap For 2024, Focuses on Six Key Components\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has shared the Ethereum roadmap for 2024, outlining the project's continued focus on six main components.\n\nButerin posted on X (formerly Twitter) an updated roadmap with annotations and diagrams, elaborating on each of the six elements: the Merge, the Surge, the Scourge, the Verge, the Purge and the Splurge.\n\nButerin noted that as Ethereum's technical direction becomes clearer, there are only a handful of minor adjustments compared to the 2023 roadmap. The Merge, which integrated the Ethereum mainnet with the proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain the Beacon Chain in September 2022, remains a key focus area. Buterin emphasized the importance of maintaining a simple and resilient PoS consensus.\n\nFollowing the Merge, the most significant observation on Ethereum was the transition from a power-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to PoS, leading to a major reduction in the network's overall energy consumption.\n\nButerin also highlighted the developments in Ethereum's single-slot finality (SSF), which aims to ensure that changes to a blockchain block are irreversible without burning at least 33% of the total staked Ether (ETH).\n\nButerin stated:\n\n\"The role of single slot finality (SSF) in post-Merge PoS improvement is solidifying. It's becoming clear that SSF is the easiest path to resolving a lot of the Ethereum PoS design's current weaknesses.\"\n\nButerin's roadmap also emphasizes the importance of rollups, zero-knowledge proofs, account abstraction, and second-generation privacy solutions, which align with the original cypherpunk principles of Ethereum.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

At current Ethereum prices, these targets represent 58% and 110% increases, respectively.\n\nIn a tweet on the first day of the year, Ali hinted that Ethereum might be poised for further gains. The reason he cited is that Ethereum faces no major barriers ahead.\n\n#Ethereum looks set for further gains!\n\n\n\nThe path ahead of $ETH is clear, with no significant supply barriers in sight, suggesting a potential rise to $2,700 or beyond. Additionally, a robust demand wall at $2,000 provides solid support, potentially cushioning any corrections. pic.twitter.com/s79YAlkS8w \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) January 1, 2024\n\nAli noted that the path ahead for ETH seems clear, with no significant supply barriers in sight. This might suggest a potential rise to $2,700 or beyond, he added. A strong demand wall at $2,000, on the other hand, provides steady support, potentially cushioning any corrections.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH had risen 6% in the previous 24 hours to $2,425, paralleling Bitcoin's ascent beyond $45,000.\n\nBitcoin topped $45,000 for the first time in nearly two years as investors awaited the approval of an exchange-traded fund that would invest directly in the largest cryptocurrency.\n\nFear of missing out among certain traders in the United States and Europe in the run-up to the approval may have sparked bullish bets in favor of crypto assets such as Ethereum.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nGoing forward, on the path to the aforementioned targets of $3,830 and $5,100, the Ethereum price may take some key intermediate steps. The initial goal would be to reach the $3,000 price level.\n\n\n\nOn the upside, a break and close above the Dec. 28 high of $2,448 may indicate that the bulls have not given up. If this is achieved, buyers will attempt to push the price above $2,700 once more, kicking off a new uptrend toward $3,000.\n\nOn the other hand, if bears make a comeback, Ethereum might find sturdy support at the daily MA 50 at $2,185. If the declines continue, the $2,148 low may be reached."

        "content": "On Dec. 30, 2023, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin shared the Ethereum roadmap for 2024, pointing out that there are only a handful of minor adjustments compared to last year.\n\nIn a thread on the X social network, Buterin detailed in a series of charts and diagrams revealing that the continued focus for Ethereum in 2024 is on six main components \u2013 the Merge, the Surge, the Scourge, the Verge, the Purge and the Splurge.\n\nHere was the one from last year. Notice that it's actually quite similar! As Ethereum's technical path forward continues to solidify, there are relatively few changes. I'll go through the important ones.https://t.co/F1MpfNdfa7 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 30, 2023\n\nThe Merge was highlighted as a key section on the roadmap, aiming to maintain a simple and resilient proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus. It took place in September 2022 integrating the Ethereum mainnet with the PoS blockchain the Beacon Chain.\n\nThe Surge targets 100,000 transactions per second across Ethereum and layer 2 networks and aims to enhance the blockchain\u2019s scalability.\n\nThe Scourge focuses on mitigating risks related to Maximal extractable value (MEV) and liquid pooling, addressing concerns about economic centralization within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nButerin also endorsed single-slot finality (SSF) as a crucial solution for Ethereum\u2019s current weaknesses and praised advancements in layer 2 networks and Verkle tree implementations. Finality aims to ensure that changes to a blockchain block are irreversible without burning at least 33% of the total staked Ether (ETH).\n\nSignificant progress on the Surge (rollup scaling) this year, both on EIP-4844 and from rollups themselves.https://t.co/uEjd2VETQU continues to be a good page to follow.\n\n\n\nAlso, cross-rollup standards and interop has been highlighted as an area for long-term improvements. pic.twitter.com/ixUsZEo7pi \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 30, 2023\n\nThe Purge seeks to make the protocol easy to use, and the Verge aims to facilitate easier block verification while the Splurge encompasses all other elements crucial for Ethereum\u2019s growth.\n\nEthereum improvement proposals (EIPs) to look out for\n\nEarlier on Oct. 21, 2023, the Ethereum All Core Developers meeting provided some tentative dates on the upgrade schedule for the next mainnet hard fork, Dencun.\n\nThis was revealed in a series of posts on X by Ethereum Developer Tim Beiko who revealed that \u201cif no major issues arise\u201d, the forking of Ethereum\u2019s public testnets is scheduled for Jan. 17 for Goerly, Jan. 30 for Sepolia and Jan. Feb. 7 for Holesky.\n\nSo, if no major issues arise, we're looking at the following schedule:\n\n\n\n- Goerli: Jan 17, 6:32:00 UTC\n\n- Sepolia: Jan 30, 22:51:12 UTC\n\n- Holesky: Feb 7, 11:34:24 UTC\n\n\n\n... and then, mainnet pic.twitter.com/JFRt0ZHAi8 \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) December 21, 2023\n\nThis will be the last time that Goerli is included in the testing regimen, as the network is slated for deprecation, meaning client developers will no longer maintain it.\n\nThis move is part of the strategy to activate \u2018Dencun\u2019 on the Ethereum network in January 2024, marking a significant advancement in its technological capabilities.\n\nDencun is particularly expected to increase data availability for layer 2 rollups through EIP-4844 \u2013 Proto-Danksharding \u2013 resulting in a reduction of rollup transaction costs, which will be passed on to end-users.\n\nAlso key among the improvements on the Ethereum network are account abstraction: ERC-4337 and its extension, ERC-6900. It centers on the concept of smart accounts, which holds significant implications for end-user experience and will enable reduced transaction costs and secure social logins.\n\nThe top upcoming #Ethereum improvements for 2024:\n\n\n\n1. EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding): This major proposal aims to reduce data availability costs across all layer-2 solutions, potentially slashing rollups gas fees by up to 100x.\n\n\n\n2. ERC-4337 (Account Abstraction): This standard,\u2026 \u2014 \u2206mir (@hey1994amir) January 2, 2024\n\nEIP-1153 (Transient Storage Opcodes) and EIP-6780 (Restrict Self Destruct) are expected to reduce gas costs and enhance the network\u2019s scalability and stability.\n\nRelated: Vitalik Buterin reveals Ethereum game plan for 2024\n\nUpcoming Dencun upgrade could make Ethereum more competitive\n\nThere are narratives that Ethereum\u2019s rivals are gaining relevance as critics argue that the ecosystem has failed due to its limited capacity for scaling and privacy solutions at the base layer level.\n\nThese negative conversations have been backed by the recent performance by Solana (SOL), Injective (INJ) and Avalanche (AVAX) which have gained 863%, 2,820% and 270%, respectively, over the last year against Ether\u2019s 94%, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nJames do you think EIP-4844 upgrade to Eth helps Ethereum to keep some of its dominance or is Eth just losing out to Solana over time \u2014 Brad (@BradMiles1) December 16, 2023\n\nOne of the key metrics determining the efficiency of a blockchain network depends on how affordable it is for users to process transactions. Transaction fees take into account the amount of computing power needed to process a transaction, known as gas, which also has a variable price measured in the native currency of the protocol and is directly related to network traffic.\n\nAccording to a January 2023 report by BitfinityNetwork, the average cost per transaction on the Ethereum network is 33.5 Gwei, which is higher than the 5 Gwei for the BNB Chain.\n\nLayer 1 transaction fees comparison. Source: Bitfinity Network\n\nOther blockchains such as Algorand (ALGO) and the Internet Computer (ICP) offer a negligible fixed fee that depends on the value of their token (0.001 ALGO and 0.0001 ICP, respectively), while using Polkadot costs nothing.\n\nHowever, when it comes to Ethereum layer 2 solutions, the Ethereum network is unmatched with respect to DApps\u2019 engagement backed by the dominance of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nData from DAppRaddar ranks Ethereum highest in terms of DApp volumes ahead of BNB Chain, Solana and Avalanche.\n\nBlockchains ranked by 7-day DApps volumes, USD. Source: DappRadar\n\nApart from its absolute layer 1 dominance, the Ethereum network has posted a 16% growth in NFT volumes over the past 7 days, distancing itself from BNB Chain and Solana which are negative.\n\nMoreover, the Ethereum network's total value locked (TVL) of $53.32 billion invalidates much of the negative assessment. In comparison, BNB Chain holds a mere $2.54 billion TVL, while Solana's latest data stands at $1.47 billion, according to DappRadar.\n\nWith the Dencun upgrade expected to make a significant reduction in transaction costs, Ethereum is slated to become even more competitive asserting its dominance over its rivals.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Will ETH Hit $10,000 In 2024? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has recently become the focal point of speculation, particularly regarding its potential surge to $10,000 in the upcoming bull run. According to a post by Altcoin Daily on X, Ethereum has the potential to hit $10,000. The bold Ethereum price prediction has sparked a wave of discussions and analysis within the crypto community.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Bullish Run In 2023\n\nAt press time, Ethereum price was trading around the $2,300 range, making Altcoin Daily\u2019s projection a staggering 350% gain. However, other analysts\u2019 projections and technical indicators suggest that hitting this target would take some time. To understand better, let\u2019s summarise Ethereum\u2019s performance in 2023 while looking at the technical aspects of its performance.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn October 2023, the Ethereum price surged beyond $1,800 and surpassed the $2,000 mark in November. Since then, the second-largest crypto has maintained an upward trajectory in December, showcasing an approximately 14% increase. Despite a recent correction, it continues to hover around $2,300 after almost seven months of relatively stagnant performance.\n\nAlso Read: Analyst Predicts 22% Surge In Ethereum (ETH) Price Sparking Market Optimism\n\nETH Price Technical Analysis\n\nA closer look at technical analysis data reveals that Ethereum surpassed December 2023\u2019s Fibonacci pivot R2 level, approaching $2,210, signaling a positive trajectory. However, the brief touch of the R3 level before correction suggests potential volatility. As of now, the technical projections estimate Ethereum to trade between $2,300 and $2,400 by the end of 2023.\n\nWhilst, $2,350 is identified as the immediate goal for 2023 end and support is found between $2,000 and $2,125. Currently, Ethereum\u2019s price is trading well above the 50-day and 200-day EMAs, indicating an upward trajectory. Immediate expectations suggest a rally towards $2,500 towards the beginning of 2024.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2024-2030\n\nFurthermore, ETH price prediction by another renowned analyst paints a compelling picture. In a recent tweet, Rekt Capital, a popular crypto analyst on X, noted that Ethereum could witness a 22% surge if it\u2019s able to regain the $2,274 mark as support. This implies that the ETH price would propel up to more than $2,600.\n\nOn the other hand, the ETH forecasts by Changelly for the period from 2024 to 2030 range between $4,000 to $34,700. The projections hint at a volatile journey marked by bullish surges and significant pullbacks. In conclusion, while the $10,000 mark remains an unrealistic projection for 2024, Ethereum\u2019s current trends and technical analysis indicate a promising performance.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Prediction as New Bearish Pattern Threats a Dive Below $2000"

The price rise pulled other leading altcoins into the green as Ethereum touched $2,400. The positive rise was also reflected in the memecoin segment as Shiba Inu deleted a zero and hit $0.00001080 on Tuesday. The cryptocurrency market momentum for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Shiba Inu remains positive with investors\u2019 enthusiasm on a high for 2024.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu: Can SHIB Reach $0.01 in 2024?\n\nA handful of analysts have provided bold price predictions for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Shiba Inu in 2024. In this article, we will highlight how high BTC, ETH, and SHIB cryptocurrencies can rise this year in 2024, according to analysts.\n\n3 Boldest Price Predictions For 2024: Bitcoin, Ethereum, & Shiba Inu\n\n1. Bitcoin (BTC) 2024 Price Prediction\n\nSource: Pintrest\n\nInvestors are hopeful that the SEC will approve the much-awaited Bitcoin ETF before Q2 of 2024. The move will allow a flood of investments into the cryptocurrency markets, especially Bitcoin. The prices of BTC are expected to soar after the BTC ETF approval, which will eventually make other cryptocurrencies hit new highs. CoinShares has provided a bold prediction claiming that Bitcoin\u2019s price could climb above the $80,000 mark this year in 2024.\n\n\u201cEstimations suggest that a 20% investment increase from current assets under management (around US$3 billion) could potentially propel Bitcoin prices to US$80,000,\u201d said James Butterfill, CoinShares Head of Research to CNBC.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu: Shibarium To Start Burning SHIB Tokens From January 2024\n\n2. Ethereum (ETH)\n\nSource: CNN\n\nA leading price prediction analyst boldly claims that Ethereum could \u201ceasily\u201d hit $10,000 this year in 2024. According to the prediction, ETH could reach a deflationary stage making the cryptocurrency begin surging in price. The development might make Ethereum sustainably scale up in the charts and add new investments along the way. The combination of fresh funds and its deflationary status might make Ethereum reach $10,000, claims the prediction.\n\nAlso Read: 5 U.S. Sectors To Be Affected If BRICS Ditches the Dollar For Trade\n\n3. Shiba Inu (SHIB)\n\nSource: Watcher Guru\n\nA handful of predictions boldly claim that Shiba Inu could delete most of its zeroes and reach the $0.01 mark. These predictions are not new in 2024 but have been repeating on a loop since 2020. There\u2019s nothing to be taken at face value as SHIB has a long way to reach the $0.01 mark as its circulating supply stands at 549 trillion tokens. There is no guarantee that Shiba Inu will skyrocket in price in 2024.\n\nThe cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and can swing both ways delivering losses to investors. There is no guarantee that BTC could reach $80,000 ETH $10,000, and SHIB to $0.01. It is advised to do thorough research before taking an entry position into the cryptocurrency markets at the moment."

He has previous trading experience and has been working in the Fintech industry since 2017.\n\nCryptocurrencies have been the topic of discussion since their inception, and many known personalities believe in investing in them. They also give investors their outlook and share predictions about them.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about Ethereum, which is used worldwide due to its secure network, validated transitions, and sustainable ecosystem. According to YChart, as of September 2023, there are over 245 million distinct Ethereum wallets in use globally.\n\nScott Melker\u2019s Predictions for Ethereum\n\nScott Melker, a prominent cryptocurrency trader, author, and podcaster, has made a bold prediction for the future price of Ethereum. Melker forecasts that the value of Ethereum will reach $12, 000 in 2024. He believes that the growing interest among investors in decentralized finance and the increasing demand for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain will drive up the price.\n\nMoreover, Melker anticipates that the upcoming merger between the Ethereum mainnet and Beacon Chain will significantly enhance the network\u2019s scalability and security, making it more appealing to investors.\n\nMy target for 2025 is $12,000.\n\n\n\nBut not for $BTC.\n\n\n\nFor $ETH. \u2014 The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) December 31, 2023\n\nLark Darvis Predictions for Cryptocurrencies\n\nLark Davis, a well-known crypto YouTuber, has also given his thoughts regarding the future of cryptocurrencies. Davis speculates that the cryptocurrency markets will surge in 2024. Davis\u2019s predictions are grounded in several factors.\n\nFirstly, he expects that the current parabolic growth of stock markets will result in more people having spare cash to invest in exchanges.\n\nSecondly, he anticipates that Bitcoin ETFs may be approved by the SEC in Q1 of this year, which could significantly boost the value of Bitcoin and other exchanges.\n\nThird, Davis points out that major corporations are increasingly adopting blockchain technology, which could drive up the interest and need for cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum started 2023 with a slow start and a value of $1196, and itself did even better than most, almost doubling its price since the outset of the year! It went from $1200 to a happy $2260, a whopping 99% increase.\n\nIn 2024 it is expected that Ethereum will surge to mark $3000 and this may be due to global macroeconomic conditions, increased security, and many other aspects."

Additionally, a robust demand wall at $2,000 provides solid support, potentially cushioning any corrections. Ali Charts\n\nNearly two million wallets accumulated almost 40 million ETH between $1,900 and $2,020 price ranges, forming a formidable wall against massive market dumps.\n\nEthereum is also scheduled for notable technological upgrades like EIP-7514 and EIP-4844, also referred to as proto-danksharding, which is geared towards enabling more transactions for cheaper gas fees.

        "content": "As the bitcoin (BTC) price jumped 7% shooting past $45,000 in the wake of Bitcoin ETF approval, altcoins too joined the party. The Ethereum (ETH) price is up once again by 2% in the last 24 hours, moving closer to $2,400.\n\nOn-chain indicators for Ethereum continue to show strength, suggesting a much larger rally ahead from here onwards. Predictions are already strong that the ETH price can rally all the way to $10,000 by this year\u2019s end.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH) On-Chain Indicators\n\nIn a recent market analysis, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez expressed a bullish outlook for Ethereum (ETH). Martinez highlighted a promising path ahead for Ethereum, emphasizing the absence of significant supply barriers, which could pave the way for potential gains to $2,700 or beyond.\n\nAdditionally, the analysis pointed out a robust demand wall at $2,000, indicating substantial support that may act as a cushion in the event of corrections. The positive forecast aligns with the current market dynamics, reflecting optimism regarding Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory in the near term.\n\nIn insights shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands indicate pivotal price targets for the cryptocurrency. Martinez pointed out that, according to the data, the next significant price targets for Ethereum ($ETH) are identified at $3,830 and $5,100. This analysis provides valuable guidance for investors and market participants, shedding light on potential future price movements in the Ethereum market.\n\nETH Exchange Supply Falling Sharply\n\nAnother positive indicator for Ethereum is the sharp drop in the exchange supply. Data from Santiment reveals that the supply of ETH tokens on exchanges has reached an unprecedented all-time low since the inception of Ether.\n\nAs of the latest data, Ethereum\u2019s supply on exchanges represents only 8.04% of the total ETH supply. This marks the lowest level recorded since the cryptocurrency\u2019s genesis. The on-exchange supply of an altcoin like ETH often plays a crucial role in influencing its market price. A decrease in the supply is generally perceived as a bullish indicator, suggesting a potential reduction in selling pressure on ETH.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently shared a roadmap that seeks to improve the efficiency of the PoS system."

        "content": "An analyst has explained that Ethereum could be set to see a further rally based on on-chain data. Here\u2019s the level ETH may end up surpassing.\n\nEthereum Has No Significant On-Chain Resistance Ahead\n\nIn a new post on X, analyst Ali has discussed how Ethereum\u2019s support and resistance levels are looking like based on on-chain data. In on-chain analysis, the potential for any level to provide any notable amount of support/resistance to the price depends on the number of investors who acquired their coins.\n\nHere is a chart that shows the amount of ETH that was bought at some of the price ranges that the asset has visited before:\n\nThe density of cost basis at each of the different ETH price ranges | Source: @ali_charts on X\n\nThe graph shows that the $2,235 to $2,302 range carries the cost basis of a significant number of coins. More specifically, 1.84 million addresses acquired more than 6 million ETH inside this range.\n\nCurrently, the Ethereum price is trading just above this range, implying that all these investors are in the green. If the Ethereum spot price retraces into this range, these holders could show some reaction, as their profit-loss boundary would be retested.\n\nSince these holders would have been in profits just before the retest, they might want to buy more, as they may believe that this same price range that was profitable earlier might turn out to be a worthy buy again.\n\nSince the range is thick with investors, this buying effect that may arise on a retest could end up providing support to the price. If the support fails, the price might be between $1,958 and $2,029.\n\nThis range is much more robust, hosting a cost basis of over 37 million ETH. Ali notes that this support could potentially help cushion any corrections that may take place.\n\nNow, Ethereum has strong support below, and as is apparent in the chart, there is no major demand wall above it simultaneously. Investors in loss (those with a cost basis higher than the current spot price) may be desperate to escape the market, so the price rising to their break-even can be an enticing exit opportunity.\n\nIf many holders are sitting at a loss, their demand zone could provide significant resistance to the price because of such selling. ETH has no such obstacles in the nearby price ranges so that the coin could rally further. \u201cThe path ahead of ETH is clear, with no significant supply barriers in sight, suggesting a potential rise to $2,700 or beyond,\u201d explains the analyst.\n\nThe market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has also shared a chart that could provide further evidence for a bullish case of Ethereum.\n\nThe trend in the HODLer ratio for Bitcoin and Ethereum | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nAs is visible in the above graph, the percentage of Ethereum investors who can be classified as \u201cHODLers\u201d (1 year+ holding time) has shot up recently. \u201cThis year, the percent of long-term ETH holders surpassed that of Bitcoin for the second time ever!\u201d notes IntoTheBlock.\n\nETH Price\n\nEthereum is currently at the $2,316 mark, not too far above the support zone mentioned earlier.\n\nLooks like the price of the coin hasn't been moving much recently | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, IntoTheBlock.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nStory Highlights Experts predict Ethereum could reach $5,300, fueled by Vitalik Buterin's roadmap for advancements.\n\nBitcoin's dominance may peak before a halving event, opening doors for altcoins like Ethereum.\n\nInitiatives like Scourge address PoS system issues, showcasing Ethereum's dedication to improvement.\n\nThe crypto sphere is buzzing with anticipation as Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, charts a course toward a potential price surge. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, has rolled out a detailed plan for 2024, highlighting significant advancements in the blockchain world.\n\nHere are the exciting predictions for ETH in the year 2024.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Growing Momentum\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is valued at $2,275.86, showing a daily increase of 2.84% and a monthly growth of 14.45%. This steady rise suggests Ethereum might reach $5,000 soon. The surge in December was driven by hopes of ETF approval and BlackRock\u2019s involvement in the Ethereum ETF market.\n\nMarket experts believe Ethereum could hit $5,300 based on Buterin\u2019s 2024 plan and market trends. This expected rise is backed by key metrics and upcoming improvements to Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Records New High! Will ETH Price Hit $2,500 This Week?\n\nEchoing the same sentiment, Raoul Pal, a prominent figure in the crypto space, in his video adds weight to this speculation, predicting a significant uptick in Ethereum\u2019s value. He ties this projection to the advent of an Ethereum ETF, marking a critical catalyst that could propel Ethereum\u2019s market sentiment to all-time highs.\n\nPal highlights, that Buterin\u2019s updated roadmap for Ethereum\u2019s evolution provides a blueprint for the network\u2019s future. It outlines transformative changes such as the implementation of Single Slot Finality (SSF), designed to rectify existing Proof-of-Stake (PoS) design flaws, potentially enhancing transaction speeds and overall security. These strides in scalability, especially through the Surge and rollup enhancements, signal Ethereum\u2019s relentless pursuit of efficiency and broader usability.\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin: The 2024 Outlook\n\nWhile Bitcoin has dominated the crypto market recently, many predict Ethereum will lead in 2024. A common view is that Bitcoin\u2019s market dominance will peak before a halving event, paving the way for altcoins like Ethereum to shine. Ethereum\u2019s growing ecosystem, with projects like Arbitrum and Optimism, adds to this optimism. Buterin\u2019s efforts to streamline Ethereum further highlight its potential.\n\nButerin\u2019s plan also addresses challenges within Ethereum\u2019s PoS system. Initiatives like Scourge aim to tackle issues like Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) and stake pooling. Despite facing challenges like Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs), Ethereum\u2019s dedication to improvement remains evident.\n\nThe Journey to $5k\n\nEchoing positive sentiments, Arthur Hayes underscores Ethereum\u2019s rising importance in the crypto landscape. If Ethereum maintains its growth momentum, reaching $5,000 is plausible. Technical measures like RSI and MACD also support Ethereum\u2019s promising path forward.\n\nRead More: Ethereum Will Make Millionaires In 2024 \u2013 Predicts Crypto Expert Lark Davis"

        "title": "Countdown to Dencun Upgrade: Will Ethereum Price's Rally? - Blockonomi",
        "content": "Ethereum is in the spotlight as its Dencun upgrade inches close. Will Ethereum break above $3,000?\n\nAccording to Ethereum Foundation Protocol Support Tim Beiko, Ethereum\u2019s next upgrade, Dencun, will be released on January 18. Dencun is set to launch on the Goerli testnet first, with later deployments on the Sepolia and Holesky testnets on January 31 and February 7, 2024, respectively. The mainnet launch is slated for February 2024.\n\nWill this new upgrade makes things better for ETH?\n\nDencun Slated for Q1/2024\n\nDencun was initially expected to launch in late 2023, but concerns about testnet deployment timelines and consensus issues prompted Ethereum\u2019s core developers to delay its implementation. While the event is now slated for early 2024, the team hasn\u2019t finalized the upgrade dates.\n\nThe upgrade will introduce proto-danksharding, or EIP-4844, to boost data storage and improve the efficiency and scalability of rollups using \u201cblobs.\u201d Blobs are essentially chunks of data, much larger than typical Ethereum transactions, that can be attached to blocks. They can hold up to 125 kilobytes of information, compared to the standard transaction size of about 250 bytes.\n\nThe process is expected to positively impact Ethereum\u2019s scaling protocols, such as a drop in transaction fees and network security. Layer 2 solutions have gained significant traction over the past few months due to their cost advantages. However, concerns persist surrounding their security and decentralization. With Dencun, Ethereum seeks to address these challenges within rollups and enhance the performance of bridges and staking protocols.\n\nRecent tests signified widespread acceptance of the Dencun upgrade among Ethereum nodes, with a 99% participation rate. Meanwhile, 95% of data blobs propagated in under two seconds, which suggests that the coming upgrade could result in potential improvements in scalability and network efficiency.\n\nDencun\u2019s impact extends far beyond technical upgrades. It marks a turning point for the Ethereum ecosystem, paving the way for explosive growth and groundbreaking innovation.\n\nEnhanced data storage, streamlined transactions, and boosted scalability unlock new possibilities. These ripples will be felt across the entire community, nurturing an environment where groundbreaking developments can flourish and a more inclusive, robust digital economy takes root.\n\nOn December 31, Ethereum\u2019s creator, Vitalik Buterin, issued the blockchain\u2019s 2024 roadmap. The key highlights are the application of single-slot finality to solve the problems of the proof-of-stake mechanism, Dencun implementation, solutions to miner extractable value (MAV), the centralization of liquid staking, and Ethereum\u2019s design simplification.\n\nIn a post published on December 27, Vitalik suggested three ways to make Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake \u201cconsiderably simpler and lighter.\u201d He proposed reducing validator signatures to 8192, encompassing decentralized staking, two-tiered staking, and rotating validator participation. His proposal aims to ease the system\u2019s technical load while maintaining efficiency, security, and decentralization.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF Outlook\n\nAlong with the highly anticipated Dencun upgrade, Ethereum enthusiasts eagerly await the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) decision on spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Market observers believe the SEC\u2019s upcoming ruling on spot Bitcoin ETFs, expected by January 10th, could serve as a catalyst for approving spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nMajor institutions like BlackRock, ARK Invest, VanEck, Fidelity, Invesco, and Grayscale have all filed applications for spot Ethereum ETFs in the US. While no approvals have been granted, the SEC extended its decision deadline for these proposals to May 2024. However, with the outcome of spot Bitcoin ETF filings looming, analysts anticipate a similar one for spot Ethereum ETFs likely to follow.\n\nEthereum is trading at around $2,300 at current prices. There\u2019s growing anticipation in the crypto community about Ethereum\u2019s potential to reach new heights this year in alignment with a series of important events. If an ETF hits the markets in 2024, ETH\u2019s price will likely rise.\n\nNow, we just have to wait and see how the upgrade goes, and what the 2024 crypto market brings."

Using this metric, Martinez claimed that the next major price target for the coin lies within the $3,830 to $5,100 range.\n\nThis price range is highly ambitious for Ethereum, and while its All-Time High (ATH) of $4,891.70 falls in between this range, meaning it is achievable, current market dynamics hint at how challenging it might be to hit this price target in the short term.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nEthereum On-Chain Outlook\n\nMartinez is bullish on Ethereum, judging by his previous posts shared on the X platform. At the moment, Ethereum has no major supply barriers in sight, with a psychologically important resistance point set around the $2,700 zone. Should this level be flipped, Martinez believes there is no major obstacle ahead for the digital currency.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum was trading for $2,399.10, up by more than 4% in the past 24 hours. The coin\u2019s market has jumped by 4% to $288,470,978,345, and trading volume has soared 60% to $10,933,692,743.\n\nPer the chart shared by Ali Martinez, Ethereum has at least four different Realized Price (RP) levels, including $1,275.57 and $1,594.46, which form the likely point the coin\u2019s price could slip to. These Realized Prices also hint at the upper band of $3,826.70 and $5,102.27, as pointed out by the analyst.\n\nAccording to the #Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands, the next key price targets for $ETH are $3,830 and $5,100! pic.twitter.com/cLo4crWkPF \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) January 1, 2024\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nConflicting Ethereum Price Calls\n\nThe outlook on Ethereum has been quite controversial in recent times. Market experts like Ali Martinez and Michael van de Poppe are bullish on the coin as the latter denounced the idea that Ethereum is dead.\n\nHowever, Ethereum is not favored by legendary trader Peter Brandt, who is convinced the digital currency may not be around for the next ten years. Brandt, in his strong belief that Ethereum is poised to fall, revealed he had shorted the coin as he noted the coin could fall as low as $650 in the long term."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has released a roadmap detailing the network\u2019s upgrades and activities for 2024.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Buterin stated that the 2024 roadmap contained few changes from the 2023 plan and that the network is set to focus on the Merge, the Surge, the Scourge, the Verge, the Purge, and the Splurge.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Roadmap For 2024\n\nSince the Merge took place in September 2022, the Ethereum network will now prioritize implementing the role of a single slot finality (SSF). While the Merge saw Ethereum transition from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to that of Proof-of-Stake (PoS), SSF will resolve the network\u2019s current weaknesses.\n\nThe concept of SSF can make Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism validate blocks more efficiently; the blocks could be proposed and finalized in the same slot, significantly reducing time-to-finality by 15 minutes. Buterin believes this is the easiest path to fixing Ethereum\u2019s PoS issues.\n\nThen comes the Surge with a goal of 100,000 transactions per second on rollups. The Ethereum co-founder revealed that cross-rollup standards and interop have been highlighted as areas for long-term improvements, and 2024 will see significant progress on rollup scaling both on EIP-4844 and from rollups themselves.\n\nEthereum is also looking to fix its centralization issues through the Scourge. Per the roadmap, the focus will be on mitigating such concerns in the network\u2019s PoS design, especially around Maximal extractable value (MEV) and liquid staking or pooling. Buterin earlier recommended reducing the cost of running nodes to fix the challenge.\n\nEasing Block Verifications\n\nFurthermore, the roadmap mentioned the Verge, which could make block verification easier. Verkle trees are almost ready for inclusion, and soon, verifying blocks would only involve downloading some bytes of data, performing a few basic computations, and verifying a Succinct, Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (SNARK).\n\nThe network would explore Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) verification precompile to arrive at a fully SNARKed Ethereum.\n\nIn addition, the Purge will simplify the protocol, eliminate technical debts, and limit network participation costs, while the Splurge will fix everything else.\n\n\u201c\u2018Increase L1 gas limit\u2019 was removed to emphasize that the limit can be raised *at any time*; no need to wait for full SNARKs esp for small increases. \u2018State expiry\u2019 has been shrunk, to reflect a general consensus that it\u2019s a fairly low-priority and low-urgency item esp given stateless clients and PBS / execution tickets,\u201d Buterin explained."

A recent sequence of tweets by Buterin reveals that the emphasis for the year 2024 is mainly aligned with the components that have been formed since the beginning of the year: merge, surge, plague, verge, purge, and splurge. This indicates that the strategy for the year is more evolutionary than revolutionary.\n\nThe merging continues to be an essential component in the evolution of Ethereum. Putting an emphasis on the significance of single-slot finality (SSF), Buterin highlights the function that it plays in strengthening the Proof of Stake (PoS) architecture that was created after the merger. He makes the observation that SSF is gradually being seen as the most easy solution to the present limits of Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake architecture, which improves the network's security and efficiency at the same time.\n\nAdditionally, steady effort will be made on the surge in 2024, with the primary emphasis being on improving cross-rollup standards and interoperability with the objective of achieving a considerable increase in scalability over the long run. In the meanwhile, the plague is being rethought in order to fight the economic concentration that occurs in PoS. In accordance with Ethereum's philosophy of decentralisation, it entails addressing significant problems such as Miner Extractable Value (MEV) and general stake pooling concerns.\n\nThe verge is going to undergo significant revisions, the most important of which is going to be the incorporation of Verkle trees. Through this new development, the Layer 2 (L2) networks of Ethereum are going to be optimised, which will further improve the scalability and efficiency of the blockchain. However, Buterin's approach to the issue demonstrates a proactive posture on network improvements. This suggests that the gas limit for Ethereum may be raised at any moment, without requiring waiting for complete SNARKs. This is particularly true for modest enhancements.\n\nIn the year 2024, the purge will concentrate on simplifying the Ethereum protocol by decreasing the amount of space on hard drives that validators need to have and getting rid of data that is no longer relevant. This will result in storage being streamlined and network congestion being reduced. The phase includes a number of modest modifications that are designed to guarantee that the process will go smoothly after the preceding stages. This encompasses anything else that does not cleanly fall into the categories that came before it, but is necessary for the general health and effectiveness of the network.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Popular cryptocurrency trader, author of his own newsletter and a crypto podcaster Scott Melker has published a post on the Twitter/X platform, making an optimistic prediction for the Ethereum price for 2025.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMelker shared a price prediction, but then he specified that the price level he believes to occur was not for Bitcoin but for the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization value \u2014 Ethereum; and it was an ambitious $12,000 per coin.\n\nMy target for 2025 is $12,000.\n\n\n\nBut not for $BTC.\n\n\n\nFor $ETH. \u2014 The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) December 31, 2023\n\nDuring the last week of 2023, a popular cryptocurrency YouTuber Lark Davis also made a bullish prediction for the Ethereum price, but it was a little lower \u2014 $10,000 \u2014 and Davis did not specify when more or less exactly he expects that price level to be achieved.\n\nHowever, what Davis did share was 10 reasons why he expects cryptocurrency markets to explode in 2024.\n\nTen reasons why crypto markets may surge in 2024, per Davis\n\nLark Davis provided 10 important reasons why he believes that cryptocurrency markets will explode this year. The first on his list was the fact that stock markets are going parabolic right now with all the major market indexes growing. As a result, people are making a lot of money and have spare cash to invest in cryptocurrency in the near future.\n\nThe second one was the likely approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC regulator. He expects it to happen in Q1, which could be either in January or in March, if the SEC delays it in January.\n\nAmong the other reasons mentioned by Davis was the expected victory of the Coinbase exchange over the SEC in court; should this happen, this will indicate the ultimate loss suffered by the regulator in court. In 2023, the SEC was beaten by Grayscale and by Ripple Labs, when the judge ruled that secondary sales of XRP did not qualify as security sales. Besides, the SEC on its own initiative dropped personal cases against Ripple chief Brad Garlinghouse and its co-founder and former CEO Chris Larsen.\n\nDavis also named the upcoming fourth Bitcoin halving event in April this year and a massive wave of games based on Web3 where cryptocurrencies will be utilized as in-game currencies. Besides, the U.S. Fed considers starting to cut down interest rates this year."

        "content": "Closely followed crypto strategist and trader Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe is naming the top five altcoins he is bullish on in 2024.\n\nIn a new strategy video, Van de Poppe tells his 162,000 YouTube subscribers that his first top altcoin choice this year is the smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH).\n\nThe trader believes that money will soon flow from Bitcoin to ETH after BTC\u2018s significant rally to close out 2023.\n\nLooking at his chart, the trader suggests that ETH will rally to cross $3,400 later this year.\n\nHe also suggests that ETH against BTC (ETH/BTC) appears to have carved out a market bottom at around 0.0491 BTC ($2,221).\n\nThe ETH/BTC pair is trading for 0.05322 BTC ($2,377) at time of writing.\n\nHe also believes that if a spot market exchange-traded fund (ETF) is approved for Bitcoin, an Ethereum spot market ETF will soon get the nod and that would serve as a catalyst for an ETH rally.\n\nLastly, he suggests that ETH\u2019s deflationary nature, brought about by its switch to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, is not yet priced in by the market.\n\nNext up, the trader believes that ETH layer-2 scaling solution Arbitrum (ARB) is printing a bullish pattern against Bitcoin (ARB/BTC), putting in higher highs and higher lows.\n\nARB/BTC is trading for 0.0000393 BTC ($1.78) at time of writing. Looking at his chart, the trader suggests that Arbitrum will soar to 0.0000647 BTC ($2.93).\n\nHis next pick is another layer-2 scaling solution, Optimism (OP). He predicts that OP will correct down to the $2.78 range after its big rally and then bounce beyond the $4.50 level in the coming months.\n\nOptimism is trading for $4.01 at time of writing, up 4.3% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe fourth altcoin on the trader\u2019s list is the decentralized oracle network Chainlink (LINK).\n\nHe says LINK is starting to show strength against Bitcoin (LINK/BTC), printing a bullish pattern of higher lows and higher highs. He is closely watching to see if LINK/BTC breaks through a key resistance level at 0.000450 BTC ($20.36), which he says would indicate a massive breakout is underway.\n\nLINK/BTC is trading for 0.0003472 BTC ($15.71) at time of writing.\n\nLastly, the trader picks the newer ETH rival Sui (SUI). He says SUI has the potential to perform as strongly as Fantom (FTM), Avalanche (AVAX) and Polygon (MATIC) did in 2021.\n\nAt time of writing, SUI is worth $0.865.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "A passionate cryptocurrency and blockchain author qualified to cover every event in the crypto space. Researching minute occurrences and bringing new insights lie within the prime focus of my task.\n\nStory Highlights Crypto markets gain some momentum as the top crypto rises above the prolonged and extended consolidation zone\n\nDespite the formation of a strong base, some of the altcoins appear to trigger a significant pullback soon\n\nThe Bitcoin price rises above the pivotal range, suggesting the start of a healthy upswing that may transform into a bull run ahead. This has induced strong bullish momentum within the markets, due to which the popular tokens have soared by a decent margin. However, some altcoins like XRP & Avalanche (AVAX) are feared to lose their profits soon as the bears are about to knock on the door, causing a significant correction.\n\nRipple (XRP) Price Analysis\n\nThe XRP price has experienced significant bearish heat, which squashed all the gains incurred with the final judgement in the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit. The XRPArmy appeared to try hard to keep up the momentum, but the bears left no stone unturned in keeping the price within the range. The XRP price is trading within a bearish pattern and hence is believed to shed huge gains in the coming days.\n\nThe XRP price is trading within a descending triangle and has failed to surpass the upper resistance in recent times. Considering the current trade setup, it appears that the XRP price is trading under acute bearish influence. The token, which has been testing new support since July, is expected to maintain a steep declining trend, leading to a major drop soon. The triangle remains active, with the lower highs forming below EMA 50.\n\nAdditionally, the declining RSI suggests a major drop in volume, which substantiates the bearish claim. Hence, the price after reaching the apex is believed to drop close to the first support at $0.56, and if bulls fail to defend, a major drop below $0.5 may be imminent.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) Price Analysis\n\nThe avalanche price rally has raised eyebrows as the token has managed to surge above 400% since November. Despite this, the price failed to surpass the pivotal zone around $50, as it faced a major rejection at $49.96, causing a 20% drop. Although the token has triggered a rebound, the bulls appear to be incapable of maintaining an upswing.\n\nAfter producing a fine 480% rise since the September lows, the price trembled down as the volume marked new lows in December. The volume kept rising along waves 1 to 4, and through waves 4 to 5, the volume dropped, which may trigger a correction. The most revealing signal of all is the inverted cup or rounded top pattern, which suggests the top is in. Hence, one final surprise move before the correction.\n\nBesides, the AVAX price managed to close and stay below EMA21, which suggests a crash or correction could be on the horizon, which may end in a higher low compared to September before long-term growth."

These developments usually follow along a roadmap that has been laid out by Vitalik Buterin and his team.\n\nThis roadmap serves as a guiding framework for the continuous development of the Ethereum network.\n\nNew directions for Ethereum\n\nThe latest amendments to Ethereum\u2019s roadmap bring attention to crucial enhancements. The role of single slot finality (SSF) in post-Merge Proof-of-Stake (PoS) improvement takes center stage, offering a glimpse into the network\u2019s future direction.\n\nFor context, Single Slot Finality (SSF) means quickly and securely confirming transactions in just one time slot on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nBy popular demand, an updated roadmap diagram for 2023! pic.twitter.com/oxo58A2KuG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 30, 2023\n\nLooking at the finer details\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum is placing importance on long-term enhancements by working on making different parts of its technology compatible and interconnected.\n\nThese updates signal Ethereum\u2019s commitment to refining its infrastructure and improving scalability. The roadmap aims to address technical intricacies, making Ethereum more robust and interoperable.\n\nWhile these changes bring promises of a more sophisticated network, the question arises of whether these updates impact Ethereum in the long run.\n\nThe commitment to single-slot finality and advancements in tree structures could potentially enhance transaction speed. It would also impact the efficiency of the network.\n\nSome critiques\n\nHowever, not all sentiments were unanimously positive. Justin Bons, founder of Cyber Capital, voiced a critique that resonates with concerns about Ethereum\u2019s focus on Layer 2 (L2) scaling.\n\nAccording to Bons, the roadmap lacks a clear emphasis on Layer 1 (L1) scaling, arguing that Ethereum is pushing users toward custodian L2s, which may introduce censorship vulnerabilities.\n\nThis critique underscores a philosophical divergence in approach, with Bons advocating for a unified shelling point through L1 scaling.\n\n1/8) The roadmap released by @VitalikButerin today proves that ETH will never scale There is, in fact, zero L1 scaling on the roadmap Everything is focused on L2s instead of empowering people to use the blockchain directly That is not cypherpunk at allhttps://t.co/6WFqNd0sQf \u2014 Justin Bons (@Justin_Bons) December 31, 2023\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nAs the community grapples with differing perspectives, the price of ETH adds another layer to the narrative. At the time of writing, ETH is priced at $2,361.39, experiencing a modest decline of -1.21% in the last 24 hours.\n\nConcurrently, the trading volume around ETH also saw a decrease."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Faces One Key Obstacle On Its Way to $3500 - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "The price of Ethereum (ETH) could be well on its way to a breakout, facing off against one ikey obstacle on its ascension to $3500. Since the start of 2024, ETH has been on its way to an increase. Moreover, its weekly and daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) has shown bullish signs.\n\nAltogether Ethereum has seen notable increases since the start of October. JP Morgan has even projected it to perform better throughout 2024 than Bitcoin. Yet, for projections like this to come true, the asset will have to win its upcoming face-off at a critical resistance level.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu, Bitcoin & Ethereum: 3 Boldest Price Predictions For 2024\n\nEthereum Set to Propel Toward $3500\n\nHeading into the new year, excitement within the digital asset sector is at an all-time high. The performance of Bitcoin has led the way to gains mostly across the board. Subsequently, a potential Spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the first week of January could push all assets even higher in price.\n\nAlongside that, Ethereum (ETH) is set to face one crucial obstacle on its way toward the $3500 mark. Currently, the asset is trading at $2364 and is up more than 1.6% over the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. However, a massive rally could very well be in the cards.\n\nAlso Read: Solana Surpasses Ethereum in Google Searches\n\nSince May of 2022, Ethereum has seen growth alongside a support trend line. Moreover, that line has been validated a host of times since, with the most recent occurrence happening in October of last year. Additionally, BeInCrypto noted that the asset has produced eight candlesticks- a bullish indicator- in just 11 weeks. Currently, it is creating ninth.\n\nUltimately, if the RSI indicator remains above the 50 mark, then the bulls have certainly provided an advantage. Conversely, anything below 50 would show a clear victory for bears. The asset is facing resistance at $2,370, which could lead to a 40% increase that propels it well ahead of the $3,300 mark."

        "title": "Is Ethereum Finally Going to Break Above $2.4K? (ETH Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has encountered a significant obstacle at the critical $2.4K resistance, leading to an extended consolidation phase within this pivotal range.\n\nThis situation and the bullish sentiment in the futures market have heightened expectations for a potential bullish breakout.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: The Daily Chart\n\nA detailed examination of Ethereum\u2019s daily chart reveals an ascending consolidation period, with the price approaching a substantial resistance at $2.4K. This zone includes the static $2.4K resistance and aligns with the upper boundary of a multi-month wedge pattern, forming a robust barrier. Despite this, ETH is displaying bullish momentum, attempting to break above this crucial range. A successful breach could see the price reclaim the $2.4K resistance, setting the stage for a renewed bullish surge.\n\nHowever, considering the bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator, there is still a possibility of a bearish reversal.\n\nDespite the overall bullish market conditions, a sudden rejection may lead to a sustained cascade towards the 100-day and 200-day moving averages. Therefore, caution is advised during these market conditions, given the potential for sudden impulsive movements.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nExamining the 4-hour chart, Ethereum appears to be confined within a critical range, bordered by the substantial support at $2.1K and the significant resistance at $2.4K, resulting in sideways consolidation. Notably, the $2.1K level aligns with the crucial range between the 0.5 and 0.618 levels of the Fibonacci retracement, acting as a notable barrier against sellers.\n\nDespite this consolidation, the price has recently surged, reaching its prior major high near the $2440 mark. However, the outcome hinges on whether buyers can reclaim the $2.4K resistance. If successful, an ascending trend is likely. Conversely, a rejection could lead to a market decline towards the lower threshold of the range.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum\u2019s recent price performance has been notably bullish, bringing the market close to the $2.4 resistance region. However, a recent shift into a prolonged consolidation phase has raised questions among market participants about whether this marks the end of the mid-term bullish phase or is simply a correction.\n\nExamining the sentiment in the futures market becomes crucial to address this uncertainty. The provided chart illustrates funding rates, a valuable metric indicating the sentiment in the futures market by showing whether buyers or short-sellers are executing orders more aggressively. Positive values generally indicate a bullish sentiment, while negative values suggest pessimism among futures traders.\n\nNotably, the funding rates have consistently been positive, with recent trends showing an upward trajectory, signaling heightened bullish sentiment in the perpetual markets and fostering expectations for a bullish breakout. However, caution is advised, as excessively high funding rates could be interpreted as a bearish signal.\n\nThis scenario suggests the market might be on the verge of a long liquidation cascade. If such liquidations occur, the price is likely to experience a rapid decline toward the 200 and 100-day moving averages. Monitoring these metrics becomes crucial for anticipating potential shifts in market dynamics and adjusting strategies accordingly."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAs the new year unfolds, Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is charting a promising course. After a noteworthy surge in price on January 1st, it has consistently mirrored Bitcoin\u2019s bullish trajectory, sustaining its upward momentum into Tuesday.\n\nOver the past month, ETH consolidated after breaking above the $2,100 resistance level early last month and emerging from an ascending triangle pattern. Notably, after a successful retest of this area, Ethereum now seems poised for further gains, according to popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez.\n\nIn a post on X today, Martinez shed light on Ethereum\u2019s MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Pricing Bands, offering valuable insights into the cryptocurrency\u2019s potential upward movement. Notably, this indicator compares the current market value to the average cost of coins in circulation, providing traders with a tool to identify potential market tops and bottoms.\n\nSpecifically, when the values surpass \u20183.7,\u2019 it signals a potential market top, suggesting it might be prudent to consider selling positions. Conversely, values below \u20181\u2019 indicate a possible market bottom, signalling a negative MVRV value and prompting a strategic consideration for taking a gradual long position.\n\nAccording to Martinez, with the MVRV indicator currently positioned between the two values, Ethereum (ETH) is poised for a further surge, potentially reaching key price targets at $3,830 and $5,100.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier on Monday, Martinez expressed optimism, stating that Ethereum appears set for further gains, with no significant barriers ahead.\n\n\u201cEthereum looks set for further gains! The path ahead of ETH is clear, with no significant supply barriers in sight, suggesting a potential rise to $2,700 or beyond. Additionally, a robust demand wall at $2,000 provides solid support, potentially cushioning any corrections.\u201d He wrote.\n\nBeyond technical analysis, Ethereum\u2019s surge in institutional interest has become a prominent narrative. The holdings of Ethereum by institutions, both directly and indirectly through trusts, ETFs, and funds, experienced a sudden increase in November 2023. Notably, the allure for institutional investors lies in Ethereum\u2019s enhanced technical features, such as Ethereum 2.0 upgrades and improved smart contract functionalities, underscoring its long-term investment potential.\n\nThat said, looking ahead, Ethereum anticipates enhancements to its network, with Vitalik Buterin recently unveiling an ambitious roadmap for 2024. Notably, the visionary behind Ethereum plans to cultivate authentic decentralization, enhance the network\u2019s security, and refine its staking mechanisms. These initiatives align with a broader goal of establishing a sustainable business model for Ethereum and are poised to attract more investors to the network, potentially adding steam to ETH.\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $2,364, reflecting a 5.23% surge over the past 24 hours. In comparison, one of its biggest competitors, Solana, was priced at $116 after an impressive 11% surge during the same period."

Eligible tokens include USDC, TIA, USDT, ATOM, ETH, and SOL, with that program expected to begin about a week following the upcoming Dymension airdrop launch.\n\nDymension joins a growing list of networks and projects that are dropping their tokens lately, including recent high-profile airdrops from Jito and Pyth Network and upcoming drops from the likes of Jupiter, Starknet, Portal, Frame, and Blast.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSolana\u2019s surging fortunes of late have produced a surprising result in the NFT market: monthly sales volume of NFTs on the network beat that of NFTs on Ethereum in December 2023, for the first time ever.\n\nAccording to data from analytics platform CryptoSlam, Solana NFT sales tallied about $366.5 million worth in December compared to $353.2 million on Ethereum. CryptoSlam\u2019s \u201corganic\u201d sales figures exclude suspicious trades marked as \u201cwash trading,\u201d with about $381 million worth of Ethereum sales excluded and just $10.1 million worth of Solana sales pulled out.\n\nSolana\u2019s total of $366.5 million in trades nearly matched the network\u2019s all-time high, according to CryptoSlam, which was about $373.5 million worth in October 2021 as the space was just heating up. We\u2019ve seen daily Solana NFT sales volume pop above Ethereum at times, but never in terms of a full month\u2019s worth of trades.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSolana saw about double the amount of unique buyers and sellers in December too, and far more total NFT transactions. CryptoSlam reports about 218,000 sellers and 279,000 buyers on Solana across nearly 6.6 million NFT transactions. Compare that to about 114,000 sellers and over 143,000 buyers on Ethereum, across 698,000 transactions.\n\nEthereum\u2019s NFT sales volume in December was pretty much flat compared to November\u2019s total of almost $350 million worth, while Solana saw a surge from about $83 million worth then.\n\nOf course, Solana has seen its price rise dramatically of late. SOL is up over 71% in the past month, and has more than quadrupled in price over the past three months. Ethereum, by contrast, is up 9% in the last 30 days and about 44% since three months ago.\n\nSolana\u2019s price jump may be part of the reason why the value of its NFT sales spiked in December, but it doesn\u2019t account for the roughly tripled number of unique traders and sixfold increase on monthly NFT transactions. Also, the average NFT sale on Solana actually fell from about $74 in November to under $56 in December.\n\nThe surge in users and transactions may be due to broader momentum around Solana and hype around particular projects tied to potential access to airdrops and other perks. Tensorians, for example, the NFT project tied to leading Solana marketplace Tensor, saw $28 million worth of trades in December, while Mad Lads generated $24.5 million in trades.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to CryptoSlam, the top Ethereum NFT project in December was the Bored Ape Yacht Club with $19.5 million worth of NFT trades, with Pudgy Penguins following behind with about $18.3 million worth of trades.\n\nAt a glance, CryptoSlam\u2019s data suggests that Bitcoin Ordinals trades\u2014that is, the protocol that enables NFT-like media to be put on the Bitcoin blockchain\u2014generated more trading volume than Ethereum and Solana combined in December, with $881.2 million worth across over 493,000 transactions.\n\nHowever, CryptoSlam tracks Bitcoin Ordinals differently than it does NFTs on other networks. The data includes trading of BRC-20 tokens, which are minted via the Ordinals protocol but function like fungible, interchangeable tokens on other chains. CryptoSlam does not track the trading of Ethereum ERC-20 tokens or Solana SPL tokens, which are effectively similar to BRC-20 tokens.\n\nUncategorized Ordinals\u2014that is, various media assets that aren\u2019t part of a defined project\u2014made up about $88.5 million worth of trades in December, with the top individual Ordinals project being Bitcoin Frogs at $27.7 million.\n\nThe next-highest ranking individual Ordinals project that isn\u2019t a BRC-20 token? Bitcoin Punks, a CryptoPunks knockoff, with less than $3.3 million worth of trades in December. Fungible token trades make up an enormous portion of Ordinals trading tracked on the platform, making it difficult to take the Bitcoin figures at face value."

A global launch for Goldstation is planned.\n\nKlaytn Foundation and CREDER intend to expand beyond gold to tokenize more precious metals for the domestic and global markets.\n\nSINGAPORE, Jan. 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Klaytn Foundation, established to build and decentralize the ecosystem of South Korea's leading Layer 1 blockchain Klaytn, announced today that Klaytn Governance Council (GC) member CREDER has launched $GPC (Gold-Pegged Coin), a digital asset pegged to the real-time market price of gold; and Goldstation, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform for $GPC, on Klaytn.\n\nKlaytn Onboards Goldstation and $GPC, Launching the First Gold RWA DeFi Platform Outside of Ethereum\n\n$GPC marks two firsts in the RWA tokenization industry \u2014 it is the first tokenized gold to be available on DeFi outside of the Ethereum ecosystem, and also the first gold-pegged token that does not charge a percentage-based commission for transactions. These two attributes allow $GPC to truly deliver on the benefits of real-world asset tokenization, with Klaytn's low gas fees allowing individuals with small investment capital to add gold to their portfolios without gas fees eating a significant portion of their investment, and the lack of percentage-based fees ensuring that trading gold on-chain remains cost-effective regardless of the amount one wishes to transact.\n\nGoldstation also marks the first-ever gold real-world asset (RWA) token DeFi platform powered by a public mainnet other than Ethereum. It will commence its services, which includes $GPC staking and more, on 24 January 2024. Goldstation will transform gold investments from conventionally relying only on market profits, into DeFi interest revenue generation opportunities. In addition, Goldstation will serve as a hyper-efficient and more profitable gold investment destination, thanks to Klaytn's low transaction fees, high TPS capabilities, and support for the ERC-3643 tokenization standard.\n\nTo mint $GPC, users will need to first convert their gold assets into NFTs via The Mining Club, which is a platform operated by CREDER that proves users' unique digital ownership of real gold assets using blockchain technology. Once a user's gold assets are recorded as an NFT, they will be able to issue $GPC at Goldstation by placing their gold NFT as collateral. This entire physical gold to $GPC tokenization process can be easily carried out with a few clicks by connecting their crypto wallets that support Klaytn, such as Kaikas, Metamask, and Kakao KLIP.\n\nGoldstation is currently only available for South Korean residents, with plans for a global launch in the future.\n\nLeading up to the launch, Klaytn Foundation worked closely with CREDER, sharing its business network of leading domestic and foreign partners while cooperating for regulatory compliance, platform optimization, and domestic and global marketing. In addition, as Klaytn recently integrated support for the ERC-3643 tokenization standard, Klaytn Foundation and CREDER plan to comprehensively expand precious metals RWA tokenization beyond gold in the future.\n\n\"Gold NFTs and $GPC can be ledgered on-chain for anyone through Oracle Network's Proof of Reserve (POR),\" said James Lim, CEO of CREDER, \"we will create a new standard for RWA with Klaytn based on the power of transparency and trust that Web 3.0 finance will deliver.\"\n\n\"We are very pleased that Klaytn is the mainnet of choice for CREDER's Goldstation, the first gold RWA token DeFi platform outside of the Ethereum ecosystem,\" said Sam Seo, Representative Director of Klaytn Foundation. \"Klaytn Foundation has been working together with CREDER's meticulous preparation for $GPC and Goldstation. Moving forward, we will closely cooperate with them to deliver more diverse metal RWA tokenization projects for the domestic and global markets.\"\n\nAbout CREDER, Blockchain Financial Platform\n\nFounded in 2022, CREDER (CEO James Im) is a digital transformation (DX) company that is conducting Korea's first 100% real gold-based RWA (Real World Asset) tokenization business. It has developed a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that can utilize the issuance of gold NFTs and tokens linked to real gold. CREDER is currently the governance council (hereinafter referred to as GC) of Korea's leading global Layer 1 blockchain platform, Klaytn. More information about CREDER can be found at https://www.creder.biz.\n\nAbout Klaytn Foundation\n\nKlaytn Foundation was established in 2020 to expand the ecosystem of Klaytn, a global Layer 1 blockchain platform, and has since been actively collaborating with its Governance Council members worldwide. Klaytn Foundation facilitates the adoption and development of new technologies to ensure that Klaytn fulfills its role as an open, trusted, and sustainable blockchain platform for developers and users alike. It also facilitates decision-making to ensure that the ecosystem continues to expand optimally in the rapidly changing blockchain landscape. In line with its long-term Governance Roadmap, Klaytn Foundation plans to fully implement the Decentralization Phase of the Klaytn blockchain in 2023 and beyond.\n\nSOURCE Klaytn Foundation"

        "content": "Despite gains from ETC and BNB, investor attention seems to be shifting towards Rebel Satoshi, an emerging meme coin aiming to combat centralization in the crypto market.\n\nTLDR\n\nEthereum Classic gains 6% in a week, and analysts foresee more growth soon.\n\nBNB pumps 11% in a week, with more gains coming before the year ends.\n\nRebel Satoshi has generated a 100% ROI thus far, with more gains coming soon.\n\nAs the year nears its end, top altcoins like Ethereum Classic (ETC) and BNB (BNB) have recorded notable gains. However, investor sentiment is shifting to new tokens with low entry points and promising returns. This explains why Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ), an upcoming meme coin, is witnessing an influx of investors.\n\nWhy are Ethereum Classic and BNB investors lining up to invest in Rebel Satoshi? Continue reading to find out!\n\nEthereum Classic Surges 6% in a Week: More Gains Coming?\n\nEthereum Classic has performed decently over the past seven days. On December 19, ETC was trading at around $19.78. However, ETC started climbing on December 20 due to the bullish sentiment in the broader crypto market. With ETC being one of the earliest altcoins, this bullish sentiment saw it surge as high as $22.08 on December 22.\n\nNonetheless, ETC failed to hold these gains and started retracing its growth. By December 26, ETC had stabilized at around $21.09. This price means ETC has gained 6.62% in a week. So, why are ETC investors abandoning it despite its recent gains? Let\u2019s jump into expert predictions for December to determine whether it is a good idea to dump ETC now!\n\nPer experts, ETC will surge to close the year at $24.06. Experts peg this prediction on Ethereum Classic getting more adoption before the Spiral Network upgrade ships on January 31. This prediction makes Ethereum Classic a good crypto to buy!\n\nBNB Jumps 11% in a Week: Will Bulls Continue Charging?\n\nBNB has performed well over the past seven days. On December 19, BNB was changing hands at around $267.90. After trading sideways for days, BNB started surging on December 26 after Binance announced the opBNB festivities, which promised a $450,000+ giveaway.\n\nThis news saw BNB surge as high as $302.37 on December 26 before experiencing a slight correction to level off at $298.61. This price means BNB has gained 11.46% in a week. Based on this performance, is BNB a top crypto to buy for massive gains before the year ends?\n\nPer experts, BNB will continue its uptrend to close the year at $319.50. Experts base this prediction on BNB gaining more adoption after Binance reached a $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. authorities.\n\nRebel Satoshi Inches Closer to Its February Launch Date After Jumping 100%!\n\nRebel Satoshi, an emerging meme coin that aims to combat centralization in the crypto market, has attracted hordes of investors after completing Warriors Round 2 of its presale in 15 days. It is worth noting that Rebel Satoshi completed the Early Bird Round of its presale in three weeks before concluding Rebels Round 1 in ten days.\n\nThese growth metrics make Rebel Satoshi the fastest-growing meme coin. Rebel Satoshi has achieved these milestones due to $RBLZ. $RBLZ is Rebel Satoshi\u2019s governance and membership token. This means $RBLZ offers investors access to features like the Rebel NFT Vault, an NFT marketplace, a staking program, and a P2E game.\n\nAs of December, Rebel Satoshi was underway with Citizens Round 3 of its presale. During this round, the price for $RBLZ stood at $0.020. This price means Early Bird Round investors that bought $RBLZ at $0.010 have realized a 100% ROI.\n\nOn the other hand, Rebels Round 1 and Warriors Round 2 investors have seen the value of their $RBLZ investments surge 53.85% and 11.11%, respectively. More importantly, $RBLZ will generate a 25% ROI for Citizens Round 3 investors when it climbs to its listing price of $0.025. This forecast makes $RBLZ the best crypto to invest in now!\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram."

        "content": "On December 26, Finbold posted a short squeeze alert for January 2024, warning for massive possible liquidations early this month. In particular, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) were the forecasted top candidates for this speculated event, now proven accurate.\n\nThe short squeeze happened as expected, driving Bitcoin\u2019s price to new multi-year highs above $45,900 on January 2. Ethereum was traded as high as $2,446 after Finbold\u2019s alert, for a 10% surge one day after publishing. Interestingly, it was a similar increase to BTC\u2019s in a week \u2014 from publishing the alert to today\u2019s highs.\n\nIn this context, the price action liquidated 62,258 traders in the last 24 hours, for a total of $205.73 million in liquidations.\n\nA total of $127.13 million (61.7%) came directly from short positions, causing what is known as a short squeeze. Notably, one short-seller on Binance lost $10.16 million in a single liquidation with the BTC/USDT pair, according to CoinGlass data.\n\nLiquidation Heatmap on January 2. Source: CoinGlass\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum short-squeeze liquidations on January 2\n\nIn particular, Bitcoin dominated 45% (92.63 million) of the total daily liquidations on the cryptocurrency market. Of these, $74.32 million (80%) came from Bitcoin short-sellers.\n\nIt is possible to see how BTC managed to hit the previously reported liquidity zones in the weekly time frame.\n\nBTC 1-week Liquidation Heatmap. Source: Finbold\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum had a balanced liquidation weight among short and long positions. Its $32.28 million total liquidations originated from approximately 46% shorts and 54% longs.\n\nThese short-squeeze events highlight the risks of speculating in such a volatile market. Essentially, while retail traders build their positions, professional market makers are hunting the liquidity these operations leave behind. Traders must learn how to hedge their positions through proper risk management strategies.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum\u2019s monthly transaction count amounted to 36.02 million in January.\n\nThis is its highest monthly count since July 2022.\n\nDespite the surge in demand for the network, its NFT sales volume and DeFi TVL saw declines.\n\nEthereum (ETH) recorded a monthly transaction count of 36.02 million, marking its highest in 20 months.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum Price Prediction: $2,500 in sight as bullish metrics steer ETH back into the channel\n\nSurge in user activity\n\nProof-of-Stake network Ethereum (ETH) experienced a significant increase in activity in January, recording its highest monthly transaction count since July 2022, according to The Block Data dashboard. Information from the data provider showed that during the 31-day period, transactions on the network totaled 36.02 million.\n\nEthereum monthly transaction count\n\nA rise in a Network\u2019s Transaction Count is often due to a corresponding uptick in user activity. Data from The Block showed that in January, the daily number of unique addresses that were active on Ethereum, either as a sender or receiver, rose by 4%. The Daily Active Addresses on Ethereum was 14.1 million, the highest recorded since October 2022.\n\nEthereum\u2019s NFT and DeFi verticals lose steam\n\nWhile the network saw an increase in user activity, the growth markers of Ethereum\u2019s non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystems showed a decline in both verticals in January.\n\nTo assess the performance of a network\u2019s NFT ecosystem, its sales volume is considered. Data from CryptoSlam showed that in January, NFT sales volume on Ethereum plummeted by 2%. According to the data provider, 138,465 NFT transactions were completed on the chain with a sales volume of $356 million.\n\nInterestingly, the fall in Ethereum\u2019s sales volume did not mirror the general market\u2019s performance. According to data from NFTGo, the total volume of NFT sales across all collections in January climbed by 41%.\n\nRegarding Ethereum\u2019s DeFi sector, it witnessed a 7% dip in its Total Value Locked (TVL) in the last month, per data from DefiLlama. At press time, Ethereum\u2019s DeFi TVL was $31.85B\n\nDouble-digit decline in network fees and revenue\n\nDespite the surge in user activity and demand for Ethereum in January, it took a significant hit to its transaction fees and revenue.\n\nEthereum Monthly Fee and Revenue\n\nData from Token Terminal showed that during the period under review, users paid a total of $213 million in fees to use Ethereum. This marked a 34% decline from the $325 million the network received as user fees in December.\n\nLikewise, the revenue it derived from last month\u2019s fees plunged by 37%. In January, Ethereum\u2019s monthly revenue totaled $179 million. In December, it was almost $290 million.\n\nWith the consistent sideways movement in ETH\u2019s price, the network may witness a decline in demand in February unless market sentiment improves. Should this happen, network fees and revenue may plunge further."

        "content": "What you'll learn 2024 might be the dawn of KYC'd DeFi.\n\nModularity is DeFi's new shiny toy.\n\nHow many times can one Ether be staked?\n\nEach year that goes by, the world of decentralised finance \u2014 which began in earnest in 2020 \u2014 becomes more and more complex.\n\nWhat started out as a handful of simple Ethereum apps enabling users to swap or lend against tokens is now a sprawling metropolis of interconnected protocols, each clawing to capture as much of the $52 billion DeFi market as possible.\n\nMaking sense of it all is hard \u2014 even more so now that the DeFi ecosystem is spread out over more than 200 different blockchains.\n\nTo help make sense of the latest trends in DeFi, DL News has identified key developments that are sure to make waves in 2024.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nUniswap\u2019s \u2018Hooks\u2019 let developers make custom features\u2014like KYC\n\nBack when Uniswap first revealed its new Hooks function as part of Uniswap v4, onlookers immediately warned that it could be used to create liquidity pools with compliance requirements, such as know-your-customer checks.\n\nSome DeFi puritans said Hooks were antithetical to the founding principles of DeFi \u2014 namely its permissionless nature.\n\nBut others argue that permissioned Uniswap pools may benefit DeFi by removing the very real fear among institutions of inadvertently interacting with entities sanctioned by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control through DeFi protocols.\n\nAs Uniswap is the furthest along in providing optional KYC functionality via Hooks, such a development should reinforce the protocol\u2019s moat and competitiveness, said VanEck.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nIf permissioned DeFi does start to gain traction with traditional financial players, Uniswap Hooks will likely be where it starts.\n\nEigenLayer will make Ethereum more modular\n\nIn recent years, Ethereum has grown beyond the confines of the main Ethereum network and now encompasses more than a dozen so-called layer 2 blockchains, too.\n\nWhile these layer 2 chains offer vastly reduced fees and faster transactions, they also introduce a significant problem: a fracturing of Ethereum\u2019s trust network because transaction validation happens outside of the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nValidation involves checking if transactions conform to the blockchain\u2019s rule.\n\nWhile layer 2s ultimately send all transactions that happen on them back to the Ethereum mainnet for finality, they require an outside validation network to do so. Finality is when validated transactions are rendered irreversible on the blockchain.\n\nCurrently, the companies building layer 2s handle this validation themselves in a centralised manner. But most, if not all, have expressed a desire to decentralise their validation as much as possible.\n\nThat\u2019s where much-hyped protocols like EigenLayer come in.\n\nEigenLayer will let the blockchains built on top of Ethereum, as well as other protocols like decentralised oracle networks, tap back into mainnet validation for their various validation needs.\n\nThe desired result is a more efficient and aligned validation system that covers not just the main Ethereum chain but also everything else that relies on it for transaction validation.\n\nIf EigenLayer becomes successful, Ethereum should start to resemble modular blockchains like Cosmos, Celestia or Polkadot but with a much more decentralised validation network. Modular blockchains work by separating network functions into special layers instead of their monolithic counterparts like Bitcoin and Ethereum that try to handle all functions on one layer.\n\nEigenLayer has also taken things beyond validation. It\u2019s also working on EigenDA, a way to help layer 2s scale by providing extra data availability.\n\nIt is fair to say that EigenLayer\u2019s full launch could be the spark that reignites interest in Ethereum and its many layer2 networks in 2024.\n\nFor investors, EigenLayer offers a tantalising prospect by letting them restake their staked Ether, thus offering even more yields. But restaking has also caused some anxiety among the Ethereum community.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned restaking, if constructed poorly, could threaten the network\u2019s stability.\n\nEchoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are also wary that that restaking may lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d\n\nEigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan told DL News in May that he understands the fear and the project moves cautiously.\n\nBig names set to launch on Celestia\n\nEigenLayer isn\u2019t the only project offering the magic combination of modularity and data availability.\n\nCelestia is doing the same, but instead of operating through a set of smart contracts on Ethereum, it uses a purpose-built blockchain.\n\nRather than having to create a validation network themselves, blockchains can build on or migrate to Celestia to benefit from the validation and data availability provided by the project\u2019s main blockchain.\n\nSo far, only a handful of blockchains \u2014 or settlement layers \u2014 have been deployed on Celestia. But some big names are set to deploy in 2024.\n\nBerachain, which raised $42 million in its April Series A, is likely the most well-known among DeFi natives. But lesser-known projects, like Neutrino and Layer N, shouldn\u2019t be overlooked.\n\nA number of existing infrastructure projects such as cross-chain bridge Axelar, Optimism\u2019s OP Stack, and the Cosmos SDK framework have also opted to integrate with Celestia.\n\nWith so much potential, Celestia\u2019s growing ecosystem will likely be one of the biggest stories of the coming year.\n\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

        "content": "Ethereum price steadied the uptrend, starting the New Year bullish with a breakout above $2,400. The leading smart contracts token extended the upper leg to $2,432, compelling investors to believe in the likelihood of a breakout to $3,000.\n\nHowever, caution is advised especially among traders who intend to enter new long positions and those contemplating either closing current open positions or hanging onto the bullish theory.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: What Will It Take To Reach $3,000?\n\nCrypto analyst Rekt Capital said via X that Ethereum \u201cmay have no choice\u201d but to rally in tandem with Bitcoin, which broke above $45,000 on the first day of the New Year.\n\nThe analysts highlighted a breakout from a period of consolidation suggesting that it is only a matter of time before the tailwind behind ETH price intensifies resulting in a remarkable rally.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum price is trading at $2,369 amidst a correction from the previous highs. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals that sellers are gaining ground and fast. With a strength of 59 from highs close to the overbought region, the path with the least resistance could remain downwards.\n\nIf the short-term support at $2,360 holds, Ethereum price might cut short the forming downtrend while favoring the continuation of the uptrend to $3,000.\n\nThe 20 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (in blue) and the 50-day EMA (in red) are in line to absorb the selling pressure if the decline intensifies over the coming sessions.\n\nThe same RSI is slightly bullish in longer timeframes like on the daily chart. Based on the trend strength indicator, those holding Ethereum do not need to worry about the lower time frames\u2019 ups and downs but focus on the potential gains likely to follow the consolidation between $2,200 support and $2,400 resistance.\n\nThe 20-day EMA reinforces support at $2,280 while the 50-day EMA holds to provide support at $2,179. If Ethereum price overshoots the pivotal level at $2,000, the 200-day EMA (purple) would be in line to prevent losses from reaching the local support at $1,850.\n\nAn incoming buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator could help steady the bullish thesis. As traders and investors seek more exposure to ETH, the path with the least resistance is bound to remain upwards.\n\nRecommended for you: Ethereum (ETH) Price Poised for 2-3x Gains As Per These On-Chain Indicators\n\nEthereum Open Interest Above $7.5B\n\nThe Ethereum futures open interest (OI) is growing steadily to hold above $7.5 billion on Tuesday, according to data provided by Coinglass.\n\nThe persistent rise in OI interest signals that investors entertain a positive outlook for ETH. This backs the bullish narrative in the short term, with Ethereum likely to blast off above $3,000 before the end of January.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Ethereum has released its roadmap for 2024, focusing on scalability, security, and sustainability improvements.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin announced the plan on social media on Dec. 31, outlining several key initiatives for the platform\u2019s development.\n\nEnhancements in scalability\n\nIn 2022, Ethereum underwent a significant change known as \u2018The Merge,\u2019 transitioning from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. The transition is expected to reduce the platform\u2019s energy consumption and lay the groundwork for future enhancements.\n\n\u2018The Surge,\u2019 a crucial component of Ethereum\u2019s roadmap, aims to increase network scalability through data sharding. By dividing the blockchain into smaller parts, Ethereum intends to boost its transaction processing capabilities and reduce costs, addressing one of the most pressing issues faced by blockchain technologies today.\n\nThis development is expected to bring Ethereum closer to achieving its goal of processing over 100,000 transactions per second, as noted by Buterin in recent statements.\n\nNetwork streamlining and future research\n\n\u2018The Scourge\u2019 and \u2018The Verge\u2019 focus on enhancing network security and user experience, respectively.\n\nThe Scourge is designed to tackle potential security vulnerabilities and improve the robustness of the network, including the challenges posed by Miner Extractable Value (MEV) and liquidity pooling.\n\nOn the other hand, The Verge aims to streamline user experiences and provide improved tools for developers, making Ethereum more accessible and efficient.\n\nThe roadmap also includes \u2018The Purge\u2019 and \u2018The Splurge.\u2019\n\nThe Purge involves removing outdated code to improve network efficiency and security.\n\nMeanwhile, The Splurge represents an investment in Ethereum\u2019s future, exploring emerging technologies like zero-knowledge proofs and rollups and fostering innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nFoundational principles\n\nButerin has emphasized the need for Ethereum to reconnect with its original cypherpunk vision, which prioritizes decentralized applications, privacy protection, and peer-to-peer communication.\n\nThis includes integrating rollups and zero-knowledge proofs to enable more private and censorship-resistant applications on the Ethereum network.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 2024 roadmap reflects a comprehensive strategy to address current challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities in the blockchain space. With a focus on scalability, security, sustainability, and staying true to its foundational principles, Ethereum is poised to strengthen its position as a leader in the digital currency ecosystem."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) may be experiencing a major drawdown at the moment, however, on-chain data points to a potential run in price in the short to mid-term.\n\nNext Ethereum (ETH) Price Target Locked\n\nAccording to on-chain market analyst, Ali Martinez, Ethereum currently has no significant barrier ahead of it judging by the In and Out of the Money Around Price indicator from crypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThis data shows that a total of 7.82 million addresses or 65.4% of the total wallets in the network are in the money, or profitable at the moment. This is compared with the 4.13 million addresses or 34.5% that are out of the money or in losses. Ethereum holders that are at break-even points or \u201cAt The Money\u201d are just approximately 12,430 or 0.10% of the total wallets in the network.\n\nTo Martinez, since there are no supply barriers in sight, Ethereum could ultimately soar as high as $2,700 in the short term, a level beyond the $2,500 conservative projection. Should this feat be achieved, Ethereum would be retesting a price level last seen in early May 2022.\n\nThis price call, though ambitious, is a big shift from current reality. At the time of writing, Ethereum was trading for $2,310.95, up by 0.28% in the past 24 hours as it tries to wriggle away from the mild losses accrued as the new year unfolds. Over the past week, Ethereum has still maintained a mildly bullish outlook, having surged by 1.12%.\n\nEthereum Versus Alternative Chains\n\nEthereum is facing an existential threat from some of the key rivals that surround it including Solana (SOL), XRP Ledger, Avalanche (AVAX), and Cardano (ADA) to mention a few.\n\nWhile the growth of Ethereum has been relatively poor compared to these alternatives, Solana has expanded its influence over the former with the visible flippening happening to DEX volumes and other core areas.\n\nIn addition, Solana has recorded a more bullish price action when compared to the past year as SOL jumped as high as 989% while Ethereum has only managed to print 94.16% over the past year. Other chains like Cardano and the XRPL are also innovating in a way that proves they are fully ready to evolve in the coming months."

        "content": "Ethereum is still the leading Dapp chain. It comes with a first mover advantage. Furthermore, it offers security, due to its size, to all projects and L2s. It also offers a thriving consumer crypto ecosystem.\n\nIn this article, we dig into 10 apps to watch out for in 2024. So, let\u2019s take a closer look at what 10 interesting apps Ethereum has to offer in 2024. This is the first part.\n\n1) Interface\n\nInterface is a mobile explorer. It allows you to follow wallets. This, in turn, allows you to see their activity. The app has a few tricks up its sleeve. For example, you can view other accounts based on common assets. Or how about finding other users you follow on other platforms?\n\nHowever, one of its top features is the push notification option. It allows you to see what your friends are up to in real time. What are they minting or trading. Never miss out on trendy events, like hot meme coins.\n\nTo date, they have raised $1.4 million. That\u2019s after an initial crowdfunding campaign. This campaign netted the platform 50 ETH back in early 2022. Before you can enter the app, you need to meet some criteria. These show that you have some Web3 experience.\n\nFollow creators on Interface -> get notified when a new article is published -> be first to mint -> earn Mirror Protocol rewards. https://t.co/Eb2cG7Ym4I \u2014 Interface (@interfacedapp) December 19, 2023\n\n2) Zora\n\nZora is an NFT marketplace. The platform dates to 2020 when it was founded. It\u2019s also a Layer 2 on Ethereum. Zora has plenty of cool features. For instance, there\u2019s a no-code creator tool kit. You can create collections with ease and put them up for minting.\n\nAnd guess what, the Zora chain doesn\u2019t have a token yet. So, being active on Zora, and mint regularly, may help you to qualify for their airdrop. You can mint on Zora or other NFT marketplaces, that you can find on the Zora chain. For example, mint dot fun.\n\nThey also have a cool referral program. If you bring in creators, you get 0.000111 ETH per mint. That can quickly add up to an interesting amount of ETH.\n\nWe made it rewarding:\n\n\u2737 No create fees\n\n\u2737 Protocol Rewards\n\n\u2737 Mint + create referrals\n\n\u2737 First minter rewards\n\n\u2737 Splits + so much more \u2014 Zora (@ourZORA) December 31, 2023\n\n3) Brian\n\nWith Brian, we move into the AI space. That\u2019s one of the narratives that has a lot of growth potential in 2024. Brian has a specific feature that makes it stand out. It gives prompts in English. It offers three different bots that you can deploy. There\u2019s a Telegram, X, and website bot available.\n\nThe app is also noncustodial. This is of importance because you stay in control of your assets. The project already has a token, BRAIN. Their website is brainai.tech. Brain advertises itself as the first blockchain AI SaaS offering. Besides the contextual chat, staking and NFT minting are in the pipeline. Currently, Brian is only available as a mobile version.\n\nSo, next time, you can tell the app, \u201cHi Brian, please swap 150 OP to BRAIN on Uniswap\u201d. How cool is that?\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Five FAQs for all the new @BrianknowsAI users! 1. What is Brian? Brian is an AI assistant that allows users to perform transactions, research web3 info and data, and deploy smart contracts by prompting. These operations are already available in the Brian App, which is in\u2026 pic.twitter.com/4znzAz0zM3 \u2014 Brian (@BrianknowsAI) December 29, 2023\n\n4) Warpcast\n\nWarpcast is like Twitter. It\u2019s a social media app on the Farcaster protocol. It offers a lot of Web3 features. However, you can also port your following into various other apps. Now that is a real special feature. Wherever you go on Ethereum, you will see familiar faces this way. It\u2019s like making Ethereum your hood!\n\nAs a result, their X profile is not very active. Their last X post dates to 16th August 2023. Instead, you can create an account and join their conversation in real time. It\u2019s a decentralized app that wants to give data ownership back to its users. That\u2019s you.\n\nThe team behind Warpcast is former Coinbase staff. So, it seems like a solid team with a Web3, and crypto background is at the helm. The picture below shows the X based messages.\n\nSource: Warpcast\n\n5) Privy\n\nPrivy is an embedded wallet for Web3 logins. You can onboard users to a Web3 app, regardless if they already have a wallet or not. You most likely have used it, without knowing or realizing it. Not only that, but you can sign in with an email or password. At the same time, a wallet already works in the background. A convenient option for Web2 users to get into Web3.\n\nIn November, the team had a series A funding round that netted $18 million. So, they seem financially sound. They\u2019re backed by some heavy weights. For example, Sequoia, Paradigm, or Electric Capital. Furthermore, the team offers secure solutions for their app. You can also customize the app, which helps with integration in your very own app.\n\n1/ Transaction MFA \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Wallets are not one-size-fits-all. As assets grow in a user\u2019s account, it becomes important to layer on additional security measures. Privy now offers the ability for users to require successful MFA verification prior to embedded wallet transactions. pic.twitter.com/JKFPq1q1bV \u2014 Privy (@privy_io) December 20, 2023\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information discussed by Altcoin Buzz is not financial advice.

        "title": "Ethereum's Primed To Lead the Altcoin Rally: After a 9% Price Increase, ETH Targets $2500 - Crypto Reporter",
        "content": "Ethereum has been rising rapidly in the last few weeks, with gains of 18% on the 30d chart. After an increase of 9% in the last few days, the top altcoin aims to hit $2,500.\n\nSome market professionals argue that Ethereum will lead this surge because of the increase in its value. However, another altcoin named Meme Moguls has emerged in the market to give ETH a run for its money. Let\u2019s see how they can perform well if markets are going up high.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Surges By 9%, Will It Cross $2,500?\n\nEthereum (ETH) is beginning to pick up the pace after a rather slow start in the bull market. Ethereum has marked a 2023 high of $2,445 after its recent 9% price increase. Analysts have been excited about the rally, although its price has dropped to $2,330.\n\nThe increase in the price of Ethereum can be liked by several events. A significant reason is the approval of a spot ETF that has caused huge excitement in the crypto space.\n\nAn increase in the interest of decentralized finances (DeFi) has also been observed on the network. The recent purchase of BTC worth $615 million serves as a secure base for Ethereum (ETH) to move towards the upside, according to Jordi Alexander, the CIA of Selini Capital.\n\nHe has said that the ETH price will hit a big rally by breaking $2,500 in the next few weeks. Alexander added that at the start of January 2024, the stakes and rewards will be high for Ether. Pentoshi is another trader who also has a similar bullish take.\n\nPentoshi has said the price of Ethereum is $3,485 bound and is one of the top crypto coins to buy. But in order to raise the value of Ethereum, bulls must overcome $2,500. On the flip side, Meme Moguls have come up as a top altcoin with more momentum.\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS): The Dark Horse of the Bull Market\n\nThe popularity of Ethereum means it is one of the most talked about cryptocurrencies. However, while it has been predicted to rally in 2024, Meme Moguls (MGL) is one project that has shown enough potential to outperform the market.\n\nMeme Moguls has created the world\u2019s first DeFi project that blends investing and memes. The platform provides users with an innovative way to manage and grow their wealth by interacting with the meme-based marketplace.\n\nThis is how they can learn new investing strategies. A total amount of $100,000 will be given to new users to test their ideas and improve them on this new blockchain ICO.\n\nThere will also be many contests and matches through which students can win exciting prizes. A significant benefit, is to be able to withdraw the rewards will create an amazing passive income opportunity, which makes it even more interesting.\n\nMeme Moguls had a surge in activity in December as a result of its innovative new model. This has aided the rise of its native token, MGLS, to $0.0025. Analysts predict a 20x price increase for MGLS once the blockchain ICO gathers popularity and launches in early 2024.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nEthereum\u2019s recent price increase and strong fundamentals suggest that it is well-positioned to lead the altcoin rally. While ETH is expected to rally in the first quarter of 2024, Meme Moguls looks set to outperform the altcoin market. While still underpriced, now is a great opportunity to stack MGLS tokens before it becomes one of the top crypto coins.\n\nVisit Meme Moguls\n\nDisclaimer: The statements, views and opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the content provider and do not necessarily represent those of Crypto Reporter.

        "content": "Mon 01 Jan 2024 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Eddy S.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the renowned co-founder of Ethereum, has recently revealed the roadmap and vision for the network in 2024. In a series of posts, he detailed the 6 main components that will shape Ethereum this year. Here\u2019s an overview of the strategic directions for the network\u2019s development in 2024.\n\nSingle-slot finality at the heart of technical improvements\n\nOne of the key points of the roadmap is the development of single-slot finality (SSF). This mechanism aims to reinforce the irreversibility of blocks on Ethereum. The SSF allows for locking in changes in a block, except in the case of a major attack.\n\nFor Buterin, the SSF seems to be the ideal solution to address the current weaknesses of proof of stake. By consolidating irreversibility, it would greatly improve the resilience and security of the consensus. Therefore, the SSF appears as the cornerstone of the upcoming technical efforts.\n\nBack to the cypherpunk roots of the initial vision\n\nButerin also recalled his original vision for Ethereum, rooted in the cypherpunk legacy. He wanted it to be a kind of \u201cdecentralized hard drive\u201d using cryptography. But this aspect has faded since 2017 with the rise of financial features.\n\nAccording to Vitalik Buterin, recent innovations like rollups or ZK-Snarks could help reconnect with the cypherpunk values. Thus, returning Ethereum\u2019s technological and liberating dimension is part of the goals for 2024.\n\nOther pillars of Ethereum\u2019s development in 2024\n\nAside from single-slot finality and a return to a more cypherpunk vision, Buterin has outlined several other key directions for the ongoing development of Ethereum in 2024 in his roadmap:\n\nImproving scalability through rollups and sharding\n\nStrengthening the decentralization of validation nodes\n\nOptimizing user experience to attract more developers\n\nContinuing with security updates and protocol upgrades\n\nIncorporating innovations from recent academic research\n\nThe ultimate goal is to make Ethereum a reference blockchain, combining security, decentralization, high processing capacity, privacy, and innovation capacity. An extremely ambitious program that will require cutting-edge technical advancements in the years to come.\n\nThrough this roadmap, Vitalik Buterin sketches the contours of a more technically proficient Ethereum that remains true to its cypherpunk roots. Realizing this ambitious vision will involve innovations like single-slot finality. The plan for 2024 offers a fascinating glimpse into the developments to come for Ethereum.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "A popular crypto analyst believes that the current upside potential for Bitcoin is limited despite the possible approval of spot market BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nWidely followed strategist Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe tells his 680,000 followers on the social media platform X that the top crypto asset by market cap will rally somewhere between $48,000 and $52,000 if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves BTC ETFs sometime in January.\n\nHowever, Van de Poppe says he envisions BTC hitting a new all-time high in late 2024.\n\n\u201cMy vision for the Bitcoin price action remains the same. I expect we\u2019re relatively capped to the upside with the spot ETF approval news. Perhaps peaking at $48,000-$52,000 and then a relatively calm period of sideways, range-bound price action until a new ATH (all-time high) in late 2024.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading for $42,391 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last day.\n\nMoving on to the top smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH), Van de Poppe says that he believes the top altcoin is bottoming out against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC), adding that Q1 2024 would be a \u201creasonable period\u201d for ETH.\n\n\u201cEthereum shows signals of a potential bottom. As I suspect Bitcoin to be close to finalizing this upward run, I think Ethereum will start to take over. Based on historical price actions, multiple signals of a potential reversal + Q1 is a reasonable period for Ethereum.\u201d\n\nLooking at the trader\u2019s chart, he seems to predict that ETH/BTC will rally to 0.12 BTC ($5,088) by April 2024. At time of writing, ETH/BTC is worth 0.05384 BTC ($2,282).\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "At the end of the day, Ethereum's recent price movements reflect a pattern of buyers stepping in during dips, signaling a quest for value opportunities.\n\nEthereum's recent trading sessions have exhibited some fluctuations, but it appears that buyers are stepping in during brief dips.\n\nThis pattern suggests that market participants are actively seeking value opportunities.\n\nThe driving force behind this trend seems to be the anticipation of ample liquidity stemming from the United States, as the Federal Reserve is expected to implement rate cuts in 2024. This has injected added momentum into the cryptocurrency markets.\n\nForex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list\n\nWhen analyzing the support levels, the $2,100 mark stands out as a crucial support zone. Not only has it previously acted as resistance, but it also coincides with the presence of the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, which naturally garners attention from traders.\n\nSimilarly, the 20-day EMA has demonstrated its effectiveness in providing significant support. In essence, Ethereum currently benefits from multiple layers of support, which reinforces the notion that it may be only a matter of time before it experiences a substantial upward movement.\n\nThe $2,500 level could potentially serve as a point of resistance in the short term. However, surpassing this hurdle opens the door to further gains, with the $2,750 level representing the next potential target. Beyond that, the $3,000 level looms as a viable objective. It's important to recognize that Ethereum's ascent relies heavily on a robust risk appetite. Presently, indications suggest there is a favorable level of risk appetite in the market.\n\nMomentum and Consolidation\n\nNonetheless, it is important to acknowledge that Ethereum has recently experienced a notable upward surge. Consequently, it is sensible to anticipate a period of consolidation to alleviate some of the excess enthusiasm that has built up over the past few weeks.\n\nAdditionally, the prevailing liquidity conditions must be taken into consideration. Many traders, particularly institutional ones, are expected to be away from their trading desks during this timeframe. While Ethereum may not attract as much institutional trading activity as Bitcoin, it can still influence overall market behavior.\n\nAt the end of the day, Ethereum's recent price movements reflect a pattern of buyers stepping in during dips, signaling a quest for value opportunities. The anticipation of increased liquidity resulting from US rate cuts in 2024 has provided added impetus to the cryptocurrency markets. Ethereum boasts multiple layers of support, with $2,100 and the associated 50-day EMA being significant. The short-term outlook points to resistance around $2,500 but surpassing this level could open the door to further gains. However, a degree of consolidation is expected to work off the recent momentum, and the influence of liquidity conditions should not be underestimated.\n\nReady to trade ETH/USD?

        "content": "Ethereum has recently witnessed a notable development with the unveiling of its 2024 roadmap by co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Released in a series of informative posts on December 30, the roadmap has stirred the market, giving a promising trajectory for Ethereum\u2019s value. Ethereum (ETH)price stands at $2,281, with a slight 0.41% dip in the last 24 hours.\n\nBy popular demand, an updated roadmap diagram for 2023! pic.twitter.com/oxo58A2KuG advertisement \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 30, 2023\n\nCentral to Ethereum\u2019s strategy is \u2018The Merge,\u2019 a landmark shift to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, first implemented in 2022. This transformative change marked Ethereum\u2019s shift from the energy-intensive proof-of-work model, showering a new era of efficiency and sustainability for the network. The Merge has been instrumental in Ethereum\u2019s progressive journey, significantly reducing its energy consumption and setting the stage for future innovations.\n\nInnovations and Market Response\n\nThe roadmap emphasizes Ethereum\u2019s commitment to enhancing blockchain stability and security. A key highlight is the focus on single-slot finality (SSF), a feature aimed at fortifying blockchain transactions. The roadmap addresses the Scourge priority, which focuses on mitigating economic centralization challenges, particularly in MEV (Miner Extractable Value) and liquid stake pooling.\n\nThese strategic developments have strengthened Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure and boosted market confidence. Consequently, there\u2019s growing anticipation of Ethereum reaching the $5,000 mark, driven by these roadmap revelations and positive market forecasts. Prominent crypto figure Raoul Pal and industry expert Arthur Hayes shared a recent video underscoring Ethereum\u2019s expanding influence and potential growth.\n\nTechnical Indicators and Market Trends\n\nEthereum\u2019s price analysis shows ETH has been fluctuating between $2,100 and $2,250 in recent months, exhibiting a bullish bias. The asset has surged over 90% in the past year, signaling the more buyers have been coming to the market.\n\nTechnical indicators reveal mixed signals as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart suggests a balancing act between bearish and bullish forces. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) hints at a potential trend reversal. The convergence of the 50-day and 200-day moving averages indicates a long-term bullish trend. The narrowing of Bollinger Bands points towards reduced volatility, possibly setting the stage for an upcoming price surge.\n\nEthereum Continues Trading Above $2,200 Amid Bearish Pressure\n\nIn the 4-hour chart, the Ethereum price has been trading around the $2,200 mark where buyers successfully defended against a further drop. This support zone triggered a rebound, with ETH climbing back to a supply zone at $2,304. Notably, this level has seen the formation of several double bottoms, a potential bullish reversal pattern.\n\nETH\u2019s recent trading session witnessed Ethereum bulls gaining enough strength to breach and the prices nearly broke the minor resistance at $2,400. Following this breakout, ETH ascended to an intraday high of $2,371, aligning closely with the 10-simple moving average, which currently sits at $2,317.\n\nThe broader market sentiment, as indicated by 25 major indicators, leans heavily towards a bullish bias with 15 indicators signaling \u2018buy\u2019, 9 staying neutral, and only 2 suggesting \u2018sell\u2019. Oscillators present a more mixed view with 8 neutral, 2 sell, and 1 buy signals. The Moving Averages echo the bullish sentiment strongly, with 14 buys, 1 neutral, and no sells. However, the MACD remains negative at 35.3 on the 4-hour chart, indicating a sell signal, while the RSI at 54.9 is in the neutral zone.\n\nLooking ahead, the bulls are targeting the $2,400 level, following a decisive move above the 10-day EMA 10 ($2,291.9). Should the bears take full control at current levels, ETH might retreat to its main support at EMA 100 ($2,038.39). A failure to hold this support could see Ethereum descend towards EMA 50 and SMA 50, around $2,170. Such a move would open the possibility of a downturn below the $2,000 threshold, a crucial psychological level for the market.\n\nAlso read:"

        "title": "Arbitrum's Native Token Surges 30% in a Week to an All-Time High, Fueled by Market Expectations of EIP-4844 ... - Unchained",
        "content": "ARB\u2019s milestone comes less than one week after OP, the token of rival layer-2 rollup Optimism, reached an all-time high.\n\nThe native governance token for the blockchain Arbitrum (disclosure: sponsor of Unchained) reached an all-time high Tuesday morning.\n\nARB climbed to a peak of $1.83, growing nearly 13% in the past 24 hours and about 30% in the past seven days, according to data from CoinGecko. The token has since slid to $1.71 at press time.\n\nArbitrum is a layer 2 scaling technology that aims to make Ethereum more efficient by bundling many transactions and posting them on Ethereum\u2019s digital ledger book. Through Arbitrum, users can execute transactions on Ethereum more quickly and cheaply.\n\nWith more than $10 billion in value locked in its smart contracts, Arbitrum is the largest layer 2 rollup, data from L2BEAT shows.\n\nThe ARB token, airdropped to community members in March 2023, is a governance token that enables token holders to vote on protocol upgrades. Its all-time high occurred less than one week after the OP token from rival layer 2 rollup Optimism reached an all-time high.\n\nThe surge in both governance tokens stems from the market\u2019s expectations for Ethereum improvement proposal (EIP) 4844, said Steve Kim, CEO and co-founder of crypto research firm Four Pillars.\n\n\n\nThe \u201cmarket expects EIP-4844 to be the catalyst for rollup scalability,\u201d wrote Kim to Unchained on Telegram. \u201cETH people believe that 4844\u2026 can increase the TPS [transaction per second] of rollups and at the same time reduce the gas fee (because after 4844, rollups don\u2019t have to compete against ETH native apps to use ETH blockspace), so it is bullish for L2s in general.\u201d\n\nEthereum researcher Dankrad Feist and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin are two of the co-authors of EIP-4844. The EIP will employ proto-danksharding, a concept named after Feist that is designed to increase the total number of transactions Ethereum could process.\n\n\u201cDanksharding is the full realization of the rollup scaling,\u201d Ethereum Foundation posted on its blog. \u201cDanksharding will bring massive amounts of space on Ethereum for rollups to dump their compressed transaction data. This means Ethereum will be able to support hundreds of individual rollups with ease and make millions of transactions per second a reality.\u201d\n\nEthereum developers will implement EIP-4844 on Jan. 17, when Dencun, the next major Ethereum upgrade, will go live on testnet Goerli, Ethereum educator Anthony Sassal posted on X."

If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nDespite the current market surge since mid-October, Ethereum has recently been trading below the $2,500 resistance. Investors are now wondering what will boost the price of ETH above the $2,500 level.\n\nMeanwhile, InQubeta has emerged as the best crypto investment for retail investors. The price of the coin has increased by 150% to $0.01925, enticing average investors from all around the cryptoverse.\n\nCan Ethereum (ETH) Soar Past $2,500?\n\nEthereum (ETH) has been on an upward rise since October 12th and has stayed above $2,100 throughout December. Currently, Ethereum is facing a significant challenge at the $2,500 mark.\n\nDespite several attempts to surpass this mark, it has failed. However, this time around, there\u2019s a growing sense of optimism among investors that Ethereum will finally cross this resistance.\n\nThe main reason why investors are feeling positive again is due to the excitement surrounding the Ethereum ETF. There is a belief that the launch of an Ethereum ETF could lead to a rise in the price of Ether beyond $2,500.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a twist: the US SEC has decided to delay the decision on the Ethereum ETF until March 2024. Due to the delay, Ethereum\u2019s prospects remain unaffected\n\nAccording to @Mangyek0, the upward trend of Ethereum will likely continue, and based on positive indicators from the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator (AO), it is possible that Ethereum will surpass the $2,500 target.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is being sold at $2,300. The price of the token has risen by 100% in the last year. Many believe that Ethereum is one of the best coins to invest in, given that its current value is less than $2,500.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE) Captures Retail Investors\u2019 Interest\n\nInQubeta (QUBE) has made a name for itself as the world\u2019s first crypto crowdfunding platform dedicated to AI startups. The platform has made it much easier for AI startups to fund and connect with the public. Additionally, InQubeta is gaining popularity among retail investors who are looking for lucrative investment opportunities in the crypto market.\n\nMany people are buying into InQubeta because they believe in the project\u2019s future potential. It is currently in stage 6 with a token costing $0.01925, and the presale has accumulated more than $7.7 million.\n\nThis indicates a massive amount of interest from investors and traders. InQubeta is also creating an NFT marketplace for AI startups. Minting NFTs out of investment opportunities will allow AI startups to exhibit their potential to investors who can then buy them.\n\nThe inclusion of fractional NFTs enables more individuals to engage in AI startups with any amount they have. This makes it easy for them to invest according to their income. The QUBE ERC20 coin from InQubeta also gives other advantages like staking and governance. Holders can stake their QUBE tokens to avail the tokens from a 5% sell tax.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe postponement of an Ethereum ETF\u2019s approval has caused the crypto community to wonder what will push the altcoin past $2,500.\n\nMeanwhile, the increase in the attention of retail investors towards QUBE tokens indicates that they have faith in the project.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH)\u2019s recent surge in momentum encountered a significant obstacle upon reaching a pivotal resistance area. As a result, it captured the attention of analysts. Alongside it, the Litecoin (LTC) crypto has also gone upwards and could reach new heights. Yet, the most significant attention is given to Pullix (PLX), which has strolled through stage 4 of its presale after launching less than a month ago.\n\nEthereum (ETH) to Reach Over $4,000 in 2024\n\nEthereum (ETH) witnessed a robust uptrend that resulted in a weekly peak at $2,335. This underscores the prevailing influence of buyers in the market. The upward trajectory is further emphasized by the golden cross on the daily chart that signals an overall bullish sentiment for the Ethereum crypto.\n\nCrypto analyst Shayan Navabi conducted an analysis where a close inspection of the chart revealed that amid recent sideways movements, the price of the Ethereum altcoin found robust support in the critical range between $2,211 and $2,166 on the Fibonacci retracement indicator. It served the role as a barrier, preventing further downward attempts.According to the Ethereum price prediction, it can reach $4,056.67 in 2024.\n\nLitecoin (LTC) to Face $80 Resistance and Surge Above $130\n\nLitecoin (LTC) is another notable altcoin that made major waves this year. The value of Litecoin was at an uptrend structure and revealed a possible sign of recovery as it neared the $80 price level.\n\nLitecoin is set for a colossal surge as it is gearing up to crack this critical resistance level and rocket towards new peaks from the support zone. During the past week, LTC witnessed an upswing from $69.24 to $77.16. According to the Litecoin price prediction, it can surge as high as $134.42 by the end of 2024.\n\nPullix (PLX) to Feature a DeFi and NFT Launchpad\n\nPullix (PLX) is growing in popularity as it will introduce elements to the TradFi space that can solve key issues. For example, most DEXs have faced liquidity issues, which have resulted in a lack of mainstream adoption. However, Pullix will resolve these issues by introducing a community-driven approach.\n\nBy utilizing the platform, users are able to participate in yield farming, staking, and even liquidity provision. Other features include futures, CFDs, and a value for secure storage of cryptocurrencies. Anyone can also access a lending protocol and get passive income while also accessing a DeFi and NFT launchpad.\n\nPLX is the native crypto in its blockchain ICO phase that has massive utility, as it\u2019s used as a revenue-sharing mechanism. This means that users can profit from the daily revenue of the exchange and earn a fixed passive income. This is done through providing liquidity to automated market makers, and as a result, it\u2019s seen as one of the best cryptos to buy.\n\nSummary\n\nAside from Ethereum and Litecoin, another crypto that can see an upswing in its value is Pullix. So far, the blockchain ICO has reached Stage 5, where a single PLX crypto trades at $0.07. At launch, analysts project a price upswing of 100x, making it one of the best cryptos to buy for 2024 and beyond.\n\nFor more information regarding Pullix\u2019s presale see links below:\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Leads Ethereum into a New Era with 2024 Roadmap - Global Crypto",
        "content": "Reading Time: 2 minutes\n\nIn a pivotal announcement for the blockchain community, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently shared the Ethereum roadmap for 2024, underscoring both its continuity and minor adjustments from the previous year\u2019s plans. This strategic outline, revealed through a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter), focuses on six key elements: the Merge, the Surge, the Scourge, the Verge, the Purge, and the Splurge. Each of these components represents a crucial step in Ethereum\u2019s evolving journey.\n\nAt the heart of the roadmap is the Merge, a fundamental change already implemented in September 2022, transitioning Ethereum from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This shift has significantly reduced the network\u2019s overall energy consumption, marking a milestone in Ethereum\u2019s commitment to sustainability.\n\nFurther developments in the roadmap include enhancements to Ethereum\u2019s single-slot finality (SSF). SSF is becoming increasingly central to Ethereum\u2019s PoS design, offering a straightforward solution to many current challenges in the network\u2019s architecture. Buterin emphasized the growing importance of SSF, stating, \u201cThe role of single slot finality (SSF) in post-Merge PoS improvement is solidifying. It\u2019s becoming clear that SSF is the easiest path to resolving a lot of the Ethereum PoS design\u2019s current weaknesses.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Buterin expressed a desire to revive the original ethos of the \u201ccypherpunk\u201d revolution within the blockchain space. Cypherpunks advocate for the use of encryption and technology to protect privacy, especially against government surveillance. Ethereum, initially conceived as a \u201cpublic decentralized shared hard drive\u201d facilitating peer-to-peer messaging and decentralized file storage, had seen this vision wane with the platform\u2019s increasing financialization since 2017. In response, Buterin highlighted the growing prominence of rollups, zero-knowledge proofs, account abstraction, and second-generation privacy solutions, which align with the principles of cypherpunk values.\n\nThese developments not only signify Ethereum\u2019s commitment to technological innovation but also its dedication to upholding the foundational principles of blockchain technology: decentralization, security, and privacy."

        "content": "Crypto Price Prediction: The crypto market entered 2024 with strong bullish momentum, with a majority of major coins witnessed aggressive buying. The uptick is likely fueled by growing optimism for the potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), anticipated around January 10, 2024\n\nThe Top two leading coins Bitcoin and Ethereum showcased an 8% and 6% jump in the last 48 hours to currently trade at $45616 and $2398 respectively\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market capitalization now stands at $1.76 trillion, marking a notable rise of 6.45% in the past day. Meanwhile, the total volume of cryptocurrency traded in the last 24 hours has surged to $65.2 billion, reflecting a significant 39.61% increase. As for Bitcoin, it currently asserts 50.87% dominance in the market, a slight uptick of 0.52% from the previous day.\n\nIn today\u2019s crypto price prediction, we\u2019ll analyze the near future projection of smart contract giant Ethereum(ETH), and the highest intraday gainer Near Protocol(NEAR), and SEI.\n\nEthereum Price Sees 10% Jump With This Resistance Breakout\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency has been on a steady upward trend for over 10 weeks, clearly identifiable by an ascending support trendline. Starting from a mid-October low of $1522, ETH\u2019s price has surged to a current level of $2400, marking a significant 57.5% growth.\n\nThis rally has been characterized by several pullbacks, each met with robust demand at the rising trendline, a positive indicator of a well-established uptrend. This trend suggests that the Ethereum price rally is likely to persist as long as the support trendline remains unbroken.\n\nToday, the ETH price has seen an intraday increase of 2%, hinting at a potential bullish breakout from the last swing high resistance of $2400. If the price can surpass this barrier with a solid daily close above it, there\u2019s room for an additional 10.8% increase, potentially reaching the next key resistance level of $2650.\n\nAdditionally, the 50-day EMA offers dynamic support, further bolstering the ongoing recovery\n\nConstructive Pullback Sets Near Protocol(NEAR) Price Rally to $7\n\nThe Near Protocol (NEAR) coin recently experienced a slight downturn, dropping 23.36% from its yearly high of $4.62. However, it found reliable support at $3.50, just above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level.\n\nThis correction was short-lived, as buyers quickly pushed the price back up, surpassing the $4 mark with a 9.4% intraday gain. Currently, the positive sentiment and healthy retracement have managed to recuperate the exhausted bullish momentum of this asset,\n\nThe Near Protocol price is now trading at $4.16, aiming to surpass its previous swing high of $4.1628. The daily chart reveals a bullish reversal pattern known as a rounding bottom, indicative of sustained investor accumulation.\n\nThis pattern suggests NEAR could aim for targets of $5.25, followed by $6.1 and $7.35. Despite the recent correction, the upward trend of the Bollinger band\u2019s upper boundary signals that bullish momentum remains strong.\n\nSEI Coin Price Eyeing the $1 Milestone with Accelerated Growth\n\nUnder the influence of a rising channel pattern, the SEI Coin price has also shown a significant recovery since mid-December. The price surged from a low of $0.223 to $0.75, a 236% increase.\n\nRecently, the SEI price broke through the upper boundary of its channel pattern, signaling an eagerness among buyers for a more robust recovery. If the coin maintains its position above this newfound resistance level, the upward trend could extend by another 20%, targeting the $0.9 mark and potentially reaching the psychological threshold of $1.\n\nThe widening gap between the MACD and its signal line, currently in a bullish crossover state, indicates a strengthening buyer control over the asset.\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "title": "Signs Pointing to an Ethereum (ETH) Correction Below $2K; Decentraland (MANA) and Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) Ready ... - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nIn the ever-fluctuating world of cryptocurrencies, market trends can shift rapidly. Recently, Ethereum showed signs of a potential correction below the crucial $2K mark. However, as Ethereum contemplates its next move, Decentraland and Rebel Satoshi seem poised for an upward surge. Let\u2019s delve deeper into these developments.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Uncertain Waters\n\nEthereum, one of the top crypto coins globally, recently faced turbulence as its price slipped below the pivotal $2,000 level. This dip followed a robust rally, raising questions about the cryptocurrency\u2019s immediate trajectory. Market observers keenly await its next move, with many pointing to a potential correction phase.\n\nOn closer inspection, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) signalled an overbought condition, hinting at the looming correction. However, the current scenario also showcases a bullish flag formation. Such patterns typically suggest a market correction rather than a full-fledged bearish trend. If Ethereum manages to break above this flag, it could indicate a renewed bullish momentum.\n\nDecentraland\u2019s Meteoric Rise\n\nWhile Ethereum grapples with its next steps, Decentraland (MANA) emerges as a beacon of hope for investors. Often regarded as one of the top altcoins, MANA has witnessed a staggering 47% surge in recent weeks. Lately, it outperformed all other top 100 cryptocurrencies, marking an impressive 12% gain.\n\nWhile the exact catalyst behind MANA\u2019s surge remains elusive, the broader resurgence of the cryptocurrency market plays a significant role. With the gaming and metaverse sectors gaining traction, Decentraland stands at the forefront, showcasing its potential as a top crypto to buy.\n\nRebel Satoshi\u2019s Rising Potential\n\nAnother notable mention in the crypto realm is Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ). With Citizens Round 3 that has already garnered over 82 Million $RBLZ and raised $1,000,000, Rebel Satoshi is making waves. The milestone of exceeding a sale value of $1 million further cements its position in the crypto sphere.\n\nBuilt on the Ethereum network, Rebel Satoshi leverages one of the most secure blockchains available. For crypto beginners and seasoned investors alike, the security and potential of Ethereum-based projects make $RBLZ an enticing prospect. Furthermore, with its smart contracts audited by the reputable Source Hat, investors can find assurance in its reliability.\n\nFor those pondering which crypto to buy today for long-term gains, Rebel Satoshi offers compelling reasons. Its foundation on Ethereum ensures robust security, while its rising popularity signifies growing market trust. As discussions about the best cryptocurrency to invest in gain momentum, $RBLZ\u2019s performance and potential cannot be overlooked.\n\nConclusion and Investment Call\n\nWhile Ethereum navigates its corrective phase and Decentraland basks in its recent gains, Rebel Satoshi emerges as a promising contender in the crypto arena. With its presale success and strong foundation, $RBLZ offers a unique investment opportunity. As always, potential investors should conduct their research, but with the current momentum and backing, Rebel Satoshi presents a compelling case as a top crypto to buy.\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram"

        "title": "The Race to the Biggest Blockchain by TVL in 2023: Who Won? (Excl. Ethereum) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "TL;DR\n\nShifts in Blockchain TVL: The year 2023 saw changes in the total value locked (TVL) rankings among various blockchain platforms, with significant fluctuations and new entries making an impact.\n\nHighlights in Blockchain Performance: Certain networks gained popularity and development recognition, outperforming rivals in aspects like Google searches, NFT sales, and on-chain trading volume.\n\nCryptocurrency Value Fluctuations: There were notable increases in the prices of some cryptocurrencies, influenced by factors like TVL dynamics and market trends, though the direct correlation between TVL and price is not always clear.\n\nShifting Positions Throughout 2023\n\nAccording to Coin98 Analytics, the blockchain platform with the highest total value locked (TVL) as of the end of 2023 is Tron (over $8 billion). BNB Chain ($3.5 billion) and Arbitrum ($2.4 billion) rounded up the top 3 list, while Solana comes next with $1.4 billion. The analysis excludes Ethereum, whose figure reached almost $30 billion.\n\nHowever, the current standings have not always been the case. The three leading platforms retained their positions for the entire year, although BNB Chain was first at the beginning, whereas Tron came second.\n\nSolana was at the bottom in January 2023 with a TVL of $210 million. As the year passed, new blockchain networks emerged and shifted the landscape. One example is Coinbase\u2019s layer-2 solution \u2013 Base \u2013 which saw the light of day in August. Its TVL gradually increased throughout 2023, reaching almost $440 million by the end.\n\nFor its part, Blast \u2013 an upcoming L2 blockchain \u2013 made waves in the industry in the final quarter, positioning itself among the leaders and finishing the year in the fifth spot with a TVL of over $1 billion. The rising popularity of the network led to a phishing attack in November, following which a victim parted with more than $130,000. Blast\u2019s mainnet launch is scheduled for February this year.\n\nOptimism, Avalanche, Polygon, and Cardano are the remaining blockchains from the top 10. Cardano started the year with less than $50 million and crossed the finish line at above $400 million.\n\nAt the end of 2023, besides #Ethereum, here are the top 10 blockchains with the highest TVL: Tron\n\nBNB Chain\n\nArbitrum\n\nSolana\n\nBlast\n\nOptimism\n\nAvalanche\n\nPolygon\n\nBase\n\nCardano pic.twitter.com/jvgGvJCwKN \u2014 Coin98 Analytics (@Coin98Analytics) December 31, 2023\n\nSome cryptocurrencies, including Solana\u2019s SOL and Cardano\u2019s ADA, have charted notable price increases last year. The former surged from less than $10 to almost $125 by Christmas, whereas the latter experienced a 150% surge to above $0.60.\n\nWhile the rising TVL could be a factor for those spikes, the relationship is not always directly proportional. Total value locked refers to the entire amount of crypto assets deposited in a particular DeFi protocol and might be considered a sign of trust and stability in the relevant network.\n\nOn the other hand, rising TVL could be a result of a bull market. In this case, new funds do not enter the ecosystem, but the value of the locked assets heads north as prices do so too.\n\nSolana and Cardano in the Spotlight\n\nThose two networks have been particularly intriguing to industry participants lately due to their achievements toward the year\u2019s end. Solana surpassed Ethereum regarding Google searches in mid-December, becoming more popular in countries like Spain and the Philippines.\n\nIt outpaced its rival on the non-fungible token field, too. Its NFT sales volume exploded to $75 million on a weekly basis last month versus $72 for Ethereum. Additionally, Solana\u2019s on-chain trading volume peaked above $2.6 billion on December 22, while Ethereum recorded $1.6 billion on that day.\n\nFor its part, Cardano was highlighted as the top network by development activity in the last 30 days. This happened at the end of December, with Polkadot, Kusama, and Avalanche next in line."

        "content": "TRB marked a 52-week high but was later subject to a massive dump.\n\nOpen Interest increased as traders side with short positions.\n\nMarket participants who tried to capitalize on the rise in Tellor\u2019s [TRB] price were met with a big shock as 2023 closed.\n\nOn the 31st of December, the price of TRB increased and tapped $600. In the process of the rally, some traders wanted to have a piece of the cake.\n\nHowever, TRB\u2019s price crashed moments later. This dump caused a $73 million liquidation. Coinglass showed the wipeout was the highest of any crypto contract in the last 24 hours.\n\nHold the Tellor team responsible\n\nAt press time, TRB\u2019s price was $198.35, indicating that the token was tilting toward the upside again. The Tellor project is not as popular as other coins in the market. As of this writing, it was number 124 on the market cap standings.\n\nPer its fundamentals, AMBCrypto discovered that it was built on the Ethereum [ETH] blockchain. It also serves as an infrastructure for making off-chain data available on smart contracts.\n\nHowever, it seems that the Tellor team was not just interested in the utility of the project.\n\nThis was because of a recent revelation by Lookonchain. According to Lookonchain, the pump and dump of the token could be a case of manipulation by the Tellor team.\n\nThe smart money handle posted that the team deposited $2.4 million of TRB shortly after the price started to rise.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, $TRB soared to $600 and then plummeted to $137, causing $68M of assets to be liquidated, making it the most liquidated token. We noticed that the #Tellor team deposited 4,211 $TRB($2.4M) after the price of $TRB skyrocketed. Address:https://t.co/efHPXCiMiG pic.twitter.com/IBty2Wf2gI \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 1, 2024\n\nSo, it is likely that the team was also involved in dumping the tokens and putting retail traders in pain.\n\nShorts plan to thrive but\u2026\n\nFurthermore, the Open Interest in TRB had increased to $423.24 million. Open Interest is the value of outstanding derivative contracts in futures trading.\n\nIncreasing Open Interest (OI) implies that new money has flowed into the market. On the other hand, a decreasing OI implies that traders are closing positions and taking out their liquidity.\n\nSo, the spike in the 8-hour Open Interest suggests that there were some traders with open TRB contracts.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the TRB Profit Calculator\n\nBut what positions are these traders taking? This is where the OI-Weighted Funding Rate comes in. Funding Rate gives an insight into the sentiment traders have. If the Funding Rate is positive, traders are bullish and have many long positions open.\n\nHowever, TRB\u2019s Funding Rate at press was down to -1.937%. This reading indicated that short positions were dominant in the market at press time. But with the price in a recovery phase, it might not be a good idea to short TRB in the meantime."

Since the end of the 2021 bull run, ADA has been experiencing a bearish trend. However, closing the fourth quarter of 2023, it has shown a bullish outlook, registering an impressive gain of over 170%.\n\nThe renewed interest in ADA\u2019s value can be mainly credited to growing liquidity and increased trading on both centralized and decentralized financial (DeFi) platforms. Notably, the open interest in ADA has risen sharply, moving from under $100 million in October to over $300 million recently.\n\nNow, what next? Read on to discover more about your favourite cryptocurrency!\n\nAmbitions Run High\n\nCardano\u2019s goal to challenge Ethereum\u2019s leading position in the DeFi sector is gaining momentum. By emphasizing the broader adoption of smart contracts, Cardano has secured a Total Value Locked (TVL) of approximately $424 million. Although this is a significant achievement, it still trails behind Ethereum\u2019s impressive $29.9 billion.\n\nThe rising popularity of Cardano\u2019s DeFi protocols and meme coins, especially Snek (SNEK), has sparked discussions within the crypto community.\n\nAlso Read: Which Altcoin Will Hit $1 in January 2024: Cardano (ADA) or Ripple (XRP)?\n\nADA\u2019s Potential Growth and Technical Analysis\n\nLooking at ADA\u2019s short-term price trends, technical experts are optimistic. The daily chart shows an ascending triangle pattern, indicating potential bullish movement. Captain Faibik, a respected crypto analyst on the X platform, suggests that if ADA can close above this pattern\u2019s upper boundary, it might aim for the 80-cent level.\n\nFurther supporting this positive view is ADA\u2019s weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI), which has surpassed the key level of 70 for the first time since 2021. Additionally, analyzing ADA\u2019s weekly chart using the Elliott wave theory suggests that the cryptocurrency is setting up for a third bullish phase, possibly similar to Bitcoin\u2019s past performance. Considering these technical insights and the evolving market conditions, ADA\u2019s future looks promising for many in the crypto space.\n\nAlso Read: Top Cryptocurrency Picks for January 2024\n\nCardano\u2019s on fire, but can it dethrone Ethereum?

        "content": "The Dawn of a New Era in NFTs: Exploring the Rise of Alternative Layer 1s\n\nAs we venture into 2024, the NFT landscape is undergoing a seismic shift, with alternative Layer 1 blockchains like Solana (SOL), Tezos, and SEI emerging as significant players. This shift marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of the NFT ecosystem, diversifying the platforms on which digital art and collectibles thrive.\n\n1. Diversification Beyond Ethereum: A Breath of Fresh Air for NFTs\n\nHistorically, Ethereum has been the dominant force in the NFT space. However, alternative Layer 1s like SOL, Tezos, and SEI offer fresh opportunities. Their unique features, such as lower transaction fees and faster processing times, make them attractive to artists and collectors seeking new avenues for NFT creation and trade.\n\n2. Niche Communities and Innovative Use-Cases\n\nThese alternative blockchains are carving out niche communities and fostering innovative use-cases. For instance, Tezos has become a hub for eco-conscious artists due to its energy-efficient design, while SEI\u2019s high throughput is appealing for high-frequency trading NFTs.\n\n3. Enhanced Scalability and Performance\n\nScalability remains a key concern in the NFT space. Alternative Layer 1s address this issue head-on, offering superior scalability and performance compared to older blockchains. This feature is crucial as the NFT market expands and requires more efficient infrastructure.\n\n4. Tailored Solutions for Diverse Needs\n\nEach of these alternative Layer 1s brings tailored solutions to the table. Solana, known for its lightning-fast speeds, is ideal for projects that require quick transactions. Tezos, on the other hand, appeals to those prioritizing eco-friendliness.\n\n5. Growing Ecosystems and Partnerships\n\nThe expanding ecosystems and partnerships surrounding these blockchains are a testament to their growing influence. Collaborations with artists, brands, and tech companies are broadening the scope and appeal of NFTs on these platforms.\n\nBTC\u2019s Entry into NFTs: Ordinals and Inscriptions\n\n2024 also witnesses a groundbreaking development in the NFT space with Bitcoin (BTC) introducing ordinals and inscriptions. This new concept involves directly inscribing digital assets onto individual satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin, adding a fresh dimension to the NFT market.\n\nThe Significance of Bitcoin\u2019s Ordinals\n\nBitcoin\u2019s foray into the NFT world is notable for several reasons. Firstly, it leverages the robust security and widespread recognition of the Bitcoin network. Secondly, ordinals introduce a unique way of tokenizing assets, differing from traditional NFT standards. This innovation could attract a new wave of collectors and creators, eager to explore the possibilities within the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nImplications for the NFT Landscape\n\nThe introduction of Bitcoin ordinals and inscriptions is poised to enrich the NFT landscape. It not only expands the range of blockchain options for NFTs but also brings the credibility and stability of Bitcoin to the forefront of digital art and collectibles.\n\nThe Unstoppable Rise of Layer 2s: Ethereum\u2019s Counter\n\nWhile alternative Layer 1s and Bitcoin\u2019s new venture are making waves, Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 solutions, particularly Arbitrum, are not to be overlooked, especially in the gaming sector. Arbitrum is poised to extend its lead in 2024, offering a blend of Ethereum\u2019s security with enhanced scalability and lower fees, making it ideal for NFT-based games.\n\nConclusion: A Balanced NFT Future\n\n2024 promises to be a landmark year for NFTs, with both alternative Layer 1s, Bitcoin\u2019s innovative ordinals, and Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum playing critical roles. This balanced growth ensures a vibrant, diverse, and technologically advanced NFT ecosystem.\n\nTLDR: 2024 marks the rise of alternative Layer 1 blockchains like Solana, Tezos, and SEI in the NFT space, alongside Bitcoin\u2019s introduction of ordinals and inscriptions, offering diversification, niche communities, scalability, and tailored solutions. Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 solutions, especially Arbitrum, continue to be pivotal, particularly in NFT gaming. The year promises a balanced and thriving NFT ecosystem."

        "content": "In the world of cryptocurrencies, price predictions often spark excitement and speculation among investors. Ethereum (ETH), one of the most prominent players in the space, is frequently at the centre of these discussions.With varying predictions about its potential to double in value by 2024, there\u2019s a growing interest in how it compares to emerging platforms like Retik Finance (RETIK), which is poised to outperform even the most optimistic Ethereum forecasts.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Price Trajectory: An Analysis\n\nPotential for a Significant Rise: Cryptocurrency analyst Lark Davis predicts Ethereum could soar as high as $15,000 per coin during the 2024-2025 bull cycle. This optimistic outlook is grounded in Ethereum\u2019s ongoing developments and its established position in the market.\n\nA More Conservative Viewpoint: CoinCodex offers a more cautious estimate, predicting Ethereum might reach around $6,501.47 by 2024, with a potential increase of 204.15% by 2030.

This projection is based on Retik\u2019s unique value proposition in the DeFi space and its strategy to bridge the gap between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies.\n\nFactors Driving RETIK\u2019s Growth\n\nThe anticipated growth of Retik Finance is attributed to several key factors:\n\nMarket Need: Retik Finance addresses a significant market need by simplifying the use of cryptocurrencies in daily financial activities.

These factors contribute to Ethereum\u2019s potential to double its value.\n\nRetik Finance\u2019s Edge: In contrast, Retik Finance\u2019s edge comes from its focus on integrating DeFi into everyday life, making it more accessible to a broader audience.

        "content": "The TVL across all DeFi protocols hits $55.7 billion.\n\nMomentum in DeFi protocols has been trending high er since late Q4 2023.\n\nChanging DeFi market dynamics suggest users are shunning Ethereum.\n\nIn October 2023, DeFi markets hit a local bottom as the total value locked (TVL) fell below $37 billion. However, decentralized finance protocols began gaining momentum, with crypto sentiment improving towards the end of Q4 2023. This momentum has continued into the new year, with DeFi TVL reaching $55.7 billion on January 2, marking a 16-month high.\n\nDeFi TVL Trends Higher\n\nOn January 2, the TVL in DeFi protocols hit $55.7 billion for the first time since September 2022, indicating a continuation of strength from the late Q4 2023 surge going into the new year.\n\nLast year was characterized by indecision, with TVL trending higher from the start of 2023 to reach a local top of $52.8 billion by April 15, 2023. Since then, investors displayed caution, leading to outflows that dipped TVL to a yearly low of $35.9 billion by October 13, 2023.\n\nHowever, a wider crypto market recovery attributable largely to spot Bitcoin ETF approval hype saw capital flowing into the DeFi market to print a marked uptrend to close 2023 on a high.\n\nDeFi TVL in dollars per DeFiLlama\n\nWhile DeFi TVL sees a continuation of inflows into the new year, there is a noticeable change in DeFi dominance.\n\nThe Decline of Ethereum DeFi?\n\nEthereum has been the dominant DeFi blockchain since the inception of decentralized finance in mid-2020. While that remains the case, with Ethereum currently holding 53.7% of the TVL across all chains, its market dominance was as high as 60% in the summer of 2023.\n\nIn the meantime, several other blockchains have been gaining traction, suggesting a change in DeFi market dynamics, including Cardano, which entered the top 10 DeFi protocols recently, and Solana, which spiked to fifth place as meme coin mania driven by Solana-based Bonk took markets by storm.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nGrowing TVL mirrors a broader rebound in crypto markets, with the total cap growing 115% over the past year to $1.73 trillion .\n\nMainstream adoption of crypto and DeFi remains relatively low versus TradFi , indicating ample growth opportunities .\n\nThe TVL in Ethereum has shown an enduring downtrend since 2022 when priced in ETH (rather than dollars).\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe resurgence in DeFi TVL demonstrates a growing appetite for crypto-enabled financial tools despite recent scandals and ongoing concerns over asset security. While the road to mainstream adoption remains long, the milestone recapture of $55 billion inspires confidence that the industry is on the right path.\n\nLearn more about Ethereum DeFi exploits in 2023 here:\n\nEthereum Exploits Account for 70% of all DeFi Losses in 2023\n\n\n\nFind out why the Bitcoin price is pumping here:\n\nBitcoin Spot ETF Early Nod Rumors Blast Price Past $45k"

        "title": "2024-01-01 | Press Release | Donald Trump Selling Ethereum (ETH) Amidst Price Surge, PancakeSwap (CAKE ... - Stockhouse Publishing",
        "content": "(NewsDirect)\n\nRecently, there have been some exciting developments in the DeFi market, as Donald Trump reportedly sold some of his Ethereum (ETH) holdings while it surged. Meanwhile, PancakeSwap (CAKE) has revealed a proposal that could change its tokenomics to the core. And finally, Meme Moguls (MGLS) - the Stage Three presale star, has unveiled its new tier system. Let\u2019s see why so many experts believe MGLS is the next 100x altcoin in 2024.\n\nEthereum News\n\nThe on-chain analytics platform Arkham recently revealed that indications suggest Donald Trump might have been selling his Ethereum (ETH) holdings. They said Trump transferred 1,075 ETH, valued at $2.4M, to Coinbase.\n\nThis is a strange move as the Ethereum crypto has recently experienced growth from $2,261 on December 21 to $2,372 on December 28. Additionally, over 26 technical indicators are showing green for this altcoin.\n\nDue to all these reasons, market analysts project that Ethereum could trade at the $2,628 level in January 2024.\n\nPancakeSwap (CAKE): New Proposal\n\nPancakeSwap (CAKE) has announced a new proposal to slash its supply from 750M to 450M. With this development, the PancakeSwap exchange signals the transition from a high-inflation emissions model to the Ultrasound CAKE era.\n\nAfter this PancakeSwap news, its value jumped from $3.50 to $3.87 in just a few hours on December 28. This bullish trend may continue as PancakeSwap is now trading above its 50 and 100-day EMAs - good bullish signs.\n\nExperts in the crypto field foresee its value reaching $4.24 in January 2024. This makes CAKE one of the altcoins to watch.\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS) : Tier System Makes It One of the Top Altcoins\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS) has been making headlines recently, raising over $1M during Stage Three of its presale. To thank its community, Meme Moguls revealed its tier system. This tier system ranges from $500-1000 holdings (Bronze VIP) to $50,000+ holdings (Meme Whale). Each tier will have perks like monthly bonuses and the ability to speak to a team member.\n\nAt its core, Meme Moguls will introduce utility to the meme coin sector. It aims to accomplish this by creating a unique play-to-earn (P2E) game where its native token, MGLS, is used as governance and in-game currency. Holding this token is also crucial as it will allow you to make decisions about the future of Meme Moguls and staking rewards.\n\nIn the Meme Moguls game, you will learn all there is to know about investments and wealth-building. It also brings various features, including simulated investing and head-to-head battles. An in-game Marketplace will also be available, allowing you to buy, sell, or trade the items you collect.\n\nGlobal investors are flocking to this crypto ICO event as one MGLS token costs only $0.0025 - a 31% ROI for those who bought it early. Given that Statista predicts the meme industry will be valued at $6.1B by 2025 - this DeFi project\u2019s long-term growth potential is stellar. Experts predict it may surge to $0.19 in 2024, a 100x ROI if you buy it now. If interested, now is the perfect time to purchase it, as you will also obtain a 15% deposit bonus.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough all three of these altcoins are worth monitoring, one stands out - Meme Moguls. Thanks to its low market cap of $7.5M, MGLS will experience a faster price growth than Ethereum and PancakeSwap as they have market caps of $287B and $1B. In other words, they need a large influx of new funds for their prices to see noticeable growth. Thus, MGLS is one of the best cryptos to invest in.\n\nVisit Meme Moguls\n\nMeme Moguls and all cryptocurrencies are subject to significant price fluctuations and volatility. Investing in or holding Meme Moguls tokens carries substantial risks, including the potential for total loss. Past performance should not be considered indicative of future results.\n\nContact Details\n\nMeme Moguls\n\ncontact@mememoguls.com\n\nCompany Website\n\nhttps://mememoguls.com/\n\nCopyright (c) 2024 TheNewswire - All rights reserved."

        "title": "Is A Cryptocurrency Bull Market On The Horizon For 2024 - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nPeriods when cryptocurrency prices rise occur when investor confidence and market optimism are rising.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving in April 2024 is a catalyst that is likely to spark a bull market as the Bitcoin supply reward reduces by half, increasing its scarcity.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF will likely enhance market accessibility, potentially boosting Bitcoin\u2019s demand and value.\n\nFed policies, primarily interest rate cuts, could positively influence the cryptocurrency market 2024.\n\nThe year 2022 witnessed a 76% decline in the total cryptocurrency market, marking a memorable bear market in the crypto industry. Widespread pessimism surrounded the sector throughout the year, in contrast to 2023, a year marked by resilience and recovery of the crypto market. Bitcoin rebounded from a low of $16k to $43k, recording a 167% increase in its price valuation. Ethereum doubled in value from $1.2K to $2.3K in a similar move.\n\nBy the end of 2023, the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency industry grew from $760 billion to $1.6 trillion. With the current sentiment in the market being one of optimism and belief, as the crypto industry moves into the new year, a bull market is anticipated, taking crypto to new all-time highs in 2024.\n\nWhat Is A Crypto Bull Market?\n\nA crypto bull market is characterized by rising investor confidence and increasing cryptocurrency prices, often reflecting broader optimism in the crypto market.\n\nThe demand for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and various altcoins increases during such times. The demand for these coins increases as positive news, technological advancements, and favorable regulatory developments fuel demand.\n\nCatalysts For A 2024 Crypto Bull Market\n\nThe year 2024 marks the fifteenth year of Bitcoin\u2019s existence, and like any teenager going about life, this cryptocurrency is beginning to make its mark on the world as it continues to mature. Here are some bullish events that should increase demand for Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency:\n\n1.0 Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) Approval And Institutional Investment\n\nThe expected early 2024 approval of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) by significant firms such as BlackRock, Fidelity, VanEck, and others will likely lead to substantial inflows as the Q1 2024 deadline approval draws near.\n\nThe approval of these Bitcoin ETFs will likely enhance the Bitcoin narrative as a \u2018hard money\u2019 option by increasing public awareness of debt-driven money printing. The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs will make Bitcoin more accessible to institutional investors, as they will not need to self-custody it, facilitating more significant investment in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\n2.0 Bitcoin Fourth Halving In April 2024\n\nScheduled for April 2024, the fourth Bitcoin halving will reduce the new Bitcoin supply entering circulation from 6.25 to 3.125 Bitcoin every ten minutes. Historically, such a supply cut, mainly if demand stays constant or rises, has increased Bitcoin\u2019s price. This is primarily due to the scarcity effect, as the reduced availability of Bitcoin makes each Bitcoin more valuable.\n\nAdditionally, the halving event typically gets significant media attention and public awareness, attracting new investors and further boosting demand. In the past, this combination of decreased supply and heightened interest has set the stage for a substantial bull run in the months following the halving.\n\n3.0 Bitcoin Primed For A First Time Real \u2018Supply Shock\u2019 Post Halving\n\nThe supply of Bitcoin on exchanges has reached its lowest point in five years, with just 1.9 million Bitcoin available for trading as of December 2023, the smallest amount since March 2018.\n\nThis reduction in readily accessible Bitcoin, along with data from LookIntoBitcoin\u2019s 5+ HODL Wave chart, indicates that 32% of Bitcoin holders haven\u2019t moved coins in the last five years, which leads analysts to predict a supply shock in 2024. On top of the following information, Bitcoin will likely see an increase in demand due to the ETF approval and a further supply shock post-halving.\n\n4.0 93% Of Bitcoin Is Already In Circulation\n\nApproximately 93% of Bitcoin\u2019s total supply has already been mined and is currently in circulation, leaving only about 6-7% to be mined over 120 years.\n\nThis minimal amount remaining to be mined underscores Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity principle, a critical aspect of its value proposition, sharply contrasting with the unlimited printing potential of traditional fiat currencies.\n\nAs the years progress and the creation of new Bitcoin into the market slows, the scarcity principle will likely play a significant role in potentially increasing Bitcoin\u2019s value, particularly as demand escalates in a market with a limited supply.\n\n5.0 The FED Chairman Jerome Powell Cutting Interest Rates In 2024\n\nAnalysts expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates as early as March 2024, particularly if inflation continues its downward trend more quickly than expected. Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted at a potential shift in monetary policy. The reduction in interest rates is in response to the cooling of inflation rates, which aligns with the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\n\nSuch a move to cut rates a month before the anticipated Bitcoin halving would significantly influence the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It will drive cryptocurrencies upward as the market reacts to easier monetary conditions.\n\n6.0 Global Political Bodies Embracing Bitcoin\n\nSeveral presidential candidates worldwide are increasingly integrating Bitcoin into political platforms. In the U.S., Republican Vivek Ramaswamy is developing a detailed crypto policy framework and accepting Bitcoin donations for his campaign, reflecting his popularity within the party.\n\nIn Argentina, President Javier Milei, a proponent of libertarianism and the Austrian economy, publicly views Bitcoin as a strategic tool for potentially dismantling the Central Bank of Argentina. Javier\u2019s perspective aligns with the Argentine finance minister\u2019s recent announcement of a decree legalizing the use of specific currencies, including Bitcoin, for certain contracts and payments.\n\nPolitical figures like Canada\u2019s Pierre Poilievre, America\u2019s Robert F. Kennedy, and Panama\u2019s Gabriel Silva also include Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in policy initiatives. A notable example is President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, who actively made Bitcoin legal tender in 2021, showcasing the increasing political interest in political bodies embracing cryptocurrency.\n\nThis trend will likely continue into 2024, fueling Bitcoin adoption into mainstream acceptance.\n\n7.0 FASB Guidelines And Accounting Treatments Effective From 2025\n\nCoinbase is set to become the first publicly traded company to separately report layer 2 blockchain revenues, with its Base Protocol expected to exceed $100M in annualized revenues, significantly contributing to its business. This move may be influenced by adopting new FASB guidelines, which permit companies to record mark-to-market gains on cryptocurrencies, thereby enhancing a Bitcoin appeal as a corporate treasury asset.\n\nWith new accounting changes effective from 2025 but available for earlier adoption, a significant financial entity outside the crypto sector, like a bank or exchange, might announce the launch of a semi-public blockchain, similar to a layer 2 network, that could potentially connect to public blockchains through authorized participants.\n\n8.0 Altcoins And Ethereum Protocol Enhancement\n\nEthereum\u2019s upcoming EIP-4844 update is set to significantly improve the Ethereum protocol, reducing transaction fees and enhancing scalability for layer 2 networks like Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism. Ethereum\u2019s upgrade will likely lead to a consolidation in the Ethereum L2 sector, with a few key players emerging dominant.\n\nThe result will be increased trading opportunities and higher transaction volumes on decentralized exchanges, boosting Ethereum\u2019s market presence and setting it up for broader success in the anticipated bull market by the end of 2024.\n\nHistorically, during bull markets where Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin, this pattern has also emerged with other altcoins that will see significant growth in asset valuation.\n\n9.0 Protocol Enhancements In Smart Contracts And NFTs\n\nNFT activity is expected to surge, reaching new monthly volumes as speculators re-enter the crypto market. The focus will be on prominent NFT collections on Ethereum, enhanced crypto gaming experiences, and innovative Bitcoin-based offerings.\n\nAlthough Ethereum has historically dominated NFT sales with a significant lead over Bitcoin, the introduction of Bitcoin\u2019s Ordinals protocol and the development of layer 2 chains on the Bitcoin network are set to continue to innovate the crypto ecosystem, likely bringing in new participants and capital.\n\n10.0 Decentralized Exchanges Market Share Set To Increase In 2024\n\nThe market share of decentralized exchanges (DEX) in spot crypto trading is expected to increase to new all-time highs, propelled by high-throughput chains such as Solana that enhance the on-chain trading experience.\n\nSimultaneously, significant advancements in wallet technology, particularly with the integration of \u201caccount abstraction\u201d for facilitating automated payments, are expected to drive more users toward on-chain platforms and self-custody options.\n\n11.0 Technical Analysis Indicates Strong Momentum For A Bull Market\n\nBetween 2009 and 2021, Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry saw three all-time highs. On average, it has taken roughly 1470 days between each high to progress from one peak to the next.\n\nAnalyzing historical chart patterns depicted in the Bitcoin chart below, if Bitcoin continues to follow the cyclical nature it has been on since 2009, a top might emerge around August-October 2025.\n\nTechnical analysis suggests that for Bitcoin to achieve its next high, 2024 needs to be a strong year. At some point in 2024, Bitcoin is expected to at least revisit its previous all-time high of $69K.\n\nAfter surpassing this threshold, it would likely spend around six months to one year in price discovery mode, indicating that Bitcoin could see a notable price increase throughout 2024 and into 2025.\n\nFrom the technical chart presented above, a notable observation is the consistency of the cycles, with the time between peaks being relatively stable.\n\nAnother key takeaway is the progressive increase in peak values, indicating a long-term upward trend despite inherent volatility in the asset.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs 2024 approaches, the cryptocurrency market is primed for a potential bull market driven by pivotal events in 2024. The primary catalysts include:\n\nThe anticipated supply shock from Bitcoin\u2019s fourth halving in April 2024.\n\nThe potential early 2024 approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe Federal Reserve plans to maintain ample liquidity while potentially reducing interest rates.\n\nChanges in FASB accounting standards are expected to encourage companies to include Bitcoin on company balance sheets as a treasury asset.\n\nThese developments will likely significantly alter market dynamics, setting the stage for a robust bull market in the crypto sector. Therefore, 2024 stands as a defining year for cryptocurrencies, with these events poised to profoundly impact the market\u2019s direction.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is a crypto bull market?\n\nA crypto bull market occurs when increasing investor confidence and positive developments push cryptocurrency prices upward, reflecting a general market optimism.\n\nCan the 2024 Bitcoin halving trigger a bull market?\n\nThe 2024 Bitcoin halving will reduce the new supply of Bitcoin in circulation, which will likely spur a bull market if demand remains steady or increases due to its scarcity effect.\n\nWill the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF affect the crypto market?\n\nApproval of a spot Bitcoin ETF could boost crypto demand by making Bitcoin more accessible to institutional investors and raising public awareness.\n\nWhat impact will Federal Reserve policies have on crypto in 2024?\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s potential interest rate cuts and liquidity maintenance in 2024 could create favorable conditions for a cryptocurrency bull market."

Despite the impressive performance of Solana (SOL) in the market, Hayes opted to sell his SOL holdings and allocate more resources towards Ethereum (ETH). In a post on X, Hayes expressed his inspiration to support Vitalik Buterin's Ethereum, particularly in light of the rising prices of SOL.\n\nHayes didn't just stop at the switch; he also made a bold prediction, foreseeing the Ethereum price reaching $5,000. During the first and second quarters of 2023, Bitcoin (BTC) experienced significant institutional interest, thanks to the rise of spot ETC applications. In contrast, Ethereum struggled with slower numbers, extending into Q3 despite the buzz surrounding the futures ETF.\n\nStill, Ethereum's recent performance may align with Hayes' positive view. In early December 2023, Ethereum's price surged, crossing $2,100 in value.\n\nChainlink Staking v0.2 Sees Over 11 Million Tokens Staked\n\nChainlink (LINK), the top decentralized oracle network, just rolled out a significant upgrade to its staking protocol, known as Staking v0.2. The launch sparked a surge of activity, with over 11 million Chainlink tokens staked within just 30 minutes of going live.\n\nThis buzz around Staking v0.2 reflects a robust belief in Chainlink's prospective growth.\n\nChainlink's price has been trailing behind market leaders like Bitcoin and Solana. With a modest 7.95% increase in the last 30 days, it falls short compared to the broader market trends.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) is Predicted to 10X on Launch\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) is an emerging player in the DeFi market, aiming to revolutionize real estate ownership by turning properties such as vacational homes and hotels into fractional NFTs. This distinctive approach allows investors to acquire these properties at a reduced cost, with the value of the NFTs directly linked to the underlying properties.\n\nHere's what the process looks like in theory: The platform tokenizes vacation properties into fractional NFT items, making property acquisition affordable for all investors regardless of financial status. Plus, you can use these NFTs as collateral for loans as well as stake the proceeds in the ecosystem\u2019s liquidity pool.\n\nCurrently, in the eighth stage of its presale, the platform's native cryptocurrency, ELDG, is priced at 0.027. Analysts have also predicted Everlodge to be among the best cryptocurrency investments to watch out for ahead of 2024 considering its potential to reach 10X on launch.\n\nLooking ahead, Ethereum, Chainlink and Everlodge have established significant potential for high yields and are noteworthy options to consider when seeking the best crypto investments to add to your portfolio.\n\nFor more context, Ethereum's enduring relevance within the crypto community enhances its value and attractiveness, while Chainlink's innovative solutions hold the potential to drive its prices to new heights. Additionally, Everlodge's practical utility establishes a robust foundation of financial security for your investment.\n\nVisit Everlodge\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Unpacking altcoin predictions for 2024, focusing on Ethereum\u2019s advancements, Solana\u2019s market position, and the trajectories of promising altcoins.\n\nAs 2023 has come to a close, let\u2019s delve into the altcoins forecast and find out what might be next for these digital currencies.\n\nThroughout 2023, a few top altcoins stood out due to their impressive performance and notable advancements.\n\nInjective Protocol (INJ) leads the pack, showcasing a growth of over 3000% over the past year. This surge can be attributed to several factors, including its mainnet upgrade, which introduced new features like message signing, advanced balance indexing, and upgraded WASM smart contracts.\n\nFollowing closely is Immutable (IMX), which experienced over 490% surge. Immutable stood out for its approach to decentralized trading, aiming to offer a fully decentralized and trustless on-chain order book-based DEX development infrastructure.\n\nMeanwhile, THORchain (RUNE), another rising altcoin, saw its value increase over 340% last year despite difficult market conditions, reflecting the growing ecosystem of the Cosmos-based blockchain protocols.\n\nWhile the past performance of best-performing altcoins like INJ and IMX offers insights, the focus shifts to what the future holds, especially for the most promising altcoins for 2024.\n\nLet\u2019s dive deeper and uncover the potential trends that could shape the altcoin price prediction in the upcoming year.\n\nEthereum L2s could gain the momentum\n\nIn 2024, the altcoin market, especially Ethereum (ETH) and its layer 2 (L2s) networks, is brimming with potential.\n\nEthereum\u2019s upcoming upgrade, EIP-4844 (proto-danksharding), could significantly reduce transaction fees and enhance scalability. This is crucial for L2 chains like Polygon (MATIC), Arbitrum (ARB), and Optimism (OP).\n\nVanEck predicts that this upgrade could usher in a more efficient altcoin market. Particularly, it\u2019s anticipated that within a year, Ethereum\u2019s L2 networks will consolidate to 2-3 dominant players. These platforms could be major contributors to the altcoin forecast for 2024.\n\nVanEck even suggests that one of the best altcoins for 2024 could be the layer 2 network that surpasses Ethereum in monthly DEX volume and total value locked (TVL).\n\nThis increase in efficiency is likely to attract more trading volume and arbitrage opportunities, making these L2 networks some of the most promising altcoins for 2024.\n\nSolana could make strides in 2024\n\nAccording to VanEck analysts, Solana (SOL) is expected to emerge as a top-three blockchain in terms of market cap, TVL, and active users. This rise is attributed to Solana\u2019s clear scalability roadmap, which may give it an edge over competitors like Ethereum.\n\nSolana\u2019s defi ecosystem, already among the top five in TVL, has witnessed an impressive surge to around $1.5 billion as of January 2024 from $300 million levels in October.\n\nThis growth is spread across a vast number of wallet addresses and protocols, indicating a strong and active network.\n\nMoreover, VanEck analysts also predict that along with Bitcoin ETFs, several asset managers could file for Solana-based spot ETFs. This move could enhance Solana\u2019s visibility and attract further investment.\n\nMeanwhile, Solana\u2019s expected growth in TVL through Pyth, a Solana-based price oracle, could help Solana gain a substantial market share.\n\nThese developments suggest that Solana could be one of the most promising altcoins for 2024. Its potential growth in market cap, TVL, and user base, along with its probable venture into ETFs could redefine altcoin future predictions, especially in the DeFi sector.\n\nMost promising altcoins for 2024\n\nRipple (XRP)\n\nRipple\u2019s (XRP) ongoing lawsuit with the SEC remains a crucial factor for its future. As of January, Ripple had secured some partial victories in court, with a key ruling stating that past XRP sales were not investment contract offers.\n\nThis has provided Ripple with a temporary advantage in the case. The lawsuit is expected to be resolved in spring 2024, and a favorable outcome for Ripple could positively influence XRP\u2019s market value.\n\nThe anticipation of this resolution has been contributing to fluctuations in XRP\u2019s price, with notable buying activity from large-scale investors hinting that it could positively impact altcoin\u2019s price prediction.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX)\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) has been making strides as a decentralized platform for building and launching custom blockchain applications.\n\nIts consensus mechanism aims to enable rapid transaction finality and low transaction fees, making it an attractive platform for developers.\n\nThe growth of the defi market in 2024 could benefit AVAX, especially as it offers a scalable and user-friendly platform alternative to more established blockchains like Ethereum\u200b\u200b, making it one of the most promising altcoins.\n\nLido DAO (LIDO)\n\nLido DAO (LIDO) has gained significant attention due to its role in liquid staking, particularly on the Ethereum network. It has become a major contributor to Ethereum\u2019s TVL, highlighting its growing importance in the DeFi space.\n\nThe success and innovations in liquid staking and its impact on Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem put LIDO in the race to become one of the best altcoins for 2024.\n\nPolkadot (DOT)\n\nPolkadot\u2019s (DOT) parachain feature has been a key factor in its growth. This feature allows multiple blockchains to connect and interact within the Polkadot network while maintaining their independent operations.\n\nThe potential for interoperability and the facilitation of cross-chain communication could make DOT one of the best-performing altcoins for 2024\u200b.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nThe altcoin forecast for 2024 appears both promising and challenging. Investors eyeing the best altcoins for 2024 should remain vigilant, considering the volatile nature of the crypto market.\n\nFor those seeking the most promising altcoins for 2024, it\u2019s essential to look beyond just the hype and deeply analyze the technological advancements, market trends, and regulatory shifts that could impact these digital assets.\n\nYou must exercise caution as the crypto market is notoriously fast-paced. While the potential for high returns is significant, so is the risk of loss.\n\nHappy investing, and don\u2019t forget the golden rule: never invest more than you can afford to lose.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat are the best altcoins to buy in 2024? Looking towards 2024, some of the best altcoins to consider for investment include the ones that match your risk appetite and investment goals. You should conduct thorough research and stay updated with the latest market trends when considering these most promising altcoins for 2024. Are altcoins a good investment? Altcoins can be a good investment, but they also come with a high level of risk due to the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Due diligence, ongoing market research, and a careful altcoin forecast approach are key to making informed decisions in this space. Which altcoins can explode in 2024? Predicting which altcoins will explode in 2024 involves speculation, but based on current trends and developments, altcoins like Ethereum, Ripple, Avalanche, Lido DAO, and Polkadot show considerable promise. However, the crypto market is highly unpredictable, and investors should keep an eye on market trends to identify the best altcoins for 2024.\n\nDisclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

        "title": "Renowned Crypto Analyst Predicts The Top 5 Altcoins For 2024 - TradingView",
        "content": "In a recent YouTube video, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, a highly respected figure in the crypto analysis sphere, disclosed his top 5 altcoin picks for 2024. Van de Poppe, known as founder of Eight Global, emphasized the importance of a balanced approach over speculative bets on lesser-known altcoins. He stated, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in getting into very small altcoins to maximize the risk. Compounding your returns with a proper strategy benefits in the long run.\u201d\n\nEthereum (ETH) \u2013 The Primary Crypto Choice\n\nVan de Poppe\u2019s foremost recommendation is Ethereum. The crypto analyst rationalizes this choice by pointing out the crowded space Bitcoin currently occupies, suggesting a shift of focus to altcoins. He articulated, \u201cBitcoin has been seeing a lot of upside already [caused by the spot ETF hype] \u2026 it\u2019s getting a little bit overcrowded and I think the upside is relatively capped.\u201d\n\nHe added that Ethereum is currently bottoming out against Bitcoin. \u201cI think that Ethereum is undervalued at this point because there is a deflationary system involved.\u201d His belief in Ethereum stems from its fundamental growth and the deflationary aspect of its economic model.\n\nWith regards to the 3-day ETH/USDT chart, he commented: \u201cEthereum holds a crucial level at $2,150 and is ready to continue the upwards path. Likely, we\u2019ve bottomed on the ETH/BTC pair and have peaked on the Bitcoin dominance.\u201d\n\nNewsBTC\n\nScalability Solutions \u2013 Arbitrum and Optimism\n\nDelving deeper into the Ethereum ecosystem, van de Poppe highlighted the importance of scalability solutions. He sees Arbitrum as an attractive crypto investment, especially given its current stage and potential for growth.\n\n\u201cArbitrum has not much price action yet, which is tricky, but can give you a very interesting investment thesis,\u201d he explained, underscoring its upward trend against Bitcoin. \u201cRetest at $0.98 did work, continuation towards $1.35 as well and even further. Some beautiful S/R flips, I think $1.40-1.45 should hold and we can continue to $2,\u201d he stated.\n\nOptimism is his second scalability solution choice, albeit with a cautionary note on its recent substantial run. Van de Poppe recommends a dollar-cost averaging strategy for Optimism, noting \u201cthe hype is already substantial here\u2026 buying a portion on every 10 cents that\u2019s dropping to make sure that you get a nice average entry.\u201d\n\nChainlink (LINK) \u2013 The Dark Horse\n\nChainlink (LINK) emerged as his fourth pick. Van de Poppe sees its prolonged bear market and early peak against Bitcoin in 2020 as indicators of significant potential, especially in conjunction with DeFi, RWA, and NFTs. \u201cChainlink\u2026 has been going into the longest bear market that it existed\u2026 cycles will happen, and that\u2019s why the opportunity costs are big,\u201d the crypto analyst remarked.\n\n\u201cChainlink shows that the markets are looking for a higher low on the BTC pairs. Bitcoin pairs show strength in altcoins and are a key indicator in bull markets. As long as LINK stays above 0.000253 BTC, it\u2019s fine and we can start targeting 0.006 BTC,\u201d van de Poppe noted.\n\nNewsBTC\n\nSUI \u2013 The New Competitor\n\nThe final altcoin in van de Poppe\u2019s selection is SUI, a newer project he compares to successful platforms like Phantom, Avalanche, and Matic. He advises on investing in Ethereum competitors, asserting, \u201cThe final one that I am going to explain here is SUI, which is currently also starting to trend upwards. I\u2019m not sure what it is going to hold though, but outside of the Ethereum ecosystem and DeFi corner.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI want to be investing into competitors of Ethereum and you can choose SUI, DOT, ATOM, all those projects. I would like to choose something that\u2019s relatively new, SUI.\u201d\n\nLooking at the 1-day chart of SUI/BTC, the crypto analyst stated: \u201cThe ecosystems are heating up, and SUI is waking up alongside ARB and OP. Looking for the BTC pair here, which is ready to do a beautiful retest at the 0.00001710 area. If that holds, an uptrend likely starts to 0.00003000 BTC.\u201d\n\nNewsBTC\n\nCrypto Portfolio Distribution And Strategy\n\nVan de Poppe suggests a balanced portfolio distribution, advocating for a larger allocation to more established coins: 40% in Ethereum, 20% in Chainlink, and smaller portions in Arbitrum and Optimism (each 15%) as well as SUI (10%). He also emphasized the need for a dynamic approach to trading and profit-taking, saying, \u201cTrading is a lot about being flexible and having a flexible mindset.\u201d"

        "title": "Will Ethereum Reach $10k to Provide 3x Returns, Experts reckon it's better to bag Retik Finance (RETIK) for easy 10x ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is rife with exciting investment opportunities, with Ethereum (ETH) and Retik Finance (RETIK) emerging as compelling options. The possibility of Ethereum reaching the coveted $10,000 mark has generated considerable interest among investors.However, experts are also looking closely at Retik Finance, a project that promises an easy 10x return. In this article, we will delve into the factors driving Ethereum\u2019s potential rise to $10,000 and explore why experts are advocating for Retik Finance as an attractive alternative for investors seeking substantial returns.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Journey to $10,000\n\nThe Potential for Ethereum to Reach $10,000\n\nEthereum, often referred to as the \u201cworld computer,\u201d has earned its place as a pivotal technology in the digital economy. It underpins a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). This multifaceted utility positions Ethereum as a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.However, Ethereum\u2019s price journey has been marked by significant volatility, with rapid price surges followed by sharp corrections. Achieving a price milestone like $10,000 requires a combination of factors, both intrinsic and extrinsic to the Ethereum network.\n\n\n\n1. Technological Progression and Adoption\n\nEthereum\u2019s future price hinges on its continued technological development and widespread adoption. The network\u2019s transition to Ethereum 2.0, a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, is a crucial step toward scalability, energy efficiency, and reduced environmental impact. These improvements could attract more users and developers to the platform, further enhancing Ethereum\u2019s value proposition.\n\n2. Macroeconomic Trends\n\nThe broader economic context also plays a role in Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory. In 2024, two significant events could influence the cryptocurrency market positively. First, the potential shift toward looser monetary policies by the Federal Reserve could lead to increased demand for inflation-resistant assets like Ethereum. Second, the Bitcoin halving event, historically associated with crypto market rallies, could contribute to a bullish sentiment across the market.\n\n3. Deflationary Model and Growing Ecosystem\n\nEthereum\u2019s transition to a deflationary model, driven by the burning of transaction fees, has the potential to increase its scarcity and demand. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s expanding Layer-2 ecosystem, rising staking activity, and improved energy efficiency contribute to a bullish outlook.\n\n4. Decreased Selling Pressure and Institutional Interest\n\nAs Ethereum shifts from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a PoS consensus mechanism, the selling pressure from miners is expected to decrease. This could reduce the selling pressure on the market, potentially leading to price appreciation. Furthermore, growing institutional interest in Ethereum, driven by its role in DeFi, NFTs, and the digital economy, further supports its potential for price growth.\n\nExpert Insights: Ethereum at $10,000 or Beyond\n\nWhile the prospect of Ethereum reaching $10,000 is enticing, it\u2019s essential to consider expert perspectives. Analyst Lark Davis predicts that Ethereum could not only reach $10,000 but potentially surge to $15,000 by 2024. He emphasises Ethereum\u2019s unrealized potential and acknowledges that holding ETH can yield significant returns.However, Davis also highlights alternative opportunities within Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, such as Layer-2 solutions and potential airdrops. This perspective underscores the diversity of investment options within the Ethereum ecosystem, each offering distinct pathways to profit.\n\n>>>> Click Here To Buy RETIK Tokens <<<<\n\nRetik Finance (RETIK) \u2013 An Alternative for 10x Returns\n\nAs investors evaluate the potential of Ethereum, another project has garnered attention for its promise of substantial returns: Retik Finance (RETIK). Here\u2019s why experts advocate considering Retik Finance for an easy 10x return:\n\n1. Presale Stage on Fire\n\nRetik Finance (RETIK) has been making waves in the cryptocurrency community, particularly during its presale stages. The project\u2019s presale has witnessed remarkable demand and quick sellouts. As of now, the stage 3 presale is 89.33% completed, attracting daily increases in the number of holders. Experts have been predicting potential gains of up to 10,000% when Retik Finance finally launches on two major exchanges. This level of growth potential has captured the attention of traders and investors looking for promising investment opportunities.\n\n2. Utility and Innovation\n\nRetik Finance distinguishes itself through its innovative approach to addressing challenges within the cryptocurrency and fiat payment sectors. By bridging the gap between traditional fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, Retik Finance offers practical solutions.The project\u2019s emphasis on large-scale commercial applications, essential functions like SwiftPay and multilevel accounts, and robust support functions positions it as a comprehensive solution. Importantly, Retik Finance\u2019s strategy is not to replace fiat currency but to build an interface that bridges the gap effectively.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe prospect of Ethereum reaching $10,000 is undeniably intriguing, driven by its foundational technology, ecosystem expansion, and macroeconomic trends. While experts consider Ethereum a promising investment, it\u2019s essential to weigh the inherent risks and volatility in the cryptocurrency market.Simultaneously, Retik Finance (RETIK) has emerged as a compelling alternative for investors seeking an easy 10x return. Its presale stages have garnered significant attention, driven by its utility, innovation, and the explosive growth potential predicted upon its launch on major exchanges. As investors navigate the complex landscape of cryptocurrency investments, it\u2019s crucial to stay informed, diversify portfolios, and consider opportunities that align with their financial goals and risk tolerance.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance Presale\n\nVisit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):\n\nWebsite: https://retik.com/\n\nWhitepaper: https://retik.com/retik-whitepaper.pdf\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/retikfinance\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Trade Mixed Amid High-Praise For King Crypto From Jim Cramer: Analyst Says 'W - Benzinga",
        "content": "Major cryptocurrencies traded mixed on Tuesday evening as major Wall Street firms completed their paperwork last week, anticipating approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EST) Bitcoin BTC/USD +0.80% $45,252 Ethereum ETH/USD -0.49% $2,370 Dogecoin DOGE/USD -1.23% $0.091\n\nWhat Happened: On Tuesday, altcoins such as Ethereum and Solana experienced a slight drop.\n\nThis occurred as Jim Cramer, former hedge fund manager and host of CNBC's Mad Money, reversed his previously bearish stance on Bitcoin on Tuesday morning. This shift comes ahead of anticipated U.S. regulatory approval of a spot ETF and as the price of bitcoin rose above $45,000 for the first time in 21 months.\n\n\u201cThis thing, you can\u2019t kill it,\u201d Cramer told CNBC\u2019s David Faber. \u201cBitcoin is a technological marvel and I think people need to start recognizing it\u2019s here to stay.\u201d Cramer also observed another well-known Bitcoin skeptic, remarking that the late Charlie Munger \u201cwas blind to this.\u201d\n\nIn other news that comes as a major development, Michael Saylor, the co-founder of the business intelligence company MicroStrategy Inc. MSTR, on Tuesday sold company shares worth around $216 million. The 315,000 shares that were sold were acquired through stock options, as mentioned in Tuesday's filing.\n\nCoinbase COIN suffered its largest daily decline since mid-2023 despite a surge in Bitcoin to a 21-month high. Coinbase shares closed the session just below $157, marking a 9.8% drop on the first trading day of the year. This decline followed by losses on Friday, attributed to profit-taking at the end of the year following a nearly fivefold increase in the stock price in 2023.\n\nFurthermore, the rally in bitcoin did not benefit bitcoin miners, as they experienced a reversal from early gains to modest losses. Both Marathon Digital MARA and Riot Platforms RIOT closed 1%-2% lower than Friday\u2019s closing price and nearly 10% lower than their opening price. Cryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EDT) Astar ASTR/USD +18.04% $0.16 Arbitrum ARB/USD +10.38% $1.92 Maker MKR/USD +9.41% $1,819\n\nTop Gainer (24 Hour)\n\nThe global crypto market cap has reached $1.73 trillion, marking a 0.03% decrease in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe S&P 500 declined on the first trading day of the year, prompted by a slight rise in bond yields and profit-taking after a remarkably strong 2023. The S&P 500 index dropped by 0.57% to finish at 4,742.83. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite experienced its weakest performance since October, with a 1.63% pullback to 14,765.94.\n\nNotably, markets were closed on Monday for New Year's Day.\n\nSee More: Best Cryptocurrency Scanners\n\nAnalyst Notes: Cryptocurrency analyst Michael Van de Poppe predicts a new rally for Bitcoin as the year kicks off, aiming for new highs.\n\n\"I\u2019m still expecting continuation towards $48-51K and find a potential resistance there.ETF to be approved this week?!\"\n\nPseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst PlanB maintains that his predictions have remained unchanged since late 2022, even amidst the challenging conditions of the bear market. He confidently asserts, \u201cWe will hit $100k in 2024.\u201d\n\nProviding forward guidance for 2024, PlanB reaffirms the predictions made on Oct 6, 2022, when Bitcoin was at $20k.\n\n\"\u2013 rise into April 2024 halving\n\n\u2013 halving around S2F model value 55k (range 30k-100k)\n\n\u2013 pump after halving\n\n\u2013 we will hit 100k in 2024\n\n\u2013 S2F target value 532k average (range 250k-1m)\"\n\nAccording to Santiment, a company specializing in on-chain analytics, the market value of Bitcoin has surged to $45.8K, reaching its highest point since April 2021. This upward trend has also spurred the rise of various alternative cryptocurrencies in early 2024. Several breakout assets are showing consistent patterns in social volume. If the fear of missing out (FOMO) does not excessively influence the market, cryptocurrencies such as ICP, FIL, ARB, BSV, MKR, and SEI could potentially experience significant growth.\n\nPhoto by SvetlanaParnikova on Shutterstock\n\nRead Next: Jim Cramer Advises Against Using Binance, Provokes Strong Reactions From Twitter Users"

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nAccording to Lark Davis, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH), has not showcased significant growth during the year but could be heading towards a major spike in 2024.\n\nDespite this, many who are pessimistic about its future are turning towards Pullix (PLX), the first community-driven exchange with DEX and CEX features will revolutionize TradFi,after raising over $2million in less than four weeks investors are flocking to get a piece of the Pullix pie.\n\nEthereum (ETH) to Make Investors Millionaires in 2024 According to Lark Davis\n\nEthereum (ETH) increased in value by 100% during the year, and despite this, it has been lagging behind the competition. On December 26, crypto analyst and YouTuber Lark Davis commented on how the Ethereum altcoin will make a lot of new millionaires in 2024.\n\nHowever, the analyst noted that those with a lot of ETH, purchased at lower prices and stacked, will do well in the next bull run. Those getting into the market now, with the Ethereum altcoin trading at over $2,000, will not make it big unless they have a lot to invest.\n\nLark highlighted a number of L2 listings, such as zkSync, Starknet, Linea, Scroll, Blast, Manta, and Celestia.If the crypto makes gains similar to the last cycle's high, this could result in an Ethereum price prediction of $15,000.\n\nPullix (PLX) to Position Itself as a Market Leader With Presale Dominance\n\nPullix (PLX) is now attracting a lot of attention from ETH investors as an alternative that will solve issues found in DEXs and CEXs. The Pullix platform will be community-driven, and users will gain the opportunity to trade CFDs and futures and for anyone to trade without undergoing KYC procedures. They can margin trade across all assets and even gain up to 1000:1 in leverage.\n\nIt's a comprehensive and easy-to-use platform consisting of a DeFi and NFT launchpad for exciting investment opportunities alongside this. PLX is the native crypto that will be used as collateral for trading and will utilize the revenue-sharing model. This way, anyone can get passive income when they are a part of the ecosystem. To become eligible, users must engage by providing liquidity to the automated market makers (AMMs) on top of the platform.\n\nThe Pullix team has also partnered with institutional liquidity providers. Users can margin trade across all asset classes and gain up to 1000:1 leverage. Holders can also add to markets or make suggestions on new assets to add.\n\nDuring its current Stage 5 presale, PLX trades at $0.07. Stage 5 is continuing to attract massive attention across the marketplace after successfully selling over 40million tokens in less than 30 days. Analysts also project a massive upswing following the token's listing on Tier-1 exchanges, as a result Pullix is set to 30x upon launch.\n\nSummary\n\nEthereum can shine during 2024, but it won't be alone, as Pullix emerges as a major competitor. By introducing an exchange, lending protocol, VaultX, and Swaps, alongside Yield Farming and Copy Trading opportunities, Pullix is positioning itself as a leader in the market and can reach new heights.\n\nFor more information regarding Pullix\u2019s presale see links below:\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Tue 02 Jan 2024 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Eddy S.\n\nWhile Ethereum maintains its undisputed first place in terms of TVL, competition is heating up for the following spots. TRON, as well as powerful challengers, are emerging and attracting billions of dollars into their respective crypto ecosystems.\n\nTron and BNB Chain: The Ambiguous Winners of TVL\n\nRight behind Ethereum, TRON secures second place and BNB Chain takes third in terms of TVL. These two networks have greatly benefited from the enthusiasm around algorithmic stablecoins in 2023.\n\nProjects such as USDD on TRON or BUSD on BNB Chain have attracted numerous users enticed by the promise of high returns. Despite the risks posed by the instability of these assets, crypto investors have flocked to these platforms offering tempting yield farming opportunities.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether this value will stay locked in the long term or if it evaporates as quickly as it arrived. Because TRON and BNB Chain remain synonymous with risk for many in the crypto sphere. But for now, these networks are well placed behind Ethereum.\n\nThe Challengers Making Their Mark on the DeFi Market\n\nNext, there\u2019s a heterogeneous mix of layer 2 solutions and rival blockchains. In this top 10, there are Arbitrum, Solana, Blast, Optimism, Avalanche, Polygon, Base, Cardano. These projects share the common goal of having managed to build attractive DeFi ecosystems and draining billions of dollars in secured value.\n\nFor instance, Polygon has established itself as a popular option for decentralized yield farming due to negligible crypto transaction fees. Meanwhile, Solana relies on its speed and throughput to attract ambitious DeFi projects. As for Avalanche, it has built a reputation as an \u201cEthereum compatible\u201d chain which offers reassurance.\n\nThe underdogs are also present, as shown by the emergence this year of networks such as Near, Harmony, or the newcomers Base, Blast, and Aptos in the top 15 TVLs. Proof, if any were needed, that the DeFi space remains open to innovation.\n\nFueled by the excitement for crypto, the DeFi ecosystem has continued to grow in 2023. Consequently, it has seen the rise of numerous blockchain challengers like TRON. But while Ethereum undoubtedly remains the leader, the competition for the second spot is fierce. In a Far West where caution is still advised. The coming months will be decisive in determining which networks will be sustainable.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nWhile Ethereum has remained the unrivaled top altcoin for a long time, Solana's recent surge above $100 is a strong indication that it could become a major competitor. In 2023 alone, the price of Solana has increased by more than 950%, while Ethereum has managed only 100%.\n\nAs the big names lock horns, a new DeFi project has emerged as the potential dark horse for the bull market. After building substantial traction in December, does Meme Moguls (MGLS) have what it takes to outpace the current market leaders?\n\nEthereum Now Has a Worth Competitor in Solana (SOL)\n\nSolana (SOL) has been the standout performer in 2023, outperforming the rest of the market. The price of Solana has increased by more than 950% since the start of the year. In December, SOL rallied as high as $120, becoming one of the top 5 cryptocurrencies in the process.\n\nThis rally has piqued excitement about the altcoin among market experts. According to experts, Solana now looks like a worthy competitor of Ethereum. Unlike Ethereum's large market capital, SOL has attracted many investors due to its exceptional growth.\n\nThe recent discussion by David Hoffman and Ryan Adams emphasizes why they believe Solana is going to be a very strong competitor against Ethereum. It is considered to be a better cryptocurrency network because it offers the tradeoff with higher efficiency, lower fees, and faster speed.\n\nThese features have helped the Solana network become one of the most active hubs for meme coins and other top DeFi coins. As this growth extends in 2024, Ivan on Tech has predicted that the price of Solana could reach $200 in January. However, there is a new altcoin challenger, Meme Moguls.\n\nCan Meme Moguls (MGLS) Outperform the Top Altcoins in 2024?\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS) has captured the interest of investors in December largely because of its uniqueness. As its name suggests, the project is built around memes; however, this new DeFiproject has introduced the crypto space to a one-of-a-kind ecosystem.\n\nThe ecosystem is designed to help users improve their trading and memecoin-picking skills. Users will partake in virtual trading competitions using advanced trading strategies. The most profitable portfolios of users are rewarded.\n\nAnother element that has piqued users' interest is the \"wealth leaderboard\" of Meme Moguls. This feature was added to give the top 20 players a share of the platform's daily earnings. Because the benefits are in cash, Meme Moguls is an extremely profitable site.\n\nThe goal is to develop a friendly, competitive environment among its user base. This strategy was successful, as thousands of new members joined Meme Moguls in December. They have also given more than $1 million to the ecosystem's development.\n\nThe utility token of the ecosystem, MGLS, has responded in return, rallying to a new high of $0.0025 in December. However, as the platform debuts early in 2024, analysts have forecasted a 25x price surge.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nSolana's rally above $100 has confirmed claims that it could challenge Ethereum for the top altcoin position. Meanwhile, Meme Moguls (MGLS) continues to grow behind the scenes. However, the projections make MGLS one of the top 5 cryptocurrencies to buy ahead of the 2024 bull market.\n\nVisit Meme Moguls\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) continues to maintain its position as a cornerstone of the DeFi market. Recent market analysis by crypto analyst Rekt Capital has added further excitement for this altcoin. Meanwhile, whales are flocking to a new ICO in stage three of its presale that many experts have hinted may see a surge of 100x in 2024. Today, we will find out why.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction\n\nCrypto analyst Rekt Capital recently made a bullish Ethereum (ETH) price prediction. According to him, Ethereum may experience a significant increase of around 22% upon securing $2,274 as a support level. This prediction depends heavily on Ethereum\u2019s capacity to establish this pivotal level of support.\n\nIn terms of the Ethereum price movement, it has increased from $2,226 on December 21 to $2,366 on December 28. The technical analysis of the Ethereum crypto also paints a bullish picture, as over 29 technical indicators are showing green. Its Fear & Greed index rating also indicates a 73 (Greed) \u2013 good bullish signs.\n\nDue to all these reasons, experts foresee the Ethereum price reaching $2,608 in January 2024. This makes ETH one of the top altcoins on the market.\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS): The Best ICO\n\nAmidst this projection, whales gravitate towards Meme Moguls (MGLS) \u2013 an innovative meme coin that may dominate the sector. In stage three of its presale, it has already raised over $1M while selling millions of MGLS tokens. Whales are confident about its long-term growth potential as it could revolutionize the meme industry.\n\nMeme Moguls will introduce a one-of-a-kind P2E game where you can engage in virtual stock market trading games. At the beginning of the game, you start with $100,000 in virtual cash, and you may complete trading challenges and missions to convert your profits into actual returns.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Big News, Moguls!\n\nWe\u2019re launching our exclusive Tier System to thank YOU for the amazing presale response! \ud83e\udd2f\n\n\ud83c\udf1f From Bronze Visionaries to Platinum Emperors, unlock unique benefits & rewards.\n\nYour journey to becoming a Meme Whale starts now! \ud83d\udca8\n\nFor more info:\u2026 pic.twitter.com/NVD5px955O \u2014 Meme Moguls (@meme_moguls) December 27, 2023\n\nWhile this game is the main attraction for traders, the Meme Moguls team will also introduce other components in its ecosystem:\n\nStaking: You can increase your MGLS token holdings by contributing their tokens to the Meme Moguls staking pool.\n\nMoguls World: An expansive metaverse offering connections, token mining, participation in liquidity pools, and token staking opportunities.\n\nThe MGLS utility token serves as the in-game currency that powers all these features and as a governance token, benefitting its holders. It costs just $0.0025, and those who bought it early enjoy a 31% ROI. As the presale advances, more price hikes are expected, and once it launches in 2024 \u2013 experts forecast a 100x growth from its current value.\n\nWith the recent reveal of the Meme Moguls tier system, interest in this meme coin has skyrocketed. This tier system will reward MGLS holders based on the value of their holdings. Rewards include a VIP NFT pass and the ability to speak with a Meme Moguls team member. If you wish to obtain these rewards, stockpile the MGLS token now while it is on a discount. Follow the links below and earn a 15% deposit bonus.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile Ethereum may see further growth, its high market cap suggests it may take some time to achieve significant surges. To clarify, ETH has a market cap of $283B \u2013 meaning a large influx of new funds is needed for its value to surge. On the other hand, Meme Moguls has a market cap of $7.5M, suggesting faster growth.\n\nWith The Crypto Basic reporting that Shiba Inu has already provided early buyers with a 1.6M% ROI in just three years, Meme Moguls could see the same growth faster. Because of this, whales are flooding this crypto ICO event instead of banking on Ethereum skyrocketing again.\n\nLearn more about the $MGLS here:\n\nVisit Meme Moguls | Join the Community\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "(NewsDirect)\n\nCryptocurrency markets often move in response to various factors, including the sentiments and predictions of industry analysts. Recently, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez predicted a bearish Ethereum (ETH) price. This sparked reactions within the crypto community as they are now turning towards a new ICO in Stage 8 of its presale called Everlodge, which experts have pegged as the next 30x token in 2024. Let\u2019s find out more.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction\n\nAccording to Ali Martinez, Ethereum (ETH) has recently seen 200,000 ETH tokens (valued at around $460M) transferred to crypto exchange wallets. This transfer increase may cause the Ethereum price to experience volatility and significant changes soon. At this time, the Ethereum crypto is trading hands at $2,322 - a 4.31% rise from its price of $2,230 on December 21.\n\nThe technical analysis points to a bullish sentiment for Ethereum, as 29 technical indicators are in the green. Because of this, CoinCodex analysts forecast that the Ethereum price may reach $2,463 in January 2024.\n\nHowever, the uncertainty surrounding Ethereum is high at the moment. We will have to wait to determine if these large transfers dramatically impact Ethereum\u2019s price. Therefore, many traders are gravitating to a new ICO that may be more stable and with a higher growth ceiling.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG): One Of The Best DeFi Coins\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) is a crypto ICO that could disrupt markets. With its innovative features, it has the potential to reign supreme in the real estate market (valued at over $280T). Essentially, Everlodge will be the world\u2019s first NFT marketplace backed by real-world luxurious villas, hotels, and more.\n\nThis innovative approach will solve many issues found on other real estate investment platforms. For instance, compared to conventional real estate investments, NFTs offer enhanced liquidity. Everlodge will let you trade these NFTs on secondary markets, potentially facilitating faster entry and exit strategies.What makes them the best NFTs to buy is also the fact that these NFTs are fractionalized. Therefore, if you buy just one piece of it for prices as low as $100, you will gain passive income when the actual property gets rented out or its value appreciates.\n\nWhile the marketplace is the main attraction of this DeFi project, its team will also include other components in its ecosystem:\n\nLending: Marketplace property co-owners use property-backed NFTs as collateral, accessing short to medium-term loans.\n\nRewards Club: Members earn free stays at Everlodge properties, allowing for resale to generate additional income.\n\nLaunchpad: Unlock early access to upcoming projects in development, maximizing your potential return on investment (ROI).\n\nThe ELDG native token powers all these features and is used as the primary payment currency on Everlodge. Holding this token will bring you passive income via staking and discounts on trading fees. It is now worth just $0.027 in Stage 8 of its presale. Demand is high as over 12M tokens have been sold already, and early buyers are enjoying a 170% ROI.\n\nIf you wish to purchase it, now is the perfect time, as Everlodge offers a 10% deposit bonus. It may be the best crypto investment, with predictions of a 3,000% price pump after ELDG launches and hits exchanges.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile Ethereum faces challenges, Everlodge may capitalize as its interest grows daily. It also gains a competitive edge if we look at its market cap, which now sits at $14.3M - drastically lower than Ethereum\u2019s $279B. This means that ELDG will only need $14.3M for its current price to double, bringing significant returns to buyers at a faster rate. Because of this, Everlodge looks to be the best DeFi crypto.\n\nVisit Everlodge\n\nEverlodge provides you with a seamless approach to fractional investing in vacation rentals, eliminating the complexities associated with traditional real estate investment. Our innovative platform revolutionizes the way people invest in second homes.\n\nContact Details\n\nEverldoge.io\n\nadmin@everlodge.io\n\nCompany Website\n\nhttps://everlodge.io/\n\nCopyright (c) 2024 TheNewswire - All rights reserved."
