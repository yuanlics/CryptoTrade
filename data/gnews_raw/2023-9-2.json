        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of the Ethereum (ETH) network, has sold his remaining stake of MakerDAO tokens.\n\nOnchain data from Etherscan, shared by Lookonchain, shows that Buterin sold 500 MKR tokens, which he had held for the last two years.\n\nThe sale, made through CoW Protocol, netted Buterin a total of 353 ETH, which is approximately $580,000 at current rates.\n\nButerin initially invested in MakerDAO in April 2018, purchasing 1071 MKR tokens at $905 each. His recent sale implies a gain of about 27%. The Ethereum co-founder\u2019s last interaction with his MKR tokens was in April 2021, when he donated 100 tokens to India\u2019s Covid relief fund.\n\nHis action follows a Sept. 1 blog entry by Rune Christensen, MakerDAO\u2019s co-founder and CEO. In the post, Christensen detailed ambitious plans for a new iteration of the project on a different blockchain, tentatively named NewChain.\n\nThe last phase of Endgame is the launch of a native blockchain for Maker with the codename NewChain\n\n\n\nIt will make the ecosystem more secure and efficient\n\n\n\nAfter some research, I believe the Solana codebase should be considered as the basis for NewChainhttps://t.co/KyGxBBGlVH \u2014 Rune (@RuneKek) September 1, 2023\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin throws shade at XRP centralization\n\nMakerDAO may move to Solana\n\nAccording to the MakerDAO frontman, the proposed blockchain could potentially be a fork of Solana (SOL), which is a significant development, especially considering MakerDAO\u2019s current roots in Ethereum.\n\nIn the blog, Christensen explained that his choice to potentially explore Solana is driven by three key reasons. He cited the technical quality and enhancement of the Solana codebase, the ability to outlast hardships displayed by Solana following the collapse of FTX, and the success stories of previous Solana forks, such as the Pyth Network, which runs an adapted version of Solana as its backend.\n\nChristensen envisions a future where NewChain serves as a secure conduit between Ethereum and Solana. However, he did not limit his options to Solana. He also name-dropped Aptos, Sui, and Cosmos as alternatives.\n\nThe main benefits of Cosmos were its \u201clarge and high quality\u201d pool of talent, as well as its wide range of independent developers, Christensen said.\n\nRead more: Solana Pay partners with Shopify to enable USDC payments\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

Circuit ordered a review of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) denial of crypto asset manager Grayscale\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application. The Court said the SEC had failed to provide a \u201ccoherent explanation\u201d for the denial.\n\nEthereum (ETH) took inconsequential seven-day losses of 0.4% and now changes hands at $1,646.\n\nVirtually every other leading cryptocurrency is approximately the same price it was last weekend except Toncoin (TON), which blew up 22% to trade at $1.75, and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which rose 8.6% to $206.87.\n\nToncoin\u2019s bullish momentum can be attributed to the development of the TON ecosystem.\n\nThe TON Foundation, which spun out from Telegram to develop TON, recently released a Telegram-centric Web3 app store and launched a community-driven initiative, Believers.ton, to promote ecosystem development.\n\nBitcoin Cash was one of the fastest risers when the Grayscale/SEC news broke on Tuesday and appears to have sustained the rally into the weekend. Similarly, Coinbase stock soared 15% in the hours following the news.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAny intraweek gains that Bitcoin and Ethereum made were wiped out early on Friday as the industry reacted to news that the SEC needed more time to approve or reject 6 Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nAll told, it was another excruciatingly slow news cycle this week for those looking to see some sign of growing global crypto adoption. On Thursday, airline Giant Lufthansa launched an NFT-based loyalty program on Polygon.

        "content": "A cold wallet owned by collapsed crypto exchange FTX moved almost $10 million in altcoins from Solana to Ethereum since Aug. 31 for undisclosed reasons, according to on-chain data.\n\nThe altcoins include notable tokens like LINK, SUSHI, LUNA, and YFI. The transfers were conducted through Wormhole Bridge.\n\nIt is unclear if the transfers are connected to the exchange\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings or its recent request to hire Galaxy Digital to sell its crypto holdings for fiat.\n\nFTX did not respond to a request for comment as of press time.\n\nFTX looking to sell assets\n\nFTX recently filed a request with the bankruptcy court seeking permission to engage Galaxy Digital Capital Management as its investment manager for certain digital assets. The exchange also requested permission to stake some idle crypto assets to generate passive yield.\n\nUnder the proposed agreement, Galaxy would manage, trade, and convert FTX\u2019s assets into fiat currency or stablecoins, and hedge the collapsed exchange\u2019s exposure to volatile cryptocurrencies in return for a monthly fiduciary fee.\n\nFTX argued that Galaxy\u2019s expertise in selling large cryptocurrency positions without affecting the market made it a suitable choice. The engagement aimed to support FTX\u2019s restructuring efforts by monetizing its cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nAdditionally, the exchange has filed a separate motion to establish guidelines for managing and selling its digital assets and to enter into hedging arrangements on eligible cryptocurrencies \u2014 primarily Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nCreditors criticize pace\n\nFTX is facing criticism from creditors over the slow pace of its bankruptcy plan negotiations.\n\nThe exchange\u2019s attorney, Brian Glueckstein, resisted calls for expedited mediation at the latest bankruptcy hearing on Aug. 23, saying the process is on track for conclusion in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nA draft plan proposed by FTX on July 31 outlined the intent to repay customers through asset liquidation and litigation against insiders. However, tensions have risen over FTX\u2019s efforts to find a buyer for its international exchange, FTX.com, and the lack of information shared about incoming bids.\n\nCreditors\u2019 committee attorney, Kris Hansen, also highlighted the $50 million monthly spent on attorneys\u2019 fees and other costs due to FTX\u2019s delay in resolving creditor concerns. FTX seeks to increase creditors\u2019 recovery through lawsuits against its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, investment firm K5, and the founders of FTX acquisition targets.\n\nThe bankruptcy case was filed in November 2022 after allegations that FTX misused and lost billions of dollars of customers\u2019 crypto deposits."

        "title": "What Is Optimism Crypto? - DailyCoin",
        "content": "What is Optimism? Is it an innate sense of positivity; a belief that everything will turn out for the best?\n\nTo ordinary people, yes. That\u2019s exactly what it is. For crypto enthusiasts, on the other hand, Optimism is something quite different.\n\nOptimism is an Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution that aims to make Vitalik Buterin\u2019s blockchain faster, affordable, and ultimately more accessible. As the Ethereum blockchain has grown in popularity and usage, it\u2019s become clear that the network\u2019s sluggish speeds and extortionate gas fees are ill-equipped for crypto mass adoption.\n\nWhat is Optimism (OP), and how does it work? In a crowded niche, what separates Optimism from the dozens of other Layer-2 blockchains like Arbitrum (ARB) or Polygon zkEVM?\n\nWhat is Optimism (OP)?\n\nOptimism, known by its native token symbol OP, is one of the Ethereum network\u2019s leading Layer-2 scaling solutions. It resolves the litany of issues plaguing the Ethereum blockchain, namely scalability and high transaction fees.\n\nThe Optimism project is spearheaded by the Optimism Foundation, a passionate team of developers and decentralization enthusiasts dedicated to improving Ethereum (ETH) and ensuring its long-term growth and sustainability. The foundation\u2019s work has given birth to one of the most promising Layer-2 solutions, with Optimism going from strength to strength since its launch.\n\nHow Does Optimism Work?\n\nCreatively named, Optimism is what crypto people call an Optimistic Rollup. In simple terms, Optimistic rollups are a method of batching groups of Layer-2 blockchain transaction data into one \u2018rolled up\u2019 transaction that can then be secured on the Ethereum mainnet, a Layer-1.\n\nProcessing transactions off-chain significantly reduces the load on the main network, meaning that Layer-2 users can enjoy all of Ethereum\u2019s functionality without suffering its low speeds and crippling gas fees.\n\nA sequencer handles optimism block production. The sequencer is responsible for instant transaction confirmations and blockchain state updates, constructing and executing Layer-2 blocks, and submitting user transactions to Layer-1.\n\nWhy are they called Optimistic rollups, you ask? When it comes to blockchain security, Optimism operates on the principle of \u2018fault proofs.\u2019 This means that node operators operate on the \u2018optimistic\u2019 approach that the state of the blockchain is correct, secure, and doesn\u2019t require proof of validity. It is removed and replaced if this state is challenged and found faulty.\n\nAs is always the case among Layer-2s, Optimism runs an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). This makes it easy for Ethereum developers to redeploy their favorite EVM-based dApps and smart contracts directly on Optimism and gives users a sense of familiarity with the network.\n\nThe Optimism Token\n\nAt the heart of Optimism is the OP token, the native cryptocurrency token of the network. OP is an ERC-20 token that plays a crucial role in the governance and future development of the Optimism network, serving as the requirement for OP community members to join and contribute to decision-making processes. It may come as a surprise, but OP is not used to pay Optimism gas fees.\n\nOne of the largest crypto airdrops to date, the OP token was distributed to hundreds of thousands of Optimism wallets. Those lucky qualifying addresses were people who\u2019d positively contributed to Optimism\u2019s growth, whether they were DAO voters, multi-sig signers, or simple users who interacted with Optimism dApps.\n\nOP\u2019s first airdrop shared over 200M OP tokens and marked the birth of Optimism\u2019s governance model, known as the Optimism Collective. This governing body collective comprises two separate houses: The Token House and the Citizens\u2019 House.\n\nComprised of OP token holders, The Token House handles protocol governance. Through decentralized governance proposals, the Token House manages everything from protocol upgrades to inflation adjustments, treasury appropriations, rights protection, and governance fund grants.\n\nOn the other hand, the Citizens\u2019 House is an experimental attempt at a non-plutocratic governance model, which aims to draw power and influence away from crypto whales. The Citizen\u2019s House manages retroactive public goods funding, which rewards builders and developers who create products and services that grow the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nOptimism Ecosystem\n\nAs you\u2019d expect from a top Layer-2 network, the Optimism ecosystem is a vibrant and dynamic space with an excellent variety of dApps. Thanks to roll-up technology, Optimism is paving the way for a new era of Ethereum-based applications that are faster, cheaper, and more efficient than what\u2019s available on the mainnet.\n\nDeFi\n\nDecentralized Finance, or DeFi, is undoubtedly one of the most transformative applications of blockchain technology. Optimism\u2019s EVM compatibility and low fees have made it the perfect playground for creative DeFi applications.\n\nClassic decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and Sushiswap have both moved in and set up camp on Optimism, but they\u2019re outclassed in TVL (Total Value Locked) and trading volume by Velodrome, Optimism\u2019s native DEX.\n\nOther DeFi platforms on Optimism can offer financial services like lending, borrowing, and yield farming through popular platforms like AAVE and Optimism\u2019s dedicated lending market, Sonne Finance. Synthetix (SNX), another popular application on the network, supports derivatives and synthetic asset trading.\n\nNFTs\n\nWhile Optimism DeFi is a force to be reckoned with, NFTs on the network have struggled to stay relevant. What\u2019s more interesting is that this trend is consistent across all Layer-2 networks, not just Optimism.\n\nEven though Layer-2 networks, whether they\u2019re optimistic rollups or zk-rollups (zero-knowledge), make it cheaper and easier to trade and mint NFTs, NFT culture still resides largely on Layer-1 networks like Ethereum and Solana (SOL).\n\nDespite iconic NFT marketplaces like Opensea integrating support for Optimism, NFT trading volume is almost non-existent.\n\nA quick look at the top collections page on Quix, Optimism\u2019s top NFT marketplace, shows that the last week of trading volume barely tips over 0.1 ETH. Opensea doesn\u2019t fare much better, with the world\u2019s most recognizable NFT platform tipping the scales at around two ETH per week.\n\nThe Optimism Superchain\n\nTo expand Ethereum\u2019s capabilities further than we\u2019ve ever thought possible, Optimism has set out to build a horizontally scalable network of blockchains called the Optimism Superchain. With the vision of growing a wider network of standardized, open-source Layer-2 networks, the Superchain tackles Ethereum\u2019s scalability crisis from a new angle.\n\nThe central engine of the Superchain is the OP Stack, an open-source development toolkit that unifies all Superchain networks and ensures they\u2019re all beating to the same rhythm. It guarantees that all networks are built using the same security features and communication systems to maintain a cohesive ecosystem.\n\nMoreover, the Superchain introduces a new revenue model that rewards developers with fees from their respective chains and applications. Optimism\u2019s Superchain has proven a popular choice for large-scale businesses, including Worldcoin (WLD) and Coinbase\u2019s Base Chain.\n\nOptimism vs. Arbitrum\n\nTwo names reign supreme in the fierce and competitive race to become the ultimate Ethereum scaling solution. At face value, there\u2019s not a huge difference between Optimism and Arbitrum. Both networks are optimistic rollups that improve Ethereum\u2019s scalability.\n\nUnderneath the hood, the main difference is how they handle fraud proofing. While Optimism uses single-round fraud proofs, Arbitrum takes this one step further with multi-round proofs. The result? Optimism is a faster network, but it runs the risk of having higher gas fees than Arbitrum during periods of Ethereum congestion.\n\nDiving into the on-chain metrics, Arbitrum is king in the eye of DeFi users. According to DeFiLlama, Arbitrum has more than double Optimism\u2019s TVL (Total Value Locked) and almost 3x as many protocols built on the network. But if you\u2019re an Optimism fan, don\u2019t lose heart.\n\nRecent trends indicate a change in the guard. Over the past few months, daily transactions and active addresses on Arbitrum have steadily declined, while the same metrics on Optimism show sustained growth.\n\nOptimism Pros and Cons\n\nShould we be feeling optimistic or pessimistic about Optimism? Let\u2019s dive into the pros and cons.\n\nPros\n\nScalability \u2013 Optimism offers greater transaction speeds and throughput than the Ethereum mainnet, making it better suited to supporting a large user base.\n\n\u2013 Optimism offers greater transaction speeds and throughput than the Ethereum mainnet, making it better suited to supporting a large user base.

The network\u2019s success depends not only on its own merits but also on how it stacks up against its rivals.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nOptimism is just one Layer-2 provider among a sea of competitors. Dozens of Layer-2 networks are joining the race, some with greater resources and more modern infrastructure. While Optimism was one of the first Layer-2s to hit the market, there is a chance its competitors will outperform it.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nEthereum is undeniably the largest Layer-1 blockchain in the industry. However, its scalability concerns make it unusable for most of the global population. Optimism resolves these problems while retaining a focus on decentralization that Ethereum can be proud of.\n\nFAQs"

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nRenowned macro guru Raoul Pal expresses unwavering optimism in the face of lingering market uncertainties. Pal, a steadfast bull, maintains that his bullish stance, which he has held for an extended period, remains unshaken.\n\nWhen questioned about the foundation of his bullish outlook, Pal elucidated that he believes the much-anticipated recession, which had loomed ominously on the economic horizon, was largely factored into the market dynamics last year. According to him, the substantial downturns witnessed in equity markets and the cryptocurrency realm during that period were clear manifestations of this anticipatory pricing.\n\nRaoul Pal\u2019s Unwavering Bullish Stance\n\nIn a recent interview with Crypto Banter, Pal reiterated his consistent perspective, asserting that the long-anticipated recession has already transpired and was duly assimilated by the markets in the preceding year.\n\nTo illustrate this point, he cited the substantial market fluctuations, including a precipitous 75% decline in cryptocurrencies and a 30-35% dip in stock values, as compelling evidence of the market\u2019s proactive response to the impending economic cycle.\n\nPal expounded on how the market had preemptively adjusted to these anticipated changes in the prior year. Subsequently, it embarked on a path of anticipatory behavior, as evidenced by the discernible surge in liquidity since the month of June.\n\nDrawing from his forward-looking indicators, Pal revealed that liquidity had exhibited an upward trajectory since June of the preceding year. These indicators played a pivotal role in shaping his investment decisions, most notably in Ethereum, where he augmented his holdings during a significant market sell-off.\n\nContemplating the future landscape, Pal highlights that current data trends are now harmonizing with his forward-looking indicators. He emphasized that inflationary pressures are gradually receding, while unemployment figures are showing a gradual ascent. Furthermore, economic growth appears to be losing momentum. These unfolding trends, in Pal\u2019s assessment, suggest that the Federal Reserve may, in due course, contemplate halting its ongoing rate hikes and, potentially, resort to rate cuts in a bid to sustain economic stability."

        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nIn this thrilling quest for the 100x dream, we navigate the intricate world of cryptocurrency, focusing on three key players \u2013 Pomerdoge (POMD), Optimism (OP), and the tried and true Ethereum (ETH). Pomerdoge, currently in its presale phase, teases the intriguing possibility of significant returns for early investors. Let\u2019s take a closer look at which of these three assets stands out as a potential game-changer in the industry.\n\nClick Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale\n\nPomerdoge (POMD): More Than Just Another Meme Coin\n\nIn a world dominated by meme-themed cryptos, Pomerdoge steps onto the stage with a bark loud enough to challenge the established giants like Dogecoin. Pomerdoge uniquely intertwines a play-to-earn gaming model with its meme heritage, offering players both entertainment and genuine financial prospects.\n\nPomerdoge\u2019s proposition goes beyond fun; players can genuinely earn from competing and actively engaging within its vibrant ecosystem. This ability to provide actual utility sets Pomerdoge apart in a crowded memecoin arena.\n\nThe heart of this dynamic platform is its gaming arena, a melting pot for enthusiasts worldwide. They don\u2019t just play; they compete, connect, and most importantly, earn. With the trustworthiness of the Ethereum blockchain underpinning it, Pomerdoge participants can indulge in the assurance of security.\n\nBut Pomerdoge\u2019s ambition doesn\u2019t stop at play. Its dedication to transparency and safety is commendable, evident in its successful audit partnership with Interfi Network and the firm decision to lock its liquidity, ensuring stability for its community.\n\nThere\u2019s already palpable enthusiasm for Pomerdoge, with millions of POMD tokens being sold for just $0.007 a piece during phase one of the presale. Observers who\u2019ve witnessed Dogecoin\u2019s meteoric rise in 2017 see parallels, and whispers abound of Pomerdoge mirroring that success to reach $1.00 by 2024.\n\nOptimism (OP): The Coinbase Collaboration and the 39% Price Jump\n\nThe buzz surrounding Optimism reached a fever pitch with its partnership with Coinbase on a Layer-2 product. This news not only showcased Optimism\u2019s growing prominence but also triggered a substantial 39% price surge, pushing its value to $2.38 within a mere 24 hours.\n\nAfter navigating a drop to $0.90 in mid-June, Optimism has regained some of its lost ground and currently hovers around $1.55. Many are optimistic (pun intended) about Optimism\u2019s prospects, suggesting that Optimism could potentially touch the $5.00 mark before 2025.\n\nYet, for Optimism holders on the hunt for even more lucrative opportunities, market analysts are converging on a common sentiment: Pomerdoge seems to be the most enticing bet. With Pomerdoge\u2019s presale still in its initial phase, the window of opportunity for exponential returns appears wide open.\n\nWhile Optimism is doing well, the layer-2 space is becoming increasingly crowded, with projects like Arbitrum stealing market share from Optimism. Therefore, the potential for a 100x return that Pomerdoge offers is simply too hard to resist for many investors.\n\nEthereum (ETH): The $10,000 Dream vs. Pomerdoge (POMD)\u2019s Potential\n\nAs the undisputed king of smart contracts, Ethereum has come a long way since its initial coin offering in 2014. Currently hovering around $1,851 per token, some analysts project that the value of Ethereum could cross $10,000 by 2024.\n\nThat said, growth could be stunted if scaling issues continue to plague the Ethereum blockchain. There is also the dreaded \u201cdeath cross\u201d on Ethereum\u2019s weekly chart. The Ethereum price fell 60% the last time this occurred.\n\nOn the flip side, Pomerdoge appears to be bucking the bearish trend. An increasing number of Ethereum enthusiasts, possibly sensing greater promise in newer ventures, are trading their ETH for POMD during Pomerdoge\u2019s presale event.\n\nAnalysts note that the $2,000 resistance is the key level for Ethereum to watch. If the price can break through this barrier, it could be on its way torward $2,500 and 10,000 in the longer term. Still, these gains pale in comparison to the potential of Pomerdoge, where returns of 100x are not out of the question.\n\nFind out more about the Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale Today:\n\nWebsite: https://pomerdoge.com/\n\nTelegram Community: https://t.me/pomerdoge"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) recent gains, boosted by Greyscale\u2019s victory over the SEC, have been wiped out. Now, the coin hovers near a pivotal trendline. With Bitcoin dropping below $26,000, Ethereum\u2019s stability is in question. Without prompt bullish action, Ethereum could see a significant price dip. Will Ether price crash?\n\nFactors Influencing Ethereum\u2019s Price\n\nOn August 31st, the SEC delayed the approval of a Bitcoin ETF, leading to a sell-off in both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Earlier in the week, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust triumphed over the SEC in court. The SEC must now reevaluate Grayscale\u2019s application for a Bitcoin ETF. This victory boosted Bitcoin prices by 5% and other cryptocurrencies followed suit.\n\nEthereum or Bitcoin: Who Leads?\n\nEthereum might be on the path to outshine Bitcoin. The ETH/BTC chart hints at a breakout from its falling wedge pattern, usually a bullish sign. If Ethereum breaks out, it could outdo Bitcoin by a 10% margin. Presently, the ETH/BTC ratio is at 0.063. A surge could push this past the 0.07 mark, especially if the 200-day moving average is surpassed.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Will Ether Price Crash?\n\nExamining the ETH to USD ratio, Ethereum has been following an upward trend since June 2022. However, any decline below this trend could spell disaster for its price. If this happens, Ethereum could drop to the $1080 support line.\n\nAdditionally, patterns suggest an ascending triangle, often a bearish sign. If this pattern holds, Ethereum could plummet to $759, a 54% decrease from its current value.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

        "title": "ETH Broke Crucial Support, Here\u2019s the Next Target (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s recent market performance has seen an unexpected and sharp rejection from the $1.8K resistance level, triggering a significant downward trend that broke down both the pivotal 100-day and 200-day moving averages. This development is a clear, bearish signal for Ethereum\u2019s mid-term prospects.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nFollowing a notable drop from the critical $1.8K resistance zone, Ethereum\u2019s price dipped below the critical 100-day and 200-day moving averages, roughly around the $1.8K mark. Yet, the price ultimately found support at a significant level of $1.6K, initiating a bounce.\n\nThis support zone holds precise significance as it\u2019s also the 61.6% Fibonacci retracement level, corresponding to the recent impulsive upward move towards the $2.1K mark in early March.\n\nHowever, this initial rebound was followed by another impulsive downward movement, again touching the crucial support zone at $1.6K. While this price action does indicate a noticeable bearish sentiment in the market, it\u2019s essential to recognize that the potential revival of support could set the stage for another possible bullish bounce.\n\nSuch a rebound could potentially shift the market into a consolidation phase. Contrarily, if the price drops below the $1.6K mark, the possibility of a bearish cascade becomes increasingly likely.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nLooking at the 4-hour timeframe, it becomes evident that the downward trajectory was momentarily halted when Ethereum reached the substantial $1.6K support region. This indecision led to a brief consolidation phase marked by low volatility. However, the price experienced a sudden surge (the Grayscale pump), marked by the emergence of a substantial green candle.\n\nHowever, buying pressure weakened as the price ascended and approached the critical 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level, prompting a reversal. Consequently, the price embarked on another impulsive retracement, driving it back towards the $1.6K range. Furthermore, Ethereum has formed a bearish continuation flag pattern, and it is currently attempting to breach the lower boundary of this pattern.\n\nBecause the $1.6K threshold holds significant psychological importance, if sellers successfully push the price below this critical level, the market could potentially witness another quick and steep plummet toward lower price thresholds.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe current Ethereum price action showcases a robust downtrend, a notable exit from the weeks of consolidation within a narrow price range. To gain deeper insights into the market sentiment, examining futures market metrics is essential.\n\nThis particular chart shows the 30-day moving average of the taker buy-sell ratio metric, a key indicator revealing the relative aggressiveness of buyers versus sellers in executing their orders. When this metric records values above 1, it signifies a bullish sentiment, whereas values below 1 indicate a bearish sentiment prevailing in the market.\n\nThe chart illustrates the downward trajectory of the taker buy-sell ratio over the past few months. It consistently fluctuates below the pivotal one mark, reaching a yearly low. This behavior underscores the dominant bearish sentiment among futures traders participating in Ethereum\u2019s market.\n\nAs long as this prevailing trend remains unaltered, the probability of witnessing further bearish price movements remains high. For Ethereum\u2019s price to initiate a new rally, it would necessitate a shift in behavior among futures traders, specifically characterized by a more aggressive buying stance. This shift would be noticeable when the metric rises above the critical 1 threshold."

        "content": "With the advent of Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Bitcoin Spark, and Solana, there have been innovations in the space for generating passive income. We will explore how to mine Ethereum, examine the potential of Bitcoin Spark, and check the price prediction of Solana.\n\nGenerating Passive Income with Ethereum\n\nEthereum is one of the leading cryptocurrencies and also a platform for the creation of Decentralized apps and the automation of Smart contracts. One way to get passive income is through mining Ethereum.\n\nMining is a task that involves solving complex puzzles to validate transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. The reward for validating blocks in the Ethereum Blockchain is Ether (ETH), the native token of Ethereum. To start mining Ethereum, you will require specialized hardware known as mining rigs, which comprise potent graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nBitcoin Spark (BTCS) and the Potential for Passive Income\n\nBTCS employs a \u201cProof of Process\u201d method to ensure reward fairness. It\u2019s similar to performing a particular type of transaction check. Bitcoin Spark has garnered attention for its unique approach to generating passive income. And here\u2019s how you can generate passive income from Bitcoin Spark:\n\nYou can join the network by actively participating in the validation of transactions; you\u2019ll gradually earn rewards.\n\nBitcoin Spark also distributes a portion of its earnings to network participants. Being an active network member will generate a passive income without requiring constant involvement.\n\nAs Bitcoin Spark expands and introduces more features, your chances of earning passive income increase.\n\nSolana Price Prediction and Staking\n\nSolana gained massive growth and popularity due to its transaction speed and low transaction fees. One way to generate passive income from Solana is through Staking.\n\nStaking involves holding a certain amount of Solana token, SOL, in a wallet to support the network\u2019s operations. Stakes receive rewards in the form of additional SOL tokens.\n\nThe Solana price prediction has also piqued the interest of Investors and those looking to generate passive income in the crypto space. You should know that accurate price predictions are uncertain due to the market\u2019s volatility. Solana is all set for future growth. Its massive collaboration and integration of decentralized apps make it a solid one.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe crypto market is highly volatile, and it is crucial to practice risk management and only invest what you can afford to lose. The crypto market offers passive income opportunities from Mining Ethereum, exploring Bitcoin Spark, to Staking Solana.\n\nUse these links to stay updated on Bitcoin Sparks\u2019 uniqueness:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

        "content": "Solana (SOL) founder Anatoly Yakovenko has taken to the X social media platform, formerly known as Twitter to warn his community members against hurling hate statements and attacks on Ethereum (ETH). MakerDAO Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Rune Christensen had to also take the same action.\n\nMakerDAO CEO on Solana Blockchain\n\nIt all started after Christensen announced plans to re-implement MakerDAO on a new blockchain identified as NewChain. According to the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) giant, this blockchain could be forked from the Solana (SOL) blockchain. In effect, this would mean that MakerDAO will be moving away from the Ethereum-based architecture which it currently utilizes.\n\nadvertisement\n\nExplaining further, the MakerDAO CEO claimed that the Solana codebase is the \u201cmost promising\u201d to explore for NewChain due to its technical quality and optimization, resilience of the Solana ecosystem following the \u201cFTX blowup,\u201d and past examples of successful forks of the protocol, like the Pyth Network.\n\nIn response to this potential development, Yakovenko acknowledged that MakerDAO\u2019s move is impressive, citing that it is a win for open source. At the same time, he warned that it should not be perceived as an endorsement of one blockchain over the other.\n\n\u201cI really hope that people in the Solana community don\u2019t use this as some cudgel to attack Ethereum,\u201d Yakovenko said in a recent post. He even advocated for Ethereum noting that the protocol is \u201cawesome.\u201d\n\nEthereum is awesome. Solana wasn\u2019t built in a vacuum, and tons and tons of things that make @solana special were built based on ethereum\u2019s r&d. \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) September 3, 2023\n\nCrypto Leaders Advocate Collaborative Efforts\n\nUnlike the narrative that is being peddled by some community members, Christensen is confident that in the future, NewChain would serve as a bridge between Ethereum and Solana. He also shared that in the long run, this will provide \u201ca useful boost to the network effect of the entire multichain economy.\u201d\n\nHe went on to acknowledge Cosmos as a close alternative to the NewChain codebase.\n\nPaying close attention to Christensen\u2019s tweet, one would see that he was clearly appreciating multiple blockchains including Ethereum, Solana and Cosmos.\n\n\u201cAll chains are increasingly interconnected and synergize to form a global multichain network economy.\u201d\n\nHowever, enthusiastic community members seem to have taken him out of context and ultimately, it looks like crypto industry leaders are beginning to get more interested in collaborative technological advancements, rather than encourage rivalry."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nMakerDAO\u2019s controversial endgame inches closer.\n\nA multi-year Maker protocol overhaul, dubbed \"Endgame,\" is reaching its final phase, according to protocol co-founder Rune Christensen\u2014setting the stage for the resurgence of a timeless rivalry.\n\n\u201cThe last phase of Endgame is the launch of a native blockchain for Maker with the codename NewChain,\u201d tweeted Christensen late Friday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe crux of the controversy lies in the tweet\u2019s final words: \u201cAfter some research, I believe the Solana codebase should be considered as the basis for NewChain.\u201d\n\nOutlining three main reasons, Rune explained that it is due to the technical quality of the blockchain, as well as its resilience after the FTX blow up, and proven examples of Solana\u2019s codebase being forked for other successful projects.\n\nIf his preference comes to pass, it would mean that MakerDAO\u2014which up until now has lived on Ethereum\u2014will essentially migrate to a long-time rival.\n\nChristensen\u2019s endorsement of Solana sparked backlash on Crypto Twitter, with many users questioning the decision.\n\n\u201cFor your information,\u201d said one user, \u201cyour user base primarily has more allegiance to Ethereum,\u201d adding that Christensen \u201cshould probably give that more weight\u201d than he is.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum and Solana communities have been at each other's necks for years, with the latter\u2019s co-founder once appearing on CNBC to declare that \u201cEthereum is way too slow for peer-to-peer payments.\u201d\n\nThings have changed in 2023, however.\n\nAnatoly \u2018Toly\u2019 Yakovenko, Solana\u2019s co-founder, preemptively took to Twitter to stave off a possible attack from his own protocol's community.\n\nMaker considering @solana\u2019s tech is a win for open source, and has nothing to do with solana\u2019s mainnet or sol vs eth. I really hope that people in the @solana community don\u2019t use this as some cudgel to attack ethereum. \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) September 3, 2023\n\n\u201cMaker considering Solana\u2019s tech is a win for open source,\u201d he posted, adding that he \u201creally hope[s] that people in the community don\u2019t use this as some cudgel to attack Ethereum.\u201d\n\nYakovenko then went a step further and tweeted \u201cEthereum is awesome,\u201d and that a lot of Solana\u2019s tech stack was inspired by Ethereum\u2019s research and development. \u201cSolana wasn\u2019t built in a vacuum.\u201d\n\nSolana\u2019s co-founder pointed to proto-danksharding, an upcoming Ethereum upgrade that he considers \u201ca good design for a settlement layer.\u201d\n\nSome were quick to counter that he had \"gone soft\u201d on Ethereum. Another wrote, \"The mere utterance of Solana next to Maker is fascinating in itself. Excited to see their next steps.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToly\u2019s views were echoed by Matias Barrios, security researcher for Kudelski Security and a Solana programs auditor, who said he is surprised by the reaction of the Solana community. He claimed that he had not \u201cseen any mocking\u201d of Ethereum.\n\nAs he told Decrypt, \u201cChristensen\u2019s backing is an important validation [for Solana] coming from one of the strongest projects in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nBarrios said he agrees with Yakovenko\u2019s peace-keeping efforts, adding that \u201ctribalism is the worst we can do in innovation,\u201d and that \u201cEthereum and Solana are simply two different roads.\u201d\n\nNot to be sidelined by the possible reignition of rivalry, MakerDAO\u2019s Christensen also heeded Yakovenko\u2019s words of warning.\n\n\u201cEthereum is great, Solana is great. Cosmos is great,\u201d he posted on Saturday.\n\n\u201cAll chains are increasingly interconnected and synergize to form a global multi chain network economy,\u201d he wrote, concluding that \u201cTribalist incels (of every flavor) are in the wrong decade\u2014go back to Bitcoin and let the rest of us build.\""

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has made some intriguing financial moves, according to blockchain monitoring platform Spot On Chain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe famous Canadian programmer transferred 999 Ether ($1.63 million) between well-known Ethereum addresses 20 hours ago.\n\nThis transaction comes after a series of deposits and sales that have taken place over the past eight days, during which Buterin deposited 1,602 Ether ($2.68 million) to cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp and converted 100 Ether into 173,000 USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar.\n\nButerin's financial activity extends beyond Ethereum's native cryptocurrency. The data shows that he also liquidated 500 Maker (MKR) tokens, valued at around $580,000, for 353.4 Ether.\n\nThis marks the first time Buterin has sold Maker tokens in two years. After selling the MKR tokens, Buterin transferred all 350 Ether to another address. This string of transactions has led some to speculate on what Buterin might be planning.\n\nThe transactions come at a time when Ethereum is experiencing moderate price stability, trading at around $1,635 per Ether at the time of writing.\n\nSome community members view Buterin's moves as a regular activity given the size of his holdings. Still, others are keeping a cautious eye, pondering if this could be an indicator of future market moves.\n\nWithout specific information, it is difficult to determine the intention behind these moves. Whether these transactions are part of a larger investment strategy, a diversification effort, or simply routine financial management remains to be seen."

Grayscale seems to have hit all the right notes in its crypto symphony as it nears the launch of its spot Bitcoin ETF after winning the lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nIt might not come as a surprise as Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust Fund is among the top-rated crypto funds in the industry. Grayscale\u2019s $4.7 billion ETH holdings make Ethereum Trust Fund second-largest Ethereum Entity on the planet. The Ethereum price has slumped since Grayscale\u2019s investment causing a slight correction in the initial investment worth $5 billion dollars.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAlso Read: Breaking: Grayscale Wins US SEC Lawsuit On Spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nOther Information About Grayscale Ethereum Trust\n\nArkham scanned over 500 wallets and thoroughly checked all activity linked to Grayscale in order to identify the on-chain activity. Each wallet holds less than $30 million, as per the report. Grayscale also has nearly $1.7M worth of Link tokens in the Grayscale Chainlink Trust and $1.1M worth of UNI tokens.\n\nAccording to Arkham\u2019s report, Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin holdings are much less, amounting to about $92.1 million. However, according to Grayscale\u2019s official website, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, otherwise known as GBTC, manages over $16 billion worth of Bitcoin.\n\nWill Victory Against The SEC Improve Grayscales Holdings?\n\nGrayscale holds nearly $60 million in its Bitcoin Cash Trust and about $179 million in the Ethereum Classic Trust. The Grayscale Litecoin Trust is another massive fund with about $94.2 million. As the list goes on, these holdings are just the tip of the Iceberg in the Grayscale portfolio.\n\nConsidering Grayscale\u2019s victory against the SEC, it is bound for the Asset Management Firm to start accumulating more Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in its holdings.\n\nThe SEC still has 40 days to appeal the loss it faced against Grayscale in the Washington D.C court or move to the Supreme Court. However, till the SEC makes any move it is all speculation about how the major asset management firms will strategize their ETF applications.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin ETF: Here\u2019s Key Hurdle Ahead for Potential Grayscale ETF"

        "title": "What is Binance Coin (BNB) - DailyCoin",
        "content": "What is Binance Coin (BNB)? The native token of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange has certainly seen its fair share of FUD and euphoria, yet BNB coin has solidified itself as a staple of the blockchain industry.\n\nBNB stands out as more than just another digital asset in the bustling world of cryptocurrencies. It\u2019s the lifeblood of the Binance ecosystem, a powerhouse exchange that has carved out a significant niche in the crypto market.\n\nThe BNB Chain witnesses more daily traffic than its greatest rival, Ethereum (ETH). On top of that, the BNB chain is also faster and cheaper to use than the top Layer-1 blockchain. By the numbers, it looks better in every way.\n\nIs Binance Coin merely a glorified exchange token, or does it pose a legitimate threat to Ethereum\u2019s dominance? With regulatory vultures circling Changpeng Zhao and the Binance trading platform, is BNB Coin a crypto asset that needs to be taken with a grain of salt?\n\nWhat Is Binance Coin?\n\nBinance Coin, or BNB, is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance exchange, easily the largest and most influential trading platform in the crypto industry. Launched in 2017, BNB coin began its dramatic life on the Ethereum network as an ERC-20 token. As the Binance ecosystem exploded in scale, BNB transitioned and became the native currency of its own blockchain, the Binance Chain.\n\nBNB was introduced to the world through an initial coin offering (ICO), with a strict cap of 200 million tokens. The BNB whitepaper declared that token distribution would be allocated as follows:\n\n10% \u2013 Angel Investors.\n\n40% \u2013 Founding Team.\n\n50% \u2013 ICO Participants.\n\nBut BNB isn\u2019t just a token for trading on Binance. It has evolved into a multi-faceted altcoin with many uses within and beyond the Binance ecosystem. In a thriving and dynamic blockchain network, what is Binance Coin actually used for?\n\nWhat Can I Do with Binance Coin?\n\nBinance Coin is a versatile digital asset that reaches far beyond the confines of Binance.com. While BNB was introduced as a utility token for discounted trading fees, its functionality has significantly expanded over the years, making it a multi-purpose token with a wide array of applications.\n\nFor starters, BNB can be used to pay transaction fees on the Binance platform, including trading, withdrawal, and listing fees. The advantage is that users who pay with BNB often receive a discount, making transactions more cost-effective. Holding a qualifying amount of BNB also reduces traders\u2019 rates on their maker-and-taker trading fees.\n\nBut the use cases of BNB don\u2019t stop there. For instance, you can use BNB to book travel accommodations and flights, buy products online using the Binance credit card, and even hire freelancers for your business.\n\nBNB is the backbone of the ecosystem and is used to pay gas fees and secure the blockchain network. DeFi apps use BNB as a financial asset and store of value, giving users the power to earn through liquidity pools on sites like PancakeSwap, the top Binance DEX.\n\nIt can also be used to participate in token sales on the Binance Launchpad, allowing retail investors to buy new cryptocurrencies before they get listed on public markets. Moreover, BNB is also used in non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It can be used to purchase virtual gifts, process payments, and even donate to charity.\n\nAt this stage, the question isn\u2019t \u2018What is Binance Coin used for?\u2019 The question is what can\u2019t it be used for?\n\nThe BNB Chain\n\nThe BNB Chain, also known as Binance Smart Chain (BSC), is a significant innovation and arguably the biggest growth sector in the Binance ecosystem. It\u2019s a standalone blockchain that aims to make crypto onboarding as seamless as possible.\n\nThe BSC emerged in early 2021 as a threatening alternative to the Ethereum blockchain. While Layer 1 blockchains are a dime a dozen these days, that wasn\u2019t always the case. In the early days of DeFi, Ethereum was the only network that supported enough users to create an on-chain economy.\n\nAnyone who wanted to trade on a DEX, or loan crypto assets on decentralized lending platforms had to do so on Ethereum. In periods of network congestion, gas fees on Ethereum make the chain almost unusable. No one wants to spend a $50 gas fee on a $100 USD trade, so Binance unveiled a cheaper, faster, and more accessible blockchain network for the masses.\n\nOne of the standout features of BSC is its compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This means it supports all existing Ethereum tooling, making it easier for developers to build products and services on BNB Chain. It also allows for creating smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), opening up a world of possibilities for developers and users alike.\n\nHow Does BNB Chain Work?\n\nThe BNB Chain, or Binance Smart Chain (BSC), operates using a unique consensus mechanism known as Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA). This model combines elements of Proof of Authority (PoA) and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) to achieve a balance of speed, security, and decentralization.\n\nIn the PoSA model, blocks are produced by a limited set of validators. While other Layer-1 networks like Cardano (ADA) create new tokens to reward validators, BNB Chain collects network transaction fees from users and distributors them to node operators who secure the network.\n\nUnlike legacy networks like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum, the BNB Chain enjoys a much shorter block time. With a block time of around three seconds, BNB Chain can process transactions quickly, providing a smooth and efficient user experience. This is crucial for high-performance dApps that require fast and seamless transactions.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi) on BNB Chain\n\nDeFi on BSC encompasses a wide range of financial applications available to anyone with a crypto wallet. The key advantage of DeFi is that it expands the scope of financial services beyond traditional institutions, offering a more inclusive and open financial system.\n\nThe most popular DeFi application on BNB Chain is PancakeSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows users to swap BNB and other BEP-20 tokens directly from their wallets. PancakeSwap also offers yield farming and staking services, where users can earn rewards by providing liquidity to the platform.\n\nAnother notable DeFi platform on BSC is Venus Protocol, an algorithmic money market and synthetic stablecoin protocol. Venus allows users to earn interest on their cryptocurrencies, borrow against their crypto, and mint synthetic stablecoins like USDT.\n\nBNB Chain NFTs\n\nWhile DeFi on the BNB chain is alive and kicking, the network\u2019s NFT scene leaves much to be desired. Compared with other networks like Ethereum or Solana, BNB Chain struggles to attract significant NFT trading volume.\n\nThat being said, the blockchain network has fostered solid NFT collections and communities. The most iconic BNB Chain-based NFT collection is the Pancake Squad, a fun art-based NFT project of 10,000 3D bunnies.\n\nBNB Burn\n\nTo drive token scarcity and maintain the long-term value of BNB, Binance implemented a unique burn mechanism. Binance periodically burns BNB coins from circulation, reducing the total supply of BNB.\n\nBinance conducts these burns every quarter, using a portion of its profits to buy back BNB from the open market and then permanently destroying or \u201cburning\u201d them. The amount of BNB that gets burned is based on the trading volume on the Binance exchange during the previous financial quarter.\n\nSince the inception of Binance Coin, several burns have already taken place, each time reducing the total supply of BNB. The last recorded burn removed over 2M BNB tokens from circulation, valued at over $600M USD.\n\nBNB Coin History\n\nBinance Coin\u2019s journey began in 2017 when it was introduced through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), a popular fundraising mechanism in the crypto industry. During the ICO, 100 million BNB tokens were sold to the public, raising approximately $15 million for Binance.\n\nInitially, BNB was an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. However, in 2019, Binance launched its blockchain, the Binance Chain, and BNB was migrated to this new chain to become its native asset. This was a significant milestone in BNB\u2019s history, as it marked the coin\u2019s evolution from a utility token for the Binance exchange to a standalone cryptocurrency with its own blockchain.\n\nSince then, BNB has grown exponentially, both in terms of value and utility. This is mostly due to the adoption of the BNB Chain. DeFi exploded on the network in early 2021, which drove BNB\u2019s price from $40 to its all-time high of $690 in months.\n\nHowever, like all cryptocurrencies, Binance Coin is not without its concerns.\n\nBinance Coin Concerns\n\nWhile BNB has seen significant growth and success, it\u2019s not without its potential concerns. These primarily revolve around regulatory issues with the Binance exchange and questions about the centralization of the BNB Chain.\n\nBinance Exchange Regulatory Woes\n\nBinance has faced significant regulatory scrutiny in various jurisdictions around the globe. In most cases, these issues stem from concerns about compliance with financial regulations, consumer protection, and anti-money laundering (AML) measures.\n\nRegulators in several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan, have issued warnings or taken actions against Binance. The concerns these regulators raise often revolve around Binance operating without the necessary licenses or failing to implement adequate measures to protect consumers and prevent illicit activities.\n\nFor instance, in the United Kingdom, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a warning in June 2021 stating that Binance Markets Limited was prohibited from undertaking any regulated activity in the country. In the United States, Binance has been investigated by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for potential violations of AML and tax regulations.\n\nMore recently, Gary Gensler and the SEC launched another attack on the Binance exchange, claiming that they are operating as an unlicensed securities exchange. These regulatory challenges pose a significant risk to Binance and, by extension, BNB. If Binance were to face severe penalties or restrictions, it could impact the utility and value of BNB.\n\nBNB Chain Centralization\n\nWhile the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) has brought many benefits to BNB and its users, it has also raised concerns about centralization. This is because Binance, the entity behind BSC, is a centralized organization with significant control over the network.\n\nIn a truly decentralized network, no single entity controls the entire system. This is one of the fundamental principles of blockchain technology and the very ethos of cryptocurrency. However, in the case of BSC, Binance has significant influence over the network\u2019s operation and development.\n\nFor instance, Binance selects the validators for the BSC network. While this process is based on a staking model, the fact that Binance has the final say in validator selection has led to concerns about centralization. This is in contrast to networks like Ethereum, where anyone can become a validator or miner.\n\nBinance Coin Pros and Cons\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages, shaped by its unique features, the Binance ecosystem, and the broader crypto market dynamics. Let\u2019s delve into the pros and cons to gain a balanced perspective on this prominent cryptocurrency.\n\nPros\n\nVersatility \u2013 BNB is a multi-purpose token with many uses within and beyond the Binance ecosystem. It can be used for trading, participating in token sales, paying discounted transaction fees, and even making purchases in the real world.\n\n\u2013 BNB is a multi-purpose token with many uses within and beyond the Binance ecosystem.

Like Bitcoin and Ethereum, it\u2019s important to understand what BNB coin is and how it works to navigate the crypto market effectively.\n\nFAQs"

He emphasized that \"All chains are increasingly interconnected and synergize to form a global multichain network economy.\"\n\nAccording to Christensen, those clinging to tribalistic attitudes are \"in the wrong decade\" and should allow others to build on the foundations set by various blockchain technologies.\n\nThe tweets suggest a maturing stance among industry leaders, who appear more interested in shared technological progress than in fanning the flames of blockchain rivalry."

        "title": "Monero A PrivacyFirst Cryptocurrency Setting Itself Apart from Bitcoin and Ethereum - CryptoCoin.News",
        "content": ".\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in cryptocurrencies, you\u2019ve probably heard of Bitcoin and Ethereum. These two digital currencies have taken the world by storm and gained immense popularity. However, while Bitcoin and Ethereum focus on decentralization and security, there is another cryptocurrency that stands apart due to its unique emphasis on privacy and confidentiality \u2013 Monero (XMR). In this article, we\u2019ll explore how Monero works, its history and evolution, key features, and how it compares to Bitcoin and Ethereum. We\u2019ll also discuss how to buy and mine Monero, and whether it is a good investment.\n\nHow does Monero (XMR) work?\n\nWhat sets Monero apart from other cryptocurrencies is its privacy-enhancing technologies. Monero ensures the anonymity of its users through features like ring signatures, stealth addresses, and confidential transactions. Every user on the Monero network is anonymous by default, obscuring details about the sender, receiver, and transaction amount. This focus on privacy has made Monero a popular choice for individuals who value confidentiality and anonymity in their financial transactions. However, it has also raised concerns among some governments and resulted in bans and delistings on certain cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nMonero\u2019s Privacy-Enhancing Technologies\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the privacy-enhancing technologies that Monero utilizes:\n\nRingCT (Confidential transactions)\n\nMonero combines multiple transactions into a \u201cring,\u201d making it difficult to determine the exact amount being sent. This enhances privacy by hiding individual transaction details within a larger group of transactions.\n\nRing Signatures\n\nBy employing ring signatures, Monero obscures the sender\u2019s identity by including them in a group, or \u201cring,\u201d of possible senders. This makes it virtually impossible to determine which specific user sent the transaction.\n\nStealth Addresses\n\nStealth addresses protect the privacy of both senders and recipients. Each transaction generates a one-time address, making it challenging to link multiple transactions to the same recipient.\n\nBulletproofs\n\nMonero utilizes bulletproofs, a form of zero-knowledge proof, to reduce the size of confidential transactions. This helps improve scalability and reduce transaction fees on the Monero network.\n\nP2Pool\n\nMonero promotes decentralization and prevents the concentration of mining power through P2Pool. This decentralized mining pool allows miners to pool their resources and mine XMR together.\n\nRandomX\n\nThe RandomX algorithm is optimized for central processing units (CPUs) and enhances the network\u2019s security while preventing ASIC mining. This makes mining Monero more accessible to individuals using CPUs and general processing units.\n\nSmart Mining\n\nSmart mining is a less intrusive and energy-efficient way of mining Monero. It allows individuals to mine XMR using their computer\u2019s unused processing power without causing drawbacks like overheating or draining the battery.\n\nMonero\u2019s History and Evolution\n\nMonero\u2019s roots can be traced back to Bytecoin, the first digital currency to utilize CryptoNote technology. While Bytecoin did not attain widespread success, it laid the foundation for the development of several privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, including Monero. Monero, initially known as Bitmonero, was created by seven developers from the Bytecoin project. Since its inception in 2014, Monero has evolved and undergone various upgrades to enhance its privacy, security, and efficiency. Notable milestones include the introduction of bulletproofs, atomic swaps with Bitcoin, and ongoing research and development by the Monero Research Labs (MRL) team.\n\nKey Features of Monero\n\nMonero offers several key features that make it stand out in the world of cryptocurrencies:\n\nPrivacy: Monero prioritizes user anonymity and confidentiality by default, making it one of the most privacy-centric cryptocurrencies available.\n\nMonero prioritizes user anonymity and confidentiality by default, making it one of the most privacy-centric cryptocurrencies available.

Decentralization: Monero promotes decentralization through features like P2Pool, which allows miners to collaborate and prevent the concentration of mining power. This helps ensure a more resilient and distributed network.\n\nMonero vs. Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum are well-known cryptocurrencies, Monero differentiates itself through its privacy-centric approach. Bitcoin transactions, though pseudonymous, can still be traced on the blockchain, whereas Monero transactions are highly challenging to trace. Ethereum, on the other hand, focuses on decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. Monero\u2019s primary use case revolves around anonymous payments, making it a popular choice for those who prioritize financial privacy. Additionally, Monero\u2019s blockchain is more agile and scalable than Bitcoin\u2019s, thanks to its unique privacy-enhancing technologies.\n\nHow to Buy Monero\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in buying Monero, there are various options available. XMR is listed on many decentralized money markets and cryptocurrency exchanges. However, it\u2019s important to note that regulatory pressure has led to delistings in certain regions. Peer-to-peer (P2P) trading platforms, such as LocalMonero, provide direct connections between buyers and sellers looking to exchange Monero for fiat currencies or other cryptocurrencies. To transact Monero, you\u2019ll need a Monero wallet and address, which should be protected with a seed phrase.\n\nHow to Mine Monero\n\nMining Monero involves utilizing the RandomX proof-of-work algorithm, which is optimized for general-purpose CPUs. While both CPUs and GPUs can mine Monero, CPUs tend to be more efficient. Solo mining can be done through either the command line interface or graphical user interface wallets. For those who prefer mining in a pool or solo mining with a GPU or dedicated hardware, software such as lXMRig and CSminer is required. By launching the mining software, your device\u2019s processing power is utilized to solve complex mathematical puzzles, validate transactions, and reward you with XMR coins.\n\nIs Monero a Good Investment?\n\nMonero has garnered a reputation as a beacon of privacy and payment enablement among cryptocurrencies. Its growth and development depend on the contributions of developers, miners, and users convinced of Monero\u2019s potential. Over the years, Monero has exhibited positive coin value, market cap growth, and protocol development. However, it\u2019s essential to remember that cryptocurrencies, including Monero, can be volatile, and their value can fluctuate rapidly. Investing in Monero or any other cryptocurrency should be based on careful research, analysis of blockchains and market trends, and personal risk tolerance.\n\nIn conclusion, Monero\u2019s focus on privacy and confidentiality sets it apart from other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Its privacy-enhancing technologies, commitment to security, and emphasis on decentralization make it a compelling option for individuals seeking privacy in their financial transactions. Whether you\u2019re interested in buying Monero, mining it, or considering it as an investment, it\u2019s important to understand its unique features, history, and potential."

        "content": "NFT sales volume for Ethereum and Polygon-minted NFTs fell to new lows in August.\n\nDue to dropping interest, NFTs sales count plunged as well.\n\nThe monthly sales volume of Ethereum [ETH] and Polygon [MATIC]-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on leading marketplace OpenSea plummeted to new lows in August, data from Dune Analytics revealed.\n\nInformation from the on-chain data provider revealed that the monthly sales of Ethereum-minted NFTs on the marketplace reached an impressive peak of $659.02 million in February before experiencing a subsequent downturn.\n\nAt the end of August, the sales volume for this category of NFTs on OpenSea totaled $106.12 million, marking its lowest monthly volume since May 2021. This also represented an 84% fall from its February peak.\n\nSimilarly, following a record-breaking NFT sales volume of $109.12 million in February, Polygon-based NFTs on OpenSea since received decreased patronage from OpenSea\u2019s users. The total sales volume in August was $7.02 million, marking a 94% decline in sales since February.\n\nWhat caused this decline?\n\nThe steady decline of sales volume for both Ethereum and Polygon NFTs on the marketplace was a result of waning interest in profile picture NFTs (PFPs) and OpenSea\u2019s loss of market share to Blur.\n\nOn-chain data revealed that the market capitalization of top PFP NFT projects peaked at $5 billion in February 2023. As the overall NFT market declined, interest in this asset category waned, and the market capitalization is now $2.2 billion, down by over 50% from its peak.\n\nThe USD market cap of these top PFP projects peaked at $5b this year. It's now $2.2b, down 56% ($2.8b) from the Feb peak. pic.twitter.com/6aaUvyXTT0 \u2014 NFTstats.eth (@punk9059) August 29, 2023\n\nAlso, since its launch in October 2022, Blur, an NFT marketplace and aggregator, has gained significant traction, overtaking industry leader OpenSea. According to data tracked by DappRadar, of all NFT marketplaces, Blur recorded the highest sales volume of $222 million in the last month.\n\nThis occurred despite a 34% decline in month-over-month (MoM) sales. OpenSea, which saw a 45% uptick cross-board within the same period, trailed behind the NFT aggregator, data from DappRadar revealed.\n\nIn addition to a decline in sales volume, the number of traders who completed transactions involving Ethereum and Polygon-based collectibles on OpenSea in August also declined.\n\nRegarding Ethereum-minted NFTs on the marketplace, 244,907 NFTs were sold in April. This was an 11% decline from the 273,709 total NFTs sold in the month before and a 79% fall from the 1.14 million NFTs sold at the beginning of the year.\n\nAs for Polygon NFTs on OpenSea, sales plummeted by 37% to reach its lowest in nine months"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nLiquid staking solution Lido Finance now accounts for about a third of all staked Ethereum (ETH), and that is making some community members worry. The increasing clout of Lido, they say, is undercutting the decentralized character of Ethereum as a whole.\n\n\"Lido may be the biggest attack on Ethereum's decentralization ('credible neutrality') in our entire history,\" said Evan Van Ness, an Ethereum developer, in a Twitter post on Friday.\n\nIn the last year, the amount of ETH staked has risen nearly 95% from just over $22 billion to about $41.6 billion, according to Dune Analytics. Of this amount, Lido accounts for 32.7% of all staked ETH on the market\u2014nearly four times higher than the amount staked by runner-up Coinbase at 8.7%.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLido may be the biggest attack on Ethereum's decentralization (\"credible neutrality\") in our entire history It's about to breach 33% Yet many are staying silent Why? pic.twitter.com/O7Y37FZrE0 \u2014 Evan Van Ness \ud83e\uddc9\ud83d\udcb8 (@evan_van_ness) September 1, 2023\n\nEthereum is designed as a platform for decentralized applications run on smart contracts, and it undergirds many of the ecosystems and tokens in the DeFi ecosystem. In this space, Lido is the leading decentralized platform for liquid staking ETH, allowing investors to stake ETH with the network\u2019s validators and earn rewards. In exchange for doing so, they receive a token representation of their deposit called stETH.\n\nBut as it grows in size, critics caution that Lido and other liquid staking solutions could be amassing undue influence over Ethereum, and risk becoming overly centralized in how their decentralized autonomous organizations govern themselves. This could undercut what they characterize as the democratic ideal in the DeFi space, where users can use their tokens to vote on the direction of projects there.\n\nIndeed, some have posited that all liquid staking derivatives \"have inherent issues\" that, without well-designed controls, \"can ultimately destroy their product.\"\n\nEthereum investor Ryan Berckman also warned that Lido\u2019s growing centralization could harm its acceptance reputation among corporations and governments, undercutting any hope of becoming a global settlement layer in the financial system.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a Twitter post on Friday, Berckman said that Lido \"uniquely threatens\" Ethereum's reputation as a decentralized chain through its \"uncapped dominance\" and that this can also come at the cost of cutting ETH's long-term valuation. Berckman suggests that these goals would be knee-capped if this issue is left unaddressed.\n\n\"If this were to happen, it may affect the order of magnitude of our growth rate and, therefore, Ethereum's benefit to humanity and the number of zeroes on the long-term ETH valuation,\" wrote Berckman.\n\nLido has taken steps that aim to keep its DAO more democratic. In a July interview with Decrypt, LidoDAO\u2019s business development contributor Marin Tvrdi\u0107 said Lido is exploring a \"dual governance\" model that would allow holders of sETH veto power over governance proposals approved by holders of Lido's LDO governance token.\n\nThe current governance system for Lido is based on LDO, which means that only LDO holders can vote on proposals. Naturally, this gives LDO holders a degree of power over the protocol that stETH holders don\u2019t have. This can have consequences if, for instance, LDO holders move to change something that could negatively impact liquid stakers.\n\nLido's DAO token is currently the 36th most traded token with a market capitalization of just over $1.35 billion, according to data from CoinGecko. In comparison, its sETH is the seventh most-widely traded token with a market cap of about $14 billion.\n\nEditor's note: this article was updated to properly identify Evan Van Ness."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) price has lost all of its weekly gains that it made after Greyscale\u2019s court win against the SEC. The native asset of the leading smart contract platform is trading close to a very critical trendline. If bulls don\u2019t step in soon, bears may target a massive downside in the coming months.\n\nOn Friday, Bitcoin price fell below $26,000 once again. The pioneering cryptocurrency fully retraced its Tuesday pump, which pushed it above $28,000. The weakness in BTC has also affected the ETH price, which fell 3.5% on Thursday. On Friday, the price remained in a consolidation.\n\nWhy Is ETH Price Falling?\n\nOn 31st August, the SEC postponed the approval of spot Bitcoin ETF, pushing it to the next deadline. This triggered a sell-off in Bitcoin and Ethereum. The prices of both cryptocurrencies hit a fresh weekly low. Earlier this week, Greyscale Bitcoin Trust won its lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe court ruled that the SEC must reconsider Grayscale Investments\u2019 application to launch the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The decision was a major victory for Grayscale and the crypto industry, and it sent shockwaves through the markets.\n\nBitcoin prices surged by more than 5% in the hours following the ruling, and other cryptocurrencies also saw gains. The news was seen as a positive sign for the future of the crypto industry, and it raised hopes that a Bitcoin ETF could be approved in the near future.\n\nEthereum To Outperform Bitcoin?\n\nThe following ETH/BTC chart shows that the pair is attempting to break out of the falling wedge pattern. Falling wedge breakouts tend to be extremely bullish and act as a great reversal pattern. Ethereum price may outperform Bitcoin in case of a breakout by 10%.\n\nAt the time of writing, the pair sits at 0.063. A breakout from the trendline can send the pair above the 0.07 level, which is the next major resistance level after the reclaim of the 200-day moving average. Many traders exchange their BTC to ETH when this pair flips bullish.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction Hangs By A Thread\n\nA look at the ETH to USD pair reveals that the pair has been respecting an upward trendline since its June 2022 bottom. A breakdown below this trendline would be cataclysmic for Ethereum price prediction. In case of a breakdown, the first bearish target would be the $1080 support level.\n\nA higher timeframe analysis also shows a formation of the ascending triangle pattern. These patterns usually break to the downside. The technical price target in case of an ascending triangle breakdown is $759, which is 54% below the current price level.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

But for a specialized backend for Maker\u2019s specific needs it is not ideal, and solutions like Solana or something like Sei are a much better fit. \u2014 Rune (@RuneKek) September 1, 2023\n\nNewChain will be a backend for the project\u2019s SubDAO tokenomics and governance security. On the other side, its governance token Maker (MKR) and stablecoin Dai (DAI) will continue functioning as usual on Ethereum.\n\nMagazine: Recursive inscriptions \u2014 Bitcoin \u2018supercomputer\u2019 and BTC DeFi coming soon"

        "title": "Highlights Of The Ethereum Nigeria Meetup In Lagos - Tech Build Africa",
        "content": "The Ethereum Nigeria community continued its Ethereum Road Show Workshop for the year 2023 across 4 cities as the journey kicked off in Abuja in mid-August with the theme, \u201cBlockchain Security 101\u201d.\n\nThe journey continued on Tuesday, August 29 at the NITDA IT Hub, University of Lagos, for ETH Lagos Workshop, where blockchain enthusiasts and experts gathered. The theme of the Lagos RoadShow Workshop was, \u201cLayer2: Scaling Ethereum\u201d.\n\nOpening the meetup, Enoch Mbaebie Ethereum Nigeria Lead, commented that Ethereum Nigeria will help to position Nigeria as a hub for blockchain and innovation in Africa.\n\n\u201cOur key objectives include awareness and developers\u2019 engagement, we come up with a series of boot camp and hackathon which comes with prizes that seek to unleash the potential in the blockchain ecosystem. We spun off the Filecoin conference in 2022, and we are poised to do the same with the Ethereum ecosystem as well.\n\nWe are into the innovation of products, and collaboration, and are open to advocacy and policy. The Ethereum Nigeria community also participated in the epic crossover from the proof-work to proof-of-stake network that happened globally.\u201d\n\nAccording to Enoch, the Road Show continues in Anambra and Port Harcourt on the 17th and 23rd of September respectively.\n\nSpeaking on \u201cTransition to Web3 Development\u201d, Musa Mukhtar, a blockchain developer described the evolution from Web1 to Web2 through to Web3.\n\nAs explained by him, the Web3 phase provides decentralization which makes you own your data, unlike Web2 which is subjected to centralization.\n\nThe challenge of centralization according to him is the inability to own and control your data, thus having a high tendency to lose it, once any centralized system decides to shut down.\n\nAnother challenge is the unauthorized selling of users\u2019 data by these centralized platforms.\n\nHowever, with Web3 this challenge is solved, giving ownership and control to users. And one of the ways of having control is the payment system that a decentralized web offers.\n\nAs explained by Musa, the Web3 payment system is powered by blockchain technology which is faster and safer compared to payment over the Web2 system. \u201cDecentralization is the advantage of blockchain-powered payment system and that\u2019s why it is secure\u201d\n\nExplaining the Web3 development ecosystem, Musa noted that Web3 developers build applications on the blockchain system and it is required that they have frontend skills which involves them learning HTML, CSS and Javascript, in addition to acquiring knowledge about frameworks like React.\n\nMusa advised anyone going into Web3 development should start with the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity.\n\nIn all this, Musa reiterated the power of the community when building a blockchain product, according to him, the community is important as the product in the Web3 space.\n\nAlso speaking at the meetup, Oluwasegun Abisagbo, software engineer and founder of Passportmonie discussed,\u201d Leveraging Layer 2 Scaling for Cross-Border Payments: Enhancing Efficiency and Accessibility\u201d.\n\nIn his opening statements, he touched on the challenges and inefficiencies associated with traditional cross-border payment which include, high fees, slow processing times, limited accessibility and non-interoperability of African currencies.\n\nAccording to Oluwasegun, the layer 2 scaling will accelerate global payments as it will drive faster and more cost-effective transactions.\n\nAs explained by him, Passportmonie leverages layer 2 scaling solutions to enhance the cross-border payment experience for its users.\n\nLayer 2 scaling solutions represent a significant step forward in revolutionizing cross-border payments, enabling companies to offer efficient, low-cost, and accessible financial services to a global user base.\n\nOluwasegun noted the efforts of the Ethereum ecosystem to drive innovation in layer 2 scaling solutions.\n\n\u201cWe believe in partnerships and collaborations to make cross-border payments easy across Africa\u201d, he concluded.\n\nAlso present at the meetup was Team Next Billion of the Ethereum Foundation. The team go around the globe scouting for enablers and blockers of Ethereum\u2019s next billion users by seeking use cases, contexts, and communities that indicate how Ethereum might become a tool of and for the next billion.\n\nWhile discussing with Enoch, they expressed their excitement about the organization of the Lagos meetup and reiterated the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s support for the Ethereum Nigeria community.\n\nDuring the course of the meetup, there was a breakout session that involved the participants being grouped into different clusters.\n\nAccording to Enoch, the purpose of the clusters is to create different teams that will start representing the Ethereum Nigeria developers community within and outside the country.\n\nEnoch tasked the cluster groups with coming up with creating innovative projects moving forward and assured them of full support from the global Ethereum network.\n\nDon\u2019t miss important articles during the week.

        "content": "In a revealing analysis, crypto data platform Arkham Intelligence identified Grayscale Ethereum Trust as the world\u2019s second-largest holder of Ether (ETH), with nearly $5 billion in assets.\n\nOver 500 wallet addresses linked to Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust\n\nArkham Intelligence utilized on-chain analysis to identify over 500 wallet addresses associated with Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust. Interestingly, none of these wallets held more than $30 million in assets, a factor that Arkham noted made the identification process challenging. The data platform was able to pinpoint these addresses by scrutinizing transactional activity and cross-referencing it with Grayscale\u2019s publicly reported balances. In total, Grayscale holds close to 3 billion ETH, solidifying its position as a major player in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nBreaking: Arkham has identified the Grayscale Ethereum Trust on chain.\n\n\n\nIt is now the second largest ETH entity globally with $5B in ETH.\n\n\n\nThis had not been previously reported or publicly identified. pic.twitter.com/MQqKT6E9v6 \u2014 Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) September 1, 2023\n\nGrayscale\u2019s role in bridging crypto and traditional finance\n\nLaunched in December 2017, Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) serves as a bridge between the cryptocurrency market and traditional finance. The trust allows investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without the need to buy, store, or directly access the digital asset. This innovative financial product has positioned Grayscale as a leading entity that connects the crypto market with traditional financial systems. The company also recently gained approval for its Bitcoin Trust ETF, further cementing its role as a pioneer in digital currency investment products.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust not only holds a significant amount of Ether but also plays a crucial role in introducing cryptocurrency to traditional financial markets. The trust\u2019s structure, which eliminates the need for direct asset handling, makes it an attractive investment vehicle for those unfamiliar with the complexities of cryptocurrency management. As Grayscale continues to expand its range of digital currency investment products, it is likely to attract even more attention from both individual and institutional investors, especially given its recent legal victory against the SEC over its Bitcoin Trust ETF."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Crypto in an Interesting Pattern - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "The Ethereum price prediction underscores the critical juncture at which ETH cryptocurrency currently finds itself, operating within a pivotal make-or-break scenario contained within an intriguing symmetrical triangle pattern. Ethereum has remained confined within this symmetrical triangle pattern, repeatedly attempting to break out but facing failure on multiple occasions. As of now, Ethereum\u2019s price is navigating a crucial crossroads, approaching the lower trendline of the symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily time frame chart.\n\nThis presents a pivotal moment for Ethereum, as the decision it makes in this situation will likely dictate the direction of its future price movements. Traders and investors are keenly observing this pattern to determine whether Ethereum will break out of its constraints and embark on a significant price trajectory or continue to trade within the confines of the symmetrical triangle. The outcome of this make-or-break scenario will be instrumental in shaping Ethereum\u2019s short-term and potentially long-term performance.\n\nEthereum price was at $1635.81 and lost 0.06% of its market capitalization during the day\u2019s trading session. Trading volume has decreased by 53.48% during the intraday trading session. This demonstrates that sellers are trying for a pullback of ETH, the second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. The volume to market cap ratio was 1.40%.\n\nAnalyzing Technical Indications For Ethereum Price\n\nSource: ETH/USD by TradingView\n\nEthereum price forecast shows the struggle of ETH crypto in breaking out from the symmetrical triangle pattern over the daily time frame chart. Meanwhile, Ethereum cryptocurrency needs to accumulate buyers in order to register its breakout. However, volume change can be seen below average and needs to grow during the day\u2019s trading session. Nevertheless, ETH crypto has slipped below the 20, 50, 100, and 200-day daily moving average.\n\nIn order for ETH cryptocurrency to break out of its consolidation phase within the symmetrical triangle pattern and reach a recovery level of $1820, it needs to attract potential buyers. Notably, ETH crypto saw a modest decrease of 0.63% in the past week but also experienced a more substantial decline of approximately 10.82% over the past month.\n\nZooming out to a longer timeframe, Ethereum cryptocurrency has faced a notable setback, with a decline of 13.46% over the last three months, although it has managed a noteworthy upturn of 4.47% within the past six months. Furthermore, in the current year, ETH\u2019s price has showcased a remarkable recovery, surging by around 36.86%. This highlights the significant progress the cryptocurrency has made on its path to recovery throughout 2023.\n\nTaking into account technical indicators, ETH cryptocurrency faces hurdles as it approaches the lower trendline. The relative strength index suggests that ETH crypto is presently consolidating at its current level. Moreover, the moving average convergence divergence indicates a downward trend in the price of ETH.\n\nThe RSI stands at 36 and maintains a stable position, signifying a neutral position below the neutral threshold. Additionally, the MACD line currently overlaps with the signal line, awaiting the potential occurrence of a crossover. Consequently, investors engaged in ETH cryptocurrency should practice patience and closely monitor the daily chart for any significant shifts in direction.\n\nSummary\n\nThe Ethereum price prediction underscores the critical juncture at which ETH cryptocurrency currently finds itself, operating within a pivotal make-or-break scenario contained within an intriguing symmetrical triangle pattern. However, volume change can be seen below average and needs to grow during the day\u2019s trading session. Taking into account technical indicators, ETH cryptocurrency faces hurdles as it approaches the lower trendline.\n\nTechnical Levels\n\nSupport Levels: $1620.95 and $1600.00\n\nResistance Levels: $1655.00 and $1675.00\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views and opinions stated by the author, or any people named in this article, are for informational purposes only, and they do not establish financial, investment, or other advice.

        "content": "The ethOS smartphone, based on the Google Pixel 7a, sold out its first 50 units within 24 hours.\n\nEthOS NFTs, required to reserve a phone, are trading on OpenSea for nearly $5,000, a 10x markup compared to the base model of Google Pixel 7a.\n\nIf you were waiting to get your hands on the ethOS phone, you might be too late. The revolutionary Ethereum-based smartphone has sold out its first 50 units within 24 hours of going on pre-sale, marking a meteoric rise in demand for this next-gen device. Via X, @EthereumPhone recently tweeted:\n\nGM. ethOS phone pre-orders have arrived! Are you ready for the first physical phone with ethOS pre-installed? pic.twitter.com/4V6ZFZO93t \u2014 ethOS (@EthereumPhone) August 22, 2023\n\nMore Than Just an OS: An Ethereal Experience\n\nThe phone isn\u2019t just a regular smartphone; it\u2019s an entire Ethereum ecosystem in your pocket. Built on the Google Pixel 7a, the device comes loaded with ethOS\u2014an open-source operating system deeply integrated with Ethereum. Beyond its catchy name that signifies both the Ethereum Operating System and \u201ccharacter\u201d in Greek, ethOS supports a built-in Ethereum light client. This makes your phone a \u2018light node\u2019 in the Ethereum network, capable of independently validating blocks.\n\nPayment and Communication: Simplified and Streamlined\n\nThis is not just another gadget but a powerful tool that simplifies your interaction with the Ethereum blockchain. EthOS comes with an array of built-in utilities that handle payments, send and receive messages, and more. It also integrates with Ethereum Name Services (ENS) for easier payment processes, as well as supporting Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVM) and Layer 2 scaling networks.\n\nUnlocking the EthOS Experience Through NFTs\n\nBut how does one get their hands on such a groundbreaking device? Well, here\u2019s the kicker. In order to qualify for purchasing one of these 50 ethOS smartphones, you needed to acquire an ethOS Non-Fungible Token (NFT). These NFTs then could be burned to reserve the smartphone. These ethOS NFTs have already made a splash in the market, trading on OpenSea for as much as three Ethereum, roughly equivalent to nearly $5,000. This stands in stark contrast to the Google Pixel 7a\u2019s market price of $499.\n\nThe Web3 Arena: EthOS vs. Solana\n\nWhile ethOS steals the limelight, its competitor, the Solana (SOL) smartphone, has had a humbler reception. According to Flipside records, a mere 2,000 units of the Solana smartphone have been sold since its release. In an attempt to catalyze sales, Solana Labs slashed the price from $1,000 to $599, particularly after the ethOS smartphone made its grand entrance, set to premiere this fall.\n\nSo there you have it. As the Ethereum community celebrates this monumental achievement, the world watches with eager eyes for what\u2019s next in this cutting-edge space."
