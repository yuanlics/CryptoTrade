        "title": "Introducing Base: Coinbase's Solution to Scaling Ethereum \u2013 Global X ETFs - Global X",
        "content": "While Ethereum is the leading public smart contract blockchain, its widespread popularity, transaction limitations, and variable demand levels can lead to network congestion and increased costs. These high costs often render small transactions impractical and pose obstacles to developing new use cases. For Ethereum to become a globally adopted data settlement platform, there is a growing need for solutions that can enhance transaction speed and reduce costs without compromising the network\u2019s security.\n\nLayer 2 (L2) networks such as Base offer pathways to ease the computational burden on the Ethereum network. Developed by Coinbase, one of the largest offchain cryptoasset exchanges globally, Base is built for speed, affordability, and user-friendliness. In this blog post, we explore the successful early adoption of Base following its launch in July 2023 and how it is contributing to Ethereum\u2019s growth.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nBase aims to scale Ethereum by expanding its reach and providing a more efficient, affordable, and user-friendly experience.\n\nFueled by Coinbase\u2019s strong brand, L2 technology adoption, and Base\u2019s considerably lower transaction costs compared to Ethereum, adoption has happened quickly as Base has onboarded 100,000 daily active users faster than any other L2 network. 1\n\nBase represents a strong show of commitment to Ethereum by Coinbase and positions the exchange to benefit from the growth of Ethereum\u2019s onchain ecosystem.\n\nBase Unveils New Avenues That Expand the Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nImagine Ethereum as a bustling boulevard replete with businesses of all types. Potential patrons of these businesses visit the boulevard in their cars but find themselves stuck in traffic due to inadequate infrastructure to handle the influx of vehicles. Meanwhile, a new train system running parallel to, but seamlessly integrated with the main boulevard makes its debut, providing a swift and cost-effective means of transport for these travelers, and a means of alleviating some of the road traffic.\n\nNow, instead of travelers sitting in traffic and paying high tolls, the train works to spread the cost out among a larger group of people, with individuals paying only a minimal fee for the convenience of boarding and disembarking at a station of their choice. This system not only alleviates traffic congestion but also enhances affordability, thereby improving the overall ecosystem\u2019s efficiency and expanding the available navigation space.\n\nJust like trains help to alleviate traffic on the boulevard, L2s play a crucial role in alleviating network congestion on Ethereum. They work by shifting the execution of transactions away from the Ethereum chain and onto adjacent networks. Periodically, they consolidate these transactions into a single cryptographic proof and post the proof to Ethereum as a single transaction. This innovative approach not only ensures that activity on L2 networks inherit the security assurances of Ethereum, but also expands the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s transactional throughput while reducing average user costs.\n\nIn this context, Base is one of a growing number of L2 networks that extends the surface area of Ethereum and embraces ether (ETH) as the denominating currency within the ecosystem. What sets Base apart is its unique position as the first L2 network supported by a well-established public company committed to advancing crypto adoption.\n\nCoinbase unlocks access to a vast user base and over $130 billion in assets on its exchange platform.2 Furthermore, it offers a comprehensive suite of tools and infrastructure for developers to harness. For example, application developers have access to a range of integrations, including fiat onramps, a bridge to its widely adopted mobile app, and a user-friendly self-custodial wallet. Similarly, for users, Base is expected to simplify the blockchain experience as Coinbase streamlines interactions with these applications through direct in-app integrations.\n\nBase Gains Strong Momentum as Transactions Migrate from Ethereum to L2 Networks\n\nEarly indications are that L2 networks like Base have found strong product-market fit. The clearest evidence of this is that over 2 million daily transactions are now facilitated by L2 networks. Much of this migration can be attributed to the much lower costs of using L2s. Base, for example, charges an average transaction fee of $0.31 for a ~$200 USDC stablecoin transfer, a ~94% reduction over Ethereum\u2019s current fee of $5.02.3,4\n\nFurther, in just three months as a live network, Base has grown its user base to more than 2.5 million addresses.5 Undoubtedly, Base\u2019s rapid growth has been driven by increasing awareness of and familiarity with L2 networks over the past two years, as well as by the significant technological advancements that have been made within scaling technology during this time. Coinbase has also made the marketing of Base a strategic priority.\n\nAs the ecosystem of available applications on Base expands and the user experience continues to improve, we expect Base\u2019s active user base to continue to grow.\n\nAt present, more than $565 million has been transferred onto Base by its active user base, making it the third-largest L2 network behind only Arbitrum and Optimism which have $6.5 billion and $3 billion in assets deposited on their network.6 The majority of this value periodically engages with a diverse range of applications, mostly consisting of onchain financial services and novel social platforms.\n\nBase Solidifies Coinbase\u2019s Commitment to Ethereum and Paves the Way for New Business Horizons\n\nBase symbolizes Coinbase\u2019s vote of confidence in Ethereum and a commitment to expand the network. Coinbase is well-positioned to make Ethereum more accessible, reducing the barriers for users to engage with the sea of available applications and providing developers with the tools to contribute to the ecosystem\u2019s growth more easily and effectively.\n\nThis commitment not only strengthens Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem but strategically positions Coinbase to explore novel business opportunities. As Base is used, cryptographic proofs summarizing network activity must be submitted and settled on the Ethereum network. Coinbase currently manages the data relay process, referred to as the sequencer, and can capitalize both by ordering transactions as well as on the margin between fees charged for offchain transaction execution and the costs associated with settling batches of transactions on Ethereum.\n\nTo date, Base has generated approximately $5.3 million in profit through these operations.7 As user activity on Base continues to grow, we expect the profits earned from these activities to grow in kind. Eventually, the task of operating the L2 sequencer and relaying transactions back to Ethereum is poised to become a collaborative effort involving multiple parties, thus, an eventual distribution of these profits beyond Coinbase is anticipated.\n\nOperating Base presents a fresh opportunity for Coinbase, but there may be additional avenues to explore. By having access to a user\u2019s first touch point into Base via its mobile app and wallet infrastructure, Coinbase can strategically implement design choices and processes to extract fees and generate value. For example, this could involve earning fees by providing a fiat onramp for applications deployed on Base and implementing backend fees for streamlining user experience processes that simplify user interactions with these applications. Looking ahead, Coinbase may even explore the development of its own fee-generating applications, further contributing to the growing ecosystem of the Ethereum network.\n\nConclusion: Base Is an Acknowledgment of Ethereum\u2019s Vision and We Believe a Key Player in Advancing Crypto Adoption\n\nEthereum needs alternative pathways to improve network efficiency and affordability, and Base is a prime example of such an alternative. Marking a significant milestone in the maturation of Ethereum, Base embodies the ongoing progress in open-source L2 software while benefiting from Coinbase\u2019s expertise and large user base. By positioning itself as an accessible gateway to the Ethereum ecosystem, Base is expected to provide users with a streamlined and user-friendly experience, making the Ethereum ecosystem more approachable for the masses.\n\nThe launch of Base also highlights how companies like Coinbase can contribute to Ethereum\u2019s scalability and unlock new business opportunities. With Base, Ethereum takes a step closer to becoming an integral part of our digital lives, while Coinbase solidifies its trailblazing role in the industry.\n\nRelated ETFs\n\nClick the fund name above to view current holdings.

        "title": "Ethereum Chinese Control: More Fuel for ETH Centralization Concerns - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum is currently the second most popular blockchain.\n\nIts decentralization has been a persistent concern since it became Proof-of-stake.\n\nNow, a new post on X has raised new concerns about links to China.\n\nA recent X post from cybersleuth TruthLabs sparked fresh concerns around the level of Chinese influence and control in the Ethereum ecosystem. The investigator highlighted the deep involvement of entities affiliated to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Ethereum\u2019s genesis, mining network, and protocol development.\n\nWith Ethereum having transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus model, the spotlight is back on the token distribution. The investigator argues that the outsized control of tokens by Chinese entities poses a severe threat to Ethereum\u2019s decentralization credentials. Let\u2019s analyze the cybersleuth\u2019s claims to understand the implications for Ethereum.\n\nEthereum\u2019s China Links\n\nTruthLabs points out that Chinese conglomerate Wanxiang group was an early backer of Ethereum. The group purchased $500,000 worth of ETH from Vitalik Buterin in 2015 and helped him set up the network\u2019s original wallets.\n\nThat donation was later converted to 416,000 ETH tokens. Since then, there has never been any explanation of what Wanxiang received in return for this generous support.\n\nEthereum's hidden Centralization problem: The Chinese Communist Party. The same party using blockchain to track and control everything, Implementing Social Credit Scores, CBDC's, and a number of other surveillance protocols. The CCP, thru Wanxiang, and a number of other CCP\u2026 https://t.co/uYxIqUY6n5 \u2014 TruthLabs \ud83e\udee1 (@BoringSleuth) November 5, 2023\n\n\u201cVitalik was out of cash, and he found it by selling ETH\u2019s decentralized future to the CCP,\u201d said TruthLabs.\n\nWanxiang Group was founded in 1969 by Lu Guanqiu as an agricultural machinery company in China. It has grown into one of China\u2019s largest non-state-owned companies with over $30 billion in revenue.\n\nWanxiang Raising Concerns\n\nWanxiang entered the US market in 1994 and now has over 5,000 employees across the country. More recently, Wanxiang has shown strong interest in blockchain and crypto, establishing Wanxiang Blockchain Labs in 2017.\n\nIts deep ties with the CCP raise concerns that the Chinese government may be covertly running Ethereum nodes despite the network\u2019s pseudonymous structure. Beyond holding large chunks of ETH, Chinese mining entities are also allegedly controlling over 80% of Ethereum\u2019s mining power.\n\nA complete guess, 66.6%. I found 12 Genesis Block Wallets today, alone where they ended up with the majority of the ETH from. Its so hard to know. They were invested in over 500 projects by EOY 2021, and in many cases got the pre-ICO tokens prior to both ETH/altcoin price waves. \u2014 TruthLabs \ud83e\udee1 (@BoringSleuth) June 28, 2023\n\nWhile the shift to proof-of-stake limits the influence miners can exert, critics argue that the excessive ETH hoarded by Chinese players still poses a threat. According to TruthLabs, entities linked to the CCP may hold up to 66% of all ETH in circulation. Although, the account has qualified that statement by saying it is a \u201ccomplete guess.\u201d\n\nIf true, this enormous, opaque concentration of ETH in wallets associated with the Chinese regime increases the risk of a centralized attack on the network. It also undermines Ethereum\u2019s credibility as a decentralized ecosystem.\n\nAs TruthLabs has pointed out on multiple occasions, Ethereum\u2019s China links are not breaking news. On top of early Chinese investment, Buterin also appeared preoccupied with learning Chinese as early as January 2014, according to Laura Shin\u2019s book The Cryptopians\u2014the period shortly before Chinese backers came on board.\n\nFurthermore, Buterin became the chief scientist of Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, a subsidiary, in the latter half of 2015. A 2016 Facebook post identified Buterin as a co-founder of WBL, alongside Xiao and Bo Shen, co-founders of the Bitshares decentralized exchange.\n\nTransparency Needed To Avoid Centralization Risks\n\nEthereum has firmly established itself as the leading smart contract platform, with an impressive array of DeFi and NFT projects built on it. However, for understandable reasons, lingering doubts remain around just how decentralized its network really is.\n\nThe concentration of nodes is an issue, as Buterin himself acknowledges. Transparency around the top ETH wallets is even more critical in light of the transition to proof-of-stake. A few unknown whales potentially hold enough ETH to sway votes or even attack the network.\n\nA quick \ud83e\uddf5showing that Wanxiang, Chinese auto and early Ethereum Investor funded and setup Vitalik Buterins official wallets. 1/6https://t.co/4uMLLnzguq pic.twitter.com/Ec1cjLOLz2 \u2014 TruthLabs \ud83e\udee1 (@BoringSleuth) January 29, 2023\n\nWhile Ethereum downplays its ties to China today, evidence shows deep involvement of Chinese entities, including state-linked ones, during its early days.\n\nHowever, greater transparency on who the major ETH holders are could go a long way in reassuring users. Any blockchain touting decentralization credentials needs to identify and mitigate centralization risks proactively. For Ethereum, providing clarity on its relationship with Chinese entities is an important first step."

        "content": "On the Cosmos-based EVM chain Evmos, Cosmos transactions and Ethereum transactions have been operating under different standards, leading to complications as these two types of transactions struggle to decode each other effectively.\n\nEvmos plans to relieve this technical headache by only supporting Ethereum-formatted transactions by 2024 Q3, it announced in a blog post Tuesday. Despite this strategic shift, the protocol emphasized that Evmos is not exiting the Cosmos ecosystem. Additionally, Evmos\u2019 founder suggested that the move could help bring Ethereum developers to the IBC.\n\nEvmos functions as an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain that integrates the Cosmos IBC protocol, allowing it to operate as an EVM within the Cosmos network.

        "title": "3 reasons why Ethereum price is underperforming altcoins - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The price of Ether (ETH) surged by 6.2% from Nov. 3 to Nov. 5, but the altcoin is facing difficulty breaking the $1,900 resistance. Despite the current bullish trend, Ether\u2019s 17% return over the last 30 days falls short of Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) impressive 27% gain during the same period.\n\nRegulatory hurdles and ecosystem centralization critiques linger\n\nAnalysts attribute some of Ether\u2019s underperformance to uncertainty surrounding Consensys, a key player in the Ethereum ecosystem. Former employees have filed a lawsuit against the company and its co-founder Joseph Lubin. Over two dozen shareholders of the Swiss holding company, Consensys AG, claim that Lubin, who is also a co-founder of Ethereum, violated a \u201cno-dilution promise\u201d made in 2015.\n\nConsensys is responsible for developing and hosting infrastructure projects crucial to the Ethereum network. It was founded in October 2014, about nine months before the Ethereum blockchain launched in mid-2015. Furthermore, the High Court of Zug in Switzerland ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, exacerbating the current uncertainty.\n\nRegulatory challenges have hampered the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem. The latest concern centers around PayPal\u2019s U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, PYUSD, which operates on the Ethereum network. This token is designed for digital payments and Web3 applications. On Nov. 2, PayPal disclosed a subpoena it received from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn addition to regulatory pressures, there has been notable criticism of the decentralization of financial applications within the Ethereum network. Chainlink, a preferred solution for oracle services, quietly reduced the number of participants in its multisignature wallet from four out of nine to four out of eight. Analysts have highlighted the lack of governance by regular users as a significant issue.\n\nEther\u2019s underperformance to altcoins is evidence of other issues\n\nSeveral major altcoins \u2014 including Solana\u2019s SOL (SOL), XRP (XRP) and Cardano\u2019s ADA (ADA) \u2014 have outperformed Ether, with returns of 75.5%, 37% and 35% in the last 30 days, respectively. This discrepancy suggests that the factors holding back ETH are not solely related to regulatory pressure or reduced demand for the decentralized finance and nonfungible token markets.\n\nOne pressing issue for the Ethereum network is the high gas fees associated with transactions, including those executed by smart contracts. The latest seven-day average transaction fee was $4.90, negatively impacting the usage of decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nMoreover, the total deposits on the Ethereum network, measured in Ether, have dropped to their lowest levels since August 2020. It\u2019s essential to note that this analysis does not consider the effects of native Ethereum staking.\n\nEthereum network applications' total deposits in ETH. Source: DefiLlama\n\nAccording to DefiLlama data, Ethereum DApps had a total value locked (TVL) of 12.7 million ETH on Nov. 5, down 4% from the 13.2 million ETH two months earlier. In comparison, the TVL on the Tron network increased by 13% during the same period, while Arbitrum deposits remained at 1 million ETH. Data on DApp activity on the Ethereum network supports the notion of reduced activity.\n\nEthereum network top DApps, 30-day active addresses. Source: DappRadar\n\nEven excluding the significant 60% decline in the Uniswap NFT Aggregator, the average number of active addresses across the top Ethereum network DApps decreased by 3% compared with the previous month. In contrast, Solana\u2019s top applications saw an average 18% increase in active users during the same period, according to DappRadar data.\n\nRelated: Aave pauses several markets after reports of feature issue\n\nFinally, on-chain activity indicates increased user deposits of ETH at exchanges. While this data doesn\u2019t necessarily signal short-term selling, the mere availability of coins is typically viewed as a precautionary measure by analysts.\n\nAverage 7-day daily ETH deposits at exchanges, ETH thousands. Source: Coin Metrics\n\nThe present daily ETH deposit average of 255,614 represents a 30% increase from two weeks earlier, indicating that holders are more inclined to sell as Ether\u2019s price approaches $1,900.\n\nThe data suggests that reduced TVL, declining DApps activity and a higher rate of ETH exchange deposits are negatively impacting the likelihood of Ether breaking the $1,900 resistance. The price level could be more challenging than initially expected, and for now, Ether bears can take a breath.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Cryptocurrency experts have lowered their predictions for Ethereum (ETH), over the next few years, according to a new survey from Finder.\n\nThe survey asked 31 industry specialists for their ether price forecasts for the end of 2023, 2025 and 2030. The average predictions were down compared to a previous Finder survey conducted in July 2022.\n\nThe panel predicted Ether will be worth $1,840 on average by the end of 2023, down from a prediction of $2,451 in July. The 2025 forecast fell to $5,824 from $5,845 previously, and the 2030 prediction declined to $14,411 versus $16,414 in the earlier survey.\n\nFinder calculates the average forecasts by removing the top and bottom 10% of responses and taking the mean of the rest, a technique known as the truncated mean. This is designed to eliminate outliers and arrive at a more consistent consensus.\n\nYou might also like: Investor optimism fuels meme coins growth: predictions and market analysis\n\nWhile still bullish long term, some panelists cited near-term economic challenges and competition from other blockchains as reasons for tempered short-term expectations.\n\nETH has a huge growth potential.

Riding on Bitcoin\u2019s bullish efforts, Ethereum traders are seizing the opportunity to push the price of ETH beyond the $1,900 zone. With continued negative Netflow suggesting that more Ethereum is being bought than sold, analysts are growing increasingly positive about ETH\u2019s potential to cross the $1,900 mark. This trend develops a bullish sentiment among investors, accelerating their confidence to buy more ETH in anticipation of future gains.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Confidence Shines Despite Network Issues\n\nA number of prominent altcoins, such as Solana (SOL), XRP, and Cardano (ADA), have surpassed Ethereum in performance, yielding returns of 75%, 37%, and 34%, respectively, over the past month. This performance gap indicates that the challenges facing ETH extend beyond network hurdles or a slump in the DeFi and NFT sectors.\n\nA significant problem for the Ethereum network is the rising transaction costs, especially for operations carried out by smart contracts. The average transaction fee over the past week has reached $4.90, which is discouraging for the use of decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nFurthermore, the amount of Ether deposited on the Ethereum network has fallen to its lowest since August 2020. However, despite these setbacks, Ethereum continues to charge ahead, as indicated by on-chain metrics.\n\nInformation from IntoTheBlock indicates that Ethereum\u2019s Netflow has remained negative for over the last four days, suggesting a positive outlook as the amount leaving exchanges exceeds what\u2019s coming in. This trend points to reduced chances of selling among investors as exchange reserves decline, with the current Netflow at -27,700 ETH.\n\nIn addition, Ethereum\u2019s Open Interest (OI) has hit a peak not seen in three months, with traders actively initiating futures contracts, driving the value up to $6.6 billion.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nOver the last few hours, Ether attempted to surpass the immediate resistance level at $1,900 due to bullish efforts, only to be driven back under by bearish resistance, showcasing significant sell-offs at higher prices. As of writing, ETH price trades at $1,896, decreasing over 0.3% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe next move for the bears would be to attempt to drive the price down towards the solid support mark at $1,860. This level is crucial to watch, as buyers might defend the level strongly. If the price makes a rebound from this level, the ETH price can break out above the upper trend line. In this case, we might see the price consolidating around $1,983-$2,024.\n\nConversely, if bulls fail to defend the $1,860 level, the ETH price might decline sharply. As a result, the ETH price might hover around $1,747 for a while. If sellers continue their domination, ETH price might witness another decline, stabilizing around $1,670."

        "title": "Why Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu Jumped Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies had a great weekend and are off on the right foot on Monday as well. Economic news last week gave investors reason to move further out on the risk curve, and that meant in part bidding up the value of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThree of the biggest movers were Ethereum (ETH 2.02%), Dogecoin (DOGE 0.50%), and Shiba Inu (SHIB 2.63%). Ethereum rose as much as 5.4% between Friday's close and noon ET on Monday and is now up 4.8% over that time. Dogecoin had a more pronounced move, climbing 10.2% and currently trading 9.1% higher. Shiba Inu is at its high point, up 7.1%.\n\nEconomic data driving markets\n\nThe economic news last week helped push markets, including cryptocurrencies, higher to end the week. Investors saw the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes as a positive and there was a lot of speculation that rates would be kept flat through the end of the year.\n\nOn top of that, a weaker-than-expected jobs report was seen as a positive for markets. As the thinking goes, if job growth is slowing, the economy may not be overheating -- which means the Federal Reserve will stop raising rates to slow the economy.\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive, but lower interest rates are currently seen as very bullish for riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. And short term, that's driving values higher.\n\nETF speculation continues\n\nTrading momentum continues to be strong on speculation that more crypto ETFs will be approved. We know the SEC is considering multiple Bitcoin ETFs, and that could pave the way for both more crypto ETFs and more funds flowing into the industry more broadly.\n\nBlackRock is one of the leading institutions applying for a spot ETF. The company controls $9 trillion in assets under management, so it could lead to a big inflow of funds to the crypto industry. That's the speculation.\n\nMany institutions have shied away from crypto because of the legal grey area it operates in, especially in the U.S. So, approval by the SEC would be generally bullish for crypto broadly at a time when many countries are writing specific rules on how cryptocurrencies can be traded and how blockchain companies can operate.\n\nWhile the market is speculating that a Bitcoin ETF would eventually be bullish for tokens like Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu, it's not clear if they would eventually get spot ETFs as well.\n\nSpeculation rules the day\n\nThe reality is that everything I discussed above is speculation about the value of cryptocurrencies. There's no increased utility or ability to pay for goods using the blockchain. Investors are simply bidding up digital assets because of what the Federal Reserve did and what they think the SEC might do.\n\nIf any of this speculation ends up being false, it's possible that crypto values could crash again. I would like to see more real world utility being built into the blockchain and tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu find real use cases. Until they do, this is just a speculative asset.\n\nEthereum still has the potential to be a valuable blockchain, but it also struggles with high costs and slow transactions. Upgrades could change that, but that will take time. Investors seem to be glossing over that utility need today."

        "title": "Ethereum Layer-2 Booming: Will Gas Fees Drop Even In A Bull Market? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The adoption of Ethereum layer-2s is on the rise if Token Terminal data shared on November 6 is anything to go by. According to statistics from the blockchain analytics platform shared by Erik Smith, the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of 401 Financial, the average active addresses over the past three months has exceeded 10 million, a nearly 2X expansion from early 2023.\n\nRelated Reading: Can The ADA Price Climb Above $20 In The Bull Market? Analyst Provides Answers\n\nEthereum Layer-2s Finding More Adoption\n\nLooking at the chart, Polygon, an Ethereum sidechain, remains the most popular. At the same time, Arbitrum and OP Mainnet, which are common layer-2s adopting the roll-up technology, are actively being used.\n\nEven so, OP Mainnet\u2019s share is gradually dropping. Base, a layer-2 backed by Coinbase, and StarkNet are also finding adoption, expanding their share over the past three months.\n\nIn crypto, active addresses refer to the number of unique wallet addresses (sending and receiving) that have interacted with the blockchain, in this case, Ethereum, over a given period.\n\nAn uptick or contraction in the number of active addresses can be used to measure sentiment and the level of uptake. In bear markets, active addresses tend to drop, only rising when bulls flow in, pointing to a possible scramble for arising opportunities.\n\nThe recent uptrend coincides with the rapid expansion of leading crypto prices. Ethereum (ETH) prices are inching closer to the $1,870 resistance level, with a breakout above this line a potential trigger for a leg up that might see the coin retest $2,100 and even register new 2023 highs.\n\nUsually, rising crypto prices tend to revive demand as the number of active addresses and, in some instances, the total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi), and more.\n\nWhat Will Happen To Gas Fees?\n\nEthereum is the world\u2019s most active smart contract platform, stretching its dominance mainly because of its first-mover advantage. The blockchain anchors more DeFi, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and gaming activity. Deploying protocols, depending on their objectives, can either directly launch on the mainnet or layer-2s.\n\nThe mainnet is directly secured by validators, while layer-2 solutions depend on the mainnet for security but often re-route transactions off-chain. In this arrangement, more transactions can be processed cheaply and efficiently, relieving the mainnet.\n\nThough the Ethereum base layer is secure, its peak transaction throughput remains relatively lower at around 15 TPS. This means during peak demand, gas fees tend to be higher, impacting user demand.\n\nStill, Ethereum gas fees remain at a multi-year low at around 23 Gwei, according to trackers, as seen on the chart below. This is down from 240 Gwei recorded in February 2021 when crypto assets rapidly rose.\n\nFor now, whether gas fees will increase as the market recovers is yet to be seen. What\u2019s evident is that as users opt for layer-2s, the mainnet will likely be relieved, keeping gas fee fluctuation low.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Michael Egorov of Curve Finance proposes launching Venus Protocol on Ethereum Mainnet, incorporating Curve's stablecoin crvUSD and CRV as collaterals, with community support for growth.\n\nCurve Finance founder Michael Egorov has put forth a proposal to deploy the Venus Protocol on the Ethereum Mainnet, signaling a strategic expansion in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. This proposition, aimed at tapping into Ethereum\u2019s substantial liquidity, also includes the integration of Curve\u2019s native tokens crvUSD and CRV as collateral options, paired with a mutually beneficial rewards system.\n\nEthereum, recognized for its significant liquidity and the volume of on-chain transactions, presents a ripe environment for DeFi protocols. Curve, holding a pivotal position with a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $1.8 billion and a widely used stablecoin (crvUSD) with a supply of $130 million, is set to extend its influence by supporting pools with Venus assets on the Ethereum Mainnet.\n\nThe proposed deployment is poised to deliver several advantages: Enhanced visibility and brand recognition for Venus on a premier blockchain network. Additional adoption and utility for Curve\u2019s crvUSD as a stablecoin within lending protocols. The establishment of liquidity pools that further integrate the offerings of both Venus and Curve.\n\nEgorov details the potential for creating core and isolated pools on Venus, presenting specific supply and borrow caps to align with risk-managed approaches. A notable feature is the proposed liquidity mining incentive, which could see an injection of 500,000 CRV tokens to stimulate supply-side participation, with the aspiration of achieving a 10% Annual Percentage Rate (APR) over a span of 120 days.\n\nThe response within the community forum has been overwhelmingly positive, with leaders and members expressing strong support for the deployment. The enthusiasm underscores the community's eagerness for cross-chain collaboration, acknowledging Ethereum's high gas fees but valuing its considerable volume of transactions.\n\nA gauge system within Curve\u2019s DAO is highlighted as a mechanism to distribute rewards, emphasizing decentralized decision-making. Successful implementation hinges on community votes, with historical precedence showing favorable outcomes for such gauges.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Ethereum scaling solution builder =nil; Foundation has introduced zkSharding for Ethereum, the latest infrastructure attempt at gaining faster transaction speeds while maintaining Ethereum\u2019s economic security.\n\nSharding, unlike other popular scaling solutions, is designed to divide the Ethereum network into different sections and process transactions in a cheaper, more efficient manner.\n\nZkSharding utilizes zero-knowledge (zk) technology to generate proofs, ensuring that transactions are valid across different layer-2 shards before being submitted to Ethereum mainnet. The greater the sub-shards, the higher the maximum throughput on Ethereum.\n\nThis technique is not to be confused with Proto-Danksharding, which refers to Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, and whose primary purpose is to reduce the costs of transactions for zk rollups by storing them in temporary data blobs, Misha Komarov, CEO and co-founder of =nil; Foundation told Blockworks.\n\nAll zk rollups can benefit from Proto-Danksharding, but only applications built on =nil; will be able to benefit from zkSharding on top of that, Komarov explains, noting that data-intensive environments and high-load environments will be able to benefit most from zkSharding.\n\n\u201cAs a zk rollup, =nil; benefits from Proto-Danksharding that cheapens storing transactions on Ethereum, however zkSharding as a scaling concept addresses fragmentation of liquidity and economic security,\u201d Komarov said.\n\nZkSharding represents a combination of modular and monolithic blockchain architectures and delivers an appropriate solution based on its features in a competitive layer-2 environment, he said.\n\n\u201cWe believe that zkSharding addresses the drawbacks common for other alternatives on the market that go, by design, with application-specific scaling,\u201d she said.\n\nSpecifically, Komarov notes that applications built on other zk rollups can only interact with liquidity or data that was migrated to its specific zk rollup environment, limiting market efficiency and creating additional trust assumptions and costs through bridges for interoperability.\n\n\u201czkSharding introduces separate shards as dedicated execution layers that are fully composable with each other, meaning a transaction can trigger the creation of new transactions on other shards,\u201d Komarov said.\n\nThe goals are familiar from other zk-based scaling approaches such as zkSync\u2019s, however. ZkSync terms chain connections using the ZK Stack architecture \u201chyperbridges,\u201d which are also designed to trigger transactions on other \u201chyperchains,\u201d a spokesperson told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cAs a rule, don\u2019t trust, verify the claims of those that promise to solve the layer-2 fragmentation of liquidity issues \u2014 even with cutting-edge zk tech, it\u2019s definitely not solvable for native assets without adding non-negligible security assumptions,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nFinding the proof in the pudding will have to wait in the case of the new =nil; layer-2, which is initially operating with a single shard on a testnet."

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nDespite a strong bullish end to October, November has started with a neutral sentiment, as the market has been constantly moving sideways. Further, the Midcap tokens have been outperforming the elite cryptocurrencies since the month started, suggesting a switch of interest among the investors toward these coins.\n\nThe leader of Altcoins, Ethereum, has displayed a significant move in its price in recent times as the price has gained massive momentum. Earlier, the ETH price was seen trading below its key resistance of $1,600 for a brief period.\n\nTradingView: ETH/USDT\n\nAfter this, the Bitcoin price gained massive price volatility, resulting in the market gaining momentum. Ethereum\u2019s price followed in the footsteps of the market leader and displayed a significant uptrend in its price by breaking out of its key resistance level at $1,600.\n\nEthereum continued to gain momentum, broke out of multiple resistance levels, and made a run to test its important resistance level at $1,850, but the price was rejected, following which the bulls lost power.\n\nEthereum price started trading in a consolidated range between $1,759.18 and $1,850, forming a flag pattern, further indicating the possibility of a bullish uptrend in the coming days.\n\nThe price made multiple attempts to break out but constantly failed as the bears overpowered the bulls. Recently, the ETH price broke out of its important resistance level of $1,850, suggesting a strong bullish influence in the market, which could result in the price experiencing a bullish price action soon.\n\nWill Ethereum Record New Yearly High?\n\nLooking at the technical indicators, the MACD displays a constant green histogram, indicating a bullish influence in the market. Further, the averages show a rising pattern, suggesting the price to continue appreciating in the coming time.\n\nIf the bulls continue to gain momentum and hold its price above the resistance level of $1,850, the price will continue to gain momentum and make a run to test its upper resistance level of $1,920. Maintaining a hold at this level might set the stage for the price to attempt to reach the major resistance at $2,000 this year.\n\nConversely, if the ETH bulls fail to hold the price above its support level, the price could lose momentum, resulting in it testing its lower support level of $1,745.26 soon. Moreover, if the bears keep dominating the market, it will further plunge and potentially test its lower support level of $1,686.77 this month.\n\nWill ETH Price Reagin $2000 Mark This Year?\n\nAlamanda\u2019s FTX has sold 7,183 ETH tokens worth approximately $13 Million within the past 24 hours. Further, the exchange has also made significant transfers in various assets during the past two days, for which the reason is unknown, suggesting a possibility of a massive price action in the near future.\n\nMoreover, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s increasing withdrawals for donation purposes may result in the price trading under the $2K mark for a significant period.\n\nOn the positive side, the Ethereum coin has recorded a significant spike in its holdings of large wallets as investors display a rise in their interest in the coin. The total supply held by the whale addresses in percentage has consistently climbed during the previous months, indicating a strong and promising future price action for this coin."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst says two surging altcoins are still in the early phases of their bull runs and predicts further rallies for them.\n\nIn a new video update, pseudonymous crypto analyst The Flow Horse says that the decentralized oracle provider Chainlink (LINK) and the smart contract platform Solana (SOL) are just beginning their uptrend.\n\nAccording to the trader, those who believe they have missed their opportunity to invest in LINK are wrong.\n\n\u201c[People are] worried about buying LINK\u2026 because they feel they missed it. I think that between the $11.00 and $8.50 is going to look like a rounding error if we\u2019re talking a year, two years into the future as the crypto market continues to grow.\u201d\n\nLINK is trading for $12.56 at time of writing.\n\nMoving on to Solana, the crypto trader says that the Ethereum (ETH) rival could reasonably double in price.\n\n\u201cYou have Solana, that is talking about itself as being a competitor to ETH or dethroning ETH. If you look at Solana, it\u2019s 30 times less the market cap of ETH so even if that gap closes a little bit, we\u2019re looking at Solana doubling from here is reasonable without any kind of major changes in the market.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $41.31 at time of writing, a fractional decrease on the day but a staggering 300% increase since the start of 2023.\n\nLooking at the king crypto, The Flow Horse says Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) current breakout resembles that of the one in 2021 and that the top crypto asset by market cap could find itself in the $40,000 range.\n\n\u201cIf you look at BTC, it\u2019s well off the lows\u2026 We\u2019ve changed and broken through this level [$32,000]. We\u2019re still relatively close to that level, so I think that we\u2019re looking at $40,000, and if you can get involved between here and $31,000, I think you\u2019re golden.\n\nI don\u2019t think you need to rush this. It\u2019s kind of like when we had this breakout [in 2021]. It\u2019s some kind of version of what\u2019s taking place back [then], but the idea was there\u2019s a lot of people that felt like maybe [that breakout] was late even and I just think that that\u2019s clearly going to turn out to not be the case.\u201d\n\nBTC is trading for $35,196 at time of writing.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Bullish Revival: Will This Breakthrough Lead To A New Market Phase? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has exhibited a promising technical development, igniting optimism within the crypto community.\n\nThe formation of a bullish flag pattern within the daily timeframe has captured the attention of analysts and traders, hinting at potential positive movements in the near future.\n\nA bullish flag pattern is a common technical analysis formation in financial markets, frequently visible on price charts. It involves an upward price surge (the flagpole) succeeded by a consolidation or sideways movement (the flag) within a downward or sideways channel.\n\nTypically identified within the daily timeframe, it signals recent upward movement followed by a consolidation phase. Traders and analysts keenly observe this pattern as it often implies a potential continuation of an upward trend.\n\nThis aligns perfectly with the current recovery sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, as Ether managed to breach the upper trendline of the pattern earlier this week, pointing towards the possibility of a substantial upward surge.\n\nEthereum: Breakthrough Resistance\n\nThe recent surge in Ethereum\u2019s price has broken past a critical resistance level marked by the convergence of its 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs). These EMAs hold paramount importance for traders and analysts, often serving as key indicators of market trends and momentum.\n\nThe successful breach of this resistance level further reinforces the bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum, indicating a potential shift towards a more robust upward trajectory.\n\nThe bullish flag pattern that has taken shape on Ethereum\u2019s price chart has been a long time in the making, spanning over a period of seven months. During this time, the price of ETH has fluctuated within the converging trendlines of the pattern, reflecting the market\u2019s indecision and the tug-of-war between buyers and sellers.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the upper boundary of the pattern has acted as a significant support level twice, underlining its influence in shaping market sentiment and price dynamics.\n\nEthereum currently trading at $1,883 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nMarket Insights And Caution\n\nAs of the latest market data provided by CoinGecko, the current price of Ethereum stands at $1,890, reflecting a modest 24-hour gain of 0.5% and a notable upward trajectory of 5.3% over the past seven days. These figures reaffirm the growing interest in Ethereum, highlighting the market\u2019s confidence in the coin\u2019s potential for further gains.\n\nSource: Coingecko\n\nIndustry experts and seasoned traders offer valuable insights into this recent development, emphasizing the importance of closely monitoring the price action and overall market sentiment surrounding Ethereum. With the bullish flag pattern hinting at a potential bullish continuation, market participants are advised to stay vigilant and consider the implications of this technical setup in their trading strategies.\n\nDespite the positive momentum, caution remains essential, as the cryptocurrency market is known for its inherent volatility and unpredictability. Investors and traders are advised to conduct thorough research, employ risk management strategies, and stay informed about market developments to make well-informed decisions in this dynamic and rapidly evolving landscape.\n\n(This site\u2019s content should not be construed as investment advice.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlockchain sleuth @lookonchain has reported that the mysterious holder of 250,000 ETH acquired during the Ethereum ICO in 2014 has been identified.\n\nThe sleuth cited Coinbase's director of product strategy and business operations, Conor Grogan, on this issue. The latter is famous on Twitter for tracking huge sums of cryptocurrencies that were once lost by their owners.\n\nRain Lohmus, the founder of LHV Bank, received 250K $ETH from the #EthereumICO.\n\n\n\nThe cost is ~$77.5K, and now worth ~$473M.\n\n\n\nBut unfortunately, he lost the keys.https://t.co/PG2vALcDmU pic.twitter.com/ZPuexmdR1t \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 7, 2023\n\n$437 million in ETH locked dead over lost wallet keys\n\nData shared by Grogan in a recent tweet shows that he had managed to identify the unknown whale who acquired approximately $77,500 worth of ETH. This crypto, Grogan comments, has been completely untouched, and there has not been a single transfer made from it since 2014.\n\nThe owner turned out to be the founder of LHV Bank based in the Baltics, Rain Lohmus. Apparently, he has lost his private keys and has been unable to move his ETH or convert in into fiat.\n\nBy now, the ETH he holds is worth roughly $437 million \u2013 that is 5,333x growth.\n\nGrogan mentioned that if anyone can help him recover these hundreds of millions, he is willing to pay a generous reward for it: \"If you can help him recover them somehow, he's willing to split them with you.\"\n\nNearly 910,000 ETH lost forever in total\n\nSumming up his recent estimations, Conor Grogan stated that the overall amount of Ethereum that has been lost for good with very low chances of recovery now constitutes 886,000 ETH \u2013 that is more than $1.63 billion in the fiat equivalent.\n\nWith a few extra addresses added, the total amount of lost Ether rises to 909,800 ETH, worth more than $1.73 billion, or over 0.75% of the whole Ethereum supply circulating on the market.\n\nAdded a few extra addresses I've been meaning to (Incl. Prime Trust lost ETH) and we are up to 909,800 ETH worth $1.73B+ that are lost forever: 0.75%+ of all circulating supply pic.twitter.com/mb2XSqsQb2 \u2014 Conor (@jconorgrogan) November 6, 2023\n\nLargest ETH outflow from CEX observed\n\nAs reported by on-chain data vendor IntoTheBlock earlier, over the past week, a massive outflow of Ethereum was detected from centralized crypto exchanges \u2013 the largest outflow since August.\n\nIn total, more than $210,000,000 worth of Ethereum was moved to self-custody by investors. A likely reason for this is that investors plan to hold their ETH long term, which is best to do in one's own wallets rather than holding digital currencies on crypto exchanges.\n\nBetween Sunday and Monday this week, the second largest crypto, Ethereum, staged a minor growth of 3.13%, reaching the $1,914 level. However, within the last 24 hours, ETH failed to hold there or show a further rise. Instead, the crypto went down by 2.33%, now exchanging hands at $1,869 on the Bitstamp exchange."

        "content": "Ethereum price surpassed $1900 for the first time after August, rising more than 16% in a month. This comes as Bitcoin takes a breather near $35K and altcoins take the lead. While the market sentiment remains positive, ETH price is under pressure as millions of open interest (OI) have been wiped out after a significant increase last week.\n\nEthereum $400 Million Of Open Interest Wiped Out\n\n\u201cEthereum catches my eye on this Sunday. The Open Interest (OI) has increased by +$600m over the last days. This will be volatile very soon,\u201d said on-chain crypto analyst Maartunn. Traders anticipate ETH to hit $2000 as Bitcoin price holds $35K strongly.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMaartunn on November 6 noted that $400 million of OI wiped out in a day, giving up mostly all gains in OI in the last few days. As a result, the ETH price is under pressure, probably for a pullback or a correction. With the market sentiment positive, a correction is unlikely. However, a retracement is most likely.\n\nIn addition, there are many ETH moves to crypto exchanges by whales amid altcoins\u2019 recovery. A selloff by whales is typically considered a bullish move, but keep an eye on trading volume for an invalidation of a correction.\n\nCoinGape Markets reported that a bearish breakdown channel pattern would set the price for a 16% drop. Ethereum has experienced heightened volatility near the $1830 level, proving to be a formidable resistance.\n\nPopular crypto analyst Credible Crypto said the chart is clean at the moment and the $1400-$1500 zone was his HTF buy zone and the bottom. He believes ETH price will not go below $1500 again. In addition, he predicts ETH will hit $1700 first before moving to $2000.\n\nETH price fell 1% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $1,877. The 24-hour low and high are $1,863 and $1,911, respectively. Furthermore, trading volume has increased by 42% in the past 24 hours.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Price Chart Indicates Major Incoming Move, Will ETH, XRP, ADA, SOL Follow?"

As Ethereum rises, crypto expert \"Carl from the Moon\" notices a breakout from an intriguing chart pattern known as the \"diamond pattern.\"\n\nCHART: #Ethereum is breaking out from the diamond pattern, as I predicted on YouTube earlier today.\n\n\n\nI took the trade, did you? pic.twitter.com/ghU70wINfp \u2014 Carl From The Moon (@TheMoonCarl) November 6, 2023\n\nDan Tapiero, founder of the 10T Fund, noticed something significant in the Ethereum price action. Tapiero believes Ethereum might hit $4,000 if the climb continues. He believes that a break of the $2,200 barrier will result in Ethereum soon reaching the $4,000 price level.\n\nTapiero goes on to say that, while it may seem difficult to believe, the digital asset ecosystem is still expanding and that, even though the price of ETH is still down 50% from its highs, real-world use cases are growing.\n\nAccording to a recent CoinShares report, digital asset investment products received inflows totaling $261 million, marking the sixth week of continuous inflows totaling $767 million.\n\nThis surpasses the total inflows of $736 million observed in 2022. Ethereum saw the largest inflows since August 2022, totaling $17.5 million.\n\nEthereum price action\n\nThe Ethereum price rose for the fourth day in a row after hitting support at the $1,776 level, which coincided with the daily MA 200. In today's trading session, the current climb reached intraday highs of $1,916.\n\nSince Oct. 12, when it hit a low of $1,520, Ethereum has been steadily rising. ETH has surpassed the daily moving averages (MA) of 50 and 200, which are situated at $1,672 and $1,776, respectively.\n\nAll eyes are currently on Ethereum gaining a foothold over the $2,000 price mark, which would signify the beginning of a fresh rise for ETH.\n\nEthereum's attempts to break through the $2,000 barrier were thwarted by bears in May and July, with Ethereum only reaching a high of $2,138 in April this year."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) price is pulling back after taking a breather in the wake of the climb to $1,900 earlier this week. The prominent smart contracts token needs to sweep fresh liquidity preferably at $1,800; the immediate support. Traders may take this opportunity to lock in the gains, a move likely to trigger a larger sell-off.\n\nHowever, with a bull flag pattern validated on the weekly chart, investors do not need to panic, as the next rebound could overcome resistance at $2,000 and pave the way for gains to a new all-time high of $5,800, foreshadowed by the Finder\u2019s panel.\n\nadvertisement\n\nA higher support is anticipated above $1,800 as Ethereum collects liquidity for the next breakout above $2,000. For now, it might be prudent to let the consolidation play out before betting on either longs or shorts.\n\nEthereum Price Bullish Scenario \u2013 Bull Flag Pattern\n\nThe weekly chart highlights the formation and validation of a bull flag. This is a bullish flag pattern, formed by a couple of price rallies set apart by a consolidation period.\n\nThe flagpole represents the bullish muscle blindsiding sellers who then briefly assume control over the price (the channel), as profit-booking takes place, but eventually, the price breaks out to a higher level.\n\nIn Ethereum\u2019s case, the bull flag breakout has already been validated. However, due to the resistance at $1,900, buyers lack the momentum to complete the 49.44% breakout target of $2,678.\n\nWith Ethereum price holding above all three moving averages, including the 50-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA), the 100-week EMA, and the 200-week EMA, the uptrend has a higher chance of resuming than a correction taking place below $1,800.\n\nTraders should be on the lookout for how Ethereum price responds to the support provided by the 100-week EMA (blue) at $1,806. A retest of this support could prove highly bullish and trigger a larger breakout.\n\nHowever, trading below $1,800 might be detrimental to ETH price as it may discourage traders from booking new long positions afraid of capitulation. Below $1,800, the next key support areas are the 50-week EMA (red) at $1,757 and the 200-week EMA (purple) at $1,633.\n\nFinder Analysts Predict Ethereum Price Rise To $5.8k By 2025\n\nFinder, a platform that brings together predictions from different industry leaders, has predicted a potential surge in Ethereum price to $5,800 by 2025.\n\n\u201cOn average, our panel thinks Ether (ETH) will be worth US$1,840 by 2023 before rising to US$5,824 by 2025 and then US$14,411 by 2030,\u201d Finder\u2019s latest report states.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum is expected to close the year at $1,840 based on the average prediction of the panel of 31 crypto industry specialists. The panel appears to have changed its tune toward the bearish side, following a previous optimistic prediction of $2,451 in July.\n\nMost panelists believe that \u201cETH has a huge growth potential\u201d especially with the growing interest in \u201cEthereum staking and [ETH\u2019s] exceptional low inflation rate\u201d which points to a potential short squeeze likely to culminate in a remarkable upside in the ecosystem, believes Ben Richie, the managing director at Digital Capital Management Pty Ltd.\n\nHowever, some specialists like Ryan Grace, the head of tasty tastycrypto said that like Bitcoin price, Ethereum price is bound to encounter macro headwinds which could limit its upside action in the short-term, especially with the Federal interest rates above 5%.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as $10 Billion Comes In \u2013 Time to Buy?\n\nThe Ethereum price has held still in the past 24 hours, although the altcoin has risen by 0.5% in the past hour.\n\nThis may signal an incoming rally, and with ETH standing at $1,889, it has already gained 4% in a week and by 15% in the last 30 days.\n\nIt\u2019s also attracting trading volume in excess of $10 billion, representing a marked increase to the lower levels (e.g. as low as $3 billion) it saw in early October.\n\nAs such, now may be a good time to buy, before the next potential bull market really kicks in.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as $10 Billion Comes In \u2013 Time to Buy?\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum price may have dipped in the past day, but its overall momentum remains largely strong.\n\nIts relative strength index (purple) continues to hover above 70, signalling good buying pressure that\u2019s supporting the coin\u2019s price.\n\nLikewise, ETH\u2019s 30-day average (yellow) is rising quickly towards its 200-day (blue), with a potential golden cross likely to indicate a breakout in the next few days.\n\nThe other major bullish sign is ETH\u2019s support level (green), which has reached much higher levels in the past couple of weeks.\n\nThis would suggest that ETH is unlikely to fall below $1,800 again, and with its trading volume remaining relatively elevated, it could easily further gains in the coming days and weeks.\n\nThat said, transfer data indicates that whales are generally sending ETH to exchanges at the moment, so the altcoin could have a wobble before it rises again.\n\nEither way, there\u2019s little doubt that the Ethereum price will be one of the main beneficiaries of the next bull market.\n\nThis is largely because it boasts some of the best fundamentals in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nOn the one hand, its total value locked in \u2013 at around $23.85 billion \u2013 accounts for more than half of the DeFi sector, a clear sign of its importance to DeFi, Web3 and other sub-sectors.\n\nAnd on the other hand, it continues to attract some of the most notable adoption in crypto, as attested by this year\u2019s announcements from PayPal and Coinbase, among others.\n\nThen there\u2019s the fact that ETH itself becomes deflationary during periods of peak Ethereum usage, with burning exceeding issuance.\n\n#Ethereum's total supply has once again transitioned to a deflationary state. pic.twitter.com/qz8vMDHNEy \u2014 \u1662inus \u1661ells (@MinusWells) November 6, 2023\n\nThis all points to a steadily rising Ethereum price over time, with periods of bullishness likely to benefit ETH more than other coins.\n\nAs such, ETH is likely to reach $2,000 in the next month.\n\nOther Altcoins With High Potential\n\n\n\nHowever, it\u2019s arguable that a good, diversified portfolio should include more than established coins such as Ethereum, with a number of new alts also looking promising right npw.\n\nOne of these is TG.Casino (TGC), a decentralized casino that has raised more than $1.7 million in its presale.\n\nWe have just reached $1.7 million raised in presale for $TGC \ud83c\udf8a LFG players!

        "content": "A video has surfaced on social media where Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin revealed he sold 70,000 ETH tokens during its price all-time high.\n\nButerin Acknowledges Shorting Ethereum\n\nCrypto community member, MetaMan X, published a video post on X (formerly Twitter), disclosing a conversation where Ethereum Founder, Vitalik Buterin admitted that he had sold about 70,000 ETH tokens, essentially shorting the cryptocurrency during a major all-time high.\n\nIn the podcast with American hedge fund director, Eric Ross Weinstein, Buterin spoke on the price of Ethereum and Bitcoin in 2017. During Ethereum\u2019s previous all-time high in 2017, when the price of ETH rose as high as $1,600 and Bitcoin\u2019s price was up $20,000, Buterin voiced doubts about whether the significant price surge truly aligned with the crypto market\u2019s modest achievements over the years.\n\n\u201cThe crypto space has reached half a trillion dollars, does it deserve it?\u201d Buterin stated.\n\nWhen asked if he had shorted Ethereum during the all-time high, Buterin stated that he had convinced the Ethereum Foundation to sell a considerable amount of ETH tokens, and the result of the decision made a huge impact on the cryptocurrency later.\n\n\u201cI did get the Ethereum Foundation to sell 70,000 ETH like basically at the top, and that\u2019s doubled our runway now, so it was one good decision that had a lot of impact,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nETH price at $1,886 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nCommunity Worries Over Buterin\u2019s ETH Sell-Offs\n\nMany crypto community members have raised concerns about the multiple ETH transactions said to be conducted by Ethereum\u2019s founder. Recently, Buterin was spotted making a transfer of 100 ETH, worth about $181,000 to Coinbase, one of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchanges.\n\nThe motive behind the transaction has sparked curiosity among Ethereum investors and the crypto community. Earlier in August, Buterin was also reported moving 600 ETH worth $1 million to Coinbase.\n\nHowever, the Ethereum Founder had publicly clarified in October that he had not sold any ETH tokens for personal gain since 2018. He also stated that most ETH transactions were not him selling, but rather the recipients of his charitable donations selling the ETH tokens.\n\nThe founder has also been caught in controversy over the weekend when Ethereum whistleblower Steven Nerayoff alleged that Buterin was involved in some sort of fraud involving ETH.\n\nNerayoff says Ethereum is linked to corrupt SEC officials to carry out this fraud which he says is on a larger scale than what happened with FTX. For reference, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has been found guilty of fraud charges after the exchange filed for bankruptcy in 2022 with a $9 billion hold in its balance sheet.\n\nFeatured image from Crypto News, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSolana is once again the talk of crypto, and its native coin SOL is benefiting from the attention. The price of SOL is up over 9% today, hitting a 24-hour high of $44.41.\n\nOver the past 30 days, it has exploded in value by over 88%, according to CoinGecko\u2014making it the biggest winner of all the major cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnd despite its association with the collapsed FTX crypto exchange and its criminally convicted founder Sam Bankman-Fried, experts say Solana\u2019s recent rise shouldn\u2019t come as a shock.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWidely considered a competitor to Ethereum, Solana aims to be the go-to network for on-chain applications and experiences. Ethereum proponents argue that the leading smart contract network offers greater stability and security, but Solana is objectively cheaper and faster for those wanting to build or use lending protocols, games, and other applications that utilize blockchain technology.\n\nSolana gas fees right now stand at $0.000522; to make a transaction on Ethereum, it costs $6.58 on average.\n\nFor this reason, Solana has grabbed the attention of Visa, Shopify, and developers wanting to build on the network.\n\n\u201cSolana adopts a streamlined approach, emphasizing high base layer throughput while simplifying the developer experience,\u201d portfolio manager at Yield App Akash Mahendra told Decrypt, highlighting how much data can be processed by the blockchain.\n\nMahendra added that major partnerships and institutional interest are also helping drive up the price of SOL.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that long ago that Solana was getting a bad rep. FTX, once one of the biggest and most recognizable brands in the crypto space, was heavily invested in Solana.\n\nEx-FTX boss and co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried was a prominent Solana supporter, and the company invested in numerous Solana-related projects. FTX launched a marketplace for Solana NFTs, and even co-created Serum, which at one point was considered a foundation of the Solana DeFi space. At its peak in 2021, Solana commanded a market cap of $78 billion and boasted a $10 billion DeFi ecosystem.\n\nFTX then collapsed in a highly publicized bankruptcy while holding over $1 billion in SOL. The cryptocurrency plunged as a result.\n\nBut big players still see real value in the project.\n\nIn August, Solana\u2019s payment protocol Solana Pay integrated with the e-commerce platform Shopify, allowing merchants to accept stablecoin USDC via the blockchain. This collaboration \u201ccapitalized on Shopify\u2019s influential 10% share in the U.S. online retail sector, which translates to an estimated $444 billion in global transactions,\u201d according to Mahendra.\n\nThen, payments giant Visa announced in September that it had chosen Solana\u2019s blockchain for its stablecoin ambitions. This, according to Solana Foundation\u2019s head of strategy Austin Federa, \u201cvalidates the importance of the network\u2019s unmatched speed and scalability.\u201d\n\nThese two moves were seen as bullish by investors who have since been plugging fresh cash into the project. And things really picked up in the last month.\n\nPatrick Felder, founder & CIO at Prismatic Capital, told Decrypt this was because when Bitcoin and the broader crypto market started rallying, SOL was the most deeply oversold asset in the space following news that FTX\u2019s new management might sell off large amounts of SOL.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut this, according to Felder, was \u201cmassively overblown\u201d FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) and \u201ctriggered a massive short squeeze.\u201d In the world of trading, a short squeeze is when the price of an asset shoots up unexpectedly due to short sellers (those who\u2019ve bet on the asset going down) exiting their positions.\n\nThis happened with SOL, according to Felder, as many had bet on Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX trial hurting the asset's price.\n\nThe Solana community\u2019s annual conference, Breakpoint, took place at the end of October, leading to an even bigger rally, added Felder.\n\nThe irony is that at Breakpoint last year, the price of SOL had plunged by 60% in the week following the FTX crash. Spirits were low. But now, the coin has made a stunning comeback.\n\nAs always the question is, will it last?\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "Stratis Community Votes In Favour Of Move To Ethereum Blockchain - AlexaBlockchain",
        "content": "Stratis today announces the launch of StratisEVM \u2014 a new layer one blockchain built on Ethereum. Under the plans, Stratis will bring its expertise, products and community of developers to the Ethereum ecosystem and retire the existing Stratis blockchain.\n\nThe plan is designed to accelerate innovation by making it easier to develop blockchain solutions using more widely available tooling and the interoperability capabilities inherent to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nStratisEVM is a Web-3 ready Ethereum-based proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain, featuring the native $STRAT token. StratisEVM will be a layer one blockchain, with plans to also introduce a layer two to deliver high-throughput and low finality decentralised computing. These advanced capabilities are specifically designed to support gaming and DeFi applications.\n\nCommunity voting on the proposal has just concluded following a two-week voting period. The Stratis community overwhelmingly backed the new plans with a near unanimous vote of 99.3% in favour.\n\nThe decision to launch StratisEVM is based on the following advantages it will bring to the developer, user and wider communities:\n\nIntegration\n\nChoosing an Ethereum-based framework over a bespoke platform offers immediate integration with a robust and well-established ecosystem.\n\nWorking with the Ethereum codebase means teams building on StratisEVM benefit from continuous upgrades and innovations developed by the largest decentralised developer community.\n\nThe core Stratis team will no longer need to commit such significant resources to building and maintaining developer toolkits designed for the Stratis blockchain. Instead they can focus on improving interoperability and performance in-line with the project\u2019s priority areas: gaming, DeFi, NFTs and enterprise.\n\nInteroperability\n\nThe shift to an Ethereum-based framework opens doors to enhanced interoperability and compatibility with numerous existing decentralised applications (dApps) and protocols.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain hosts a multitude of dApps, ranging from decentralised exchanges to lending platforms, which StratisEVM can interact with or utilise for added functionality and value creation.\n\nEstablishing such a wide range of interactions and partnerships on the existing platform has been challenging for Stratis and required additional development of complex and bespoke protocols.\n\nFamiliarity\n\nDevelopers are more likely to build applications on a platform that offers familiar tooling. Ethereum dominates blockchain market share and moving to the ecosystem will boost developer activity.\n\nUnder the plans, existing $STRAX token holders can exchange their tokens for the new $STRAT at a rate of 1:10. For every 1 STRAX issued on the Stratis blockchain, there will be 10 STRAT tokens issued on the StratisEVM, bringing the token supply to just over 1.53B.\n\nThe original Stratis blockchain was launched in 2016 and since that time new use cases have emerged that require micro-payments. The token supply is being increased by 1:10 to make the token more useful for these new use cases, in particular gaming.\n\nStratisEVM will feature a masternode contract that will enable new and existing masternodes to lock their collateral and continue to receive rewards as they do on the current blockchain. During the StratisEVM launch, Stratis will honour reduced collateral requirements for the original masternode operators (pre-STRAX) who remain federation members.\n\nChris Trew, co-founder and CEO of Stratis, said: \u201cSince 2016 our focus has been the delivery of a Microsoft-focused blockchain platform. However, Ethereum has grown exponentially, with record-breaking usage and capitalisation. We felt it was time to retire the Stratis blockchain so we can spend less time building tooling and more time optimizing the Ethereum infrastructure for new use cases like gaming and DeFi. It\u2019s encouraging to see the community support for the new plans and we\u2019ll be bringing a lot of experience, dApps and developers across to the Ethereum community.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cWe are continuing with our roadmap, including our NFT marketplace \u2018Stratisphere\u2019, our NFT ticketing application \u2018Ticketsphere\u2019 and plans to issue the first regulated GBP Stablecoin. We are particularly excited about the surge in mobile gaming and look forward to supporting upcoming projects via the new StratisEVM blockchain.\u201d"

This chart setup is formed to recuperate exhausted bullish momentum before the buyers take the leap. Coinciding with the market\u2019s current recovery mood, the ETH price gave a decisive breakout from the upper boundary of this pattern on November 5th. This breakout hints at the potential for a substantial rally in the near term.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Under Pressure As $400 Million Of Open Interest Wiped Out\n\nadvertisement\n\nIs ETH Price Ready to Surpass $2000?\n\nA flag pattern is often spotted at an established uptrend offering buyers a temporary break before the next rally\n\nA bullish breakout from the chart set ETH price for a potential 22% jump\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $8.6 Billion, indicating a 22% gain.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nThe bullish flag on the Ethereum price chart has been clearly defined over seven months, with the coin\u2019s price oscillating between the pattern\u2019s converging trendlines.\n\nNotably, this altcoin price has bounced off the pattern\u2019s upper boundary twice and its lower boundary four times, demonstrating its strong influence on the market\u2019s psyche. The last bounce from the lower boundary occurred on October 13th, sparking a 25% rally to the present price of $1911.\n\nThis upward movement was accompanied by a decisive break of the resistance trendline, signaling a potential conclusion to the correction trend. Currently, with a modest 1% daily gain, the ETH price is positioned favorably after the resistance breakout, poised to target the $2340 mark, which would represent a 24% upside.\n\nFurthermore, the projection from the flag\u2019s pole hints that the climb could extend toward the significant $3000 mark.\n\nETH vs SOL Performance\n\nSource: Coingape| Ethereum Vs Solana Price\n\nThe last three months\u2019 price period accentuates that Solana price recovery has outperformed the second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum.

Similar to Ethereum Classic (ETC), this coin did not perform too well during the past week. Monero (XMR): Despite a recent security breach, Monero (XMR) maintains its bullish undertone and privacy appeal, but there are no clear signs of growth in lieu of the market\u2019s overall trend.\n\nScapesMania (MANIA): New Crypto Innovation\n\nMany crypto experts pick ScapesMania as the best new project of 2023 and beyond. It manages to separate itself from the competition by offering holders a multitude of revenue streams and high potential ROIs during presale.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nCompanies and individual crypto traders looking for fast potential gains should definitely look into ScapesMania\u2019s proposition. Once the presale finishes, the price will soar, securing possible returns in the range of 400-500%. Right now, there\u2019s an active discount of close to 85%, but it won\u2019t last forever \u2013 the clock is ticking and all interested in leveraging this offer need to act fast.\n\nWhen dissecting the tokenomics and other features of ScapesMania, it becomes clear that it\u2019s the best altcoin to hold now. The innovative gaming-related core idea, impressive presale numbers, $150,000 giveaway, undying social media hype, and other positive aspects can guarantee that ScapesMania will continue on its winning journey, so it makes sense to get involved as soon as possible.\n\nJoin Presale at a Discount on the Official Site\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC): Course for a Potential Uptrend\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) is currently navigating through a high time frame range, with its price oscillating between $14.70 and $27.73. The market is witnessing a descending triangle setup on the daily chart, which traditionally bears a downward bias.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe price of Ethereum Classic (ETC) has recently breached the descending triangle setup, indicating a potential rally. This technical pattern suggests a near 30% upswing to the $20.59 level, calculated by adding the distance between the first swing high and swing low to the breakout point. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily timeframe is above 50, reinforcing the likelihood of this bullish scenario.\n\nThe forecast for Ethereum Classic (ETC) is cautiously optimistic, with the technical setup favoring an uptrend. For this to materialize, Ethereum Classic (ETC) must surmount the immediate hurdles at $17.15 and $19.99 to reach the anticipated target of $20.59. From its current position, this would represent a significant gain. However, should the price fall below the $14.70 support, a bearish outcome could ensue, potentially leading to a 30% correction towards $10.36.\n\nLitecoin (LTC): Celebrating Milestones\n\nLitecoin (LTC) has recently celebrated a significant milestone, marking its 12th anniversary with a record-setting network hashrate, which is a testament to the network\u2019s security and robustness. This achievement underscores the growing adoption and usage of Litecoin (LTC), as evidenced by the network facilitating over 180 million transactions to date.\n\nDespite these achievements, the price of Litecoin (LTC) has been consolidating within a specific range since August. The bulls have faced resistance, particularly at the $72.45 level, which has been a tough nut to crack. This resistance level is crucial as it represents a barrier to the asset\u2019s upward movement, with the price recently retracting to $69.44.\n\nThe future price movement for Litecoin (LTC) is intriguing, with the coin showing both promise and resistance. The market has demonstrated a keen interest in Litecoin (LTC), with spikes in address activity and whale transactions indicating a potential for increased market movement. However, the resistance levels at $80.10 and $93.06 remain formidable challenges. Should Litecoin (LTC) overcome these, it could pave the way for further gains, aligning with its strong market fundamentals and recent network achievements.\n\nMonero (XMR): Security Concerns\n\nMonero (XMR), the cryptocurrency synonymous with privacy and security, recently faced a significant challenge. A security breach in the community crowdfunding system (CCS) wallet led to the theft of 2,675.73 Monero (XMR), valued at approximately $384,000. This incident has raised concerns among investors.\n\nThe price of Monero (XMR) has been fluctuating within the range of $153 to $183, with a 10-day moving average of $170 and a 100-day moving average of $151. These averages indicate a relatively stable market sentiment, with the price maintaining above the 100-day moving average, suggesting a bullish undertone.\n\nThe future of Monero (XMR) price is a blend of technical resilience and market confidence. The support levels at $103 and $133 provide a strong foundation for the currency, while resistance levels at $194 and $224 represent the thresholds for potential growth. The recent security breach, while concerning, has not directly impacted the privacy mechanisms of Monero (XMR), which remain intact and continue to be a key selling point for the cryptocurrency.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe cryptocurrency market\u2019s revival is setting a dynamic stage for various coins, each with unique challenges and opportunities. Ethereum Classic (ETC) is on the cusp of a potential rally, Litecoin (LTC) is at a crossroads of consolidation and breakout, and Monero (XMR) is testing the waters of investor trust after a security hiccup.\n\nMeanwhile, ScapesMania is gearing up to disrupt the market with its novel gaming-crypto fusion. The project is set to break records after its presale finishes and the 500% ROI seems to only be just the beginning.\n\nWebsite\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram"

        "title": "Ethereum accused of being 1000 times more fraudulent than FTX - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Tue 07 Nov 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Fitah\n\nSteven Nerayoff, a former advisor to Ethereum, has publicly accused the founders of Ethereum of fraud. According to his allegations, Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin, two iconic figures in the crypto industry, were conducting fraudulent activities 1,000 times larger than SBF. The founder of FTX, now convicted, orchestrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history. But what are the reasons behind these accusations? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nEthereum founders accused of fraud\n\nSteven Nerayoff declared on X (Twitter) that the Ethereum fraud is 1,000 times greater than that of SBF. As a reminder, the FTX case is one of the biggest financial frauds in the crypto industry. Sam Bankman-Fried was implicated in numerous crimes, including the misappropriation of customer and lender funds. This led to the collapse of his crypto exchange FTX and his trading company Alameda Research.\n\nEthereum is the fraudulent elephant in the room in plain sight 1000x bigger than SBF. Joe Lubin & Vitalik Buterin have been the front with corrupt officials at the highest levels of federal agencies such as Clayton, Gensler & many others. Cover this now. \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 2, 2023 Steven Nerayoff on X (Twitter)\n\nThe FTX founder was convicted on all seven federal counts and faces a maximum sentence of 110 years in prison. He was charged with money laundering, securities fraud, wire fraud and more. Considering the frauds committed by SBF, it\u2019s hard to imagine anything worse. Yet Steven Nerayoff claims otherwise, revealing that Ethereum\u2019s founders are major fraudsters.\n\nAllegations of corruption within the SEC\n\nAccording to this former Ethereum advisor, Ethereum\u2019 s founders have allegedly bribed SEC officials. Joseph Lubin and Vitalik Buterin provided cover for corrupt officials at the highest levels of federal agencies. In particular, he cited Clayton, Gensler and many others. This would have given the project an unfair advantage on the crypto market. Ethereum executives gave bribes to the SEC to turn a blind eye to the network\u2019s ICO, he said. Ethereum could thus escape charges of violating securities law.\n\nHowever, Nerayoff provided no substantial evidence to support his allegations against Ethereum\u2019s founders (ETH). Moreover, his reputation for distorting the truth undermines the credibility of his information.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price uptrend may be exhausted for the short term, as the $35,500 level pressures BTC.\n\nEthereum price at crossroads below $1,935 mean threshold represents a make-or-break moment for the largest altcoin by market capitalization.\n\nRipple price\u2019s bullish momentum continues to build, but the supply barrier ahead may pose a challenge with $0.800 likely to hold.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has been consolidating below $35,500 for almost two weeks now, being static, with analysts attributing the slow-down in pace to the absence of ETF-related news. With its Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices have also come to a halt, facing critical barriers that will determine the next move.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin and Ethereum price rise halting makes way for layer-2 & DeFi tokens to chart over 40% gains\n\nBitcoin price marks time below $35,954\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is marking time below the $35,954 level after a steady 40% climb that began in mid-September. Exchanging hands for $35,091 as of press time, the rally seems exhausted, with the price showing reluctance around the $35,500 level. The bulls are likely to take a breather as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) position shows BTC is massively overbought.\n\nWith this outlook, it is likely that Bitcoin price could correct soon, likely for the short term, before a continuation of the primary trend. Likely targets in a downward directional bias include the $32,000 psychological level, a critical juncture having capped the upside potential for the king of cryptocurrencies since May 2022 when the Terra (UST) ecosystem fell off a cliff.\n\nThe RSI deviated from the northbound move, flattening to show complacency as buying pressure continues to weaken. This observation favors the downside.\n\nBTC/USDT 3-day chart\n\nHowever, if sidelined investors join the bull\u2019s camp, Bitcoin price could continue north, breaking past the $35,954 resistance level with a breakout objective above the $40,000 psychological level. In a highly bullish case, the gains could extrapolate for BTC to test the supply zone extending from $44,321 to $47,122, with the $48,000 handle presenting the next logical target, a level last seen in March 2022.\n\nAlso Read: Holders of $600 billion worth of BTC are asking for Bitcoin price to rally not by 15% but by 96%\n\nEthereum price on collision with $1,035 mean threshold\n\nEthereum (ETH) price\u2019s 22% uptrend that started on October 13 has the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization confronting a crucial barrier \u2013 the $1,935 mean threshold of a supply zone extending from $1,861 to $2,004.\n\nIf Ethereum price records a daily candlestick close above the $1,935 midline, it would confirm the continuation of the uptrend, setting the tone for a successful foray above the $2,000 psychological level, with $2,029 as the next logical target.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nA rejection from the $1,935 level could send Ethereum price spiraling south, potentially slipping below the $1,800 psychological level and testing the $1,748 support. Such a move would denote an 8% drop below current prices.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum net exchange deposits hits five-month peak with almost 130,000 ETH flowing to exchanges\n\nRipple price eyes 10% more gains\n\nRipple (XRP) price continues northbound, with robust higher highs and higher lows surpassing key barricades. Despite XRP being massively overbought, the primary trajectory of the RSI is still northbound, showing that momentum is still rising.\n\nIncreased buying pressure above current levels could see Ripple price test the supply zone extending from $0.7771 to $0.8199. For a confirmed uptrend, the price must break and close above the $0.8000 psychological level, with the move likely to catalyze an extension to the $0.9000 psychological level, 25% above the current price.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, with XRP being massively overbought, it is likely that the supply zone will hold as a resistance order block. The ensuing rejection could see Ripple price pull south, slipping through the $0.6968 support level and testing the $0.6242 support with bulls seeking rejuvenation. Another evaluation will be required at this point to determine the next step for XRP, considering the prevailing bullish outlook in the broader market.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price could extend gains with Ripple\u2019s likely win through $20 million settlement with SEC"

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH) showcases a breakthrough that could signify the beginning of a bullish reversal. A close examination of the ETH price chart reveals a decisive move above a crucial resistance level, potentially marking the onset of a wider market recovery.\n\nEthereum's price has recently surged past the resistance highlighted by the convergence of its 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), represented by blue and red lines, respectively. This technical event is significant; such crossovers are keenly watched by traders and typically interpreted as strong bullish signals, especially when accompanied by increased trading volume.\n\nThe positive sentiment around Ethereum is not an isolated phenomenon. Historically, ETH's market movements have had a consequential impact on the altcoin sector, with its rallies often igniting uptrends across various alternative cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis correlation can be attributed to investor psychology, where confidence gained from Ethereum's gains spills over to other crypto assets, coupled with Ethereum's foundational role in supporting numerous projects and decentralized applications.\n\nThe potential for a bull market in the wider cryptocurrency space is underpinned by Ethereum's role as a market leader. As ETH breaks through key resistance levels, it could set a precedent for other digital assets to follow.\n\nShiba Inu needs more\n\nDespite its cult-like following and fervent social media activity, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has yet to breach the elusive $0.000009 mark. A closer look at SHIB's price action and external market conditions reveals the triad of resistance the meme coin faces on its upward journey.\n\nFirst, the inability of SHIB to break through the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) stands as a stark testament to the strength of this technical resistance level. The 200 EMA, represented by the black line on the daily chart, is a critical indicator that traders monitor to gauge long-term market sentiment. In SHIB's case, this line has acted as a formidable barrier, rebuffing the asset's attempts to establish higher ground. Each approach toward this moving average has been met with rejection, indicating bearish sentiment among investors and traders alike.\n\nAdding to this technical hurdle is the robust performance of alternative digital assets. Investors, driven by a risk-reward calculus, are often lured away by cryptocurrencies that offer not only greater stability but also promise higher returns.\n\nLastly, the lack of significant movement by whales has resulted in a scarcity of market-moving events for the token. Whales have the power to sway market dynamics drastically by either injecting optimism through large purchases or triggering sell-offs. The absence of such activity creates a stagnant market environment where the price lingers in a narrow range.\n\nTurning to the daily chart, the price of SHIB has recently made a bullish crossing over of the 50-day and 100-day EMAs, shown in blue and red, respectively. This crossing can typically be interpreted as a bullish signal. However, the price encounters resistance every time it tries to advance further, aligning with the 200 EMA. The recent trading volumes show sporadic spikes but lack consistent growth, echoing the hesitation on the market.\n\nCardano finally meets resistance\n\nAs Cardano (ADA) enthusiasts witness a dramatic ascent in the coin's value, the market speculates about where this momentum might finally meet resistance. Based on the current price chart, there appears to be a significant level that could halt Cardano's impressive rally.\n\nThe critical resistance level that stands out on the daily chart is at the intersection with the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), shown as the bold black line. This level has historically been a turning point for many assets, acting as a steadfast barrier to bullish runs. For ADA, this line suggests that while the coin's momentum is robust, there may be a forthcoming struggle to push through this line.\n\nRecent movements have been notably bullish for Cardano. The price has surged upward in a steep incline, which is evidenced by the sharp angle of the green candlesticks against the backdrop of previous price action. This sort of price movement is emblematic of strong buying pressure and surging interest from investors. The volume bars, which have seen a substantial increase, support the intensity of the current run."

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens continued their bullish momentum on Thursday as the oldest crypto asset hit a 17-month high after the Fed's dovish tone. Crypto tokens posted big gains following the completion of one year of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire- FTX exchange.\n\nBitcoin was trading in red as the largest crypto token edged marginally lower, less than half-a-per cent but remained below 35,000-levels. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, was also seen in green, slightly up and hovered around $1,900-level. Majority of the altcoins were trading with decent gains.\n\nBitcoin kept on trading in a very narrow range of less than 2 per cent movement in the last 24 hours. It has now been close to two weeks. Although this means volumes in Bitcoin worldwide have started to slightly drop, any movement in its prices should mean the volumes are back in, said Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager at CoinSwitch Markets Desk.\n\n\"While BTC has been rising for a few weeks now, the ETH/BTC pair has seemed to find a little support around the 0.05 BTC per ETH mark. The little bounce back has helped other prominent altcoins as well to show some momentum on the upside price action,\" he said.\n\nOn the other hand, altcoin BLUR (+18.1%) has seen a positive price action in the last 24 hours. This could be as investors speculate it to be the world\u2019s biggest NFT marketplace by trading volumes, especially after Opensea downsized by letting go of 50% of its staff recently\n\nBarring a few exceptions, all top crypto tokens were trading sharply higher on Tuesday. Chainlink was up 6 per cent, while Toncoin surged more than 5 per cent. Dogecoin and Polygon rose 4 per cent each, while Cardano and BNB added over 3 per cent each. Among the laggards, Tron was down a per cent.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading modestly higher, rising up to $1.33 trillion-mark, as it rose marginally in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes increased more than 6 per cent to $40.46 billion.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, both BTC and ETH remained steady, while altcoins saw a rise of 5-10 per cent. This was accompanied by a decline in BTC dominance. Bitcoin is currently positioned between important support at $34,000 and resistance at $36,000, while Ethereum still has to clear a significant resistance level around $2,000, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\"The market capitalization of altcoins, excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, reached nearly $400 billion, marking a positive sign for the crypto space. It's worth noting that tomorrow, on November 8, 2023, Fed Chair Powell will deliver a speech, which could potentially introduce some market volatility,\" he said.\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\nThe Graph(GRT) is an indexing protocol, catering to data querying needs in networks such as Ethereum and IPFS. It plays a pivotal role in numerous applications within the DeFi sector and the larger Web3 ecosystem. Currently, GRT extends its support to the indexing of data from Ethereum, IPFS, and POA, with plans to include additional networks in the near future.\n\nImage: Chart-Graph\n\nOn the weekly time-frame, the GRT/USDT chart had been traversing within an ascending triangle pattern. The trend has bounced back from the bottom and is fast approaching the upper trendline with twice its average trading volumes. We could expect the momentum to continue into the coming weeks. The next resistance is expected at 0.17 USDT and an immediate support is expected at 0.12 USDT.\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "In a stunning revelation, Rain L\u00f5hmus, the founder of Estonia-based LHV Bank, has been unveiled as the owner of an Ethereum wallet holding a colossal $470 million worth of Ethereum. The intriguing twist to this story is that L\u00f5hmus has lost access to his crypto fortune, leaving him unable to recover or manage his holdings, a director at Coinbase, Conor Grogan said on the X platform.\n\nA Closer Look Into The Incident\n\nBack in February 2023, Conor Grogan brought attention to an Ethereum wallet that had remained dormant since the cryptocurrency\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) in 2014. Notably, this wallet had accumulated a staggering $470 million worth of ETH, despite never being used for a single transaction.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, in his latest post on November 7, Conor Grogan took to X to share a crucial piece of information. In a recent interview with ERR News, L\u00f5hmus publicly acknowledged that he is the owner of the aforementioned Ethereum wallet. Unfortunately, he disclosed that he had lost the keys required to access this vast fortune.\n\nL\u00f5hmus is now faced with an extraordinary predicament on how to regain access to hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency. In his interview, he expressed his openness to collaborating with anyone capable of helping him recover his locked holdings, even offering to share the recovered funds.\n\nAlso Read: Bitget Announces Plans to Invest Strategically In India-Based Start-Ups\n\nA Costly Oversight\n\nThe LHV Bank founder\u2019s story is a testament to the unpredictable nature of the blockchain world. Having originally purchased 250,000 ETH during the Ethereum ICO for just $75,000, he now faces the consequence of losing the keys to a wallet that, at its peak, was worth a staggering over $1.2 billion.\n\nNotably, in the ever-evolving crypto landscape, this situation serves as a stark reminder of the need for secure and accessible storage solutions for digital assets.\n\nWith a remarkable 628,757% gain on his investment and a previous mention of $6.5 million worth of airdrops in Grogan\u2019s earlier post, L\u00f5hmus\u2019s Ethereum wallet remains a testament to the immense potential and challenges faced by early cryptocurrency adopters.\n\nHowever, the cryptocurrency community will watch closely to see if anyone can assist him in reclaiming his digital fortune, showcasing the interconnected and community-driven ethos of the blockchain space.\n\nAlso Read: Avalanche Parent Cuts Staff By 12%, Shifts Focus to Core Activities"

        "content": "According to a recent report by Nansen, the NFT market is defying expectations as weekly Ethereum sales skyrocket, gaining attention from crypto market enthusiasts. Despite recent challenges, the world of nonfungible tokens (NFT) is thriving, with top collections and platforms experiencing record trading volumes.\n\nSo, let\u2019s take a closer look at the report and see how the investors are putting their bets on the NFT space.\n\nadvertisement\n\nNFT Sales Surge With A Remarkable Turnaround\n\nThe NFT market, which was recently plagued by news of layoffs and concerns about its stability, has witnessed a remarkable turnaround. According to blockchain analytics platform Nansen, the week ending on November 6th marked a significant uptick in NFT sales, with a staggering 68,342 ETH worth over $129 million. In contrast, the week ended on October 9, the total sales were at 29,704 ETH, the report added.\n\nIn the realm of NFT trading, Blur, a prominent marketplace, emerged as the leader over the last 30 days. NFTGo data revealed that Blur commanded a trading volume of 161,433 ETH, equivalent to approximately $305 million. OpenSea, a formidable rival, secured the second spot with a trading volume of 52,307 ETH, around $100 million.\n\nNotably, OpenSea has recently announced a massive layoff, raising concerns in the decentralized finance (DeFi) market. According to the announcement, OpenSea is drastically reducing its workforce, with CEO Devin Finzer announcing a 50% reduction in employees. This strategic move is a step towards \u201cOpenSea 2.0,\u201d aimed at improving core aspects of the platform, such as technology and user experience.\n\nWho\u2019s At The Top Of The Table?\n\nWhen it comes to NFT collections, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) stood out with the highest trading volume of 35,112.96 ETH, translating to roughly $60.92 million over the past 30 days. Following closely were Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) at 14,969.31 ETH and The Captainz at 9,964.56 ETH.\n\nIn terms of market capitalization, CryptoPunks, the iconic NFT collection, retained its crown with a market cap of 477,261.25 ETH or $876.86 million. However, it had a trading volume of 5,773.42 ETH in the last 30 days.\n\nMeanwhile, despite recent challenges in the NFT space, there has been a significant upswing in NFT traders. According to NFTGo data, in the past week, the number of traders increased by 12% to reach 42,254. Buyers witnessed a 9.61% surge, reaching 22,804, while sellers surged by 19.37% to 27,308. Remarkably, the number of wallets holding NFTs remained steady at around six million.\n\nNotably, the NFT market\u2019s remarkable resilience and surge in trading volume indicate that the sector is far from fading away. Despite recent hurdles, it continues to attract both traders and collectors, underlining its robust and growing presence in the broader crypto landscape."

During ETH\u2019s ICO, the asset sold for a mere $0.31 per coin. L\u00f5hmus paid around $75,000 for the 250k ETH. Fast forward to 2023, the value of the holding is a whopping $470 million, a growth of around 628,757%.\n\nHowever, things did not end well for L\u00f5hmus\u2019s Ethereum (ETH) holdings. Unfortunately, the banker lost access to his private keys. The development was shared on X (formerly known as Twitter) by Coinbase director Conor Grogan. Grogan had previously highlighted the whale wallet in February 2023. Grogan noted that the wallet had not made a single transaction, and its value had grown 5333X. Moreover, it received $6.5 million via airdrops alone.\n\nWhen ETH reached its all-time high of $$4,878.26 on Nov. 10, 2021, L\u00f5hmus\u2019s holdings were worth an eye-watering $1.22 billion.

        "content": "Ether (ETH) Set for 55% Surge After Key Technical Breakout, as Supply Turns Deflationary, Says This Well-Known Analyst\n\nFamous crypto data analytics firm Matrixport\u2019s head of research Markus Thielen argued in a recent report that Ether (ETH) could be set for a more than 55% surge to $3,000.\n\nEther is the second most valuable cryptocurrency in the world by market capitalization after Bitcoin (BTC) and powers the Ethereum layer-1 smart-contract-enabled blockchain, which remains the most widely used blockchain in the DeFi, NFT and broader web3 industry.\n\nIn a recently published note on defiontarget.com, Thielen pointed out that Ether appears to have now broken to the north of its downtrend from the yearly highs, and also pointed out that Ethereum network activity has improved in recent weeks, leading to the Ether supply turning deflationary once again.\n\nThielen\u2019s analysis included a chart showing that Ether appears to have broken to the north of a pennant structure that it had been in the throws of forming since late 2022.\n\nMoreover, he argued that \u201crevenues for the Ethereum ecosystem are bottoming out from depressed levels\u2026 (which) this could signal a tradeable bottom for ETH\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile revenues have only climbed back into the summer 2023 range of $30 million in weekly fees, the shocking number of just $12.1 million during the week of October 9 might be behind us\u201d.\n\n\u201cA tactical bullish trade could have merit for as long as weekly Ethereum fees stay above $30 million,\u201d he added.\n\nAs per TokenTerminal, the Ethereum network generated fees of around $36 million last week.\n\nThis recovery in network fees means a higher ETH burn rate (the majority of Ethereum network fees are burnt).\n\nIndeed, as per Glassnode, the Ether inflation rate recently hit its lowest level since August of -1.2%, having recently been as high as 0.3% in early October.\n\nThat should boost optimism that, assuming network activity remains healthy, Ether should remain a deflationary asset, boosting its long-term value proposition to investors.\n\nIf Ether was to hit Thielen\u2019s target of $3,000 per token, that would mark a surge of more than 55% from the current price just below $1,900.\n\nEther (ETH) to Outperform Bitcoin (BTC)?\n\n\n\nBitcoin has increased its market dominance over Ether in the last few weeks amid optimism about potential near-term approvals of spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) on the US, which are anticipated to attract substantial capital inflows from the traditional finance industry.\n\nAfter trending lower for most of 2023, with Bitcoin also benefiting from safe-haven demand given its status as crypto\u2019s oldest, most trusted and (arguably) most decentralized cryptocurrency, the ETH/BTC exchange rate fell rapidly in October to hit its lowest levels since June 2022.\n\nBut this exchange rate recently rallied back to the north of its 21DMA, a sign of a potential turn around.\n\nThielen argued in his latest note that Ether trading volumes are also catching up to Bitcoin, which potentially \u201csupports the view that altcoins could outperform\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile Bitcoin traded as much as 3x the volume of ETH in mid-October, this ratio has also dropped to just 2x\u201d.\n\nIf Thielen is right about a possible near-term surge in the ETH price to $3,000, then ETH/BTC could very well rise back towards resistance in 0.058 area in the near future.\n\nBut if Bitcoin continues to lead the broader market rally amid optimism about upcoming spot Bitcoin ETFs, and Ethereum network activity once again falls back, then a retest of the 2022 lows under 0.05. remains on the cards."

Has this trend persisted into the new week, or has there been a change?\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nS&P 500 trends above Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nIn the past week, the S&P 500 experienced a significant increase, causing it to outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to Santiment\u2019s trend analysis, the S&P 500 gained over 6% in value within just four days.\n\n\ud83d\udcca The #SP500 had a big week after #Bitcoin & #Ethereum have cooled down.

It also seemed like these cryptocurrencies were stabilizing after a period of strong price growth.\n\nThe recent upswing in the S&P 500 could be attributed to the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) report. Notably, the report announced that the Federal Reserve would maintain its current interest rate for the second consecutive month.\n\nThis decision has sparked speculation that the Fed may have completed its interest rate hikes. Consequently, this led to a notable increase in stock prices observed during the past week.\n\nBTC and ETH prices catch up with stock prices\n\nAs per a trend chart analyzed by AMBCrypto, Bitcoin and Ethereum had moved ahead of the S&P 500 in terms of their price trends. Despite the stock market being closed for the weekend, BTC and ETH had surpassed their previous positions.\n\nIt remained uncertain whether stock prices will resume their upward trajectory when the market reopens, but cryptocurrency prices continued to rise during this period.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum maintain uptrends\n\nOn 4 November, the daily timeframe chart indicated that Bitcoin had closed the trading session with a notable price increase of over 1%. At the time of writing, it was still trading with a slight price rise, exceeding $35,000.\n\nDespite occasional declines, Bitcoin managed to maintain its price within the $35,000 range. This was a key factor that contributed to its upward trend compared to the S&P 500.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nIn addition, an examination of Ethereum\u2019s daily timeframe chart revealed an even more impressive performance. As of press time, Ethereum was trading with a substantial price increase of over 2%, surpassing the $1,800 mark.\n\nThe chart also indicated that Ethereum had been consistently on an upward trend for several consecutive days."

        "content": "As the cryptocurrency market evolves, investors are on the lookout for the next golden opportunity that will turn $50 into $5,000. Cardano (ADA), Ethereum Classic (ETC), and VC Spectra (SPCT) all offer unique potential for investors. In this article, we delve into the insights and predictions for these top altcoins to determine which is the golden investment opportunity many are seeking.\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCardano Price Prediction: How High Can Cardano Go In 2023?\n\nCardano (ADA) has repeatedly tested the crucial $0.294 support this year. However, following the late-October surge, Cardano (ADA) rose to $0.300 by November 1. The top ten cryptocurrency faces increasing resistance from the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) at $0.256, $0.270, and $0.300, respectively.\n\nGiven the current sentiment around ADA, experts\u2019 Cardano price prediction expects ADA\u2019s price to rise to confront a resistance at the confluence of the 50-day EMA and the horizontal line at $0.450, provided that Cardano\u2019s (ADA) $0.294 support level remains intact.\n\nOn the other hand, per the bears\u2019 Cardano price prediction, should ADA\u2019s price see a daily candlestick close below the $0.294 support, ADA could witness a highly volatile downtrend. Thus, these analysts believe Cardano (ADA) could fall to $0.095 by the end of the year.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT): A Standout Performer with a 587.5% Surge\n\nIn the dynamic realm of cryptocurrency investments, VC Spectra (SPCT) has emerged as a formidable player, capturing the attention of investors with an astounding price surge of 587.5%. This decentralized hedge fund stands out for its innovative investment approach, combining cutting-edge AI-driven strategies with active portfolio management.\n\nVC Spectra\u2019s unique approach empowers it to identify promising opportunities within the blockchain and technology sectors, positioning it as a preferred choice for those seeking profitable ventures in the crypto market. VC Spectra\u2019s native token, SPCT, is a BRC-20 token that operates on the Bitcoin blockchain. What sets it apart is its deflationary model, mirroring Bitcoin\u2019s burn mechanism.\n\nThis remarkable performance has seen SPCT rise from $0.008 in Stage 1 to $0.055 in Stage 4 during its public presale. However, the journey for VC Spectra (SPCT) investors is far from over. Analysts project further growth for VC Spectra, with the potential to exceed the projected $0.080 price by the public presale\u2019s conclusion.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, SPCT is set to get listed on major exchanges, propelling it to new heights. Analysts foresee a 100x growth potential at this juncture that could turn $50 into $5,000. VC Spectra (SPCT) has demonstrated its potential, making it a top crypto to buy for investors looking to navigate the crypto market\u2019s ever-evolving landscape.\n\nEthereum Classic Prediction: Can ETC Surge Further In 2023?\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) has witnessed a 13.32% rise in the first ten months of 2023, rising from $15.69 on January 1 to $17.78 by November 1. Is this modest surge enough to make Ethereum Classic (ETC) the best coin to invest in?\n\nRegarding the Ethereum Classic price prediction, market analysts believe ETC is primed for a sustained rally to $20.00 by the end of November. This Ethereum Classic price prediction is based on the belief that the SEC is set to approve the spot Bitcoin ETF applications before it.\n\nOn the other hand, ETC experts\u2019 Ethereum Classic price prediction foresees a price drop for ETC to $11.20 by December. This Ethereum Classic (ETC) prediction is based on historical price patterns.\n\nWith experts having mixed forecasts about the future of Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Cardano, investors have turned to VC Spectra\u2019s SPCT as the best crypto to buy.\n\nLearn more about VC Spectra (SPCT) and its presale:\n\nBuy Presale: https://invest.vcspectra.io/login\n\nWebsite: https://vcspectra.io\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/VCSpectra\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/spectravcfund\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Solana outperforms Ethereum since September, Coinbase led US market with 2.2 million in October SOL net buys - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nThe ratio between Solana and Ethereum jumped from 0.011 to nearly 0.025, breaking the ratio from just before FTX\u2019s collapse.\n\nThe two tokens are often compared, given they are both Layer 1 tokens.\n\nNet sales was led by Coinbase exchange in October, recording up to 2.2 million tokens in US sales, Kaiko research shows.\n\nSouth Korean exchange Upbit was the leader outside the US, recording nearly 4 million in net SOL token sales.\n\nSolana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) tokens are often compared, considering their heft in the Layer 1 (L1) space. Their performance over the past two months has been significant, with both ecosystems rising along with the broader market as talks of an imminent bull market continue to trend.\n\nAlso Read: Solana Breakpoint conference delivers 20% gain for SOL holders this year as four-day gathering concludes\n\nSolana price outperforms Ethereum\n\nSolana (SOL) price has outperformed Ethereum (ETH) by a long way, recording almost 135% in gains since September relative to the latter\u2019s 23%. This is almost a six-fold difference. With the move, the SOL price of $40.26 is testing levels last seen in August 2022, while ETH is revisiting the July 23, 2023 high of $1,894.\n\nSOL/USDT 1-day chart, ETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nData from Kaiko highlights the striking performance of SOL, with Solana price rising almost 115% since mid-October. It signifies a robust recovery from the FTX-infused depths around the $10.00 range in November 2022, with the research pointing to a significant growth in network activity, particularly where liquid staking token protocols such as Jito, the second liquid-staking Protocol on Solana, are concerned. Data shows that Jito has recorded up to $12 million in funding and a total value locked (TVL) of about $224 million.\n\nSOL DeFiLlama\n\nThe research shows the ratio between Solana and Ethereum has more than doubled since October 18, jumping from 0.011 to nearly 0.025 and thereby breaking above the ratio from just before the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s (SBF) cryptocurrency empire.\n\nCoinbase exchange led the US market with a net buying of 2.2 million SOL tokens (worth approximately $88.57 million at current rates) since the rally began on October 18. Binance, the largest cryptocurrency trading platform by trading volume, followed behind Coinbase in the US until the onset of November when the broader market witnessed an acceleration in buying pressure.\n\nSOL is also at the very top of the list for the most-traded altcoins on US-based exchanges in 2023, outpacing Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), Polygon (MATIC) and Ripple (XRP).\n\nSOL trading volume relative to other altcoins in US-based exchanges\n\nMeanwhile, Korea\u2019s leading exchange, Upbit, has bucked the trend when considering the expansive crypto industry outside the US, recording almost 4 million SOL tokens in net sales in October.\n\nNevertheless, it is worth mentioning that Upbit has frequently been a controversial platform owing to the characteristic tendency of Korean traders to pump and dump trades. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju at some point in 2021 acknowledged that Korean traders favor pumping and dumping altcoins specifically, attributing the habit to the region's \"very strict capital controls, blocking arbitrage opportunities between global exchanges.\"\n\nFun Fact 3.\n\n\n\nKorean crypto traders love pumping & dumping altcoins, ironically. Got this clip from my Korean friend. pic.twitter.com/63Ewssu5VO \u2014 Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) March 30, 2023\n\nOverall, however, the Kaiko research concludes that what started as a tough year for altcoins in the US has improved significantly across October, especially beginning on the 18th."

        "content": "This is not an endorsement of cryptocurrency or any specific provider, service or offering. It is not a recommendation to trade or use any services.\n\nFinder analyses expert price predictions each quarter. We conducted our most recent survey in October 2023 in which our panel of 31 crypto industry specialists shared their thoughts on how Ether (ETH) would perform through 2030.\n\nAll prices mentioned in this report are denominated in US dollars.\n\nOn average, our panel thinks Ether (ETH) will be worth US$1,840 by 2023 before rising to US$5,824 by 2025 and then US$14,411 by 2030.\n\nEther (ETH) price predictions for 2023, 2025 and 2030\n\nETH's price is expected to rise to US$1,840 by year-end 2023, according to the average prediction from Finder's panellists.\n\nThis price prediction was down significantly from US$2,451, the average prediction for Ether's price by year-end 2023 from our July 2023 survey.\n\nThe panellists also predict ETH will hit US$5,824 by 2025 and US$14,411 by 2030. Both of these predictions are lower than our panellists' average predictions in our July 2023 survey, which were US$5,845 by 2025 and US$16,414 by 2030.\n\n\"ETH has a huge growth potential,\" Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler, says. \"Growth is [currently] limited by high rates in TradFi. In [the] case of reaching a soft landing by US authorities, ETH['s] price will increase dramatically, but not until the middle of next year.\"\n\nBen Ritchie, managing director at Digital Capital Management Pty Ltd, is also bullish on ETH and the Ethereum ecosystem on a longer time horizon, but feels we could see a lower price for ETH in the short term.\n\n\"The growing interest in Ethereum staking and [ETH's] exceptionally low inflation rate suggest the possibility of a short squeeze in the future, hinting at promising upside within the Ethereum ecosystem\" Ritchie says. \"[However,] we've adjusted our short-term Ethereum price forecast downward mainly because of potential economic challenges that could lead to a more cautious approach in the overall markets.\"\n\nRyan Grace, head of tastycrypto, has a forecast similar to Ritchie's.\n\n\"Like BTC, Ethereum and broadly crypto as an asset class face macro headwinds that likely limit upside price action in the near-term,\" Grace says. \"With short-term rates at +5%, there's less incentive for capital flows into crypto.\"\n\nPav Hundal, lead market analyst at Swyftx, argues that ETH's price is currently low because it's simply following a pattern we've seen before.\n\n\"Historically, as we approach a Bitcoin halving, Ethereum tends to revisit its price valuations from earlier that year,\" Hundal says. \"This trend aligns with the repeated observation that Bitcoin's dominance (proportion of the total [crypto] market capitalisation) swells as we near the halving event. We can anticipate that there will be a potential shift from altcoins [like ETH] back into Bitcoin in the lead-up to the halving.\"\n\nHow high and low will ETH go in 2023?\n\nThe average peak price our panellists predict ETH will hit by year-end 2023 is US$1,932, with some predicting it will climb as high as US$2,800.\n\nThe average lowest price our panellists predict ETH will hit by year-end 2023 is US$1,352, with some predicting it will fall as low as US$885.\n\n45% of our panellists feel that ETH's price will rise into the $1,751\u2013$2,000 range before the close of 2023, while 69% think the lowest ETH's price will dip is into the $1,251\u2013$1,500 range.\n\n\"While Ethereum (ETH) is still likely to follow where Bitcoin (BTC) leads in terms of overall price trends, its intrinsic value and utility set it apart,\" Nick Ranga, senior cryptocurrency and forex analyst at ForexTraders.com, says. He thinks we'll see ETH at $2,250 before the year is out. \"Due to the wealth of use cases for the Ethereum network and the Ether cryptocurrency, it's future is assured.\"\n\nDamian Chmiel, senior analyst and editor at Finance Magnates, thinks we could see ETH's price as high as $2,000 before the year is out but also as low as $1,000.\n\n\"I wouldn't expect any significant movements in Ethereum for the rest of this year,\" Chmiel says. \"I anticipate it will consolidate between $2,000 and $1,000.\"\n\nDesmond Marshall, MD at Rouge International and Rouge Ventures, believes we could see ETH at $1,200 before the year is out, as he thinks regulatory uncertainty around the asset as well as macroeconomic factors may be holding its price down.\n\n\"The new ETH futures-linked ETFs were a major disappointment to the ETH supporters,\" Marshall says. \"As the regulatory confusion lurks, general retail investors and institutions are weary of jumping on the bandwagon too soon, esp[ecially] with a dwindling job market, employment stats, and a dipping stock market.\"\n\nIs now the time to buy, hold or sell ETH?\n\nAlmost half of our panellists (48%) believe it's a good time to hold ETH, while just over two-fifths of them (41%) believe it's time to buy Ethereum.\n\nOnly 10% think it's time to sell ETH.\n\n\"Ethereum has great intrinsic value,\" Natalja Zaharova, head of operations at FXOpen Pty Ltd, says. \"Its network keeps becoming bigger.\"\n\nPaul Levy, senior lecturer at the University of Brighton, is also bullish on ETH and believes that now is the time to hold the asset.\n\n\"Ethereum is still much talked about, mostly for good reasons,\" Levy says. \"[It's] rooted in iterative innovation, often releasing new features and enhancements that are grounded in decent testing regimes.\"\n\nJeremy Britton, CFO of BostonTrading.co, also believes ETH is a hold, but he's somewhat bearish on ETH for technical reasons.\n\n\"Changing from POW to POS has made ETH less decentralised and less 'crypto',\" Britton says. \"Some of ETH's competitors may cut ETH's market share as people want lower fees and more decentralisation.\"\n\nAlexander Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FXPro, thinks it's time to sell ETH based on his technical analysis.\n\n\"Ethereum has tried to stay afloat above 50- and 200-week MAs,\" Kuptsikevich says. \"It went below them, and this move may continue in the following weeks.\"\n\nIs ETH overpriced, underpriced or priced fairly?\n\nThe vast majority of our panellists feel that ETH is either underpriced or fairly priced.\n\nThat is, 43% feel that ETH is currently underpriced and 40% feel that it's priced fairly.\n\nOnly 17% feel that it's overpriced.\n\n\"Ethereum will become the global settlement layer,\" Martin Froehler, CEO at Morpher, says. \"Ether is the first yield-bearing deflationary asset.\"\n\nTristan Thoma, director of government and payments at AlphaPoint, believes that ETH is priced fairly, pointing out that ETH's price will likely continue to increase as crypto becomes more widely adopted.\n\n\"The price is still likely to increase over time as [the] crypto user base grows globally with more confident compliance structures,\" Thoma says. \"[This should] result in [an] organic price increase.\"\n\nJohn Hawkins, senior lecturer at the University of Canberra, thinks ETH is overpriced, despite the uses of the Ethereum network.\n\n\"Ethereum has more uses, [than] Bitcoin,\" Hawkins says. \"[However,] the crypto mania is dying down; Google Trends show interest declining since 2021.\"\n\nHow will the Ethereum community respond to the \"over staking\" of ETH?\n\n41% of our panellists believe that the Ethereum community will not provide a significant response to the \"over staking\" of ETH.\n\nJust over a quarter of our panellists (26%) think the Ethereum community will propose curbing the influence of liquid staking protocols like Lido, while 22% believe the Ethereum community will respond by suggesting a cap of ETH deposits on the beacon chain.\n\nThe following is commentary from some of our panellists who voted \"Other\" in response to the question in the chart above.\n\nMatiu Rudolph, COO at Layer One X, points out that an Ethereum Improvement Protocol \u2013 EIP 7514 \u2013 \"has been proposed as a short term solution to slow down growth of the active validator set.\"\n\nJosh Fraser, co-founder of Origin Protocol, says \"the Ethereum community will come up with solutions to over staking, such as Origin Ether (OETH). Instead of just earning yield from staking rewards, users can find ways to optimise yield in innovative ways, such as optimizing yield through DeFi and liquid staking.\"\n\nBen Ritchie, managing director of Digital Capital Management Pty Ltd, says \"In our perspective, we strongly advocate for the Ethereum community to prioritise thorough due diligence when selecting staking platforms, particularly those aligned with the principles of decentralisation, such as Rocketpool and similar projects aiming to promote network decentralisation.\"\n\nWhen will the tokenisation of real-world assets hit the mainstream?\n\n41% of our panellists think the tokenisation of real-world assets will go mainstream by 2030, while 31% believe we will see this by 2025.\n\nOnly 10% of our panellists think it will go mainstream by 2024 and 7% believe it will never go mainstream.\n\nJosh Fraser believes we'll see the tokenisation of real-world assets go mainstream by 2030.\n\n\"It's not unlikely that total value locked in NFTs will surpass that of DeFi,\" Fraser says, \"as NFT value will include real estate, IP, luxury goods, and beyond.\"\n\nWill the market cap of ETH flip that of BTC?\n\n43% of our panellists don't see ETH's market capitalisation ever flipping BTC's.\n\n23% think it will happen but not until 2030, while 20% are unsure.\n\nRuadhan O, creator of Seasonal Tokens, believes that Ethereum has more utility than Bitcoin, but that ETH won't flip BTC because ETH will be competing with the native coins of other smart contract platforms.\n\n\"Ethereum remains expensive to use [and] it will lose market share to cheaper alternatives,\" O says. \"Bitcoin isn't useful. Nobody needs a Bitcoin. There's no demand for Bitcoin's utility at a lower price, because there's no utility. This is why Bitcoin isn't losing market share to other proof-of-work coins.\"\n\nJosh Fraser feels differently and believes this will happen by 2030 or later.\n\n\"It's likely ETH will eventually flip Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization,\" Fraser says.\n\nMeet the panel\n\nMethodology\n\nFinder surveyed 31 fintech specialists in October 2023. Panellists are able to answer as many or as few questions as they like, meaning the number of responses received varies by question. 29 panellists gave their price prediction for ETH by year-end 2023, 2025 and 2030. Panellists may own some cryptocurrencies, including ETH. All prices are listed in USD per ETH.\n\nChanges to methodology: In 2021, this research was conducted using the simple mean of all answers supplied to Finder. From 2022, we switched to using the truncated mean, with the top and bottom 10% of responses removed in order to attain a more consistent result. Any 2021 results quoted in this analysis have also been re-calculated using the truncated mean."

        "title": "Rain L\u00f5hmus Misplaces Key to Ethereum Millions - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Rain L\u00f5hmus, the founder of Estonia\u2019s LHV Bank, has reportedly lost access to a digital fortune. The banker\u2019s crypto holdings, a staggering 250,000 units of Ethereum (ETH), are currently out of reach due to a misplaced private key. The value of this digital cache stands at an estimated $470 million, a sizeable asset that has remained untapped since the early days of Ethereum\u2019s introduction to the market.\n\nConor Grogan, a notable figure at cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, shed light on this digital enigma through a recent social media update. Grogan pointed out that the ETH trove, belonging to L\u00f5hmus, has been dormant since Ethereum\u2019s inception. The news swiftly captured the attention of the crypto community, with many highlighting the potential and pitfalls of blockchain technology\u2019s security features.\n\nDespite the vastness of his digital wealth, L\u00f5hmus openly admitted in a conversation with ERR that the access codes to his wallet elude him. He has not invested substantial effort into their recovery. Yet, he extends an open invitation to those skilled enough to unlock his digital vault, offering a share in the bounty as a reward for their services.\n\nL\u00f5hmus\u2019 current predicament underscores a recurring challenge he faces: the misplacement of passwords. This incident casts a spotlight on the inherent vulnerabilities that can accompany the use of blockchain technology. Despite this, it\u2019s clear that L\u00f5hmus\u2019 initial foray into cryptocurrency, with an investment of just $75,000, has seen an astronomical return, rising in value by over 628,000% since Ethereum\u2019s early days.\n\nMoreover, at Ethereum\u2019s peak market price in November 2021, L\u00f5hmus\u2019 holdings would have scaled the heights of $1.22 billion. Even with the market\u2019s fluctuations, the current valuation remains impressive. Additionally, Grogan\u2019s previous insights revealed that L\u00f5hmus\u2019 wallet had also accrued $6.5 million from airdrops, further adding to the untouched wealth.\n\nThe narrative around lost or inaccessible crypto assets is not unique to L\u00f5hmus. Ledger\u2019s recent introduction of a cloud-based key recovery service called Ledger Recover speaks to a broader issue within the cryptocurrency community. Developed in response to criticism and demand, the service, supported by blockchain protection platform Coincover, offers a subscription-based seed phrase recovery solution. This move by Ledger aims to mitigate the risk of loss in an industry where billions in value lie dormant due to misplaced access credentials.\n\nIndeed, research from Glassnode suggests that nearly 10% of the entire Bitcoin supply might be irretrievable, with other sources suggesting figures as high as 25%. This represents a significant portion of digital assets that potentially reduce the circulating supply of these currencies."

        "content": "An Ethereum wallet with 250,000 ETH, valued at nearly $474 million, is linked to Rain Lohmus, the founder of Estonia\u2019s LHV Bank.\n\nThe wallet, inactive since the 2014 Ethereum ICO, has received significant value from airdrops, now seeking assistance to recover the lost access keys\n\nBlockchain Detective Work Identifies Likely Owner of a Lucrative Ethereum Wallet Coinbase director Conor Grogan has made a significant discovery, linking a mysterious and valuable Ethereum wallet to its probable owner through skilled blockchain investigation.\n\nAfter delving into SIMETRI Research and deciphering clues left in a recent Vikerraadio interview, it\u2019s emerged that Rain Lohmus, founder of Estonian banking powerhouse LHV, is the unfortunate soul who has lost the keys to this digital treasure chest. With a hoard of 250,000 ETH, now valued at a colossal $474 million, Lohmus\u2019s misfortune becomes a matter of public intrigue, as noted in a tweet:\n\nOne mystery solved: This address (which now holds $450M of crypto) belongs to Rain Lohmus, founder of LHV Bank Unfortunately he lost his keys and can't access these 100s of millions. If you can help him recover them somehow, he's willing to split them with you https://t.co/wYLAU9gKzb pic.twitter.com/0A1nIjFSyn \u2014 Conor (@jconorgrogan) November 6, 2023\n\nThe story of Lohmus\u2019s Ethereum wallet is a testament to the astronomical potential for growth in the cryptocurrency realm. Initially filled with ETH purchased during Ethereum\u2019s Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2014 for a mere $75,000, this wallet represents an investment that has exploded in value by over 6,300 times. Yet, despite the stunning value appreciation, these digital funds remain out of reach\u2014a locked safe without a key.\n\nCompounding the awe surrounding this untouched Ethereum wallet is the fact that it has accumulated more than $6 million in airdrops. These bonuses, awarded simply for holding ETH, have further swelled the already bulging crypto vault. As a result, Lohmus\u2019s inaccessible digital wealth is not just a tale of early investment foresight but also of the serendipitous gains that can accrue in the ever-dynamic blockchain ecosystem.\n\nRead also: Base Layer 2: Coinbase\u2019s Transparency Push Ignites Collaboration on Ethereum\n\nAn Open Plea for Cryptographic Recovery\n\nRain Lohmus\u2019s conundrum has led to an open call for solutions. Among various propositions, his most intriguing idea is to venture into the realm of artificial intelligence, contemplating the creation of an AI endowed with his memories in a bid to regain entry to his virtual wealth. In a world where cryptocurrency and technology merge in unforeseen ways, Lohmus\u2019s challenge underscores the dramatic narrative of loss and potential recovery within the digital age.\n\nFrom a personal perspective, the plight of Rain Lohmus serves as a stark reminder of the importance of safeguarding digital assets. In an era where the line between the physical and virtual continues to blur, Lohmus\u2019s story is not just a lesson in asset security but also a beacon of hope for those who believe in the power of technology to overcome even the most daunting of hurdles.\n\n."

        "content": "As the crypto market brims with anticipation in the run-up to the potential approval of an Ethereum ETF and VeChain\u2019s upcoming announcement, a new crypto sensation is making waves: BlockDAG (BDAG). This emerging PoW project, currently in its presale, stands poised for a 5000% surge in 2024, outshining both Ethereum and VeChain in terms of potential gains.\n\nAnalysts Are Optimistic About Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has ignited fervent discussion in the crypto community about the possibility of Ethereum ETF approval. BlackRock, the world\u2019s leading asset manager with an unparalleled record of 576-1 for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) approvals, lodged its application for an Ethereum ETF in November 2023. The decision is due by May 23.\n\nAs the deadline draws near, speculation is rife on whether Ethereum will follow in Bitcoin\u2019s footsteps regarding ETF approval. Analysts are optimistic that the Ethereum ETF will be given the green light. For example, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas gives it a 70% chance. The approval of Ethereum ETFs will likely cause an altcoin rally in the coming months.\n\nVeChain\u2019s Price Surges in the Run-Up to the Upcoming Announcement\n\nMajor hype is currently surrounding VeChain (VET), a breakout crypto token that has seen substantial gains amid the market-wide surge led by Bitcoin. Another factor that likely led to the VeChain (VET) price surge is the upcoming announcement slated for MWC 2024 Event in Barcelona.\n\nAnalysts are confident that VeChain\u2019s upward momentum will continue. According to Ali Martinez, VeChain (VET), price could reach $0.054 this week, experience a brief correction until June, and embark on a bull run targeting $0.70 by November 2024. The analyst sets an even more ambitious projection for VeChain, foreseeing VET to exceed its all-time high of $0.2782 within a year.\n\nBlockDAG Poised for 5000% ROI \u2013 A Global Sensation In the Making?\n\nBlockDAG, a revolutionary newcomer in the crypto landscape, is causing ripples of excitement throughout the investor community with its cutting-edge technology inspired by Kaspa.\n\nWhile sharing the foundation with Kaspa, the BlockDAG network significantly evolves from Kaspa\u2019s protocol. Specifically, BlockDAG employs a hybrid consensus mechanism designed to speed up transactions without compromising security. Furthermore, BlockDAG offers an exceptional confirmation speed of 10 blocks per second and can process multiple blocks simultaneously, further enhancing its efficiency and performance.\n\nAside from its groundbreaking technology, BlockDAG has already demonstrated strong ROI potential, with the BDAG price surging by 5000% from the initial presale price of $0.001 to the launch price set to $0.05 per token.
