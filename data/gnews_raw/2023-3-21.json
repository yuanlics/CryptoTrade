        "title": "Ethereum Now Deflationary for 2 Months Straight - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ethereum has been deflationary for two months straight due to a surge in on-chain activity on protocols such as Uniswap and Blur.\n\nThe network pushed an upgrade (EIP-1559) in August 2021 that meant transaction fees would be burned instead of directed to the network\u2019s miners \u2014 a precursor to Ethereum\u2019s switch to proof-of-stake last September.\n\nEIP-1559 at times inspired Ethereum to produce deflationary blocks (more ETH burned than distributed). But the asset has now been solidly deflationary every day since late January, per network tracker ultrasound.money.\n\nPrior to that, Ethereum had briefly entered deflationary status in November 2022, about two months after Ethereum\u2019s Merge cut issuance by more than 90%, before slipping back to inflationary by December.\n\nUltrasound.money only maps Ethereum\u2019s deflationary status since the Merge \u2014 making its recent streak the longest on record for this particular tracker.\n\nResearch analysts at Compass Point Research and Trading said in a research report earlier this month that the increase in burned ETH has largely been driven by increased Uniswap usage in response to centralized exchange uncertainty, as well as continued usage of the Blur NFT marketplace.\n\nUniswap tops the ETH burned leaderboard in the past 30 days, with roughly 8,766 ETH ($16 million) burned in that span. NFT marketplace and aggregator Blur has burned about 6,535 ETH ($11.9 million) over the last month.\n\n\u201cThe amount of ETH burned has seen a steady climb over the past two months due to an increase in on-chain activity, with the largest surge occurring on March 10 as fear surrounding USDC\u2019s backing caused a depeg,\u201d Blockworks Research Analyst Sam Martin said.\n\n\u201cOn-chain users scrambled to dump USDC for USDT, which led to the largest daily burn since the Merge\u2019s implementation.\u201d\n\nRead More: Blur Still Sees Record NFT Volumes Even After Crypto Airdrop\n\nThe depegging of USDC followed the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). It plunged to as low as $0.87 before ultimately returning to its $1 peg.\n\nThe failures of financial institutions in recent weeks, including Silvergate, SVB and Signature Bank, have prompted crypto industry participants to advocate for decentralized financial infrastructure as a more secure and reliable alternative.\n\nCompass Point\u2019s March 9 report predicted that the introduction of layer-2 blockchains can take market share away from so-called \u201cETH killers\u201d and bring users back to the Ethereum network.\n\n\u201cWe continue to believe that L2 scaling and liquid staking growth have the potential to be significant catalysts for Ethereum this year, and help drive on-boarding of users, adoption and overall demand and activity of the network,\u201d analysts wrote.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum as a deflationary asset, explained - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "What is a deflationary cryptocurrency? Although cryptocurrencies are often promoted as investment opportunities, their primary purpose was originally to serve as an alternative form of currency. Considering this narrative, the rules of supply and demand apply to cryptocurrencies as to fiat currencies. An undergraduate economics student might say the basics of money, economy and market forces is balancing supply and demand. How much of an asset is in circulation versus the demand \u2014 how many people want that particular asset \u2014 helps decide its price. This equation between supply and demand underlies the fundamentals of all economies and also applies to cryptocurrencies. Deflationary cryptocurrency is one where the value of the crypto increases due to a reduction or stagnation in supply. This ensures that the coin\u2019s market value is attractive for more people to invest in and can be used as a store of value. While deflationary cryptocurrencies look more attractive, not all are designed that way. Many well-known cryptocurrencies are not deflationary. In addition, there is often no supply limit to them. Some are disinflationary because inflation gradually reduces over time due to its tokenomics. Bitcoin (BTC), for instance, won\u2019t be deflationary until all 21 million coins have been mined. Ether (ETH) was not deflationary until the \u201cMerge\u201d happened in September 2022. Related: Inflationary vs. deflationary cryptocurrencies, Explained\n\nHow does Ethereum fare against other deflationary tokens? Developers of tokens create deflationary mechanisms during the design of the economic model behind the token. The economic model \u2014 tokenomics \u2014 can be fundamental to how stakeholders add and accrue value in a Web3 ecosystem. The supply and demand dynamics of a token are decided at the level of development. Deflationary characteristics like burn mechanisms are decided as the economic model underlying the token is being developed. This can be a point-in-time process like with Bitcoin or an evolving mechanism like with Ethereum. When creating Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto ensured there would only be a finite supply of 21 million. Once 21 million Bitcoin are mined, no new BTC can be created. This limited supply has helped the narrative that Bitcoin is a true store of value compared with fiat currencies that increase supply due to central bank monetary policies. In contrast, Ethereum had an inflationary supply at its inception. Ether supply was increasing at an annual rate of 4.5%. However, after the Ethereum Merge that saw it move from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, it is now a non-inflationary asset due to its burn rate. The number of Ether burned in maintaining the network activity is more than the amount of Ether entering circulation. Implementing the EIP-1559 protocol has altered the economic nature of the Ethereum token by incorporating the burning of a fraction of the gas fees per transaction. As a result, some experts argue that Ethereum has become more deflationary than Bitcoin. As deflationary tokens are considered a better store of value, new tokens created for both protocol and application tiers may be designed to be deflationary.\n\nHas Ethereum\u2019s transition to a deflationary token made it a more desirable asset? Investments in deflationary cryptocurrencies can yield growth and returns for investors. But being deflationary alone may not be a criterion to be identified as a better investment. Due to their supply cap, deflationary tokens are typically perceived as more valuable by holders and investors. This was also demonstrated by the rise of nonfungible tokens (NFTs), where the rarity of the NFTs often decided the prices. Limited supply driving prices higher was also true with the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), where some three-digit ENS names were sold for even more than 100 ETH. Ethereum may not necessarily be classified as a better asset after it became deflationary. Ethereum has a rich ecosystem that drives transactions on the chain, and as more Ether gets burned in the process, it causes deflation. An unused Ethereum blockchain wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve this economic feat. The underlying chain fundamentals must remain strong for Ethereum to thrive as an investment. A chain with strong fundamentals typically has a developer ecosystem to create many applications that users widely adopt. As users flock to these applications, developers are encouraged to continue innovating. The resulting network effect would make Ethereum deflationary, making it a more attractive investment asset."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe Ethereum network has a lot going for it\u2014it\u2019s decentralized, reliable, supports smart contracts written in a programming language familiar to many crypto developers, and is home to a thriving decentralized finance (DeFi) industry.\n\nHowever, Ethereum is also slow and expensive to use, and will remain so unless users opt to move to another blockchain (like Solana, Fantom or Avalanche), or until planned Ethereum upgrades speed things up within the next couple of years.\n\nWhile the world waits, a third fix has arisen: scaling solutions. These are pieces of software that sit atop the base layer of a blockchain, in this case Ethereum, to speed things up. Arbitrum is one such scaling solution, and it\u2019s become a popular venue for Ethereum users to complete their transactions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn March 23, 2023, Arbitrum plans to airdrop its new ARB token, allowing holders to vote in decisions related to the protocol. In so doing, Arbitrum is enacting its long-awaited transition to a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization).\n\nArbitrum is cheap and quick to use, and relays all transaction information back to the main Ethereum blockchain. While Ethereum manages a mere 14 transactions per second, Arbitrum races ahead at 40,000 TPS. Transactions cost several dollars to complete on Ethereum, while they cost about two cents on Arbitrum.\n\nAnd Arbitrum also supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), meaning that Ethereum DeFi developers can integrate their decentralized applications (dapps) with Arbitrum without having to make any modifications.\n\nArbitrum was created by Offchain Labs. The company raised $120 million in a Series B funding round in September 2021.\n\nHow does Arbitrum work?\n\nArbitrum\u2019s development documentation says that this is the most important graph to understand:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nArbitrum workflow. Image: Arbitrum\n\nPut simply, people and smart contracts ask Arbitrum\u2019s blockchain to do something by placing transactions into the chain's \u2018inbox\u2019. Then Arbitrum processes it and outputs a transaction receipt. How Arbitrum processes that transaction\u2014what determines its \u2018chain state\u2019\u2014is decided by the transactions in its inbox.\n\nRight now, Arbitrum processes Ethereum transactions through a method called an optimistic rollup, and settles these on a sidechain before reporting back to Ethereum. Let\u2019s break that down.\n\nWhat is an optimistic rollup?\n\nA rollup is a type of data compression technique for blockchain transactions. It involves \u2018rolling up\u2019 batches of transactions into a single transaction.\n\nThe benefit of this is that a blockchain need only process a single transaction\u2014the rolled-up transaction\u2014instead of confirming each individual transaction contained within the rollup. This saves time\u2014multiple transactions are confirmed at once, so you do not have to wait until the blockchain gets around to your transaction\u2014and money, since the blockchain only has to confirm one transaction.\n\nAn \u2018optimistic\u2019 rollup is a specific technique for rolling up transactions. To speed things up, optimistic rollups assume that the transactions contained within the rollup are valid. It is possible to contest transactions through a dispute resolution mechanism if a validator suspects fraudulent behavior. (Optimistic rollups are separate from \u2018zero knowledge\u2019 rollups, which bypasses a dispute resolution mechanism by validating transactions before they are added to the rollup).\n\nOptimistic rollups are the present *and future* of Ethereum scaling. We explain why here:https://t.co/FG0OGC8TJB \u2014 Arbitrum (\ud83d\udc99,\ud83e\udde1) (@arbitrum) December 17, 2021\n\nArbitrum\u2019s optimistic rollups are settled on a proprietary sidechain. A sidechain is a blockchain that is connected to a main chain; in this case, Ethereum. Arbitrum collects batches of transactions, settles them on its sidechain, and then feeds the transaction data back to the Ethereum blockchain ledger.\n\nArbitrum says that any transactions confirmed through this process are rubber stamped with the \u201cAnyTrust Guarantee\u201d\u2014when all the validators agree with the validity of transactions contained within a block. Validators stake ETH before they can confirm transactions; by putting money on the line, they are incentivized to act honestly.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUnlike other rollup networks, like Boba or Loopring, Arbitrum does not have a token. Offchain Labs claims the network does not need one, since all transactions on the sidechain are settled with ETH, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nArbitrum has been integrated into several decentralized finance protocols, such as SushiSwap, Curve and Abracadabra. Data from DeFi Llama show that $2 billion worth of cryptocurrency is locked up within Arbitrum\u2019s smart contracts. Approximately 30% is from decentralized exchange (DEX) SushiSwap.\n\nThe project\u2019s blockchain, Arbitrum One, is in mainnet \u201cbeta\u201d, which allows Arbitrum\u2019s developers \u201cvarious levels of control over the system\u201d, including \u201cthe ability to pause the system\u201d. Offchain Labs plans to eliminate these controls once it is certain the project is robust.\n\nHow to use Arbitrum\n\nYou can use Arbitrum through a decentralized application, like Aave, 1inch or Gnosis Safe, or directly on Arbitrum\u2019s token bridge. For the token bridge, you can deposit funds to the Arbitrum network after you\u2019ve connected your Web3 wallet. It takes about 10 minutes for deposits to clear.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to pay an Ethereum gas fee\u2014at Ethereum\u2019s rates. To deposit under a cent of ETH to Arbitrum, MetaMask wallet quoted us $5.41 in gas fees."

        "title": "Op-ed: The unspoken Ethereum revolution: Are EOAs becoming obsolete? - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Under the radar, one of the most significant changes to the Ethereum ecosystem has been announced with little to no community reaction. Account abstraction is a core advancement in web3 account management, but the current roadmap brings a new goal \u2014 to remove Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) entirely from the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe term account abstraction refers to the process of abstracting away the complexity of a web3 account to create a more user-friendly experience for the end user. Initially, the goal was to generalize the web3 account model so that all accounts are treated similarly \u2014 regardless of whether they are EOAs or smart contract accounts. However, the Ethereum Foundation appears to have decided that there is no room for EOAs in the ecosystem\u2019s future, favoring smart contract wallets as the default account model for users.\n\nEIP-4337 & Account Abstraction\n\nSecurity Fellow for the Ethereum Foundation, Yoav Weiss, announced the launch of EIP-4337 while speaking at ETHDenver. The update to the Ethereum network upgrades the capabilities of smart contract wallets with elements of account abstraction, including decentralized bundlers, token fee payment, an alternative mempool, and other account abstraction features.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin originally introduced the EIP in September 2021 when he shared a concept on the Ethereum message board with the following message:\n\n\u201cAn account abstraction proposal which completely avoids the need for consensus-layer protocol changes, instead relying on a separate mempool of UserOperation objects and miners running either custom code or a bundle marketplace.\u201d\n\nHowever, one key aspect of EIP-4337 that has seemingly gone unnoticed by many is the move toward removing EOAs entirely. The documentation for the EIP on the Ethereum Foundation website states that a core motivation for the upgrade is to \u201ccompletely remove any need at all for users to also have EOAs.\u201d\n\n\u201cAchieve the key goal of account abstraction: allow users to use smart contract wallets containing arbitrary verification logic instead of EOAs as their primary account. Completely remove any need at all for users to also have EOAs.\u201d\n\nCryptoSlate reached out to several wallet providers, but none were willing to discuss the potential elimination of EOAs entirely, given the lack of timeframe from the Ethereum Foundation. As of press time, the Ethereum Foundation has not responded to attempts for comment.\n\nWhat is an EOA?\n\nAn EOA on Ethereum is a specific kind of account managed by a user who holds the private key, unlike a smart contract account. Essentially, an EOA serves as a user\u2019s cryptographic identity on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling them to hold, send, and receive ETH, NFTs, or other tokens and interact with smart contracts.\n\nAn EOA is identified by a unique public address from its private key. Unlike a smart contract account, an EOA has no code or logic associated with it. However, it can still sign transactions to initiate transfers, deploy smart contracts, or interact with existing smart contracts on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe main distinction between an EOA and a smart contract account lies in their control. An EOA is managed by an external entity using a private key, while a smart contract account is controlled by the smart contract\u2019s code and follows the rules specified within that code.\n\nDo we need EOAs?\n\nEOAs are the most tried and tested type of blockchain account. Popular software wallets such as MetaMask and hardware wallets like Ledger, Tezor, and SafePal are all founded in EOA accounts. Removing EOAs would dramatically impact such projects and require large-scale code updates.\n\nWhile the issue of onboarding new users into web3 \u2014 by requiring them to safely record and store a complex private key or long seed phrase \u2014 is a widely accepted problem, removing a core component of the Ethereum ecosystem poses a drastic solution to the problem.\n\nFurthermore, removing EOAs would bring countless potential issues that need to be addressed \u2014 including the loss of simplicity, increased complexity, higher transaction costs, compatibility issues, security concerns, EVM fragmentation, and even a potential decrease in adoption due to increased friction.\n\nI am not suggesting that all of the above issues are insurmountable. However, the path to removing EOAs will include problems that have yet to be conceived. Furthermore, as Ethereum sits at the heart of the web3 ecosystem, removing EOAs from the Ethereum network will likely lead to compatibility issues across the entire EVM landscape.\n\nProblems removing EOAs\n\nIn a bear market, it is easy to advocate for the use of smart contracts \u2014 which use, on average, more gas than EOAs due to the complex logic used in the execution of the code. As of press time, the cost of gas on Ethereum is 12 GWEI ($0.40), including the network base fee.\n\nThe chart below shows the change in the average gas price paid per transaction since the network was launched. Throughout the bull run 2021 \u2013 2022, gas rose to a high of 305 GWEI and averaged around 120 GWEI, some ten times higher than it is now. Should EOAs be removed entirely, the cost of transacting on the Ethereum layer-1 blockchain network would almost certainly increase.\n\nHowever, the advancing progress of Ethereum scaling solutions \u2014 such as Polygon and dedicated industry-specific layer-2s like Immutable \u2014 will be even more vital to the network should transacting on the base layer become prohibitive.\n\nConcerning the other issues identified, the changing landscape of regulatory guidance also needs to be considered. Recently, the European Parliament passed an act on the Internet of Things (IoT) industry \u2014 requiring all smart contracts to contain a \u2018kill switch\u2019 and therefore include \u2018proxy upgradeability.\u2019 Article 30 of the legislation has the following requirement:\n\n\u201cThe deployment of smart contracts for others in the context of an agreement to make data available shall comply with the following essential requirements[\u2026] Safe termination and interruption: ensure that a mechanism exists to terminate the continued execution of transactions: the smart contract shall include internal functions which can reset or instruct the contract to stop or interrupt the operation to avoid future (accidental) executions.\u201d\n\nThis means that any smart contract wallet would have to contain a function that would allow the developer to remove the account \u2014 eliminating the self-sovereign nature of the account if this were implemented by anyone other than the account owner.\n\nFurthermore, if Ethereum moves away from EOAs entirely, any EVM chain would need to implement the same functionality \u2014 or risk losing compatibility with Ethereum Mainnet. The implementation across other chains would unlikely be synchronized, resulting in a fragmented ecosystem and potentially incompatible dApps.\n\nProjects that currently have full compatibility with multiple EVM chains could lose access to some networks during the transition.\n\nEOA Innovation\n\nSo why remove EOAs? The Ethereum Foundation appears to have given up the potential to innovate in the EOA space with the call to remove EOAs entirely. However, I advised a project called Intu in 2022 that is doing precisely this, and it is unlikely to be the only one. For total transparency, I was paid for my time advising the project, but I have no incentive for Intu to succeed other than believing in the team\u2019s vision.\n\nThe point of this article is not to shill any solution or create FUD within the Ethereum ecosystem. Instead, I wish to raise awareness for this problem and facilitate debate and coordination within the space.\n\nI do not believe we should have statements from the Ethereum Foundation declaring the removal of EOAs without there first being a proper public process. Such a process would ensure that EOAs need to be removed, what the timeframe looks like, and how all potential security, compatibility, and usability issues would be solved prior to the transition.\n\nIt is also critical to emphasize that the removal of EOAs is not confirmed. Ethereum is a decentralized ecosystem without any centralized controlling party. However, the Ethereum Foundation holds a lot of sway within the developer community. Therefore, I believe it\u2019s important to continue this conversation for the health of the ecosystem.\n\nI understand the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s point of view. I simply wish for the conversation to be more openly held to ensure we move toward account abstraction with our eyes fully open. As Paul Saffo so wisely said, \u201cStrong convictions, weakly held.\u201d\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price is showing a very bullish signal right now, with a couple of key resistance levels getting broken to the upside. If the breakout is valid, things could look much better for the crypto market in the coming months.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nThe Daily Chart:\n\nOn the daily chart, the price has been rallying since a sharp rebound from the 200-day moving average around the $1400 mark. It has climbed above the 50-day moving average located around the $1600 level, before breaking through the higher boundary of the large symmetrical triangle pattern.\n\nCurrently, the key $1800 resistance level is also seemingly getting tested, and the price could soon target values above $2000, especially the $2300 level, in the coming weeks if the current breakout is valid.\n\nOn the other hand, in case a fake breakout occurs, a pullback towards either of the 50-day or 200-day moving averages or the $1300 support area could be expected.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart:\n\nLooking at the 4-hour timeframe, the recent price rally becomes more clear. The cryptocurrency has been struggling with the higher boundary of the symmetrical triangle and the $1800 level over the last few days, with the latter yet to be broken to the upside.\n\nThe RSI indicator also demonstrates a bearish divergence between the recent price highs, which could point to a possible correction in the short term. The $1680 and $1500 levels could be possible turning points for the price in case a bearish move materializes.\n\nHowever, from a price action perspective, ETH is seemingly willing to continue higher, considering the last two 4-hour candles, which are breaking above the $1800 area.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nEthereum Coinbase Premium Gap\n\nWith a banking crisis seemingly on the horizon, investors are getting worried about the potential effects on the crypto market.\n\nInteresting signs regarding American investors\u2019 recent behavior have emerged. The Coinbase premium gap chart shows a huge spike that recently occurred, demonstrating the gap between Coinbase\u2019s ETH/USD pair and Binance\u2019s ETH/USDT pair. Positive values indicate higher buying pressure in the U.S., while negative values are associated with selling pressure.\n\nIf this behavior continues, the market would likely sustain its uptrend in the mid-term, and a new bull market could begin. However, if the value declines in the coming days and falls below zero, investors should be cautious, as it could be an early sign of a bearish reversal."

Conor revealed that up to 636,000 ETH worth $1.15B+, equal to 0.5% of all circulating supply, will not be recovered again.\n\nThe Coinbase director categorized these losses as Ethereum typos, user errors, and buggy contracts.

It marked the first collaboration between the two companies.\n\nThe first round of the transaction was facilitated by OpenSea, with RealT imposing \u201cheavy restrictions\u201d around the float of the initial fractionalization offering, according to Remy Jacobson, the co-founder at RealT and one of two chief executives at the businesses. A second round will follow later.\n\nRead more: The Crypto Native\u2019s Guide to Real Estate Investing\n\nIt\u2019s not the first such instance of an NFT-enabled property sale for Roofstock, which has a Web3-focused division that aims to make inroads into the property sector.\n\nThe process is similar to Roofstock\u2019s previous tokenized real estate sale of a home in Alabama last month.\n\n\u201cRealT acquires properties sourced by Roofstock into C-Corps which then sell tokenized shares to investors,\u201d the spokesperson said in an additional statement. The idea is to use the tokenized equities originated in the US to provide blockchain-based exposure to investors in other countries.\n\nA spokesperson disclosed metrics behind the fractionalization of the NFT by RealT:\n\n670 unique token holders snapped up a total of 722 orders\n\nThe blockchain transaction process took two minutes and 46 seconds\n\nThe average ETH-based purchase equated to about $298.\n\nThe partnership relies upon creating a separate Wyoming LLC tied to each single-family asset the company has available for sale in its inventory, which acts as a shell for a corresponding wallet holding the buyer\u2019s NFT on Ethereum \u201cthat has [its] token ID associated with the smart contract,\u201d said Sanjay Raghavan, vice president of Web3 initiatives at Roofstock.\n\n\u201cThe property in question can then be bought and sold on various NFT marketplaces, resulting in instantaneous sale and settlement,\u201d the statement said.\n\nEach buyer holds a \u201csoulbound\u201d NFT, according to Raghavan, a non-transferrable token, meaning that the underlying blockchain mechanics are permissioned in nature.\n\nEach property NFT, as a result, \u201cgets marked with a KYC flag,\u201d Raghavan said, and the prospective owner \u201ccan go to OpenSea or any other marketplace where the asset is listed and purchase the NFT.\u201d\n\nEther collected through RealT\u2019s tokenization offering this week partially divides ownership of the property acquired for 218,000 USDC on OpenSea.\n\nThe process facilitating the sale of the Atlanta-area home \u2014 which has two bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms and a total of 1,524 square-feet \u2014 is being billed as the beginning of a partnership between the two companies, which is kicking off at a time when US regulators are keeping a close eye on crypto. And when murmurs of a real estate bubble waiting to burst have been percolating.\n\nBoth executives said they\u2019re putting in place measures to ensure compliance with the relevant US authorities as the outlook for digital asset oversight remains largely mixed.\n\n\u201cBlackrock is saying tokenization is the future, and you can be sure the SEC is listening,\u201d Jacobson said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "MetaMask Institutional is set to be an avenue for the creation of new Ethereum validators after announcing a new staking marketplace for its institutional clients.\n\nInstitutions that make use of MetaMask\u2019s institutional-grade wallet and custody service will be able to manage Ether (ETH) staking through four vendors \u2014 ConsenSys Staking, Allnodes, Blockdaemon and Kiln. The marketplace aims to simplify access and management of solo staking, allowing institutions to become Ethereum network validators.\n\nMetaMask Institutional (MMI) has been live since October 2021, providing a platform that offers a wider set of controls and functionality more suited to organizations and businesses. As Cointelegraph previously explored, MetaMask\u2019s retail wallet was no longer suited for users or institutions that were managing millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe service\u2019s new staking marketplace will look to simplify the complexity of institutional staking, which features varying fees, terms and conditions, rebates and reporting standards.\n\nJohann Bornman, MMI product lead at ConsenSys, told Cointelegraph that the firm had seen a shift from liquid staking to 32-ETH staking, which he believes is not only driven by Ethereum\u2019s Merge upgrade in 2022 but the looming Shanghai/Capella upgrade.\n\nShanghai will unlock deposit withdrawals for Ethereum validators, allowing solo stakers who have staked the required 32 ETH to withdraw their tokens and have access to accrued staking rewards. Up until this point, only liquidity provider pools allowed users to deposit and withdraw smaller amounts of ETH.\n\nRelated: \u2018Multichain future is very clear\u2019 \u2014 MetaMask to support all tokens via Snaps\n\nBornman said the upgrade has the potential to prove the \u201crewards profile and time horizon\u201d for staking ETH, which influences confidence in Ethereum staking:\n\n\u201cWe believe this staking rate has the potential to increase rapidly in the ensuing years. Over the near term, we have seen a marked increase in Eth2 staking by institutions over the last several months, and this trend will only continue, given the recent upgrade.\u201d\n\nAs a result, MetaMask Institutional rolled out its staking marketplace to provide institutions with a direct avenue to becoming Ethereum validators by staking 32 ETH.\n\n\u201cOur focus is to solve for Eth2 staking, given how important we believe data validation of Ethereum is today and will be in the future. We have designed the service to be able to simply and seamlessly expand onto on-chain ETH staking solutions.\u201d\n\nThe launch of the staking marketplace will coincide with the roll-out of an advanced MMI dashboard, including institutional controls, portfolio management, digital asset monitoring with built-in profit-and-loss and performance analytics as well as transaction reporting.\n\nMetaMask Institutional rolled out access to ETH LP pool staking through the popular Lido and Rocket Pool protocols in January 2023, giving institutions initial access to decentralized finance (DeFi) pool staking.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Account abstraction\u2019 supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that crypto wallets need a makeover, and fast. But as the pieces and players leading this makeover emerge, so too is a fight over what to call the effort.\n\nSome call it account abstraction, others call it EIP-4337.\n\n\u201cWe call it a smart wallet,\" Argent cofounder and CEO Itamar Lesuisse told Decrypt. \"It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nArgent, along with Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe), is at the forefront of the account abstraction movement, making crypto wallets easier, and smarter, to use.\n\nThe story of account abstraction, or smart wallets, dates back as far as 2016 with Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-86, and there have been many other related EIPs along the way.\n\nIt's a movement that's attempting to change the current wallet standard, called Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) like Metamask, to a smart contract-based one. Whenever you go about your crypto business, you currently need to sign your EOA wallet each and every time you execute a transaction. It's also risky, due to the unique demands of private key management.\n\nAccount abstraction provides far more flexibility for crypto wallets. Instead of individually signing 10 different transactions, for example, a smart contract wallet could batch all of these transactions into one click.\n\nThese new types of wallets could also mean adding features like recurring payments or, in the case of crypto, recovering lost private keys. Argent solved for this in 2018 with something called social recovery. Wallet users would tap friends or family members to help get back their wallets back should they lose the keys.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLike the smartphone, Lesuisse and his team mean to bring crypto wallets out of the landline era and into the world of programmable money. Another analogy that the Argent chief uses is (ironically) when people first began moving the cash in their wallets into bank accounts.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, there was a piece of software that could do stuff for us to make it easier to transfer or make it more secure,\u201d he said.\n\nLike banking, smart wallets refer to just about anything that we can program our money and accounts to do without needing our intervention.\n\nVisa turns to smart wallets\n\nThe trend is also turning heads at payments giant Visa.\n\nIn a new deep dive report on self-custodial crypto wallets, Visa wrote that \u201cEthereum is designed for push payments\u201d rather than the more intuitive and automated \u201cpull payments.\u201d\n\nThe former refers to manual payments made by the account holder and the latter to payments by which money leaves an account automatically, like auto-payments for student loans or paying your mortgage every month.\n\nSmart wallets would essentially usher in more of those programmable pull payments to crypto, and make it look a lot more like how we use money in the bank.\n\n\u201cIt's like blockchains took all these sensibilities away that we were fully expecting and using non-stop in the world. Blockchain sort of ripped off all that from the developer's toolbox,\u201d StarkWare co-founder and CEO Uri Kolodny told Decrypt. \u201cAccount abstraction is saying, \u2018guys, can we please have those very sensible tools back in our hands?\u2019\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKolodny\u2019s team is behind StarkNet, a speedy layer-2 network built on Ethereum, and rolled out a wallet browser extension back in 2021 with Argent called Argent X.\n\nAs part of its tinkering in the smart wallet space, Visa also turned to the layer-2 solution to experiment with so-called delegable accounts.\n\n\u201cThe most beautiful thing about the Visa project is that we only became aware of it when they first posted their amazing research,\u201d StarkWare co-founder and president Eli Ben-Sasson told Decrypt. \u201cThey looked around, and realized that they needed to start from a place both where they will have a global scale needed for their customer base and also has the account abstraction or, as we like to call it, smart wallets, out of the box.\u201d\n\nA delegable account, per Visa\u2019s research, would essentially integrate auto-payments into a crypto wallet and could come with a series of constraints, such as making the payments monthly or putting a limit on how much can be pulled from the wallet.\n\nBeyond the traditional use cases like those that Visa has in mind, smart wallets would also be supremely useful in the world of on-chain gaming.\n\n\u201cIf you play games, you probably wouldn't want to sign a transaction every five seconds, every time you are killing a player, winning new updates, and then paying for the transaction,\u201d said Lesuisse. \u201cWith account abstraction, you can program what we call a \u2018session key\u2019 and say, \u2018hey, I will let that game sign for me for the next hour.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s still early days, of course, and custodial wallets like Coinbase Wallet or the original crypto wallet MetaMask still dominate the space.\n\nBut as the idea of account abstraction (or simply smarter wallets) gains more attention among users as a viable alternative, the Web3 heavyweights could face some serious competition.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

Despite this seven-month high, the network hasn\u2019t appeared to heat up and create notable transaction barriers due to high demand. This is a good sign that ETH has a door open to $2,000 and beyond.\u201d\n\nDespite the price jump, Santiment says that Ethereum\u2019s transaction fees fell below $2 when ETH hit a seven-month high compared to rising above $8 earlier this month when the second-largest crypto fell to a two-month low.\n\nA Twitter survey conducted by Santiment over the weekend also indicated that there are more people who believe Ethereum will rise above $2,000 first than those who think it will drop below $1,600 first. Nearly 10% of the respondents said they see Ethereum soaring above $2,000 next while 5.2% said they see ETH falling under $1,600 next.\n\nOn Bitcoin (BTC), Santiment further says that March\u2019s rally is legitimate. According to Santiment director of marketing Brian Quinlivan, Bitcoin\u2019s rally has coincided with the banking sector\u2019s meltdown.\n\n\u201cWith the calendar past the halfway mark in March, Bitcoin has gone on another tear, breaking above $27,800 for the first time since June, 2022.\n\nSo why did prices manage to soar? Well, there were a few different key events in the first half of March.\n\nThe most obvious appeared to be the collapse of one of the larger US banks, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). And it appears this has caused massive ripple effects among the banking sector, in general.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Ethereum's Shanghai hard fork upgrade was delayed from March to early April and after Shanghai, Ethereum's roadmap includes the \u201cSurge\u201d \u201cVerge,\u201d \u201cPurge,\u201d and \u201cSplurge\u201d updates. In reality, the longer these intermediate steps to achieve scalability take, the greater the likelihood that competing networks will demonstrate efficacy and possibly establish a competitive advantage.\n\nAnother potentially concerning issue on the minds of investors is the real chance of price impact when validators are finally able to unlock their 32 ETH deposits following the completion of the Shapella hard fork. While it is impossible to predict how many of the 16 million ETH currently staked on the Beacon Chain will be sold on the market. There is a compelling argument in favor of the transition to liquid staking platforms, as they can use liquid staking derivatives on other decentralized finance networks without sacrificing their staking yield.\n\nTraders could construct a narrative based on regulatory uncertainty, especially after U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler's September 2022 statement that proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies could be subject to securities laws. In February 2023, the SEC reached an agreement compelling the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken to cease offering crypto staking services to U.S.-based clients, and the exchange also paid $30 million in disgorgement.\n\nCorrelation versus application-focused tech companies\n\nTo understand why Ether gained 15% in less than three days after briefly trading below $1,400 on March 10, traders must switch from a price-based analysis to a market capitalization comparison. On March 10, Ethereum\u2019s market cap closed at $175 billion.\n\nOracle, SAP, and Salesforce are similar to Ethereum in that their software enables users to access shared computing resources. This is in contrast to chipmakers Nvidia and TSMC, infrastructure providers Microsoft and Oracle, and technology companies Apple and Cisco that all heavily rely on equipment.\n\nETH vs. Oracle (ORCL), SAP (SAP), Salesforce (CRM). Source: TradingView\n\nThe market capitalizations of Oracle, Salesforce and SAP are comparable to Ether's at $233 billion, $188 billion and $149 billion, respectively. Ultimately, centralized and decentralized solutions permit businesses to integrate their proprietary software so that all third parties and relevant departments can consult, process, share and store data.\n\nConsidering the past six months of data, Ether's price has performed similarly to those companies. The drop below $1,400 on March 10 was illogical if the correlation between application-focused tech stocks and the price of Ether remains valid.\n\nETH\u2019s total value locked sticks at $30 billion\n\nThe total value locked (TVL) of the Ethereum network was $24 billion on November 24, 2022, and increased by 30% to $30 billion by March 21, 2023. Therefore, if no other factors influence the price, one could anticipate a 30% price increase during that six-month period. Except, that was not the case on March 10, when Ether traded at $1,400, representing a mere 8% increase from six months prior and indicating a disconnect between the value deposited in the network's smart contracts and the ETH price.\n\nThis 22% difference between the 30% increase in TVL and the 8% increase in ETH price indicated that Ether's true value should have been near $1,700, a level that was reached three days later on March 13, 2023. This simple model excludes a number of variables that influence supply and demand and the resulting price level, but it does provide an indication based on historical data.\n\nRelated: Coinbase submits petition to SEC explaining that staking is not securities\n\nEther's deflationary mechanism is in full force\n\nOn November 10, 2021, the price of Ether was $4,869, a record high for the cryptocurrency. However, a great deal has changed since then, including the burning of 3,016,607 ETH via Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559. This equates to an additional $5.4 billion in capitalization that would have otherwise been created, thereby adding to the supply side and restraining price appreciation.\n\nCurrently, market leader Bitcoin (BTC) is trading down 59% from its $69,000 all-time high. That does not necessarily mean Ether should reduce the gap versus Bitcoin, but it shows how discounted ETH currently stands at $1,780. The deflationary standard paves the way for Ether\u2019s perception as a scarce digital asset, which is particularly promising during inflationary periods in the global economy.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "You can think of an algorithmic stablecoin as a bucket of water left outside with a water level marked on the inside. To keep the water inside the bucket at exactly the same level, you set up a mechanism that adds or removes water depending on how far the water level has deviated from the mark. This is controlled by a computer algorithm such that if it rains and the bucket begins to fill up, the algorithm instructs the mechanism to release water out of the bottom of the bucket until it reaches the water level mark. Conversely, if it\u2019s a hot day and water evaporates out of the bucket, the computer algorithm would instruct the mechanism to add more water to the bucket until the correct level is regained."

        "content": "The Arbitrum ARB governance token airdrop is one day away and will mark the beginning of its transition into decentralization.\n\nPrior to its token launch, the Ethereum layer-2 network had been governed by New York startup Offchain Labs \u2014 the developer behind the protocol.\n\nArbitrum is an optimistic rollup scaling solution on Ethereum. Scaling solutions are designed to ease congestion and prices of gas fees on the Ethereum network.\n\nRather than executing a transaction on Ethereum, the transaction is instead sent to Arbitrum, whose throughput capacity is seven to 10 times greater than that of Ethereum.\n\nFollowing Arbitrum\u2019s Nitro upgrade, there has been an uptick in transactions on-chain, recently overtaking Ethereum in daily transactions.\n\nThere\u2019s currently $2 billion locked inside Arbitrum-powered protocols compared to Optimism\u2019s $1 billion, per DeFiLlama. Decentralized derivatives platform GMX and exchange Uniswap command the most value. Ethereum native dapps Aave and Curve have also launched on the network, among others.\n\nRising usage only amplifies the need for decentralization. According to Blockworks Research, ARB will allow for decentralized governance over the Arbitrum protocol, similar to Optimism\u2019s OP token.\n\nARB holders will vote on all aspects of the protocol including upgrades, inflation adjustments, as well as capital allocations (including grants).\n\nAlmost 12% of the total airdrop supply will be distributed to Arbitrum users and a tad over 1% of will be given to DAOs building on top of the network.\n\n43% to the Arbitrum DAO treasury overseen by the protocol\u2019s community governance.\n\n27% to the Offchain Labs team and future advisers.\n\n17.5% to Offchain Labs investors.\n\nA security council will also be established to make swift decisions when a normal governance process may be too slow.\n\n\u201cThe security council, while removing some element of decentralization, is meant as a backstop in case of emergencies,\u201d Blockworks Research said. \u201cSince Arbitrum, and rollups in general, are still in their infancy it\u2019s not enough to say they are truly 100% secure especially as new upgrades get added.\u201d\n\nToken holders will elect two groups of six security council members (totaling 12) every six months, each who will have private keys to a multsig that will control the protocol\u2019s primary smart contract.\n\nAn eligible candidate for the council must be a member of the DAO and receive support from 0.2% of votable tokens. Chosen members will receive a $5,000 stipend in the form of ARB tokens.\n\nHow much trust is baked into Arbitrum?\n\nMain trust concerns around Arbitrum are in its state validation and upgradability. Arbitrum did not respond to Blockworks\u2019 request for comment.\n\nState validation refers to the proofs used or how the network decides which transactions (network state) are valid.\n\n\u201cIn Arbitrum\u2019s case, they have fraud proofs enabled, but only by whitelisted validators and used interactive proofs which take many transactions to solve,\u201d Blockworks Research said.\n\nAlthough enabling fraud proofs is much better than having none at all \u2014 as in the case of Arbitrum\u2019s competitor Optimism \u2014 it would be more ideal to have permissionless proofs.\n\nAnother risk is the upgradability of Arbiturm\u2019s smart contract, as seen with Jump Crypto\u2019s counter-exploit of the Wormhole hacker last month. A smart contract is considered to be most secure if it can not be upgraded, which is not the case for both Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise the fed funds rate by 25bps to 4.75%-5% during the FOMC meeting on Wednesday. It will be the second consecutive 25bps rate hike, pushing borrowing costs to new highs since 2007. Traders anticipate a further increase in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices due to the banking crisis.\n\nBillionaires Elon Musk and Bill Ackman, economists, and investors believe the central bank should pause the monetary tightening to bring financial stability after the collapse of three US banks and the takeover of Credit Suisse. Investors must keep a close watch on new economic forecasts and dot plot possible further rate hikes this year.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOn-Chain Data Indicating Potential Correction in Bitcoin Price\n\nBitcoin is in the early bull market cycle and the recent rally above $28,000 clearly proves it. Moreover, on-chain indicators such as CryptoQuant\u2019s On-chain P&L Index and inter-exchange flows indicated a bullish Bitcoin narrative.\n\nThe Bitcoin Bull/Bear Market Cycle metric indicates a possibility of a price correction as it reaches near the Overheated Bull area. Thus, investors must exercise caution due to the sudden increase in Bitcoin price in a considerably short period.\n\nThe Bitcoin Short-Term Holders SOPR metric has jumped above 1.5. It indicates investors are booking profits at a remarkable profit margin of 7.6%. It is the highest since November 2021, when Bitcoin was trading at $64K. Typically, values over \u20181\u2019 indicate more short-term investors are selling at a profit.\n\nBitcoin Exchange Inflow metric indicates a significant increase in Bitcoin inflows into crypto exchanges as the BTC price rallied above $28,000, reaching the highest levels in 2023. Generally, a high value indicates higher selling pressure in the spot exchange. Thus, a correction in Bitcoin price is expected.\n\nThe Bitcoin Miner to Exchange Flow metric shows that miners have been contributing to these inflows amid the banking crisis, especially after the shut down of crypto-friendly Silicon Valley Bank. The miner reserves have fallen again in March after selloff in January.\n\nBitcoin Exchange Inflow \u2013 Spent Output Value Bands (%) metric indicates massive whale activity. A considerable proportion (33%) of Bitcoin flowing into exchanges has been from whales. This suggests that whales have been dominating exchange inflows recently.\n\nEthereum Price Correction\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum Exchange Inflow indicates possible ETH price correction and other on-chain metrics remain mixed. ETH price is expected to witness selling pressure amid the Shanghai upgrade and Bitcoin downfall.\n\nSome analysts predicted a move toward $2000 in the short-term, but will continue to face resistance near the psychological level.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Price Set For $35,000 After US Fed Rate Hike Decision: Bloomberg"

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThe price of cryptocurrencies increased over the weekend as bitcoin and Ethereum reached their highest levels in months this week. While Ethereum trades close to the 2022 September highs, Bitcoin nearly reached $27,000, which is its highest level since early June. Both the leading assets of the cryptocurrency industry seem to be performing well.\n\nEthereum Could Outperform Bitcoin in Coming Cycle\n\nAccording to Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal, the technicals and fundamentals of Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, indicate that it could significantly outperform Bitcoin (BTC) in the upcoming cycle. Pal claims to be keeping a watch on the Ethereum against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) chart in a recent interview on the cryptocurrency-focused YouTube channel Altcoin Daily.\n\nAccording to the macro expert, the ETH/BTC pair is coiling inside a wedge, and a breakout could drive ETH into a surge that puts Bitcoin in second place. According to him, the ETH/BTC pair needs to overcome resistance at about 0.077 BTC ($2,115) in order to verify the breakout.\n\nETH/BTC is currently trading at 0.0639 BTC ($1,755). On the fundamentals of Ethereum, the Real Vision CEO thinks that the entire addressable market is much larger than Bitcoin\u2019s.\n\nSimilar Prediction Made Earlier\n\nIn 2021, a similar forecast that ETH would overtake Bitcoin was made. The explanation given was that Ethereum is a programmable blockchain, which implies that those who possess the necessary technical know-how can use it to trade not only ether tokens but also any other digital asset, including bitcoin. Furthermore, ETH offers the added benefit of being able to sell and buy NFTs.\n\nFollowing this in 2022, numerous analysts believed that ETH would unquestionably overtake BTC when they heard that the Ethereum Mainnet would merge with the Beacon Chain proof-of-stake system.\n\nHowever, all of these were just predictions and BTC continues to be the top dog among the crypto assets."

        "title": "Arbitrum aims to empower its community through governance token launch - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "It\u2019s official \u2014 there\u2019s a new Layer-2 token on the block.\n\nArbitrum, a leading contender in the field of Layer-2 scaling solutions for Ethereum (ETH) has recently unveiled the launch and airdrop of its native governance token, ARB.\n\nSince its launch in 2021, the network has become one of the largest projects without a token, fueling excitement and anticipation for its impending launch.\n\nARB to drive Arbitrum governance\n\nArbitrum is an Optimistic Rollup solution that shifts network operations away from the Ethereum mainnet while still maintaining Ethereum-level security. It runs on its own blockchain and allows developers to deploy smart contracts that can process a higher number of transactions per second, thus lowering overall fees.\n\nAccording to the latest data from L2 Beat, Arbitrum currently dominates the L2 wars, holding 55% of the market share in terms of total value locked (TVL). Arbitrum\u2019s total value of assets locked has risen by more than 20% in the last seven days to $3.85 billion, coinciding with high-network activity on the network as well potential upside of the scheduled airdrop.\n\nThe growth of Arbitrum\u2019s TVL and its dominance is a good indicator of its thriving ecosystem, with leading protocols such as GMX, Uniswap, Camelot and many other DEXs operating on the network. In contrast, alternative Layer-2 competitors such as Optimism\u2019s and Polygon\u2019s TVLs are comparatively lower. This broad adoption and trust from projects as well as the wider community have been a positive sign for the growth and success of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nJoining other L2 projects such as Optimism, the launch of ARB will be a pivotal milestone in the network\u2019s journey toward a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Unlike other tokens such as Ether \u2014 Ethereum\u2019s native token that\u2019s utilized to pay transaction fees on the network \u2014 ARB will serve exclusively for protocol governance on Arbitrum.\n\nPrior to the announcement, Offchain Labs, the developer behind the Arbitrum ecosystem, was the sole entity responsible for making decisions and adjustments to the network. Following the announcement and the upcoming token launch, the reigns of control will be handed over to its community.\n\nThe network will grant holders the ability to vote on changes to both Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova networks. These networks allow users to carry out transactions on the Ethereum blockchain at greater speeds and reduced fees.\n\nThe governance process implemented will be self-executing: votes placed will directly impact and execute on-chain decisions without involving intermediaries. The voting procedure will require a minimum of 21 to 37 days to pass before a proposal is executed, thus ensuring users are given ample time to react to any changes.\n\nARB airdrop and eligibility\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation has announced that ARB will be airdropped to early eligible community members on Thursday, March 23, 2023.\n\nIn collaboration with crypto analytics firm Nansen, Arbitrum monitored user behavior in February to determine eligibility for ARB tokens. Factors that determined eligibility included:\n\nNumber of transactions performed.\n\nNumber of applications used.\n\nDuration of usage on both Arbitrum One and Nitro.\n\nBased on a statement released by Nansen, out of the 2.3 million wallets bridged on the Arbitrum One chain, a total of 625,142 addresses are eligible, with 28% of them having been bridged to Arbitrum One before Feb. 6, 2023.\n\nAccording to Offchain Labs\u2019 co-founder and CEO Steven Goldfeder, eligible users will be determined by an internal eligibility criterion. Interested users can check their eligibility for the airdrop on the website.\n\nToken allocation\n\nSource: Token Unlocks\n\nARB will have a total circulation of 10 billion tokens. Out of these, the Arbitrum community will have control over 56% of the tokens, of which:\n\n11.5% will be distributed to the Arbitrum community.\n\n1.1% will be given to DAOs operating in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO will distribute the remaining community tokens through a treasury.\n\nThe remaining 44% of ARB tokens will go to Offchain Labs. Both investor and team tokens will be subject to a vesting period of four years, with the first unlocking scheduled to occur in a year\u2019s time, followed by periodic unlocking over the next three years.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nWhile the launch of ARB has taken longer than expected in comparison to direct competitors such as Optimism, Goldfeder reassured the community that Arbitrum had reached certain technical milestones such as working fraud proofs (the tech underpinning Arbitrum One\u2019s unrivaled security), surpassing its primary competitor by a significant margin.\n\nNevertheless, the launch of ARB is a crucial milestone for Arbitrum and the L2 ecosystem as a whole. As more and more projects explore Layer-2 scaling solutions, the launch of a governance token for one of the leading solutions, such as Arbitrum, is a clear indication of the ecosystem\u2019s maturity.\n\nMaterial is provided in partnership with XGo"

        "content": "The price of ethereum (ETH) has increased tremendously, from $1,760 to $1,820 as of March 21, as bitcoin (BTC) remains steady after a surge in the last few days.\n\nEthereum surged to $1,820 and then slightly corrected. Bitcoin maintained its new high of $28,000 after it went bullish.\n\nEthereum to USD price chart | Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nEther\u2019s value against bitcoin had decreased since March 12, when the TradFi scene started facing a crisis. Any specific event has not triggered the sudden surge of ETH.\n\nThe ratio rose from 0.072 bitcoin per ETH to 0.062, equivalent to $280. It changed to 0.064 today, which might be the beginning of a recovery phase.\n\nThe Ethereum token supply has decreased by almost 67,000 ETHs, equivalent to $122 million, for the first time since its launch in 2015. ETH went into deflation on Jan. 16, 2023, and its total supply has steadily declined by 1,000 to 2,000 per day. More than 2,100 ETH are getting burnt daily. However, around 2,000 are issued to perchers, making the supply deficit around 100 ETH.\n\nSo far, bitcoin has been the primary crypto asset for market speculators and investors running out of banking. Bitcoin\u2019s high position might be because it is the most acknowledged crypto asset integrated into the general financial system.\n\nThe ETH surge might suggest a calmness in the banking system, but no solid evidence exists. However, with the ongoing government intervention, the banking crisis might end, and there is hope for improved market sentiment.\n\nThe placating of the banking crisis\n\nSignificant banks on the verge of collapsing have made incredible recoveries while the federal government and FDIC intervened for the ones that have been crushed completely.\n\nAs industry proponents speculated a possible crash, the First Republic Bank stock dived by 50% on Monday. However, with $212 billion in total assets as of December 2022, the bank bounced back today, with the price increasing by an average of 30%.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the government might offer catchers to all banks speculating about a potential system contagion.\n\nIntervention by big banks such as the ECB, J.P. Morgan, and the Bank of England might save the banking scene and suggest that the crisis is ending. The falling behind of the bank collapse scene might make the Bitcoin price rise to slow down too.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Euler\u2019s Finance\u2019s hacker sent a message to an Ethereum address.\n\nEUL\u2019s price rose after hacker\u2019s transactions.\n\nOn 20 March, Euler Finance\u2019s hacker sent a message to an Ethereum [ETH] address related to the DeFi platform. After Euler issued an on-chain ultimatum demanding the funds\u2019 return, the hacker offered to start a dialogue.\n\nThe message, embedded in an Ethereum transaction, read:\n\n\u201cWe want to make this easy on all those affected. No intention of keeping what is not ours\u2026 Setting up secure communication. Let us come to an agreement.\u201d\n\nAfter several hours, Euler responded with its own on-chain message, acknowledging the message and asking the exploiter to speak \u201cin private.\u201d\n\nOn March 13, the DeFi platform was attacked with a flash loan exploit, draining approximately $196.9 million in various cryptocurrencies.\n\nWe are aware and our team is currently working with security professionals and law enforcement. We will release further information as soon as we have it. https://t.co/bjm6xyYcxf \u2014 Euler Labs (@eulerfinance) March 13, 2023\n\nThis loot included $8.7 million in DAI stablecoin and $18.5 million in Wrapped Bitcoin [WBTC]. Around $135.8 million in Staked Ethereum [stETH] and $33.8 million in USD Coin [USDC] were also stolen.\n\nA few days later, Euler Finance offered the hacker 10% of the $200 million stolen in exchange for returning the rest within 24 hours. When that did not happen, Euler Finance formally announced a $1 million reward for information on the hacker and the return of all funds.\n\nToday the Euler Foundation is launching a $1M reward in the hope that this provides additional incentive for information that leads to the Euler protocol attacker\u2019s arrest and the return of all funds extracted by the attacker. \u2014 Euler Labs (@eulerfinance) March 15, 2023\n\nHowever, on 16 March, the hacker transferred funds associated with the Euler exploit to the Tornado Cash mixing service. The 10 transactions totaled 1,000 ETH (worth $1.74 million at the time of writing).\n\nOther transactions from the exploiter\u2019s wallet address also include 3000 ETH sent back to Euler Finance on 18 March, as well as funds sent to a possible apparent victim of the exploit.\n\nStrategy for @eulerfinance exploit.\n\nYesterday the Hacker returned 3k eth (~5 mio USD) of the stolen ~200 mio USD to Euler.\n\nTo be exact the first transfer took place at 6:53 AM and this is where things are getting interesting. pic.twitter.com/OFxb4d59ze \u2014 Johannes(?) (@0xJohannes_) March 19, 2023\n\nUnknown hacker mocking the system?\n\nJohannes, a crypto Twitter user, pointed out that just minutes after these transactions, EUL\u2019s price went up by 70% from $2.3 to $3.95. He speculated that the hacker might be mocking the Euler team so others can profit if the funds are returned.\n\nThe language used by the exploiter indicates that more than one person is involved in the loot.\n\nIn an earlier tweet, blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis said that the wallet address to which 100 ETH was transferred was linked to North Korea. According to Chainalysis, this could be an intentional attempt to mislead investigators."

        "title": "Ethereum [ETH]: Investors return to L2 bridges; zKSync, StarkNet addresses swell - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Addresses on layer two protocols without tokens yet increased interaction with projects.\n\nWhile StarkNet was planning a token distribution, zkSync remained unsure.\n\nOver the last few months, layer two (L2) protocols on the Ethereum [ETH] blockchain have gained noteworthy recognition. Needless to say, a project like Optimism [OP] sustained being the star among many. It dominated the last quarter of 2022 and also in early 2023.\n\nHowever, Arbitrum [ARB] has displaced OP from the top spot following its AirDrop distribution, and upcoming token listing on several exchanges. In turn, the hype that has surrounded the Arbitrum project seems to have triggered reactions to interactions with similar protocols.\n\nIn preparation for the unknown\n\nAccording to Nansen, token swaps and ETH bridges on protocols like zkSync and StarkNet tremendously increased last week.\n\nThese projects are similar in function to both Arbitrum and Optimism. However, StarkNet and zkSync differ from OP and ARB as the former are not Optimism rollups like the latter group.\n\nInstead, StarkNet and zkSync are zero-knowledge (zk) rollups whose aim is to enable any decentralized Application (dApp) to operate at an unlimited scale.\n\nInformation from the blockchain data and research platform showed that about 39,000 addresses bridged $871 million to zkSync within the said period.\n\nThe rise in interaction could be attributed to a possible AirDrop that users might get when they launch a token associated with the projects.\n\nHowever, zkSync has not confirmed that a token would come along with its several upgrades. But it would seem that these addresses are taking no chance if the projects announce a reward.\n\nBuilding the blocks\n\nInterestingly, zkSync has had quite a number of integrations in March. On-chain data services OKLink launched its explorer on the future-proof zk Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM). Also, immersive gaming project Horizon Land collaborated with the project to build a decentralized metaverse platform.\n\nOn the other hand, it seemed that StarkNet will allocate distributed tokens to its users. On 20 March, the StarkNet Foundation tweeted that it was setting up a committee to ensure fair distribution of the ecosystem-powered tokens.\n\nThe Provisions Committee is critical to ensuring the fair, decentralized and transparent distribution of the token that will power the Starknet ecosystem. \u2014 Starknet \u2728? (@Starknet) March 20, 2023\n\nThe project further mentioned that the function of the committee goes beyond AirDrop provision or token launch. In clearing this point, it noted,\n\n\u201cThe Ecosystem Onboarding Committee is responsible for empowering and integrating new developers and community members into the Starknet ecosystem.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, airdrops are no guarantee of the short or long-term performance of assets. Note that other factors like use cases, adoption, and fundamentals also play a role. Although both zkSync and StarkNet seem to have viable use cases, there is no certainty their tokens, if and when launched, might perform like ARB and OP."

        "title": "Arbitrum's ARB token signifies the start of airdrop season \u2014 Here are 5 to look out for - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Arbitrum developers announced an airdrop of its governance token, ARB, to eligible users and DAOs on the Ethereum layer-2 platform. The average user received around 625 ARB tokens, which corresponds to around $625 to $1,250, according to pre-launch trading prices and popular estimations.\n\nThe prospect of earning free money has instilled excitement around users looking to hunt the next airdrop opportunity. The airdrop farming activity also benefits the protocols by attracting liquidity and usage to the platform. The strategy is working well for both protocol developers and users.\n\nMoreover, a team\u2019s sale of a protocol\u2019s token invokes securities laws, inducing significant legal risk for the developing teams. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that future protocols will use the same strategy to decentralize their protocols.\n\nHere are five potential airdrop opportunities for this year.\n\nzkSync Era\n\nzkSync Era is a layer-2 rollup on Ethereum based on zero-knowledge (ZK) proof technology. Experts, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, have argued that zk-based EVM-compatible rollups could be a game-changer technology with high scalability and throughput, leading to mass adoption.\n\nzkSync has the added advantage of being compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which enables access to the blockchain through MetaMask wallet itself.\n\nMatter Labs, the team behind zkSync, raised $200 million in December 2022 in a Series C funding round led by Blockchain Capital and Dragonfly. Leading decentralized applications on Ethereum like Chainlink, Uniswap and Aave have signaled intent to launch on zkSync.\n\nOn Feb. 16, Matter Labs opened the floodgates for registered projects to deploy their code on the zkSync mainnet. The public deposits will start shortly. Users looking to maximize their chances of gaining an airdrop will look to improve their on-chain footprint on the mainnet.\n\nStarknet\n\nStarknet is another ZK-based Ethereum rollup that supports decentralized applications. StarkWare, the developing firm behind Starknet, has confirmed a STARK token and its utility in decentralizing the Ethereum layer-2 network.\n\nThe team has previously worked on StarkEx, an Ethereum scaling engine used by independent Layer-2 solutions like Sorare, ImmutableX and dYdX. The success of its previous projects instills confidence in the success of Starknet.\n\nStarkWare launched the Starknet mainnet in November. The total deposits on Starknet jumped 45% to $2.49 million after the Aribtrum token launch announcement as users rushed to farm the next airdrop. On-chain analytics firm Nansen witnessed record deposits of $3.4 million Ether(ETH) and Dai (DAI) on March 17 to the Starknet ecosystem.\n\nDaily flows to/from Starknet. Source: Nansen\n\nScroll\n\nScroll, branded as a \u201ctrue zkEVM,\u201d is another zk-Rollup Ethereum layer 2. It\u2019s similar to zkSync Era, which comes with full EVM compatibility. The project raised $30 million in April 2022 in an investment round led by Polychain Capital.\n\nThe blockchain is developed by Ye Zhang, a Ph.D. student at New York University. Scroll\u2019s design replicates the same version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine as used on mainnet, making it easier for existing Ethereum developers to deploy code on Scroll, compared to alternatives like zkSync and Polygon\u2019s zkEVM.\n\nOn February 28, the Scroll team launched on the Ethereum Goerli testnet, enabling public testing activity. According to the team, over 100,000 users accessed the previous testnet version of Scroll. The mainnet launch is scheduled for late 2023.\n\nRelated: Attack of the zkEVMs! Crypto's 10x moment\n\nSui Network\n\nSui Network is a Move-based layer-1 blockchain, similar to Aptos, born from the ashes of Meta\u2019s failed blockchain project, Libra. Evan Cheng, who formerly headed Meta\u2019s crypto wallet research and development unit, became the CEO of Mysten Labs, the team developing Sui.\n\nAptos Labs launched the blockchain\u2019s native token, APT, on October 18, airdropping 20 million tokens to eligible users who minted a specific NFT on the Aptos testnet. On launch day, the airdrop was worth over $1,500. Sui testnet users can expect a similar airdrop upon mainnet launch in Q2 2023.\n\nOn March 21, Mysten Labs launched a Wave to Mainnet campaign, including a \u201cseries of events and content to further educate the community about the potential for Sui protocol.\u201d Participating in the Sui campaigns and developing a digital footprint on the testnet could improve the chances of earning a future airdrop.\n\nSei Network\n\nSei Network is a Cosmos-based layer 1 blockchain focusing mainly on DeFi and high-frequency trading applications.\n\nThe blockchain comprises basic applications such as an order-matching engine and a unified liquidity model across the platform to enhance trading experience. The project is backed by industry heavyweights like Multicoin Capital, Coinbase Ventures and Delphi Digital.\n\nThe team launched its incentivized testnet in Q2 2022 with various mission and NFT minting campaigns along the way. Users who participated in these events will likely receive an airdrop upon mainnet launch. The team has hinted the launch will happen shortly.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The disclosure was bountiful, featuring several other details for Arbitrum users.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s listing details for the ARB token\n\nBesides committing to adding support for the ERC-20 token, Coinbase said that the launch will take a step-by-step approach for the USD-ARB trading pairs on the exchange. Most importantly, ARB would feature an \u201cexperimental\u201d tag on the US-based exchange to inform users that the Arbitrum token is new on the platform and that it does not impede holding, transferring, or trading.\n\nThe US-based exchange also cautioned users not to send ARB to networks other than Ethereum lest they lose their tokens. The exchange also added that it will start trading the token once adequate supply and liquidity conditions are met.\n\nCoinbase will add support for Arbitrum (ARB) on the Arbitrum network (ERC-20 token). Do not send this asset over other networks or your funds may be lost. Inbound transfers for this asset are available on @Coinbase & @CoinbaseExch in the regions where trading is supported. \u2014 Coinbase Assets (@CoinbaseAssets) March 22, 2023\n\nNotably, trading is scheduled to commence shortly after the March 23 airdrop. An excerpt from the announcement reads:\n\nThe Arbitrum network (ERC-20 token) contract address for Arbitrum (ARB) is 0x912CE59144191C1204E64559FE8253a0e49E6548.\n\nBefore the token airdrop happens, the first 1000 customers that buy ARB on PancakeSwap will get a 99% discount.\n\nCoinbase also noted that ARB trading would only be available for select jurisdictions but did not give further clarifications about this limitation.\n\nAs a forewarning, the exchange highlighted that some users could experience delays when depositing on the Arbitrum network but asserted that interventions were underway to solve the situation.\n\nBinance also confirmed plans to list Arbitrum (ARB) and has provisionally scheduled it for open trading for these spot trading pairs beginning March 23 at 1700 UTC.\n\nArbitrum community members eager for ARB launch\n\nAfter years of waiting, the Arbitrum community is eager for the ARB token to finally make its market debut. The anticipation was intensified when the network committed to distributing 56% of the token\u2019s circulating supply to the Arbitrum community, comprising network users.\n\nAs reported earlier, the impending airdrop will distribute 11.5% of the total supply to eligible Arbitrum users. Another 1.1% to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) that operate within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nThe process of eligible user selection will be transparent, leveraging several factors revealed during the airdrop announcement. Track the details here.\n\nMeanwhile, the ARB token launch anticipation has triggered a selling spree for eligible wallets, which are now going for discounted prices on prevailing speculation that ARB will get as close to $1 as possible in market value."

Buterin is also the creator and de facto leader of one of the most promising technology networks in the world. Vitalik\u2019s influence stretches well beyond the Ethereum blockchain. His work has informed the entire blockchain space, and he\u2019s been identified as a global thought leader by Forbes and other international media outlets.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to think about Ethereum without considering its famous creator. And that\u2019s why Ethereum fans seem a little panicked when he talks about the possibility of receding from the spotlight. But is Vitalik really leaving Ethereum? And what would happen if he did? Fortunately, we don\u2019t think Ethereum buyers and fans have anything to worry about in this regard. Here\u2019s what Vitalik means when he talks about leadership decentralisation.\n\nVitalik Doesn\u2019t Plan to Leave Ethereum\n\nTo understand what Vitalik is talking about when he references \u201cfading into the background\u201d, you\u2019ve got to understand his vision for decentralisation. To Vitalik Buterin, a blockchain is no better than a traditional corporation if it\u2019s led by a centralised figure. Vitalik isn\u2019t the CEO of Ethereum; he\u2019s just the guy who started it. And sure, he may be more famous than any other person who works on Ethereum, but this doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s inherently the most important.\n\nAt various times in his career, Vitalik has made it clear that he\u2019s not the best coder in Ethereum. He\u2019s not the most competent engineer. He doesn\u2019t have the best ideas or the most original innovations. He\u2019s hired people with this expertise over the past couple of years, and many of these are doing the most important technical work on the platform.\n\nEthereum has also been putting more and more of its daily tasks into the virtual hands of algorithms and smart contracts. Many aspects of Ethereum run themselves. If Vitalik disappeared tomorrow, these autonomous wings of the network would continue without his daily influence.\n\nButerin recognises that to be successful for years and decades, Ethereum must be able to survive and thrive without his direct oversight. He also knows where his expertise lies, and where to rely on the skills of others. For this reason, he\u2019s allowing himself to fade into the background, rather than feed a cult of personality that won\u2019t be good for the long-term health of his beloved platform.\n\nIn his own words from Twitter, \u201cI am not leaving. No plans to stop or reduce blog posts/ethresearch posts/Github commits.\u201d These tasks have been the most important that he has ever committed to the protocol, and these he will continue even if he doesn\u2019t pursue the media\u2019s attention like he did a couple of years ago. This is a good thing for Ethereum, and for the leader that the Ethereum community has grown to trust so deeply.\n\nFeatured image source: Flickr"

        "title": "Despite ETC hashrate facing 2023 lows, here\u2019s why day traders remain bullish - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum Classic\u2019s hashrate dropped to its lowest level this year.\n\nDay traders remained bullish as they intensified accumulation.\n\nAt 106.59TH/s, Ethereum Classic\u2019s [ETC] hashrate has hit its lowest point so far this year, data from 2miners.com revealed. Moreover, the chain\u2019s network difficulty at 1.45P also declined to its lowest value since the year began.\n\nRead Ethereum Classic\u2019s [ETC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nA network\u2019s hashrate refers to the computing power used by miners to validate transactions and secure the network. On the other hand, network difficulty is a measure of how hard it is to find a block on the blockchain. As more miners join the network and the hashrate increases, the difficulty also increases to maintain a consistent block time.\n\nWhen a blockchain\u2019s hashrate and network difficulty continue to drop, it suggests that the network is becoming less secure and potentially more vulnerable to attacks. It could also indicate a lack of interest or profitability for miners to continue mining the blockchain.\n\nThis might be the case for the ETC network, as data from Messari revealed stagnancy in miners\u2019 revenue from fees paid to process transactions on the blockchain. On a year-to-date basis (YTD), this has oscillated between 0.02% and 0.03%. It rallied to a high of 0.16% on 13 March but declined soon afterward. At press time, this was a mere 0.015%.\n\nETC holders to see gains?\n\nAt press time, ETC traded at $20.61. Moreover, increased buying was spotted during a 12-hour window period. ETC\u2019s price traded close to the upper band of the Bollinger Band indicator, suggesting that day traders have increasingly accumulated the alt.\n\nFurther, the asset\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 56.99, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) rested at 57.92 When both the RSI and MFI indicators of an asset are up, it suggests strong buying pressure in the market, which can drive higher prices.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETC Profit Calculator\n\nETC\u2019s On-balance volume was also spotted in an uptrend, sitting at 273.532 million at press time. An increasing OBV suggests that the asset volume is increasing over time, indicating that buyers are more active in the market than sellers.\n\nThe Directional Movement Index (DMI) confirmed increased buyers\u2019 presence. At press time, the buyers\u2019 strength (green) at 28.20 was solidly above the sellers\u2019 (red) at 15.97. The Average Directional Index (ADX) showed that the buyers\u2019 strength was a rock hard one that sellers might find impossible to revoke in the short term."

        "title": "Is Big Eyes Coin (BIG) Considered an Ethereum Cryptocurrency or a Solana Cryptocurrency? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Big Eyes Coin (BIG), is an irresistibly cute \u201cCat\u201d themed cryptocurrency, drawing much attention within the crypto industry after having raised over 31 million$ upon its presale launch. Feature packed with many attractive perks like the ability to yield big profits within a short time, Big Eyes Coin (BIG) belongs to the meme coins family and is expected to surpass its competitive counterparts like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) in the near future.\n\nThis article explores the technology and mechanism behind this cryptocurrency alongside scalability and stateful nature to ascertain whether Big Eyes Coin (BIG) is more aligned with Ethereum cryptocurrency or Solana cryptocurrency.\n\nWhat are the Major Differences Between Ethereum Cryptocurrency and Solana Cryptocurrency?\n\nPossibly the biggest difference between the two blockchain technologies would be the fact that Ethereum 1.0 relies on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism similar to Bitcoin, whilst Solana\n\nCryptocurrency uses an underlying consensus mechanism known as Proof-of-History (PoH), which takes a series of computing procedures to cryptographically determine the time interval between two events.\n\nAnother major feature that makes Ethereum different from Solana is its \u201cstateful\u201d nature which records all transactions on the network. This implies that each node in the network must update its copy of the network whenever a new transaction takes place to reflect the new transaction. Solana, meanwhile, has a \u2018stateless\u2019 architecture and reduces the overall memory consumption, leading to increased performance. Solana\u2019s ability to process a block every 400 millisecond is one of its strong selling points. This means Solana is able to process more than 50K transactions per second (TPS). However, Ethereum is currently progressing to Ethereum 2.0, which is capable of processing over 100K TPS.\n\nEthereum\u2019s scalability is a significant concern for the landscape and worsens in times of high market activity. However, Ethereum is the gold standard of the blockchain landscape, and quite a number of decentralized apps and other blockchain solutions are built in and around the chain.\n\nIn essence, Ethereum offers a more mature and decentralized network, while Solana offers high-speed and low-cost transactions.\n\nConcluding Thoughts About Where Big Eyes Coin (BIG) Fits In?\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) operates on the Ethereum blockchain and uses the ERC-20 standard for its cryptocurrency exchanges, hoping to capitalize on the network\u2019s resources. Ethereum blockchain has the largest DeFi market, which translates to active users, which in turn makes sense for a cryptocurrency like Big Eyes Coin (BIG) to launch on a network where active users are, to allow the liquidity to help give life to the meme coin project.\n\nThe presale of Big Eyes Coin (BIG) began in the third quarter of 2022, and it has already managed to raise over 31 million $, with over a million dollars worth of BIG tokens sold in the first week of the presale alone.\n\nTo see more information or to buy Big Eyes Coin (BIG), check out the links below.\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEVE Online, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) in outer space, boasts one of the most hardcore, engaged audiences in gaming. And today, developer CCP Games announced that it has raised money to expand the EVE universe with a new Web3 game.\n\nCCP revealed today that it has raised $40 million in financing in a round led by Andreessen Horowitz to develop what it\u2019s calling \u201ca new AAA title utilizing blockchain technology, set within the EVE universe.\u201d The $40 million round also included participation from BITKRAFT, Nexon, Kingsway Capital, HASHED, among other investors.\n\nThe URL of the announcement website suggests a \u201cProject Awakening\u201d name for the initiative.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a press release, the company explained that the new EVE game will feature on-chain systems, with an emphasis on \u201cpersistence, composability and truly open third-party development to create a new relationship between virtual worlds and players.\u201d\n\nWe're excited to announce that we have secured $40M financing, led by @a16z, to create a new AAA game within the EVE Universe utilizing blockchain technology. Learn more here: https://t.co/IZJlPRcZ0z pic.twitter.com/y9cqZKtt2l \u2014 CCP Games (@CCPGames) March 21, 2023\n\n\u201cSince its inception, CCP Games\u2019 vision has been to create virtual worlds more meaningful than real life,\u201d said CCP CEO Hilmar Veigar P\u00e9tursson, in a statement. \u201cNow, with advancements made within blockchain, we can forge a new universe deeply imbued with our expertise in player agency and autonomy, empowering players to engage in new ways.\u201d\n\nEVE Online is celebrating 20 years of existence this year and has cultivated a die-hard audience of players that have formed factions within its sci-fi world. The game has yielded an annual convention in Iceland, an array of spinoff games, and even books documenting historical in-game battles between its contentious rival crews.\n\nWhile this is CCP\u2019s first move into Web3 gaming, P\u00e9tursson has long been interested in the potential for blockchain to revolutionize concepts like user ownership and open economies in the gaming world.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut he\u2019s been realistic about it.\n\nIn 2020, P\u00e9tursson told Decrypt that he thought the addressable market for blockchain games was too small at the time for CCP to make any moves. He also noted the complexities around handling crypto, and said that it could be five to 10 years before a blockchain game had the potential to be a true \u201ckiller app.\u201d\n\n\"I'm not sure necessarily that it will be a tipping point,\u201d he said in 2020. \u201cBut you could foresee a time where there's a killer app, where you just really have to get involved regardless of whether you need to figure something out, and that pulls in a wave of people and kind of starts an avalanche.\"\n\nCCP Games isn\u2019t the only major traditional game maker to enter the Web3 world.\n\nAssassin\u2019s Creed publisher Ubisoft has been experimenting and investing in the space for years, for example, while Final Fantasy creator Square Enix is actively developing NFT games\u2014such as the upcoming Symbiogenesis on Ethereum scaling network, Polygon."

        "content": "Undoubtedly, cryptocurrencies represent some of the most innovative uses of digital technology in the 21st century. Crypto tokens allow users to do more than they can with traditional financial institutions. These tokens have also created a thriving ecosystem where different assets are traded against one another \u2013 called the coin or crypto market. You can make plenty of money from this market by gauging price differences and movement. The only downside to this ecosystem is that price changes could be rapid and detrimental.\n\nTo enjoy the best of the coin market, you need to make well-calculated purchase decisions. You should only invest in high-potential crypto tokens with strong utility and infrastructure. But what are they? This piece will introduce you to unique crypto tokens and reveal how these projects will benefit you.\n\nDogetti\u2019s Battle to Get to the Top of The Meme Sector\n\nFor a long time, the coin market has been dominated by dog-themed meme coins. These coins, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have dominated news headlines in the meme sector. And it\u2019s almost as if there would be no worthy replacement. Dogetti(DETI) is set to change this stereotype.\n\nAccording to its whitepaper, Dogetti is a revolutionary meme coin that wants to create a close-knit community of users. It will refer to this community as a family to indicate their commitment to the growth of the project. They understand the importance of an active community to the long-term growth of a crypto token. And that\u2019s why they wish to create an ecosystem where holders can communicate, contribute and share ideas to reward. Dogetti will encourage involvement from its users through its DAO. This DAO will keep holders in the driving seat, unlike other meme coins.\n\nThe main selling point of Dogetti is the project\u2019s commitment to rewarding its users. It uses a 2% reflection model. This model ensures that 2% is deducted from all transactions. This will serve as the main source of income for those who have opted to join this project. There\u2019s a sharing fee for all deductions from the platform. So, you can rest assured the money will go to the right place. It\u2019s clear that the Dogetti team business. They have created a detailed outline of their token\u2019s roadmap.\n\nDETI is the token that powers this ecosystem. Finally, there\u2019s a maximum token supply of 100 billion DETI. This figure is considerably less than other meme coins.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Ability to Host Decentralized Applications\n\nWhen Vitalik Buterin launched Ethereum, no one could predict that it would become the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world. But Ethereum\u2019s success has been due to the innovativeness it introduced to the coin market. Ethereum was the project that showed coin market developers the true meaning of decentralization.\n\nEthereum serves as a cryptocurrency and blockchain. It can use its blockchain to host other decentralized applications, games, and crypto projects. Through the reliance on smart contracts, new projects increased exponentially on Ethereum. But this blockchain\u2019s main utility turned out to be its major problem. As more projects were added to Ethereum, it didn\u2019t take long before the project became slower and more expensive.\n\nEthereum\u2019s development team is working on several solutions to restore the project to what it used to be. They will use layer-2 networks to boost the project\u2019s network.\n\nAvalanche\u2019s Capacity to Replace Ethereum\n\nAvalanche is one of the latest projects on the coin market. It belongs to a special category of crypto tokens developed to replace Ethereum. Avalanche can host decentralized applications on its smart contracts. However, Avalanche can handle its processes faster than Ethereum.\n\nBecause of Avalanche\u2019s speed, many prefer hosting their project on this blockchain. More and more projects have gradually been added to this network. This network also supports scalability, making it attractive to different types of investors.\n\nIf you wish to jump on the Dogetti band, use the links below;\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

ETH is up 35% during this period, so a good time to look back.\n\nEthereum in 27th place\n\nAs can be seen from Coinmarketcap's data, Ethereum is ranked number 27 by market value. This is 13 spots below bitcoin, which has not moved a single spot in the same time period. Ethereum is four spots higher than two weeks ago.\n\nEthereum is under the Polish zloty, which is still number 26. But ETH has gained territory against the Chilean peso, the Norwegian krone and the Turkish lira. These fiat currencies are now worth less than Ethereum, and that is a big win.\n\nRussian ruble is crawling back up\n\nIn total, there are 101 currencies on Coinmarketcap's list, with Bitcoin being the highest ranking crypto in the list at number 14, below the Swiss franc, but above the Thai baht. The comeback of the Russian ruble is however striking.\n\nTwo weeks ago, this coin was still in place 25. That is eleven places difference with bitcoin. Ethereum came pretty close at the time by six spots, but since then the ruble has risen in market value. Right now, the ruble is back on the heels of bitcoin, with only two spots in between.\n\nMarket cap back above 2 trillion\n\nEthereum, like Bitcoin, is on the rise again. The crypto market was booming last night, with Ethereum up 7% from the day before. The market seems to be slowly turning bullish again as fiat currencies are depreciating against BTC and ETH.\n\nThe market is thriving as the total market capitalization recaptures two trillion dollars (1.82 trillion euros). For the people who don't see this for themselves; a trillion is a number with twelve zeros. Of this, about 900 billion dollars (681 billion pounds) is bitcoin and about 400 billion dollars (302 billion pounds) Ethereum."

In a recent podcast with Bankless, Hayes shared his thoughts on the United States Federal Reserve\u2019s new banking policy and its potential impact on the prices of crypto assets.\n\nHayes: Bitcoin will benefit from the Bank Term Funding Program\n\nAccording to Arthur Hayes, BTC will achieve this remarkable valuation thanks to the Federal Reserve\u2019s new Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), which allows banks, credit unions, and other eligible depository institutions to borrow funds for up to one year, using agency debt, U.S. Treasuries, mortgage-backed securities, etc, as collateral. The BFTP recently facilitated a $210 billion bailout of the big four U.S. banks i.e. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citibank, by letting them borrow against their negative collateral value.\n\nHayes believes that this funding program will induce a \u201cmerry-go-round\u201d effect wherein American banks will have an unlimited supply of cash from the Federal Reserve in exchange for holding government bonds. The BitMEX founder believes that this \u201csinister\u201d program will pump Bitcoin to $1 million.\n\nIt will be profitable for the banks to have a deposit base, buy every single insurance they can of US government debt, and if they ever need to give their depositors back money, they give their debt to the Fed, the Fed gives them dollars. So we go on this little merry-go-round and the US government gets to stuff bonds down the throats of the banks and everybody\u2019s happy.\u201d Arthur Hayes\n\nThe $1 million projection for Bitcoin became popular earlier this week after Balaji Srinivasan, an entrepreneur who formerly served as Coinbase\u2019s Chief Technology Officer, made a public bet predicting that BTC would be worth a million dollars within the next 90 days."

It is the second largest liquid staking project in terms of TVL.\n\nWhile STETH is shown on Coingecko as the eighth largest coin by market capitalization, this is not the case for other cryptocurrency market aggregation websites such as CoinMarketCap.\n\nSince it is a synthetic version of Ether, some cryptocurrency market aggregation sites do not include STETH in the top ten, despite its capitalization.\n\nLido and the $30 million in Ethereum: selling or staking?\n\nThe Decentralized Autonomous Organization behind Lido, Ethereum\u2019s largest staking pool, is considering whether to sell or stake the $30 million in Ether (ETH) from its treasury.\n\nA proposal was submitted on 14 February by DAO\u2019s financial unit, Steakhouse Financial: four possible choices, one of which contemplates staking some or all of its ETH on Lido in the form of Lido Staked ETH (stETH).\n\nAnother choice would see LidoDAO selling some or all of its 20,304 ETH in exchange for stablecoins. Thanks to the Shanghai and Capella upgrades, both scheduled for the first half of the year, users will soon be able to withdraw their staked ETH.\n\nAlthough the conversion of ETH to Staked ETH could lead to higher profits in the long run, Steakhouse Financial is concerned that locking too much of the funds within the smart contract could cause the risk of not having enough ETH on hand when needed.\n\nSteakhouse Financial stated that it may be necessary to exchange Ether for a stablecoin to ensure greater liquidity should operating expenses increase.\n\nSteakhouse Financial also revealed that LidoDAO currently boasts an inflow of about 1,000 stETH per month. In other words, DAO earns between $1.3 million and $1.5 million per month, with the price of ETH fluctuating between $1,100 and $1,700.\n\nHowever, Steakhouse Financial is considering whether it is worth converting excess stETH into stablecoins so that it can more calmly deal with potential changes in market conditions that could cause an increase in operating expenses.\n\nAt the moment, it appears that most LidoDAO members favor the partial sale and staking of a slice of the 20,304 ETH currently stuck in its Aragon smart contract."

        "title": "Report: Over $1 billion worth of ETH lost forever, not including lost wallet access \u2013 Will scarcity drive Ether prices up? - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "The 2017 parity wallet bug has the highest amount of Ethereum locked, amounting to over 513k Ethers, worth over $924 million in current prices.\n\nHowever, the researchers noted that the figure is a rough estimate as it does not account for Ethereum units locked through lost private keys, among other things.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is one of the most rewarding global industries but has unregulated risks. As the Web3 industry steers forward with the adoption of the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry, faulty designs and unfriendly protocols for novice users have contributed to losses amounting to billions of dollars. However, it is the thought of lost digital assets, which may never be recovered, that has hindered new traders from fully entering the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nAs such, developers in the Web3 industry are tasked with building user-friendly protocols to help investors not lose their coins. Moreover, the future success of the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry depends on the ability of layperson investors to interact with smart contracts on a daily basis.\n\nCloser Look at Lost Ethereum (ETH)\n\nAccording to recent research by Conor Grogan, the director of product strategy and business operations at Coinbase Global Inc., over $1 billion worth of ether has been completely lost through typos, user errors, and buggy contracts. Notably, Grogan, who regularly posts unique on-chain research work, highlighted that about 636,000 ETH, worth over $1.15 billion, have been lost along the way. Notably, the lost Ethereum represents about 0.5 percent of all circulating supply.\n\nOn the brighter side, the number of Ethereum trapped forever reduces the selling pressure on the existing tokens, thus adding more value in the long run.\n\nReportedly, the 2017 parity wallet bug has the highest amount of Ethereum locked, amounting to over 513k Ethers, worth over $924 million in current prices. With the Ethereum network leading other blockchains in the smart contract industry, over 85k ethers worth about $153 million have been completely locked.\n\nHowever, Grogan noted that the figure is a rough estimate as it does not account for Ethereum units locked through lost private keys, among other things. Grogan noted.\n\nTo be clear, this $1.1B+ number significantly undershoots the actual lost/inaccessible ETH amount- It just covers instances where Ethereum is locked forever. For example, it doesn\u2019t cover lost private keys or things like Genesis wallets that have presumably been forgotten.\n\nInterestingly, about 11.5k Ethers worth approximately $20 million has been sent to a burn address for unknown reasons. The amount of Ethers lost due to NFT minting gone wrong amounts to over 11k.\n\nSome of the biggest losses: -Web3 foundation has 306K ETH ($538M) trapped due to the Parity Multisig bug\n\n-Quadriga lost 60K ($108M) to a faulty contract\n\n-Akutars lost 11.5k ETH in an NFT-mint gone wrong\n\n-People have collectively sent 24k ETH to a burn address for some reason (?) pic.twitter.com/ELAzFTvWe5 \u2014 Conor (@jconorgrogan) March 20, 2023\n\nBigger Picture\n\nThe Ethereum network has grown to a worldwide respected blockchain with over $218 billion in market capitalization. With the upcoming Shanghai upgrade, the Ethereum developers project the user interface will ease as investors can withdraw staked ethers.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "title": "blockchain compatible with ISO 20022 - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "ISO 20022 is an ISO standard for electronic data exchange between financial institutions.\n\nThe standard covers financial information that is transferred between financial institutions, such as payment transactions, securities trading and settlement information, credit and debit card transactions, and more.\n\nThanks to ISO 20022, a huge amount of financial services metadata, stored in UML models with a special ISO 20022 UML profile, has been shared and standardized.\n\nAmong the organizations using ISO 20022 is SWIFT, which is the world\u2019s leading messaging network through which international payments are made.\n\nThe standard was developed in 2013, or four years after Bitcoin was born, is issued by ISO Technical Committee 68 (TC68), and is managed by Working Group 4 (WG4), a subgroup of TC68.\n\nSince 2015, when Ethereum was being born, it has been widely adopted by European Union countries, as well as Switzerland, Britain, India and Japan, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand , as well as South Africa and Singapore.\n\nThe US Fed, on the other hand, began adopting it only in 2020, with the migration process expected to end only this year. This means that by now only China and Russia are not using it as a standard among large economies, in addition to South Korea and Brazil.\n\nISO 20022 blockchains\n\nIn light of all this, it is not at all strange that older blockchains, such as Bitcoin, are not compatible with this Standard, nor is it surprising that blockchains developed in Asia are not.\n\nIt is also not surprising that Ethereum is not compatible, because it is a project born when the ISO 20022 Standard was still spreading. Moreover, it had not yet been widely adopted in the US at that time.\n\nThe case of Ripple (XRP) is curious.\n\nIndeed, Ripple is a blockchain that was born in 2012, i.e., before the release of the ISO 20022 standard, and is a fundamentally US project. Yet it turns out to be among the few compatible blockchains.\n\nThe reason is that Ripple over time has specialized specifically in banking or institutional transactions, and so it wanted to integrate ISO 20022 compatibility over time in order to interact with the financial institutions that are using it.\n\nThe other major blockchain project that is compatible with this standard is, not surprisingly, Stellar (XLM), which is a project that grew out of a rib of Ripple when Jed McCaleb resigned as CTO of Ripple in 2013 specifically to found Stellar in 2014.\n\nStellar, however, is a very different project from Ripple because it is not run by a single for-profit company, but is intended to be a truly decentralized protocol.\n\nIt is worth noting that compatibility with ISO 20022 seems to have benefited only Ripple, which continues to be one of the top ten crypto projects in the world by market capitalization. In fact, XLM has now plummeted to 28th in this special ranking, surpassed even by outdated projects such as Bitcoin Cash.\n\nHowever, there are other blockchains that are compatible with this standard.\n\nFirst, there is Algorand, with its ALGO cryptocurrency. Although this is a project often considered to be of a high standard, so far it has been far less successful than the alternatives. It is enough to say that ALGO has fallen to 37th place by market capitalization.\n\nInterestingly, there are two other ISO 20022-compatible blockchains whose cryptocurrencies have very similar capitalization to ALGO: Hedera (HBAR) and Quant (QNT).\n\nTaking XRP, which capitalizes at $22.5 billion, as a benchmark, XLM capitalizes at only one-tenth ($2.4 billion), while HBAR (1.9), ALGO (1.6) and QNT (1.5) are all very close to just over half of XLM.\n\nAs far as is known, only two other ISO 20022-compliant blockchains remain, namely IOTA (MIOTA) and XDC Network (XDC).\n\nIOTA is a special case, because it was once among the most promising crypto projects, but then seems to have completely stalled due to major technical problems. Its cryptocurrency MIOTA has plummeted to 78th place by market capitalization with less than $600 million. It is enough to think that it capitalizes less than BitTorrent\u2019s BTT, or BSV (Bitcoin SV), and its current value is lower than even its value at launch in June 2017.\n\nXDC capitalizes even less (550 million), but it has never been a particularly successful project. It is a project that was launched just under five years ago, and until February 2021 it had never been particularly talked about.\n\nSo except for XRP, which is a story in itself, none of the other blockchains compatible with the ISO 20022 standard have yet achieved much success. Indeed, only Ripple among them has an effective ongoing relationship with traditional financial institutions."

        "content": "Star Xu, the founder of the OKX exchange, has made an announcement on Twitter about the future of the exchange\u2019s public blockchain. According to Xu, the new exchange public blockchain, OKBChain, will be a layer 2 (L2) chain of Ethereum, starting from side chain technology and eventually developing to ZK technology. However, the old OKT Chain will continue to be kept as L1.\n\nOKT Chain will continue be a L1 Chain,the closest launch will be OKTC WASM which allow us develop high performance Dapp through rust or c++. OKB Chain will be a L2 Chain of Ethereum, starting from side chain technology and will develop to ZK technology. Both OKTC and OKBC are on\u2026 https://t.co/pl35k9wQdY \u2014 Star (@star_okx) March 20, 2023\n\nIn response to a question from a community member about whether OKBChain and OKT will be different or under one umbrella, Xu clarified that OKT Chain would remain an L1 chain and that the closest launch would be OKTC WASM. It will allow developers to create high-performance Dapps through Rust or C++. Xu also stated that both OKTC and OKBC are on the OKX core chain strategy.\n\nXu\u2019s tweet comes after a previous tweet in which he stated that the Testnet for the new public blockchain would launch soon without delay. With this announcement, it seems that the OKX exchange is making strides toward a more advanced and efficient blockchain infrastructure, promising exciting developments for users and investors alike.\n\nOKX\u2019s Core Products: Driving Blockchain Solutions\n\nIn an announcement on social media by a Twitter account, OKC, it was reported that OKBchain would launch its testnet as planned in March. The company also provided some additional details regarding its other projects.\n\nAccording to a tweet, OKTChain will refer to the current OKC and will continue to operate as an L1 public chain. The platform will also support WASM virtual machines in the future, providing increased functionality for its users.\n\nOKB Chain, on the other hand, is positioned as an L2 of ETH and will take the ZK route. This will allow the platform to provide enhanced security and scalability, making it an attractive option for developers and users.\n\nBoth OKT Chain and OKB Chain are considered core products of OKX, a leading provider of blockchain solutions.\n\nHowever, as the company continues to expand its offerings and explore new technologies, it will be interesting to see how these projects develop and contribute to the overall growth of the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nRelated Reading | Bitcoin To $1 Million In 90 Days: Crypto Analyst Sparks Debate With Bold Prediction"

        "content": "Home \u00bb Journal Lido Finance Staking Review \u2013 Is Lido Staking Legit & Trustworthy? Lido Finance Staking Review \u2013 Is Lido Staking Legit & Trustworthy? Visit Now Lido Finance Staking Review \u2013 Is Lido Staking Legit & Trustworthy? Visit Now The Lido platform has a simple and user-friendly interface that makes staking cryptocurrency easy, even for users new to the DeFi ecosystem, with no minimum amount required when staking assets. Users can connect their wallets and stake any amount of tokens to earn rewards in real-time.\n\nIn the realm of cryptocurrency, safety and profitability often walk hand in hand. This is especially true when it comes to staking, a popular method for earning passive income in the crypto space. One platform that has been gaining attention in this regard is Lido Finance. But the question on everyone\u2019s mind is: Is Lido staking safe?\n\nIn this comprehensive Lido staking review, we aim to answer these pressing questions. We\u2019ll delve into the inner workings of Lido, exploring its unique features, the pros and cons of staking with Lido, and most importantly, its safety measures.\n\nBy the end of this article, you\u2019ll have a clear understanding of Lido staking and the security it offers to its users. So, if you\u2019re considering dipping your toes into the world of crypto staking, this review could be the guide you\u2019ve been waiting for. Let\u2019s dive in!\n\nQuick summary: Lido Finance Topic Summary \ud83d\udd11 Key Features Lido Finance provides a user-friendly interface, maximized earning potential through daily staking rewards and DeFi activities, a native token (LDO), quality audits by reputable firms, and supports popular DeFi wallets like TrustWallet and MetaMask. \ud83d\udc4d Pros Lido Finance offers liquid staking, allowing users to unstake their funds at any time. Users maintain custody of their assets, reducing the risk of losing funds due to security breaches. Lido also aims to provide competitive staking rewards for potential passive income. \ud83d\udc4e Cons Lido charges a 10% fee on staking rewards, which is split between the node operators and the protocol\u2019s treasury. The rewards earned from staking with Lido may be taxable depending on your location and personal tax situation. \ud83d\udcb0 Fees Lido charges a 10% fee on staking rewards earned by users. This fee is divided between the node operators and the protocol\u2019s treasury. Users may also incur Ethereum gas fees when interacting with the Lido protocol. \ud83d\udd04 Alternatives Alternatives to Lido Finance for staking crypto assets include centralized exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance, and other decentralized staking services like Rocketpool.\n\nWhat is Lido Finance?\n\nLido Finance is a decentralized liquid staking protocol that lets users stake Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Polkadot, and Kusama. When staking ETH and other similar assets, the staked tokens are locked for a period, which means you can\u2019t use them as collateral on lending platforms to earn additional yield rewards.\n\nLido aims to solve the problem above by using liquid staking, which allows you to use your staked assets as collateral and earn interest from lending on top of the rewards generated by staking. Lido also has its native token available on many exchanges, called LDO.\n\nLido\u2019s liquid staking process involves depositing and staking native ETH and receiving a new token called stETH, which is equivalent on a 1:1 basis with the staked tokens. Lido\u2019s stETH token is pegged to the value of your staked Ethereum and can be used for on-chain lending and other DeFi activities without the restrictions encountered with normal staking, which lacks a liquid alternative to the token.\n\nHow does Lido work?\n\nWhen you deposit ETH (or other tokens) to the Lido platform, you will receive st-tokens that are pegged to ETH, just like stablecoins are pegged to the US dollar. Users can use st-tokens as collateral or for other DeFi activities. This lets them get the most out of their staked assets and earn the most rewards. Users can turn their liquidity tokens back into their native tokens at any time on the Lido platform.\n\nWho is doing the staking on Lido?\n\nLido Finance is one of the world\u2019s largest staking providers. It is made up of a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) with members like Libertus Capital, Semantic VC, StakeFish, Bitscale Capital, and various angel investors like Kain Warwick from Synthetix or Stani Kulechov (Aave).\n\nIs Lido decentralized?\n\nYes. Lido Finance is a decentralized platform that is owned by a DAO made up of well-known members.\n\nWhat makes up Lido Finance?\n\n1. Lido DAO\n\nThe Lido DAO is owned by members that include leading venture capital firms and angel investors.\n\n2. Staking Service\n\nLido allows users to stack assets such as Ethereum or Solana and receive daily staking rewards while also using the staked tokens as collateral through liquid staking. When compared to other similar staking solutions on the market, Lido\u2019s APR rates are fair. For Ethereum and Polygon, the APR is 6.4%, and for Polkadot, it goes up to 12.9%.\n\n3. Lido\u2019s Derivative Tokens\n\nWhen you deposit ETH or SOL tokens to Lido, you will get the same amount (1:1) of stETH or stSOL tokens, which are pegged to the native tokens and can be used as collateral for loans.\n\nBonded Luna (bLUNA) is another example of a derivative token. It is pegged to Luna and can be used on the Anchor protocol as collateral to borrow stablecoins.\n\n4. Governance Token (LDO)\n\nLDO is the native utility token that Lido DAO uses to give out voting rights, add or remove node operators, and manage how fees are split.\n\n5. Security and Insurance\n\nThe Lido Insurance Fund is a vault contract that stores funds for insurance purposes. This is how Lido protects its users.\n\nWhat fees does Lido charge?\n\nLido charges a 10% fee on your staking rewards, which goes to the node operators and the DAO Treasury. The Lido fee can be changed in the future if the DAO decides to do so via voting.\n\nIs Lido safe and trustworthy?\n\nYes. With billions of dollars in staked assets, Lido is one of the biggest companies in the cryptocurrency staking industry.\n\nHow to stake Ethereum on Lido?\n\nTo start staking Ethereum on Lido, visit here, connect your wallet, select the amount of ETH you wish to stake, and click the submit button.\n\nWhat are the risks of staking using Lido Finance?\n\nSome of the risks involved with staking cryptocurrencies on Lido include potential smart contract vulnerabilities, derivative token stETH losing its peg to the native token, and DAO key management risks,\n\nWho is Lido Finance best suited for?\n\nLido Finance is best for users who are looking to stake assets and use them as collateral at the same time, with the purpose of increasing earnings.\n\nRead also:\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat can I do with Lido-staked ETH\u2753 At the time of writing, your staked ETH tokens on Lido will earn daily staking rewards that average 6.4% APR.
