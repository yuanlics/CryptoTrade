        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nSolana has overtaken Ethereum in key metrics like DEX volumes, NFTs, address activity, and stablecoin transfers.\n\nRunning Solana nodes is 5x more expensive than Ethereum, despite higher throughput.\n\nCostly nodes and developer gaps raise concerns about Solana.\n\nFiredancer client release aims to further decentralize and scale the network.\n\nEthereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) stand as two leading altcoins that have significantly contributed to the growth of cryptocurrency. Ethereum pioneered the use of smart contracts, introducing a new realm of possibilities in blockchain technology. Following this, Solana took these advancements further by significantly enhancing scalability, thereby expanding the potential applications and efficiency of blockchain-based solutions.\n\nIn a recent analysis , Ryan Watkins, co-founder of Syncracy Capital, shed light on Solana\u2019s rising prominence in the blockchain space, particularly in areas where Ethereum previously held dominance.\n\nSolana Is Rallying; Key Metrics Swell\n\nWatkins, in tweet , highlighted that Solana has overtaken Ethereum in several critical metrics. These include\n\nDecentralized exchange (DEX) volumes.\n\nNon-fungible token (NFT) trading volumes.\n\nThe number of active addresses.\n\nTransaction count.\n\nStablecoin transfers.\n\nChange happens fast. Solana now rivals or surpasses Ethereum across: \u2013 DEX Volumes\n\n\u2013 NFT Volumes\n\n\u2013 Active Addresses\n\n\u2013 Transaction Count\n\n\u2013 Stablecoin Transfers \u201cBut Solana isn\u2019t decentralized \ud83d\ude24\u201d Reality: Solana has ~40% the amount of nodes as Ethereum, they\u2019re only ~5x more\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ZBuLiTcXmf \u2014 Ryan Watkins (@RyanWatkins_) December 19, 2023\n\nThe swift change in Solana\u2019s metrics comes at a time when the network has become a focal point for developers and traders alike. In recent trading months, the price of SOL, Solana\u2019s native token, has experienced a significant uptrend. It has successfully breached key resistance levels, leading to the establishment of new highs for 2023.\n\nThe surge in SOL appears to be a catalyst for increased on-chain activities on the Solana network, as evidenced by the rise in transaction counts and metrics like the total value locked (TVL). Since September, SOL has seen its value more than triple from its lows.\n\nCorrespondingly, the network\u2019s decentralized finance (DeFi) TVL, according to data from DeFiLlama , has grown significantly, surpassing $1 billion. This marks a more than threefold increase from its July 2023 levels, which were around $270 million.\n\nSolana\u2019s growing preference among users and developers is largely attributed to its architecture and scalability, enabling cost-effective transactions and smart contract deployments. A key aspect of Solana\u2019s design is its reliance on independent nodes, which are incentivized for participation. This helps foster both decentralization and security within the network.\n\nCost Of Operating Nodes, Decentralization Comparison Arises\n\nWhile Solana\u2019s decentralization has been a topic of debate, Watkins points out that Solana operates with approximately 40% of the nodes that Ethereum has. A significant distinction, however, is the operational cost of Solana\u2019s nodes , which are about five times more expensive than those of Ethereum. According to Watkins\u2019 analysis, the network bears this higher cost in exchange for its throughput capabilities.\n\nData from Syncrancy reveals that running an Ethereum node costs around $550, whereas operating a high-end node on Solana\u2019s Firedancer platform can exceed $5,100. Despite the higher cost, Solana\u2019s nodes offer a substantial increase in throughput, with a transaction per second (TPS) rate of 55,000, compared to Ethereum\u2019s 100 TPS. This difference is a key factor in the shift towards Solana, despite the higher costs associated with its nodes.\n\nThe higher the Nakamoto Coefficient, the more decentralized a network is considered to be. As of December 19, the Nakamoto Coefficient stands at 21 for Solana, indicating no recent change. In comparison, Ethereum\u2019s coefficient is 2 according to Nakaflow data , suggesting that Solana is more decentralized than Ethereum. BeaconScan reports there are more than one million Ethereum nodes currently, while Solana Compass notes more than 2,900 Solana nodes .\n\nRyan Watkins, defending Solana, points out that decentralization involves more than just the node count and geographic distribution. He emphasizes the importance of diversifying Solana\u2019s developer ecosystem and integrating features like light clients for cost-effective user verification.\n\nI\u2019d wager we\u2019ll reach this within the next 3 years. Firedancer is already approaching this point, if it hasn\u2019t already reached it. While other chains will get better, Solana has dominated because it has continually improved on the protocol level, and the application layer \u2014 Joey | Stockpile (@joeymeere) December 20, 2023\n\nSolana\u2019s upcoming release of the Firedancer validator client is intended to further diversify and bolster the network\u2019s robustness and reliability. Notably, this client will enable nodes to produce blocks more rapidly, enhancing the network\u2019s capacity to process a larger volume of transactions on-chain. This development is a step towards scaling the mainnet without relying excessively on off-chain solutions."

        "content": "Despite recent hype surrounding Bitcoin and spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs_, JPMorgan believes that Ethereum will outperform Bitcoin in 2024.\n\nIn a Dec. 13 report, JPMorgan analysts wrote, \"We believe that next year Ethereum will reassert itself and recapture market share within the crypto ecosystem.\"\n\nThe analysts reason that the Ethereum EIP-4844 upgrade, also known as the Proto-Danksharding upgrade, is expected to take place during the first half of 2024 and is part of a multistep plan to make sharding more efficient on the Ethereum chain.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThough the process is complex, the idea is that it will allow shards to be analyzed in larger groups instead of a system that splits Ethereum into several shard chains. This upgrade will have a significant impact on Layer 2 solutions such as Polygon and Optimism. This is because it will allow these projects to have more access to network power, which will increase throughput and reduce transaction costs.\n\nJPMorgan believes that these upgrades will bring more investors to Ethereum and cause it to regain market share in the crypto sphere.\n\nJPMorgan is not saying that the price of Ethereum will appreciate. The analysts are \"cautious\" about crypto markets in 2024. They see Ethereum as one of the stronger tokens for 2024. While it may not go up in price, they still believe that it will perform better than other tokens, specifically Bitcoin.\n\nTrending: This brokerage offers custom rewards for users to switch \u2013 the biggest reward so far for 1 user is $19,977.48. Will yours beat it?\n\nDespite recent hype around spot Bitcoin ETF approvals and the upcoming Bitcoin halving, JPMorgan is still more bullish on ETH. The analysts believe that the spot Bitcoin ETFs are already priced in. Since approval seems imminent, they believe that markets have already priced in the impact this will have on Bitcoin. They cite the recent Bitcoin run-up as evidence for this.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey also think that the upcoming Bitcoin halving is already priced in. They looked at the ratio of Bitcoin's market price to production cost and saw that it decreased after the most recent halving in 2020. They expect a similar move will follow in 2024.\n\nOther topics discussed in the report revolved around their lack of confidence in decentralized finance (DeFi). They have not seen noticeable impacts of DeFi on the current financial system.\n\n\"The biggest applications of blockchain to traditional finance, i.e. overnight repo transactions via smart contracts in blockchain platforms hosted by companies such as Broadridge and JPMorgan, take place outside public blockchains,\" the analysts said. They also discussed interoperability and central bank digital currencies.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article JPMorgan Says Ethereum Will Outperform Bitcoin In 2024 originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2023 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Solana\u2019s native asset SOL flipped XRP this morning to again become the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nAfter gaining more than 700% since its market bottomed out at the end of last year, SOL is now valued at nearly $34 billion. XRP and SOL trail only binance coin (BNB), tether (USDT), ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC).\n\nThis makes SOL one of the best performing top-100 cryptocurrencies of 2023. XRP, meanwhile, has only made about 80% \u2014 about the same as ether \u2014 but both have underperformed against bitcoin this year.\n\nXRP must still deal with a jury trial in Ripple\u2019s long-running US Securities and Exchange Commission saga. A federal court in July found the firm\u2019s programmatic sales to retail investors through crypto exchanges and other platforms didn\u2019t amount to securities, while direct sales to institutional investors did.\n\nRead more: Judge rules in SEC case vs Ripple\n\nThe trial, set for next spring, should finally determine to what extent Ripple Labs is culpable for flouting US securities laws, after the SEC dropped its charges against Ripple executives Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen in October. A settlement in the meantime is still possible.\n\nWhile Solana spent most of the third quarter of 2021 \u2014 peak bull market \u2014 ahead of XRP and a top-five coin behind tether, its more recent overperformance can in part be explained by how severely it crashed around the FTX debacle last November.\n\nClick play to watch Solana recover from its crash last year\n\nSam Bankman-Fried was invested heavily in projects across the Solana space, including SOL itself, and the crypto crashed by nearly two-thirds in three days when the market lost faith in cryptocurrencies orbiting the FTX co-founder. BTC and ETH meanwhile took only a 20% hit.\n\nSolana was a top-10 token before FTX\u2019s downfall, worth about half as much as XRP. In the months after, Solana ranked at the tail end of the top 20, behind polkadot (DOT), tron (TRX) and memecoin shiba inu (SHIB).\n\nNever underestimate the power of dog coins\n\nSolana has been busy catching up all year, propelled in part by a commitment from its developers to shake the network\u2019s association with Bankman-Fried, whose entities still hold claim to nearly $2 billion in SOL at current prices to be unlocked over the next few years.\n\nThe network boasts much of the same utility as smart contract-enabled blockchains like Ethereum, Tron, Avalanche and BNB Chain, albeit with its own unique brand of consensus, technology and tokenomics developed by San Francisco-based Solana Labs.\n\nApps and tokens run atop Solana, including decentralized exchanges, lending protocols and NFT marketplaces.\n\nSolana\u2019s overall dominance, which measures how much of the entire market is SOL, is at 2.13%, 0.6 percentage points lower than its November 2021 record.\n\nHype around new Solana-centric projects has helped inspire a certain Solanaissance. BONK, the network\u2019s resident dog coin, has seen its price multiply 100 times over the past two months \u2014 even after a healthy 50% correction this week.\n\nRead more: BONK\u2019s price pumped harder around Coinbase listing than any other crypto this year\n\nBONK mania even led to significant markups for Solana-branded smartphones upon realization that each one had been preloaded with 30 million BONK ($550) \u2014 about the same as the retail value of the device.\n\nElsewhere, the liquid staking protocol Jito airdropped $165 million worth of its new token, JTO, to its users earlier this month. Traders pushed the price of JTO higher following the distribution, with the whole process adding about $300 million in market value to the Solana ecosystem.\n\nLoading Tweet.. BONK and Jito are combining forces to seed Solana users with Christmas cheer\n\nThe anticipation of further airdrops scaled to Solana activity has since helped drive on-chain volumes to yearly highs.\n\nSolana\u2019s total value locked (TVL) across its network is also up, now at $1 billion compared to $300 million in September.\n\nAlthough, that jump is mostly attributed to the rising price of SOL; there\u2019s currently 14 million SOL locked on the network right now, one-third less than the 21 million SOL staked at the start of the year, and 25% less than in September.\n\nSolana almost closer than ever to flipping Ethereum\n\nIn any case, now that SOL seems set to stay ahead of XRP, some might wonder how far away it is from eclipsing BNB. The token is the native asset for Binance\u2019s blockchain network BNB Chain, and Binance users can also use it to cover trading fees and participation in initial coin offerings and the like.\n\nBNB faces its own set of challenges due to Binance\u2019s run-in with US regulators, which has resulted in mammoth fines, a years-long financial surveillance mandate and the exit of co-founder Changpeng Zhao as CEO.\n\nRead more: Binance says the SEC can\u2019t use DOJ plea deals as proof of guilt\n\nTurns out, outside of the last bull market\u2019s peak in late 2021, solana has never been closer to flipping BNB in their shared history. BNB\u2019s market cap is now just 20% more than SOL\u2019s, down drastically from 300% higher only three months ago.\n\nThe gap between Solana and Ethereum is still a long way off completely closing\n\nSolana\u2019s hopes of flipping Ethereum seem far less realistic right now. But there is progress: Ethereum\u2019s market value is now about 700% more than Solana\u2019s, its lowest point since peak bull market in 2021.\n\nETH was worth nearly 40 times more than Solana at the start of the year.\n\nSOL would still need to hit a price equal to more than twice its current all-time high, multiplying eight times to $625, to reach ETH\u2019s current valuation. Ethereum, of course, would have to stagnate the entire time.\n\nSo, if Solana flipping Ethereum were to happen at all, it would likely take multiple bull and bear cycles for Solana to properly narrow the gap.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Lisk LSK +4.99% , a Layer 1 blockchain launched in 2016, is transitioning to the Ethereum ecosystem as a Layer 2 solution.\n\nThe new Lisk network will be powered by OP Stack, Optimism\u2019s open-source framework for developing Layer 2 chains, and built using Gelato\u2019s rollup-as-a-service platform. Lisk's Layer 2 will focus on real-world assets and decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs), according to a statement.\n\n\u201cIntegrating with the Ethereum ecosystem and aligning with industry standards brings us closer to our goal of making blockchain accessible than ever before,\u201d Lisk co-founder Max Kordek said.\n\nBack in the heyday of the 2017 bull market, Lisk was a top 20 cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Fast-forward to 2023, and as the blockchain industry has matured, Lisk finds itself comparatively out of favor, falling to 272 in the rankings as its market cap declined 83% from $919 million to $152 million. With the widespread adoption of the Ethereum Virtual Machine, Lisk said it now sees a better opportunity to expedite its mission by migrating to become an Ethereum Layer 2.\n\nThe testnet deployment of Lisk\u2019s Layer 2 network is scheduled for the first quarter of 2024 ahead of a mainnet launch, enabling developers to access up to 90% cheaper fees than the Ethereum mainnet, the Lisk team said.\n\nLSK token migration and airdrop\n\nThe transition also involves the migration of the LSK token to Ethereum, designed to improve its usability across various dApps and DeFi protocols in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nLisk said existing reward-sharing mechanisms for LSK will continue, with the token also used for on-chain governance in an upcoming Lisk DAO.\n\nLisk also plans an initial airdrop of LSK tokens to incentivize activity on the new chain, with more details expected leading up to its mainnet launch.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nJoining the Optimism Superchain via Gelato\n\nLisk joins Optimism and the Coinbase-incubated Layer 2 Base in utilizing the OP Stack, becoming the first Layer 1 to contribute to the development of the Optimism Superchain network of Layer 2 blockchains, the team said.\n\n\u201cLisk\u2019s transition to the OP Stack underscores our conviction that Layer 2s are the path to scaling not just Ethereum, but the blockchain movement itself,\u201d Optimism Foundation Chief Scientist Ben Jones added.\n\nLisk is also collaborating with Ethereum rollup-as-a-service platform Gelato to build the Layer 2, allowing it to deploy the OP chain in just a few clicks without writing any additional code. Gelato will let Lisk integrate infrastructure and web3 services such as block explorers, bridges and oracles from launch.\n\n\u201cUsing Gelato\u2019s Rollup-as-a-Service platform allows the Lisk research and development team to be primarily focused on building additional products and tooling that developers and end users love, while also committing resources to the Superchain\u2019s development,\u201d Lisk Chief Project Officer Dominic Schwenter said.\n\nThe collaboration follows an expansion of Gelato\u2019s platform, also announced today, to include OP Stack support in addition to Polygon CDK.\n\n\u201cWe have known the team since our early days together in Berlin, and are excited to finally be able to work together more closely,\u201d Gelato co-founder Hilmar Orth said. \u201cBy embracing Ethereum's ecosystem and porting its existing community onto a powerful Layer 2 blockchain using Gelato, we are collectively shaping the future of web3 scalability. The Lisk ecosystem will benefit greatly from better access to liquidity, developers and sequencing fee revenue generated from its Layer 2 blockchain.\u201d\n\n\"We are excited that Gelato has extended support to the Superchain as a RaaS provider for Lisk, making it easier for developers to onboard new users into the Superchain ecosystem,\" Optimism Foundation\u2019s Ben Jones added."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest crypto by market cap, has surged by over 87% since the beginning of the year. Although the growth is commendable, ETH\u2019s rise in 2023 is overshadowed by Solana\u2019s (SOL) over 500% growth and Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) over 150% growth in the same time frame. Nonetheless, analysts anticipate the asset to rally to new highs in the next bull run.\n\nETH is currently up 3% in the daily charts and 0.9% in the last week. Moreover, the token\u2019s price has surged by over 14% over the previous month.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum: What Are Institutional Investors Buying?\n\nDespite the healthy rise in 2023, ETH is still down by over 50% from its all-time high of $4,878.26, which it attained on Nov. 10, 2021.\n\nHow to be a millionaire when Ethereum (ETH) hits $3000?\n\nSource: Investopedia\n\nReaching $3000 from current levels amounts to a growth of about 33%. To have a million dollars worth of Ethereum at $3000, you would need around 333.33 ETH tokens. The cost of 333.33 ETH at current prices is about $747,333.\n\nHowever, if ETH reaches its all-time high of $4878.26, the same investment would be worth around $1,626,000 ($1.62 million).\n\nNow, the question is whether Ethereum (ETH) will reach its all-time high again or not. The short answer is yes. There is a high chance of ETH not only hitting but surpassing its previous all-time peak.\n\nAlso Read: JP Morgan Says Ethereum Will Outperform Bitcoin in 2024\n\nAccording to Changelly, Ethereum (ETH) could surpass its all-time high by 2025. According to the platform, ETH could hit a maximum price of $5,930.32 in 2025.\n\nHowever, if the crypto markets enter a bull run in 2024, fueled by a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF (Exchange Traded Fund), Ethereum could hit a new all-time high much sooner, making some holders millionaires. All significant cryptocurrencies may hit new peaks if the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) approves one or more spot BTC ETF applications."

        "title": "Ethereum Exchange Balances Drop Drastically, What This Means For ETH Price - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum is currently ranging around $2,200, with its price undergoing a calm volatility in the past 7 days. New data from Santiment has revealed the current sentiment among Ethereum whale addresses, as the total supply on exchanges recently hit a new low. According to the on-chain analytics platform, more than 240,000 ETH have left 10 of the biggest ETH exchange wallets in the past 24 hours.\n\nAs a result, the cumulative number of ETH deposited across crypto exchanges dropped from 8.03 million ETH to 7.79 million ETH in a single day, one of the largest it has ever seen. With the current price of ETH hovering around $2,200, this represents a drop of over $528 million worth of ETH in exchange balances.\n\nEthereum Exchange Supply Plummets\n\nEthereum is currently down by 1.74% in the past 24 hours and is currently retesting its breakout level of around $2,200 which seems to have turned into a support. However, the drastic drop in Ethereum balances on exchanges is a very bullish sign for ETH. With less ETH available on exchanges, supply is reduced.\n\nETH whales have been on a buying spree since the beginning of the month, as many look forward to an extended bull run at the dawn of the new year. Data from IntoTheBlock put a 98.52% increase in exchange outflow volume in the past 30 days. Just last week alone, whales bought more than 100,000 ETH worth $230 million.\n\nThis sentiment continued into this week, with 240,000 ETH leaving exchanges in 24 hours, leading to a 2.99% drop in coins held on exchanges. According to Santiment, only 8.07% of Ethereum\u2019s total supply currently sits on exchanges, the lowest it has ever been.\n\n\ud83d\udc4d As #Ethereum\u2018s market value hangs just above $2,170, the largest exchange wallets continue to move coins into smaller wallets or off exchanges entirely. 240K $ETH has been collectively moved from these wallets in 24 hours, a 2.99% drop in coins held. https://t.co/Fw7lKcVZan pic.twitter.com/AMFPDL4BXp \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 19, 2023\n\nETH has failed to clear the $2,250 price level, falling to $2,120 in the late hours of December 19. At the time of writing, ETH is now trading at $2,208. Price action suggests the crypto is still yet to gain strong traction among retail investors and is ongoing a retest.\n\nAccording to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Ethereum is bouncing around its breakout zone from an ascending triangle. If this consolidation continues, we could see a price range between $2,150 and $1,900 before a breakout to a target of $3,500.\n\n#Ethereum is currently retesting its breakout zone from an ascending triangle, hinting at preparation for a further climb. The price range between $2,150 and $1,900 could be the ideal zone for accumulation before #ETH sets its sights on a higher target of $3,500. pic.twitter.com/6lGZT0ZKgv \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) December 20, 2023\n\nEthereum is up by 82.67% this year and the outlook for 2024 remains bullish. According to crypto analyst Altcoin Daily, ETH\u2019s journey to $10,000 seems sure at the moment, pending Ethereum Spot ETFs a major catalyst for this price growth.\n\nETH bulls continue to maintain control | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Cointribune, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

In its decision, Grayscale pointed out that ETHW has yet to develop \u201cmeaningful liquidity, while the products\u2019 custodian doesn\u2019t support such tokens.\u201d As a result, the firm\u2019s rights to buy and sell ETHW tokens for its clients could not be fulfilled.\n\nRelated: Ethereum community adopts ERC-3643 as standard for compliant asset tokenization\n\nETHW tokens reached an all-time high of $100 in August 2022, when they were first launched, but have now fallen to $2.59.

        "title": "SEC Viewing Ethereum as a Commodity? Bloomberg Analyst Sees ETF Shift Happening - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nSEC chairman Gary Gensler has often argued that all cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin are securities.\n\nHowever, as Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart recently pointed out, the agency has increasingly treated Ethereum as a commodity.\n\nBased on its acceptance of ETH futures, Seyffart anticipates the SEC approving spot Ethereum ETFs in 2024.\n\nUnited States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler has often asserted that all cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin are securities. But when the SEC accused Binance, Coinbase and Kraken of selling unregistered securities this year, one cryptocurrency \u2013 Ethereum \u2013 was conspicuously absent from the charges.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, \u201cthe SEC has pretty much implicitly accepted Ethereum as a commodity\u201d. From this, he concludes that if approved, spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) could be followed by ETH-based ones.\n\nETH Futures Suggests SEC Acceptance of Commodity Status\n\nWhen the CME Group applied for permission to launch the first Ethereum futures contracts in 2021, it claimed ETH was a commodity. Therefore, it was not subject to regulation by the SEC.\n\nThe SEC could have object then, if it wanted to argue that Ethereum was a security. By choosing not to do so, the SEC implicitly endorsed CME Group\u2019s claim that Ether is a commodity.\n\nSince then, the Commission has granted permission for ETFs to invest in ETH futures, further cementing the idea that Ethereum stands alongside Bitcoin as one of just 2 cryptocurrencies apparently considered commodities by the SEC.\n\nOf course, the potential hypocrisy of the SEC granting Ethereum commodity status while simultaneously arguing that almost every other token is a security hasn\u2019t been lost on XRP supporters.\n\nAs long as the regulator distinguishes Ethereum and the majority of altcoins, it is likely that charges of double standards will continue to abound.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETFs Incoming?\n\nBetween the arrival of Bitcoin futures ETFs and the SEC\u2019s approval of the first ETH futures funds, more than two years passed. Yet, with uncertainty still hanging over potential spot Bitcoin ETFs, asset managers are already lining up to launch equivalent Ethereum funds.\n\nUpdate: @vaneck_us receives a delay order on their spot #Ethereum ETF Filing. This was expected and due on December 25th. Expecting a delay order for Ark/21Shares today as well which is due on December 26th i believe. pic.twitter.com/GLTx7vCQr5 \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) December 18, 2023\n\nAfter Blackrock fired the starting gun on the race to launch spot Ethereum ETFs in November, it was soon joined by the likes of Ark Invest and VanEck.\n\nWith the SEC due to make decisions on those applications no later than mid-Summer, Seyffart said: \u201cIt\u2019s likely to happen in 2024.\u201d"

        "content": "MicroStockHub / iStock.com\n\nFollowing last year\u2019s disastrous landscape for the crypto ecosystem \u2014 a year marred by scandals, collapses, losses and lawsuits \u2014 2023 fared better. While the industry is still reeling from these developments, some assets have been slowly gaining ground.\n\nLost Money on Crypto in 2023? This Trick Could Help You Pay 0% Capital Gains Tax\n\nFind: 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\n\nIn turn, many experts argue that 2024 is off to a good start, with some cryptos poised to significantly progress. As of Dec. 20, the global cryptocurrency market cap was $1.72 trillion, according to CoinGecko.\n\nBitcoin\n\nPrice as of Dec. 20: $44,130\n\nPast year: up 160.9%\n\nYear-to-date: up 166.46%\n\nPast 30 days: up 17.8%\n\nAll-time high: $68,789.63 on Nov. 10, 2021\n\nMany experts are very bullish on Bitcoin for 2024 due to a combination of factors that could provide a perfect storm situation for the asset.\n\nAs David Waugh, lead analyst at Coinbits, explained, one significant development is the expected approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) in January- which could result- according to analysts from Galaxy Research- in $14.4 billion of institutional inflows into Bitcoin in the first year, exerting significant upward pressure on its price.\n\nAnother factor is that by the end of this year, Congress could also pass comprehensive crypto legislation providing the industry with much-needed regulatory clarity, making Bitcoin more attractive to banks \u2013 allowing banks to work with Bitcoin companies to enhance the services they can offer consumers, he said.\n\nFinally, another key catalyst is the Bitcoin halving event slated for April, which occurs once every four years and has always been associated with a massive price increase in the months before and after the event, according to Ric Edelman, founder, Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals.\n\n\u201cThe impact of these developments on bitcoin\u2019s price are expected to be substantial, with many predicting future bitcoin prices of $100,000 to $1.5 million,\u201d said Edelman. \u201cI\u2019m expecting Bitcoin\u2019s price to reach $150,000 by Dec 2025.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum\n\nPrice as of Dec. 20: $2,255\n\nPast year: up 84.7%\n\nYear-to-date: up 87.9%\n\nPast 30 days: up 10.3%\n\nAll-time high: $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021\n\nEther underperformed Bitcoin in 2023 with a gain of \u201conly\u201d 80%, trading roughly in line with its peer group in the smart contract platforms crypto sector, said Zach Pandl, Grayscale\u2018s managing director of research.\n\nPandl added that there has been extensive debate about Ethereum\u2019s competitive landscape as 2023 comes to a close, and he expects this to continue into 2024.\n\n\u201cGrayscale Research remains optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s outlook despite better performance from some other Smart Contract Platform tokens in 2023 (such as SOL or AVAX), as Ethereum network will go through an upgrade in the first quarter, that could support is \u201cmodular\u201d scaling plan,\u201d he said. Another driver could be any progress on the regulatory approval on spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. market, which could support token valuation, as well, he added.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP\n\nPrice as of Dec. 20: $0.621\n\nPast year: up 78.2%\n\nYear-to-date: up 84.25%\n\nPast 30 days: 0.00%\n\nAll-time high: Jan. 4, 2018, at $3.84\n\nAs Aaron Rafferty\u2019s CEO of StandardDAO and co-founder of BattlePACs, while XRP has increased significantly, it still remains 81.78% below its all-time high.\n\n\u201cWe have seen a turbulent albeit positive year with an SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) win and many acquisitions out of Ripple including toward real world asset tokenization,\u201d he said. \u201cExpect strong price trends for this payment rail.\u201d\n\nChainlink\n\nPrice as of Dec. 20: $14.66\n\nPast year: up 142%\n\nYear-to-date: up 164.85%\n\nPast 30 days: down 3.3%\n\nAll-time high: May 9, 2021, at $52.88\n\nAccording to Rafferty, the year-to-date rise demonstrates robust growth potential, standing 74% below its peak.\n\n\u201cPast bull run gains were 1400%+ and typically run prior to other players,\u201d he said. \u201cLINK\u2019s expansion into enterprise solutions, including collaborations with major players like Google, SWIFT, and Oracle, provides a vital security layer between blockchains and real-world data.\u201d\n\nOther Assets and Trends\n\nLee Taylor, the founder of MonarchX, said that in addition to Chainlink, if you\u2019re looking for the unicorn altcoins of 2024, I think Solana, Avalanche and Algorand should be top performers.\n\n\u201cALGO, which features low costs, is particularly well-suited to content creators. While seeing a dip earlier this year, it is up a whopping 38% over the past month, and it should continue to see high growth into 2024,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, AVAX is in a similar position, up over 75% in the past month alone. It is likely that these unicorns are well-positioned to see 100% growth over the next year.\n\nBitcoin-related assets, which have been on a roll lately, are also something worth watching, according to several experts.\n\nFor instance, \u201cOrdinals\u201d -NFTs on Bitcoin- or, as Decrypt explained, \u201cdigital assets inscribed on a satoshi, the lowest denomination of a Bitcoin,\u201d have garnered a lot of interest lately.\n\nNow, whether they have staying power remains to be seen, according to Grayscale\u2019s Pandl.\n\nAccording to Austin Alexander, co-founder of LayerTwo Labs, building on Bitcoin-related assets and networks is a big trend in the coming year.\n\n\u201cThere are many people who had never touched Bitcoin \u2013 they\u2019re altcoiners \u2013 who are now getting into Bitcoin because of Ordinals and other related assets,\u201d he said. \u201cBitcoin has the most liquidity of any decentralized network, and it\u2019s also the most secure, so this all makes BTC more desirable. Bitcoin\u2019s network effects are powerful, and I think we\u2019ll see the broader Bitcoin ecosystem flourish in the year ahead.\u201d\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Why Bitcoin, Ethereum and 2 More Cryptos Are Poised To Boom in 2024"

This represents a nearly fourfold increase in just a few days.\n\nThe protocol's total value locked (TVL) has climbed from $250 million to over $900 million following adjustments to deposit caps for liquid staking assets. EigenLayer raised its re-staking limit from 120,000 ETH to 500,000 ETH, equivalent to approximately $1.1 billion.\n\nEigenLayer enables users to deposit and \"re-stake\" ether from various liquid staking tokens (LSTs) to secure third-party networks. The protocol's stage 1 launched on the Ethereum mainnet in June. In addition to supporting LSTs from Lido, Rocket Pool, and Coinbase at launch, EigenLayer has expanded its range to include six additional LSTs: Swell's swETH, Stakewise's sETH, Stader's xETH, Origin's oETH, Ankr's ankrETH, and Wrapped Beacon Ether (wBETH).\n\nThe increase in deposit caps and the wider range of LSTs have fueled a surge in activity, with many users depositing funds to participate in the network and earn points. EigenLabs, the company behind EigenLayer, closed a $50 million Series A funding round in March, led by Blockchain Capital.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Could Drop Another 5%; Here\u2019s Why a Bearish Scenario May Play Out Well - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "A passionate cryptocurrency and blockchain author qualified to cover every event in the crypto space. Researching minute occurrences and bringing new insights lie within the prime focus of my task.\n\nAfter consolidating below $2000 for the first three quarters, the Ethereum price triggered a massive jump after hitting the lows below $1600. This caused the price to soar by over 55%, which began at the beginning of November, reaching a high close to $2400. This jump was believed to be the start of a fresh bullish run, intending to form a new ATH beyond $5000. However, the correction that followed the ETH price is displaying the possibility of offering a buy at the dip moment very soon.\n\nThe recent drop now indicates the price is all set to plunge by another 5% to 6% in the coming days. The trend is descending, heading towards the lower support close to $2000, offering another entry for the long trades. The volume profile of the previous consolidation structure is around $2053, which is a point of control where most of the contracts were traded. The markets usually react to these types of levels very strongly; hence, a bounce could be expected.\n\nThe bears are trying hard to outperform the bulls by exercising extensive upward pressure. The rally is now forming constant lower highs and lows, indicating the growing strength among the bears as the selling pressure accumulates. Also, the price has dropped below the elevating trend line that has been acting as a strong support in recent times. Furthermore, the bears thwarted a new attempt to rise above these levels.\n\nAdding more substance, the RSI is failing constantly to rise above average levels, suggesting the weakness piling up among the bulls. This could hamper the progress of the rally, which has already been flashing bearish signals. The ETH price is trying hard to rise above the crucial trend line, but if the bulls fail to do so, a fresh bearish wave may drag it lower towards support.\n\nHowever, the bulls may quickly jump into finding the token within the liquidity range, but if they manage to break above the upper resistance in the next few days, the bearish scenario may be invalidated. In such a case, the Ethereum price target for 2023 could be beyond $2,450 to $2,500."

        "content": "Traders backed widespread recoveries across the market after many cryptocurrencies had snapped out of their uptrends on Friday. The cooldown continued during the weekend, with Ethereum price sweeping through lower support areas at $2,115.\n\nMeanwhile, growing optimism ahead of the likely approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January is keeping the crypto market not only buoyant but also bullish.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe largest smart contracts token, ETH regained momentum on Monday and was trading 4% higher on Tuesday at $2,230. Bitcoin price is equally strong, up 4.3% to $42,940 while Binance Coin (BNB), the token native to the largest crypto exchange traded 6.6% higher at $250.\n\nRead also: Crypto Price Prediction For December 19: WOO, ICP, ADA\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: ETH Flaunts Potential Wedge Breakout\n\nThe rejection from the new 2023 high at $2,400 has seen Ethereum consolidate, creating a series of lower highs and lower lows. In other words, the token has printed a falling wedge pattern on the four-hour chart, awaiting confirmation before breaking out.\n\nThe falling wedge, in this case, is a continuation pattern, which bulls can tap to resume the uptrend targeting highs above $3,000. However, its formation alone is not enough, which means Ether price must rise above the upper falling trendline to validate the breakout.\n\nIf the immediate support at $2,230, provided by the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (in red) is respected, Ethereum price would have a higher probability of breaking past the wedge pattern and rising 10% to $2,500.\n\nIf losses intensify due to more profit-taking among investors, Ethereum could tap the 20 EMA (in blue) for support to ensure that chances of the wedge pattern breakout remain high, especially with the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator sending a buy signal.\n\nFollowing the wedge pattern breakout, key milestones to look forward to start with defeating resistance at $2,260, $2,300, and $2,360. Further gains above $2,400 would call on more traders to enter long positions in Ethereum and provide additional tail force to propel the token toward $3,000.\n\nSince the Money Flow Index (MFI) is trending north above the midline (50), it can be deduced that there\u2019s more bullish pressure than selling pressure. However, the situation could change, especially if the two higher support areas at the 20 EMA and 50 EMA weaken.\n\nIf push comes to shove, some traders may decide to close their positions based on their risk tolerance, and wait to buy ETH again when it finally taps a solid support, for instance, the 200 EMA (purple) at $42,150.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Investors are sifting through the noise to identify gems that are likely to significantly breakout ahead of Christmas and New Year celebrations. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) stand out as the most stable investments in a crypto portfolio, select best-performing top altcoins could be the game changer, considering the gains posted by Ethereum Express (ETH), Bonk (BONK) and Stacks (STX).\n\nAlthough the crypto market widely reversed gains accrued last week from Friday through to Monday, the anticipation of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) approval in January has helped to steady the prices and may explain the 3% increase in market cap to $1.66 trillion, live data by CoinMarketCap shows.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Express Tops Top Altcoins To Buy For 2024\n\nEthereum Express (ETE) is slowly catching investor interest, as one of the most viable tokens that could potentially break out this week. Up 8% in the last 24 hours, the crypto powering the network known for faster, safer, and cheaper layer 1 transactions, is trading at $0.0413.\n\nLike other cryptos, Ethereum Express encountered strong headwinds last week, forcing bulls to temporarily abandon the push for the uptrend at $0.043. A correction followed swiftly, as traders closed positions to protect their capital and accrued gains.\n\nThe first tentative support at $0.03 failed to relieve the selling pressure but ETE respected the next crucial level slightly above $0.021. This support area encouraged traders to enter new long positions, boosting Ethereum Express recovery.\n\nA cup and handle pattern drawn on the four-hour chart reveals a potential 71% breakout to $0.07. However, ETE must rise above the neckline resistance at $0.0413 to validate the breakout.\n\nBased on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator a stronger momentum backs the uptrend in ETE. Therefore, traders considering more exposure, could long Ethereum Express as soon as it breaks or successfully retests the neckline resistance.\n\nBonk Pauses Price Discovery, Here\u2019s What Next\n\nInvestors who bought Bonk to speculate on exchange listings on Coinbase and Binance last week have been selling to lock in the profits made. This has continued to weigh down on the meme coin built on the Solana blockchain, with losses extending from a recent all-time high of $0.000035 to $0.000019, down 1.4% in 24 hours.\n\nDespite the meltdown, Bonk upholds a 160% increase in a fortnight and 445% in a month.\n\nThe outlook from the MACD reinforces the bearish theory. Meanwhile, all eyes are on the confluence support created by the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (in red) and the purple horizontal ray at $0.00001891 to trigger another buying spree and boost Bonk\u2019s recovery back to the ATH.\n\nIf the downtrend carries on below the highlighted immediate support, traders may want to consider entering short positions in BONK and targeting lower support areas at $0.000016, $0.000013, and the 200 EMA (in purple) at $0.0000109.\n\nOn the other side of the fence, Bonk may resume the uptrend quickly if the confluence support holds and a breakout follows above the descending channel. While Bonk is still one of the best crypto performers in December, finding a good entry position is the tricky part.\n\nStacks Price Prediction: Will STX Validate Cup and Handle Breakout?\n\nStacks price extended the up leg on Tuesday with another 1.5% increase in 24 hours in addition to a 22% growth in seven days and an 87% rise in a month. The token native to one of Bitcoin\u2019s most reliable smart contracts layer, allowing developers to build apps is trading at $1.19 after running into resistance at $1.26.\n\nWith a short-term cup and handle likely to lead to another breakout, the headache investors have is finding a suitable entry position. However, if STX breaks above the neckline resistance at $1.19, the next breakout could rise 30% to $1.82.\n\nFor now, the path with the least resistance based on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is downwards. Bears have the upper hand, especially with Stacks trading below a broken support \u2014 now resistance at $1.2.\n\nIf declines continue in the handle section of the pattern, traders may want to spot other tentative support areas, starting with the 20 EMA at $1.12, the buyer congestion at $1.1, and the 200 EMA at $0.895.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz says the top two crypto assets by market cap could explode past previous all-time highs if institutions start allocating small amounts of capital to digital assets.\n\nIn a new interview with CNBC, the billionaire says that the US government\u2019s growing inability to maintain a budget and avoid deficits is bullish for crypto.\n\nFaced with the likelihood of higher inflation and lower interest rates, Novogratz says that if institutions decide to allocate even small amounts of their portfolio to crypto, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) would experience a supply crunch and go parabolic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been down to D.C. a lot in the last four months. If I had any faith that we would get a Simpson Bowles amendment to balance the budget or have any fiscal prudence, I wouldn\u2019t be as bullish on Bitcoin. But I just don\u2019t, and we\u2019re going into an election year.\n\nSo you\u2019ll have a Fed cutting with a 5% budget deficit and a projected 5% budget deficit next year and the following year. If people start shifting 1% of their portfolio, institutions, 1%, not 10, just 1, there isn\u2019t a lot of supply in Bitcoin or Ethereum.\u201d\n\nNovogratz, an early Ethereum investor, says that Bitcoin is entering an unprecedented supply and demand dynamic that he believes could easily put BTC well above its previous all-time high.\n\n\u201cWe have customers that are platform customers and buy enough Bitcoin every day to take out all the miners. So when you think about the supply/demand dynamic, we haven\u2019t really had a situation where you have a global market and something of such limited supply. And so I think Bitcoin can go far higher. I think the first stop next year will be the old highs, $69,000, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if it went beyond that.\u201d\n\nBTC is worth $42,411 at time of writing, while ETH is trading for $2,194.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

ETH is up over 3% and the price could gain pace if it clears the $2,250 resistance.\n\nEthereum is moving higher from the $2,120 support zone.\n\nThe price is trading above $2,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $2,210 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could climb further higher if it clears the $2,250 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum Price Restarts Increase\n\nEthereum price extended its decline below the $2,150 level. ETH remained strong above the $2,120 level. A low was formed near $2,116 and the price started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a move above the $2,150 and $2,200 resistance levels. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,332 swing high to the $2,116 low. There was also a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $2,210 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $2,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,250 level. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,332 swing high to the $2,116 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next key resistance is near the $2,280 level. A clear move above the $2,280 zone could send the price toward the $2,330 level. The next resistance sits at $2,400. Any more gains could start a wave toward the $2,550 level, above which Ethereum might rally and test the $2,750 zone.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,250 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,210 level or the 100 hourly SMA.\n\nThe first key support could be the $2,200 zone. A downside break and a close below $2,200 might start another major decline. In the stated case, Ether could revisit the $2,120 support.

        "content": "Shiba Inu lead developer Shytoshi Kusama calls the broader crypto community to join SHIB\u2019s move for authentic domain naming and digital identities.\n\nThe enigmatic leader of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, Shytoshi Kusama, has invited the Ethereum community to support Shiba Inu\u2019s latest groundbreaking move related to top-level domain (TLD) extension.\n\nFor context, Shiba Inu has taken steps to be the first Web3 project to secure a top-level domain. The initiative involves creating a \u201c.shib\u201d TLD, enabling users to register distinct names for worldwide recognition within the domain name system.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe Shiba Inu team disclosed the initiative in its seventh edition of the Shib Magazine, published in the last 24 hours.\n\nGiven the pioneering nature of the endeavor, Kusama took to X to extend an invitation to the Ethereum community.\n\nNote that members of the Ethereum community currently use the \u201c.eth\u201d name tag, although their \u201c.eth\u201d extension does not resolve in all standard web browsers, since it is not a top-level domain.\n\nTagging Nick Johnson, the architect and lead developer of Ethereum Name Service (ENS), the Shiba Inu ecosystem leader remarked:\n\n\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cI hope you and the rest of the Ethereum family will support our charge!\u201d\n\n@nicksdjohnson so uhm\u2026 I hope you and the rest of the eth family will support our charge ! \u2014 Shytoshi Kusama\u2122 (@ShytoshiKusama) December 19, 2023\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s Coming TLD\n\nThe coming \u201c.shib\u201d domain extension will be unlike the ones in the crypto sphere, such as the \u201c.eth,\u201d which merely facilitates decentralized naming for wallet addresses.\n\nSpecifically, \u201c.eth\u201d aids in identifying Ethereum addresses in a human-readable format. This eliminates the need for users to memorize long strings of digits and letters when sharing their wallet information or receiving Ethereum tokens.\n\nHowever, the Shiba Inu ecosystem is pushing the boundaries of functionality even further. Shiba Inu has joined forces with D3 Global, a prominent domain firm, to pursue this ambitious objective.\n\nD3 Global specializes in bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3. Emphatically, through this collaboration with Shiba Inu, D3 Global will introduce digital identities for Shiba Inu enthusiasts under the \u201c.shib\u201d name.\n\nIt will provide users with a practical domain to access the advantages of Web3, including enhanced security, privacy, and interoperability."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) network data shows the digital currency is primed for bullish moves.\n\nAccording to data presented by top market analyst Ali Martinez, Ethereum is seeing a steady increase in the number of new addresses. Specifically, the current data presented shows that new Ethereum addresses soared to a higher high as of December 19.\n\nNew addresses entering a network hint at a growing interest in accumulation, a trend that might ultimately boost the price of the asset in question.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nDespite the inherent Ethereum FUD induced by Peter Brandt, after weeks of range-bound motion, Martinez is optimistic that this growing network activity could set the stage for ETH to resume its upward trajectory in the near term.\n\nEthereum Retesting Breakout Zone\n\nPer the charts, new addresses entering the Ethereum network have soared to their highest level since October 16. The current level represents the second major spike recorded within the network since the uptick recorded on November 20.\n\nThis ongoing network activity coincides with the point ETH bulls are making an effort to revive the price of the coin.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum changes hands at $2,234.32, up 1.32% in the past 24 hours. While market capitalization has soared by an almost equal growth rate to $264,962,859,280, its trading volume has jumped by 13.68% to $10,707,140,446.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn another post on X, Martinez highlighted that Ethereum is currently retesting its breakout zone from an ascending triangle. Per his experience, he posited that ETH is hinting at preparation for a further climb.\n\n#Ethereum is currently retesting its breakout zone from an ascending triangle, hinting at preparation for a further climb. The price range between $2,150 and $1,900 could be the ideal zone for accumulation before #ETH sets its sights on a higher target of $3,500. pic.twitter.com/6lGZT0ZKgv \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) December 20, 2023\n\nThe top analyst highlighted the price range between $2,150 and $1,900 as the critical accumulation zone to watch out for. If the accumulation scenario plays out, ETH might be on its way to the ultimate target of $3,500.\n\nEthereum and Market Influence\n\nWhile the current Ethereum on-chain data shows the second-largest digital currency has all it takes to pull a dramatic bullish run, market sentiment might stall this current optimism.\n\nDespite the Ethereum spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) sentiment in the market, the ripple effect of Bitcoin\u2019s instability is impacting ETH\u2019s performance in no small measure. While the broader crypto ecosystem is currently in a recovery mode, traders tracking ETH for the longer term may keep an eye on market dynamics."

        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its decision on several Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) until May 2024.\n\nThis announcement came through regulatory filings made on Dec. 18. Among the delayed decisions are those concerning the Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF, the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF, the VanEck spot Ethereum ETF, and a spot Ethereum ETF proposed by Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest and 21Shares.\n\nUPDATE: SEC Going early with delay orders for @hashdex & @Grayscale #Ethereum ETF filings.

Meanwhile, Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Futures ETF is perceived as a strategic move to eventually convert its Ethereum Trust into a spot Ethereum ETF, a view that has gained significant attention within the industry.\n\nThe SEC has declared that it will initiate proceedings to gather more public input regarding the potential listing of these ETFs, a move that underscores the agency\u2019s commitment to thorough scrutiny and public engagement before making a final decision.\n\nYou might also like: SEC postpones decision on Grayscale\u2019s application for spot Ethereum ETF\n\nJames Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, indicated that these delays were anticipated, with final decisions from the regulator expected by late May.\n\nUpdate: There it is. Delay order for @ARKInvest and @21Shares on their spot #Ethereum ETF filing. Expected and was due by December 26th. Final date for these are in late May. https://t.co/Zs6Zsd4uKj pic.twitter.com/9u0nNiPD9O \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) December 18, 2023\n\nSeyffart\u2019s insights align with the broader market expectations, as the community has been closely following the SEC\u2019s stance on cryptocurrency-based ETFs.\n\nPreviously, the SEC has approved ether futures-based ETFs but has stopped short of greenlighting spot ether or mixed fund ETFs. Notably, in October, nine futures-based products received approval simultaneously, marking a significant development in the industry.\n\nThe ongoing debate and anticipation in the crypto sector extend beyond Ethereum ETFs. The market is closely observing the SEC\u2019s decisions regarding 13 spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs currently under review.\n\nBloomberg analysts Seyffart and Eric Balchunas suggest that a decision on these Bitcoin ETFs could come as early as Jan. 10, 2024.\n\nBoth analysts have estimated a 90% likelihood of the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. This high probability has injected optimism into the market, particularly regarding institutional access to Bitcoin.\n\nOver the last six months, Bitcoin has seen a price increase of over 44%, while Ether (ETH) has also experienced a notable rise of 16.8% in the same period, as per data by CoinMarketCap.\n\nInvestors and industry experts have expressed concerns that delays in approving Ethereum ETFs are hindering market development and limiting investors\u2019 access to diversified investment opportunities.\n\nHowever, the SEC maintains its stance on thorough evaluation to prevent fraudulent activities and protect investor interests.\n\nAs the crypto community awaits the SEC\u2019s final decisions, the agency encourages public participation in commenting on the proposed rule changes for Ethereum ETFs. This involvement is seen as a vital part of the regulatory process, shaping the future landscape of cryptocurrency investments in the US market.\n\nRead more: SEC postpones deadline for decision on Invesco Galaxy spot Ethereum ETF\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

I\u2019m going to just hold my SOL and chill.\u201d\n\nUsing Fibonacci retracement levels, the trader suggests Solana may retest $48.71 before a bounce.\n\nSolana is trading for $73.37 at time of writing, up 2.6% in the last 24 hours.\n\nNext up, the trader predicts that ETH rival Avalanche (AVAX) will undergo a correction and revisit levels below $30 following its recent massive rally.\n\n\u201cAVAX: things are looking kind of toppy in the short term. Still bullish on this in the longer term for 2024 but wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this cools to sub $30.\u201d\n\nLooking at the trader\u2019s chart, he appears to suggest that AVAX is about to lose key support around the $39 level.\n\nAVAX is trading for $39.88 at time of writing, up 1.3% in the last 24 hours.\n\nLastly, the trader believes that Dogecoin (DOGE) rival Bonk (BONK) is entering a distribution phase or a period where early investors take the time to unload their holdings to sell their coins at a relatively high price.\n\n\u201cBONK: not shorting this quite yet, wouldn\u2019t dismiss having some sort of scam pump on this one. That\u2019ll be the one to consider shorting, to be honest. I think that this is in its distribution phase for now though.

Recent revelations by Lane Rettig, a former lead developer, have shaken the foundation of this perception. He claimed that over two-thirds of Ethereum tokens were acquired during a controversial pre-mining. These statements raise questions about the transparency and integrity of the Ethereum blockchain, prompting deep inquiries.\n\nA Controversial Pre-mining Subject\n\nAccording to Rettig, about 70% of Ethereum tokens were pre-mined before the cryptocurrency was even accessible to the public.\n\nThis strategy is normally aimed at regulating the distribution of a new currency. However, in this case, it reached an extreme level. As a result, a limited circle of insiders now holds the majority of the tokens.\n\nThis practice raises questions about the fairness of the token distribution and the overall transparency of the process. For a technology touted for its decentralization and openness, these revelations could tarnish the reputation of Ethereum crypto and shake the confidence of investors and users.\n\nAnother concerning aspect revealed by Rettig is the concentration of wealth within Ethereum. A very small number of anonymous individuals hold a significant portion of the total supply of ETH. This situation creates an imbalance of power and goes against the ideal of decentralization of the blockchain.\n\nThese \u201cwhales\u201d of Ethereum, operating in the shadows, could have a disproportionate influence on the market, raising concerns about potential price manipulation and the overall health of the crypto ecosystem.\n\nImplications and Reactions from the Crypto Community\n\nThe revelation of these practices has ignited a heated debate in the crypto community. Ethereum supporters are forced to reconsider their stance, while critics feel vindicated in their doubts about the management of the blockchain.\n\nThese allegations, casting a shadow over Ethereum, forcefully remind us that in the crypto universe, transparency and fairness are not just ideals, but imperative necessities.\n\nFaced with these upheavals, the crypto market finds itself at a crossroads, swinging between skepticism and hope. Restoring trust becomes a major challenge. Will Ethereum manage to clear the clouds of doubt, or are the cracks in its foundations irreparable?\n\nThis controversial episode questions not only the integrity of Ethereum but also the fundamental principles of the crypto industry. As reactions and speculations abound, a crucial lesson emerges: not to blindly accept apparent truths, but to seek clarity behind statements and promises.\n\nEthereum, at a crossroads, must now demonstrate its ability to navigate this storm of indignation, in search of redemption that will redefine its place in the constantly evolving world of crypto. Meanwhile, Solana breaks records and challenges Ethereum.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

Data indicates that Solana's trading volume has reached $1.262 billion, marginally surpassing Ethereum's $1.167 billion. Arbitrum, BSC, and Avalanche follow behind.\n\nThis development marks yet another significant milestone for Solana since Ethereum has long been considered the dominant force in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.\n\nAnalyzing the top chains by trading volume\n\nThe landscape of DEX trading is fiercely competitive, with various blockchains vying for the top spot.\n\nSolana's recent surge to the forefront is attributed to several factors, including the total value locked (TVL) on its platform, which has topped $1 billion for the first time since the FTX collapse in November last year.\n\nThis resurgence has been driven by rising asset prices and consistent inflows to DeFi protocols.\n\nDecentralized exchanges on Solana, such as Orca, have seen remarkable increases in trading volume.\n\nSolana's market cap surpasses XRP\n\nFurther cementing its position in the cryptocurrency market, Solana's market capitalization has now outstripped that of XRP.\n\nAt the time of reporting, Solana's market cap stands at $35.42 billion. In contrast, XRP's market cap is slightly behind at $33.74 billion.\n\nSolana's recent performance can be partly attributed to the rise of meme coins like Bonk, a dog-themed token that now boasts a market cap of more than $1.2 billion. The speculative frenzy surrounding meme coins has played a significant role in the recent rally."

        "content": "Blast\u2019s growth in TVL is indicative of most institutional investors\u2019 bullish stance for Ethereum and the DeFi market.\n\nIn a breakthrough moment for Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution, Blast Network, a new record has been set, surpassing a Total Value Locked (TVL) of over $900 million. Data from DefiLlama, a leading authority in monitoring and analyzing Decentralized Finance (DeFi) trends, revealed Blast\u2019s contact address, launched by Blur founder Pacman, has about $928.35 million TVL.\n\nThis achievement marks a significant stride in the evolution of Layer 2 technologies, highlighting the growing importance and adoption of solutions that aim to enhance the scalability and efficiency of blockchain networks.\n\nTotal Value Locked is a key metric in the DeFi landscape, representing the total amount of assets committed to a particular platform. Blast\u2019s surge beyond the $900 million mark indicates the platform\u2019s popularity and the growing confidence and interest in decentralized financial services. Also, the surge signifies the increasing recognition of Layer 2 solutions as a viable means to alleviate congestion and high transaction fees on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain.\n\nUndoubtedly, Blast\u2019s growth of $900 million in TVL in such a record period is also indicative of most institutional investors\u2019 bullish stance for Ethereum and the DeFi market.\n\nBlast TVL: Catalysts Boosting This Surge\n\nNotably, the increase in Blast\u2019s TVL is attributed to multiple factors. First is the scalability advantage offered by the Layer 2 protocol which now allows users to experience faster and more cost-effective transactions compared to the main ETH chain. This enhanced efficiency has contributed to the influx of users and assets on the Blast network.\n\nAdditionally, the Blast network\u2019s commitment to security and interoperability has played a pivotal role in building trust within the blockchain community. It is worth noting that Blast has emerged as a leading player in the Layer 2 scaling arena with its TVL positions surpassing $900 million.\n\nLikewise, the surge showcases the increasing demand for solutions that can accommodate a higher volume of transactions without compromising on decentralization and security. Recall that at the beginning of the month, it was announced that Blast protocol has over $882 million in TVL and over 67,000 users, thus making the L2 one of the top ETH validators associated with the Lido DAO.\n\nBlast Oncourse for a Mainnet launch\n\nAfter raising about $20 million from about a dozen investors led by venture capital firm Paradigm, the L2 firm has reiterated to its community members that it\u2019s still on course for its mainnet launch scheduled for February 2024.\n\nTo achieve this, the firm intensified its search for a senior DevOps Engineer and senior protocol engineer earlier in the month. Interestingly, Blast network is EVM compatible making its integration with other protocols easy, creating more liquidity and accessibility for its users.\n\nThe recently launched L2 network offers early access members a 4 percent yield and a 5 percent yield on Ethereum and Stablecoins deposits respectively. Users can expect to make withdrawals from the network as early as May 24, next year when its mainnet would have possibly gone live."

        "title": "Ethereum Bearish Falling Wedge Pattern Appears, How Low Can Price Go? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum has followed the general trend of Bitcoin over the last few weeks and when the asset dipped from its 2023 peak, so did the price of ETH. Following this decline in price, a worrying pattern has appeared on the ETH chart known as a falling wedge pattern. This was brought to light by crypto analyst Alan Santana, who has painted a grim picture of what this could mean for Ethereum.\n\nEthereum Falling Wedge Pattern Is Bearish\n\nIn the analysis posted on the TradingView website, Alan Santana explains that the appearance of this falling wedge pattern does not bode well for the Ethereum price. Apparently, the ETH chart had formed a perfect rising wedge which eventually broke bearish. Given this, the crypto analyst explains that it shows that the Ethereum price is moving alongside the rest of the crypto market in a \u201cnormal but fast correction.\u201d\n\nThe crypto analyst also backs up their analysis with the Ethereum Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicator. In the chart shared by the analyst, there is a clear decline in the MACD on the daily chart, which lends credence to the bearish pressure mounting on ETH.\n\nFurthermore, using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart as well, there is also a clear decline. The RSI has apparently already lost its trend line support and is now moving below 50. The simple fact suggests a turn toward the bearish direction for the cryptocurrency.\n\nSantana explains that these indicators show that the bias toward a downward spiral is strong, especially since it has already seen a double-top pattern. \u201cVolume continues to drop, the calm before the storm. Slowly, slowly down\u2026 Nothing is happening, everything is good then Boom!\u201d the analyst warns.\n\nETH price above $2,200 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nPrice Targets For ETH\u2019s Bearish Formation\n\nFrom the chart posted in the analysis, the crypto analyst seems to expect at least a 20% drawdown for Ethereum following the double-top formation. Now, the chart puts the double top formation when the asset\u2019s price briefly touched the $2,400 level last week.\n\nAfter that, expectations have quickly gone in the opposite direction and as the formation plays out, the crypto analyst sees a decline to at least $1,800 from here. If further downside follows, then Santana expects that there will be more drawdowns that will end somewhere around $1,600.\n\nThe Ethereum price is still trending around $2,200 at the time of writing, suggesting the bear pressure is still mounting. If it breaks down from here, then Santana\u2019s prediction could prove right and ETH\u2019s price could fall back to mid-October levels.\n\nFeatured image from Crypto Briefing, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "As the 2021 bull run continues to heat up, new cryptos find themselves in the spotlight each day. There are a few, however, that haven't quite kept up. Litecoin reached an all time high of $420 in 2017, and has yet to make its way back. While many consider Litecoin to be a dead currency, supporters claim they hold it for transactional purposes, and latch on to its fundamental strength.\n\nEthereum is a decentralized global computing platform, and the most actively developed project in the blockchain space by a wide margin. Ethereum erased it's 2018 all time high ($1,420) by February of 2021, and hasn't looked back since. In fact, it now trades for nearly triple that. The outlook for Ethereum has never been higher as Vitalik and his team take on the most challenging problems the intersection of politics, finance, philosophy and computer science have to offer.\n\nWhat are the similarities and differences in the fundamentals of these projects, and why isn't Litecoin seeing the same gains as its old rival, Ethereum?\n\nClaim Now Get up to $200 in rewards with Coinbase!

However, Litecoin brings a few unique traits of its own. Among its distinguishing features is a finite supply of 84 million coins compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 21 million.\n\nThe cryptocurrency can also be mined up to four times faster than Bitcoin, which means that transactions settle faster because the process of mining involves verifying transactions and adding them to the cryptocurrency\u2019s ledger. Litecoin is often referred to as the cryptocurrency equivalent of silver (Bitcoin is gold). As such, Litecoin often targets smaller transactions.\n\nHowever, both Bitcoin and Litecoin can be subdivided up to eight decimal places. In today\u2019s transactions, the smallest units are not currently in wide use. If or when the value of these cryptocurrencies increases well beyond their current values, the smaller increments will become more useful. Litecoin uses SegWit (Segregated Witness), a technology that allows more transactions within a block, which speeds up the processing time for individual transactions. Slow transaction completion times have been one of the leading criticisms of Bitcoin compared to alternatives.\n\nLitecoin can't yet support smart contracts, which are computer programs that live on the cryptocurrency\u2019s blockchain and govern transactions or perform other functions. Active development for smart contracts is centered on Ethereum.\n\nEndurance\n\nSince Bitcoin was invented in 2009, many cryptocurrencies have come and gone but Litecoin\u2019s endurance may speak to its future longevity.\n\nGovernment regulation of currencies or bans are also a concern. The fact that Litecoin has survived this long (since October 2011) and that it is one of the few currencies that has been available on the highly-selective Coinbase exchange could indicate a better future than other altcoins.\n\nA potential risk of owning Litecoin is that one of its main selling features, SegWit, a method of shrinking transaction sizes, is being considered for Bitcoin as well, which would eliminate a significant advantage of Litecoin. However, SegWit has been a topic of spirited discussion within the Bitcoin community for years and may never be added to Bitcoin.\n\nLike many cryptocurrencies, Litecoin enjoyed a massive runup in price at the end of 2017 and into early 2018. Prices have fallen since that time but remain substantially higher than early 2017 levels.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum was the brainchild of Toronto programmer and Bitcoin enthusiast Vitalik Buterin. In 2013, he released a white paper about Ethereum, detailing the potential uses of an alternative blockchain technology that could work as both a financial instrument and decentralized platform for developers to build applications.\n\nMore developers joined ranks and Ethereum had momentum and a growing community of high-tech enthusiasts. By 2015, Ether was a live cryptocurrency powering the Ethereum blockchain. Since its beginnings just a few years ago, ETH has grown into the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nBitcoin was built as a cryptocurrency platform. Ethereum is a decentralized application platform \u2014 one that also hosts a cryptocurrency, a fuel for the network. The difference may seem like semantics, but the distinction is a large part of why Ethereum has had such wide adoption in such a short amount of time.\n\nEthereum\u2019s smart contracts are code that lives and executes on the blockchain and can facilitate monetary exchanges, or transfer content, property, shares, or other items of value based on a set of rules built into each contract. Many think that we\u2019ve only scratched the surface of what can be done with Ethereum as a platform, comparing the current uses and applications to the early days of the internet and dial-up modems.\n\nSimilarities Between LTC and ETH\n\nBoth Litecoin and Ethereum are traded on Coinbase . Coinbase works in a similar manner to a market maker on stock exchanges, purchasing from sellers and selling to buyers at prices that approximate the real-time trading price. GDAX is the exchange\u2019s platform for advanced traders. Both platforms offer Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum.\n\n. Coinbase works in a similar manner to a market maker on stock exchanges, purchasing from sellers and selling to buyers at prices that approximate the real-time trading price. GDAX is the exchange\u2019s platform for advanced traders. Both platforms offer Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. Litecoin and Ethereum provide fast transactions. Bitcoin is slow, although still faster than many traditional bank transfers. Both Litecoin and Ethereum enable faster transactions than Bitcoin, but they use different approaches to speed those transactions. Regardless of the technical details, a faster transaction time helps a currency to be viable.\n\nDifferences Between LTH and ETH\n\nLitecoin is primarily viewed as a currency \u2014 a transactional supplement to Bitcoin. Both were inspired by Bitcoin, with Litecoin as a fork of Bitcoin. (A fork is a divergence of existing open-source code to start a new project or related project.) However, Litecoin and Ethereum have taken very different directions in development. Litecoin is a faster and cheaper version of Bitcoin and Ethereum and attracts the attention of developers who see more applications for the platform.\n\nBoth were inspired by Bitcoin, with Litecoin as a fork of Bitcoin.

Litecoin is a faster and cheaper version of Bitcoin and Ethereum and attracts the attention of developers who see more applications for the platform. Ethereum is on a roll. Rising from white-paper obscurity, the ambitious dream of a young coder, to the world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency is an impressive feat and speaks to the enthusiasm the community has for Ethereum and its long-term applications. With the ability to host applications, store data, transfer value, and communicate \u2014 all on the blockchain \u2014 it\u2019s not surprising that Ethereum has captured the imagination of investors and developers alike.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile it is impossible to predict the future of the cryptocurrency bull run, it is apparent that Ethereum as a project and foundation has much stronger fundamentals and progress than Litecoin. While there are a few people who still hold Litecoin, LTC's failure to reclaim its 2017 price by the end of April is a clear indicator of a dying currency. However, that doesn't mean that there isn't still money to be made.\n\nEthereum is the clear winner of this battle, and a much safer investment relative to LTC. It is important to remember that we are still in the very early days of crypto, blockchain and smart contracts - so all investments should be categorized as speculative. Don't invest any money you can't afford to lose.\n\nWant to learn more?

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nLisk (LSK), a delegated proof of stake (DPOS) protocol, has unveiled its plans to migrate to Ethereum as a layer-2 scaling solution. According to the update shared on its official X account, Lisk said its layer-2 plot will be achieved in collaboration with Optimism (OP) and Gelato Network.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the protocol noted, the push to Ethereum is to advance its key value protocol to bring real world assets (RWA) to emerging markets. Additionally, a switch to Ethereum will optimize its plans to provide a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) on-chain.\n\nThe switch from a full-blown layer-1 to a layer-2 protocol is uncommon; however, the ease of implementing the move, as provided by Optimism, makes the transition easier. Lisk now says it is the first L1 blockchain that will join other protocols like Base to contribute to the Optimism Superchain. Recall that Base was designed by Coinbase using the OP technology Stack.\n\nToday, we are excited to announce that Lisk will integrate with the Ethereum ecosystem as a Layer 2 (L2) in collaboration with @Optimism & @gelatonetwork!\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f Focused on solving local problems in Emerging Markets by bringing solutions around real-world assets (RWA), off-chain\u2026 pic.twitter.com/a05p5ldwEm \u2014 Lisk (@LiskHQ) December 19, 2023\n\nBy committing its developers to the development of Optimism Superchain, Lisk said it will advance the vision of contributing to the future of Web3. It believes its contributions in the long term will contribute to driving mass adoption into the industry.\n\nLisk price reacts\n\nThe announcement of the transition to the Ethereum protocol as a layer-1 network has pushed Lisk (LSK) to a new daily high. At the time of writing, the digital currency has jumped by 6.23% to $1.13, taking its market capitalization to $145,573,784.\n\nThe move to Ethereum might be the ultimate game-changer that Lisk needs to gain mainstream recognition, like other protocols in the L2 arena. Despite its revolutionary offerings and age, the protocol is ranked as the 262nd largest protocol by market capitalization, and its transaction count pales in comparison to OP and ARB.\n\nThis contrasts with Optimism (OP), Arbitrum (ARB) and Polygon (MATIC), whose market cap ranking and total value locked (TVL) compete with many established layer-1 blockchains today."

        "content": "Having retested the $2,100 level, Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency globally, is poised for an upward movement. At the time of reporting, the Ethereum (ETH) price stands at $2,200, with a market capitalization of $264 billion.\n\nEthereum Exchange Outflows\n\nDespite the current ETH price volatility, the Ethereum supply at the exchanges has hit a new low. This is a positive indicator showing that more investors are willing to hold their ETH for the long term.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSantiment, an on-chain data provider, reports that with Ethereum\u2019s market value slightly above $2,170, major exchange wallets are actively transferring coins to smaller wallets or withdrawing them from exchanges altogether. In the past 24 hours, a total of 240,000 ETH has been shifted from these large wallets, representing a 2.99% decrease in the amount of coins held.\n\nRenowned crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe suggests that while altcoins are exhibiting strength, it might not be a definitive trend at this point. He notes that Ethereum (ETH) currently lacks momentum, but anticipates a shift in the coming weeks. Van de Poppe predicts a money flow from Bitcoin to Ethereum, leading to a strong performance by altcoins in the first quarter of 2024, potentially coinciding with a peak in Bitcoin dominance.\n\nETH Price Action\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s trading session, Ethereum made an early attempt at a rally, amidst the ongoing market noise. The $2100 level emerges as a crucial support, having played a significant role in the past. This level, once a resistance point in the broader market, witnessed repeated challenges from an ascending triangle. Short-term pullbacks are expected to find support around this area. Even in the event of a breakdown below $2100, the 50-Day EMA is anticipated to provide substantial support, warranting close attention to this zone.\n\nOn the optimistic side, traders are eyeing the $2500 level as a potential target, with a considerable push expected from market participants aiming to drive Ethereum in that direction. Beyond that, the $2700 level comes into focus. The prevailing trend indicates a scenario where traders consistently seize value during every dip, reflecting an active pursuit of value by the majority of crypto traders.\n\nHowever, a breakdown below the 50-Day EMA could have negative implications for Ethereum. Additionally, the market\u2019s sensitivity to changes in interest rates, particularly in the United States and other bond markets, is noted. Any resurgence in rates is likely to exert pressure on the market, potentially leading to a broader decline in the crypto markets, not limited to Ethereum."

Discover SCENE\n\nCrypto startup Immutable is a gaming-focused firm with a layer-2 Ethereum blockchain, Immutable X, as well as an upcoming zkEVM blockchain, which has launched its test network at time of writing.\n\nMany games have adopted Immutable's tech to provide faster and cheaper on-chain interactions than Ethereum's own mainnet, and several of those titles have started flooding into the Epic Games Store, a major mainstream PC gaming marketplace.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at all the games using one of Immutable\u2019s networks that have been listed on the Epic Games Store.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAvalon\n\nNot to be confused with the sci-fi blockchain metaverse game of the same name, the Avalon game using the Immutable zkEVM blockchain is a medieval, open-world MMORPG where you can create characters, craft items, complete quests, and explore a world with dragons, ships, and expansive leafy landscapes. In Avalon, everything from characters to mounts, buildings, and forges will exist as NFTs.\n\nAvalon is currently listed as coming out sometime in 2024 on the Epic Games Store for PC players.\n\nBlocklords\n\nBlocklords is a bird\u2019s-eye view medieval strategy and simulation MMO currently in early access on the Epic Games Store. Players must select their own plot of land, build and staff a village, fight off invaders, and direct workers to mine, harvest, and complete other tasks. In Blocklords, story-based \u201cchoose your own adventure\u201d moments will appear, where players must pick a response to various events\u2014and face a range of consequences.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlocklords currently uses the Immutable X and Polygon blockchains for its optional NFTs, according to its Epic Games Store page.\n\nDelysium\n\nDelysium is a sci-fi MMORPG in development that will use both blockchain and AI elements. The game is currently slated to launch sometime in 2025, according to its Epic Games Store page. Players will be able to vote on game changes with the ERC-20 governance token AGI and buy NFTs on Immutable\u2019s marketplace that can customize their characters and weapons.\n\nGods Unchained\n\nGods Unchained, the NFT trading card game from Immutable, was first released back in 2018. In the Hearthstone-like game, players can earn its GODS token and use NFT cards. In June 2023, Gods Unchained was added to the Epic Games Store, but was subsequently removed due to Epic\u2019s policies barring Adults Only-rated games from its platform. The game\u2019s developer, Immutable, did not confirm to Decrypt how long the game was missing from the store\u2014but Reddit users noted that the game had been missing from Epic\u2019s store since at least October.\n\nFollowing Decrypt\u2019s December investigation into the issue, Epic Games revised its policy on AO-rated games, allowing games that had been given AO ratings simply because of their crypto elements to return to its platform. Gods Unchained was previously listed as an honorable mention in this article, but has now been updated to reflect that it\u2019s been relisted on the Epic Games Store.\n\nIlluvium\n\nIlluvium is an open-world exploration and pet autobattler NFT game that\u2019s currently available in early access on the Epic Game Store. Illuvium\u2019s Epic listing effectively combines two Illuvium games: Overworld and Arena. The former is a third-person sci-fi open-world exploration game, and the latter is the pet autobattler title, where players use cards of Illuvials to fight the enemy\u2019s Iluvials on a small battle arena.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile the game is currently free-to-play and has optional NFTs, Illuvium is using the Immutable X blockchain for all its in-game NFTs, like Illuvials and cosmetic items.\n\nMetalcore\n\nMetalcore is a first-person sci-fi shooter and third-person mech operating game currently in early access on the Epic Games Store. The game will use the Immutable zkEVM blockchain to host its NFTs, which are vehicles, weapons, crafting elements, and other items.\n\nSpace Nation Online\n\nSpace Nation Online is an MMORPG in development with the apocalyptic sci-fi director Roland Emmerich attached, who is known for his work on films like \u201cIndependence Day\u201d and \u201cThe Day After Tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe world of Space Nation will have one to two different star systems to explore at launch, offering characters from 3-5 different races including \u201cTerrans,\u201d according to the game\u2019s Epic store page. Currently, its Epic listing does not indicate that it is a blockchain game, but there will be a blockchain version of Space Nation that will offer NFTs on the Immutable zkEVM network.\n\nThe Bornless\n\nLike Space Nation, The Bornless is an NFT-optional game that is not currently listed as a blockchain game on the Epic store. The Bornless is an upcoming first-person horror shooter game with current plans to launch on the Epic Games Store sometime in 2024.\n\nIn the game, players will be able to choose from different superpower-like abilities and then hop into a range of shooter game modes like multiplayer deathmatches or duo co-op matches.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven more games\n\nBut that\u2019s not all\u2014there are a bunch of other games listed on the Epic store that use Immutable for their crypto elements. The fantasy MMORPG Age of Zalmoxis, card game The Lost Glitches, plane crash game Aviatrix, the monster battler Chain Monsters, and the shooter game Citizen Conflict have also all been added to Epic\u2019s store.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published on December 3 and last updated with new information on December 20."

        "title": "Peter Brandt Sees Ethereum Dropping to $650 in New Troubling Projection - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "Legendary market trader Peter Brandt has issued a very gloomy price target for Ethereum (ETH) as he sees the coin dropping to a low of $650.\n\nThe projection from Peter Brandt aligns with his known pessimism for Ethereum despite the digital currency currently ranked as the second-largest in the industry after Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum was trading at $2,236.02, up by 4.37% in the past 24 hours, with a market capitalization of $268,605,808,266. With Peter Brandt\u2019s projection that Ethereum could fall to $1000 and, in the worst-case scenario, to $650, the coin will have to drop by 244% from its current price.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe legendary trader justified his assertion for this bearish call.\n\nPeter Brandt Shorted Ethereum\n\nPeter Brandt proclaimed that he \u201cshorted ETH\u201d on Friday to showcase confidence in his forecast. He believes that classical chart patterns tracking price action are not infallible as they always fail to perform by the books.\n\nThat being said, Brandt, pointing to the chart in his post, said if the rising wedge in Ethereum aligns with the script, then there are chances the coin will fall to the level he forecasted.\n\nClassical chart patterns in price charts are not sacred \u2013 they fail to perform according to the textbooks all the time But, if the rising wedge in Ethereum $ETH complies with the script, the target is $1,000, then $650 I shorted ETH on Friday \u2014 I have a protective B/E stop pic.twitter.com/76CciT3PE5 \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 18, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe presented chart shows a triangle with a wedge hypotenuse formed from around May 2022 to date. Ethereum has displayed two distinct high and low points within this period at $1,086.38 and $2,401.76 respectively. Interestingly, this low point has not been recorded in the past year, and the likelihood of a solo catastrophic fall below $1,000 is low considering the current sentiment in the market today.\n\nEthereum has thus far maintained a bullish outlook this year after printing an average growth rate of 87.01% in the Year-to-Date (YTD) period. However, as a prominent critic of Ethereum, Peter Brandt has refused to see this good side.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Utility Questioned\n\nAs part of his recent comment about Ethereum, Peter Brandt once questioned the protocol\u2019s utility and its longer-term prospects.\n\nAs reported earlier by The Crypto Basic, the legendary trader believes Ethereum may not be a listed asset in 10 years because it is not a comparable store of value like Bitcoin. Additionally, he noted that the high gas fee on Ethereum is further a significant drawback in its bid to maintain its attractiveness."

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nEthereum (ETH), the premier smart contract network, boasts over $28 billion in decentralized financial (DeFi) ecosystems. Recently, there has been a noticeable surge in open interest, coinciding with the ongoing altcoin renaissance. The network, valued at $265 billion, benefits from institutions and retail traders\u2019 widespread adoption of web3 products. As a result, Ether\u2019s price has followed an upward trajectory over the past 12 months despite significant regulatory scrutiny in the United States and other jurisdictions.\n\nEthereum is a globally recognized digital asset characterized by deep liquidity and a high daily trading volume. As the largest altcoin, it has increasingly distanced itself from the volatile speculation associated with smaller-cap altcoins. Furthermore, Ethereum plays a crucial role in providing liquidity to most DeFi-based tokens, imparting much-needed stability to the industry.\n\n#Ethereum is currently retesting its breakout zone from an ascending triangle, hinting at preparation for a further climb.\n\n\n\nThe price range between $2,150 and $1,900 could be the ideal zone for accumulation before #ETH sets its sights on a higher target of $3,500. pic.twitter.com/6lGZT0ZKgv \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) December 20, 2023\n\nAccording to market intelligence from Santiment, the total supply of Ether currently on exchanges is about 8.07 percent of the circulating supply, marking the lowest level since the network\u2019s inception.\n\nAt the time of this report, approximately 28.4 million Ether have been staked to bolster the Ethereum ecosystem. In addition, roughly 3.8 million Ether have been burned, contributing to the network\u2019s transition to a deflationary asset.\n\nPer the analysis of a renowned crypto analyst, Ali Charts, Ethereum\u2019s price is on the brink of a significant upswing, potentially reaching $3,500 in the upcoming months. This projection is based on the observation that Ether\u2019s weekly price is nearing the completion of a retest of the macro ascending triangle breakout."

        "content": "Solana has seen a 400% growth in user activity in Q4.\n\nIts DeFi and NFT sectors have also seen considerable growth in the past few months.\n\nDaily user activity on Solana [SOL] has seen a notable rise of almost 400% as the last quarter of the year nears its end. This dwarfed the meager 3% increase seen on Ethereum [ETH], on-chain data provider Messari noted in a new report.\n\nAccording to the research firm, the recent surge in new demand for Solana is due to the series of token airdrops completed by some protocols housed within the Layer 1 (L1) blockchain network.\n\nFor example, on the 20th of November, the Solana-based oracle network Pyth (PYTH) completed the airdrop of 250 million PYTH tokens worth around $77 million to its early users.\n\nAlso, on the 7th of December, Jito airdropped some of its native tokens worth $225 Million to some of its users on the Solana network.\n\nJupiter, a swap aggregator and one of the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols on Solana, recently announced that its highly anticipated airdrop of 4 billion JUP tokens will take place in January.\n\nApart from the series of airdrops by projects on the chain, the meteoric rise in BONK\u2019s value has contributed to the upswing in Solana\u2019s network activity.\n\nSolana\u2019s DeFi and NFT ecosystems see growth\n\nExchanging hands at $0.0000209 at press time, the dog-themed token has rallied by 544.4% in the last month, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nThe airdrops have culminated in a 30% growth in SOL\u2019s value in the last month. According to Messari:\n\n\u201cCombined with the recent airdrops and positive price appreciation, these factors have helped make Solana firmly the second-largest chain by DEX volumes, closely rivaling Ethereum for the top spot.\u201d\n\nIn the last month, there has been a significant increase in activity across the DEXes on Solana. AMBCrypto found that the total volume of transactions completed through Solana-based DEXes has grown by 255% in the last 30 days.\n\nAs of the 18th of December, this totaled $871 million, data from Artemis showed.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 SOLs worth today?\n\nAccording to Messari:\n\n\u201cNearly 60% of Solana\u2019s DEX volume is driven through DEX aggregator Jupiter, which has eclipsed Uniswap V3 on Ethereum. Jupiter\u2019s trades are routed to underlying DEXs that settle the order, the largest of which has been Orca. Orca is now the second largest DEX in all of crypto, behind Uniswap V3 on Ethereum.\u201d\n\nFurther, Solana\u2019s non-fungible token (NFT) vertical has also seen an impressive performance in the past few months. As highlighted in the report, sales volume on the chain has increased by almost 500% in the last 90 days."

        "content": "Value of Stablecoins on Ethereum Sees 34% Decline, Tron Records 57.7% Growth since 2022\n\nThe value of stablecoins on Ethereum (ETH) has experienced a decline of 34% since 2022, while stablecoins on TRON (TRX) have seen a significant growth rate of 57.7% during the same period.\n\nAccording to a recent report from Sixdegree Lab, the supply of stablecoins on Ethereum has been steadily decreasing, dropping from its peak of $100 billion to $66 billion, marking a 34% decline.\n\nIn contrast, stablecoin supply on Tron has followed an upward trajectory, growing from $31 billion in 2022 to $48.9 billion. This impressive increase of 57.7% aligns with the overall market price trend.\n\nDespite the recent bull market, the overall value of stablecoins has not seen a significant increase.\n\nCurrently, the total market value of stablecoins stands at $129.5 billion, which represents a decline of 31% compared to its peak value of $188 billion.\n\nAmong the stablecoins, Tether ( USDT) holds the largest market share at 56.3%, followed by USD Coin ( USDC) at 30.5%, and DAI at 5.07%.\n\nThese three stablecoins have a combined value of $40.03 billion, $21.7 billion, and $3.6 billion, respectively.\n\nMajor Stablecoin Holders\n\n\n\nExternally owned accounts (EOAs) hold approximately 50% of stablecoins, while centralized exchanges (CEXes) account for around 30%.\n\nDeFi protocols, on the other hand, only hold approximately 5.5% of stablecoins, a significant decrease from its peak of around 25% in January 2022.\n\nThe decrease in stablecoin supply within DeFi protocols on Ethereum may be attributed to the emergence of Ethereum Layer2 solutions.\n\nThese Layer2 solutions have provided a more favorable environment for the development of DeFi and innovative protocols.\n\nAddressing the holders of stablecoins on Ethereum, the majority (94.2%) hold less than $1,000 worth of stablecoins, contributing only 9.28% to the overall stablecoin holdings.\n\nIn contrast, addresses holding over 100,000 stablecoins represent around 0.562% of addresses but contribute a substantial 87.6% to the total stablecoin holdings.\n\nInterestingly, approximately 60% of the stablecoins held by these top addresses remain dormant.\n\nThese addresses are either considered reserve addresses, with a stablecoin expenditure to income ratio below 0.2, or inactive addresses that have not engaged in any stablecoin transactions within the past 180 days.\n\nStablecoins See Positive Supply Growth\n\n\n\nBack in November, the 90-day net change in the supply of the top four stablecoins, USDT, USDC, Binance USD (BUSD), and Dai (DAI), turned noticeably positive, marking the first such instance since the collapse of Terra in mid-May 2022.\n\nStablecoins have been widely used to fund cryptocurrency purchases since 2020.\n\nAn increase in their supply is seen as a potential buying pressure or a reserve of funds that investors can deploy to purchase cryptocurrencies or use as a margin in derivatives trading.\n\nStablecoins remain key to the day-to-day operations of the cryptocurrency industry, acting as a bridge between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cStablecoins have become the foundation of the cryptocurrency market,\u201d William Quigley, one of the co-founders of Tether, told Cryptonews.\n\n\u201cStablecoins are the core ingredient in virtually all DeFi applications. Without stablecoins, overall trading volume and liquidity in the crypto market would likely drop 75%.\u201d"

If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nWe\u2019re entering an exciting new chapter in the world of cryptocurrency, as some analysts at JP Morgan have intriguing predictions for 2024. They\u2019re expecting a bit of a shake-up in the crypto ranks. Ethereum is tipped to take the spotlight from Bitcoin, the long-time king of crypto. And keep an eye on some new ICOs like InQubeta (QUBE) and old horses like Avalanche (AVAX) \u2013 they\u2019re expected to make some significant moves too!\n\nInQubeta (QUBE): A Leap into AI Investment with Crypto\n\nIn the world of crypto, where innovation is the key, InQubeta stands out not just for its technological advancement but for its human-centric approach. It represents more than just a platform; it embodies the bridge between AI\u2019s untapped potential and the common investor. The platform\u2019s unique proposition of fractional investment in AI startups using QUBE tokens marks a departure from the elite circles of Silicon Valley, bringing AI investment opportunities to the doorstep of everyday investors.\n\nPicture this: You are not just investing in a startup; you\u2019re becoming a part of its journey, its challenges, and its successes. That\u2019s the story InQubeta offers through its popular NFT-based investment model. Each NFT is a story in itself, narrating the growth and innovation of an AI startup and offering you a piece of that future.\n\nAt the heart of InQubeta is the QUBE token, a testament to the project\u2019s vision of long-term value and community-driven governance. Its deflationary nature and rewarding tokenomics make it the best altcoin for investors. But more importantly, it empowers holders with a voice in shaping the AI future, making each investor a protagonist in the story of AI evolution.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Anticipated Supremacy in 2024\n\nMoving to the broader crypto landscape, Ethereum is poised to take a leading role, according to JP Morgan analysts. The expected technological upgrades, particularly EIP-4844, are set to enhance Ethereum\u2019s efficiency by reducing gas fees and boosting throughput. This improvement is not just a technical upgrade; it\u2019s a milestone in Ethereum\u2019s journey towards a more sustainable and user-friendly blockchain ecosystem.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX): The Rising Star in Smart Contract Platforms\n\nAvalanche, a formidable contender in the smart contract space, is gaining traction with its Ethereum compatibility and innovative multi-chain structure. Its ability to support a wide range of dApps, NFTs, and blockchain gaming positions it as a versatile and promising platform. The AVAX token, central to the Avalanche ecosystem, is not merely a good crypto to buy; it\u2019s a key to a secure and thriving network, rewarding validators and securing its future.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we look ahead to 2024, the crypto market is set to witness a paradigm shift. Ethereum\u2019s ascendancy, Avalanche\u2019s steady climb, and InQubeta\u2019s breakthrough in AI investment mark the beginning of a new chapter in the crypto narrative. Each of these players brings something unique to the table, reshaping the market dynamics and opening new horizons for investors. InQubeta, with its unique blend of technology and human touch, is not just another cryptocurrency ICO; it\u2019s a harbinger of a future where AI and crypto converge, creating a realm of limitless possibilities. As these players gear up for their respective journeys, the crypto world awaits with bated breath, ready to embrace the new champions of the digital age.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nYou get an airdrop! You get an airdrop!\n\nAmid hopes and prayers for the crypto bull market\u2019s imminent return, the onslaught of \u201cfree money\u201d airdrops for crypto users continues. The latest comes courtesy of Frame, an Ethereum scaling network designed for NFTs.\n\nThe project announced Tuesday that it will soon launch a native FRAME token, and that any crypto user who has transacted an NFT on Ethereum in the last two years is now eligible to collect varying amounts of FRAME. Criteria used to determine a user\u2019s airdrop size is determined based on the number of NFT trades made, the financial volume of those trades, and the amount of creator royalties paid during those transactions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile NFT traders can already claim FRAME via an online portal, those tokens won\u2019t functionally exist until January 31, when they will go live alongside the Frame mainnet.\n\n$FRAME, for the immediate future, will be used for governance on the network. This is especially important when you consider the value that the Frame Creator Fund will come to hold. The token will be transfer-locked until a later chapter. pic.twitter.com/4nZggIKqg3 \u2014 Frame (@frame_xyz) December 19, 2023\n\nFRAME tokens will initially be used exclusively for governance of the Frame ecosystem, the project announced, and to control the Frame Creator Fund. At a later, as-yet-unannounced date, the tokens will be unlocked for transfer and presumably become tradable on secondary markets for monetary value.\n\nUsers already began claiming their free FRAME Tuesday. Some reported receiving thousands of tokens, based on their NFT trading activity.\n\nI survived the bear market and claimed my $FRAME tokens!@frame_xyz is the Layer 2 for creators and collectors. If you've traded NFTs on Ethereum and paid royalties in the past two years you're eligible! \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\ud83c\udf84 You can check here \ud83d\udc47 https://t.co/95XO3A357v pic.twitter.com/lISxo38lmn \u2014 Pranksy \ud83d\udce6 (@pranksy) December 19, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToday\u2019s airdrop is only the first of many FRAME giveaways, the project said. Once the project fully launches at the end of next month, it will begin distributing more tokens to users and community members to encourage activity.\n\nFrame seeks to create an ecosystem for the buying, selling, and creation of NFTs that unambiguously puts creators first. The layer-2 rollup is based on Arbitrum Nova, an Ethereum scaling network.\n\nSince last year, the practice of enforcing creator royalties\u2014fees generally between 2.5% and 10% levied on NFT buyers, meant to support artists and enshrine blockchain\u2019s democratized ethos\u2014has been steadily dismantled under the weight of brutal market forces.\n\nFrame enforces creator fees at the network level; it says it also prioritizes NFT security more than other blockchains, and will eventually be run by community members.\n\nIn tandem with its airdrop announcement, Frame also announced that it has secured an initial fundraise led by Electric Capital, with participation from several crypto industry founders and influencers, including Pudgy Penguins CEO Luca Netz. A Frame advisor told Decrypt that the project isn\u2019t yet disclosing the funding amount or total amount of FRAME tokens.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

At press time, only 8% of the coin\u2019s total circulating supply sits on exchanges.\n\nThis implies that only 9,615,238 ETH are held across all exchanges out of the coin\u2019s circulating supply of 120,190,475 ETH.\n\nThe whales are up to something\n\nThe decline in ETH\u2019s exchange reserve comes on the heels of a significant coin outflow from whale wallets observed within the past 24 hours.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter), Santiment noted that between 18th and 19th December, ETH\u2019s top 10 largest wallets transferred a total of 240,000 ETH from their wallets, causing a 2.99% decrease in the overall amount of coins held in these wallets.\n\n\ud83d\udc4d As #Ethereum's market value hangs just above $2,170, the largest exchange wallets continue to move coins into smaller wallets or off exchanges entirely. 240K $ETH has been collectively moved from these wallets in 24 hours, a 2.99% drop in coins held. https://t.co/Fw7lKcVZan pic.twitter.com/AMFPDL4BXp \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 19, 2023\n\nThe data provider claimed these transfers were either made to smaller wallets or personal wallets.\n\nThe motives behind this whale movement remain unclear but could range from a shift towards long-term investment strategies to concerns about exchange security or broader market uncertainties.\n\nInterestingly, amid the decline in market liquidity witnessed on 19th December, there was a notable rise in new demand for ETH.\n\nData from Santiment showed that the day saw the creation of 100,000 new ETH addresses, marking a 23% uptick from the previous day\u2019s 81,000.\n\nIt also marked a single-day high in new wallet creation; the highest since 10th June.\n\nThis uptick coincided with the coin\u2019s brief decline to $2,140 on that day. Therefore, it could be new entrants trying to \u201cbuy the dip\u201d in anticipation of a price rally.\n\nYet, as indicated by the coin\u2019s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicator, signaling the onset of a bear cycle, ETH accumulation has slowed since 11th December.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nIts key momentum indicators have since trended downward.

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has deferred its decision on the approval of two Ethereum-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The SEC noted the initiation of proceedings for ETF approval in a statement on Monday. The initiation of proceedings does not imply that the Commission has reached any definitive conclusions regarding the matter.\n\nThe statement notes, \u201cInstitution of proceedings is appropriate at this time in view of the legal and policy issues raised by the proposed rule change,\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nETF approval delays continue\n\nThis follows a recent delay on the Invesco Galaxy spot Ethereum ETF application to next year instead of December 23. In November, the SEC extended its verdict on the Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum and Hashdex Bitcoin futures ETF applications. Additionally, the November deadlines for Franklin Templeton and Global X spot Bitcoin ETFs were also moved to next year.\n\nHashdex and Grayscale are now both placed among several firms whose applications have been either postponed or rejected.\n\nThe delay comes despite the original decision deadline not being due until January 1, 2024. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart suggests this early announcement could be an attempt by the SEC to clear the application queue. Based on past trends, the SEC website estimates that the EDGAR system experienced some of the highest submissions in December. EDGAR is the digital system used for submitting regulatory filings. Some of the upcoming peak filing dates will occur between December 27 and December 29, during the holiday season.\n\nSeyffart highlighted the SEC\u2019s decision to open a comment period to assess whether Ethereum ETFs should be treated differently from spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nUPDATE: SEC Going early with delay orders for @hashdex & @Grayscale #Ethereum ETF filings. Neither were due until Jan 1, 2024. Maybe just clearing the queue before the holidays? pic.twitter.com/LdZQxGh43L \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) December 18, 2023\n\nThe statement noted, \u201cThe Commission asks that commenters address the sufficiency of the Exchange\u2019s statements in support of the proposal, which are set forth in the Notice, in addition to any other comments they may wish to submit about the proposed rule change.\u201d\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin ETF\n\nThe comparison of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs could provide insights into the SEC\u2019s regulatory approach to different crypto ETFs. Meanwhile, the SEC has called for public comments up until December 22, with a deadline for rebuttal comments set for January 5.\n\nHeading into January 2024, US regulators are expected to reach a conclusive verdict on sanctioning a physically-backed Bitcoin ETF. With the deadlines approaching for the spot ETFs, the crypto sector remains hopeful after the recent acknowledgment from SEC chairman Gary Gensler that the agency is reviewing the filings."

        "title": "Peter Brandt Calls Ethereum A \u201cPiece Of Junk,\u201d Shorts It To $650 - Blockzeit",
        "content": "Veteran commodity and forex trader Peter Brandt recently revealed a super bearish outlook on Ethereum (ETH). To drive a point, he even shorted the hell out of the cryptocurrency he referred to as a \u201cpiece of junk\u201d to $650.\n\nPreviously, Reaper Financial Founder and CEO Patrick Riley tore through Ethereum, telling people that it\u2019s a \u201cdying horse that\u2019s been limping along for a long time.\u201d He believes XRP will stand to benefit from its eventual downfall.\n\nPeter Brandt happened to echo the sentiment in a short post to his 707.7K followers on the X platform. The veteran investor started the scathing remark by telling people that ETH is not comparable to Bitcoin (BTC) as a store of value. Then, he said the functionality and gas price of Ethereum makes it \u201ca piece of junk.\u201d\n\nAdding insult to injury, Brandt capped off his statement with his prediction that ETH will no longer be a listed asset after a decade.\n\nEther $ETH is not comparable to $BTC as a store of value. Why hodl ETH when you can hodl BTC\n\nAnd the functionality and gas price of ETH make the crypto a piece of junk\n\nMy prediction is that ETH may not even be a listed asset in 10 years https://t.co/4WQ7wnFWEO \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 14, 2023\n\nLast Friday, the investor went on to short ETH looking at the targets of $1,000 to $650.\n\nClassical chart patterns in price charts are not sacred \u2013 they fail to perform according to the textbooks all the time\n\n\n\nBut, if the rising wedge in Ethereum $ETH complies with the script, the target is $1,000, then $650\n\n\n\nI shorted ETH on Friday \u2014 I have a protective B/E stop pic.twitter.com/76CciT3PE5 \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 18, 2023\n\nEthereum Today\n\nIn light of these negative comments, Ethereum is moving in tandem with Bitcoin on the upside as of 5:30 AM UTC. It gained 3.5% in the 24-hour frame to $2,242 while trading volume soared to 29.42% as $10.45 billion worth of ETH moved in crypto exchanges. During this period, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap pivoted between a low of $2,120 and $2,249.\n\nEthereum is 0.78% up in the weekly charts but has shown double-digit gains in the monthly and annual charts at 14.33% and 89.88%, respectively. It\u2019s still 54% down from its all-time high at 4,891 in November 2021 but optimism runs that it might narrow the gap next year.\n\nStrengths of Ethereum\n\nThe primary strength of the Ethereum blockchain lies in the solid support of the crypto community to its ecosystem. The platform is preferred by developers because of its flexibility in smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nThe continuous push to improve its economy is also another selling point of Ethereum. A notable development was its shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to the less energy-intensive proof-of-stake (PoS) in 2022. Its co-founder Vitalik Buterin is currently working on a redesign for the network to enhance its performance and staking features, too.\n\nLastly, due to its strong correlation with Bitcoin, Ethereum is expected to rally with it by next year upon the fulfillment of two major events that are expected to launch BTC prices to the roof, namely the approval of pending spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETF) in the US and the halving."
