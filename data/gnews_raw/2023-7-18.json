        "title": "Will Ethereum Be a Trillion-Dollar Cryptocurrency by 2025? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Currently trading at just under $2,000, Ethereum (ETH 0.42%) has a market capitalization of $227 billion, making it the world's second-largest cryptocurrency. Ethereum now accounts for about 20% of the entire value of the $1.2 trillion crypto market.\n\nSo what would it take for Ethereum to more than quadruple in value to become a trillion-dollar cryptocurrency? For one, it would require Ethereum to continue to find innovative use cases for its blockchain technology. Second, it would most likely require Ethereum to surpass Bitcoin (BTC 0.56%) as the world's most popular cryptocurrency. Let's take a closer look at both of these factors.\n\nPost-Merge roadmap\n\nThe good news is that Ethereum's co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has plenty of upgrades, changes, and tweaks planned for the cryptocurrency. At the end of November 2022, he released an updated roadmap for Ethereum, and it's impressive. According to Buterin, Ethereum's transformation is still only 55% complete, even after last year's landmark upgrade known as The Merge. There are five big upgrade stages ahead, known as the Surge, Scourge, Verge, Purge, and Splurge.\n\nThe big question, of course, is what types of innovative use cases will emerge from each of these upgrades. In April, we saw the completion of one such upgrade, known as Shapella, which made crypto staking on the platform much more attractive to investors. The next big upgrade, now scheduled for the end of 2023, could lead to Ethereum being able to support 100,000 transactions per second in the near-term future. That type of raw processing speed would make Ethereum much more attractive to both users and developers.\n\nEthereum has a strong track record of innovation, and each new improvement to the blockchain typically leads to a completely unexpected new use case scenario. Thus, if there are five upgrades ahead, that's five new opportunities for new breakthrough innovations. Ethereum's post-Merge roadmap might be incredibly wonky, filled with terms like \"proto-danksharding,\" but I think it could be the key to unlocking this crypto's full valuation potential.\n\nCan Ethereum flip Bitcoin?\n\nIn crypto circles, one hypothetical scenario is known as \"the flippening.\" This is the moment when Ethereum finally surpasses Bitcoin as the world's most valuable cryptocurrency. Throughout its history, Ethereum has always played second fiddle to Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization. At some point, though, Ethereum could eventually \"flip\" Bitcoin.\n\nMost likely, Ethereum will need to surpass Bitcoin for it to become a trillion-dollar cryptocurrency. Until it happens, the math simply doesn't work. Investors can't assume that the entire crypto market is going to increase in value at the same rate as Ethereum. The math only works if Ethereum gains market share from other cryptos such as Bitcoin.\n\nThere are several factors in Ethereum's favor here. A big one is Ethereum's smart contract platform, which gives it much greater utility than Bitcoin. With Ethereum, the number of use cases includes non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, the metaverse, and Web3. And just about every new technological innovation -- such as artificial intelligence -- is better suited to running on Ethereum than Bitcoin. Thus, in the near-term future, it is likely that Ethereum will grow faster than Bitcoin.\n\nMoreover, thanks to The Merge, Ethereum is now a modern proof-of-stake blockchain, while Bitcoin is still an old proof-of-work blockchain. That means Ethereum no longer requires crypto mining, and that makes the blockchain 99.9% more energy efficient. Given the debate on the environment and climate change, this is a big deal. For example, in September 2022, the White House released a detailed study on the harmful environmental effects of Bitcoin mining. As people become more aware of the environmental effects of different cryptos, it might lead to more investors moving their money out of Bitcoin and into Ethereum.\n\nThe path to $1 trillion\n\nWhile Ethereum definitely has a path to a $1 trillion market cap, the road will not be easy. Consider, for example, that only a handful of stocks currently have trillion-dollar market valuations. Getting to this valuation for Ethereum would represent a real milestone, and one that will likely require overcoming a number of regulatory obstacles along the way.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, I'm bullish on Ethereum's medium- to long-term prospects. Within the next few years, it is entirely within the realm of possibility that Ethereum will become a trillion-dollar cryptocurrency as long as it continues to execute on its roadmap for growth."

The public crowdsale, also known as the Genesis event, took place between July 22, 2014, and September 2, 2014 and was conducted by the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organization responsible for developing and promoting the Ethereum platform.\n\nDuring the ICO, the Ethereum Foundation issued a total of 60 million Ether (ETH) tokens to early investors and supporters in exchange for their contributions in Bitcoin, raising $18.3 million. These contributions were used to fund the development of the Ethereum blockchain and its native cryptocurrency, Ether.\n\nThe success of Ethereum's ICO paved the way for many other blockchain projects to raise capital through token sales, leading to the proliferation of ICOs in the following years. However, the ICO boom also brought about regulatory challenges and concerns about scams and fraudulent projects, prompting regulatory authorities to take a closer look at the cryptocurrency fundraising model.\n\nAs for the transaction in question, data from Etherscan also shows that it incurred a remarkably low transaction fee of 0.00168 ETH, or $3.21.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNotably, the sender took a precautionary step by conducting a test transaction of 0.05 ETH to the Kraken address. This test transaction likely served as a way to verify the accuracy of the recipient address and ensure that the transfer process would be successful without any mistakes or errors that could lead to the loss of funds.\n\nThe wallet owner\u2019s identity, as well as their reason for moving the funds, remain unknown, but the latter could be due to a number of factors\u2014such as a shift in investment strategy or simply grabbing an opportunity to cash in on Ethereum\u2019s price increase.\n\nThis is not the first time this year when whales\u2014as the holders of large amounts of cryptocurrencies are otherwise known\u2014have moved funds that were sitting dormant for years.\n\nIn February, a Satoshi-era Bitcoin address that was inactive since 2012 moved 412 BTC worth $9.6 million. Another notable transaction occurred in May, when 139 BTC obtained back in 2011 and worth $3.75 million were sent to a newly-created address.\n\nAlso in May, an Ethereum whale identified as a participant in Ethereum\u2019s ICO that had lain dormant for more than two years, decided to stake as much as 4,032 ETH, or approximately $7.4 million."

        "title": "Ethereum Developers Are Discussing The Plan For The Dencun Upgrade - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "Not that long ago, the Ethereum blockchain underwent the Shanghai and Capella upgrades; the former impacted ETH\u2019s execution layer, while the latter targeted the Consensus Layer. The network upgrades seem to have pushed Ethereum\u2019s price higher, attracting a lot of investors (and speculators) in the cryptocurrency market. If you haven\u2019t considered this asset class in the past, it\u2019s high time you take ETH seriously. As you learn more about how to buy Ethereum, you\u2019ll find that it\u2019s better to purchase tokens on an exchange; it\u2019s your responsibility to pay the gas fees.\n\nEthereum\u2019s developers have proven they\u2019re committed to steadily improving the network. The much-awaited Shapella Upgrade is live, and ETH has many more upgrades in the pipeline to enhance scalability, security, and sustainability. Surprising or not, developers are preparing for the upcoming upgrade on the Ethereum Mainnet, the Dencun upgrade, that will reduce transaction fees, expected in late 2023. If all goes as hoped, it will enable new use cases. According to Tim Beiko, Protocol Support for the Ethereum Foundation, the developers are in the final stages of planning for Dencun, having a provisional set of EIPs.\n\nWhat\u2019s New in The Recent Ethereum Upgrade?\n\nThe Dencun upgrade combines two upgrades, namely Deneb (the Execution Layer upgrade) and Cancun (the Consensus Layer upgrade). Some of the main improvement proposals considered for inclusion are:\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nEIP-4844 . Also referred to as Proto-Danksharding, EIP-4844 introduces temporary \u201cdata blobs\u201d to the Beacon Chain for a short period of time. The format will be fully compatible with that used in full sharding. This proposal will lower the gas cost of Layer 2 transactions considerably. The new transaction format, i.e., the blob, is contained within the Prismatic Client, but not the execution environment.\n\n.

The new transaction format, i.e., the blob, is contained within the Prismatic Client, but not the execution environment. EIP-6780 . It deactivates the SELF DESTRUCT opcode, which allows for creating and erasing contracts within a single transaction. The issue of not knowing what storage to delete doesn\u2019t occur. The operation sends all the ETH in an account to the caller, excluding when SELF DESTRUCT is called within the same transaction a contract was created.\n\n.

The operation sends all the ETH in an account to the caller, excluding when SELF DESTRUCT is called within the same transaction a contract was created. EIP-1153 . This proposal brings about two new opcodes, namely TSTORE and TLOAD, which enable storage to be used provisionally. Transient storage is more affordable since it doesn\u2019t require disk access and allows better smart contract designs. Use cases include single-transaction ERC-20 approvals and re-entry locks.\n\n.

Transient storage is more affordable since it doesn\u2019t require disk access and allows better smart contract designs. Use cases include single-transaction ERC-20 approvals and re-entry locks. EIP-6475. Simple Serialize types are introduced to represent Optional [T] values. SSZ structures with optional values can be represented with the idiomatic types of the underlying programming languages. Using simple serialize encoding, developers guarantee transaction formats are forward-compatible.\n\nBesides the EIPs that are formally part of the Dencun upgrade, client teams have proposals that might be included. Let\u2019s take EIP-2537 as an example. It focuses on the BLS12-381 curve, used for signatures within Ethereum 2.0. There\u2019s no denying that Dencun is an essential step in Ethereum\u2019s development, but let\u2019s not forget that it\u2019s still a work in progress.\n\nEthereum Is Undergoing a Period of Tremendous Transformation\n\nPeople are becoming increasingly comfortable with blockchain technology, and the more they use it, the more they rely on it. As Ethereum advances, we continue to see more changes; it\u2019s hard, if not impossible, to anticipate its next move. Over the years, ETH has managed to adapt as new ideas have emerged from research and development, positioning itself as a powerful contender in the cryptocurrency industry. It faces regular updates meant to improve its technical capabilities, mainly realized with hard forks. Once the Dencun upgrade is live, Ethereum will undergo three critical updates: the Verge, the Purge, and the Splurge.\n\nThe Verge upgrade attempts to reduce the amount of data that validators must store on their machines; it will introduce Verkle trees for vector commitments and stateless protocols to make the Ethereum network more lightweight. As highlighted by Vitalik Buterin, it will be possible to launch nodes without having hundreds of gigabytes on your computer. The Purge upgrade is expected to remove legacy transactions and data from the post-Merge era when ETH relied on the Proof of Work consensus mechanism. Nodes will require less storage and bandwidth to sync with the network. What is more, the Purge will introduce sharding, used to disperse data among the nodes for effective management of big data.\n\nFinally, yet importantly, the Splurge upgrade aims to boost scalability and efficiency via rollups, a type of Layer 2 solutions that perform transaction execution outside the blockchain. It can be defined as a series of smaller upgrades striving to ensure the network runs as smoothly as possible. In other words, the Splurge combines several improvements that weren\u2019t included in the earlier upgrades. By the time the Verge, the Purge, and the Splurge are over, Ethereum will be different from what we know today.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWrapping It Up\n\nFor the time being, it\u2019s impossible to determine how the Dencun upgrade will impact the Ethereum network. From experience, we know that upgrades are applauded by the cryptocurrency community, so a surge in ETH deposits isn\u2019t out of the ordinary. It\u2019s highly unlikely there will be a decline in daily activity, but maybe there won\u2019t be as many NFTs traded on the Ethereum network. While not quite as big as the Merge, the Dencun upgrade constitutes a significant change to ETH; the first testnet fork should be announced soon. There\u2019s still room for other changes to the network, and only time will tell what EIPs developers will include.\n\nAs far as the timing of the Dencun upgrade is concerned, it\u2019s impossible to make a rough estimate until the scope is finalized. Ethereum is still below the $2000 level it reached in April this year, and median gas fees hit a 12-month high due to the resurgence of meme coins. The fast rise of the pepecoin (PEPE) has turned into profit, as those undeterred by the warnings transact on Ethereum, helping the network earn more money. As gas fees increase, more tokens are burnt, which translates into the fact that Ethereum is a deflationary asset. Analysts, nevertheless, are concerned about pepecoin ownership."

        "content": "The value of ETH burned since 2021 approached $10 billion.\n\nGas usage on the Ethereum network dropped due to low activity.\n\nSince the implementation of Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559 (EIP-1559), an upgrade aimed at improving the network\u2019s transaction fee mechanism, Ethereum [ETH] has witnessed a significant amount of ETH being burned.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nThe mechanism, which reduces the supply of ETH, has resulted in the burning of nearly $10 billion worth of ETH tokens, Dune Analytics revealed.\n\nCoping with the hope\n\nImplemented in August 2021, the Ethereum team developed EIP-1559 as one of the London Hark Fork Improvement Proposals. This happened alongside EIP-3554, 3198, 3529, and EIP-3541.\n\nAll these developments happened in preparation for its transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). For EIP-1559, the objective was to get rid of the previous fee market mechanism relating to its main gas fee calculation.\n\nWhile many users had hoped that the development would reduce gas fees on the network, it didn\u2019t. Instead, it brought about a discrete base fee, aimed at prioritizing transactions when validating blocks.\n\nFurther information from Dune, the analytics platforms showed that projects like Uniswap [UNI], Circle [USDC], and NFT marketplace OpenSea, played vital roles in the increase.\n\nAt press time, nearly 300,00 ETH each had been burned via Uniswap and OpenSea. And the reason for this is clear. Uniswap maintained its position as the leading Decentralized Exchange (DEX).\n\nSo, a lot of ETH swaps with other tokens influenced its rise. For OpenSea, its place as the number on the Ethereum-based marketplace puts it in the aforementioned positions. As for USDC, its position as the favored stablecoin in DEXes helped up its rank.\n\nGas usage falls\n\nHowever, Ethereum gas used had decreased as of this writing. According to Santiment, the ETH gas used was 16.05 billion. Used gas usage spikes when there\u2019s a lot of activity on the network.\n\nAnd this demand for ETH causes a rise in gas prices. So, the fall in usage reflects a relatively less busy period for the Ethereum network.\n\nOn looking at the network growth, the on-chain data provider revealed that the metric had decreased sharply. Typically, network growth measures the rate of adoption and influx of new users into a network.\n\nSo, when the network growth increases, it means that a project has impressive traction. However, when the metric decreases, it implies that utilization is low. And this is usually accompanied by low liquidity.\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum\u2019s burn mechanism has relatively addressed the network\u2019s concerns around transaction fees.\n\nAlso, the substantial amount of ETH burned also demonstrates the demand and usage of the Ethereum network, as well as the effectiveness of creating a more deflationary ecosystem. Whether it will improve or not, time will tell."

The wallet in question held 61,216 ETH worth around $116 million at the time of the transfer.\n\n\ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 A dormant pre-mine address containing 61,216 #ETH (116,396,127 USD) has just been activated after 8.0 years!https://t.co/f79T0fYa7b \u2014 Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 18, 2023\n\nThe wallet first made a small transfer of 0.05 ETH to crypto exchange Kraken, which was likely a test transaction before sending a larger amount. Shortly after, the user transferred the wallet\u2019s entire balance to the exchange, prompting some market participants to speculate that millions of dollars\u2019 worth of sell pressure was due to hit the market for ETH.\n\nPre-mined ETH was issued as a reward to Ethereum\u2019s early supporters, including those who funded the project during its Initial Coin Offering (ICO). The network started off with a supply of 72 million ETH, of which 83% was distributed to those who purchased the cryptocurrency in a crowd sale conducted in July and August 2014.\n\nThe crowd sale participants sent a total of 31,000 BTC to a designated Bitcoin address in exchange for an Ethereum wallet address to which the ETH they purchased would be distributed to after the network\u2019s official launch.\n\nAccording to blockchain data analysed by CoinDesk, 6,600 transactions were sent to the Bitcoin address, although the consensus among industry watchers is that the true number of crowd sale participants is far smaller, with big players likely splitting their purchases into multiple wallets. The average purchase price of ETH amounted to $0.30 per coin for those that took part.\n\nWhile most early buyers sold off their coins as the price of ETH rose significantly over the years, the remaining pre-mine addresses were thought to be staunch supporters of the cryptocurrency or those that lost their private keys and could no longer access their wallets.\n\nIf the wallet\u2019s owner does intend to sell, he or she will be cashing out on what is likely one of the largest returns on an initial investment in history."

        "title": "Decentralized? Ethereum and Lightning Network both at the mercy of cloud computing giants - CoinGeek",
        "content": "In the digital currency industry, the term \u2018decentralization\u2018 has taken on almost religious overtones. Its fiercest adherents are dead-set on limiting Bitcoin\u2019s potential and capabilities so as not to give a single inch of ground to the dreaded \u2018centralization,\u2019 and no project in the space can survive or thrive without giving decentralization at least a mention.\n\nYet, a recent story from DLNews and an announcement by Google Cloud about its partnership with \u2018Lightning as a Service\u2019 firm Voltage lay bare the lies at the heart of the decentralization myth.\n\nHow Ethereum and Lightning rely on AWS and big cloud companies\n\nWhen it comes to Ethereum, a staggering 2,439 of Ethereum\u2019s 6,810 nodes are hosted on AWS, with 1,395 of them in a single data center in Virginia. While the overall number of Ethereum nodes hosted on cloud computers has decreased by 10% since 2020, consolidating the remaining ones into a single provider\u2014AWS\u2014is concerning. Large Ethereum infrastructure companies like Consensys also continue to rely heavily on Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nIn such a situation, an outage or refusal of service could have catastrophic consequences for the Ethereum blockchain and staked ETH, yet, most Ethereum enthusiasts are oblivious to these risks. What could cause a firm like AWS or other cloud computing firms to refuse service to Ethereum nodes or applications? Something like a legal order from the U.S. government would probably do it. Those who dismiss such possibilities should ask Kim Dotcom of Mega Upload how Uncle Sam can take down a global network of criminal activity if he puts his mind to it.\n\nAs for the Lightning Network, which is often touted as BTC\u2019s scaling solution, it\u2019s not much better. Recently, Voltage, a Lightning as a Service (LaaS) company, announced it was partnering with Google Cloud (NASDAQ: GOOGL) to expand its hosting capabilities and attempt to scale to enterprise levels. This partnership will allow customers to spin up Lightning and BTC nodes globally but will further make a mockery of BTC \u2018nodes\u2019 and the network\u2019s quest to become truly outside the control of authorities like governments and their legal systems.\n\nOpinion: Let\u2019s stop worshiping the false idol of decentralization\n\nThe misunderstanding of what decentralization means is one of the most pervasive and harmful blockchain myths. Nothing has held the industry back more than attempting to solve the false trilemma, making networks scale while keeping them in line with some \u2018crypto anarchist\u2019 cyberpunk notion of what decentralization means.\n\nThe original Bitcoin, as Satoshi Nakamoto designed it, could scale unboundedly, and he said in his very first public post it was \u201ccompletely decentralized\u201d the way he released it. That\u2019s only possible if Satoshi meant something completely different by decentralization than is commonly understood today, something like being able to send micropayments (electronic cash) to anyone purely peer to peer, anywhere in the world instantly, without ever going through a trusted (central) third party just like physical in person cash transactions.\n\nIt is a cruel irony that Ethereum, BTC, and other blockchains had come to rely on AWS and other large cloud computing firms when the original Bitcoin was designed to challenge them, creating a truly distributed, robust network that could send payments and host/serve data, preventing the sort of outages and takedowns that Ethereum, BTC, and others must now live in fear of because of their reliance on these centralized services.\n\nAs for the notion of decentralization in the way BTC and Ethereum maximalists use it, what is the point if, to scale and make the blockchains work, you are ultimately reliant on large corporations subject to the very laws you seek to avoid by creating such a network?\n\nThe fact that such a large number of Ethereum nodes, and now the Lightning Network itself, are dependent on the services of publicly traded corporations, which are subject to the laws of governments in the jurisdictions they operate in, should cause thinkers to pause and realize that decentralization has become little more than a hypnotic mantra, an unattainable end in itself, and one that will never deliver on the promises its loudest proponents claim for it because it can\u2019t.\n\nOf course, Satoshi Nakamoto told us all of these years ago, and he has explained in detail how Bitcoin can act as a global distributed network to provide an alternative to these large cloud computing companies and why the law is ultimately unavoidable.\n\nLet\u2019s put the false notion of decentralization to bed, embrace the BSV blockchain, and work on giving Google Cloud, AWS, and other data monopolies a real challenge!\n\nFollow CoinGeek\u2019s Crypto Crime Cartel series, which delves into the stream of groups\u2014from BitMEX to Binance, Bitcoin.com, Blockstream, ShapeShift, Coinbase, Ripple,\n\nEthereum, FTX and Tether\u2014who have co-opted the digital asset revolution and turned the industry into a minefield for na\u00efve (and even experienced) players in the market.\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price rally has slowed down in recent weeks. The price has yet to break above the $2,000 level, which is making many market participants worried.\n\nEthereum Price Technical Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nThe Daily Chart:\n\nOn the daily timeframe, the price has been forming higher highs and higher lows since rebounding from the 200-day moving average earlier in June.\n\nHowever, there is a clear lack of bullish momentum, as the ETH price keeps pulling back towards the 50-day moving average located around the $1,900 mark. In case it breaks, there are two close support levels available: the $1,800 static level and the 200-day moving average close to the same price mark.\n\nTherefore, while the momentum is seemingly fading, there is still hope that a rebound from either of these levels would initiate the next rally higher.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart:\n\nRecent PA developments become clearer on the 4-hour chart.\n\nThe ETH price has broken above the $1,930 resistance level a couple of times since the beginning of July but has failed in both instances, as it has rapidly dropped back below the level.\n\nCurrently, the price is seemingly targeting the $1,850 short-term support level once again, with the $1,750 level available as the next target in line in case the former level fails to hold. The RSI indicator, while previously signaling the potential fake breakout and drop, is offering little insight at the moment, as it is oscillating around the 50% value. This behavior confirms the indecisiveness of the market participants and the equilibrium in momentum.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nEthereum Coinbase Premium Index\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has remained relatively stagnant over the past few months, consolidating around the $2,000 level. However, interesting activity has been going on in the background.\n\nThe chart displays the Ethereum Coinbase premium gap, which is calculated based on the gap between ETH\u2019s price on Coinbase and Binance, two of the largest exchanges in the world. This metric shows whether US investors are buying or selling on aggregate compared to other investors. Positive values indicate buying pressure from the United States.\n\nAs the image demonstrates, there has been a significant shift in the US market sentiment, as the premium gap index has mostly been positive. Considering that many US investors are wealthy individuals or institutions, this could be a positive signal for ETH, pointing out that it might be in the accumulation phase at the beginning of a new bull market."

        "content": "Fidelity Digital Assets released a \u201cQ2 2023 Signals Report\u201d on July 18, which claimed that Ether\u2019s outlook for the next 12 months and the long term is positive. Year-to-date, Ether (ETH) has gained 62%, but while the investment firm might be short-term bullish on Ether, that does not mean it believes that the month-long bullish channel will be sustained.\n\nWhile institutional investors like Fidelity Digital Assets may have a bullish longer-term vision for ETH's price, let\u2019s compare their analysis against network and market data to see if they\u2019re on the money.\n\nEther/USD 1-day price index. Source: TradingView\n\nBeyond the technical indicators, the rationale behind Fidelity\u2019s bullish outlook for Ether is the network\u2019s higher burn rate versus coin issuance, the \u201cnew address momentum\u201d and a growth in the number of network validators.\n\nFidelity \u201cQ2 2023 Signals Report,\u201d July 18. Source: Fidelity Digital Assets\n\nAccording to the Fidelity report, the net issuance since the Merge in September 2022 resulted in a net supply decrease of more than 700,000 Ether. Additionally, the analysts claim that Glassnode data showing an increasing number of Ethereum addresses that transacted for the first time ever proves healthy network adoption.\n\nThe report also points to a 15% increase in the number of active Ethereum validators in the second quarter.\n\nThe expectation around EIP-1153 is also building momentum for the Ethereum network, as the \u201ctransient storage opcode\u201d improves smart contract efficiency, reduces costs and amplifies the Ethereum Virtual Machine design. The change is especially meaningful for decentralized exchanges (DEXs), where Ethereum\u2019s dominance declined to 46% from 60% six months prior, according to DefiLlama data.\n\nDencun upgrade expected to reduce transaction costs\n\nAnother potentially bullish factor for the Ethereum network is the anticipated upgrade on the leading DEX, Uniswap. According to a July 17 presentation at the Ethereum Community Conference, the upcoming Uniswap v4 will allow users to build unlimited types of pools using programmable buttons (hooks), native ETH support and a singleton contract that performs internal transactions before settling final balances.\n\nThe announcement fueled the likelihood that EIP-1153 will be included in the next \u201cDencun\u201d upgrade, which triggered Slingshot and DeFi Pulse co-founder Scott Lewis.\n\ni had missed the news that uniswap labs got eip1153 into cancun.\n\n\n\nthey kept the details for wanting eip1153 secret from the community, only publishing v4 only after inclusion was finalized.\n\n\n\ninformal governance captured by an insider-aligned, for-profit monopoly. sad day. \u2014 scottlewis.canto\u2795 (@scott_lew_is) June 13, 2023\n\nIf approved, the implementation will be vital for the Ethereum network to recoup the market share lost due to high gas fees, as the seven-day average transaction cost has been above $4 since February. Consequently, Ethereum\u2019s total value locked has dropped to its lowest level since April 2020, at 13.55 million ETH, according to DefiLlama.\n\nMoreover, decentralized application activity has dwindled, as shown by DappRadar\u2019s unique active wallets\u2019 30-day data: Uniswap, minus 28%; 1inch Network, minus 14%; MetaMask Swap, minus 8%; and OpenSea, minus 5%. As a comparison, in the same period, BNB Smart Chain\u2019s PancakeSwap gained 10%, and Polygon\u2019s Uniswap users increased 8%.\n\nDerivatives metrics remain flat\n\nEther quarterly futures have been signaling unease among professional traders. Those fixed-month contracts typically trade at a 5% to 10% premium compared to spot markets to compensate for the delayed settlement, a situation known as contango.\n\nEther 3-month futures premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nAccording to data from Laevitas, the Ether three-month futures premium currently stands at 4%, which is below the neutral threshold and lower than the 5.5% level seen on July 14. This indicator is clear evidence that traders are less inclined to use leverage for bullish ETH positions.\n\nMore concerningly, Ether\u2019s 59% gains year-to-date might have caused investors to become overly optimistic. A recent survey from CryptoVantage of 1,000 North Americans that invested in cryptocurrencies over the past five years found that 46% named Ether as the top contender to surpass Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nRelated: Bitcoin rally will lead to \"speculative blow-off top\u201d in 2024, Mark Yusko predicts\n\nCoins with the best chances of surpassing Bitcoin. Source: 2023 CryptoVantage survey\n\nThis is a somewhat startling point of view, but it could be misleading since the survey did not ask whether any coin would eventually flip Bitcoin, so respondents don\u2019t necessarily place strong odds on this outcome.\n\nFidelity\u2019s analysis has given valid reasons for why the firm is bullish on Ether\u2019s 12-month price performance, but in the shorter term, the recurrent high gas fees and lack of interest from leverage buyers signal increased odds of the Ether price breaking below the channel support.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nModern account abstraction is \u201creally elegant\u201d because it doesn\u2019t require changes to the underlying protocol like other upgrades before it, said Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin at the Ethereum Community Conference (ETHCC) in Paris.\n\nDevelopers have been working on account abstraction, or different iterations of it, since 2015, even before Ethereum was launched. The idea is to switch from Externally Owned Wallets, or EOAs, to smart contract-based wallets. If they pull it off, managing a crypto wallet would become as easy as managing an email account.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat would mean users could potentially recover their seed phrase\u2014the private key used to sign trasnactions\u2014as easily as they can reset the password on an email account.\n\nThe latest version is EIP-4337 (Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4337), also known as Account Abstraction Using Alt Mempool. The Ethereum (ETH) upgrade would allow users to create non-custodial wallets as programmable smart contracts. This would unlock a number of features, such as easy wallet recovery, signless transactions\u2013which translates into lower transaction fees\u2013and team wallets (also known as multisignature wallets).\n\nAccording to Buterin, the upgrade could be one of the driving catalysts for Web3 adoption around the world. \u201cOne of the key properties we want blockchains to have is that they give you money before you register,\u201d he said.\n\nThe idea, he said, is for users to be able to receive any token, like a stablecoin, that isn\u2019t Ethereum with their smart contract wallet and be able to pay the gas fees without having to converthold ETH.\n\nIn order to allow for these types of wallets and transactions to be broadcasted, the latest account abstraction upgrade would enable the use of \u201cpaymasters,\u201d which allow users to pay for gas fees with whatever token they are transacting with.\n\nEIP-4337 also incorporates signature aggregators\u2014which allow for multiple signers to join together, and only one gets used in a transaction.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nButerin claimed today that \u201cthis is a pretty big deal,\u201d especially in rollups, due to the outsized footprint of a signature on these types of layer 2 solutions. Ethereum layer 2 scaling solutions, like Arbitrum or Optimism, batch transactions together and verify them off the Ethereum mainnet. Account abstraction would allow for signature aggregation. In simple terms, that would allow for more data compression, which translates into cheaper computation, and according to the Ethereum co-founder, \u201cwill reduce costs by 86 times.\u201d\n\nThis is not the only Ethereum upgrade currently in the works. Proto-danksharding, or EIP-4884 is also underway. It\u2019s quickly become one of the main focuses of development on the network because it sets the foundation for a new data type which will drastically reduce costs and make data usage more efficient."

Source: Cointelegraph\n\nAt the moment, when Ethereum users are transferring ERC-20 tokens, they are required to hold Ether (ETH) to pay for the transaction fees within the network. According to Buterin, account abstraction extensions, generally called \u201cpaymasters,\u201d can allow users to pay their fees with \u201cwhatever coins that they are transferring.\u201d Apart from this, the extension can also allow decentralized applications (DApps) to sponsor transactions for their users.\n\nMoreover, Buterin also talked about another extension called signature aggregation. According to the Ethereum founder, by compiling signatures with the feature, developers can save money on gas and data. He explained:\n\n\u201cThis is actually especially a big deal on rollups because in a rollup a big or on because a big part of the size of a transaction is the signature on a rollup.\u201d\n\nAlong with the potential benefits of account abstraction for users, Buterin also recognized that developers still need to overcome challenges. This includes needing an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) to upgrade current Ethereum externally-owned accounts \u2014 normal user accounts \u2014 into smart contracts and ensuring the protocol works similarly in layer-2 solutions.\n\nRelated: Lost keys have already cost billions of dollars, many more at risk \u2014 Polygon exec\n\nButerin also highlighted that there are additional challenges when it comes to integrating with existing technologies, such as biometrics and integration with existing wallets.\n\nDespite the obstacles the account abstraction endeavor faced, the Ethereum co-founder expressed excitement about its progress. \u201cAccount abstraction has made a lot of progress, and I\u2019m excited about all of the progress that we\u2019ll continue making in the future,\u201d he said.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Account abstraction\u2019 supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide"

Discover SCENE\n\nSpot trading volumes on centralized crypto exchanges plummeted by 43% in the second quarter of 2022, new data from CoinGecko suggests.\n\nAnd Binance\u2014which has been slashing jobs as it retreats from key markets and faces civil charges in the U.S.\u2014was especially hard hit.\n\nCoinGecko's report covering Q2 indicates that the world's biggest exchange has seen its dominance slide from 62% to 51% in just three months\u2014a sign that Changpeng Zhao's constant cries of \"FUD\" aren't washing with crypto traders.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe contraction in trading volumes, which was also seen on decentralized exchanges, comes despite a 7% uptick in Bitcoin's price throughout the quarter.\n\nBinance's woes also extended to the stablecoin markets, with BUSD losing 45.4% of its market cap between April and June after the embattled exchange made True USD (TUSD) its default stablecoin. The switch saw TUSD become the biggest gainer of the quarter after $1 billion was minted on the Tron network\u2014that's a 50% rise. Tether remains firmly at the top of the list, and concluded the quarter with a 66% share of the stablecoin market.\n\nAccording to CoinGecko, things are also looking gloomy in the NFT sector, despite Bitcoin Ordinals reigniting interest in crypto collectibles. Bored Ape Yacht Club prices have recently sunk to a two-year low, down 88% from their peak in a torrid time for top-tier projects. Trading volumes among all NFTs fell 35% to $3.15 billion in Q2. And Solana\u2014which has been rocked by multiple outages in recent years\u2014saw demand crater by a jaw-dropping 79% as flagship collections migrated to Ethereum and Polygon.\n\nThere was better news for Ethereum, which has largely shrugged off the threat of Bitcoin Ordinals. CoinGecko's data says 83% of NFT trading occurred via its blockchain over the quarter\u2014but there is a chance this could start to erode as 2023 continues.\n\nAnd despite withdrawals of staked ETH being activated after a years-long wait, the total amount of Ethereum locked up by validators rallied by 30% in the second quarter\u2014hitting just shy of 24 million as a result. That's worth close to $45 billion at current market rates, and indicates crypto enthusiasts are keen to get involved in staking now there's certainty over retrieving locked-up funds.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

Another example would be having a core decentralized autonomous organization smart contract on Ethereum while handling fully private voting on Sapphire, with the end results being sent back to the core DAO contract.\n\n\u201cIn this way, the privacy capabilities of Sapphire are exposed to any other chain.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Oasis Foundation director, the majority of DApps being developed on Oasis are privacy-centric and enable users to have full control over their on-chain data and how that gets shared and accessed. This is also evident in a list of different tools and platforms that have been built within the Oasis ecosystem.\n\nRelated: Oasis Foundation launches $160M development fund\n\nKos highlighted confidential decentralized exchanges, privacy-enabled blockchain gaming, account abstration, confidential nonfungible tokens, private voting, sealed-bid auctions, key management and decentralized identification as use cases that have come to the fore from builders on the Oasis chain.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin provided an in-depth review of the ongoing development and challenges of the blockchain\u2019s \u201caccount abstraction\u201d at the EthCC in Paris on July 18.\n\nVitalik Buterin laid it all out there on the latest developments and roadblocks of Ethereum\u2019s \u201caccount abstraction\u201d \u2014 a concept aimed at increasing the platform\u2019s adaptability by enabling users to define their account security models \u2014 at the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Paris. He broke down the idea, explaining how it\u2019s all about adding flexibility to Ethereum by giving users the power to decide on their accounts\u2019 security.\n\nRecalling the origin story of account abstraction in Ethereum (ETH), Buterin shared, \u201cRight from the start, we were all about letting accounts be controlled by code, not just keys.\u201d Just like any good story, though, there were plot twists \u2013 technical difficulties like non-unique transaction hashes and sorting out miner fees from smart contract wallets became hurdles.\n\nHappening now at #EthCC Main Stage: @VitalikButerin\u2019s talk on account abstraction\n\n\n\nFull house & full excitement for the \ud83d\udc10\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc99\ud83e\udd0d\u2764\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/QTD5sCuDwv \u2014 EthCC \u2013 Ethereum Community Conference (@EthCC) July 18, 2023\n\nProgress hasn\u2019t stopped, especially with the introduction of EIP-4337. This account abstraction standard plays it smart \u2013 it skips changing the base protocol by sticking to smart contracts. The big picture? It lets wallets connect via a trusted \u201centry point\u201d contract, rounds up meta-transactions via \u201cbundler\u201d contracts, and brings in MEV builders to handle fee markets.\n\nButerin painted a clear picture of what this modern account abstraction could mean for users. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about extensions, or \u2018paymasters,\u2019 that could let users pay their fees with the same coins they\u2019re moving around,\u201d he said.\n\nYou might also like: Buterin criticizes US crypto policy\u2019s detrimental impact on projects like Solana\n\nHe also pointed out the potential of signature aggregation, explaining, \u201cThis could be a game-changer, especially on rollups where the size of a transaction is mostly the signature.\u201d By pulling together signatures, developers could save a chunk on gas and data costs.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all smooth sailing. Buterin didn\u2019t skirt around the tough stuff. He talked about the need for an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) to shift current Ethereum externally-owned accounts into smart contracts. There are also challenges like making sure everything works with layer-2 solutions and blends with existing technologies like biometrics and wallets.\n\nBut through all the ups and downs, Buterin stays optimistic about account abstraction\u2019s progress and future. He said, \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way with account abstraction, and I can\u2019t wait to see where we\u2019ll go next.\u201d\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

However, never have all three of these major cryptocurrencies triggered this signal all at the same time. What exactly does this mean, and what are the results of the 3-day golden cross?\n\nBitcoin, XRP, & Ethereum Lead Market Recovery\n\nThe crypto market outlook is a lot less bleak than it was just weeks ago, between BlackRock and other institutions seeking to launch Bitcoin ETFs and the massive win for XRP and Ripple against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nEven the technical environment is starting to show signs of a possible uptrend brewing. Notably, several top cryptocurrencies are inching closer to a golden cross on the 3-day timeframe, which has only occurred a handful of times in the past.\n\nThis is about to happen in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, simultaneously, for the first time in their history. Previously, these signals arrived at different phases of previous bull markets. It wasn\u2019t until all three coins golden crossed that a stronger rally began.\n\nThree top crypto assets \u2014 #Bitcoin, Ethereum, and #XRP \u2014 are on the brink of a golden cross on the 3-day timeframe All three firing at the same time has never happened before It will also be the third in history for BTC and XRP, second ever for Ether pic.twitter.com/bzVfK3ZpBp \u2014 Tony \u201cThe Bull\u201d (@tonythebullBTC) July 19, 2023\n\nWhat Is A Golden Cross In Crypto?\n\nA golden cross occurs when a higher timeframe moving average, typically a 200-period MA, crosses above a lower timeframe moving average, usually a 50-period MA, from below. In contrast, a death cross happens when the two cross down from from above.\n\nThese crossovers generate a buy or sell signal in a moving average-based trading system. Such systems are designed to capture the majority of a trend, but tend to miss much of the early part of a rally as it awaits confirmation.\n\nThe 3-day golden cross throughout the years | BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nMoving Average Crossover: How Does The Signal Stack Up?\n\nThe only time the signal suffered a drawdown was in Bitcoin in 2019. In all other instances, the buy signal using nothing more than a simple moving average crossover, was wildly profitable with limited downside. In 2015, the BTCUSD 3-day golden cross yielded over 2,000% ROI before crossing back down and giving the corresponding sell signal. XRP\u2019s golden cross to death cross kept more than 9,000% of the uptrend\u2019s gains. Ethereum never fired a signal back then, however, due to insufficient price history.\n\nCome 2019, Bitcoin had its misfire where the buy signal then sat through a long drawdown. Neither XRP nor Ethereum triggered a signal until 2020, when the entire crypto market began to rally together. The 2020 ETHUSD golden cross held onto over 1100% ROI before the death cross closed out the position. XRP failed to set a new all-time high, but the golden cross still clocked in 200% ROI.\n\nEven though Bitcoin fired early in 2019 and sat through a drawdown, the buy signal was still ultimately effective and retained 550% ROI by the time a death cross caused the position to close. Across the five historic buy signals, there was an average of 2,570% ROI when a golden cross occurred. While such returns aren\u2019t likely in the future, this does suggest the signal is effective.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "A pre-mined stash of Ethereum, dormant for nearly eight years and now valued at roughly $116 million, has been moved abruptly. This transaction raises questions about potential market implications and whether it could trigger a notable price dip for Ethereum.\n\nEight years ago, during Ethereum\u2019s pre-mine period, the wallet accumulated a total of 61,216 ETH. Back then, the value of the tokens was around $18,976, but due to Ethereum\u2019s exponential growth, the value has now escalated over a thousandfold.\n\nStirring From Dormancy\n\nThe ETH in question, stashed in a single wallet address, has remained untouched since it was pre-mined. But in an unexpected move, all 61,216 ETH were transferred to an address associated with the Kraken crypto exchange. This transfer marks the end of an eight-year-long dormancy.\n\n\ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 A dormant pre-mine address containing 61,216 #ETH (116,396,127 USD) has just been activated after 8.0 years!https://t.co/f79T0fYa7b \u2014 Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 18, 2023\n\nRewinding to June 2014, the Ethereum network staged a unique sale event. As the network was yet to begin generating tokens autonomously, this event served as an opportunity for early team members and co-founders to accumulate pre-mined ETH.\n\nAt this point in time, ETH was trading at the price of $0.31, thus valuing this particular collection of 61,216 ETH at an estimated $18,976. Fast forward to the present day, and the value of these same tokens has skyrocketed to approximately $116.9 million.\n\nThis dramatic surge in ETH\u2019s price over the years underscores the substantial growth and adoption of Ethereum\u2019s network. Consequently, the recent movement of this significant ETH stash has piqued the interest of the crypto community, eager to understand the potential implications of this action.\n\nMajor Ethereum Dip Imminent?\n\nTypically, large transfers of a cryptocurrency to an exchange can indicate an intent to sell, and this can potentially put downward pressure on the price if the amount being sold is significant compared to the overall trading volume.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that not all large deposit into the exchange means a potential fall for the crypto being transferred as the person or entity transferring the ETH might not sell immediately or might decide to sell gradually to minimize market impact.\n\nRelated Reading: Ethereum Price Is Showing Early Signs of Fresh Increase, But This Resistance Is Key\n\nAlso, it is worth analyzing how the whale ended up depositing its pre-mined ETH into the exchange. Etherscan data verifies the transaction, which occurred on July 18. The operation of moving is $116.9 million in ETH and required a negligible fee of $1.68 and 25.475673161 Gwei in gas price.\n\nThe identity of the wallet owner remains a mystery and their cautious approach is noteworthy, as they ensured to avoid human errors that could result in substantial loss. They did this by first sending a small test transaction of 0.05 ETH to the Kraken address before moving the entire lot.\n\nThe transaction has also highlighted the value of HODL-ling, a strategy that emphasizes the long-term accumulation of crypto tokens. It underscores how patience can lead to significant gains in the volatile world of crypto.\n\nNonetheless, Ethereum price is up 0.7% in the past 24 hours, indicating that the whale might be yet to make any move with its deposited ETH. The second largest asset currently trades at a price of $1,910, at the time of writing with a 24-hour trading volume of $7.4 billion\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Featuring Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, the London hard fork introduced significant changes to Ethereum\u2019s transaction fee mechanism. Users now pay a base fee that is subsequently burned, effectively removing ether from circulation forever.\n\nThis approach significantly impacted the token\u2019s supply, resulting in a monthly burn rate of approximately 146,000 ETH.\n\nThe London Hard Fork And Its Deflationary Impact\n\nIntegrated into the Ethereum network on August 5, 2021, the London hard fork brought a paradigm shift in the cryptocurrency\u2019s transaction fee structure.\n\nThrough the EIP-1559, the network introduced a unique mechanism that involved the burning of a significant portion of transaction fees, known as the \u201cbase fee.\u201d This innovative approach aimed to counterbalance Ethereum\u2019s inflation while providing block rewards and priority fees to miners.\n\nAs a result, the base fee is permanently removed from circulation, leading to a deflationary effect on the token\u2019s supply.\n\nThe scale of the burn has been enormous, with over 3.46 million ETH, worth $6.68 billion, annihilated since the London hard fork\u2019s enforcement. This translates to an average monthly burn rate of more than 146,000 ETH over the 710-day period that followed the upgrade.\n\n146,000 ETH burned per month | Source: Beaconcha.in\n\nEthereum\u2019s deflationary path effectively offset the issuance of new tokens, curbing its supply growth by approximately 0.1% annually.\n\nLeading Contributors To The Ethereum Burn\n\nThe principal factors driving Ethereum\u2019s burn phenomenon include regular ETH transfers, non-fungible token (NFT) transactions on Opensea, and activities on the decentralized exchange Uniswap.\n\nRegular ETH transfers accounted for the most substantial reduction in supply, leading to the incineration of nearly 300,000 ETH.\n\nUniswap v2 follows closely, with $56.5 million worth of ETH burned since the hard fork, while transfers of Tether stablecoins contributed to the destruction of $50.5 million worth of ETH.\n\nETH price struggles to hold $1,900 support | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nBlockchain gaming platform Axie Infinity and Uniswap v3 each burned $32 million and $30 million worth of ETH, respectively.\n\nAt the same time, the number of ETH staked in the Ethereum Beacon contract has also been on the rise. It is now sitting at over 26.87 million ETH, translating to a dollar value of $51.35 billion.\n\nWith the Ethereum supply sitting at 120.2 million, it means that over 11% of its supply is currently locked up while the burn continues to take coins out of circulation.\n\n\n\nBoth of these developments combined could see the circulating supply of the digital asset reduce drastically, leading to a rise in the price of ETH as time goes on.\n\nETH is currently trading at a price of $1,903 at the time of this writing, representing a 0.72% increase in the last day.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

However, not all members of the Ethereum community agreed with this course of action, leading to the creation of Ethereum Classic. By utilizing the unaltered Ethereum ledger that preserved the hacked transactions, Ethereum Classic distinguished itself as a blockchain platform.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSo the real question is \u2014 how to mine Ethereum Classic? Mining ETC involves a process wherein computer networks compete to validate transactions and earn rewards through ETC tokens. The ETC coin mining supply is finite, with mining gradually shifting from rewards to transaction fees. The average mining time for a new ETC mining block is 11.6 seconds.\n\nThe Beginning of ETC Mining Pools\n\nWhere did ETC mining pool possibilities come from? In 2016, Ethereum Classic (ETC) was created due to a split from Ethereum triggered by the launch of the decentralized autonomous organization called the DAO.\n\nBacked by $150 million in crowdfunding, the DAO suffered a code flaw that enabled hackers to steal $50 million from its funds.\n\nThe Ethereum community was divided on how to address the hack. Some proposed reversing the ETH blockchain to reimburse the affected users, while others believed in preserving the immutability of the blockchain.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nFollowing a vote, the pro-fork side gained over 85% support, resulting in the fork that gave birth to Ethereum Classic. At the same time, the minority retained the original Ethereum blockchain as Ethereum Classic.\n\nEthereum Classic mining pool operates its blockchain, utilizing the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), supporting smart contracts, decentralized applications (dapps), and its unique cryptocurrency, ETC.\n\nEvolution of ETC Mining Pools Over Time\n\nMiners subsequently shifted their focus to the Ethereum Classic mining pool, significantly increasing its hash rate by 280%. This surge was primarily driven by staking pools operated by centralized companies, enabling ETH holders to pool their tokens for validator status.\n\nBefore the split, the U.S. Treasury sanctioned Tornado Cash, a virtual currency mixer accused of facilitating money laundering, highlighting concerns with Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake mechanism.\n\nThis conflict highlights the ideological divergence between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, with purists favoring a decentralized model while pragmatists lean towards Ethereum\u2019s adaptability. That\u2019s a brief overview of the ETC mining pool evolution.\n\nCase Study: Hiveon.net ETC Mining Pool\n\nMining pools play a vital role in the competitive crypto-mining landscape. Infrastructure quality and payout structure are among the factors to consider when choosing the best ETC mining pool. To simplify the process, let\u2019s focus on Hiveon.\n\nHiveon, built on HiveOS, aims to provide favorable conditions for mining ETC. With over 10,000 active miners, it offers a user-friendly experience for both novice and experienced miners. The platform supports global mining farms, attracting a diverse community.\n\nKey features:\n\nCommission-free Hiveon pool.\n\nHiveon pool pays all transaction fees.\n\nPPS+ payout model: Hiveon pool rewards members for legitimate shares regardless of when they joined.\n\nLow payout threshold: 0.1 ETH ensures shorter wait times.\n\nThe Hiveon pool contains servers across Europe, Russia, North America (CA, US East, US West), and Asia for the best mining performance.\n\nAdditionally, Hiveon ETC pool offers a convenient iOS and Android app for easy currency management. The interface includes step-by-step tutorials, ensuring a seamless experience for Ethereum Classic mining. Hive OS also helps reduce costs, making it an attractive option for many miners.\n\nThe Profitability of ETC Mining\n\nGiven the high expenses and increasing difficulty of ETC mining, many miners now rely on mining pools to maximize profitability. This strategy is vital for smaller miners who struggle to recover equipment and electrical expenditures.\n\nIndividual miners join mining pools to increase their chances of mining a block and collecting rewards. These rewards are then distributed among participants based on their contributed hashing power.\n\nTypically, mining pool operators charge fees for pool maintenance and participation. Multiple pools with varying structures are available to choose from.\n\nAdditionally, there are opportunities for generating an ETC mining profit, enabling miners to utilize internet-based computing resources. However, this method incurs additional costs as miners essentially rent others\u2019 equipment.\n\nTo optimize profitability in ETC mining, Hiveon.net offers valuable solutions. Miners can maximize profits using Hiveon ETC pool profitability tools, including the ETC mining profitability calculator and support.\n\nThe Future of ETC Mining Pools\n\nThe evolving e-currency landscape presents new developments and challenges for the ETC mining pool. Technological advancements in mining hardware can significantly improve pool performance and efficiency in ETC mining.\n\nMining pool operators must adapt to regulatory changes and shifts in the broader financial landscape to thrive in this dynamic environment. Monitoring market trends and making strategic adjustments are essential for survival and success in the crypto market.\n\nAdopting an agile approach, embracing emerging technologies, and testing new extraction techniques are vital for the prosperity of mining pools. Strong partnerships within the crypto community further contribute to their long-term sustainability.\n\nETC extraction pools must maintain proactive and adaptable operational methods to navigate the shifting landscape successfully. Embracing innovation in the Ethereum Classic mining pool and timely responses to emerging challenges are crucial driving forces behind their achievements.\n\nIt is important to recognize that the future of ETC extraction pools is intertwined with broader developments in the crypto sphere, emphasizing the need for continuous innovation and effective adaptation.\n\nConclusion and Call to Action\n\nVarious ETC mining pool options have greatly influenced the growth and decentralization of the Ethereum Classic mining pool network. Joining an extraction pool like this increases mining profitability and strengthens security and stability in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nAmong the many options available, Hiveon ETC pool is a reputable and highly regarded choice favored by ETC miners. Considered by many the best ETC mining pool, Hiveon.net boasts an impressive track record, extensive features, and a supportive community, creating an environment where miners can thrive and maximize their mining potential.\n\nJoining Hiveon.net is strongly recommended without hesitation, as it allows you to actively shape the future of decentralized finance through an ETC mining pool.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin sheds light on Ethereum's account abstraction journey at EthCC - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "At the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Paris, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin gave an insightful presentation on the history and evolution of \u201caccount abstraction\u201d on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAccount abstraction is a feature in Ethereum that aims to make the system more flexible and easier to use. It essentially allows users to define the security model of their accounts, making Ethereum more adaptable for different use cases.\n\nFor instance, this feature allows users to set their own transaction validation rules, such as multi-signature requirements or spending limits. They can also make their accounts compatible with a future cryptographic algorithm.\n\nButerin described account abstraction as allowing Ethereum accounts to be controlled by smart contract code rather than private keys.\n\nEarly days of account abstraction\n\nAccording to Buterin, the idea of allowing accounts to be controlled by code rather than just keys was present in Ethereum from the beginning.\n\nThe Ethereum Yellow Paper outlined two types of accounts \u2013 Externally Owned Accounts (controlled by private keys) and Contract Accounts (managed by smart contract code). However, some challenges emerged in the early days of implementing account abstraction.\n\nIn the first Ethereum proof-of-concept release, there was optimism that users would adopt multi-signature wallets. However, this did not happen immediately, and exchange deposit detection became harder with multi-sig. There were also complexities with paying miner fees from smart contract wallets. The original vision was for all transactions to be simple \u201ccalls,\u201d but issues like non-unique transaction hashes made the problem difficult.\n\nEvolution of account abstraction\n\nThe Ethereum community iterated on many account abstraction ideas over the years. Proposals emerged around standardizing signatures, using \u201cbreakpoint\u201d opcodes, restricting access during transaction verification, and more. But progress was slow due to the complexities of changing the base protocol and the focus on delivering proof-of-stake. It wasn\u2019t until 2020 that a concrete account abstraction EIP was proposed.\n\nIndependent projects like Gas Station Network and Argent Wallet drove further innovation. They found creative ways to enable meta-transactions and abstract accounts using only smart contracts. However, solutions relying on \u201cwrapper\u201d transactions had downsides like high per-transaction overhead.\n\nMost recently, EIP-4337 was proposed to provide a universal account abstraction standard using only smart contracts, avoiding base protocol changes. This allows wallets to integrate through a trusted \u201centry point\u201d contract, uses \u201cbundler\u201d contracts to batch meta-transactions, and leverages MEV builders to provide fee markets. Extensions like paymaster contracts enable additional capabilities like token-based fee payment.\n\nFuture of account abstraction\n\nButerin acknowledged the increased desire to enshrine parts of account abstraction (like ERC-4337) directly into the protocol for efficiency and censorship resistance. He also noted the importance of ensuring a smooth transition for legacy EOA users and integrating innovations like biometric signers.\n\nOverall, Buterin\u2019s presentation provided a rare insight into Ethereum\u2019s historical struggles to enable advanced account structures. Through years of iteration and industry collaboration, substantial progress has been made on this complex but foundational problem.\n\nAs Buterin noted, the work of many talented Ethereum developers has brought the ecosystem much closer to the original vision of seamless and flexible account abstraction.\n\nInterestingly, other protocols like INTU provide an alternative approach to the Ethereum Foundation\u2018s concept of account abstraction. INTU retains EOAs through local cryptography in the form of distributed externally owned accounts (dEOAs,) thus opening up account sharing, threshold signatures, and private key abstraction without needing more gas-intensive smart contract accounts. INTU announced its public beta at EthCC\n\nThe innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem is arguably stronger than ever, with ETH making up 19% of the total crypto market cap, close to the all-time high of 24% set in 2018.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price could slump 10% to the $27,500 range if the crucial line of defense at $29,872 is lost.\n\nEthereum price slipping below critical trendline support makes ETH attractive to the June 7 lows of $1,824.\n\nXRP could record a new range high as Ripple price tests the great highs of July 13 at $0.817.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has traders at the edge of their seats, treading along dangerous lines as investors wait for a decisive, tangible move to influence their hand. The confusion also extends to the Ethereum (ETH) price camp where gloom continues to spread. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) remains nostalgic for the July 13 trade, and now bulls want to relive it.\n\nAlso Read: Traders ask how high heavens could be for Bitcoin price as SEC sets down eight BTC ETF applications.\n\nBitcoin price on the fence\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is on the fence, bordering between falling back into the consolidation range or breaking below and extending south. The $29,872 support level remains critical for BTC, pivoting the price action to determine which way next.\n\nAfter a brief break below the crucial support, an influx of buyer momentum restored Bitcoin price within the range. This is indicated by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) attempting to make a decisive bend north and stay above 50. A strong foray north by the RSI could compel Bitcoin price to extrapolate to the upside, potentially breaching the $31,500 range high and recording a new local high.\n\nWith the right trigger, buying pressure could catapult Bitcoin price to the $31,500 level, denoting a 20% climb from the current level.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nOn the other hand, if buying pressure reduces, bears could seize the opportunity to pull Bitcoin price lower. A daily candlestick close below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $29,286 would spell doom for BTC, making a retracement to the $27,500 level likely.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price stays above $30,000; Cathie Wood assures increased confidence in BTC.\n\nEthereum price slips below crucial support\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has slipped below the uptrend line in a move that threatens investors' profit prospects. Unless ETH restores above this bullish trendline, the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) token faces a breakdown below the 50- and 100-day EMAs at $1,871 and $1,835, respectively, to tag the July 7 lows of around $1,824.\n\nThe Awesome Oscillators (AO) bolster the case for the bears, as the histograms of this momentum indicator are flashing red in huge volumes to show bears fastening their grip on ETH.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if more bulls approach the scene, the ensuing buying pressure could pull Ethereum price back above the uptrend line. A sustained move above this bullish consolidation trendline could see ETH hit $1,959 soon.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, the largest altcoin by trading volume could shatter the psychological $2,000 level and target the $2,120 range high next. Such a move would see ETH holders rake in up to 10% profits.\n\nAlso Read: Axie Infinity, Space ID, Euler brace for volatility over imminent $25.91 million worth in cliff token unlocks.\n\nRipple price will not yield.\n\nRipple (XRP) price is recovering from the dip recorded after the dissipation of hype following Ripple Lab's partial win against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 13. At the time, the remittance token recorded an intra-day high of $0.938 before returning to a daily close of $0.818.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ripple price is trying to shatter this local peak and extend a neck north. An increase in buying pressure could see this strategy pan out, clearing the path for a possible rally to the $0.938 range high. Such a move would constitute a 15% climb.\n\nThe RSI at 77 is still rising, suggesting increasing momentum that could bode well for Ripple price. While others may interpret this RSI range as overbought, it is worth mentioning that Welles Wilder only confirms an actual sell signal when the RSI crosses the 70 mark to the downside. As long as the RSI is northbound \u2013 even if it is above 70 \u2013 the asset could record more gains backed by significant buyer momentum.\n\nThe AO indicator also bolsters the case for the bulls, recording deep green histograms in the positive territory to show that bulls are in control.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nIf profit-taking begins, Ripple price could pull back with a potential revisit of the $0.697 range before another foray north.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple price races to $1.0, records the largest crypto asset hourly volume as chatter to list XRP intensify"

The portrait, by Canadian photographer Andrew Miller, was taken before the popular developer became famous.\n\nThe NFT sale also celebrates the 10th year since Ethereum was created by sharing a portrait of the Ethereum founder that has not been sold before.\n\nWithin the image, Buterin is wearing formal wear \u2014 a look that the Ethereum founder does not wear regularly. The NFT listing shared the story behind the portrait and how it came to be.\n\nAccording to the listing, Miller met Buterin in Toronto before he became famous. Because the photographer believed in the young founder\u2019s vision, he wanted to do something to contribute to giving the young inventor \u201ca stronger public image and marketability.\u201d\n\nHowever, during the photo shoot for the portrait, Buterin came with his usual get-up, which the listing described as \u201cdistressed casual clothing,\u201d noting that the Ethereum co-founder had \u201cno instinct for any formal photos.\u201d Because Miller was unsatisfied with the look, he took off his own striped shirt for Buterin to wear.\n\nRelated: Vitalik Buterin shares account abstraction challenges in Ethereum: EthCC\n\nNeopets transitions into a non-crypto game\n\nThe creators of the NFT-powered game Neopets Metaverse have recently announced some changes to the project following a shift in leadership. According to the announcement, the team will now focus on a fresh concept dubbed World of Neopets.\n\nHowever, the team clarified that the game is not a crypto-based game like Neopets Metaverse. In a blog post, the team wrote:\n\n\u201cThe decision has been made to transition away from the Neopets Metaverse game and redistribute those resources to the development of a game that we feel can better reflect our values and vision.\u201d\n\nAccording to the team, the Neopets Genesis Collection, Neopets Pizzaroo Collection and Neopets Masterpiece will all still be available on the open market. The team highlighted that it will continue to support the community that embraced the collections. In addition, the team noted that the Neopets Metaverse Discord channel will remain functional.\n\nDespite the assurances, many community members were unhappy with the changes, with some raising questions about Neopets potentially performing a \u201clegal form of rug pull.\u201d\n\nCommunity members commenting on the changes.

        "content": "The Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) is underway in Paris, and the general feeling is that this may be a really big week for Ethereum. Being the largest annual European Ethereum event, this flagship conference has over 250 speakers coming from all over the world. Could it also affect the Ethereum price?\n\nScheduled for 17th to 20th July, the 2023 EthCC week will feature multiple events. There will be meetups, panels, parties, as well as other attractive side events as the Ethereum community engage to chart a prosperous course for the network championing the decentralized movement.\n\nA very important week for Ethereum\n\nThe need for industry insiders to come together from time to time cannot be overemphasized. A blockchain network like Ethereum, hosting thousands of projects will benefit immensely from community conferences. EthCC 2023 is a critical educational gathering with welcoming celebrations.\n\nWhile inclusive conversations are expected to be the hallmark of this conference, social interactions will play huge roles too. The conference will also provide ample opportunity for individuals and businesses to showcase their projects and make relevant announcements.\n\nA major international conference like EthCC also has the potential to influence the prices of digital assets. A positive outcome of the EthCC week in Paris, therefore, could provide a positive influence in the ETH markets.\n\nA pair of interesting announcements\n\nBarely 24 hours into the EthCC week, we\u2019re expecting a number of announcements that reiterate the importance of the event. Here are a couple of announcements that will reiterate the importance of the event:\n\nMantle Network unveils Mainnet Alpha and $200 million ecosystem fund\n\nEthereum Layer 2 project, Mantle Network, is one of the first projects to make a big announcement in the ongoing EthCC in Paris. The network announced its mainnet alpha yesterday, in addition to a $200 million ecosystem fund. This is coming barely after 6 months of testnet development.\n\nMantle Network used the opportunity provided by EthCC to intimate current and potential partners of its current position and targets. Thanks to a strategic merger with BitDAO in May, the project is now backed by one of the largest treasuries in the crypto sector.\n\nConsenSys launches Linea Network\n\nAnother announcement that will make waves in the EthCC will be the launch of the mainnet alpha of the Linea Network by Consensys. The Ethereum development company, which is behind such popular projects as MetaMask and Infura, has decided to join Ethereum scaling race in a remarkable way.\n\nSometime last week, Consensys onboarded ecosystem partners. The company will now leverage EthCC to open Linea Network, a zkEVM rollup to the public. Linea, according to a company statement, is an EVM equivalent. The implication is that Ethereum-native protocols can deploy on the Linea Network without much fuse.\n\nWrapping up\n\nThis is certainly a big week for Ethereum, and in extension, a big week for the decentralized movement. As participants from all over the world engage positively in Paris, relevant announcements that could shape the future of Ethereum will be made. In addition to the announcements, we expect that the event will yield the results necessary for building a sustaining a positive, fertile ecosystem."

The pioneer crypto's rangebound movement suggests that volatility has dropped, which has held a majority of altcoin ecosystem hostage, including Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices.\n\nAlso Read: Whales are secretly accumulating these two DeFi coins: LINK, UNI\n\nBitcoin price eyes big changes\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price shows a shrinking volatility, suggesting a big incoming price change to either upside or downside. The price is moving within a short leash, capped at $31,500 and $29,872 to the upside and downside, respectively. A decisive break and subsequent candlestick close above or below the range will decide the next direction.\n\nWith momentum indicators pointing to declining buying pressure, Bitcoin price could break below the lower support level at $29,872. Notably, much uncollected liquidity is underneath this level, which acts as a downside pull for BTC as traders wait for ideal entry positions.\n\nTherefore, a decisive break below the crucial support at $29,872 could see Bitcoin price pull lower toward the $27,500 range.

If conservative trading prevails and bulls sit on their hands, a confirmed break below the ascending trendline could open the drains for ETH. This could see the altcoin tag the 50-day EMA at $1,868 or, worse, re-register the July 7 lows around $1,824. This is marked by the support confluence between the 100-day EMA and the horizontal line, making it a robust buyer congestion zone.\n\nETH/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nConversely, buying pressure from the EMAs could facilitate a north swing, sustaining ETH\u2019s move along the uptrend line and ultimately breaching the $1,959 resistance level. In highly ambitious cases, the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) token could reclaim the mid-April highs around the $2,120 mark.\n\nAlso Read: Why Ethereum\u2019s EIP-4844 could kickstart bull run for Optimism (OP), Arbitrum (ARB), Polygon (MATIC)\n\nRipple price trades marginally as consolidation climaxes\n\nRipple (XRP) price is filling up a pennant, trading in a steadily narrowing. With neither bulls nor bears giving way to their trading positions, the pennant decides which way this tug-of-war will go.\n\nNotably, however, there are already small spillages below the support offered by the uptrend line of the pennant. This suggests bears might have a better and tighter grip on Ripple price.\n\nThis gloomy outlook is reflected by the RSI, showing a bearish divergence against the Ripple price. This comes as XRP records higher highs along the lower boundary of the pennant, while on the other hand, the RSI is showing lower highs.\n\nThe odds, therefore, favor the downside suggesting an imminent retest of the mid-July lows around $0.697. A decisive 4-hour candlestick close below this level will confirm the downtrend.\n\nXRP/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nOn the other hand, if late investors buy the remittance token, the Ripple price could break the pennant to the north, making a run for the peak of the technical formation at $0.823. Such a move would denote a 15% climb from the current level.\n\nAlso Read: XRP ruling puts cryptocurrencies in nuanced position, industry experts weigh in."

        "content": "An environment of healthy competition is being fostered between the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s top development firms building zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines (zkEVMs) to scale the network, according to one of Polygon\u2019s co-founders.\n\nJordi Baylina, technical lead of Polygon Hermez zkEVM, spoke to Cointelegraph ahead of the start of EthCC in France. With builders from across the Ethereum ecosystem converging on Paris, zero-knowledge proof (ZK-proof) scaling tools are set to be a major focal point.\n\nPolygon\u2019s zkEVM uses ZK-proofs to reduce transaction costs and increase the throughput of the Ethereum network, while taking advantage of the security and finality of the layer-1 blockchain.\n\nZK-proofs have proved to be an important scaling tool for the Ethereum ecosystem. The technology allows protocols like Polygon\u2019s zkEVM to handle transaction computations off-chain before providing a resource-lite proof to the Ethereum mainnet without revealing any of the associated data.\n\nRelated: Ethereum scaling protocols drive zero-knowledge proof use in 2023\n\nBaylina, who is at the helm of Polygon\u2019s zkEVM, says the breadth of development being done with ZK technology has been hugely beneficial to the wider Ethereum ecosystem:\n\n\u201cHaving different projects adds a lot of experience, and it\u2019s also a way to test different approaches, ways of handling things or solving things.\u201d\n\nBaylina added that various projects emulate good advances and try to make them better, while failings act as a learning for all ZK-based projects in the space.\n\nPolygon zkEVM unique addresses. Source: Polygon zkEVM\n\nPolygon zkEVM is live on mainnet, and the network is closing in on 250,000 unique active addresses. Its daily active Polygon zkEVM addresses are also trending upward, with both metrics suggesting that user adoption is growing.\n\nRelated: ConsenSys launches Linea zkEVM to further scale Ethereum\n\nMeanwhile, Baylina highlighted the number of applications that are building on Polygon zkEVM as the most important metric for his team. This, in turn, leads to a wealth of information and feedback from developers, which is shaping changes to the protocol:\n\n\u201cHearing from developers the issues that they have, if they notice something that can be improved or the quality of the tooling that they have on top of that for me, these are the real metrics we are working hard on.\u201d\n\nBaylina provided a working example where developers had identified issues with timestamps that were critical for the operation of decentralized finance oracles. Bayina\u2019s team found a workaround solution while a long-term fix was being developed. Nevertheless, the input from builders is helping improve the protocol as more join the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cImportant projects are coming to the network, and we are getting a lot of experience and knowledge on the needs of different applications.\u201d\n\nPolygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal previously told Cointelegraph that Polygon\u2019s zkEVM is the \u201choly grail of Ethereum scaling,\u201d allowing the protocol to submit proofs to the Ethereum mainnet without the layer-1 blockchain having to rerun computations.\n\nThe technology is envisioned to drastically scale Ethereum, allowing developers to build decentralized applications while being unencumbered by the base blockchain\u2019s network performance.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

The XRP blockchain is very popular for its scalable and efficient cross-border transactions.\n\nAs a result, the likes of Bank of America, Santander Bank, Standard Chartered, PNC, Siam Commercial Bank, and the Colombia Central Bank are all using the XRP blockchain.\n\nMany crypto experts expect that the XRP case will be concluded in the third quarter. As a result, the price of XRP is expected to increase. Now trading at $0.474, many analysts believe XRP can rally to $1.5 when the case is concluded.\n\nToncoin (TON) Launches Encrypted Messaging Solution, Price Rally Coming?\n\nThe Open Network, popularly known as Toncoin , has been one of the more successful crypto projects thanks to its ties with the Telegram messenger. While Toncoin has been streamlining, the project is looking to integrate even more privacy into the project. Recently, the Toncoin team announced the launch of an on-chain encrypted messaging solution.\n\nThe new feature will add an extra layer of privacy for Toncoin users and their transaction details. In June, Toncoin also reduced its circulating supply by burning 50% of its network fees, making the crypto very bullish.

        "content": "The Ethereum Killers: a Comparative Look at Cardano (ADA), VC Spectra (SPCT), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH)\n\nThe crypto market witnesses a fierce battle for profitability among Cardano (ADA), VC Spectra (SPCT), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). While Cardano (ADA) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) exhibit potential for an uptrend, VC Spectra (SPCT) brings a fresh perspective with its unique and sustainable investment opportunities.\n\nThis begs the question: Can VC Spectra (SPCT) outpace Cardano (ADA) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH)? Stay tuned to find out!\n\nBUY SPCT TOKENS NOW\n\nRallying Towards Success: Cardano (ADA) Shows Promising Signs of a Bull Run\n\nThe recent positive ruling in Ripple's XRP notably impacted various cryptocurrencies, including Cardano (ADA). Previously entangled in legal battles with the SEC, Cardano (ADA) witnessed substantial price increases as market sentiment turned bullish. In light of this ruling, Cardano\u2019s (ADA) trading volume jumped by 767.85%, with its price surging to $0.36 from $0.27, indicating a 44.44% spike over the past week.\n\nFurthermore, Cardano (ADA) aims to enhance its network capabilities and scalability. Cardano\u2019s (ADA) co-founder, Charles Hoskinson, unveiled Intersect to amplify community participation in Cardano\u2019s (ADA) governance and development. Intersect also empowers members to contribute to Cardano's (ADA) evolution and innovation.\n\nBy uniting Cardano (ADA) users, Intersect strives to establish a resilient, accountable, and forward-thinking ecosystem driven by community input.\n\nAs Cardano (ADA) bolsters its network, experts indicate Cardano\u2019s (ADA) price can increase from $0.36 to $0.54, translating to a 50% value surge in the coming weeks.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) Benefits from Recent XRP Court Case\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) experienced a massive upward trend over the past week, increasing by 6.6% from $263.1 to $280.4. Analysts indicate Bitcoin Cash\u2019s (BCH) bullish momentum is linked to the recent XRP ruling. The court's decision challenges the SEC's assertion that there is no need for additional guidance on applying securities law to digital assets, such as XRP and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\n\nOn the other hand, Binance US had a temporary disruption in BCH withdrawals due to a technical issue in the deposit transfer system, causing a brief shortage of BCH in the hot wallet.\n\nIn a testament to its technological prowess, the Binance US technical team restored Bitcoin Cash (BCH) deposit and withdrawal processes across all networks in just three days. The temporary suspension of withdrawals was solely due to technical difficulties and not indicative of any liquidity issues. Moreover, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) assured users of asset safety, backed by a 1:1 reserve for every token deposited or withdrawn.\n\nWith its robust security measures and commitment to user protection, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is projected to experience a price increase from $280.1 to $293.7 in the coming months, translating to a 4.86% surge.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) is the New Powerhouse\n\nAs we keep tabs on Cardano (ADA) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), it\u2019s important to explore VC Specra\u2019s (SPCT) unique proposition and real-life utility. VC Spectra (SPCT) is an emerging decentralized hedge fund that allows people to invest in promising blockchain companies.\n\nThanks to VC Spectra (SPCT)'s rigorous selection procedure, investors can access pre-ICOs and diversified portfolios exclusively. VC Spectra (SPCT) also rewards its esteemed investors with buybacks and quarterly dividends, which are influenced by their investment performance.\n\nMoreover, VC Spectra's native token (SPCT) adherers to the BRC-20 standard, enabling seamless exchanges, decentralized trading, and asset management on the Spectra platform. SPCT is built on the Bitcoin blockchain and adopts a deflationary model with a burn mechanism that reduces token circulation over time, increasing VC Spectra's (SPCT) value.\n\nVC Spectra's (SPCT) public presale is in its initial stages, with its token valued at $0.008. Analysts indicate VC Spectra (SPCT) can skyrocket to $0.08 once it hits the exchanges, marking a 10x surge. Undoubtedly, VC Spectra (SPCT) can outpace Cardano (ADA) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\n\nLearn more about the VC Spectra presale here:\n\nPresale: https://invest.vcspectra.io/login\n\nWebsite: https://vcspectra.io/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/spectravcfund\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/VCSpectra\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article.

Let\u2019s look at the five major sectors blockchain technology is affecting.\n\n1. Banking Pretend you send $100 to your friend through a conventional bank. The bank charges you a $10 fee, so, in fact, you\u2019re only sending her $90. If she\u2019s overseas, she\u2019ll get even less because of transfer rates and other hidden fees involved. Overall, the process is time-consuming and expensive \u2013 and isn\u2019t guaranteed to be 100% secure. Blockchain, on the other hand, disrupts the commercial banking system by providing a peer-to-peer payment system with high security and low fees. No central authority exists, so you don\u2019t have to pay one. How cool is that? This eliminates the need for a third party to make a transaction using a cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin or one of the many others. Your transaction to your friend is recorded in a ledger that is viewed and reviewable by any of the cryptocurrency users \u2013 giving you true autonomy over your transaction. For example, a cryptocurrency application called Abra provides peer-to-peer money transfers. With Abra, users can store, transfer, and receive digital money on their PCs, tablets or smartphones. A recipient can withdraw cash via an Abra teller. Users don\u2019t need to have a bank account! As you can see, then, the use of cryptocurrencies instead of banks truly disrupts the personal finance market, endangering the latter \u2013 as it should be. Why pay fees and fear safety when blockchain can complete transactions quickly, freely, and without worry?\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program 2. Cybersecurity Cyberattacks are the top threat to our digital world. Look what happened to our data when Equifax announced its gigantic data breach in 2017 that affected 143 million consumers \u2013 we went crazy. Blockchain technology can end such nightmares. It can secure our data against unauthorized access and tampering. Because blockchain is a decentralized system, it\u2019s ideal for environments where high security is involved. Here, all the information stored on a bitcoin or other blockchain network is verified and encrypted using a cryptographic algorithm \u2013 which leads to no SINGLE point of entry for a wide-scale attack. Also, you can easily identify malicious data attacks with blockchain due to peer-to-peer connections, where data cannot be altered or tampered. And, by eliminating a central authority, blockchain provides a secure and transparent way of recording transactions without disclosing private information to anyone. One example of a company successfully using cybersecurity this way is Guardtime. Because of its success, we expect that many companies will follow, further disrupting this industry, too.\n\n3. Supply Chain Management Blockchain technology can trace all the steps of a supply chain, so that, let\u2019s say, you placed an order for food, had the food delivered, and found the food disgusting. The owner of the company from whom you ordered it could go back through his blockchain ledger and find out where in the supply chain the order went wrong to displease you. For example, he can go from the farmer to the producer, to the distributor, to the retailer, then to you, the purchaser. In other words, in supply chain management, blockchain provides permanent transparency and validation of transactions shared by multiple supply chain partners. All transactions are permanent and verifiable, making it easy for an owner or a customer to view each record. It can be used for any type of verification \u2013 for example, seafood verification, where it can track the seafood from ocean to market. The Pacific Tuna Project uses blockchain to manage fishing information, exporting/importing details, and purchasing details to track tuna fishing. This prevents illegal fishing. In other words, using blockchain for supply chain management work allows you to fish for the information you need and reel in the right answers every time.

Healthcare Let\u2019s face it. Today, myriad problems exist in the storage of people\u2019s health data. Anyone can have access to this very private information because it is all contained in centrally located files. When someone asks someone else for a person\u2019s information, it can take hours for that person to locate the right file, offering opportunities for data breaches, theft or losses. That\u2019s why blockchain technology in this industry is so important. Blockchain technology here eliminates the need for a central authority and enables rapid access to data. Here, each block is connected to another block and distributed across the blockchain nodes, making it difficult for a hacker to corrupt the data. Keeping personal medical file information private is of the utmost concern, so blockchain technology makes the most sense, no? Another healthcare concern revolves around counterfeit medication and blockchain technology can control this, too. The problem is that, often, counterfeit medications are difficult to distinguish from real ones. Blockchain technology solves this problem by using supply chain management protocols where the medicine provenance can be traced. United Healthcare has improved its privacy, security, and interoperability of medical records using blockchain technology. It\u2019s seen its operations improve dramatically as a result. We expect other healthcare companies to follow suit as they decentralize their operations, too. Basics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\n5. Government Blockchain technology can end voter fraud. In a traditional voting process, most voters stand in line to cast votes or send in mail votes. Then, the votes must be counted by a local authority. Online voting is possible in this scenario, too, but as with all other industries we\u2019ve discussed, because a central authority is used, problems of fraud arise. Using blockchain technology thus becomes the wisest choice. Here, people can vote online easily without revealing their identities. Using blockchain, officials can count votes with absolute accuracy, knowing that each ID can be attributed to only one vote. Fraud cannot occur because it is next to impossible with blockchain technology. And, once a vote is added to a ledger, it cannot be changed or erased. One blockchain voting platform is MiVote, a token-based platform like a digital ballot box. Voters vote through a smartphone and their votes are registered into a blockchain ledger. Safe, secure, reliable. Other applications for government include digital asset registries, wherein the fast and secure registry of an asset such as a car, home or other property is needed; notary services, where a blockchain record can better verify the seal\u2019s authenticity; and taxes, in which blockchain technology can make it easier to enable quicker tax payments, lower rates of tax fraud and have faster, easier audits. Overall, blockchain can increase transparency and security in governmental bodies. In fact, by 2020, Dubai wants to become 100% reliant on blockchain technology for all its governmental functions, making all its government services available on the blockchain. As you can see, then, these are five large industries the blockchain is already disrupting. Here are a few more where its influence is growing. A Few More Because blockchain technology never relies on a centralized authority, it will also disrupt these industries:\n\nInsurance With blockchain technology\u2019s decentralized system, insurers can identify false claims and prevent forgeries.\n\nTransportation Utilizing blockchain technology enables traceability in the transportation industry, where the shipment of goods can be easily tracked.\n\nCloud Storage Storj is a decentralized blockchain cloud storage system. By eliminating servers, Storj uses blockchain to store data in the cloud. With high speed and low cost, users can earn money by sharing their storage space on Storj."

        "title": "NFTs, Where did the buyers go? - Forkast News",
        "content": "Huge supply, high prices, similar products, little innovation, and a straight-up lack of liquidity. You could pick any of the above as reasons for the continued struggles of the non-fungible token (NFT) market. In the past, traders have typically not let these stop them from buying NFTs, but now, one in particular has become an issue. Liquidity is the elephant in the room and while there are plenty of people holding Ether in their wallets, they seem to have tightened their belts this year.\n\nLet\u2019s start by looking at how liquidity has affected this week\u2019s global trading numbers compared to last week.\n\nSource: CryptoSlam\n\nMeasuring liquidity is tricky, but there are some ways to gain insight into traders\u2019 holdings. Glassnode data shows the number of Ethereum wallets holding 1 Ether or more, and from that we see the number has remained nearly stagnant in 2023, following two years of \u201cup only.\u201d\n\nIf you didn\u2019t have more than 1 ETH before this year, you\u2019re probably not going to be holding it now, and if Ethereum holdings aren\u2019t growing that could be a sign that NFTs aren\u2019t selling. Obviously not everyone holding Ether is trading NFTs, but there\u2019s certainly a correlation here.\n\nAt a glance, we can also see that the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s utilization for NFT primary sales has fallen to 2021 levels. This is just another indicator of the NFT market losing its appeal as traders fail to find profits and are no longer willing to support new mints.\n\nIn the NFT market, transactions are declining and buyers are drying up, highlighted this past Sunday with just 194,689 total global NFT transactions. This is the lowest single day of global NFT trading volume since December 24, 2022, when we saw 156,344 total global transactions.\n\nFocusing on Ethereum trading we see 13,994 total transactions on Sunday, which is the lowest in almost two years. You have to look all the way back to July 24, 2021 to find a lower daily number when we saw 13,560 transactions.\n\nUnique buyers still hasn\u2019t reached a yearly low point, but we have only dipped below 10,000 unique buyers a few times this year. July 2021 is the last period of time with sustained buyers around that level, and that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m expecting to see over the next few months.\n\nAugust through December is typically the slowest part of the year for NFT sales, with trading action slowing down the further we get in the calendar year. With the market about to enter that period again, it\u2019s time to brace for potentially a very rough time in NFTs.\n\nNone of this is concerning for collectors and long term holders. NFT buyers are still here and watching, and are probably smarter than given credit for. I suspect they\u2019re on the sidelines, holding their ETH tightly waiting for a sign that it\u2019s time to buy again. It probably won\u2019t be this year, and maybe not even next, but watch the crypto markets. That\u2019s where we\u2019ll see a catalyst for mass adoption to crypto, and after that it will be time for these buyers to come back to NFTs.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at what\u2019s moving the charts during this slow time for NFTs.\n\nPeep the charts\n\nBitcoin\u2019s $FRAM still can\u2019t be dethroned with its US$8 million in seven day volume.\n\nstill can\u2019t be dethroned with its US$8 million in seven day volume.

In this guide you\u2019ll learn about what a wallet is, the different types, and how they might be used in future.\n\nA cryptocurrency wallet is a piece of software that stores your public and private keys. More on keys below.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt also allows you to send and receive digital currencies and monitor your balance. It\u2019s like a mini bank, just for you. What\u2019s more, you can have as many as you like, and move currencies between them.\n\nWhat are keys?\n\nWhen it comes to sending and receiving cryptocurrencies, you need a set of keys: one public, one private. These are typically 64-digit numbers. They are tied to each other - and you need both in order to send and receive currency on the network.\n\nDid you know?\n\nFun fact: the network can tell your public and private keys are connected without having to know what your private key is. Clever, huh?\n\n\n\nYour Public Key is what you share with your sender/recipient. You can share this key with as many people as you like.\n\nYour Private Key is the key you keep to yourself. This is connected to your public key using cryptography and acts as a digital signature for the transaction.\n\nIn order for you to access the information sent to you, you need both keys.\n\nNow we can talk about the different types of wallet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDesktop wallets\n\nThese run on your computer, and can only be accessed on the computer you downloaded it on. If the computer is connected to the internet, these are referred to as hot wallets. This means they could be at risk if your computer gets hacked.\n\nMobile wallets\n\nThese are smaller, \u2018lighter\u2019 versions of their desktop cousins. Some mobile wallets only cater for certain currencies, but there are lots more currencies being added. You can download these from app stores.\n\nHardware wallets\n\nHardware wallets are physical wallets that you store somewhere safe. Many look like USB sticks and allow you to detach your private keys from the internet and keep them somewhere safe.\n\nPaper wallets\n\nGoing old school! You take your private key and physically write or print it out on a piece of paper and store it someplace safe, like a safe!\n\nThe future\n\nThe technology wallets and digital keys are built on has the potential to be used for all kinds of things.

        "content": "A crypto startup, Ethena, has recently secured $6 million in seed funding for its innovation stablecoin project. This funding round was led by Dragonfly, underscoring the increasing support for Ethena\u2019s venture.\n\nThe importance of this milestone stems from Ethena\u2019s unique approach to its stablecoin, called USDe.\n\nUnlike other stablecoins projects, Ethena has learned from the challenges faced by projects like Terra and has revised a fresh method to ensure that USDe maintains its peg to the US dollar.\n\nEthena\u2019s stablecoin achieves stability by using collateral provided by users and hedging price exposure through shorting Ethereum perpetual swaps.\n\nBy holding the equivalent amount of staked ETH and perpetual swaps, Ethena ensures that gains and losses from either asset effectively balance each other out.\n\nIn addition to the stablecoin, Ethena is also developing a digitally native internet savings bond denominated in USD. This bond generates yield by combining staked ETH and swapping margins, offering investors an opportunity to earn passive income.\n\nEthena aims to differentiate itself from previous attempts at building algorithmic stablecoin, such as Terra, which faced significant challenges and deviated from its peg to the US dollar.\n\nAdditionally, Ethena sets itself apart from established stablecoin leaders like USDC and USDT, which primarily rely on fiat-based assets like treasuries for backing.\n\nWhile this traditional approach is considered safer by many investors, it remains closely connected to the existing banking system.\n\nGuy Young, the founder of Ethena, emphasized that \u201cIn crypto, you\u2019re trying to create a parallel financial system, but the most important financial instrument in the entire space (the stablecoin) is still completely tethered to the existing system.\u201d\n\nThe inspiration for the creation of USDe came from a written piece by Hayes, which discussed the potential of a stablecoin supported by crypto derivatives, following the collapse of Terra.\n\nMoving forward, Ethena has set its sights on fully launching its stablecoin and bond asset in the upcoming months, following the completion of the testnet phase in the third quarter."

        "content": "Blockchain-focused company Neon Labs announced on Monday the mainnet launch of its Neon Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on the layer-1 blockchain network Solana. The integration will allow Ethereum developers to seamlessly deploy their projects on the Solana network.\n\nNeon EVM Onboards Ethereum-based Projects\n\nEthereum Virtual Machine is a program that allows developers to create smart contract-enabled decentralized applications (dApps) and deploy them on compatible platforms. Without an EVM, a project wanting to deploy Ethereum-based projects on other blockchains will tweak the code to fit the new ecosystem.\n\nHowever, the EVM solution allows developers to deploy projects on other EVM-compatible blockchains.\n\nNeon EVM comes as an EVM solution that blurs the gap between the Ethereum and Solana networks. The development is the first of its kind on the Solana mainnet. The team noted in its latest announcement that there are necessary tools for Ethereum developers to use.\n\nAmong the stated benefits of transitioning to the Solana network is the reduction of operational costs for their dApps. Another is the parallel execution of transactions featured on Solana.\n\nNeon Labs believes the EVM solution will integrate with Solana\u2019s high throughput. However, Solana\u2019s position as the fastest EVM-compatible blockchain remains a debate among market players as Neon EVM continues to undergo extensive tests.\n\n\u201cWe are very excited to see Neon EVM live on Solana Mainnet. Once we repeat these tests in production, we will present the figures based on real-world data,\u201d Neon Foundation\u2019s director, Maina Guryeva, said.\n\nSeven Months Wait\n\nIn November 2022, Neon Labs announced that the EVM solution would be launched in December by the Neon Foundation, a non-profit organization designed to support the Neon ecosystem.\n\nDue to the \u201cchallenging market conditions\u201d at the expected launch time, the project shifted the EVM solution\u2019s deployment date. The new date was undeclared at the time. With the mainnet finally launched, Ethereum-based projects like Aave and Curve Finance will make their way to the Solana mainnet through Neon EVM.\n\nYour crypto deserves the best security.

With the introduction of Solang, Solana Labs aims to make the Solana ecosystem more accessible to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) developers.\n\nSolana and Ethereum: the Need for Solidity Compatibility\n\nThis exciting development marks a significant step towards bridging the gap between the two blockchain ecosystems, allowing developers to build Solidity-based smart contracts on Solana\u2019s network.\n\nadvertisement\n\nTraditionally, Solana development has relied heavily on computer languages such as Rust or C to create smart contracts. However, with the introduction of Solang, Solana Labs is expanding the platform\u2019s capabilities and appealing to a broader range of developers familiar with Solidity.\n\nBy leveraging Solidity, the most widely used language in Ethereum (ETH), Solana is enabling Ethereum developers to seamlessly transition to the Solana ecosystem, bringing their expertise and projects to a high-performance blockchain with unparalleled scalability.\n\nAdditionally, the team noted that Solana has also expanded its developer reach with a multilingual ecosystem. The availability of multiple programming languages for building on Solana attracts developers with diverse skill sets, fostering innovation and growth within the Solana ecosystem.\n\nIn the past year, the introduction of Seahorse enabled developers to write Solana smart contracts in Python, the world\u2019s most popular programming language. Today\u2019s announcement builds upon this progress, continuing the mission to broaden the scope and accessibility of the Solana ecosystem.\n\nSolang Vs EVM\n\nAccording to the announcement, Solang enables developers to call other Solana smart contracts directly from their Solidity code. This feature promotes seamless integration and interoperability within the Solana ecosystem, allowing developers to leverage existing contracts and build complex decentralized applications with ease.\n\nAdditionally, Solang provides support for Solana SPL (Solana Program Library) tokens. Developers can create and interact with SPL tokens, which are native to the Solana blockchain, through their Solidity-based smart contracts.\n\nAlso, Solang integrates seamlessly with Anchor, a framework for building Solana smart contracts. Anchor simplifies the development process by providing high-level abstractions and tooling for Solana contract development. Overall, these features help to grow the Solana ecosystem by giving developers more flexibility and options for developing novel decentralized applications and services."

        "content": "zkSync Era has rolled out an upgrade dubbed Boojum.\n\nWith the upgrade, the network is transitioning to a STARK-based prover.\n\nThe transition has serious implications for zkSync Era\u2019s hyperchains vision and decentralization.\n\nThe race to develop the optimal Ethereum scaling solution is heating up. In recent weeks, several Layer-2 solutions have teased or launched upgrades.\n\nzkSync Era, a zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM), is the latest to release an upgrade. The recent upgrade, among other benefits, promises to encourage decentralization and cut down transaction costs.\n\n\u201cThe Most Fearsome Snark\u201d\n\nIn a long-form tweet on Monday, July 17, Matter Labs, the primary development team behind the zkSync Era protocol, announced the Boojum upgrade. Inspired by Lewis Carroll\u2019s \u201cThe Hunting of the Snark\u201d poem, the upgrade\u2019s name refers to \u201cthe most fearsome kind of snark.\u201d\n\nSay hello to Boojum \ud83d\udc4b: zkSync Era\u2019s new high-performance proof system for radical decentralization. Boojum is an upgrade that will transition zkSync Era to a STARK-powered proof system, providing world-class performance on consumer-grade hardware.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Learn more:\u2026 pic.twitter.com/1GrwJ5Y07A \u2014 zkSync \u220e (@zksync) July 17, 2023\n\nDespite this naming choice, it is worth noting that Boojum represents the network\u2019s transition from a SNARK-based proving system to a STARK-based system.\n\nThe Impact\n\nMatter Labs explains that while its current proving system is still functional, it can not scale for the volume expected in zkSync Era\u2019s hyperchains roadmap. The firm asserted that Boojum was better suited for zkSync Era\u2019s sequencer, capable of processing 100 transactions per second.\n\nAnother significant impact of the Boojum upgrade is that it significantly reduces the hardware requirement for proof generation. While the SNARK-based system requires high-end graphic processing units boasting at least 80 GB of RAM, the STARK-based system only requires GPUs with 16 GB of RAM. Additionally, Matter Labs reveals that central processing unit provers with 64 GB of RAM can also be used.\n\nAs highlighted by the team, this drastic reduction allows more users to be involved in maintaining the network, boosting decentralization. The less complex proving process also allows for cheaper transaction fees.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the Boojum upgrade, the zkSync Era network has processed an average of 11.32 TPS, more TPS than Ethereum and every other Ethereum Layer 2 solution, per data from L2Beat at the time of writing.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nzkSync Era\u2019s TVL has been on a steady decline since July 3, falling from over $735 million to $554 million at the time of writing, per data from L2Beat .\n\nThe bulk of the network\u2019s activity has been attributed to airdrop farming.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nzkSync Era is one of Ethereum\u2019s most popular scaling solutions. The continued dedication to improvements highlights the growing competitiveness within Ethereum\u2019s Layer-2 ecosystem.\n\nRead this to learn more about zkSync Era\u2019s growing popularity:\n\nzkSync Era Closes in on Ethereum in Transactions Per Second as TVL Hits Record\n\nIs trouble brewing for Binance?

        "title": "What\u2019s The Minimum Amount of ETH You Can Buy? - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "If you\u2019re new to the world of cryptocurrency investing, you might be wondering if Ethereum is a good investment. Investing in ETH can pay off big time, but it carries some degree of risk.\n\nA responsible approach is key to a successful trading experience because it protects you from undesired outcomes and unexpected market events.\n\nEthereum remains one of the strongest players in the field, with a market cap of $214.40B USD, offering distinct advantages like smart contracts, NFTs, and the metaverse. At present, you can buy Ethereum with credit card after creating and verifying your account.\n\nTo buy Ethereum, all you have to do is to enter the symbol of Eth in your crypto exchange\u2019s \u201cbuy\u201d field and select the amount you want to buy. It doesn\u2019t take thousands of dollars to invest in Ethereum. In case you didn\u2019t know, ETH is made up of smaller units known as Wei, meaning you can buy small amounts of Ethereum. Maybe you don\u2019t have enough money in your account for a full coin. In that case, you can purchase a fractional share of ETH \u2013 a Wei amounts to 0.000000000000000001 ETH. Wei isn\u2019t the only measure of value of small amounts of Ethereum. The most commonly used demonization when discussing ETH transactions is the Gwei, equivalent to 1 million Wei; it\u2019s used to pay for gas fees.\n\nThe Easiest Way to Buy ETH Is Via a Centralized Exchange\n\nWhether you\u2019re looking to buy Ethereum or parts of an ETH coin, the simplest way to go about it is via an online exchange. A cryptocurrency exchange is a platform offered to traders and investors to execute transactions in a networked environment. You can buy, sell, and exchange digital assets with low fees. In real-world terms, $1,782.62 is a lot of money, so if you want to get involved in the global network, buy fractions of Ethereum. A centralized exchange offers various payment methods, including bank transfers, credit/debit cards, PayPal, and so forth. Attention must be paid to the fact that each platform has different stipulations regarding credit card use. If your credit card is MasterCard, there\u2019s a chance it won\u2019t be accepted.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to do some research on the crypto exchange\u2019s history, team, vision, and goals, not to mention its community and social media presence. The preferred currency is the US dollar, even if most centralized exchanges accept the euro; a small number of crypto exchanges accept the British pound sterling and Japanese yen. To create an account, you must provide some basic information, such as your name, email address, date of birth, and country of residence. Once your account is verified, you can start depositing funds and trading cryptocurrencies. Instant sign-up is possible on some exchanges, while others may take some time to get you verified.\n\nYou Can Interact with Defi Apps on The Ethereum Blockchain\n\nDeFi, short for decentralized finance, is based on secure distributed ledgers identical to those used by cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. DeFi applications don\u2019t rely on a central computer to send and receive information, having many use cases, of which mention can be made of predictions markets, lending, games, etc. DeFi protocols are automated and executed via smart contracts, which run when predetermined conditions are met, eliminating the need for intermediaries and enhancing efficiency. You\u2019ll need less than 1 ETH to pay for gas fees for popular dApps, so convert your fiat to crypto without delay.\n\nDue to decentralization, there\u2019s no powerful company or government body to influence your actions, but you need to purchase or earn its utility token. The Ethereum blockchain currently leads the pack as the ideal platform to build dApps as a result of the maturity of its ecosystem. Threat actors can\u2019t tamper with the records on the blockchain, developers can create cryptographic tokens by coding smart contracts, and various tools and resources are available (Solidity, Vyper, Remix IDE). dApps can be accessed from a mobile device, as most of them have a responsive user interface and are easy to access. Just so you know, you\u2019ll need a Web3 browser and a tool like MetaMask.\n\nWhere Will You Store Your Newly Acquired ETH?\n\nThe most straightforward approach to storing Ethereum or fractions of ETH is an externally owned account, which is nothing more than an asymmetric key pair (a public key and a private key). Ethereum tokens can be stored in a smart contract that is associated with a code and, once deployed on the blockchain, executes the function for which it\u2019s written. Smart contracts can act as wallets and store ETH, but they need a payable function; you can send what you want and the rest is stored in the contract. The records are stored on the blockchain, and you\u2019ll interact only with the blockchain to enable transactions.\n\nAn alternative to privately-owned wallets is the custodial wallet. Centralized exchanges like Binance create a wallet for you, so you can manage your funds directly from the web browser. You trust the service provider to securely store your coins and implement strong security measures to prevent unauthorized measures. Approximately 95% of the digital assets are stored in cold storage, and the crypto exchange goes beyond standard precautions to ensure everything is alright. By contrast, a non-custodial wallet enables the user to retain full control of their holdings, so they can manage their private key and handle transactions.\n\nWrapping It Up\n\nEthereum has proved to be a good investment, but it\u2019s not for the faint of heart. Officially, Ethereum has a minimum fractional number called a Wei, facilitating transactional operations on the blockchain network. Binance has a minimum of 0.001 ETH for any trade. In the technical documents, there are other denominations of Ethereum, such as Gwei, Kwei, Mwei, etc. Figure out what sum of money you want to invest and split up the investment into several chunks. The Ethereum wallet ecosystem has limited options right now, so be wise in choosing one if you want your funds to be safe. A hardware wallet will definitely cost you a lot more.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "content": "As Ethereum (ETH) moves to consolidate the gains from previous days and weeks, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization might be in for a further decline before bullish continuation, giving interested investors an opportunity to accumulate it in time.\n\nIndeed, as crypto market analyst Crypto Tony noted, Ethereum has taken the upper boundary liquidity, and for now, \u201cwe roll over and grab the lower liquidity sitting around $1,780,\u201d taking into account the chart pattern analysis he shared in a tweet on July 18.\n\nHaving said that, according to the expert\u2019s observations illustrated in the chart, this crypto asset will return to its bullish path, which is why he believes that the $1,780 level might be the ideal time to begin accumulating Ethereum.\n\nEthereum price action analysis. Source: Crypto Tony\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nIn the meantime, the price of Ethereum currently stands at $1,892.19, indicating a decline of 0.75% in the last 24 hours but still holding on to the 1.25% increase over the previous seven days and a 9.18% gain across the last month, according to the data retrieved on July 18.\n\nEthereum 24-hour price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nGenerally speaking, the price of Ethereum still has a long way from its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878.26 it had reached in November 202. However, if many crypto experts and investors\u2019 expectations are correct, it could, indeed, rise significantly in the following weeks or months.\n\nEarlier, pseudonymous crypto trading analyst Altcoin Sherpa shared a chart pattern analysis and prediction for the price of Ethereum, arguing it might rise to as near as $3,000 in late 2023 before pulling back again, as Finbold reported on July 12.\n\nOne of the things that could help this advance is the positive crypto investor sentiment as they turn their attention away from stablecoins and to Ethereum and Bitcoin (BTC), as well as Elon Musk\u2019s support of optimistic crypto prognoses for the future.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, took the stage at the Ethereum Community Conference (ETHCC) (1) in Paris to present his vision of account abstraction for the Ethereum network. This groundbreaking concept aims to revolutionize the way smart contracts interact with each other and enable more flexible and efficient development on the Ethereum platform. In this article, we delve into Buterin's account abstraction proposal and its potential implications for Ethereum's future.\n\nAccount Abstraction: Enhancing Smart Contract Interactions\n\nAccount abstraction represents a paradigm shift in the Ethereum ecosystem, offering a new approach to smart contract development and interaction. By decoupling the control of contract execution from the underlying address, account abstraction allows contracts to act as autonomous agents, making decisions and interacting with other contracts more seamlessly. Buterin's presentation at ETHCC Paris showcased the transformative potential of this concept.\n\nEnabling Flexibility and Efficiency in Ethereum Development\n\nWith account abstraction, developers can achieve greater flexibility and efficiency when building complex decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum network. This concept opens up possibilities for advanced use cases such as meta transactions, cross-contract communication, and composability of smart contracts. By simplifying contract interactions and reducing gas costs, account abstraction paves the way for a more scalable and user-friendly Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nImplications for Ethereum's Future\n\nButerin's account abstraction vision holds significant implications for the future of Ethereum. By enabling more complex and modular smart contract architectures, Ethereum can attract a broader range of developers and facilitate the creation of innovative DApps. As the Ethereum community explores the technical feasibility and potential challenges of implementing account abstraction, its adoption could shape the evolution of the Ethereum protocol and solidify its position as a leading blockchain platform."

        "content": "Solana announced on its official Twitter handle on July 19, 2023 the launch of Solang, a powerful compiler aimed at facilitating the integration of Ethereum developers into the Solana ecosystem.\n\nWith Solang, developers proficient in Ethereum\u2019s Solidity programming language and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can now create and deploy smart contracts on the energy-efficient Solana network, significantly expanding the platform\u2019s potential developer base and fostering compatibility between the two blockchain giants.\n\nEnhancing Solidity Compatibility On The Solana Network\n\nSolana Labs\u2019 release of the Solang compiler marks a significant milestone in the realm of blockchain development. Prior to this, Solana\u2019s smart contracts were predominantly written in Rust or C languages, which presented a barrier for Ethereum developers accustomed to Solidity. Solang\u2019s introduction changes the game by offering a smooth transition for Ethereum developers seeking to explore the Solana network.\n\nWith Solang\u2019s support for Ethereum Solidity 0.8 and native integration with Solana SPL tokens, developers can now leverage familiar tools while enjoying access to the inherent advantages of the Solana ecosystem. Additionally, Solang enables developers to call other Solana smart contracts, expanding the possibilities for decentralized applications on the network.\n\nWhile Solang and Neon EVM share the common goal of onboarding Ethereum developers to Solana, they are considered complementary approaches rather than direct competitors. Solang acts as a bridge between EVM developers and the Solana ecosystem, facilitating a smooth transition by providing Solidity compatibility.\n\nSOL price sitting at $25 | Source: SOLUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIn a tweet, Austin Federa, Solana\u2019s Head of Strategy, likened the relationship between Neon EVN and Solang to running a program built for Windows on a Mac, emphasizing their collaborative efforts in embracing Ethereum developers. Neon EVM, on the other hand, adds a smart contract layer on top of Solana, enabling the deployment of EVM code and allowing Ethereum applications to leverage Solana\u2019s native features, such as parallel transaction execution.\n\nImpact On Ecosystem And SOL\u2019s Performance\n\nAs Solana Labs continues its efforts to expand its ecosystem by introducing innovative tools like Solang and Neon EVM, the performance of its native cryptocurrency, SOL, has seen substantial improvement.\n\nIn just one month, SOL\u2019s trading price leaped from $16 to over $25, a testament to the growing interest and confidence in the Solana network.\n\nThe introduction of Solang and Neon EVM has played a pivotal role in strengthening the network\u2019s appeal to developers and investors alike, highlighting Solana\u2019s commitment to attracting Ethereum developers and fostering compatibility between the two prominent blockchain ecosystems.\n\nFeatured image from Guarda Wallet, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "DISCLAIMER: This article is a SPONSORED Press Release and does not constitute Finbold's editorial content nor undergo monitoring. Crypto assets/products involve significant risks. Do not invest unless you are prepared to lose your entire investment. For a full disclaimer, please click here.\n\nCoinbase recently imposed limitations on Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) staking operations within four US states: California, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Wisconsin. Meanwhile, VC Spectra (SPCT) has made headlines with its global expansion, targeting promising blockchain and technology startups.\n\nLet\u2019s delve into how the actions of Coinbase will affect Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), as well as VC Spectra\u2019s (SPCT) unique proposition.\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum (ETH): The Aftermath of Restricted Staking\n\nCoinbase\u2019s restrictions on Ethereum (ETH) staking have significant implications for the cryptocurrency community and the overall Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem.\n\nFirst, the restrictions reduce the options available to investors looking to stake their Ethereum (ETH) holdings and earn rewards through the staking process.\n\nMoreover, there could be a reduction in liquidity for Ethereum (ETH) staking on the Coinbase platform. As a result, there may be a decline in staking activity and a significant reduction in ETH tokens being locked in the staking process.\n\nUltimately, the restrictions will cause a shift in investor behavior as many are likely to seek alternative platforms or methods to stake their tokens.\n\nDue to the recent developments, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price plunged by 5.1% in the past four days, from $2,020 to $1,915. According to experts, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price may plunge by another 4.6% in the coming weeks, from $1,915 to $1,826.\n\nUncovering the Effects: Solana (SOL) Contemplates Restricted Staking\u2019s Aftermath\n\nJust like with Ethereum, Coinbase\u2019s restrictions will affect the Solana (SOL) ecosystem and the crypto world in general.\n\nGranted, Coinbase\u2019s decision to restrict Solana (SOL) staking in specific states likely stems from regulatory considerations. By imposing these limitations, Coinbase aims to ensure compliance with local regulations, mitigating potential legal risks. However, this move highlights the challenges faced by cryptocurrency exchanges while navigating the complex regulatory environment.\n\nFor Solana (SOL), the limitations could also indicate a need for more precise and uniform regulations regarding staking activities across different states. This may prompt regulatory authorities to revisit and provide more explicit guidelines, potentially leading to a more standardized approach to staking regulations in the future.\n\nAnother probable impact of the restriction on Solana (SOL) staking is that it may influence market sentiment, potentially leading to increased volatility or adversely affecting Solana\u2019s (SOL) price in the short term.\n\nIn the wake of Solana\u2019s (SOL) challenges, the token dropped by 11.2% in four days, from $29.46 to $26.16. Analysts indicate Solana (SOL) may slump by 5% in the coming weeks, from $26.16 to $24.84.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) Moves Towards Expanding Globally\n\nWhile Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) wriggle through regulatory restrictions, VC Spectra (SPCT) is taking steps in the right direction. As a decentralized hedge fund, VC Spectra (SPCT) employs a thorough selection process to identify promising opportunities within the blockchain space.\n\nFurthermore, VC Spectra (SPCT) incentivizes investors with quarterly dividends and buybacks tied to investment performance. As a frontrunner in the blockchain space, VC Spectra (SPCT) leverages AI to optimize returns and mitigate possible risks.\n\nMoreover, VC Spectra\u2019s native token (SPCT) operates on the Bitcoin blockchain and follows the BRC-20 protocol. SPCT\u2019s deflationary model fosters scarcity, amplifying VC Spectra\u2019s (SPCT) value over time.\n\nCurrently trading at $0.008 in Stage 1 of its public presale, VC Spectra (SPCT) is expected to surge to $0.011 in Stage 2, representing a 37.5% ROI. Expert projections further suggest an extraordinary 900% increase, driving VC Spectra\u2019s (SPCT) price to $0.08 once it launches on major platforms. Trust the process and invest in VC Spectra today!\n\nLearn more about the VC Spectra presale here:\n\nPresale: https://invest.vcspectra.io/login\n\nWebsite: https://vcspectra.io\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/VCSpectra\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/spectravcfund"
