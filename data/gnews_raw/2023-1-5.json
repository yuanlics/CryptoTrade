        "title": "Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade could supercharge liquid staking derivatives \u2014 Here's how - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The crypto market witnessed the DeFi summer of 2020, where decentralized finance applications like Compound and Uniswap turned Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) into yield-bearing assets via yield farming and liquidity mining rewards. The price of Ether nearly doubled to $490 as the total liquidity across decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols quickly surged to $10 billion.\n\nToward the end of 2020 and early 2021, the COVID-19-induced quantitative easing across global markets was in full effect, causing a mega-bull run that lasted almost a year. During this time, Ether\u2019s price increased nearly ten times to a peak above $4,800.\n\nAfter the euphoric bullish phase ended, a painful cool-down journey was exacerbated by the UST-LUNA crash which began in early 2022. This took Ether\u2019s price down to $800. A ray of hope eventually arrived in the third quarter as the market experienced a positive rally led by the Ethereum Merge narrative.\n\nThe shift to an environmentally-friendly proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism was a big step forward. The event also reduced Ether inflation post-merge. During a lead-up to the Merge on Sept. 15, 2021, ETH peaked at over $2,000. However, the bullish momentum faded quickly, turning the Merge into a buy-the-rumor and sell-the-news event.\n\nA similar bullish opportunity could be brewing in Ether as the upcoming Shanghai upgrade scheduled for March 2023 grabs the market spotlight. The upgrade will finally enable withdrawals from Ethereum staking contracts, which are locked presently. The upgrade will significantly reduce the risk of staking ETH.\n\nIt will provide an opportunity for liquidity staking protocols to grow. The governance tokens of some of these protocols have jumped since the start of the new year as hype builds around.\n\nThere\u2019s a possibility that the upgrade can push these tokens toward last year\u2019s Merge highs. Moreover, Ethereum\u2019s staking space is still in its early stages, providing a market opportunity for the growth of these protocols.\n\nThe percentage of staked Ether is low\n\nCurrently, 13.18% of Ether\u2019s total supply is staked on the Beacon Chain, which is low compared to other PoS chains like Cosmos Hub with a staking ratio of 62.5%, Cardano with 71.8%, and Solana at 71.4%. The reason for Ethereum\u2019s low staking ratio is that the Staked Ether (stETH) is locked in its current state, but this will change in March.\n\nEthereum has the lowest staking ratio compared to other L1 blockchains. Source: Staking Rewards\n\nThe upcoming Shanghai upgrade will include a code known as EIP 4895 that will allow Beacon Chain staked Ether withdrawals, enabling a 1:1 exchange of staked Ether for Ether. Ethereum\u2019s staking ratio should reach parity with other leading PoS networks after this update. A significant portion of which will likely move to liquid staking protocols.\n\nDe-risking of liquid staking derivatives\n\nLiquid staking protocols like Lido and Rocket Pool let Ether holders stake without running a validator node. Since Ether is pooled, a single user doesn\u2019t have a minimum threshold of 32 ETH (worth around $40,000) for staking. People can stake fractions of Ether, reducing the entry barrier for staking.\n\nThe protocols also enable liquidity provision for staked assets, which would otherwise be locked in the staking contracts. The DeFi contracts give a derivative token (for instance, Lido\u2019s stETH) in exchange for staked Ether on the proof-of-stake (PoS) network. A user can trade with stETH while earning yields from the staking contract.\n\nAs Ethereum\u2019s staking ratio increases after March\u2019s update, the use of liquidity staking protocols will likely increase with it. Currently, the liquid staking protocols account for 32.65% of the total staked Ether. Due to the benefits mentioned above, their market share should remain near or above current levels after the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nThe governance tokens of liquid staking protocols could also benefit from their increased locked value, similar to DeFi tokens, which benefited from a rise in total locked value (TVL) in the latest bull run.\n\nHow are LSD governance tokens performing ahead of Shanghai?\n\nLido DAO (LDO)\n\nLido DAO is the leader of the liquid staking space with higher annual yield and market share than other protocols. Lido commands 88.55% of the total Staked Ether in these protocols.\n\nLet's take the amount of staked Ether as a proxy for evaluating the protocol. We again find that Lido has the most competitive market capitalization to Staked Ether ratio.\n\nSource: Coingecko, Dune Analytics\n\nThe weak point of the project\u2019s token economics is that LDO is a governance token. It doesn\u2019t entitle holders to a share of the generated yield or fees. Moreover, the token has additional inflation from investor token unlocking until May this year.\n\nLDO 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nTechnically, the LDO token broke above the short-term resistance of around $1.17 with significant buying volume. Bulls will likely target $1.80, capitalizing on the hype around the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nThe token is heavily shorted in the futures market after the recent 26% rise in its price since Jan. 1. The funding rate for LDO perpetual swap turned negative with a large magnitude, providing an opportunity for a further uptrend in a short-squeeze. The current support levels for LDO are $1.17 and $1.\n\nRocket Pool (RPL)\n\nRocket Pool is similar to Lido, albeit smaller in size. The market capitalization to the stETH ratio of the platform is five times larger than Lido, which likely makes it overpriced.\n\nNevertheless, the RPL token has additional utility besides governance as an insurance token for users. Node operators stake RPL as insurance, where users receive the staked RPL in case of losses due to the operator's fault.\n\nThe Ethereum Merge high of RPL in September 2021 was $34.30. Since the start of 2023, its price has increased by 10%, last trading at $22.40. If buyers are successful in building support above the $20 level, there\u2019s a possibility that RPL can reach last year\u2019s high of $30, which was attained around the Ethereum Merge.\n\nAnkr (ANKR)\n\nAnkr is a blockchain infrastructure provider which offers API endpoints and runs RPC nodes besides staking solutions. Similar to LDO, ANKR is only used for governance purposes.\n\nThe token\u2019s price has stayed relatively flat over the last few days. The market capitalization to the staked Ether ratio of Ankr is on the higher side at par with Rocket Pool, which is a negative sign.\n\nStill, if the hype around Shanghai upgrade increases, ANKR can reach August 2021 highs of $0.05. The recent breakdown level of $0.03 will act as resistance for buyers. Currently, the token is trading around $0.015.\n\nStakewise (SWISE)\n\nStakewise offers the highest staking yield of 4.43%. Its governance token is comparatively less inflated than RPL and ANKR in the market capitalization to Staked Ether ratio, making it cheaper than RPL and ANKR.\n\nHowever, the token distribution is adversely skewed towards private investors and the founding team, which have 46.9% of SWISE\u2019s total supply. According to data from Nansen, wallets identified as \u201csmart money\u201d have been slowly accumulating SWISE since April 2021.\n\nSmart wallet holdings of SWISE tokens. Source: Nansen\n\nThe Ethereum Merge high for SWISE was $0.23, which will be the likely target for buyers. The support lies near 2022-lows around $0.07.\n\nShared Stake is flagged red because the protocol was suspected of an insider exploit, which caused a 95% decline in the token\u2019s price in June 2021. The high staking return of the Shared Stake compared to others is also an eyebrow-raising detail to take note of. On the other hand, Cream Finance has discontinued its Ether staking service.\n\nThe upcoming Ethereum Shanghai upgrade provides an opportunity for the liquid staking space to grow. Lido DAO is the clear leader in this space with an optimum market price. The de-risking of ETH staking and hype around the event could translate to a series of rallies that could push the price of LDO and other liquid staking protocols back to their Merge highs from last year.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Ethereum Classic achieves strong bounce back, thanks to hash rate stimulation - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum Classic\u2019s hash rate bounced back slightly, potentially indicating increased network activity.\n\nETC\u2019s bullish momentum might be limited, according to its MA indicators.\n\nEvery once in a while, Ethereum Classic [ETC] registers a large price pump that is usually associated with whale activity. The latest such event occurred on 4 January, when ETC bulls pulled off a surprise attack and pushed the token up by over 20% in one day.\n\nRead Ethereum Classic\u2019s [ETC] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nThis ETC surge meant that the token had outperformed some of the top cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum [ETH] and Bitcoin [BTC]. A potential reason for this was the pivot in Ethereum Classic\u2019s hash rate. The latter had an undeniable impact on ETC\u2019s price action.\n\nThe Ethereum Classic hash rate declined for most of December and pivoted towards the end. It may not have achieved a major recovery, but the minor upside does demonstrate a shift in miner activity. This could be because of higher miner profitability, which would indicate that there is a significant surge in transactions.\n\nThe idea that ETC transactions have increased in the last few days is supported by a surge in volume. This has been the case in the last two days, during which Ethereum Classic\u2019s volume soared to a new monthly high.\n\nWhy the upside of ETC might be limited\n\nThis strong volume surge resulted in a sizable uptick in ETC\u2019s price action, which traded at $18.63 at the time of writing. In contrast, it traded as low as $15.83 during the 4 January trading session. However, this rally might be restricted, especially now that ETC has come into contact with its 50-day moving average.\n\nETC\u2019s price has also crossed above the 50% RSI level. So far, the price has experienced some selling pressure, indicating that profit-taking has intensified after the rally. In addition, the MFI is now overbought, hence the chances that the rally will be capped are notably higher.\n\nThere are other observations that suggest a higher chance that the bears will regain control. For example, the weighted sentiment indicates that many analysts are still leaning toward the bearish side.\n\nHow many ETCs can you get for $1?\n\nThe Binance funding rate confirmed a surge in derivatives demand for ETC. However, this upside was limited, suggesting that the demand wave might be weak. It also does not help that Ethereum Classic has seen relatively low development activity in the last few weeks.\n\nThe lack of strong development activity may fail to facilitate a strong favorable sentiment. We can thus conclude that ETC\u2019s short-term prospects may still favor the bears. Nevertheless, this might not necessarily be the case if the market sees an unexpected surge in demand."

However, reports are emerging that the commission has tightened its focus on the XRP lawsuit ignoring Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX debacle.\n\nDid Ripple pushed the limits?\n\nCharles Gasparino, journalist at Fox business in a series of Tweets gave out undisclosed details over the XRP lawsuit. He mentioned that the autopsy of the SEC Vs Ripple lawsuit is a work in progress. However, It is worth asking the commission why it focused on the XRP lawsuit amid the FTX collapse.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAs per reports, the commission believes that Ripple management was flouting the SEC authorities by continuing to sell XRP. This happened even after the notice was issued to Ripple to stop. He added that how Ripple was selling XRP seemed to establish the token designation as a security.\n\nHowever, Charles Gasparino noted that the Ethereum foundation did possibly one sale and then they just stopped. He highlighted that the SEC didn\u2019t file any kind of case against them. He mentioned that he is not picking sides and just reporting the facts.\n\nEarlier, Coingape reported that the XRP lawsuit has become more critical than ever for the commission. As after, failing to take proactive measures against the FTX and SBF, the Ripple lawsuit was most important for them. Read More XRP News Here..\n\nGeneral Counsel hits back\n\nStuart Alderoty, General Counsel of Ripple stated that if these reports are true then, this only shows how the SEC works.

        "title": "Litecoin, Dogecoin See Mining Surge After Prices Rise Post-Merge - Blockworks",
        "content": "Mining activity is surging on a raft of proof-of-work blockchains still riding tailwinds from Ethereum\u2019s switch to proof-of-stake five months ago.\n\nThose beneficiaries of Ethereum\u2019s long awaited Merge, which activated last September and sent the blockchain\u2019s miners out of business, include Dogecoin, Litecoin and Syscoin.\n\nAt the time, smaller networks minable with high-end GPUs \u2014 a la pre-Merge Ethereum \u2014 immediately saw a major hash rate uptick. Ethereum Classic\u2019s hash rate (a measure of the network\u2019s computing power) ballooned 160% in a single day and RavenCoin\u2019s jumped 80%.\n\nLike Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Litecoin can only really be efficiently mined with specialized ASIC rigs attuned to their hashing algorithm, Scrypt. Those networks, which command far less hash rate than Bitcoin, didn\u2019t book a sudden hash rate boost in September, unlike Ethereum Classic.\n\nBut they\u2019ve since set fresh record highs. Dogecoin and Litecoin are \u201cmerge-mined,\u201d meaning they can be mined simultaneously without sacrificing performance, leading their hash rates to correlate.\n\nLitecoin\u2019s hash rate chart looks pretty much the same, hitting all-time high in late December\n\nSyscoin\u2019s hash rate is also hovering around highs set in October, although it can\u2019t be mined efficiently with GPUs. The network can, however, be merge-mined with Bitcoin, which itself is maintaining record levels set late last year \u2014 even as its price has plummeted.\n\nMore hash rate typically equates to more security, as bad actors require more computing power to pull off effective 51% attacks. But are displaced Ethereum miners responsible for Dogecoin and Litecoin\u2019s hash rate pumps?\n\nA spokesperson for Litecoinpool.org, an aptly-named Litecoin mining pool, doesn\u2019t believe so. Common Ethereum mining rigs, such as the RTX 3080, could contribute around 100 MH/s to the network\u2019s hash rate, but less than two MH/s to Litecoin, good for a factor of about 50.\n\nEthereum\u2019s hash rate was roughly 1,000 TH/s before the Merge. So, if all the miners on Ethereum were to switch to Litecoin, per back-of-the-napkin math, those miners should expect to add about 20 TH/s to Litecoin\u2019s hash rate.\n\nLitecoin\u2019s hash rate has climbed far more than 20 TH/s. It was just over 400 TH/s in September. It\u2019s now sitting around 600 TH/s, a 50% jump.\n\n\u201cI think we can safely say that this jump cannot be attributed to GPUs coming from Ethereum mining, but rather to more Scrypt ASICs entering the market,\u201d the Litecoinpool.org rep said.\n\nThey added that Litecoin\u2019s third halving is just a few months away, which means miners may well be looking to get more bang for their buck before issuances are reduced.\n\nLitecoin and Dogecoin soar since Merge\n\nAt times, mining Litecoin and Dogecoin to sell for BTC can be more profitable than mining Bitcoin directly. A source familiar with the mining industry told Blockworks that some mid-sized mining operations keep Scrypt ASICs on hand for that exact purpose.\n\nRead more: Is Bitcoin Mining Still Profitable? The Economics Explained\n\nThe source was granted anonymity because they are not authorized to talk to the media.\n\nSarah Manter, director of communications for mining platform PROHASHING, told Blockworks that rather than directing old Ethereum GPUs to Scrypt, it was more likely that miners have been buying up used ASICs from those who capitulated when the market crashed \u2014 and pointing them at Dogecoin and Litecoin.\n\nEither that, or they\u2019re selling GPUs and buying new ASICs to mine what\u2019s now profitable.\n\nEthereum Classic\u2019s hash rate has retraced since its post-Merge bump\n\n\u201cI have no knowledge of GPUs being repurposed to mine Litecoin, because GPUs haven\u2019t been able to profitably mine Litecoin/Dogecoin for quite some time,\u201d Manter said.\n\nAdded Manter: \u201cI know a lot of GPU miners have either been getting out of the game altogether in favor of other endeavors such as staking, or buying, trading or turning off their workers to wait it out and see what pulls ahead and becomes profitable again.\u201d\n\nLitecoin has increased 24% since the Merge, increasing the odds of profiting from mining the blockchain. Price, though, is just one factor, alongside energy and equipment expenditures, impacting profit.\n\nDogecoin is up 16% over the same period.\n\nManter said that no GPU algorithm (and, accordingly, associated blockchains) seems to be pulling ahead of its peers in the same vein as Ethereum\u2019s dominance.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean one won\u2019t eventually, as the market improves [and] hash rate shifts,\u201d Manter said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

The upgrade, set to take place before March, plans to enable Ether stakers to withdraw their assets from the proof-of-stake Beacon Chain, which was previously unavailable to them.\n\n\u201cThe risk of not knowing when they can withdraw their [staked] assets is a factor of price discount,\u201d Paik Hoon-jong, the chief operating officer of South Korea-based blockchain fintech firm DA:Ground told Forkast in a video interview. \u201cThe announcement resolved a lot of anxiety about ETH 2.0,\u201d said Paik, adding that the relief prompted many investors to look into ETH-related products and services, such as Lido.\n\nBitDAO is an entity built on Ethereum where holders of BIT vote on proposals and contribute to its investment decisions in crypto and the DeFi ecosystem. It is backed by Bybit exchange, billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel and Pantera.\n\nLast week, the BitDAO community approved a proposal to buy back US$100 million worth of BIT in USDT for supply maintenance. BitDAO started the 50-day, US$2 million -per-day buyback on Jan. 1.\n\nSee related article: Biggest blockchain trends for 2023 and beyond"

        "title": "ETH Price Prediction for 2023 and Vitalik Buterin's Adoption of Ethereum Improvement Proposal - CoinIdol",
        "content": "Jan 06, 2023 at 12:30 // News\n\nCoin Idol Author\n\nEthereum (ETH) price forecast is bullish, but $1,260 is a strong resistance level that will limit the uptrend.\n\nETH/USD opened the day at $1,214.96 on January 4. It has a high of $1,256.95 and a low of $1,212.89. ETH eTH/USD is currently trading at $1,251.37 and is up 2.94% in the last 24 hours. Also, the price has risen more than 3% in the last week.\n\n\n\n\n\nVitalik Buterin adoption of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4884\n\nThe creator of the Ethereum smart contract platform (ETH), Vitalik Buterin, discusses his top investment ideas for 2023. In a roadmap diagram posted on Twitter, he expresses confidence that Ethereum will reach the \"basic roll-up scaling\" milestone on December 3. That milestone, Buterin said, requires the adoption of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844.\n\nReaching the \"basic rollup scaling\" milestone in my roadmap diagram.\n\n\n\nThat means:\n\n\n\n* EIP-4844 rolled out\n\n* Rollups partially taking off training wheels, at least to \"stage 1\" as described here https://t.co/qNQonDQkzG pic.twitter.com/7HePctWw1l \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 31, 2022\n\nEIP-4844 adds a new transaction type to Ethereum that allows data \" blobs \" to be temporarily stored in the beacon node. These changes are fully compatible with Ethereum's scaling strategy, and the size of the blobs is manageable to reduce disk usage.\n\nIn addition, EIP 4844 is part of Ethereum's surge development on Twitter, which aims to increase the transaction processing speed of the leading smart contract platform to 100,000 transactions per second or more.\n\nButerin defines the \"basic roll-up scaling milestone\" as \"partially removing training wheels\" for roll-ups. He claims that removing the training wheels means operating a legal or fraud-proof system.\n\nThe change could be beneficial to the Ethereum network. As a result, the value of ETH/USD could increase.\n\nEthereum Volatility\n\nOver the past two weeks, Ethereum volatility has decreased, as has the volatility of the rest of the market. Ethereum's network activity is low despite its increased stability.\n\nThe number of daily Ethereum transactions dropped to 742,000 on January 1, according to Etherscan.io, the Ethereum blockchain's block explorer. The last time it was seen on the mainnet was April 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe daily average for mainnet transactions is at 948,000 at the time of writing. Despite a slight improvement in recent days, the statistic is still near its lows. Transaction metrics need to improve for the price of ETH /USD to recover in the coming days.\n\nDaily Technicals & Ethereum Price Forecast\n\nSupport Resistance 1207.67 - 1220.58 1200.79 - 1226.61 1194.76 - 1233.49\n\nPivot point: 1213.70\n\nEthereum Price Prediction\n\nEthereum is currently trading for $1,247, with a 24-hour trading volume of $4.8 billion. With a 2.5% increase, Ethereum has found immediate support at the $1,235 level.\n\nUptrend resistance for ETH remains above $1,260, and a positive breakout could take the price to $1,280 or $1,300.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport is still at $1,235, but a break below that level could allow further selling to $1,205. The RSI, MACD and 50-day simple moving average are all bullish. So look for buying opportunities today, especially above the $1,235 level.\n\nAlthough support is currently at $1,235, a drop below that level could allow for further selling down to $1,205. Bullish indicators include the RSI, MACD, and the 50-day simple moving average. Therefore, look for buying opportunities today, especially above $1,235.\n\nDisclaimer.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAlleged Shiba Inu (SHIB) killer, Bonk (BONK) is maintaining its stellar start as a meme coin as it has continued to hit new milestones, including surpassing the total number of transactions on the Ethereum (ETH) network. According to a tweet from the official account of the meme coin, the token has recorded a total of 4,623,518 transactions over the past 14 days, a figure that surpasses Ethereum's 1,831.79 million by more than 50%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBONK became a sensation in the crypto community as it paraded itself as the first dog-focused token on the Solana blockchain network. With the crypto ecosystem in search of so much thrill, many jumped on board to buy the token, pushing its price to a significantly high pedestal.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bonk is changing hands at $0.000001925, down 56.68% over the past 24 hours. Despite the massive daily slump in the price of the token, it is still up by more than 2,000% over the past seven days. As a new meme coin, Bonk is on track to beat the return record of both Shiba Inu and Dogecoin (DOGE), and many of its community members believe its bullish momentum is just building up.\n\nBONK token burn thrill\n\nThe BONK token may be a young meme coin, however, it has a very unique design, one of which is its deflationary nature. Thus far, the BONK token has burnt more than 500 billion tokens of its 56 trillion coins in circulation.\n\nAmong the coin's burning mechanism design is the likelihood that the new Solana mobile phone Saga will also be used in burning the BONK tokens. Solana Mobile hinted at this possibility on Twitter, as reported by U.Today, when a user said that he might consider using BONK tokens to buy the phone if a part of the earnings will be burnt off.\n\nFor BONK, its journey is just getting started."

It is up by more than 4% in the last 24 hours, and the price of Ethereum Classic now stands at $18.73.\n\nAccording to the crypto analytics platform Santiment , Ethereum Classic is enjoying a pretty nice rally of its own. Not only is volume high, but ETC is also being shorted big time by traders on exchanges.\n\nThis latest cryptocurrency news could be the major catalyst driving ETC higher. The broader crypto market had a positive start to the week but is now retreating.

        "title": "Binance's stablecoin BUSD hasn't always been 1:1 backed, report - Protos",
        "content": "Listen to this article.\n\nBinance has previously undercollateralized its stablecoin, BUSD, on its own blockchain, according to on-chain data revealing that the wallet backing the BUSD bridged from Ethereum\u2019s blockchain onto Binance\u2019s blockchain did not consistently equal one dollar\u2019s worth of assets for each Binance-pegged BUSD.\n\nInvestigative reporter Jonathan Reiter of Data Finnovation collaborated with Patrick Tan of Novum Alpha to initially publicize the shortfall. Reiter has published five scholarly articles and specializes in stablecoin research. Both firms are based in Singapore. Their joint analysis shows insufficient backing of BUSD trading on BNB Chain for several months.\n\nNot-so-stablecoin BUSD\n\nBUSD is the world\u2019s third-largest stablecoin with a market capitalization exceeding $16 billion. Binance worked with blockchain infrastructure firm Paxos to promise 1:1 backing.\n\nHowever, Paxos only promises 1:1 backing of BUSD on Ethereum. For a while, the public assumed that BUSD on any blockchain was fully backed \u2014 especially Binance\u2019s own blockchain. Eventually, Paxos disclaimed responsibility for non-Ethereum-based BUSD.\n\nAiming to distance itself from non-Ethereum-based BUSD, Paxos clarified, \u201cBinance-Peg BUSD is strictly a Binance product; it is not issued by Paxos nor regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services.\u201d\n\nRepeatedly assuring the public about BUSD\u2019s 1:1 backing and dollar peg is of paramount importance for Binance. Binance itself holds 25% of its assets \u2014 a staggering $13 billion \u2014 in BUSD. Incredibly, the company forcibly liquidated customer holdings of competitors\u2019 stablecoins USDC, USDP, and TUSD in order to increase BUSD adoption last year.\n\nBinance claims that BUSD reserves are audited monthly in compliance with all relevant regulations. Paxos affirms that it holds assets to back all BUSD tokens on Ethereum with fiat currency and US Treasury bills in US banks. However, Paxos does not back BUSD on BNB Chain, which have occasionally been undercollateralized.\n\nOrange line represents Paxos-linked $BUSD on Ethereum intended to back the equivalent $BUSD circulating on Binance Smart Chain.\n\n\n\nGreen line is the $BUSD that was circulating on Binance Smart Chain that ought to have been backed by the equivalent on Ethereum. pic.twitter.com/LgXgZnYey6 \u2014 Patrick Tan (@patrick_novum) January 3, 2023 The green line should always have been lower than the orange line.\n\nBinance wanted you to believe\n\nSkepticism is understandable regarding so-called stablecoins, many of which have failed to maintain their stability. Many stablecoins have collapsed all the way to $0.\n\nFans of Binance believed BUSD was different. Binance wanted to differentiate its stablecoin from a long history of lies by other stablecoin issuers. It convinced the world that it would fully back all BUSD at all times, no matter what. It failed.\n\nOf course, many stablecoins maintain their peg for years \u2014 trading at $1 until the very end, then suddenly crashing to $0. Terra (UST) traded at $1 for over a year and a half. Then, within one month, it traded from $1 to below one penny and never recovered, losing $18 billion dollars in market capitalization.\n\nIn fairness, Binance seems to have resolved these past issues with BUSD. Despite months of historical shortfalls, it currently backs Binance-peg BUSD 1:1.\n\nConclusion\n\nBinance promised that BUSD was fully backed without precisely qualifying that its promise applied only to BUSD on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain. Worse, many BNB Chain users believed that assets at Paxos ultimately backed all BUSD on a 1:1 basis. We now know that Binance-peg BUSD was not always backed.\n\nProtos was able to verify, as documented by Data Finnovation, that the Ethereum-based backing wallet listed in Binance\u2019s documentation occasionally undercollateralized BUSD tokens bridged onto BNB Chain. In other words, unbacked BUSD have circulated in the past. Subsequently, Binance topped-up funds in that backing wallet, albeit in a manner inconsistent with the official bridging process described in Binance\u2019s documentation.\n\nTherefore, Protos can\u2019t attest that Binance didn\u2019t hold sufficient assets to back all Binance-peg BUSD at all times. We\u2019re only certain that it didn\u2019t fully back all Binance-peg BUSD with assets in its official Ethereum-based backing wallet. Today, Binance-peg BUSD is fully backed.\n\nFor more informed news, follow us on Twitter and Google News or listen to our investigative podcast Innovated: Blockchain City."

Whalestats shows that the meme crypto was among the top ten most purchased tokens among the top 2,000 largest Ethereum investors as of this week.\n\nWhat is fueling the high whales\u2019 appetite is the much-awaited Shibarium. It is a layer-2 platform expected to improve the performance of Shiba Inu. Speculations were heightened that Shibarium could be launched soon after the ecosystem\u2019s lead developer Shytoshi Kusama remarked on the same. \u201cLove meeting with the team from UnificationUND about Shibarium. Aligning. Onboarding. Finalizing. Soon. Very Soon,\u201d Kusama said.\n\nDescribed as the foundation for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, Shibarium features a decentralized exchange (DEX), blockchain games, and the metaverse \u2013 all of which have been under development. Shiba Inu currently relies on Ethereum, with shortcomings being slow transactions and high gas fees. However, that is bound to change within the layer-2 solution. Shibarium will take most of the transactions off Ethereum while still using the blockchain as a security layer.\n\nShibaSwap Governance Token BONE Jumps Double-Digit\n\nBONE, a governance and utility token, has gained the most from the sentiment among the five major tokens in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. The digital asset, capped at 230,000,000 tokens, has gained 10% in the past week, according to data from CoinGecko. On the other hand, SHIB declined by 0.36% in the same period.\n\nLEASH and TREAT are the other tokens expected to play a key role in the upcoming Shibarium. Both tokens can be staked for rewards in Shiba Inu liquidity pools. Also in the plan is SHI, a utility stablecoin. The Shibarium developers have also added a token burn mechanism to cut the supply of SHIB.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe latest data from the Shiba Inu burn tracker, Shibburn shows that the number of burned SHIB to date was 410,384,382,996,444 as of the time of writing these lines. The canine-themed token launched with an initial supply of a quadrillion tokens, out of which that in circulation stands at 562,850,341,247,185."

        "content": "The total transactions on the Ethereum network tore through that of Bitcoin by more than fourfold in 2022, data from DollarGeek has shown.\n\nData from Nasdaq and Ycharts have also shown that there were 338% more Ether transactions in 2022 (408.5 million) than Bitcoin transactions (93.1 million).\n\nThis notwithstanding, Bitcoin managed to retain its crown when it comes to online search interest, according to google trend searches. About 28.41 million people googled Bitcoin during the year.\n\nMore details on this: The Ethereum blockchain averaged a daily transaction count of around 1.1 million for ETH, while that of Bitcoin\u2019s network stood at 255,000 for BTC.\n\nAlthough the Ethereum network led the charge, transaction volumes on the Bitcoin network were steadier and more periodic than on the Ethereum network, which experienced much more volatility in transaction volumes.\n\nThis was due to spikes in demand at certain times such as NFT launches and other gas fee-intensive events such as XEN minting.\n\nMore on Ether\u2019s performance: Ether, the native token of the Ethereum network, has seen its supply drop since October 8., 2022 which marked the Ethereum network\u2019s first deflationary move.\n\nThe deflationary move happened when the network switched from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) via the Merge in September 2022.\n\nAfter the update, a portion of the Ethereum network gas fee, otherwise known as the transaction fee, is permanently removed from the Ether circulation. Simply put, more ETH gets burned in a high-demand environment.\n\nWe began to see the Ethereum network\u2019s deflationary functionality after October 8, when a new crypto project named XEN Crypto increased network traffic. At the time, XEN Crypto accounted for the burning of 4,490 ETH tokens against 16,690.52 ETH tokens on the day, which represents 26.90% of the total transactions burned.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s unending relevance: It is believed that people\u2019s interest in Bitcoin remains relatively high as experts assess quality compared to other crypto assets in the industry.\n\nCNBC reported that Venture capital investor, Tim Draper, explained that weaker coins will become relics amid the ongoing crypto winter, benefitting BTC. According to him, this is an indicator that the top cryptocurrency could reach $250,000 per token.\n\nEthereum\u2019s heftier transaction volumes have continued into the new year, with the Ethereum transaction count on Jan. 2 reaching 924,614, a 300% increase compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 229,191 on the same day, according to Bitinfocharts.\n\nThe analyst who posted the metrics explained that he was sceptical about people saying that a \u201cflippening,\u201d could happen someday, and further added that those advocating for it have reason to do so now.\n\nA flippening occurs when one chain surpasses a higher-ranked one for the same metric, in this case, transactions and activity.\n\nWhile there is a clear distance between Ethereum and Bitcoin\u2019s transaction volumes, the distance could be more significant than we are reading. This is because the charts do not include layer 2 transactions, which would put Ethereum even further ahead of Bitcoin for this metric.\n\nAccording to L2beat, the number of L2 transactions per second actually surpassed those on layer 1 Ethereum in mid-October and has remained above it ever since."

        "content": "Ethereum layer-2 scaling platform StarkNet has overhauled its in-house Cairo coding language to make Web3 development accessible to developers.\n\nAn announcement shared with Cointelegraph outlines the upgrades to Cairo 1.0, which is touted to emulate characteristics of the popular programming language Rust. The overhaul intends to allow developers with general coding experience to begin building decentralized applications on StarkNet\u2019s Ethereum layer-2 network.\n\nStarkWare co-founder and president Eli Ben-Sasson told Cointelegraph that making layer-2 development more accessible to developers of varying backgrounds was the main reason for Cairo\u2019s revamp:\n\n\u201cThe primary drivers were safety and ease of use, and conducting the overhaul presented a terrific opportunity to remove the entry for developers with conventional language backgrounds.\u201d\n\nThe technical specifications outlined in the Jan. 5 launch encompass a host of improvements to Cairo\u2019s language, including improved syntax and language constructs, a holistic type system, intuitive libraries, optimized code and strong typing by demanding specification of data types.\n\nStarkNet highlighted Sierra \u2014 which stands for Safe Intermediate Representation \u2014 as the main addition to Cairo\u2019s overhaul. Sierra acts as a new intermediate representation layer between Cairo 1.0 and Cairo byte code.\n\nAs Ben-Sasson explained, Sierra is an important aspect of ensuring a permissionless network. The upgrade enables reverted transactions to be included in StarkNet blocks, helping the protocol to avoid adding complex \u201ccrypto-economic mechanisms.\u201d\n\nRelated: StarkNet makes Cairo 1.0 open source in first step toward community control\n\nBen-Sasson said that Sierra will allow StarkNet to \u201cinherit the full censorship-resistance of Ethereum\u201d and mainly protects against Sequencer denial-of-service attacks.\n\nAs previously reported by Cointelegraph, Ben-Sasson pioneered zk-STARK cryptography alongside other computer scientists. Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge is a proof system that encrypts and verifies transaction data to provide security, scalability and resistance to quantum computing.\n\nAccording to StarkNet, Cairo is the fourth most popular smart contract language by total value locked. It is the base of applications that have processed over 300 million transactions, minted 90 million nonfungible tokens and facilitated $790 million worth of trades settled on Ethereum."

        "content": "More than 70% Ethereum stakes were underwater at press time\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade would enable unstaking once deployed\n\nStaking Ethereum [ETH], particularly after the Merge, prompted several conversations. The topics of discussion ranged from dominant staking pools to OFAC-compliant blocks, as well as the threats that a combination of the two posed to Ethereum and the transactions that used ETH.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2025-2030\n\nHowever, some groups of stakers can be concerned about something completely different in relation to staking: the amount of profit their investments generated.\n\nStake at a loss?\n\nAccording to Hildobby\u2019s data from Dune Analytics, some ETH stakers were currently making a profit, while others were at the breakeven threshold. Yet, others were experiencing a loss. According to Dune Analytics, 77.5% stakers were at a loss at press time, while only 22.5% were in profit.\n\nAccording to the chart, the various phases of profit were decided by the price of Ethereum at various stages of entry into different staking pools by stakers.\n\nAccording to the above data, there were currently over 15k ETH staked, and the entire staked amount equaled 13.18% of ETH\u2019s total supply.\n\nFears of a huge sell-off following the Shanghai upgrade have been popular. This is because of the proportion of ETH that was currently locked in staking pools and the current loss that a larger proportion of stakers were experiencing.\n\nETH in a daily timeframe\n\nAccording to the daily timeframe chart shown, ETH\u2019s price movement was relatively flat. As of this writing, the price was seen to have increased by over 3% over the previous 48 hours, bringing it to approximately $1,253. The token had made some progress in bouncing back, according to the Relative Strength Index metric (RSI).\n\nIndicating a positive trend, the RSI line was shown to be above the neutral zone. If the press time upward momentum continues, the location of the RSI line could strengthen the bullish trend.\n\nA sustained upward push might cause ETH to overcome different resistances and retake the $2,000 area, turning most of the staked ETH into profit.\n\nLong-term Ethereum holders at a loss\u2026\n\nThe Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio for ETH over the last 365 days revealed that holders were holding at a loss throughout that time. Given the challenging year that cryptocurrencies experienced, ETH holders were holding at a loss of 27.57% as of this writing, which seemed like a minimal loss."

        "content": "I\u2019ve been working on consumer products for about a decade, having contributed to teams that have built and scaled apps to hundreds of millions of users. For the last six years I\u2019ve been 100% focused on crypto. A large part of that has been working on scaling solutions for large-scale, consumer-crypto products.\n\nI\u2019ve been part of teams that have built and launched products on Ethereum, Stellar and Solana, and have evaluated most of the other major blockchains and layer 2 scaling options, which has included spinning up basic proof-of-concepts. In particular, I\u2019ve looked deeply at the benefits and tradeoffs of Polygon \u2013 the dominant scaling option for Ethereum today.\n\nTanner Philp is a senior blockchain developer and currently the head of operations and go-to-market for Code, an upcoming self-custodial crypto wallet app built on Solana.\n\nWeb2 developers planning to jump into Web3 often wonder which blockchain they should start with. Most of these discussions end up focusing on Solana and Polygon. It\u2019s a debate that\u2019s only grown more heated in the weeks since Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s crypto trading empire collapsed, given he was one of Solana\u2019s most prominent supporters.\n\nAlthough many see the downfall of FTX as a potential death knell to Solana, the network remains a promising technological solution to blockchain\u2019s scaling issues. Even Ethereum co-creater Vitalik Buterin has noted the strength and gumption of developers building on Solana. And, developer activity is one of the best leading indicators of value creation over time.\n\nGiven this I thought it would be helpful to share my perspective as someone experienced in different crypto networks on the pros and cons of Solana and Polygon. Note: This article primarily focuses on Polygon POS (proof-of-stake), the dominant product within the Polygon product suite, with which I have direct experience. This article also contemplates other Polygon products currently in development, based on the information I\u2019m able to gather publicly, which will be noted when referenced.\n\nStory continues\n\nSee also: Why Solana Was Decimated by Bankman-Fried's Downfall | Opinion\n\nThere\u2019s three criteria I think are both critically important and materially different between the two chains: performance, approach to scaling and security.\n\n1. Performance\n\nIt might be an unpopular opinion to say that transactions-per-second (TPS) is a bad metric. What really matters is seconds-per-transaction (SPT). These are not the same; let me explain.\n\nTransactions-per-second is calculated by taking the number of transactions in a block and dividing that by the time it takes for validators or miners to produce a block, a.k.a. block time. This method misses an important nuance in how block time feels for crypto users.\n\nLet\u2019s say a blockchain produces a block once every hour, but that block contains a billion transactions. This blockchain would technically boast 277,000 TPS, but anyone using it wouldn\u2019t think so. The median seconds-per-transaction (assuming normal distribution of transaction submission across the hour) would be 30 minutes. This is why block time matters.\n\nOn Solana, the block time (referred to as \u201cslot time\u201d) is ~0.4 seconds. On Polygon the block time is ~2 seconds. This might seem like splitting hairs but the difference between 2 seconds and a half second is a big deal. When a user experiences more than a second of latency in an app (the brain processes information it sees at <0.15 seconds), it can feel like an eternity. I\u2019ve seen this phenomenon first hand while working on consumer apps. Moreover, every millisecond counts when price discovery and execution are so tied for financial applications.\n\nAnother technical consideration when comparing block times is that Polygon (like other EVM chains) uses a mempool where transactions are indexed before being added to a block. Solana takes a different route, where transactions are submitted directly to the leader in the validator set. So while block time on Polygon is ~2 seconds, there is no guarantee a transaction will make it into the next block since it could get stuck in the mempool \u2013 especially in times of high volatility.\n\nThis phenomenon of getting \u201cstuck\u201d or \u201cdelayed\u201d is a result of the block size. Imagine Venmo ran an app on-chain and needed to fill dozens of orders per second, if it chose a blockchain with 0.01-second block times that could only fit one transaction in a block, the observed SPT would be sluggish.\n\nOn Solana, blocks can theoretically reach a maximum size of 128MB. The Solana Turbine protocol breaks a block into 1280 byte packets called shreds. Through Solana\u2019s Tower BFT protocol, these can be verified concurrently by separate validators, enabling parallelized computation.\n\nOn Polygon, the block size for the POS chain is currently between 50-120KB. There is a product in development called Polygon Avail that should increase this capacity. Avail is a data availability protocol that sits on top of the Polygon POS chain to increase storage. It is currently spec\u2019d at 2MB per block with a 20 second block time though may scale to 128MB (with a theoretical minimum block time for a block that size of 5 seconds).\n\nBlock capacity manifests in fee markets, which we can see today. The average transaction fee on Polygon is ~$0.02 whereas Solana is ~$0.0002. According to 0x, when block utilization approaches 80%, the fee markets start increasing substantially, and as block utilization approaches 95%, it starts increasing exponentially.\n\nPolygon is designed to scale through parallelized sidechains, which opens up the option to increase total block capacity through more chains, so that could bring the fee markets down. Although, this approach to scaling carries bigger systemic risks that, depending on what you\u2019re building, may make building on Polygon challenging.\n\nThis is where I believe the biggest divergence in the two chains is, and is the subject of the next section.\n\n2. Approach to scaling\n\nA one sentence summary of how Solana and Polygon differ on their approach to scaling would be: Solana is built to keep everything on a single chain and Polygon is built to add more concurrent chains that merge state periodically.\n\nTo expand on this, a Solana cluster (set of validators contributing to consensus) has a leader schedule. This leader schedule enumerates which validator will be verifying each block (a.k.a. a slot on Solana). With a predefined leader schedule, transactions are forwarded to the scheduled leader, cutting down on unnecessary coordination.\n\nSee also: Solana Co-Founder Sees Upside From Ethereum's Merge\n\nIn the near future, Solana should also see multiple block leaders which will improve performance and mitigate downtime. All of this is uniquely enabled by Solana\u2019s proof-of-history consensus protocol that aligns the network around a shared clock. Without a shared time-keeper, the network has to be reactive to emergent leaders in the validation schedule.\n\nProof-of-history combined with the Turbine protocol enables fast streaming of large amounts of data that all lives on one chain.\n\nPolygon has a similar system of defining a block leader through its Bor protocol, but the approach to scaling is different. Polygon is set up to scale by adding more sidechains running in parallel and merging state periodically through a commitment to Ethereum. That\u2019s why you may see Polygon POS and Plasma referred to as a \u201ccommit chain.\u201d Multiple, parallel sidechains may mean it\u2019s possible for two users to be on separate sidechains using the same app, which would mean users are beholden to the latency of the state merge between chains and developers have to build for complexity.\n\nThis way Polygon scales may also introduce the risk a blockchain could see a \u201cre-org\u201d (where transactions are rolled back) since a user cannot reliably consider their transaction \u201cfinal\u201d until block height reaches a certain threshold. There\u2019s no magic number for this, but as an example, stablecoin issuer Circle waits for 372 blocks to pass on Polygon (~20 minutes) before they consider a transaction \u201cfinal\u201d and 1 block (~0.4 seconds) on Solana.\n\nPolygon\u2019s variant finality is a substantial drawback, and may impact what type of apps could be built on it. For instance, crypto apps might put a user\u2019s funds on hold until a transaction is considered final or allow users to transact immediately and accept the risk of a double spend exploit (like accepting credit card chargeback risk). This is a step backwards from crypto\u2019s supposed elimination of financial counterparty risks.\n\nA single chain will always be better than a collection of sidechains, assuming the single chain can scale. A single chain has less coordination complexity, less aggregation latency and less surface area for attack.\n\nThe question is, can Solana support the same scale that Polygon claims to? Based on a recent demo from Kevin Bowers at Jump Crypto, it seems it can. The team at Jump Crypto has built a new validator client for Solana called Firedancer that demonstrated 1.2 million transactions per second, while maintaining the sub-second slot time. To put that into perspective, if you counted every Twitter, WhatsApp and Instagram interaction as a transaction, they could all run concurrently on Solana without any performance degradation.\n\nPolygon also has a substantial set of technical improvements in development. Specifically, the investment in zero-knowledge (zk) rollups should result in substantial performance improvements. However, zk rollups must settle on the layer 1 (currently Ethereum) to be considered valid \u2013 meaning while they open up capacity they also add latency.\n\n3. Security\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to be high performing and scalable, but we also need confidence in the network. Both Solana and Polygon have had significant soak time, so the chance of a critical bug lying in plain sight is diminishing (although not impossible).\n\nGiven this, potential blockchain developers should focus on a network\u2019s resiliency to bad actors trying to influence state. This is most objectively measured by the Nakamoto Coefficient (NC), a metric that quantifies the number of validators that would need to collude to corrupt a network.\n\nAt the time of this writing the Solana NC is 32 and Polygon is 4. Both are proof-of-stake networks so distribution of stake matters. Solana has approximately 1,900 validators and Polygon has roughly 100. What the Nakamoto Coefficient says here is that the top 32 validators on Solana and the top four validators on Polygon could take down the network.\n\nBoth networks would do well to increase security on this vector, and I think they both will, and both Polygon and Solana have seen an increase in their NC over the last year. As more validators come online, Polygon\u2019s NC will grow, and other technical improvements in development like zk rollups will improve security.\n\nIt\u2019s argued that Polygon has higher security because it commits state periodically to Ethereum. This is a bit misguided though because the Polygon network is the one updating state to Ethereum, so if four validators colluded to corrupt the ledger, in theory a commitment could be made to Ethereum with the corrupted ledger. This is a solvable problem the Polygon team and broader ecosystem are working on.\n\nWhile I do think there is a divergence in security today, I think both blockchains will see big improvements here over time and we may see some convergence coming from a mix of technical and social advancements. This is probably the hardest one to project.\n\n4. Bonus: community\n\nWhile not a technical criteria, community is nonetheless an important variable in the success of a network. Polygon has an advantage in being connected to Ethereum where there is an objectively larger developer and consumer community than Solana. Further, the Polygon Foundation has done a good job cultivating brands and developers to build on its network \u2013 I would expect this to continue.\n\nAnd given Polygon plans to bridge to multiple blockchains, they\u2019ll be able to leverage existing communities bringing even more developers and consumers into the fold.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a moat, however. It\u2019s early in crypto with most of the world still on the sidelines, I think performant applications will bring them in, and the developer, creator and consumer communities will congregate where the best apps and the most users are. That\u2019s why I think the technical criteria above are a leading indicator of future community development.\n\nWhile Solana had to overcome a cold-start problem, in less than three years it has grown to one of the most active developer, creator and consumer communities. There is a diverse set of developers making the core more performant and robust, while others are adding services and tooling to make the developer experience better.\n\nSee also: The Fake Team That Made Solana DeFi Look Huge\n\nThat foundation has enabled talented teams to build strong consumer experiences across the major categories in crypto. I would expect this cycle to continue, bringing more talented people into the ecosystem as the talent density compounds.\n\nI do think both Polygon and Solana serve important needs in the broader crypto ecosystem, but I do think it is important for developers to understand the pros and cons. I hope this helps."

According to Kosala Hemachandra, the wallet went live just two weeks after the Ethereum mainnet launch. The CEO of MyEtherWallet explained that the company chose to make a decentralized wallet because it believed it was the only proper way to interact with blockchain technology.\n\n\u201cBlockchain, at its core, is a decentralized solution, so why would we create products that are centralized? Because we are defeating the whole purpose of using blockchain.\u201d\n\nHemachandra explains that MyEtherWallet started as a hobby project that became more demanding since there were no examples to look at during its development. The developer had to write new Ethereum libraries in Javascript.\n\nThe need to build a foundation of codebases that could accelerate growth in the Ethereum landscape was the reason the team opted to make the code open source. What\u2019s more, the open-source nature of the code allows the platform to have more eyes on its codebase to prevent potential vulnerabilities.\n\nDespite growing competition, MyEtherWallet has over 3 million monthly users, mainly from the United States and Japan. To catch up with the likes of MetaMask, the decentralized wallet is adding support for more blockchain networks and recently launched a multichain browser extension. Hemachandra also pointed out that the first two weeks after the FTX saga brought in many new users looking for decentralized alternatives to store their crypto.\n\nRelated: Crypto trader regrets not catching the top of the bull run\n\nOn trends in the industry, Hemachandra mentioned that MyEtherWallet has yet to make plans to do an airdrop for its users despite rumors that some of its competitors may launch their own tokens soon. According to the CEO, MyEtherWallet doesn\u2019t see any use cases for tokens released by wallet applications at the moment.\n\nIn the episode, Elisha and Hemachandra also cover:\n\nNew features for decentralized wallets.\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem and the popularity of layer-2 platforms.\n\nA multichain future in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nHashing It Out is a new Cointelegraph podcast series covering innovations and important stories in the blockchain industry, featuring interviews with thought leaders in the space hosted by Elisha (GhCryptoGuy).\n\nFor more discussion with Hemachandra, listen to the full episode of Hashing It Out on the new Cointelegraph Podcasts page or Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts or Amazon Music.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here and in this podcast are the participants\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

The data shows that it recorded about 64,594 new addresses in May.\n\nSource: Dune\n\nEthereum Name Service (ENS) is a decentralized database that enables users to register and manage domain names on the Ethereum blockchain using the ENS token. The token is used for transferring ownership of these domains and for payment when registering and managing domain names.\n\nTo register a domain name with ENS, users need to send a certain amount of Ether (ETH) to an address provided by ENS. This ETH will cover the transaction fees and other costs associated with registering the domain name.\n\nTo transfer ownership of an ENS domain name, the current owner will need to send a certain amount of ENS tokens along with information about the new owner, like their address and signature. It can be done through exchanges or wallets that support ERC-20 tokens, like MyEtherWallet.\n\nEthereum (ETH) & ENS Price Analysis\n\nAs of now, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, is trading at $1,249.01.

        "content": "Don\u2019t invest unless prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nJoin Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage\n\nLido DAO price surges another 7.5% in 24 hours, bringing the total cumulative gains in the last seven days to slightly above 42%. The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) token, which supports the staking of multiple assets, is trading at $1.35 at the time of writing, although it recently hit a three-week high of $1.45.\n\nInvestor interest in LIDO is growing by the day, bolstered by continued community engagement via channels like Twitter. According to the latest report from Lido Finance, staking deposits for Ethereum (ETH) grew by 0.21% to 4,637,760 in the seven days ending January 2.\n\n(1) Lido on Twitter: \u201c\u26a1\ufe0f Lido Deposits Ethereum: 4,637,760 ETH (7d: +0.21%) Polygon: 58,025,885 MATIC (7d: +3.32%) Solana: 2,335,230 SOL (7d: -6.13%) Polkadot: 2,522,827 DOT (7d: +1.89%) Kusama: 99,290 KSM (7d: +0.38%) https://t.co/zQw07WF6Se\u201d / Twitter\n\nStaking despots for Polygon (MATIC) went up 3.32% to 58,025,885 in the same period. Staking deposits for Solana (SOL) fell by -6.13% to 2,335,230, while deposits in Polkadot (DOT) increased by 1.89% to 2,522,827.\n\nLido DAO Price Sustains Winning Streak Ahead of the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade\n\nGovernance tokens like Lido DAO, SWISE and RPL exploded this week despite Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) staying relatively unchanged. The uptick in the price of tokens that allow investors to retain the liquidity of their assets despite being locked (staked) in a smart contract started after Ethereum developers announced their commitment to enabling withdrawals of ETH staked in the Beacon Chain since December 2020.\n\n\u201cMost recently, liquid staking derivatives [tokens] have had a nice uptrend. This is thanks to the Shanghai upgrade expected in a few months, which will enable withdrawals of staked ETH. As withdrawals are enabled, many believe more users will stake their ETH,\u201d CroissantEth, a pseudonymous analyst said via Twitter.\n\nStaking refers to the process of locking up crypto assets in a smart contract to support network development; in return, investors earn rewards. The term can loosely be compared to investing in a fixed-income security like a government bond.\n\nLiquid staking platforms like Lido DAO allow investors to access the staked value, including the rewards earned via a derivative token, representing the claim on the assets. Users can then utilize this derivative token to generate more revenue elsewhere in the market.\n\nThe release of Ethereum staked in the Beacon chain will encourage other investors to lock up their assets. Since Liquid staking platforms make up 40% of all the staked Ether, their popularity is bound to grow.\n\nData from Messari, a crypto analytics platform, reveals that Ethereum has the lowest ratio in the Layer-1 asset class at 14%. In other words, there is a lot of room for growth in Ethereum\u2019s staking rate relative to the total supply.\n\n(1) David Alexander II on Twitter: \u201cQuick ?on the Shanghai upgrade and $ETH staking: As withdrawals on staked $ETH now have a tentative release date, this has led to increased staking activity \u2013 the highest monthly volume since April. However, this upgrade also has many implications for staking providers \u2b07\ufe0f https://t.co/A8UuSuikai\u201d / Twitter\n\nLido DAO is now at the helm of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector after displacing major platforms like MakerDAO and AAVE based on data from DefiLlama.\n\nLido DAO Price Stalls Ahead of Another Breakout\n\nLido DAO price has retreated to exchange hands at $1.35 after failing to clear resistance provided by the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (in purple) at $1.35. Profit booking could drive the pullback, but more buyers are expected to scoop up a lower-priced LDO.\n\nThe bullish outlook in Lido DAO is still intact according to the position of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator above the mean line. Similarly, a buy signal confirmed at the beginning of the year implies bulls have the upper hand.\n\nLido DAO price rally will likely continue to $2.40, a 108% falling wedge pattern\u2019s breakout target. This bullish pattern often marks the end of a substantial downtrend. Traders who fired up their buy orders above the upper trend line saw their positions immediately turn profitable and might be cashing out amid the ongoing retracement.\n\nIt is worth remembering that the 108% target equals the distance between the widest points of the wedge extrapolated above the breakout point. Traders should wait until LDO closes the bearish candle and starts printing another green candle before entering new buy orders. A break above the 200-day EMA would affirm a strong bullish grip on the price. Key resistance levels to keep in mind are $1.70, $2.10 and $3.10, respectively.\n\nAltcoins to Consider in 2023\n\nInvestors considering changing the contents of their holdings may be interested in up-and-coming altcoins with the potential to return above-average gains following their first debut on exchanges. In the presale stage, the tokens offer investors a unique opportunity to get in when the price is still very low.\n\nFightOut (FGHT)\n\nAs the fitness industry expands its wings from Web2 to Web3 platforms, it is becoming difficult for investors to decide the projects to back. However, FightOut presents a model that has yet to be seen among other M2E projects like SweatCoin, Step App and STEPN.\n\nFightOut\u2019s idea is to open the fitness industry to everybody and bring down the prohibitive costs that continue to hinder mass adoption. A fitness app will be used to track the progress of all members and distribute rewards earned by completing workouts and challenges.\n\nFightOut is conducting a presale to raise money to help develop the ecosystem and purchase a series of gyms worldwide where users can grow within a community of like-minded people.\n\nFGHT presale is underway and has raised $2.6 million by selling 1 FGHT for 1 USDT.
