Rolled out in 2009 by mysterious developer Satoshi Nakamoto [0] View all sources Bitcoin.org . Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System . Accessed Mar 17, 2022.\n\nThough it has not achieved broad adoption as a form of payment, Bitcoin has become a popular \u2014 and volatile \u2014 investment that is now even offered in some retirement plans.\n\n\u00bb Learn more: How to buy Bitcoin\n\nEthereum went live in 2015, the product of an attempt by developer Vitalik Buterin to expand on the central promise of cryptocurrency to decentralize larger swaths of the economy [0] View all sources Wired . The Uncanny Mind That Built Ethereum . Accessed May 11, 2022.\n\nEthereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, also known as Ether, can be used to pay for services or transaction fees on the network. Though its adoption in mainstream finance trails Bitcoin, many people have also used it as a speculative investment.\n\n\u00bb Learn more: How to buy Ethereum\n\nValue of Ethereum vs. Bitcoin Today\n\nThe table below shows the real-time price, 1-year return and market capitalization of Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin trade heavily on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, and market forces determine their values.\n\nEthereum has been taking a larger share of the market from Bitcoin over the past several years, though Bitcoin retains the industry\u2019s largest market value.\n\nOverall, a long-term investment in either represents the hope that their underlying technology will achieve worldwide use, increasing the demand for the limited supply of their cryptocurrency. Whether to buy either \u2014 or both \u2014 depends on your market analysis.\n\n\u00bb Ready to invest? Here are our picks for best Ethereum and cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nWhat can you buy with Bitcoin vs. Ethereum?\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin are both cryptocurrencies, so either could work for any transaction in which both buyer and seller are comfortable using it.\n\nBut overall, Bitcoin is intended as more of a general-purpose currency for everyday life.\n\nEthereum is designed explicitly for payments on the Ethereum network. That means Ethereum cryptocurrency would be better suited than Bitcoin for carrying out a transaction that relies on an Ethereum smart contract, such as funding a loan that will be automatically paid back on a specific date.\n\nAnother thing you\u2019ll do with Ethereum and Bitcoin is to pay network fees. Any time you carry out a transaction with either cryptocurrency, you\u2019ll be charged an amount that helps pay for the network's technology. These fees can sometimes come on top of whatever fee you might be paying to the crypto platform or payment provider you\u2019re using.\n\nEthereum fees have tended to be higher than those for Bitcoin. But before you complete a trade or transaction for either, it can be good to look at the network fees to see if they\u2019re running higher than usual. If it\u2019s not a time-sensitive transaction, you can sometimes save money by waiting for fees to go down.\n\nTrack your finances all in one place. Find ways to save more by tracking your income and net worth on NerdWallet. Sign Up\n\nMining and environmental impact of Bitcoin vs. Ethereum\n\nBitcoin is known as a \u201cproof-of-work\u201d blockchain project. That means users can run programs on their computers that help verify the integrity of transactions and prevent fraud. The process is known as \u201cmining,\u201d and it makes it possible for participants to receive cryptocurrency rewards in exchange. Mining uses a huge amount of energy, which has led to significant criticism of cryptocurrency in general.\n\nProof-of-stake blockchains do not require mining; instead, they use a process called staking, which incentivizes people to put cryptocurrency at stake to vouch for the accuracy of transactions. Participating users get rewards akin to interest in a bank account when the system works normally.\n\nOver time, this shift could mean that Ethereum becomes more energy efficient than Bitcoin. On the other hand, some supporters of Bitcoin argue that the process does not have to be environmentally damaging if miners use renewable energy [0] View all sources The New York Times .

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum\u2019s price shows signs of recovery, currently trading near $2,230.\n\nIncreased whale transactions indicate potential investor interest in buying amid market dip.\n\nOn-chain data points to minimal resistance until Ethereum reaches $2,800.\n\nTurning the $2,145 mark into a resistance level could undermine the current positive outlook.\n\nThe price of Ethereum (ETH) is showing signs of a recovery bounce, potentially setting the stage for a surge to new highs for the year.\n\nBoth on-chain data and technical analyses lend support to this optimistic perspective for ETH.\n\nEthereum Is Ready to Grow\n\nEthereum\u2019s price experienced a dip to as low as $2,100 on January 3, influenced by Matrixport\u2019s ETF-rejection announcement . However, similar to other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum (ETH) has shown a swift recovery. Currently (January 8 2024) trading at $2,229, Ethereum is indicating a potential for a significant upward movement.\n\nThe optimistic forecast for Ethereum\u2019s price is bolstered by a significant increase in Whale Transaction Count and Volume observed on January 3. This data, provided by Santiment , reveals the surge in transactions coincided with a substantial sell-off in the market, which is typically interpreted as investors purchasing during a price dip.\n\nGiven that the whale transaction count specifically monitors transfers valued at $100,000 or more, this increase is likely indicative of institutional investors engaging in a buy-the-dip strategy. The fact that this uptick in transactions aligns with a rise in trading volume further strengthens the argument for a bullish trend in Ethereum\u2019s market.\n\nTwo Whales Snap Up BTC and ETH Amid Price Dips\n\nOn January 5, the blockchain analytics firm Spot On Chain highlighted the activity of a significant Ethereum whale , identified as \u20180x9314\u2019. This whale invested a substantial $48 million to purchase 21,192 ETH, at an average price of $2,265 per coin. This individual has been actively accumulating Ethereum since last January, amassing nearly 80,000 ETH.\n\nThe purchases were primarily made through decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and Binance, with the whale paying an average price of $1,790 for each Ethereum.\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8 Massive whale 0x931 spent $48M to buy 21,192 $ETH at $2,265 on avg ~2hrs ago. In total, the whale has bought 79,500 $ETH from #DEX and #Binance at $1,790 on avg since Jan 13, 2023, with $36.84M (+25.9%) in unrealized profit. The purchases were financed through revolving\u2026 pic.twitter.com/mD245C060o \u2014 Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) January 5, 2024\n\nIThese purchases were funded using loans obtained from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols Aave and Liquidity. This strategy indicates a bullish outlook on Ethereum\u2019s future price. As of the report, the whale\u2019s investment has already yielded significant returns, with a profit of about 26%, amounting to more than $36.84 million.\n\nLookOnChain, another analytics firm, has pinpointed two whales who made substantial acquisitions of Bitcoin and Ethereum in the wake of their recent price declines. According to the analyst\u2019s report , these investors collectively purchased over 1,300 ETH, with each unit priced at approximately $2,225.\n\nEthereum To Jump by Over 340% in 2024?\n\nA prominent cryptocurrency analyst, known by the pseudonym Credible Crypto, has shared an optimistic prediction for Ethereum (ETH) on X. He forecasts Ethereum could reach a price of $10,000 in 2024. This prediction implies a substantial increase of more than 340% from its current price level.\n\nCredible Crypto has also shared an even more ambitious maximum price target for Ethereum in 2024. He suggests Ethereum could potentially reach $20,000. This would represent an impressive upturn of more than 780% from its current market value.\n\nAnalyzing Ethereum\u2019s short-term price movements, Credible Crypto notes that, although Ethereum established a local bottom earlier in the week at around $2,100, there is still potential for another corrective dip towards $2,160. Following this, he anticipates that Ethereum might then test its resistance level at $2,400.\n\nHe said: \u201cThink that last liquidation wick marked our bottom but at least in the short term think we may see a small move down and a bit more ranging before we are ready for the next leg up.\u201d\n\nCredible Crypto\u2019s optimistic outlook on Ethereum (ETH) is further supported also by data from Santiment . This indicates a significant accumulation of Ethereum by whales.\n\nAccording to Santiment, the top 150 self-custody wallets currently hold a record-breaking 56.25 million ETH. In contrast, exchange wallets have seen a decrease in Ethereum holdings, now containing 9.46 million ETH, marking the lowest level since June 2018.\n\nThis trend of accumulation is evident in both exchange and non-exchange wallets. Santiment reports that the top 150 whales collectively own an all-time high of 65.71 million ETH."

ETH is showing a few bearish signs and might decline toward the $2,080 support.\n\nEthereum is still struggling to clear the $2,280 and $2,300 resistance levels.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,260 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could extend its decline if it stays below the $2,300 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum Price Faces Major Hurdle\n\nEthereum price attempted a fresh increase above the $2,200 level, like Bitcoin. ETH climbed above the $2,250 and $2,260 levels. However, the bears were active near $2,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nA high was formed near $2,289 and the price recently saw a bearish reaction. There was a move below the $2,250 level. The price traded below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $1,860 swing low to the $2,289 high.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $2,260 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nIf there is a fresh increase, the price might face resistance near the $2,250 level and the trend line. The first major resistance is now near $2,280. The next major hurdle sits at $2,300.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA close above the $2,300 resistance could start a decent upward move.

Any more gains might send the price toward the $2,620 zone.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,250 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,120 level.\n\nThe first key support could be the $2,080 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $1,860 swing low to the $2,289 high. A downside break and a close below $2,080 might spark strong bearish moves. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,020 support.

He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nDespite a bearish sentiment in the crypto industry, the leader of altcoins, Ethereum, continues to display neutral price action, indicating mixed sentiments in the market. The ETH price has experienced a change of less than 2% over the last week.\n\nThe Ethereum price constantly traded in a consolidated range between $2,137 and $2,248 for a while, following which the bulls gained momentum, and the price broke out of the range. However, the rally was short-lived as the bulls faced rejection at $2,342, following which the price traded sideways for a while.\n\nAs the bearish sentiment increased, the price faced a pullback within the range where it traded for about a week. After multiple attempts, the bulls broke out of the range and recorded a jump of approximately 5% before facing another rejection at $2,342.\n\nChart: TradingView\n\nThe price then started trading in a descending pattern and tested its support level of $2,200, but the bulls held the price strong, resulting in a bounce back. The ETH price jumped over 11% within the next 24 hours, after which it faced restriction at $2,450.\n\nFollowing this, the leader of altcoins recorded a correction of over 8% in its valuation and traded sideways for a while. As the market gained momentum, the ETH price made another attempt to breach its key resistance level at $2,450 but faced rejection, highlighting a strong liquidation point at that level.\n\nAfter this, Altcoin experienced massive sales, resulting in a correction of over 8%. Since then, the price has been trading sideways in a closed range between $2,200 and $2,248, suggesting weak buying and selling pressure in the market.\n\nNegatively, the Cross EMA 50-day is a resistance line to the price chart, indicating a bear power in the crypto space.\n\nWill The ETH Price Recover?\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) displays a minor rise in the histogram, indicating an increase in the buying pressure. Further, the averages show a bullish convergence, highlighting the price may undergo massive price action in the coming time.\n\nIf the bulls break out of their important resistance level at $2,248, the ETH price will regain momentum and test its upper resistance level of $2,300 this week. Maintaining the price at that level will set the stage for the ETH price to attempt to test its resistance level of $2,342 over the coming week.\n\nNegatively, if the bears overpowered the bulls, the Ethereum price would lose momentum and fall to test its support level of $2,200. Moreover, if the bears continue to dominate the market, it will plunge and prepare to test its lower support level of $2,137 in the coming time."

        "title": "How will Ethereum price react to Bitcoin ETF approval? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is moving closer to its Bitcoin (BTC) ETF decision deadline on Jan. 10, with the market hopeful about approval. This pivotal event could have wide-ranging implications on the crypto market, including the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH).\n\nEthereum ETF hopes\n\nApproving a Bitcoin ETF could set a regulatory precedent to ease the path for other crypto-based ETFs. The reasoning is that a Bitcoin ETF approval would likely involve establishing a framework that could be applicable to other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.\n\nIn December 2023, the SEC delayed its decision on several pending Ethereum ETF applications in the U.S. to May 2024. This includes the Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF, the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF, the VanEck spot Ethereum ETF, and the spot Ethereum ETF lodged by Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest and 21Shares.\n\nThese delays are part of the SEC's process, which involves gathering public input before deciding whether these ETFs should be listed. Nonetheless, they also appear amid the commission's attempt to categorize some proof-of-stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies as securities.\n\nInterestingly, Ethereum is not named as a security in any of the SEC's recent lawsuits targeting crypto exchanges. The commission has also not challenged Ethereum's classification through the ETF registration process with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nHere we go \u2026 expect more spot #ethereum ETFs filings in the coming days.\n\n\n\nNOTE: this is an S-1 and not a 19b-4. Which means it does not start a clock in any way \u2026 yet. Expect 19b-4\u2019s soon. https://t.co/sNus2vr5qV \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) September 6, 2023\n\nThat raises the potential of seeing a spot Ethereum ETF approved in the U.S. by May 2024, a likely boost for ETH prices.\n\nEthereum-Bitcoin correlation\n\nProviding a Bitcoin ETF approval does not become a sell-the-news event, Ether's price is well-positioned for a rally because of its consistent correlation with BTC's price in recent years.\n\nETH/USD and BTC/USD's daily correlation coefficient chart. Source: TradingView\n\nFundamentally, it means a Bitcoin ETF approval may trigger a substantial increase in crypto exposure among traditional investors. In turn, that will likely lead to a surge in ETH price as the market anticipates increased demand.\n\nThe #Ethereum supply crisis on exchanges is worsening day by day.\n\n\n\nEvery day, supply is getting tighter, which indicates even stronger demand for #ETH.\n\n\n\nMassive gains ahead. pic.twitter.com/k0SQJAUDHW \u2014 Leon Waidmann | On-Chain Insights (@LeonWaidmann) January 6, 2024\n\nConversely, a delay or denial may result in short-term bearish pressure as the market adjusts to the setback. A recent Bitwise survey found that only 39% of U.S.-based financial advisers believe a Bitcoin ETF will be approved this year.\n\nEthereum price technicals hint at correction\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, ETH's price is treading near the resistance trendline of its prevailing rising wedge pattern ahead of the Bitcoin ETF decision. A delay or denial could result in the price correction toward the wedge's lower trendline near $1,865 by February.\n\nETH/USD weekly price chart.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Marathon Digital Jumped Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Several major cryptocurrencies jumped on Monday as investors anticipate the first potential approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of spot Bitcoin (BTC 2.11%) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) later this week. In particular, the SEC is widely expected to issue a favorable determination for Ark Invest's 21Shares Bitcoin ETF application before Wednesday.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin surged 6.7% by the end of the regular trading day, after briefly exceeding the $47,000 milestone for the first time since April 2022. Ethereum (ETH 1.22%) is also up more than 6%, while Marathon Digital (MARA 3.84%) -- a crypto mining firm whose fortunes tend to ebb and flow with the price of Bitcoin -- rose as much as 10.5% this morning before settling to close up 7.7%.\n\nCrypto investors have marked their calendars for Jan. 10\n\nThe price of Bitcoin alone has nearly tripled over the past year. But its rally more recently gained steam back in October 2023 after the SEC declined to appeal a federal court's August reversal of an order that had prevented crypto-asset manager Grayscale Investments from converting its popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. When the D.C. Circuit of Appeals subsequently formalized Grayscale's court win the following week, the onus moved back to the SEC to move forward with its approval processes for several other pending spot ETF applications from providers including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest.\n\nFast-forward to today's rally -- and as I noted back in October -- the first of those deadlines happens to be this Wednesday, Jan. 10. That's specifically the date by which the SEC must approve or deny Ark Invest's open application for its \"21Shares\" Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThis is a big deal for the crypto market as a whole because ETFs would be a much more accessible medium for investors to put their money to work in cryptocurrency assets, at least compared to setting up a separate crypto account or wallet with a crypto-specific broker. ETF shares can also be bought and sold throughout the trading day through virtually any broker, similar to publicly traded stocks.\n\nExpect several spot Bitcoin ETF approvals at once\n\nFew expect Ark Invest's 21Shares to be the only spot Bitcoin ETF to receive approval this week, however.\n\nThe SEC could technically approve or deny each individual spot Bitcoin ETF application as their respective deadlines arrive in the coming months. But that would also effectively mean the earliest to receive approvals enjoy a so-called \"first-mover\" advantage, with the lion's share of investors' capital flowing into those early spot Bitcoin ETFs right away. That would be a massive windfall for those ETF providers, considering some estimates indicate the approval of Bitcoin ETFs could potentially increase the value of the overall crypto market by more than $1 trillion.\n\nInstead, the SEC will almost certainly approve multiple applications in tandem with the Ark Invest 21Shares deadline this week. This scenario has been repeatedly supported by industry watchers observing several hopeful ETF providers simultaneously filing amended registration statements with the SEC over the past few months. Indeed, just last week crypto news site Cointelegraph reported that Ark 21Shares, VanEck Bitcoin Trust, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, and Fidelity's spot Bitcoin ETF each filed new 8-A Forms with the SEC to register their shares as securities listed on multiple exchanges, indicating they're in the late stages of approval.\n\nThat said, investors shouldn't ignore the risk (however unlikely at this stage) that the SEC might deny those multiple spot Bitcoin ETF applications this week. The SEC previously rejected Ark's proposal almost exactly one year ago, for example, citing a lack of measures \"to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts.\" If the regulatory body offers any similar unexpected opposition this time, I would be shocked if assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Marathon Digital didn't experience a sharp pullback as crypto investors took their recent profits off the table."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH) has found itself under the scrutiny of analysts as the digital asset hovers around crucial price levels. A prominent figure in the crypto space known as Crypto Tony on X (formerly Twitter) recently shared insights, asserting that Ethereum's bullish momentum could be initiated if it maintains a position above $2,130, with even greater optimism should it reclaim the range high at $2,500.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs of the latest market data, Ethereum is currently priced at $2,262, reflecting a modest 1.22% increase over the past 24 hours. However, the cryptocurrency has experienced a 4.29% decrease over the last 30 days, showcasing the volatility inherent in the market. The trading volume for ETH has notably surged by 75.24% in the last 24 hours, reaching $9,626,210,522, indicating heightened activity and interest in the digital asset.\n\n$ETH / $USD - Update\n\n\n\nThe ETH range is simple. Remain above $2,130 and we are bullish .. Reclaim the range high at $2,500 and we are really bullish pic.twitter.com/YKOph2YbRY \u2014 Crypto Tony (@CryptoTony__) January 8, 2024\n\nCrypto Tony's emphasis on the $2,130 and $2,500 thresholds aligns with the sentiment of many Ethereum enthusiasts, who closely monitor these levels as potential catalysts for a sustained bullish trend. The cryptocurrency community eagerly waits to see if Ethereum can not only maintain but surpass these critical levels in the coming days.\n\nPotential bullish catalyst\n\nIn a related development, the Ethereum network is on the verge of a major upgrade , known as the Prague upgrade or Pectra upgrade. This imminent update has generated considerable buzz within the Ethereum community, as it promises substantial enhancements and alterations to the platform. The Prague upgrade is anticipated to introduce improvements in scalability , security and overall functionality, which could positively impact Ethereum's price trajectory.\n\nThe potential bullish effect of the Prague upgrade on ETH's value has sparked discussions among investors and analysts, with some speculating that the impending changes could serve as a catalyst for a price surge, propelling Ethereum above current levels.\n\nWhile the market remains dynamic and unpredictable, the confluence of technical analysis highlighting key price levels and the anticipation of a major network upgrade contributes to the growing intrigue surrounding Ethereum's future price movements. Market participants are closely monitoring the developments, ready to capitalize on potential opportunities as ETH navigates these crucial junctures in the ever-evolving crypto landscape."

Therefore, retrieving Bitcoin becomes difficult, and this is bullish because its value is speculated to increase on the foundation of limited supply.\n\nMeanwhile, key indicators have popped up showing that the next price levels to watch out for Ethereum are $3,830 and $5,100, as reported by ZyCrypto.\n\nETH was hovering around $2,265 at press time, according to CoinGecko data."

The token, which currently sits at $2.97, showed a price increase of 26.9% in the last 24 hours, marking part of a rather successful year for Optimism. At the time of writing, the network boasts nearly six million addresses with a balance, reflecting a substantial 391% growth from earlier in the year.\n\nWhat a year for @Optimism!

In this transition, Lisk intends to migrate its LSK tokens onto the Ethereum platform.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/OasisProtocol/status/1737861987508560042\n\nHolding steady in the second spot is Oasis Network (ROSE), sitting at $0.1224, with a notable surge of 22.3% in the last 24 hours. Growth for the token is said to be a response to the introduction of the Universal Privacy Alliance (UPA), a coalition of web3 projects, including the Oasis Network, Protocol Labs, Filecoin Foundation, and Aztec Network led by Nym aimed to safeguard and advance digital privacy rights globally.\n\nYou might also like: Altcoins to see up to 300% rallies fueled by crypto uptrend: analyst\n\nTaking the third spot on the leaderboards is Aribtrum (ARB), currently priced at $1.34, with a price increase in the last 24 hours of 18.2%. Positioned as an Ethereum layer-two (L2) scaling solution, Arbitrum employs optimistic rollups to enhance speed, scalability, and cost-efficiency on the Ethereum network, with recent news of Arbitrum integrating NEAR Data Availability (DA) for developers engaged in building Ethereum rollups being attributed to the latest hike.\n\nRecent news in the altcoin market aligns with a video uploaded on Dec. 21, where a crypto market analyst from the well-known YouTube channel Crypto Banter expressed an optimistic perspective on the altcoin market.\n\nHighlighting the total cryptocurrency market cap, excluding Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), surpassing crucial resistance levels, the analyst suggests that this development indicates the potential initiation of a new bullish phase for altcoins.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nOn Friday, January 5, the number of Ethereum validators queuing to withdraw staked ETH surged to a record high of 16,766.\n\nBankrupt crypto lender Celsius was responsible for at least 32% of exiting validators, representing more than 200,000 ETH.\n\nThe growth of Ethereum\u2019s validator count has slowed as it approached 1 million.\n\nCelsius has staked ETH worth hundreds of millions of dollars, generating yields that have helped offset the cost of restructuring, since it filed for bankruptcy in 2022\n\nAhead of a planned distribution among creditors, on Friday, January 5, the company\u2019s move to unlock more than 200,000 ETH caused a surge in the number of Ethereum validators queuing to remove staked tokens.\n\nWait Time Jumps Amid Record-High Ethereum Validator Exits\n\nOn a normal day, there are rarely more than 1,000 Ethereum validators queueing to withdraw their staked ETH. Usually, the entire process takes less than 24 hours.\n\nIn preparation of any asset distributions, Celsius has started the process of recalling and rebalancing assets to ensure ample liquidity \u2014 Celsius (@CelsiusNetwork) January 4, 2024\n\nHowever, with a record 16,766 validators queueing to unstake Ether, on Friday the wait time jumped to nearly 6 days.\n\nAs of Monday 8, Nansen data reveals that Celsius has over 206,000 ETH awaiting withdrawal, representing nearly 32% of the total exit queue. Moreover, a further 353,000 ETH is currently being removed by the third-party staking service Figment. The platform received around 41,000 ETH from Celsius in June. While it isn\u2019t certain, it seems likely some or all of the assets Celsius staked with Figment are part of the current exit queue.\n\nCelsius Withdrawals Slow Progress to 1M Validators\n\nSince Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade first enabled the withdrawal of staked Ethereum in April 2023, the number of validators, and consequently the total amount of staked ETH, rose steadily for the next six months. The growth of Ethereum\u2019s validator network started to stall in October. Things have now been set back even further by Celsius\u2019 mass unlocking event.\n\nPost-Shapella, the number of active Ethereum validators increased from around 570,000 to over 850,000. After this, though, the rate at which fresh ETH was being staked started to slow. The next milestone occurred on January 1, when the number of active validators surpassed 900,000. But the journey to a million could prove much more arduous.\n\nAt its all-time high on January 4, the total amount of staked ETH peaked at 28.9 million, representing 24% of the total supply. That figure has since fallen by around 300,000, with a further half a million coins still in the withdrawal queue."

        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nJames Seyffart, Bloomberg ETF expert, believes the SEC had implicitly accepted $ETH as a commodity rather than a security when it approved Ethereum futures. The experts believe this is a green light to file Ethereum ETF, as it\u2019s likely to be approved.\n\nThe approval could positively impact the topmost altcoin\u2019s price action, making it one of the top crypto coins to buy now.\n\n$GFOX is another crypto coin with a promising outlook. The Ethereum-based meme token is on presale, gaining massive adoption. Galaxy Fox aims to top the 2024 ICO spot, and much is expected of it beyond that. The buzzing altcoin could yield excellent profit for its early adopters, and willing investors can still benefit from it by joining the presale.\n\nGalaxy Fox: Bringing Meme Excellence to the Web3 Ecosystem\n\nMany new-generation meme coins employ a unique approach to ensure they stand out in the saturated meme sector. From choosing uncommon themes to pioneering unique utility, you\u2019ll always find one thing that makes them incomparable to existing meme coins. This is vital in ensuring they\u2019re widely adopted and prominent in the crypto market. Galaxy Fox ($GFOX) is the latest to follow this culture.\n\nThe meme coin is fox-themed, which makes it the only one in the meme ecosystem with such a theme. Also, it has a hybrid meme-GameFi utility, which isn\u2019t widespread in the crypto landscape. Galaxy Fox aims to be a useful token across different web3 spaces. It will perform designated functions on these platforms, and the increased adoption will improve the ERC-20 token\u2019s value.\n\nIn the Galaxy Fox ecosystem, $GFOX will be a medium of earning income for members of the ecosystem. The token holders can HODL for improved profit, stake it for reward, or buy game-boosting items with it to help their gameplay. The game on Galaxy Fox will be P2E. This means you can earn while enjoying the excitement of playing the game. Galaxy Fox will have a dedicated treasury to fund the prize pool for the game.\n\nThe ecosystem\u2019s runner game will involve players running against one another. The top performers will be on the leaderboard, and the top 20% will be rewarded with the $GFOX token. The more games you play, the more $GFOX you can win, and the more ability you have to buy in-game items and increase your winning chances.\n\nGalaxy Fox will also have NFTs that can function as characters in the ecosystem, increase your winning chances, and be valuable items in exchange for real-life money. This implies that each Galaxy Fox NFT could be a valuable asset you can trade on OpenSea or other open NFT platforms. Galaxy Fox developers design the $GFOX token for growth and sustainability. They employ a smart tokenomics system with a capped supply and a surge token burn strategy. This will improve the GFOX\u2019s\u2019 value.\n\nThe buzzing meme coin is on presale, allowing investors to buy part of its available supply at a discounted price before hitting the wider market. The meme coin could be among the top crypto coins with impressive runs this year.\n\nETHER Likely to Explode With Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nWith Ethereum ETF looking likely, market observers believe paying more attention to $ETH is advisable. The high-value altcoin could experience an incredible price increase when the SEC finally approves. $ETH is currently hovering around $2,200 to $2,445 market price. The altcoin has endured a decline since the turn of the year, but its decline has been at a low rate.\n\n$ETH hopes to retest the $2,500 resistance zone in the coming weeks as it prepares to near the $3000 price zone. However, failure to break the nearest resistance could send the altcoin below $2,000. The crypto market\u2019s general decline is rubbing off on $ETH, but experts believe that could change with $ETH ETF approval. SEC verdict on applied $ETH ETF verdict isn\u2019t expected anytime soon, but analysts are still confident about its bullish potential. ETH remains the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and it could be among the profit-yielding top crypto coins this year.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the crypto community awaits Ethereum ETF approval, the $GFOX token continues its impressive ICO performance. The budding meme coin is positioned for market success and is certain to be among the top gainers upon its launch.\n\nLearn more about Galaxy Fox ($GFOX) here:\n\nVisit Galaxy Fox Presale | Join The Telegram Group | Follow Galaxy Fox on Twitter"

        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nA recent Bloomberg report suggests that Bitcoin Spot ETFs could gain approval from the US financial regulator this week. Ahead of the January 10 deadline, BTC investors await the SEC\u2019s decision on this product. This anticipation has sparked market activity, with Bitcoin\u2019s price stable above $45,000 and Ethereum aiming for $2,300. Concurrently, increased liquidations have been observed in Ethereum, as bearish traders get caught, weakening its immediate resistance levels.\n\nETH Triggers Over $7 Million In Liquidations\n\nCoinglass data reveals a surge in Ethereum liquidations following its recovery from a recent low of $2,170 to $2,277. This period saw liquidations of ETH positions worth over $7.3 million, including approximately $5.8 million in short-position liquidations by bears. This has boosted Ethereum\u2019s support level, sending its price above moving averages.\n\nA key factor in this stable buying confidence is the negative Netflow, indicating ongoing accumulation of ETH despite bearish trends. As reported by IntoTheBlock, Netflow became negative when the ETH price dropped below $2,250. In the last two days, about 25K Ethereum coins were removed from exchanges, reflecting a holding sentiment among investors.\n\nRecent data indicates a decline in interest from Ethereum whales, reaching a three-month low. The value of large transactions in USD has fallen by $3 billion to $1.74 billion. This decrease may explain why Ethereum\u2019s price hasn\u2019t been influenced by Bitcoin\u2019s recent climb above $45K, as ETH was expected to surpass $2,400.\n\nNotably, bears are strongly defending the $2,300 resistance level, as seen by the long/short ratio dropping below 1, currently at 0.8038. Bearish sentiment is gaining momentum, with approximately 55.5% of positions anticipating a price drop. On the other hand, only 45.5% of positions remain bullish about Ethereum\u2019s uptrend.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nEthereum price has successfully rebounded from the ascending support line and buyers quickly sent the price above the EMA20 trend line. However, sellers are strongly defending a surge above $2,300. As of writing, ETH price trades at $2,280, surging over 2.33 from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nCurrently, the 20-day EMA is showing minor upward activity, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers above the midline at level, suggesting potential breakout movement in the short term. Should Ethereum break above the $2,300 level, the ETH price might climb to $2,400 to test buyers\u2019 patience. Overcoming this level could pave the way for a rally towards $2,700 and possibly extend to $3,100.\n\nThe initial support lies around the $2,100 level. If ETH price fails to gain buying confidence, we might see its price declining toward the crucial support line at $1,974. However, this level might attract buying interest, resulting in a rebound.\n\nIn the short-term, Ethereum is expected to experience a significant surge, potentially surpassing the $2,500 mark and aiming for $3,000, depending upon a favorable outcome from the SEC by January 10th."

        "title": "Ethereum Giga Whales On A Historic Buying Spree \u2013 Here\u2019s How Much ETH They\u2019ve Bought - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum whales have been on a buying spree for a while now, which is an indication of their sustained support for the king of altcoins. These whale buys have particularly increased in the past few weeks. On-chain data from Santiment reveals Ethereum\u2019s largest private wallets now hold an all-time high of 56.25 million ETH, representing 46.8% of the crypto\u2019s total circulating supply.\n\nEthereum Whales Accumulate Record Amounts Of ETH\n\nEthereum is currently trading in a range, as price action shows the crypto trading between the higher end of $2,434 and the lower end of $2,127 in the past 30 days. However, the crypto is now showing signs of recovery after a recent price recovery and is now building strong momentum above $2,200.\n\nAmidst the price theatrics, Ethereum whales have been buying more ETH into their wallets to push the total count to new highs upon new highs. At the same time, these whales have been withdrawing from exchanges, causing ETH on exchange-owned addresses to drop to their lowest levels in over five years.\n\nAccording to data from on-chain analytics platform Santiment, a record 65.71 million ETH, representing 54.67% of the total circulating supply is now held by top addresses. Out of this figure, 56.25 million ETH belong to the top 150 self-custodial wallets. Consequently, the top 150 exchange-linked wallets now hold 9.46 million ETH, nearing its lowest level since June 2018.\n\nIncreasing Whale Accumulation: Possible Explanation\n\nThe crypto industry went through a strong price surge in the last quarter of 2023, flipping the optimism around most cryptocurrencies bullish. Continued whale acquisitions can be linked to an anticipated continuation of the price growth in 2024, with the imminent approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs in the US lurking in the background.\n\nETH market cap currently at $268 billion. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nThe accumulation from Ethereum\u2019s largest whales is a good sign for the long-term price, as it signals they believe the price will continue to increase. Their buying power also helps to establish price support by reducing the supply of ETH for sale.\n\nSpotonchain recently showed that an Ethereum whale, identified as \u20180x931\u2019, bought 21,192 ETH worth approximately $48 million at an average price of $2,265. The recent purchase now puts the whale\u2019s total buys at 79,500 ETH since January 2023 and is now sitting on $36.84 million unrealized profit.\n\nAt the same time, liquid staking protocols witnessed steady deposits throughout 2023. Data from DeFiLlama shows that 12.3m ETH ($27.585 billion) are currently locked in ETH liquid staking derivatives. This represents an 80% growth from 6.8 million ETH locked in January 2023.\n\nFeatured image from Pixabay\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The supply of Ethereum on exchanges has continued to decrease in the new year.\n\nThe number of daily stakes showed that the asset, once taken off exchanges, was not flowing back in.\n\nIn recent weeks, Ethereum [ETH] has witnessed a decrease in its supply on exchanges. How has this impacted the number of holders?\n\nExchanges keep getting less supply of Ethereum\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Ethereum\u2019s Supply on Exchanges shows a gradual reduction from the 1st of January, although it remained above 10 million at press time. The exchange supply stood at around 10.52 million at the beginning of the year.\n\nStill, as of this writing, it has decreased to around 10.45 million. This represented a decline from over 8% to about 7.9%.\n\nThe decreasing Supply on Exchanges indicated that holders were withdrawing their assets from these platforms at the time of the report. This could lead to increased scarcity, depending on the destination of these assets.\n\nAre more Ethereum flowing into stakes?\n\nAMBCrypto found that Ethereum\u2019s staking chart on Glassnode showed a consistent increase in stakes, with over 35.7 million as of this writing.\n\nWhile the overall growth might suggest that ETH withdrawn from exchanges was being staked, a closer look at the daily new stake numbers challenged this assumption.\n\nPost the 30th of December 2022, the chart showed a decline in new deposits, dropping below 2,000. As of this writing, the number had fallen below 1,000.\n\nThis trend suggested that not all ETH withdrawn from exchanges had been staked, at least not in its entirety and for the present period.\n\nEthereum holders keep increasing\n\nAMBCrypto also found that Ethereum holders showed sustained growth over recent months, with the press time count approaching 112 million. The chart showed an upward trend, affirming the ongoing expansion.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nThis suggested a continuous increase in wallets acquiring and holding ETH, even amid reduced Supply on Exchanges. Additionally, the Supply outside of Exchanges implied that the diminishing supply might be attributed to accumulation.\n\nAs of this writing, the Supply outside of Exchanges was over 120 million."

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price could ascend to $50,000 if SEC greenlights spot BTC ETF.\n\nEthereum price readies for a possible 10% climb to $2,500 amid rising momentum and a weakening downtrend.\n\nRipple price finds support at $0.5442, recovery rally in the works as altcoin hopes rest on SEC decision.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price remains broadly bullish, though not to its full potential, as it could spring higher on chatter about regulator approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Altcoins, starting with Ethereum (ETH) price and Ripple (XRP) price, are also poised for a positive move, with all hopes pegged to the decision expected this week from the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Spot ETF could see SEC greenlight, Grayscale Investments files amended S-3 sets 1.5% fee\n\nBitcoin eyes $50,000 amid spot ETF-related optimism\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price continues to intertwine itself with the midline of the weekly supply zone at $43,860 but could break out soon as spot ETF developments approach a deadline. The king of cryptocurrency\u2019s price has strong support provided by the 25-day and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) at $43,130 and $41,391, respectively. The inclination of these moving averages to the north show it is the path with the least resistance.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also tipping north, showing rising momentum. Increased buying pressure above current levels could see Bitcoin price make a decisive move above the critical threshold of $43,860, before an extension to the next critical range at $48,000.\n\nOnce Bitcoin price overcomes the $48,000 steeple, it could make a quick run to the $50,000 psychological level before potential profit booking. However, traders keeping their profit appetite in check could set the pace for BTC to reach the highly ambitious target of $60,000.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flipside, if early profit booking commences, instigated either by a rejection from the SEC or a delay in the decision, Bitcoin price could descend. Such a move could see it break below the 25 and 50-day EMAs before testing the confluence between the 100-day EMA and the horizontal line near the $37,800 level.\n\nHowever, for the prevailing bullish outlook to be invalidated, Bitcoin price must close below the $30,000 psychological level.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast, Analyzing possible short-term implication of probable spot ETF approval on BTC price\n\nEthereum price coils up for a 10% climb\n\nEthereum (ETH) price remains within the confines of an ascending parallel channel, with the final retest of the lower boundary of the channel possibly precipitating a 10% climb to $2,500. The RSI is moving north, evidence of rising momentum, accentuated by the falling Average Directional Index (ADX), showing that the slump that saw ETH value drop is losing strength.\n\nIncreased buying pressure could see Ethereum price shatter the $2,388 resistance, before clearing the $2,445 range high as it heads to the forecasted $2,500 target. A strong jolt past this level could see ETH market value reach $3,000.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if profit takers pull the trigger, Ethereum price could roll over, potentially losing the support at $2,135. Below this level, the cliff could send Ether to the depths of $2,000, or in a dire case, invalidate the bullish outlook by breaking and closing below $1,935.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum price could target $3,000 with ETH whales buying the dip\n\nRipple price could scale a recovery with $0.5442 support holding\n\nRipple (XRP) price may have bottomed out after the $0.5442 support came into play. The RSI edging north points to rising momentum, whereas the ADX indicator rising suggests a strengthening trend.\n\nEnhanced buyer momentum could see Ripple price overcome the critical support at $0.5784, potentially going as high as to breach the resistance due to the descending trendline and collecting sell-side liquidity around the $0.7000 psychological level.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if traders who got wrecked during the January 2 crash choose to exit the market after breaking even, XRP price could drop, with a break below the $0.5442 support exposing Ripple price to a cliff. This would expose further downside as low as the midline of the Fair Value Gap (FVG) at $0.5002. A break and close below this level would confirm the continuation of the downtrend.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple price likely to bounce 20% as balance restores in the XRP market"

        "content": "Nidhi is a Certified Digital Marketing Executive and Passionate crypto Journalist covering the world of alternative currencies. She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.\n\nIn the year 2023, Ethereum (ETH) made notable progress, though it didn\u2019t shine as brightly as some other altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX). While ETH saw an increase of about 90%, SOL surged by nearly 1000%, and AVAX rose by over 200%.\n\nLooking ahead, there\u2019s growing speculation that 2024 could be a pivotal year for Ethereum, possibly pushing its boundaries further.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nCredible Crypto, a respected figure in cryptocurrency analysis and trading, recently shared ambitious predictions for Ethereum in 2024. Through the digital platform X, he conveyed his belief that ETH could reach a minimum of $10,000 this year. This projection would signify a substantial 343% rise from its current value.\n\nAdditionally, he presented a maximum target of $20,000 for ETH in 2024, indicating a potential growth of 786%. Examining recent trends, Credible Crypto pointed to a price bottom near $2,100 for ETH. He expects a possible rise to $2,160 before targeting a breakthrough above the $2,400 resistance level. This positive perspective aligns with data from the blockchain analytics firm, santiment santiment On-Chain , which suggests an increased accumulation of Ethereum by major holders.\n\nWhat are the Ethereum Whales Up To?\n\nSantiment\u2019s data indicates that the top 150 self-custody wallets now hold a record 56.25 million ETH. In contrast, the amount held in exchange wallets is at its lowest since June 2018, standing at 9.46 million ETH. When combined, these top 150 holders collectively own 65.71 million ETH, marking a new high in their holdings. As of the latest update, Ethereum is valued at $2,255.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Prediction for 2024: Can Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Roadmap Lead ETH to $5000?\n\nFactors Influencing Ethereum\u2019s Potential Growth\n\nEthereum\u2019s potential ascent to $10,000 in 2024 is based on several factors. Firstly, there\u2019s anticipation of a positive market reaction if the SEC approves a spot Bitcoin ETF and Bitcoin undergoes its halving event. Such developments could trigger a market momentum similar to the one observed in 2021. If Bitcoin achieves a new peak, it\u2019s likely that Ethereum will follow a similar path.\n\nAdditionally, the potential approval of an ETH ETF, with interest from significant entities like BlackRock and the SEC\u2019s acknowledgement of Ethereum\u2019s commodity status, may facilitate a more favorable environment for Ethereum, potentially aiding its upward trajectory."

Nonetheless, these adverse trends were balanced by an upthrust in the market valuation of Polygon\u2019s native token, $MATIC, escalating its market cap beyond $8 billion.\n\nThe differing trends in Polygon\u2019s NFT environment highlight the intricate dynamics involved. Despite a reduction in the \u201cMarket Value to Realized Value\u201d ratio and the weighted sentiment, the price of the $MATIC token has displayed an upward trajectory, and its high social volume denotes a cautiously upbeat expectation for future expansion.\n\nDespite the contrasting market movements, the mood within the ecosystem remains optimistic regarding potential growth, considering the tightening rivalry in the crypto space and the advancement of Polygon as a key Layer-2 system in this swiftly evolving industry.\n\nWant more?

        "content": "ETH was down by more than 1.5% in the last seven days.\n\nIf ETH initiates a bull rally, it might face resistance near $2,300 and $2,400.\n\nThe year 2024 began on a sweet note as Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] value surged above $2,400. However, the king of altcoins witnessed a price correction, pushing its value under $2,300 once again.\n\nWhile this happened, an interesting whale activity occured.\n\nEthereum\u2019s chart turns red\n\nAfter a comfortable beginning in 2024, ETH fell victim to a price correction on the 3rd of January. Because of the price correction, ETH\u2019s value plummeted by more than 1.6% in the last seven days.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, at the time of writing, Ethereum was trading at $2,243.76 with a market capitalization of over $269 billion. Amidst this, Lookonchain recently posted a tweet highlighting an intriguing development.\n\nAs per the tweet, Paradigm deposited 6,500 ETH on Coinbase, which was worth more than $14.6 million. If historical data is to be considered, Paradigm has always bought ETH during bear markets and sold ETH in bull markets to earn profits.\n\nTherefore, since Paradigm dumped ETH, does this mean a larger sell-off is on its way?\n\nAre whales selling Ethereum?\n\nAMBCrypto planned to check Ethereum\u2019s whale activity to see how they were behaving. Notably, Ali, a popular crypto analyst, posted a tweet on the 6th of January, which revealed a promising development.\n\nAs per the tweet, in the past month, Ethereum whales bought over 410,000 ETH, worth nearly $1 billion. This showed that the whales were stockpiling ETH in hopes of a bull rally.\n\nOur analysis of Santiment\u2019s data painted a similar picture. AMBCrypto found that whale activity around the token remained high, as evidenced by the spike in its Whale Transaction Count.\n\nIts supply held by top addresses also increased last week, meaning that whales were accumulating more ETH until press time.\n\nNot only the whales, but the market at large also seemed to have been buying Ethereum. The token\u2019s Supply on Exchanges dropped last week, while its Supply outside of Exchanges increased.\n\nAlso, AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of CryptoQuant\u2019s data showed that ETH\u2019s net deposit on exchanges was low compared to the last seven-day average, clearly reflecting high buying pressure.\n\nTo top it off, ETH\u2019s Coinbase Premium was in the green, which meant that buying sentiment was dominant among US investors at press time.\n\nIt was interesting to note that on the one hand, buying pressure on ETH was increasing, while on the other hand, the blockchain\u2019s network activity declined.\n\nAMBCrypto had earlier reported that BNB Chain [BNB] has surpassed Ethereum in terms of user activity over the past month. As per the data, only 1.28 million active addresses transacted on Ethereum, witnessing a 13% drop in user activity.\n\nWill high buying pressure initiate a bull rally?\n\nWhile buying pressure increased and prices sank, ETH\u2019s derivatives market metrics somewhat turned bullish. For example, ETH\u2019s Open Interest dropped along with its price. Such instances indicate an increased chance of a trend reversal.\n\nIts BitMEX Funding Rate also declined last week, and market sentiment around the token remained bearish, as shown by the dip in Ethereum\u2019s Weighted Sentiment.\n\nIf we consider that ETH will soon begin a bull rally, it would still have quite a few barriers to overcome to skyrocket its price. To find that, AMBCrypto took a closer look at ETH\u2019s liquidation heatmap.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nOur analysis found that if a bull run is bound to happen, ETH would face a strong resistance level near the $2,300 mark. And if it goes above that level, then ETH\u2019s would face its next barrier at $2,400.\n\nThe last time ETH\u2019s price touched those levels, its liquidation spiked sharply."

This event was closely followed by the launch of the BONK BONK/USD meme coin on Dec. 14, 2023, which led to a complete sell-out of Solana\u2019s Saga phone, as certain airdrops aimed at mobile device holders.\n\nAmidst this, there was a notable uptick in transaction volume among Solana\u2019s decentralized applications, standing resilient even as rival blockchains such as Arbitrum, zkSync, and BNB Chain faltered under increased December activity.\n\nThe decline in investor interest became evident post the airdrop euphoria with Jito JTO/USD, DogWifHat WIF/USD, and BONK notes facing dips of 40%, 41%, and 44% respectively.\n\nWhen delving into Solana\u2019s total value locked (TVL), a downward trend has been noted. The TVL, measured in SOL, hit a peak of 15.4 million SOL on December 19, 2023, but subsequently descended by 17%, landing at 12.8 million SOL on January 5, 2024.\n\nSee More: Dogecoin HODLERs Are Beating Shiba Inu With 57% Landing In Profits, IntoTheBlock Data Reveals\n\nWhy It Matters: American broadcaster and filmmaker Max Keiser revisited an earlier statement on X, succinctly echoing his previous sentiment, stating, \"The rug pull has begun, anon.\"\n\nA pseudonymous analyst known as Pentoshi shared a perspective on SOL\u2019s potential trajectory. \"SOL update #1 Not sure we get as low as I have here, but do expect at some point to be able to bid in the $70\u2019s. Looking forward to not just trading sol, but holding some ecosystem coins for the next year or so,\" Pentoshi remarked.\n\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $89 down 12.50% on Sunday, according to Benzinga Pro.\n\nRead Next: Here\u2019s How Much You Should Invest In Shiba Inu Today For A $1M Payday If SHIB Hits 1 Cent?"

        "content": "Regarding user activity, BNB Chain has exceeded Ethereum in the last month.\n\nDemand continues to propel BNB rally on a weekly chart.\n\nBNB Chain [BNB] has surpassed Ethereum [ETH] in terms of user activity over the past month, data from blockchain analytics firm DappRadar has shown.\n\nAcross all the decentralized applications (dApps) listed on BNB Chain, a total of 4.18 million unique active wallets completed at least one transaction in the last 30 days, marking a 29% uptick in user count.\n\nDuring the same period, only 1.28 million active addresses transacted on Ethereum, witnessing a 13% drop in user activity.\n\nDue to the double-digit increase in its number of users, the number of transactions completed on BNB Chain during the period under review totaled 22 million.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum saw its transaction count decline by 44% to record only 3.34 million transactions in the last 30 days.\n\nRegarding network fees and revenue derived from the same, BNB Chain received $18.35 million in fees from its users in the last 30 days. This represented a 50% growth in month-over-month (MoM) fees paid by its users to use its network.\n\nFrom these fees, the chain saw a revenue of $2 million from these fees.\n\nDue to its lower user activity, Ethereum\u2019s fees and revenue climbed by just 10% in the last month, according to data from Token Terminal\n\nBNB on a weekly chart\n\nAt the time of writing, BNB traded at $305.80, logging a 31% price rally in the last month, per data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe coin\u2019s price assessed within a wider time frame (weekly) showed that despite the 3% price correction recorded in the last week, accumulation persisted.\n\nThe coin\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) rested above their center lines, suggesting that buying activity exceeded distribution.

        "content": "What Is NEO?\n\nNEO is a blockchain developed to fully digitize assets and identities through smart contracts, which will facilitate the emerging smart economy. In the theory behind a smart economy, digital assets and digital identities are seen as being essential to improving the quality of life for everyone.\n\n\n\nNEO aims to automate digital asset management through smart contracts, with the eventual goal of building a distributed, network-based, smart economy system using decentralized applications.\n\nKey Takeaways NEO is a blockchain ecosystem designed to be used to build a smart economy.\n\nNEO has two native tokens. NEO is used to establish ownership and management roles in the blockchain, and NEO Gas is used to pay for transactions on the blockchain.\n\nNEO defines a smart economy as one that uses smart contracts to manage and secure digital identities and assets.\n\nUnderstanding NEO\n\nNEO was founded as AntShares by Da Hongfei and Erik Zhang in 2014. It was rebranded to NEO in June 2017. It is a blockchain-based platform that supports two native tokens, NEO and NEO Gas. The NEO project's blockchain is designed to digitize identities and assets and use smart contracts to track and transfer ownership\u2014a smart economy.\n\nNEO originally described its smart economy system as:\n\nDigital Assets + Digital Identity + Smart Contract = Smart Economy.\n\nDigital Assets\n\nDigital assets are not only digital property but are also physical assets tokenized by transferring their value to the blockchain and having it issue a token for each asset. Tokenization creates a decentralized, trustworthy, traceable, and transparent manner for asset management, free of intermediaries and their associated costs.\n\nUsers can record, buy, sell, exchange, or circulate various assets. NEO developers believe this digitization supports asset protection because they are registered on its platform, giving them a validated digital identity.\n\nDigital Identity\n\nDigital identity enables verifiable key information about participating individuals, organizations, and other entities that exist in the digital context. The developers believe that securing individual information through blockchain, consensus mechanisms, and encryption methods is essential as life becomes more and more digital.\n\nNEO and NEO Gas are not minable cryptocurrencies. There will only be 100 million NEO\u201450 million of which went to fund-raising supporters, and the remaining 50 million are for developers, cross investments, and contingencies. NEO Gas is awarded for blockchain work and transaction fees. However, you can purchase NEO on exchanges.\n\nNEO uses the Public Key Infrastructure standard (X.509) as a guide for managing identities by creating encrypted private and public keys used to verify identities. Digital identities can be verified using facial recognition, fingerprints, voice, SMS, and multi-factor identification methods.\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nSmart contracts are code that automatically execute transactions and agreements between different parties. Smart contracts remove the requirement for third-party involvement because transfers are automatically completed. They also allow traceability, transparency, and transaction irreversibility.\n\nHow Is Neo Different From Bitcoin and Ethereum?\n\nNEO maintains a clear distinction from other standard blockchain platforms in its focus on being regulatory-compliant and a development platform for decentralized applications. It also uses a different consensus mechanism than Bitcoin and Ethereum, called delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT).\n\nDelegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance\n\nRather than use a system like proof-of-work where random numbers are generated in a competitive bid to open a new block on the blockchain, Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBZT) designates nodes in consensus rounds using a \"staking\" method similar to proof-of-stake to achieve a majority agreement of more than two-thirds.\n\nTo address the issue of non-reliable validators (the Byzantine General Problem), consensus nodes with NEO Gas staked are randomly chosen for consensus rounds to validate transactions and open new blocks.\n\nThe NEO dBFT is reportedly capable of achieving 1,000 transactions per second (TPS), compared to Bitcoin's much slower three to seven TPS.\n\nEthereum\n\nWhile digitized assets and smart contracts are popular on the Ethereum blockchain, the third key feature of what it calls \u201cdigital identity\u201d separates NEO from the rest. Every participant operating on the NEO platform must have a unique digital identity that can be verified\u2014which means that you must enter information unique to you to receive a public key, somewhat reducing the anonymity provided by other blockchains.\n\nEthereum is designed to be scaled for any application a person can think of, be it new currencies, non-fungible tokens, decentralized apps, or something as of yet uninvented. NEO claims to be focused on facilitating a smart economy.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin was created to be a decentralized digital currency and uses proof-of-work in its consensus mechanism. It has one cryptocurrency that is used as a reward for mining\u2014the process of validating transactions and opening new blocks on the chain. The NEO network is less dependent on processing power for validation, so transaction costs and times are much lower.\n\n\n\nIs NEO a Good Crypto? Whether NEO is a good crypto depends on your risk tolerance, cryptocurrency outlook, and what you intend to use it for. It might increase in value, or it might not. NEO is designed to track and transfer asset ownership but also has a market value.\n\nHow Many NEO Coins Are Left? There were 50 million coins issued to project backers, and 15 million are held for contingencies. In addition, there are 20 million being used to incentivize developers and 15 million for cross-investing in other projects. No other coins will be issued, but NEO is available on some exchanges.\n\nWhat Is NEO in Crypto? NEO is a cryptocurrency used to incentivize the development of the NEO smart economy blockchain.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nNEO is a blockchain designed to create a smart economy by digitizing assets and identities and introducing interoperability\u2014the ability for different blockchains to communicate with each other.\n\n\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently offered some words of wisdom for navigating the crypto markets amidst economic uncertainty. His advice blends traditional investment strategies with a nuanced understanding of digital assets. Buterin stresses the importance of diversification, savings, moderation, and financial safety.\n\nKeypoints\n\nDiversify your investments across different sectors to mitigate risk\n\nAccumulate enough savings to cover multiple years of expenses for financial safety\n\nHave a \u201cboring\u201d portfolio focused on steady, reliable long-term investments rather than thrill-seeking\n\nDon\u2019t use more than 2x leverage when trading crypto to avoid excessive losses\n\nSpreading assets and having multiple income sources is better than relying on a single one\n\nFirst and foremost, Buterin advocates diversifying across different sectors to reduce risk. With new cryptocurrencies launching daily in an ever-evolving landscape, spreading assets across various areas can hedge against volatility. Buterin cautions against putting all your eggs in one basket. This aligns with proven investing principles in traditional finance.\n\nAdditionally, Buterin underscores accumulating substantial savings \u2013 enough to cover multiple years of expenses. With cryptocurrency prices and job markets increasingly unpredictable, having this financial safety net provides freedom. It\u2019s a buffer for riding out downturns when investing returns decline. Buterin sees this as the true meaning of financial freedom.\n\nThis is awful advice. Some actual financial advice: * Diversification is good.\n\n* Save. Get to the point where you have enough to cover multiple years of expenses. Financial safety is freedom.\n\n* Be boring with most of your portfolio.\n\n* Don't use >2x leverage. Just don't. https://t.co/CIvDJcD3UG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 7, 2024\n\nFurthermore, Buterin recommends keeping most crypto portfolio allocations in \u201cboring\u201d assets, not thrill-seeking speculative bets. Though overnight crypto millionaire stories spark excitement, Buterin calls for responsible long-term positions focused on steady returns. Moderation and prudence should prevail over gambling on ultra-high risk holdings.\n\nFinally, the Ethereum founder warns strongly against using over 2x leverage when trading crypto futures. With such high volatility, excess leverage can lead to devastating liquidations, wiping out positions. Buterin insists on maintaining this boundary for long-term sustainability over short-term windfall bets.\n\nButerin blends traditional wisdom with crypto-specific advice: diversify wisely, accumulate ample savings, keep allocations moderate, and avoid extremes of leverage. Follow these tips from one of crypto\u2019s leading pioneers to navigate uncertainty and come out ahead.\n\nThe key is prudent, balanced investing for sustainable gains rather than resorting to excess speculation. Buterin offers guidance for both newcomers and veterans alike facing the digital asset frontier."

        "content": "Celsius, once a prominent player in the cryptocurrency lending space, has embarked on a significant move to unstake and potentially sell a vast amount of Ethereum (ETH), estimated at nearly $470 million. This decision is a critical part of the company\u2019s bankruptcy process, which ensued following allegations of mismanagement and the subsequent arrest of its founder, Alex Mashinsky, for fraud.\n\nThe Unstaking Strategy: A Path to Liquidity\n\nIn an effort to repay its creditors, Celsius is liquidating its assets, including its Ethereum holdings. The company had been leveraging these assets for income through staking, a method where cryptocurrencies are used to support blockchain network operations in exchange for rewards. The unstaking process is intended to increase liquidity, a necessary step for the repayment process.\n\nIn preparation of any asset distributions, Celsius has started the process of recalling and rebalancing assets to ensure ample liquidity \u2014 Celsius (@CelsiusNetwork) January 4, 2024\n\nNansen\u2019s Insights: A Glimpse into Celsius\u2019s Ethereum Holdings\n\nBlockchain analytics firm Nansen has shed light on the scale of Celsius\u2019s undertaking, revealing that the company is set to unstake 206,319 ETH. This move is crucial for customers who have been awaiting the return of their funds for over a year and a half. According to the recovery plan, these creditors are slated to receive distributions in both Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nSource: Nansen.ai\n\nMarket Impact and Future Outlook\n\nThe decision to unstake such a significant amount of Ethereum has sparked mixed reactions. While some express concern over its potential market impact, others anticipate a positive long-term effect on the Ethereum market. This action is a key component of Celsius\u2019s strategy to navigate its bankruptcy and meet its obligations to creditors.\n\nConclusion\n\nCelsius\u2019s decision to unstake a large portion of Ethereum marks a pivotal moment in its journey through bankruptcy proceedings. It reflects the company\u2019s commitment to resolving its financial obligations and the ongoing evolution of the cryptocurrency market. As Celsius continues to address its challenges, the crypto community watches closely, anticipating the broader implications of these actions on the market and investors.\n\nMore from Ethereum"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price is currently finding it difficult to rally higher following weeks of aggressively bullish price action. Yet, there are still several support levels nearby that could keep the cryptocurrency from dropping lower.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily timeframe, the price has been on the rise since breaking above the 200-day moving average and the large descending channel. While ETH is still trading above the key $2,000 level, it is going through a consolidation phase below the $2,400 level, failing to climb higher.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index is also hovering around the 50% level, pointing to an equilibrium in momentum. As a result, the short-term price action heavily depends on whether the cryptocurrency drops below the $2,000 level or successfully breaks above the $2,400 level to target the $2,700 resistance zone.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nLooking at the 4-hour chart, it is evident that the price has been oscillating between the $2,100 and $2,400 levels over the last month. Following the recent rapid drop toward the former area, ETH has rebounded and is consolidating in the middle of the range.\n\nTherefore, while the market structure is still relatively bullish, things could go either way, depending on the direction of the potential breakout from the mentioned range.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum Open Interest\n\nEthereum has undergone a significant uptrend in recent months, surging from below $1K to over $2.4K. Currently, the price is exhibiting uncertainty about its future trajectory, prompting a closer look at futures market sentiment for valuable insights.\n\nThe provided chart illustrates the open interest metric across all exchanges, counting the number of open futures contracts regardless of trade direction. Higher values indicate confidence among futures traders regarding the trend, while lower values suggest uncertainty. Additionally, increased open interest correlates with heightened price volatility, raising the likelihood of liquidation cascades.\n\nWhile the price has been on an upward trend, open interest has consistently risen, indicating a bullish market sentiment. However, a recent phase of sideways consolidation has coincided with a notable decline in open interest. This suggests that many long positions have been flushed out, indicating a healthy futures market, potentially paving the way for a renewed impulsive trend. The direction of the upcoming trend, however, remains uncertain until the funding rate metric experiences a notable move, either above or below one."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is on track to chart a new recovery path with an ongoing mega accumulation by the whales within its community. According to top market analyst Ali Martinez, Ethereum Whales have accumulated over 410,000 ETH units over the past month.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Whales: Catalysts for Growth\n\nThe total Ethereum (ETH) whale accumulation is valued at $920,745,200, a sum significant enough to shift the price of the cryptocurrency by some fraction of a percentage. According to the shared charts, the valuation boost of whales ranging from 1000 to 10,000,000 Ethereum units is at its highest level since at least 24 November 2023.\n\nadvertisement\n\nFrom that time until now, the coin\u2019s price has been erratic, rising to a high above $2,400 sometime on December 9 before experiencing a bearish correction as we have it today. At the time of writing, Ethereum is changing hands for $2,251.76, up 0.81% in the past 24 hours.\n\nEthereum\u2019s growth has been mixed with many uncertainties as it has exhibited a stronger-than-expected correlation with Bitcoin in recent times. Rebounding to its current level from a 24-hour low of $2,219.78, Ethereum\u2019s short-term growth trend has trailed that of Bitcoin but the revived interest from its whales can change the narrative moving forward.\n\nOther crucial on-chain metrics include the Daily Active Addresses which, according to the crypto analytics platform, IntoTheBlock (ITB) is up by 2.21% to 480,990. The ITB data also confirmed the Ethereum (ETH) whales transaction which has seen a 15.83% jump in the past 24 hours with over $4.79 billion traded.\n\nEthereum Getting Interesting Updates\n\nWhile the Ethereum (ETH) whales outlook shows interesting trends ahead owing to the shrinking supply by these accumulations, Ethereum is also getting a series of other fundamentals that can ultimately help bolster the network moving forward.\n\nAs reported earlier, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has hinted at one of the latest focuses that the Layer-2 scaling solutions resident on the blockchain should focus on. This focus should be hinged on developing Ethereum Name Service (ENS) for these L2s in the hope of bolstering further adoption and ease of use.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum is also anticipating a spot ETF product that might see the light of day if spot Bitcoin ETF is approved as currently widely speculated."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin offers four financial tips to help new and seasoned investors mitigate risks amid massive volatility in the crypto space.\n\nThe Ethereum boss shared the tips after famous blogger Alexander Voigt highlighted how diversification strategy helped Microsoft founder Bill Gate to build his net worth.\n\nHow Microsoft Founder Boosts Portfolio Using Diversification Strategy\n\nVoigt noted that when Gates became friends with prominent American businessman Warren Buffett, he sold most of his Microsoft shares. According to Voigt, the move helped Gates to diversify his portfolio and acquire other stocks.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAs a result of the decision, the Microsoft founder built his fortune to $138 billion. Voigt emphasized that Gates would have been worth only $1.33 billion if he did not diversify his portfolio.\n\nEthereum Founder Reacts, Offers 4 Financial Tips\n\nReacting, Buterin characterized Voigt\u2019s financial tip as awful. However, he offered four tips, which he described as \u201cactual financial advice.\u201d\n\nThis is awful advice. Some actual financial advice: * Diversification is good.\n\n* Save. Get to the point where you have enough to cover multiple years of expenses. Financial safety is freedom.\n\n* Be boring with most of your portfolio.\n\n* Don't use >2x leverage. Just don't. https://t.co/CIvDJcD3UG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 7, 2024\n\nThe Ethereum founder first recognized the importance of diversification. Diversifying one\u2019s portfolio cannot be overemphasized, as it helps mitigate risks. Spreading your investment across various assets would ensure that the negative performance of one asset does not entirely affect your portfolio.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSecondly, Buterin pointed out the importance of saving. He recommended that people should accumulate sufficient funds to the point where they can cover multiple years of expenses. It bears mentioning that there is no guarantee in investing, given the recent economic downturn that has wreaked havoc on most financial markets. Hence, saving more could help shield one from the problems associated with investing.\n\nFor the third point, Buterin encouraged investors to be boring with most of their portfolios. The concept of being boring with one\u2019s portfolio suggests that people should opt for low-cost and low-risk assets. Here, Buterin recommends that people be prudent with investing instead of committing their funds to high-risk assets.\n\nLastly, the Ethereum founder warned against using high leverage when investing in the futures markets. Specifically, he cautioned against using over 2X leverage. This advice is necessary, especially in crypto trading, where volatility is rife. Recall that following a 7% dip in Bitcoin price last week, over $655 million worth of long positions were liquidated. The majority of long traders who got liquidated were mainly those who used high leverages.\n\nButerin\u2019s financial tips are suitable for both new and seasoned crypto investors. They serve as a reminder, urging people to be prudent as they seek to bolster their portfolio."

        "content": "Ethereum, a leading cryptocurrency, has been on an upward trajectory for the past few months. The cryptocurrency value has soared from under $2,000 to $2,400, indicating a positive trend. However, the current market displays mixed sentiments about its future direction. The digital currency has been fluctuating within a defined range, showing signs of both strength and uncertainty.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Ethereum price value has impressively hit $2,270, marking a 0.78% increase in just 24 hours. This rise suggests a positive market mood. The trading volume, according to data by CoinMarketCap, has also seen an 84% jump in the same period, reaching $509 million. With a market capitalization of $10 billion, Ethereum ranks second among cryptocurrencies.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDespite these gains, Ethereum faces a consolidation phase, especially under the $2,400 mark. The leading smart contracts token has been oscillating between $2,100 and $2,400 in the past week, with bears and bulls struggling. In the past year, Ether experienced a significant increase of over 79%, demonstrating resilience and optimism as bullish sentiment prevails despite occasional minor dips.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s Investment Tips for Ethereum Enthusiasts\n\nVitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, recently shared some investment wisdom. This came after a noted blogger, Alexander Voigt, discussed how diversification aided Bill Gates in wealth accumulation. Buterin, however, termed Voigt\u2019s advice as subpar and offered his own financial guidelines.\n\nThis is awful advice. Some actual financial advice: * Diversification is good.\n\n* Save. Get to the point where you have enough to cover multiple years of expenses. Financial safety is freedom.\n\n* Be boring with most of your portfolio.\n\n* Don't use >2x leverage. Just don't. https://t.co/CIvDJcD3UG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 7, 2024\n\nButerin\u2019s tips are simple yet profound. He emphasizes the importance of diversification, suggesting that a varied portfolio can reduce risk. He advises investors to save enough to cover multiple years of expenses, stressing the value of financial safety and freedom. Buterin also recommends keeping the bulk of one\u2019s portfolio in stable investments and strongly advises against using more than 2x leverage.\n\nThese guidelines are particularly relevant for both new and seasoned investors in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Adhering to such prudent strategies could potentially pave the way for Ethereum\u2019s price to surge past the $3,000 mark. If the bullish trend persists, this milestone could soon be within reach.\n\nEthereum Technical Indicators Supporting a Bullish Outlook\n\nTechnical analysis of Ethereum\u2019s price movement adds another layer of optimism. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently around the 50 mark, suggesting a balance in market momentum. On a 4-hour chart, Ethereum\u2019s price has increased since breaking above the 200-day moving average and exiting a major descending channel. This bullish trend is visually evident through the formation of three four-hour green candlesticks.\n\nMoreover, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line has overtaken the signal line, indicating a positive market outlook. The rising histogram supports this bullish sentiment. The 20 Simple Moving Average (SMA) is on an upward curve, and the 50-day MA crossing over the 200-day MA reaffirms the bullish market sentiment. The Chaikin money flow indicator is also in the positive region at 0.04, indicating a bullish outlook.\n\nRelated Articles"

As these tokens ride the wave, investors seek the best crypto to invest in for optimal returns. Explore these promising opportunities now!\n\nETH Rebounds After Flash Crash \u2013 Eyes Set on $2,500 Amidst Bullish Momentum\n\nIn recent developments, Ethereum (ETH) faced a substantial flash crash, experiencing a 14% correction on January 3, 2023, causing concerns among investors. This sharp decline saw ETH price plummet from a daily high of $2,380 to $2,050 in less than two hours, triggering a volatile market reaction. Analysts attributed this plunge to external factors such as global market uncertainties, regulatory developments, and profit-taking sentiments among traders.\n\nDespite the sudden decline, ETH showcased resilience by recovering from $2,050 to a high of $2,371.81 before settling around $2,237 at the time of writing.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin (BTC) whales are slowly taking profits amid the upcoming ETF approval. Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) also saw some respectable profit taking on the market. However, all the assets show stable performance. Meanwhile, Pushd (PUSHD) has entered the new stage of its presale launch.\n\nSolana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) Enter New Market Stage\n\nSolana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) have long been perceived as competitors as both blockchains build out their respective robust smart contract platforms with a variety of decentralized applications. Solana (SOL), for instance, has risen in value by 1,100% from January to December 2023, while Ethereum (ETH) is up by approximately 80% within the same time frame.\n\nThe start of 2024 has seen Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) undergo a period of price adjustment, with SOL and ETH experiencing a 17% and 3% decrease in their trading value over the last two weeks, respectively. This trend reflects a strategic move by Solana investors to capitalize on their investments, while Ethereum maintains a steady, though unhurried, progression at the beginning of the year. Notably, prominent crypto influencer Raoul Pal holds an optimistic view on the future trajectory of these cryptocurrencies. He suggests that both Solana and Ethereum have the potential to revisit their peak prices within the year, particularly if a bull market is stimulated by the anticipated Bitcoin halving in April. This event, often a significant milestone in the crypto market, could potentially herald a period of robust growth for these leading digital assets.\n\nIs a Bitcoin (BTC) ETF Approval Imminent?\n\nBitcoin (BTC) holders are most definitely bullish in 2024, especially as speculations of an imminent approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission intensify. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) rallied throughout 2023 off the back of the speculation, with the token recording a 160% increase in price from January to December 2023. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently ordered prospective Bitcoin ETF aspirants to make certain changes to their filings ahead of a crucial week which hint at an approval in the making.\n\nPushd (PUSHD) Enteres Presale\n\nThe Pushd (PUSHD) new stage presale is live. Pushd is building the world\u2019s first viable decentralized alternative to Web2 ecommerce platforms. The Pushd marketplace features low platform fees, minimal listing charges and KYC processes, and a user experience tailored for both crypto natives and newbies. PUSHD presale investors are incentivized by revenue sharing on the Pushd marketplace, giving them a bigger income the more PUSHD tokens they hold.\n\nAccording to developers, PUSHD is on pace to sell out stage 2 of its presale token allocation. With over 8,000 registrants and counting, PUSHD is quickly gaining its market share.\n\nFind out more about the Pushd presale at their official website."

        "title": "Ethereum Forecast Today- 08/01: Finds Buyers on Dips (Chart) - DailyForex.com",
        "content": "On Friday, Ethereum's market experienced an initial dip, reflecting the ongoing volatility pervasive across the cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nDespite this turbulence, the 20-Day Exponential Moving Average has played a pivotal role in providing the necessary support to reverse the pullback, at least so far.. Notably, the $2100 price level stands out as a critical focal point for market participants.\n\nThis level holds significance not only due to its historical role as a resistance barrier but also because it aligns with the 50-Day EMA, thereby reinforcing its importance within the market's collective memory.\n\nExamining the candlestick pattern, it bears resemblance to a hammer, indicating a recurring phenomenon where a substantial number of buyers surface whenever prices experience a downturn. Immediate resistance levels are discernible around the $2400 mark, followed by the psychologically significant milestone of $2500, which is anticipated to attract significant attention.\n\nPay close attention to the movements in Bitcoin\n\nThe movements in the Bitcoin market warrant close attention, as Bitcoin often sets the tone for the broader cryptocurrency landscape, Ethereum included. It appears that traders are still placing their bets on the possibility of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund, with the expectation that Bitcoin's performance will influence the trajectory of the entire crypto market. Ethereum enjoys a unique advantage as it serves as a foundational element for numerous smaller crypto projects. Consequently, Ethereum stands to gain significantly as long as the broader cryptocurrency sector maintains its vitality, given its high utility within this ecosystem.\n\nForex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list\n\nIn summary, Ethereum's market continues to be characterized by noise and fluctuations. However, there remains a resilient pool of buyers, ready to seize opportunities presented by lower prices. Shorting Ethereum does not appear to be a prudent strategy in the near term. Nevertheless, it is essential to remain vigilant, particularly in the event that Ethereum's price falls below the $1900 level, as such a development may necessitate a reevaluation of what to do with crypto in general as we will continue to see a lot of noisy movement. I think this year is going to be difficult to hang onto, but it\u2019s also worth noting that the momentum is most certainly to the outside and that\u2019s probably the most important thing when it comes to crypto as it is momentum driven market.\n\nReady to trade our ETH/USD forecast?

        "content": "Loading... Loading...\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic hit businesses and consumers with job cuts, layoffs and business closings. The impact continues to be felt today with higher inflation and a tight job market coming after the pandemic.\n\nTo help mitigate the impact of the pandemic, the U.S. government sent out several stimulus payments to help individuals and families deal with rising costs and job losses.\n\nWhile the stimulus payments were meant to help with everyday spending and bills, Americans who received the payments were free to do with the money as they wished, potentially investing it if they did not need the money at the current time or putting it into savings.\n\n\n\nWhat Happened: In 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Act (CARES Act) was signed into law. Under the law, Americans received a total of three stimulus payments.\n\nMany used the money for bills and savings, but some also turned to investing in stocks and cryptocurrencies at the time.\n\nThe CARES Act paid out $1,200 to eligible adults and $500 more for those with qualifying children for its first stimulus payment.\n\nThe subsequent Tax Relief Act of 2020 paid out an additional $600 per eligible adult and up to $600 more for those with qualifying children in December 2020. The American Rescue Act of 2021 provided an additional $1,400 payment to eligible adults and up to $1,400 for those with qualifying children.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the return a consumer would have if they put their stimulus checks ($1,200, $600 and $1,400) into leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin BTC/USD, Dogecoin DOGE/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD.\n\nThe hypothetical results are based on the dates of April 11, 2020; Dec. 29, 2020; and March 12, 2021, for the stimulus checks.\n\nRelated Link: EXCLUSIVE: Why Does Cathie Wood Think Bitcoin Is Going To $1 Million \u2014 What Does She Know That We Don\u2019t?\n\nStimulus Checks in Bitcoin: Investing in Bitcoin with a portion of the stimulus checks may have been a popular option for investors and people looking to store some of the payment away or get involved in the cryptocurrency market for the first time.\n\nBitcoin traded at $6,926 on April 11, 2020, $27,370 on Dec. 29, 2020, and $57,996 on March 12, 2021. A person who put all $3,200 from the stimulus checks into Bitcoin would have been able to purchase a total of 0.219 BTC.\n\nBased on a price of $46,975.28 for Bitcoin today, that $3,200 would now be worth $10,287.59, gaining 221.5%.\n\nLoading... Loading...\n\nStimulus Checks in Dogecoin: The meme cryptocurrency known as Dogecoin gained interest and value in 2021 thanks to retail investors and vocal public supporters like Mark Cuban and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Here's how stimulus checks in Dogecoin would have fared.\n\nDogecoin traded at $0.0020 on April 11, 2020, $0.0046 on Dec. 29, 2020, and $0.0570 on March 12, 2021. A person who put all $3,200 from the stimulus checks into Dogecoin would have been able to purchase 754,996 DOGE. Based on a price of $0.08107 today, that $3,200 would now be worth $61,207.53, gaining 1,812.7%.\n\nStimulus Checks In Ethereum: One of the fastest-growing cryptocurrencies in 2021 was Ethereum, thanks to its connection to non-fungible tokens. Here's a look at how stimulus checks invested in the second-largest cryptocurrency would have fared.\n\nEthereum traded at $161.17 on April 11, 2020, $737.95 on Dec. 29, 2020, and $1,839.50 on March 12, 2021. A person who put the $3,200 into Ethereum would have been able to purchase 9.02 ETH. Based on a price of $2,353.96 for Ethereum today, that $3,200 investment would now be worth $21,232.72 today, gaining 626.0%.\n\nStimulus Check In All 3 Cryptocurrencies: A more diversified approach from an investor could have seen investments in Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Ethereum. Splitting the $3,200 into equal investments of the three cryptocurrencies on the respective stimulus payout days would have given an investor 0.0731 BTC, 251,665 DOGE and 3 ETH. The three cryptocurrencies would be worth $20,898.25 today based on equal investments from the three stimulus checks.\n\nThis represents a return of 865.8% for investing the stimulus checks in the three cryptocurrencies.\n\nRead Next: EXCLUSIVE: The Man Who Bets Against Cathie Wood, Jim Cramer Filed For New Bitcoin ETFs \u2014 How Leveraged ETFs Are An Investment Tool\n\nPhoto: Unsplash"

        "title": "What is VeChain, and how does it work? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The fundamental traits of blockchain technology, including decentralization, immutability, transparency and automation, have proven to be capable of several use cases for different businesses. However, due to the costs of creating and maintaining blockchain-powered applications, it can be difficult and expensive for enterprises to fully utilize its benefits.\n\nWith the adoption of distributed ledgers, many projects have made efforts to lower the barriers to entry. VeChain is one such blockchain platform built to improve the widespread use of blockchain technology.\n\nOne of the most significant issues facing supply chain organizations is a lack of transparency, which blockchain aims to resolve by enabling businesses to conduct transactions directly and without a third party. It also allows data sharing between stakeholders and supports increased integration of financial and logistical services.\n\nThis article will discuss what the VeChain public blockchain is, the unique features of VeChain, how VeChain (VET) works, how to buy VeChain and how VeChain staking works.\n\nWhat is VeChain?\n\nThe public blockchain called VeChainThor is intended for widespread use of blockchain technology by companies of all sizes, acting as the building block for a resilient and expandable enterprise blockchain ecosystem.\n\nAccording to VeChain, Ethereum remains unsuitable for running large-scale commercial decentralized applications (DApps) while being a significant technological milestone. This is because Ethereum does not have a robust governance framework to allow for quick and transparent protocol changes to address emerging issues or breakthroughs.\n\nAlso, an appropriate economic model is absent in the Ethereum blockchain, restricting businesses from operating their DApps at a controllable and predictable cost. In addition, given how volatile the price of Ether (ETH) is, companies may not forecast future ETH prices or the expense of maintaining an Ethereum-based decentralized application for a specific time. So, what makes VeChain unique?\n\nThe VeChainThor blockchain hopes to address the above issues using meta-transaction features, a proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus method, an on-chain governance mechanism and a unique two-token system.\n\nVeChain meta-transaction features\n\nFor enterprise adoption, VeChain\u2019s meta-transaction features, as discussed below, help make the development user-friendly:\n\nMulti-party payment: A decentralized application\u2019s freemium model is enabled by flexible transaction fee delegation schemes to onboard users smoothly. With VeChain\u2019s innovative fee delegation protocol, an enterprise can have a smart contract and designated gas account to manage the gas fees necessary to use the network.\n\nControllable transaction lifecycle: Users can set the time when a transaction is executed or expires if it is not included in a block using the Expiration and BlockRef transaction fields.\n\nMulti-task transaction: Developers can batch payments, include many calls to various contract functions in a single transaction and control the order of the calls using multi-function atomic transactions.\n\nTransaction dependency: Users can set dependencies to stop transactions from being executed until the relevant transaction has been processed, ensuring that the execution order satisfies the business need.\n\nVeChain POA consensus mechanism\n\nVeChain\u2019s PoA consensus mechanism has evolved from PoA 1.0 to PoA 2.0. The original PoA 1.0, implemented at the launch of the VeChainThor blockchain in 2018, relied on Authority Masternodes for block validation, offering efficiency and low energy consumption but facing scalability and financial limitations.\n\nPoA 2.0, introduced in 2022, enhanced the system by improving scalability, security and data finality. It addressed the challenges of PoA 1.0 and aimed to offer a more robust consensus mechanism, reflecting VeChain\u2019s commitment to continuous technological evolution.\n\nVeChain governance\n\nThe community-elected Steering Committee, elected by stakeholders, is responsible for strategic decision-making and overseeing VeChain improvement proposals (VIPs). The key benefits of such a system include lower organizational and technical development uncertainty due to role-based voting.\n\nAdditionally, VeChain\u2019s model includes community engagement through tokenholder voting, allowing broader participation in key governance decisions.\n\nVeChain dual token economy\n\nThe VeChain ecosystem comprises two tokens: VeChain Token (VET) and VeChainThor Energy (VTHO). VET is the primary token for carrying value, or \u201csmart money,\u201d within the ecosystem, enabling investment, transactional activities and stakeholder voting. VTHO, on the other hand, is used as the energy or \u201cgas\u201d to power transactions and smart contracts on the VeChainThor blockchain.\n\nVTHO is generated by holding VET, and it provides a mechanism to decouple the cost of using the blockchain from the market price of VET, thereby stabilizing transaction costs and facilitating efficient resource allocation within the ecosystem.\n\nHow does VeChain work?\n\nLet\u2019s understand the workings of VeChain using supply chain management as an example:\n\nUnique identification creation\n\nA unique identification number is given to each product or batch. This might be a near-field communication (NFC) chip, a radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag or a quick response (QR) code. This identifier is essential for monitoring the product\u2019s progress along the supply chain.\n\nData capture and recording\n\nRelevant data is recorded at every stage of the supply chain, including manufacturing process details, batch numbers, expiration dates, storage circumstances, transit information and other facts. After that, this information is stored on the VeChain blockchain.\n\nBlockchain entry\n\nThe captured data is stored on the VeChain blockchain. Every record is time-stamped and connected to the one before it, forming an unchangeable and transparent chain of records.\n\nSmart contracts activation\n\nOn the blockchain, smart contracts are pre-written agreements that take effect automatically if specific requirements are met. In the supply chain, this could mean releasing payments, notifying stakeholders when a product reaches a particular location or automatically updating the status of a product.\n\nReal-time tracking and verification\n\nReal-time tracking and verification are possible for all parties involved in the supply chain, including customers, distributors, manufacturers, suppliers and retailers. They can confirm the product\u2019s background and other information by accessing the blockchain.\n\nEnd-user interaction\n\nTo confirm a product\u2019s legitimacy, provenance and other pertinent information, end users can engage with its blockchain record, even by using a smartphone app. This promotes consumer confidence and product authenticity.\n\nContinuous updates and audits\n\nThe product\u2019s record on the VeChain blockchain is updated continuously as it progresses through its lifecycle. Due to this ongoing process, the data is updated and auditable for compliance, quality assurance and other uses.\n\nIn VeChain\u2019s supply chain management, Know Your Customer (KYC) processes are crucial for verifying the identity of businesses and stakeholders, ensuring that only legitimate entities participate in the network.\n\nVarious nodes (such as Authority Masternodes and Economic Nodes) on the blockchain record transactions within this ecosystem. This system maintains the integrity and transparency of the supply chain data, with smart contracts automating key processes like confirming deliveries or payments, ensuring efficient and secure transactions without intermediaries.\n\nBut, is the VeChain network secure? VeChain works with a number of security companies, including Hosho, SecureWare, SlowMist and HackenProof, to find potential vulnerabilities and proactively prevent cyber threats.\n\nWhat is the VeChain ToolChain?\n\nVeChain ToolChain is the key product offered by the VeChainThor blockchain platform. Designed for accessibility, the ToolChain caters to businesses of all sizes, enabling them to implement blockchain technology effortlessly, with applications ranging from product lifecycle management to carbon credit solutions and environmental sustainability reporting.\n\nVeChain ToolChain provides platform-as-a-service (PaaS), software-as-a-service (SaaS) and blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) to create new strategies for generating value for various stakeholders, promote transparency, and offer insights into product life cycles.\n\nFor instance, VeChain\u2019s low-code deployment PaaS allows customers to design process templates and use the built-in tools to avoid creating their own blockchain applications from scratch. In addition, its Food Safety Track & Trace SaaS offers the food and beverage industry a range of easily deployable traceability features, such as quality certificates, to communicate and reliably increase brand recognition.\n\nThrough BaaS, VeChain offers a restful API for standardized smart contract services. Two computer systems use the restful API, an application programming interface, to exchange information safely over the internet.\n\nHistory of VeChain: Who is behind VeChain?\n\nSunny Lu, former chief information officer of Louis Vuitton China, and Changpeng Zhao, Chinese-Canadian founder and ex-CEO of Binance, founded VeChain in 2015 as a subsidiary of Bitse, an organization that provides blockchain-powered solutions. The VEN token once operated on the Ethereum platform, but in 2018, VeChain switched to its own blockchain and rebranded itself as the VeChainThor blockchain.\n\nVET, the main token, has a fixed max supply, with a portion in circulation and the rest allocated for enterprise investors, the team and ongoing development. VeChain implements a VTHO burning mechanism to maintain equilibrium, where a portion of VTHO used in transactions is destroyed, balancing the supply-and-demand dynamics and ensuring the stability of transaction costs.\n\nVeChainThor is used in various industries, including agriculture, pharmaceuticals and automobiles, to improve supply chains\u2019 effectiveness, transparency and affordability. Utilizing RFID sensors, the blockchain tracks goods along the supply chain to guarantee proper handling and authenticity. This adoption by several Fortune 500 companies, including BMW, Walmart, LVMH, Deloitte, Renault and PricewaterhouseCoopers, reflects its real-world application and effectiveness\u200b.\n\nRelated: How blockchain technology is used in supply chain management\n\nHow to buy VeChain (VET)\n\nDepending on your jurisdiction, choose a crypto exchange that supports VeChain (VET) cryptocurrency and download a wallet to store your tokens. Alternatively, storing your tokens in the exchange wallet is an option; however, it comes with the risk of \u201cnot your keys, not your coins.\u201d\n\nVeChain has also developed the VeChainThor Wallet specifically for its own cryptocurrency, which is compatible with both Android and iOS. However, VeChain tokens are incompatible with wallets like MetaMask since VET and VTHO are not based on the Ethereum blockchain. The final step is to purchase VET tokens for the amount you desire and transfer them to the wallet of your choice for safekeeping.\n\nTo buy VeChain (VET) on Coinbase, the key steps include the following:\n\nAccount creation: The individual should download the Coinbase app and initiate the sign-up process, providing a valid ID and, if required, proof of address. The ID verification process may vary in duration depending on the user\u2019s location.\n\nAdd a payment method: The user needs to add a payment method by selecting the payment method box in the app. Available options include linking a bank account, using a debit card or initiating a wire transfer.\n\nInitiating a trade: On the Coinbase website, the user should select \u201cBuy and Sell.\u201d The mobile app achieves this by tapping the \u201c( + ) Buy\u201d option on the \u201cHome\u201d tab.\n\nSelecting VeChain: To choose VET, the user should use the \u201cBuy\u201d panel on the website or the search bar in the app to find and choose VeChain.\n\nEntering purchase amount: The individual must input the desired expenditure in their local currency. The app automatically calculates the equivalent amount in VeChain.\n\nFinalizing the purchase: The user can review the details by tapping \u201cPreview buy.\u201d They confirm the transaction by clicking \u201cBuy Now\u201d if all is satisfactory.\n\nConfirmation: After the order is processed, a confirmation screen appears, indicating the successful purchase of VET.\n\nApart from buying VET, can you make passive income with VeChain? Typically, users must first buy other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and then trade their BTC for VET after locating a wallet or exchange that supports VeChain staking. There aren\u2019t any staking pools where one can combine VET investments to earn more VTHO, unlike other cryptocurrencies.\n\nRelated: How to earn passive crypto income with Bitcoin\n\nDoes VeChain have NFTs\n\nAlong with VeChain\u2019s use cases in the supply chain, its nonfungible token (NFT) ecosystem is also thriving. For creating and trading VIP-181 tokens that are kept on the VeChain blockchain, there is a decentralized NFT marketplace called VeSea. The VeChain Foundation introduced the VIP-181 Standard, which enables fundamental functionality for tokens within smart contracts.\n\nNFT marketplaces: VeSea and World of V\n\nVeSea is a decentralized NFT marketplace on the VeChain blockchain where users can buy, sell and discover VeChain NFT collections, including VeKings, Veysarum and others. Users require a VeChain-compatible wallet to interact with NFTs on VeSea. VeChain Sync2 and VeChainThor Wallet are among the compatible wallets.\n\nWorld of V is another VeChain NFT marketplace that is compatible with the Sync2 wallet. This platform facilitates the creation and collection of NFTs with no gas fees. It supports the minting of new NFT projects and allows NFT owners to stake their NFTs in the creator ecosystem.\n\nNFT collections: VeKings and Paper Project\n\nThe VeKings collection initially consisted of 9,999 artworks of vikings and valkyries issued by the creators of the VeSea NFT marketplace. This collection has undergone periodic burn events, reducing the total supply. As per VeChainstats.com, there are 6,866 NFTs in circulation, with 3,133 NFTs burned.\n\nThe Paper Project Alpha Collection is an interactive work by Emmet Ahlstrom, an artist residing in Southern California. This collection consists of 11,880 individually generated NFTs.\n\nWhat is the VeUSD stablecoin?\n\nStablecoin VeUSD was created on the VeChainThor blockchain with the goal of offering a stable digital currency choice for users within the VeChain network. Announced on Jan. 5, 2022, VeUSD is pegged 1:1 to the United States dollar, ensuring its value remains stable against the fiat currency. This peg is maintained through equivalent reserves of U.S. dollars, which back the stablecoin.\n\nVeUSD was officially launched for public minting on March 14, 2022, marking a significant development in the VeChain platform. It seeks to provide the advantages of cryptocurrencies, such as digital speed, ease of use and security while avoiding their notorious volatility.\n\nVeUSD enhances the utility and scalability of the VeChain network by being utilized for various transactions inside the VeChain ecosystem, such as payments and remittances, and serving as a reliable medium of exchange for decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.\n\nIs VeChain (VET) a good investment?\n\nVeChain aims to accelerate the mass adoption of blockchain technology by addressing issues such as the high cost of maintaining an Ethereum-based DApp. Despite VeChain\u2019s use cases in supply chain management and other industries, investment choice depends upon one\u2019s financial objectives and risk-return profile.\n\nThat said, investing in a cryptocurrency in which you feel you need more confidence can be risky, and you may lose your hard-earned money. Therefore, determine your asset-allocation decisions based on your expectations for returns on your investment.\n\nThe future of VeChain\n\nVeChain is a layer-1 smart contract platform that allows developers to create unique smart contracts and DApps on top of it. Its applications in logistics, supply chain management and other industries help businesses enhance their operations. However, from an investment perspective, one must always weigh the pros and cons before making portfolio allocations.\n\nAs the future is uncertain, the same goes for VeChain; it cannot be predicted if VeChain will become the new Ethereum. Whatever the case, it will be exciting to see how VeChain will compete with its rivals and offer distinct solutions to achieve a competitive edge."

Thus far in 2023, cryptocurrencies have seen a major uptick, largely Bitcoin, which is up 163% YTD (December 9) at $43,519, on the back of the upcoming SEC approval for the first Bitcoin spot ETF, opening up the near $40 trillion retirement fund market to the crypto asset class, possible rate cuts in 2024 and the impending halving that will reduce the rate at which new Bitcoins enter into circulation. Ethereum saw two declines in value during August and September, dipping to a low of $1,540 on September 11. It has since seen a rebound to $2,266. The two currencies continue to corner a chunk of the overall crypto market cap at $851 billion and $272 billion, respectively. Back home, with the introduction of 30% tax along with 1% TDS on crypto investment, the government has delivered a body blow to the frenzy that Indians had shown towards digital currencies. With the Prevention of Money Laundering Act coming into play as well, the crypto story for Indian investors is as good as over. The interest shown by HNIs, too, has waned with most wealth managers not officially advocating cryptos, and instead encouraging Indians to invest in U.S. equities."

        "title": "Surfing the New Wave: Why Artists Should Embrace Solana and Other Blockchains - NFT Culture",
        "content": "Riding the Shift from Ethereum to Solana in the NFT World\n\nIn the dynamic realm of NFTs, artists are often confronted with the challenge of finding the right platform to showcase their work. While Ethereum (ETH) has long been a dominant force in the NFT space, recent trends indicate a shift in energy and excitement towards alternative blockchains like Solana. This shift underscores a crucial message for artists: adaptability is key, and venturing into new territories can be a game-changer.\n\nThe Rise of Solana: A Beacon for NFT Artists\n\nThe past few months have seen a substantial increase in collector activity on platforms like @exchgART, particularly within the Solana ecosystem. This uptick is more than just a fleeting trend; it represents a significant movement of collectors exploring alternatives to Ethereum. Solana\u2019s appeal lies in its cost-effectiveness and faster transaction times, making it an attractive option for both artists and collectors. As the NFT landscape evolves, Solana is quickly becoming a hub of innovation and engagement.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Challenges: A Call for Diversification\n\nDespite Ethereum\u2019s pioneering role in the NFT space, it faces challenges that can be daunting for emerging artists. High gas fees and a highly competitive environment, coupled with a currently lower collector base, make it difficult for new entrants to gain traction. This situation necessitates a strategic pivot, encouraging artists to explore other blockchain ecosystems where opportunities are burgeoning.\n\nEmbracing Change: The Importance of Exploring New Frontiers\n\nThe key takeaway for artists is clear: to stay relevant and successful in the NFT market, one must go where the people \u2013 and in this case, the collectors \u2013 are heading. Solana, with its growing collector base and artist-friendly environment, presents a compelling alternative. But the exploration shouldn\u2019t stop there. The NFT world is vast, with numerous other blockchains offering unique opportunities. Artists must remain agile, continually seeking new ideas, wallets, chains, and communities to engage with.\n\nTLDR: As the NFT landscape shifts, with excitement and energy moving from Ethereum to Solana, artists must embrace this change to thrive. Exploring Solana and other blockchains is not just an option but a necessity for artists seeking growth and engagement in the evolving NFT market."

        "content": "Polygon (MATIC) NFT sales volume has surpassed Ethereum for the first time.\n\nThe record-breaking run is tied to a newly launched game by STEPN developers.\n\nThe game has been driving activity on the network for weeks.\n\nThe Polygon (MATIC) NFT ecosystem is starting 2024 on a high, picking up from where it left off in 2023. After finishing the previous year with NFT sales volume at a ten-month high, Polygon\u2019s NFT ecosystem has now kicked off the new year with another significant milestone, with its sales volume surpassing that of the Ethereum blockchain for the first time.\n\nWhat\u2019s Driving the Polygon (MATIC) NFT Buzz?\n\nAs highlighted in an X post on Sunday, January 7, by Today In Polygon, at some point in the past 24 hours, the NFT sales volume of the Polygon (MATIC) network surpassed that of Ethereum for the first time, recording a 24-hour sales volume of over $10.25 million compared to the latter\u2019s $10.16 million.\n\nJUST IN:\n\n\n\nPolygon has flipped Ethereum in 24 hour NFT sales volume for the first time in history. pic.twitter.com/Apf8GoLwhp \u2014 Today In Polygon (@TodayInPolygon) January 7, 2024\n\nPolygon\u2019s record-breaking run is tied to Gas Hero, a newly launched massive multiplayer online game (MMO) on the network. At the time, CryptoSlam data showed that four of the game\u2019s NFT collections ranked second, third, fourth, and sixth in sales volume across all blockchains. With a combined volume of over $8 million, these four collections accounted for over 80% of Polygon\u2019s NFT sales volume within the period.\n\nNFT collections ranked by 24-hour sales volume. Source: Today In Polygon\n\nAt the time of writing, Polygon (MATIC) has slipped back into third place behind Ethereum in the 24-hour NFT sales volume ranking. However, the Gas Hero Common Heroes collection on Polygon now sits atop the list of NFT collections by sales volume in the past 24 hours, ahead of Bitcoin\u2018s Uncategorized Ordinals.\n\nWhy Gas Hero Is Driving Activity on Polygon (MATIC)\n\nAs has been covered in previous reports by DailyCoin, Gas Hero has been driving NFT activity on Polygon for the past few weeks, not just the past 24 hours, as Find Satoshi Labs kicked off multiple promotional activities to whip up excitement ahead of the game\u2019s launch. Confidence in the game\u2019s prospects is also likely bolstered by the success of Find Satoshi Labs\u2019 other projects.\n\nThe firm had developed the popular STEPN project, which took the crypto space by storm in early 2022. The firm\u2019s latest venture, Gas Hero, was launched in public beta on January 3.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nPolygon has failed to sustain its leap over Ethereum.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the Gas Hero hype can be sustained.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nSurpassing Ethereum in NFT sales volume represents a significant milestone in Polygon\u2019s ecosystem growth and adoption.\n\nRead this for more on the Polygon NFT ecosystem and the Gas Hero hype:\n\nPolygon Hits 10-Month NFT Sales Peak in Strong 2023 Finish\n\n\n\nLearn about Bitget\u2019s plans for 2024:\n\nHere\u2019s How Bitget Plans to Build on Its 2023 Milestones"

        "content": "Amid what has been a rather volatile start to the year for digital assets across the board, one analyst has projected that Solana (SOL) could be prepping a 50x surge in 2024. Indeed, the often labeled \u201cEthereum killer\u201d could be following the same trajectory that led ETH to earn 50x returns in 2018.\n\nThe asset saw a positive end to 2023 and could be preparing to go on an extended rally. Moreover, many have observed the potential for the asset to even surpass Ethereum. Especially if it can mirror the bull run that propelled ETH. Still, some obstacles may hinder an eventual rally; let\u2019s explore more of what those could be.\n\nSource: Observatorio Blockchain\n\nAlso Read: Solana: Will SOL Reclaim its All-Time High of $259 in 2024?\n\nSolana Could Mirror Ethereum 2018 Run to REach 50x Gains in 2024\n\nThe optimism for Solana has been immensely high as we are just one week into the new year. Along with the overall crypto market, there are high expectations on how several assets could perform throughout the year. Moreover, one analyst has pointed to the Ethereum killer for its immense potential.\n\nIndeed, analyst Raoul Pal believes that Solana (SOL) could be poised for a 50x surge in 2024. Moreover, he notes that the asset could parallel the 2018 surge that propelled Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Ethereum to new heights. Additionally, traders are preparing for renewed funds to enter into the ecosystem as the year progresses.\n\nAlso Read: Solana Holds Steady Above $100; Will SOL Hit $130 Soon?\n\n\u201cSo I just flip up the chart of ETH in 2018, and then put it against the chart of Solana,\u201d Pal said. \u201cThey are pretty much identical. ETH did 47x from that low.\u201d Subsequently, Solana could begin to flourish as an Ethereum alternative. Its closed system, passionate community, and lower gas fees have already created stiff competition between the two.\n\nConversely, some believe inflation of the SOL token could hinder any sort of rally. When SOL reached its previous all-time high in 2021, it had a market cap of more than $75 billion. Now, it would require a market cap of $111 billion in order to reach a new all-time high above $260. Although not impossible, it certainly begins to hinder expectations for the asset ceiling throughout 2024."

        "title": "Top Picks for Massive Gains in January \u2013 Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ethereum (ETH), and Pullix (PLX) - CryptoDaily",
        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nAlthough the year is just starting, crypto traders and investors are already searching for the best crypto to buy. Unfortunately, there are so many projects to pick from. This article has highlighted three top coins and why they are a good pick. They are Shiba Inu, Ethereum, and Pullix.\n\nCan Shiba Inu (SHIB) Token Burn Increase Price in January?\n\nThe Shiba Inu (SHIB) community is still burning Shiba Inu coins in 2024. On January 5th, they burned 5,203,527 SHIB, which increased the burn rate by 2,274.64%.\n\nOn January 1st, 2024, there was another big increase in the burn rate. It increased by 2,555%, with a massive 129,716,497 SHIB being burned. Regretfully, despite the rise in token burn, the price of Shiba Inu remains stagnant.\n\nHowever, the SHIB community thinks the team's automated token burn mechanism will accelerate the burn pace. If this happens, there may be fewer Shiba Inu coins, which would lead to scarcity. There are two potential price points: $0.00001893 and $0.00002091.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Prediction\n\nEthereum (ETH) is showing bullish signs as it tries to bounce back from its recent fall. Both on-chain data and technical indicators are backing up this positive view for the ERC20 coin. The Awesome Oscillator (AO) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) are rising.\n\nAdditionally, Santiment data shows that whale accumulation has increased as they buy the dip. Ethereum's price is now trading at $2,200 in the meanwhile. This occurs subsequent to the altcoin's price decline from the $2400 range.\n\nAnalysts and investors are still optimistic about the coin. Additionally, the Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) indicator from IntoTheBlock indicates that Ethereum faces little to no resistance going forward. The resistance level of $2,347 is not very strong. Therefore, if it crosses it, the price of Ethereum might rise to $2,400, $2,562, $2,652, and $2,859 if the momentum picks up.\n\nPullix (PLX) To Give 100x Gains After Its January Launch\n\nJust like Shiba Inu and Ethereum, Pullix (PLX) is also gearing up for a price surge this month. Recently, the token soared to $0.08. Currently, bulls are aiming for more gains. Let us dive into some features that make Pullix a worthy coin for gains this January.\n\nPullix combines the best parts of decentralized (DEX) and centralized exchanges (CEX), giving users a full trading experience. Pullix is notable for its wide variety of assets you can trade. This includes digital currencies, stocks, forex, ETFs and commodities. This makes it simple for people to get into different financial markets all in one platform.\n\nPLX is an essential component of Pullix. It's an ERC20 coin that's crucial to everything in the Pullix ecosystem. Pullix offers a \"Trade-to-Earn\" system that is made possible with PLX. The more you trade on the platform, the bigger your gains from the platform's profit share.\n\nPullix also provides a solution for copy trading that employs artificial intelligence. Pullix is incorporating artificial intelligence to assist traders in replicating the moves of seasoned specialists. This is a bonus because they've had a lot of successful transactions, which can help you make better deals and earn more money.\n\nPullix's PLX is now available on presale, and the exchange becomes available in January. PLX is currently valued at $0.08. However, the exchange gives it the potential to become one of the best crypto to buy in 2024 with analysts tipping the presale gem to 100x upon launch.\n\nConclusion\n\nBecause of its connection to the global market, Pullix is one of the best altcoins you can invest in this January. Another good option is Ethereum. However, With Pullix looking to launch this month, experts think the token will grow 100x after they release the exchange.\n\nFor more information regarding Pullix\u2019s presale see links below:\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Major cryptocurrencies spiked on Monday evening amid growing anticipation for the approval of a spot-based BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EST) Bitcoin BTC/USD +6.45% $46,527 Ethereum ETH/USD +4.71% $2,309 Dogecoin DOGE/USD +2.28% $0.079\n\nWhat Happened: The rally occurred as investors eagerly await a regulatory decision for the first spot-based bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S., expected sometime this week.\n\nMost market observers anticipate approval, with bulls predicting that these funds would significantly broaden the investor base for the asset and attract substantial inflows.\n\nToday, major asset management companies like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale submitted updated S-1 filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Multiple issuers also disclosed the fees they would charge investors.\n\n\n\nTwo days before the SEC is expected to approve one or more spot Bitcoin ETFs, all potential issuers have disclosed a crucial detail about their product: the fee, and they vary significantly.\n\n\n\nAmong the 13 proposed ETFs awaiting SEC approval or rejection, the fee they charge is a key factor in setting them apart from one another. Lower fees, calculated as a percentage of the fund\u2019s assets, mean more returns for investors.\n\nBitwise, a crypto native fund manager, stands out by charging the lowest fee at 0.24% after a 6-month period of no fees. However, some of its rivals are not far behind. Ark and 21Shares plan to charge 0.25%, while VanEck and Franklin list their fees at 0.25% and 0.29% respectively.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, has set its fee at 0.30%, which is lower than what some experts had anticipated, considering its size and reputation could have allowed it to charge more and still remain highly competitive in popularity.\n\nTop Gainer (24 Hour)\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EDT) Astar ASTR/USD +26.85% $0.14 Bitcoin SV BSV/USD +22.41% $90.08 Stacks STX/USD +21.26% $1.97\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.63 trillion, showing a slight decline of 1.71% in the past 24 hours.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, major stock averages showed an increase, mainly driven by the performance of technology shares, as Wall Street aimed to bounce back from a challenging week. The S&P 500 concluded with a 1.41% gain, closing at 4,763.54, while the Nasdaq Composite surged by 2.2%, ending the day at 14,843.77, marking the tech-heavy index\u2019s most substantial one-day gain since Nov. 14.\n\nThis week, traders are anticipating increased clarity regarding potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The release of the December consumer price index on Thursday and the producer price index on Friday will provide crucial insights into whether the central bank\u2019s efforts to stabilize inflation at its 2% target are yielding results.\n\nSee More: Best Cryptocurrency Scanners\n\nAnalyst Notes: Cryptocurrency analyst Michael Van de Poppe said that a Bitcoin Spot ETF is on the horizon for approval, \"which is true legitimacy for an asset created out of the Financial Crisis of 2008 only existing for 15 years. The upcoming bull cycle is likely going to be glorious.\"\n\nCryptocurrency analyst Carl from the Moon said \"If the ETF is denied on Wednesday then that would be the biggest manipulation\" of Bitcoin so far.\n\nAccording to on-chain analyst Ali Martinez, regardless of the outcome of the Bitcoin ETF, we can look forward to another bullish trend this year: The BTC Halving. \"It has historically been a catalyst for major price surges.\"\n\nPhoto by Igor Faun on Shutterstock\n\nRead Next: Jim Cramer Advises Against Using Binance, Provokes Strong Reactions From Twitter Users"

The 19b-4 filing represents one of the last stages in the SEC\u2019s approval process. This step could potentially pave the way for the first-time approval of the funds in the U.S. this week, as Reuters reported, citing sources.\n\nBalchunas notes that the final S-1 documents from the asset managers are due at 8 am on Monday.\n\nTop Gainer (24 Hour)\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EDT) Siacoin SC/USD +21.04% $0.009752 Bitget Token BGB/USD +0.69% $0.61 Stacks STX/USD +0.64% $1.62\n\nThe global crypto market cap has reached $1.66 trillion, marking a 4.80% decrease in the last 24 hours.\n\nU.S. stock futures showed little change Sunday night following a down week for the major averages in 2024.

Meanwhile, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures saw increases of 0.14% and 0.21%, respectively.\n\nCongressional leaders announced a deal on Sunday, agreeing on a $1.59 trillion top-line spending to prevent a potential government shutdown.\n\nThese developments come after the year-end rally, during which a dovish pivot from the Federal Reserve raised concerns among investors about equities being overbought. Additionally, a strong December jobs report and Fed meeting minutes indicating uncertainty about the future of rate cuts added to these worries.\n\nThe December consumer price index is scheduled for release on Thursday, and the producer price index is due on Friday. These reports will provide insight into whether the Fed\u2019s efforts to bring inflation down to its 2% target are succeeding.\n\nSee More: Best Cryptocurrency Scanners\n\nAnalyst Notes: Cryptocurrency analyst Michael Van de Poppe predicts a significant impact on the crypto markets due to the Bitcoin ETF. \"Approx. $30-60 billion in liquidity flowing into the markets, through which Bitcoin will face a bull cycle comparable to the http://Dot.com bubble or Gold in 2004-2011.\"\n\nAnalyst PlanB predicts a 10x price surge for Bitcoin (BTC), citing multiple bullish indicators.\n\n\"Bitcoin's growth used to be 100x in the first couple of bull markets, but lately that has slowed down a little bit to 10x, a little bit under 10x. I don't expect diminishing returns because we're at 2 or 3% adoption, and if we follow the logistic S-curve and Metcalfe's law, we can't have diminishing returns below 50% adoption, so we'll have exponential growth for a couple more years. I expect a nice 10x that brings it to somewhere in the $100,000 to $1 million range.\"\n\nAs we near ETF week, brace for significant volatility in the Bitcoin market, with alternative cryptocurrencies being influenced by its movements. This prediction comes from CrediBull Crypto, another pseudonymous analyst.\n\n\"For ETH- something like this seems most plausible and should coincide with the local breakdown on ETH/BTC mentioned in my post below. It would make sense for BTC to break local highs following ETF approval while alts led by ETH lag a bit and then ultimately follow BTC up.\"\n\nData from Santiment, a blockchain analytics firm, has indicated, \u201cBitcoin is mildly declining as the weekend kicks off, and there may be some volatility ahead with whale transactions hitting their highest level since June 12, 2022. When whale activity spikes, prices often foreshadow a breaking cycle.\u201d\n\nRead Next: Jim Cramer Advises Against Using Binance, Provokes Strong Reactions From Twitter Users\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock"

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nEthereum Insider Steven Nerayoff has threatened to release more evidence on the alleged irregularities involving the network. His comment suggests that this evidence could have far-reaching consequences as it will expose \u201ccriminals on a magnitude that is unprecedented.\u201d\n\nNerayoff Promises To Expose Criminals Posed As Altruists\n\nNerayoff stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post that he was soon going to unveil \u201cdata\u201d that unmasks certain criminals that are currently posing as \u201caltruists.\u201d He noted that he had made good on his earlier promise of the recording. As such, the crypto community can also be certain that he will make good on this one, too.\n\nIt is uncertain who these \u201caltruists\u201d might be. However, Nerayoff could be alluding to Ethereum founders Vitalik Buterin and Joe Lubin, as he had earlier remarked that the duo were \u201ccarefully crafted\u201d as \u201ccrypto saviors.\u201d Meanwhile, Nerayoff, who was an active participant during Ethereum\u2019s ICO, made further claims against the ETH ecosystem.\n\nA \u201cfew players\u201d are allegedly said to control the vast majority of Ether. The Ethereum insider alleged that these same persons have significant control of other cryptocurrencies, including the \u201cmajority of rug pulls, fraudulent ICOs and exploits.\u201d Nerayoff also hinted that everything might not be as it seems as he says that \u201cthe whole game is rigged and controlled by these few.\u201d\n\nA former Ethereum core developer, Lane Rettig, had previously backed some of Nerayoff\u2019s claims as he said that 70% of pre-mined ETH was immediately distributed. Then, Rettig seemed to be suggesting that a majority of the distributed ETH went to Etthereum\u2019s founders or those closely associated with them.\n\nMeanwhile, Nerayoff highlighted the fact that none of Ethereum\u2019s founders or close associates have come out to refute his allegations. He suggested that they have chosen to remain silent because everything he has said so far is true.\n\nNerayoff Comes For Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin\n\nThe Ethereum insider wasn\u2019t done as he took a swipe at co-founder Vitalik Buterin. He labeled him as a \u201cfalse altruist\u201d and accused him of putting up a facade. Nerayoff also said that Buterin makes a lot of calculated financial decisions for someone who says he doesn\u2019t care about the money.\n\nHis comments about Buterin also suggest that the Ethereum co-founder might be one of the criminals that he was referring to in his earlier remarks. Nerayoff even went as far as alleging that Vitalik controls the market.\n\nOne of Nerayoff\u2019s boldest claims to date came in a subsequent post where he accused Vitalik of blowing \u201chalf the Ethereum ICO proceeds betting it all on the price of BTC.\u201d The Ethereum co-founder went on to beg the Chinese government after this was done, Nerayoff claimed."

        "content": "The Polygon NFT volume has outranked that of Solana (SOL) in the past 24 hours. According to data from CryptoSlam, the popular Ethereum-based Layer-2 scaling protocol now ranks in the third position after Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), sending Solana to the 4th position.\n\nInteresting Polygon NFT Figures\n\nCryptoSlam data shows that Polygon has recorded a daily sales volume worth $9,986,754 in the past 24 hours, a figure that is more than double that of Solana which comes in at $4,116,667. While the Polygon NFT sales volume has jumped by 43% in 24 hours, that of Solana has slumped by more than 17%, giving rise to the flippening.\n\nadvertisement\n\nPolygon also has a higher wash sales figure compared to Solana with this metric coming in at $858,631 as compared to $175,493. Cumulatively, the total sales volume including the regular sales and wash sales comes in at $10,845,385 for Polygon NFTs and $4,292,160.\n\nThe total number of traders that helped Polygon achieve this rare feat is 12,283. An interesting trend presented itself in this regard as the total traders on Solana are far more than 13,560, underscoring how relatively more valuable the Non-Fungible Tokens being traded on Polygon are.\n\nConversely, Polygon NFT trader count outpaces the 7,002 buyers on the Bitcoin network and the 10,551 buyers on Ethereum as of the time of ranking. This NFT data positions Polygon as the best-performing non-layer-1 network in the top 5 which was completed by the Avalanche Network.\n\nThe growth of Inscriptions on Polygon might account for this massive NFT sales volume recorded thus far.\n\nCrypto Industry\u2019s Transient Growth Phases\n\nDespite being a nascent ecosystem, the crypto industry is seeing increased competition among participants that is reminiscent of the mainstream financial world.\n\nWeeks ago, Solana made the headlines as a top venue for NFT and DeFi trading activities after surpassing Ethereum in both daily and weekly DEX volumes respectively. This feat is unprecedented, seeing Ethereum still dominates the ecosystem in different aspects.\n\nWith Polygon outpacing Solana, signs are there that layer-2 solutions are attaining maturity, a trend that has spurred Vitalik Buterin to call for the development of customized Name Service for these protocols to enhance their adoption and usability.\n\nThis current milestone is part of a unique growth trend in Polygon which as reported earlier also extends to growing daily active users."

        "title": "Weekly Recap: Bitcoin, Binance, Ethereum, Solana... The crypto news you shouldn't miss! - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Mon 08 Jan 2024 \u25aa 10 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nWeek after week, the world of cryptocurrencies continues to surprise and reshape the paradigms of digital finance and technology with ever-renewed boldness and innovation. In our weekly recap, we\u2019re going to explore the most captivating and significant events of the past week. From the enigmatic transfer of Bitcoin to Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s wallet, to Solana\u2019s controversial strategy against layer 2 solutions, through the turbulence on the stablecoin market and the heated debates around the upcoming upgrade to Ethereum.\n\n$1.2 Million in Bitcoin Transferred to Satoshi\u2019s Wallet!\n\nAn unidentified individual recently sent $1.2 million in Bitcoin to the Genesis wallet of Satoshi Nakamoto, the very first wallet created on the Bitcoin network. Though Nakamoto has long since vanished and it\u2019s highly unlikely that they will recover these funds, this mysterious transfer has captivated the crypto community\u2019s attention. The Genesis wallet originally had only the 50 bitcoins mined upon its creation, but over time, other funds have been sent there, and its balance increased to 72 Bitcoins by the end of 2023. With this latest transaction, the current balance is 99.67 bitcoins, valued at approximately $4.3 million.\n\nThe Genesis wallet is the very first wallet created on the Bitcoin network by Satoshi Nakamoto, and although it could theoretically still hold the private keys to access these wallets, it\u2019s very unlikely to do so since no funds from wallets associated with Nakamoto, including those from the Genesis block, have moved since his disappearance in December 2010. While some crypto-enthusiasts see this transfer as a mindless waste of money, others consider it a fitting tribute to the anonymous genius behind the Bitcoin revolution.\n\nSolana: A Strategic Rejection of Layer-2s!\n\nAnatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana Labs, has recently made a bold claim that has shaken the crypto ecosystem: Solana does not require layer 2 solutions. This claim goes against the current trend where many blockchains are adopting layer 2 solutions to enhance scalability and performance. According to Yakovenko, Solana is focusing on expanding its global atomic state machine, an approach that would render layer 2s redundant.\n\nSolana isn\u2019t just another blockchain, it aspires to be the architect of a parallel universe. By focusing on global atomic synchronization, Solana seeks to surpass the limitations of current blockchain technologies. Yakovenko envisions a world where Solana\u2019s unique virtual machine is self-sufficient without the need for external solutions. With hardware upgrades on the horizon, the platform is preparing for a future where it might, possibly, reign supreme. But the real question remains: will this isolated strategy bear fruit in the constantly evolving crypto ecosystem?\n\nUSDC: A Not-So-Stable Stablecoin?\n\nThe USDC, the stablecoin issued by Circle, recently lost its peg to the US dollar, plunging the crypto community into panic. Instead of maintaining its usual value of 1 dollar, USDC saw its value drop alarmingly, hitting a low of as much as $0.74 on the Binance exchange platform. This sudden drop has sparked concerns and speculation among investors and market observers.\n\nThe USDC de-peg phenomenon is not isolated in the world of stablecoins. Previously, Tether\u2019s USDT had also experienced periods where it could not maintain its 1:1 parity with the US dollar, resulting in massive liquidations on major crypto exchange platforms. The details of the USDC incident reveal that during a period of widespread market selling, fueled by dubious reports about the approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF, USDC even lost its parity with the dollar three times.\n\nCould the USD Soon Be Pegged to Bitcoin?\n\nThe financial world might be on the brink of a revolution with the idea that the US dollar (USD) could soon be pegged to Bitcoin. This bold proposal has sparked a spirited debate among economists and policymakers. Proponents of this project view Bitcoin as a credible alternative to gold, traditionally used to back the value of currencies. They argue that Bitcoin, with its blockchain technology and decentralized network, offers increased security, limits counterfeiting, and thus reduces the risk of inflation. Furthermore, a USD indexed to Bitcoin would benefit from a limited and pre-programmed supply of new bitcoins, unlike traditional currencies that rely on central bank decisions. This could reinforce the dollar\u2019s status as a safe haven for investors.\n\nHowever, this idea is not without pitfalls. The volatility of Bitcoin is a significant concern, as pegging the world\u2019s primary reserve currency to such a volatile asset could destabilize the American economy and the international monetary balance. Additionally, China\u2019s dominance in Bitcoin mining poses a risk to US sovereignty and a systemic risk in the event of conflict between the two powers.\n\nBinance Tightens Policy on Monero and Zcash!\n\nBinance has recently announced a tightening of its trading rules for ten cryptocurrencies, including Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC), which will now be placed under \u201cenhanced surveillance\u201d due to the increased risks they pose. This move follows Binance\u2019s recent regulatory hurdles, as it faced allegations of money laundering and violations of KYC rules set by the US SEC. Monero and Zcash, known for their anonymizing properties, have often attracted regulatory attention for their potential to facilitate large-scale money laundering. Binance will also more closely monitor other tokens, while loosening rules for some like GMX and SushiSwap.\n\nTo trade these high-risk cryptocurrencies, Binance users will now have to take a quiz every 90 days and accept strengthened terms of use aimed at raising awareness of the risks involved. Tokens branded with Binance\u2019s \u201cSeed Tag\u201d are considered promising but highly volatile projects, and warning banners will be visible on their trading pages. Binance will conduct periodic reviews of crypto projects, taking into account various factors to add or remove tokens from surveillance lists. By tightening its compliance policy, Binance hopes to regain trust with authorities shaken in 2023, reflecting the difficult balancing act undertaken by the crypto giant.\n\nUNHCR Adopts Blockchain with Cardano for Humanitarian Aid\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has adopted blockchain as a powerful tool for refugee aid. With Cardano by its side, UNHCR is opening a new era of digital solidarity. Blockchain brings transparency and efficiency in the distribution of aid, and thanks to Cardano, the organization simplifies the management of donations, ensuring quick and direct help to refugees while securing their personal data. UNHCR is also innovating with crypto digital wallets that facilitate donations and receiving aid, even remotely, while educating refugees in digital literacy.\n\nCardano and UNHCR have launched a unique staking pool, \u201cBlockchain for Refugees,\u201d where each ADA crypto contribution directly supports the operations of UNHCR. This revolutionary crowdfunding model allows donors to maintain control of their assets while contributing to a noble cause. Cardano, with its committed community and unique staking system, has won over UNHCR, and their collaboration has already borne fruit with several innovative projects underway. The use of zero-knowledge proofs by Cardano further strengthens the security of refugee data.\n\nThe Pectra Update Causes a Split Among Ethereum Developers\n\nThe Ethereum community is actively preparing for Pectra, the next network upgrade scheduled for 2024, but a significant disagreement remains among developers on how best to integrate Verkle, a promising validity proof technology. The deployment of the Pectra upgrade will begin in 2024 with a series of tests on Ethereum development networks, allowing for the validation of the code in various environments and the identification of any potential bugs or performance issues.\n\nRegarding Verkle, two approaches oppose each other among Ethereum developers. Pro-mandatory Verkle advocates for total and immediate adoption, considering its advantages in terms of performance and scalability too important to provide a choice. On the other hand, anti-mandatory Verkle developers are more cautious, fearing security or stability issues if Verkle is deployed too quickly. They suggest that Verkle should first be offered as an option, alongside the current validation mechanism. The upcoming Pectra upgrade of Ethereum promises to be decisive for the network\u2019s future, but the integration of Verkle divides developers on the best strategy to adopt.\n\nBitcoin in 2023: A Whirlwind of $6 Trillion\n\nIn 2023, the Bitcoin market witnessed frenetic activity, with over $6 trillion exchanged, although this represents a 38% decrease from the previous year. This colossal sum equals more than 2.3 times the value of the French GDP and underscores the massive scale of transactions carried out with the flagship crypto.\n\nThe year was also marked by a relative stability of the average price of Bitcoin, with a slight increase from 2022. The number of active addresses remained steady, while Bitcoin\u2019s dominance climbed to 50%. More than 75% of Bitcoin holders are now considered long-term investors, a historic high that indicates a growing maturity of the market. Meanwhile, the amount of Bitcoin in circulation has increased by 1.75%, continuing its long-term downward trend.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "title": "Analyzing the ETH Price: Trends and Forecasts in the Crypto Economy - FinanceFeeds",
        "content": "Analyzing the ETH Price: Trends and Forecasts in the Crypto Economy\n\nThe ETH price is a crucial indicator in the cryptocurrency market, reflecting the ongoing evolution and adoption of the Ethereum blockchain. Investors and developers alike watch it closely.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Position in the Crypto Market\n\nEthereum has cemented its place as a cornerstone of the crypto economy, with its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), serving as a vital indicator of both the network\u2019s health and the blockchain industry\u2019s trends. As the primary platform for decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts, Ethereum\u2019s innovations directly influence ETH\u2019s price. The network\u2019s transition to Ethereum 2.0, with its shift from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS), promises further advancements and efficiencies, potentially affecting ETH\u2019s valuation.\n\nFactors Influencing ETH Price\n\nThe price of ETH, much like other cryptocurrencies, is shaped by various factors, including market demand, blockchain upgrades, the regulatory environment, and macroeconomic trends. Market sentiment can be significantly swayed by Ethereum\u2019s network upgrades, known as Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), which aim to enhance network capabilities and scalability. For instance, EIP-1559, which introduced a mechanism for burning transaction fees, has had a notable impact on ETH\u2019s economics by reducing the overall supply of ETH.\n\nHistorical Volatility and Price Analysis\n\nETH\u2019s price has experienced considerable volatility, characteristic of the broader cryptocurrency market. This volatility is driven by a mix of investor sentiment, liquidity, market manipulation, and the rapid pace of technological change. Analyzing ETH\u2019s historical price data reveals patterns and trends that can offer insights into its future movements. However, it\u2019s essential to remember that past performance is not always indicative of future results, especially in a market as young and dynamic as cryptocurrency.\n\nComparative Analysis with Bitcoin\n\nWhen comparing ETH to Bitcoin, it\u2019s clear that although both are leading cryptocurrencies, they serve different purposes. Bitcoin is primarily seen as a store of value or \u2018digital gold,\u2019 while ETH is the backbone of an ecosystem that enables decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and other blockchain applications. These fundamental differences often lead to divergent price movements, particularly in response to developments that specifically affect either the DeFi sector or the broader acceptance of digital assets as a store of value.\n\nETH and the DeFi Ecosystem\n\nETH\u2019s price is also intimately linked with the burgeoning DeFi ecosystem, most of which is built upon Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure. The rise of DeFi platforms, which offer decentralized lending, borrowing, and trading, has significantly increased the demand for ETH, as it is often required as collateral or for transaction fees within these systems.\n\nThe Impact of Institutional Adoption\n\nInstitutional adoption of ETH has been a key driver of its price. As more financial institutions, corporations, and investment funds embrace Ethereum for its smart contract capabilities and as an investment asset, this institutional demand can lead to increased price stability and growth. Conversely, negative sentiments or regulatory crackdowns in the institutional space can adversely affect ETH\u2019s price.\n\nRegulatory Factors Affecting ETH Price\n\nThe regulatory landscape is a wildcard in the valuation of ETH. Positive regulatory developments can lead to price surges, as seen with the SEC\u2019s decision not to classify ETH as a security. On the flip side, adverse regulatory news can cause sharp declines, as uncertainty can lead to decreased investor confidence.\n\nETH Price Predictions and Market Sentiment\n\nMarket analysts and enthusiasts often attempt to predict ETH\u2019s price, using a variety of methods including technical analysis, sentiment analysis, and the examination of on-chain metrics. While some predictions are based on sophisticated models, the inherent unpredictability of the crypto market means that such forecasts should be taken with caution.\n\nInvestment Strategies for ETH\n\nInvestors looking to include ETH in their portfolios should consider a range of strategies, from long-term holding to active trading, depending on their risk tolerance, investment goals, and expertise in the crypto market. A balanced approach, often including a diversified portfolio of assets, can help mitigate the risks associated with ETH\u2019s price volatility.\n\nThe Future of ETH\n\nThe future price of ETH is inextricably linked to the continued development and success of the Ethereum network. As Ethereum evolves, particularly with the complete rollout of Ethereum 2.0, ETH could see significant changes in demand, supply dynamics, and overall utility, which will ultimately shape its price trajectory.\n\nConclusion\n\nUnderstanding the price of ETH requires a multifaceted approach that considers the complex interplay of market forces, technological advancements, and regulatory changes. The Ethereum network\u2019s central role in the blockchain ecosystem makes ETH one of the most watched and analyzed digital currencies in the world. As the network continues to grow and adapt, so too will the factors influencing ETH\u2019s price, underscoring the importance for investors to stay well-informed and strategically agile."

        "content": "In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum (ETH) has long been the frontrunner, setting the standards for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nHowever, as the crypto space continues to expand and diversify, alternative tokens are emerging as strong contenders for investors looking beyond Ethereum. In this article, we will delve into three tokens that offer promising alternatives to Ethereum, with a special spotlight on Retik Finance (RETIK).\n\nAnalyzing 3 Tokens to Buy as Perfect Alternatives to Ethereum (ETH)\n\n1. Retik Finance (RETIK): Pioneering the Future of DeFi\n\nWhen it comes to exploring alternatives to Ethereum, Retik Finance (RETIK) stands out as a frontrunner, redefining the landscape of decentralized finance (DeFi). With a visionary approach to financial innovation, Retik Finance offers a comprehensive suite of DeFi solutions that aim to reshape global transactions and redefine the way we interact with digital assets.\n\nRetik Finance Overview\n\nRetik Finance is at the forefront of DeFi innovation, introducing a range of cutting-edge solutions that transcend the boundaries of traditional finance.

Solana (SOL): The Scalability Giant\n\nSolana has garnered significant attention in the crypto space for its impressive speed and scalability. Often referred to as the \u201cVisa for digital assets,\u201d Solana\u2019s institutional adoption and scalability advantages have made it a strong contender. It excels in the realms of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and its market performance in 2023, along with its technical capabilities, make it an attractive investment.Solana\u2019s ability to process a high number of transactions per second sets it apart.

The crypto community recognizes Solana\u2019s potential to become a significant player in the blockchain space, and it continues to gain traction in various sectors.\n\n3. Avalanche (AVAX): Scaling DeFi and dApps\n\nAvalanche, also known as AVAX, focuses on scalability and DeFi applications. Its native token, AVAX, serves multiple functions within the network, including network fees and staking for security. Avalanche distinguishes itself by offering robust support for DeFi and decentralized applications (dApps), with a particular emphasis on decentralized exchanges (DEXs).Despite mixed DeFi metrics in Q2 2023, Avalanche demonstrates potential, particularly in the field of asset tokenization. As DeFi continues to evolve and expand, Avalanche aims to provide a platform that can accommodate the growing demand for decentralized financial services.\n\nIn Conclusion: Retik Finance Shines Bright\n\nWhile Solana and Avalanche are formidable alternatives to Ethereum, Retik Finance stands out with its innovative approach to DeFi. Its DeFi Debit Cards, next-gen payment gateway, AI-powered P2P lending, and multi-chain non-custodial DeFi wallet make it a comprehensive solution that aims to redefine global transactions.

Among the sea of contenders, Ethereum, Polygon (MATIC), and Doge Uprising stand out. This exploration delves into their unique features, market potential, and why Doge Uprising might just be your golden ticket in the next big crypto investment.\n\nEthereum: The Decentralized Powerhouse\n\nEthereum, a name synonymous with the term \u2018blockchain\u2019, is more than just a cryptocurrency; it\u2019s a platform for decentralized applications (DApps). Its transition to Ethereum 2.0, shifting from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, signifies a commitment to scalability and energy efficiency.

        "title": "Lark Davis Sees Ethereum (ETH) to $10,000; Cardano (ADA) and Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) Prepare for Rally - CoinJournal",
        "content": "Renowned Crypto YouTuber Lark Davis recently took to social media to express his bullish sentiment on Ethereum. He firmly believes that Ethereum will eventually soar to a staggering $10,000. Such a price tag would signify a remarkable 321.52% increase from its current value of $2,370.\n\nWhile Davis didn\u2019t specify a timeline, his confidence underscores the growing optimism surrounding Ethereum\u2019s future prospects.\n\nRecent Milestones for Ethereum and Bitcoin\n\nOn-chain data from Santiment reveals that both Ethereum and Bitcoin are approaching new milestones. Ethereum is now just 1.6% away from its highest value since 11 May 2023. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is within a 2.9% range of its peak value since April 6 of last year. These near highs suggest a renewed bullish sentiment for the crypto market leaders.\n\nFurther insights from crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe suggest that Bitcoin may soon enter a range-bound phase post-ETF approval. However, this could pave the way for Ethereum to make significant strides, potentially surging past $3,000.\n\nIn-Depth Analysis Highlights Ethereum\u2019s Strengths\n\nA recent blog post by crypto researchers Qiao Wang and Dan McArdle delves into Ethereum\u2019s unique position in the crypto landscape. Drawing parallels with Bitcoin\u2019s status as \u201cdigital gold\u201d and Solana\u2019s efficiency, they underscore Ethereum\u2019s distinctive advantages. The Lindy effect, which posits that the longevity of a technology signifies its continued relevance, is particularly relevant to Ethereum, given its nearly decade-long presence and resilience.\n\nThe duo also emphasizes Ethereum\u2019s regulatory edge, notably its ETH futures contract on the CME, a privilege shared only with Bitcoin. This has instilled a level of confidence among regulators, particularly the SEC, distinguishing Ethereum from other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s strategic alliance with Coinbase via the Base rollup positions it advantageously in the compliant DeFi space. Post-EIP1559 and the Merge, Ethereum\u2019s \u2018real yield\u2019 feature has become a magnet for institutional investors seeking crypto-based yields.\n\nCardano\u2019s Market Movement\n\nShifting focus to Cardano, one of the top altcoins that has been consolidating in the $0.600 to $0.650 range. Despite facing a supply zone hurdle between $0.631 to $0.678, Cardano\u2019s price action indicates persistent buying interest. While there\u2019s potential for a short-term retracement, especially if the price breaches the uptrend line, the overall sentiment remains positive.\n\nA Closer Look at Rebel Satoshi\n\nWhile Ethereum and Cardano continue to make waves, another crypto to watch is Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ). With an impressive presale of over 96 million $RBLZ and having raised $1.3 million, the project is gaining traction.\n\nBuilt on Ethereum, Rebel Satoshi stands out for its robust security measures, having undergone thorough auditing by Source Hat. This is one of the many reasons why many top crypto analysts regard it as one of the best meme coins. As the presale edges closer to $2 million, now might be the opportune moment for investors to consider this promising venture.\n\nIn conclusion, the crypto landscape is rife with opportunities and predictions. While Ethereum\u2019s potential ascent to $10,000 excites many, altcoins like Cardano and Rebel Satoshi also present unique investment avenues. For those looking for which crypto to buy today for the long-term, Bitcoin is almost a sure bet. However, as always, due diligence and staying informed are paramount in navigating this dynamic market."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is a vibrant and ever-evolving space, where new opportunities and innovations arise daily. In this comprehensive analysis, we will explore the current market dynamics of three prominent tokens: Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and the promising newcomer, Retik Finance (RETIK).As we navigate the landscape of these digital assets, we\u2019ll also shed light on the unique investment potential presented by Retik Finance\u2019s ongoing presale.\n\nEthereum (ETH): The Giant Awakening\n\nEthereum, often referred to as the king of smart contracts, has recently experienced a period of relative stagnation in its price. Despite this, market analysts are optimistic about the potential for a resurgence. Ethereum\u2019s recent movement out of centralised exchanges and the steady increase in network activity suggest a brewing momentum.Crypto analyst \u2018Metaquant\u2019 notes that Ethereum has been holding steady while competitors like Solana and Avalanche have slowed down after significant price hikes. The rotation of capital in the layer-1 ecosystem points towards a potential shift back to Ethereum and its ecosystem.The on-chain metrics support this narrative. Ethereum and its layer-2 networks have seen consistent growth, with a record-high total value locked (TVL) across the layer-2 ecosystem. Daily active addresses, layer-2 fees, and layer-2 stablecoin market capitalization have also been on the rise. Ethereum currently trades at $2,265.78 as of writing and has seen a 24-hour growth of 1.76%.\n\nThe recent move by crypto lender Celsius to unstack Ethereum is seen as a positive development, reducing short-term volatility and clearing the way for a potential Ethereum resurgence. Despite current price consolidation, some analysts predict Ethereum could easily reach $10,000, doubling its previous all-time high.\n\nSolana (SOL): Building Momentum\n\nSolana, a rising star in the cryptocurrency space, experienced rapid price action from mid-October to mid-December. However, the token has since entered a consolidation phase, building a price structure for its next move. While the short-term 4-hour time frame shows Solana moving within a potential bull flag, analysts caution that confirmation requires a third touch on the top trend line.Zooming out to the weekly time frame, Solana appears to be consolidating around the 0.382 Fibonacci level. Analysts anticipate a potential target of $163 at the 0.618 Fibonacci level, though a healthy price structure may involve retracement to at least $137.The current Solana price stands at $102.15, reflecting a 3.37% increase over the past 24 hours. Amidst a brief respite following its remarkable surge, Solana maintains its status as a pivotal contender worth monitoring. This is especially true in light of the ongoing developments in market rotation and capital flow dynamics.\n\nRetik Finance (RETIK): Unlocking the Future\n\nRetik Finance emerges as a new contender in the decentralised finance (DeFi) space, aiming to revolutionise the global financial landscape. Currently, in its presale stages, Retik Finance has already exceeded expectations, offering an all-time profit of 100%. The token is now at presale stage 4, with tokens available at $0.060, poised to grow by 150% on its way to the listing price of $0.15.Experts in the crypto space project even more substantial gains for Retik Finance, with potential pumps of up to 2000% upon listing.

The $RETIK token serves as the backbone of this ecosystem, promoting financial autonomy, governance, and user engagement. By leveraging decentralised technologies, Retik Finance aims to address the limitations of traditional banking systems, offering enhanced security, accessibility, and privacy while facilitating cross-border transactions.\n\n>>>> Click Here To Buy RETIK Tokens <<<<\n\nParticipate in the Retik Finance Presale\n\nFor savvy investors looking to ride the wave of potential gains, participating in the Retik Finance presale is a strategic move.

Moreover, this altcoin\u2019s Fear & Greed index rating shows a 70 (Greed), which paints a bright future for Quant.\n\nAs a result, experts in the crypto field forecast a potential surge to $152.89 for Quant before the end of February 2024.\n\nHow Does Pullix Outshine Ethereum Classic and Quant?\n\nPullix stands out thanks to its low market cap when taking a closer look at these altcoins. Currently, PLX has a market cap of $14M, drastically lower than Ethereum Classic ($2.9B) and Quant\u2019s ($1.5B). In other words, PLX will surge much faster as fewer new funds are needed.\n\nSince Pullix will also enter many resilient markets like the Forex market, which saw a daily volume of $6.6T in 2019, its long-term growth potential is stellar. Because of this, savvy investors are now looking at PLX as one of the top altcoins.\n\nFor more information regarding Pullix\u2019s presale see links below:\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Top 7 High-Potential Cryptos Set to Shoot to the Moon in 2024 - CryptoDaily",
        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nThe crypto market looks set to grow a lot over the next year. The total market cap is projected to reach an impressive $3.2 trillion, while the global number of crypto owners is anticipated to surge as high as 950 million, as per the latest Bitfinex Alpha report. This growth is underpinned by several on-chain metrics suggesting the market's transition from a bear to a bull run, highlighted by the over 159% surge in Bitcoin (BTC) prices over the past year.\n\nAmidst this optimistic outlook, several cryptocurrencies are emerging as potential leaders for 2024. Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) are notable for their robust platforms and technological advancements. Meanwhile, ScapesMania (MANIA) is also gaining attention as a promising project.\n\nRide The Wave Of Innovation With ScapesMania\n\nWhile some are facing an uncertain future, the trajectory of a presale project is far easier to predict. ScapesMania (MANIA) is a well-balanced, meticulously designed project that acts as a gaming ecosystem. Through DAO governance, backers will be able to influence and benefit from a multi-billion-dollar industry. A wide range of features paired with the best technology, a professional team, and a long-term, highly ambitious vision can make ScapesMania the next big thing in crypto. Presale discounts and stage bonuses only add to the project's appeal.\n\nPresale is Live Now \u2013 Join Now for a Chance to Benefit with MANIA\n\nBacked by an award-winning developer crew, ScapesMania stands for transparency. The project can achieve this not just by bringing big innovation to the game, but by putting its community front and center. Driving customer engagement and making sure that everyone benefits through great tokenomics and generous rewards is what makes ScapesMania the project with a bright future ahead.\n\nPresale is Live, Learn More About Major Benefits\n\nEthereum (ETH): Navigating the Path of Expansion and Potential Milestones\n\nEthereum (ETH) has witnessed a significant rise in its market value, particularly with the expected approval of BlackRock's Ethereum spot ETF. The price of Ethereum (ETH) has jumped 79% in the past year.\n\nIf this trend continues, Ethereum (ETH) is projected to experience price fluctuations ranging from $2,244 up to $6,373 in 2024. Ethereum (ETH) shows promise, yet its future remains unpredictable.\n\nMarket watchers are buzzing with the idea that if the ETF gets the green light, we could see Ethereum (ETH) price leap past $28,000, which is a pretty big deal considering where it stands now. The deflationary burn mechanism and expected surge of liquidity from the ETF are poised to dramatically boost its value. Nonetheless, market forecasts also suggest a potential upper limit in the forthcoming market cycle, with a more modest peak around $10,000.\n\nSolana (SOL): Navigating Market Dynamics and Anticipated Growth\n\nSolana (SOL) has demonstrated a remarkable upward trajectory, exhibiting robust market performance. Solana (SOL) is making waves with its lightning-fast transactions, quickly becoming a heavyweight in the tough world of crypto. Amidst the market's ups and downs, Solana (SOL) has impressively pushed past key challenges, grabbing the spotlight from investors and traders.\n\nWith predictions placing its value between $98.93 and $230.54 in 2024, Solana (SOL) stands on the verge of a significant increase in value, propelled by its sophisticated technology and strategic market presence.\n\nAlthough the road ahead has some bumps, Solana (SOL) has potential. Despite these obstacles, the allure of cryptocurrency, coupled with Solana (SOL) inherent strengths, points to a promising future valuation.\n\nOsmosis (OSMO): Carving a Niche in DeFi Leadership\n\nOsmosis (OSMO) has demonstrated a remarkable rebound over the past three months, marked by a surge in price and a transition into a robust recovery phase. This upward movement is bolstered by its increasing total value locked and trading volume, highlighting Osmosis' (OSMO) growing prominence in the decentralized finance (DeFi) realm.\n\nOsmosis (OSMO) is expected to see a significant increase in 2024 if it continues on its current trajectory. The annual low is estimated to be around $1.70, with a potential high of up to $5.18. The outlook for Osmosis (OSMO) is quite positive, indicating a strong upward trend and substantial momentum over the next year.\n\nWith its strategic alliance with Umee, Osmosis (OSMO) is poised for potential further advancement. Yet, to keep its edge post-merger, Osmosis (OSMO) must navigate the choppy waters of market volatility with steady progress. To prosper, Osmosis (OSMO) needs to integrate effectively within the expansive Cosmos network and resonate with its user community. For Osmosis (OSMO) to succeed in the competitive DeFi landscape, it must seamlessly assimilate into the Cosmos ecosystem and captivate its user base.\n\nSpotlight on Emerging Cryptocurrencies: Render (RNDR), Optimism (OP), Sui (SUI), Arbitrum (ARB)\n\nAs the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, it's crucial to look beyond the giants and consider emerging tokens like Render (RNDR), Optimism (OP), Sui (SUI), and Arbitrum (ARB). Far from merely surfing the current of innovation, these tokens are forging their own formidable waves worthy of your scrutiny.\n\nRender (RNDR) has seen a meteoric rise with a 812% price increase in 2023, reaching nearly $5. This surge, backed by solid technical indicators, positions Render (RNDR) for continued growth. However, the $5.5 resistance level is a critical point to watch, as any rejection could lead to a downturn.\n\nOptimism (OP) is reimagining Ethereum scaling with a focus on supporting key protocols and prioritizing simplicity and public benefit. Although facing volatility, Optimism (OP) expanding community points to positive momentum. However, Optimism (OP) must navigate the competitive and volatile crypto market to realize its full potential.\n\nBy partnering with Solend, Sui (SUI) is making serious moves, boldly stepping beyond the confines of its home base in the Solana network. By embracing the Move programming language and harnessing parallel processing, Sui (SUI) is stepping up its game in both security and speed. As Sui (SUI) ventures into new territories, its ability to scale effectively while maintaining security will be crucial.\n\nArbitrum (ARB) stepped up the game in blockchain, really making strides with its layer-2 tech to help things run smoother and faster. As Arbitrum (ARB) gains traction, it's got to keep pushing boundaries and show it can play the long game against tough rivals and tricky tech hurdles.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe buzz is real: experts are betting big on crypto, expecting the market to soar and potentially hit a whopping $3.2 trillion in value this year. This optimism is fueled by a surge in Bitcoin prices and an expected increase in global crypto ownership to nearly a billion users. Against this upbeat backdrop, a handful of cryptos are stepping up as leaders, each packing its own punch and looking ripe with opportunity.\n\nEthereum (ETH) gearing up for a big leap, with the enthusiasm around its ETF nod and tech upgrades possibly sending its value through the roof. Riding the wave of its lightning-fast transaction speeds, Solana (SOL) is gearing up for some serious growth. Osmosis (OSMO) is making waves in the DeFi world, bouncing back with strength and showing signs it could really skyrocket in value. Cryptocurrencies like Render (RNDR), Optimism (OP), Sui (SUI), and Arbitrum (ARB) are on the rise too. Each brings fresh features to the table with serious growth potential. These seven digital currencies are like hidden gems in the vast crypto universe, each with a shot at soaring to remarkable heights as they evolve and expand.\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the oldest and most valued cryptocurrency in the world, remained within the $43,000 range over the weekend despite seeing minor losses. Popular altcoins \u2014 including the likes of Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) \u2014 landed in the reds across the board. The Stacks (STX) token went on to become the biggest gainer of the lot, with a 24-hour jump of a little over 1 percent. SEI, on the other hand, became the biggest loser with a 24-hour dip of over 17 percent.\n\nThe global crypto market cap stood at $1.61 trillion at the time of writing, registering a 24-hour dip of 2.49 percent.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Today\n\nBitcoin price stood at $43,505.03, registering a 24-hour loss of 1.13 percent, as per CoinMarketCap.

As per WazirX, SOL price in India stood at Rs 7,900.\n\nTop Crypto Gainers Today (January 8)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top crypto gainers over the past 24 hours:\n\nStacks (STX)\n\nPrice: $1.62\n\n24-hour gain: 1.17 percent\n\nToncoin (TON)\n\nPrice: $2.19\n\n24-hour gain: 1.05 percent\n\nTop Crypto Losers Today (January 8)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto losers over the past 24 hours:\n\nAstar (ASTR)\n\nPrice: $0.1162\n\n24-hour loss: 17.88 percent\n\nMina (MINA)\n\nPrice: $0.9865\n\n24-hour loss: 14.10 percent\n\nInternet Computer (ICP)\n\nPrice: $10.71\n\n24-hour loss: 13.24 percent\n\nGala (GALA)\n\nPrice: $0.02317\n\n24-hour loss: 13.19 percent\n\nConflux (CFX)\n\nPrice: $0.1707\n\n24-hour loss: 12.95 percent\n\nWhat Crypto Exchanges Are Saying About Current Market Scenario\n\nMudrex co-founder and CEO Edul Patel told ABP Live, \u201cDuring the weekend, Bitcoin traded at the $43,000 level, with market participants eyeing Bitcoin ETFs approval. BTC is facing resistance at $43,900, and a breakthrough could lead to a continued upward movement to $44,200. The market is currently in a state of equilibrium, with neither bulls nor bears taking the lead. In this scenario, Bitcoin is likely to trade within the narrow range of $43,000 and $44,500 in the coming days. Ethereum is following a similar trajectory to Bitcoin, and the approval of Bitcoin ETFs might pave the way for regulatory clarity on Ethereum ETFs. The upcoming week is anticipated to be volatile, especially with the release of US CPI data on Thursday.\u201d\n\nParth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures, said, \u201cUS Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) seem poised for imminent launch as the exchanges that will list them have submitted revised documents, indicating anticipation of approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission in the near future. Resonating the positive sentiment, VanEck, an asset management firm, has pledged to allocate 5 percent of its fund's potential profits to support Bitcoin developers at Brink, contingent upon approval.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin (BTC) demonstrates resilience around the $43.4k mark; however, recent analysis suggests caution, hinting it might not reach a new ATH soon. The broader crypto market presents varied sentiments, witnessing altcoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) navigating complexities. As SHIB's address count rises, it reflects the burgeoning interest and potential market dynamics, emphasising the need for vigilant monitoring amidst evolving crypto landscapes.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin is at a critical point, trading at $43,600 , with potential ETF approvals from BlackRock and Grayscale fueling excitement. VanEck's adviser suggests that ETFs could overcome unit bias and open the door to wider adoption. A surprise $1.17 million transaction to the genesis Bitcoin wallet raises speculation of Nakamoto's involvement or a publicity stunt. SEC rulings on ETF applications with impact on institutional engagement and market dynamics are expected. Bitcoin's recent drop to $42,125 reflects continued volatility with crucial support at $39,891. Technical analysis shows resistance at $44,200 and potential upside momentum, but RSI signals overbought conditions. Bitcoin's trajectory continues to be subject to rapid change due to the cryptocurrency's inherent volatility.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cThe crypto market witnessed profit booking by traders due to which Bitcoin dipped to the $43,000 level while Ethereum slipped to the $2,181 mark. The latest market rally may have triggered profit booking and traders may have created fresh positions to prepare for the next cycle. The market sentiment is extremely positive as there is a lot of news around Bitcoin ETF approval by the SEC. Bitcoin approval will be the biggest market mover in 2024 and make digital assets mainstream across the globe. The market is expected to remain volatile in the coming weeks owing to the macroeconomic factors.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cDuring the weekend, the overall crypto market displayed a slight bearish sentiment. BTC traded sideways, currently positioned below the key resistance level at $44,300 and above the incline trendline support at $42,600. The rising BTC dominance contributed to bearish trends in altcoins. ETH witnessed a break below an incline trendline support and is also below the 20EMA Daily, indicating a bearish stance. The support level for ETH is at $2,131, with resistance at $2,390. Notably, investors are actively speculating on the potential approval of the BTC spot ETF on January 10.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "title": "How To Bridge And Trade On The Injective (INJ) Network - TradingView",
        "content": "Injective is a blockchain designed specifically for finance. It is an interoperable and environmentally-friendly layer 1 blockchain that supports advanced DeFi applications, including crypto trading dApps, like spot and derivative exchanges, and lending protocols.\n\nThat being said, in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, the Injective Network has emerged as a trailblazing force, revolutionizing the landscape with its innovative approach to scalability and seamless trading experiences. In my opinion, I will say that Injective is trying to follow the Solana path in terms of progressive growth in the ecosystem and price value.\n\nIn this in-depth guide, we\u2019ll navigate through the essential features of the Injective (INJ) Network, unravel the intricacies of initiating your trading journey, and explore various methods to acquire and trade the coveted Injective Coin (INJ).\n\nSolving Scalability: The Essence of Injective (INJ) Network\n\nThe scalability challenge has long been a hurdle for widespread crypto adoption, and Injective Network steps up to the task as a groundbreaking solution. Scalability is the reason some people don\u2019t trade certain coins. For instance, I avoid making certain Ethereum transactions because of the high gas fees. If I want to make any monetary transaction, I prefer to use a more scalable coin like injective (INJ).\n\nScalability isn\u2019t just about transaction costs but also about the speed of transactions. Injective Network boasts a remarkable transaction speed of 0.8 seconds, leaving competitors, including Ethereum and its layer 2 counterparts, in the rearview mirror. What more can you ask for with their gas fees as low as $0.01, Injective Network brings unparalleled efficiency to the world of blockchain transactions.\n\nInjective (INJ) gives you a better DeFi experience, this is because you are not scared of exploring the DeFi space due to high gas fees and slow annoying transaction speed. If you have transacted on the Ethereum chain or done any past DeFi activity on the Ethereum chain, you will be conscious of your exploration because each activity will incur a transaction fee whether the contract signed is successful or not and it\u2019s not cheap.\n\nInitiating Your Injective Trading Journey\n\nEmbarking on your trading journey within the Injective Network involves meticulous steps to ensure a seamless experience. The choice of a compatible wallet is paramount, and here, we delve deeper into two main types:\n\nEVM Based Wallets:\n\nEVM compatibility is the bedrock for smooth integration with Injective Network. While Metamask is a popular choice, it\u2019s essential to understand its intricacies, especially when it comes to the EVM chain. Exploring alternative EVM-based wallets can provide tailored solutions for optimal user experience.\n\nIt is preferable to use an EVM wallet like Metamask if you are bridging from an EVM chain to an injective chain. As we go further into this post, you will learn how to bridge from EVM to the injective chain. EVM wallet like metamask makes your Defi experience on the injective easier but you can\u2019t compare it to that of the cosmos-based wallet.\n\nCosmos Based Wallet:\n\nFor a user-friendly experience on your PC, consider Cosmos-based wallets like Leap and Keplr. These Chrome extensions are tailor-made for Injective Networks, ensuring not just compatibility but also enhanced security features. Using a Cosmos-based wallet makes interaction far easier than EVM-based wallets. But you can\u2019t have EVM-based assets on this wallet, this means that you can\u2019t bridge EVM assets to injective using this wallet, you need to use Metamask.\n\nThese wallets, the EVM-based wallets, and the Cosmos-based Based Wallets are great for your smooth Defi experience when interacting on the injective chain. Acquiring Injective Coin (INJ)\n\nOnce your wallet is set up, the next crucial step is acquiring the prized Injective Coin. INJ is prominently listed on various centralized exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, Kucoin, Bybit, OKX, and Gate.io. Each exchange offers its unique advantages, and strategic users may explore multiple platforms for optimal trading conditions.\n\nConsider securing your INJ in a Keplr wallet for efficient portfolio management. When you are sending INJ from centralized crypto exchanges to your Keplr wallet, make sure you choose the Injective network and paste your Injective network address from your Keplr wallet.\n\nSetting Up Keplr Wallet for Injective Chain Visibility\n\nCreating a Keplr wallet is a straightforward process through the Chrome extension. Get your Keplr wallet, and create a new wallet, you will be given a seed phrase, save the seed phrase, usually a 12 or 24-word seed phrase. Do not forget to save them, in order not to lose your account permanently.\n\nTo make the Injective chain visible in your Keplr wallet, follow these steps:\n\nClick on the hamburger sign in the top left corner.\n\nNavigate to \u201cManage Chain Visibility.\u201d\n\nThis will take you to where you can view the chain visibility on the Keplr wallet, this is essential as it helps you select other chains on the Keplr wallet.\n\nSearch for \u201cInjective\u201d or \u201cInj\u201d and click on \u201cAdd Token.\u201d\n\nBy enhancing Injective-related keywords in your wallet setup process, you not only optimize for search engines but also ensure clarity for users seeking to manage their INJ effectively.\n\nIt is important to know that every address on the injective chain starts with the \u201cinj\u201d prefix, this helps you identify the injective chain easily. Congratulations you are about to begin your Injective DeFi journey.\n\nDefi means Decentralised Finance, this is a type of transaction that doesn\u2019t require a centralized platform like Binance, Bybit, OKX, or whatever centralized exchange you know. All you need to perform a DeFi transaction is a DEX (Decentralised Exchange) wallets like Keplr and a Dapp (Decentralised Application).\n\nWe have a wallet now, we need to fund it with INJ before interacting with a Dapp on the Injective wallet. You can get INJ tokens from an exchange like Binance Binance. You can deposit on your Binance in whatever way you are used to depositing on your Binance, you can deposit USDT with fiat. Trade the USDT for INJ. The next step is to withdraw the INJ to your Keplr wallet. Withdraw the INJ on the Injective wallet. Withdrawing INJ coin and Bridging Tokens:\n\nThe withdrawal process after acquiring INJ involves selecting the coin, choosing the Injective chain, and pasting your Keplr Injective address. Remember the address has to start with \u201cINJ\u201d. This step is crucial for securing your assets, and benefits from additional details regarding security measures, transaction confirmation times, and potential challenges users might encounter. This is just one method to get INJ from a centralized exchange, you can also get INJ by bridging.\n\nBridging, an alternative method for bringing tokens to Injective, is an essential strategy, especially for users keen on optimizing their portfolio across multiple chains. Bridging from an EVM-based wallet requires a metamask and INJ on an EVM chain. For instance, if you have INJ on the ETH chain in your metamask, all you need to do is connect your metamask to the Injective Bridge platform. This will help you bridge from the ETH chain to the injective chain.\n\nBridging Tokens in the Cosmos-Based Wallet Ecosystem:\n\nAn intriguing method to diversify your portfolio involves bridging tokens from the Cosmos-based wallet ecosystem to Injective. For example, bridging TIA (Celestia) to Injective and swapping TIA (Injective) to INJ (Injective) using Astroport opens up opportunities within the Cosmos ecosystem.\n\nYou will have to go to the Injective Bridge platform, connect to your cosmos-based wallet, select whatever cosmos-based wallet token you have like TIA (Celestia), and bridge from the Celestia chain to the injective chain. Emphasizing this integration showcases the versatility of Injective Network and its compatibility with other blockchain ecosystems. Now you have TIA(Injective) you need to swap it to INJ, trading or swapping can be done Astroport.\n\nTrading INJ on Astroport\n\nAstroport, the decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Injective chain, serves as the epicenter for token swaps. After successfully bridging tokens, users can initiate trades on Astroport, leveraging the platform\u2019s decentralized nature for portfolio diversification. Whatever you are swapping here is expected to be on the injective chain, you can swap INJ for all the available tokens, and now you can trade as easily as you like. How To Trade on Coinhall\n\nCoinhall is a site where you can bridge directly and swap. It is a multi-token bridge swap DEX that you can use to bridge and swap at the same time but only for Cosmos-based tokens and coins. It serves as a smart chart for all cosmos-based tokens including injective and also for swapping and bridging.\n\nYou can see all the available coins and tokens with their respective prices here, it\u2019s a good DEX dApp to use. You can scroll here and search for the token you are looking for. You can also search by using the search bar.\n\nIf you want to trade a token and you can find it on the list, all you have to do is go to Coinhall and type the name of the token, as well as search using a contract address.\n\nCoingecko is also a good site that has the details of coins. Here, you can search for the name of the coin or token you are looking for, and get the contract address directly.\n\nGo to the info section and search for the contract, copy the smart contract from Coingecko, and paste it into the coinhall market search button.\n\nLike this:\n\nThis will take you to where you will be able to trade any token based on the dex.\n\nLet\u2019s explore Coinhall as A Bridge Swap DEX\n\nTo explore Coinhall this way, you need to navigate to the Swap section. This section will give you the opportunity to bridge and swap at the same time. For instance, if you want to swap TIA (Celestia) to INJ (Injective) you can do this at ease with one click.\n\nInstead of bridging TIA (Celestia) to TIA (Injective) then swapping it to INJ. You can do it as shown below:\n\nConclusion\n\nWith your INJ Coin securely stored in your wallet, you\u2019re now poised to explore the exciting world of trading on the Injective Network. The scalability, low transaction fees, and swift processing times position the blockchain as a promising platform for crypto enthusiasts and traders alike. In the dynamic realm of decentralized finance (DeFi), Injective Network stands tall, offering innovative solutions for seamless and efficient trading experiences.\n\nAs you navigate this multifaceted landscape, remember that the Injective Network isn\u2019t just a platform; it\u2019s a gateway to transformative technology shaping the future of cryptocurrency. These steps, when taken with a strategic mindset, offer not only trading opportunities but also a deeper understanding of the evolving crypto ecosystem.\n\nStay informed, trade wisely, and harness the full potential of the Injective Network, where every transaction is an opportunity to redefine your crypto journey.\n\nIn summary, this comprehensive guide provides an extensive roadmap for mastering the Injective Network, ensuring that users, from beginners to seasoned traders, can navigate the intricacies of this innovative blockchain ecosystem with confidence and clarity."

        "title": "How to Buy Ethereum in Australia in 2024 - Crypto News Australia",
        "content": "Too long, didn\u2019t read? Buying Ethereum in Australia is very simple and can be done with just a few clicks. There are several exchanges to choose from, each with their pros and cons. Our pick as the best exchange to purchase ETH is Swyftx due to their easy-to-use app, low trading fees, helpful customer support and wide range of additional features. Simply sign up, verify your identification, deposit AUD and then purchase your desired amount of ETH.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is a decentralised ledger that runs on blockchain technology. It was designed to host decentralised applications (dApps) and execute smart contracts, the first of its kind. Additionally, projects can easily create tokens that reside on the Ethereum blockchain. These types of tokens are known as ERC-20.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, the Ethereum network runs on a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, which requires network participants to stake ETH instead of mining crypto.\n\nRelated: Ethereum staking guide\n\nThe Ethereum platform is powered by Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second largest cryptocurrency in the world based on market cap.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow to buy Ethereum safely in Australia\n\nThe safest way you can buy Ethereum (ETH) in Australia is through a reputable crypto trading platform or exchange. Some exchanges offer more crypto assets than others, however, most crypto exchanges will allow trading for popular coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) monitors and regulates digital currency exchanges so that it complies with national standards, it is highly recommended to go through an AUSTRAC-registered exchange.\n\nBelow are four key steps to purchasing Ethereum:\n\nCreate an account with a registered exchange Verify your identification Deposit Australian Dollars Buy Ethereum\n\nFor this example, we\u2019ll be using the Swyftx cryptocurrency exchange to demonstrate how you can buy and store Ethereum in Australia. Swyftx is an AUSTRAC-registered exchange with offices located in Brisbane and Sydney. Their beginner-centric Ethereum exchange is very easy to sign up for, and they have Australian-based customer support to help if you need assistance along the way. Other Australian exchanges like Coinspot, Digitial Surge and Coinjar have similar sign-up processes.\n\nStep One: Create a Swyftx Account\n\nCreating a Swyftx account couldn\u2019t be simpler. You will have to supply some basic information \u2013 your phone number, full name, and email address. When this is complete you will be asked to create a password. It is important to create a password that is unique and secure. Once your password is created, make sure to write it down and keep it in a secure place or use a password manager like LastPass.\n\nClick here to create your account.\n\nStep Two: Complete account verification\n\nAll AUSTRAC registered exchanges require users to complete identification checks by uploading a photo of their identification document. Once you are logged in, you will need to peruse the left-hand menu and select \u2018profile\u2019 > \u2018verification\u2019. Your account\u2019s verification is necessary for depositing fiat or purchasing crypto.\n\nA form of government-issued identification, such as a passport or driver\u2019s license is required for verifying your account.\n\nTo further enhance the security of your Swyftx account, it is strongly recommended that you enable two-factor authentication (2FA). This adds an extra layer of security in case your login details fall into the wrong hands. Google and Microsoft Authenticators are supported by most crypto exchanges.\n\nStep Three: Deposit Funds\n\nOnce your account is verified, you can then deposit funds which can then be used to buy and sell Ethereum.\n\nMost exchanges will allow you to deposit through bank account transfers, Swyftx included. You can also deposit funds via your chosen payment method: POLi, PayID or credit or debit card. Swyftx does not charge any fees when you deposit via bank transfer.\n\nIf you already have cryptocurrency in an external crypto wallet, you can deposit these assets directly into Swyftx using your new wallet address. These assets can then be swapped for ETH.\n\nStep Four: Purchase Ethereum\n\nOnce you have a sum of Australian dollars (AUD) in your wallet, you are able to buy Ethereum instantly. To get started, click Trade and search for Ethereum (ETH).\n\nOnce you\u2019re on the Ethereum page, select Buy. A window will then pop up allowing you to input the details of your order. For instance, you can select how much ETH you wish to buy or input the AUD equivalent. Once you have reviewed your order details, simply click Place Order.\n\nWhere is the best place to buy Ethereum?\n\nChoosing the best place to purchase ETH can be overwhelming with so many options available. Selecting an Australian-based exchange is recommended as they are almost guaranteed to accept Australian dollars (AUD). This makes it easy to deposit funds to purchase crypto quickly.\n\nIt is also important to consider other aspects like the exchange\u2019s security reputation, user-friendliness, customer support, regulation, and trading fees.\n\nRead our comparison of the best crypto exchanges in Australia for more information.\n\nIs it legal to trade Ethereum in Australia?\n\nYes, buying and selling Ethereum is legal in Australia as long as you\u2019re doing it on an AUSTRAC-registered exchange. However, it is important to note there are tax laws that apply to crypto. As it stands, the Australian Tax Office (ATO) considers digital currencies to be assets, meaning Capital Gains Tax (CGT) applies to profit or losses on your Ethereum investment.\n\nFor a comprehensive breakdown of crypto tax, read this Australian crypto tax guide.\n\nIs it safe to buy Ethereum?\n\nNo investment is ever guaranteed to be safe. Whilst Ethereum is one of the more popular cryptocurrencies on the market, it is still at the mercy of market volatility. Any crypto purchase you intend to make should be thoroughly researched, so that you properly weigh the risks, and understand how your investment will operate.\n\nThere is a lot to learn about your potential ETH investment; however, for a beginner, it is necessary that you understand price volatility, exchange vulnerabilities, and regulatory uncertainty. Doing so allows you to better gauge whether your investment could be considered a \u2018safe\u2019 one.\n\nRegulatory uncertainty: You must be aware that the regulatory ecosystem for cryptocurrency is young and prone to change. Keeping an eye on both national and international shifts may be useful when deciding when, and how, to invest.\n\nYou must be aware that the regulatory ecosystem for cryptocurrency is young and prone to change.

        "content": "With rapid developments in blockchain technology, one project attracting attention is CORE DAO. CORE DAO has become an innovation pioneer with a strong vision and use of advanced technology.\n\nThrough the integration of Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology, CORE DAO offers guaranteed privacy, scalability, and an unprecedented level of security.\n\nCore DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) active in developing the Satoshi Plus ecosystem. This ecosystem, a Layer-1 blockchain, combines the decentralization and security advantages of Bitcoin with the scalability and utility offered by the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nSo, to understand what CORE DAO is, its history and inventor, how it works, its main role in the ecosystem, and how it compares to other blockchains, check out the following review!\n\nWhat is Core DAO?\n\nCORE or Core DAO is a Layer-1 blockchain project that integrates systems from Bitcoin and Ethereum through a consensus mechanism known as Satoshi Plus.\n\nThis approach is an optimal combination of Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Work (PoW) features. CORE aims to introduce the growth of Satoshi Plus consensus as well as harness the power of blockchain technology.\n\nBased on the Core DAO white paper, the main vision is to provide a blockchain that is scalable, secure, decentralized, and transparent for all users.\n\nIn other words, Core DAO is here to overcome the limitations of scale and decentralization support that PoW and PoS have. These experiments reflect principles such as sharding, sidechain, and state channel mechanisms.\n\nWith this approach, Core DAO aims to create a new blockchain independently, allowing it to operate within the Web3 ecosystem.\n\nHowever, the identity of the creator of Core DAO is not revealed. Even though an event poster named BlockSplit listed Schwarze Katze as the figure behind Core DAO, his identity remains unclear.\n\nAdditionally, one of the leading figures at Core DAO is Brendan Sedo, a Portuguese developer who previously served as CEO at Joist, a financial invoicing app for contractors.\n\nHistory and Inventors of Core Dao\n\nRich Rines, one of the early contributors to Core DAO, provides an in-depth perspective on the unique approach taken by Core DAO in solving the blockchain trilemma through the Satoshi Plus consensus mechanism.\n\nBy combining Bitcoin\u2019s computational advantages to achieve decentralization and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) advantages that enable scalability, Rines noted that Core DAO succeeded in creating a layer-1 solution that unites the three core elements of blockchain technology.\n\nHow Core Dao Works\n\nQuoting coinmarketcap.com, Core DAO created an innovative consensus mechanism called \u201cSatoshi Plus,\u201d a complex combination of Bitcoin proof-of-work and Ethereum proof-of-stake. The following illustration explains the complex network of relationships of Satoshi Plus:\n\n\n\nCore Dao\u2019s Primary Role in the Ecosystem\n\nQuoting coinmarketcap.com, there are several main roles in the Core ecosystem that you need to know. The following are the main roles of Core Dao in the ecosystem, including:\n\nValidator: Responsible for block production and checking transactions.

CORE Holders: Own CORE and can participate in staking by handing over their holdings to a validator.\n\nOwn CORE and can participate in staking by handing over their holdings to a validator. Verifier: Checks for any bad behavior on the network and can report it. Bad behavior by validators may result in deductions from their deposits.\n\nValidator Selection Process\n\nValidator Selection: A mechanism to select the top 21 validators using a score based on how much BTC hash power and CORE assets the validator owns. Updated every 200 blocks.\n\nA mechanism to select the top 21 validators using a score based on how much BTC hash power and CORE assets the validator owns. Updated every 200 blocks.

Slot: A small part of a round where a validator can create a block.\n\nA small part of a round where a validator can create a block. Epoch: A period during which the system checks that all validators behave correctly. Incorrect behavior may result in removal from the validator group.\n\nSatoshi Plus Consensus\n\nThe Satoshi Plus mechanism uses the hash power delegated by BTC miners to Core validators to synchronize blocks mined by BTC miners with the Core network.\n\nAdditionally, DPoS consensus allows token holders to vote and select a set of validators. This allows small token holders to participate in network governance.\n\nThe validator selection process follows a complicated formula, which selects validators from PoW and DPoS consensus mechanisms.\n\nA total of 21 validators with the highest scores in the formula were selected for the 200-block period. Validator misbehavior results in withholding and holding mechanisms. Blocks are mined every 10 minutes, like in the Bitcoin network.\n\nRewards are distributed among validators and the System Reward Contract. Currently, 90% of the rewards are paid to validators. Reward Contract The system pays rewards to relayers and verifiers.\n\nCore DAO Tokenomics\n\nQuoting coinmarketcap.com, CORE is the original utility token of the blockchain. Used for staking and paying gas fees. Core follows the Bitcoin token model, with a total CORE supply of 2.1 billion.\n\nCore also promises to burn a percentage of block rewards and gas fees, similar to the Ethereum model.\n\nThe token emission schedule will be paid for over 81 years. The network hopes to encourage Bitcoin miners to hand over their hash power to the network once significant mining rewards in Bitcoin cease around 2040.\n\nToken supply is allocated as follows:\n\nMining Nodes (839.9 million CORE tokens; 39.995% of total supply): distributed over 81 years.\n\nUsers (525.6 million CORE tokens; 25.029%): Core launched its first airdrop in February 2023.\n\nContributors (Current and Future) (315 million CORE tokens; 15%)\n\nReserve (210 million CORE tokens; 10%)\n\nWealth (199.5 million CORE tokens; 9.5%)\n\nRelayer Rewards (10 million CORE tokens; 0.476%)\n\nWhen Did Core Dao Become Popular?\n\nCore DAO has adopted zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology into its blockchain structure, increasing privacy, scalability, and security.\n\nZKP allows users to prove the truth of a statement without having to reveal additional information, thereby maintaining confidentiality and protecting sensitive data.\n\nBy incorporating ZKP technology, Core DAO opens the door to innovations in smart contract functionality and expands the scope of applications that can be implemented on the Core DAO platform.\n\nWith a strong vision, advanced technology, and support from the community, Core DAO promises a bright future in the blockchain world. As the blockchain industry continues to evolve, zero-knowledge-proof technology is expected to play an important role in shaping the future of decentralized applications (dApps) and the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nComparison of Core Dao with Blockchain, Which is Better?\n\nQuoting coinmarketcap.com, Core DAO emphasized that this platform significantly leverages the advantages of other blockchains and combines the strengths of each while reducing their weaknesses. The results can be seen from the comparison of Core with other blockchains, including:\n\n1. Core vs Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin was the first popular blockchain and the first blockchain to introduce proof-of-work. It has become the most decentralized chain but can only process seven transactions per second. According to Core, the Core blockchain improves Bitcoin with higher throughput.\n\n2. Core vs Ethereum\n\nEthereum is the most popular smart contract blockchain and created the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Ethereum can also process more TPS than Bitcoin but is still limited to 15 TPS.\n\nCore aims to improve Ethereum with better scalability and less centralization, which he says is still a risk even with Ethereum\u2019s scalability plans.\n\n3. Core vs Solana\n\nSolana is a chain with high TPS and short block times. However, the requirements for validators go far beyond those of other blockchains.\n\nAdditionally, Solana\u2019s network availability lags behind other chains. Core aims to excel in both aspects.\n\n4. Core Dao vs BNB Chain\n\nBNB Chain was initially forked from the Ethereum chain and uses a Proof of Stake Authority consensus mechanism. It has faster transaction times and higher throughput, although this comes at the cost of decentralization.\n\nPi Network and Core DAO, Which One is Superior?\n\nEveryone has a personal view on which is better between Pi Network and Core DAO. However, if asked to determine which is better, the answer depends on the needs and preferences of each user.\n\nFor example, Pi Network can be ideal for beginners new to blockchain technology. This project is also suitable for those looking for a blockchain platform with the convenience of free coin mining.\n\nMeanwhile, Core DAO may be better suited to those interested in a community-based governance model, including recognizing new blockchains as a way to interact. It is important to note that both of these blockchain projects are still in the development stage.\n\nJudging the merits of either of the two can be quite difficult. Although theoretically, Core DAO has an advantage with projects already active on mainnet.\n\nOn the other hand, the Pi Network hackathon stands out in terms of utility with various unique protocols in its ecosystem. Core DAO also has the advantage of building a complex user ecosystem after operating on the mainnet.\n\nPi Network\u2019s testnet ecosystem also provides an overview of how the mainnet ecosystem will function when released.\n\nWith more than 360 hackathon submissions in the first quarter of 2023, despite superior comparisons, both offer such exciting prospects that they have become a topic of discussion on social media.\n\nCrypto asset projects, with their uniqueness, have an appeal to various individuals. Considering the many interesting crypto projects available, the choice can be tailored to individual wishes and preferences.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, CORE DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization, is important in depicting innovation in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nBy understanding the essence of CORE DAO, we see how the platform incorporates the latest technologies, such as zero-knowledge proof, to increase privacy, scalability, and security within its blockchain.\n\nCORE DAO in the blockchain ecosystem is important because of its major contribution to solving the blockchain trilemma, namely providing a balanced solution between decentralization, scalability, and security.\n\nCORE DAO has also pioneered new consensus mechanisms, such as Satoshi Plus, which combines the power of Proof of Work and Delegated Proof of Stake. Therefore, CORE DAO plays an important role in shaping the future of blockchain technology by introducing its innovative approach.\n\nAs an evolving platform, CORE DAO has the potential to significantly impact the blockchain ecosystem\u2019s evolution towards a higher level of maturity.\n\nInvest in Crypto Assets on INDODAX\n\nSo, now you understand what CORE DAO is, its history and inventor, how it works, its main role in the ecosystem, and how it compares to other blockchains.\n\nNext, if you are interested in investing in crypto, you should check the crypto market on INDODAX Market.

        "title": "Ethereum's liquid staking protocols experience remarkable growth, surpassing $27 billion in value - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "The landscape of liquid staking protocols in the Ethereum ecosystem has experienced significant growth over the past six months, indicating a robust upward trend in both the volume and value of Ether (ETH) deposits.\n\nEthereum\u2019s dominance in liquid staking\n\nAs of January 6, 2024, Ethereum-based liquid staking protocols have locked in 12.31 million ETH, a substantial increase from the 10.16 million recorded on July 5, 2023. This rise translates to an impressive value growth from $19.69 billion to $27.49 billion. Lido Finance, a leading player in this domain, has also seen a dramatic rise in Ethereum holdings, amassing 1.7 million ETH since July 2023, holding over 75% of the total deposited Ethereum.\n\nLiquid staking protocols are revolutionizing how investors interact with Ethereum, allowing them to stake their ETH while retaining liquidity. This is achieved through derivative tokens like Lido\u2019s STETH or Rocket Pool\u2019s RETH, representing the staked capital and accrued rewards. These tokens can be used across various decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.\n\nKey players and market dynamics\n\nThe past six months have witnessed notable shifts in the liquid staking space. Lido\u2019s Ethereum reserves have increased by 21.16%, accounting for a staggering 9.26 million ETH. On the other hand, Rocket Pool\u2019s holdings have grown from 810,502 ETH to 1.09 million. Binance\u2018s liquid staking protocol has exponentially increased, with its Ethereum holdings skyrocketing by 981%, from 72,077 ETH to 779,785 ETH.\n\nThis period also observed shifts in market positions among various protocols. Coinbase\u2019s staking service, previously the second-largest, has now fallen to the fifth position. New entrants like Mantle and Swell have risen in the ranks, holding 174,532 and 142,725 ETH, respectively. Stakewise has seen a modest increase in its Ethereum holdings, from 91,910 to 97,199 ETH.\n\nFuture outlook\n\nThe addition of 2.15 million ETH, valued at $4.83 billion, across the top 27 liquid staking protocols signifies a strong and growing interest in Ethereum-based liquid staking. This trend highlights the increasing trust and participation in Ethereum\u2019s staking mechanisms, which is a crucial aspect of the network\u2019s security and functionality.\n\nEthereum\u2019s leading position in the liquid staking market is a testament to its robust ecosystem and the confidence it commands among investors. As Ethereum continues to evolve and expand its capabilities, the liquid staking sector is likely to witness further growth and diversification, playing a vital role in the broader DeFi landscape.\n\nThe momentum behind Ethereum and its liquid staking protocols shows no signs of abating, pointing to a vibrant and dynamic future for Ethereum\u2019s staking ecosystem. As investors continue to seek avenues for passive income generation within the cryptocurrency space, Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking protocols stand out as a compelling and increasingly popular option."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency investors and enthusiasts have been closely monitoring Ethereum\u2018s recent market movements as large investors, often referred to as \u201cwhales,\u201d have acquired a significant amount of Ethereum (ETH) in the past month.\n\nWith over 410,000 ETH worth nearly $1 billion in total, this development has sparked interest and speculation within the crypto community.\n\nEthereum whales are on the move\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Ethereum whales, individuals or entities holding substantial amounts of the cryptocurrency, have been active in accumulating more ETH over the past month.\n\nThe data suggests that these whales have collectively acquired over 410,000 ETH, which currently translates to nearly $1 billion in market value.\n\nMarket impact and implications\n\nThis substantial influx of capital into Ethereum has not gone unnoticed in the cryptocurrency market. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has experienced increased demand and rising prices as a result of these whale purchases.\n\nWhile some might view this as a positive sign of confidence in Ethereum\u2019s future, it has also raised questions and concerns regarding potential market manipulation.\n\nThe recent acquisition of Ethereum by Whales has led to a debate within the crypto community about the motives behind these purchases. Some argue that whales are accumulating ETH as a long-term investment, anticipating future price appreciation.\n\nOthers speculate that these large purchases could be part of a broader strategy, potentially aimed at influencing the market.\n\nMarket dynamics and whales\u2019 influence\n\nEthereum\u2019s decentralized nature has always been one of its defining features. However, the concentration of a significant portion of ETH in the hands of a few whales raises questions about the extent of their influence over the market.\n\nLarge-scale transactions by whales can trigger volatility and affect price movements, leading to concerns about market stability and fairness.\n\nThe accumulation of substantial amounts of cryptocurrency by whales has caught the attention of regulators worldwide. Governments and financial authorities are increasingly focusing on the cryptocurrency space, aiming to establish regulations that ensure fair and transparent market practices. The actions of Ethereum whales may contribute to the urgency of these regulatory efforts.\n\nThe recent activity of Ethereum whales has led to divided opinions within the cryptocurrency community. Some investors view these large purchases as a positive sign of confidence in Ethereum\u2019s technology and its potential to disrupt traditional finance. Others remain cautious, emphasizing the need for transparency and equitable market practices.\n\nMarket reaction and price trends\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has experienced fluctuations in response to the significant whale activity. While the overall trend has been upward, the market has witnessed periods of heightened volatility. This dynamic underscores the potential impact that large-scale transactions by whales can have on Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory.\n\nThe debate surrounding Ethereum whales and their influence on the cryptocurrency market is likely to continue. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem evolves and matures, it is essential to address concerns related to market manipulation, transparency, and investor protection.\n\nThis ongoing discussion highlights the need for a robust regulatory framework to ensure the long-term sustainability and integrity of the cryptocurrency market."

        "title": "Ethereum Founder Counters Diversification Caution - TronWeekly",
        "content": "In response to a post cautioning against diversification, the founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, vehemently disagreed with the advice and offered his financial insights. Alex\u2019s post referenced Bill Gates\u2019 decision to diversify his portfolio after befriending Warren Buffett, resulting in a current fortune of $138 billion. However, Alex argued that had Gates not diversified, his net worth could have reached a staggering $1.33 trillion.\n\nAfter Bill Gates became friends with Warren Buffett, he began to diversify his portfolio and sold Microsoft shares. Bill Gates\u2019s fortune today is 138 billion dollars; if he hadn\u2019t diversified, it would be 1.33 trillion dollars. Be careful with diversification and with friends who recommend it.\n\nButerin cautioned against disregarding diversification and being wary of friends who advocate for it. His financial advice emphasized the benefits of diversification, urging individuals to save and accumulate enough to cover several years of expenses for financial safety, equating it to freedom. He advised investors to find most of their portfolio boring and cautioned against using leverage greater than 2x.\n\nNotably, Buterin\u2019s financial insights are not a new occurrence, as he has previously shared detailed annotations and comprehensive diagrams. His exploration of six fundamental elements\u2014merge, surge, scourge, verge, purge, and splurge\u2014has provided valuable insights into financial strategies.\n\nEthereum Leap Into Single-Slot Finality\n\nShifting gears to Ethereum\u2019s recent developments, Buterin highlighted the completion of the merger, a monumental transformation for the platform. The leading smart contract network transitioned from a power-intensive proof-of-work [PoW] consensus mechanism to a more environmentally friendly proof-of-stake [PoS] protocol. This shift significantly reduced the network\u2019s energy consumption, making it a notable milestone in Ethereum\u2019s evolution.\n\nOne key aspect Buterin elucidated was Ethereum\u2019s progress in single-slot finality [SSF]. This advancement ensures irreversible changes to blockchain blocks without requiring staking of at least 33% of the total ETH. The move towards SSF enhances Ethereum\u2019s efficiency while simultaneously diminishing its carbon footprint, contributing to a more sustainable and eco-friendly blockchain network."

        "title": "Ethereum Hits Yearly High; InQubeta Presale Gains Attention of Ethereum Whales - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "Many are calling Ethereum (ETH) a good cryptocurrency investment to make right now as its prices broke the $2,400 resistance level and went as high as $2,438 before coming back to settle down around $2,200-$2,300. That\u2019s as high as ETH prices have been since the 2022 crash. Some analysts are viewing ETH\u2019s current momentum as a sign it might make a strong push to reclaim highs set in 2021 at $4,627.\n\nOne of the new DeFi projects launched on the Ethereum network, InQubeta (QUBE), is also poised for substantial growth. QUBE prices closed out 2023 with 175% gains, and its presale has currently raised over $8 million. The platform takes on traditional investing channels by providing an alternative that doesn\u2019t come with earnings and geographic requirements. The project focuses exclusively on opening investments in the fastest-growing technological space: artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nInQubeta dubbed a good cryptocurrency investment to make in 2024\n\nInQubeta is one of the best NFT crypto projects around, and it uses the functionality of the Ethereum network to create an efficient investment protocol. Its native token, QUBE, is an ERC20 coin that serves as the project\u2019s native currency and governance tokens.\n\nAI startups raise capital by minting investment opportunities into non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that are fractionalized before being added to the ERC20 token list. The process revolutionizes how AI firms engage with their communities and raise capital to advance their projects.\n\nThe NFT made by these startups works similarly to how stocks work. They increase in value as their makers grow their market capitalization, and, unlike many of the most popular NFTs, their value is based on tangible assets, not just speculation.\n\nThe future of AI\n\nThe future of artificial intelligence couldn\u2019t be more exciting as the technology\u2019s viability continues to rise at a considerable rate. Startups are at the forefront of a huge portion of the innovation that has taken place in the past decade, from robotics to machine learning.\n\nHowever, investing in such startups has been a daunting task for those who don\u2019t have Silicon Valley or Wall Street-type connections. For example, investors must show they\u2019ve earned over $200,000 for at least two years straight to be eligible for angel investment opportunities.\n\nInQubeta gives investors the power to bypass such unreasonable requirements, democratizing access to AI investments.\n\nLeveraging the power of blockchain technology, smart contracts, and non-fungible tokens allows InQubeta to create an investment process that is more efficient than mainstream alternatives while offering full transparency. Investors don\u2019t just get to invest in AI in the ecosystem, they have a voice in the direction the project moves toward in the future.\n\nInvesting in AI today is a lot like backing companies like Netflix while the internet revolution unfolded. Those who invested appropriately have earned themselves substantial returns from these companies.\n\nEthereum (ETH) off to a great start in 2024\n\nThe aggregate value of the total value locked in Ethereum-based protocols surpassed the locked volume of all other blockchains in the opening days of 2024. Ethereum L2s hold over $20.7 billion in locked value, while the remaining blockchains share a total of $19.6 billion.\n\nEthereum only reported 81% gains in the last year, but the top crypto coin could enjoy considerable growth this year, given the current price projections for Bitcoin (BTC). ETH price charts have historically imitated BTC charts to an extent, and some analysts expect new all-time highs to be set this year, especially if an Ethereum exchange-traded fund is approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nSummary\n\nBuying up QUBE and ETH may be the best crypto investment you can make today, as both will likely bring massive profits this year. ETH prices might triple as cryptocurrency markets boom, while QUBE could grow as much as 10,000% this year.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities\n\n."

        "content": "In a recent announcement on X, Ethereum Insider Steven Nerayoff has revealed an imminent revelation that threatens to expose unprecedented criminal activities within the Ethereum network.\n\nThe Ethereum insider who threatens to reveal criminal activities within the network\n\nNerayoff\u2019s warning alludes to evidence that could expose individuals who are currently posing as altruists, implying far-reaching consequences for the cryptographic community.\n\nNerayoff, a key figure during the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of Ethereum, stated that certain selected entities allegedly control a substantial portion of Ether and exert significant influence over various cryptocurrencies.\n\nHe claims that these entities are involved in numerous dubious activities, including most mining operations, fraudulent ICOs, and exploits in the cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nFormer Ethereum developer Lane Rettig echoed some of Nerayoff\u2019s claims, stating that 70% of the pre-mined ETH was distributed quickly, implying that a significant portion went to Ethereum founders or closely associated individuals.\n\nDespite the seriousness of these accusations, none of the founders of Ethereum or their associates have denied Nerayoff\u2019s claims, leading him to believe that their silence is indicative of the truthfulness of his statements.\n\nNerayoff\u2019s examination extends to Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin, whom he accuses of being a \u201cfalse altruist\u201d and making calculated financial decisions, apparently contradicting Buterin\u2019s professed indifference to monetary matters.\n\nThe Ethereum insider goes further, suggesting that Buterin could be among the criminals he was referring to in his previous remarks, even claiming that Buterin would have risked half of Ethereum\u2019s ICO proceeds in a bet on Bitcoin, and then appealing to the Chinese government for assistance.\n\nNerayoff\u2019s statements and accusations against Buterin\n\nThe gravity of Nerayoff\u2019s statements raises concerns about the integrity of the Ethereum ecosystem, prompting a closer examination of the alleged irregularities within its foundational structure.\n\nWhile the cryptographic community anxiously awaits the publication of the promised evidence by Nerayoff, the implications of these revelations could potentially reshape the perception of key figures and entities within the Ethereum network.\n\nThis seismic revelation by Ethereum Insider Steven Nerayoff has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community, casting a shadow over the transparency and reliability of Ethereum\u2019s foundational elements.\n\nWith the impending revelation, the cryptocurrency space is preparing for potential repercussions and reevaluating its trust in prominent figures.\n\nThe accusations made by Nerayoff against Vitalik Buterin, one of the most influential figures in the world of cryptocurrencies, represent a significant challenge to Ethereum\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe accusation against Buterin of being a \u201cfalse altruist\u201d and questioning his financial decisions has raised some concerns, especially considering Buterin\u2019s central role in defining the trajectory of Ethereum.\n\nThe claim that Buterin risked a substantial portion of the ICO proceeds on a Bitcoin bet, followed by an appeal to the Chinese government, adds an additional level of intrigue and potential financial risk.\n\nThe broader accusation that a selected group controls a significant portion of Ether and manipulates the dynamics of the crypto landscape raises concerns about the decentralization of Ethereum.\n\nIf these accusations prove to be true, they could undermine the ethics of blockchain technology, which is built on principles of decentralization and transparency. Furthermore, it questions the governance structure of Ethereum and the potential concentration of power within the network.\n\nLane Rettig\u2019s support for some of Nerayoff\u2019s statements adds credibility to the narrative.\n\nConclusions on the matter\n\nThe statement that the majority of pre-mined PFs has been distributed rapidly, with implications for Ethereum founders or their close collaborators, introduces a dimension of wealth distribution that may warrant further investigations.\n\nThe silence of the founders and shareholders of Ethereum in response to these serious accusations is remarkable. If Nerayoff\u2019s claims are unfounded, one could expect a quick and emphatic denial to protect the reputation of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe absence of such denials could fuel speculation and uncertainty within the community.\n\nWhile the cryptocurrency community eagerly awaits the publication of the promised evidence by Nerayoff, the anticipation for a thorough and impartial investigation into these allegations is growing.\n\nThe potential exposure of data revealing criminals posing as altruists could represent a turning point for Ethereum, requiring a transparent and responsible response from its leadership.\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum finds itself at a crossroads, with its credibility and integrity hanging in the balance. The imminent revelation by Steven Nerayoff has the potential to reshape perceptions, influence market dynamics, and induce a reevaluation of Ethereum\u2019s fundamental principles.\n\nThe cryptocurrency community is holding its breath as the curtain rises on what could be a decisive moment for Ethereum and its stakeholders."

        "content": "This surge in POWR is due to the introduction of xGrid 2.0, which aims to decentralize the energy grid and enhance the renewable energy transition.\n\nAnalyst Cryptonnoisseur suggests a cautious approach, expressing disinterest in $POWR until it reaches $0.44 while acknowledging the possibility of a relief bounce from the current $0.49 level.\n\nIn a surprising turn amidst the predominantly bearish cryptocurrency market, Power Ledger (POWR), an Ethereum-based altcoin, has experienced a remarkable surge of over 110% in the past seven days reaching as high as $1.18.\n\nAt the time of reporting, the native token of the blockchain designed for decentralized and distributed energy markets, POWR, is trading at an impressive $0.42. This surge represents a substantial increase from its weekly low of $0.35. The cryptocurrency, currently ranked 171st by market capitalization, witnessed a massive surge over the weekend.\n\nPower Ledger\u2019s mission, as stated on its official website, revolves around decentralizing the energy grid, promoting the transition to renewable energy, and assisting consumers in monitoring their power usage.\n\nThe recent surge in POWR\u2019s value coincided with the introduction of xGrid 2.0, the latest version of Power Ledger\u2019s blockchain-enabled energy trading platform. The new platform boasts a \u201cmodern and minimalistic\u201d user interface (UI) and enhanced flexibility with demand and percentage-based secondary market power purchase agreements (PPA).\n\nPower Purchase Agreements (PPAs), commonly utilized for renewable energy sources, involve third-party developers installing and operating energy systems on their customers\u2019 properties. This allows customers to receive low-cost energy, while developers can sell excess electricity generated by the system, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nDespite the recent gains, POWR remains more than 61% below its all-time high of $1.89, which it reached in January 2018, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nPowerledger (POWR) Faces Pump and Dump\n\nHowever, it seems that there\u2019s a classic case of pump-and-dump for Powerledger, as the POWR price tanked by nearly 66% from its high of $1.18 on Sunday, January 7. As of press time, POWR is trading within its support zone at $0.4219 with a market cap of $215 million. Despite this current shakeup, the POWR stock remains 16% up on the weekly chart.\n\nCrypto analyst Cryptonnoisseur has conveyed a reserved stance on the Power Ledger ($POWR) cryptocurrency, expressing disinterest until it reaches the $0.44 mark. While acknowledging the potential for a relief bounce from the current $0.49 level, Cryptonnoisseur advises against expecting it to sustain.\n\nThe analyst recommends adopting a patient approach and waiting for further market developments. Cryptonnoisseur suggests that the cryptocurrency may undergo a period of consolidation before potentially showcasing an upside movement towards $1.3.\n\nInvestors are advised to exercise caution and closely monitor $POWR\u2019s performance, considering the potential for market fluctuations in the coming days. Cryptonnoisseur\u2019s insights provide a perspective on the current dynamics of $POWR and highlight the importance of strategic decision-making in the volatile crypto landscape.\n\n."

        "content": "Key Takeaways:\n\nEthereum is showing a few bearish signs from the $2,500 resistance zone.\n\nETH/USD traded below a key bullish trend line with support at $2,250 on the daily chart.\n\nThe price could decline sharply toward $1,985 if it fails to stay above the 50-day simple moving average (blue).\n\nNew Delhi(CoinChapter.com): Ethereum (ETH) is struggling to stay above the $2,200 support. The price is showing signs of uptrend exhaustion and might dive toward $1,985.\n\nEthereum Price Signals Short-term Top\n\nIn the past few days, Ethereum price made a few attempts to gain bullish momentum above the $2,400 resistance zone. However, ETH struggled to settle above $2,400. It saw a couple of rejection patterns near the $2,450 zone.\n\nThe last swing high was formed near $2,447 before the price corrected lower. There was a sharp decline below the $2,320 and $2,300 levels. The price even dived below the 50-day simple moving average (blue), but there was no daily close. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the main increase from the $1,521 swing low to the $2,447 high.\n\nEthereum price daily chart | Source: ETH/USD on TradingView.com Ethereum price daily chart | Source: ETH/USD on TradingView.com Ethereum price daily chart | Source: ETH/USD on TradingView.com\n\nEthereum is still holding the 50-day simple moving average (blue), like Bitcoin. The current price action and technical structure suggest that the price is struggling to continue higher and might extend its decline.\n\nThe first key support sits at the 50-day simple moving average (blue) at $2,200. A daily close below the $2,200 support zone could spark bearish moves.\n\nThe next key support sits at $2,135, below which Ethereum might dive toward the 50% Fib retracement level of the main increase from the $1,521 swing low to the $2,447 high at $1,985. Perhaps more losses may send the price toward the $1,740 pivot level in the coming weeks.\n\nAnother Increase in ETH?\n\nConversely, Ethereum might remain stable above $2,200 or $2,135 and attempt another increase. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $2,280 level.\n\nA convincing daily close above the $2,280 level might send ETH toward the $2,350 resistance. The main resistance sits at $2,450. If the bulls clear the $2,450 hurdle, the price could see a 10%-15% rally. In the stated case, the price could even test the $3,000 handle.\n\nOverall, Ethereum price is consolidating near the 50-DSMA, with a minor bearish angle. A daily close below $2,200 and $2,135 might send it toward $1,985. On the other hand, the price might make another attempt to surpass $2,450 in the coming days."

        "content": "The Ethereum blockchain has been a cradle for innovation in the cryptocurrency space, particularly with the advent of various token standards. Among these, the ERC-20 standard has been a cornerstone, fostering the growth of a multitude of tokens and decentralized applications (DApps). However, as the ecosystem evolves, a new player has emerged, offering a promising alternative: ERC-223. This innovative standard is not just a mere upgrade; it\u2019s a game-changer, poised to redefine the way we interact with tokens on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe Pitfalls of ERC-20\n\nWhile ERC-20 tokens have been instrumental in the blockchain revolution, they are not without their flaws. One of the most significant issues has been the loss of tokens. It\u2019s estimated that a staggering amount of money, running into millions of dollars, has been lost due to tokens being mistakenly sent to incompatible contracts on the ERC-20 network. This flaw stems from a fundamental design oversight in the ERC-20 protocol, where tokens can be irretrievably lost when transferred to a contract instead of a wallet address.\n\nWhy ERC-223 is the Solution\n\nERC-223 emerges as a beacon of efficiency and safety in this landscape. It addresses the critical problem of token loss in ERC-20 by ensuring that tokens sent to a contract are either correctly processed or the transaction is reverted. This feature alone is monumental, saving users from inadvertent losses and bolstering confidence in token transactions.\n\nThe Advantages of ERC-223\n\nEnhanced Security: By preventing token loss through erroneous transfers, ERC-223 enhances the overall security of the Ethereum network.\n\nReduced Gas Costs: ERC-223 transactions are more efficient. They combine the transfer and contract execution in one step, reducing the gas costs associated with token transfers.\n\nBackward Compatibility: ERC-223 tokens are backward compatible with ERC-20 tokens, meaning they can be handled by services and wallets that support ERC-20. Improved User Experience: With its safeguards and efficiencies, ERC-223 offers a more user-friendly experience, encouraging broader adoption of blockchain technology.\n\nDex223 and D223: A Case in Point\n\nIn the realm of decentralized exchanges (DEXs), Dex223 stands out, leveraging the ERC-223 standard for its operations. Their native token, D223, is a testament to the practicality and future potential of ERC-223 tokens. While Dex223 and D223 are just one example, they exemplify the growing adoption and confidence in the ERC-223 standard.\n\nWhy ERC-20 Tokens Should Switch to ERC-223"

        "content": "Exciting is an understatement, given the events that happened this week in the crypto space. In a remarkable turn of events, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) transaction fees surpassed Ethereum\u2019s (ETH). This surge was fueled by increased activity on the network, with the BTC price soaring ahead of the anticipated SEC approval of Bitcoin ETFs. Meanwhile, InQubeta (QUBE), a top ICO, took off in style, with a staggering $8 million raised so far in its early funding.\n\nThis post will explore the uptick in Bitcoin\u2019s transaction fees\u2014surging past Ethereum gas fees. In addition, it will cover the exceptional performance of InQubeta in its presale phase, explaining what makes it the best new crypto to invest in.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE): Passing $8 Million Fundraising Milestone\n\nThe InQubeta (QUBE) presale took off, and it did so in style. Building on its momentum last year, this top ICO has raised an astounding $8 million in early funding. With further upsides in the coming weeks and explosive growth after launch, it is positioned as one of the best cryptos to invest in.\n\nAs a fascinating blend of artificial intelligence (AI) and crypto, it stands out as one of the most bullish narratives in the crypto space right now. What will be its unique offerings after launch, you might wonder? This intriguing convergence of AI and blockchain aims to solve the fundraising challenge in the fast-growing AI sector. By simply minting investment opportunities as equity-based NFTs, tech startups can raise capital.\n\nThat won\u2019t be all. The ecosystem will feature an NFT marketplace. Here, investors can browse and choose promising AI startups and become early backers. The coolest part? There will be no limit on investment, with democratized access promised.\n\nAt the time of this writing, this presale is in its sixth round, and a token costs only $0.01925. According to top experts, there will be a 55x increase in its price in the first six months after launch. Hence, it is positioned as one of the best coins to invest in. If you wish to become an early holder, simply click the link below to grab a bag and HODL to the moon.\n\nBitcoin (BTC): What Factors are Fueling the Surge in Transaction Fees?\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is, without a doubt, the best cryptocurrency. If you are still wondering why \u2013 it is highly favored among institutions as well as many investors. This is due to its exceptional value as a hedge against inflation and other macroeconomic factors. Following closely behind is Ethereum (ETH), another blue-chip token.\n\nIn exciting crypto news that has taken the landscape by storm, Bitcoin\u2019s transaction fees recently eclipsed Ethereum\u2019s. Typically, Ethereum is known for its high gas fees; thus, this phenomenon has resulted in raised eyebrows. What factors can be linked to this development, then?\n\nThe rise in activity on the Bitcoin network is the primary cause of its transaction fees soaring. This further begs the question: Why is there a spike in activity? With Bitcoin set to skyrocket due to the anticipated approval of spot ETFs by the SEC, there has been renewed bullish momentum. Many are aiming to ride its bullish wave; hence, an accumulation frenzy and HODLing.\n\nConclusion\n\nAn interesting development that has been creating quite a buzz is Bitcoin\u2019s transaction fees eclipsing Ethereum\u2019s. With excitement surrounding the anticipated surge in the price of Bitcoin, there has been a frenzy. At the same time, InQubeta\u2014hailed as the best ICO\u2014is aiming for a 55x surge after its launch.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities"

        "title": "New ICO Token's +950000% ROI Potential Makes BONK, ETH, & Shiba Inu Traders Invest Fast & Big - Blockchain Reporter",
        "content": "Bonk Inu (BONK), Ethereum (ETH), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Tether (USDT), Ripple (XRP), Polygon (MATIC), and Dogecoin (DOGE) cryptocurrency traders appear to all agree on one thing currently; Mollars initial Coin offering has a +10,000% ROI prediction that\u2019s worth learning about.\n\nMentioned as the New Bitcoin by crypto media giant CryptoPotato and the top ICO for 2024, according to ICOHolder.com\u2019s hot list, Mollars is the future for Ethereum-blockchain users. It\u2019s a solution that can\u2019t be ignored by the intelligence of millions of crypto wallets on the ERC-20 network. No longer will crypto traders lose money in horrendous fees to buy Bitcoin as Mollars will make it so Ethereum-Blockchain users can have a store-of-value token with low minting numbers on-chain.\n\nMollars is an Intelligent Solution For Ethereum Users\n\nWhile to the novice, saving money on $BTC cross-chain swapping may not seem much. However, Bitcoin has seen fees in 4th quarter 2023 that were the worst in 2 years. Last November, the average Bitcoin trader lost nearly $39 per $BTC transaction. The founding coin\u2019s fees have gotten so bad, they now exceed all other blockchains according to a report from DailyCoin.\n\nApparently this issue was analyzed long before it was reported. And Ethereum crypto guru plotted the creation of the \u201cMollars Saves Dollar\u201d movement and $MOLLARS token concept to rid Ethereum-blockchain users of the hassle of cross-chain swaps for the $BTC and loss of major money to fees. That movement & concept materialized into the launch of the Mollars.com initial coin offering, which offers the $MOLLARS token in the presale stage to foster infrastructure and stability for the New Bitcoin for Ethereum users.\n\nTether (USDT), Ethereum (ETH), & Bonk Inu (BONK) Traders Buying The Most Mollars ICO Tokens\n\nTraders who buy now via Mollars.com private exchange, get the new ERC-20 token at the discounted rate of US$0.30. This is half the price of what it will cost on it\u2019s first public crypto exchange, US$0.62.\n\nThe ROI yields of just over +100% are appetizing to any investor. As word spreads through the crypto newsphere, Investors are coming from all cryptocurrency groups. However, the most notable investments are coming from Ethereum (ETH), Bonk Inu (BONK), Ripple (XRP), Polygon (MATIC), Ripple (XRP), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Tether (USDT) cryptocurrency holders. Tether holders most notably perhaps, have seen a spike of over +900% in sales in the last 7 days. That group is followed by Ethereum & Bonk Inu traders who have risen by nearly +600% each.\n\nInvestor buys are likely to keep rising as predictions are released by different blog analysts and independent sources. Mollars tokens will be limited to 10,000,000 [million] tokens total supply for eternity. This stat is particularly appetizing to crypto investors because that is half of the supply of Bitcoin [21-million], a crypto coin that\u2019s yielded over +20,000,000% returns on investments to ICO investors of 2011. With the $MOLLARS token offering an intelligent solution to a well-noted issue for $BTC investors on the Ethereum-blockchain, it\u2019s almost certain thousands will fancy the \u2018New Bitcoin\u2019 over the old.\n\nWildcard Prediction Suggests ROI Yields Of +950,000% Long-Term\n\nLong term, if $MOLLARS were to follow the trajectory of $Bitcoin, a simple & long-shot analysis would suggest the token could return nearly +950,000% ROI.\n\nThis wildcard prediction comes from the formula of Bitcoin having a +20,000,000% ROI yield on 21-million tokens. That yield is 1-million percent less than the total tokens, over 13 years. This means that in the same time frame, 10-million Mollars tokens could have a +9,500,000% yield \u2014 simply reverse engineering the logistics of the $BTC yields and applying it to Mollars.\n\nIt may sound crazy, but Bitcoin was crazy to most in 2011. At US$0.30 cents, it\u2019s much better to lose $3 on 10 coins than miss the next Bitcoin for certain.\n\nOther key statistics about the Mollars token revolve around its decentralization. The ERC-20 token will have no owner. Also, the full minted supply will be sold on exchange and no one will be gifted tokens from the supply ever. The $MOLLARS token anyone holds, including founder or developers, will have to be purchased in the ICO or once on public exchange, fair trade to all.\n\nThe total fundraising goal of the Mollars initial coin offering is US$2,000,000 according to the official Whitepapers. If that hard cap is reached, half of funds will go towards the token\u2019s CEX liquidity pool. The other half will go towards a token culture catalyzing web3 product\u2019s development, marketing, brand value and equity building, and other long-term infrastructure needs that will be pre-set and run in autonomy before and after CEX listing.\n\nOnce the $2-Million-dollar hardcap is met, the Mollars ICO will end or on the deadline of May 2024. Analysts across various websites predict this token presale will likely end early based on current buyer growth however.\n\nOnly 4-million tokens will be sold at the discounted rate during the $MOLLARS initial coin offering. That is 40% of the total token supply being minted [ever] of the store-of-value token. If sold-out, it leaves only 6-million tokens for the public crypto trading exchanges to sell. A sell-out of the 4-million presale tokens during the 6 months of this ICO makes it highly plausible that the remaining 6-million tokens could be sold out during the 7 months to remain in 2024 after the ICO\u2019s official deadline.\n\nIf sold-out in 2024, any prediction above from crypto analysts about $MOLLARS token could materialize, including the yields of +950,000% ROI. In layman\u2019s terms, that\u2019s a 950x on initial coin offering investments.\n\nBiggest Investors Thus Far In Mollars ICO\n\nNearly 100,000 $Mollars tokens have already been purchased via Mollars.cc. The daily buy averages are increasing weekly.\n\nThe top buyers of the ICO to date, according to the Initial Coin Offering\u2019s Tether (USDT) & Ethereum (ETH) transaction addresses, both purchased over US$2,000 of the mollars token.\n\nOn Friday, one Ethereum trader invested 1.15 $ETH into $MOLLARS. This one transaction amounts to US$2,575 or ~8584 Mollars tokens. If the investor holds long term and the \u2018New Bitcoin\u2019 leaps to 950x the current value, their 1.15 Ethereum tokens would yield a staggering $2.44-million-dollar return on investment.\n\nOn Wednesday, January 3rd, a Tether (USDT) trader decided to start their New Year\u2019s holiday by making a potential life changing investment of over US$2,000 as well. This is the second biggest investment spotted on the Mollars transaction list. This 2nd place trader invested $2,050 worth of $USDT in a total of 3 transactions \u2014 $1000, $1000, and $50. Their investment of 2,050 USDT will net a profit of a whopping $1.94-Million-dollars if the investors hold long term and the wildcard prediction is found to be true.\n\nCrypto Shrimps & Dolphins but Smart Investors\n\nRegardless, both trades will have the chance to double their investments in a few months once this ICO launches on a public crypto exchange by May of 2024. Also, for both traders to have thousands of dollars to invest, which is more than many people have in their bank account to their name in 2024, they must have some sort of financial intelligence to have obtained such amounts for investment.\n\nSee the latest in trader discussion about Mollars on the official subreddit community, r/MollarsToken. This is open to the public and a great way to get unmoderated thoughts from real cryptocurrency investments.\n\nGet the latest sales stats on this dollar-saving Bitcoin-alternative\u2019s token pre-sale or purchase token via Mollars.cc."

Check priceVisit website\n\nThe next one is MinerGate, which was created by a group of cryptocurrency devotees. This application works on Windows, Ubuntu, macOS, and Fedora. It has a very user-friendly interface and offers several unique features. The primary unique feature MinerGate provides is its merged mining service. With this service, you can mine several different crypto coins at the same time, without any decrease in the hash rate! In addition to mining Ethereum, you can also mine Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dashcoin, and other popular cryptocurrencies. All in all, MinerGate is a great tool for mining Ethereum that is both quick and easy to use. It has been reported to be capable of using your hardware\u2019s maximum processing power.

It has a good deal of positive reviews and has a great reputation. One reason why Wineth is popular is that it takes little to no configurations to get things running. The software also comes with a wallet and access to proxy servers (Useful for users in restricted areas). This Ethereum mining software automatically pays you and updates their systems. If you are planning on using your hardware for other tasks, then you can switch Wineth to background mode. In background mode, Wineth will only use a small portion of your computer\u2019s processing power. You can also choose for Wineth to only run/mine when your computer is idle. This way you don\u2019t have to worry about it interfering with your work or play. Perhaps one of the best things about Wineth is that it is validated by DigiCert. This should mean that you will be using servers that have very strong security. On the other hand, Wineth is not completely free. Yes, it is free to download, but you pay the developers by giving 1% of your mining time for them. In other words, the way it seems to work is that if you were to mine for 100 hours, 1 hour will mine Ethereum exclusively for the team behind Wineth. It\u2019s debatable whether or not this deal is good or not. If you don\u2019t mind lending your computer\u2019s processing power to mine Ethereum every now and then, then Wineth is a great application to use, especially for beginners. \u21d2 Get Wineth\n\nThe application is promoted to be immune to fraud, censorship, downtime, and third-party interference. You can use the application as a standalone client or as part of a library. The standalone project named Geth works on all major operating systems, including Windows 10. Go Ethereum can also be embedded in your Android, iOS, or Go projects for greater convenience. Thus you can install this client in various ways, choosing the standalone pre-built bundle or other package managers you want. You can also run this program as a Docker container if you prefer. We recommend this application because it is one of the safest clients to use and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any fees like Wineth. It might take some time to learn how to use Geth, but it will be worth it in the end. \u21d2 Get Official Go Ethereum"

        "title": "Bitcoin SV's Surge Outpaced Bitcoin and Ethereum; AI Altcoin Gains Reddit Community's Attention - Blockzeit",
        "content": "Bitcoin SV (BSV) is a top crypto to invest in right now as it outgrew Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in the last 30 days. BSV prices have increased by 66% in the past month, while BTC prices only enjoyed 5.7% gains, and ETH prices only grew by 2.3%.\n\nBitcoin SV is the by-product of a hard fork of the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain, which was created when the main BTC chain was forked the previous year. The platform aims to fulfill the initial vision of the Bitcoin protocol explained in Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s white paper.\n\nMeanwhile, InQubeta (QUBE) has been generating lots of discussions on sites like Reddit as its presale flies past the $8 million milestone. It was one of the most interesting new DeFi projects launched last year, and many are calling it a good crypto investment to make this year. The Ethereum-hosted project aims to open up access to artificial intelligence (AI) investments by providing an easy-to-access alternative anyone can use to partner with firms looking to advance the technology.\n\nTop crypto to invest in: InQubeta (QUBE) could post as much as 10,000% returns in 2024\n\nInQubeta was one of the best coins to invest in as its presale brought investors 175% returns in 2023, and it\u2019s poised for 60% more before tokens are available on exchanges. Some are already calling it one of the best DeFi projects in the cryptocurrency space right now due to the creative approach it uses to open up access to AI investment opportunities.\n\nArtificial intelligence has improved considerably in the past couple of decades, and the technology now plays an important role in our lives as doctors use it to make their diagnoses more accurate while autonomous taxis pick up fares in San Francisco.\n\nAI\u2019s role will only expand in the coming years, and it is expected to disrupt how many industries operate. Investors with deep pockets have known how significant AI would be for several years as they\u2019ve poured over $120 billion in investment funds into the industry since 2015. Analysts project the total invested in AI will reach $1.5 trillion by 2030, positioning InQubeta for substantial growth as it connects investors with AI startups in need of funding.\n\nA decentralized investment ecosystem\n\nAI companies that are cleared to fundraise on the InQubeta network create ERC20 coins that are digital representations of investment opportunities, just like stocks. Some of these tokens give users other benefits, like discounts on items developed.\n\nERC20 coins are developed on the ecosystem, fractionalized into smaller pieces, and posted on the NFT marketplace. Investors use QUBE to buy the ERC20 coins of firms they think have potential. These tokens can be just as easily resold on the marketplace whenever investors decide to do so.\n\nInQubeta has the potential to be the best NFT crypto, thanks to its easy-to-use and easily-accessible investment ecosystem. Investors don\u2019t have to worry about income requirements when using the platform to invest.\n\nBitcoin SV (BSV) closes out 2023 with huge gains\n\nA small reduction in open positions in BSV contracts has developed in the last few days, and some view this as a sign its bullish momentum has weakened. However, technical indicators like its relative strength index being higher than 70 show there\u2019s still lots of buying pressure. Prices could explode in the coming weeks if the $100 resistance level is broken.\n\nSummary\n\nQUBE and BSV are two top altcoins to watch right now, as both are positioned for considerable growth. BSV could go on to record major gains if its momentum keeps up, while QUBE is expected to surge as high as 100x.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities\n\nBlockzeit Disclaimer: This article is sponsored.
