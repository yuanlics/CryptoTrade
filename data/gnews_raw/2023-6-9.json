        "content": "Ethereum staking is the process of locking up some of your ETH tokens to help validate blocks and secure the Ethereum network. In return, you will receive Ethereum staking rewards in the form of more ETH.\n\nKey Takeaways Staking your ETH provides you with annual percentage yield (APY) rewards on your staked tokens.\n\nOn-chain ETH staking yields are currently around 4% APY.\n\nThere are three methods to stake your Ethereum \u2014 staking through a centralized exchange, staking pools, or running your own node(s). We will cover exactly how to stake ETH using each approach.\n\nFeatured Ethereum Staking Offers For March 2024\n\nNexo Best For Daily Payments Open an Account On Nexo\u2019s site Review 4 Nexo Review Tokens Available ETH ETH Rewards 4% to 12% 4% to 12% Liquid Staking Yes.

Stader Labs introduces the ability to stake MATIC on the Polygon network, opening a yield opportunity for smaller positions.\n\nDeFi integrations: Put your staked assets to work in other DeFi protocols to boost your yield. Options vary by chain and include liquidy pools, lending platforms, and yield optimizers.\n\nNewbie-friendly UI: If you know the basics of working with a DeFi wallet like MetaMask, Stader makes it a breeze to stake assets like MATIC and ETH with a liquid token. Why We Like It DeFi can be intimidating if you\u2019re new to the space, but Stader\u2019s user interface and flow for basic liquid staking help both newcomers and seasoned pros put their crypto to work in a jiffy. Smart contract audits from Halborn and Certik help ensure the code is solid, reducing the risk of exploits.\n\nHow Much Can I Earn By Staking Ethereum?\n\nEthereum staking rewards follow a curve where the more ETH is staked, the lower the rewards are. Post-merge, the APY is hovering at around 5% for Ethereum validators.\n\nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that ETH staking APY is highest for those running their own validator nodes, while those staking Ethereum through a centralized exchange or an ETH staking pool will likely earn a bit less due to the validator fees they will pay. The exception to this is when centralized exchanges boost reward APYs higher than on-chain rates as a marketing effort to attract staking market share.\n\nLearn more about earning crypto interest with our complete guide.\n\nETH 2.0 Staking\n\nAs of 9/15/22, the Ethereum blockchain now uses the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Previously, the network ran using proof-of-work for many years, with the ultimate goal of getting to POS.\n\nFollowing the rollout of ETH staking (ETH 2.0), ETH could not be unstaked. Good news: This restriction has since been lifted with the recent Shanghai upgrade. But in some cases, stakers may still find delays in unstaking because each validator node must have 32 staked ETH.\n\nCrypto always finds a way. To provide access to the value locked in staked ETH, several protocols now offer \u201cliquid staking\u201d covered below.\n\nLido: stETH liquid staking token\n\nstETH liquid staking token Coinbase: cbETH liquid staking token\n\ncbETH liquid staking token Rocketpool: rETH liquid staking token\n\nThis form of ETH staking issues a liquid \u201cstaked token\u201d that can be spent, traded, or used as collateral \u2014 just like regular ETH. The collateral option is particularly attractive to many ETH holders who want to borrow against their ETH without losing their ETH staking rewards.\n\nHow To Stake Ethereum\n\nEach validator on the Ethereum blockchain is required to have 32 ETH staked in order to become a validator. Fortunately, not everyone looking to earn staking rewards has to first save up 32 ETH.\n\nValidators allow smaller ETH holders to delegate their tokens to them and thus earn a part of their Ethereum staking rewards.\n\nBelow we cover how to stake ETH using three common methods, ranging from the easiest to the most difficult:\n\nStaking via a centralized exchange : Exchanges such as Gemini provide support for ETH staking. The process takes just a few clicks and allows you to start earning rewards on your ETH instantly.\n\n: Exchanges such as Gemini provide support for ETH staking. The process takes just a few clicks and allows you to start earning rewards on your ETH instantly. Staking via an ETH staking pool : This intermediate option requires a few more steps but has the added benefit of giving you a liquid token that can be used in place of your staked ETH, even as your tokens remain staked and earn rewards. Lido offers a liquid staking pool, as does Coinbase.\n\n: This intermediate option requires a few more steps but has the added benefit of giving you a liquid token that can be used in place of your staked ETH, even as your tokens remain staked and earn rewards. Lido offers a liquid staking pool, as does Coinbase. Running your own network validator: This is the most direct but also the most challenging way to stake ETH. Running your own validator node requires a 32 ETH stake and a machine that\u2019s on and connected to the internet 24/7.\n\nStaking ETH Via A Centralized Exchange [Easy] Centralized crypto exchanges offer the ability to stake your ETH tokens and earn staking rewards. These rewards vary across exchanges but are usually in the 3% \u2013 7% APY range. Additionally, most exchanges will own the keys to your wallet, which means that your funds will be entrusted to a counterparty. How To Pick A Centralized Exchange Entrusting your crypto to a corporation can be stressful and should only be done when you are sure of the integrity of the company you are working with. Big names like Coinbase are solid options with long-standing reputations in the crypto space. Besides security, the other big consideration when picking a centralized exchange to stake on is the rewards rates that are offered. While Ethereum has an official staking reward rate that applies to all stakers, some platforms provide bigger rewards in an attempt to earn market share. However, be careful of unknown platforms offering APY rates that sound too good to be true \u2014 they often are. Pros And Cons Of Staking ETH With A Centralized Exchange Pros Staking through a centralized exchange is very simple and takes just a few clicks.\n\nSometimes you can get very high APY rates when platforms run specials.\n\nCentralized exchanges provide simple, easy-to-understand tax reporting. Cons Exchanges will store your crypto in their proprietary wallets \u2013 you no longer directly control your crypto.\n\nIf the company experiences a hack or goes out of business, your crypto may be at risk.\n\nStaking through a centralized exchange is generally antithetical to the decentralized ethos. How to stake your ETH on a centralized exchange: Step by step Editor\u2019s pick for best exchange for staking Ethereum: Coinbase.com \u2013 learn more at our full Coinbase review. Step 1: To get started, visit Coinbase to open an account if you don\u2019t have one already. You\u2019ll need complete identity verification. Step 2: Select \u201cMy assets\u201d on the left menu and then look for the Buy & Sell box on the right column. This method is faster, but using Advanced trade saves on fees. You\u2019ll find a full walkthrough on how to use Coinbase Advanced in our Coinbase review. Step 3: Under \u201cMy assets,\u201d click on your ETH balance and choose \u201cStake now.\u201d Staking ETH Via An ETH Staking Pool [Intermediate] The minimum Ethereum balance required to stake as an individual is 32 ETH. Most crypto holders do not have that large of a balance, so innovative solutions for staking with a smaller balance have evolved. While one of these solutions is staking through a large centralized exchange, as covered above, another way is to use an Ethereum staking pool. A staking pool is simply a group of ETH holders getting together and pooling their ETH to reach the 32 token threshold necessary to stake. They then split staking rewards proportionally based on contributions. Staking pools have become a buzzing industry by themselves, with entire crypto platforms being established just to provide staking pools as a service. Not all staking pools, however, are the same. The primary difference is whether a staking pool is liquid or non-liquid: Non-liquid staking pools : Traditional, non-liquid staking pools just allow ETH holders to pool their tokens and take advantage of staking rewards. They do not issue a derivative liquid token that can be traded the way liquid staking pools do.\n\n: Traditional, non-liquid staking pools just allow ETH holders to pool their tokens and take advantage of staking rewards. They do not issue a derivative liquid token that can be traded the way liquid staking pools do. Liquid staking pools: A liquid staking pool will not only pool ETH tokens together, but it will also provide stakers with a derivative token that can be actively traded and used. This option lets stakers earn staking rewards while not losing out on liquidity in the process. Liquid staking pools Non-liquid staking pools Issue Liquid Derivative Token Yes No Potentially Taxable Event Yes No Reward Earning Potential Higher Lower Staking ETH Via a Non-Liquid ETH Staking Pool Non-liquid staking pools are a way for ETH holders to earn staking rewards without having the 32 ETH required to self-stake. Unlike liquid staking pools, non-liquid staking pools do not offer a derivative token that can be traded while your ETH is locked up. An important benefit of non-liquid staking pools compared to liquid staking pools is that non-liquid staking does not create a taxable event. In liquid staking, you get a liquid token (such as stETH) back when you stake your ETH. This token swap, however, is treated like any other token swap and is considered a taxable event by the IRS. Non-liquid staking does not issue a new token, therefore does not incur this tax. Note that the actual staking rewards earned through staking APYs are still considered taxable in both liquid staking and non-liquid staking scenarios. Staking rewards for non-liquid staking pools are usually around 4%-6% APY. While these rewards are not as high as liquid staking pools, they are still a great way to put idle ETH to use and staking pools don\u2019t require a balance threshold of 32 ETH. Our picks for non-liquid staking pools: Everstake Chorus One Bitcoin Suisse Current APY 4.05% 3.64% 5.30% Staking ETH Via a Non-Liquid ETH Staking Pool Non-liquid staking pools are a way for ETH holders to earn staking rewards without having the 32 ETH required to self-stake.

Our picks for non-liquid staking pools: Everstake Chorus One Bitcoin Suisse Current APY 4.05% 3.64% 5.30% Staking ETH Via a Liquid Staking Pool Liquid staking pools generally provide the highest earning opportunity when staking your ETH. Not only do these pools benefit from the official ETH staking rewards, but the liquid tokens they issue can also be lent out or leveraged across DeFi for increased yield. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that since liquid staking providers issue a new token that represents your staked ETH, liquid staking may be a taxable event, as you are swapping one crypto token for another. This is in contrast to non-liquid staking pools, which do not provide a derivative token and thus do not provide additional return potential nor the taxable event when you swap. While the traditional ETH staking rewards are around 5%, using liquidity staking paired with lending or liquidity mining, stakers can achieve APY rewards upwards of 10%. Editor\u2019s Pick: Lido Besides Lido, some other liquid staking providers include: Token Ticker Token Market Cap Current Token APY Rocket Pool rETH $148,447,361 5.26% Stakewise sETH2 $84,916,544 5.92% Ankr aETHc $35,428,861 4.36% How to Pick a Staking Pool Several factors should be considered when picking a staking pool: Fees : Staking pools normally provide lower staking returns than directly staking ETH by running your own validator. This is because they are providing you an intermediary service in setting up the pools that allow your ETH to be staked. Each platform has different fees, and since, for many, the primary goal of ETH staking is to earn as much return as possible, it\u2019s important to compare these fees.\n\n: Staking pools normally provide lower staking returns than directly staking ETH by running your own validator.

Validators : Staking pools delegate their staked funds to validators who perform the function of securing the Ethereum blockchain. The idea behind a blockchain is that power is as decentralized as possible, so picking a staking pool that uses a wide variety of validators or one that\u2019s not as popular as the top staking pools is a good idea for anyone focused on decentralization.\n\n: Staking pools delegate their staked funds to validators who perform the function of securing the Ethereum blockchain.

Security: Liquid staking providers issue their own liquid tokens that are associated with their platforms. The integrity (and price) of this token depends in large part on the security of the underlying platform. The major staking pool platforms, such as Lido, are solid choices in this regard, though smaller platforms generally also have good security. Besides Lido, some other liquid staking providers include: Marinade Finance\n\nSocean\n\nParrot Pros Liquid staking provides the best returns on staked ETH, especially when paired with other strategies such as lending.\n\nAllows for simple staking without needing 32 ETH\n\nSome staking pools require as little as 0.01 ETH to stake. Cons Liquid staking is often a taxable event as you are swapping tokens.\n\nTakes some know-how of the DeFi ecosystem to get the biggest returns with liquid staking.\n\nSome popular staking pool providers only use a handful of validators, thus contributing to the centralization of Ethereum. How to Stake Ethereum Using a Staking Pool It\u2019s best to use staking pools through a trusted third party. The instructions below will walk you through liquid staking your Ethereum with Lido Finance. We will be using the MetaMask wallet in this example which can be downloaded here. Please note: While the price of Lido\u2019s stETH token is normally pegged 1:1 to the price of ETH, market volatility and other extraneous events may sometimes lower stETH\u2019s price when compared to ETH. This means that you may be able to buy stETH for less than ETH and get access to Lido\u2019s yield rewards without having to stake your ETH. Check the current stETH price before staking to make sure you\u2019re getting the best deal. Step 1: Navigate to the Ethereum staking part of Lido\u2019s website and click \u201cStake Ethereum\u201d to get started. Step 2: On the next page, click \u201cConnect Wallet.\u201d Step 3: Select the \u201cMetaMask\u201d option. Step 4: You will then receive a prompt in your wallet that asks you to connect to the Lido website. Click \u201cNext\u201d and then \u201cConnect\u201d on the next screen. Step 5: Your wallet will now be connected to the Lido website. Step 6: Next, enter the amount of ETH that you would like to stake and click the \u201cSubmit\u201d button. Step 7: You will be asked to confirm the transaction in your wallet. Click the blue \u201cConfirm\u201d button in order to initiate the transaction. Step 8: Back on the Lido website, you will see a short waiting screen while the platform confirms your transaction. Step 9: Once the transaction goes through, you will see a new balance of \u201cstETH\u201d in your wallet and in the Lido UI. This is Lido\u2019s liquid token that you have received in exchange for your staked ETH.\n\nBoost Ethereum Staking Rewards With stETH\n\nLiquid tokens can be used to earn additional rewards on top of Ethereum\u2019s staking rewards.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve gotten your stETH tokens by following the above instructions, you can boost your ETH staking rewards by depositing your stETH to Yearn Finance\u2019s Curve stETH vault. This staking method combines the base ETH staking yield with the yield from staking stETH through Curve as well as Yearn\u2019s vault yields.\n\nAn Example\n\nFor example, if you are earning 4% ETH staking APY on Lido through your staked ETH, and then you take your earned stETH tokens and stake them through Yearn\u2019s stETH pool which provides another 4.81% APY, you will be earning a total of 8.81% APY on your ETH after the Lido and Yearn.finance staking.\n\nThese rewards are not paid out in ETH, however. When staking through Lido, you earn ETH staking rewards in Lido\u2019s stETH token. After you take your stETH tokens from Lido and stake them on Yearn.finance, (using the instructions below) your Yearn rewards will be paid out in the Curve stETH token. Both stETH and Curve stETH can be swapped back to ETH at any time using an exchange.\n\nThe below table illustrates our example\u2019s combined APY.\n\nStaking APY Earn Rewards In Staking With Lido 4% stETH tokens Staking With Yearn.finance 4.81% Curve stETH tokens Combined Return 8.81%\n\nStaking stETH Through Yearn.finance Step 1: Navigate to Yearn.finance\u2019s Curve stETH vault and connect your wallet by using the \u201cConnect Wallet\u201d button in the top right corner. Note: You can view the current APY of the Yearn vault under the \u201cAPY\u201d section. Step 2: Under the \u201cFrom Wallet\u201d section on the right, click on the Curve stETH icon and select \u201cstETH\u201d as the currency you are depositing from your wallet. Step 3: Enter the amount of stETH that you would like to deposit and click \u201cApprove\u201d. Confirm the transaction through your wallet. Step 4: Once you have approved the transaction, the \u201cDeposit\u201d button will become available. Click \u201cDeposit\u201d to deposit your stETH and start earning Curve stETH APY. Note on fees: Yearn takes a 2% man agement fee on all vault deposits. They also take a 20% performance fee on all yield earned. The instructions above use a Yearn feature called \u201cZap\u201d which also adds a 0.3% fee to the transaction. Find out more about Yearn fees on their website. Running Your Own ETH Validator [Hard] Network validators are responsible for validating Ethereum transactions and creating Ethereum blocks. Validators are individuals who have at least 32 ETH staked and have the equipment necessary to perform their duties. Getting started as a network validator certainly takes some technical savvy. While not every validator has to have a massive computing rig at their home, and some can use off-site machines in data centers, validators must still be prepared to handle issues that arise and must understand the intricacies of the Ethereum blockchain. After staking the 32 ETH necessary to become a validator and getting set up, you can expect to earn the full non-diluted staking APY on your ETH (around 5%). What You Need to Run Your Own Network Validator First and foremost, network validators need to have a balance of 32 ETH in order to begin the process. In terms of direct necessities, a physical computer with a 24/7 connection to the internet is required. Software in the form of an execution layer client and a consensus layer client, as well as validator-specific Ethereum keys, will also be necessary. Hardware Requirements The hardware requirements to run a network validator node are not nearly as demanding as those for proof-of-work mining. Most of today\u2019s consumer-grade machines are powerful enough for the task. Please note that you will need a machine with an SSD and cannot use an HDD for validating. It is also strongly recommended that a 64-bit Linux system is used with a cable internet connection (not WiFi). Minimum System Requirements Recommended System Requirements Operating System 64-bit Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, Arm64 64-bit Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, Arm64 Processor Intel Core i5\u2013760 or AMD FX-8100 or better Intel Core i7\u20134770 or AMD FX-8310 or better RAM 4GB RAM 8GB RAM Storage 20GB available space SSD (you cannot use a hard disk drive) 100GB available space SSD (you cannot use a hard disk drive) Internet Broadband connection Broadband connection through ethernet cable Find out more about these requirements from the Ethereum.org website. Cloud Providers It\u2019s not necessary to use a personal machine in order to run a validator node. In fact, many validators opt for using a cloud service that allots them space on a remote machine which they can use to run their node. Here are some of the most popular cloud providers: Allnodes : As one of the biggest cloud hosting providers, Allnodes hosts over 33,000 nodes with an aggregate value of over $1.5 billion dollars. Getting started on Allnodes is simple and the service starts at just $5/month.\n\nBlox : Blox staking takes pride in their fully non-custodial solution which allows users to retain full control of their private validator keys. What\u2019s more is that signing up for the service and getting started is currently free.\n\nBlockdaemon : A favorite cloud provider for institutional stakers. Blockdaemon supports over 60 blockchains and counts some of the largest crypto players among its clients. Their cloud node is touted as a \u201cWhite Label Validator\u201d service and can be accessed here.\n\nPros And Cons Of Running An Ethereum Pros Get the best staking rewards available, with no middleman.\n\nParticipate directly in operating the Ethereum chain.\n\nNo reliance on third-party platforms, so your staked funds are not exposed to potential hacks or site downtime. Cons ETH cannot be unstaked until a future upgrade of the Ethereum network.\n\nRequires technical know-how.\n\nMistakes made in the process may reduce your rewards or even get you ejected from the network\n\nHow to Stake Ethereum With Your Own Network Validator Step 1: Acquire 32 ETH + the necessary hardware and software for becoming a validator. (More info) Step 2: Generate your validator keys and deposit your 32 ETH. (More info) Step 3: Practice on a testnet, complete the validator checklist and wait to get activated. (More info) The Merge And Ethereum Staking Ethereum has traditionally been a blockchain secured through the proof-of-work mechanism. On September 15th, 2022, however, the network seamlessly transitioned over to a proof-of-stake mechanism by merging the main Ethereum chain with the Beacon chain \u2014 which had itself been running through a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism since 2020. The price of ETH did not experience major moves in response to The Merge, and the network experienced no downtime or disturbances. Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake mechanism now allows the blockchain to run at full capacity with a much smaller environmental impact, significantly lower transaction fees, and a higher throughput of transactions per second. The Merge, however, is not the last planned Ethereum upgrade. Over the coming months and years, the network is slated to undergo a series of changes that make Ethereum a much cheaper and faster blockchain. Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has lyrically labeled the planned updates as the surge, the verge, the purge, and the splurge. The Surge : This planned upgrade is the addition of sharding which will allow Ethereum to process over 100,000 transactions per second. The Surge is expected to be deployed to the Ethereum network at some point in 2023.\n\nThe Verge : This upgrade will reduce the amount of data that network validators are required to keep on their hard drives when helping to run the protocol, thereby making the validating process more efficient.\n\nThe Purge : The Purge is meant to reduce the hard drive space that storing ETH takes up, as well as not requiring nodes to store history \u2014 thereby increasing the efficiency of the network.\n\nThe Splurge : According to Vitalik, the Splurge is a catch-all term for \u201call of the other [upcoming] fun stuff.\u201d\n\n\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nEthereum staking provides holders with the opportunity to validate the Ethereum network while simultaneously earning Ethereum straking rewards (paid in ETH).\n\nIt\u2019s also important to choose wisely when deciding where to stake ETH. While the network requires a 32 ETH balance to directly stake, service providers such as staking pools and centralized exchanges allow staking with much smaller balances.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow Much ETH Do You Need To Stake? Normally, it\u2019s 32 ETH. However, this only applies to validators directly staking to the Ethereum blockchain. Service providers such as staking pools and centralized exchanges act as middlemen between validators and ETH holders and allow staking with a much lower ETH stake. Can You Compound Your ETH Staking? Ethereum staking rewards automatically compound in most cases, giving you an annual percentage yield (APY) higher than the annual percentage rate (APR) for your ETH stake. Many ETH staking platforms compound ETH staking rewards every few days. Using liquid staking, ETH stakers can earn both ETH staking rewards and additional yield through activities like lending and liquidity mining. Are ETH Staking Pools Profitable? Non-liquid staking pools generally provide staking rewards close to the official Ethereum staking APY (normally around 4%) Liquid staking pools also provide these staking rewards, but they issue a liquid token that can be leveraged to earn even more. What Is ETH Staking Yield? Since validators with staked ETH are necessary to keep the Ethereum blockchain running, they are compensated by the chain for having their ETH staked. This reward is referred to as \u201cstaking yield\u201d and is currently around 5% annual percentage yield (APY). What Are The Best ETH Staking Validators? The best staking validators often have a long history of validating the Ethereum blockchain with few or no failed blocks, as well as 24/7 uptime and low commissions. What Are The Best ETH Staking Pools? Our pick for the best Ethereum staking pool is Lido.\n\nContributor George Hristov George is a tech writer interested in web3 startups and communities.

        "content": "As one of the largest blockchain ecosystems continues to grow, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin notes that it will be necessary to adopt the \u201cthree transitions\u201d for Ethereum to be sustainable in the long term.\n\nThese transitions, as Buterin explains in his latest blog post are: layer-2 scaling, wallet security and privacy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just features of the protocol that need to improve; in some cases, the way that we interact with Ethereum needs to change pretty fundamentally, requiring deep changes from applications and wallets,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\nButerin explains that it will be necessary to build cross-chain solutions of layer-2 blockchains, drawing on examples of how it is difficult now for users to have only one address with the multiple different scaling solutions that exist on top of Ethereum today.\n\n\u201cIn an L2 scaling world, users are going to exist on lots of L2s. Are you a member of ExampleDAO, which lives on Optimism? Then you have an account on Optimism! Are you holding a CDP in a stablecoin system on ZkSync? Then you have an account on ZkSync\u2026 The days of a user having only one address will be gone,\u201d he said.\n\nThis must be achieved at the same time as the further development of smart contract wallets and privacy.\n\nBlockchain solutions are beginning to look more alike\n\nThese three transitions are not completely new to the blockchain ecosystem at large, and definitely not unique to Etheruem.\n\nCross-chain solutions that can help different networks communicate with one another, for example, has been explored in depth by the Cosmos ecosystem \u2014 a network of individual layer-1 app chains.\n\nIn an interview with Blockworks, Dougie DeLuca, an investor at Figment Capital, noted that rollup ecosystems are beginning to resemble Cosmos in a lot of ways.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s conversations right now about how blockchain design is just going to be commoditized, and they\u2019re going to look kind of similar. This is honestly the earliest sign of this that I\u2019ve seen, where the Cosmos has proliferated the idea of app chains. And rollups right now are moving more and more towards app specific rollups, which is similar to an app chain,\u201d DeLuca said.\n\nCosmos layer-1 blockchains, for example, communicate with each other through an inter-blockchain communication protocol (IBC). A more Ethereum-native solution to resolving the interoperability between layer-2s would be Connext, a team building out chain abstraction.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nSimilarly, with smart contract wallets, Etheruem is designing account abstraction solutions that will enable users to have self custody over their own wallets. In Cosmos, this is currently being explored by Authz.\n\nAlthough fundamentally different, the end goal is similar.\n\n\u201cI think it would be great for the Cosmos and rollup teams to work closely together\u2026Ethereum has been focusing on one set of problems for a long time, and Cosmos another set. If we combine our knowledge, I think we actually have a pretty great solution that we can work towards,\u201d DeLuca said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "What Is Ethereum Triple Halving? How ETH Became Deflationary - CoinCodex",
        "content": "If you\u2019ve been around crypto for a while, you\u2019ve probably heard of the Bitcoin halving, which is a highly anticipated event that happens every four years. But did you know about the Ethereum triple halving?\n\n\u201cEthereum triple halving\u201d is a term used to describe three factors that are providing deflationary pressure to the ETH supply. The term is inspired by the Bitcoin halving, which is a mechanism implemented in the Bitcoin protocol that cuts the issuance of new BTC coins by half roughly every four years.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll explain the Ethereum triple halving and how it can effect the prospects of ETH as a long-term investment.\n\nBefore we continue, we should make it clear that the name \u201cEthereum triple halving\u201d is a bit deceiving\u2014we\u2019ll explain why in the next section of the article. Regardless, the name has been adopted by the crypto community, and the concept it describes is very important if you\u2019re considering investing in ETH.\n\nWhat is the Ethereum triple halving?\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that unlike the Bitcoin halving, the Ethereum triple halving is not an actual event built into the Ethereum protocol. Instead, it\u2019s a term that the Ethereum community came up with to describe how new mechanisms implemented in the Ethereum protocol are helping reduce the supply of ETH.\n\nThe concept of the Ethereum triple halving consists of three main parts:\n\nReduced ETH issuance under Proof-of-Stake consensus\n\nETH burning via the EIP-1559 upgrade\n\nEthereum staking lowers the amount of ETH that is effectively in circulation\n\nNow, let\u2019s explore how each of these factors is impacting the ETH supply and how they could help Ethereum recover from the crypto bear market.\n\nThe migration to Proof-of-Stake has led to reduced ETH issuance\n\nEthereum\u2019s migration from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake has had a very significant impact on the ETH supply. The reason for this is quite simple\u2014the Ethereum blockchain has to issue much fewer ETH to reward stakers than the amount of ETH it had to issue to reward miners.\n\nCryptocurrency mining is an energy-intensive process that requires a significant upfront investment in mining hardware. Meanwhile, staking requires much less energy and is cheaper to get started with. Therefore, the network needs to issue a smaller amount of ETH to reward stakers adequately compared to the amount of ETH it had to issue to incentivize miners.\n\nMore specifically, the Ethereum protocol was issuing around 13,000 ETH per day to reward miners under the Proof-of-Work model. Under the new Proof-of-Stake model, the Ethereum protocol only has to issue about 1,600 ETH per day to reward stakers. This is a reduction of about 87.7%.\n\nAccording to ETH supply tracker ultrasound.money, the Ethereum supply has decreased by 281,627 ETH from September 15, 2022 to June 9, 2023. According to the aggregator\u2019s estimates, the supply would have instead increased by 2.8 million ETH in the same time period if Ethereum still used Proof-of-Work.\n\nIn the following chart, you can see how the supply of ETH has changed since the transition to Proof-of-Stake (September 15, 2022). For comparison, the chart also includes the change in Bitcoin\u2019s supply and the change in ETH supply if it still used Proof-of-Work (simulated).\n\nAs we can see, ETH has been slightly deflationary since the transition over to the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. If this trend continues, it favors long-term ETH holders since ETH will become increasingly scarce, providing positive pressure to the coin\u2019s price.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s no guarantee that the ETH supply will continue to be deflationary forever, as we\u2019ll explain in the following section.\n\nEIP-1559 and transaction fee burning\n\nSo, we learned that the ETH issuance rate has dropped to about 1,600 ETH per day since the Merge. But if 1,600 new ETH is being created every day, how has the supply of ETH decreased?\n\nThe answer lies in the EIP-1559 upgrade, which was activated through the London hard fork in August 2021. The upgrade reworked Ethereum\u2019s transaction fee structure with a mechanism in which the base ETH gas fee paid for transactions is burned. It also gave Ethereum users the option to add a \u201ctip\u201d for validators to have their transaction prioritized.\n\nComparing the Ethereum transaction fee mechanisms before and after EIP-1559. Image source: ConsenSys\n\nEIP-1559 is the reason why the ETH supply has decreased despite new ETH coins being created every day to reward validators. The amount of ETH that\u2019s being burned of course depends on how much ETH users are paying for transactions on the Ethereum network. So, when demand for transactions on Ethereum grows, more ETH is burned.\n\nSo far, the amount of ETH burned through EIP-1559 has outpaced the amount of ETH that\u2019s being issued, resulting in a slight reduction in the ETH supply. If demand for transactions for Ethereum drops in the future, however, we could see ETH becoming inflationary again.\n\nETH staking\n\nETH staking is the third factor included in the Ethereum triple halving concept. Following the move to Proof-of-Stake, ETH holders can stake their coins to help secure the Ethereum network and earn staking rewards in exchange.\n\nEssentially, staking Ethereum provides another incentive to passively hold ETH and lock it up in staking, which temporarily removes it from circulation (staked coins cannot be sold without being unstaked first).\n\nThis part of the Ethereum triple halving has become a bit less relevant recently. This is because the Shapella upgrade, which was enabled on April 12, 2023, introduced the ability to withdraw staked ETH coins. Between the introduction of Ethereum staking in December 2020 and the Shanghai upgrade, staked ETH could not be withdrawn, so they were truly removed from circulation.\n\nStill, the ability to withdraw ETH hasn't actually translated to a flood of ETH withdrawals \u2014 it appears that most ETH stakers are happy to stake their coins and passively earn yield on their holdings.\n\nIn fact, we can see a sharp uptick in the amount of staked ETH after the Shanghai upgrade went live on April 12, 2023. This means that overall, the upgrade increased confidence in Ethereum's staking system and made a larger number of investors willing to stake their coins. At the time of writing, there's a total of 22.7 million staked ETH.\n\nTotal amount of staked ETH (emphasis added). Image source: Dune Analytics / @hildobby\n\nNow that ETH holders have the option of withdrawing their staked coins, staked ETH can no longer be counted as removed from circulation. Still, the ability to stake ETH is an incentive against selling, so one could still argue that ETH staking is a positive influence on ETH as a long-term investment.\n\nWhen is the Ethereum triple halving happening?\n\nUnlike the Bitcoin halving, the Ethereum triple halving is not an actual event, so it doesn\u2019t have a date. All the mechanisms described by the term Ethereum triple halving have already been implemented, so we can say that the Ethereum triple halving has already happened and will continue to be in effect so long as the Ethereum protocol is changed in a relevant way.\n\nThe ETH triple halving has already turned the ETH supply deflationary, although there\u2019s no guarantee that it will remain this way. Due to the burn mechanics introduced in EIP-1559, the fluctuations in the ETH supply are determined by the demand for transactions on the Ethereum network. If ETH continues to be deflationary, the Ethereum triple halving could positively impact the long-term Ethereum price prediction.\n\nThe bottom line \u2014 The Ethereum triple halving has made ETH a better long-term investment\n\nThe Ethereum triple halving\u2019s impact on the ETH supply has made ETH a more attractive asset to hold over the long term, as it significantly reduced the amount of new ETH coins that are entering circulation. In fact, ETH has even turned slightly deflationary after the last part of the Ethereum triple halving, the transition to Proof-of-Stake, was implemented in September 2022.\n\nOf course, the Ethereum triple halving is only one of the factors to consider when evaluating Ethereum as an investment. It\u2019s also important to keep up with developments on the Ethereum scalability front, which will ultimately determine whether Ethereum will be able to gain truly widespread adoption."

        "title": "'Ethereum Fails' Without These 3 Changes, Says Vitalik Buterin - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIf Ethereum is to expand how it's used, it will need to undergo three major transitions or risk undermining its own future, said Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nIn a blog post published on Friday, Buterin laid out his ideas for what it will take to help Ethereum mature if it is to expand in use. Calling them \u201cThe Three Transitions,\u201d Buterin said they would need to evolve around transitions in layer-2, or \u201cL2,\u201d scaling solutions, a move to smart contract wallets, and greater privacy for fund transfers.\n\nButerin\u2019s proposals bump into what has been called the \"blockchain trilemma.\" A blockchain's most important traits are being decentralized, secure, and scalable, but it can only usually achieve two of these three.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo overcome this, Buterin said that it is acknowledged that these transitions would be challenging to coordinate, but said they were needed for Ethereum to survive.\n\nOf the three, Buterin singled out a need to expand use of L2 solutions called \u201crollups\u201d as an important part of this transition. An ordinary L2 function processes transactions off of the main Ethereum blockchain, or the L1.\n\nA rollup is a scaling solution that bundles these transactions and then validates a proof of them as a much smaller piece of data on the mainnet to keep it from getting too clogged. As a result, the cost of an Ethereum transaction can be lower.\n\n\"Layer 2s are critical to the success of Ethereum\u2019s vision of the world computer. Without L2s, Ethereum won\u2019t scale,\" CEO of OP Labs and co-founder of Ethereum scaler Optimism Karl Floersch told Decrypt. \"Without scale, Ethereum will never be able to support the world\u2019s compute demand, and until the world\u2019s compute is fully supported, we can\u2019t fully realize Ethereum\u2019s vision.\"\n\nCritically, said Buterin, the version of Ethereum that does not address the move to rollups \"fails,\" adding that transaction costs would only surge in the face of a bull run and encourage more centralization on its blockchain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"The solution isn't simply 'move users off of mainnet.' Rather, the solution lies in extending the capabilities of the Ethereum network,\" Floersch said. \"This means that instead of thinking about it as a migration from mainnet, we can think about it as load balancing the demand for Ethereum mainnet with other highly secure OP chains.\"\n\nBringing Ethereum from the edge\n\nEli Ben-Sasson, co-founder of the Israeli-based company StarkWare behind layer-2 scaling solutions StarkEx and StarkNet, said Buterin was \u201cright\u201d in his diagnosis of what it would take to see an expanded Ethereum.\n\nHe said his company was already using the smart contract wallets as part of its StarkNet, and believes more of this type of scaling is \u201cover the horizon.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving the leadership from Vitalik which both appreciates the excitement of this moment and urges the community to get on board is a big part of what will propel Ethereum\u2019s success,\u201d Ben-Sasson told Decrypt.\n\nButerin said the move to smart contract wallets has some \"technical issues\" to work through but is \"not a large burden\" to address.\n\nWith a smart contract, contracts automatically execute their terms when predefined conditions are met, and Buterin said they would make some processes easier like covering transactions for non-ETH tokens.\n\nOf the three transitions, Buterin expressed concern that meeting privacy concerns would be among the bigger challenges. He said that without enough data privacy measures in place, users concerned about this will stay away from Ethereum.\n\n\u201cWithout [privacy], Ethereum fails because having all transactions available publicly for literally anyone to see is far too high a privacy sacrifice for many users,\" said Buterin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo address this, Buterin suggested using \"stealth address\" to help protect user identities, but these methods are still maturing because of issues around cost and functionality."

        "content": "Ethereum developer proposed final changes to add to the Cancun upgrade.\n\nETH\u2019s price soared alongside its velocity.\n\nThe new Cancun update that is supposed to be launching on Ethereum [ETH] has been a huge subject of discussion for developers over the last few months. Recently, in the \u201cAll Core Developers Consensus Call\u201d, many details of the update were finalized.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nDevelopers come to an agreement\n\nThe main topic of discussion was about blobs. Blobs are chunks of data that can be added to the Ethereum blockchain. An Ethereum developer named Dankrad Feist conducted an experiment to test how well the Ethereum network can handle large blocks with additional data.\n\nFeist found that the Ethereum network successfully processed blocks with 128 kB to 1 MB of extra data without causing any problems. He tested factors like bandwidth usage, block speed, and missed attestations. Everything remained stable regardless of block size.\n\nHowever, there was one instance where a block carrying 1 MB of additional data caused a temporary reorganization of the blockchain.\n\nBased on the experiment, Feist suggested making some changes. He recommended increasing the maximum number of blobs per block from 4 to 6, as specified in EIP 4844. He also suggested reevaluating the deadline for receiving blocks within a certain time frame.\n\nNext, the participants discussed making modifications to EIP-4788. This EIP allows the Beacon block root to be visible in the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). The suggestion was to restrict the quantity of block roots stored on the EL (Execution Layer) to control the growth of the blockchain\u2019s state.\n\nThough implementing this change would require EL clients to perform additional disk writes, everyone in the discussion agreed that it was a necessary adjustment.\n\nThe team made plans to launch a new testnet called Holesky, which will serve as an alternative platform for implementing changes to the beacon chain. The main goal of Holesky is to run a larger number of validators compared to the mainnet. This will enable them to perform stress tests and evaluate any modifications related to the Beacon chain.\n\nState of ETH\n\nThese developments could have a positive impact on the price of ETH in the future. At press time, ETH was trading at $1,845.16 according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nIts price grew over the last few days, along with its velocity. This indicated that the number of ETH transfers were increasing. However, the MVRV ratio for ETH grew in tandem with its price. The growing MVRV ratio implied that ETH was slightly in the overbought zone at the time of writing."

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Ethereum? ETH Price Prediction Following SEC Crackdown - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "DISCLAIMER: This article is a SPONSORED Press Release and does not constitute Finbold's editorial content nor undergo monitoring. Crypto assets/products involve significant risks. Do not invest unless you are prepared to lose your entire investment. For a full disclaimer, please click here.\n\nEthereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is up 54% over the first six months of the year. However, the price of ETH has stagnated in recent weeks, leading many traders to wonder whether it\u2019s too late to buy Ethereum.\n\nWe\u2019ll take a closer look at Ethereum\u2019s price potential for the remainder of 2023 and highlight two emerging coins that traders are buzzing about this week.\n\nEthereum started off 2023 hot, gaining more than 30% in the first two weeks of the year. While the speed of its ascent slowed down, the token has been extremely successful over the past several months.\n\nThat\u2019s thanks in part to a major catalyst for Ethereum: the blockchain\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake in September and its successful Shanghai upgrade, which unlocked staked ETH, in April.\n\nThese two upgrades not only demonstrated the ability of Ethereum to make huge, impactful changes to its network. They also had practical impacts for investors, turning Ethereum into a yield-generating blockchain with liquid staking potential.\n\nEthereum hit a 2023 high of $2,140 immediately after the Shanghai upgrade, but the price response to this massive news was surprisingly muted. Many traders speculated that the upgrade was already priced in\u2014and the typical crypto response to \u2018sell the news\u2019 likely played a role.\n\nSince April, the ETH price has been stagnant. For the most part, the token has traded sideways between $1,750 and $1,950.\n\nThe good news for Ethereum investors is that this sideways price action likely represents consolidation after the token\u2019s run-up in the first half of the year. Trading volume remains high and Ethereum\u2019s fundamentals are solid following its staking implementation.\n\nThe real test for Ethereum will be whether it can break above resistance at $2,020 later this month or in July. ETH briefly broke this level in April, but failed to maintain a breakout.\n\nIt could take several more retests of the $2,020 resistance before ETH successfully breaks out. However, it appears inevitable from both technical and fundamental perspectives.\n\nWhen the breakout happens, Ethereum could rise quickly to $2,650\u2014the token\u2019s next area of technical resistance. That represents a 43% gain from today\u2019s price.\n\nCrypto Market Resilient in Face of SEC Lawsuits\n\nEthereum is arguably one of the strongest coins in the crypto market right now thanks to its successful upgrades and its centrality to the crypto ecosystem. In contrast, Bitcoin has been trending sideways and down, with some analysts predicting a breakdown to the $20,000 price level.\n\nStill, crypto bulls have reason to be excited right now. In the face of major lawsuits by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Binance and Coinbase, the crypto market hardly blinked. Bitcoin dropped 5%, then regained that amount and more within 48 hours.\n\nThis resilience suggests that crypto investors aren\u2019t plagued by the same fear that haunted the market in 2022. Traders and investors are far more bullish and are willing to be aggressive in looking for the next big opportunity.\n\nFor many traders, the biggest opportunities aren\u2019t in crypto majors like ETH or BTC. Instead, they think potentially huge profits can be found in emerging tokens like Wall Street Memes ($WSM) and yPredict ($YPRED).\n\nWall Street Memes Raises $5.5 Million to Mock Wall Street, Best Meme Coin for 2023\n\nWall Street Memes is a new meme coin that\u2019s generated a lot of excitement among traders and investors. Just two weeks after launching its presale, the project has already raised $5.5 million.\n\nWall Street Memes taps into an anti-Wall Street ethos that\u2019s always been prominent within the crypto community, and is especially strong in the wake of the SEC\u2019s campaign against the crypto industry. The project has many supporters from the r/WallStreetBets community, which has a combined 400,000 social media followers.\n\nThe team behind Wall Street Memes also has experience making a mockery of Wall Street. The same developers were behind the Wall Street Bulls NFT collection, which sold out in just over 30 minutes when it launched in 2021.\n\nThe Wall Street Memes presale is making 50% of the total $WSM supply available to the public. Anyone can join and the project is fully community-driven\u2014the developers haven\u2019t set aside any $WSM for themselves.\n\nDuring the current presale stage, investors can buy $WSM for $0.028, a 25% discount to the list price. Early investors can also join the Wall Street Memes airdrop, which is giving away $10,000 worth of $WSM to each of five lucky investors.\n\nVisit Wall Street Memes Presale\n\nTop AI Coin yPredict Raises $2.2 Million for AI-powered Predictive Models\n\nyPredict is another emerging project that has crypto traders buzzing. It\u2019s raised more than $2,2 million for its $YPRED token and has more than 20,000 on its waitlist ahead of its launch.\n\nyPredict is leveraging AI to build predictive models that can forecast the price of any crypto asset. With yPredict models, for example, traders can quickly see whether Ethereum will go up or down and by how much.\n\nThe project is releasing its AI price modeling tools to the community, enabling quants and developers to build their own custom models. Then traders and analysts can subscribe to their favorite models in the yPredict marketplace.\n\nThis approach is good for everyone. Quants and developers can earn passive income by selling subscriptions to their models. Traders and analysts can combine multiple models and take different approaches to analyzing cryptos. All transactions in the marketplace will require yPredict\u2019s native token, $YPRED.\n\nIn addition, yPredict\u2019s treasury gets a cut of each new subscription. Users who stake $YPRED token receive a 10% share of every new subscription on the platform.\n\n$YPRED is on sale now for $0.09, a 25% discount to the $0.12 list price. Traders and investors have to hurry since the next price increase is only a few days away.\n\nVisit yPredict Presale"

        "content": "In a recent blog post, the co-founder of the network Vitalik Buterin says that Ethereum will fail without three vital changes. Specifically, Buterin has introduced what he refers to as \u201cThe Three Transitions\u201d in his recent post. Moreover, he spoke of their importance for blockchain\u2019s continued development.\n\nButerin spoke on the future of the blockchain, and how Ethereum could expand its utilization. However, for that to take place, he has highlighted Layer-2 (LS) scaling, wallet security, and privacy, as important transitions for the network.\n\nSource: Redot.com\n\nButerin Brings Forth Three Transitions for Ethereum\n\nWithin the digital asset industry, there are few names as revered as Ethereum. A blockchain network that has become one of the most popular in the world has clearly established itself as an important piece of the industry\u2019s future. However, its co-founder has recently expressed what could stand in the way of that future.\n\nIn a recent blog post, Vitalik Buterin says Ethereum will fail without three vital changes. Specifically referred to as the \u201cThree Transitions, the post discusses the necessity for the growth of the platform. Moreover, Buterin says they are utterly important \u201cas Ethereum transitions from a young experimental technology, into a mature tech stack,\u201d seeking to grow.\n\nSource: CryptoPotato\n\nOf the three transitions, Buterin first mentions L2 scaling. Buterin writes that \u201cEthereum fails because each transaction costs $3.75,\u201d with it only increasing in the event of a bull run. Moreover, he notes, \u201cEvery product aiming for the mass market inevitably forgets about the chain and adopts centralized workarounds for everything.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Buterin references wallet security. Specifically, stating that \u201cEthereum fails because users are uncomfortable storing their funds,\u201d and will too often utilize centralized exchanges.\n\nFinally, Buterin discussed the privacy transition, discussing the necessity for its development. Buterin remarks that public availability for transitions \u201cis far too high a privacy sacrifice for many users, and everyone moves onto centralized solutions that at least somewhat hide your data.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese three transitions are crucial,\u201d Buterin conclusively states. Adding that, although they are challenging, the network requires \u201cdeep changes from applications and wallets.\u201d Ultimately, calling for the transitions mentioned to \u201cradically reshape the relationship between users and addresses.\u201d"

        "content": "This article compares the cryptocurrencies ETH and BTC, looking at their differences, pros and cons, and if they constitute good investments.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Vs. Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin are the two most widely-used cryptocurrencies globally. They\u2019re programmed differently, e.g., Ethereum uses the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, while Bitcoin uses proof-of-work. This article will help you understand the differences between them.\n\nETH Vs. BTC Chart\n\nETH BTC Creator Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood Satoshi Nakamoto Launch date July 30, 2015 January 3, 2009 Market capitalization $148 billion $317 billion Supply 122 million tokens 19 million tokens Hash Rate None (doesn\u2019t rely on mining) 255MH/s Fees Varying gas fees Varying gas fees Privacy Pseudonymous Pseudonymous Consensus mechanism Proof-of-stake Proof-of-work Block time 10 to 19 seconds 10 minutes Future token issuance Maximum of 18 million new tokens every year Maximum supply of 21 million tokens All-time high $4,811.39 $67,598.09\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency operating on a blockchain. The blockchain is a public ledger that records all transactions on the Bitcoin network. Anyone with a Bitcoin wallet address can send tokens to another address or receive tokens from another address. Bitcoin was conceptualized and created by Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym for a person whose real identity remains unknown. The first block for Bitcoin was created in January 2009, and the first reported real-world financial transaction using Bitcoin took place in May 2010 when a Florida man paid 10,000 BTC for two boxes of pizzas. As of its first reported transaction, one Bitcoin was worth roughly a fourth of a cent. A few years after, millions of people began adopting the token, and demand shot up, driving the price of a single Bitcoin to an all-time high of over $67,000 in 2021. However, the 2022 crypto market crash has seen the price of Bitcoin slump to just over $16,000.\n\nPros And Cons Of Investing In Ethereum\n\nPros Supports global transactions with fast speeds\n\nSupports global transactions with fast speeds Zero network downtime over the past few years\n\nZero network downtime over the past few years Decentralized digital currency Cons Highly volatile\n\nHighly volatile Transaction fees can be high depending on network demand\n\nTransaction fees can be high depending on network demand No maximum supply, so there\u2019s a high risk of inflation\n\nETH Vs. BTC: Similarities And Differences\n\nSimilarities Both tokens have high demand and a very liquid market.\n\nBoth are decentralized tokens operating on a public ledger (blockchain).\n\nBoth tokens have millions of users globally.\n\nBoth use alphanumeric strings as wallet addresses and are tradable on crypto exchanges. Differences ETH uses the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, while BTC uses proof-of-work.\n\nBTC has a maximum supply, while ETH doesn\u2019t.\n\nBTC relies on mining, while ETH doesn\u2019t.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain processes transactions significantly faster than the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nETH Vs. BTC Price\n\nBTC has historically had a much higher market capitalization than Ethereum. Both cryptocurrencies peaked in 2021, a bubbly year for digital assets, but in 2022 have plunged from their all-time highs.\n\nBitcoin Vs. Ethereum Fees\n\nEvery Bitcoin transaction includes a gas fee paid to the miners on the network validating the transaction. Likewise, every Ethereum transaction includes gas fees paid to the network\u2019s validators. These fees are separate from what exchanges and brokerages charge to facilitate transactions.\n\nETH BTC Gas Fee: The minimum number of tokens necessary to execute a transaction, and it varies based on network demand. You can offer additional tips so that validators will prioritize your transaction. Gas Fee: The amount paid to the blockchain to execute a transaction. It varies based on network demand.\n\nBitcoin Vs. Ethereum Privacy\n\nUsing a decentralized exchange, you can purchase Bitcoin or Ethereum without giving up your identity. In contrast, centralized exchanges have know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, so users must provide some form of identity. Yet, even when you use a decentralized exchange, both Ethereum and Bitcoin aren\u2019t fully anonymous, as someone may be able to tie your wallet address to your real-world identity via a platform you transact with.\n\nWhat Is Proof Of Work (POW) Vs. Proof-Of-Stake (POS)? Proof of Work and Proof of Stake are the most popular mechanisms for validating transactions on a blockchain, but they work differently. Proof of Work Proof of Stake Relies on miners whose capacity depends on computational power Relies on stakers whose validating capacity depends on the amount of tokens they stake Miners receive block rewards Stakers receive transaction fees as rewards Requires expensive mining equipment and high energy usage Doesn\u2019t require expensive equipment or high energy usage The proof-of-work mechanism uses a competitive validation method (solving complex mathematical puzzles) to confirm transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain, while proof of stake uses validators selected at random to confirm transactions and add new blocks. Bitcoin operates on the proof-of-work mechanism, while Ethereum operates on the proof-of-stake mechanism.\n\nBTC Vs. ETH Use Cases\n\nYou can use BTC and ETH for different types of transactions or as a store of value.\n\nTop BTC Use Cases\n\nStore of value : You can use BTC as an alternative currency to store your assets.\n\n: You can use BTC as an alternative currency to store your assets.

Dapps: You can use BTC to transact on various decentralized apps, e.g., games and gambling apps.\n\nTop ETH Use Cases\n\nStore of value : You can also use ETH as a store of value and a hedge against inflation from your local currency, but a stablecoin better fits this purpose.\n\n: You can also use ETH as a store of value and a hedge against inflation from your local currency, but a stablecoin better fits this purpose. Staking : You can stake your ETH on the Ethereum blockchain to earn a percentage of transaction fees paid to the network.\n\n: You can stake your ETH on the Ethereum blockchain to earn a percentage of transaction fees paid to the network. NFTs : You can use ETH to buy non-fungible tokens (ETH) on various platforms.\n\n: You can use ETH to buy non-fungible tokens (ETH) on various platforms. Lending: You can lend your ETH to other users and earn interest via a lending protocol.\n\nETH Vs. BTC Long-Term: Which Is A Better Investment?\n\nETH and BTC can be good long-term investments that\u2019ll yield profits. Yet, be sure to perform your own due diligence before investing in any cryptocurrency. This article isn\u2019t investment advice.\n\nA Case For Investing In ETH\n\nETH is one of the most traded cryptocurrencies globally. Anyone getting into the crypto markets as a newbie has likely heard of ETH, so may be compelled to buy it. The Ethereum network offers very fast transaction processing speeds compared to many other cryptocurrencies. It\u2019s volatile but not as volatile as most altcoins. The token\u2019s recent shift from the proof-of-work mechanism to proof of stake has attracted more users and increased its demand.\n\nAs of late 2022, the crypto market is experiencing a widespread rout that has the value of many tokens to plunge, including ETH. If you believe the market is headed for recovery, it\u2019ll be a smart decision to invest in ETH.\n\nPotential Risks\n\nThe token is vulnerable to massive price swings.\n\nTransaction fees can be very high when there\u2019s significant demand on the network.\n\nMany smart contract platforms are emerging to compete with Ethereum, so its appeal might fade.\n\nCrypto wallets and exchanges where you hold ETH are vulnerable to hacking attacks.\n\nA Case For Investing In BTC\n\nBTC is the cryptocurrency with the highest market capitalization. The demand for BTC is enormous across the globe, so there\u2019s always the chance of it increasing in value. Lately, institutional investors have set their sights on the cryptocurrency markets, and BTC is the asset most of them buy. BTC is already huge, yet there\u2019s significant potential for growth in its demand, meaning it could be a good long-term investment.\n\nPotential Risks\n\nBTC is significantly volatile.\n\nBTC is vulnerable to a 51% attack \u2014 a group of miners controlling more than 50% of the network\u2019s mining power can connive to disrupt it.\n\n\u2014 a group of miners controlling more than of the network\u2019s mining power can connive to disrupt it. There\u2019s no central authority to retrieve your BTC if you fall victim to hacking.\n\nGovernments may decide to ban or restrict the use of Bitcoin if it\u2019s affecting their national currencies.\n\nRemember that investing comes with risks. Hence, it\u2019s wise to only invest money that you can forfeit without losing much sleep. Always do your own research before investing, and remember that this article doesn\u2019t constitute investment advice.\n\nBest Cryptocurrency Exchanges To Buy ETH\n\nCoinbase: Best For Ease Of Use\n\nBest For Ease Of Use Binance: Best For Low Fees\n\nBest For Low Fees Uniswap: Best For DeFi Users\n\n1.

        "title": "Ethereum Co-Founder Names Three Key Transitions to Watch as Network Grows - CoinGape",
        "content": "As the Ethereum network continues to grow and evolve, its co-founder has identified three key transitions that are set to shape its future trajectory.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the visionary mind behind the world\u2019s second-largest crypto, recently outlined these transitions in a blog post, highlighting their significance in enhancing scalability, security, and privacy within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOne of the most pressing challenges for Ethereum has been its scalability. As the network gained popularity, the increased demand for transactions caused congestion and high fees, hindering its usability. To address this issue, Buterin points to the transition to Layer 2 scaling solutions as the first transition, specifically rollups.\n\nThe second transition pointed by Buterin is the wallet security transition, specifically smart contract wallets.\n\nBy adopting smart contract wallets, users can have greater confidence in the security of their assets. Without the second transition, Buterin highlighted that Ethereum fails because users are hesitant to save their funds (and non-financial assets), and everyone migrates to centralized exchanges. Buterin believes that social recovery wallets are important for greater security and user experience.\n\nAdditionally, the Ethereum co-founder also stressed the significance of privacy as the third transition. Buterin acknowledges the need for privacy-preserving features within the Ethereum network, specifically focusing on funds transfers and the development of related tools such as social recovery, identity, and reputation systems.\n\nTo enable privacy features for Ethereum users, Buterin suggested implementing stealth address methods.\n\nChallenges Involved with the Transitions\n\nAchieving scalability, security, and privacy improvements on Ethereum requires more than just protocol upgrades, according to Buterin.\n\nAs with any new project, Buterin highlighted some challenges that may be involved in these transitions. He highlighted that the successful implementation of these transitions requires coordination among various stakeholders in the Ethereum community, including developers, miners, users, and application builders.\n\nAccording to the Ethereum co-founder, Transitioning to these new solutions necessitates educating and encouraging users to adopt the changes. This is because users need to understand the importance of these transitions and feel confident in adopting them.\n\nBy recognizing the importance of coordination, facilitating changes in application design, and prioritizing user education and adoption, the Ethereum community can navigate these challenges and ensure the successful resolution of these transitions."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Founder Vitalik Buterin Indicates Third Pillar of Ethereum (ETH) After Rollups and AA - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe evolution of Ethereum (ETH) from experimental niche technology into a mainstream tech stack includes three roadmaps. Should the network fail at one of them, it would be difficult for it to achieve massive adoption in competition with centralized competitors. Vitalik Buterin described these \"building blocks\" of a mature Ethereum (ETH).\n\nScaling transition, security transition, privacy transition: Vitalik Buterin on Ethereum (ETH) maturing\n\nIn order to continue its evolution into a mature tech stack that is able to bring an \"open, global and permissionless experience\" to a new generation of users, Ethereum (ETH) needs to undergo three transitions. The second largest blockchain needs to focus on scalability, security and privacy; the three milestones should be accomplished almost simultaneously, Buterin claimed in his recent article.\n\nIn terms of L2-centric scaling, rollups are the best solution: every dApp should move its operations to a rollup-based network. The wallet security transition will be achieved through \"smart conract wallets\" enabled by the Account Abstraction concept.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, Account Abstraction, or EIP 4337, is a recent update of the Ethereum (ETH) protocol design. It blurs the line between on-chain wallets and smart contracts: every wallet can now become a \"decentralized bank.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the privacy transition is of paramount importance: privacy should be available for all operations - both existing and potential - on Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, Vitalik stresses:\n\n...making sure privacy-preserving funds transfers are available, and making sure all of the other gadgets that are being developed (social recovery, identity, reputation) are privacy-preserving.\n\nVitalik highlighted that we should not view these changes as simple EIPs or even hardforks as they are far more sophisticated. To achieve the mentioned goals, in some aspects, Ethereum's (ETH) design needs to change \"pretty fundamentally.\"\n\n\"You only can choose three out of three\"\n\nAt the same time, all three goals should be addressed simultaneously: we cannot focus on one or two of them. Without a scaling transition, Ethereum (ETH) fees will be too high, and products will be seeking centralized alternatives to moving money on-chain.\n\nWithout advanced wallet security, it would be uncomfortable for users to store Ethers and Ethereum-based tokens in noncustodial wallets so that they would yet again need centralized custody.\n\nRegarding the third roadmap, the situation looks the same for Vitalik: future users of Ethereum (ETH) will not be happy about having all of their activities exposed to third parties with no obfuscation.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, Bitcoiners (BTC) accused Ethereum (ETH) developers of \"lying\" about the scaling potential of their L1 blockchain."

On the expected lines, there was a large flight of crypto assets out of the exchange.\n\nHowever, it was not Bitcoin [BTC] but rather ETH that formed the majority of the withdrawn assets, as per latest data from research firm Nansen.\n\nHistorically, a large wave of withdrawals is seen as reduced sell-off risks and investors\u2019 anticipation of a bullish surge. But in the current scenario, the accumulation could be a result of eroding confidence in centralized entities. Investors could be shifting funds to a safer place.\n\nMeanwhile, data from Santiment showed that the percentage of ETH supply on exchanges dropped to its record low of 9.45% at the time of publication. Simultaneously, the supply held by top non-exchange addresses has shot up over the past month or so, indicating that whales were snapping up ETH in droves.\n\nInvestors still bullish on ETH\n\nThe FUD triggered by U.S. regulators since the start of the week have engulfed ETH as well.

Pros & Cons Pros Easy to use, start earning in seconds\n\nEarning displayed immediately upon login\n\nStart staking with as little as $1 Cons Limited selection of cryptos for staking\n\nLower APYs compared to other exchanges Why We Like Coinbase For Staking In a nutshell, it\u2019s easy. Coinbase offers fewer staking options (just six) compared to many other exchanges. But if you\u2019re a Coinbase user already, you\u2019ll appreciate the way Coinbase displays your earnings in your account dashboard, never leaving you guessing. Staking on Coinbase is as easy as you\u2019d expect, taking just a few newbie-friendly clicks. Options include top cryptos like Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana.\n\nWhat is Liquid Staking?\n\nLiquid staking is a special type of staking. Rather than simply locking up your crypto to earn rewards, you can actually receive a liquid token in return for staking that you can then use in place of your original crypto.\n\nFor example, in traditional staking, you lock up your SOL (Solana) for some period of time in order to earn some annual percentage yield (APY). During this time, your SOL cannot be used for anything else \u2014 if you unstake or move your SOL, you will stop earning interest.\n\nLiquid staking fixes this by issuing you a liquid token any time you stake. When you stake your SOL, for example, you will receive a \u201cliquid\u201d token such as mSOL in return that you can trade and sell just as if you had your original SOL. This allows you to earn even more in rewards using your mSOL by lending it out or using it across DeFi (decentralized finance).\n\nLiquid Staking vs. Staking\n\nWe\u2019ve already covered the basic differences between liquid staking and traditional staking \u2014 namely, liquid staking gives you a new \u201cliquid\u201d token that you do not receive with traditional staking.\n\nWhile traditional staking is supported natively by many blockchains, such as Ethereum and Solana, third-party platforms must be used to facilitate liquid staking. Services such as Lido, Rocket Pool, and others make liquid staking possible by issuing their own liquid tokens in exchange for your staked cryptocurrencies (such as ETH and SOL).\n\nThis means that while normal staking only exposes you to the blockchain itself, liquid staking also exposes you to a third-party platform. If Lido or Rocket Pool were to get hacked or go bankrupt, your liquid staking tokens would also go down with them, so it\u2019s important to be mindful when choosing between these platforms.\n\nWant a full rundown of crypto staking? Check out our full guide.\n\nHelpful Definitions\n\nExplaining liquid staking involves lots of jargon. Check out the dropdown below for some helpful definitions before reading on.\n\nStaking Definitions\n\nLiquid Staking Derivative Token: When you stake a cryptocurrency, such as ETH or SOL, through liquid staking, you will receive a \u201cliquid\u201d token in return. This token will usually have a prefix, such as \u201cstETH\u201d or \u201cmSOL.\u201d It usually represents your underlying staked crypto plus the accrued interest from staking.\n\nWhen you stake a cryptocurrency, such as ETH or SOL, through liquid staking, you will receive a \u201cliquid\u201d token in return.

Validators: In proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains such as Ethereum and Solana, validators are the trusted parties used to run the blockchain.

By staking a certain amount of tokens (such as 32 ETH), validators receive data from the blockchain and verify that all transactions are correct. APY: In return for staking the crypto necessary to run the blockchains (like the 32 ETH), validators will be awarded an \u201cannual percentage yield\u201d (APY). This is a reward that they get on top of their staked ETH for their service of helping to validate the blockchain.\n\nIn return for staking the crypto necessary to run the blockchains (like the 32 ETH), validators will be awarded an \u201cannual percentage yield\u201d (APY). This is a reward that they get on top of their staked ETH for their service of helping to validate the blockchain. Commissions/Fees: Many liquid staking platforms will take a commission or a fee out of the APY paid out to stakers. If a blockchain pays 6% APY to stakers, for example, your liquid staking platform may take 10% of that APY as a fee for providing you with a liquid token.\n\nLiquid Staking Benefits\n\nLiquid staking has many benefits, which make it a preferred option for investors looking to get the most out of their crypto.\n\nLiquidity : As the name implies, liquid staking gives you a liquid token in return for your staked crypto.

Risk Management: Your liquid staking tokens can be used as collateral to take out DeFi loans or to provide you additional yield in interest-bearing accounts. You can put these loans to work for personal use, or you can re-invest the funds.\n\nLiquid Staking Risks\n\nAs with anything in crypto, there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch. Liquid staking comes with its own risks:\n\nPlatform Risk: Your liquid staking tokens will be platform-specific. stETH, for example, is a liquid staking token for ETH that\u2019s specific to the Lido platform. This means that any time you are holding stETH, you are exposed to how Lido performs as a company. If it were to get hacked or go bankrupt, the value of your stETH tokens might be affected.\n\nYour liquid staking tokens will be platform-specific. stETH, for example, is a liquid staking token for ETH that\u2019s specific to the Lido platform.

Limited Support: Liquid staking tokens are generally not as well supported by exchanges as other major cryptocurrencies. For example, you can trade ETH pretty much anywhere and use it for any DeFi application. stETH, meanwhile, is less well-supported, so your options may be more limited.\n\nLiquid staking tokens are generally not as well supported by exchanges as other major cryptocurrencies.

Taxes: In the US, trading your staked crypto for a liquid staking derivative represents a taxable event. This is because the trade is a \u201cswap,\u201d which is considered a sale that has to have capital gains or losses calculated.\n\nWho Should Liquid Stake?\n\nPeople Who Are Intermediate Users: Liquid staking is an advanced concept in crypto that can prove difficult to navigate.

People Who Can\u2019t Afford To Lose Any Crypto: Liquid staking is risky \u2014 you may make a mistake during the many steps required to stake and unstake your crypto, or your liquid staking platform may experience a hack or become insolvent. It\u2019s best done with crypto you can afford to lose and that you plan on holding for a long time.\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nIn summary, liquid staking is an intermediate strategy used by savvy traders to earn yield on their crypto while also retaining a liquid asset. While it can be very profitable, it\u2019s important to note that liquid staking is risky and should be undertaken only after you do proper research.\n\nRemember to never stake money that you can\u2019t afford to lose.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhy Is Liquid Staking Different Than Other Types Of Staking? Liquid staking is different from traditional staking because it provides you with a \u201cliquid\u201d token while your crypto is staked. You can use this liquid token to lend, provide liquidity, and much more across DeFi to boost your yield even more. What Liquid Staking Protocol Is Best? It\u2019s difficult to determine which staking protocol is the best. Lido is the largest staking protocol, while Rocket Pool is known for its vibrant community. Additionally, Coinbase Prime and ANKR are good choices for institutional stakers. What Are Liquid Staking Derivatives? Liquid staking derivatives are simply the liquid tokens that represent your staked crypto. For example, when staking ETH through Lido, your \u201cliquid staking derivative\u201d token will be \u201cstETH.\u201d What\u2019s The Difference Between Liquid Staking And Liquidity Pools? While similar in name, liquid staking, and liquidity pools are two very different concepts. Liquid staking is when you receive a liquid token in return for staking your crypto. Liquidity pools, on the other hand, are when you provide \u201cliquidity\u201d to a pair of tokens that other traders can use to trade. For example, you can supply ETH liquidity into a USDC/ETH pool which will provide the ETH that traders need to buy when they are selling USDC. What Are The Advantages Of Liquid Staking Tokens? Liquid staking tokens allow you to have access to your staked crypto without any lockups. Normally, you can\u2019t use your staked tokens for anything until you un-stake them. With liquid staking, you can use your liquid tokens to lend, provide liquidity, or as collateral when taking out loans.\n\nContributor George Hristov George is a tech writer interested in web3 startups and communities.

        "content": "The crypto market crashed on Saturday, with the global market cap dropping 6% to $1.04 trillion in the past 24 hours. The total liquidation comes in at $400 million over the last 24hrs as over 190,000 traders were liquidated. The largest single liquidation happened on the crypto exchange OKX, with ETH-USD-SWAP valued at $2.18 million.\n\nBitcoin price tumbles 4%, with major downfall coming within just 2 hours. BTC price fell to a 24-hour low of $25,500. Bitcoin currently trades near $25600, with a high probability of falling below the $25k level.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum price fell 6%, with the 24-hour low and high of $1765 and $1854. ETH price currently trades below $1750. The selling pressure continues to mount with increasing trading volumes.\n\nAltcoins such as Filecoin, Polygon, Cardano, Solana, Chiliz, Sandbox, Decentraland, Axie Infinity, and others fell more than 25%. Shiba Inu (SHIB) lead the crypto market crash, falling 30% in the last 24 hours. Some buying from the dip is also recorded.\n\nAlso Read: Binance To Temporarily Suspend All Crypto Margin And Earn Related Services\n\nReasons Behind the Crypto Market Crash\n\nMajor liquidations were recorded in the cryptocurrencies mentioned in the US SEC lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance. However, the massive liquidation came in response to Binance.US stopping USD fiat support on the exchange and Robinhood delisting Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC).\n\nUS SEC mentioned BNB, BUSD, SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, ATOM, SAND, MANA, ALGO, AXS, and COTI as securities in the Binance lawsuit. The agency listed SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, SAND, AXS, CHZ, FLOW, ICP, NEAR, VGX, DASH, and NEXO as securities in the Coinbase lawsuit.\n\nAccording to Coinglass, over $300 million in longs and $30 million in shorts were liquidated in the last 24 hours. The liquidations majorly happened on Binance, OKX, and Bybit, with BTC ($50M), ETH ($46M), ADA ($17M), SOL ($16M), LTC ($12M), DOGE ($11M), BNB (10M), FIL ($10M), and MATIC ($9M).\n\nGrayscale Investments has also filed a request with the US SEC seeking withdrawal of the Trust\u2019s Registration Statement on Form 10 for Grayscale Filecoin Trust. The SEC staff continues to view Filecoin (FIL) as security. However, Grayscale says it will continue to believe that FIL is not a security.\n\nMarket makers such as Jump Crypto and Cumberland have pulled all the liquidity from altcoins. Market makers were caught dumping major crypto to exchanges Binance and Coinbase. Binance.US partners are reluctant to work with the exchange, causing a major selloff across the market.\n\nMoreover, over 4 trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens worth millions were moved from Shiba Staking to crypto exchange Binance. It triggered a selloff in SHIB and BONE prices.\n\nScimitar Capital, the hedge fund rumored to be behind the massive $2 billion altcoin liquidation, said:\n\n\u201cOur fund has made the strategic decision to liquidate our crypto holdings and return the capital to our esteemed LPs.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSome detractors of NFTs fixate on their ethereal, intangible nature. How can they be art, critics cry, if they're only digital, virtual, disconnected from reality?\n\nIt would be difficult to levy those claims against the works of Foodmasku.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s the moniker of Antonius Wiriadjaja, the multimedia performance artist who\u2014for three years now\u2014has created NFTs depicting himself wearing masks made entirely of food, and then eating the masks. The ultimate consumption of the work is a rule, a key component.\n\nCourtesy: Foodmasku\n\nThe association between masks and food\u2014and between food masks and the blockchain for that matter\u2014is not necessarily intuitive. That may be because, for Wiriadjaja, those connections were the product of organic necessity.\n\nIn the earliest months of the pandemic, the artist recalls, he and a group of remote colleagues were navigating the still-bizarre realm of Zoom encounters. One fateful day, one of his friends became inadvertently trapped in a video filter that apparently turned their face into a pickle. The caller was embarrassed. Wiriadjaja\u2019s first impulse was to make them feel better.\n\n\u201cSo I took [a part of] my dinner, which was a piece of kale, put it on my face and said 'Hey, I have a filter on as well,\u2019\u201d Wiriadjaja told Decrypt at NFC Lisbon earlier this week.\n\nThe pickled participant was delighted, their shame washed away, and they asked Wiriadjaja what he was going to wear tomorrow. Foodmasku was born.\n\nCourtesy: Foodmasku\n\nIn the following weeks and months, Wiriadjaja dedicated himself to the mission of creating, documenting, and eating food masks. Banana eyes, broccoli nostrils, noodle noses, shrimp eyebrows... every day, a new sumptuous self-portrait.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe project steadily gained steam, but that success was a double-edged sword: people were so enamored with Wiriadjaja\u2019s food masks that phony Foodmasku accounts began popping up across numerous social media platforms.\n\nCourtesy: Foodmasku\n\nThis was March 2021, and Wiriadjaja was frustrated. There had to be a way to own digital files, to protect his edible oeuvre. He did some searching online and came across NFTs. The artist Beeple had just sold an NFT artwork for $69 million, catapulting the emerging technology into the mainstream.\n\nSo Foodmasku became a Web3 artist. Not out of an ideological or artistic commitment to the ethos of decentralization, but instead\u2014as with the inciting kale flap\u2014because it just made sense.\n\nTo date, Wiriadjaja has created almost 2,000 Foodmasku NFTs, generating about 50 ETH, or $92,000, in sales.\n\nCourtesy: Foodmasku\n\nThe artist, who was born in Indonesia and raised in Boston, has faced different reactions to his works across various cultures and contexts. A through-line, he\u2019s found, is that people across the world tend to be afraid of technology.\n\n\u201cTechnology is scary to everyone, everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cIndonesians are worried that technology\u2019s going to kill off their traditional arts, Americans are worried technology\u2019s going to take all of their jobs. But one thing everybody relates to is food.\u201d\n\nIf foods and masks and emergent digital technologies can be brought together to give Wiriadjaja\u2019s colorfully inventive and optimistic portraits a cohesive thesis, it might be that any medium possesses the capacity to tap into the universal vibrancy of humanity.\n\nCourtesy: Foodmasku\n\nIn that vein, Wiriadjaja has recently become fascinated with artificial intelligence. He\u2019s developing a project called \u201cProof of Eat,\u201d which is intended to clear the air on the increasing disquiet prompted by blurring of the line between humans and machines.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOne big test of whether a creator is human or not, is if they can eat food,\u201d he said."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency Ethereum could smash US$2000, as per the Ethereum price analysis.\n\nDue to its growth potential and distinctive qualities, including its smart contract capability and decentralized applications, Ethereum is a promising investment. In addition, a sizable and committed developer community is continually working to enhance the platform and broaden its use cases. Ethereum probably could smash US$2000 this week. On June 5, 2023, the price of Ethereum is US$1,904.93. Ethereum\u2019s price would have to rise by more than 5% to hit US$2000. Although it seems unlikely, this is conceivable.\n\nExperts foresee Ethereum could smash US$2000. Several elements impact Ethereum price analysis, which could lead to an ETH breakthrough above US$2,000 in the future. First, the Ethereum network is undergoing a big update known as Ethereum 2.0, which is anticipated to greatly enhance the network\u2019s scalability and security. Even though this update won\u2019t be finished until 2023, some early adopters are already staking their ETH tokens to support network security. The demand for ETH is anticipated to rise as more of it is staked, which could raise the price.\n\nSecond, the general cryptocurrency market is positive, with recent gains in Bitcoin (BTC) and other significant cryptocurrencies. This optimistic outlook may also apply to ETH, which would support price growth.\n\nAnd last, a breakout in ETH may be aided by the imminent Ethereum Merge. The Ethereum network has undergone a significant upgrade called The Merge, which will alter the way ETH is mined. The proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus method will replace the current proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism used to mine Ethereum (ETH). The Ethereum network is anticipated to become more secure and energy efficient as a result of this change. As a result, the Merge might draw in more investors, which might raise the price of ETH.\n\nHere are several important technical thresholds to look out for: The all-time high for ETH is US$2,000. A significant positive indication would be a breakout above this level. The 200-day moving average for ETH is US$2,100. The upswing would be confirmed, and potential gains may be made if there were a breakout above this level. The 50-day moving average for ETH is US$2,200. The Bulls would be in charge if there was a breakout above this level.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Vitalik Outlines Three Transitions for Ethereum's future - CryptoDaily",
        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nIn a recent blog post, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has unveiled a roadmap consisting of three significant technical transitions that he believes are vital for ensuring the long-term success and sustainability of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThree must-implement transitions\n\nButerin emphasises that these transitions, namely Layer 2 scaling, wallet security enhancement, and privacy measures, are essential in maintaining Ethereum's decentralised nature and for guaranteeing open and unrestricted access for all users.\n\nFailure to implement these transitions, warns Buterin, could potentially undermine Ethereum's viability as a robust and widely adopted platform.\n\nLayer 2 scaling\n\nThe first transition focuses on scaling Layer 2 solutions. Over the past few years, Ethereum has witnessed the emergence of a Layer 2 ecosystem comprising solutions like Optimistic Rollup and Zero Knowledge-Rollup, which have effectively reduced transaction costs. However, as the majority of activities still occur on the main Ethereum network, further maturation and scaling of the Layer 2 space are necessary.\n\nButerin highlights the potential consequences of neglecting Layer 2 scaling, including skyrocketing transaction fees during market expansion phases or bullish market trends. Such circumstances may lead users to seek centralised alternatives, posing a threat to Ethereum's decentralisation goals.\n\n\"The absence of the first transition, Layer 2 scaling, would render Ethereum vulnerable, with each transaction costing $3.75 ($82.48 during a bullish market). This would inevitably drive mass-market products to disregard the Ethereum chain and adopt centralized workarounds,\" Buterin explained.\n\nWallet security\n\nThe second transition highlighted by Buterin centres around wallet security. Buterin expresses concern that potential security risks may discourage users from storing their funds and non-financial assets on the Ethereum network, driving them towards centralised exchanges as a safer alternative.\n\n\"Without the second transition, wallet security, Ethereum's success is compromised as users become hesitant to store their funds securely. This could result in a mass migration towards centralized exchanges,\" warns Buterin.\n\nTo enhance wallet security, Buterin proposes a shift towards smart contract wallets with advanced features such as social recovery, similar to the concept of account abstraction. These enhanced wallets would offer improved security measures and an enhanced user experience.\n\nPrivacy\n\nThe third and final transition emphasised by Buterin is privacy. He cautions that the absence of robust data privacy measures may discourage users from utilising Ethereum's capabilities fully. To address this concern, Buterin suggests the implementation of stealth address protocols, which would provide privacy features for Ethereum users.\n\nBy integrating stealth address protocols, Ethereum would be able to offer enhanced privacy options, attracting users who value anonymity and data protection.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum Success Hinges On Vitalik Buterin's Proposed '3 Transitions' - What Are They? - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Ethereum, the renowned blockchain platform and brainchild of Vitalik Buterin, faces a crucial crossroad on its path to further growth and adoption.\n\nIn a blog post recently shared by the Ethereum co-founder himself, Buterin highlights the imperative need for three pivotal transitions that Ethereum must undergo in order to ensure its prosperous future.\n\nThese transitions, aptly dubbed \u201cThe Three Transitions,\u201d revolve around the realms of Layer-2 scaling solutions, the implementation of smart contract wallets, and the augmentation of privacy in fund transfers.\n\nWithout embracing these transformative changes, Buterin says Ethereum risks hindering its own expansion and jeopardizing its position as a frontrunner in the ever-evolving landscape of decentralized technologies.\n\nLayer-2 Scaling: Addressing Ethereum\u2019s High Gas Fees\n\nOne of the most pressing challenges faced by the Ethereum network is the issue of exorbitant gas prices, according to Buterin. To tackle this problem head-on, Buterin proposes the adoption of Layer-2 rollups, which offer a promising solution.\n\nBy embracing rollups on a large scale, Ethereum can effectively mitigate the persistently high gas fees that have been a significant deterrent for users.\n\nEven in the current crypto winter, widely considered the harshest downturn in the history of cryptocurrencies, gas fees for Ethereum transactions still hover around $3.\n\nButerin emphasizes the unsustainability of this situation, emphasizing that widespread adoption of Layer-2 solutions is the key to resolving the issue.\n\nNeglecting to do so would inevitably lead users to seek out \u201ccentralized workarounds\u201d that offer more affordable alternatives and are easier to navigate.\n\nWallet Security: Enhancing User Experience And Trust\n\nAccording to Buterin, the lack of improved wallet security creates a barrier to users fully embracing the self-custody of their assets, leading them to seek centralized alternatives like exchanges. To overcome this challenge, it is crucial to enhance wallet security measures and provide a user-friendly experience that instills trust.\n\nFurthermore, Buterin highlights the significance of interoperability between wallets and networks. Seamless integration allows for a smoother experience when utilizing cryptocurrencies for day-to-day transactions such as purchasing groceries.\n\nETH market cap currently at $209 billion. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nEthereum Privacy: Overcoming The Transparency Challenge\n\nThe absence of privacy in individual transactions poses a significant hurdle to Ethereum\u2019s goal of becoming the preferred network for everyday users, according to the developer.\n\nThe lack of confidentiality and the public visibility of transactions can deter individuals from embracing cryptocurrencies in their daily lives.\n\nButerin contends that if transactions are easily traceable and linked to users, people would be reluctant to use crypto for everyday activities.\n\nAcknowledging the importance of privacy, he proposes the utilization of stealth addresses as a potential solution. However, he also admits that privacy concerns remain a formidable problem without a readily available remedy.\n\nWhile Buterin recognizes the significance of privacy, finding a comprehensive and practical solution is a complex challenge.\n\nEthereum, like many other blockchain networks, grapples with balancing transparency and security with the need for individual privacy.\n\nResolving this issue requires ongoing research, development, and collaboration to ensure that privacy concerns are adequately addressed within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nFeatured image from Cryptonomist"

        "content": "Stellar Foundation makes a compelling case for Soroban, and why it should be prioritized similarly to platforms such as Ethereum and Solana.\n\nThe Soroban smart contract is attempting to compete with Ethereum as it caters to a wider audience despite being a newbie on the market.\n\nSoroban, according to Stellar\u2019s definition, is a developer-friendly Rust-based smart contracts platform. The smart contract was not only designed for sensibility but also for scalability. The smart contract is already live on a test network known as Futurent. It also integrates with and works alongside the Stellar blockchain network. designed for scale and sensibility.\n\nIn a recent blogpost, Stellar has detailed multiple reasons why the smart contract should hold as much importance as the likes of Ethereum and Solana, despite their popularity and larger adoption levels. When it comes to the best platform for specific use cases, that also supports a specific goal and value, Stellar wants the ecosystem to consider Sobran for a variety of reasons.\n\nAlthough Stellar maintains that Soboran might not be the answer for every smart contract developer or entrepreneur, the foundation is certain that the smart contract is a compelling choice to consider when looking to build a blockchain-based project. The blogpost read.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the obvious tech differences. Ethereum uses the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) runtime environment, and contracts are built using the Solidity programming language (for the most part, you can also use Vyper or Yul), while Soroban uses the WebAssembly (WASM) runtime environment and supports contracts written in a broader range of languages such as Rust, C, C++, Go, AssemblyScript, and more.\n\nSoroban seeks to disrupt the real-world and fintech finance ecosystem\n\nAdditionally, it was revealed that its mission since conception, has been centered around bringing financial access to everyone across the globe. This inclusive approach is one that Soroban also follows. While EVM was created mainly for the Ethereum blockchain, WASM was created for broader interoperability. This makes it possible for WASM to be utilized in many different environments like web browsers, server-side applications, and other blockchain platforms. The blog spot further added.\n\nThe same interoperability distinction can be applied to Solidity versus Rust. Solidity was explicitly designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, while Rust is a general-purpose programming language that, while great for smart contract development, can also be used for web development, systems programming, and more.\n\nAsides from being an inclusive technology, the Soroban smart contract also serves the greenfield ecosystem and the real-world tech ecosystem.\n\nEthereum currently boasts a large number of assets on the network, along with many fiat-backed stablecoins. It is however worth noting that the stablecoins on the network are backed by popular fiat currencies and CBDCs. Stellar on the other hand is more focused on worldwide reach with a more expansive range of fiat-backed stablecoins such as Circle\u2019s USDC and Euro Tempo (EURT) issued by Tempo.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "content": "Shytoshi Kusama, a Shiba Inu lead Developer, recently took to his verified Twitter account to make a joke about the Woofpaper v2, comparing and contrasting its details with Buterin\u2019s article, an article released initially by the Ethereum (ETH) founder, Vitalik Buterin.\n\nNotably, Buterin\u2019s article contained three proposed solutions to some of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain problems.\n\nRead Also: A Realistic Look at the Possibility for Shibarium to Send Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price to $0.001\n\n\u201cDid you leak the Woofpaper 2 draft to VB, bro,\u201d Kusama teased Kaal Dhairya in the caption he used in sharing an article highlighting the solutions newly presented by Buterin.\n\nAs expected, Kusama\u2019s tweet generated reactions and speculations from Shiba Inu enthusiasts. The reason for this speculation is that the Woofpaper v2 is already live for public view. Some strong SHIB advocates opined that Shytoshi Kusama could be referring to drafts of the Woofpaper v3.\n\nSolutions To Ethereum Challenges \u2013 A Brief Insight Into Buterin\u2019s Article\n\nThe article released by Vitalik Buterin pinpointed three things Ethereum needs to survive. Per the paper report, Ethereum must ensure the availability of these features; transition to roll-ups (layer-2), Smart contract wallets, and privacy-oriented measures to ensure it maintains its position at the top of blockchain technology.\n\nThe article highlighted how the transition to roll-ups would be significant in Ethereum\u2019s growth, noting that it will provide substantial scaling support to empower Ethereum.\n\nAlso, Smart contract wallets got emphasized in the article. Smart contract wallets are viable options for resolving security problems. Per the report paper, deploying privacy-oriented standards could help solve investors\u2019 privacy concerns.\n\nRead Also: Shiba Inu Team Member Releases Latest Update Regarding Shibarium Launch: Details\n\nHow Far Has Shiba Inu Gone In Addressing These Issues\n\nKusama\u2019s reaction to Buterin\u2019s article indicates that Shiba Inu already made provisions to solve these problems. The most notable anticipated solution is the Shibarium, the upcoming layer-2 network for Shiba Inu.\n\nScalability experienced in Ethereum appears solved due to Shibarium\u2019s unique nature. The Layer-2 network could double as a second layer for layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum, taking some workloads off the layer-1 blockchain.\n\n<\n\nIn addition, Shibarium promises users top-notch security features by integrating proof-of-stake (PoS) validators and the Plasma framework. In users\u2019 privacy aspect challenges, the incorporation of Bermuda, a privacy-oriented blockchain solution, would likely solve this problem.\n\nThe solutions highlighted above are the possible ways Shibarium could address the challenges highlighted in Buterin\u2019s article; it is yet to be confirmed if Kusama hinted at more efficient measures detailed in drafts of a yet-to-be-released Woofpaper version.\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, Telegram, and Google News"

        "title": "Ethereum L2 Network, Arbitrum, Shuts Down for Hours Due to a Bug - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "Outages over the blockchain network hampers general activities like transactions and operations over DeFi platforms, and more. The potential reasons for the same vary from a bug, network congestion, failure of update, etc. Out of these reasons, the Layer 2 scaling solution of Ethereum network, Arbitrum, recently got shut down for a couple of hours because of a software bug.\n\nArbitrum network users reportedly witnessed a sudden stop in mainnet transactions on Wednesday, June 7. The halt lasted for about two hours before the operations continued. Soon enough, the initial probe found a software bug behind the hindrance in the regular operations, following \u2018the sequencer\u2019 getting affected.\n\nThe developers team of Arbiturm explained in detail over Twitter about the malfunction in the sequencer, and how the bug did not let the transactions pass to the Ethereum mainnet. The automated function of refilling the wallet belonging to the node with transaction fees in ETH had also stopped. Thus, until the process resumed after a wait of two hours, the settlements piled up in abundance.\n\nIn a short period of inactivity, the activities got hampered over the network. It resulted in 2.2 Billion worth cryptocurrency transactions or movement over the Ethereum scaling network to be stopped. The decentralized applications over the blockchain like Uniswap and GMX also faced similar experiences.\n\nThe sequencer, which is a full node of Arbitrum designated and responsible to carry forward the users\u2019 transactions to Layer 1, was said to be behind the outage over the network. This way the node becomes crucial for the transaction process over the network. One of the two wallets involved in the transaction to send it over Ethereum needs to hold ETH equivalent to transaction fees.\n\nHelping Hand for Ethereum Network\n\nBlockchain research and development company, Off Chain Labs, developed Arbitrum in 2018. The layer 2 scaling solution was aimed to burden-off the heavily loaded with activities off the Ethereum mainnet. Akin to other networks based on rollup systems, the network facilitates off-chain transactions to its users. The scaling solution currently holds total value locked (TVL) worth 2.2 Billion USD.\n\nIts Optimistic Rollup Technology empowers the solution for boosting its transactions across decentralized applications. Arbitrum network primarily collects the transactions together and makes them bundled in batches prior to forwarding it to the Ethereum network.\n\nThe network had been through the Nito upgrade in August, last year. Since the upgrade, it has had outages about eight times lasting from 30 minutes to 2 hours.\n\nUSDC Stablecoin on Arbitrum\n\nStablecoin issuer, Circle, announced the launch of its native USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin on Arbitrum. Following the upgrade, the blockchain network becomes the ninth one to support USDC. The stablecoin will continue its inherent facilities over the new network."
