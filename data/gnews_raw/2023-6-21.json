Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the past 24 hours, the second most popular cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has added nearly 6%, rising to the $1,821 level. A recent tweet published by the Santiment analytics team hints at the reasons that have suddenly pushed ETH up.\n\nEthereum jumps 5.93%: reasons behind it\n\nThe main reason, per Santiment, for the Ethereum price surge is that it has been following the growth of Bitcoin, just like the rest of the crypto market. The flagship cryptocurrency recaptured the $28,000 level (surging by 7.71% within 24 hours) after the news of main Wall Street companies \u2014 Fidelity, Charles Schwab and Citadel Securities \u2014 launching a crypto exchange dubbed EDX.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Powered by #Bitcoin's jump back above $28.8k & #Ethereum's return above $1,820, price pumps are being seen market-wide. Based on @santimentfeed's coverage of 2,648 #crypto assets, volume is 30.2% higher than the past week & discussion rates are up big. https://t.co/ZB9dcl8Tvv pic.twitter.com/TFIZha0ylk \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 21, 2023\n\nThe news of these top players entering the crypto space has apparently fueled the sudden spike of Bitcoin followed by Ethereum and other cryptos jumping in price as well. Prior to that, the world's largest wealth manager, BlackRock, announced that it filed for a Bitcoin spot ETF, with rumors about Fidelity having similar plans following almost immediately.\n\nBesides, as reported by U.Today earlier, global wealth management company Invesco also filed for a spot BTC exchange-traded fund, according to a recently published SEC document.\n\nAside from the new Wall Street-backed exchange, a lot of dormant BTC whales have begun moving their Bitcoins back into the market, according to another tweet by Santiment.\n\nSantiment also stated that Ethereum was pushed up not only by Bitcoin but also by a massive surge in trading volume on the crypto market \u2014 $222 billion last week, which was 30% more than the week before that seen.\n\nWall Street enters crypto, while SEC sues major exchanges\n\nLast week, the crypto market experienced a wave of shock as the SEC filed charges against the two largest crypto exchanges in the U.S., Binance and Coinbase. The regulator claimed that these platforms violated U.S. securities laws.\n\nThis happened after SEC first sued Ripple Labs in late 2020 and has recently been clamping down on various crypto platforms, including, again, Coinbase (when it forbade them to launch a crypto lending service last year) and Kraken.\n\nHowever, at the same time, large Wall Street companies are entering the crypto space as was mentioned above, including the largest bank in Germany, Deutsche Bank, now seeking a license to start offering crypto custodial services to its clients.\n\nSome thought leaders in crypto believe that the SEC is sweeping out major crypto companies from the U.S., so that Wall Street giants can take their place and grab up their income. However, many Bitcoin maxis believe that Wall Street entering crypto is a great sign for Bitcoin adoption and for BTC's future."

        "title": "AWS Nitro Enclaves for running Ethereum validators \u2013 Part 1 | Amazon Web Services - AWS Blog",
        "content": "In this series of posts, we provide prescriptive guidance in secure operation of Ethereum validator keys using AWS Nitro Enclaves for node operators who provide staking pools and staking-as-a-service.\n\nIn this post (Part 1), we explain why AWS Nitro Enclaves are well suited to run Ethereum validators in a secure fashion and we provide a high-level architecture of such a Nitro Enclaves-based validator signing service.\n\nIn the code sample GitHub repository, we provide a step-by-step walkthrough of how to deploy a Nitro Enclaves-based validator signing service.\n\nIn Part 2, we conduct a technical deep dive into the Nitro Enclaves-based validator architecture.\n\nEthereum proof-of-stake and validators\n\nPublic blockchains differ in their protocol and consensus design, implementation language, and smart contract capabilities.\n\nDetermining how external participants can be incentivized to join a network and run their own node is key in economic design principles rooted in game theory, where you\u2019re designing the network to be more decentralized while improving robustness.\n\nEthereum transitioned its consensus mechanism from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in September 2022 to achieve better security, lower energy consumption requirements, and further enable scaling solutions built on top of it. In a proof-of-stake network, the network participants, called validators, are responsible for checking and attesting that new blocks proposed by other validators are valid, and occasionally creating and proposing (propagating) new blocks themselves. As an economic incentive, validators earn rewards in the form of Ether for performing these tasks.\n\nTo ensure that validators behave honestly, each validator must stake 32 Ether (ETH) as collateral into a smart contract. If the validator behaves dishonestly, such as attempting to propose an invalid block, their collateral will be slashed. There are also minor slashing penalties for being offline, but these are far less significant than penalties for dishonest behavior. Each validator has a public-private keypair associated with it, which we explore in more depth later in this post. For more information on proof-of-stake, refer to PROOF-OF-STAKE (POS).\n\nThere are multiple ways for users to participate in Ethereum staking:\n\nRun their own validator nodes \u2013 Users run and maintain validator nodes and have 32 ETH per validator to deposit as collateral. The user has full control of the node and the validator key. Use a staking-as-a-service provider \u2013 Users still provide 32 ETH per validator, but offload the operational aspects to a node provider who runs the validator nodes, and maintains the validator keys for the user. Join a staking pool \u2013 Users can stake any amount of ETH. The ETH staked by the users are pooled and validator nodes are run by an entrusted third party. This option is attractive to users who don\u2019t have 32 ETH or are not comfortable staking that amount.\n\n\n\nIn the first scenario, the user realizes all of the rewards, whereas in the other two scenarios, the providers may take a percentage of the rewards as payment for their services.\n\nImportance of securing validator keys\n\nRunning Ethereum validator nodes is crucial for the health of the Ethereum network but poses a potential security risk. The validator keys (the public and private keys) are used to collect and withdraw the 32 ETH collateral and any rewards that have been collected. The withdrawal feature is available in Ethereum\u2019s Shapella update. Generating and storing validator keys in an unsecure manner poses risks of leaked keys. Other than withdrawal of the collateral from malicious parties, leaked keys can also be used to perform long-range attacks, putting the entire Ethereum network at risk of a history rewrite. Long-range attacks work by creating and maintaining a parallel chain, thereby rewriting the entire history of the blockchain. To reconstruct a parallel chain, the keys of past validators are needed.\n\nYou can use services like AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to mitigate some of the risks associated with the handling of private keys that need to be programmatically accessible (hot wallets or warm wallets). For additional information on how to use AWS KMS for regular Ethereum account keys, refer to How to sign Ethereum EIP-1559 transactions using AWS KMS.\n\nDue to the BLS12-381 elliptic curve introduced for the Ethereum consensus layer, services like AWS KMS can\u2019t be used to protect validator keys as of this writing. Therefore, there is a need for a secure run environment to use the validator keys.\n\nThe following solution is primarily aimed at node operators who provide staking pools and staking-as-a-service. Individual stakers can also adopt the solution, but might find the cost of running the solution prohibitive if they only stake the minimum amount of ETH.\n\nSolution overview\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the architecture for our Nitro Enclaves-based validator signing service.\n\nNitro Enclaves use the Nitro Hypervisor to provide an isolated compute environment to protect and securely process highly sensitive data like personally identifiable information (PII) or private keys.\n\nThe hypervisor isolates the CPU and memory of the enclave from the parent instance and just exposes a secure local channel (vsock) for the communication between the parent instance and the enclave. That way, no user, application, or library of the parent instance is able to get access to critical information processed inside the enclave.\n\nEvery 12 seconds, a new block is proposed to the Ethereum network. This is referred to as a slot. Validator clients such as Lighthouse and Teku attest the proposed block. Occasionally, instead of attesting, a validator is randomly selected to propose a block. Both attestations and block proposals have to be signed by a validator private key. In our solution, the validator client has been configured to perform remote signing\u2014in other words, offloading the signing process to Web3Signer, an open-source blockchain signing service. It does this by invoking Web3Signer\u2019s HTTPS REST API.\n\nWeb3Signer will sign attestations and block proposals, using the plaintext validator private keys that are loaded into the enclave. The encrypted validator private keys are stored in Amazon DynamoDB. In a staking-as-a-service provider, there can be hundreds of validator private keys mapped to multiple Web3Signer instances, therefore it\u2019s operationally simpler and more cost-efficient to use DynamoDB instead of AWS Secrets Manager. The validator private keys are encrypted using a KMS key.\n\nIn our architecture, Web3Signer runs in the Nitro Enclave. It\u2019s important to point out that in terms of security, the Web3Signer runtime is provided by a Nitro Enclave and therefore is protected from attacks or risks like memory dumps or insufficient file system privileges. Nevertheless, by exposing Web3Signer\u2019s HTTPS REST API via vsocket to the VPC, new potential attack vectors are being introduced associated with the application itself, which can\u2019t be mitigated by a secure runtime environment like Nitro Enclaves. These attack vectors require a different set of measurements, like preventing public API access or advanced authentication mechanisms like client certificate based authentication.\n\nThe next section in this post provides details on how the private keys are decrypted and loaded into Web3Signer in Nitro Enclave.\n\nTo ensure high availability, the Web3Signer Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances are deployed in an Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. These instances load the same validator keys from DynamoDB. A Network Load Balancer (NLB) forwards the signing request to one of the instances. Multiple validator clients can connect to the same NLB.\n\nEC2 instances hosting Nitro Enclaves should not be publicly accessible and therefore are located in private subnets. EC2 instances have secure outbound internet access via a NAT gateway to download operating system updates and other packages. In a production environment, updates and other dependencies can be provided by custom Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). That way, no outbound internet connectivity is required.\n\nCommunication with AWS services like AWS KMS or DynamoDB should not traverse the internet and therefore is kept private via interface VPC endpoints that have been placed inside the subnets in each Availability Zone.\n\nAlso, the provided AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) source just covers the area in the architecture diagram marked in red. Validator clients and beacon-chain or consensus layer clients have to be deployed separately. The high-availability design and slashing protection for validator and beacon-chain clients are outside the scope of this series of posts.\n\nBootstrapping and signing flow\n\nThe following diagram depicts the components deployed inside the EC2 instances and the general communication flow with external AWS services like DynamoDB and AWS KMS.\n\nIn general, there are two prerequisites:\n\nOne or more Ethereum validator keys have been encrypted and stored inside DynamoDB. To securely generate and encrypt Ethereum validator keys, refer to Securely generate Ethereum validator keys at low cost using a serverless architecture on AWS. For testing purposes, a similar functionality is provided in the walkthrough section of the accompanying AWS CDK code.\n\nA TLS key-pair for Web3Signer has been encrypted and stored inside DynamoDB. Instructions on how to generate the TLS keypair are provided in the README section of the accompanying AWS CDK code.\n\nThe following steps explain at a high level how Ethereum attestations and block proposals are signed inside Nitro Enclaves. The numbers correspond with the numbers shown in the preceding diagram.\n\nIf all config artifacts are present, the enclave can start. All artifacts are passed into the enclave in encrypted fashion. kmstool-enclave-cli, a tool provided by the Nitro Enclave service team, is used from inside the enclave to decrypt the config artifacts using cryptographic attestation. The decrypt request augmented with the cryptographic attestation document is routed to AWS KMS via vsock-proxy provided by AWS. All decrypted config artifacts are stored on the enclaves in memory file system. The Web3Signer process starts. After the enclave has successfully been bootstrapped with the provided TLS keypair and the Ethereum 2 private key, https_proxy will act as an HTTPS endpoint for Web3Signer running inside the enclave. The Web3Signer API endpoint is now exposed to outside of the EC2 instance and able to process incoming signing requests, for example, originating from an Ethereum 2 validator node. Signing requests are forwarded inside the enclave via the vsock connection, in an encrypted way. The TLS connection between the validation client and Web3Signer is stopped inside the enclave, resulting in an end-to-end encrypted transport.\n\nAdditional details about the HTTPS over vsocks tunnel and the bootstrapping process can be found in Part 2 of this series.\n\nIn terms of configuration, you shouldn\u2019t configure more than one validator client to the same validator keys. Doing so poses a high risk of signing attestations for different block proposals, or proposing different blocks in the same slot. These activities will lead to slashing and result in losing some of the validator\u2019s staked ETH. Web3Signer offers a slashing protection feature to protect against these scenarios. To simplify the deployment, Web3Signer in the accompanying AWS CDK code doesn\u2019t have slashing protection. However, this could be included in future revisions of the code.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post, we provided a high-level introduction to Nitro Enclaves and explained why Nitro is well suited to run Ethereum validators. We also explained the high-level bootstrapping and signing process using Nitro Enclave.\n\nYou can deploy the solution by following the instructions in the end-to-end walkthrough located in the GitHub repository. You can also dive deep into the Web3Signer integration pattern, secure bootstrapping of processes inside Nitro Enclaves, and HTTPS over vsock tunnels in Part 2.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nDavid-Paul Dornseifer is a Blockchain Architect with the AWS Worldwide Specialist Solutions Architect organization.

        "content": "Ethereum has reached another milestone, with over 23.5 million ETH deposited for staking.\n\nStaking is the process of locking up a cryptocurrency in a proof-of-stake blockchain to contribute to network security and earn rewards.\n\nSimilar to depositing cash into high-yield accounts at big banks, staking enables token holders to earn passive income on their assets without having to sell or trade them.\n\nThe more people who stake, the more secure the blockchain becomes.\n\nETH price is heavily dependent on its value against the US dollar. In November 2021, when the price of ETH reached an all-time high of $4,400, there had only been 8.2 million staked ETH \u2014 which is roughly $15 billion \u2014 locked in the network.\n\nCurrently, with ETH priced at $1,880, over $38 billion is being used to secure the network.\n\nAlthough validators have had the opportunity to stake ETH since the Ethereum Merge in September last year, staking didn\u2019t grow dramatically in popularity until the Shapella upgrade, which enabled withdrawals.\n\nThere has been a net inflow of 3.6 million staked ETH ($6.9 billion) following the Shanghai upgrade, showing that interest in the Ethereum blockchain has remained at an all-time high.\n\nThe total circulating supply of ether is currently at 120.2 million ETH, and staked ETH makes up roughly 19.4% of all the ether on-chain. That is equivalent to roughly 6.4% of bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization fully staked in Ethereum.\n\nIn fact, staked ETH is becoming so popular, that the raw number of ETH staked on the Ethereum blockchain is about to surpass the total amount of ether that is kept on all cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nThe growing interest in Ethereum staking is a positive sign for the network, and indicates that ETH holders are moving away from centralized entities and into more decentralized spaces.\n\nUpdated Jun. 25, 2023 at 5:01 pm ET: Corrected rate of change in headline.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Will Ethereum Be a Trillion-Dollar Cryptocurrency by 2024? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum, as the world's second-biggest cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin, already is a billion-dollar player. This cryptocurrency and blockchain is a market leader, attracting developers and users to its platform -- and investors to buy and stake coins.\n\nBut the past year hasn't been easy for cryptocurrency in general. The market's value tumbled last year. Amid economic woes, people turned away from cryptocurrency and favored the safest investments. This year, the crypto market has been on the rise -- but it's slipped from its 2023 peak reached in April. Could this hold back Ethereum? Or could this market leader become a trillion-dollar cryptocurrency by 2024? Let's find out.\n\nDevelopers love Ethereum\n\nIf you ask developers which blockchain they're building on, many of them would say Ethereum. In fact, the blockchain has the most total developers of any other player, according to the latest Electric Capital developer report. And the number has increased 52% from two years ago to more than 5,800.\n\nWinning over developers is key because they are the ones building content -- and that, in turn, adds to the use cases for a particular blockchain.\n\nAnd that's part of why Ethereum also is a leader when it comes to hosting decentralized applications (dApps). This big player is No. 1 in the sales of non-fungible tokens, too, CryptoSlam data show.\n\nStill, people have had one complaint about Ethereum since its early days. That's its slow transaction speed and the costs associated with this. But the good news is Ethereum is working on this problem, and thanks to a series of planned updates, the blockchain should become much faster and cheaper down the road.\n\nEthereum has already started that process. An update last year helped the blockchain reduce its energy consumption by 99%. That's as it switched to the proof-of-stake validation method from proof of work. While proof of work relies on intense computational power to validate blocks of data, proof of stake doesn't. Instead, it grants the right to validate to those holding a significant stake.\n\nThe role of rollups\n\nEthereum also is scaling up by using a layer 2 solution known as a rollup. Rollups involve handling transactions in batches and then sending output back to the mainnet. Already, rollups are as much as eight times cheaper than using the mainnet -- and in the future, fees could become at least 40 times cheaper.\n\nThe blockchain also is working on improving security and even \"future proofing\" the system. For example, eventually quantum computing may represent a risk for the cryptography used to secure Ethereum today. Even though the threat probably is far down the road, right now Ethereum is exploring two forms of quantum-safe cryptography.\n\nAll of this means the Ethereum of tomorrow is likely to be even better than the Ethereum of today. Now, let's consider whether that could push Ethereum from its $208 billion market value of today into trillion-dollar territory. If we use today's circulating supply of Ethereum -- about 120 million coins -- we can see that to reach a market value of $1 trillion, Ethereum would have to more than quadruple from today's price.\n\nThe economic backdrop\n\nAgainst a strong economic backdrop, that could happen rather quickly. But I'm not convinced we're there yet. The Federal Reserve is modeling for a recession later this year. Even though it's expected to be mild, this still could weigh on demand for crypto. Ethereum has increased more than 40% this year. And it still may continue to climb -- but it may not do so at a pace that will catapult it to $1 trillion in value by next year.\n\nThat said, this isn't bad news. Ethereum's outlook remains bright. And planned upgrades should help the network excel over the long term. And that's great news for investors who buy this leading cryptocurrency now."

        "content": "Earlier this year, developers on Bitcoin were inspired by Ethereum\u2019s non-fungible tokens and created their own spin on blockchain collectibles with Bitcoin\u2019s Ordinals. Five months and over 12 million ordinals later, developers on Ethereum are feeling similarly inspired by Ordinals to create another new collectible called Ethscriptions.\n\nNamed after the inscription process that is used to create Ordinals, Ethscriptions allow images, files, or text under 96 kilobytes to be stored on-chain using almost any type of Ethereum transaction type.

An analysis of Ether\u2019s price (ETH) and market capitalization shows indisputable evidence that the blockchain has been gaining market share.\n\nEther market capitalization dominance (%). Source: TradingView\n\nAs shown above, Ether\u2019s dominance in market capitalization terms has grown over the past couple of years, from an 18% average in July 2021 to the current 20%. Excluding Bitcoin (BTC) from the analysis, Ether\u2019s market share presently stands at 40.6%, while its next competitor, BNB (BNB), holds a 7.2% share.\n\nThe disparity between Ethereum and others is also evident when analyzing the total value locked (TVL) on each network\u2019s smart contracts. Ethereum is the absolute leader with $24.6 billion in TVL, followed by Tron\u2019s $5.4 billion and BNB Chain\u2019s $3.3 billion.\n\nTotal value locked market share (%). Source: DefiLlama\n\nThe above chart depicts how Ethereum\u2019s TVL market share declining from 70.5% in June 2021 to 49.5% in May 2022 as Terra and Avalanche gained a combined 20% market share. However, following the Terra ecosystem collapse in May 2022 \u2014 which culminated in developers halting network activity \u2014 Ethereum quickly regained a 58% market share.\n\nDespite the emergence of DApps on the BNB and Tron blockchains, Ethereum\u2019s leadership has remained uncontested over the past 12 months. This data shows the irrelevance of the total number of unique active wallets (UAW) interacting with smart contracts per chain.\n\nFor instance, according to DappRadar, WAX has 363,600 active users, followed by BNB Chain\u2019s 517,300 30-day UAW. These figures are way higher than the Ethereum network\u2019s 66,300 unique active addresses, but they reflect much lower transaction fee, opening room for manipulation.\n\nDecentralization matters, and Ethereum stands out among its competitors\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem has the highest number of active developers, surpassing 1,870, which is more than the next three competitors \u2014 Polkadot (752), Cosmos (511) and Solana (383) \u2014 combined.\n\nCurrently, the Ethereum network has over 700,000 validators, with 99% of the balances locked in staking participating in the process. The 32 ETH threshold limit per validator undoubtedly inflates this number, but Lido, the largest known staking pool, controls 32% of the staking, with Coinbase coming in second with 9.6%.\n\nConsequently, it is safe to say that Ethereum is far less centralized in terms of development and validation compared with Tron, BNB Chain and Solana.\n\nOther reasons Ether\u2019s dominance has been on the rise, even as Bitcoin reached a 50% market share on June 19, include derivatives activity and its dominance of the NFT market\n\nDerivatives markets are essential to institutional investors\n\nEther\u2019s future contracts are essential for institutional trading practices like hedging and trading with leverage. Ether\u2019s cash-settled futures were added to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in February 2021. To date, no other cryptocurrency, apart from Bitcoin, has reached the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchange.\n\nIn futures markets, longs and shorts are balanced at all times, but having a larger number of active contracts \u2014 open interest \u2014 allows the participation of institutional investors who require a minimum market size. Ether futures aggregated open interest stands at $5.4 billion, while competitor BNB hold $380 million and Solana a mere $178 million.\n\nEthereum is still the market leader in NFTs\n\nNonfungible tokens are a perfect example of how cheaper, faster transactions do not always translate to increased adoption. Nothing is stopping NFT projects from shifting between blockchains, whether for new listings or existing collections. In fact, y00ts and DeGods moved to Polygon earlier in 2023.\n\nDespite facing gas fees that often break above $10, Ethereum remains the absolute leader in the number of buyers and total sales. According to CryptoSlam, the leading network reached $380 million in sales over the past 30 days, while Solana, Polygon and BNB Chain totaled a combined $93 million.\n\nUltimately, the data favors Ethereum versus its competing smart contract-focused blockchains. The positive trend in Ether\u2019s dominance might fade over time if the promised network upgrade to allow parallel processing (sharding) does not come to fruition, but for now, Ether\u2019s 20% market capitalization share remains unchallenged.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum price is rallying above $1,850 against the US Dollar. ETH is clearly following Bitcoin\u2019s rally and might soon test the $2,000 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum is moving higher above the $1,850 and $1,880 resistance levels.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,890 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could rise further above the $1,930 and $1,950 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Surges Over 6%\n\nEthereum\u2019s price started a steady increase above the $1,720 resistance zone. Recently, Bitcoin saw a major increase and helped ETH to clear the $1,850 resistance.\n\nThe price is up over 6% and there was a move above the $1,900 level. A high is formed near $1,930 and the price is now consolidating gains. It is trading well above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent rally from the $1,715 swing low to the $1,930 high.\n\nEther is also well above $1,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,890 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nImmediate resistance is near the $1,930 level. The next major resistance is near the $1,950 level. A successful move above the $1,930 and $1,950 resistance levels might send the price further higher. The next resistance sits near $2,000, above which Ethereum could rise toward the $2,050 level. Any more gains above the $2,050 resistance zone might send the price toward the $2,120 resistance.\n\nAre Dips Supported in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,950 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,900 level.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,880 level or the recent low. If there is a break and close below the $1,880 support, the price could drop toward the $1,820 support or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent rally from the $1,715 swing low to the $1,930 high. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,780 zone or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is in the overbought zone.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,780\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,950\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The connection between Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, although it\u2019s been public for years, is suddenly a very big deal. That\u2019s because as the industry pores over Prometheum, now the SEC\u2019s poster child for regulatory compliance, Crypto Twitter has realized that the startup is partly owned by Shanghai Wanxiang Blockchain.\n\nCrypto Twitter is in shock that Vitalik Buterin was the Chief Scientist for Wanxiang. I don't think they realize yet that it was Wanxiang that setup and funded the wallets for both the Ethereum Foundation, & Vitalik Buterin. Yes CT, it goes much much Deeper. https://t.co/PzG45UE7Ys \u2014 TruthLabs \ud83d\udc84 (@BoringSleuth) June 16, 2023\n\nEyebrows were raised among the digital assets community following testimony from Prometheum co-CEO Aaron Kaplan on Capitol Hill, where his sentiments on regulatory compliance contrasted talking points from countless crypto firms and mirrored statements made by the SEC.\n\nPrometheum touts that it's the first crypto firm ordained by the SEC and a member of FINRA, the finance-focused self-regulatory organization. Upheld by Gary Gensler as an example of how regulatory compliance for crypto companies is indeed possible, the firms' connection to Shanghai Wanxiang Blockchain drew scrutiny.\n\nWanxiang Blockchain Labs is a non-profit organization and China-based research institution started in 2015 by China Wanxiang Holding. The Labs\u2019 resources were integrated into Shanghai Wanxiang Blockchain, a firm established in 2017.\n\nWhy Vitalik Buterin is Known as the 'V God' in China\n\nButerin\u2019s connection to the nonprofit can be traced back to Ethereum\u2019s early days. In 2015, then-CEO of Wanxiang Blockchain Labs Feng Xiao formed a relationship with Buterin and purchased $500,000 worth of Ethereum. The funds helped Buterin pay developers, according to a report from Global Coin Research.\n\nStory continues\n\nButerin was one of several guest speakers at Blockchain Week 2016, a conference co-hosted by the Ethereum Foundation and Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, which also featured talks from Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire and Ripple Labs co-founder Jed McCaleb, according to the event\u2019s website.\n\nAt the time Buterin was described on the event\u2019s website as Wanxiang Blockchain Labs\u2019s chief scientist. That assertion is backed by a description of Buterin\u2019s role on the non-profits\u2019 website now. Separately, Buterin is described as a co-founder of the non-profit on Facebook.\n\nEthereum co-founder @VitalikButerin is listed as a co-founder of @WXblockchain, a part owner of @PrometheumInc which was recently given rights to operate a #crypto exchange in the U.S. Other filings show Buterin is also Chief Scientist at Wanxiang Blockchain Labs. pic.twitter.com/ywdl4u97RM \u2014 Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) June 21, 2023\n\nNeither Wanxiang Blockchain Labs nor the Ethereum Foundation immediately responded to a request for comment from Decrypt.\n\nPrometheum established a strategic partnership and joint development agreement with Shanghai Wanxiang Blockchain years later in 2018, according to an SEC filing. The deal gave Prometheum access to Wanxiang\u2019s \u201ctechnology resources, industry contacts, [and] intellectual capital,\u201d adding that the organizations are committed to sharing resources.\n\nPrometheum eventually terminated its agreement with Shanghai Wanxiang Blockchain in October 2021, Kaplan of Prometheum wrote in written testimony prepared for the House Financial Services Committee last week. After a year, it was apparent that \u201cjoint development was not viable,\u201d according to Kaplan.\n\n\u201cWanxiang and its affiliates have no access to any Prometheum code, technology, software, or to the Prometheum ecosystem,\u201d he wrote, adding the company\u2019s code has been developed internally. \u201cPrometheum is proud to be an American-born, bred, and controlled company.\u201d"

        "content": "Most information about Ethereum is in English and, as a result, appeals to Western investors. However, evidence uncovered by Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, court cases, and online archives points to a heavy Chinese influence.\n\nAlthough early Etherians remember some Chinese backers, modern investors could be forgiven for barely recalling the blockchain\u2019s Chinese ties. Here\u2019s a refresher for newer users.\n\nEthereum\u2019s whitepaper published in Chinese\n\nVitalik Buterin personally ensured that the Ethereum Wiki published a Chinese language version of the Ethereum whitepaper by January 22, 2015 \u2014 more than six months before the Ethereum mainnet went live at the end of July.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s interest in speaking Chinese\n\nAccording to Laura Shin\u2019s book The Cryptopians, as early as January 2014, when the Ethereum team met in Miami to announce Bitcoin 2.0, Vitalik Buterin seemed preoccupied with learning the Chinese language using a phone app.\n\nEthereum hosted a conference in China\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation hosted a conference in Shanghai in September 2016. Ethereum Foundation board member Ming Chan sang the praises of China to attendees, saying: \u201cShanghai is both a global financial hub and home to many of Asia\u2019s blockchain pioneers, where the blockchain community continues to grow and is eager to share what China has to offer the greater ecosystem.\u201d\n\nDuring that conference, Enterprise Ethereum Alliance founder Victor Wong further opined that China could become one of the biggest blockchain markets on Earth.\n\nEthereum\u2019s ex-Alibaba partners\n\nAn old version of the official Ethereum website on Archive.org\u2019s Wayback Machine names Chinese partners, including ex-Alibaba engineer Bin Lu and senior product expert Jerry Liu. Liu also worked at IBM China.\n\nThe Ethereum team shortly before the launch of the ICO. Now a serious question, what are \"Chinese partners\"? Or rather, why name the nationality at all? What does it mean to be a Chinese Partner? Are they representatives of the Chinese government or the CCP?

Some of the largest Ethereum miners were Chinese. One particularly notable miner was Chandler Guo who played an important role in The Dao hack reversal (Ethereum Classic). Guo remained an active participant in Ethereum\u2019s consensus decision-making.\n\nEthereum Foundation executive director Ming Chan\n\nButerin also brought Ming Chan on board as the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s executive director. Ming had previously worked on the University of Michigan\u2019s China Mirror Project and a Chinese-language educational app called iWrite Wenzi. The Ethereum Foundation eventually fired her after she clashed with several board members over her influence over Buterin.\n\nCompleting The Merge thanks to Shanghai\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that Vitalik Buterin chose \u2018Shanghai\u2019 as the capstone of Ethereum\u2019s monumental transition from PoW to proof-of-stake (PoS). Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai update enabled withdrawals of staked ETH.\n\nWanxiang Blockchain CEO Dr. Xiao explained how the city of Shanghai played a major role in Ethereum\u2019s history. Xiao met Vitalik Buterin to discuss Ethereum near Shanghai in China. She offered a $500,000 donation with the potential of further funding to help fund development.\n\nAccording to Shin, that $500,000 donation became a purchase of 416,666 ETH at $1.19 per ETH. This meeting took place before Ethereum\u2019s mainnet went live in 2015.\n\n\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3@digitalassetbuy @JohnEDeaton1\n\n\n\n(1/6)\n\nFrom Vitalik to Devcon:\n\n\u201cHow Shanghai came into the fold of the Ethereum story.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHow an Army of Crypto-Hackers is Building the Next Internet with Ethereum\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cA couple of months after \u201cthe Merge\u201d, Ethereum will go\u2026 pic.twitter.com/of8EKKiW3H \u2014 Cowboy.Crypto \u2600\ufe0f (@cowboycrypto313) June 18, 2023\n\nThe Bank of China chooses Ethereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s ties to China are undeniable. The Bank of China itself chose the Ethereum blockchain \u2014 over myriad competitors and even its own permissioned blockchains \u2014 when it issued $28 million in tokenized structured notes.\n\nSpecifically, the Bank of China\u2019s investment bank, Hong Kong-based Bank of China International (BOCI), issued 220 million Chinese Offshore Yuan in digitally structured notes, making BOCI the first major Chinese financial institution to issue a tokenized security in Hong Kong.\n\nChina, of course, has a history of cracking down on blockchains that it cannot easily control. However, this move may indicate that it is willing to make an exception for Ethereum.\n\nRead more: Here\u2019s what CZ says about Binance definitely not being Chinese\n\nSEC director\u2019s connection to Chinese, pro-Ethereum money\n\nFOIA requests have unveiled some evidence of China\u2019s influence on Ethereum. Online archives and court cases helped reveal more evidence that China impacted Ethereum.\n\nFor example, watchdog Empower Oversight filed a lawsuit to force the SEC to release email exchanges between its former division of corporate finance director William Hinman and parties that included law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett and the SEC Ethics Office.\n\nWilliam Hinman is most well-known for having made a 2018 speech in which he opined that ETH was not a security because it had become \u201csufficiently decentralized.\u201d\n\nThe Ethics Office had pressured Hinman to divest from any financial stake he held in Simpson Thacher. However, he continued to draw a pension. He also met or communicated with parties related to mining hardware firm Canaan, which was about to conduct an IPO and made mining hardware for Ethereum.\n\nHe also met Chris Lin, an employee of Simpson Thacher\u2019s Hong Kong division (Simpson Thacher operates its Hong Kong explicitly to serve \u2018Greater China\u2019). An email exchange between Hinman and Lin indicates that he planned to \u201csay hello,\u201d and Hinman suggested that they meet over coffee. No known record of the topics they discussed exists. However, Ethereum could have come up in the conversation.\n\nThis included meeting his China Office partner on the very same day that a letter went out from Hinman\u2019s division regarding the Canaan IPO \u2013 an IPO handled by Hinman\u2019s law firm. Btw, what did Canaan make: BTC & ETH mining hardware (I wonder if his speech helped in anyway). pic.twitter.com/7IdzeZpTzI \u2014 John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) June 13, 2023\n\nRead more: The US dollar isn\u2019t close to losing world reserve currency status to China\n\nAfter making the most pro-Ethereum speech in SEC history, Hinman returned to work for Simpson Thacher and collected even more money.\n\nObservers like CryptoLaw founder John E. Deaton suggested that Hinman may have violated financial conflict laws.\n\nAfter the Empower emails, I said a \ud83d\ude4a could prove Hinman violated the criminal financial conflict laws. You can be found violating 18 USC 208 if you allow even only an appearance of impropriety w/o being told you\u2019re violating the law. Here, he was told multiple times but did it. \u2014 John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) June 13, 2023\n\nMore Chinese influence over Ethereum\n\nAs also noted in Shin\u2019s book, some Chinese Ethereum supporters created a site called Carbonvote.com after the infamous exploit of The Dao.\n\nThis website tallied votes on a proposed solution that proved controversial: hard-forking the Ethereum blockchain at a point just before the exploit started to restore stolen funds to their original owners. Go Ethereum lead developer Jeff Wilcke announced that the vote on Carbonvote.com would be considered official.\n\nGot a tip? Send us an email or ProtonMail.

        "title": "Ethereum Micropayments Solution Volition Aims to Make 'Crypto for Coffee Transactions Viable' - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nVolition, a new StarkWare product for the permissionless Starknet network, promises to drastically reduce Ethereum transaction fees, to the point where the network can support micropayments similar to Bitcoin's Lightning Network.\n\nSet to go live with Starknet v0.13.0 later this year, Volition will \"remove the big barrier to microtransactions,\u201d StarkWare CEO Uri Kolodny told Decrypt. \u201cIt will finally make the crypto for coffee transactions viable,\" he said, adding that, \"This will be very important for crypto adoption. It will have particular advantages in developing economies.\u201d\n\nEthereum fees, also known as gas fees, have been a concern for users of the Ethereum network for some time. Despite the network's recent major upgrades, the fees can still be often high, resulting in more challenges for users, particularly those who engage in frequent transactions or use decentralized applications (dapps).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs data from Bitinfocharts shows, Ethereum's average transaction fee, which measures the average fee when a transaction is processed and confirmed, was around $4.80 on June 22\u2014significantly lower than at this year\u2019s peak of more than $27 recorded just last month. But while that's considered reasonable for transactions involving larger amounts, it still represents a major roadblock to mainstream adoption of Ethereum.\n\nAside from the proverbial crypto for coffee, Volition's developers argue that it opens up a host of other use cases previously not possible in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThese include on-chain voting governance applications that would enable decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to vote cheaply, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or buying in-game assets.\n\n\u201cVolition will make on-chain voting so much more accessible by radically reducing its cost. People missing voting because of high fees\u2014currently common in blockchain\u2014will become a thing of the past,\u201d said Kolodny.\n\nFor on-chain gaming, the StarkWare CEO says the new scaling solution \u201csuddenly sets designers free to give a more immersive experience.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you want to offer players all sorts of different assets at different price-points, some of them very cheap,\" Kolodny told Decrypt. \"Today, a five cent asset incurs several dollars in fees; with Volition it becomes viable. Volition will set gaming free,\u201d he said.\n\nSeparating data availability\n\nOn a technical level, Starknet is a decentralized, permissionless Validity Rollup that operates as a Layer-2 network built on top of Ethereum. It provides an opportunity for any decentralized app (dapp) to significantly enhance its computational scalability without compromising the security features of the Ethereum network. By utilizing Starknet, dapps can achieve increased scale for their computations while leveraging the robustness and security provided by Ethereum's underlying infrastructure.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of Volition, developers gain the ability to optimize the transaction process by selecting the data availability mode for each individual storage variable. This is achieved by implementing Starknet's state as two separate storage commitment trees: one for Layer-1 data availability mode, which refers to data being available on the Ethereum mainnet, and one for Layer-2 data availability mode, indicating data availability on the Starknet Layer-2.\n\nData availability on a blockchain refers to the accessibility and persistence of the stored data. In a blockchain, data is typically organized into blocks, which are linked together using cryptographic hashes to form a chain. Each block contains a set of transactions or other types of data.\n\nVolition enables developers and users to choose the data availability mode for each contract. Image: StarkWare\n\nIn public networks, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, all information is stored on every node, meaning that users end up paying for the burden this puts on every block forever as everything you do is saved forever whether you need it or not.\n\nVolition claims to give users the flexibility to store the data in a place where it\u2019s still very accessible, but is distributed less widely. In other words, it implies the option of saving cost by storing data on Layer-2 instead of Layer-1 in instances where high expenditure on data availability isn\u2019t merited economically.\n\nData availability matters because it allows users to calculate the state of the chain by themselves, enabling them to continue transacting with their assets even if other nodes in the system stop cooperating.\n\nAs explained by StarkWare, the default today is that users always pay for L-1 data availability\u2014which, in turn, bloats transaction fees for small-value transactions. That\u2019s why Volition pushing the data for these transactions to Layer-2 paves the way to micro-transactions: the functionality enables developers\u2014and eventually users\u2014to pick and choose exactly when they want to use cheaper or more expensive on-chain storage options.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStarkWare claims that this could reduce gas fees by up to 90%.\n\nAccording to StarkWare, this is a feature the wider blockchain community has been talking about for some time. It all comes down to giving users a finer degree of control.\n\nFor example, developers can seek compromises by weighing their security and cost requirements on a case by case\u2014or even hour by hour\u2014basis, before deciding on the right data availability solution.\n\nAnother possible use case for Volition is trading at a decentralized exchange (DEX); it could help traders reduce fees by keeping funds on the Layer-2 level, and moving funds to the Layer-1 level when they hit a high amount, making security a priority for the DEX.\n\nFirst used on StarkEx, a permissioned version of Starknet tailored for use by protocols, Volition is expected to go live on Starknet in the third quarter of 2023."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has been recovering from a crucial support zone. However, there exists a notable resistance level that must be surpassed in order for the market to potentially transition into a bullish phase in the long term.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nThe Daily Chart:\n\nThe daily chart demonstrates a notable rebound around the $1600 level, where the 200-day moving average provided significant assistance last week.\n\nSubsequently, the price has experienced a rally and successfully surpassed both the $1800 resistance level and the 50-day moving average, both of which are expected to function as support going forward.\n\nThe current focus appears to be on surpassing the psychological resistance level of $2000, followed by the important technical area around $2300.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart:\n\nExamining the 4-hour chart, it is evident that the price found support at the lower boundary of a significant falling wedge pattern, aligning with the $1600 support level.\n\nFollowing this support, Ethereum experienced a rally, successfully surpassing both the $1750 level and the upper boundary of the wedge pattern. A bullish breakout from a falling wedge is generally viewed as a positive signal.\n\nHowever, the price is currently encountering resistance around the $1900 zone. Additionally, the RSI indicator indicates overbought conditions, suggesting the possibility of a short-term pullback or consolidation.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nEthereum Open Interest\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has recently experienced an uptick after consolidation over the past few months. This upward movement might attract the interest of investors and traders, particularly speculators in the perpetual futures market.\n\nThe open interest metric, which indicates the number of open futures positions, currently shows a relatively low value compared to current levels.\n\nThis suggests there may be lower volatility in the market until the metric increases. Consequently, it is plausible to expect a continued upward trend in the short term unless unforeseen events disrupt the current scenario."

        "content": "A recent investigation by Fox Journalist Terrett revealed that Ethereum founder Buterin has close ties with a firm with part ownership in Prometheum.\n\nIn what came up as an unexpected revelation, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has been revealed as a co-founder of Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, a non-profit research institute funded by Wanxiang Holdings. Wanxiang Holdings is one of the owners of Prometheum, with a major stake in the company.\n\nProminent Fox Journalist Eleanor Terrett disclosed this information in a recent tweet.\n\nEthereum co-founder @VitalikButerin is listed as a co-founder of @WXblockchain, a part owner of @PrometheumInc which was recently given rights to operate a #crypto exchange in the U.S. Other filings show Buterin is also Chief Scientist at Wanxiang Blockchain Labs. pic.twitter.com/ywdl4u97RM \u2014 Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) June 21, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nA Web of Connections\n\nEssentially, China Wanxiang Holdings is a holding company that manufactures auto parts through its subsidiary firms. Wanxiang\u2019s Executive Director is Dr. Feng Xiao. Terrett\u2019s recent disclosure suggests that Wanxiang Holdings is behind the funding of Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, a non-profit organization.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum founder Buterin and Dr. Feng Xiao are two of the three founders of the non-profit Wanxiang Blockchain Labs. In addition, Dr. Xiao is one of the earliest sponsors of Ethereum.\n\nA Medium article by Wanxiang Blockchain reveals that Dr. Xiao proposed to donate $500,000 to the Ethereum Foundation in April 2015 to support the Ethereum mainnet launch. This proposal was made to Buterin in Wanxiang headquarters, and the donation was made under Wanxiang.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe disclosure further reveals that Wanxiang Holdings is one of the owners of Prometheum, with a major stake in the company. An SEC filing by Prometheum shows that HashKey, a partner of Wanxiang, bought 68.8 million Prometheum shares and others for $12 million in 2018.\n\nHashKey also entered a negotiation to acquire 10% of Prometheum for $12.5 million. The deal was to go through after the SEC and FINRA approved Prometheum as a broker-dealer.\n\nInterestingly, Dr. Xiao, Executive Director of Wanxiang, is also the Chairman of HashKey. Following the purchase of Prometheum shares, Dr. Xiao became a member of Prometheum\u2019s board of directors.\n\nConnecting the Dots\n\nThe disclosure has garnered attention from the broader crypto community, given the fact that Prometheum is the only crypto-focused company lauding the SEC\u2019s crackdown on the crypto industry. Prometheum has received a license to operate as a digital asset securities platform, positioned by the SEC as the ideal compliant company.\n\nThe recent discovery unlocks the connection between Prometheum and Ethereum co-founder Buterin at a time when SEC Chairperson Gary Gensler has refused to label Ethereum a security despite asserting that all assets using the proof-of-stake mechanism are securities.\n\nMoreover, the recently released Hinman documents reveal that Bill Hinman, former SEC Director, aimed to make his infamous 2018 speech about Ethereum. The documents disclosed that Hinman would later go on to speak with Buterin following the speech. This raised speculations of a collusion between the SEC and Ethereum.\n\nThe latest revelation has fueled these speculations, especially as it has uncovered that the SEC appears to have been protecting two crypto entities with close ties to Buterin: Ethereum and Prometheum.\n\nRecall that reports of Ethereum being \u201cChinese-controlled\u201d emerged two years ago following a report from Ripple in the wake of the SEC lawsuit. The Ripple report claimed that Bitcoin and Ethereum were \u201csusceptible to Chinese control.\u201d Buterin dismissed these claims and alleged that Ripple was out to throw Ethereum under the bus in an attempt to save its \u201csh*tcoin.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the XRP community speculated that the SEC and Ethereum insiders colluded to attack XRP which was perceived as a competition to Ethereum then. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson previously dismissed these claims as \u201cconspiracy theories.\u201d"

        "content": "The bull market is around the corner. This means there\u2019s a chance to be a millionaire if you hold the right token. Very few tokens qualify as \u201cright\u201d as much as Ethereum. So ETH is one of your best chances to be a millionaire.\n\nBut how much ETH do you need to achieve this? That\u2019s what we want to show you.\n\nHistorical Performance of ETH\n\nBefore I come to an exact number of ETH you need to become a millionaire, you and I need to understand where Ethereum could go from here. But we first need to understand where it\u2019s been. Most of us are not whales holding hundreds of thousands of ETH. So this means we will need to see a big price move to become an Ethereum millionaire.\n\nBut it could happen. Ethereum isn\u2019t a stranger in the crypto community. It is currently ranked #2 by market cap, just behind Bitcoin.\n\nSo, the current ETH price is $1,810.11. It has a circulating supply of 120,206.250. Ethereum has a market cap of $217,555,405,540. This means it makes up a significant portion of the $1 trillion crypto sector as a whole.\n\nEthereum is your best bet in crypto, right after Bitcoin. Its all-time high was $4,815.00 on November 9, 2021. ETH took a hit from the bear market, like everything else. But, it still has a promising future. Ethereum is arguably the altcoin with the biggest potential. Ethereum has several factors that guarantee its long-term success.\n\nSmart contracts\n\nAlso, Ethereum is the first smart contract platform. Smart contracts are the pillar behind the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi). So, Ethereum is home to some of the best DeFi projects.\n\nNFTs\n\nEthereum is the most widely used platform for NFT marketplaces. I agree that NFTs\u2019 popularity has gone down. But if it were to pick up, Ethereum would have a leading position.\n\nThe Metaverse\n\nEthereum is arguably one of the most popular blockchains for metaverse projects. Top metaverse projects like The Sandbox and Decentraland are built on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nEthereum hosts several other cryptocurrencies on its network. Projects like Polygon and Shiba Inu rely on Ethereum. So, Ethereum has all it takes to succeed and exceed its past glory. Do you think Ethereum can hit a new all-time high? Let us know in the comments below.\n\nWhat Does Ethereum\u2019s ETH Chart Say?\n\nWe asked our Technical Analysis team to look at Ethereum. And here\u2019s what they had to say:\n\n\u201cETH is currently trading at a crucial support zone. Failure to hold this support at $1673 could lead to a drop towards $1478, $1194, and $1081, which seems more likely. If ETH manages to stay above $1673, we could start seeing a continuation of bullish momentum towards $2133, $2684, and $3561, which is a less likely scenario.\u201d\n\nSo can ETH hit a new ATH? I definitely think it can in the next bull run.\n\nETH\u2019s lowest point before the start of the last bull market was 89.66 on March 9, 2020. But it picked up in the 2021 bull market and hit an ATH of $4,815.00 on November 9, 2021. That\u2019s about 54.01X.\n\nEthereum has an even more developed ecosystem now than it did then. There have also been a lot of updates and upgrades, such as\n\nThe Merge\n\nShanghai Hard Fork.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen how crazy ETH gets in previous bull runs. I doubt if anything is going to change that in the next bull run.\n\nHow Much ETH = $1 Million?\n\nSo you\u2019ve seen our bull arguments based on:\n\n\n\nMarket value growth.\n\nMarket value dominance.\n\nTechnical analysis.\n\nThriving ecosystem.\n\nSo how much ETH do you need to be a millionaire? We see ETH surpassing its ATH in the next bull run. Our analysis places it somewhere around $6000. If that\u2019s the case, you\u2019ll need about 166.67 ETH tokens to be a millionaire.\n\nEthereum could definitely go above $6k in the next bull run. But I think that\u2019s a more comfortable probability. For 2023, I\u2019ll place Ethereum\u2019s near-term high at $2,100. What\u2019s your take on all of these? Let us know in the comment section below.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Our popular Altcoin Buzz Access group generates tons of alpha for our subscribers.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nTraders focused on the midterm performance of altcoins usually try to identify the narratives, i.e., the subclasses of tokens surrounded by mainstream hype in this particular period of time and united by some \"theme.\" Here's how this strategy actually works on a three-month time frame.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) outperformed all trends of 2023, analyst says\n\nA hypothetical investment portfolio that includes only Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the two largest and most traded cryptocurrencies, would outperform all \"baskets\" based on popular mainstream narratives of 2023. Such calculations were published by a pseudonymous crypto researcher who goes by @thedefivillain in Twitter.\n\nRecent performance of different coin categories, fyi pic.twitter.com/GCrwqENRrl \u2014 VIKTOR (@thedefivillain) June 21, 2023\n\nSurprisingly, the simplest combination of the largest cryptocurrencies would bring profit on all time frames \u2014 from 24 hours to 90 days. All narratives have only come into the \"green zone\" in the last seven days.\n\nIn the two- or three-month perspective, all narratives registered painful double-digit losses. The ecosystems of Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP) and Fantom (FTM), together with \"new coins\" \u2014 tokens like CANTO, BLUR and SUI \u2014 are the worst sufferers as they almost lose 50% of their capitalization metrics.\n\nThe Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) basket would have brought its owner 3.6% in returns should he or she leave it untouched for the last 90 days.\n\nOptimism (OP), BTCFi coins leading recovery\n\nHowever, some of the worst performers in this ranking are also leading the recovery processes. For instance, in the last seven days, when crypto markets started surging again, the Optimism (OP) ecosystem as well as DeFi coins somehow related to Bitcoin (BTC) managed to register double-digit upsurges.\n\nMeanwhile, some segments, including Solana (SOL) coins, Cosmos (ATOM) coins and native assets of blue-chip DeFis, are lagging behind the recovery of markets.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, cryptocurrency markets started surging amid announcements of ETF filings made by the largest assets management firms. In recent days, BlackRock, Fidelity and Invesco have followed this trend.\n\nRight now, Bitcoin (BTC) is trying to stay above the crucial $30,000 level on major spot trading platforms."

        "title": "AWS Nitro Enclaves for running Ethereum validators \u2013 Part 2 | Amazon Web Services - AWS Blog",
        "content": "In Part 1 of this series, we gave a high-level introduction to an AWS Nitro Enclaves-based Web3Signer blockchain validation and signing service. We explained the purpose of running blockchain validators and also why Nitro Enclaves are well suited to run security sensitive cryptographic workloads.\n\nWe furthermore covered the high-level application architecture and briefly explained the secure bootstrapping and secure signing flow.\n\nIn the walkthrough on GitHub, we gave an end-to-end example of how to deploy and configure a Nitro Enclave-based Web3Signer solution.\n\nIn this post, we dive deep into three areas:\n\nWeb3Signer integration pattern \u2013 How different Ethereum validator nodes can be integrated with a single Web3Signer node\n\nSecure bootstrapping of Web3Signer inside a Nitro Enclave \u2013 How security sensitive configuration files like private keys can be injected into a Nitro Enclave in a secure fashion and how these config artifacts can be used for an HTTPS endpoint\n\nExposing Web3Signer HTTPS API over vsock \u2013 How Transport Layer Security (TLS) traffic can be tunnelled over a vsock connection in a transparent way to establish secure communication with the Web3Signer service running inside a Nitro Enclave\n\nIntegration with Web3Signer for Ethereum validation\n\nTo be able to integrate with Web3Signer, validator clients need to support connection to BLS remote signers (EIP-3030). Popular validator clients such as Lighthouse, Prysm, and Teku already support remote signing. Multiple validator clients can connect to the same Web3Signer instances behind a load balancer. It\u2019s critical that the validator clients not be configured to use the same validator keys, which can result in the validator being slashed. Validator client slashing protection is not effective when multiple validator clients are running simultaneously. For instance, the following diagram shows Validator Client 1 using the validator keys 0xa957cf9 and 0xb821c31 , which means Validator Client 2 can no longer use those two keys. Instead, Validator Client 2 uses the key 0x8f1942c , which isn\u2019t used by any of the validator clients.\n\nIn the accompanying AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) code, Web3Signer isn\u2019t configured to use client authentication. However, for production deployments, Web3Signer should be configured to use client authentication with one of the following methods:\n\nGenerate a certificate for each validator client \u2013 Create a known clients file with the certificates and load it into Web3Signer. This method is operationally complex but revocation is possible because we only need to modify the known clients file in Web3Signer.\n\nCreate a known clients file with the certificates and load it into Web3Signer. This method is operationally complex but revocation is possible because we only need to modify the known clients file in Web3Signer. Configure Web3Signer to allow validator clients with a trusted CA certificate to connect \u2013 This method is operationally easier; however, there is a need to maintain a private certificate authority (CA) server to issue the certificates for each validator client. At the time of writing, the revocation feature is still under development.\n\nFor more information on client authentication, refer to Configure-TLS.\n\nSecure bootstrapping of Web3Signer inside a Nitro Enclave\n\nTo run a Web3Signer service inside a Nitro Enclave in a secure fashion, the following two config artifacts are required:\n\nA TLS key pair to secure the Web3Signer HTTPS API\n\nEIP-2335 specified keystore files, containing encrypted BLS12-381 validator private keys\n\nBoth config artifacts need to be encrypted via a symmetric AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key.\n\nThe KMS key that is being used for the symmetric encryption of the config artifacts needs to have the key policy configured in a way that KMS:decrypt operations, originating from inside the enclave using cryptographic attestation, are being authorized. For additional details how to configure the KMS key policy for this solution, refer to the solution walkthrough on GitHub.\n\nIn this solution, we use two Amazon DynamoDB tables to store the config artifacts: a table for TLSKeys ( TLSKeyTable ) and a separate table for validator keys ( ValidatorKeyTable ).\n\nTLSKeyTable uses the following schema:\n\n{ \"key_id\": \"<>\", \u201ccert_pem\u201d: \"<base64 encloded x509 certificate>\", \u201cencrypted_tls_key_b64\u201d: \"<encrypted private key>\" }\n\nValidatorKeyTable enforces the following schema:\n\n{ \u201cWeb3Signer_uuid\u201d: \u201c<stack uuid>\u201d, \u201cpubkey\u201d: \u201c<public key>\u201d, \u201cactive\u201d: \"<true/false>\", \u201cchain\u201d: \u201c<ethereum network>\u201d, \u201cdatetime\u201d: \u201c<time of creation>\u201d, \u201cdeposit_json_b64\u201d: \u201c<>\u201d, \u201cencrypted_key_password_mnemonic_b64\u201d: \u201c<>\u201d }\n\nAs we pointed out before, to be able to start the bootstrapping process, the TLS key pair and the EIP-2335 keystore file need to be encrypted via the symmetric KMS key and the resulting ciphertexts need to be stored in the DynamoDB table.\n\nBy aligning on the schema definitions, different secure Web3Signer processes can be started, each with a unique TLS key and different (>=1) validator keys associated by just passing a single TLS key_id and array of Web3Signer_uuid keys as parameters for the bootstrap process.\n\nThe following diagram depicts the bootstrapping flow.\n\nThe flow consists of eight steps:\n\nThe nitro-signing-server systemd service the starts watchdog.py process. The watchdog process reads the encrypted Web3Signer config assets (TLS keys, validator keys) from the DynamoDB tables. The watchdog process starts the Web3Signer enclave. As soon as the enclave is up and running, the watchdog process calls the init operation of the enclave by sending the following payload. encrypted_tls_key and encrypted_validator_keys contain the config artifacts downloaded from the DynamoDB tables. credential represents temporary AWS security credentials gathered by the watchdog process. payload = { \"operation\": \"init\", \"credential\": credential, \"encrypted_tls_key\": encrypted_tls_key, \"encrypted_validator_keys\": encrypted_validator_keys, } The enclave_init process running inside the Web3Signer enclave validates the incoming init request, ensuring that all required parameters have been enclosed. If all required parameters are present, kmstool-enclave-cli is used to decrypt the TLS and validator keys that are passed to the Web3Signer enclave. kmstool-enclave-cli establishes a secure outbound connection to AWS KMS via vsock-proxy, using cryptographic attestation to be authorized to decrypt the configuration artifacts. If the KMS:decrypt operation using cryptographic attestation was successful, the decrypted files are converted into the right file format and written to the enclave\u2019s in-memory file system. The enclave_init process starts the Web3Signer process. The Web3Signer process reads the config files, decrypts the encrypted private key in the keystore file, and starts the HTTPS listener on the enclave\u2019s localhost interface. The validator client must have Web3Signer configured as its remote signing solution, for example Lighthouse remote signing, as explained earlier in this post. When configured correctly, the validator client can connect to the Web3Signer HTTPS endpoint exposed via https_proxy . For additional details on how to tunnel HTTPS traffic over a vsock connection, refer to the next section in this post.\n\nDue to the transient nature of the Nitro Enclave\u2019s in-memory file system, the bootstrapping process is run every time the enclave or the parent Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance is stopped and rebooted.\n\nExposing the Web3Signer HTTPS API over vsock\n\nVsock is a local communication channel between an EC2 parent instance and its enclaves. It is the only channel of communication that an enclave can use to interact with external services.\n\nTo establish a secure connection, for example using TLS, with the Nitro Enclave from inside the parent instance or from an AWS Lambda function running in the same Amazon VPC as the EC2 parent instance, it\u2019s required to forward encrypted traffic over the vsock connection.\n\nThe following two sections explain in detail how HTTPS (TLS) inbound and outbound connections can be established using the vsock proxy processes. The numbers are associated with the different states in the following diagram.\n\nThe diagram also depicts the listener/port configuration of all involved components configured during the AWS CDK deployment process.\n\nRepresentations like 16:5000 refer to the vsock listener where the 16 represents the 32-bit Context Identifier (CID) and 5000 specifies the port. A tuple like 0.0.0.0:443 refers to the internet socket listener where 0.0.0.0 refers to an IPv4 address and 443 specifies the port.\n\nHTTPS inbound flow\n\nThe HTTPS inbound flow has the following steps:\n\nIn the given solution, https_prox y acts like a TCP proxy that translates between AF_INET and AF_VSOCK. It accepts incoming internet socket requests from the validator client on 0.0.0.0:443. https_proxy establishes a vsock connection with a separate vsock_proxy process running inside the enclave listening on 16:5000. It then forwards all received TCP packets via this connection. For each incoming vsock connection, vsock_proxy establishes an internet TCP connection with Web3Signer HTTPS API, which listens on 127.0.0.1:9000. Web3Signer responds via the established TCP connection. After receiving the Web3Signer response, vsock_proxy forwards the TCP packets via the established vsock connection to https_proxy running on the parent instance. https_proxy closes the vsock connection and forwards the TCP packages back to the requesting client.\n\nHTTPS outbound flow\n\nOutbound HTTPS connections originating from the kmstool-enclave-cli binary pointing to AWS KMS use a similar mechanism as explained earlier. The steps are as follows:\n\nkmstool-enclave-cli established a vsock connection with the vsock_proxy process running on the EC2 parent instance listening on 3:8000. vsock_proxy establishes a TCP connection with AWS KMS. AWS KMS responds to vsock_proxy via the established TCP connection. vsock_proxy forwards AWS KMS\u2019s response via the open vsock connection to the enclave. kmstool-enclave-cli closes the vsock connection.\n\nWith this mechanism, HTTPS requests can be securely proxied into and out of the enclave.\n\nIt\u2019s important to point out that the X509 certificate used to verify the Web3Signer endpoints needs the hostname of the parent EC2 instance to be set as CN, otherwise the hostname validation will fail.\n\nAdditionally, using this HTTPS tunnel mechanism and having Web3Signer stop the TLS session inside the Nitro Enclave can lead to additional CPU load due to cryptographic operations.\n\nBesides protecting the sensitive configuration payload like validator private keys, required by Web3Signer inside a Nitro Enclave, new potential attack vectors are being introduced by exposing the Web3Signer HTTPS API. Authentication becomes critical because the HTTPS endpoint is being exposed to the private subnet. We already elaborated earlier in this post on the two different authentication options supported by Web3Signer. Also, it\u2019s important to be aware of downstream dependencies used to build Web3Signer, for example, to avoid the exploitation of issues like the Heartbleed OpenSSL bug.\n\nDifferent tools and open-source libraries are available that you can use to tunnel TLS connections over vsock:\n\ntraffic-forwarder.py \u2013 The script used in the AWS Nitro Enclaves Workshop\n\nviproxy \u2013 An open-source Go(lang) library on GitHub\n\nsocat \u2013 a versatile Linux networking utility\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post, we provided in-depth explanation of how to integrate Web3Signer with validator clients. We also dived deep into the secure bootstrapping process and ended with a detailed explanation of how to expose the Web3Signer HTTPS API via vsock.\n\nYou can customize the solution and deploy your own Nitro Enclave-secured validator node on AWS!\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nDavid-Paul Dornseifer is a Blockchain Architect with the AWS Worldwide Specialist Solutions Architect organization.

        "content": "Ethereum price is showing positive signs above $1,770 against the US Dollar. ETH could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $1,820 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum is moving higher above the $1,750 and $1,770 resistance levels.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,770 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a major bullish trend line forming with support near $1,735 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could rise further above the $1,820 and $1,850 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Jumps 4%\n\nEthereum\u2019s price formed a support base above the $1,700 level. ETH started a decent increase after Bitcoin rallied above the $27,000 resistance zone. It broke the $1,720 resistance to move into a positive zone.\n\nThere was a break above the $1,770 resistance zone. It even spiked above $1,800. A high is formed near $1,826 and the price is now consolidating gains. It is still above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $1,715 swing low to the $1,826 high.\n\nEther is now trading above $1,770 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a major bullish trend line forming with support near $1,735 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nImmediate resistance is near the $1,820 level. The next major resistance is near the $1,850 level. A successful move above the $1,820 and $1,850 resistance levels might send the price further higher. The next resistance sits near $1,920, above which Ethereum could rise toward the $2,000 level. Any more gains above the $2,000 resistance zone might send the price toward the $2,120 resistance.\n\nAre Dips Limited in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,820 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,770 level.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,740 level or the recent low. It is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $1,715 swing low to the $1,826 high. If there is a break and close below the $1,740 support, the price could drop toward the $1,700 support. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,650 zone.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is in the overbought zone.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,740\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,820\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently penned an insightful article that delves into the technical challenges associated with enhancing the interoperability between Ethereum Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) solutions. As the adoption of Ethereum's L2s increases, the need for easier cross-layer interactions is becoming more pressing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nButerin's writings outline two major issues. First, as users begin to hold assets across various L2s and L1s, a method is needed for users to change their access keys across multiple accounts without the need for a high number of transactions. Secondly, Buterin notes the need to handle counterfactual addresses; these are addresses not yet registered on-chain, but they need to securely hold funds.\n\nSource: Vitalik Buterin\n\nTo address these issues, Buterin proposes a unique architecture known as asset/keystore separation. Under this model, users would maintain a keystore contract that houses their verification key and the rules for its modification. In addition, wallet contracts on L1 and several L2s would read cross-chain to fetch the verification key.\n\nTwo implementations of this system are proposed. The \"light version\" would necessitate each wallet storing the verification key locally and updating it with a cross-chain proof of the keystore's current state. The \"heavy version\" would require cross-chain proof for each transaction, making keystore updates cheaper but raising per-transaction costs.\n\nButerin identifies five types of proof schemes that could be used, ranging from Merkle proofs to Verkle proofs, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Importantly, he emphasizes the need for cross-chain proofs, which should be highly optimized.\n\nIn the long term, the aggregation of proofs through bundling operations submitted by users can help reduce costs. Additionally, Layer 2 solutions should minimize the latency of reading the Layer 1 state. Wallets can also be placed on systems with lower Ethereum connections, such as Layer 3s or separate chains. However, the keystore should be kept either on Layer 1 or on high-security zero-knowledge rollup Layer 2s.\n\nAccording to Buterin, right now, Ethereum is actively moving toward better cross-chain interactions, asset/keystore separation and a stronger focus on privacy."

        "content": "External - Press Release\n\nBy: Chainwire \u2022 Loading...\n\nExternal PR\n\nSingapore, Singapore, June 21st, 2023, Chainwire\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor Q2 milestone achieved following two months of dedicated work since TestNet launch\n\nSingapore, June 21 2023 \u2014 ARPA Network, a leading decentralized secure computation network, has launched on the Ethereum mainnet. This achievement comes after two months of unwavering dedication following ARPA\u2019s TestNet launch and is a testament to its relentless commitment to innovating cryptographic systems and promoting the versatility, reliability, and interconnectivity of blockchain technology. Now, with the API available on Ethereum's mainnet, developers can effortlessly build decentralized applications (dApps) using the power of ARPA Network including:\n\nRandom Number Generator for projects of lotteries, gaming, or token distributions;\n\nMulti-party computation tools;\n\nDecentralized voting systems;\n\nDecentralized access control tool for shared resources;\n\nDecentralized and privacy-preserving identity management systems;\n\nSignature middleware for secure atomic swap.\n\nThe MainNet launch marks the culmination of ARPA Network's unwavering commitment to fair, secure, and privacy-preserving blockchain ecosystems. Leveraging the achievements and lessons learned during the MPC MainNet era, ARPA Network has made significant strides by transitioning to the sophisticated TSS-BLS network. Through rigorous DevNet testing and the introduction of the feature-rich TestNet, they have showcased their dedication to innovation, leading to today's fully operational MainNet. This achievement not only highlights ARPA Network's technological advancements but also serves as an invitation for a broader ecosystem of stakers and nodes to join ARPA Network on its ongoing journey of evolution and growth.\n\nFurthermore, on June 22rd, ARPA Network will initiate the minting of the remaining 500 million tokens that have been reserved for staking rewards out of its max supply. These tokens will be dedicated to staking rewards and will also serve as a reserve to fuel the ongoing growth of ARPA Network's ecosystem. These ARPA tokens will be released incrementally over time, ensuring a gradual vesting process for stakers, validating nodes, and other ecosystem participants. This strategic move reflects ARPA\u2019s commitment to long-term sustainability and the steady development of the ARPA Network.\n\nARPA Network is now finalizing a 6-month community pool staking program, with plans to allocate 1.5 million tokens as monthly rewards. The primary goal of this program is to enhance community participation, which is critical for further decentralizing ARPA Network. Community members can stake tokens to earn rewards and monitor the network\u2019s performance. As community staking grows, node operator traction will continue to grow, enhancing the security and efficiency of the network and fostering a more prosperous ecosystem.\n\nDevelopers still deciding what to build with ARPA\u2019s secure and scalable TSS-BLS computation network are encouraged to check out ARPA Network\u2019s code on GitHub and join in the upcoming bug bounty. ARPA\u2019s core tech team is also available on Discord to engage and collaborate with fellow developers.\n\n\u201cThe launch of ARPA Network's MainNet on Ethereum marks the initial stride toward realizing an inclusive and interconnected Web 3.0. Our team has been working tirelessly to materialize ARPA's vision of fostering fair, secure, and privacy-preserving blockchain ecosystems. However, this milestone is merely the beginning, and there is much more ground to cover. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to our community for their enduring support as we embark on this thrilling next chapter,\" says ARPA Network CEO Felix Xu.\n\nThough ARPA\u2019s MainNet launch on Ethereum marks a significant milestone, it\u2019s just the beginning for achieving the multi-chain future ARPA envisions. ARPA is actively pursuing integration with other EVM-compatible chains like BNB Chain and exploring the potential of Layer-2 chains.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha?

        "title": "Resolving Ethereum's Scalability Issues: Insights from Mantle's Igneus Terrenus | KrASIA - KrASIA",
        "content": "If you\u2019ve ever performed a transaction on the Ethereum network, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ve paid a significantly high fee, sometimes reaching up to 5 USD for a simple transaction.\n\nThe primary reason behind Ethereum\u2019s high fees is its lack of scalability, as the network can only handle around 15 transactions per second, which is a stark contrast to Visa\u2019s capacity of over 24,000 transactions per second.\n\nWithin the world of Web3, Ethereum is considered Layer-1 infrastructure. Layer-1 in crypto is the foundation of a cryptocurrency network, just like the infrastructure of a city\u2019s transportation system. It sets up the basic rules, security, and structure for how transactions happen, similar to how roads and bridges provide the framework for transportation in a city. To alleviate congestion and reduce fees, scaling solutions known as Layer-2s have been developed on top of Ethereum.\n\nOne notable Layer-2 solution is Mantle, which adopts a unique modular approach to scaling and has prioritized decentralization from the beginning. KrASIA recently spoke with Igneus Terrenus, Head of Communications and Business Development at Mantle, to delve into the network\u2019s architecture and explore the future prospects of Ethereum and Layer-2s.\n\nThe following interview has been edited and consolidated for brevity and clarity.\n\nKrASIA (Kr): How does Mantle\u2019s modular rollup architecture differ from Ethereum and other Layer-2s that are already in the market?\n\nIgneus Terrenus (IT): Our modular approach involves splitting the tasks of the blockchain, such as execution, settlement, consensus, and data availability, among different specialized nodes. Unlike monolithic blockchains like Ethereum, where a single node performs all tasks, modularization brings efficiency gains, lower fees for users, and improved performance for decentralized applications.\n\nOne advantage of modularity is the flexibility it offers in updating our network without causing major disruptions. As such, users on older versions of our system can still participate without any issues. This agility allows us to keep pace with the latest technological advancements. In contrast, upgrades on monolithic blockchains like Ethereum often require a hard fork, making older versions incompatible.\n\nFurthermore, our modularity extends to the data availability layer, which we have separated from other layers. Unlike other Layer-2 solutions that rely on Ethereum for data availability, which can be costly and face scalability challenges, we have partnered with EigenLayer to route data availability through their specialized module. This strategic partnership has led to a substantial reduction in the price of our data availability solution during testnet trials, achieving cost savings of up to 90%. We believe that our transaction fees will be lower compared to these Layer-2 solutions.\n\nKr: As a DAO-led L2 network, how does Mantle showcase the potential of tokenized governance, and what advantages does this governance model offer?\n\nIT: What sets us apart is our unique approach to governance and decentralization. Unlike other chains or projects that develop the product first and then gradually decentralize, we have established a robust decentralized DAO governance system through BitDAO for over a year. We are now integrating Mantle with BitDAO through a rebranding initiative, as we aim to transition the emphasis from BitDAO and investments towards tangible blockchain products.\n\nWe maintain an open governance process that welcomes feedback and embraces challenges. When our initial proposal faced opposition from the community, we actively listened and integrated their suggestions. This level of engagement enables us to assess the true sentiment of our proposals and guides us in shaping our long-term trajectory.\n\nThe public nature of our check and balance system is significant. We openly present all possible paths and actively involve the community in decision-making, creating a more informed, engaged, and decision-oriented community.\n\nKr: What are some notable projects that can be found on Mantle?\n\nIT: While we refrain from picking favorites among the projects we support, we have seen an abundance of games in our ecosystem.\n\nWe recognize that the gaming and social sectors have been overlooked in the past. The high costs associated with conducting transactions directly on the Ethereum blockchain, even on Layer-2 solutions, have made it impractical for these sectors. As a result, many games have opted to operate on sidechains that offer lower fees but come with security concerns, as evidenced by the Ronin bridge hack.\n\nThe strong enthusiasm we receive from gaming projects indicates that we offer a unique solution not provided by other Layer-1 or Layer-2 chains. Our modular approach is well-suited for facilitating high-frequency transactions, a critical aspect of blockchain games.\n\nKr: In your view, what is the significance of fostering a culture of interoperability across the L2 ecosystem?\n\nIT: In terms of Layer-2 solutions, we have been collaborating with companies that implement zero-knowledge technology even before launching our own chain. Our partnerships include working with Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync.\n\nThere is a noticeable difference in how Layer-2s and Layer-1s interact and operate. Layer-1s primarily compete to attract users to their specific chains, resulting in isolated ecosystems. In contrast, we actively engage in ongoing conversations and regular calls with other Layer-2 chains. Since we all build on Ethereum, once all networks are fully operational, there will be a shared liquidity pool, enabling seamless transactions and movement across different chains.\n\nRather than a competitive battle, the relationship between Layer-2 solutions is characterized by friendly competition based on merit, where everyone can learn from one another. While interoperability is still in its early stages, the extensive communication between various Layer-2 solutions indicates a promising future.\n\nKr: Do you have any upcoming partnerships or expansion plans?\n\nIT: We already have established ecosystem partners in the gaming and education sectors, such as Game7 and EduDAO. Nevertheless, we welcome any ideas from both our team and the community via our proposal forum.\n\nWhile our immediate focus is on the successful launch of the Mantle mainnet in early Q3, we believe that combining our Layer-2 chain with Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) \u2014 a token that represents your staked assets like Ethereum \u2014 holds great potential. We already have a dedicated team actively developing LSDs, and we want to take advantage of our modular rollup by swiftly incorporating this latest technological advancement. We have high expectations for both our rollup and LSD, and we are confident that they will be a success."

As this rangebound movement nears a breakout, investors need to be extremely cautious of Bitcoin (BTC) bears, who could flip the plan on its head.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum Layer 2 Optimism beats MATIC to the curb, sees massive spike in active addresses\n\nEthereum price edges closer to a breakout\n\nEthereum price has shown resilience over the past few months as it hovered between the $1,000 and $2,000 psychological levels. During this time, ETH has set up nearly four equal highs and four higher lows.\n\nConnecting these swing points using trend lines reveals an ascending triangle setup. This technical formation forecasts a 45% ascent on the breakout of the horizontal resistance at nearly $2,000. The target of $2,915 is obtained by adding the measured distance to the breakout point.\n\nAs Ethereum price gets squeezed at the triangle\u2019s apex, a volatile breakout is to be expected from ETH holders. The upswing might be prematurely stopped at the $2,439 hurdle, which would amount to a total gain of nearly 28% from the current price at $1,908.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index, which has flipped above the mean line, the Awesome Oscillator and the Wave Trend indicators have remained bearish. Still, the Wave Trend indicator suggests that a bullish crossover could occur soon.\n\nETH/USDT 3-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum price produces a three-day candlestick close below the $1,639 support level, it will create a lower low and invalidate the bullish thesis for ETH. Such a development could see the altcoin revisit the $1,500 psychological level.\n\nIn a worse-case scenario, Ethereum price could slide as low as the $1,368 registered on March 8."

Say hello to Tradecurve: the perfect savior in the current investment landscape. Comparatively, this new project is estimated for higher returns and unparalleled financial stability. Check out more details below.\n\n>>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW<<\n\nBitcoin (BTC) gets support from a Cuban advocate; price predictions suggest the token to reach $31,005.61\n\nErich Garcia Cruz, a Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiast and business person in Cuba, has been vocal about the crypto\u2019s adoption in the country. He suggests private businesses can benefit from implementing Bitcoin (BTC) as a currency.\n\nIn fact, Cruz has been supporting Bitcoin (BTC) adoption since 2020. Cruz will also participate in a documentary where he will explain to Cuban people how they can use Bitcoin (BTC) to get rich.\n\nFurthermore, Cruz addresses Cuba as a communist economy where the country\u2019s communist party will oppose Bitcoin (BTC). However, he believes that Bitcoin (BTC) can bring the country\u2019s independence from the central parties. Currently, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $25,824.28.\n\nSuch a high price can also become an obstacle to its adoption. Moreover, experts predict it to reach $31,005.61 by the year-end.\n\nEthereum (ETH) brings Shapella upgrade to attract lost investors; token reaches $1,681.74\n\nRecently, Ethereum (ETH) brought two new upgrades to re-engage its past investors. One of the upgrades is called Shapella. Ethereum (ETH) developers created Shapella to enable holders to unstake their tokens.\n\nThe idea was to give Ethereum (ETH) holders control over their stakes, hoping to encourage them to re-stake.\n\nThe upgrade came after Ethereum (ETH) suffered continuous withdrawals from users. The upgrade recorded a high Ethereum (ETH) token net inflow. It was also reported that Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) upgrade grew liquid staking tokens/derivatives (LSD).\n\nHowever, the upgrade hasn\u2019t caused any drastic change in Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price. Currently, it is trading at $1,688.08, a 2.99% rise in a day. Experts have predicted Ethereum (ETH) to reach a mere $1,691.96 by the year-end.\n\nUnleash your trading potential with Tradecurve\n\nTradecurve is here to redefine the world of online trading by seamlessly blending the best aspects of centralized and decentralized exchanges into one powerful platform.

        "title": "Crypto Price Today: Bitcoin tops $30,000; Ethereum trades above $1,900; Shiba Inu & Cardano jump up to 9% - Business Today",
        "content": "A majority of the top crypto tokens continued to rise during the early hours on Thursday as the digital token market shrugged off the gloom of the previous week. Investors' confidence was boosted from the Bitcoin ETF applications by BlackRock and other large asset management firms, despite hawkish comments from the US Fed.\n\n\n\nBitcoin extended its gains as the largest crypto token advanced more than 5 per cent to top $30,000 mark. Its largest peer, Ethereum, was also trading higher as it jumped about 6 per cent and reclaimed $1,900 level. Price action in other altcoins was on the higher side.\n\n\n\nIn the last 24 hours, Bitcoin maintained a position above $30,000 mark, registering a 5% increase compared to the previous day. This surge was fueled by investors' enthusiasm following the news of various spot Bitcoin ETF filings, said Edul Patel, Co-founder and CEO at Mudrex\n\n\n\n\"After experiencing a downward trend for a few weeks, BTC reached its highest point since April 2023. Bitcoin continues to showcase a remarkable performance. On the other hand, Ethereum also displayed upward movement, surpassing the $1,900 level and indicating a strong buying momentum. Overall, the market sentiment remains positive,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring the US-dollar-pegged stablecoins, all other top crypto tokens were trading with big gains today. Shiba Inu surged about 9 per cent, while Litecoin, Dogecoin and Cardano gained 7 per cent each. Polygon rose over 6 per cent, while Polkadot was up 5 per cent.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading sharply higher, rising to $1.19 trillion mark as it surged as much as 5 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes rallied about 35 per cent to $59.5 billion.\n\n\n\nEDX Markets, a crypto-platform supported by Schwab and Fidelity, has commenced trading for popular crypto such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. Notably, an institutional non-custodial wallet, meaning it does not hold customer crypto-assets but relies on third-party custodians to ensure the security of customer funds, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\n\n\"This approach eliminates concerns about potential fund misappropriation. The emergence of EDX, backed by prominent firms like Citadel Securities and Fidelity Digital Assets, has the potential to reshape the digital asset landscape, particularly in the face of increased scrutiny of the sector by US regulators,\" he said.\n\n\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\n\n\nStacks (STX) serves as a Bitcoin Layer designed to facilitate the utilization of Bitcoin as an asset and the execution of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain by smart contracts and decentralized applications.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the daily timeframe, the STX/USDT chart has broken out of the descending trendline and has continued on an upward trajectory. The last two days have seen a considerable surge in buying volumes, with the RSI moving into the overbought zone. The next resistance is expected at $0.91 and an immediate support is expected at the $0.68 mark.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "Paradigm released a new Ethereum client called Reth.\n\nReth offers a few surprising benefits over its competitors.\n\nReth contributes to Ethereum\u2019s client diversity efforts.\n\nEthereum client diversity is one of the most important things the Ethereum community has to maintain to keep the network as secure as possible.\n\nThat has become a bit easier because Paradigm just rolled out a new Ethereum client called Reth.\n\nParadigm Releases Reth\n\nParadigm, a research-based investment firm, has released Reth, a new Ethereum client written in Rust.\n\nWe are excited to release Reth v0.1.0-alpha! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\n\n\n\nReth is a modular, contributor-friendly, and blazing-fast Ethereum node, in Rust, using the Apache/MIT license.\n\n\n\nLet's unpack what is behind today's release. pic.twitter.com/WU6794uZte \u2014 Georgios Konstantopoulos (@gakonst) June 20, 2023\n\nThe new client does what any other Ethereum client does: Syncs up with Ethereum and stores transaction data, among other things. Paradigm specified that Reth is an archive node that stores all Ethereum\u2019s blocks.\n\n\u201cReth today is a performant Ethereum archive node implementation and toolkit for building EVM-centric infrastructure. We are excited to continue shipping blazing-fast, well-tested and contributor-friendly code, and contribute to the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s long-term success.\u201d\n\nReth joins a group of already existing Ethereum clients like Geth, Nethermind, and Erigon. However, Reth has a few advantages over all of the mentioned clients.\n\nReth\u2019s Advantages Over Other Ethereum Clients\n\nReth brings a few benefits to the table. For instance, Paradigm claims that Reth is capable of syncing the chain from genesis to the latest block in 50 hours with around 1.92 TB in database size.\n\nFor comparison, the most popular Ethereum clients, Geth and Nethermind, can do a full sync in over a month and use 14.5 TB.\n\nReth currently supports Ethereum-based chains such as Ethereum mainnet, Goerli, Sepolia, and the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s testnets.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nGeth still dominates the Ethereum client space. It\u2019s going to be tough for Reth to win market share.\n\nThough users can already run Reth, it\u2019s currently unaudited software and is still in its early stages.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nEthereum client diversity is very important to ensure the network\u2019s robustness. New clients only add to the diversity node runners can choose from.\n\nRead more about Ethereum Layer-2 TVLs soaring:\n\nEthereum Layer-2 zkSync Era\u2019s TVL Soars Over $500M as Rollup Race Continues\n\nRead more about Binance\u2019s opBNB:\n\nHow opBNB Doubles BNB Smart Chain\u2019s Throughput and Drives Down Costs"

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price is attempting a reach for the $31,000 high after a 12.29% rally this week, analysts speculate a $35,000 target.\n\nEthereum price could reach $1,941 if ETH leverages the BTC rally for a 5% climb to complete the V-shaped recovery.\n\nRipple price eyes the $0.50 target, but a highly bullish case proposes 10% gains to the $.055 range high.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price ended its two-month-long downtrend when it broke above the $30,000 mark on Wednesday before a brief pullback. The uptick has inspired a general boom among cryptocurrencies, with Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices tagging along. Experts have explained the mega rally as a market reaction to spot Bitcoin ETF filings by giant financial institutions like BlackRock and Wisdom Tree.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price breaches $30,000 on Binance, three catalysts power mega rally\n\nBitcoin price gains momentum as $35,000 comes into sight\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is up 22% from mid-June lows around $24,900 and 12.29% this week. The rising momentum comes amid institutional investors showing a growing interest in and recognition of BTC. Moreover, the subsequent filings by two of the biggest institutional investors underscore the increasing recognition of the potential of Bitcoin in traditional finance. These applications acknowledge the industry's demand for regulated investment vehicles and could pave the way for broader adoption.\n\nAfter crossing the $30,000 mark, Bitcoin price is aiming for the range high of $31,000, a reach that could see the flagship crypto reclaim the mid-April highs. A decisive candlestick close above the $31,000 level could clear the path for a 15% rally to analysts' ambitious target of $35,000.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) pointing north shows a rising momentum among buyers. Similarly, the steady rise of the green histograms to the positive zone above the midline shows that bulls are leading the BTC market.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nConversely, the RSI position at 72 shows that BTC is overbought, a situation often preceding a pullback. If this happens, Bitcoin price could repel the $31,000 high akin to what happened on April 14.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin dominance hits two-year high at 51%, jeopardizing altcoin gains\n\nEthereum price could rise 5% if the BTC rally sustains\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is reaping the gains from the BTC rally, recording a daily rise of 5% and a weekly rise of 15%. Based on the ETH/USDT daily chart below, the PoS token is headed north and could reach $1,941 soon in a move constituting a 5% ascent.\n\nThis optimistic outlook is supported by the RSI pointing north, suggesting a rising momentum. Notably, its position at 58 was promising as it indicated there was more room upward for ETH to rise. Also, the AO indicator was soaked in green and edging toward the midline, showing bullish muscle that could soon overpower the bears.\n\nETH/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nOn the flipside, if Bitcoin price shows exhaustion, it could interrupt the ETH rally causing Ethereum price to fall. Such an outcome could see the largest altcoin fall below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).\n\nIn the dire case, Ethereum price could fall below the 100-and 200-day EMA at $1,785 and $1,728, respectively, before a possible leg south to the June 15 low of around $1,650.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Layer 2 Optimism beats MATIC to the curb, sees massive spike in active addresses\n\nRipple price must flip the supply zone into a breaker to reach its target\n\nRipple (XRP) price is trading with a bullish bias, recording 6% gains on the day. Nevertheless, while the broader market enjoys the overflows of the BTC rally, XRP shows indecisiveness, with neither buyers nor sellers acting out. This is because of the dark clouds above presented by the supply zone between $0.528 and $0.520.\n\nA supply zone is a large area of resistance defined by a population of sellers. Notably, XRP bulls keeping their selling appetite in check could transform this seller congestion zone into a breaker block, interpreted as a failed order block (failed supply or demand zone).\n\nRipple price could ascend toward the said zone, bolstered by the call to buy XRP that the RSI was gearing up for, authenticated once the momentum indicator crosses above the signal line (yellow).\n\nXRP/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nHowever, selling pressure from the supply zone could repel Ripple price, causing it to flip the 50-day EMA at 0.487 from support into resistance. In the dire case, XRP could lose the 100- and 200-day EMA supports at $0.469 and $0.452, respectively.\n\nAlso Read: Pro Ripple attorney John Deaton finds legal provision that could have avoided SEC lawsuit"

        "content": "German software giant SAP is using US Dollar Coin (USDC) to test cross-border payments, the company has announced, described by Circle integrated campaigns director Peter Schroeder today as a \u201cbig deal.\u201d\n\nSAP, the largest non-American software company by revenue, announced that the \u201chassle for many small and mid-sized enterprises\u201d of sending money overseas can be solved with \u201cdigital money\u201d\u2014and blockchain technology. And USDC is a stablecoin\u2014a cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset, in this case, the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe company added that customers can now take part in receiving USDC, which runs on Ethereum, as \"play money\" to test out the payment option. The test will run on a separate blockchain, not Ethereum, and doesn't involve real ERC-20 USDC tokens. But if clients do show interest, Ethereum-based crypto adoption would soar, as many major corporations use SAP\u2019s services.\n\nSchroeder added that \u201c99/100 of the world\u2019s largest companies\u201d are SAP customers.\n\n\u201cRather than using traditional payment rails, business partners agree on settling a cross-border transaction with USDC or EUROC, which are tokenized versions of the USD or Euro, manifested in a blockchain,\u201d the announcement read.\n\nCircle CEO Says 'Regulate Us' as Company Hires an Ex-Regulator\n\nIt added: \u201cAre you ready to get into the fascinating world of Digital Money and Decentralized Finance?\u201d\n\nThe experiment will not allow customers to make any payments with USDC, rather just receive some of the cryptocurrency along with an invoice to \u201cexperience how fast, affordable, and reliable cross-border payments will look like,\u201d according to SAP.\n\nUSDC is the fifth largest digital asset, with a market cap of $28.3 billion. In the past 24 hours, over $6 billion in USDC has traded hands on exchanges, according to CoinGecko.\n\nCircle, the fintech firm behind USDC, has been lobbying hard in Washington to sway lawmakers into making clear cut rules for the digital asset space."

        "content": "ETH\u2019s inactive supply surged significantly from 2020 to 2022.\n\nStaked ETH continued to grow despite a considerable drop in yields.\n\nEver since its launch in July 2015, Ethereum [ETH] has scaled new heights of success by redefining the utility of blockchain technology. The major innovation brought about by the second-gen blockchain was the advent of smart contracts, a significant value improvement from its predecessor Bitcoin [BTC].\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nHave the new capabilities improved ETH\u2019s status as a store of value (SoV), considered as the holy grail of any asset class?\n\nETH as a savings option?\n\nCryptocurrency investment firm CoinShares\u2019 latest research threw light on some interesting aspects of ETH\u2019s ownership and distribution across the world. According to the report, despite being primarily used as a medium of exchange (MoE) for transactions on the network currently, ETH\u2019s usage has begun to shift towards a SoV.\n\nAs indicated through the coin age bands below, ETH\u2019s dormant supply increased sharply over the past 4-5 years. The inactive supply, defined as coins that have not been transferred in the previous five years, climbed from 3% in 2020 to more than 10% in 2022. On the other hand, the coins that have moved over the last year dropped steadily in the same period.\n\nInterestingly, this period also included the 2021 bull market during which ETH attained its peak. This implied that investors resisted the urge to cash out their holdings.\n\nMoreover, ETH that was being locked in the staking contract continued to grow despite a considerable drop in yields. This suggested that users were locking up ETH as a savings mechanism.\n\nIt should be noted that the below data was before the launch of the Shapella Upgrade which enabled unstaking. However, staked ETH has increased even more after the upgrade, as seen in one of the earlier articles.\n\nETH retraces losses\n\nETH surged past the $1,900 mark at the time of writing, retracing all losses incurred after SEC\u2019s lawsuit against major crypto trading platforms earlier this month. As the prices rallied, investors became greedy. Whale transaction count i.e., number of transactions transferring ETH worth more than $100,000, shot up dramatically, as per Santiment.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nETH became the buzzword on crypto-focused social channels as a result of the rally.\n\nAccording to social intelligence firm LunarCrush, Ethereum was also one of the top trending cryptos by social engagements."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market recently underwent a considerable crash that led to a period of consolidation. Amidst the turmoil, prices steadied as they awaited a catalyst, which soon emerged in the form of strong buying power entering the market. Historically, periods of market consolidation followed by a surge of buying accumulation around support prices often pave the way for robust uptrends. Why is Ethereum price up? Let\u2019s analyze in this Ethereum price prediction article.\n\nWhy is Ethereum price up Today?\n\nEthereum is experiencing a surge in price due to the consolidation phase that saw a significant accumulation of buying power at support levels. This robust buying pressure is indicative of an increased interest from investors, who have demonstrated confidence in the coin\u2019s potential, leading to a bullish sentiment.\n\nEthereum price analysis: What happened?\n\nEthereum\u2019s price saw a considerable rise of 7% in the past 24 hours, bringing the current price to around $1,865. This boost is a direct reflection of the strong buying pressure that has been growing in recent times.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Where will Ethereum price reach next?\n\nGiven Ethereum\u2019s bullish momentum and the overall uptrend in the crypto market, it is feasible that an Ethereum price prediction could take ETH to the $2,000 mark once again. This prediction, however, hinges on Bitcoin\u2019s price continuing its rise towards the $35,000 range.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

        "content": "Neon EVM announces the launch of its closed beta.\n\nWhat is Neon EVM\n\nNeon EVM is a low-friction solution that enables Ethereum DApps to settle transactions on Solana, eliminating the gap between these two leading blockchains.\n\nNeon EVM positions Ethereum developers to enjoy the best of Solana\u2019s network, from low fees to high transaction speeds and parallel transaction execution capabilities.\n\nWhile Solana is one of the fastest organically-growing chains, its incompatibility with EVM has left several hundred million in TVL, millions of users and an entire ecosystem untouched by EVM multichain DApp developers \u2013 until now.\n\nNeon EVM\u2019s pioneering solution is the anticipated innovation in the Solana ecosystem and makes Solana a viable option for multichain builders.\n\nNeon EVM brings together the best of both chains while ensuring the finality of settlements on Solana.\n\nWhat is Neon EVM closed beta\n\nThe launch of the closed beta version of Neon EVM \u2013 Neon EVM? \u2013 to Solana\u2019s mainnet is a significant milestone on the roadmap.\n\nNeon EVM? is a fully-functioning Neon EVM with one major alteration \u2013 it supports fee-free transactions.\n\nThis means that all transactions are settled to Solana\u2019s layer one and require payment in Sol, as per any Solana-settled transaction.\n\nHowever, in beta, the NEON token is not requested by the proxy operator responsible for accepting the transaction request and ensuring that it is finalized.\n\nWhy launch in beta\n\nThe Neon EVM ecosystem includes many more players than just the Neon EVM and the proxy operators that accept and settle transaction requests.\n\nIt includes DAO, oracles, indexers, wallets, multisigs, bridges, explorers and more.\n\nNeon EVM? provides an opportunity for all parties to deploy and test to ensure the seamless integration of their services before the official Solana mainnet launch.\n\nWhile Neon EVM could have chosen to do a Shadow mainnet launch on a fork of the Solana mainchain, launching directly to mainnet offers significant advantages \u2013 not least of which is that deployed and tested contracts will retain their addresses on Solana mainnet.\n\nWhy launch in \u2018closed\u2019 beta\n\nLaunching in closed beta allows the Neon EVM team to onboard and test the services of ecosystem players in controlled phases.\n\nThe first phase onboarded the infrastructure components, and the second phase accepted DApps and will test the connection of wallets.\n\nOperating in closed beta also controls the budget by keeping the activity limited to an invite-only list. Remember, while the proxy operator is not charging a fee, the Solana network still does.\n\nIt simply is not possible to provide an open beta and predict the cost in Sol for such an initiative \u2013 though it is possible to predict that the Sol cost will be less than the equivalent ETH cost would be for an EVM settling to Ethereum.\n\nWhen the testing period ends and NEON tokens are available on the market to pay for transactions, Neon EVM will switch back to its normal operation mode.\n\nThis means that independent proxy operators \u2013 P2P and Everstake \u2013 will resume responsibility for accepting and processing transactions. The proxy operator\u2019s RPC endpoints will be made available on ChainList.\n\nWant to get involved\n\nWhile Neon EVM is deployed to Solana mainnet at this address, as this is a closed beta, unless you are on the guest list, it won\u2019t accept your transactions yet.\n\nTo engage with the community, you can find us on Twitter, and join Neon EVM\u2019s very active Discord to meet some of our long-term and loyal community builders.\n\nFor a high-level overview of the technical architecture and features of Neon EVM, the whitepaper is available here.\n\nTo follow the activity of the network, you can view Neon EVM transactions settled to Solana with the NeonScan dashboard."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nZora, an NFT minting platform, launched its own Ethereum layer-2 scaling network today after weeks of testing. It\u2019s designed to lower costs and improve the user experience for artists and creators alike.\n\nDubbed Zora Network, it was introduced in May on a mysterious website proclaiming it to be \u201cpure internet. Free and valuable. Resonance and connection. Open and shared. Independence and expansion. For all creation.\u201d\n\nIt is secured by the Ethereum blockchain, built on the tech stack of layer-2 scaling network Optimism, and already supported by more than 35 platforms\u2014including on-chain music platform Sound, wallet provider Rainbow, and Web3 app toolkit Thirdweb.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOver the past six months, we\u2019ve been reaching the upper limit of Ethereum mainnet,\u201d Jacob Horne, CEO and co-founder of Zora, told Decrypt. \u201cWe\u2019ve had 880,000 collectors and millions of NFTs minted, and have found that gas price is a systemic inhibitor to adoption.\u201d\n\nHorne added that this is a pain point for both collectors and creators alike. In fact, many of the NFTs featured on Zora\u2019s scrolling homepage sell for under $10, and may even be free to mint. An Ethereum network gas fee of a few bucks, or potentially much more during peak moments, could significantly raise the overall transaction cost.\n\nit\u2019s always \u201cwen L2\u201d and never \u201cwhen scalable infrastructure for artists\u201d \u2014 jacob (@js_horne) May 30, 2023\n\nZora\u2019s layer-2 network was created with the idea of subsidizing and abstracting away these costs. Horne said that the network makes minting 25 times cheaper compared to Ethereum.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cL2s have been around for a year now\u2014mainnet Optimism has existed, Arbitrum has existed\u2014but have skewed towards DeFi and a financial use case,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the ecosystem and the market is ready for a network that\u2019s purpose-built for art and media, and really leaning into all the interesting experimental things you can do when you have a network like that.\u201d\n\nZora is one of several NFT platforms that have set out to challenge industry incumbents with new features and products.\n\nFounded by three Coinbase alumni in 2020, Zora started out as a service that offered musicians and other artists the means to sell digital tokens tied to physical artifacts such as cassettes. Since then, the startup has pivoted to focus on building an open-source protocol that allows anyone to stand up an NFT marketplace.\n\nIn May 2022, the company raised $50 million in a round led by Haun Ventures that valued it at $600 million. Zora has previously likened itself to a Shopify or WordPress\u2014companies that offer easy-to-use tools for building online stores and websites\u2014but for NFTs and the emerging Web 3 economy. Horne said Zora has had around 130,000 users so far in June.\n\nHorne previously told Decrypt that the company generates revenue via sales of development tools to help companies customize its free protocol for their particular purposes\u2014a model used by the likes of Linux provider RedHat.\n\nTo date, Zora has been the base for a number of high profile NFT drops, including a $4 million sale of the Doge meme NFT, as well as one for the Warhol Foundation. In April, the company put out a print magazine\u2014a publication with a 2,500 item print run\u2014which was redeemable via NFT. At the time, each NFT cost around $150.\n\nMeanwhile, Zora still has the long-term ambition to create a DAO\u2014or an online community with token-based membership\u2014that could one day raise money through the sale of governance tokens."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nNeon EVM, an Ethereum Virtual Machine, allows developers to scale Ethereum dApps through Solana as the settlement layer.\n\nAs a fully Ethereum-compatible environment, Neon EVM is designed to allow Ethereum dApps to take full advantage of the functionality native to Solana, including parallel execution of transactions. This will enable dApps to operate with high transaction speed, low gas fees, and high throughput of Solana.\n\nNotably, Neon EVM provides a unique opportunity to developers who want to unlock access to the liquidity on Solana, enjoy a first-mover advantage, and reach new customers on Solana.\n\nBy choosing Solana, Neon EVM has eliminated the gap between two leading blockchains while ensuring the finality of settlements on Solana. Currently, Solana is one of the fastest organically growing chains. Solana\u2019s incompatibility with EVM has attracted millions of users, with hundreds of millions in TVL. The chain has an entire ecosystem untouched by EVM multichain dApp developers.\n\nNeon EVM is the first EVM on Solana, with an easy Smart contract adaption. In addition to scalability benefits and Solana\u2019s growing ecosystem, Neon EVM also has familiar smart contract languages and Ethereum-based tools like Truffle and MetaMask.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Neon EVM team recently launched a closed beta version, Neon EVM\u03b2 Solana\u2019s mainnet. Despite the working similarity to a fully functioning Neon EVM, Neon EVM\u03b2 supports fee-free transactions. The beta launch was fundamental in allowing all players within the Neon EVM ecosystem to deploy and test Neon EVM\u03b2 to ensure the seamless integration of their services before the official Solana Mainnet launch. Reportedly, launching directly to the Mainnet offers the project many significant advantages, including having the deployed and tested contracts retain their addresses on Solana Mainnet.\n\nThe closed beta launch was done in two phases. In the first phase, the Neon EVM team onboarded the infrastructure components. During the second phase, the team accepted dApps and planned test wallet connections.\n\nNEON, a utility and governance token, will run the Neon EVM ecosystem. NEON will be used to pay for all Neon EVM transactions, including Neon operators. NEON holders can propose and vote on changes to the Neon protocol.\n\nThe project is still under development, with the team planning to roll out Neon DAO, Integration with The Graph, Chainlinl and Pyth, launch grant programs, and much more.\n\nWant to participate?\n\nNeon EVM is currently deployed to the Solana Mainnet at the address NeonVMyRX5GbCrsAHnUwx1nYYoJAtskU1bWUo6JGNyG, however since this is a closed beta, it won\u2019t accept your transactions unless you are on the guest list.\n\nYou can connect with the community by following us on Twitter and joining Neon EVM\u2019s lively Discord to get to know some of our devoted, long-standing community builders. The whitepaper, which provides a high-level description of Neon EVM\u2019s technical design and functionality, may be found at NeonEVM.org/whitepaper.pdf.

        "title": "Starknet moves closer to EVM compatibility with upcoming 'Kakarot' testnet - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Starknet, a zero-knowledge layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, is one step closer to becoming fully Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible, pending an August testnet launch of Kakarot, a new zkEVM.\n\nOn June 3, the Kakarot team announced it had received new backing from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Ledger co-founder Nicholas Bacca and Starkware.\n\nWe have powered up and entered Super Saiyan mode\u26a1. Kakarot Labs has officially been incorporated and closed a pre-seed round with top-tier investors.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s unpack our vision, current standing, and the exciting future ahead. pic.twitter.com/VI8QRdPLfw \u2014 Kakarot zkEVM (@KakarotZkEvm) June 2, 2023\n\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph, Kakarot CEO and co-founder Elias Tazartes explained that while Starknet stands as a leading Zero Knowledge roll-up in the Ethereum ecosystem, it\u2019s not EVM compatible, so there\u2019s \u201ckind of a barrier to entry.\u201d\n\nStarknet is used by developers to scale decentralized applications, transactions and computation on Ethereum but uses its own native language, Cairo. According to Starknet, the use of Cairo makes it easier and faster to develop, review and maintain new code.\n\nThe downside is that it isn\u2019t EVM compatible, which could dissuade some developers.\n\n\u201cThe greatest impact that Kakarot can have is to make Starknet EVM compatible.\u201d\n\n\u201cKakarot right now is like a Solidity or any language engine. Eventually you will be able to put that engine within Starknet to make it EVM compatible.\u201d\n\nAt present, Starknet runs its own custom smart contract Virtual Machine, dubbed \u201cCairo VM,\u201d which leverages Cairo. This means that Starknet doesn\u2019t have direct EVM compatibility out of the box, something that could prove to be a significant hurdle for overall rollup adoption.\n\nKakarot co-founder Elias Tazartes.\n\n\u201cSome teams really need to be able to use Solidity. For example, if someone wrote a DEX or an AMM for the Ethereum ecosystem and now has 60,000 lines of code already audited, ready to go, but it\u2019s only on EVM chains.\u201d\n\nIf these developers wanted to start using Starknet, they would have to hire a whole new dev team, write in, audit the code again and maintain two code bases \u2014 which Tazartes describes as \u201cprohibitively expensive.\u201d\n\n\"We believe in \u2018coding pluralism\u2019 \u2014 giving devs as many ways to use it as they welcome. That\u2019s why our exploration team encouraged Kakarot through its building and why we invested in it,\" said Starkware CEO and co-founder Uri Kolodny.\n\nRelated: More TPS, less gas: Ethereum L2 Starknet outlines performance upgrades\n\nAccording to Tazartes, the idea for the zkEVM was first floated during a Starkware conference in July 2022. By October, the development team was able to together for a week during a hacker house event in Lisbon, Portugal, to get cracking on the new zkEVM.\n\nTwo months and 20 days later, in December, the coding for the project was complete, ready to create a fully functional execution layer \u2014 all of which was achieved without any venture funding.\n\nNotably, Tazartes said that Buteirn later invested in Kakarot due to his enthusiasm over a multiple-zkEVM approach to building out the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n\u201cFor Vitalik, the more zkEVMs the better, because as long as you have a wide diversity of architecture and diversity of approaches\u2026then this is really good for the space as a whole.\u201d\n\nTazartes shared that the testnet version of Kakarot will be launched for public use this August.\n\nMagazine: Tornado Cash 2.0 \u2014 The race to build safe and legal coin mixers"

        "title": "Beyond Ethereum: 5 Rising Cryptos That Could Outperform ETH in 2023 - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Ethereum has been among the most popular cryptocurrencies for years with patrons spread across the world. Be it developers or cryptocurrency users, Ethereum has been able to drive impact for varied user groups both as a cryptocurrency and as a technology. Today, it powers blockchain networks, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs. It hit the headlines last year with its decision to switch to the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm from proof-of-work protocol in a massive software upgrade that lasted for months and was called \u2018The Merge\u2019.\n\nHowever, as changing times call for new additions to portfolios, crypto users are now on the lookout for new altcoins which can not only boost their gains but also diversify their portfolios. One of the top favorites currently is InQubeta (QUBE). It\u2019s built on Ethereum and helps startups working with artificial intelligence look for genuine investment opportunities.\n\nNot only startups, but even potential investors have a lot to gain with InQubeta as it helps them access future-ready opportunities that one cannot easily find in the market. Plus, by leveraging pioneering technology like AI, these startups\u2019 projects are an ideal way to become a part of the AI revolution. The following list features four more crypto projects that leverage the power of blockchain technology to offer their users utility-dense assets.\n\n1. InQubeta: Leveraging blockchain for an AI-led startup revolution\n\nInQubeta has been blazing a trail by combining the scope of decentralized finance with AI to create a next-generation platform where both investors and startups seeking funding can access authentic opportunities. What analysts are considering its key USP is that it addresses a structural problem that has been ailing the startup industry for a long time. In the past, many startups have been unable to scale due to paucity of funds. InQubeta has been launched to fix that and empower budding companies to bring their ideas to life.\n\nWhat\u2019s boosting the public\u2019s confidence in the platform is its robust security framework and smart contracts that have been vetted by leading security firms like Block Audit and Hacken.\n\nFor facilitating transactional purposes, the InQubeta team has rolled out a native token that\u2019s called QUBE and it\u2019s built on Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 protocol. The native token is a functional yet versatile asset that you can own by participating in its presale process\n\n\n\nThe latest ico has been divided into nine stages, where the prices will be rising progressively with every phase. The presale is currently in its first stage and the token has already raised over $500,000 in presale funding. That\u2019s quite an achievement for a cryptocurrency ico. Users who buy the tokens will have a lock-in period of 12 weeks and they will be able to access them only after the vestige period ends.\n\nThe QUBE token is deflationary, which means that it has an anti-inflationary mechanism that can prevent market volatility from hampering the token value. Under a deflationary token, the coin supply is adjusted to ensure that it\u2019s always within a certain limit. As the token stock is limited, its price doesn\u2019t fluctuate a lot. To control the supply, all extra QUBE tokens in circulation are destroyed by sending them to a \u2018burn wallet\u2019.\n\nIf a QUBE token holder plans on selling the token, they will have to pay a \u2018sell tax\u2019. While most of the sale proceeds go towards funding marketing campaigns and maintaining the liquidity and rewards pools, a portion of the tokens collected as tax proceeds is also sent to the burn wallet for adjusting the coin supply.\n\nTo get started on InQubeta, startups have to decide on what they\u2019d like to offer a potential investor in exchange for pumping funds into their project. The reward could be an equity share in the company or another reward level. The reward will be represented as an NFT and will be put up on InQubeta\u2019s NFT marketplace where investors will be able to evaluate them.\n\nAnother notable feature of the NFT marketplace is that these digital assets can be fractionalized so that one can buy fractions of the asset. This enables investors to invest in a project even if they are on a budget. If they agree with the terms offered by the startup, they can pay for the NFT using QUBE tokens, and the proceeds are then transferred to the startup. Head over to the presale to get a chance to buy this upcoming innovative cryptocurrency that could potentially provide huge returns in the long term.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\n2. DigiToads: Gaining with a hybrid DeFi model\n\nDigiToads is a multi-purpose meme coin that is built on the Ethereum network. What makes it a good crypto to buy is its hybrid DeFi model that has been designed by merging three cryptocurrencies \u2013 a meme coin, a play-to-earn platform, and a staking portal. Its native token is TOADS and it\u2019s the medium of exchange on the network. DigiToads brings you the ease of accessing multiple options to earn passive income on a single platform. So, you can stake assets, trade tokens, win crypto tokens in Web 3.0 games, and participate in trading competitions.\n\nIts play-to-earn game entails players competing with each other to become one of the top 25% of the scorers of a season and win TOADS tokens. The game seasons are also short \u2013 just a month long. So, one gets multiple chances to play. The participants have to tackle various challenges in a Metaverse swamp. For help, they can buy or trade a special species of virtual creatures called DigToads. These creatures have immense strength and a set of unique traits.\n\nEach DigiToad will have a different set of special characteristics and there is no way of finding out if your competitor\u2019s DigiToad has any advantage over yours. To counter this advantage, you can purchase training equipment, food, or potions for your DigiToads.\n\nBy choosing to buy the TOADS token, you can acquire a digital asset where you will be able to contribute to its growth. DigiToads\u2019 governance structure is based on the decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) model where community members can move proposals that seek important changes in the code architecture. However, to be implemented, these proposals should first be approved by the voting community members. All TOADS token holders get voting rights that they can use to express their opinions about a proposed change.\n\nBuy DigiToads Now\n\n3. Tenet: Amping up the potential of liquidity pools\n\nTenet is a multi-chain automated market maker and connector that equips crypto tokens with a decentralized liquidity tap. A liquidity tap is a growth driver for a liquidity pool. It employs an algorithm that offers the liquidity provider more lucrative and transparent incentives. The platform has been designed as a cross-chain protocol toolkit that allows the demand side to tweak the parameters of a liquidity tap while reaching out to more participants. Its native token is TEN and it\u2019s used for all transactional use cases on the network.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, is that TEN token holders can also earn with yield farming on the Tenet network. It serves as a more convenient mining platform that ensures a transparent allocation of farming rewards. To ensure fair allocation of rewards during yield farming, Tenet optimizes algorithms of LP token polls and initial mining incentives.\n\n4. Polygon: Making scaling on Ethereum fuss-free\n\nPolygon is among the top crypto coins built on the Ethereum network and the network enables developers to add more utility to Etherum-friendly tools, virtual machines, and dApps. Its native token MATIC is one of the most-traded crypto tokens on DeFi exchanges. Polygon\u2019s suite of tools comprises optimistic rollup blockchains, zK chains, standalone blockchains, and many other kinds of DeFi infra that developers usually need while scaling a decentralized service.\n\nWhat\u2019s unique about the Layer 2 scaling solution is that it amalgamates the Plasma framework and the proof-of-stake consensus protocol to pave the way for the seamless execution of smart contracts.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\n5. Cosmos: An interconnected ecosystem of dApps\n\nCosmos is among the leading ERC-20 tokens that have emerged as a top crypto to invest in with their multi-functional and flexible code architecture. It has been designed as an ecosystem of sovereign dApps and decentralized services that are interoperable and can be adopted by the masses. Its native token is ATOM and it\u2019s the main cryptocurrency on the network. It strives to demystify blockchain technology and make building dApps less complex for developers with its modular framework. Being interoperable, Cosmos paves the way for seamless communication between DeFi tools and hence, solves problems like fragmentation.\n\nCosmos\u2019 architecture comprises three layers. The first is the application layer where all transactions are processed. The layer also updates the state of the network. The second one is the networking layer that facilitates communication and transfer of data and assets between chains. The third layer is the consensus later where nodes agree to work on the system\u2019s current state.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nConclusion\n\nOnce you are well-versed with the features and potential of the above-mentioned cryptocurrencies, chances are you won\u2019t have to worry about deciding which crypto to buy today for the long term. Coming with cutting-edge features and with hard-to-ignore economic opportunities, these cryptocurrencies are capable of triggering a wave of financial inclusion.\n\nWhile these crypto tokens have their strengths, for many crypto analysts InQubeta is the leader of the pack because of its higher growth potential. With an industry-specific use case, InQubeta is being seen as a growth driver for not just the startup industry but for innovation-centric projects in the decentralized finance ecosystem.\n\nIts user-friendly interface and modern-day features are among other reasons why analysts are calling it a top crypto to invest in 2023. Over the next coming months, market experts feel that the QUBE token is likely to perform well and has the potential to grow by 30x.\n\nGiven how cryptocurrencies are a dynamic asset category, it\u2019s always advisable for crypto buyers to research a token before purchasing it. By exploring a token before the purchase, a buyer can acquaint themselves with the potential risks associated with cryptocurrencies and make well-informed decisions.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ethereum CFD Trading: How to Trade Ethereum CFDs - Admiral Markets",
        "content": "How much do you know about Ethereum trading, specifically, Ethereum CFD trading?\n\nCryptocurrencies are on the rise. Ether (ETH) is one of the most popular offerings and is known as the 'original alt coin'.\n\nAs of 2023, cryptocurrencies are slowly becoming more mainstream and finding their place in the world of finance. Ethereum, given its popularity and ranking, remains a hot topic amongst the crypto community as the technology progresses.\n\nHow to trade Ethereum CFDs? We cover this topic along with other details around Ethereum, Ethereum trading at Admirals and more.\n\nEthereum CFD Trading: How Volatile is Ethereum?\n\nFirst of all, we need to know that cryptocurrency markets are much more illiquid than equity markets, meaning that larger market players can cause larger movements.\n\n'Smart' money usually buys lower and places sell orders when the price is peaking. Thus, traders should avoid buying high. Ethereum is subject to a much wider range of price fluctuations relative to the currency (Forex) market.\n\nGenerally speaking, investors have been pouring capital into the market, betting that consumer demand will propel future growth.\n\nAt this point, all the cryptocurrencies, including the ETH vs USD CFD, are subject to significant speculation, and backed by very little historical data, which makes this asset class very volatile.\n\nIf you want to trade Ether CFDs and other cryptos, you need to get acclimated to volatility. For that reason, you might want to download the demo platform first.\n\nYou should also familiarise yourself with volatility protection settings, which can help you to minimise the volatility risk when trading.\n\nFree Trading Webinars From Admirals\n\nTo always stay up-to-date with cryptocurrency prices, as well as possible movements, and trading opportunities, Admiralsoffers free live webinars hosted by leading professional traders and analysts.

Traders can access the ETH/USD CFD and other crypto pairs using MT4, MT5, and the MTSE plugin.\n\nThe process is simple and as follows:\n\nDownload/open the MetaTrader platform Register a new account or log in; Open up the cryptocurrency chart (ETH/USD)\n\nAlso, all of the additional add-ons for the MetaTrader Supreme Edition are now also available for the latest version of MetaTrader 5 Supreme Edition.\n\nCurrent vs Historical Price: Trending or Ranging?\n\nSource: Admirals, MetaTrader 4, ETH/USD daily chart (from July 2018 to March 2019). Accessed: 12 March 2019. Please Note: Past performance does not indicate future results, nor is it a reliable indicator of future performance.\n\nThe chart above shows the performance of Ether over an eight-month stretch between the summer of 2018 through to spring 2019. The thick red line is a 150-day simple moving average, an indicator that smooths out price fluctuations in order to make it easier to discern the overall trend.\n\nYou can see that there has been a clear downward direction to the price action over this period and the moving average has a negative gradient. Furthermore, the price of Ether has been depressed below this long-term moving average for nearly the whole time shown in the chart. Such an occurrence is often considered by traders to be bearish in nature.\n\nNotice that there is a brief spike above the moving average in late February 2019, but this has not resulted in any reversal in the trend. There are, however, signs of stabilisation if we focus on the price performance since late 2018, which you should be able to see in the four-hour chart below:\n\nSource: Admirals, MetaTrader 4, ETH/USD H4 chart (from November 2018 to March 2019). Accessed: 12 March 2019. Please Note: Past performance does not indicate future results, nor is it a reliable indicator of future performance.\n\nOver this time-frame, the Ether market has demonstrated range-bound characteristics. On 19 November 2018, the price sunk below 160.00, a price level that is marked on the chart with a blue dotted line. With the exception of the brief spike up in February, the price of Ether has remained depressed below that level since then through to the time of writing. Notice how the price pushed up in late December and early January but failed to break above this resistance level.\n\nSupport levels are also marked on the chart with blue dotted lines. One support level is at 100.00. The price rebounded a couple of times in November close to this level. It did then sink below this level for the first half of December, falling to the second support level at 80.55. Since then, though, price has remained bounded above 100.00.\n\nWith the help of the award-winning MetaTrader Supreme Edition plugin (MTSE) for MetaTrader 4 (MT4) and MetaTrader 5 (MT5), traders can trade with the ETH/USD CFD volatility - Click the banner below to download the MetaTrader 5 platform for free with Admirals:\n\nThe World's Premier Multi Asset Platform\n\nDOWNLOAD MT5 FREE\n\nEthereum CFD Trading: Potential Strategies\n\nTechnical trading and proven tools should be applied when trading Ether, which in turn could be the basis for trading the Ether vs Dollar CFD profitably.\n\nDue to its volatility, scalping strategies could be applied if trading intraday. Those who wish to swing-trade ETH/USD need to be prepared for a bit of unstable price action, where steady profits might turn into losses within a split second.\n\nA \"flash crash\" occurred on June 21 2017, when the price dropped from around $320 to 10 cents. It recovered thereafter, but investors and traders definitely took a hit in that period.\n\nMr Adam White, Vice President of GDAX, explained that an investor placed a multi-million dollar Ether \"sell\" order at 12:30 p.m. on a Wednesday. The order size caused the currency price (which was already volatile), to dip.\n\nAs we know, as the price grabs stop loss orders it creates additional momentum, and potentially huge movement in minutes or even seconds. Every close of a buy position is an automatic sell into the market and vice versa.\n\nHow to Day-Trade Ether\n\nOpen your ETH/USD chart. This is how you add indicators to the MetaTrader 4 platform:\n\nSource: MetaTrader 4 - ETH/USD chart - How to add indicators to an MT4 chart - Platform Time: Julne 19, 12:15PM\n\nNow, we will use a scalping strategy that combines the following indicators:\n\nSource: MetaTrader 4 - ETH/USD chart - Data Range: 16 July, 2022 - 19 July, 2022 - Platform Time: July 19, 11:55AM\n\nEnter a long position once the fast black 4 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) has crossed up through the middle Bollinger Band (14 EMA (red)). At the same time, the 'Chaos' and 'Momentum' should be crossing their zero lines, going up. Potential entry zones are shown as red arrows.\n\nSource: MetaTrader 4 - ETH/USD Chart - Data Range: 16 July, 2017 - 18 July, 2017\n\nExit position or TP: Your exit position is executed when the 'Chaos Awesome Oscillator' changes its colour (mostly for high-frequency scalping purposes) or at the Admiral Pivot point. A stop-loss is placed below the recent swing-low.\n\nTrading the Ethereum CFD\n\nProper money management is the holy grail of trading and, if applied correctly in a strong trending environment, it should theoretically make an enormous return of investment (ROI). Due to huge volatility, losses might occur as well, so it is extremely important to use proper money management. Market stability could be reached when the power shifts from investors seeking to profit from price fluctuations, to consumers actually using cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhen that happens, volatility should stabilise. Traders should treat crypto trading the same way they would treat any investment in the early start-up stage. Also, intraday traders should definitely be focused on major trading sessions, as major trading centres provide the highest volatility in ETH/USD. Fortunately enough, the MetaTrader 4 (MT4) platform offers the instrument during major market sessions \u2013 24/5.\n\nMarket Sentiment \u2013 Impact on the Hype in the Media\n\nBack in 2017, Ether was very hot. The diagram below shows just how positive the sentiment towards Ether was back then.\n\nSource: Bitcoin Cash - Q1 2017 Coindesk\n\nNaturally, some of that sentiment has cooled off alongside the decline in the value of the ETH/USD CFD crypto pair since the heady highs of 2017. It is a general truism, however, that sentiment will decline for any previously-frothy market that has suffered a severe correction in value.\n\nThe question with cryptocurrencies and Ether still remains, however, which way will they go? There remain investors that believe that crypto prices will recover. One factor in Ether's favour is the potential of the Ethereum platform and in 2019 we have begun to see signs of institutional adoption of the technology.\n\nBanking giant JP Morgan made headlines in early 2019 when it rolled out its JPM coin, which was touted as the first cryptocurrency backed by a US bank. While many news outlets acknowledged that this new digital token utilises blockchain technology, what many failed to mention was that JPM's proprietary Qurom blackchain is actually an enterprise-level version of Ethereum. Where this will all actually lead to is far from clear, of course, but this kind of concrete example of a real-world use of Ethereum's technology could serve to rekindle confidence in Ether.\n\nThat said, we should stress that the vast majority of cryptocurrency trading, including that of Ether, is pure speculation, and the current utility value to users is close to zero. Not many people use blockchain protocols, as opposed to many people who trade cryptocurrencies. We might also see regulations coming in terms of exchanging, issuing, and holding new coins.\n\nTrading ETH and Other Cryptocurrency CFDs\n\nIn addition to trading CFDs in ETH/USD, Admirals also offers the ability to trade CFDs with ETH/EUR and ETH/BTC.\n\nTo trade these pairs, traders simply need to download the software platform (MetaTrader 4 or MetaTrader 5), which grants access to the market and/or the ability to monitor price action on a chart.\n\nIf you'd like to get started, click the banner below to open a live account and start trading cryptocurrency CFDs today:\n\nTrade CFDs on digital currencies Trade 30+ top digital currency pairs with Admirals TRADE NOW\n\nAbout Admirals\n\nAdmirals is a multi-award winning, globally regulated Forex and CFD broker, offering trading on over 8,000 financial instruments via the world's most popular trading platforms: MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5.

        "title": "Polygon to Transition PoS Chain to zkEVM Validium: Here's How It Works - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Polygon announced that it would transform Polygon PoS into Polygon zkEVM validium.\n\nPolygon zkEVM validium will have numerous benefits that Polygon PoS didn\u2019t have.\n\nPolygon PoS validators will play an unexpected role in Polygon zkEVM validium.\n\nChanging how a blockchain works from the ground up is incredibly tough. For example, Ethereum developers worked for multiple years to move the blockchain from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake.\n\nSimilarly, Polygon has just announced that it is transforming its Proof-of-Stake blockchain to a zkEVM validium. Here\u2019s how it works.\n\nPolygon to Transition PoS Chain to zkEVM Validium\n\nPolygon, the Ethereum Layer-2 powerhouse, is going to carry out a major upgrade to its existing Proof-of-Stake chain.\n\nThe development team behind the project revealed on Tuesday that the PoS chain, one of the most popular blockchains, is going to be transformed into a zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) validium.\n\n1/ Today a proposal was published to upgrade Polygon PoS to a zkEVM validium, a first-of-its-kind, decentralized ZK Layer 2.\n\n\n\nAs a zkEVM validium, Polygon PoS would inherit Ethereum's unmatched security, while preserving low fees & high scalability.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://t.co/5fsMOqLqRy pic.twitter.com/9r9VILxdvu \u2014 Polygon (Labs) (@0xPolygonLabs) June 20, 2023\n\nPolygon said that the main motivation to transform the PoS chain was the goal to integrate zero-knowledge technology into it since Polygon 2.0, announced last week, revealed that ZK will power all Polygon chains.\n\nHow Polygon zkEVM Validium Works\n\nPolygon zkEVM validium is the first of its kind. In essence, Polygon zkEVM validium can be thought of as a \u201csibling\u201d to the Polygon zkEVM rollup.\n\nThe only difference between, say, a zk-rollup like Polygon zkEVM and Polygon zkEVM validium, is that the latter posts transaction data off-chain rather than to Ethereum.\n\nHow Polygon zkEVM validium works. Source: polygon.technology.\n\nThis, in turn, presents multiple benefits, including lower fees because posting transaction data to Ethereum is cheaper and a higher throughput because Polygon zkEVM validium is not bounded to Ethereum.\n\nAs for tradeoffs, Polygon zkEVM validium will use Polygon PoS\u2019s 100+ validators as the data availability layer. Polygon PoS\u2019s validators will also be the entities deciding which transactions to include in a block and in which order.\n\nAs for users and developers, Polygon said that the transition to Polygon zkEVM validium would have little to no impact on their daily experience of using Polygon. MATIC tokenomics will also not change.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nRollups are considered more secure than validiums because they rely on data availability on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why users should use Polygon zkEVM validium instead of Polygon zkEVM and whether those two chains are going to joined together.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nPolygon zkEVM validium is another step towards greater adoption of crypto technology. For Polygon and the Ethereum community, the new design of the Polygon PoS chain is another milestone in the journey towards scaling Ethereum.\n\nRead more about Ethereum layer 2 TVLs soaring:\n\nEthereum Layer-2 zkSync Era\u2019s TVL Soars Over $500M as Rollup Race Continues\n\nRead more about Binance\u2019s opBNB:\n\nHow opBNB Doubles BNB Smart Chain\u2019s Throughput and Drives Down Costs"

        "content": "DISCLAIMER: This article is a SPONSORED Press Release and does not constitute Finbold's editorial content nor undergo monitoring. Crypto assets/products involve significant risks. Do not invest unless you are prepared to lose your entire investment. For a full disclaimer, please click here.\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) may sound like something out of a new kids Pixar film, but it\u2019s a clever and proven innovation in any aspiring projects\u2019 armor. Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and the rising star, Caged Beasts, have harnessed the power of NFTs to propel adoption and reshape the crypto landscape.\n\nThrough their respective NFT initiatives, Ethereum, BNB, and Caged Beasts (BEASTS) have expanded the boundaries of digital ownership and driven adoption within the crypto market. This article will discuss those projects and the boundaries they have pushed for the good of digital finance.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Staying At a BNB\n\nThere is no doubt about the prevalence of Ethereum\u2019s effect on the industry since its foundation in 2015. However, it has also been instrumental in propelling the NFT wing of crypto to the skies. In short, Ethereum has become the go-to platform for creating, buying, and selling NFTs. Its versatility has attracted artists, collectors, and investors, offering a range of features and functionalities to support this digital asset class.\n\nBNB, the native cryptocurrency of the Binance exchange, has also made significant strides in the NFT space. BNB\u2019s integration with Binance Smart Chain (BSC) has provided a very successful platform for its investors and partners. Through these partnerships and collaborations, BNB has facilitated the creation and trading of NFTs, expanding the reach of these digital assets to a broader audience.\n\nThe blockchain platform developed by Binance offers a cost-effective and efficient environment for NFT creation and trading. With lower transaction fees and faster confirmation times than Ethereum, BNB provides a compelling alternative for NFT enthusiasts looking to maximise their returns.\n\nThe Rise Of The Caged Beasts Cometh\n\nAmidst the NFT frenzy, Caged Beasts has emerged as a captivating and innovative crypto project. Led by the enigmatic Dr Rabbit Hyde, also known as \u201cRabbit 4001,\u201d Caged Beasts introduces a unique concept centred around beastly mutagens and caged creatures.

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has recently shared a groundbreaking vision for Ethereum\u2019s future, highlighting innovative approaches to wallet securities, interoperability between Layer 1 and Layer 2, and privacy.\n\nDeeper dive on L2->L1 and cross-L2 reading. Much more technical than the previous post, but gets into some ideas on how it could be implemented.\n\n\n\nThere's a lot of value in identifying better strategies for L1 <-> L2 interactions and standardizing them.https://t.co/oGUlHqiU0E \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) June 20, 2023\n\nIn March, Vitalik proposed the utilization of multisig wallets, specifically social recovery wallets, as a reliable and user-friendly solution to enhance fund security. The proposed workflow for cross-chain social recovery wallets revolves around a central keystore location and multiple wallets in different locations. Wallets can update their local view of the verification key by reading the keystore during the transaction verification process.\n\nTo enable this functionality, Buterin emphasizes the need for cross-chain proofs, suggesting options such as ZK-SNARKs, Verkle proofs, or a custom-built KZG solution for optimal performance.\n\nIn the long term, Buterin suggests integrating aggregation protocols into the ERC-4337 ecosystem to minimize costs.\n\nThese protocols would generate aggregate proofs while bundling UserOperations submitted by users. To reduce latency, Buterin advises optimizing Layer 2 solutions to allow direct reading of Layer 1 state or state root. By doing so, proof space can be saved, enhancing the overall efficiency of the Ethereum network.\n\nButerin envisions wallets not only on Layer 2 solutions but also on systems with lower levels of connection to Ethereum, such as L3s or separate chains that synchronize state roots and align with Ethereum\u2019s reorganizations and hard forks.\n\nHowever, he emphasizes the importance of placing keystores either on Layer 1 or on high-security ZK-rollup Layer 2 solutions, with Layer 1 offering simplicity and potential cost advantages.\n\nWhile prioritizing privacy preservation may introduce additional challenges, Buterin encourages the Ethereum community to move towards privacy-preserving solutions and ensure that any proposed developments are forward-compatible with maintaining privacy.\n\nWith these visionary proposals, Buterin aims to propel Ethereum\u2019s evolution by addressing crucial aspects of security, scalability, privacy, and interoperability.\n\nAs Ethereum continues to innovate and adapt, these advancements hold the potential to revolutionize various industries and solidify Ethereum\u2019s position as a leading blockchain platform."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency platform Luno has launched ethereum staking, a way for its customers passively to earn ether, the token associated with the ethereum blockchain.\n\nLuno country manager Christo de Wit said Luno\u2019s staking feature will initially be launched in South Africa with support for ether. Customers open a staking wallet and can earn up to 4%/year in ether tokens by holding their coins.\n\n\u201cThe reward rate can fluctuate depending on the demand on the network as well as the number of active validators. Rewards will be paid weekly, so you can automatically grow your stake and compound your rewards.\u201d\n\nWhile they are staked, customers cannot sell or send their coins elsewhere, but they can \u201cunstake\u201d at any time and remove their coins from their staking wallets. There are no minimum deposits.\n\nWhat is staking?\n\nCryptocurrencies that allow staking use a \u201cconsensus mechanism\u201d called proof-of-stake to securely verify transactions. \u201cYour stake is used to ensure that transactions are not fraudulent \u2013 with penalties if you validate incorrect transactions and rewards when you validate correct transactions,\u201d Luno said.\n\nStaking removes the need for crypto miners to churn through mathematical problems for verification. Instead, transactions are validated by those who stake their tokens.\n\nStaking is also a way to support the long-term health of the ethereum ecosystem, contributing to the security and efficiency of blockchain projects.\n\nApril\u2019s eagerly anticipated Shanghai update concluded the ethereum blockchain\u2019s migration to a full proof-of-stake consensus mechanism by allowing users to unstake their crypto and retrieve rewards for the first time.\n\nEthereum offers an annual percentage yield of up to 4%, though this may vary depending on network conditions.\n\nThere are no minimum deposit or withdrawal amounts. Luno doesn\u2019t charge a fee to stake or unstake a user\u2019s cryptocurrency, but there is a staking service fee that is deducted from the reward customers receive.\n\nLuno said it is partnering with a specialist that operates validation nodes in all the main proof-of-stake networks to enable staking for its customers.\n\nThere are two main risks involved. Firstly, one of the specific requirements in staking is that validators (the people or companies responsible for operating the nodes that verify transactions) must have their computers constantly running for the network to run smoothly, so if there are connectivity issues this could attract penalties.\n\nSecondly, while rewards are earned for validating good transactions, there is a penalty if bad transactions are approved. This is known as \u201cslashing\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur partners have stringent mechanisms in place that mean slashing is incredibly rare. In such an unlikely event, our staking provider will review and remediate slashing penalties where reasonable,\u201d Luno said. \u2013 \u00a9 2023 NewsCentral Media"

        "content": "Blockchain technology is sometimes talked about in a speculative, money-making context in association with digital assets (such as cryptocurrencies) and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). However, the real value of blockchain lies in its potential to create systems in which information and power are not concentrated in one place, like banks, governments, and large corporations. With blockchain, we can build alternative, secure systems that are neither controlled or dependent on such centralized entities, systems that are owned and governed by their participants.\n\nConceived of in 2013, the general-purpose blockchain platform, Ethereum, made the world aware of the potential of this decentralized technology in the form of smart contracts. One of Ethereum\u2019s defining characteristics is that it is open-source software and its development is undertaken by a community. An organization that has played a key role in coordinating the community is the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organization.\n\nAmong the leaders of the Ethereum Foundation is its Executive Director, Aya Miyaguchi. Formerly a high school teacher in Japan, Miyaguchi joined the Foundation after moving to the United States and meeting Ethereum\u2019s founder Vitalik Buterin who was 19 years old at the time.\n\nWhat was the potential Miyaguchi saw in Ethereum? And what does she and the Foundation hope to achieve in the future when decentralized systems are widely adopted?"

The proposal seeks to upgrade the PoS chain to a zkEVM Validium. Polygon, whose zk rollup went live earlier this year, would still be compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine as per the latest proposal.\n\nMATIC Would Remain Polygon\u2019s Native Staking Token\n\nAccording to the pre-Polygon Improvement Proposal (PIP) discussion started by Mihailo Bjelic on the network\u2019s governance forum, the proposed upgrade to a zkEVM validium would address the network\u2019s current problems including the security issues, its reliance on Cosmos SDK and Geth, and gas spikes as well as reorg issues. The proposal added that MATIC would continue to serve as Polygon\u2019s staking token.\n\n1/ Today a proposal was published to upgrade Polygon PoS to a zkEVM validium, a first-of-its-kind, decentralized ZK Layer 2.\n\n\n\nAs a zkEVM validium, Polygon PoS would inherit Ethereum's unmatched security, while preserving low fees & high scalability.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd https://t.co/5fsMOqLqRy pic.twitter.com/9r9VILxdvu \u2014 Polygon (Labs) (@0xPolygonLabs) June 20, 2023\n\nzkEVM Validium has been presented as a viable, beneficial, and straightforward solution for Polygon\u2019s ongoing issues. Direct benefits of the upgrade would include increased security by leveraging Ethereum\u2019s high security, and future-proof tech stack rather than legacy blockchain architecture. If approved the proposal would also eliminate reorgs, speed up transaction confirmations, increase stability and fee estimation, and bring greater decentralization while making it compatible with Polygon 2.0.\n\n\u201cUpgraded Polygon PoS (zkEVM validium) would offer very high scalability and very low fees, with the tradeoff of storing transaction data locally instead of on Ethereum. It would be a great fit for applications that have high transaction volume and require low transaction fees, e.g. Web3 gaming and social.\u201d Mihailo Bjelic, co-founder, Polygon\n\nAs per the timeline laid out in accordance with the governance process, the pre-PIP discussion and consensus are expected to be done before the end of July 2023. PIP publishing, discussion, and consensus would take place between October as well as November 2023. That would be followed by PIP implantation and testing between November and January 2024. Lastly, the upgrade and PIP activation on the mainnet would take place between February 2024 and March 2024."

A subset of MEV is front-running, in which an attacker attempts to have their own transaction executed ahead of the one broadcast by users. MEV and front-running are recognized as some of the final unsolved fundamental problems in the blockchain space.\n\nShutter Network aims to solve for malicious MEV and front-running by allowing users to send encrypted transactions that are opaque to front runners. Shutter Network is additionally decentralized and gas-efficient.\n\nOKX Ventures Founder Dora Yue said: \u201cAt OKX Ventures we are committed to building a sound and secure on-chain environment through considered investments in high-impact projects. We are confident that Shutter Network will continue to contribute to network stabilization and add further value amid the exponential growth of MEV.\u201d\n\nIn May of 2023, Shutter Network launched Shutter protoDAO, which represents a significant step towards decentralization of Keypers nodes.\n\nOKX Ventures will continue to support projects that seek to overcome obstacles to the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology."

        "title": "Cryptocurrency Price Today: Bitcoin Rises Above $28,000 As Top Coins Land In Greens - ABP Live",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s oldest and most valued cryptocurrency, managed to shake off its slump and rise above $28,000 early Wednesday morning. The sudden rally could largely be attributed to Deutsche Bank\u2019s plans to start crypto custody services. Other popular altcoins \u2014 including the likes of Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Litecoin (LTC) \u2014 landed in the greens across the board. Stacks (STX) remained the biggest gainer for the second consecutive day, with a 24-hour gain of over 20 percent.\n\nThe global crypto market cap stood at $1.13 trillion at the time of writing, registering a 24-hour gain of 5.08 percent.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Today\n\nBitcoin price stood at $28,691.99, registering a 24-hour jump of 6.56 percent, as per CoinMarketCap. According to Indian exchange WazirX, BTC price stood at Rs 24.85 lakh.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Today\n\nETH price stood at $1,814.01, marking a 24-hour gain of 4.70 percent at the time of writing. As per WazirX, Ethereum price in India stood at Rs 1.59 lakh.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) Price Today\n\nDOGE registered a 24-hour jump of 2.41 percent, as per CoinMarketCap data, currently priced at $0.06383. As per WazirX, Dogecoin price in India stood at Rs 5.60.\n\nLitecoin (LTC) Price Today\n\nLitecoin saw a 24-hour gain of 5.85 percent. At the time of writing, it was trading at $81.88.

As per WazirX, Ripple price stood at Rs 43.\n\nSolana (SOL) Price Today\n\nSolana price stood at $16.84, marking a 24-hour gain of 4.46 percent. As per WazirX, SOL price in India stood at Rs 1,458.95.\n\nTop Crypto Gainers Today (June 21)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto gainers over the past 24 hours:\n\nStacks (STX)\n\nPrice: $0.7556\n\n24-hour gain: 20.53 percent\n\nConflux (CFX)\n\nPrice: $0.2169\n\n24-hour gain: 19.71 percent\n\nFlow (FLOW)\n\nPrice: $0.5489\n\n24-hour gain: 19.67 percent\n\nOptimism (OP)\n\nPrice: $1.34\n\n24-hour gain: 15.83 percent\n\nPepe (PEPE)\n\nPrice: $0.000001608\n\n24-hour gain: 13.52 percent\n\nTop Crypto Losers Today (June 21)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto losers over the past 24 hours:\n\nTether Gold (XAUT)\n\nPrice: $1,938.72\n\n24-hour loss: 0.46 percent\n\nBitTorrent(NEW) (BTT)\n\nPrice: $0.0000004694\n\n24-hour loss: 0.27 percent\n\nTrueUSD (TUSD)\n\nPrice: $1.00\n\n24-hour loss: 0.11 percent\n\nUSD Coin (USDC)\n\nPrice: $0.9999\n\n24-hour loss: 0.02 percent\n\nDai (DAI)\n\nPrice: $0.9998\n\n24-hour loss: 0.01 percent\n\nWhat Crypto Exchanges Are Saying About Current Market Scenario\n\nMudrex co-founder and CEO Edul Patel told ABP Live, \u201cOver the last 24 hours, most cryptocurrencies rose after Deutsche Bank's application for a licence to offer crypto custody services. Notably, Bitcoin has demonstrated strength by surpassing the $28,500 threshold, a level that had not been reached in the past two weeks. On Tuesday, BTC successfully broke through a significant resistance level, indicating a positive trend in the market. The primary driver behind this upward movement seems to be the increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin, as evidenced by recent filings for a spot Bitcoin ETF by BlackRock and Fidelity Investments. Currently, BTC is finding support around $28,450, while resistance levels are established at $29,000 and subsequently $30,000. Overall, the market sentiment is bullish, reflecting a positive outlook.\u201d\n\nParth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures, said, \u201cBTC, up 6.9 percent from yesterday, pushed its $28,000 resistance level and is currently trading above it; new resistance level at $30,000. BTC\u2019s price movement comes against the backdrop of its dominance crossing 50 percent for the first time in the last two years. BlackRock\u2019s BTC ETF development further underlines BTC\u2019s bull case. It could also be that BTC has not been implicated in regulatory complexities which are currently being faced by altcoins.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, offered his take, \u201cBitcoin\u2019s market oscillators and moving averages indicate a \u2018Buy\u2019 sentiment. The bullish sentiment that was initiated by Blackrock\u2019s ETF filing has snowballed as more institutions have joined in to support Crypto trading. Despite market FUD for the most part of last week, Bitcoin\u2019s current movement defies previous predictions and gives hope for a $30k mark amidst its correction phase.\"\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin (BTC) showed strength by breaking the descending trendline at $26,400, reinforcing its bullish outlook. The buy zone is supported by positive signals from the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence (MACD) indicators. On the NFT front, Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate with over 11 percent market revenue growth, while Bitcoin NFTs hold the second position. The latest data from the June 20, 2023 crypto slam reveals a slight increase in NFT sales, totalling just over $146 million.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, \u201cThe crypto market has seen a remarkable surge in trading activity over the past 24 hours, with a total volume of $43.95 billion, representing an impressive 59.14 percent increase. Bitcoin has crossed the $28,000 mark due to growing interest from institutions.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cIn the past 24 hours, the total volume of the cryptocurrency market reached $27.54 billion, reflecting a significant increase of 33.03 percent compared to the previous period. Additionally, the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector contributed $1.67 billion to the overall volume, accounting for approximately 6.06 percent of the total crypto market volume. These figures indicate a growing interest and participation in both the broader cryptocurrency market and the specific DeFi sector.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: https://t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "title": "Ethereum Rainbow Chart Sets ETH Price Prediction For 2025 - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Ethereum has gained more than 75% year-to-date (YTD) and is currently trading at the $1,900 price level, firmly rejecting the $1,200 lows from the start of the year. With a bullish boost permeating the markets as of late, crypto investors are now hopeful the second-largest cryptocurrency will break the multi-month resistance at $2,000 and possibly climb higher in the second half of the year.\n\nWhile the short-term outlook for Ethereum certainly seems promising, many holders are wondering what to expect in the long term. There are several potential growth catalysts that could help propel the price of Ethereum beyond its current all-time high (ATH), including the 2024 Bitcoin halving and the growing deflationary pressure that started mounting after the leading smart-contract platform transitioned from the Proof-of-Work (PoW) to the energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus system last September.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019re going to examine various Ethereum growth catalysts and consult the Ethereum Rainbow Chart to see what Ethereum\u2019s price might be at the end of 2025.\n\n\u201cHODL!\u201d \u2013 The Ethereum Rainbow Chart predicts the price of ETH will increase in the short term\n\nWhat is Ethereum Rainbow Chart? The Ethereum Rainbow Chart developed by the crypto analytics platform CoinCodex is a graphical representation of Ethereum\u2019s price movements over time, displaying the various price ranges that ETH has historically experienced. It is based on logarithmic price scales and uses a color-coded spectrum to represent different price zones \u2013 at the lower bound, it starts at dark blue, indicating price areas where ETH is severely undervalued, and goes all the way to red, which indicates a price area where ETH is significantly overbought.\n\nThe Rainbow Chart suggests now might be a good time to hold onto ETH or potentially buy some more.\n\nThe chart offers insights into potential price targets for Ethereum based on historical trends. It allows investors to visualize the areas where ETH has historically encountered resistance or support, indicating potential price ceilings and floors.\n\nAt the moment, the Rainbow Chart suggests that Ethereum is in the \u201cHODL!\u201d band (indicated by yellow), which means that now might be a good time to invest in ETH as the price is likely to increase from here.\n\nThe Ethereum Rainbow Chart prediction for 2025\n\nAccording to the Ethereum Rainbow Chart, ETH could reach as high as $28,768 by the end of 2025. Meanwhile, the chart forecasts that the lower bound for ETH in the same time period could be roughly $865.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price could surpass $28,700 by the end of 2025.\n\nAccounting for all seven price bands, the chart predicts an average price of $8,836 for the end of 2025, about 365% above the current price of $1,900 and 156% above the November 2021 ATH of $4,867.\n\nWhat is Ethereum triple halving, and why could it be the main driver behind ETH\u2019s future price growth\n\nDespite the similarity in terms of naming, Ethereum triple halving is nothing like Bitcoin halving, which sees BTC mining rewards cut in half every 210,000 blocks. Instead, Ethereum triple halving is a concept that refers to three key mechanisms that are helping reduce the supply of ETH, and thus drive its value through deflationary pressure.\n\nThe three main parts of the Ethereum triple halving are:\n\nReduced issuance of new ETH under the Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm\n\nThe effect of ETH burning, which was first introduced with the EIP-1559 upgrade in August 2021\n\nThe lower amount of ETH in circulation due to the effects of Ethereum staking\n\nAll three mechanisms listed above play a role in driving the price growth of Ethereum. Ethereum staking \u2013 introduced with the network transition from PoW to PoS last September (an event known as the \u201cThe Merge\u201d) \u2013 allows investors to deposit lock-in their ETH tokens in order to earn validator opportunities that secure the network in exchange for staking rewards.\n\nThe effect of the Ethereum PoS consensus is two-fold. It allows users to stake their ETH in exchange for rewards, which effectively decreases the number of ETH in circulation. Secondly, there is less ETH produced. Under the PoW model, around 13,000 ETH per day were distributed as mining rewards. Meanwhile, under the PoS model, only 1,600 ETH per day is issued to reward stakers \u2013 a reduction of more than 87%.\n\nWhen the reduced issuance of ETH is combined with the effects of Ethereum burning introduced with the EIP-1559, Ethereum turns into a deflationary asset. That\u2019s exactly what we can observe in practice \u2013 since the Merge went live on September 15, 2023, the supply of Ethereum decreased by roughly 282,000 ETH. According to simulations run by Ultra Sound Money, the supply of ETH would have increased by 2,938,900 ETH in the same time period if PoW was still in place.\n\nNote The reduction of supply plays a major role in controlling the price of Ethereum through basic supply and demand mechanics \u2013 the fewer ETH there are, the higher the value of a single ETH (as long as demand is there, obviously).\n\nFor more information about Ethereum triple halving and how the trio of concepts can act as a long-term price catalyst for ETH, check the video below.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "How-To How to Import Cryptocurrency Prices Into Google Sheets By\n\nDo you want to keep on top of the latest crypto price rises (and falls)? Learn how to import cryptocurrency prices into Google Sheets using this guide.\n\nIf you own any cryptocurrency or you\u2019re thinking about buying some, you\u2019ll want to keep track of the current prices. That way, you\u2019ll know if it\u2019s the right time to buy or sell. There are plenty of websites that can provide this information, but you might prefer to use a spreadsheet to keep track of prices over time, or to do other calculations.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of Google Sheets, it\u2019s possible to get cryptocurrency price data into your spreadsheets and then use them how you wish. Learn how to import cryptocurrency prices into Google Sheets below.\n\nHow to Import Cryptocurrency Prices using GOOGLEFINANCE in Google Sheets\n\nThe GOOGLEFINANCE function allows you to pull live information on a wide range of traditional currencies directly from Google. It also allows you to pull prices for some of the most popular cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Cardano, and Binance Coin, but it doesn\u2019t work with others such as Dogecoin.\n\nTo import cryptocurrency prices using GOOGLEFINANCE:\n\nOpen a Google Sheets document. Select the cell where you want the price to appear. For the price of Ethereum, enter the following formula: =GOOGLEFINANCE(\u201cETHUSD\u201d) For the price of Ethereum, enter the following formula: =GOOGLEFINANCE(\u201cBTCUSD\u201d) If you want to import other cryptocurrencies, you\u2019ll need to include CURRENCY in the formula. For example, for Litecoin, enter the following formula: =GOOGLEFINANCE(\u201cCURRENCY:LTCUSD\u201d) You can replace LTC with many of the more popular cryptocurrency codes, such as ADA and XRP, but it won\u2019t work with four-letter codes such as DOGE and LINK. Press Enter and the price will calculate.\n\nYour spreadsheet will automatically update periodically as the price of your selected cryptocurrency changes. This usually happens after 20 minutes or so.\n\nHow to Import Cryptocurrency Prices Using IMPORTXML in Google Sheets\n\nIf you want to import cryptocurrency prices that the GOOGLEFINANCE function doesn\u2019t handle, then one option is to scrape the data directly from a cryptocurrency website. The IMPORTXML function allows you to pull the data from the webpage and bring it into your Google Sheets document.\n\nTo import cryptocurrency prices using IMPORTXML:\n\nIn an empty cell, paste the URL for the webpage containing your cryptocurrency price data. For example, for the Ethereum page of CoinMarketCap.com, you would paste the URL https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/\n\nNavigate to that page in Chrome, and right-click on the price you want to import. Select Inspect.\n\nThe value you selected should be highlighted. If not, click on the price in the left-hand pane. Just above the price, you should see a div name.\n\nRight-click on this line and select Copy Element. Paste this somewhere into your spreadsheet and highlight and copy just the class name, such as class=\u201dpriceValue \u201c In the cell next to the URL, type: //div[@\n\nPaste the class name that you just copied and type a closed square bracket. Your cell should now read something like: //div[@class=\"priceValue \"] Now select the cell where you want your cryptocurrency price data to appear and type the following: =IMPORTXML( Click in the cell containing your URL, type a comma, click in the cell containing your div class, and finally type a closed bracket. Your formula should look something like this: =IMPORTXML(G10,H10) Press Enter and the cryptocurrency price data should be scraped from the website.\n\nHow to Refresh Scraped Cryptocurrency Prices in Google Sheets\n\nThe data you have scraped will update once per hour. To keep the value updated more frequently, you can force the cell to recalculate. One fairly simple way to do so is to create a macro that copies the cell, deletes it, and pastes it back in again. This will cause the cell to recalculate which should pull the most recent data from the cryptocurrency website.\n\nTo refresh scraped cryptocurrency prices using a macro:\n\nOpen the Google Sheets spreadsheet containing your scraped data. In the menu, click Extensions.\n\nHover over Macros and select Record Macro.\n\nOnce the macro is recording, click the cell with your scraped data. Press Ctrl+C on Windows or Cmd+C on Mac to copy the cell. Press Delete or Backspace to delete the cell. In the same cell, press Ctrl+V on Windows or Cmd+V on Mac to paste the formula back into the cell. Click Save at the bottom of the screen to save your macro.\n\nGive your macro a name. If you wish, you can also add a keyboard shortcut.\n\nClick Save. To run your macro, press your keyboard shortcut, or go to Extensions > Macros and click on your macro name.\n\nYour cell should now refresh and the data inside it should update.\n\nHow to Import Cryptocurrency Prices Using IMPORTDATA\n\nYou can also import cryptocurrency data using a website specifically designed for this purpose. The IMPORTDATA function allows you to pull price information directly from this website. The data will refresh once an hour.\n\nTo import cryptocurrency prices using IMPORTDATA:\n\nClick in the cell where you want the price data to appear. Enter a formula in the following format: =IMPORTDATA(https://cryptoprices.cc/ETH/) You can change ETH to the code of a variety of different cryptocurrencies. See https://cryptoprices.cc/sitemap.txt for the full list of options. Press Enter and you should see the current price.\n\nHow to Import Cryptocurrency Prices Using the CoinMarketCap API\n\nAnother way to get cryptocurrency prices from CoinMarketCap is to use its API. By creating an account and generating your own API key, you can poll the site directly and import a huge amount of cryptocurrency information into your Google Sheets document.\n\nIn order to get the data into Google Sheets, you\u2019ll need to use an add-on called API Connector.\n\nTo import cryptocurrency prices using the CoinMarketCap API:\n\nOpen your Google Sheets document and click the Extensions menu.\n\nHover over Add-ons and click Get Add-ons.\n\nIn the search field, type API Connector and press Enter.\n\nSelect API Connector in the search results.\n\nClick Install.\n\nSign in to your Google account and allow the required permissions. To set up your CoinMarketCap API, navigate to https://coinmarketcap.com/api/ Click Get Your API Key Now.\n\nEnter your details, select Basic as your plan type, and click Create My Account.\n\nYou\u2019ll be emailed to verify your account. Click the link, and you\u2019ll be redirected to the API dashboard. Hover over the API Key and click Copy Key.\n\nReturn to your Google Sheets document and click Extensions.\n\nHover over API Connector and click Open.\n\nClick Create Request.\n\nUnder Application select CoinMarketCap from the drop-down box.\n\nClick in the API Key field and paste your copied API key.\n\nUnder Endpoint, select /v2/cryptocurrency/quotes/latest from the drop-down.\n\nClick the Plus (+) symbol next to Aux and select any of the options from the drop-down\u2014the request won\u2019t run without a selection in this field.\n\nClick the Plus (+) symbol next to Slug and select the coin or coins you want to pull data for.\n\nSelect a cell in your spreadsheet where you want the first cell of the pulled data to appear, and click Set Current.\n\nGive your request a name and click Save.\n\nClick Run and your request will run.\n\nThe column USD.price contains the current price information.\n\n\n\nHow to Update Cryptocurrency Prices Using API Connector\n\nThe price generated by the CoinMarketCap API will not automatically update. However, it is possible to get API Connector to refresh your data at regular intervals from once an hour up to once a month. This will help you to ensure that your cryptocurrency prices are up-to-date.\n\nTo update cryptocurrency prices using API Connector:\n\nClick the Extensions menu.\n\nHover over API Connector and select Open.\n\nSelect the Schedule tab.\n\nClick Create Trigger.\n\nUnder API Request, select the name of the request you created in the section above.\n\nUnder Run Request, select your refresh time.\n\nEnter a name under Trigger Name and click Save. Your cryptocurrency data will now refresh at the frequency that you selected.\n\nChecking Your Portfolio in Google Sheets\n\nLearning how to import cryptocurrency prices into Google Sheets means you can use that price data in whatever calculations you wish. You\u2019ll be able to monitor prices, and even set up some conditional formatting to alert you when the cryptocurrency hits a certain price.\n\nThere are plenty of other useful Google Sheets tricks you can learn. You might want to learn how to use timestamps in Google Sheets, for example. Or you may want to know how to remove dollar signs in Google Sheets if some of your scraped data has included them. You might also want to learn how to merge sheets in Google Sheets to help you organize your data."

        "content": "A new protocol has emerged on the Ethereum blockchain, captivating the interest of enthusiasts and developers alike. Ethscriptions, introduced by Genius.com co-founder Tom Lehman, allow users to inscribe and share digital objects on the Ethereum main chain. With their potential to revolutionize the way non-financial data is recorded and accessed on the blockchain, these have already generated significant buzz within the Ethereum community.\n\nWhy Does The World Need Ethscriptions?\n\n\n\nFirst, let's discuss why the world needs Ethereum. Ethereum is a cloud computing platform like AWS; however, while AWS is controlled by Amazon, Ethereum is decentralized and controlled by no one.\n\n\n\nThe world needs Ethereum not because AWS is\u2026 \u2014 Middlemarch (@dumbnamenumbers) June 20, 2023\n\nThe Rise of Ethscriptions\n\nEthscriptions is a play on the term \u201cEthereum\u201d and \u201cInscriptions\u201d. The moniker takes inspiration from Ordinal inscriptions on the Bitcoin network.\n\nThe new protocol was launched to immense success with nearly 30,000 Ethscriptions created within a remarkably short span of 18 hours according to reports. This protocol empowers users to write arbitrary data onto the Ethereum blockchain, opening up new possibilities for creative expression and data storage.\n\nInitially limited to images, the protocol will soon expand its capabilities to include various file types.\n\nThe Power of Ethereum \u201cCalldata\u201d\n\nAt the heart of Ethscriptions lies the innovative use of Ethereum \u201ccalldata\u201d \u2013 the data provided when interacting with a smart contract. By leveraging on it, Ethscriptions offer a cheaper and more decentralized alternative to conventional contract storage methods.\n\nThis approach ensures the uniqueness of all valid Ethscriptions, guaranteeing the integrity and immutability of the inscribed content. In a world increasingly focused on Layer 2 scaling solutions, these position themselves at the forefront of blockchain innovation.\n\nA Playground for Innovation\n\nOne aspect that sets Ethscriptions apart is the Ethereum community\u2019s embrace of innovation and experimentation. This openness has paved the way for developers to explore the potential of blockchain technology.\n\nAdam McBride, a self-proclaimed NFT archaeologist, enthuses that the new protocol will drive innovation and adoption by pushing the boundaries of what blockchain can achieve much like Ordinals.\n\nThe Crypto Punks Frenzy\n\nTo gain prominence and ignite interest, Lehman called for the renowned NFT collection, Crypto Punks, to be ethscribed. This call sparked a frenzy, resulting in the inscription of copies of all 10,000 Crypto Punk images within a matter of hours.\n\nThe enthusiastic response showcased the immense potential and demand for Ethscriptions in the NFT space.\n\nIntroducing Ethscriptions: a new way of creating and sharing digital artifacts on Ethereum using transaction calldata.https://t.co/XfQ7RdtblD\n\n\n\nALSO: Introducing Ethereum Punks. Because why should all non-contract Punk collecting happen on Bitcoin?https://t.co/d3Ycwbdc2Z\u2026 \u2014 Middlemarch (@dumbnamenumbers) June 16, 2023\n\nChallenges and Existing Technology\n\nDespite its impressive debut, Ethscriptions faced intermittent periods of downtime due to the overwhelming surge of new users. Some critics argue that similar technologies have existed for years, with certain artists already utilizing them in their work. However, it is through the recent widespread awareness and adoption that their true potential is being recognized.\n\nThe Future of Ethscriptions\n\nThe fate of Ethscriptions as either a fleeting trend or a transformative force within the Ethereum community lies in the hands of its users and stakeholders. As developers continue to experiment and push the boundaries of blockchain technology, the impact of these on digital objects and data inscription is poised to evolve and expand.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nEthscriptions have emerged as a revolutionary protocol, enabling the creation and sharing of digital objects on the Ethereum blockchain. With its utilization of Ethereum calldata and its open embrace of innovation, these are poised to shape the future of non-financial data inscription and drive further adoption within the Ethereum community. Their true potential and impact, however, will undoubtedly be determined by the collective efforts of developers and users alike going forward."

        "title": "TRON now available on Ethereum, ERC20 altcoin Tradecurve sets new highs - Blockzeit",
        "content": "It has become a brutal world for altcoin holders following the SEC\u2019s ruling, and more than $35 billion was wiped off the market cap of the altcoins deemed securities collectively. The general consensus among the community is clear: DeFi is the way forward, and from now on, innovation will take place worldwide instead of in the United States.\n\n\n\nDespite Tron (TRX) being labeled as a security, analysts remain bullish, primarily because Tron (TRX) is now available on Ethereum (ETH), improving its liquidity and general use cases in DeFi. But the ERC-20 altcoin everyone watches is Tradecurve (TCRV) which continues to set new highs.\n\n>>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW<<\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) Trading-Specialized ERC-20 Altcoin\n\nTradecurve sets new highs and still has plenty of room to grow. Tradecurve employs a hybrid infrastructure model rolling the best of centralized and decentralized services into one fluid platform. The protocol has the ease of use of a CEX but the privacy and custodial elements of a DEX.\n\n\n\nTradecurve opens the door to TradFi primary assets in DeFi, and this revolutionary market access has analysts forecasting $TCRV will 50X before the presale closes. Instead of solely crypto-trading pairs, Tradecurve lets investors trade on bonds, commodities, and forex, all from crypto-to-derivatives pairings.\n\n\n\nThe experience mirrors the order book model found on CEXs with slippage-free and rapid fills. But everything else is entirely DeFi. Transparent on-chain pricing, self-custody, and a real focus on privacy- Tradecurve has no KYC policy!\n\n\n\nAs trading products become harder to access for retail traders, Tradecurve shines a light in the dark and offers true financial inclusion for users worldwide- multiple financial instruments and asset classes from a single platform.\n\n\n\nTradecurve will rapidly become a trading hub, and its current trajectory puts it on a path to overtaking even globally established trading giants like Huobi and OKB. Set to onboard 100,000 traders within the first three months.\n\nThe $TCRV presale may even outshine the legendary $BNB ICO listed in 2017 at an initial price of $0.15.\n\nTron (TRX) Enters the Ethereum Landscape\n\nTron (TRX) lost 10% in the last seven days due to the SEC labeling Tron (TRX) a security, but analysts signal this is short-term noise with their price predictions. They forecast Tron (TRX) trading in a band between $0.13 and $0.15 in 2024, showing a nearly 100% upside in the next twelve months. Although Tron (TRX) cannot even come close to matching $TCRV\u2019s growth potential, these growth predictions remain impressive.\n\n\n\nTron (TRX) has begun to establish itself more globally, with founder Justin Sun pursuing a license for Huobi to operate in Hong Kong. This pivot towards Eastern markets and the capital exposure it will bring, provide an excellent long-term catalyst for Tron (TRX) growth.\n\n\n\nTron (TRX) launching within the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem provides another major boon, and this layer one continues to grow its TVL (Total value Locked) and utility within the broader DeFi ecosystem.\n\nLearn more about Tradecurve and the TCRV token below:\n\nClick Here For Website\n\nClick Here To Buy TCRV Presale Tokens\n\nFollow Us Twitter\n\nJoin Our Community on Telegram"
