        "content": "Crypto-focused early-stage VC firm Electric Capital has found that while Ethereum has the most developers in total, a majority of monthly active developers are working on other ecosystems.\n\nDespite a bear crypto market in 2022, developers continued to create and progress towards mass adoption of decentralized applications (dApps). The crypto industry added 5% more developers in 2022 year-on-year, despite a 70% plunge in cryptoasset prices, the report released on Tuesday showed.\n\nThe year was a rocky one for cryptoassets, given the tightening monetary policy and a string of bankruptcies, stirring fears of liquidity due to contagion. Yet, the industry captured over 61,000 first-time developers \u2014 an all-time high. Since the creation of Bitcoin in 2009, there are now more than 23,000 developers in the industry.\n\nTotal monthly active developers based on crypto ecosystems GitHub; Source: Electric Capital\n\nCore blockchain developers focus on designing the front-end and back-end of a proposed blockchain network, which will then be used as a foundation by others. Even after a blockchain is built, they continue to develop new features and technology to improvise or activate upgrades for better functionality.\n\nElectric Capital found that developer activity in 2022 was far busier than the previous crypto winter of 2018, when bitcoin plunged 65%\n\nSince 2018, the number of monthly active developers rose nearly 300% for Bitcoin. For Ethereum, developer count quintupled from 1,084 to 5,819 in that time period.\n\nSome devs opt for emerging blockchains\n\nThe year of the Merge was significant for Ethereum, and its share of new developers for the stands at 16%.\n\nBut developers working on the Solana, NEAR and Polygon protocols rose 40% year-on-year, and added more than 500 total monthly active developers combined.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nSui, Aptos, Starknet, Mina, Osmosis, Hedera, Optimism and Arbitrum were other blockchains that absorbed developer activity.\n\nThose working on software for non-fungible tokens saw a 300% jump since 2021.\n\nDeveloper engagement is an \u201cearly and leading indicator of value creation,\u201d according to the VC firm. \u201cDevelopers build killer applications that deliver value to end users, which attracts more customers, which then draws more developers,\u201d it added.\n\nAnd what about Bitcoin, recently?

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) in September 2022 increased interest in staking across a number of parties \u2014 including institutions.\n\nThe success of the Merge propelled Ethereum from \u201ca smart contract platform lagging behind\u201d into \u201csomething that was doing things right,\u201d Diogo M\u00f3nica, co-founder and president of Anchorage Digital, a crypto bank last valued over $3 billion, said to TechCrunch. \u201cInterest from investors grew and the appetite changed dramatically.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s true: Institutional interest in ETH staking increased after the Merge, Matt Hougan, CIO at Bitwise Asset Management, said to TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, by holding Ethereum, you went from holding a bet on smart contract platform to holding a bet that holds yield,\u201d M\u00f3nica said.\n\nStaking is a way of earning rewards for holding a certain token (in this instance, ETH) for a certain amount of time. In return for staking, people are paid out yield or additional rewards in exchange for holding their coins to secure the network.\n\nIn a way, it\u2019s like having cash in your wallet or parking your cash in a bank CD, Hougan said. \u201cYou lock your money up in the CD and the bank pays you interest. In this example, you lock your ETH up in a staking pool and earn interest.\u201d\n\nThe total reward rate for staking ETH is about 4% currently, according to Staking Rewards data. Prior to the Merge, about 287 ETH were staked per day on average. After the Merge, about 623 ETH were staked per day on average, a 117% increase in about five months, a report by Anchorage Digital stated.\n\nToday, most people participating in staking are either retail investors or crypto-native hedge funds or institutions. But as the market matures, the range of investors participating \u201cwill grow substantially,\u201d Hougan said.\n\nThere\u2019s about 15.8 million staked ETH, up from 8.8 million in January 2022, according to the CoinGecko 2022 Annual Crypto Report. As new Ethereum network upgrades are anticipated in the near future, institutional investors will become increasingly interested in the space, both Hougan and M\u00f3nica said.\n\n\u201cThere was a big jump in interest [post-Merge], but there\u2019s still a latent appetite,\u201d M\u00f3nica said. \u201cPeople are looking for the March date.\u201d\n\nIn March, Ethereum network is supposed to launch its Shanghai upgrade, which will allow people who stake ETH to withdraw it at any time.\n\n\u201cTo this point, people who have staked ETH were locking it up indefinitely,\u201d Hougan said. \u201cThe Shanghai upgrade will allow you to withdraw staked ETH. Our view is that this will substantially grow the size of the staking market, as more investors will be willing to stake now that withdrawals are enabled.\u201d\n\nThe success of the Merge removed some uncertainty around whether and when stakers would be able to withdraw ETH, Hougan said. \u201cThat said, staking remains a largely crypto-native market; most traditional investors are still wary of risks in the market.\u201d\n\nM\u00f3nica shared that a \u201clarge majority\u201d of Anchorage Digital\u2019s clients are staking ETH. While it\u2019s \u201chard\u201d to pinpoint who, very few clients have ETH unstaked \u2014 and those who do usually just want to sell it, he added.\n\n\u201cAnybody that is crypto-native or funds or investments that are long-term are doing ETH staking to basically juice up their returns. A lot of corporations that are using the ETH Network aren\u2019t staking it yet,\u201d M\u00f3nica said, \u201ceither because they haven\u2019t figured it out from a tax perspective or they don\u2019t care enough about the 4% yield. Then there\u2019s another category of players that are holding on to ETH and are not super sophisticated.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that staking isn\u2019t riskless, and many of the service providers in the space are new, Hougan said. \u201cThe market will get better and safer over time.\u201d\n\nInstitutions and other investors alike are waiting for the next stage of updates to the Ethereum network. \u201cThey\u2019re on the sidelines ready to jump in,\u201d M\u00f3nica said.\n\n\u201cStaking is an interesting emerging opportunity for long-term crypto investors,\u201d Hougan said. \u201cWe expect the space to grow, not just over the next few weeks but over the next few years. For now, it is likely to be dominated by crypto-native providers and investors who can tolerate significant risk, but over time it will be mainstreamed.\u201d"

        "content": "Despite the fierce headwinds the crypto industry faced over the last year, Web3 development activity has grown at an impressive rate, according to a new report.\n\nOne such key indicator is the number of smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum mainnet, which grew 293% as compared to 2021, reaching rates that resembled the peaks of the previous year, per the \u201cQ4'22 State of Web3 report\u201d released today by blockchain software and development company Alchemy.\n\nRemarkably, this peak of activity came in the fourth quarter of 2022, just as FTX collapsed, driving hefty outflows of funds across the industry\u2019s largest exchanges.\n\nPer the report, the number of deployed smart contracts in Q4 2022 grew 453% quarter-to-quarter, reaching a staggering 4.6 million.\n\nAdditionally, the deployment of smart contracts on Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet grew 187% over the last three months of 2022\u2014and as much as 721% year-to-year\u2014to reach an all-time high of 2.7 million and signal that more decentralized applications (dapps) may enter the market in the future.\n\nThe report used several sources for data collection purposes, including Dune Analytics, DappRadar, and Github, among others.\n\nQ4 2022 building up across the board. Source: Alchemy\n\nDeveloper activity on the rise\n\nSmart contracts, a term coined by blockchain pioneer Nick Szabo in the 1990s, are self-executing pieces of computer code that debuted on the Ethereum blockchain, laying the groundwork for decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and non-custodial lending and borrowing apps.\n\n\"The Web3 developer community is proving to be extremely resilient. This report shows that they're as focused and motivated as ever to build the future of this ecosystem\u2014while honestly acknowledging the unnecessary setbacks we have seen in 2022,\u201d Alchemy's head of growth Jason Shah told Decrypt.\n\nAlchemy Acquires Ethereum Coding Platform ChainShot\n\nAdditionally, in December Alchemy surveyed 985 developers, and of those, 94% said they were committed to building in Web3, which \u201chighlighted a positive outlook despite being in the thick of crypto winter,\u201d per Alchemy.\n\nFollowing the launch of its Alchemy University in October, the San Francisco-based firm said that more than 100,000 applications poured in, indicating strong interest in building Web3 development skills.\n\n\u201cWe're encouraged by these numbers and expect developer activity to continue to increase in 2023,\u201d Shah told Decrypt, although conceding that this may potentially be happening at a slower rate given decreasing investment in Web3 companies."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), could grow by 35% versus Bitcoin (BTC) this year to hit 0.1 BTC for the first time since 2018 as it forms a classic bullish continuation pattern.\n\nEthereum price must first break key resistance\n\nDubbed an ascending triangle, the pattern forms when the price fluctuates inside a range defined by rising trendline support and horizontal trendline resistance. It typically resolves after the price breaks out in the direction of its previous trend.\n\nOn a weekly chart, the ETH/BTC pair has been painting an ascending pattern since May 2021. The Ethereum token eyes a breakout above the pattern's horizontal trendline resistance near 0.0776 BTC. Breaking this level could then see the price rally by as much as the triangle's maximum height.\n\nIn other words, the ETH/BTC pair could reach the next big resistance level at 0.1 BTC in 2023, or 35% from the current price levels.\n\nETH/BTC weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nNonetheless, it is important to mention that ETH/BTC has attempted to break above the triangle's resistance trendline eight times since May 2021. The attempts included two major breakouts in November 2021 and September 2022, which saw the pair rallying 14% and 9%, respectively.\n\nBoth rallies fizzled out inside the 0.082 to 0.085 BTC area, followed by extreme price corrections that took ETH/BTC back inside the triangle range. Given this multi-year hurdle, the pair could face stiff resistance inside the 0.082 to 0.085 BTC range, even if it breaks above the triangle.\n\nSuch a move would risk crashing ETH toward the triangle support, which coincides with its 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA), represented by the red line in the chart above, near 0.070 BTC, down nearly 6% from the current price levels.\n\nETH \"deflation\" narrative\n\nEther\u2019s bullish setup versus Bitcoin appears as ETH dominance has doubled versus other crypto assets in the past few years.\n\nNotably, ETH\u2019s market capitalization has risen to nearly 20.5% of the entire crypto market valuation in January 2023, from about 10% in December 2020, when the Ethereum network started its transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) with the launch of a dedicated staking smart contract.\n\nETH.D weekly performance chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBecoming a PoS blockchain has brought two key changes to Ethereum\u2019s economy. First, users temporarily lock away a portion of their Ether holdings into Ethereum\u2019s PoS smart contract to earn yield. And second, the Ethereum network has started burning some transaction fees.\n\nRelated: Ethereum \u2018shark\u2019 accumulation, Shanghai hard fork put $2K ETH price in play\n\nBoth changes have had a deflationary impact on overall supply. As a result, the Ethereum network now regularly produces fewer Ether tokens than are taken out of circulation, which theoretically makes ETH a \u201cdeflationary\u201d asset.\n\nETH supply change since the Ethereum PoS upgrade in September 2022.

On Wednesday, founder Joseph Lubin published a blog post announcing 97 layoffs\u201411% of the firm\u2019s staff.\n\nIn an interview with Fortune, Lubin said the cuts did not target any product staff but were instead aimed at people employed in supporting functions whose workloads have diminished during the industry downturn. (Coindesk reported rumors of the layoffs last week.)\n\nLubin declined to disclose any details about ConsenSys\u2019s financials other than saying that, like the rest of the industry, revenue has declined. But he said the firm\u2019s balance sheet was \u201cvery solid,\u201d and attributed the cuts to what he described as a temporary necessity in response to a \u201chorrible macroeconomic situation.\u201d\n\nIn addition to macroeconomic factors like inflation and supply chain issues, Lubin said the crypto industry\u2019s struggles are the result of the end of a hype cycle and, in particular, so-called \u201cCeFi\u201d (centralized finance) companies\u2014firms that drape themselves in the mantle of crypto but lack the decentralized ethos and operations of what Lubin and others view as true crypto.\n\nAccording to Lubin, some of these firms\u2014including entities like Voyager and Celsius that have gone bankrupt\u2014pursued profits in reckless fashion, often burning their clients in the process.\n\n\u201cThe downturn would have happened anyways without CeFi shenanigans but was wickedly exacerbated by CeFi. Whether they were consciously exploiting customers or just doing stupid things was hard to tell,\u201d Lubin said.\n\nIn coming months, Lubin says ConsenSys\u2014which began as a Brooklyn incubator backing dozens of Ethereum startups\u2014will further sharpen its focus to build out the most promising elements of its business.\n\nThis includes MetaMask, which has over 30 million users, and has recently added the ability for users to stake their tokens\u2014the crypto version of depositing funds to earn interest\u2014and access more third-party services. ConsenSys will also continue to build out its other flagship product, Infura, which provides crypto infrastructure services to companies in sectors like tech and banking.\n\nLubin said ConsenSys will also focus its attention on two newer services: decentralized identity and support services for elements of Web3 commerce that include NFTs.\n\n\u201cWhat lies ahead is massive potential for Web3, a multi-year journey that we are excited to embark on,\u201d said Lubin in the blog post."

Nightfall is an Optimistic Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Roll-Up that helps enable private transactions on the public Ethereum blockchain. Using Nightfall, enterprises can orchestrate private transactions efficiently on the Ethereum mainnet without compromising the transparency, data immutability and security that Ethereum provides.\n\nPaul Brody, EY Global Blockchain Leader, says:\n\n\u201cThis update marks the readiness of Nightfall to enable development of enterprise solutions. With more than six months of testnet operations, we consider this a \u2018production beta\u2019, ready for enabling client supply chain and business operations.\u201d\n\nEY first contributed Nightfall to the public domain in 2019 as a set of protocols for enabling private transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. In September 2021, EY teamed up with Polygon to create a beta version of Nightfall that can mitigate network congestion and high transaction prices resulting from increased usage and wider adoption of Ethereum. EY core software and service offerings in the global blockchain market \u2013 EY OpsChain and EY Blockchain Analyzer \u2013 use Nightfall, and both are delivered through EY Blockchain\u2019s SaaS platform, Blockchain.ey.com.\n\nThis version of Nightfall introduces two important changes over prior versions: First, to prevent control by an organization or group, the code can be deployed on a fully decentralized basis. Second, to prevent anonymous usage while retaining an open and permissionless network model, users are required to have an enterprise-class X.509 identification certificate to deposit or withdraw. X.509 certificates are a widely adopted open standard for identification used on the internet and are available through many different certificate authorities.\n\nNightfall will remain in the public domain to facilitate the adoption of privacy-focused enterprise solutions among companies seeking to enter Ethereum and conduct meaningful business on the network.\n\nAntoni Martin, Polygon Co-founder responsible for Nightfall says:\n\n\u201cThe move to update Nightfall in the public domain is a major milestone in scaling the Ethereum ecosystem and will open up new use cases for enterprises in Web3.\u201d\n\nThe source code for Nightfall (renamed Nightfall D3) and supporting tools are in the public domain and are available on Github.\n\n-ends-\n\nNotes to editors\n\nAbout EY\n\nEY exists to build a better working world, helping to create long-term value for clients, people and society and build trust in the capital markets.\n\nEnabled by data and technology, diverse EY teams in over 150 countries provide trust through assurance and help clients grow, transform and operate.\n\nWorking across assurance, consulting, law, strategy, tax and transactions, EY teams ask better questions to find new answers for the complex issues facing our world today.\n\nEY refers to the global organization, and may refer to one or more, of the member firms of Ernst & Young Global Limited, each of which is a separate legal entity.

The year 2023 got off to a positive start. From $1,200, the course was able to rise to over $1,250 in the first few days of the year. In the coming days, the rise continued and finally, the price was able to break out of the resistance at $1,400.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price in the last 15 days, source: gocharting.com\n\nIn the last week in particular, the price has seen massive increases. After breaking above $1,400, another rally continued. In response to the Bitcoin price surge above the $20,000 mark, the Ethereum price surged above $1,500, above where the Ethereum price was at the merge.\n\nWhy could the Ethereum price rise?\n\nThe Ethereum price has followed the rise in the Bitcoin price in the last few days. This rise came as part of a general rise in many assets in the world markets. Above all, falling inflation in the USA ensured that prices were able to rise more strongly again in the last few days.\n\nWith the increase in the Bitcoin price, the altcoins followed with strong increases. Bitcoin\u2019s break through the $17,000 resistance has been anticipated for some time. The Ethereum price was ultimately able to break through its resistance at $1,400. In the last few weeks, the price has repeatedly fluctuated between 1,200 and 1,400 dollars.\n\nHow high can the price rise in the next few weeks?\n\nAfter rising above $1,500, the Ethereum price seemed to stabilize in the short term. But recently there was an increase again and the Ethereum price was even able to rise towards $ 1,600. The price increase seems to trigger a momentum that could also cause the price to rise sharply in the coming weeks.\n\nShould the positive market developments continue, the current price increase could actually be sustainable. Especially if the monetary policy of the central banks loosens again and the interest rate hikes stop, the crypto market and thus the Ethereum price could continue to rise in the coming months.\n\nCan Ethereum Price Reach $5,000 in 2023?\n\nThe Ethereum price could therefore continue to rise sharply in the coming weeks. But is the Ethereum price increase so great that the price could even reach the $5,000 mark and thus a new all-time high in 2023?\n\nThe year 2023 could bring a strong rally just in the next 3 to 6 months. This is shown by the year 2019, when the Bitcoin price tripled and the Ethereum price even increased by a factor of 4. If this development is repeated, the Ethereum course could actually reach this mark.\n\nFurthermore, it is not impossible that inflation in Europe and the US will recover very well in the coming weeks. This would be a very good signal for the major markets in the short term. The crypto market could benefit in particular, with strong increases in Bitcoin and also in the Ethereum price.\n\nIs Ethereum a Good Buy?\n\nAt the moment we are seeing strong buying in the Ether token. Although you should be careful not to buy from FOMO when prices are too high, it could still be a worthwhile investment at this point. The direction of the price is straight up in the short-term and we could see a further increase in the next few weeks.\n\nBut in the coming months, the Ethereum price could also rise sustainably if the 2019 scenario is repeated. Although a sustainable increase is not guaranteed, the chances for the next few months may be good.\n\nOffer from CryptoTicker\n\nAre you looking for a chart analysis tool that doesn\u2019t distract you with community messages and other noise?

        "content": "Ethereum went from $1,300 to $1,595 in less than a week and is attracting heavy bullish sentiments in the indices. The Altcoin breached its resistance levels of $1,500, briefly testing the $1,600 mark on Tuesday. The overall crypto market cap reclaimed the $1 trillion mark as Bitcoin saw an inflow of more than $70 billion. The inflows come from both retail and institutional investors as the \u2018Fear & Greed Index\u2018 came out of \u2018Fear\u2019 for the first time in nine months.\n\nAlso Read: Why Is the Crypto Market Up Today?\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: ETH To Reach $1,800 Next?\n\nSource: Unsplash\n\nEthereum price triggered a strong increase at the $1,450 level where it found resistance and got a breakthrough catapulting to $1,500. ETH cleared its resistance zone at $1,500 surpassing $1,550 on Tuesday after spiking nearly 5% within hours.\n\nHowever, ETH faced resistance near the $1,600 zone before briefly retracing in price during the day\u2019s trade. Nonetheless, the ETH chart shows that a swing high is formed at $1,606 levels with a low of $1,520.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin at $20,000 is Full of Roses: Where are the Thorns?\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nEther\u2019s price is now trading above the swing low of $1,520 and is hovering around the $1,570 mark. A key bullish trend line is forming at $1,550 levels and ETH seems to be consolidating in price. An upside from here could take Ethereum to $1,620 levels before finding another resistance zone.\n\nIf ETH manages to break the resistance of $1,620 and move further, its next leg could be at $1,700. Therefore, further gains from hereon might move ETH from $1,750 to $1,800 during the ongoing rally.\n\nAlso Read: When is the Best Time to Buy Bitcoin?

        "content": "New data from crypto analytics firm Santiment suggests that traders may believe the top two leading digital assets by market cap are about to find their local tops.\n\nAccording to Santiment, crypto traders are taking profits on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) at the highest levels seen since 2021.\n\n\u201cAre crypto markets seeing a top? Traders are behaving like they believe so, taking this opportunity to profit take while given the chance. Bitcoin is seeing its highest profit ratio since Feb 2021. For Ethereum, it\u2019s the highest since Oct 2021.\u201d\n\nCrypto analytics firm Glassnode also notes that the king crypto has seen a greater volume of profits realized on-chain compared to losses for the first time since June.\n\n\u201cDuring bear cycles, this tends to act as a psychological level where investors sell at, or near break-even, creating resistance.\u201d\n\nGlassnode further says Bitcoin is in the process of retesting a value of 1.0 on the adjusted spent output profit ratio (aSOPR), which reflects the ratio between selling and purchase prices.\n\nIt would mark the first retest of that line, which has thus far served as the key resistance level throughout the current bear market, since the collapse of FTX, according to the analytics firm.\n\n\u201cA convincing break above 1.0 for realized [profit/loss] ratio, or aSOPR has historically signaled a cycle regime shift is underway. A successful retest and bounce of aSOPR from 1.0 is often observed near cycle turning points.\u201d\n\nBTC is trading at $21,374 at time of writing and is up 0.39% in the past 24 hours while ETH is changing hands for $1,592 and is up 0.22%.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum price rally under question after ETH slams into resistance at $1.6K - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) price is struggling to overcome resistance at $1,600 and this is the altcoin\u2019s third attempt since September. Some would say the 33% year-to-date rally could be interpreted as a failed opportunity to breach the $200 billion market capitalization mark.\n\nEther/USD price index, 2-day. Source: TradingView\n\nIf Ether\u2019s price were to break above $1,600, it would return the No. 2 cryptocurrency to a top-60 global tradable asset, surpassing giant multinational companies like Nike (NKE), Novartis (NVS), Cisco (CSCO) and Toyota (TM).\n\nUnfortunately, at least for bullish traders, derivatives markets are not hinting that Ether will finally break the $1,600 resistance \u2014 at least, not until the U.S. Federal Reserve reverses its course of tightening the economy.\n\nBulls\u2019 frustrations can partially be explained by Silvergate Bank\u2019s $1 billion net loss in the latest quarter. The crypto-friendly bank laid off roughly 40% of its workforce on Jan. 5 and it now faces a class-action lawsuit over its dealings with FTX and Alameda Research. The suit alleges that Silvergate aided and abetted FTX\u2019s fraudulent activities and the exchange\u2019s breaches of fiduciary duty.\n\nThe negative newsflow continued on Jan. 17, as the deputy director-general of Japan\u2019s Financial Services Agency\u2019s Strategy Development and Management Bureau, Mamoru Yanase, argued that the crypto sector should face the same regulation as traditional banks and brokerages.\n\nThe fact that Ether continues to trade above $1,500 is a positive, but the most recent price pump closely followed an 8% gain by the Russell 2000 index. In addition, investors fear that data showing a reduction in inflation was the main driver behind the cryptocurrency market recovery, so any retreat in the stock market could trigger another wave of selling.\n\nConsequently, investors believe that Ether could retrace its recent gains if the U.S. Federal Reserve keeps raising interest rates. Let\u2019s look at Ether derivatives data to understand if the surprise pump positively impacted investor sentiment.\n\nEther\u2019s 33% rally was not enough to instill confidence\n\nRetail traders usually avoid quarterly futures due to their price difference from spot markets. Meanwhile, professional traders prefer these instruments because they prevent the fluctuation of funding rates in a perpetual futures contract.\n\nThe two-month futures annualized premium should trade between +4% to +8% in healthy markets to cover costs and associated risks. However, when the futures trade at a discount versus regular spot markets, it shows a lack of confidence from leverage buyers, which is a bearish indicator.\n\nEther 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe chart above shows that derivatives traders remain in \"fear mode\" because the Ether futures premium is below the 4% threshold. This data indicates the absence of leverage buyers\u2019 demand, although it does not signal that traders expect further adverse price action.\n\nFor this reason, traders should analyze Ether\u2019s options markets to understand whether investors are pricing higher odds of surprise adverse price movements.\n\nOptions markets are neutral, adding strength to the $1.6K resistance\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign when market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 10%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew indicator below -10%, meaning the bearish put options are discounted.\n\nEther 60-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas.ch\n\nThe delta skew improved considerably since Jan. 14, declining from a neutral-to-bearish positive 10% to a neutral options pricing. The movement signaled that options traders became more comfortable with downside risks since the 60-day delta skew stands at negative 2%.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin and Ethereum correct as Bitzlato take down, tech layoffs and economic worries dominate headlines\n\nWhales and market makers are yet to become optimistic according to options markets, but the absence of fear after a 33% rally is encouraging. Both options and futures markets point to pro traders fearing that the $1,600 resistance will continue to exert a negative impact on price.\n\nIn essence, a more effective measure from the Fed is likely needed before crypto investors flip bullish \u2014 either signaling its campaign of interest rate hikes is close to an end, or a shift on the strategy to curb inflation.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has what the crypto industry needs: A clear moral vision - Fortune",
        "content": "The crypto industry is full of people who talk a big game about democracy and freedom, but, at the end of the day, care only about filling their bags and partying in low-tax jurisdictions. Fortunately, there are many others who really do believe in the ideals of decentralization and using blockchain technology to build a better world. One of them is Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin.\n\nI was reminded of this after publishing an interview with Buterin conducted by Ukrainian journalist Anna Tutova during his recent visit to Kyiv. In the interview, he shares his experience meeting hackers and others who are turning Ukraine into a hotbed of tech entrepreneurship even as Russia tries to wipe the country off the map with a brutal and illegal invasion.\n\nEven though he was born in Russia, Buterin has expressed solidarity with Ukraine since the outset of the conflict, and, even amid the war, traveled there by train from Warsaw. His condemnation of Moscow has been a welcome change from too many on Crypto Twitter who, under the guise of libertarianism or quiet fascism, have offered tacit support for Vladimir Putin\u2019s war crimes.\n\nButerin\u2019s moral clarity has also been on display in his relationship with Ethereum, the project he invented and arguably the world\u2019s most important blockchain. After publishing the Ethereum white paper when he was just 20 years old, the famously awkward Buterin navigated a tumultuous row with his cofounders\u2014some of whom have since spread lies and venom about him\u2014and an existential hacking incident to help Ethereum flourish.\n\nDuring all of this, Buterin has never sought out the trappings of crypto fame\u2014Lambos, partying with models, and so on\u2014but has instead focused on learning about the world around him. His writing has expanded far beyond crypto and technology to explore sophisticated theories of governance and politics, while his personal interests have included learning Mandarin and tasting the world\u2019s cuisines. Most impressively of all, he has refused to embrace the cult-of-personality lifestyle too many other crypto founders have favored. Instead, he has slowly followed the example of Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto and sought to let Ethereum grow more decentralized.\n\nButerin would be the ideal person to elect to public office but for the fact that he is so damn weird (see, for example, \u201cVitalik clapping\u201c), although that weirdness is part of his charm and does nothing to detract from the overarching example he sets\u2014especially as crypto struggles through a moral and financial reckoning post-FTX.\n\nSince we\u2019re opening the week on a positive note, let me add that I\u2019ve discovered firsthand how crypto\u2014which so many like to dismiss as useless these days\u2014is a fantastic tool for paying people in conflict zones. Meanwhile, Bitcoin cracked $21,000 and is enjoying its biggest one-week gain in two years. And, finally, I\u2019m delighted to say that Leo Schwartz\u2014who has done excellent work on FTX and as Fortune Crypto\u2019s D.C. whisperer\u2014will be joining the newsletter with a once-a-week edition on the ways of Washington titled Proof of State.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nThe Sand Dollar, a CBDC launched by the Bahamas in 2020, is struggling as residents conflate the central bank token with volatile cryptocurrencies, and the FTX debacle isn't helping.

        "content": "Masa Finance has launched the first soulbound identity protocol for the Ethereum mainnet, according to a Jan. 17 press release shared with Cointelegraph. The protocol will allow for standardized soulbound tokens to be minted on Ethereum for Know Your Customer verification, credit scores and other use cases.\n\nSoulbound tokens are tokens that cannot be transferred from one wallet to another. The concept was popularized via a blog post from Vitalik Buterin, who argued that these tokens could be used to signify governance rights for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols or to prove that a person has attended an event.\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Masa Finance founders Brendan Playford and Calanthia Mei argued that soulbound tokens will expand opportunities for DeFi users to build credit and get loans. Mei explained it as such:\n\nWe want to help people tap into [an] on-chain credit system with a Web3 credit score, with the data sources that we have aggregated across Web2 and Web3 representing and helping people build their creditworthiness on-chain. We\u2019re currently working with multiple lending partners in extending DeFi loans to those individuals who have minted a Masa credit score report.\n\nShe emphasized that Masa soulbound tokens are not merely attached to a traditional credit score. The protocol goes beyond traditional finance to incorporate both Web2 and Web3 activity. Mei said that over 10,000 data points are used in a Masa credit score, including a user\u2019s FICO score, Plaid transaction data for credit and debit cards, Web3 wallet transaction history, centralized exchange balances, and other data.\n\nMei believes this system will lead to \u201crisk-based underwriting\u201d in DeFi, which she says has previously not been possible due to the lack of identity protocols on blockchain networks.\n\nThe founders also said there is one other use case currently available for the protocol. Aside from representing a credit score, the second use case for the protocol is .soul domain names. These are similar to ENS names, but with the added benefit that they can be linked to various Masa identity characteristics. Playford explained that \u201cusers can link different attributes, use their pseudonym to verify themselves, show that they\u2019re verified in Web3 without doxing [their] full name, for example.\"\n\nRelated: Lukso co-founder discusses implications of digital self-sovereignty in Web3\n\nPlayford noted that .soul domain names can be transferred from one wallet to another. However, the attributes associated with them will become unattached if the domain is moved. Therefore, users cannot \u201cbuy\u201d the identity or credit score of another person.\n\nAccording to the founders, a third use case will be identity verification, a feature the company is releasing under the name \u201cMasa Green.\u201d It will allow users to mint a Masa Green token to prove their identity, which the company believes will help users to prove they are real humans, not bots. According to Mei, this will help eliminate bots in play-to-earn games and other apps where the community wants only real humans to participate. The company said Masa Green will be available as a \u201cfast follow within the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nMasa is not the only soulbound token protocol to be implemented on a blockchain network. Binance has released its own version, called BAB, which can be used to prove a user\u2019s identity. However, BAB is currently only available on BNB Chain. Masa appears to be the first soulbound token protocol available on Ethereum."

        "title": "Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem explained - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "How does Bitcoin DeFi work? Wrapped tokens like Wrapped Bitcoin, layer-1 blockchains like Stacks, and sidechains like Rootstock enable DeFi on Bitcoin. The scripting language used by Bitcoin, termed Script, is not Turing complete, which means it is deficient in several logical operations, such as loops. As a result, the Bitcoin network supports limited programmability despite the Taproot upgrade, meaning that Bitcoin DeFi platforms rely on layer-2 scaling solutions and sidechains to host their smart contracts. DeFi on Bitcoin is made possible through wrapped tokens like Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), layer-1 blockchains like Stacks and sidechains like Rootstock. For instance, wBTC, an Ethereum token introduced in January 2019, is backed one-to-one by Bitcoin (BTC), meaning that one wBTC is always equivalent to 1 BTC. Users can engage with several of Ethereum\u2019s DApps using the wBTC token. An independent layer-1 blockchain called Stacks makes hundreds of billions of dollars in capital in BTC available and offers Bitcoin holders new ways to use and profit from the cryptocurrency. It uses a proof-of-transfer consensus mechanism, which secures its blockchain by utilizing Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work blockchain. DeFi products like the Stackswap DEX leverage the Stacks blockchain to allow users to trade and mint NFTs, borrow algorithmic stablecoins, and launch and exchange tokens on the Bitcoin network. Additionally, since Stacks and Bitcoin are linked, NFTs created on Stacks settle to and are secured by the Bitcoin blockchain. Turing-complete smart contracts are made possible on the Bitcoin blockchain by Rootstock, which runs parallel to the blockchain. When BTC is sent to Rootstock, it transforms into RBTC, a smart contract-enabled Bitcoin. Based on bidirectional communication, this protocol serves as a bridge to connect both chains. For instance, Sovryn, one of the first permissionless financial apps, utilizes RSK\u2019s technology to connect to the Lightning Network, Ethereum, Bitcoin and BNB Smart Chain.\n\nWhich DeFi projects are part of the Bitcoin ecosystem? Besides wBTC, Stacks and Rootstock, BadgerDAO, RenVM and Liquid Network promote various use cases of Bitcoin DeFi. BadgerDAO A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called BadgerDAO makes it possible for BTC to be utilized as collateral across various DApps. The BadgerDAO uses the Ethereum-based token BADGER for protocol governance and incentive distribution. Users can earn income on their synthetic BTC assets using Sett Vaults, the first product offered by Badger. Users can lock up their tokenized Bitcoin in SETTs, which are pools of tokens, and let smart contracts manage their holdings to produce a yield in the form of bTokens. The second product from Badger, called Digg, is software that controls the elastic-supply cryptocurrency called the DIGG token, pegged to the price of BTC in United States dollars. Like any other token, DIGG can be deposited into SETTs to provide a yield for its holders and used in DeFi protocols. RenVM The decentralized Ethereum protocol Ren creates tokens that monitor the value of non-Ethereum assets such as Bitcoin and offers liquidity to projects on several blockchains. That said, Bitcoin holders may utilize Ren (needed to pay nodes) to access Ethereum\u2019s array of DeFi products without selling their BTC or moving their assets across blockchains. The Ren virtual machine holds the original funds in storage, accepts tokens from one blockchain, and generates new tokens on another through its RenBridge to exchange assets between blockchains. For example, a user may submit BTC to the RenVM, which would issue renBTC, a new token on Ethereum that would reflect the original Bitcoin, meaning when the user wants to get their Bitcoin back, the transaction may be reversed. Liquid Network The Liquid Network is a layer-2 Bitcoin solution and an inter-exchange settlement network that enables the issue of digital assets like security tokens, stablecoins and other financial instruments privately and quickly on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. LBTC, a wrapped version of Bitcoin, serves as the native token on the Liquid sidechain. Users send BTC to a Lightning Network address (a process called peg-in) on the Bitcoin network to use the Liquid Network. A similar quantity of LBTC is minted on the Liquid Network and delivered to the user\u2019s address after the transaction has received 102 confirmations. In addition, peg-out can be initiated to withdraw BTC by sending LBTC for burning to an irrecoverable address, which, when receiving two separate confirmations, lets a Lightning Network member send the original BTC to a user\u2019s Bitcoin network address."

        "title": "Here\u2019s what Bitcoin, Ethereum prices need for an explosive rally following US PPI release - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum prices rallied after US CPI data fell below expectations MoM, on January 12.\n\nEasing inflation indicates the Federal Reserve may reduce interest rate hikes, weighing on the US Dollar and helping cryptocurrencies.\n\nWednesday\u2019s Producer Price Index release could have a similar impact if data shows a drop in \u2018factory gate\u2019 prices.\n\nThe release of the latest US Producer Price Index (PPI) data, which measures factory gate price inflation, could significantly impact Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies when it is released at 13:30 GMT on Wednesday, January 18. The econometric is seen as a forewarner of more general consumer price inflation since it measures the cost of goods after production, or the \u2018wholesale\u2019 price.\n\nWill US Producer Price Index follow US CPI course?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum prices witnessed a recovery after the release of US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data on January 12 showed an unexpected -0.1% fall in December on a month-over-month (MoM) basis. The data prompted a decline in the US Dollar and a rally in risk assets including many leading cryptocurrencies. This canceled out losses from the FTX exchange collapse and the DCG-Gemini scandal that have dogged the sector since November.\n\nThe question is, will the same thing happen when US PPI is released later today? And what exactly are the implications for cryptocurrencies from the data?\n\nAlso read: Will US CPI release whipsaw Bitcoin price to $16,500?\n\nUS PPI and CPI over the years\n\nEffect of PPI on the US Dollar and cryptocurrencies\n\nUS Producer Price Index is expected to come out at 6.8% on a yearly basis and -0.1% on a monthly basis for December, based on surveys of economists.\n\nThe greatest impact on the US Dollar and cryptocurrencies will result from an unexpected rise in PPI. This is because market expectations are tilted towards expecting lower inflation, especially after December Consumer Price Index showed an unexpected decline during the same month, therefore a rise would take the market by surprise.\n\nImportant US economic data releases expected on Wednesday\n\nIf the US Producer Price Index reading is significantly higher than the consensus (more than 0.1% MoM or 0.2% YoY) then this could result in a substantial rally in the US Dollar and a fall in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices. This is because it will mean the US Federal Reserve (Fed) may have to continue to implement aggressive interest rate hikes to curb inflation and this will support the US Dollar which is inversely correlated to cryptocurrencies (because they are priced in US Dollars).\n\nIf the PPI data meets consensus expectations, asset prices will probably remain largely unaffected, though there may be a slightly positive impact on the US Dollar and a negative impact on cryptocurrencies since the official survey expectations are now a bit out-of-date and do not factor in recent data, such as the below-expected CPI data released six days ago, on January 12.\n\nA below-expectations result, especially if it is greater than the 0.1% divergence seen in the CPI release, would likely result in a fall in the value of the US Dollar and a rally in Bitcoin, Ethereum and many other altcoin prices.\n\nWhat is the Bitcoin chart saying before the release?\n\nBitcoin price has risen sharply in January 2023, after plummeting to new lows following the FTX crisis last November. The leading crypto has rallied from $15,479 on November 21 to a new high of $21,594 on Tuesday, January 17 (yesterday).\n\n\n\nThere are indications the short-to-medium trend has changed for Bitcoin, after the break above the critical November 5 high $21,473, the last lower high before BTC bottomed, achieved this week. This break is a major sign the broader downtrend could be reversing.\n\nBTC/USD price chart\n\nOn its way up in January, Bitcoin price has broken above all the key moving averages: the 50, 100 and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), and this is a further sign it could be reversing its longer-term downtrend.\n\nBTC is overbought, however, according to the Relative Strength Index (RSI) which is currently well above 70 on the daily chart. RSI can remain in overbought states for some time before the market starts pulling back and, according to Welles Wilder, the market technician who designed the indicator, it is not until it has exited overbought and re-entered neutral territory, below 70, that a firm signal to sell can be inferred. Whilst it is in overbought, however, Wilder advised traders not to add to their longs. On the 4-hour chart above, however, the RSI has already fallen below 70, providing traders with a sell signal, and suggesting the possibility of a pullback on that timeframe.\n\nA lower-than-anticipated or same-as-expected PPI, therefore, would certainly fall into line with the bullish narrative reflected in the charts, however, given the asset is already overbought, it could also have no effect or even a slightly bearish impact if the data continues to show lingering inflation. Prices rarely rise in a straight line and BTC price is certainly overdue a little correction."

        "content": "The \"Fear and Greed Index\" for second largest cryptocurrency ETH has entered the zone of greed, showing 70.\n\nThis index is one of the ways to determine social sentiment on the crypto market. Aside from evaluating the market, the index, depending on its value, may help predict a possible move of crypto prices.\n\nEthereum price may reverse soon, data suggests\n\nWhen the index is in the fear zone (or even extreme fear), this means that investors could be buying a crypto \u2013 Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. \u2013 at the moment. When it shows 70, as now, it means Ethereum is in fear territory. This and the even worse designation of extreme fear show that the market might be in for correction.\n\nOver the period of the past 24 hours, the native token of the second most popular crypto jumped by 3.62%, hitting a local high of $1,596. A drop by nearly 2% then followed, pushing ETH down to $1,571.\n\nEthereum Fear and Greed Index @EthereumFear Ethereum Fear and Greed Index is 70 ~ Greed Current price: $1,566https://t.co/kvIBEIGPFEhttps://t.co/F4eTo2X4l2 pic.twitter.com/ZDESo8fa04\n\nWhales bet on $400 per ETH\n\nAs covered by U.Today earlier, several anonymous whales had bought 26,000 ETH put options with a strike price of $400, betting on ETH to go down that much. The options will expire on June 30. Unlike call options, put options allow investors to sell an underlying asset at a strike price they bet on, even if the asset drops lower. This bearish bet might be based on the Shanghai upgrade that is set to launch in February. Among other things, the upgrade will allow stakers to move their staked Ether out of the Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract.\n\nStill, despite this bearish bet, Santiment on-chain data aggregator believes that Ethereum still has a chance of rising and catching up with its previous all-time high close to the $5,000 level.\n\nThe team of analysts believes that after Ethereum reached the aforementioned historic peak, it got hit due to extremely high transaction fees of $60. Now that these fees have dropped to merely $2, the price has surged once again, Santiment believes."

        "content": "Well, that was quick. Less than two weeks after cryptocurrencies hit a nadir in the wake of the FTX collapse, Bitcoin has rallied 25% amid speculation the cryptocurrency selloff late last year was too much and too fast.\n\nKey Takeaways With Bitcoin gaining 25% and Ether jumping 20% in the past week, there's a bullish sentiment across the market.\n\nThe fall in inflation contributed to the recent rise in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\nThe market has breached $1 trillion for the first time since the FTX collapse in November.\n\nBitcoin Gains Momentum\n\nWhen Consumer Price Index (CPI) report came last week that inflation is cooling off in most of the U.S. economy, Bitcoin hit a two-month high at $18,856, up 8%, as investors hoped that the Federal Reserve would reverse, or at least soften its rate hike policy. This suggests that Bitcoin is also becoming macro now, no longer a hedge against inflation.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin mining difficulty rose more than 10% to 37.59 trillion from 34.09 trillion on Sunday, a new all-time high. The difficulty of mining tends to increase when a blockchain network grows and is a sign of increased activity. The flagship cryptocurrency jumped traded at $21,130 at 11: 30 PM, New York time.\n\nEthereum Upgrade is on Horizon\n\nEther, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain network, gained over 17% in the past week, trading at $1,568 at 11: 30 PM, New York time. Apart from macroeconomic factors, the upcoming Shanghai upgrade on the network that allows users to withdraw their staked Ether has also contributed to this momentum.\n\nSimply put, the Shangahi upgrade follows 'The Merge' that shifted the Ethereum blockchain network from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in September 2022. A tentative timeline of March 2023 has been set for the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nBesides Bitcoin and Ethereum gains, Avalanche, NEAR, Aave, Polkadot, and Solana also surged over the past two weeks, helping the crypto market reclaim $1 trillion.\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe surge in the market has given investors hope that crypto will continue to flourish despite layoffs and bankruptcy. Even a banking giant like Bank of America believes cryptos are the future and a new form of payment as it will likely change ''how and when value is transferred over the next 15 years.''\n\nAs the markets rebound, inflation cools, and signs of economic stability return, traders are optimistic about the resurgence of the crypto bull market.\n\n"

Though we are seeing the same tendencies today, the amount of wrapped Bitcoins on the Ethereum network is not rising, which we might consider a bearish signal.\n\nMarket manipulation?\n\nAt the end of this rally on the market, numerous analysts and traders assumed that market manipulation was one of the main reasons behind such explosive performance of Bitcoin and other assets. One of their main proofs was abnormal open interest on most cryptocurrency derivatives trading platforms.\n\nWith the lack of growing demand on Ethereum, which usually occurs after a noteworthy move of BTC, market manipulation could be a solid theory behind the market's 10% spike. Unfortunately, if the assumptions of analysts are true, the first cryptocurrency will reverse in the foreseeable future and reach the $19,500 trading range."

        "title": "Top 4 Cryptocurrencies to Buy and Hold for 2023 and Beyond - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Crypto prices crashed hard in 2022 as the previously up-and-coming sector ran into new headwinds like rising interest rates and the implosion of some large players, such as FTX.\n\nBeneath the surface, there were still reasons for optimism. The Bitcoin (BTC 0.70%) network stayed operational 24/7 with no downtime, remained impervious to hacks, and successfully processed billions of dollars of daily transactions.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum (ETH 0.26%) developers successfully pulled off The Merge, Ethereum's transition from proof of work to proof of stake, an engineering feat that some observers compared to changing out the engine of an airliner in mid-flight. Other cryptocurrencies like Tron (TRX -1.01%) served a purpose for people all over the world, while Solana (SOL -0.84%) might benefit from a new product introduction.\n\n1. Bitcoin\n\nAs mentioned above, the Bitcoin network stood strong in 2022, processing billions of dollars of transactions daily while being fully operational 24/7. There is plenty to look forward to in 2023. Although some observers feel that Bitcoin has fallen behind smart contract platforms like Ethereum, Bitcoin developers are working on an upgrade called Taro that could allow Bitcoin users to mint assets such as non-fungible tokens (NFT) and stablecoins on the Bitcoin blockchain, which would bring a new wave of enthusiasm to the oldest and largest cryptocurrency.\n\nAt the same time, a new protocol called Machankura, which was developed by an African developer named Kgothatso Ngako, is making Bitcoin accessible to more people than ever. The service, which allows people to send and receive Bitcoin via text message, is a boon in Africa where many people have cellphones that are not internet-enabled, meaning that Machankura has the potential to bring accessibility to Bitcoin to millions of more users.\n\n2. Ethereum\n\nAs mentioned above, Ethereum switched to proof-of-stake in 2022, which reduced its carbon footprint by more than 99% and made it easier than ever for even casual Ethereum users to earn rewards for participating in the Ethereum network. Ethereum users can now use a third-party service like Lido Finance, Coinbase, or Rocket Pool to stake their Ethereum -- basically locking it up to process transactions and secure the network.\n\nUsers seamlessly earn staking fees with interest rates of between 3.87% and 4.6%, depending on which of these pools they are using, with no minimum amount of Ethereum required to get started. These yields are competitive with those of dividend stocks and Treasury bonds, and require minimal effort or technical know-how to get started.\n\nAlthough The Merge was a milestone for Ethereum in 2022, Ethereum isn't done making improvements. In two months, Ethereum is tentatively scheduled for its next big upgrade, Shanghai, which will allow users to withdraw their staked Ethereum. This will give users increased liquidity and remove much of the risk around staking -- investors will be able to withdraw their staked Ethereum if they want to trade it or need the money, as opposed to locking it in for an indefinite time period, which is the case now.\n\n3. Tron\n\nAlthough crypto discourse can often wander into philosophical debate, these pontificators often forget that most people simply want a product that works and is cost-efficient. That's exactly what they are getting with Tron. Tron is fast, it gets user's money from point A to point B safely and reliably, and it is remarkably cheap -- fees on Tron cost less than a penny.\n\nThere is something to be said for this type of simplicity and reliability, and that's why people all over the world are using Tron. There are now more than 130 million Tron accounts, and the Tron blockchain has processed 4.6 billion transactions worth over $6.3 trillion since its inception.\n\nTron is particularly popular with users in emerging markets who want to transact in dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the past 24 hours, more than 2 million transfers using Tether were sent and received on the Tron blockchain, showing that Tron is a key cog in the economic engine of much of the developing world. As people all over the globe continue to use Tron for its simplicity and reliability, it is a good cryptocurrency to have exposure to over the long term.\n\n4. Solana\n\nWhile all cryptocurrencies took heavy losses in 2022, few had a worse year than Solana, which fell more than 94% from its high of $260 in November 2021 and was barely able to stay above $10 by year-end. In addition to the challenges that all cryptocurrencies faced, Solana dealt with additional headwinds in the form of the bankruptcy of crypto exchange FTX. FTX, its founder Sam Bankman-Fried, and his Alameda Research hedge fund were heavy investors in Solana and many tokens within the Solana universe. For example, Solana and Serum (a Solana token) made up a large portion of the assets on FTX's balance sheet.\n\nBut as the calendar turned to 2023, Solana started to fight back and it has more than doubled since Jan. 1. I don't think it's realistic to expect Solana's rally to continue at this scorching pace all year, but clearly a sense of optimism has returned to Solana and it doesn't seem unreasonable to think that it will chalk up a decent gain for the year.\n\nThe excitement over a new dog-themed meme coin called Bonk, which was AirDropped to many Solana users, is a large part of what's driving the rally. Although it's a silly name and it may not have long-term staying power (at one point Bonk had gained over 3,000% after launching, but then fell more than 50% in a 24-hour period), it seems to have propelled a wave of activity on the Solana blockchain and ushered in a new era of enthusiasm, helping it move past the aftermath of the FTX collapse.\n\nLike Tron, Solana is a fast and cheap blockchain, and a lot of people are using it. Solana has processed more than 130 billion transactions and right now, it is processing well over 3,300 transactions per second. Like Tron, Solana charges negligible fees.\n\nWhile 2020-2021 was an incredible time for crypto, I think it would be unreasonable for investors to expect those types of gains in 2023, or even further out. However, with the progress that these cryptocurrencies are making, I think that it's entirely reasonable to expect that they will finish 2023 up. With slow and steady progress, and gains that are more sustainable than in the past, it would be a welcome change after what crypto investors endured last year."

        "title": "2 Cryptocurrencies to Buy and Hold Forever - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's no secret that the crypto market has been hit hard over the past year, and the recent FTX scandal has certainly not helped.\n\nHowever, there's still reason to be optimistic about the sector's future. Crypto as a whole is still relatively new, and downturns -- even severe ones -- are not necessarily uncommon. By riding out the storm and waiting until the recovery period, you could potentially see lucrative returns.\n\nIt's critical, though, to choose the right investments. Many cryptocurrencies may not survive this slump, and investing in the wrong places could be costly. While there are never any guarantees in crypto, there are two cryptocurrencies I'm buying and holding forever.\n\n1. Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin (BTC 0.59%) is the oldest cryptocurrency, which means it also has the longest history of recovering from downturns. It's faced some nasty slumps in the past, too -- some of which make this crash seem mild.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin is down close to 70% from its high in late 2021. Back in 2018, though, it fell by more than 80% over the course of the year. Between July 2014 and January 2015, it dropped by 72%. Along the way, it's also experienced many smaller drops of \"only\" 30% to 40% from its peak.\n\nWhile past performance doesn't predict future returns, it is promising that Bitcoin has been able to recover from so many crashes. And despite all of this extreme volatility, it's still up more than 30,000% since 2013. No other asset has even come close to these types of returns, especially over just one decade.\n\nTo be fair, it will be tough for Bitcoin to experience these same returns over the next 10 years. But many experts have big expectations for the crypto, with some predicting it could reach $100,000 per token or more in the coming years. Whether that will actually happen is unclear right now, but if Bitcoin's past is any indication, it's far too early to count it out just yet.\n\n2. Ethereum\n\nEthereum (ETH 0.12%) has fallen by around 68% from its high, but it has plenty of long-term potential.\n\nPerhaps Ethereum's biggest advantage is its diversity. It's more than just a cryptocurrency; it's a smart-contract network that hosts a wide variety of applications.\n\nNot only is Ethereum the largest platform for non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces, but it's also the most popular blockchain for metaverse applications. It can also host other cryptocurrencies (Shiba Inu, for instance, is built on Ethereum), and because it's an open-source blockchain, developers can build new applications on the network, too.\n\nIf any of these areas thrive -- whether it's NFTs, the metaverse, another crypto, or some other application that hasn't been developed yet -- Ethereum will benefit. By investing in Ethereum, then, you're essentially diversifying into multiple areas of the crypto sector.\n\nIn short, Ethereum is the go-to blockchain for decentralized applications (dApps). Many experts predict that dApps will be a game-changer in the crypto space, and if that's true, Ethereum could be poised for serious growth.\n\nIs now the right time to invest in crypto?\n\nDespite all its potential, cryptocurrency is still inherently risky. All crypto is speculative at the moment, and nobody can say for certain how it will fare over the coming years. There's still a chance that the entire sector could fail, and even the strongest investments may not survive.\n\nBefore you buy, then, make sure you're willing to tolerate a higher level of risk. Don't invest any money you're not prepared to potentially lose, and double-check that the rest of your portfolio is well-diversified to limit as much risk as possible.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum won't be the right investments for everyone, and there are no guarantees that they'll succeed. But they have some of the most potential of any cryptocurrencies right now, so there's still reason to be optimistic about their futures."

Kava has spent the last year building a deep integration with Coinbase that optimizes the process for Cosmos SDK chains to integrate with Coinbase helping to drive new liquidity to the Cosmos ecosystem.\n\nUnlocking Cosmos liquidity\n\nCoinbase's native integration with Kava allows for easy listing of Kava ecosystem projects, KAVA staking on Coinbase, and unlocks DeFi usage for Coinbase users on Kava. Additionally, Kava worked with the Coinbase team to make it significantly easier for Cosmos chains to list on the exchange, unlocking access to liquidity for Cosmos projects and further driving the adoption and growth of the entire Cosmos ecosystem. The entire process whittles the timeline for integrating Cosmos SDK chains to Coinbase from 12-18 months to a single month. Cosmos chains can now be integrated as easily as ERC-20 tokens. A major step forward to increasing liquidity within the Cosmos Ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting to see Kava listed on the largest US-regulated exchange. Coinbase sets the standard as the most important on-ramp for new users and capital into the blockchain ecosystem. I look forward to growing Kava\u2019s exposure to new users, which will have downstream effects for all protocols in the Kava Rise program and the Cosmos ecosystem.\u201d \u2014 Scott Stuart, CEO of Kava Labs\n\nFueling protocol growth with Kava Rise\n\nKava was built from the ground up to optimize its resources for protocol growth, strengthened by its Cosmos-EVM technology that enables maximum scalability, speed, security, and developer support. In 2022, Kava combined on-chain and off-chain growth mechanisms into a single developer incentive program called Kava Rise.\n\nKava Rise aims to set a new standard for enabling growth and demand for thousands of Web3 protocols. Builders earn a share of Kava Rise's $750M developer incentive fund via the program's blockchain-based distribution method, designed to reward the top protocols every month based on usage. More than 50 protocols like Curve Finance, Sushi, and Beefy Finance have collectively brought more than $15M TVL into the ecosystem, showcasing the program\u2019s ability to enable protocols to grow and thrive regardless of market conditions.\n\nAbout Kava\n\nKava charges Web3 growth with the best on-chain incentives and Cosmos-EVM sidechain tech.

        "content": "A hash tree, also known as a Merkle tree, is a tree in which each leaf node is labeled with the cryptographic hash of a data block, and each non-leaf node is labeled with the cryptographic hash of its child nodes' labels. The majority of hash tree implementations are binary (each node has two child nodes), but they can also have many more child nodes.\n\nBut what actually is the Merkle tree in Blockchain, and how it is used in Blockchain? So, if you want to know the answer to all these questions, then you are in the right place.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nWhat Is a Merkle Tree?\n\nMerkle trees, also known as Binary hash trees, are a prevalent sort of data structure in computer science.\n\nIn bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, they're used to encrypt blockchain data more efficiently and securely.\n\nIt's a mathematical data structure made up of hashes of various data blocks that summarize all the transactions in a block.\n\nIt also enables quick and secure content verification across big datasets and verifies the consistency and content of the data.\n\nWhat Is a Merkle Root?\n\nA Merkle root is a simple mathematical method for confirming the facts on a Merkle tree.\n\nThey're used in cryptocurrency to ensure that data blocks sent through a peer-to-peer network are whole, undamaged, and unaltered.\n\nThey play a very crucial role in the computation required to keep cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether running.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nCryptographic Hash Functions\n\nA hash function maps any type of arbitrary data of any length to a fixed-size output. It is commonly used in cryptography since it is a cryptographic function.\n\nThey are efficient and are well-known for one property: they are irreversible. It's a one-way function that's only meant to work in one direction.\n\nSome of the Hash families available are Message Direct (MD), Secure Hash Function (SHF), and RIPE Message Direct (RIPEMD).\n\nNow, take an example, if you use the SHA256 hash algorithm and pass 101Blockchains as input, you will get the following output\n\nfbffd63a60374a31aa9811cbc80b577e23925a5874e86a17f712bab874f33ac9\n\nIn conclusion, these are the following key properties of the hash function:\n\nDeterministic\n\nPre-Image Resistant\n\nComputationally Efficient\n\nCannot be Reversed Engineered\n\nCollision Resistant\n\nWorking of Merkle Trees\n\nA Merkle tree totals all transactions in a block and generates a digital fingerprint of the entire set of operations, allowing the user to verify whether it includes a transaction in the block.\n\nMerkle trees are made by hashing pairs of nodes repeatedly until only one hash remains; this hash is known as the Merkle Root or the Root Hash.\n\nThey're built from the bottom, using Transaction IDs, which are hashes of individual transactions.\n\nEach non-leaf node is a hash of its previous hash, and every leaf node is a hash of transactional data.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nNow, look at a little example of a Merkle Tree in Blockchain to help you understand the concept.\n\nConsider the following scenario: A, B, C, and D are four transactions, all executed on the same block. Each transaction is then hashed, leaving you with:\n\nHash A\n\nHash B\n\nHash C\n\nHash D\n\nThe hashes are paired together, resulting in:\n\nHash AB\n\nand\n\nHash CD\n\nAnd therefore, your Merkle Root is formed by combining these two hashes: Hash ABCD.\n\nIn reality, a Merkle Tree is much more complicated (especially when each transaction ID is 64 characters long). Still, this example helps you have a good overview of how the algorithms work and why they are so effective.\n\nBenefits of Merkle Tree in Blockchain\n\nMerkle trees provide four significant advantages -\n\nValidate the data's integrity: It can be used to validate the data's integrity effectively.\n\nTakes little disk space: Compared to other data structures, the Merkle tree takes up very little disk space.\n\nTiny information across networks: Merkle trees can be broken down into small pieces of data for verification.\n\nEfficient Verification: The data format is efficient, and verifying the data's integrity takes only a few moments.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nWhy Is It Essential to Blockchain?\n\nThink of a blockchain without Merkle Trees to get a sense of how vital they are for blockchain technology. Let\u2019s have one of Bitcoin because its use of Merkle Trees is essential for the cryptocurrency and easier to grasp.\n\nIf Bitcoin didn't include Merkle Trees, per se, every node on the network would have to retain a complete copy of every single Bitcoin transaction ever made. One can imagine how much information that would be.\n\nAny authentication request on Bitcoin would require an enormous amount of data to be transferred over the network: therefore, you'll need to validate the data on your own.\n\nTo confirm that there were no modifications, a computer used for validation would need a lot of computing power to compare ledgers.\n\nMerkle Trees are a solution to this issue. They hash records in accounting, thereby separating the proof of data from the data itself.\n\nProving that giving tiny amounts of information across the network is all that is required for a transaction to be valid.\n\nFurthermore, it enables you to demonstrate that both ledger variations are identical in terms of nominal computer power and network bandwidth.\n\nUse-Cases of Merkle Tree in Blockchain\n\nThere are more Merkle tree implementations out there.\n\nGit, a distributed version control system, is one of the most widely used. It is used to handle projects by programmers from all around the world.\n\nInterplanetary File System, a peer-to-peer distributed protocol, is another suitable implementation. It's also open-source, allowing computers to join and use a centralized file system.\n\nIt's part of the technique that generates verifiable certificate transparency logs.\n\nAmazon DynamoDB and Apache Cassandra use it during the data replication process. These No-SQL distributed databases use Merkle trees to control discrepancies.\n\nDecipher the global craze surrounding Blockchain with the Blockchain Certification Training Course. Get trained today.\n\nConclusion\n\nMerkle Tree is an essential fundamental of Blockchain technology, enabling its growth in the IT World. Simplilearn's Blockchain Certification Training was designed for developers who want to decipher the global craze surrounding Blockchain, Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and many other technologies like Merkle Tree. You'll learn the core structure and technical mechanisms of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger, Dogecoin, and Multichain Blockchain platforms and their underlying technologies.\n\nHope you liked the tutorial on Merkle Tree in Blockchain, in case of any doubts, please ask your questions in the comment section below."

        "content": "Ethereum price prediction from a previous analysis ETH Has Barely Moved All Week! What is Happening?\n\nIn our previous Ethereum analysis, ETH Has Barely Moved All Week! What is Happening? we identified the ETH Flag Pattern that was currently forming in the 4-hour timeframe and warned our readers that Ethereum might be setting up for a massive move soon!\n\nThis Flag pattern is very unique because the price can either break to the upside or downside. And right now, we are seeing what looks like a breakdown to the downside for the Altcoin price.\n\nIn this Ethereum analysis, we will be taking a closer look at this breakdown and trying to understand if this might be a fake-out. We will also be talking about the key levels we are currently watching in the 4-hour timeframe.\n\nTo trade ETH with leverage, sign-up to Bybit right now!

Is This A Price Break Down Or A Fake Out? Watch this key level in the 4-hour timeframe\n\nThe most important level for the Flag Pattern right now is the $1,503 key support level. This is the level the Ethereum bears need to push the price below for us to confirm the start of a possible move lower for the Altcoin.\n\nBut right now, we have seen Ethereum deep below this $1,503 key support level in the 4-hour timeframe and bounce from it! This price bounce shows that the bulls are still fighting to hold on to this uptrend and if this level continues to get respected, we might see Ethereum find support and begin to rally from this region in the coming days.\n\nWarning! Is This A Price Break Down Or A Fake Out? Watch this key level in the 4-hour timeframe\n\nSo for now it is important to stand aside and wait for the $1,503 key support to be broken before jumping to any bearish conclusion (this is the best way to avoid getting faked out in this move).\n\nWhat Happens If Ethereum Continues To Sell Off?\n\nIf the Ethereum bears can manage to push the ETH price below the $1,503 key support, there is a very high probability that we might see more bearish follow-through happen in the coming days.\n\nThis bearish follow-through would likely push the Altcoin price back down to the Descending Channel Pattern we broke out of early this year.\n\nWarning! Is This A Price Break Down Or A Fake Out? Watch this key level in the 4-hour timeframe\n\nFinal Verdict!\n\nRight now, we are watching the $1,503 key support in the 4-hour timeframe to see if the bears can successfully push the Altcoin price below this key level in the coming days.\n\nIf this happens, there is a very high probability that we might see more sell-off in Ethereum for the rest of the week. However, if this $1,503 support holds, this initial sell-off might just be a bearish fakeout to catch traders off guard.\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nEasy Steps From Beginner To Pro Crypto Trader\n\nYou can speed up your learning journey by reading our How To Trade Bitcoin Guide.

Users must commit at least 32 ETH as an initial investment to become validators.\n\nThe Ethereum Beacon Chain has currently locked all the Staked Ether (stETH). validators can withdraw their staked money after the Shanghai upgrade, including any applicable staking incentives for validating network transactions.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Devs Target March 2023 for Staked ETH Withdrawals\n\nA few days back it was announced that the public testnet for the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade has been alluded to happen by the February end. At the meeting, core developers decided against adding Ethereum Virtual Machine Object Format (EOF).\n\nStaking platforms like Lido and RocketPool offer liquid staking alternatives that enable users to get stETH or rETH in exchange for their staked assets.\n\nConsenSys revealed last week that MetaMask has joined forces with Lido and Rocketpool so that users could stake with either service and receive stETH and rETH right inside the wallet app."

        "title": "Ethereum Full Steam Ahead to Shanghai Update - This Morning On Chain",
        "content": "The Ethereum all developer call confirmed that Shanghai is on track for release, but that's only because of what they cut.\n\nThis week, Ethereum developers met to hold their frequent \u201call developer call\u201d where they discuss the progress they\u2019re making on the blockchain. This time there was a focus on the upcoming Shanghai update, which will allow stakers to recover their staked ETH.\n\nThe news from this call was positive, but with a few caveats. Shanghai is currently expected to roll out in March, and some developers have said they\u2019re not aware of any issues that could push back the release date. That\u2019s a big deal for Ethereum, as right now there are some $23B locked up in Ethereum staking that can\u2019t be withdrawn. That\u2019s a whopping 16M ETH.\n\nDevelopers recently launched their devnet2, an internal testing environment for them to validate that the new version of Ethereum is working without bugs. The deployment worked with some minor bugs, though they were reportedly within their expectations. The developers are expecting to release the first full public testnet in February.\n\nThe downside here is why the Shanghai update is easy to predict\u2013they\u2019ve delayed most of the major items that had previously been planned for this update. There were plans to increase efficiency and decrease cost of layer 2 transactions on Ethereum by a mechanism called \u201cproto-danksharding.\u201d Yep, that\u2019s what they called it. Ethereum devs also pushed back planned work on the Ethereum Virtual Machine, the mechanism that settles smart contracts.\n\nOn the plus side, Ethereum is getting un-staking capabilities ASAP, and it will come in a very low risk manner. As with any technical changes, the fewer changes there are, the easier it is to catch all of the possible bugs in the code. I think after the time it took for the team to roll out The Merge, it\u2019s a good idea to show a little momentum and push out high visibility features quickly to continue rebuilding trust in the development team."

        "content": "As the crypto developer ecosystem expands, major ecosystems outside of the top two cryptocurrencies \u2014 Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 are growing, according to a new report.\n\nAbout 72% of monthly active developers (devs) are working on blockchains that are not part of the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks, according to the 2022 Electric Capital Developer Report, which trawled code commits across open source repositories.\n\nSolana saw the highest number of new developers contributing to the ecosystem, with its developer count rising by 83%, the fastest of any major blockchain. Compared to that, Polygon saw a 40% rise in developer count, Cosmos saw 25% and Polkadot saw 2%, the report showed.\n\n\u201cDevelopers will build where they see technology advantages, and Solana delivers faster transactions and lower costs than alternatives,\u201d Solana co-founder Raj Gokal told TechCrunch. \u201cBut they will also build where they see other kinds of advantages, such as an active community.\u201d\n\nThe growth of the developer ecosystem on Solana can be attributed to a mix of education efforts and resources, community engagement, technical advantages and business opportunities, Gokal said.\n\nEven with around 2,000 total developers as of December 2022, Solana is still about 3,500 developers short of Ethereum\u2019s count, which had a total of about 5,700 developers. It\u2019s important to note, though, that Ethereum launched in 2013 and Solana launched in 2018, so the former has enjoyed a five-year head start.\n\nThese Solana developers are working on \u201ca range of use cases,\u201d from evolving the NFT and DeFi spaces to getting retailers to experiment with decentralized payment rails like Solana Pay, Gokal said. \u201cRight now, game devs on Solana are very active and innovating heavily to create games that are both fun to play and rewarding for players to participate.\u201d\n\nSeparately, The Solana Mobile Stack and Saga phone are attracting attention from developers interested in creating mobile web3 apps, Gokal added. \u201cThe mobile opportunities on Solana will only get better as Saga and SMS get exposed to more people.\u201d\n\nSolana, which is approaching its fifth birthday, has the highest number of developers since it was launched compared to other blockchains, according to a chart (shown below) from Electric Capital.\n\nSolana\u2019s total developer count spiked in November 2022 during its Breakpoint conference and hackathon event. In comparison, Polygon has roughly half the developers but has existed for around the same time.\n\n\u201cThe creation of new technologies at different times naturally brings about different use cases and opportunities,\u201d Gokal said. \u201cSolana is a high-performance blockchain where transactions are inexpensive and fast to settle. There will continue to be use cases for other networks, but speed, efficiency and low costs usually always attract the most activity.\u201d\n\nAccording to Solana Beach data, Solana\u2019s network can currently execute 3,531 transactions per second (TPS). The TPS measures a network\u2019s speed and scalability while showing the maximum number of transactions the blockchain can carry out \u2014 if needed. In comparison, Ethereum averages about 15 TPS.\n\nGokal said Solana Foundation will continue to host hackathons and hacker houses to help get more devs get involved. But this year might be different.\n\n\u201c2023 might just be the year when other devs already building on Solana collectively lead the direction of the network. We\u2019ve already seen that with a community-led hackathon happening right now and more devs are stepping forward to contribute to the core Solana network,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier last year, there was more hope in the crypto community that it was in a temporary downturn, but sentiments have changed.\n\n\u201cI think people fully understand the extent to which macroeconomic conditions have deteriorated across all aspects of the economy and that there are bigger issues at play, such as inflation,\u201d Gokal said. \u201cPeople now seem mentally prepared for an extended bearish period, which is the best time to experiment and find product-market fit.\u201d\n\nAfter crypto exchange FTX collapsed in November, there was a lot of uncertainty across the space, Gokal noted. \u201c[It] quickly gave way to an understanding that the ecosystem is bigger than any one individual.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith all that in mind, as well as the Solana network performing better than ever, the time is now for devs to really dream up new use cases and build them,\u201d Gokal added."

However, the way Polygon did it raised questions about the network's decentralization stance and its organizational structure. There has already been some debate in the Polygon community about whether the hard fork was necessary. On Twitter, the crypto community criticized Polygon, calling it a centralized network and asking questions\u2013 how decentralized is decentralized finance, DeFi?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIt's not the first time a decentralized network has come under fire for its centralized nature. In 2021, Uniswap, the popular Ethereum-based decentralized exchange, was criticized for delisting tokens without voting or consulting its members, raising questions about how much control creators can have in crypto.\n\n"

This crypto lending subsidiary of the Digital Currency Group has been attempting to raise funds to maintain liquidity ever since FTX\u2019s collapse caused it to halt withdrawals in November 2022.\n\nGenesis in confidential negotiations with creditors\n\nAccording to a report by Bloomberg, Genesis Global Capital has engaged multiple creditor groups in negotiations amid liquidity issues that have spilled over to parent firm Digital Currency Group. The crypto broker had indicated in November 2022 that a bankruptcy filing may be imminent unless fresh capital was raised to sustain operations.\n\nPeople close to the matter have stated that a bankruptcy filing may not be necessary and that plans could change. As per a report by The Block, creditors of Genesis are actively involved in negotiating the terms of a possible chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.

On-chain analysis also confirms that wallets holding 100 to 10,000 ETH, have been accumulating the past two months adding 3,000 new addresses, nearly amounting to 50,000 wallets, the highest level since a year. These strong accumulation trends coupled with promising macroeconomic data concerning a lessening inflation have led to strong rallies in the equities and crypto market alike with the risk-on sentiment reignited,\u201d the CoinDCX research team told Gadgets 360.\n\nCryptocurrency is an unregulated digital currency, not a legal tender and subject to market risks.
