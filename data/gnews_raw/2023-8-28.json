        "content": "Ethereum uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that involves validators instead of miners to create and verify blocks of transactions. Therefore, validators, entities that help secure the network by staking at least 32 ETH, receive transaction fees, but not in full. They get the priority fee or the tip that users add to the base fee to entice validators to prioritize their transactions. Meanwhile, the base fee is burned, taking ETH out of circulation."

        "title": "ETH Facing Huge Decision: $1400 or $1800 Next? (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Following an unexpected and rapid drop from the $1.8K threshold, Ethereum\u2019s price experienced a significant dip, falling below the critical 100-day and 200-day moving averages (MAs).\n\nThis development is considered a significant bearish sign for ETH. However, the price managed to find support within a crucial range, hinting at the possibility of an imminent consolidation phase.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA close examination of the daily chart reveals that the price\u2019s breach beneath the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, around $1,835 and $1,800 correspondingly, caused a marked downtrend that eventually landed Ethereum\u2019s value within the pivotal support zone at $1.6K.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the 200-day moving average holds substantial significance as an indicator of prevailing market trends. Traditionally, a bearish sentiment engulfs the market when the price remains below this MA.\n\nCurrently, the $1.6K support level has proven its resilience in upholding the price, indicating the potential for a recovery and subsequent pullback. However, the recent downtrend has shifted the market\u2019s structure into a more bearish stance, thus enhancing the possibility of a retest of the $1,400 zone in the upcoming weeks.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nTurning attention to the 4-hour timeframe, it becomes evident that ETH lost the critical support point of $1.8K. This quick decline led the price to find support within the range of $1.5K, resulting in a temporary end of the prevailing downtrend.\n\nRemarkably, this support level has so far demonstrated its efficacy in maintaining the price, resulting in a period of sideways consolidation. As a consequence of this consolidation phase, Ethereum\u2019s price movement has taken on the form of a roughly symmetrical triangle pattern. This technical pattern can develop into bullish and bearish signals depending on the direction in which the pattern\u2019s breakout occurs.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum\u2019s price trajectory currently remains in a state of uncertainty, displaying no clear inclination towards an upward or downward movement. Consequently, as the price chart offers limited insights into forthcoming market trends, delving into the futures market sentiment might provide valuable insights into Ethereum\u2019s current state.\n\nThe following chart illustrates Ethereum\u2019s funding rates, a pivotal point for identifying the dominance between long traders and short sellers. Positive values align with a bullish outlook, while negative values signify a bearish stance.\n\nNotably, an apparent pattern emerges from the data. Following a sudden impulsive decline, succeeded by a consolidation phase with stagnant price action, the funding rates undertook a downward trend, forming lower peaks on the chart. This unfolding scenario hints at a lack of interest in going long in the futures market, potentially paving the way for a bearish trajectory.\n\nNonetheless, despite the prevailing bearish sentiment, there remains the possibility of a minor corrective phase preceding a more pronounced downward trend. Should the funding rates assume a negative stance, this could elevate the likelihood of a cascade of short liquidations, potentially leading to a substantial bullish rebound that propels the price upwards."

        "title": "Can You Still Mine Ethereum? ETH Mining Post-Merge Guide - AMBCrypto Blog",
        "content": "As the world of blockchain technology evolves, the Ethereum network has embarked on a significant transition from the Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism to the Proof of Stake (PoS) model. This monumental shift, often termed \u201cThe Merge,\u201d has both potential benefits and drawbacks, particularly for miners.\n\nThis comprehensive guide explores the various implications of this transition for Ethereum miners and outlines possible future pathways in the post-Merge landscape.\n\nCan you still mine Ethereum?\n\nThe answer is: No, you cannot mine Ethereum as of September 2023.\n\nEthereum has transitioned from a PoW consensus mechanism to a PoS consensus mechanism. In a PoW system, miners use specialized hardware to solve complex mathematical problems in order to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. In a PoS system, validators stake their ETH to secure the network and validate transactions.\n\nThe Merge, which was completed on September 15, 2022, was the final step in Ethereum\u2019s transition to PoS. As a result of the Merge, Ethereum mining is no longer possible.\n\nIf you are interested in participating in the Ethereum network, you can stake your ETH to become a validator. However, it is important to note that staking requires a minimum of 32 ETH, which is a significant investment.\n\nCheck out our detailed blog to stay informed about how blockchain technology plays a pivotal role in data privacy.\n\nEthereum\u2019s transition to PoS: The Merge\n\nThe Merge signifies Ethereum\u2019s transformative journey from the energy-intensive PoW consensus mechanism to the considerably more eco-friendly PoS model. The transition to PoS is part of the broader Ethereum 2.0 upgrade aimed at enhancing network security, scalability, and sustainability.\n\nWhile the PoW model requires miners to solve complex encryption problems to validate transactions and generate new Ether (ETH) coins, the PoS model will replace mining with staking.\n\nEthereum 2.0: Unpacking the benefits\n\nDespite the concerns surrounding Ethereum mining, the transition to Ethereum 2.0 brings a host of benefits. Ethereum 2.0 will significantly reduce the network\u2019s energy consumption, a crucial step towards a more sustainable future for the blockchain industry.\n\nFurthermore, the PoS model promises enhanced network security and scalability, opening up more opportunities for the ETH ecosystem\u2019s growth.\n\nWill Pepecoin survive the cryptocurrency market in 2023? Check out the odds here.\n\nWhy did Ethereum switch to PoS?\n\nThere are several reasons why Ethereum switched to PoS. Here are some of them:\n\n1. Energy efficiency\n\nThe transition to PoS was primarily driven by concerns over the energy-intensive nature of PoW. Traditional PoW mining involves powerful computers solving complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions, consuming vast amounts of electricity.\n\nIn contrast, PoS relies on validators who lock up a certain amount of cryptocurrency (in this case, ETH) as collateral to secure the network. This approach drastically reduces the energy footprint of the network, making it more sustainable and environmentally friendly.\n\n2. Enhanced security\n\nPoS networks are generally considered more secure than PoW networks. In PoW, malicious actors can attempt a 51% attack by accumulating more computational power than the rest of the network.\n\nHowever, in PoS, an attacker would need to accumulate a substantial portion of the cryptocurrency supply and lock it up as collateral. This makes such attacks significantly more expensive and economically infeasible, bolstering network security.\n\n3. Scalability\n\nPoS offers improved scalability compared to PoW. Traditional PoW blockchains often face congestion and scalability issues due to the limited capacity of miners\u2019 hardware.\n\nPoS networks can efficiently process more transactions and onboard additional validators, making them better equipped to handle increased demand and scale as needed.\n\n4. Decentralization\n\nPoS promotes greater decentralization by eliminating the need for expensive mining equipment. With PoW, mining has become concentrated in the hands of large mining pools and companies with access to substantial resources.\n\nPoS, by contrast, allows a more diverse group of participants to become validators, reducing centralization risks and ensuring a broader distribution of power within the network.\n\n5. Reduced costs\n\nPoS significantly reduces the cost barrier for participation in network maintenance. PoW requires miners to invest in specialized hardware, which can be expensive and inaccessible for many.\n\nPoS validators only need to hold a certain amount of cryptocurrency as collateral, making it a more cost-effective way for individuals and entities to contribute to the network\u2019s security and governance.\n\nLooking to learn more about blockchains? Why not build one of your own? We have covered the basics of blockchain for you in our comprehensive guide.\n\nThe impact of the Merge on Ethereum mining\n\nThe Merge was the final step in Ethereum\u2019s transition from a PoW consensus mechanism to a PoS consensus mechanism. This transition has had a significant impact on Ethereum mining, including several changes that have completely transformed the trajectory of Ethereum\u2019s future.\n\nNegative impacts\n\nThe most significant negative impact of the Merge on Ethereum mining is that it has made mining on the Ethereum network impossible. This has left many Ethereum miners without a way to earn income.\n\nAnother negative impact of the Merge on Ethereum mining is that it has reduced the demand for mining hardware. This has led to a decline in the price of mining hardware, which has hurt the mining industry as a whole.\n\nPositive impacts\n\nOne positive impact of the Merge on Ethereum mining is that it has made Ethereum more environmentally friendly. PoW mining is very energy-intensive, while PoS mining is much more energy-efficient. This means that the Ethereum network is now consuming less energy, which is good for the environment.\n\nAnother positive impact of the Merge on Ethereum mining is that it has made Ethereum more secure. PoS is more secure than PoW because it is more difficult and expensive to attack a PoS network. This makes the Ethereum network more secure for users and investors.\n\nOverall impact\n\nOverall, the Merge has had a significant impact on Ethereum mining. It has made mining on the Ethereum network impossible, reduced the demand for mining hardware, and hurt the mining industry as a whole. However, it has also made Ethereum more environmentally friendly and secure.\n\nThe proposed Ethereum hard fork: EthereumPoW\n\nIn response to the potential job losses for ETH miners due to the Merge, Chinese Ethereum miner Chandler Guo and a group of developers proposed a hard fork, EthereumPoW (ETHW), that would retain the PoW mining model.\n\nThis proposed fork could serve as a viable option for miners, as it allows them to continue mining. Notably, some large Ethereum mining pools are expected to support ETHW, and even Coinbase has indicated its willingness to consider listing the forked Ethereum.\n\nAlternatives to Ethereum mining\n\nIf you\u2019re a miner looking to mine cryptocurrencies, here are a few prominent alternatives to Ethereum for you to try out. Take a look:\n\n1. Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin, often referred to as digital gold, is the pioneer of cryptocurrencies and remains one of the most profitable coins to mine. However, it\u2019s essential to note that Bitcoin mining is now primarily performed using specialized hardware called Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs).\n\nWhile profitable, the initial investment in ASIC miners can be substantial. Miners are incentivized through block rewards and transaction fees, making Bitcoin mining lucrative, particularly in areas with low electricity costs.\n\n2. Litecoin (LTC)\n\nLitecoin is often considered the silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold. It is among the earliest cryptocurrencies and can be mined using ASICs, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nWhile it may be less profitable than Bitcoin mining, it\u2019s relatively easier and requires less specialized hardware, making it a suitable choice for those new to cryptocurrency mining.\n\n3. Dogecoin (DOGE)\n\nDogecoin started as a meme but has gained significant popularity. Unlike Bitcoin and Litecoin, Dogecoin can be mined using graphics processing units (GPUs), which are more widely available and less expensive than ASICs. While it\u2019s less profitable than Bitcoin or Litecoin, it provides an accessible entry point for miners.\n\n4. Monero (XMR)\n\nMonero is renowned for its focus on privacy and anonymity. It can be mined using GPUs or CPUs, offering a more inclusive approach to mining. Monero\u2019s mining algorithm, RandomX, is designed to be ASIC-resistant, ensuring a more level playing field.\n\nWhile it may be more challenging than some other cryptocurrencies to mine, Monero can be more profitable for those committed to privacy-centric projects.\n\n5. Ethereum Classic (ETC)\n\nEthereum Classic is the original Ethereum blockchain that continued to use the PoW consensus mechanism after Ethereum transitioned to PoS. This allows Ethereum Classic to be mined using both GPUs and ASICs. While it may not be as profitable as Ethereum once was, it can still yield returns, particularly in areas with low energy costs.\n\nThese cryptocurrencies offer various opportunities for mining, each with its own level of profitability and accessibility. The choice of which one to mine depends on factors like available hardware, electricity costs, and personal preferences.\n\nAdditionally, USDT\u2019s dominance over Tron has been skyrocketing. What does it mean? Check out our article to stay updated!\n\nThe future of Ethereum mining\n\nThe future of Ethereum mining is uncertain. Some miners have switched to mining other PoW cryptocurrencies, while others have sold their mining equipment. It is possible that Ethereum mining will continue on a smaller scale using PoW forks of Ethereum, such as Ethereum Classic.\n\nHowever, it is also possible that Ethereum mining will eventually disappear altogether. While the era of ETH mining may be drawing to a close, the transition opens up opportunities for miners to explore other cryptocurrencies and potentially contribute to the evolution of the blockchain industry.\n\nSumming up\n\nThe transition from PoW to PoS working mechanism marks a revolutionary milestone in the evolution of the blockchain industry. While it spells the end of Ethereum mining, it paves the way for more sustainable and scalable blockchain networks.\n\nFor miners, the Merge necessitates a strategic reassessment of their roles within the crypto ecosystem. Whether through mining other altcoins or supporting the proposed ETH fork, miners have opportunities to adapt and continue playing a vital role in this rapidly evolving industry."

        "title": "Charles Hoskinson Boldly Claims Cardano Will Outshine Bitcoin and Ethereum To Become Top Dog - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Charles Hoskinson has taken center stage to promote Cardano\u2019s prowess over its rivals.\n\nThe founder claimed Cardano will surpass Bitcoin and Ethereum by transcending beyond its cryptocurrency status.\n\nHoskinson could be looking too far ahead into the future as Cardano grapples with regulatory uncertainty and issues with its infrastructure.\n\nCharles Hoskinson never misses a chance to champion Cardano\u2019s superiority over established rivals like Ethereum and Bitcoin, often provoking their communities.\n\nAs the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network steadily establishes itself as a solid player in the crypto industry, particularly through its achievements in the DeFi sector, the rowdy founder is once again tooting his horn, boldly claiming that Cardano will become the top crypto project in the world.\n\nHoskinson\u2019s Bold Claims\n\nIn his keynote address at Rare Evo 2023, Charles Hoskinson shared several ambitious assertions about Cardano, its decentralization, and the broader crypto industry. During his speech, Hoskinson confidently stated that Cardano, currently the third-largest blockchain project, is poised to surpass Bitcoin and Ethereum because he believes it has higher scalability and interoperability.\n\nBacking his assertions with achievements from this year, Hoskinson highlighted Cardano\u2019s remarkable growth, with its DeFi TVL growing by 200%, the launch of scalability and interoperability solutions like Mithril and Hydra, and native assets exceeding 8 million on the network. In a more lighthearted tone, Hoskinson also playfully mentioned that Crypto data aggregator Messari is writing \u201cnice stuff about the network,\u201d implying that things look good.\n\nIn addition to its extensive list of achievements, Hoskinson proposed that Cardano could transcend beyond its cryptocurrency status and evolve into the foundation of a new digital nation. However, for this vision to materialize, the POS network has to substantially expand its user base and navigate its ongoing regulatory troubles.\n\nAs the Cardano Founder\u2019s visionary claims continue to echo, it\u2019s important to delve deeper into the question.\n\nWill Cardano Become the Top Crypto Project?\n\nWhile Charles Hoskinson confidently asserts that Cardano possesses superior scalability and interoperability compared to its more established counterparts, the network still struggles with challenges that hinder its compatibility with other projects in the industry.\n\nThis is because Cardano is fundamentally different from most blockchain projects. It dons a different smart contract environment, transaction model, and signature scheme, making it very hard to communicate with other blockchain networks in the industry, and is the reason why its DeFi ecosystem is smaller compared to other networks.\n\nTo bridge this gap, the POS network relies on third-party developer solutions like Wanchain\u2019s bi-directional cross-chain bridges to tap into DeFi ecosystems built on other networks. At press time, Cardano\u2019s DeFi ecosystem comprises 24 protocols, starkly contrasting Ethereum\u2019s titanic count of 897 unique protocols.\n\nInteroperability merely scratches the surface of the challenges in Cardano\u2019s current infrastructure. However, Cardano\u2019s vibrant developer ecosystem is actively working to develop new solutions and help propel the network beyond its rivals.\n\nThe Voltaire-era\u2019s community-driven governance holds much promise for the network and could ultimately bring Hoskinson\u2019s vision to fruition.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nADA exchanged hands at $0.2785 at press time with a daily trading volume exceeding $329 million.\n\nRecent Santiment data named Cardano the industry\u2019s top dev platform at press time, eclipsing competitors Polkadot and Kusama.\n\nCharles Hoskinson believes that by the summer of 2023, Cardano could surpass Bitcoin, Ethereum, and every other cryptocurrency in decentralization.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nCardano is actively vying to cement its position as the top cryptocurrency project in the industry. The network has shown remarkable growth this year and is determined to stay consistent with its results. The network could become the best if it maintains its momentum.\n\nCardano\u2019s new accomplishment may not be as impressive as it seems:\n\nCardano Celebrates 1.3M Stakers, but Is It Good as It Seems?\n\nA newly launched network has outperformed Cardano, but is comparing the two fair?\n\nCardano DeFi TVL Slips Below Base Chain as ADA Declines"

        "content": "DEX aggregator 1inch withdrew over $40 million worth of cryptocurrencies from its investment fund and purchased $10 million worth of Ethereum during the early hours of Aug. 28 at an average price of $1650, according to Etherscan data.\n\nA breakdown of the withdrawals showed that the DeFi platform withdrew 41.8 million worth of Tether\u2019s USDT, 396,000 in Uniswap\u2019s UNI token, 3,120 Ethereum (ETH), and 75,000 in USDC. Additionally, 1inch swapped $10.075 million USDT and USDC to buy 6,088 ETH.\n\nThe reasons behind the transactions remain unclear as of press time. 1inch was yet to respond to CryptoSlate\u2019s request for comment as of press time.\n\nOnchain sleuth Lookonchain highlighted a smart money move executed by the 1inch earlier this year. Per Lookonchain, 1inch generated nearly $4 million in profits in July by selling 11,000 ETH for $21 million.\n\nThis transaction followed 1inch\u2019s accumulation of approximately 17,000 ETH, valued at $26.8 million, throughout the year\u2019s first quarter. The acquisition was made at an average price of $1,569, and the subsequent sale occurred at an average price of $1,906.\n\nAt the time, 1inch co-founder Sergej Kunz reportedly explained that the transaction was to test a new feature on the protocol Fusion Mode. Fusion mode allows users to place custom swap orders without paying gas fees.\n\nThe protocol claimed that the upgrade would help users avoid sandwich attacks, which have become prevalent with MEV attacks.\n\n$15k worth of tokens to be unlocked\n\nThe Token Unlocks dashboard shows that 64,290 1Inch tokens, worth $15,000, will be unlocked by Aug. 31. These tokens account for 0.01% of the asset\u2019s total circulating supply.\n\nPer CryptoSlate\u2019s data, the 1inch token has seen its value drop by 1% in the last 24 hours to $0.2407. The asset is down 22% in the previous 30 days.\n\nAmid these developments, 1inch recently deployed on the Coinbase-backed Base layer-2 network.

        "title": "Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin's Chinese connection: How deep does it go? - CoinGeek",
        "content": "Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s ties to China are raising questions about the independence of this prominent blockchain and the foundation that oversees its operations.\n\nA growing number of blockchain detectives have been posting what they purport to be evidence of undue Chinese influence on Buterin, Ethereum, and the Ethereum Foundation. This includes claims that Ethereum/Buterin are financially beholden to Chinese conglomerate Wanxiang Group, which has close ties to China\u2019s government.\n\nButerin\u2019s personal interest in all things Chinese is well documented, including his efforts to learn the language and his commitment to issuing a Chinese-language version of the Ethereum white paper in January 2015, six months ahead of the blockchain\u2019s mainnet launch on July 30.\n\nBut Ethereum almost didn\u2019t make it to that launch date. As detailed by Dr. Xiao Feng\u2014vice-chairman and executive director of China Wanxiang Holding Co, Ltd\u2014he first encountered Buterin over WeChat messages in December 2014. They hit it off well enough that they agreed to meet face-to-face in Shanghai in April 2015, during Buterin\u2019s three-month stay in the city.\n\nXiao said he and Buterin met \u201coften\u201d to discuss blockchain matters \u201cand of course, how Wanxiang could work together with Ethereum to promote the developments and applications of blockchain technology in China.\u201d\n\nButerin showed up for one of these meetings looking particularly haggard, which Xiao learned resulted from a \u201cnight-long meeting\u201d that centered on the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s bare financial cupboard. Concerns were mounting that Ethereum\u2019s mainnet launch might not happen due to its developers\u2019 inability to fund their operations.\n\nRecognizing the \u201chuge pressure\u201d Buterin was under, Xiao said he had the idea that \u201cif we could actively fund the development of Ethereum at this critical moment, we would not only become a major participant in this revolutionary project, but we could also leverage this opportunity to guide and implement Wanxiang\u2019s blockchain strategic planning.\u201d\n\nXiao proposed donating US$500,000 to the Ethereum Foundation in the name of Wanxiang Blockchain Labs (WBL), a company that didn\u2019t exist then. The donation would actually be made by DataYes, a Wanxiang subsidiary founded in 2013 to provide data and investment management solutions for financial services entities.\n\nBut Xiao\u2019s generosity didn\u2019t stop there. He also pledged that Wanxiang \u201cwould continue to fund the foundation over the next year, so that the developers could focus on their work to help the Ethereum mainnet go live as scheduled.\u201d\n\nWhile Xiao\u2019s $500k \u2018donation\u2019 was later converted into over 416,000 ETH tokens\u2014currently worth nearly $700 million\u2014there\u2019s never been any public breakdown of what Xiao/Wanxiang received in exchange for their additional funding of the Foundation.\n\nThe ties that blind\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Buterin made an impression on Xiao. Buterin was named WBL\u2019s \u2018chief scientist\u2019 when the firm launched in the second half of 2015. A 2016 Facebook post cited Buterin as one of WBL\u2019s co-founders, along with Xiao and Bo Shen, co-founders of the Bitshares decentralized exchange.\n\nShen was instrumental in connecting Xiao and Buterin, with Buterin staying at Shen\u2019s Shanghai home for a month during Buterin\u2019s stay. Both Shen and Buterin were listed among the original general partners of Fenbushi Capital, a Wanxiang-funded, blockchain-focused venture capital group announced at the same time as Xiao\u2019s Foundation funding.\n\nButerin announced he was stepping down from an active role at Fenbushi in January 2018, although the fund\u2019s website continues to list him as serving in an advisory capacity. Shen remains at Fenbushi to this day.\n\nAnother blockchain-focused Wanxiang offshoot, Hashkey Capital, is run by former Wanxiang investment manager Deng Chao. Deng claims to have been the one who convinced Xiao to make that original $500,000 donation to the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nHashkey has invested hundreds of millions in blockchain projects, with Deng singling out Ethereum as an area of particular interest. \u201cSince 2015 we\u2019ve been interacting a lot with the developer community, especially in the case of Ethereum.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, the same year that WBL was launched, the first Wanxiang Global Blockchain Summit was held in Shanghai. To help kickstart the event, Xiao said, \u201cWanxiang worked closely with the Ethereum community to widely promote cutting-edge blockchain topics on a global scale.\u201d\n\nIn May 2016, Xiao and eight colleagues joined Buterin for a stateside \u2018blockchain expedition\u2019 that started in San Francisco. Later that year, Xiao convinced the Foundation to move its Ethereum Developers Conference to Shanghai by offering to sponsor the entire event, with the added bonus of revenue from ticket sales and other sponsorships going directly to the Foundation.\n\nSharing is caring\n\nThe X/Twitter personality known as TruthLabs claims to have identified close ties between digital wallets belonging to Wanxiang and those of Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation. While the legitimacy of these claims has been disputed, that\u2019s just one of Ethereum\u2019s inherent mysteries, resulting from the controversial premine that preceded its mainnet launch.\n\nA quick \ud83e\uddf5showing that Wanxiang, Chinese auto and early Ethereum Investor funded and setup Vitalik Buterins official wallets. 1/6https://t.co/4uMLLnzguq pic.twitter.com/Ec1cjLOLz2 \u2014 TruthLabs \ud83e\udee1 (@BoringSleuth) January 29, 2023\n\nAround 10% of the circulating ETH supply\u2014roughly 12 million tokens\u2014was allocated to Ethereum Foundation members and early project contributors. Buterin alone reportedly received 553,000 ETH through this \u2018friends and family\u2019 distribution.\n\nEthereum\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) proved equally problematic. Despite 60 million tokens up for grabs\u2014roughly half of today\u2019s total ETH supply\u2014the Foundation showed little interest in establishing any real guardrails to prevent individual buyers from carving off more than the stated cap of 12.5% of the pie.\n\nIn the end, all that was required to participate in this cattle call was an email address and a willingness to exchange BTC tokens for ETH. According to Nansen data, the result was that 100 of the 8,800 wallets that took part in the ICO held 40% of the available ETH. \u2018Decentralization\u2019 at its finest.\n\nIn April 2018, securitization lawyer Preston Byrne analyzed the ICO and found that the BTC \u201cflowed in with the mathematical precision of a power function, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for two weeks straight.\u201d This metronomic pattern led Byrne to conclude that the bulk of the tokens were likely sold \u201cto one person or, more likely, a handful of close associates working in concert.\u201d\n\nTruthLabs has claimed that Wanxiang was used as a conduit for members of the Chinese government to purchase large amounts of ETH via the ICO. If true, combined with Wanxiang\u2019s significant investments in Ethereum-based infrastructure projects, China would have a truly outsized influence over the blockchain\u2019s future.\n\nIts critical that I drive home two points: 1. CCP is $ETH's biggest whale, masked behind Wanxiang and others. 2. Wanxiang was perfectly positioned to wear the Mask.\n\nHQ'd in Chicago, tied in to Biden & Bush. Blockchain Partnerships with MIT, IBM, UBS, Microsoft, and more. \u2014 TruthLabs \ud83e\udee1 (@BoringSleuth) June 28, 2023\n\nThat is all the more concerning given Ethereum\u2019s recent transition from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to one based on proof-of-stake. To serve as a \u2018validator\u2019 under the new regime, one must lock up a stake of 32 ETH worth around US$60,000, well out of the reach of most rank-and-file users.\n\nHowever, individuals, entities, and nation-states linked to Wanxiang could easily clear this hurdle. And with validators in charge of deciding which transactions make it into the next block on the chain, the opportunity for skullduggery becomes all too apparent.\n\nEthereum\u2019s ICO was quickly followed by a deluge of similar token sales. Enticed by the ease of creating new token projects on Ethereum, scammers preyed on the public\u2019s growing interest in 2017\u2019s artificially inflated digital asset price bubble.\n\nIronically, Wanxiang\u2019s Xiao spoke out against ICOs in early 2018, calling for a prohibition on trading tokens immediately after their initial public sale. For what it\u2019s worth, that opinion was expressed only after China formally prohibited ICOs as an illegal fundraising mechanism in late-2017.\n\nCan you premine copper?\n\nWanxiang is considered one of China\u2019s largest \u2018non-state-owned\u2019 conglomerates, although the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has ensured it has a say in the operation of all domestic companies through the presence of so-called Party Committees on private firms\u2019 boards of directors. Over two-thirds of private companies now formally acknowledge the presence of Party Committees implementing \u201ccorporate governance with Chinese characteristics.\u201d\n\nWanxiang founder Lu Guanqiu was a delegate to the Chinese National People\u2019s Congress through the late 90s, after which he was promoted to full NPC deputy. Following his death in 2017, the CCP publicly lauded Lu for having \u201calways actively accomplished all that is advocated by Party committees and governments at all levels.\u201d The CCP expressed its confidence that \u201cpeople at Wanxiang\u201d\u2014 currently led by Lu\u2019s son Lu Weiding\u2014will \u201calways listen to the Party and follow the Party.\u201d\n\nFormed in 1969, Wanxiang Group originally made its name in auto parts, but its rapid rise led to a diversification into insurance, banking, asset management, and\u2014controversially\u2014importing minerals from North Korea.\n\nWanxiang reportedly enjoys an exclusive importation contract with North Korea\u2019s Hysean Youth Mine, a major source of copper. Wanxiang has also partnered with North Korea on the Hyejung Mining Joint Venture Co, entitling Wanxiang to all underground mineral resources\u2014including copper, tungsten, and molybdenum\u2014in Yanggaang Province.\n\nOther Chinese companies that have been caught importing minerals from North Korea\u2014including Hongxiang Industrial\u2014found themselves facing harsh U.S. economic sanctions. But Wanxiang somehow managed to dodge this bullet, despite sources claiming its dealings with the North Korean regime dwarf that of Hongxiang\u2019s.\n\nWanxiang\u2019s North Korean connections aren\u2019t so out of step with that of Ethereum, given the fact that Kim Jong Un\u2019s \u2018crypto\u2019 hackers used the blockchain\u2019s Tornado Cash coin mixer to wash their stolen tokens clean.\n\nDon\u2019t forget Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith\u2019s ill-fated trip to North Korea in defiance of U.S. government warnings that visiting Pyongyang to educate local officials on how to evade U.S. sanctions was a no-no. Griffith ultimately got 63 months in prison for that escapade.\n\nAnd yet, Buterin refused to see his comrade as guilty of anything, claiming that Griffith didn\u2019t give North Korea \u201cany kind of real help in doing anything bad.\u201d This raises all sorts of questions as to what else Buterin might be willing to let slide in the name of expanding Ethereum\u2019s reach and adoption.\n\nStealing fire and raising hell\n\nWanxiang\u2019s apparent \u2018get out of sanctions free card\u2019 recently came under fire following complaints by some members of Congress regarding the unfriendly stance the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has adopted toward most blockchain projects\u2014with the notable exception of Prometheum Ember Capital LLC.\n\nPrometheum made headlines in May when the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) approved the company\u2019s application to serve as a special purpose broker-dealer (SPBD). While it had yet to actually commence its operations, Prometheum claimed to have developed a model under which all the digital assets it traded would be registered securities. This stood in stark contrast to the likes of SEC whipping boy Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN), which claims to this day that none of the assets on its exchange are securities.\n\nThe anti-SEC faction in Congress\u2014primarily on the Republican side of the aisle\u2014raised holy hell when they learned that Prometheum had entered into a \u2018strategic partnership and joint development agreement\u2019 with Wanxiang in 2018. Prometheum later claimed that the joint development of blockchain trading software was halted in October 2021, but Wanxiang continues to hold a 20% stake in Prometheum.\n\nWanxiang\u2019s involvement and deceased founder Lu\u2019s ties to the CCP prompted a group of Republicans\u2014including House Financial Services Committee chairman Patrick McHenry\u2014to write letters demanding transparency from both FINRA and the SEC regarding the process that resulted in Prometheum\u2019s SPBD approval.\n\nIt probably didn\u2019t help that in early 2018, Wanxiang struck a \u2018strategic cooperation\u2019 pact with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to \u201cadvance scientific and technological research and development.\u201d This occurred almost simultaneously with Gensler becoming a blockchain-focused professor at MIT. For what it\u2019s worth, Gensler was already on record saying ETH was an unregistered security. Was Wanxiang hoping to change his mind?\n\nThe obligatory Hunter Biden reference\n\nEven before Prometheum got under Republicans\u2019 skin, Fox News questioned a July 2014 meeting at the White House with then-Vice President Joe Biden, Wanxiang America President Pin Ni, and Wanxiang Resources Co. president Youhong Han.\n\nThat meeting followed Wanxiang\u2019s February 2014 purchase of Fisker Automotive, a failing U.S. luxury electric vehicles manufacturer. The deal involved converting an abandoned manufacturing facility in Delaware, Biden\u2019s home state.\n\nBiden\u2019s controversial son Hunter purchased a Fisker vehicle in early 2014, but it proved a lemon. This seems to have come up for discussion during the White House meeting with the Wanxiang executives because a week later, Pin Ni emailed Hunter to say, \u201cIt would be our honor to get your Fisker fixed.\u201d Hunter replied that he\u2019d already sold the car back to the dealer, prompting Pin Ni to say he\u2019d \u201cmake sure your next Fisker will exceed the expectation.\u201d\n\nWhile Fox appears convinced that the Biden connection is the reason Wanxiang has never faced sanctions for its North Korean dealings, it\u2019s worth remembering that despite those North Korean mineral dealings surfacing just one month before Donald Trump was elected president, Der Donald also took no action against Wanxiang during his four years in office.\n\nThe middle blockchain kingdom\n\nEthereum\u2019s Chinese connection is by no means limited to Wanxiang. An archived version of the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s website shows a trio of individuals bearing the official designation of \u2018Chinese Partner.\u2019 (No other nation is afforded this perk.) Of these three partners\u2014Jerry Liu, Bin Lu, and Houwu Chen\u2014two appear to have worked at China\u2019s Alibaba Group. Lu was an Alibaba developer, while Liu\u2019s title was Senior Product Expert.\n\nWhile China has a notoriously antagonistic attitude towards all things \u2018crypto,\u2019 this summer saw the Hong Kong-based Bank of China International Holdings (BOCI)\u2014the global investment unit of the mainland\u2019s People\u2019s Bank of China\u2014issue RMB200 million worth of tokenized securities on Ethereum.\n\nTransacting via ETH on the mainland remains technically off-limits, but the BOCI\u2019s move was viewed as a means of boosting Hong Kong\u2019s growing embrace of digital assets. It may also signal a new favoritism for Ethereum by the People\u2019s Bank of China\u2014which formerly employed Wanxiang\u2019s Xiao in its Shenzhen Special Economic Zone branch.\n\nIn August, Wanxiang offshoot Hashkey became one of the first exchanges to receive a Hong Kong license, allowing retail investors to trade select digital assets. A member of Hong Kong\u2019s legislative council expressed the hope that this could lead to \u201cinterconnected\u201d virtual asset trading between Hong Kong and mainland China in the not-too-distant future.\n\nNightmare fuel: an Ethereum-based internet\n\nXiao has likened Ethereum to the Highlander of blockchains in that there can be only one. Last December, Xiao gave a speech at the 2022 Global Blockchain Summit in which he predicted: \u201ca scenario where a blockchain protocol stack will converge around the Ethereum network, like what happened with the Internet in the 20th century.\u201d\n\nXiao explained how the early internet consisted of disconnected protocols that eventually \u201cmerged into the TCP/IP protocol stack \u2026 The current multi-chain phenomenon of blockchain is similar to the era when Internet protocols had not yet been not \u2018unified.\u2019\u201d\n\nXiao declared that \u201camong all blockchain protocols, only Ethereum has the architecture of acting as that blockchain protocol stack from the base layer to layer-1s, layer-2s and even layer-3s \u2026 according to the Ethereum Foundation, within 10 years, transactions on the Ethereum network will be able to reach 10 million transactions per second.\u201d\n\nXiao predicted that all existing blockchain protocols would \u201cgradually be prompted and influenced by industry players to merge into a single unified protocol stack. Other public chains interconnected with Ethereum may act as side chains, or shards and partitions of the Ethereum network, as we strive to achieve an ideal world of interoperability and interconnectivity in the universe of blockchain.\u201d\n\nSo there you have it. Ethereum will be the only blockchain game in town, with other chains relegated to minor appendages of this unwieldy Rube Goldberg machine. However, if Xiao based his transaction forecasts on the habitually unrealized fantasies of the Ethereum Foundation, he\u2014and any nation-states that might be betting on a single horse in this race\u2014are bound to be disappointed.\n\nWhile Ethereum contents itself with imagining what might be possible in 2032, the BSV blockchain continues to set new transaction records in the here and now. BSV blockchain handled a record 128 million transactions in a single 24-hour period this month and did so on a sturdy base layer, requiring none of the rickety and proprietary on-/off-ramps without which Ethereum can\u2019t function.\n\nAnd despite Xiao\u2019s assertions, BSV blockchain remains the only blockchain with the scaling capacity to handle the dramatic increase in the number of transactions that a transition to Web3 will demand\u2014and do so on a cost-effective basis\u2014and will thus leave Ethereum in the dust.\n\nPerhaps crucially, the BSV blockchain also lacks Ethereum\u2019s apparent deference to a single country. Anyone who still hypes Ethereum\u2019s commitment to decentralization should wonder why that commitment doesn\u2019t seem to apply on a geopolitical basis.\n\nFollow CoinGeek\u2019s Crypto Crime Cartel series, which delves into the stream of group\u2014from BitMEX to Binance, Bitcoin.com, Blockstream, ShapeShift, Coinbase, Ripple,\n\nEthereum, FTX and Tether\u2014who have co-opted the digital asset revolution and turned the industry into a minefield for na\u00efve (and even experienced) players in the market.\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "OnlyFans' Parent Company Faces Ethereum Losses After Investing $19M in 2022\n\nFenix International Limited Faces Ethereum Losses After Investing\n\nWhile 2022 proved to be a prosperous year for content creator platform OnlyFans, it wasn't necessarily the same for Ethereum, as highlighted in a recent financial statement.\n\nFenix International Limited, the parent firm of OnlyFans, said that it had owned Ethereum (ETH) worth more than $19 million throughout the year. But by the end of November 2022, this holding's value had fallen to almost $11.4 million, a considerable loss.\n\nThe corporation acknowledged its diversification into digital assets, primarily Ethereum, in a 48-page strategic statement. Despite the value impairment, the corporation insisted that it was still free to sell these crypto holdings.\n\nIn a notable move last year, OnlyFans introduced Ethereum-based NFTs for creators to use in their profile images. This initiative aimed to empower creators and mark the platform's initial exploration into the role of NFTs.\n\nDue to the overall decline in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum's value declined throughout the reporting period, but OnlyFans had a prosperous year in terms of revenue and growth. From $4.8 billion in 2021 to $5.6 billion in 2022, the platform's revenue increased dramatically. Additionally, there were 47% more creators on the platform, and there were 27% more subscribers overall.\n\nDespite the financial setback related to Ethereum, OnlyFans' overall performance underscores the ongoing evolution and potential of digital content creation platforms."

This regulatory giant took on some of the most substantial entities in the crypto realm, including Ripple, Paxful, Circle, and Binance, which boasts over 60% of the market share for crypto platforms, and its rival, Coinbase. Both Binance and Coinbase are leading crypto exchanges, setting the tone for trading across the globe.\n\nPrometheum\u2019s rise to fame was somewhat unconventional, to say the least. Many were introduced to this previously low-profile entity in early June when its co-founder, Aaron Kaplan, made a surprise appearance in a Congressional hearing. His remarks during this event were nothing short of controversial, as he praised the SEC\u2019s framework for crypto in the US. Kaplan\u2019s opinions caused quite a stir within the crypto community, given the industry-wide sentiment that the SEC had been overstepping with unclear regulations.\n\nThe Regulatory Approval\n\nPrometheum isn\u2019t just another startup; it\u2019s a brainchild of Aaron Kaplan and his sibling, Benjamin, founded in 2017. Operating from Wall Street, their vision was to fuse the advantages of a blockchain-centric platform with the safety net of a securities-regulated marketplace. Their ambition did not go unnoticed.\n\nIn May, Prometheum made headlines as it emerged as the pioneer crypto enterprise to receive a \u201cspecial purpose broker-dealer\u201d status for digital assets, sanctioned by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. This achievement was soon followed in October, with the SEC granting them the \u201calternative trading system\u201d title, significantly reducing the regulatory oversight compared to national exchanges.\n\nIt\u2019s been alleged that Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and the rest of the Ethereum brand have ties to the project."

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the cofounder of Ethereum, transferred approximately 3,000 ETH (~$4.95 million) to an address labeled \"Vb 2.\" The move has sparked speculation and interest within the crypto community, given Buterin's influence on the market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne plausible explanation for this transfer is that Buterin is redistributing his funds among his own wallets to mitigate the risk of hacking or theft. As of the latest data, Vitalik Buterin's known Ethereum address holds around 73 ETH, valued at approximately $119,865. This strategy of redistributing assets is common among high-profile individuals in the crypto space to enhance security.\n\nHowever, another angle to consider is the possibility of a cashout. The crypto market has been experiencing a downturn, and this move could be a strategic decision for active profit-taking. It is worth noting that large sell-offs from influential figures like Buterin often coincide with significant market-wide corrections.\n\nA brief review of Ethereum's price performance shows a volatile market. While the asset has shown resilience over time, the current market conditions are less than ideal, making any significant move by a key player like Buterin noteworthy.\n\nHistorically, Vitalik Buterin's financial moves have had a ripple effect on the Ethereum market. Whether this recent transaction will have a similar impact remains to be seen. However, given the current market volatility, it is a development that traders and investors should keep an eye on.\n\nWhile the exact reason behind this significant transfer remains speculative, it is clear that it could have multiple implications. Whether it is a simple act of redistributing assets for security reasons or a strategic move in response to market conditions, the transaction is significant enough to keep an eye on Buterin's wallets.\n\n"

        "title": "Reshaping real world assets with tokenization and original Ethereum's vision: AMA with Mattereum - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "\"I'm pretty disappointed with the way Ethereum has gone since its launch,\" said Vinay Gupta, founder of Mattereum and former coordinator of Ethereum's initial release, during Cointelegraph's AMA session. \"The idea was that we could use blockchain to govern infrastructure in the real world. There was this idea that we could tokenize real-world assets and get these new efficient economies, just better use of capital globally to provide people with bare goods, bare services with less waste and inefficiency. But that didn't happen.\"\n\nWith Mattereum which focuses on asset tokenization Gupta wants to go back to Ethereum's roots and address the original problem. \u201cWe\u2019re not inventing fractional ownership from scratch. Big publicly traded companies like IBM, Google or Meta offer similar options as stocks available to everyone.\n\nWhat we're doing is using the efficiency of blockchain to apply this fractional ownership concept to much smaller things, much cheaper and lighter. This brings the benefits of fractional ownership governance down to the point where you can start dealing with individual cars, homes, or works of art, rather than at the scale of power grids, airplanes, or utilities that serve hundreds of millions of users every day on the Internet,\" Gupta said.\n\nHe identified unreadiness in regulation as one of the factors that led Ethereum to off-track, which became a priority for Mattereum to solve. \"Working with lawyers and convincing them to support our cause proved to be a lengthy process. It took us four years to complete our first transaction and six years to reach a point of being able to securitize. As a result, it's now possible to legally gain control of almost any asset in most countries in a completely legal way. This means that we can go back to an earlier vision of Ethereum and fully implement it,\" he added.\n\nIn addition to explaining that tokenization can significantly reduce the time spent on legal and paperwork, Gupta shared his vision on the other benefits that it could bring to the world: 'Tokenization takes ultra-powerful tools from high finance and makes them accessible as a means of replacing massive mortgages and credit card debt. It changes the current debt-based relationships in society to an equity-based economy and the idea of \"we own this thing, we cooperate together.\"\n\nIn this case, I expect a level of social transformation and revolution much greater than what happened with the invention of credit cards and debt. Moreover, co-owned societies are much more benign and friendly.\u201d\n\nRegarding other possible changes due to blockchain mass adoption, Gupta envisions an economic democracy revolution and the integral role of DAOs in it. He anticipates DAOs to become as popular as social media platforms with \u201cgovernance geeks managing their portfolio\u201d. \"I believe such a transformation is necessary and inevitable if we intend to democratize the world,\" he claimed.\n\nGupta views Mattereum as a backend powerhouse similar to how Amazon assisted in launching thousands of businesses worldwide. He elaborated: \u201cAnyone can bring a deal to Mattereum to examine the possibilities and limitations and then to secure and fractionalize it as Mattereum Asset Passports. So If any company with specific expertise wants to make assets transactionable or create companies with backend transactions, they can reach us.\u201d\n\nMattereum Asset Passports, which Gupta mentioned, are NFTs that prove the value of physical objects. They come with a built-in legal layer, providing a warranty claim mechanism that addresses liability. Gupta provided more details on Mattereum\u2019s flagship Asset Passports: \u201cWe put on chain with our customers legally binding promises from different third parties about the goods being sold. If any of those promises are inaccurate the third parties have to pay.\n\nIt's important to note that it\u2019s the third parties who are providing risk management in the deal and bear the costs. They\u2019re putting up money which could be in on-chain escrow contracts to guarantee that the buyer will not be defrauded. That\u2019s how we get trustworthy oracles to prove all the assets on chain are legitimate.\u201d\n\n\"I truly believe that moving from a debt-based economy to an asset-based economy and implementing a fully transparent financial infrastructure will solve many of the world's political problems,\" Gupta said, summing up the AMA session. \u201cIt is still possible to implement Ethereum's original vision. However, it requires a massive bridge, which Mattereum can become. I envision Mattereum as a fundamental part of the financial infrastructure for the entire planet, much like Swift or Visa\u201d, he added.\n\nLearn more about Mattereum"

However, the firm experienced an impairment loss of $8,455 million, resulting in a remaining balance of $11,434 million.\n\nIn 2022, OnlyFans\u2019 revenues exceeded $1 billion for the first time. US-based Ukrainian Leonid Radvinsky, who acquired the company in 2018, has collected roughly $485 million in dividends since early last year.\n\nThis is one of many billion dollar companies getting into $ETH.

OnlyFans owner collects $485 million in dividends as it invests profits into Ethereum https://t.co/ccKVJIUyP3 \u2014 Crypto Guru (@EatHealthyGetR1) August 27, 2023\n\nThe site experienced a surge in demand, attracting over 50 million new users and one million content creators by November 2022. During this time, users collectively spent $5.5 billion on the platform. Sales for the year rose by 17% to $1.1 billion, while pre-tax profits soared by 21% to $525 million.\n\nOnlyFans Faces Controversy Amid Growth\n\nThe news comes while OnlyFans is facing some controversy. A previous investigation by BBC News brought to light instances of minors appearing and participating in content on the platform, which raised safety issues.\n\nOnlyFans responded to these distressing claims by advocating for its strict safety measures, assuring the public in its reports that the company \u201cexceeds what is legally necessary\u201d to foster a secure and regulated community environment.\n\nThe firm also emphasized that its primary objective is to create the most secure social media platform that empowers content creators. Although OnlyFans is known for its mature content, it has begun diversifying its offerings. It now welcomes videos appropriate for all audiences, including genres such as cooking, comedy, fitness, and music.\n\nMeanwhile, a billboard ad showcasing OnlyFans model Eliza Rose Watson\u2019s page was under scrutiny from the public with claims that it consisted of content inappropriate for younger audiences. However, despite complaints, the Advertising Standards Authority cleared it for display as it considered them non-offensive."

However, Ethereum\u2019s journey contrasted sharply with this success.\n\nAt the start of the report in May 2022, the company\u2019s Ethereum assets were worth over $19 million, but by November, their value had fallen to about $11.4 million.\n\nPer the company\u2019s statement, OnlyFans diversified some of its operational capital into Ethereum during the year. The report noted that the company could freely liquidate its Bitcoin holdings, valuing the asset at its year-end market price.\n\nLast year, OnlyFans, known for adult content, made waves in the crypto space by allowing creators to feature verified Ethereum NFTs as profile images. This move signaled a creator\u2019s Ethereum asset ownership.\n\nCEO Amrapali Gan shared, \u201cThis step is just the beginning of our exploration into NFTs\u2019 potential role on our platform.\u201d\n\n2022 saw significant upheavals in the cryptocurrency market, with events like the Terra UST stablecoin\u2019s decline and crypto exchange FTX\u2019s downfall.\n\nYet, OnlyFans had a stellar year, with revenues rising from $4.8 billion in 2021 to $5.6 billion in 2022. Their user base grew by 27%, and the number of artists on the platform increased by 47%. This growth showcased OnlyFans\u2019 ability to thrive despite challenging conditions.\n\nRead more: Trump reveals crypto and NFT holdings\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "OnlyFans, the well-known adult content subscription platform, has made a bold move into the world of cryptocurrencies. Its parent company, Fenix International, recently revealed its significant investment of nearly $20 million in Ether (ETH) in 2022.\n\nAccording to official financial filings submitted to the UK corporate registry, Fenix International acquired nearly $20 million worth of ETH over a two-year period.\n\nWhile the company\u2019s investment in Ether demonstrates its progressive approach, it wasn\u2019t immune to the market\u2019s inherent volatility. By the end of November 2022, the value of Ether had plummeted by $8.5 million, leading to an impairment loss on the investment.\n\nThe remaining carrying amount of Ethereum stands at $11.434 million, reflecting the broader trends and uncertainties in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nOnlyFans Ventures Beyond Traditional Offerings\n\nThe move to invest in Ether aligns with OnlyFans\u2019 broader strategy of diversification and technological innovation. Investing in intangible assets with an \u201cindefinite useful life\u201d showcases the company\u2019s willingness to embrace emerging technologies like blockchain, positioning itself at the forefront of industry trends.\n\nThe disclosure about Fenix\u2019s acquiring a substantial amount of Ether has not seemed to provide a lift yet to the price of the crypto. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $1,636, down -0.8% in the last 24 hours, and sustaining a slight 2.2% loss in the last seven days, data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows.\n\nThe financial filings offer a glimpse into OnlyFans\u2019 multi-faceted performance. Despite the challenges posed by its cryptocurrency investment, the company reported impressive financial results for the year ending November 2022.\n\nWith revenue surpassing the $1 billion mark, driven by an influx of over 50 million new users and more than a million content creators, OnlyFans solidified its position as a revenue-generating powerhouse. Users collectively spent an astounding $5.5 billion on the platform.\n\nOnlyFans Pioneers NFT Integration And Celebrity Trading Cards\n\nLeonid Radvinsky, the visionary entrepreneur of Ukrainian origin who acquired OnlyFans in 2018, has reaped the rewards of the platform\u2019s surging popularity.\n\nThe filings unveil that Radvinsky amassed dividends approximating $485 million since the inception of the previous year, in line with the escalating demand for OnlyFans\u2019 offerings.\n\nThis recent crypto venture is not the company\u2019s first stride into the digital asset domain. In early 2022, OnlyFans facilitated a pioneering move by enabling verified creators to replace their profile pictures with Ethereum-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nBitcoin slides back into the $25K region. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nMoreover, in June of the same year, former OnlyFans executives unveiled Zoop, a celebrity trading card platform leveraging the Ethereum scaling solution Polygon. Zoop allowed users to trade 3D digital playing cards depicting their favorite celebrities.\n\nThe disclosure of Fenix International\u2019s Ethereum holdings dovetailed with an industry-wide trend, as adult content creators began flocking to Friend.tech, a decentralized social media platform rooted in the cryptocurrency realm. This rush underscores how crypto\u2019s recent surge has not only captured financial markets\u2019 attention but also influenced sectors far beyond conventional investments.\n\nFeatured image from Verit\u00e0 e Affari\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

This will free up $2.5 million in trapped assets from bridging issues encountered during its launch earlier this month.\n\nAfter a chaotic start, Shibarium has finally become stable. Both its mainnet and connecting bridge were suspended due to scalability issues, causing millions of dollars in user assets to be temporarily frozen. Shiba Inu\u2019s anonymous lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, pointed to an overwhelming volume of transactions and users as the root cause but firmly denied any security breaches.\n\nThis temporary hiccup left Shibarium\u2019s users in limbo. The inability to access their funds fueled concerns among the community, with many questioning the platform\u2019s credibility.\n\nHowever, as of today, all seems to be back on track. The Shibarium team has not only restored mainnet operations but also made sure that the bridge is working smoothly. Users can now withdraw various assets such as ETH, SHIB, LEASH, and wrapped ETH.\n\nAccording to Kusama, these withdrawals should take between 45 minutes and 3 hours. However, users were warned that withdrawals of BONE, the governance token for ShibaSwap, might take up to a week.\n\nSHIB\u2019s price has remained relatively stable, with only a 0.1% change over the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko."

        "content": "Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has multiple public wallets that carry a significant amount of ETH and these wallets are religiously tracked by on-chain sleuths. This is why whenever the founder makes a withdrawal, the destination of the ETH being sent is closely followed and recent reports reveal that Buterin has been sending significant amounts of ETH out to different wallets.\n\nTwo Vitalik Buterin Transactions Spark Speculations\n\nIn the early hours of Monday, the on-chain data tracking platform PeckShieldAlert took to X (formerly Twitter) to share some interesting movements that have been taking place in wallets said to belong to Buterin. This time around, the tracker flagged a single transaction carrying 3,000 ETH.\n\nThe 3,000 ETH, worth roughly $4.95 million at the time of the transfer was sent out from the well-known Vitalik.eth wallet to another wallet identified publicly as Vb2. This brought the latter\u2019s balance to 3,017 ETH, worth a little over $4.95 million.\n\nThe speculations of whether the Ethereum founder is offloading some of his stash come in relation to an earlier transaction made by him. The transaction which was also reported by PeckShield alert showed that Buterin had sent 600 ETH worth around $1 million at the time to the Coinbase crypto exchange.\n\nFor many, however, this transaction was insignificant in the grand scheme of things and did not lead to a cause for alarm. The most recent transaction also follows in the same vein since it looks like the billionaire founder is just redistributing his assets to other wallets.\n\nETH price struggles coming out of the weekend | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nIs This Why ETH\u2019s Price Is Struggling?\n\nSo far, there is no indication that Buterin\u2019s wallet movements have anything to do with the ETH price decline. As already mentioned above, the ETH liquidity is too deep for a $1 million sell to trigger such a decline, which would suggest something else is behind the coin\u2019s struggles.\n\nThe most obvious factor is that the broader crypto market has been taking a hit and ETH has not been left out. Bitcoin fell from $28,000 to below $26,000, taking the majority of the market down with it. As a result, investor sentiment swung far into the negative which is preventing new money from coming into the market.\n\nWith the bear market waxing strong, there could be more decline to come for the digital asset until investor sentiment improves and the market starts to recover once more. For now, ETH is still ranging above $1,640 as bears and bulls are locked in a tug-of-war for control.\n\nFollow Best Owie on Twitter for market insights, updates, and the occasional funny tweet\u2026 Featured image from Police1, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Imagine buying a piece of digital artwork on the Internet at a reasonable price and getting a unique digital token known which proves your authority over the artwork you bought. Wouldn't it be great? Well, that opportunity exists now, thanks to NFTs.\n\nNFTs are currently taking the digital art and collectables world by storm. Just as everyone worldwide believed Bitcoin was the digital answer to currency, NFTs are now pitched as the digital answer to collectibles. Asa result, digital artists are seeing their lives changing thanks to the massive sales to a new crypto audience.\n\nIf you are interested in NFTs and want to explore more about what they are, you have come to the right place. Let\u2019s dive in and see what all the fuss is about!\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program What is NFT? NFT means non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are generally created using the same type of programming used for cryptocurrencies. In simple terms these cryptographic assets are based on blockchain technology. They cannot be exchanged or traded equivalently like other cryptographic assets. Like Bitcoin or Ethereum. The term NFT clearly represents it can neither be replaced nor interchanged because it has unique properties. Physical currency and cryptocurrency are fungible, which means that they can be traded or exchanged for one another. Immerse yourself in the revolutionary world of NFTs while building a robust foundation in cybersecurity through our dedicated cyber security bootcamp. Discover the intricacies of non-fungible tokens and their impact on digital ownership, all while honing your skills in protecting these valuable assets from cyber threats. With hands-on training in encryption, blockchain security, and risk mitigation, you'll be well-prepared to navigate the evolving landscape of NFTs with confidence. Join us to bridge the gap between cutting-edge technology and cybersecurity expertise in a single transformative program.\n\n\n\nNFT stands for a non-fungible token, which means it can neither be replaced nor interchanged because it has unique properties. Key Features of NFT - Digital Asset - NFT is a digital asset that represents Internet collectibles like art, music, and games with an authentic certificate created by blockchain technology that underlies Cryptocurrency.\n\nUnique - It cannot be forged or otherwise manipulated.\n\nExchange - NFT exchanges take place with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin on specialist sites. Cryptopunks is a notable example of an NFT. It enables you to buy, sell and store 10,000 collectibles with proof-of-ownership.\n\nHistory of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) As sometimes happens with innovative technology, NFTs did not just come out of the blue and become popular overnight. It leads to the question of when the first NFT came into existence. According to some, Colored Coins, which was initiated in 2012, has the honor of being the first NFT. In the words of investor Andrew Steinworld, he said that one might argue that the Colored Coins were the NFT that first came into existence. Colored Coins exhibited a major leap in the capabilities of Bitcoin, however, they had a downside too. They could represent only some values if their worth is agreed upon by everyone. The scripting language of Bitcoin did not enable this type of behavior within the network it is in. Some argue that \u201cQuantum\u201d NFT by Kevin McCoy minted on the Namecoin Blockchain on 2nd May 2014 is the first rightful owner of an NFT title. A project called \u201cCryptoKitties\u201d by Dapper Labs on Ethereum was the implementation of NFTs widely recognized as the first of its kind. When the 2017 crypto boom happened, those digital cats were priced at 600 Eth (or USD 172k) and mainstream attention was drawn globally. Since then, ample NFT projects have come up with a huge amount of success. What is Blockchain? Blockchain refers to a method of documenting data that ensures its security and integrity. This makes it impossible or difficult to modify, cheat or hack the system. A blockchain is essentially a digital documentation of transactions that is disseminated and replicated across a network or computer systems that uses blockchain technology Blockchain and Fungibility These are two concepts that can be related closely but also can pose some difficulties when combined. Fungibility pertains to a commodity or asset\u2019s ability to be exchanged easily for another similar unit without any difference in quality or value. Blockchain technology, however, creates a transparent and immutable record of transactions and ownership. For instance, if a certain cryptocurrency is involved in an unlawful activity, it may be told to be non-fungible or tainted, which means that it cannot be used interchangeably with other units of the same cryptocurrency. This leads to a loss of liquidity or value for the asset that is affected. However, a lot of solutions are currently being developed, like mixing privacy or services-focused cryptocurrency, to address this problem and to ensure fungibility while preserving the security and fungibility of blockchain technology. How Does NFT Work? Now that you've taken your initial steps in understanding what an NFT is, you should continue on and learn about how an NFT works. The majority of NFTs reside on the Ethereum cryptocurrency's blockchain, a distributed public ledger that records transactions.\n\nNFTs are individual tokens with valuable information stored in them.\n\nBecause they hold a value primarily set by the market and demand, they can be bought and sold just like other physical types of art.\n\nNFTs' unique data makes it easy to verify and validate their ownership and the transfer of tokens between owners.\n\nExamples of NFT The NFT world is relatively new to people. Here are some examples of NFTs that exist today: A Digital Collectible\n\nDomain Names\n\nGames\n\nEssays\n\nSneakers in fashion line\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program What is NFT Used For? People interested in Crypto-trading and people who like to collect artwork often use NFTs. Other than that, it has some other uses too like: Digital Content - The most significant use of NFTs today is in digital content. Content creators see their profits enhanced by NFTs, as they power a creator economy where creators have the ownership of their content over to the platforms they use to publicize it. Gaming Items - NFTs have garnered considerable interest from game developers. NFTs can provide a lot of benefits to the players. Normally, in an online game, you can buy items for your character, but that\u2019s as far as it goes. With NFTs, you can recoup your money by selling the items once you\u2019re finished with them. Investment and Collaterals - Both NFT and DeFi (Decentralized Finance) share the same infrastructure. DeFi applications let you borrow money by using collateral. NFT and DeFi both work together to explore using NFTs as collateral instead. Domain Names - NFTs provide your domain with an easier-to-remember name. This works like a website domain name, making its IP address more memorable and valuable, usually based on length and relevance. Even celebrities like Snoop Dogg, Shawn Mendes, and Jack Dorsey are taking an interest in the NFT by releasing unique memories and artwork and selling them as securitized NFTs. NBA Top Shot Is a Hot NFT Use Case One of the most popular non-fungible tokens in recent days is NBA Top Shot, a partnership between Dapper Labs (makers of the CryptoKitties game) and the National Basketball Association (NBA). The NBA licenses individual highlight video reels, among other content, to Dapper Labs, and they digitize the footage and make it available for sale to consumers. Each reel shows a video clip, such as a famous player's basketball dunk, some featuring different angles and digital artwork to make them unique. Even if someone made a perfect copy of the video, it can be instantly recognizable as a counterfeit. The venture has already generated $230 million in sales, and the company just also received $305 million in funding from a group that includes Michael Jordan and Kevin Durant. These video reels are selling at high prices. Among the most popular: LeBron James \u201cCosmic\u201d Dunk: $208,000\n\nZion Williamson \u201cHolo MMXX\u201d Block: $100,000\n\nLeBron James \u201cFrom the Top\u201d Block: $100,000\n\nLeBron James \u201cThrowdowns\u201d Dunk: $100,000\n\nLeBron James \u201cHolo MMXX\u201d Dunk: $99,999\n\nSteph Curry \u201cDeck the Hoops\u201d Handles: $85,000\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo \u201cHolo MMXX\u201d Dunk: $85,000\n\nLeBron James \u201cFrom the Top\u201d Dunk: $80,000 These unique NBA moments are minted and released into the marketplace via \u201cpack drops.\u201d The most common sell for only nine dollars, but more exclusive packs can sell for much more. Now that you\u2019ve understood what is NFT used for, and the various ways you can benefit from it, let\u2019s take a look at how it is specifically different from other forms on cryptocurrency. NFTs vs. Crypto and Fiat currencies. What's the Difference? NFTs or Non-Fungible Tokens are a kind of cryptocurrency that represents a one-of-a-kind digital asset or unique piece of artwork. Fiat and cryptocurrencies are mainly used for transactional purposes and are fungible, which means each unit can be interchanged. Being created on blockchain technology, NFTs allow the transfer of ownership and transparent ownership. They allow artists to monetize their creations made digitally and thus have gained huge popularity. Crypto and fiat currencies, on the other hand, are used mainly as a store of value or medium of exchange. While there are certain similarities, the unique features of NFTs make them different from traditional currencies. What is an NFT Marketplace? It is a marketplace that is a public Blockchain platform. Though it is in its early stages, this marketplace is gaining popularity and inspiring businesses and developers to construct a marketplace. Benefits of Non-Fungible Tokens There are several advantages of NFTs, some of these include: NFTs can be invested in by anyone as it is accessible to all and sundry. An NFT can be more efficiently and easily transferred among people around the globe.\n\nA blockchain secures NFT ownership. The digital signature of ownership can make the ownership of an investor quite secure. The ownership also gets transparent due to the blockchain technology.\n\nNFTs provide the scope for learning more about blockchain technology. The investors can do so while making their portfolios diverse and allocating a small amount of tokenized assets.\n\nWhy Are NFTs Becoming Popular? NFTs have actually been around since 2015, but they are now experiencing a boost in popularity thanks to several factors. First, and perhaps most obviously, is the normalization and excitement of cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain frameworks. Beyond the technology itself is the combination of fandom, the economics of royalties, and the laws of scarcity. Consumers all want to get in on the opportunity to own unique digital content and potentially hold them as a type of investment. When someone buys a non-fungible token, they gain ownership of the content, but it can still make its way over the Internet. In this way, an NFT can gain popularity \u2014 the more it\u2019s seen online, the more value it develops. When the asset is sold, the original creator gets a 10 percent cut, with the platform getting a small percentage and the current owner getting the rest of that revenue. Thus, there is potential for ongoing revenue from popular digital assets as they are bought and sold over time. Authenticity is the name of the game with NFTs. Digital collectibles contain distinguishing information that make them distinct from any other NFT and easily verifiable, thanks to the blockchain. Creating and circulating fake collectibles doesn\u2019t work because each item can be traced back to the original creator or issuer. And, unlike cryptocurrencies, they can\u2019t be directly exchanged with one another (like baseball cards in real life) because no two are the same. Are NFTs Mainstream Now? So, with all the fuss made over NFTs, is it accurate to say that they\u2019re now mainstream? This article makes a strong case for believing that NFTs are now baked into the public consciousness. It doesn\u2019t hurt that a number of high-profile celebrities have ventured into NFT waters. While perhaps it may be premature to say \u201cYes, NFTs are definitely mainstream now,\u201d if they continue on this trajectory, 2022 could be the year where we know that NFTs are here to stay. What\u2019s Worth Picking Up at the NFT Supermarket? One can consider a variety of unique digital assets based on personal preferences and interests at the NFT supermarket. Digital art is a popular category that includes unique pieces made by upcoming and well-known creators. Collectibles can be picked up too. These range from one-of-a-kind in-game items to virtual trading cards. Recent times have also seen sports-related NFTs like game highlights or limited edition player cards gain popularity. One can also explore virtual gaming and real estate assets that allow the buyers to trade and own game items or digital land. It is of utmost importance to conduct research on the value and authenticity of an NFT before purchasing it. This is due to the fact that the market is still evolving and is subject to volatility. Properties of NFT NFTs cannot be divided into smaller parts while retaining their inherent qualities. This distinguishes them from fungible tokens like a pound note, which can be subdivided into pence.\n\nWhen an entity mints NFT, it can sell to a new entity that can become the owner of that NFT. But, depending on a specific set of circumstances, smart contract rules may be utilized to restrict or stop further token transfers.\n\nThough an NFT has specific properties when it is created, those properties can be updated over time through smart contracts when certain conditions are met; this is akin to a \u2018pass the parcel\u2019 game where a parcel loses a layer of wrapping every time the music pauses. Applications of NFT NFTs applications can be found in several industries, such as gaming, art, sports and music. The creators of the art world are enabled to monetize their art created digitally and provide a unique record of ownership for collectors that is verifiable. In the same way, NFTs can be used to trade and create virtual assets in the gaming industry, including virtual real estate and in-game items. NFTs can be beneficial to the music industry by creating one-of-a-kind digital collectibles, while in sports, they can offer fan experiences and limited-edition memorabilia. Besides these, NFTs can also be used to verify and authenticate the ownership of physical assets like real estate and luxury goods.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program How is an NFT Different From Other Cryptocurrencies? Although NFTs are created using the same kind of programming language as other cryptocurrencies, that's where the similarity ends. Other Cryptocurrency NFT\n\nCryptocurrencies are \u201cfungible\u201d; they can be traded or exchanged for one another. They\u2019re also equal in value.\n\n\n\nFor example, one Bitcoin is always equal to another Bitcoin, or one Dollar is always equal to one Dollar.\n\nEach NFT acts as a digital signature that makes it impossible for them to be exchanged for or equal to one another.\n\nFor example, The Last Supper is a painting of a kind and cannot be exchanged with another painting.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin vs Ethereum: Which One is Better? Ethereum and NFTs Ethereum blockchain makes it possible for NFTs to work for several reasons: Trading NFTs, without needing peer-to-peer platforms, can take significant cuts as compensation.\n\nAll Ethereum products share the same \"backend\", making NFTs portable to buy on one product and sell it on another effortlessly.\n\nOnce a transaction is confirmed, it's impossible to manipulate the data to forge the ownership.\n\nEthereum never goes down, which means your tokens will always be available to sell.\n\nPenguin Communities Pudgy Penguin is a popular non-fungible token community, a cryptocurrency subcategory representing ownership in a unique asset: 8,888 penguins on the Ethereum blockchain, organized into one collection. Pudgy Penguin is just one of many communities out there that offer benefits and other advantages to members, such as having a membership on a shared Discord server or gaining access to a private Telegram channel that lets you talk with other owners. Many NFT projects have their own communities, where members can collaborate, share ideas, and support or buy each other\u2019s projects or art. How to Buy NFTs? Having understood what NFTs are used for and its specific advantages over other cryptocurrencies, you might want to venture into buying NFTs. If so, you will need to acquire some essential items before you do it: You\u2019ll need a digital wallet that allows you to store your NFTs and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThen you need to purchase some cryptocurrency depending on what currencies your NFT provider accepts, most likely Ether. You can use platforms like OpenSea, Coinbase, Kraken, PayPal, etc., to buy cryptocurrencies.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve made your cryptocurrency purchase, you can move it from the exchange to your wallet. Bear in mind, that many exchanges charge a small percentage of your crypto purchase transaction as fees.\n\nPopular NFT Marketplaces Once you\u2019ve got your wallet ready, all you need to do is to buy NFT. Currently, the largest NFT marketplaces are: Rarible - Rarible is a democratic marketplace that allows artists and creators to issue and sell NFTs. It enables holders to weigh in on features like fees and community rules. OpenSea - To get started, all you need to do is create an account on the official website of OpenSea and browse NFT collections and discover new artists. This platform is famously known as a vast collection of rare digital items and collectibles. Foundation - On this platform, artists need to receive from or send an invitation from fellow creators to post their art. This community\u2019s exclusivity boasts higher-caliber artwork, assuming the demand for NFTs remains at current levels or even increases over time. NFT Use Cases Popular NFT use cases include Event ticketing\n\nGaming\n\nSupply chain\n\nArt and collectibles\n\nWeb3 identification\n\nMusic\n\nVirtual real estate\n\nFood and drink\n\nDecentralized finance loans\n\nFashion NFT Scams With the growing popularity of NFTs the potential for fraud and scams is also growing. Scammers use various methods to cheat buyers. These include using false information to sell NFTs, making fake NFTs and conducting auctions without any intention of delivering the NFTs. These scams can make buyers lose a lot of money. Creating fake NFTs or \u201cmimic NFTs\u201d is one of the most common scams. In this, a digital file similar to NFT is created, but it has no ownership or value and is then sold for a large amount of money. Scammers also use false information, such as fake reviews or celebrity endorsements to create a false sense of value and authenticity. Another scam involves scammers conducting auctions without delivering the NFTs. To safeguard themselves, buyers should research the authenticity of the NFT and the seller and buy only from reputed sellers and marketplaces. How are NFTs Reinventing the Digital World? NFTs are transforming the digital world by providing a way to verify ownership and authenticate digital assets by forging new pathways for investors, creators and collectors. NFTs are unique digital assets that can represent anything from music to digital art to in-game items and virtual real estate. One of the most important advantages of the NFTs is that the digital creators get to monetize their work which was difficult to do before. NFTs provide a way of creating verifiable ownership and scarcity, making digital art and other digital assets more collectible and valuable. Moreover, NFTs can potentially transform the gaming market by making a new market for virtual assets. Players can now sell, trade and buy virtual items with ownership that is verifiable. This enables new economic systems within games and new forms of gameplay. Furthermore, NFTs can create new opportunities in the music industry by enabling artists to monetize their work apart from traditional channels. NFTs can represent concert tickets, unique digital collectibles and even ownership rights of songs. NFTs are transforming the digital world by offering new methods of monetizing and authenticating digital assets. They can create new markets and opportunities across multiple industries by making them fast-evolving technology.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program How Does the Future of NFT Look Like? NFT has enhanced media exposure and special perks for aspiring artists on social media. Recently, Jack Dorsey, the CEO and co-founder of Twitter, with his very first and famous tweet, \"just setting up my twttr,\" and Vignesh Sundaresan, famously known as \"Metakovan,\" bought 69.3 million dollars worth of NFT art on Beeple. Owing to its increasing popularity, people are now willing to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for NFTs. Like David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50-foot Blockchain, many experts in the crypto industry say that around 40% of new crypto users will use NFTs as their entry point. As a result of its growing popularity, NFT could represent a more significant part of the digital economy in the future."

        "title": "Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Why market volatility could resume this week - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price remains range bound, sliding horizontally at $26,139 with indications of a possible move soon.\n\nEthereum price is stuck in a range but could test the $1,630 support soon amid resuming volatility.\n\nRipple price climbed above the $0.5000 psychological level over the weekend and could continue north if bulls steady their hands.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price continues to consolidate, same case for Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices. However, this might chance this week as the market braces for key macroeconomics as well as timelines for spot BTC ETFs closing in.\n\nBitcoin price could be ready for its next move after almost two weeks of consolidation. The anticipation comes as the US market prepares for three key macroeconomics this week- The consumer confidence report, slated for Tuesday, followed by the Core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index, and Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) later in the week.\n\nAnother possible driver for the market this week will be the anticipation of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) expected to provide a decision for Bitwise, BlackRock, VanEck, WisdomTree, Invesco, Galaxy, Fidelity, and Valkyrie. Nevertheless, owing to the recent dry-up in macroeconomics' relationship to BTC price and with the SEC's recent history of delays, the impact could be fleeting.\n\nAlso Read: Will volatility be back to crypto markets?\n\nBitcoin price could move soon\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price continues to test the upper boundary of a longstanding demand zone at $26,154, with minimal volatility as the market remains devoid of impulse. However, momentum indicators suggest a possible move to the upside, and BTC could soon test the $27,300 resistance level.\n\nGiven the current market state, Bitcoin price could extend north, tagging the supply zone (red order block) at $28,973, with selling pressure from this area likely to trigger a correction. However, BTC must record a decisive daily candlestick above the range high at $31,130 for a confirmed uptrend. Such a move would constitute a 20% climb, with the most likely trigger being a spot BTC ETF approval.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is rising, while the histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator flash green, suggesting bullish dominance that could soon translate into a positive price move.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, considering the position of the RSI at 27 and that the AO was still negative, bears still have the advantage, and Bitcoin price could dip into the green order block (demand zone). For a confirmed downtrend, BTC must confirm below the lower boundary of the demand zone at $25,174 to render it a bearish breaker.\n\nIn the dire case, Bitcoin price could tag the $24,079 support level, marking a 10% slump from current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin traders remain fearful of 'tail risk' amid renewed price lull: Observers.\n\nEthereum price bends to selling pressure\n\nEthereum (ETH) price outlook opposes that of BTC, showing signs of a downtrend. It comes after the network's co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, executed a huge transaction, moving 3,000 ETH to an address labeled \"Vb 2.\" The impact is yet to be seen as the PoS token continues consolidating.\n\nWith momentum indicators (RSI and AO) favoring the downside, Ethereum price could break below the immediate support level at $1,630. In the dire case, the largest altcoin by market capitalization could test the August 17 lows at $1,552. This would denote a 5% fall below the current price.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flipside, bullish momentum, possibly sprouting from Bitcoin price showing strength, could send Ethereum price north, breaching the $1,699 resistance level and potentially making a 10% climb to the supply zone at $1,835.\n\nA strong move above this zone could set the tone for Ethereum price to breach the psychological $2,000, potentially tagging the July 13 high at $2,008. A decisive break above this level would confirm the uptrend.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum is eyeing $1500 support with A-B-C drop\n\nRipple price remains indecisive\n\nRipple (XRP) price remains indecisive, with the RSI still moving horizontally. The remittance token continues to wind along $0.5203. For a confirmed downtrend, XRP must record a daily close below the mean threshold of the order block at $0.4800.\n\nFor as long as Ripple price continues to consolidate above this level, the odds for an uptrend outweigh that of a downtrend, with the possibility of XRP breaching the $0.5752 level and, in a highly bullish case, tag the monthly high of $0.6840.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, selling pressure could send Ripple price below the order block to tag the range low at $0.4191.\n\nAlso Read: Celsius bankruptcy judge denies classification of CEL as a security, rejects precedent set in Ripple XRP case"

They are the first in the list of supported e-money coins. So, what is the difference between these giants of the blockchain world?\n\nIf we talk specifically about the gambling industry, there is no big difference between them. Bitcoin is by far the most widespread and more widely used than Ethereum. Both cryptocurrencies are very fast in transactions, although Ethereum has many more advantages, such as speed \u2014 ETH casinos pay you faster because Ethereum has an up-to-date block processing system, while BTC falls behind.\n\nThus, it is difficult to say that a Bitcoin casino is better than an online Ethereum casino or vice versa, as this is a matter of taste and experience. The main thing is that the casino is reliable and safe, and the choice of currency depends only on the player.\n\n\n\nIf you have already decided for sure that Ethereum is not your choice, you can find here the best bitcoin gambling sites.\n\nPros & Cons of Ethereum Gambling\n\ngame table roulette keyboard\n\nTo decide whether you are interested in Ethereum gambling, let's see what advantages and disadvantages this type has.\n\nPros\n\ninstantaneous transactions\n\nprivacy & anonymity\n\nlow or zero transaction fees\n\npeer-to-peer connectivity\n\nbigger bonuses\n\nCons\n\nscalability issues\n\nhigh volatility\n\n\n\nGetting Started with an ETH Casino\n\nlaptop online casino registration\n\nIf you are new to crypto gambling, you need to compensate for the lack of experience and solid base knowledge, which we have prepared in the mini-guide format to start your ETH Casino adventure.\n\nRegistration at Crypto Casinos\n\nRegistration in any crypto casino is presented in a much more simplified format than in a traditional online casino. Thanks to the blockchain system, users do not need to provide personal documents to verify their identity, as anonymity is a key concept in the crypto industry. To create an account, you must fill out a simple form: email, username, password, and date of birth. Usually, filling out the form is common for all Ethereum gambling sites.\n\nHow to Deposit/Withdraw ETH\n\nPerforming transactions with Ethereum does not require special knowledge. That is just a set of specific actions. To make a deposit, you should first register on your chosen site. Then enter the address of your wallet where Ethereum is stored and enter the desired amount. The money will be credited to your gaming account within a few minutes.\n\nYou must go to the Receive section to withdraw winnings from your gaming account. Make sure you choose the correct cryptocurrency. If the cryptocurrency is selected correctly, you will see the address of your wallet. Then copy and paste the address to the cashier page of the casino site and enter the amount you want to withdraw.\n\nWagering Requirements in Ethereum Casinos\n\nWagering requirements are the minimum number of bets a player makes to withdraw money from a gaming account. The online casino sets wagering.\n\nLet's see how wagering works on the example of the Welcome Bonus from Bets.io Casino. The essence of the bonus is as follows: you should make a first deposit of at least 0.001 BTC to receive a 100% bonus. The wagering amount is x40. Hence, the bonus received after the deposit should be wagered (played) 40 times.\n\nIn general, there are no special features for Wager Requirements with ETH. The main thing is to remember to meet these requirements. Always carefully read the conditions for receiving Ethereum bonuses so that they are realistically feasible.\n\nHow to Buy ETH?\n\nThere are several ways to buy ETH. The simplest and most understandable is a crypto exchange. There are many different exchanges: Binance, Coinbase Exchange, CoinDCX, and many others. Find the conditions for buying cryptocurrency from different exchangers and choose the most convenient one.\n\nMany Ethereum online casinos, such as Stake and BC.Game, offer the function of buying ETH directly through the site using Visa and Mastercard credit cards. That is a very handy feature, and all operators should introduce it.\n\nHow To Gamble Responsibly With Ethereum?\n\nResponsible gambling can be viewed from two perspectives: from the side of the player and the side of the Ethereum gambling casino. Each online casino operator should have a Responsible Gambling section, where the issues of temporary and irrevocable self-exclusion, raising and lowering limits, and card blocking are considered in detail.\n\nAll sites licensed in Curacao are required to adhere to the Responsible Gambling Policy. That includes three aspects:\n\ninforming players about the nature of gambling;\n\nencouraging players to bet within reasonable limits;\n\nproviding complete information about the games.\n\nIgnoring the principles of responsible gambling by users can lead to unpleasant consequences \u2014 gambling addiction.\n\nSigns of Gambling Addiction\n\nTo prevent obsessive gambling, you must know what signs may indicate this. Carefully read the list below so that you and your family are out of the risk zone and receive timely assistance if necessary.\n\nPlanning gambling activities;\n\nChanging the range of habitual interests;\n\nState of mental discomfort after stopping the game;\n\nThe desire for high-risk and high uncontrollable costs;\n\nLoss of control after a failed bet.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nCrypto gambling is already on the way to gaining a solid background that will speed up the process of its legalization. This review has looked at the best gambling websites for this new online entertainment niche. We hope that will help you choose the best Ethereum gambling website!\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nIf you or someone in your family suffers from obsessive gambling, we strongly encourage you to call 1-800-522-4700 and get counseling with the National Problem Gambling specialists.\n\nIt is more important to be able to prevent a problem than to deal with it. Hence, use the sites below to prevent gambling addiction:"

        "title": "Lido 101: A complete guide to Ethereum's liquid staking solution - OKX",
        "content": "Have you ever wanted to earn staking rewards without the constraints of locking up your assets? If so, Lido might be the answer. It's emerging as the go-to liquid staking solution, witnessing a rise in adoption with over $14 billion in staked tokens by August 2023.\n\nLido's approach aims to democratize rewards for even modest deposits and provides unparalleled utility without the traditional constraints of asset lock-ups.\n\nIn this article, we'll take a deep dive into Lido's ecosystem, Lido DAO, and Lido staked tokens, while also exploring liquid staking.\n\nWhat is Lido?\n\nLido is an Ethereum-centric platform designed to transform how we approach staking. Unlike the traditional staking method where assets are locked in and might remain dormant, Lido provides a dynamic avenue where staked assets stay active.\n\nWhen users stake their ETH on Lido, they receive 'stETH' tokens, which represent their staked assets on a 1:1 basis. This mechanism makes sure assets aren't just sitting idle; they're actively participating in the ecosystem, accruing value, and contributing to network security.\n\nWhat is liquid staking?\n\nTraditional staking, especially in Proof of Stake (PoS) systems, usually requires committing tokens for a set period, effectively immobilizing them in return for fixed rewards. While this model provides stability, it restricts the liquidity and utility of the staked assets. Liquid staking, as championed by Lido, challenges this norm.\n\nInstead of constraining assets, it transforms them into fungible tokens (like stETH), which can be traded, used as collateral, or engaged in various decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. This fluidity amplifies the utility of staked assets, allowing holders to gain staking rewards while leveraging them for other rewarding opportunities.\n\nLido's innovative approach hasn't gone unnoticed. Leading blockchain staking providers, especially from platforms like Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana, have supported Lido. Such endorsements point to Lido's potential in redefining staking tactics and its pivotal role in enhancing the broader PoS landscape.\n\nHow do double-dipped yields work?\n\nIt may sound like a tempting dessert, but double-dipped yields offer something even sweeter; they can simultaneously earn staking rewards while tapping into other lucrative DeFi opportunities.\n\nLido offers the ability for users to earn staking rewards without locking away their assets in a static state. It provides a unique blend of asset growth through staking rewards and fluidity, ensuring assets aren't idly lying dormant but are actively engaged in DeFi activities. How's that possible? Through a new class of tokens known as stTokens.\n\nThese aren't your ordinary tokens. They represent staked assets on Lido, acting as a liquid proxy for the underlying asset. stETH serves as a liquid stand-in for Ethereum (ETH) staked on Lido, bLUNA is staked (Luna) tokens, and stSOL is staked Solana (SOL) on Lido.\n\nThe DeFi advantage of stTokens\n\nThe DeFi ecosystem thrives on liquidity and versatility, and stTokens are custom-built for this environment. Here\u2019s why they stand out:\n\nLiquidity: While your underlying assets are staked and securing their respective networks, the stTokens (like stETH, bLUNA, or stSOL) can be freely traded or used in various DeFi protocols.\n\nInteroperability: Many DeFi platforms recognize stTokens. This means you can use them as collateral, engage them in yield farming, or leverage them in other financial strategies.\n\nContinuous rewards: Holding onto stTokens doesn\u2019t halt your staking rewards. The value of these tokens increases over time, reflecting the staking rewards you earn from the underlying assets.\n\nWhat are the staked Lido tokens, stETH, bLUNA, and stSOL?\n\nstETH (Lido staked Ether)\n\nAsset represented: Ethereum (ETH)\n\nPlatform: Lido\n\nFunction: For every Ethereum token staked through Lido, users receive an equivalent amount of stETH. This token is a dynamic representation of the staked ETH, reflecting its value and accumulated rewards over time. With stETH, users can participate in the DeFi ecosystem without withdrawing or un-staking their original Ethereum assets.\n\nbLUNA (bonded Luna)\n\nAsset represented: Luna\n\nPlatform: Terra\n\nFunction: bLUNA is a liquid representation of staked Luna tokens. When Luna is staked, users receive bLUNA, which can then be used within the Terra ecosystem and other DeFi platforms. It allows users to gain staking rewards and simultaneously use bLUNA for various financial strategies.\n\nstSOL (Lido staked Solana)\n\nAsset represented: Solana (SOL)\n\nPlatform: Lido\n\nFunction: Similar to stETH, holders are rewarded with an equivalent amount of stSOL for every Solana token staked on Lido. This token captures the essence of the staked SOL, granting users liquidity and enabling active participation in the DeFi sphere without un-staking their Solana assets.\n\nBalances and the role of oracles in Lido\n\nThe balance of staked tokens, such as stETH, isn't static. As users earn staking rewards, these balances need periodic updating to reflect the accrued rewards.\n\nThis is where oracles come into play. Oracles are third-party services that provide smart contracts with external information. In the context of Lido, oracles monitor the rewards generated by staked assets and relay this data back to the platform.\n\nLido then uses this information to adjust the balances of staked tokens in users' wallets. Oracles are the bridge between the blockchain and the real-world data of staking rewards, ensuring users see accurate, up-to-date balances for their staked assets.\n\nWhat is the Lido DAO (LDO) token?\n\nLido DAO, or the Lido Decentralized Autonomous Organization, oversees a liquid staking service built for the Ethereum ecosystem. This service allows users to stake their Ethereum (ETH) tokens transparently, without the need for custody, reinforcing the stability of the broader Ethereum landscape.\n\nWhy a DAO?\n\nThe dynamic nature of Ethereum requires a flexible system. In its quest to stay ahead of Ethereum's evolving ecosystem, Lido finds its most optimal structure in a DAO. This structure helps to keep Lido agile, making necessary adjustments in response to any changes in Ethereum's protocol.\n\nLido, being a DAO, also benefits from the transparent management of accumulated fees. These funds cater to developmental and insurance costs, making sure allocations align with the community's best interests.\n\nKey roles of Lido DAO\n\nInitialization of Lido: This involves the deployment of protocol smart contracts, defining fees and other protocol metrics, and facilitating the secure and efficient creation of staking rewards.\n\nAdaptation: The Lido DAO is responsible for seamlessly adapting Lido's mechanism in alignment with Ethereum 2.0 updates. This includes the transparent management of funds and revising staking services as needed.\n\nStakeholder involvement: Through the Lido DAO, decisions regarding incentives for contributors, the allocation of node operators, and the monitoring of voting parameters are streamlined, all with the goal of optimal staking services.\n\nThe Lido DAO continually engages in active voting, assessing parameters like node operator additions and their corresponding validator numbers. These decisions can be observed in real time, underscoring the transparency that defines Lido.\n\nIntroducing the LDO token\n\nLido's mission with its DAO is to democratize decision-making, aiming for a trustless staking service that emphasizes community-driven growth and sustainability. The LDO token is central to this mission, fostering decentralized ownership and facilitating a governance structure where every voice counts.\n\nOwning LDO tokens is akin to sitting at Lido's decision-making table. LDO holders can vote on any of the subjects affecting Lido.\n\nThe LDO holder's vote is directly proportional to their LDO holdings. Those with more LDO tokens possess a more influential voice in the voting process. The LDO voting mechanism can be enhanced and modified, just like other facets of the DAO.\n\nHow does Lido compare with other staking solutions?\n\nHere's how Lido compares to other staking solutions. While exploring other platforms, it's important to do your due diligence before you decide which platform to stake on.\n\nRocket Pool\n\nLike Lido, Rocket Pool also offers its own token, rETH, representing the amount of ETH staked in the system. It also serves as a source of staking rewards. Rocket Pool offers:\n\nPros\n\nDecentralized staking: A decentralized approach for ETH 2.0 staking.\n\nNode operator network: Uses a network of individual node operators.\n\nOpen-sourced smart contracts: Uses audited, open-sourced contracts to enhance security.\n\nCons\n\nRisk: Users entrust their Ethereum to Rocket Pool's validators, risking potential loss if those validators act maliciously.\n\nCentralization concerns: Despite its decentralized claim, Rocket Pool relies heavily on a limited number of validators, leading to potential centralization if few validators control a significant stake.\n\nHigh fees: There are reports from users that fees can go as high as 20% on rewards.\n\nStakeWise\n\nStakeWise is a staking service provider for Ethereum, offering pooled and solo staking options. With a non-custodial system, it gives users control over their Ethereum. When users stake with StakeWise, they receive sETH2 tokens, which can be used across the Ethereum-based DeFi ecosystem.\n\nPros\n\nsETH2 tokens: Users receive these tokens upon staking, and they're usable across the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem.\n\nNon-custodial system: Users retain Ethereum control without relying on a third party.\n\nSolo staking option: For those holding 32 ETH or more, solo staking allows staking without running one's own node. It's beneficial for non-technical users with enough ETH.\n\nCons\n\nRisk of counterparty involvement: There's potential exposure to counterparty risks.\n\nFee structure: The platform charges higher fees than some alternatives.\n\nFrax Ether\n\nFrax Ether launched in 2022, and its appealing functionalities have quickly won over crypto natives. The platform operates within its own Frax ecosystem to enhance yield and streamline the staking experience.\n\nPros\n\nCommunity control: Operates in a decentralized manner, driven by the Frax holder community.\n\nStability: Being a stablecoin, Frax provides an avenue for those wishing to sidestep market volatility.\n\nEfficiency and popularity: It has streamlined the liquid staking system and rapidly gained substantial traction.\n\nCons\n\nMarket adoption: Frax Ether faces challenges in market risk and mainstream adoption.\n\nUser friendliness: Its interface can be complicated for those new to staking.\n\nFor Ethereum staking service providers, Lido stands out for its simplicity, safety, and efficiency. Its significant liquidity provides flexibility within the DeFi ecosystem, distinguishing it as a noteworthy choice for those interested in ETH staking. However, its fees are relatively high compared to some other platforms.\n\nThe final word\n\nLido's pioneering take on liquid staking means assets are no longer tied down but actively flourishing within the broader DeFi landscape. By introducing stETH and other stTokens, Lido replicates the staked assets and keeps them agile, allowing users to integrate with various DeFi protocols seamlessly.\n\nLido isn't just a theoretical endeavor; it's secured the backing of major staking providers across platforms like Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana. This widespread acknowledgement showcases Lido's transformative potential for staking methods, suggesting its foundational role in sculpting the PoS universe's future.\n\nWhile traditional staking offers security, Lido bridges the gap between stability and liquidity. The dual advantage of earning staking rewards while diving into other DeFi prospects makes Lido a significant contender in redefining staking's ethos. Lido's approach could set the standard, demonstrating that assets can be secure and versatile in an ever-evolving decentralized finance landscape.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nTHIS ARTICLE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

        "content": "The ever-evolving decentralized finance (DeFi) space constantly witnesses changes in the market dynamics of the best DeFi cryptos. One such crypto is Ethereum (ETH), which displays signals of a potential rebound spurred by a recent anonymous purchase of ETH tokens worth $94 million. Another crypto that induces a positive change in the present market dynamics is InQubeta (QUBE).\n\nInQubeta is an emerging crypto platform that leverages the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology, and its ongoing successful presale is positioning it as one of the best cryptos to buy in the DeFi market. The impressive success of its presale has prompted crypto enthusiasts to forecast a potential 100X appreciation in its value by 2024.\n\nLet\u2019s investigate why InQubeta enthusiasts forecast a 100x increase by 2024 as signals emerge for Ethereum\u2019s potential rebound.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s (QUBE) Growth Trajectory Attracts Global Crypto Investors\n\nInQubeta is a newly introduced cryptocurrency crowdfunding initiative that leverages the fundamental tenets of decentralization to empower crypto enthusiasts by applying AI technology. InQubeta is gaining traction as one of the best cryptos to buy, as it presents a gateway for global crypto investors to engage in fractional investments linked to lucrative AI startup ventures. InQubeta\u2019s native token is QUBE, an ERC-20 standard token that drives the operational dynamics of the InQubeta ecosystem.\n\nCurrently valued at $0.0112 per token, QUBE has garnered an impressive sum of over $2.3 million during its ongoing live presale, solidifying its position as the best crypto investment for profit-oriented investors within the crypto world. The token\u2019s growth trajectory within the crypto AI industry is undeniable, with more than 81% of its token supply already sold during the third stage of the presale. This notable achievement has drawn the attention of esteemed cryptocurrency enthusiasts, who have predicted an increase of up to 100 times the QUBE token\u2019s value by 2024.\n\nInQubeta also possesses a revolutionary NFT marketplace that enables AI startups to generate revenue by curating and presenting distinctive NFTs. These exclusive NFTs, which can be purchased using the QUBE tokens, provide attractive incentives and ownership privileges to global crypto investors. This intricately devised mechanism effectively nurtures a mutually beneficial ecosystem where investors are poised to reap profits while supporting the growth and progression of AI startups.\n\nThe QUBE token incorporates a deflationary mechanism that serves as a major catalyst for its increase in value. A 2% levy is imposed on both the buying and selling transactions of the token, with the resultant proceeds channeled into a dedicated burn wallet. An additional 5% charge is applied to QUBE transactions, with the generated funds directed into InQubeta\u2019s reward pool.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Revolutionizes Decentralization in the Crypto World\n\nEthereum is a leading blockchain platform that harnesses its technological capabilities to enhance the principle of decentralization within the crypto industry. Ethereum has undeniably played a significant role in propelling the exponential growth of cryptocurrency and the world\u2019s financial markets. This is due to its noteworthy strides in seamlessly integrating the best DeFi smart contracts and enabling decentralized application (dApp) development. Ethereum\u2019s primary goal is to facilitate the creation and deployment of resilient software meticulously designed to withstand censorship, disruptions, and fraudulent activities within the DeFi market.\n\nEther, commonly denoted as ETH, is the native token central to the architecture of the Ethereum network. Renowned crypto analysts have predicted a potential rebound of the ETH token in the DeFi market. This projection resulted from the recent acquisition of the tokens, valued at approximately $94 million, by four anonymous crypto whales. The size of these purchases possesses the capacity to exert favorable influences on the market valuation and operational dynamics of the ETH token soon.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe recent massive acquisition of the ETH token is signaling a potential rebound for the Ethereum ecosystem. At the same time, InQubeta is gradually becoming the best crypto investment for global investors seeking maximum profit. Its swift expansion within the crypto AI industry has led crypto enthusiasts to forecast a potential 100-fold increase in its valuation by 2024. Crypto enthusiasts interested in advancing AI technology can secure a minimum of $50 worth of QUBE tokens from the available supply of 85,000,000 tokens offered during the third phase of the presale.

        "title": "GBTC Victory Opens Door for Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ethereum ETFs - Bankless Times",
        "content": "Bitcoin price popped sharply on Tuesday after the US appeals court ruled that the SEC acted arbitrarily when it rejected Grayscale filing to convert GBTC into an ETF. The decision ignited a major crypto comeback, with the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies soaring to over $1.09 trillion.\n\nThe ruling on Grayscale is important because the SEC is currently reviewing other spot Bitcoin ETFs by the likes of Invesco, Blackrock and WisdomTree. This decision will come as soon as this week. As I wrote on Tuesday, the SEC could decide to approve, reject, or delay the ETF proposals.\n\nI believe that the SEC will seek more time to review these proposals and the court ruling on Grayscale case. Ultimately, however, I suspect that the agency will be forced to accept these proposals.\n\nFor one, the recent proposals offer some improvements compared with the initial ones. For one, they include a surveillance clause that helps to prevent market manipulation in the ETF. Also, gold ETFs like the SPDR Gold Trust have always existed and I see no big difference between BTC and gold.\n\nThe other important takeaway to consider is that companies could seek to launch more crypto ETFs if a Bitcoin fund is listed. The most obvious candidates for these funds are cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, and Litecoin.\n\nThese three coins are extremely similar to Bitcoin since they all emerged from their forks. Unlike most other coins, BCH, BSV, and Litecoin are all proof-of-work coins that have no staking features. The SEC does not view them as financial securities.\n\nThe only challenge with some of these coins, especially Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin Cash is that they tend to have low daily trading volume. As such, they might prove to be unprofitable for ETF companies.\n\nAn Ethereum ETF could also be launched since it is the second-biggest cryptocurrency in the world. It is also the second most liquid coin in the industry, one that helps power most sectors like DeFi and NFTs.\n\nThe challenge for Ethereum is that it transitioned from a proof-of-work (PoW) into a proof-of-stake (PoS) network after the merge. As a result, by combining with the Beacon Chain, it initiated staking in its platform. Therefore, the SEC likely sees it as a security, which could make its approval challenging. Other coins with potential for ETFs are Tron, Cardano, and Polygon."

        "content": "After a brief lull, market sentiment in the cryptocurrency market seems to be highly optimistic. Not only have analysts predicted a recovery for Ethereum, but they are also quite hopeful that the newly launched InQubeta (QUBE) will grow by 1,000% by 2024.\n\nWhile Ethereum has been a top crypto to invest in for years, the meteoric rise of InQuebta has taken many users by surprise. The Ethereum-based platform is a one-of-a-kind portal for startups working with artificial intelligence which makes investment opportunities more accessible to these companies. The platform serves as a bridge between startups and potential investors while helping both parties access genuine opportunities. What\u2019s more, is that its security framework is built on a robust mechanism that has been screened by world-leading blockchain audit companies.\n\nThe project is currently in its presale stage and the cryptocurrency ico has raked in over $2.3 million in presale funding.\n\nInQubeta: Building a new league of AI startups with DeFi\n\nInQubeta is a next-generation platform striving to help startups build the future of AI by helping them land funding opportunities. At the same time, InQubeta allows investors to access promising projects that leverage cutting-edge technologies before they hit the market. The platform\u2019s native cryptocurrency is used for all transactions and distribution of rewards. Based on the ERC-20 standard, the native coin is called the QUBE token.\n\nThe QUBE token can currently be bought on presale. However, it has a lock-in period of 12 weeks and buyers will get their purchased coins after the vesting period ends. The InQubeta team has maintained that by introducing a vesting period, it can release the QUBE tokens in a phased manner and is not forced to dump them in one go and risk a supply glut.\n\nThe token has a deflationary model which is helpful in curbing price fluctuations and keeping the token value stable. Under the model, the token supply is made scarce by keeping it less than the demand and burning the extra tokens.\n\nAnother popular feature of the token is that it helps in the implementation of InQubeta\u2019s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) model. In decentralized governance, all stakeholders are given the freedom to suggest changes to the protocol that can improve its scope and voice their concerns about operations. If they want any changes to be implemented, they can move a proposal. The proposal is put to a vote and QUBE token holders with voting rights vote for them.\n\nInQubeta is among the new altcoins that have garnered a lot of attention for their user-friendly interface and utility-centric models. Startups who want to explore new opportunities on the platform have to decide on what they have to offer the investor in exchange. Their offer could be a reward level or a share in their company\u2019s equity. Next, these offers are tokenized, converted into NFTs, and posted in InQubeta\u2019s NFT marketplace. At the NFT marketplace, potential investors can evaluate and buy the NFTs by paying for them with QUBE tokens. Investors also have the option of purchasing small parts or fractions of these NFTs.\n\nThe pre-order campaign for Ethereum phones is now live\n\nEthereum is a leading cryptocurrency that balances versatility with functionality. The ETH network powers cryptocurrency tokens, virtual machines, NFTs, and various kinds of decentralized platforms. Its native cryptocurrency is the ETH token and it\u2019s among the most-traded cryptocurrencies in the world. In 2022, Ethereum switched to the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm from the proof-of-work protocol in a software upgrade that lasted for months and was dubbed \u2018The Merge\u2019. The Ethereum cryptocurrency is currently being accumulated heavily and seems to be poised for recovery as per many experts.\n\nIn a recent development, the pre-order campaign for Ethereum phones also went live in the US, Europe, and Canada. These phones are powered by the Ethereum OS and feature a decentralized messenger, a Web 3.0 non-custodial wallet, and a crypto payments tool, among others.\n\nConclusion\n\nBoth Ethereum and InQubeta are being considered as the best altcoins for 2023 by many experts and have proved their mettle with their market performance. However, when it comes to thinking about the long term, most analysts are likely to point you toward InQubeta because of its higher growth potential. The Ethereum-based platform seeks to transform the startup sector by paving the way for more investment opportunities. The model will be instrumental in not only boosting startups\u2019 growth but also helping QUBE token holders create a sustained source of income through investment in promising AI-based projects. Its latest ico has also set the ball rolling for what is expected to be an eventful inning in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin InQubeta Communities\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe team behind decentralized Bitcoin infrastructure provider Interlay today unveiled the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of its BOB (\"Build on Bitcoin\") solution.\n\nBOB, which comes on the heels of last month\u2019s launch of Interlays\u2019 Bitcoin DeFi Hub, is billed as a Bitcoin Layer-2 network that introduces Rust smart contracts compatible with Bitcoin libraries such as Lightning and Ordinals.\n\nWith the full support of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the developers see BOB as a go-to platform for fostering innovation, experimentation, and the development of novel decentralized applications atop Bitcoin's robust foundation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOur goal is to enable builders to create truly decentralized applications and innovate on top of Bitcoin\u2019s existing stack, including Lightning, Ordinals and Nostr,\u201d Interlay co-founder Alexei Zamyatin said in a statement. \u201cThereby, BOB bets on enabling builders from Ethereum and other ecosystems to quickly bring their DeFi, NFT and other web3 products to Bitcoin\u2019s 300 million users.\u201d\n\nInterlay, which to date has raised a total of $9.5 million in venture funding, has previously also experimented with tokenized Bitcoin, helping to develop a cross-chain bridge to Polkadot.\n\nThe BRC-21 token standard\n\nNotably, the release includes a demonstration application that implements BRC-21, a novel Bitcoin standard proposed by the Interlay team in May this year amid the hype surrounding the sudden emergence of the Ordinals protocol. The latter allows for the inscribing of digital content, such as art, onto the Bitcoin blockchain and uses the BRC-20 token standard.\n\n\u201cBRC-21 is a standard that uses the BRC-20 format of representing assets on Bitcoin to trustlessly bridge tokens from other chains to Bitcoin, for example decentralized stablecoins like DAI that live on Ethereum,\u201d Zamyatin told Decrypt. \u201cOn the Bitcoin side, the standard introduces \u2018mint\u2019 and \u2018redeem\u2019 operations that are verified by customized indexers.\u201d\n\nHe further explained that the mint and burn logic of the protocol, paired with the cryptographic verification of Bitcoin transactions, allows any ERC-20 token on Ethereum to be bridged to Bitcoin as a BRC-21 token in a fully trustless manner, without the need for any trusted oracles or custodians.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to Rust and EVM smart contracts, the release of BOB's MVP also features Interlay's trustless Bitcoin bridge and an integrated Bitcoin light client that utilizes cryptographic verification of the Bitcoin main chain.\n\nZamyatin added that there is also some logic that is necessary on the \u2018connected\u2019 chain, such as Ethereum, including \"a smart contract to lock/unlock bridged assets and a BTC-Relay\u2014a Bitcoin light client implemented as a smart contract that tracks the BTC main chain and can verify BTC transactions.\"\n\nAccording to Interlay, this functionality enables developers to establish trustless BTC, Ordinals, and BRC swaps, along with other Bitcoin primitives like hashrate markets.\n\nThe upcoming full-release timeline will incorporate compatibility with Ethereum, an innovative Bitcoin peg mechanism building upon Interlay's existing trustless BTC bridge, and Bitcoin rollup mechanisms.\n\n\u201cWe are working to have the mainnet live with launch partners, tooling and infrastructure before the Bitcoin halving. A public testnet for builders to start testing is scheduled for before Christmas this year,\u201d Zamyatin told Decrypt.\n\nUpgrades are \u2018necessary\u2019 for mass adoption of Bitcoin\n\nEfforts like Ordinals have raised the ire of some Bitcoin maximalists, who argue that as a tried-and-tested protocol that has been running for over a decade without any major security flaws, the Bitcoin blockchain should not be used for experiments because it could destabilize the network and erode public confidence in the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency. The Interlay co-founder, however, told Decrypt he firmly believes that we need to unlock more use cases for Bitcoin than just \u201chodling.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we do not provide people with tools to use Bitcoin for more than investment and remittance in a decentralized manner, we are basically pushing them to use centralized providers or less secure networks,\u201d Zamyatin said. \u201cFinancial freedom means different things for different people and I think it is ignorant to claim that \u2018stacking sats\u2019 and \u2018hodling\u2019 are the sole purposes of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, Layer-2s are the most promising path to enable experimentation without major changes to Bitcoin, which should act as the most secure and decentralized settlement layer for applications and layers built around and on top of it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe changes necessary to enable trustless Layer-2s need to be carefully evaluated and tested. I am not suggesting to rush an upgrade but an upgrade is definitely necessary if we want to see Bitcoin adopted globally,\u201d argued Zamyatin.\n\nThe Interlay co-founder went on to say that he is a Bitcoin \u201cmaxi\u201d himself, having spent the last eight years working on Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cI love what Bitcoin is and what it stands for,\" said Zamyatin, adding that he disagrees with \"cult-like maximalism and tribalism.\"\n\n\"I do not believe that Bitcoin \u2018is better than everything else at everything,\u2019\" he added. \"Ignorance is the death of innovation.\u201d\n\nDrawing parallels, he noted that once-dominant corporate giants like IBM, Kodak, Yahoo, Nokia, and Xerox had failed to realize that innovation is needed to survive and paid the ultimate price.\n\n\u201cI and many, many others do not want this to happen to Bitcoin,\" said Zamyatin. \"One could say Bitcoin is in the early stages of a renaissance.\""

        "content": "Mon 28 Aug 2023 \u25aa 7 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\n\u25aa Blockchain\n\nBlockchain technology has attracted massive interest due to the relevance of the solutions it offers. As this interest grows, so does the need to improve the operational efficiency of blockchain networks. In response, Layer 2 scaling solutions have emerged as efficient options. This is particularly true for so-called Layer 1 blockchains such as Ethereum. Thanks to Layer 2 scaling solutions, the challenges associated with Layer 1 blockchains have now been overcome. However, the growing adoption of Layer 2 solutions has given rise to a complex and competitive landscape. A dynamic marked by the emergence of several projects proposing varied approaches to solving scaling problems. At a time when the market for Layer 2 solutions is facing numerous challenges, an analysis of the key dynamics of this market is essential.\n\nLayer 2: what is it, concretely?\n\nIn a recent analysis, we spoke of challengers threatening to dethrone Ethereum as Layer 1 market leader. To fully understand the Layer 2 protocol, we need to return to the notion of Layer 1.\n\nLayer 1 is not unrelated to Layer 2, the subject of this analysis. The link between these two notions lies in their interaction within the ecosystem of blockchain technology.\n\nAs a reminder, Layer 1, also known as the \u201cfirst layer\u201d, refers to the main blockchain itself. It is in fact the fundamental crypto infrastructure where transactions and smart contracts are validated, recorded and then secured. This, via consensus mechanisms, such as proof-of-work (PoW) or proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nBut Layer 1 blockchains have functional limitations. They may therefore encounter restrictions. Their operational processing capacity is not optimal. The same applies to the transaction fees they charge. These are generally high, while transaction validation times are longer.\n\nLayer 2 blockchains have been designed to overcome these obstacles to Layer 1 operation. They incorporate various scaling solutions to reduce the workload on the main blockchain. This is achieved by moving certain activities off the main blockchain. What\u2019s more, Layer 2 protocols work in synergy with the Layer 1 blockchain.\n\nAs you can see, Layer 2 blockchain marks a major technological advance. This progress has been made against a backdrop of strong demand for efficient, scalable blockchain infrastructure. A unique set of assets that explain the sustained growth of the Layer 2 protocol market.\n\nLayer 2: current market trends and statistics\n\nThe market for Layer 2 protocols is extremely dynamic. And it\u2019s growing steadily. Here are a few key figures to illustrate this dynamism.\n\nThe total blocked value (TVL) of Layer 2 protocols is worth over $10 billion.\n\nCrypto-data provider Datawallet notes the growth of Layer 2 solutions within the Ethereum ecosystem. This evolution is remarkable when we look at the total value locked (TVL) linked to this technology.\n\nSince Tuesday, August 8, it has exceeded $10 billion in value. Layer 2 scaling solution Arbitrum One leads this trend, with a TVL of $6.01 billion, for a market share of 56.98%.\n\nArbitrum One is followed by OP Mainnet, which accounts for 27.01% of the market, with a TVL of $2.85 billion. With a market share of 4.06%, the Layer 2 zkSync protocol comes in 3\u1d49 position. Its TVL is estimated at $429 million. It is $337 million for dYdX, which captures 3.19% market share. Base closes the game, retaining just 1.37% market share with a TVL of $145 million.\n\nLayer 2 protocols massively adopted by centralized exchanges (CEX)\n\nAccording to Datawallet, Layer 2 scaling solutions are currently very popular. This is particularly true of CEXs such as Binance and Coinbase. The latter, for example, has introduced its basic Layer 2, a rollup using the OP stack. Crypto derivatives exchange Bybit has done the same with Mantle.\n\nThe list is by no means exhaustive. But these examples of major exchanges maneuvering around Layer 2 reflect the growing importance of this technology. This is helping to reinforce the scalability and efficiency of the crypto ecosystem.\n\nTrend towards Layer 2 solutions\n\nLayer 2 scaling solutions are technically so powerful that alternative Layer 1 blockchains are migrating to them. This is the case, for example, with Celo, a blockchain project developed by CLabs.\n\nAccording to Datawallet, this migration dynamic is not just a question of interoperability. Basically, it\u2019s financial motivations, and in particular cost-efficiency, that underpin the adoption of Layers 2.\n\nBy opting for this technological solution, crypto firms want to avoid the expense of issuing rewards. To achieve this, they want to take advantage of Ethereum\u2019s network security. A strategy that promises to improve liquidity sharing, developer experience and recognition of Layer 2\u2019s economic benefits. Moreover, this choice enables Layer 1 blockchains to allocate substantial resources to innovation. A policy that marks a turning point in the evolution of blockchain.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt has to be said that Layers 2 protocols are tending to redefine the crypto market, particularly that of Ethereum. This, by offering improved scalability that reduces transaction costs. Clearly, Layer 2 solutions are spearheading the evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem. However, as with any emerging technology, there are hurdles to overcome. In particular, there are potential centralization issues. Users and developers need to remain vigilant and understand the subtleties of each Layer 2 solution. A strategic choice that should enable them to make informed choices.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Immediately after Ethereum spiked on August 29, a whale bought 8,000 ETH at $1,709, spending 13.66 million USDC. ETH prices continue to rise, trading at around $1,740 when writing.\n\nThe coin may post even more gains in the sessions following a shift in trader sentiment after a favorable appellate court ruling in the case pitting Grayscale, the issuer of several trusts, including the Bitcoin Trust, versus the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe Grayscale Catalyst\n\nThe United States District of Columbia Court of Appeals faulted the SEC for not allowing Grayscale to convert the billions worth of over-the-counter (OTC) Bitcoin Trust to a Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). The SEC has already approved a Bitcoin Futures ETF that doesn\u2019t track the price of Bitcoin directly.\n\nIn their argument, Grayscale asserts that measures implemented to ensure that prices aggregated for the Bitcoin index used to guide the Bitcoin Futures ETF are safe. As such, the same could be applied in guaranteeing the credibility of data streams used as input for a Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nGrayscale added that their surveillance sharing agreements with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) should effectively flag and stamp out any attempt to manipulate Bitcoin prices.\n\nWill The SEC Approve An Ethereum Futures ETF?\n\nFollowing this development, it is likely that the SEC will approve a Bitcoin spot ETF in the coming months. However, nothing is guaranteed, as the asset manager still needs to complete a process controlled by the regulator.\n\nThis DOES NOT automatically mean GBTC is immediately converting into an ETF. It just means \u2014 as the court states \u2014 that the SEC failed to explain why it approved Bitcoin futures ETPs and not the Grayscale\u2019s proposed product. There is a process ahead\u2026 \u2014 Sonali Basak (@sonalibasak) August 29, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, several firms have applied for an Ethereum futures ETF. As of early August, six entities, including Bitwise, VanEck, and Grayscale, wanted to offer these products to investors. The SEC has yet to approve any Ethereum futures ETF.\n\nIt is unclear whether the SEC will proceed and allow the market to trade an Ethereum derivative this year. However, if the regulator is satisfied with all applications and green light them depending on their filing dates, Volatility Shares Ethereum futures ETF would be the first to hit the market as early as October 12.\n\nPresently, Bitcoin is trending higher after finding support at around $25,800. The expansion of BTC prices has benefited altcoins, and Ethereum is firm, breaking out. Looking at the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, ETH prices have broken above last week\u2019s resistance at $1,700.\n\nThe surge in ETH\u2019s price as of August 29 displays rising trading volumes, and the associated breakout bar is also wide-ranging. This could suggest that ETH buyers are engaged, and the coin may surge even higher in the days ahead. Looking at price action, the whale bought the breakout, around the $1,700 round number, and is currently in the money.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

        "content": "Ethereum has printed its lowest transaction fees for the year.\n\nThe protocol has been recording massive transaction counts without congestion struggle.\n\nEthereum transaction fees have reached their lowest levels since December in terms of usage. Just this weekend, the cost of executing transactions on the world\u2019s largest programmable blockchain and the parent platform of the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH), has dropped to 1,719 ETH which is valued at approximately $2.8 million.\n\nAccording to historical data from South Korea-based blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, this is the lowest single-day total since December 26th. Compared to the year-to-date high of 16,720 Ethereum reported on May 5th, the figure shows a massive plunge of 89%.\n\nUnlike leading digital asset Bitcoin (BTC) which uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, Ethereum leverages a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm that uses validators instead of miners to create and verify a new block for transactions. These validators help secure the network by staking at least 32 ETH each.\n\nUsually, they receive a portion of the transaction fees; validators get either the priority fee or the tip that users sometimes add to the base fee to entice validators so that they prioritize their transactions.\n\nThe primary base fee is burned to help reduce the Ethereum circulating supply. Markedly, the significant decline in total daily fee is evidence of low network usage. This is because fees are usually dependent on the amount of activity happening on the network, especially the number of pending transactions.\n\nThere are speculations that these new fees may be as a result of the growing popularity of the ETH Layer-2 scaling solutions which is a long-term positive development for the network.\n\nUtilization of Ethereum Layer-2 Scaling Solutions\n\nDavid Lawant, head of research at FalconX, pointed out that ETH Layer-1 fees have gone down by 25% compared to the average of the year since Friends.tech launched on Base on August 10th. Furthermore, he acknowledged that the decline is in sharp contrast to the times when the success of early Non-fungible token (NFT) application CryptoKitties or the latest Yuga Labs NFT drop would commonly temporarily clog the Ethereum network.\n\nLawant appreciated how the app was able to successfully gain meaningful traction without impacting any congestion on the underlying network. This milestone came on the heels of the latest development of ETH L2 swing solutions. Specifically, Friend.tech was designed on top of Coinbase Base which utilizes the Optimism Stack.\n\nGenerally, L2 scaling solutions like Optimism, Arbitrum and Base are crucial to scaling Ethereum.\n\nIn the process, it reduces the potential of congestion and helps keep transaction cost on the main network under control. IntoTheBlock data shows that number of daily transactions on Optimism Mainnet hit a new All-Time High (ATH) of almost 900,000 transactions on August 15th.\n\n\u201cAs competition between L2s grows, it becomes clear that Ethereum benefits,\u201d IntoTheBlock added. Meanwhile, Ethereum is currently trading at $1,645.92, having gained 0.40% in the past 24 hours per data from Marketcap.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "title": "OnlyFans invests in Ethereum: how much did it affect the price? - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Recently, Fenix International Limited, the well-known company behind OnlyFans, acquired Ethereum (ETH), one of the most prestigious crypto assets. But how much did this affect the coin\u2019s price?\n\nLet\u2019s look at all the details below.\n\nThe purchase by OnlyFans and the price considerations of Ethereum\n\nAs anticipated above, the British subscription-based adult content company, OnlyFans, entered the cryptocurrency arena in conjunction with a period of significant business expansion.\n\nAccording to filed financial data, OnlyFans has invested in Ethereum (ETH) worth $19,889 million.\n\nHowever, the value of acquired ETH was released immediately, resulting in an impairment loss of $8,455 million by 30 November 2022. As a result, Ethereum\u2019s remaining accounting value stands at $11,434 million.\n\nThis depreciation underscores how the initial investment in Ethereum has lost value, in line with recent fluctuations in the global cryptocurrency market.\n\nAccording to the submitted documentation, the cryptocurrency investment falls under the category of investment in intangible assets with an \u201cindefinite useful life.\u201d\n\nThis move by OnlyFans into the cryptocurrency world could have multiple implications, highlighting a deliberate purpose of diversification and adoption of blockchain technology.\n\nMoreover, this move comes in parallel with Ethereum\u2019s growing recognition as an attractive asset due to its potential as a solid store of value.\n\nIndeed, the increasing integration of Ethereum into mainstream financial institutions adds further appeal to this asset as a sustainable investment option.\n\nIn addition, this investment could be linked to Ethereum\u2019s ability to act a reserve, potentially reducing the magnitude of its fluctuations in response to movements in conventional financial markets.\n\nIn addition to its foray into cryptocurrencies, OnlyFans has previously expanded its financial strategy through initiatives regarding non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nIn fact, in February 2022, OnlyFans introduced a feature that allows users to view verified NFTs as their profile images. At present, the adult platform only allows the use of NFTs minted on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nFocus on the price of the Ethereum crypto\n\nDuring the month of August, Ethereum experienced the cancellation of all profits that had remained for a period longer than a month.\n\nThe alternative cryptocurrency leader suffered a sharp drop from the level of around $1,800 recorded two weeks ago and has since fluctuated in the $1,600 range.\n\nAt the moment, the value of ETH is pegged at about $1,649, denoting a decline of more than 11% over the past 30 days, according to CoinMarketCap. This correction in prices has also produced an effect on the overall profitability of the network.\n\nIn addition, a recent Glassnode update found that about 55.42% of all ETH addresses were profitable, marking the smallest value in seven months.\n\nThe level of profitability can also be assessed through the Net Unrealised Profit/Loss (NUPL) indicator. The latter basically represents the difference between unrealized profit and unrealized loss and makes it possible to determine whether the network is overall in a profit or loss state.\n\nAlthough the positive value confirmed that the network was in a net gaining phase, the profitability degree experienced a marked decrease. So, the NUPL dropped to 0.032 from the value of 0.13 before the correction in prices.\n\nIt is also interesting to note that the bearish trend in prices has failed to dent the enthusiasm of ETH stakeholders. Ignoring the ups and downs of the market, the amount of funds locked in Ethereum smart contracts has in fact continued to reach new peaks.\n\nAccording to the latest available update, more than 28 million ETH were staked on the network, equivalent to about 23% of Ethereum\u2019s entire circulating supply.\n\nThis significant increase in the amount of funds in play also highlights the confidence investors have placed in this mechanism, which was previously absent. Finally, since the implementation of Shapella\u2019s hard fork, the supply of ETH has increased by more than 50%."

        "content": "In a strategic move reflecting its growing interest in the crypto space, Fenix International, the parent company of the renowned subscription platform OnlyFans, disclosed that it invested approximately $20 million in Ethereum (ETH) between 2021 and 2022.\n\nAstute Investment in Ethereum\n\nAs per an August 24 financial filing (1) submitted to the UK corporate registry, Fenix International confirmed its acquisition of nearly $19.9 million worth of ETH during the period spanning 2021 to 2022. However, due to the market-wide decline in crypto asset values throughout the previous year, the total valuation of its Ether holdings experienced an $8.5 million decrease by November 2022.\n\nCalculated Ventures and Financial Trends\n\nSource: Fenix International\n\nBy November 30, 2022, a time when Ethereum was priced at $1,295 each, Fenix International's ETH holdings were valued at $11.4 million. Despite the initial downward movement in their crypto investments, the parent company witnessed robust growth in its core operations during the reporting period that concluded on November 30, 2022.\n\nSolid Revenue Growth and Platform Expansion\n\nThe filing revealed a notable 16.6% surge in the company's revenue, escalating from $4.8 billion in 2021 to $5.6 billion in 2022. Notably, the platform, which predominantly caters to adult entertainment, observed an impressive 47% rise in the number of content creators and a substantial 27% increase in total subscribers.\n\nCrypto Expansions Beyond Investments\n\nFenix International's cryptocurrency engagement extends beyond investments. In February 2022, the platform allowed verified creators to adopt Ethereum-based NFTs as profile pictures, demonstrating its willingness to experiment with digital assets.\n\nAdditionally, the company's executives ventured into the digital asset realm with the launch of \"Zoop\" in June 2022. This celebrity trading card platform, built on the Ethereum scaling solution Polygon, enabled users to trade 3D digital playing cards featuring their favorite celebrities."

        "content": "Decoding Ethereum\u2019s Gas Fees: Historical Trends, EIP-1559, and the Shift to PoS \u2013 A Comprehensive Guide\n\nBy Raghav Sawhney\n\nEthereum\u2019s Gas Fees: Navigating the Waves of Change\n\nEthereum, often dubbed the \u201cworld computer,\u201d has been a beacon for decentralized applications, smart contracts, and the DeFi movement. Its versatility and adaptability have made it a favorite among developers and investors alike. However, as with any pioneering technology, it has faced its share of challenges, with gas fees being a prominent one.\n\nThe Essence of Ethereum\u2019s Gas Fees\n\nAt its core, gas in Ethereum is a unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to execute operations, like making a transaction or running a contract. Users pay for this computational work in ETH, Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency. The total cost of a transaction is determined by multiplying the gas used by the gas price set by the user.\n\nHistorical Context: The Peaks and Troughs\n\nEthereum\u2019s gas fees have historically been a reflection of the network\u2019s demand. During the ICO boom of 2017 and the DeFi explosion in 2020, the Ethereum network saw unprecedented congestion. This surge in demand led to skyrocketing gas fees, with users sometimes paying exorbitant amounts to ensure their transactions were processed promptly.\n\nHowever, these peaks were often followed by troughs. Periods of lower network activity naturally led to reduced gas fees, providing relief to users. The recent dip to an 8-month low of $28 million in daily transaction fees is a testament to this ebb and flow.\n\nThe Shift to Proof-of-Stake and Its Implications\n\nEthereum\u2019s transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism is monumental. In PoW, miners solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new blocks. In PoS, validators replace miners. These validators are chosen based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and are willing to \u201cstake\u201d or lock up as collateral.\n\nIn this new system, validators receive the priority fee or tip added by users to entice them to process their transactions faster. The base fee, rather than going to the validators, is burned, removing it from the total supply of ETH. This burning mechanism has profound implications for the economic model of Ethereum, potentially making ETH deflationary over time.\n\nEIP-1559: A Game-Changer for Gas Fees\n\nThe introduction of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 marked a significant shift in how gas fees are determined. Before EIP-1559, users would engage in a bidding war, often overpaying to ensure their transactions were processed. With EIP-1559, the network sets a \u201cbase fee\u201d for transactions based on network demand, providing more predictability and fairness in transaction costs.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nWhile the recent dip in transaction fees is a welcome respite for users, the Ethereum community knows that long-term solutions are essential for the platform\u2019s sustainability. Layer 2 scaling solutions, like rollups, are being explored and implemented to offload some of the transactional volume from the main chain, ensuring faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey is emblematic of the broader blockchain industry\u2019s growth trajectory: filled with challenges, innovations, setbacks, and triumphs. The gas fee saga is but one chapter in this ongoing story, highlighting the platform\u2019s adaptability and the community\u2019s unwavering commitment to creating a decentralized future.\n\nRaghav Sawhney Raghav is a significant contributer who uses his knowledge, skills and experience towards development & growth of the organisation in an efficient and effective manner.\n\n"

The mainnet had previously recorded over 100,000 addresses days after its public launch.\n\nWith new users swarming the network, Lucie has deemed it essential to provide detailed information to users who do not know how to navigate transactions between Shibarium and Ethereum.\n\nIn the guide posted by Lucie, she illustrated several important steps to withdraw from Shibarium to Ethereum. She stated that users should have or fund their wallets with enough Ethereum tokens, ETH, to cover gas fees that would be charged during the transaction.\n\nLucie urged users to be patient during their transaction process. She clarified that it\u2019s not uncommon for transactions to be slow since L2 solutions utilizing a plasma bridge often have delays. Hence, users who are performing their transactions should not be flustered by a long waiting time.\n\nShe also explained that most delays occur due to security checks and verifications which are important to safeguard user\u2019s information and ensure that all transfers within the network are safe.\n\n\u201cDelays stem from security checks, exit challenges, confirmations, bridge mechanics, high demand, and network updates. These ensure safe transfers amidst network intricacies,\u201d Lucie stated.\n\nAccording to Shibarium Lead Developer, Shytoshi Kusaka, withdrawals on the layer 2 network\u2019s bridge have been sluggish, taking 45 minutes to 3 hours to complete a transaction.\n\nDespite the slow pace in withdrawals, Shiba Inu\u2019s price has been on an uptrend since the launch of the Shibarium mainnet. The cryptocurrency is currently growing to be one of the trendiest meme coins after Dogecoin.\n\nThe SHIB ecosystem is also running new projects which has caught the interest of many crypto investors and may push its price higher. CEO of the Stock Dork, Adam Garcia, and CEO of Moneyzine.com, Jonathan Merry, have also predicted considerable growth for the doggy cryptocurrency. They stated that the Shiba Inu token is expected to reach $0.01 with the support of the Shibarium mainnet and its burn mechanism.\n\nSHIB price still holding steady above $0.000008 | Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from DiarioBitcoin, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "content": "In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies, Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of Input Output (IOHK), has sparked a strong belief that Cardano (ADA) will not only emerge as a dominant player but also surpass the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAt the recent Rare Evo 2023 event in Denver, Hoskinson laid out his vision for Cardano, citing its scalability, interoperability, and potential to reshape societal infrastructure. However, amidst this optimism, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen warns of a potential \u201cdepression phase\u201d for Cardano\u2019s price, urging investors to trade carefully. In this post, we will delve into all these aspects, from Charles Hoskinso to Benjamin Cowen.\n\nCharles Hoskinson\u2019s Conviction: Cardano as the Future Leader\n\nHoskinson\u2019s keynote address at Rare Evo 2023 reflected his belief that Cardano possesses the fundamental qualities required to become the world\u2019s most trusted and valuable cryptocurrency.\n\nHoskinson argues that decentralized governance empowers individuals to create remarkable outcomes. With an emphasis on scalability and interoperability, Hoskinson envisions Cardano as more than just a cryptocurrency; he envisions it as the pioneer of a new digital society where trust and transparency reign supreme.\n\nCurrent Price Action: A Glimpse into ADA\u2019s Trajectory\n\nCurrently, Cardano is trading at $0.26 below the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day EMAs. Moreover, candlesticks form in the lower Bollinger Bands with an RSI of around 40. Overall, technical indicators suggest consolidation in the next few months with a strong support of around $0.23.\n\nCheck out our latest ADA prediction with detailed insights and technical and fundamental analysis that help you to make investment-related decisions. Despite Hoskinson\u2019s conviction, Cardano has yet to establish itself as the frontrunner because it is the eighth-largest digital asset based on market cap. On the contrary, Benjamin Cowen suggests a bearish phase.\n\nThe \u201cDepression Phase\u201d: Benjamin Cowen\u2019s Perspective\n\nContrasting Hoskinson\u2019s enthusiasm, Benjamin Cowen, a respected crypto analyst, presents a more cautious perspective. Cowen suggests that Cardano might enter a \u201cdepression phase,\u201d drawing parallels between ADA\u2019s potential trajectory and historical market patterns.\n\nHe points to the possibility of a deeper correction, with Cardano\u2019s price potentially plummeting further. Cowen\u2019s analysis harkens back to the bearish trends observed in the Nasdaq during 2002-2003, highlighting the potential for ADA\u2019s price to decline significantly before finding stabilization.\n\nIs Cardano Worth Buying Now?\n\nAfter analyzing these contrasting viewpoints, you must consider a cautious approach for Cardano. Hoskinson\u2019s vision for Cardano as a transformative force in the cryptocurrency world is compelling. However, the crypto market is inherently volatile, and Cowen\u2019s warnings about a potential \u201cdepression phase\u201d cannot be denied, especially in this extended bearish phase.\n\nInvestors must consider multiple factors before making a decision. Cardano\u2019s current market position, technological developments, adoption rate, and potential competitors all play a role in determining its future trajectory. While ADA\u2019s current price might seem attractive, given Hoskinson\u2019s aspirations, you can also consider ADA for long-term investment."

        "content": "Over the previous week, the world of cryptocurrency experienced minimal volatility. The entire week encountered a decline marked by a less favorable performance of Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Ethereum was traded within a relatively narrow range, showing a modest rebound from the crash observed in the week before.\n\nIn addition to the major cryptocurrencies, alternative coins (Altcoins) encountered a notable decrease over the recent week. Nonetheless, as the week drew to a close, they managed to recuperate a portion of the losses. Despite this recovery, a considerable portion of coins continued to display unfavorable trends on both the weekly and daily charts.\n\nLast week, a notable market crash was caused by a report that Elon Musk had reportedly adjusted the valuation of its bitcoin holdings, resulting in a depreciation of approximately $373 million over the past two years.\n\nTHORChain (RUNE) is at the top of the list of 70 altcoins experiencing a significant loss in value this week, followed by ApeCoin (APE) and Hedera (HBAR), second and third place, respectively.\n\nTHORChain (RUNE) experienced a notable decrease of 14.32% over the course of the past seven days; however, it has been struggling to make a slight recovery, according to the daily chart. As of now, Rune is being traded at $1.42, reflecting a 0.52% decrease within the last 24 hours.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nMeanwhile, ApeCoin (APE) is also experiencing a significant loss but managed to recover some of its value. Over the past week, APE has experienced a significant decrease of approximately 11.64%.\n\nCurrently, APE is trading at $1.39. In the last 24 hours, the token has experienced a 1.78% decrease, while its trading volume has increased by 37.14% in the same time period.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nAdditionally, Hedera (HBAR) has also lost significant value due to its weekly performance, with a notable decrease of about 11.32%. As of now, HBAR is trading at $0.05547, with a decline of 3.68% in the last 24 hours.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nMoreover, some popular coins are experiencing losses in weekly charts, including AVAX at 6.83%, FIL at 5.33%, and SOL, with a decrease of 4.65%, according to the data from CoinMarketcap.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) & Ethereum (ETH) Weekly Review\n\nIn the week that just passed, Bitcoin, the widely recognized digital currency, faced a notable decline as it approached a crucial support point at around $25,400. However, Bitcoin stayed within a limited trading range for the entirety of the week.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nOver the previous week, the analytics firm Santiment tweeted that only 5.8% of Bitcoin is presently held on exchanges. This marks the lowest point for the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization since December 17, 2017. Additionally, a noteworthy number of significant Bitcoin transactions by large holders (whales) at 57.4K per week are persistently observed.\n\n\ud83d\udc4b Just 5.8% of #Bitcoin is currently sitting on exchanges, which is officially the lowest level #crypto's top market cap asset has seen since December 17, 2017. We are also continuing to see reasonable amounts of $BTC whale transactions (57.4K per week). https://t.co/c0vfjFEvvG pic.twitter.com/nNnz2JDJyb \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) August 24, 2023\n\nLikewise, Ethereum, a well-known cryptocurrency, encountered a narrow trading range akin to Bitcoin. According to a tweet from Santiment, Ethereum\u2019s network displayed increased activity in terms of large addresses during its descent below $1,650 despite its exceptionally volatile price circumstances. The count of wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 $ETH has rebounded to 355,000, and there has been a notable surge in transactions involving $100,000 or more.\n\n\ud83d\udc33 #Ethereum's network has picked up in large address activity during this drop below $1,650 and its highly volatile price conditions. The amount of wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 $ETH has risen back up to 355K, and $100K+ transactions have surged. https://t.co/X137U93ZYu pic.twitter.com/J9lyMoeBmf \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) August 24, 2023\n\nMoreover, the santiment revealed that more than 35% of the available supply is currently being held by the top 10 addresses on the Ethereum network. This doesn\u2019t imply an abrupt centralization of the second-ranked cryptocurrency, but it does indicate that smaller traders are succumbing to fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in response to this market dip.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin is currently trading at $25,917.57, with a 0.44% decrease over the past seven days and a 0.50% decrease in the past 24 hours. On the other hand, ETH is being traded at $1,639.81, experiencing a 0.59% decrease in the past 24 hours and 1.98% over the past seven days.\n\nRelated Reading | Shibarium Chronicles: Shiba Inu Co-Founder Shytoshi\u2019s Last Updates Mark the End"

        "content": "In light of the impending major US economic revelations, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) demonstrate varying market behaviors. Here\u2019s a comprehensive insight into their recent trajectories.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Recent Movements\n\nStarting off the week in the vicinity of $25,864, Bitcoin indicates the market\u2019s anticipation of significant economic information. After reaching its weekly peak at $26,166.90 on Sunday, it saw a drop, reaching as low as $25,855.26 during the Monday session.\n\nThe renowned digital currency has shown a stable pattern around this price range over the last ten days. This followed a notable surge earlier in the month when it rose above $30k. Nevertheless, a considerable market dip occurred shortly after, causing Bitcoin to plummet to its lowest in two months.\n\nCurrent trends suggest lateral movements as the 1-day relative strength index (RSI) is 25,86.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Market Behavior\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, remained steady on Monday, showing negligible change from its Sunday lows. The ETH/USD pair experienced a slight rise, registering a daily high of $1,660.72 after Sunday\u2019s low of $1,645.57.\n\nThis recent development has enabled Ethereum to set $1,663.48, especially after a preceding decline beneath this marker. Echoing Bitcoin\u2019s behavior, Ethereum\u2019s 1-day RSI is currently hindered, which is 30,26. This particular threshold appears to be the key obstacle preventing a positive momentum. Should Ethereum overcome this, we can anticipate its value to possibly exceed $1,700 in the near future. Current price of Ethereum is $1,652.01.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nWith significant US economic disclosures on the horizon, including the consumer confidence report and data on gross domestic product and nonfarm payrolls, the cryptocurrency market is manifesting signs of anticipation. As traders and investors closely monitor these developments, the movements of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum will remain under scrutiny."
