        "title": "Detection of Ponzi scheme on Ethereum using machine learning algorithms | Scientific Reports - Nature.com",
        "content": "Bernie Madoff perpetrated the largest Ponzi scam, defrauding thousands of investors of billions of dollars4,18,19. The scam\u2019s foundation of the Ponzi scheme is deceit and lies, and it relies on both to deceive innocent investors by encouraging their conviction that they will receive the anticipated rewards20. The operator of the Ponzi scheme makes use of the Ethereum platform to achieve their goal16,21,22. Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that creates a peer-to-peer network for securely executing and verifying application code known as smart contracts. Smart contracts enable participants to transact with one another without the need for a trusted central authority. Nowadays, the speedy growth of blockchain has brought about increasing users to be attracted to the blockchain ecosystem and many implementations have been carried out in different fields, especially in the crypto-currency investment field. Blockchain technology in recent times has shown robust activeness. However, along with the rise in online business, uncountable fraudulent activities, e.g., money laundering, bribery, Ponzi schemes, and others, have been seen as the main threat to online business security23. Hu et al.24 and Wang et al.25, stated that the high rate of communication on social media has prompted many fraudsters to take advantage and send their fraudulent links on social media in order to scam its users.\n\nA Ponzi scheme is an investment scam that involves the payment of unrealistic returns to its early investors from funds invested by new investors (SEC, 2018)26. It is a fraudulent investment activity where the initiator generates returns for older investors through revenue paid by new investors, rather than from legitimate businesses. Ponzi schemes hurt the economy of any country involved and are unacceptable in many countries including Nigeria. This is because in Ponzi schemes, later participants will lose most of their invested money27. He further emphasized that all Ponzi schemes are making large amounts of money off people who want to participate in blockchain technology but do not understand how it operates.\n\nBartoletti et al.5 described Ponzi schemes as financial frauds under the promise of high profits. They stressed that the Federal Government of Nigeria has made an official release, intimating citizens about its non-readiness to support the use of Ethereum and at the same time warning individuals, corporate bodies, and banks not to get involved in Ethereum transactions in which most of the Ponzi schemes operate on. This warning was because of the devastating effects of the various Ponzi schemes in Nigeria which collapsed towards the end of the year 2016 up to the first quarter of 2017 when many Nigerians lost their wealth. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) warns investors to be careful about investment proposals that promise to pay huge amounts of money in a short period of time, which are not backed up by any documentation or quarterly/annual reports28. They equally advised the general public to be careful not to invest based on what they will gain alone, but also consider the loss that might align with it, and not to trust investment offerings posted on social networking sites and chat rooms. They also recommended that investors seek third-party advice, for example, to contact an independent broker or licensed financial adviser before investing.\n\nResearch has shown that some of the common features of fraudulent schemes are mouth-watering returns and no negative impacts1,29. Findings suggest that increased regulatory supervision with tight requirements for compulsory reporting of their activities will help to identify such schemes30. Obamuyi et al.31, emphasized that after the demise of the Mavrodi Mundal Movement (MMM), which crashed in the year 2016/2017 with a total investment loss of 12 billion nairas on participants. She emphasized bitterly the rising cases of Ponzi schemes that are recently experienced by the citizens such as Racksterli introduced by Michael Chidiebere Oti after the Covid-19 pandemic in the year 2020. The platform offers a monthly profit called Racksterli package to its participants.\n\nMany Nigerians fall victim to this scam because they are looking for such an opportunity to make fast money out of hardship after the economic setbacks experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to her findings, the platform claimed that the invested funds would be used to reinvest in businesses like real estate businesses, forex trading, and cryptocurrency businesses, promising them that the realized funds from such businesses would be used to reward them. But the scheme finally collapsed when there were no more new investors, making old investors lose their invested funds. This is an indication that the initiator did not invest the generated funds in any business as promised. But the question is \u201cWhy is Oti Chidiebere the founder of Rocksterli not persecuted\u201d. Perhaps the Oti Chidiebere case is still under investigation and will soon face criminal justice. Another such case is that of the 86fb Ponzi scheme which collapsed in early May 2022. The platform since May 2022 has been having issues paying its participants, deceiving their participants that the problem is from the flutter wave payment gateway. But all these crises experienced in these Ponzi schemes should be a reminder to people who are investing in such unverified Ponzi schemes that promise high returns to investors is very dangerous. Another question is despite the loss and warnings of these Ponzi schemes, why do people still fall victim? The answer is; that Nigerians have shown that they long for high-risk and high-return investments, despite their mode of operation32. Supporting the above answer, Chiluwa et al.1 stated that it is due to a low amount of low-risk savings promised by the initiator of these schemes to its participants to go against inflation. Oyedeji et al.33 stated that many people fall victim to these Schemes because of the following reasons:\n\n1. They prefer investing their money in any investment that will double their invested money within a short period of time than working for it. 2. Due to the problem of poor education and lack of awareness. 3. In order to save long-term wealth in real terms in the financial system.\n\nAccording to him, these Schemes will continue to scam people because of the inability of the monetary policy to deliver real risk-free-return investments, making the risk-return investments strive deeply in society. There is a need for better investor education and an effective detection model for the Security and Exchange Commission to do a better job of monitoring Ponzi schemes1. In line with the above statements, the SEC introduced the whistleblower bounty program.\n\nThe program promised that any citizen who reports fraud to the SEC can get up to 30 percent of the penalties and funds recovered from the fraudster. Again, the law also establishes a single toll-free number as a consumer hotline to report any fraudulent act, such as a Ponzi scheme. It suggests that hedge funds and private equity advisers should register with the SEC, in other to establish greater supervision34. In fact, the rising rate of Ponzi scheme scams is due to the weak attitude of the regulatory body towards identifying and persecuting their perpetrators35. But there is hope as the Ponzi schemes keep increasing; it enforces the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) to press them down. The SEC has announced its readiness to work with the National Orientation Agency (NOA) and other government agencies to stop the operations of Ponzi schemes and other illegal investment platforms in society (SEC, 2022). Unfortunately, just like other crimes such as terrorism and security challenges36, the Ponzi scheme is a rapidly growing crime in society.\n\nMore work achieved on Ponzi scheme detection includes the recent work by Zhang et al.37 utilized machine learning techniques to address the issue of model stealing attacks on a network. Liu et al.38 introduce a unique video self-supervised learning framework called Temporal Contrastive Graph Learning (TCGL), which uses a hybrid graph contrastive learning technique to model both the inter- and intra-snippet temporal dependencies for learning temporal representations. Liu team\u2019s experimental findings show that TCGL outperforms cutting-edge techniques on large-scale action recognition and video retrieval benchmarks in a network. Zhang and Zhou proposed in 2022 that feature pyramid networks (FPN), an essential component of general-purpose object detectors, can greatly improve detection performance for objects of various scales. Bayesian learning is used by Xie et al.39, and Cheng et al.40 in a separate work to permit the evaluation of uncertainty with regard to the made predictions. Due to their exceptional ability to marginalize uncertainty associated with the parameter estimates, they can more effectively utilize relevant prior information and organically add robustness to the model. Furthermore, the training data can be used to learn the hyper-parameters related to the adopted priors.\n\nA dynamic event-triggered security control issue for networked control systems vulnerable to deception attacks was also the subject of certain investigations. To reflect randomly occurring cyber-attacks, Li et al.\u2019s new work41 uses two sets of separate stochastic sequences. The paper by Li et al.42, looked at the H consensus issue for multiagent supply chain systems with changeable topology and ambiguous demand. Zhu et al.43, offer a simple and effective Siamese-oriented Region Proposal Network (Siamese-ORPN) for visual tracking in their paper. The diversity of visual-semantic hierarchies can yield significant benefits in feature extraction and feature fusion. Personal gadgets, which are backed by a variety of smartphone apps, allow consumers to access Internet services in a convenient and ubiquitous manner, according to Li et al.41. The survey summarizes modern technology as well as critical patterns in smartphone app usage behaviors, all of which have major implications for every relevant stakeholder. Li and Sun44 investigated the subject of stock intelligent investment strategies based on the support vector machine parameter optimization technique.\n\nIn the stock market forecast, the evolutionary algorithm parameter optimization under the radial basis kernel function exhibits the best prediction effect, which is the closest to the true value. Cao et al.45 investigated the topic of stock intelligent investing strategy based on the support vector machine parameter optimization technique. The experimental findings suggest that the new method can effectively optimize four model indicators. Yan et al.46 present a new technique to enable the realization of the effect of social co-governance based on the innovative properties of the blockchain such as non-tampering, consensus mechanism, and a smart contract. The consensus outcomes created by credible data uploading, model development, and data derivation via smart contracts can considerably reduce the problem of government administrative oversight involution; and the potential for social co-governance. Blockchain smart contracts have given rise to a slew of intriguing and appealing applications, and they have emerged as a transformative force for the Internet. To ensure network vulnerabilities are detected, the research by Liu et al.47 focuses on Rethinking Smart Contract Fuzzing: Fuzzing with Invocation Ordering and Important Branch Revisiting. In addition to applying blockchain technology to the health care service system, the paper by Li et al.48 concentrates on network vulnerability detection via Efficient Medical Big Data Management with Keyword-Searchable Encryption in the Health chain.\n\nSimilarly, Wang et al.49 focus on Blockchain-Empowered Distributed Multi-Camera Multi-Target Tracking in Edge Computing to ensure the detection of network vulnerabilities. Due to the intricacy and high dynamics of cloud environments, it is difficult to detect anomalies caused by irregular data fluctuations and to create robust models. To address these concerns, Song et al.50, published a paper to identify performance deviations in volatile cloud environments: A robust, explainable, correlative graph neural network-based method for detecting network vulnerabilities. Likewise, a paper by Zenggang et al.51 employs the Social Similarity Routing Algorithm based on Socially Aware Networks in the Big Data Environment to detect network vulnerabilities. Moreover, Han et al.52 use Practical and Robust Federated Learning With Highly Scalable Regression Training to detect network vulnerabilities.\n\nIn addition, Ni et al.53 examined the community partition issue under the IC model in social networks. The goal is to maximize the total influence propagation of a social network by optimizing it within each community in order to detect network vulnerabilities. Li and Liu\u2019s54 focus was on Scheduling uniform machines with restricted assignments in order to detect network vulnerabilities. Again, Li55, proposed efficient algorithms for scheduling tasks of equal length with processing set restrictions on uniform parallel batch machines. Then, Li study\u2019s results extend previous findings for identical machinery. The work of Liu et al.56, introduces Visual Question Answering (VQA), which is an important cross-disciplinary issue in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. It needs a computer to give a natural language answer based on pictures and questions asked about the pictures. So, the study looks at problems related to scams that have to do with network breaches. Current work by Siyu57 investigates how to improve the blending attention mechanism in visual question answering. Therefore, the study addresses network breaches and scam difficulties.\n\nPonzi scheme detection involves the collection of advertisements claiming high returns to participants on social media platforms and capturing their Ethereum addresses for analysis of their transactions for later identification58. Detecting Ponzi schemes on Ethereum is an urgent task, and a big challenge22,59. Previously, many works have been conducted on Ponzi scheme detection60,61. Some of the developed models have a problem with over-fitting, data imbalance, and prediction shift. The paper by Abiodun et al.9 employed feature selection optimization methods for optimal text classification to handle the problem of overfitting. This paper developed a detection model for Ponzi schemes using machine learning algorithms and feature engineering. Feature engineering was used to manipulate the data set in other to solve the problem of an imbalanced dataset, thereby improving the model\u2019s training for better performance and greater accuracy. It uses a large dataset for the models\u2019 training in order to handle prediction shift problems caused by target leakage. This model when deployed will be able to detect Ponzi schemes on time, therefore reducing investors\u2019 risks in Nigeria."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Options Worth $4.5 Billion Set To Expire Today\n\nThe crypto options market is facing a major event today that could lead to increased volatility and shifting prices for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAccording to data from Deribit, over $4.5 billion worth of options contracts in Bitcoin and Ethereum are set to expire at 8:00 UTC on Friday, October 27.\n\nOptions give buyers the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific expiration date. As these options reach their expiration date, holders will have to decide whether to exercise their contracts or let them expire worthless.\n\nThis could lead to a spike in trading volume and volatility around the expiration time as market participants react to whether large options positions are exercised or not. CoinDesk reported the current open interest in contract terms has increased to $20.64, significantly higher than in November 2021 when BTC was around $66,000.\n\nThe impending options expiration comes after a period of positive price movement for top cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin rose from around $26,000 to over $34,000 in recent weeks. This market activity led to increased options trading.\n\nTraders and investors will be closely watching the impact of this historic options expiration as it unfolds today. The $4.5 billion in contracts set to expire represents the scale of the crypto options market today, and how it can drive price action and volatility in underlying assets."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nTotal value locked in DeFis, a crucial metric for programmable blockchains, is rallying in the segment of Ethereum-based second-layer solutions. Despite general market apathy, the net TVL of 30 leading platforms added 32% in the last four months.\n\nEthereum L2s set new all-time high in TVL\n\nYesterday, Oct. 27, 2023, the aggregated value of cryptocurrency locked in all Layer-2 platforms on Ethereum (ETH) reached a new all-time high. It briefly touched $12 billion, but then stabilized near $11.87 billion. The previous historic high was registered on April 17, at $11.85 billion.\n\nImage by L2Beat\n\nIn the last hours, it slightly retraced to $11.81 billion. As such, in USD-denominated value, it added over 114% in the last 12 months despite the pale performance of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nIn terms of Ether-denominated value, the record was registered on Oct. 11, 2023. The ecosystem reached 6.72 million Ether (ETH) locked, while it barely surpassed 3.5 million Ether (ETH) a year ago.\n\nIn the last seven days, the ecosystem of L2s added 10.36% of dollar-denominated TVL. An array of the largest L2s \u2014 Arbitrum, OP Mainnet (formerly Optimism), Starknet, ImmutableX and Loopring \u2014 posted even more impressive gains.\n\nEthereum (ETH), the most crucial asset for L2s, is up by 10.14% in the corresponding period. It revisited a multi-month low over $1,836 two days ago.\n\nArbitrum, OP Mainnet remain undisputed, rivalry rages for #3\n\nMeanwhile, the sphere of L2s on Ethereum (ETH) remains highly \"whale-dominated.\" The two largest networks \u2014 Arbitrum and OP Mainnet \u2014 are responsible for over 90% of TVL in the ecosystem.\n\nBase, the fastest-growing L2, is protecting the third position with 4.83%. It is followed by zkSync Era and dYdX with 3.8% and 3%, respectively.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, dYdX made the most anticipated announcement this week: It is migrating from the L2 model to being a standalone Tendermint-based Layer 1."

        "title": "How an Ether Futures ETF Works - Investopedia",
        "content": "Financial products like ether futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) allow you to gain exposure to ether in a regulated market setting. Ether is the cryptocurrency that fuels the Ethereum network, a decentralized platform that has enabled the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications. ETH\u2019s 2015 launch helped the development of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nKey Takeaways Ether futures ETFs offer broad access for investing in ether cryptocurrency through a regulated fund structure.\n\nEther futures ETFs permit speculative trading or hedging on ether\u2019s price volatility without owning ether directly.\n\nSince ether futures ETFs track ether futures contracts, they do not always correlate to ether\u2019s spot prices.\n\nEther futures ETFs must contend with risks typical for cryptocurrency: volatility, derivative complexity, and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nThese products best suit strategic traders within sophisticated portfolios\u2019 higher risk allocations.\n\nEther futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) differ from hypothetical spot ether ETFs (they are thus far prohibited) in a key way: They track ether derivatives rather than directly holding the currency. While convenient for mainstream investors, this adds a layer between the investor and the underlying asset. It also means contending with the nuances of futures contracts and their associated costs.\n\nEther and the Ethereum Network\n\nEther is the name used for both the Ethereum blockchain and its cryptocurrency, which underlies the Ethereum ecosystem. It is used to pay for transaction fees and computational services on the Ethereum network. Owners of ether can also take a stake to help secure the blockchain in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model. This method validates entries in a distributed database while keeping the data secure.\n\nEthereum launched in 2015 and helped pioneer smart contracts, the self-executing code that runs on the blockchain. This produced new ways to engage in decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized apps (dApps), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized autonomous organizations.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain has the second highest market capitalization after Bitcoin. However, Ethereum is programmable, unlike Bitcoin, so developers can build and deploy various dApps on top of the blockchain.\n\nEther\u2019s price has had major volatility, but it has grown tremendously amid the increased adoption of DeFi and NFTs. The successful transition of Ethereum to a PoS system has been a key milestone for widening the network\u2019s reach.\n\nOverall, Ethereum has been aiming higher than just providing a means for peer-to-peer payments. It has been a central network trying to build a decentralized global computing infrastructure that expands the uses for blockchain and cryptocurrency technology.\n\nFutures and Futures-Based ETFs\n\nFutures contracts are financial derivatives that allow investors to speculate on the prospective price moves of certain assets. They are legal agreements to buy or sell the asset at a predetermined price on a specified future date. Thus, they enable you to hedge risks or bet on the direction you believe an asset\u2019s price will move without owning it. They are commonly used for commodities like gold, oil, and now cryptocurrencies.\n\nSuppose you enter a three-month ether futures contract to buy ether at $1,500. This locks in the price you will pay in three months, no matter ether\u2019s market price at that time. If ether trades above $1,500 in three months, then you profit by getting ether below market price. If it\u2019s below $1,500, then you lose more money than if you just bought ether on the spot market.\n\nStandard futures contracts have set expiration cycles, requiring investors to roll over their positions into new contracts. For futures, ETFs track their contract prices by spread-out exposure across various expiration dates. This provides continuous investment exposure without manually rolling over positions yourself. This also means that these ETFs hold futures contracts and do not directly hold the underlying assets they track.\n\nFutures ETFs allow ordinary investors to gain exposure to futures prices by tracking volatile assets like commodities, currencies, and cryptocurrencies in a regulated fund format. Ether futures ETFs, in particular, track the futures prices of ether without you needing to trade futures or own ether directly.\n\nFutures Market and the Contango Effect\n\nThe contango effect in futures markets can negatively affect the long-term returns of futures-based ETFs like those tracking ether futures. Here\u2019s a brief explanation of it:\n\nContango refers to a normal market condition where the futures price for an asset rises as the contract\u2019s expiration date moves further out. For example, one-month ether futures may trade at $1,500, while three-month ether futures trade at $1,600.\n\nWhen ether futures ETFs roll over their contracts as they near expiration, they have to sell the lower-priced short-term contracts and buy the more expensive long-term ones. This constant roll yield erodes the ETF\u2019s returns over time.\n\nThis effect can grow over time, causing futures-based ETF returns to lag behind the spot prices they aim to track. Contango is a major criticism of futures-based commodity ETFs and applies to ether and Bitcoin futures ETFs as well.\n\nSkilled fund managers can try to minimize losses by optimizing roll timing, but contango\u2019s effects are hard to mitigate completely. It highlights the tradeoffs of obtaining convenience through futures-based cryptocurrency ETF products.\n\nHow Ether Futures ETFs Work\n\nEther futures ETFs hold a portfolio of ether futures contracts traded on exchanges rather than directly owning ether tokens. Authorized participants (APs), typically large broker-dealers, create shares of the ETF to be listed on a stock exchange. They purchase a basket of ether futures proportional to the ETF\u2019s desired holdings and contribute them to the fund in exchange for new ETF shares.\n\nThe process can work in reverse, with the ETF redeeming shares from APs in exchange for a basket of underlying futures contracts. This creation/redemption mechanism helps maintain arbitrage, minimizing the difference between the ETF\u2019s share price and net asset value.\n\nFor example, if ether futures rally, then the ETF share price on the secondary market will also rise. An AP could then acquire new ETF shares from the fund at net asset value in exchange for the appropriate basket of ether futures. The participant can then sell the newly obtained ETF shares on the exchange at a higher market price for a profit.\n\nMarket makers also are important in providing liquidity for the ETF shares. They stand ready to buy and sell ETF shares continuously to minimize large spreads between the bid and ask prices. This allows investors trading the ETF to enter and exit positions quickly.\n\nUsing APs and market makers, ether futures ETFs can offer traders convenient exposure to ether\u2019s futures price dynamics through a fund that trades like stocks.\n\nEther futures in the United States trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Each futures contract represents 50 units of the currency.\n\nExample of Ether Futures ETF\n\nSuppose an ether futures ETF is launched called the Ethereum Futures Fund (ETHF). The fund sponsor partners with an AP, a large broker-dealer. The AP sources ether futures contracts from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to deposit into the fund as its initial holdings. In return for contributing $10 million worth of ether futures, the AP receives 100,000 shares of ETHF at $100 per share from the fund sponsor to be listed on a stock exchange.\n\nInvestors can then buy and sell shares of ETHF on the stock exchange through their brokers. The price will fluctuate depending on the market price of ether futures. If ETHF shares are trading on the exchange at $105, then an arbitrage opportunity exists for the AP. The AP can purchase new ETHF shares from the fund at $100 net asset value and immediately sell them on the open market for $105, pocketing the spread of $5 per share. This helps keep the ETF share price in line with its holdings. If needed, the AP can also redeem ETHF shares from the fund in exchange for a basket of ether futures.\n\nThe ETHF fund managers repeatedly trade new futures contracts close to expiration, using capital from the ETF\u2019s assets to maintain exposure across the futures curve. This keeps the ETF fully invested in ether futures.\n\nRisks and Benefits of Investing in Ether Futures ETFs\n\nThe case favoring investing in ether futures ETFs largely rests on their accessibility and diversification potential. By providing exposure to ether and the broader cryptocurrency space within a regulated fund structure, ether futures ETFs allow a wider range of investors to participate.\n\nThe familiar ETF wrapper makes adding a slice of the emerging crypto asset class simple enough through regular brokerage accounts. This can offer more diversification for a portfolio and the potential for risk-adjusted returns. Active traders also gain liquidity for acting on ether futures price moves that direct futures contracts may lack. Under the right conditions, these benefits make ether futures ETFs appealing.\n\nHowever, the volatility and regulatory uncertainty for ether futures ETFs are sizable risks. Ether\u2019s frequent and extreme price swings translate into highly volatile ETF values, suitable only for investors with a high risk tolerance.\n\nThere is also an unsettled regulatory environment for cryptocurrency ETFs in general that could shift and reduce the value of these products. Additionally, threats like hacking, theft, and manipulation loom over any fund interfacing with the crypto ecosystem.\n\nWeighing the pros and cons carefully is imperative, given the risky and complex nature of ether futures ETF investing. For most, minimal exposure combined with ample due diligence is advisable.\n\nEther Futures ETF Pros & Cons Pros Easy and accessible way to gain ether exposure\n\nMore regulated than direct ownership\n\nETF structure may be more liquid than the underlying asset\n\nNo need to understand the finer points of cryptocurrency Cons ETH remains highly volatile.\n\nDifferences between the ETF\u2019s share price and its underlying net asset value can emerge.\n\nThe contango of the futures curve can erode long-term returns for futures-based ETFs as they roll over contracts.\n\nUnclear regulatory framework\n\nPotential cybersecurity risks\n\nWhy to Invest in an Ether ETF\n\nCompared with Bitcoin ETFs, ether ETFs have more direct exposure to the Ethereum ecosystem and, more broadly, the growth of decentralized finance, rather than just cryptocurrency prices. However, Bitcoin still represents the majority of the crypto market\u2019s capitalization.\n\nFor those who want ETH exposure, investing in an ether futures ETF offers professional management and a certain degree of diversification, which is particularly appealing for individuals who lack the technical know-how or the time to manage crypto investments. Unlike directly holding ether, where investors need to manage their digital wallets and safeguard their private keys, an ether futures ETF is managed by financial professionals who navigate the complex world of cryptocurrency on behalf of the investors. Additionally, ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, offering a more familiar interface to traditional investors than occasionally shady crypto exchanges.\n\nMoreover, compared with direct ETH futures contracts, an ether futures ETF provides a less complex exposure. Futures contracts require a good understanding of derivative markets, not to mention a readiness to meet margin calls during volatile market conditions. Meanwhile, an ether futures ETF brings the futures contracts within a fund structure, mitigating the need for investors to interact directly with the futures market. This reduces the complexity and potential costs tied to managing margin requirements.\n\nIn addition, an ether futures ETF provides a degree of diversification since it can hold futures contracts with various expiration dates or other related assets, spreading the risk. Diversification is particularly beneficial in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market.\n\nFinally, regulatory oversight for ETFs provides an additional layer of security and transparency that direct ether holdings or ETH futures contracts might not have. This regulatory framework can provide investors with a sense of confidence and legitimacy in their ether exposure."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Surged Higher This Week - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What a week it was for mega-cap cryptocurrencies. Three of the most popular digital assets out there, Bitcoin (BTC 7.29%), Ethereum (ETH 4.41%) and Dogecoin (DOGE 24.05%), each saw impressive gains. As of 12:45 p.m. ET on Friday, these three top-10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization rose 14.7%, 10.4% and 15.4%, respectively, over the past seven days.\n\nIt shouldn't be surprising for many investors to see Bitcoin lead the market higher, as that's par for the course for this space. With roughly half the market cap of the entire crypto sector, the direction Bitcoin moves on a given week typically determines how other digital assets perform.\n\nAccordingly, one might view this week's news that a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) could be hitting the market sooner than thought as the rising tide that's lifting all boats. I certainly think there's something to that.\n\nWith that said, let's dive into what specifically drove these three cryptos higher over the past week and where they may be headed from here.\n\nBitcoin ETF launch dominates the crypto news cycle\n\nIt's been a busy week in the world of crypto, with the Sam Bankman-Fried trial ongoing, various macro-data releases impacting monetary policy decisions released, and a flurry of token-specific news that's been enough to make the heads of many investors in the market spin. Of course, this week's Bitcoin news has dominated the headlines, and for good reason.\n\nEssentially, a number of hints that Blackrock's spot Bitcoin ETF will finally be pushed over the goal line have materialized this week, with this ETF reportedly being listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation database under the ticker IBTC.\n\nThis ticker appears to have been taken down and put back up again, but the fact that we're seeing this ticker listed is apparently enough of a catalyst for crypto bulls to point to. Many believe this could be the moment Bitcoin is officially viewed as 'open for investment' for institutional investors, much in the same way gold ETFs made investing in precious metals much simpler and more attractive for money managers.\n\nOn that note, I've been reading a number of interesting analyses on this topic, with many experts attempting to quantify what a spot Bitcoin ETF could mean for the digital currency in terms of capital inflows into Bitcoin and the broader sector as a whole. Right now, I think most of these reports require a great deal of guesswork, so I'm not sure how much credence to give these. However, I do think it's true that Bitcoin and Ethereum (assuming a spot Ethereum ETF is next, which would be 100% logical) will receive a big boost from a rush of capital into these alternative assets.\n\nOther, more speculative altcoins, such as Dogecoin, may be well positioned to ride a wave of momentum higher. Dogecoin's price action typically takes its cue from the directional forces created by Bitcoin and Ethereum in a given week.\n\nIndeed, the fact that Dogecoin has moved even higher than Bitcoin and Ethereum on broadly bullish market sentiment outlines the value this token provides traders as a higher-beta option in this space. A number of experts continue to point to \"irrational exuberance\" when discussing Dogecoin's price action over the past few days as the key driver of this token. I tend to agree.\n\nWhere are these three tokens headed from here?\n\nIt's clear that there's robust reason for Bitcoin and Ethereum to be up this week. As for the rest of the market, animal spirits appear to remain high, which is a great thing for crypto speculators banking on yet another catalyst-driven bull run over the near term.\n\nThat said, the extent to which this rally can be sustained beyond a few days remains to be seen. Once a spot Bitcoin ETF is launched (and maybe a similar Ethereum option), it's unclear whether the bullish momentum that's driven valuations higher can continue. Indeed, it could be the latest \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" event. We'll see.\n\nIt's my view that now may be a good time to take a cautious view of this space and wait for the dust to settle before stepping in. These three tokens have made nice moves over the past week, for sure. Let's just see whether these gains will be held before jumping in to ride this latest leg higher."

        "title": "Fireblocks, UniPass Wallet tackle Ethereum ERC-4337 account abstraction vulnerability - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency infrastructure firm Fireblocks has identified and assisted in tackling what it describes as the first account abstraction vulnerability within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAn announcement on Oct. 26 unpacked the discovery of an ERC-4337 account abstraction vulnerability in the smart contract wallet UniPass. The two firms worked together to address the vulnerability, which was reportedly found in hundreds of mainnet wallets during a white hat hacking operation.\n\nAccording to Fireblocks, the vulnerability would allow a potential attacker to carry out a full account takeover of the UniPass Wallet by manipulating Ethereum\u2019s account abstraction process.\n\nAs per Ethereum\u2019s developer documentation on ERC-4337, account abstraction allows for a shift in the way transactions and smart contracts are processed by the blockchain to provide flexibility and efficiency.\n\nRelated: Account abstraction will drive a billion users from Asia to Web3: Consensys exec\n\nConventional Ethereum transactions involve two types of accounts: externally owned accounts (EOAs) and contract accounts. EOAs are controlled by private keys and can initiate transactions, while contract accounts are controlled by the code of a smart contract. When an EOA sends a transaction to a contract account, it triggers the execution of the contract\u2019s code.\n\nAccount abstraction introduces the idea of a meta-transaction or more generalized abstracted accounts. Abstracted accounts are not tied to a specific private key and are able to initiate transactions and interact with smart contracts, just like an EOA.\n\nAs Fireblocks explains, when an ERC-4337-compliant account executes an action, it relies on the Entrypoint contract to ensure that only signed transactions get executed. These accounts typically trust an audited single EntryPoint contract to ensure that it receives permission from the account before executing a command:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that a malicious or buggy entrypoint could, in theory, skip the call to \u201cvalidateUserOp\u201d and just call the execution function directly, as the only restriction it has is that it\u2019s called from the trusted EntryPoint.\u201d\n\nAccording to Fireblocks, the vulnerability allowed an attacker to gain control of UniPass wallets by replacing the trusted EntryPoint of the wallet. Once the account takeover was complete, an attacker would be able to access the wallet and drain its funds.\n\nSeveral hundred users who had the ERC-4337 module activated in their wallets were vulnerable to the attack, which could be performed by any actor on the blockchain. The wallets in question only held small amounts of funds, and the issue has been mitigated at an early stage.\n\nHaving ascertained that the vulnerability could be exploited, Fireblocks\u2019 research team managed to carry out a white hat operation to patch the existing vulnerabilities. This involved actually exploiting the vulnerability:\n\n\u201cWe shared this idea with the UniPass team, who took it upon themselves to implement and run the whitehat operation.\u201d\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin previously outlined challenges in expediting the proliferation of account abstraction functionality, which includes the need for an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) to upgrade EOAs into smart contracts and ensure the protocol works on layer-2 solutions.\n\nMagazine: Ethereum restaking: Blockchain innovation or dangerous house of cards?"

        "title": "Solana Vs Ethereum: A Deep-Dive Analysis of Two Popular Coins - CoinGape",
        "content": "In the crypto world, Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) are two of the most popular crypto coins that have found use cases across the board. While both projects share many similarities, there are still major differences between them. Understanding the key differences between SOL and ETH can help investors and traders make informed decisions to maximize their investments. But what factors should one take into consideration when doing a Solana vs Ethereum analysis? Here, we deep dive into the key aspects that differentiate SOL from ETH and vice versa.\n\nAbout Solana\n\nSolana, or SOL, was created by software developer Anatoly Yakovenko, who first proposed the project in 2017 and finally launched it in 2020. The coin takes inspiration from Etherum and was eventually created to improve upon Etherum. Many crypto enthusiasts and experts considered Solana a potential \u2018Ethereum killer.\u2019\n\nSolana emerged as a new-generation crypto coin that addressed several shortcomings of popular tokens launched before it. The coin\u2019s transactions are conducted on the Solana blockchain, which uses a proof-of-history consensus mechanism instead of a proof-of-work mechanism used by popular initial coins like Bitcoin.\n\nIn layman\u2019s terms, the proof-of-work mechanism depends on miners to unearth the next block and is slow and has a high energy demand. In comparison, the proof-of-history consensus mechanism is fast and requires 99.9% less energy. This is one of the main reasons why Solana took on the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum right from the beginning.\n\nAbout Ethereum\n\nEthereum, or ETH, which was first proposed by Vitalik Buterin in his white paper in 2013, was finally launched in 2015. Buterin was joined by Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Amir Chetrit, Anthony Di Iorio, Jeffrey Wilcke, Joseph Lubin, and Mihai Alisie, who further developed and popularised the project its way to the second-largest blockchain project in the world, only behind Bitcoin.\n\nETH is the native currency of Ethereum, a decentralized blockchain that offers smart contract functionality. However, the project was also plagued with issues related to proof-of-work until September 2022, when it shifted to a proof-of-stake mechanism. The move helped it become more fast and reduced its energy needs by over 99%, making it more efficient.\n\nSolana Vs. Ethereum : An Overview\n\nSolana and Ethereum are two of the most widely used crypto tokens globally. But to better understand how these two crypto coins are pitting against each other, we have taken several factors into consideration to provide you with a detailed snapshot.\n\nGoogle Trends: Solana Vs Ethereum\n\nGoogle Trends is one of the key metrics to determine the interest of crypto enthusiasts in particular coins. For the past 12 months in 2023, Ethereum clearly has the edge over Solana in terms of search volumes and interest of the global crypto community.\n\nCaption: Interest over time of Solana and Ethereum {Solana (Blue); Ethereum (Red)}\n\nActive Addresses: Solana Vs. Ethereum\n\nActive Addresses is another important metric that can give you an insight into the adoption of a coin. In simple terms, an active address is a crypto address that has become a direct participant in a successful transaction. It can be either the sender\u2019s or receiver\u2019s address.\n\nActive Addresses Solana\n\nSolana\u2019s active addresses, which peaked at around 39.64 million in April 2022, are nowhere close to its days of glory. However, the token has witnessed a decent rise in active addresses in the last 30 days. In October 2023, active addresses on Solana stood at 5.33 million as of 28 October.\n\nActive Addresses Ethereum\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Ethereum is a more popular crypto coin than Solana. Therefore, naturally, the former has a more stable number of active addresses than the latter. In October, Ethereum\u2019s number of active addresses was 10.35 million as of 28 October.\n\nMonthly Transactions (Solana & Ethereum)\n\nMonthly transactions in crypto refer to the buying, selling, and exchanging of digital currencies within a given month. Comparing Ethereum and Solana\u2019s monthly transactions will help you understand which coin is being preferred for transactions by crypto enthusiasts.\n\nSolana Monthly Transactions\n\nNon-vote Solana transactions peaked in November 2021 at 1.5 billion. The last time it was near the 1 billion mark was in July 2022. The number of non-vote transactions has kept fluctuating since then. In October, the number of non-vote transactions showed improvement. As of 28 October, the number of non-vote transactions was up at 550.4 million from 494.7 million in September and 519.83 million in August 2023.\n\nEthereum Monthly Transactions\n\nIn terms of monthly transactions, Ethereum made a record in May 2021, when the token was involved in 20.27 transactions. While ETH\u2019s number of transactions has fallen since then, it has remained stable in the range of 12 million to 17 million. However, in October, the number of Ethereum-based transactions could see a serious fall as it stands at 10.35 million as of 28 October.\n\nAlso Read : Shiba Inu Vs Dogecoin : A Deep Dive Into The Ecosystem\n\nPrice Chart: Solana Vs Ethereum\n\nAnalyzing and comparing Solana and Ethereum price charts can provide key insights that can help in making informed decisions. CoinGape price comparison chart above demonstrates price trend and market performances of both Solana and Ethereum. While Ethereum price is up by over 85%, Solana price is surging significantly by more than 450% as of December 2023 in the last 12 months.\n\nMarket Cap & Trading Volume: Solana Vs Ethereum\n\nThe market cap of cryptocurrencies gives an indication of the coin\u2019s value and size. Ethereum, being the more popular crypto coin, clearly has a higher market cap of over $284 billion while Solana has a market cap of $32billion. On the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s circulating supply at present stands at 120.2 million and that of Solana\u2019s is at 425.9 million.\n\nComing to the trading volume of both the cryptocurrencies, Ethereum\u2019s trading volume stands at over $12 billion with a decrease of 23% in the last 24 hours as of December 9, 2023. And, Solana\u2019s trading volume is more than $3 billion and is down by 21% in the last 24 hours.\n\nConclusion : Which coin is more popular ?\n\nEthereum and Solana are two of the most popular cryptocurrencies in today\u2019s time. Both the coins have found several use cases, and are witnessing an increased adoption in multiple areas. At present, with a larger market cap and higher active addresses, it\u2019s clear that Ethereum is finding more traction among crypto users. However, Solana, which faced a massive setback after its links with FTX were found, is gaining the lost ground, and could soon again give a tough competition to Ethereum. In all likelihood, it\u2019s going to be more interesting from here. Stay tuned!"

        "content": "Ethereum client developers said they were not comfortable with a full client fork citing consensus issues on devnets that had not gone well.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade on Ethereum estimated to take place next month will likely not go ahead as planned, with the majority of developers raising concerns about executing the hard fork at this stage.\n\nIn the All Core Developers call on Thursday, consensus layer client teams said they did not feel comfortable forking the Goerli on the mainnet because of the varying levels of work still required. This included deeper changes to the codebase from the Ethereum client Prysm, which runs 45% of consensus layer clients.\n\nLast month, Ethereum\u2019s Holesky testnet experienced an error during a launch attempt \u2013 an issue that developers attributed to a mismatch in fork parameters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely not comfortable at all having a full client fork on Goerli,\u201d said Prysm developer Potuz.\n\n\u201cI see very large and deep changes still being pushed in the branch,\u201d Potuz added.\n\nMeanwhile, execution layer clients are ready to move forward with the fork, especially considering Dencun will be the last fork, with one developer on the execution side saying, \u201cwe are in a pretty good place, a lot of things are also on Master now.\u201d\n\nAccording to Tim Beiko, the developer who runs the core protocol meetings for Ethereum, the hard fork would most likely take place in the latter half of November, as opposed to the first week, although no date has been agreed to at this time.\n\nThis means that Goerli would more likely happen in the latter half of November, although no date was agreed to. EL clients felt it would be best to let CL teams set the date given they have more work to do, and so we'll continue that conversation on ACDC next week. \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) October 26, 2023\n\nThe Dencun upgrade would introduce the much anticipated Proto-danksharding feature to the Ethereum blockchain with EIP-4844. The feature will increase throughput for Layer 2 networks by introducing \u201cblob-carrying transactions\u201d for more data storage."

Indeed, the former has noted an impressive surge in price. Specifically due to the hype surrounding the potential arrival of a Spot Bitcoin ETF in the coming months.\n\nConversely, both assets slipped lower today, with Bitcoin falling below the $34,000 mark and Ethereum falling below $1,800. Still, today, both BTC and ETH options contracts worth billions expire, which may lead to a volatile response from the market overall.\n\nJUST IN: $4,550,000,000 worth of #Bitcoin & Ethereum options expire today. October 27, 2023\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Reaches All-Time High Against the Argentine Peso, Naira, and Lira\n\n$4.5B Worth of BTC and ETH Options Contracts to Expire Today\n\nThe year thus far has certainly been up and down for the digital asset sector. Still, the prevalence of Bitcoin has seemingly increased over the past few months, culminating in a rally that saw the asset surpass $35,000 amid ETF approval hype. Now, an important date regarding both BTC and ETH is fast approaching.\n\nSpecifically, more than $4.5 billion worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum options contracts are set to expire today. Indeed, the expiring contract arrives amid a boom in the options contract market for both assets. CoinDesk reported that national open interest in active Bitcoin and Ethereum options contracts has increased to $20.64, higher than open interest noted in November 2021 when Bitcoin was trading above $66,000.\n\nSource: The Street\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Whale Moves $55 Million ETH to Binance, Will it Sell?\n\nOptions are contracts that allow the purchaser the chance to either buy or sell an asset at a prespecified price before an expiration date. Subsequently, the billions worth of both digital asset contracts are approaching their expiration date today, at 08:00 UTC.\n\nSubsequently, leading exchange Deribit is set to settle the monthly options contracts for both assets. Conversely, how the price responds to the outcome of the expiration will be important to observe. The ETF\u2019s development will also continue to play a critical role in Bitcoin\u2019s price movement."

        "content": "A widely-followed crypto analyst says the Ethereum (ETH) rival Solana (SOL) is on the verge of another breakout that will outperform ETH and Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nPseudonymous crypto trader Bluntz tells his 225,000 followers on the social media platform X that SOL is one of his main \u201calt picks\u201d and is set to run higher not only in USD terms but also versus BTC (SOL/BTC) and ETH (SOL/ETH).\n\n\u201cSOL still one of my favorite alt picks right now.\n\nStructure on the USD pair looks very much impulsive and like an extended wave three underway and its BTC and ETH pair also still look like they are on the cusp of high timeframe accumulation breakouts.\u201d\n\nBluntz utilizes the Elliot Wave Theory in his technical analysis. The theory aims to predict price impulses based on crowd psychology, which tends to manifest in waves. Based on his chart, the analyst suggests that SOL is in the midst of a five-wave impulse to the upside that could top out near the $47 range before making its next move.\n\nWhen asked why he\u2019s so zeroed in on Solana, Bluntz says he\u2019s confident that SOL will outperform BTC and ETH in the near future.\n\nLooking at Bitcoin, the trader says that BTC\u2019s price action strongly suggests that more upside action is imminent and that a dip to $32,000 is unlikely at this point. He forecasts that BTC will make another impulse upward after consolidating within a bullish triangle pattern.\n\n\u201cThe fact that BTC is showing acceptance at these levels after that strong breakout of $32,000 is quite bullish in my opinion.\n\nI don\u2019t think we retest $32,000 at all, too many people missed the move and want that retest and I don\u2019t think the market will give it to them.\n\nI anticipate this to probably end up as a triangle and break higher.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $33,957.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Discover SCENE\n\nIf you\u2019ve been following Ethereum for the last three years, you\u2019ve also likely heard of Lido Finance.\n\nThe massive liquid staking protocol, which launched shortly after Ethereum began its transition to a proof-of-stake blockchain, now commands the lion\u2019s share of the staking market.\n\nPer an oft-cited Dune dashboard from Hildobby, there are more than 27.8 million\u2013or nearly $50 billion\u2013Ethereum staked total across various cryptocurrency exchanges, individual validators, and decentralized protocols like Lido.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOf that sum, more than 31% is staked with Lido Finance, making it far and away the most popular staking solution on the market.\n\nSource: Hildobby , October 2023.\n\nBut what is liquid staking, Lido Finance, and how does it all work?\n\nKeep reading to find out.\n\nWhat is Lido Finance?\n\nLido Finance goes hand in hand with Ethereum\u2019s full transition to proof-of-stake.\n\nOne of Lido DAO\u2019s business development contributors Marin Tvrdi\u0107 told Decrypt at ETH CC Paris that when Lido launched, it had a perfect market fit.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen Ethereum finally launched its so-called Beacon Chain in December 2020, effectively creating a parallel proof-of-stake network to the proof-of-work version, it also launched the staking feature.\n\nUsers with with 32 Ethereum ready to lock into the protocol were quick to start earning those staking rewards too.\n\nBut these early stakers enjoyed two advantages. The first, of course, being that they had an idle 32 ETH laying around, which at that time ran folks a cool $18,700.\n\nThe second advantage was that they were mad enough to believe that they\u2019d eventually see that money back at some point.\n\nThat\u2019s right. When staking first launched, there was no way to withdraw your holdings until developers executed another upgrade called Shanghai in April 2023.\n\nFor more about Shanghai and what this was such an important upgrade, read our Learn piece on it. In sum, it lets stakers finally withdraw any of their holdings.\n\nPrior to Shanghai, though, Lido Finance emerged to effectively solve both of these problems prior to Shanghai. It let users with less than 32 Ethereum enjoy the benefits of staking Ethereum and it also helped them stay liquid, hence the term liquid staking.\n\nBefore Lido, staking on Ethereum meant you locked up your holdings and that was it, you sat on your hands, raked in the yield.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter Lido launched, though, you could stake your Ethereum with the protocol and then receive something called a liquid staking derivative (LSD), also sometimes called a liquid staking token (LST).\n\nThis token, which in Lido\u2019s case is called Staked Ethereum (stETH), held a 1-to-1 price peg with Ethereum.\n\nAnd as other DeFi projects began to adopt this token as collateral, it meant that stakers could put that stETH back to work elsewhere on Maker to mint more of its decentralized stablecoin DAI or even continue earning extra yield over on lending heavyweight Aave.\n\nHow does Lido Finance work?\n\nThat\u2019s all fine and good, and has played a huge role in Lido\u2019s ballooning market share of late, but how exactly does staking with Lido Finance work under the hood?\n\nImagine Lido as simply another layer between users and the Ethereum blockchain. Instead of users needing to maintain the technical overhead of running a validator, Lido takes care of all of this for users.\n\nThe protocol vets and onboards node operators that take care of all of this for them.\n\nPer Rated, a node-explorer platform, Lido currently has 36 node operators operating more than 273,000 nodes on Ethereum. The operators are relatively well-known and include brands like BridgeTower, ChainSafe, and Figment.\n\nBecoming an operator means following a rather rigorous onboarding process, which tests a validator's technical wit, key management practices, and even their location in the world among other requirements. This added friction is essentially meant to ensure that validators on Lido are high quality.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s because if they get slashed\u2013a type of monetary penalty\u2013due to validator downtime or attempted malicious behavior from the validators, the protocol and its users could also face some losses. This is also in part why Lido has implemented an insurance fund that takes a slice of protocol fees to protect users from hefty slashing penalties.\n\nAnd that's it (in rather broad strokes).\n\nLido Finance lets everyday users participate in Ethereum's staking process, no matter how much ETH they hold."

        "content": "A fresh analysis of the trajectory of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) by a well-known crypto analyst highlighted a trend of diminishing returns for the apex cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis observation by Coin Bureau\u2019s Guy Turner was based on a method of analyzing historical gains through key zones of support and resistance.\n\nAccording to Turner\u2019s analysis, during Bitcoin\u2019s first cycle, the support and resistance zone was approximately $1,000. With Bitcoin\u2019s peak in 2017 reaching about $20,000, this marked a 20x gain.\n\nHowever, in the subsequent cycle, where the key zone was around $10,000 and the top was $70,000 in 2021, the gain was 7x.\n\n\u201cThis suggests that BTC has diminishing returns over time, which makes sense considering that this is what happens to every asset as it matures,\u201d Turner said.\n\nBased on this pattern, Turner forecasted a potential 3x gain from Bitcoin\u2019s current key zone to its next peak.\n\nA fresh analysis of the trajectory of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) by a well-known crypto analyst highlighted a trend of diminishing returns for the apex cryptocurrencies.

With Ethereum\u2019s previous cycle support zone at $250 and a 2021 top of around $5,000, there was a 20x gain.\n\nProjecting forward, Turner predicted a 7x gain from Ethereum\u2019s current zone of around $2,500, hinting at a possible price of $15,000, which aligned with several other market predictions.\n\nProduced in association with Benzinga"

        "content": "A passionate cryptocurrency and blockchain author qualified to cover every event in the crypto space. Researching minute occurrences and bringing new insights lie within the prime focus of my task.\n\nThe second-largest crypto, Ethereum, with a share of over $213 billion in market capitalization, has an implicit price action. The bears are leaving no stone unturned to halt the ongoing ascending trend. The bulls are also making every effort to hold the price above the gains. In the meantime, the ETH price is defending the support wisely, but the rising selling pressure could cause notable hindrances.\n\nThe ETH price has been violently breaking past resistance levels, aiming to validate a long-term bullish trend. In the daily time frame, the ETH price has been steadily rebounding from the $1550 support level and the lower boundary of the substantial descending channel. Both the $1750 level and the 200-day MA are positioned around the $1800 mark, which has been decisively breached on the upside.\n\nThe market is presently on track to test the upper trendline of the channel, and if a bullish breakout occurs, then the ETH price is likely to trade above $2000 again. The latest upswing enabled the price to pierce through the pivotal resistance at $1750, but the ongoing retest is encountering challenges in advancing further. The overbought signal indicated by the relative strength index is the retracement back to $1750. After a relentless rally, the markets could now be due for a correction or consolidation phase.\n\nBesides, the Ethereum funding rates, which are considered the most useful futures market sentiment indicators, have been positive for some time now. Positive rates indicate bullish sentiment as the traders are executing the orders more aggressively. As the metric spiked massively in recent times, a probable correction or even a reversal due to a long liquidation might cause a small pullback.\n\nTherefore, the upcoming trade could be extremely exposed, and hence a flash crash could make its way out soon for the Ethereum (ETH) price."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum developers teased a new timeline for the Dencun mainnet upgrade at the most recent All Core Developers Execution (ACDE) call held on Oct. 26.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the week, precisely on Monday, Oct. 23, developers launched Devnet-10 to test the Cancun/Deneb (Dencun) upgrade. The devnet was set up with 330,000 active validators to force a change in the validator churn limit.\n\nA few bugs were found on the devnet 10 network, one relating to syncing with Prysm and another to deposit handling on Teku, both of which are already being addressed. There were also some issues related to builder-produced blocks.\n\nDuring the most recent ACDE meeting, developers discussed the timing for the introduction of Devnet-11, the Goerli shadow fork, and Dencun activation on Goerli.\n\nDevelopers decided to initiate a shadow fork of the Goerli testnet in addition to Devnet-11. By definition, shadow forks are a kind of developer-focused test network done by forking a live network with a small number of nodes.\n\nFrom all indications, Goerli will not have the Dencun upgrade implemented until late November at the earliest.\n\nGiven that testnet activations for Ethereum updates have typically occurred two weeks apart, following the activation of Dencun on Goerli in late November, two testnet upgrades are projected to take place on Sepolia and Holesky in early and mid-December, respectively.\n\nThis timeline is based on the assumption that no serious issues are discovered between testnet activations. Even the perfect timeline would position Dencun's mainnet activation sometime after the holidays in late December, according to Tim Beiko.\n\nMainnet activation of Dencun likely after holidays: Tim Beiko\n\nIn a tweet, Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko stated, \"Realistically, with Goerli forking late November and testnets usually requiring at least 2 weeks between them (so teams can fix any bugs and put out new releases), mainnet would happen after the holidays.\"\n\nThis means that Goerli would more likely happen in the latter half of November, although no date was agreed to. EL clients felt it would be best to let CL teams set the date given they have more work to do, and so we'll continue that conversation on ACDC next week. \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) October 26, 2023\n\nHe further added: \"Nothing here is set or final, of course, but there's at least a path being drawn towards Mainnet. By next week's ACDC, we'll launch devnet-11 with all clients being setup with mev-boost and try to run a Goerli shadow fork.\""

Despite this, the asset is facing headwinds as Bitcoin struggles to break past the $35,000 mark, leading to increased selling pressure across the crypto market. This has caused the ETH recovery to stall around the $1,800 level, raising questions about an impending correction.\n\nAlso Read: Mike Novogratz\u2019s Galaxy Digital Going Long On Bitcoin And Ethereum: Lookonchain\n\nadvertisement\n\nWedge Pattern Governs the Current Correction Trend\n\nThe daily candles projecting rejecting wicks on either side reflect uncertainty among market participants.\n\nA bearish breakdown below the $1750 support put Ethereum coin 15% downside risk\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $6.6 Billion, indicating a 17% gain.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nOver the past seven months, the Ethereum coin price has witnessed a correction trend under the influence of a falling wedge pattern. The coin price rebounded thrice from each of the downsloping trendlines, indicating the strong influence this pattern has on market participants.\n\nThe latest recovery stalled around the pattern\u2019s upper trendline, near the $1,850 mark, as sellers continue to defend this territory. The recent price action displays long-wick projections at this resistance level, suggesting that sellers are pressuring the asset for another downward correction.\n\nTaking a bearish outlook, a break below the $1,760 mark could catalyze increased selling, potentially driving the asset back down to the lower trendline near $1,500.\n\nWill ETH Price Regain $2000 Mark?\n\nWhile the current price behavior seems concerning the prevailing bullish sentiment has not been entirely extinguished. If the ETH price can maintain a price above $1,750, there might be an opportunity for buyers to break out from the falling wedge pattern\u2019s upper trendline. Such a breakout would effectively signal the end of the ongoing correction phase, propelling buyers toward an extended recovery with a target at $2,030\u2014an estimated upside of 14%.\n\nExponential Moving Average: A potential bullish crossover between the 20 and 100 EMA slope, could bolster buyers in maintaining current recovery trends.\n\nVortex Indicator: A positive crossover state between the VI+(blue) and VI-(pink) reflects market mood is still bullish."

        "content": "On Thursday, October 26, Ethereum client developers confirmed that they won\u2019t be implementing the Dencun upgrade before the year-end. This is because the developer clients for the consensus layer and the execution layer are at odds among themselves. The delay in the developments might put further pressure on the Ethereum price.\n\nDevelopers Cite Consensus Issues\n\nLast month, the Ethereum developers launched the new Hole\u0161ky testnet behind schedule. Also, the general consensus was that thoroughly testing the upgrade by the time the December holidays arrived was highly unlikely.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDuring yesterday\u2019s All Core Developers call the consensus seemed to align with the viewpoint of the pseudonymous Prysm developer, Potuz. He asserted, \u201cThere is no way we are implementing a mainnet fork in 2023.\u201d\n\nHe highlighted the persistent consensus issues that had emerged on the ten developer networks (devnets) established to test the upgrade over the past few months, emphasizing that \u201cnot a single one of them has gone smoothly.\u201d\n\nEthereum clients are divided into two primary categories: those responsible for the execution layer and those managing the consensus layer.\n\nIn contrast to the consensus teams, the execution layer client teams reported that they are well-prepared for the upcoming testnets.\n\n\u201cWe are in a pretty good place, a lot of things are also on Master now,\u201d stated Lightclient, a Geth developer, referring to the main digital workspace for the Go Ethereum project, where code, files, and revision history are stored.\n\nThis week marked the launch of Devnet 10, with plans for the execution clients to transition to a broader test on the Goerli testnet. However, Prysm\u2019s Potuz expressed his reservations about this idea.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely not comfortable at all having a full client fork on Goerli,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI see very significant and profound changes still being implemented in the branch,\u201d he added, referring to Prysm, the software that currently powers 45% of the consensus layer clients.\n\nAbout the Ethereum Dencun Upgrade\n\nTo ensure the security of the Ethereum scaling improvement called Proto-Danksharding, the Dencun upgrade utilizes advanced cryptography techniques.\n\nThe KZG Ceremony involved multiple participants, each contributing a secret and performing computations to merge it with previous inputs. This process leads to the creation of a \u201cstructured reference string\u201d (SRS), a critical component for the KZG Commitments cryptographic scheme, which is integral to Proto-Danksharding.\n\nThe final result of this collaborative effort is integrated into the upgrade. As long as at least one honest participant is involved in the ceremony, the entire setup remains secure. After months of gathering contributions, a total of 141,416 participants ensured a high level of security.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum scaling project Scroll has been doing well and recently clocked more than $15 million in DeFi TVL."

        "content": "Goldman Sachs Analysis: Ethereum\u2019s Path to Scalability\n\nEthereum (ETH)\u2018s upcoming Dencun upgrade, expected in the first quarter of 2024, will play a crucial role in the blockchain\u2019s journey towards scalability as a settlement layer.\n\nIn a recent note, Goldman Sachs highlighted the primary impact of the Dencun upgrade, which is increasing data availability for layer-2 rollups through proto-danksharding.\n\nThe bank claimed that this enhancement will result in reduced transaction costs for rollups, ultimately benefiting end users.\n\n\u201cDencun\u2019s primary impact will be to increase its data availability for layer-2 rollups via proto-danksharding, resulting in a reduction of rollup transaction costs which will be passed on to end users.\u201d\n\nIn the context of blockchain technology, a layer 1 network serves as the foundation or underlying infrastructure.\n\nLayer 2 refers to off-chain systems or separate blockchains built on top of layer 1s.\n\nRollups, which are part of layer 2, process transactions on a faster blockchain and then transfer the data back to the parent blockchain at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe proto-danksharding feature of the Dencun upgrade will not only improve data availability for layer-2 rollups but also lay the groundwork for future scalability upgrades, including danksharding.\n\nDanksharding is a methodology that aims to enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability by dividing the network into shards, expanding data storage capacity rather than solely increasing transaction throughput.\n\nDencun to Improve Ethereum\u2019s Scalability\n\n\n\nAccording to the Goldman Sachs report, Dencun will enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability through the implementation of rollups.\n\nAdditionally, it will optimize gas fees, improve network security, and introduce several housekeeping updates aimed at overall network improvement.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has recently admitted that centralization of nodes is one of the network\u2019s biggest challenges, given the fact that the majority of the 5,901 active Ethereum full nodes are run on centralized platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nThe Ethereum mastermind said that he hopes in the future fully verified Ethereum nodes can \u201cliterally\u201d run on a phone.\n\nHe claimed that solving the issue with centralization of full nodes is a \u201cbig piece of the puzzle\u201d to making Ethereum more decentralized.\n\nAs reported, in an effort to maintain the decentralized nature of the ETH network, several prominent liquid staking providers have implemented or are in the process of implementing a self-limit rule.\n\nThe rule ensures that these providers will not own more than 22% of the Ethereum staking market, which could help address concerns over the growing centralization of Ethereum staking.\n\nRocket Pool, StakeWise, Stader Labs, Diva Staking, and Puffer Finance are some of the staking platforms that have already committed to the self-limit, Ethereum core developer Superphiz said in a recent tweet."

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto took a breather on Friday ahead of the non-event weekend. However, the pause in the digital asset market was on the cards after a sizable rally in the last few days. However, analysts see the buying interest to remain in the digital asset market in the next few days.\n\n\n\nBitcoin saw some profit booking as the largest crypto token declined over a per cent but somehow managed to hold about 34,000-levels. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, was also seen in red, marginally lower, and remained below $1,800-level. Majority of the altcoins were trading with cuts.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market seems to be cooling off from its seven-day streak of rally. The crypto fear and greed index is also well within the greed zone with a score of 70/100, signalling bullish sentiments among crypto investors. The broader crypto market has reacted in sync and seems to be cooling off after the rally, said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch Ventures.\n\n\n\n\"In other news, Deutsche Bank and Standard Chartered's SC Ventures are testing UDPN, a system that enables blockchain, stablecoins, and CBDCs to interact like SWIFT in traditional banking. UDPN bridges blockchains, incorporates digital identity standards and facilitates regulated transactions,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring a few exceptions, the majority of top crypto tokens were trading lower on Friday. Polkadot tumbled over 3 per cent, while Toncoin, Polygon, and Chainlink were down 2 per cent each. Among the gainers, Solana and BNB added about a per cent each, while Dogecoin was marginally up.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly lower, falling down to $1.26 trillion-mark, as it declined more than a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes dropped about 7 per cent to $46.88 billion.\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nEthereum (ETH) is currently attempting a rebound after failing to breach the $1,900 resistance yesterday. The asset is witnessing ascending momentum in mid-term due to positive sentiments across the wider market. It may continue to consolidate at $1,800 levels in the short term before testing the upper boundary.\n\n\n\nImage: Chart-ETH\n\n\n\nETH is currently trading well above its 100-day moving average of $1,700 which acts as an immediate support level. Its RSI reading is at 71, cruising in overbought territory. If ETH successfully breaks and holds through the $1,835 barrier, it may retest the $1,900 levels. This may depend on Bitcoin continuing to do well.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $1,700, $1,650\n\nResistance: $1,835, $1,900\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "Following the announcement of the transition, MATIC experienced a 4% drop in its price, resulting in a reduced market capitalization of $5.8 billion.\n\nPolygon, a renowned blockchain scaling platform, reaches a pivotal moment in its evolution with the initiation of the POL token upgrade on the Ethereum mainnet. Months of meticulous development, community involvement, and a successful testnet launch have led to this remarkable milestone, solidifying Polygon\u2019s commitment to building the Value Layer of the Internet.\n\nThe Polygon (POL) Upgrade\n\nThis new token, which has recently gone live on the Ethereum mainnet, is poised to replace the existing MATIC token, aligning with the company\u2019s strategic roadmap. It\u2019s poised to become a key driver of the Polygon 2.0 ecosystem.\n\nThe POL upgrade represents a pivotal moment for the Ethereum ecosystem and the wider blockchain community. This token empowers holders to become validators within the network, offering their expertise across Polygon\u2019s wide array of technical solutions.\n\nThese solutions encompass application-specific blockchains tailored for specific use cases and zero-knowledge EVM-based networks like zkSync Era Starknet and Linea. Moreover, POL facilitates users to stake their holdings across compatible chains. Upon depositing their assets, users begin earning protocol rewards and transaction fees on each staked chain.\n\nExisting MATIC holders have been afforded a generous four-year migration window to transition seamlessly to POL. This transition demands no specific actions from MATIC holders or node operators, further simplifying the process.\n\nFurthermore, the re-staking protocol within POL empowers token holders to participate in multiple critical roles across various chains. This not only enhances the network\u2019s security but also provides opportunities for token holders to earn rewards for their contributions.\n\nIt is worth noting that this adjustment was initially unveiled in June 2023 and involves enhancements to the native gas token system and the Intelligent Bridge MATIC contract. These upgrades are supervised by a decentralized governance structure featuring an ecosystem council specifically responsible for smart contract enhancements. The Polygon Council was inaugurated few weeks ago in consonance with community agreement.\n\nPolygon 2.0 Roadmap: What Lies Ahead\n\nLooking ahead, Polygon has set its sights on ambitious goals. The platform aims to transition its Proof of Stake (PoS) chain exclusively to zkRollup, a move that promises improved scalability and efficiency.\n\nAdditionally, Polygon is determined to establish a new interoperability standard for its various chains, allowing for seamless communication and data sharing between them. This significant upgrade aligns perfectly with Polygon\u2019s 2.0 roadmap, which includes the introduction of a new staking layer and innovative zero-knowledge-proof interoperability protocols.\n\nOverall, the introduction of POL and the overarching upgrade of the Polygon ecosystem signal a promising future for this blockchain scaling platform. With enhanced functionality, seamless transitions, and a strong commitment to innovation, Polygon is poised to continue making waves in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the transition, MATIC experienced a 4% drop in its price, resulting in a reduced market capitalization of $5.8 billion."

ETH\u2019s bullish rally from the $1,550 support level extended its gains to 20% with price trading above the critical $1,800 price level.\n\nRead Ethereum [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThis surpassed the $1,700 target AMBCrypto had predicted on 23 October, based on ETH whales\u2019 accumulation. With the $1,800 price level flipped to support, bulls could be looking to hit another price milestone at $1,900.\n\nETH bulls overwhelmed sellers at multiple price hurdles\n\nAfter bulls rallied from the $1,550 support and flipped the $1,619 resistance, key price hurdles were identified for the bullish rally at $1,680 and $1,745 respectively.\n\nHowever, bulls took out both price hurdles with a single bullish candle on the 12H timeframe. This highlighted the strong buying pressure, as seen by the RSI\u2019s (Relative Strength Index) reading of 74.\n\nFurthermore, the uptick in the OBV (On Balance Volume) accelerated the bullish move past a strong bearish price zone at $1,800. Despite the pullback at the level on 24 October, bulls successfully flipped the level to support with a candle close above it over the past 12 hours.\n\nAs such, bulls can target further gains with the $1,900 price level achievable in the long term, especially if BTC extends its bullish run past $35k.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nSupply on exchanges dipped with long-term holders in profit\n\nA look at the 90d Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio showed that long-term ETH holders (3 months+) were sitting on 9.2% of unrealized profits at the current price. With the potential for more profits, investors could be encouraged to hold their positions.\n\nIn addition, the supply on exchanges continued to decline which hinted at waning selling pressure. This could be an added advantage for bulls in the push for $1,900."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), a leading player in the cryptocurrency market, has recently witnessed a significant surge in its price, outperforming many of its counterparts. With the current price of Ethereum standing at approximately $1,790.45, the market is abuzz with speculation and predictions about its potential to reach new heights. Will Ethereum reach $2,000 soon? Let\u2019s analyze in this Ethereum price prediction article.\n\nWhy is Ethereum Price Up?\n\nThe recent uptick in Ethereum\u2019s price can be attributed to the overall bullish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. This positive trend has been fueled by the anticipation of Bitcoin ETFs and the consequent rise in Bitcoin prices, which has positively influenced the entire crypto market. Ethereum, already a strong contender in the space, has benefited from this market optimism, further solidifying its position.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Will Ethereum reach $2,000?\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s current trajectory is promising, the market may experience a correction, potentially leading to a decrease of around 20% in ETH\u2019s price. However, if the momentum in the Bitcoin market continues to build, Ethereum is likely to follow suit. Current predictions place Ethereum\u2019s potential price between $2,000 and $2,500 in the near future. These targets, while ambitious, are increasingly plausible given the current market dynamics.\n\nIs it Good to Buy Ethereum Crypto?\n\nWith Ethereum\u2019s price currently near the significant support level of $1,680, this could be an opportune moment for investors to consider purchasing ETH. Implementing a strategy that includes a stop loss trigger slightly below the support level could be a prudent approach, allowing investors to manage risk while positioning themselves to benefit from potential upward price movements.\n\nHow to Buy Ethereum Token\n\nFor those interested in buying Ethereum, Bitget stands out as a recommended exchange. Known for its low fees and user-friendly interface, Bitget offers a seamless experience for both new and seasoned traders looking to buy and sell Ethereum. Given Ethereum\u2019s current price trend and the optimistic market outlook, now might be a strategic time to consider adding ETH to your cryptocurrency portfolio.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

Whereas ERCs (Ethereum Request for Comments) are application related changes that do not have any impact on core network capability.\n\nThe separation has been discussed for years, but it has not received much attention. \u201cFor years, we\u2019ve considered separating the repository,\u201d stated the proposal. \u201cThis would allow ERC and EIP specifications to evolve more naturally due to their independence.\u201d\n\nNow the community has made a decision to draft EIPs separately as Ethereum\u2019s consensus layer began utilizing the EIP process. An additional repository has been created to store Ethereum comment requests (ERCs)."

        "content": "Ethereum price rally took a breather on Thursday following a week full of song and dance among crypto investors. The talk majorly centered around the potential approval of Bitcoin spot exchange funds (ETFs), prompted by tale-tale signs of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) warming up to the idea.\n\nThe second-largest cryptocurrency broke out in tandem with BTC, seemingly ending the longstanding downtrend. For the first time since August, Ether traded above $1,800, although it had corrected to trade at $1,781 on Friday from highs around $1,864. Blockchain analytics platform IntoTheBlock highlighted a significant increase in transaction fees for both Bitcoin and Bitcoin over the last week, as holders rushed to take advantage of the price pumps.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Consolidates Gains, Will It Breakout Again?\n\nFollowing the widespread uptake of Ethereum among traders and investors rooting for the bull run, the largest smart contracts token ascending above a falling wedge pattern, as shown in the chart below.\n\nThis move marked the first significant breakout above a multi-month trendline that has been in existence since April when the bullish outlook in the early months of 2023 faded at $2,138.\n\nPrice action beyond all three applied moving averages, starting with the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (red), the 100-day EMA (blue), and the 200-day EMA (purple) encouraged traders to keep their positions open while investors fought the urge to jump on the slightest sign of profit.\n\nThe falling wedge pattern breakout was also accompanied by a significant increase in trading volume, creating a perfect environment for a major rally.\n\nEthereum price currency holds above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, which bulls would be depending on to resume the uptrend.\n\nTraders should proceed with caution but not sell out of panic, considering the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows signs of a pullback on the cards. If the RSI falls back into the neutral area from the overbought region, declines could ensue, with traders closing their positions to lock in the gains.\n\nThe Ethereum Community Eyes Increased Scalability With The Dencun Upgrade\n\nThe Ethereum community is looking forward to the release of the Dencun upgrade, expected to increase the blockchain\u2019s stability, according to a report by Goldman Sachs (GS) on Thursday.\n\nAccording to the report, the upgrade\u2019s \u201cprimary impact will be to increase its data availability for layer-2 rollups via proto-danksharding, resulting in a reduction of rollup transaction costs which will be passed on to end users.\u201d\n\nLayer 2 protocols are built on top of the Layer 1 blockchain, in this case, Ethereum, and are often referred to as off-chain systems or even separate blockchains.\n\nRollups function by processing transactions on a separate faster; they are cheaper, and more scalable blockchains that lodge the transactions onto the parent blockchain (layer 1) later.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade will significantly \u201cenhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability via rollups\u201d and is expected to have a positive effect on \u201cgas fees and improve the network\u2019s security.\u201d\n\nThis would be the next major upgrade after Shapella which achieved full staking status for Ethereum. In other words, after the upgrade investors were able to withdraw staked Ether on the Beacon Chain together with the rewards earned.\n\nIntroducing \"Perspectives\" \u2013 Your Window into the World of Crypto Insights by @intotheblock Today, we shine a spotlight on Ethereum Staking.

        "content": "The Ethereum Mainnet\u2019s Dencun Upgrade will move the blockchain in the direction of scalable settlement according to a report by Goldman Sachs, cited by CoinDesk.\n\nEnhanced security and lower gas fees\n\nThe Dencun upgrade will enhance the Ethereum Mainnet\u2019s scalability using rollups, improve network security, and optimize gas fees. It is expected to take place in the first quarter of next year.\n\nGoldman Sachs wrote that Dencun\u2019s main impact would be raising data availability for layer-2 rollups via proto-danksharding. This would lead to lower rollup transaction costs, which end users can benefit from.\n\nWhat are rollups?\n\nLayer 1 blockchains are like base layers, or the blockchain\u2019s underlying infrastructure. Layer 2 blockchains, on the other hand, are a set of separate chains or off-chain systems running on top of Layer 1s. The Ethereum Mainnet is the most-used Layer 1 blockchain.\n\nRollups process transactions on a Layer 2 chain, then port the data back to the L1 at a minimal cost.\n\nProto what?\n\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 report adds that proto-danksharding would be used to set the infrastructure for future scalability upgrades as part of the Mainnet\u2019s \u2018Surge\u2019 roadmap, including danksharding.\n\nThe Surge isthe second phase of Ethereum's developmental roadmap following the Merge, during which the Mainnet transitioned to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. During the Surge, it will scale using rollups.\n\nSharding put to good use\n\nDanksharding will enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability. It divides the network into shards, but uses them to make more space for group data instead of increasing throughput. Each shard is a separate chain with its own set of transactions and smart contracts. These shards can be processed in parallel, which can significantly increase a network's capacity and throughput.\n\nThe report emphasizes that Dencun would enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability via rollups, improve network security, optimize gas fees, and execute important housekeeping updates."

In a seed funding round that raised $6 million, the specialist in anonymous transactions received support from several notable entities, such as Robot Ventures, Bankless Ventures, and more. To the surprise of many, Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, reached into his pocket to support the project.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s Affection for Private Accounts\n\nExpanding Ethereum by all means, that\u2019s always been Vitalik Buterin\u2019s approach. He doesn\u2019t hesitate to discuss the potential integration of various features into the blockchain. The idea of providing the benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Ethereum users also appeals to him.\n\nVitalik Buterin invests in Nocturne Labs, which aims to bring private accounts to Ethereum https://t.co/1S58bKiG3Y \u2014 The Block (@TheBlock__) October 25, 2023 Vitalik Buterin doesn\u2019t hesitate to spend millions of dollars for Ethereum development\n\nThe article from The Block addressing this topic mentions a seed funding round that began early in the year, back in January. It took Nocturne Labs seven months to see their efforts rewarded. This resulted in the $6 million fund, with contributions from Bain Capital Crypto, Bankless Ventures, Robot Ventures, Polychain Capital, and Vitalik Buterin.\n\nLuke Tchang, co-founder and CEO of Nocturne, clarified that this funding round included token subscription rights.\n\nWhat Does Nocturne Labs Really Want?\n\nNocturne Labs is an American startup with the ambition to develop a protocol that supports anonymous crypto transactions on Ethereum. With this initiative, Luke Tchang\u2019s team will provide access to \u2018internal\u2019 accounts supported by Nocturne.\n\nHere is an exhaustive list of the advantages provided by Nocturne:\n\nReceive/deposit crypto funds into an anonymous Nocturne account.\n\nZero-knowledge proof (ZK) of the existence of funds.\n\nUse crypto assets to pay, trade, stake, and more.\n\nIn other words, Nocturne will make cryptocurrency asset ownership confidential. Users who are attracted to its services will no longer need to worry about potential data disclosure regarding their cryptocurrency assets, whether they are receiving payments, making purchases, or storing bitcoins (BTC) or ethers (ETH) on the blockchain.\n\nNow we understand why Vitalik Buterin supports Nocturne Labs\u2019 initiative. He, who has caused panic through unexplained transfers of ETH, may be able to conceal his transfer activities by November, when Nocturne\u2019s protocol is set to deploy on the mainnet.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Bitcoin has surged 14 per cent in the last seven days amid optimism around Bitcoin Exchange-Traded-Fund (ETF). On Tuesday, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap had touched its highest level since May 2022. On Friday, it was trading at $34,134, down from a peak of nearly $35,000, data from CoinMarketCap showed.\n\n\"The ETF anticipation is driving FOMO among investors who are flocking to Bitcoin as its market dominance grows to 2021 levels,\" said Rajagopal Menon, vice president at WazirX. Bitcoin's dominance was 53 per cent on Friday.\n\nSeveral investment firms, including BlackRock and Fidelity Investments, have pending applications for bitcoin ETFs in the US, and speculation on their likely approval was fuelled by BlacRock's iShares ETF listing on the website.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF is expected to make buying and selling Bitcoin easier through the stock market.\n\nA US federal appeals court on Monday also formalised a victory for Grayscale Investments LLC in its bid to create a spot Bitcoin ETF over objections from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. This led to market optimism.\n\n\"Remarkably, crypto as an asset class has been decoupling from other 'risk on' assets like equities, which corrected sharply due to the rising macro and geo-political instability,\" added Parth Chaturvedi, investments lead at CoinSwitch Venture.\n\nOn Friday, the market saw a sell-off but it was majorly due to profit booking. \"The crypto market is showing signs of cooling off after the mega rally in the past few days,\" said Shivam Thukral, chief executive officer (CEO) of BuyUcoin.\n\nWhat to expect?\n\n\"Bitcoin is moving up by taking support from the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA-D). However, it's still facing a challenge at the $35,000 level. If it successfully breaks through, it could reach the $39,000 to $40,000 range, with potential support around $31,000 to $32,000. For Ethereum, the $1,740 level may act as a support, and crossing $1,860 could push it toward $2,000,\" the crypto exchange CoinDCX research team said."
