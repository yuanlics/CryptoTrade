        "title": "Two Powerful Blockchain Platforms of the Future: Ethereum and Solana - Paxos",
        "content": "Blockchain, once overlooked in the shadow of cryptocurrency, is now a powerhouse player in its own right with implications far beyond the financial sector. From improving supply chain integrity to facilitating transactions for a wide range of digital assets, its use cases are vast and varied.\n\nBut what lies at the heart of this innovative technology, and how can it be harnessed? It is helpful for enterprises across many industries to understand the fundamentals of blockchain and how key platforms like Ethereum and Solana are leading the charge in this technological revolution.\n\nWhat is blockchain?\n\nBlockchain is digital ledger technology that documents transactions across a network of computers. It can log and track everything from cryptocurrency payments to real-world assets to legal agreements.\n\nBlockchain technology is renowned for its security and immutability. The technology\u2019s name stems from the fact that it\u2019s comprised of a series of \u201cblocks,\u201d with each containing transaction data, a timestamp and a cryptographic hash of the previous block. Every transaction is linked in a \u201cchain\u201d and distributed across numerous nodes.\n\nBecause of the decentralized nature of the blockchain, there\u2019s little risk of manipulation from entities like governments or financial institutions. In fact, a blockchain\u2019s structure makes it nearly impossible to retroactively alter any single record without changing all subsequent blocks.\n\nBlockchain technology offers transparency and decentralization, making it an attractive option for transactional applications\u2014among them, money movement, supply chain management and even digital identity verification.\n\nEthereum and Solana\n\nWithin blockchain technology, there are many different blockchain platforms. Two of the most prominent blockchain platforms are Ethereum and Solana, each with unique features and capabilities.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Ethereum, launched in 2015, is both a cryptocurrency and a platform for building decentralized applications. Ethereum introduced the concept of \u201c smart contracts ,\u201d or self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written directly into lines of code. The latest iteration of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain is secured using a proof-of-stake ( PoS ) consensus mechanism\u2014essentially, th e process by which validators create new blocks. ( Learn more about consensus mechanisms and how they work here .)\n\nSolana (SOL): Solana is a newer blockchain platform that launched to the public in 2020. It\u2019s known for speed and efficiency. It employs a unique hybrid consensus model, combining proof-of-history (PoH) with proof-of-stake (PoS). This enables it to process transactions rapidly and with lower fees compared to Ethereum. As such, Solana is an attractive platform for high-frequency trading and other applications requiring quick transaction times.\n\nEthereum and Solana have gained popularity because they offer solutions to common pain points related to scalability, speed and cost. These platforms have also sparked an entire ecosystem of subsequent innovation: Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality has given rise to decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nThe future of finance: instant transfers and more\n\nImagine a world where international suppliers are paid the moment goods are shipped, employees receive compensation in real-time and complex financial transactions are settled instantly. This immediacy not only streamlines business operations, but also opens doors to new financial strategies like dynamic pricing. The ripple effects of such capabilities include more agile, responsive and competitive businesses and a transformation of the way global commerce operates.\n\nBlockchains like Ethereum and Solana have the potential to make such hypotheticals into realities. With their ability to power instant, 24/7 financial transactions across borders, blockchains may be particularly attractive to enterprises operating in multiple countries or those engaging in high-volume trade, not to mention the implications for sectors like e-commerce and digital supply chain management.\n\nBlockchain technology is evolving rapidly. Many enterprises need a hand when it comes to adopting it and maximizing its potential and a trusted partner can help you seamlessly integrate blockchain into existing operations.\n\nBlockchain is transforming the way we think about money, assets and transactions and is paving the way for new business models and strategies. With the right partners to help you navigate and implement blockchain systems, your business will be well-positioned to stay a step ahead in the digital finance era."

        "content": "Bitcoin is still down on 21-month highs set directly after the SEC bungled its spot ETF announcement on Tuesday. Ethereum, on the other hand, is way up.\n\nEther (ETH) has rallied more than 16% in that time and is now easily the year-to-date best performing top-20 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Bitcoin (BTC) is so far in second-place, with about half those returns.\n\nMarkets sold the news one day early due to the SEC\u2019s unauthorized announcement and appear to have simultaneously bought the rumor on ether ETFs.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) \u2014 the original Ethereum hard fork in 25th position \u2014 is however having a moment. The blockchain\u2019s native token ETC has spiked nearly 50% over the past day.\n\nDue to the timing, there doesn\u2019t appear to be any real rhyme or reason for ETC to be climbing so quickly.\n\nThe devil\u2019s advocate would say that Ethereum Classic is gearing up for a hard fork later this month tipped to better align the network\u2019s EVM with Ethereum\u2019s, which could help inspire projects to work with the chain.\n\nAnd the network\u2019s hashrate did spike to all-time highs following Ethereum\u2019s switched to proof-of-stake in late 2022, as former ETH miners sought a substitute revenue stream at which to direct their GPU mining rigs.\n\nEther has jumped from $2,200 to $2,650 this week. Ethereum Classic has gone from $20 to $30.\n\nMuch of Ethereum Classic\u2019s post-Merge hashrate has stuck around, despite the network only seeing around 30,000 in transactions per day (about the baseline for Bitcoin Cash).\n\nFor scale, Litecoin is currently processing more than half a million transactions per day (boosted by the network\u2019s own brand of inscriptions) while Ethereum mainnet handles about twice as much, per BitInfoCharts.\n\nStill, Ethereum Classic only boasts less than 15% of Ethereum\u2019s hashrate recorded just before the Merge.\n\nETHPoW, the hard fork of Ethereum from around the Merge meant to compete with Ethereum Classic, currently has about one-tenth of the latter\u2019s hashrate.\n\nRead more: Grayscale Still Deciding What To Do With ETHPoW\n\nIn fact, until yesterday\u2019s formal SEC approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, ETC had returned nothing over the past year.\n\nThe more likely explanation is that traders are looking to frontrun the next big media narrative around crypto: the SEC approving spot bitcoin ETFs means an eventual greenlight for spot ether funds.\n\nDue to illiquid markets, dumb money or widespread left-curving, Ethereum Classic has tagged along for the ride but ended up dominating ether for gains over the short-term.\n\nGrayscale does already sell exposure to the token through one of its trusts, and the firm is now set to convert its $29 billion bitcoin trust into an ETF.\n\nSome reckon fund issuers might soon seek approval for ETFs for other cryptocurrencies, including XRP and solana.\n\nThe odds of fund issuers lining up to launch ETFs for Ethereum Classic are slim. Although stranger things have happened in crypto.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

ENS simplifies human-readable Ethereum addresses like john.eth into machine-readable alphanumeric codes commonly associated with wallets such as Metamask. As of the latest data, ENS is sitting at $23.15, following a 55.1% increase in the last 24 hours, amid a positive trend in the overall Ethereum market.\n\nTop crypto gainers of the day | CoinMarketCap\n\nThe surge in ENS price coincides with Ethereum briefly surpassing the $2,400 mark on Jan. 10, marking a 10% rise within the week, in anticipation of the Bitcoin ETF Approval. Additionally, an earlier message from Vitalik.eth underscoring the importance of CCIP resolvers for Layer 2 solutions (L2s) has also been said to feed into positive market sentiment.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum price to cross $3k after Bitcoin ETF approval?\n\nTaking the second spot in the gainers is Ethereum Classic (ETC), a hard fork of Ethereum (ETH) introduced in July 2016, which primarily operates as a smart contract network supporting decentralized applications (DApps). The live price of Ethereum Classic is recorded at $30.53 USD, after a 46% surge in the past 24 hours. The driving force behind this notable increase is again linked to the approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. SEC.

Tezos (XTZ) is a blockchain network functioning on smart contracts, although it is said to provide more advanced infrastructure. Its price surge is tied to an announcement from TezFin, the Tezos defi lending platform, which announced the launch of its production version, offering decentralized lending and borrowing on the Tezos blockchain. The live price of Tezos currently stands at $1.17, reflecting a 34.6% increase in the last 24 hours.\n\nWith cryptocurrencies being established as a tradeable asset class, many analysts believe big market moves will continue to play out in the coming days.\n\nRead more: Ethereum applications take place as top gainers ahead of ETF announcement\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Still Below $2,500? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Amid the current crypto market rally led by Bitcoin, there's one crypto that seems to be getting completely overlooked: Ethereum (ETH 1.13%). That's somewhat surprising, given that Ethereum is the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, with an enormous $290 billion market cap.\n\nHowever, the hype around a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has focused investor attention squarely on Bitcoin. At the same time, a number of direct Ethereum rivals skyrocketed to triple-digit percentage gains last year, and have become the new darlings of crypto investors looking for maximum upside. But there are several reasons Ethereum might be undervalued at its current price of about $2,400.\n\nEthereum vs. the wannabe Ethereums\n\nAt the end of 2022, Ethereum was the talk of the crypto industry. It had just pulled off The Merge, which fundamentally transformed its blockchain to make it faster, cheaper, easier to use, and much more energy efficient. The hype around Ethereum grew to the point where some investors even thought that Ethereum might eventually surpass Bitcoin in terms of market cap.\n\nBut then came 2023. All of a sudden, rival blockchains like Solana started gaining traction with investors. At one point, Solana was up more than 1,000% for the year. Avalanche, another Ethereum rival, was up nearly 200% for the year. By way of comparison, Ethereum was up 90%, and seemed to be losing the attention of investors.\n\nSo the big question is whether Ethereum is still best-in-class. If you think that the so-called Ethereum killers are just a bunch of Ethereum wannabes with no long-term staying power, then Ethereum could be highly undervalued at its current price. But if you think that Ethereum's long reign as the top Layer-1 blockchain network in the world is coming to an end, then it's a completely different story.\n\nA spot Ethereum ETF incoming?\n\nRight now, the imminent arrival of the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) for the U.S. market is getting all the headlines. But, according to a growing number of crypto investors, a spot Ethereum ETF could be coming soon. And that means that Ethereum could soon get the same type of boost Bitcoin is getting right now.\n\nCertainly, the underlying logic makes sense. Wall Street is looking for more reliable ways to invest in crypto, and has apparently determined that the ETF investment product is the best way to achieve this. Once it can show that a spot Bitcoin ETF is successful, then it's time to crank up this formula for every other major cryptocurrency.\n\nGiven Ethereum's market heft -- it now accounts for about 17% of the market value of the entire crypto market, second only to Bitcoin -- it would only make sense that Ethereum would be next in line for a spot ETF. And, indeed, there is already an application in the works for just such a product. In September, Cathie Wood's Ark Invest filed for a spot Ethereum ETF. If the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decides to approve this (admittedly, a big \"if\"), it could result in billions of dollars flowing into Ethereum, pushing up its price.\n\nA sexy new upgrade\n\nFinally, there's the matter of Ethereum's next big upgrade. Ethereum recently published its strategic roadmap for 2024, and one item on the roadmap that caught the attention of investors was something called EIP-4844 (\"Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844\"). Basically, this is a proposed technical change that would enable the processing of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain to become much faster and more efficient.\n\nI know, I know. You're probably rolling your eyes right now. What a bunch of blockchain babble, right? But consider that EIP-4844 got J.P. Morgan really excited. In a research note to clients, JPMorgan specifically referred to EIP-4844 as a key reason it thinks Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin in 2024. That's because this major technical change would make it theoretically possible for the Ethereum blockchain to handle 100,000 transactions per second, up from about a dozen or so now. With that type of speed, Ethereum would basically be unstoppable.\n\nHow much higher can Ethereum go?\n\nFirst and foremost, Ethereum needs to convince investors that it is still the preeminent Layer-1 blockchain network. So keep an eye on how Ethereum deals with the growing threat from the likes of Solana. As long as investors buy into the idea that Solana is a faster and more cost-efficient version of Ethereum, it's hard to see Ethereum skyrocketing in price.\n\nWith that in mind, it's certainly possible to find a number of bullish Ethereum price predictions for 2024. Some crypto traders think that Ethereum could double, triple, or even quadruple in value. I may not be as bullish on Ethereum, but I'm certainly open to the idea that Ethereum could surprise a lot of people in 2024."

Balchunas previously stated that he could not see a scenario where spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved but spot Ether ETFs are not. He compared the two cryptocurrencies, saying that \"Ether spot is tied to the hip of Bitcoin spot.\"\n\nThe earliest deadline for spot Ethereum ETFs decision is in May later this year for VanEck\u2019s Ethereum ETF. BlackRock\u2019s deadline is in August, however if the SEC does approve, it could approve all applicants like it did for the spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nPrior to the SEC's spot Bitcoin approval, Valkyrie Funds' chief investment officer Steven McClurg said he wouldn't be surprised if spot Ether and XRP ETFs come to market after Bitcoin. Several major asset managers, including BlackRock, VanEck, ARK Invest & 21Shares, Fidelity, and Invesco Galaxy, have filed applications for spot Ether ETFs. The SEC must make decisions on these applications by various dates ranging from May 23 to August 7.\n\nFollowing the Bitcoin ETF approval, Ethereum (ETH) gained 8.5% over the past 24 hours, and rallied over 15% in the past week, breaking above the $2.5K level, as investors speculate on the potential of a spot Ether ETF approval.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

Crypto industry experts say this signifies investor optimism for a potential ether ETF following the SEC\u2019s approval of eleven spot bitcoin ETFs earlier today.\n\n\u201cStarting with BTC ETF, we are seeing a 'buy the rumor, ignore the news, buy the next rumor' set up,\u201d said Joe Caselin, head of institutional marketing at BIT crypto exchange. \u201cBlackRock filed its ETH ETF application in Nov 2023, and while that is a lot less certain than the numerous BTC ETF applications that were just approved, the potential is huge, as it would mark the first such product for ETH, which already has a large appeal with institutional investors.\u201d\n\nBlackRock, expected to launch its bitcoin ETF on Thursday, has a track record of 575 approvals from the regulator and only one ETF rejection. The first final decision deadline for the SEC on the spot ETH ETF application, from Ark and 21Shares, is on May 23.\n\nUncertainties remain surrounding the spot Ethereum ETF approval, given the current SEC chair Gary Gensler\u2019s adamant stance that every cryptocurrency other than bitcoin is a financial security. Be that as it may, Gensler\u2019s predecessor, Jay Clayton, once mentioned that a small number of tokens might cease to be considered securities if they became broadly decentralized. Former SEC director of corporate finance William Hinman also said during a speech in 2018 that, considering its decentralized nature, ether coins are not financial securities.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nIs a Solana ETF a possibility?\n\nIf the SEC decides to approve spot Ethereum ETFs, other large-cap cryptocurrencies \u2014 such as Solana \u2014 may be next, Rachael Lucas, crypto technical analyst at Australia-based crypto exchange BTC Markets, told The Block. \u201cAlthough Solana is a comparatively young ecosystem compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, its noteworthy performance in 2023, marked by positive news and increased developer activity, has captured investor attention. Notably, Solana achieved an impressive price gain of 920%, significantly outpacing Bitcoin's 155% growth in the same period,\u201d Lucas said.\n\nCaselin of BIT shared the same opinion that an Ethereum ETF launch will bring more financial vehicles, giving access to a wider variety of crypto assets. \u201cWe might be looking at a whole range of ETFs that provide access to top market cap tokens and projects, although it may make more sense for a top 50 ETF rather than 50 individual ETFs \u2014 not unlike an S&P 500 for large-cap or 'blue-chip' tokens.\u201d"

He believes Ethereum will regain its prominence once the market calms down and the focus turns to its potential for institutional adoption.\n\nInstitutional Demand Drives Approval Prospects\n\nIn a recent analysis, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart pointed out that the SEC\u2019s approving Ethereum futures and the CFTC\u2019s classifying ETH as a commodity suggest that the possibility of the SEC approving spot Ethereum ETFs this year is increasing.\n\nA host of prominent financial institutions, including BlackRock, VanEck, ARK 21Shares, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, Grayscale, and Hashdex, are vying for SEC approval to launch spot Ether ETFs.\n\nThe SEC has set deadlines for each applicant to receive a decision on their proposal:\n\nVanEck: May 23\n\nARK 21Shares: May 24\n\nHashdex: May 30\n\nGrayscale: June 18\n\nInvesco: July 5\n\nFidelity: August 3\n\nBlackRock: August 7\n\nThis intense competition among established financial giants underscores the growing demand for Ether ETFs and the potential impact they could have on the cryptocurrency market."

Recently, BTC\u2019s spot ETFs were approved. However, there was no major increase in Bitcoin, but ETH gained bullish momentum.\n\nThere was a break above a key rising channel with resistance near $2,440 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair surged over 5% and even cleared the $2,500 resistance zone. There was a spike above the $2,600 resistance zone. A new multi-week high was formed near $2,642 and the price is now consolidating gains.\n\nThere was a minor decline below $2,600, but Ethereum stayed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent rally from the $2,346 swing low to the $2,642 high. Ethereum is now trading above $2,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nIf there is a fresh increase, the price might face resistance near the $2,650 level.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nA crypto whale, or a large holder with a significant amount of cryptocurrency, just made a large purchase of 4,677 ETH, valued at roughly $11 million, according to data from Lookonchain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe interesting thing about this purchase is that it seems to reflect a bold bullish bet on the Ethereum price.\n\nThis whale appears to be bullish on ETH and bearish on BTC, according to Lookonchain. Surprisingly, the whale exchanged his wrapped Bitcoin for Ethereum, borrowing 241 WBTC worth $11 million from Aave, which he exchanged for 4,677 ETH.\n\nWhile the real intentions of the whale remain unknown, indications point to the fact that the whale expects the price of ETH to rise shortly.\n\nEthereum outperforms Bitcoin\n\nExpectations for Bitcoin ETF approval are rising, and eyes are currently on Ethereum, which is presently outperforming Bitcoin at the moment.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin was down 2.11% in the last 24 hours to $45,647, following seesaw price activity in yesterday's trading. Ethereum, on the other hand, was up by 5.47% in this same time frame to $2,422.\n\nThis outperformance is causing Ethereum to rise against Bitcoin on multiple time frames. According to Matthew Hyland, a crypto analyst, this is not surprising, as both the BTC Futures in 2017 and the Coinbase IPO in 2021 saw ETH outperform BTC shortly after.\n\nWhile bullish expectations remain for the ETH price, it should be kept in mind that past performance does not guarantee future results.\n\nOn the other hand, legendary trader Peter Brandt retains a bearish bias from the standpoint of a swing trader rather than a \"hodler.\"\n\n\"My bias remains to be short ETH,\" Brandt said in a tweet, noting his belief that the Ethereum chart lacks underlying strength."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has advocated for a \u201cmodest\u201d gas limit increase to potentially improve network throughput.\n\nDuring a Reddit ask-me-anything (AMA) organized by the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s research team on Jan. 10, Buterin noted that the gas limit has not been increased for nearly three years, the longest time ever in the protocol\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I think doing a modest gas limit increase even today is reasonable,\u201d said Buterin during the research team\u2019s 11th AMA.\n\nButerin also made some brief calculations, saying this would imply an increase to around 40 million. The current gas limit is 30 million, according to Etherscan, so Buterin suggests an increase of 33%.\n\nEthereum average gas limit over time. Source: Etherscan\n\nThe average gas limit just after Ethereum\u2019s genesis in 2015 was around 3 million, which has increased over time along with network usage and adoption.\n\nThe Ethereum gas limit refers to the maximum amount of gas spent on executing transactions or smart contracts in each block. Gas is the fee required to conduct a transaction or execute a contract on the blockchain.\n\nA gas limit is set to ensure that blocks are not too large, which would impact network performance and synchronization. Validators can also adjust the gas limit dynamically within specific parameters as they produce blocks.\n\nIncreasing the gas limit allows more transactions into each block, which theoretically increases the overall throughput and capacity of the network. However, it also increases loads on hardware and the potential risk of network spam and attacks.\n\nRelated: Daily gas spent on EVM inscriptions surges to record high of $8M\n\nAverage gas prices, or the cost of transacting on Ethereum, are currently around 35 gwei or $1.89, according to Etherscan. However, they have increased since the beginning of 2024 and are much higher for complex smart contract operations.\n\nNetwork gas fees spiked to a 2023 high of 150 gwei in May due to the inscriptions craze. A gwei is a denomination of Ethereum that represents one billionth of a single Ether (ETH).\n\nIn November 2023, Ethereum and Bitcoin users reignited the scalability debate as fees surged amid another round of inscriptions hype.\n\nMagazine: Lawmakers\u2019 fear and doubt drives proposed crypto regulations in US"

        "content": "Ethereum Classic price is continuously going up for the past few hours and is now floating around $28, at the time of writing. It recorded more than 30% gains in the last 24 hours with almost 35% weekly and monthly gains.\n\nThe approval news of the first Bitcoin spot ETF is spreading like wildfire in the crypto industry. And, it is already showing strong signs of impact on all major cryptocurrencies including Ethereum Classic. Let us learn more about what is happening in the industry and why ETC is going up, in the present article.\n\nBitcoin Spot ETF Approved, Finally\n\nThe long-awaited Bitcoin spot ETF was finally approved by the US SEC on 10 January, 2024. Entire crypto industry has been waiting for this news for several months. And, now that it is finally approved, several altcoins and Bitcoin are following an uptrend.\n\nThe anticipation of the Bitcoin ETF approval has itself brought considerable returns for Bitcoin since the past couple of months. From around $26,600 in October, 2023, Bitcoin\u2019s value breached the $45,000 mark as soon as we entered January, 2024.\n\nWhile one of the strong reasons behind this price rally was the awaiting Bitcoin spot ETF approval, another reason is the upcoming Bitcoin halving event.\n\nAs the US SEC final judgment approached, a fake post was posted from the official X account. This caused a sharp price spike in the BTC chart. However, Gary Gensler, chair of the US SEC clarified that the US SEC account was hacked and the ETF approval post was posted by unauthorized individuals. As Gary Gensler stated that the post was fake, the BTC price dropped around 5% within a couple of hours.\n\nHowever, the US SEC finally approved the Bitcoin spot ETF application of Grayscale Investments. As a result, several altcoins like Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Pepe Coin, and others are rising in value.\n\nEthereum Hits 20-Month High\n\nEthereum Price Chart on Jan 11, 2024\n\nSurprisingly, the Bitcoin spot ETF approval has more impact on altcoins when compared to Bitcoin. The BTC price rose slightly and briefly touched the $47,000 mark whereas the Ether price increased by around 10% in the last 24 hours and is trading above $2,600, at the time of writing.\n\nEthereum has hit its 20-month high as the last time it traded above $2,600 was in May, 2022. At present, Ethereum price is recording 18% weekly gains and 16% monthly gains. And, the ETH price is expected to rise further.\n\nMost of the investors believe that Ethereum is the next best cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. Because of its sophisticated technology and network upgrades Ethereum stands out from the rest of the cryptocurrencies. And, investors don\u2019t hesitate when it comes to Ethereum in the market conditions like present.\n\nEthereum Classic to Reach the $30 Mark\n\nEthereum Classic Price Chart on Jan 11, 2024\n\nThe clear winner among all the altcoins is Ethereum Classic. The ETC price rose by 34% in the last 24 hours and is showing no signs of slowing down with its increasing trading volume. It is currently trading at around $28 and is just $2 away from reaching the $30 mark.\n\nSo far, Ethereum Classic is one of the top performing altcoins in the crypto industry after the Bitcoin spot ETF approval surfaced. In addition to the price, its trading volume is soaring by 276%, standing at $1.8 billion and implying that the price could surge further. Its market capitalization also surged by 34% and crossed the $4 billion mark today.\n\nThe approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF and the upcoming Bitcoin halving event are not only pushing the BTC price but also the prices of altcoins."

As of the most recent update, the live price of Rocket Pool stands at $31.76, accompanied by a 24-hour trading volume of $22 million, revealing a 14.9% increase in Rocket Pool\u2019s value over the last 24 hours.\n\nRounding out the third spot is Arbitrum (ARB), which stands out as an Ethereum layer-two (L2) scaling solution, employing optimistic rollups to enhance speed, scalability, and cost-effectiveness within the Ethereum network. As of the latest data, the live price of Arbitrum is currently $1.94, accompanied by a 12.1% increase in value.\n\nWith the market experiencing significant volatility this week in response to ETF updates, investors are making many big moves in the crypto space.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

Buterin stressed that the current gas limit, set at 30 million, has remained unchanged for nearly three years.\n\nThe gas limit in Ethereum represents the maximum computational effort that can be expended on processing transactions or executing smart contracts in a single block.\n\nMartin K\u00f6ppelmann, co-founder of Gnosis, observed that increasing the gas limit would also push the operational requirements for nodes \u2014 likely necessitating more costs. Nevertheless, K\u00f6ppelmann believed that the benefits of a higher gas limit, such as improved network efficiency and capacity, outweigh these potential issues.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nJesse Pollak, Coinbase protocols lead, also expressed strong support for the change. He stated, \u201cI\u2019m strongly in support of increasing the Ethereum gas limit to 40-45M \u2014 we have the network headroom and it will be beneficial for all parties.\u201d\n\nUnlike several changes to Ethereum that necessitated hard forks, the increase in the Ethereum block gas limit can be achieved through validators adjusting their node configurations.\n\nSince Ethereum\u2019s inception in 2015, the average gas limit was approximately three million. This limit has incrementally risen over time \u2014 reflecting the network\u2019s escalating usage and adoption."

Despite the optimism, SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s previous statements suggest a cautious approach to approving crypto asset securities, particularly for assets other than Bitcoin.\n\nThe price increase reflects a broader market sentiment that an Ethereum ETF could soon follow the path of Bitcoin ETFs, with firms like BlackRock and Ark having filed applications.\n\nThe possibility of an Ethereum ETF has sparked discussions about the classification of cryptocurrencies as securities or commodities, a debate that could impact the SEC\u2019s decision-making process."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, currently shows a lack of bullish momentum contrary to the generally bullish sentiment around Bitcoin spot ETFs. The ETH price has been resonating between the $2400 and $2140 horizontal levels for the past five weeks, with the overhead supply preventing the buyers from a higher rally. Will potential approval from the US SEC bolster the Ether price to escape this uncertainty?\n\n$2400 Breakout Will Trigger a Direction Rally\n\nA steep support trendline leads to the current recovery trend in the ETH price.\n\nA potential recovery may face new resistances at $2680 and $3000\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $20.8 Billion, indicating a 68% gain.\n\nAn ascending trendline in the daily time frame chart shows the Ethereum price recovery is intact and the current sideways trend is likely a post-rally consolidation to recuperate the exhausted bullish momentum.\n\nadvertisement\n\nInterestingly, the Ethereum whales have accumulated nearly $1 billion worth of Ether despite its underperformance relative to Bitcoin. A recent tweet from renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez reveals that the Ethereum smart money has significantly increased its holdings by accumulating more than 410,000 ETH tokens during the past month(December).\n\nThis accumulation amid the crypto market\u2019s progress towards the first spot Bitcoin ETF hints the ETH may also witness a major impact of US SEC approval as the potential for spot Ethereum ETF will also accelerate.\n\nBy press time, the ETH price shows a 3.77% jump and teases a bullish breakout from the $2400 resistance level. If buyers succeed in closing a daily candle above this barrier, it could lay a solid foundation for additional upward movement.\n\nSuch a breakout could potentially result in a 10% rise in ETH, setting its next target at around $2,680. Following this, a prolonged recovery could target the $3,000 and $3280 mark.\n\nThis Support Prevents ETH From Major Correction\n\nOver the past two months, the ETH price has been receiving dynamic support from an ascending trendline. The coin price rebounded several times from this support indicating the buyers are actively accumulating at a dip which is a key sign of sustainable recovery. Thus, it also indicates losing this support could intensify selling pressure and trigger a new correction in this asset.\n\nBollinger Band: An uptick in the upper boundary of the Bollinger band indicator suggests the bullish momentum is strengthening.\n\nAverage Directional Index: A low value of ADX(15%) hints the ongoing consolidation has managed to offer buyers sufficient break to kickstart a new rally.\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Are on the Move Higher Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's finally here. The long-awaited spot Bitcoin (BTC 1.93%) ETF has been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with 11 spot exchange-traded products officially getting the nod from regulators, after years of denials and a very hawkish regulatory stance. Since the Winkelvoss twins first proposed a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 2013, investors have effectively been waiting for more than a decade for this product to be launched.\n\nBitcoin briefly surged to nearly $49,000 per token following this announcement, the highest level it's seen in almost two years. Ethereum (ETH 1.09%) and Dogecoin (DOGE 5.05%) saw similar spikes this morning, but have since given up some of these gains. As of 1 p.m. ET, Bitcoin is currently trading flat (having seen a big boost in its valuation yesterday prior to this announcement), but Ethereum and Dogecoin are 6.2% and 7.7% higher over the past 24 hours.\n\nLet's dive into what this approval means for Bitcoin and other top-tier cryptocurrencies right now.\n\nWhat does this spot Bitcoin ETF approval mean for the crypto sector?\n\nThe potential impacts of this approval on Bitcoin are notable. A range of estimates for how much capital could flow into these ETFs has been put forward, but Standard Charter believes that number could be as high as $100 billion. That's a tremendous amount of money, and certainly could change the investing landscape for institutional funds looking to diversify their portfolios into these asset classes.\n\nThe SEC's official approval of a swath of ETFs could pave the way for future spot Ethereum exchange-traded products to be launched. That's a key driver of enthusiasm around the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, with Dogecoin rallying as it usually does in tandem with the sector, in a familiar higher-volatility fashion today.\n\nThe 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs approved by regulators include: Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, iShares Bitcoin Trust, Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund, Ark 21Shares Bitcoin Trust, Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, VanEck Bitcoin Trust, WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, Franklin Bitcoin ETF, and Hashdex Bitcoin ETF. These funds are now trading, and are seeing mixed performance.\n\nSome of this divergence among Bitcoin exchange-traded funds can be linked to the rather wide range of fees offered by providers. Updated pricing provided by a number of funds ahead of today's approvals show many ETFs dropping fees substantially, to as low as 0.2%. Given the similar nature of each of these funds, that could indicate a race to the bottom in terms of management fees, which is great for investors.\n\nNotably, crypto traders betting against Bitcoin have lost a substantial amount of money in the derivatives market. Estimates suggest closed short positions cost bears around $100 million.\n\nIs now the time to buy a Bitcoin ETF?\n\nThe value these ETFs provide is notable. Bitcoin, as representative of crypto and digital assets as whole, gains legitimacy in the eyes of many investors. Additionally, investors now don't have to go through the trouble of setting up a wallet, researching how blockchain technology works, and jumping through what can be perceived as too many hoops to invest in crypto.\n\nFor institutional investors, these ETFs also provide liquidity, allowing for seamless integration within their portfolios, and allowing for things like model portfolios (which are investment products tailored to specific investors) to include some proportion of crypto. Being able to readily trade Bitcoin on the open markets is a big deal for asset managers, and I think the market is correct to assume this will lead to a tsunami of cash headed into this space.\n\nEthereum's prospects in terms of getting proposed spot ETFs approved may be more murky. Given the incredibly long lag between proposals and approvals for Bitcoin ETFs, these products could still have a ways to go. That said, these approvals do provide a blueprint for regulators looking at spot Ethereum ETFs, and given the SEC's rather favorable stance toward both Bitcoin and Ethereum, one might certainly surmise that the probability of future approvals has increased over the past 24 hours.\n\nAs is the case with many asset classes, investing in ETFs has its pros and cons. For those comfortable with buying Bitcoin directly, saving even 20 basis points each year can add up over the long term. That said, for those seeking simplicity and convenience, these products certainly look more intriguing than involving oneself in the rigmarole around buying and selling Bitcoin on exchanges. Personally, I think a race to the bottom in fees could make Bitcoin ETFs the preferred investing option for most investors, and I think these are certainly worth considering right now."

We aim to solve this problem on Ethereum to enable Web2 devs to more easily and confidently enter the space.\"\n\n\"Pontem is building critical primitives for the Move ecosystems,\" Faction Partner Banafsheh Fathieh said. \"Pantera is excited to be investing into Pontem and help fuel the Move and Aptos ecosystem. We believe the team has been doing a tremendous job of building the necessary financial and technical infrastructure to bring consumers and developers to the decentralized web,\" Pantera Capital Managing Partner Paul Veradittakit added.\n\nThis latest funding round brings Pontem's total raised capital to $10.5 million, following a $4.5 million raise in June 2021 via a private token sale led by Mechanism Capital and Kenetic Capital, alongside Delphi Ventures and Animoca Brands.\n\nPontem's technology was originally developed by Aptos team members. Aptos is a relatively new Layer 1 blockchain based on the Move programming language developed at Meta \u2014 composed of people from Facebook\u2019s now shut-down Diem stablecoin project.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nIncreasing the usage of Move ecosystems\n\nMove is a Rust-derived programming language designed for creating secure and efficient smart contracts.

Pontem also argues that Move is more appealing for Web2 developers from traditional finance and tech sectors looking to build in Web3 as they are already accustomed to similar static-type languages.\n\nThe capital is earmarked for developing Move Virtual Machine products on EVM-compatible blockchains like Ethereum, including the new Move-based Layer 2 Lumio \u2014 an optimistic rollup on Ethereum that leverages alternative Layer 1s like Aptos to process transactions.\n\nPontem claims products already deployed on Aptos, including the Pontem Wallet and Liquidswap DEX, have garnered 40,000 weekly active users and up to $1 million in daily volume, respectively.\n\nPontem also said it plans to add support for the Solana Virtual Machine and other blockchain languages in the future.\n\nDisclaimer: Evgeny Gaevoy, the founder and CEO of Wintermute, previously sat on The Block's board of directors from April 2023 to early November 2023 and remains a minority shareholder."

        "content": "A passionate cryptocurrency and blockchain author qualified to cover every event in the crypto space. Researching minute occurrences and bringing new insights lie within the prime focus of my task.\n\nStory Highlights Ethereum is displaying extreme strength against Bitcoin, which suggests the token is extremely bullish in the mid-term\n\nBesides, Bitcoin's dominance experienced a fake-out after a channel breakout, which is an extremely bullish sign for altcoins\n\nThe Ethereum price displayed an epic retest after marking the daily highs above $2600. Besides, the trading volume on the previous trading day was the highest since November 2022, which elevated the levels by more than 10%. While the ETH price is pumping against Bitcoin because of bullish BTC events, it appears that the Ethereum ecosystem is heavily taking off. After marking new highs, there is a huge possibility of a bearish pullback below $2500 before triggering a fresh upswing.\n\nThe ETH price has maintained a decent upswing since the last few days of October, elevating over 70% from the interim lows of around $1522. The recent price action caused the price to pierce through the crucial resistance zone between $2400 and $2500 and closed the previous day\u2019s trade beyond $2600. Moreover, the value sustained above $2600 at press time suggests the bulls have jumped in action, and hence the target at $3000 has now been activated.\n\nAfter consolidating between the $2150 and $2400 price ranges for over a month, the ETH price broke up and reached a high above the $2600 mark. The token is experiencing a minor pullback at the moment, which could be quickly overcome by giant bullish action soon. Being different from the previous price action, the ETH price is expected to hit $2500 any time from now on. The RSI has still not marked highs above the resistance, and the price soared above the crucial resistance, indicating the bullish momentum may prevail for a long time.\n\nThe upward momentum may lift the price beyond the next target at around $2800 in the next few days, but before hitting the milestone at $3000, bulls could lose their momentum. This is when a bearish divergence in RSI will be recorded, which may compel the price to initiate a fresh descending trend. However, the current resistance zone between $2400 & $2500 may act as a strong support base, which may hold and trigger a healthy rebound soon.\n\nTherefore, the next couple of days may be extremely crucial for the Ethereum (ETH) price, as a bullish weekly close may squash the bearish narrative."

        "title": "Ready For Liftoff: Ethereum Eyes Breakthrough As Analyst Signals Upward Trend - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is currently at a crossroads that could define its trajectory in the coming weeks. Renowned crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe has shared a notably bullish perspective, highlighting Ethereum\u2019s approach to its 2022 low as a potential springboard for a breakout.\n\nIn his analysis, Van de Poppe underscores the importance of Ethereum\u2019s current positioning, suggesting that its proximity to last year\u2019s low could be a catalyst for absorbing liquidity and igniting a bullish trend.\n\nAnalyst\u2019 Ethereum Bullish Projection Amid Market Movements\n\nVan de Poppe\u2019s forecast hinges on the broader market context, particularly the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US. Should this approval materialize, he anticipates a significant impact on the ETH/BTC trading pair, potentially leading to a liquidation candle \u2013 a sharp price movement.\n\nSubsequently, Van de Poppe predicts a substantial shift in market dynamics with funds rotating into Ethereum. This move, he believes, will be accompanied by a \u201cbullish weekly divergence,\u201d setting Ethereum on an upward trajectory.\n\n#Ethereum approaches the low of 2022 and is likely going to take the liquidity there. If an ETF approval for #Bitcoin happens, I think we\u2019ll have a liquidation candle on ETH/BTC and after that a rotation into Ethereum, combined with a bullish weekly divergence. pic.twitter.com/kGq91S7kq9 \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 9, 2024\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum appears to be struggling to catch up with Bitcoin\u2019s price performance. It recently surpassed the $2,300 mark, echoing Bitcoin\u2019s surge above $47,000 \u2013 its highest since April 2022.\n\nHowever, Ethereum has seen a slight retracement and is currently trading around $2,249. This slight dip comes amid a week when the asset experienced a 5.8% decline, contrasting with its significant trading volume surge from $13 billion last Tuesday to over $23 billion today.\n\nUpward Swing With Potential Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval\n\nThe critical factor in Van de Poppe\u2019s analysis is the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US. The market is on edge, with major players like BlackRock leading the spot ETF race alongside others like Grayscale Investments, Valkyrie, and ARK 21Shares.\n\nThese firms have recently submitted updated 19b-4 filings for their proposed Bitcoin ETFs, with the market sentiment heavily leaning towards a positive outcome.\n\nBlackRock just re-filed their S-1 based on last min comments given yesterday. Hard to tell what has changed at first glance, but imp thing is that the unheard of 24hr turnaround time bt filing, comments and re-filing tells us all parties aiming to get this show on road pronto. pic.twitter.com/61cPtGJ4Oy \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 9, 2024\n\nBlackRock, in particular, has stirred significant optimism in this spot Bitcoin ETF race. With an approval decision expected by January 10, tomorrow, such a development could bolster Bitcoin and catalyze a fund rotation into Ethereum.\n\nVan de Poppe isn\u2019t alone in his bullish stance on Ethereum. Crypto Tony, another prominent crypto analyst, shares a similar outlook. Tony posits that Ethereum\u2019s path to a bullish phase could commence if it maintains above the key level of $2,130.\n\nCurrently trading above this crucial point, Ethereum\u2019s stability at or above this level is considered a sign of market strength, potentially paving the way for future gains. Furthermore, a push towards and above the $2,500 mark could significantly bolster Ethereum\u2019s bullish momentum, as highlighted by Crypto Tony.\n\n$ETH / $USD \u2013 Update The ETH range is simple. Remain above $2,130 and we are bullish ..

        "content": "Ethereum price briefly broke past the $2,400 mark on Jan. 10, up 10% within the weekly time frame, ahead of the much-anticipated Bitcoin ETF Approval.\n\nThe crypto market experienced widespread volatility on Jan 9 after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced false Bitcoin (BTC) ETF approval in a now-denounced post on X.\n\nDespite the raging controversy, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price has maintained a steady uptrend, trading as high as $2,440 on Jan. 10.\n\nEthereum vs Bitcoin: Crypto derivatives traders are betting bigger on ETH\n\nBetween Jan. 7 and Jan. 10, Ethereum\u2019s 11% price growth performance has dwarfed Bitcoin\u2019s 4%. Interestingly, vital derivative market metrics now suggest that ETH price could further outperform BTC if the SEC issues a timely positive verdict on Bitcoin Spot ETFs.\n\nFirstly, the funding rate represents the interest paid by bullish traders to inverse traders to keep their LONG futures contract positions open. As of morning trading hours Eastern time on Jan. 10, ETH currently has a Funding rate of 0.014%, which marginally exceeds currently exceeds BTC\u2019s 0.12%\n\nEthereum (ETH) vs Bitcoin (BTC) Funding Rate | Source: Coinglass\n\nPut concisely, a higher positive funding rate in Ethereum than in Bitcoin implies increased demand for long positions in the ETH derivatives market, potentially reflecting a more optimistic sentiment.\n\nIn further confirmation that Ethereum price could outperform Bitcoin, the open interest dynamics have also flashed similar signals since the week\u2019s turn.\n\nYou might also like: Bloomberg ETF analyst: Bitcoin ETF to be approved today\n\nETH open interest growth has outpaced BTC\n\nETH Open Interest has increased by 14.6% from $3.71 billion at close on Jan. 7 to $4.57 billion at the time of writing on Jan 10. Meanwhile, BTC open interest has witnessed only a 5% boost, from $6.4 billion to $7.3 billion during this period.\n\nEthereum (ETH) vs. Bitcoin (BTC) Open Interest | Source: Velo Data\n\nOpen interest represents the dollar value of all active futures contracts for a specific cryptocurrency. An increase in open interest implies more new entrants are bringing fresh capital than those closing out their positions.\n\nThe chart above clearly illustrates that the percentage increase in ETH has outpaced Bitcoin\u2019s open interest amid intense speculation on the spot BTC ETF verdict. This affirms that crypto traders are betting on Ethereum to deliver larger price gains in the days ahead.\n\nWill ETH reach $3,000 after BTC ETF approval?\n\nDespite Bitcoin pulling more media traction, the current ETH Funding rate and Open Interest trends imply that crypto traders anticipate higher price gains in Ethereum after a positive ETF verdict. If this scenario continues, ETH\u2019s price will likely reclaim the $2,500 territory.\n\nHowever, IntoTheBlock\u2019s in/out of the money around price (IOMAP) data, which groups the current ETH holders by their historical entry points, shows a major resistance sell-wall around the $2,475 range.\n\nThe IOMAP depicts that 567,150 addresses have acquired 398,810 ETH at the average price of $2,475.\n\nGiven that this cluster of holders has been holding at a loss for nearly two years, they could rapidly book profits as ETH price approaches their break-even point again.\n\nBut if the derivative traders continue doubling their bullish positions as depicted by the elevated ETH funding rates, Ethereum\u2019s price could break above $2,500 for the first time since May 2022.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Forecast, Jan. 2024 | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nConversely, if a material market even sends ETH price into a down trend, the $2,200 support level could be crucial.\n\nAs seen above, the 2.85 million addresses that had acquired 7.7 million ETH coins at the minimum price of $2,220 could mount a formidable buy-wall to avert a prolonged Ethereum price downswing.\n\nRead more: SEC approves spot Bitcoin ETF on accelerated basis\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "Why Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum Classic, and Litecoin Are Surging Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The entire crypto world has been shaken, in a positive way, by recent developments around yesterday's approval of certain exchange-traded products. For Bitcoin Cash (BCH -3.65%), Ethereum Classic (ETC -0.50%), and Litecoin (LTC -1.44%), broadly positive sectorwide sentiment appears to be a key driver behind these tokens' impressive moves higher. As of 2 p.m. ET, these three tokens have rocketed 13.9%, 34.3%, and 6.3%, respectively, over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe approvals of 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) yesterday by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has undoubtedly led to significant interest across the cryptocurrency sector today. Much of today's increase can be attributed to expectations that institutional capital will flow into this sector in dramatic fashion. In fact, projections from some analysts peg the impact of these approvals at around $100 billion. That's a win not only for Bitcoin, but for investors considering this entire space, as it legitimizes crypto for institutional and retail investors alike.\n\nLet's dive into what's behind the specific moves in these three cryptos today, over and above the obviously bullish headline news dominating the market right now.\n\nWhy are these three tokens surging today?\n\nFor Bitcoin Cash, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system tied closely to Bitcoin, today's news is obviously a net positive for this network. However, there are other key drivers supporting Bitcoin Cash's recent performance. News that cryptocurrency payments have surged to a record high in 2024 is very bullish for the likes of Bitcoin cash and other payments-focused cryptocurrencies. A report on Jan. 10 cited that nearly 1.3 million Bitcoin transactions were reportedly processed in 2023 alone, bringing the total number of Bitcoin transactions to more than 4 million. For those bullish on crypto as a payments facilitation technology, this is a strong catalyst to consider for Bitcoin Cash.\n\nFor Ethereum classic, the proof-of-work fork of the Ethereum blockchain, excitement around the potential approval for spot Ethereum ETF approvals appears to be driving interest in this adjacent token. Essentially, investors and traders appear to be speculating on a potential hard fork for Ethereum Classic, which would better align the network with Ethereum's, and improve its outlook (if Ethereum surges as a result of ETF approvals, one could argue Ethereum Classic could be due for a rally as well). Of course, such a substantial move of more than 30% may be overdone, so this will certainly be a token traders focus in on in the coming days.\n\nLitecoin's more muted rise today appears to be tied more to sector-specific tailwinds than anything else. Largely viewed as a Bitcoin and Ethereum alternative, this is a token that typically rides the tides higher and lower over specific time frames. Right now, there's a rising tide lifting most boats in this sector, and Litecoin investors are certainly pleased to see momentum taking this token higher over the past 24 hours.\n\nIs this momentum sustainable?\n\nUltimately, we'll have to see if these spot ETF approvals are a \"sell the news\" event, or a strong catalyst that puts a floor beneath crypto prices for the foreseeable future. In many respects, we won't know which outcome will materialize until after the fact. Thus, some amount of hesitation may lead to a waiting period for certain long-term investors, and could present an opportunity for buyers considering these tokens to jump in and ride momentum higher over the medium term.\n\nOverall, I think yesterday's spot ETF approvals are a bullish catalyst for the sector. For one, these approvals legitimize crypto as an asset class institutional investors can buy into. Another key factor driving sectorwide interest is the flurry of institutional capital expected for large-cap cryptos. Accordingly, for those seeking exposure to these trends, and looking for less-visible (and potentially higher-upside) ways to play crypto, these three tokens will likely continue to be in focus in the coming weeks."

It\u2019s gonna go wherever it goes.

        "content": "In this article BTC.CM=\n\nETH.BF= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nSt. Moritz, SWITZERLAND \u2014 U.S. Securities and Exchange Chair Gary Gensler fired warning shots to the crypto industry, casting doubt over whether digital coin ether would follow next in the footsteps of bitcoin to receive approval for an exchange-traded fund. After the bitcoin ETF approval, prices for ether \u2014 the token linked with Ethereum \u2014 spiked to their highest level since May 2022. That was because investors are betting on an ether \u2014 or ETH \u2014 ETF to be rubberstamped by the SEC next. The agency is due to give decisions on spot ETH ETF applications beginning in May. BlackRock, Invesco, Ark and VanEck are among the firms in line for approval, as well as Grayscale.\n\nThe SEC has long been an opponent of cryptocurrencies, and its bitcoin ETF approval in no way changed its stance in a big way. After the ETF decision, Gensler issued a statement in which he called bitcoin \"speculative\" and said it could be used for \"illicit\" purposes. One comment poured cold water over hopes of an ETH ETF. \"Importantly, today's Commission action is cabined to ETPs holding one non-security commodity, bitcoin. It should in no way signal the Commission's willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities,\" Gensler said Wednesday after the SEC decision on the ETFs.\n\nCrypto as commodities or securities?\n\nA long-running debate in the U.S. is over whether cryptocurrencies are classified as securities or as commodities. Key to Gensler's comments was his reference that bitcoin's status as a \"non-security commodity\" was one of the reasons why the SEC was comfortable approving the ETF. Gensler made clear that \"the vast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts and thus subject to the federal securities laws,\" in the SEC's view. This complicates matters for an ETH ETF. \"One distinction which I think people have to look at which is that bitcoin clearly has been bucketed as a commodity, Ethereum, there's still some question. Is it a security? Is it a commodity? And I think until that's resolved, it cannot be look at exactly like the bitcoin product, in terms of how do you structure and ETF around it,\" Bill Tai, chairperson of Aktai, told CNBC in an interview at the Crypto Finance Conference in St. Moritz. Tai said that approving an ETH ETF is \"not as clear cut\" as was the case of bitcoin. \"I do think that it's not out of the range of possibility, but there are additional factors to consider around that one because of its classification,\" Tai said. Securities and commodities are regulated under different laws and by different agencies.\n\nWill an ETH ETF happen this year?\n\nCommentators are split on when an ETH ETF may come to the market. Some, like Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange Nexo, think it will happen this year. \"I'd watch what the SEC does and not what it says, because it wasn't long ago that the prospect of a spot Bitcoin ETF seemed like a distant dream. Things move very fast in crypto and investors are front-running what they believe to be the next big spot ETF approval,\" Trenchev told CNBC by email. \"You'd have to say now that bitcoin has knocked down the door it's only a matter of when not if others will follow \u2014 most likely in 2024 \u2014 and ETH is definitely the leader of the pack.\" Christopher Giancarlo, co-founder of the digital dollar project and former chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, oversaw the introduction of bitcoin futures in 2017. He said that, in his experience at the regulator, the approval of one product opens the doors for others. \"Once we greenlighted bitcoin futures, there as a tremendous movement in the CFTC jurisdiction area for greenlighting ethereum futures and that did come 18 months later,\" Giancarlo told CNBC on Thursday. He added that he would be \"shocked\" if there weren't growing demand for an ether ETF. \"The SEC's going to have deal with the growing demand for that product,\" Giancarlo added. Others are a little more skeptical that the SEC could approve an ETH ETF in the short term.\n\nwatch now"

Discover SCENE\n\nFollowing Wednesday's landmark approval of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs, hopes that a spot Ethereum ETF could be next to market have propelled ETH to levels not seen since May 2022.\n\nEthereum is currently up 8.7%, trading at just over $2,620, per data from CoinGecko.\n\nBitcoin itself is trading relatively flat, up 2% over the past day. The SEC's approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF Wednesday followed days of confusion, including a fake tweet posted by the \"compromised\" SEC Twitter account on Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSeveral hopefuls have filed applications for a spot Ethereum ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including Ark 21Shares, BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale.\n\nThe SEC's approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF was a long time coming, but traders are betting that an Ethereum ETF might be quicker to market.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence's ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reportedly pointed to a 70% chance of an Ethereum ETF being approved by May, the SEC's final deadline for a decision on multiple spot Ethereum ETF applications. Balchunas noted that he had heard \u201con the back channels\u201d that spot Ethereum ETFs \u201cwill be fine.\u201d\n\nSEC chair Gary Gensler has repeatedly refused to confirm whether the regulator considers Ethereum a security or a commodity.\n\nPrior to taking up his post at the SEC, Gensler himself stated that the regulator considered Ethereum \"sufficiently decentralized\" that it doesn't qualify as a security.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nFollowing the SEC\u2019s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, it looks more likely that the regulator will allow spot Ether funds too.\n\nAfter that, asset managers could turn their attention to altcoins like XRP.\n\nHowever, the regulator is unlikely to allow XRP ETFs while it is battling Ripple in court.\n\nNow that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has finally ended its longstanding resistance to spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), it raises the prospect that it might accept other types of crypto funds too.\n\nSeveral of the asset managers recently granted permission to launch Bitcoin ETFs have already submitted proposals for spot Ether funds. But why stop there? After Ethereum, XRP could emerge as the next crypto ETF frontier.\n\nVanEck CEO Eyes Ripple ETF\n\nIn a recent interview, Valkyrie CIO Steve McClurg suggested that asset managers are eager to branch out into other cryptocurrencies after the approval of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWithout digressing what VanEck planned to do next, he said: \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see a lot of filings come out for Ethereum. I even think we might see something for Ripple, given the recent progress.\u201d\n\nEchoing McClurg\u2019s comments, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart also believes that XRP is the next most likely ETF prospect after Bitcoin and Ether. However, he acknowledged that Ripple\u2019s ongoing legal troubles will probably hold up progress.\n\nXRP Funds Unlikely Until Ripple Lawsuit Concluded\n\nObserving that Ethereum ETFs could be approved in the coming months, Seyffart suggested that the SEC would be unlikely to accept XRP funds while it is in the middle of a court battle with Ripple. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s happening this year unless the court case is completely done,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, whereas spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs were preceded by funds that invest in crypto futures, there is no equivalent precedent for XRP. Observing that the existence of Bitcoin and Ether futures ETFs strengthens the argument for letting funds hold the cryptocurrencies directly, Seyffart noted that \u201cwe don\u2019t have any of that for Ripple.\u201d"

        "content": "Zameer is a financial analyst and writer with a particular interest in cryptocurrency markets. He has been studying cryptocurrencies and their market behavior for several years and deeply understands the factors that affect the price of cryptocurrencies. His expertise lies in his ability to use both technical and fundamental analysis to make informed predictions about the future direction of cryptocurrency prices. He has a strong understanding of market sentiment and uses this to inform his trading decisions and price predictions.\n\nOn January 10, 2024, the SEC approved all Bitcoin Spot ETFs. The first regulated spot, Bitcoin Exchange-traded-funds (ETF), was approved by the SEC a few hours after its fake release, causing $300 Million in Bitcoin liquidation within a few hours.\n\nETF Approval, Opens ETH Gateways to $2800!\n\nOn top of this huge development, Ethereum (ETH) is currently exhibiting notable strength, surpassing Bitcoin\u2019s performance with an 8% surge, driven by the mounting anticipation surrounding the potential approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).\n\nNow that the outcome of Bitcoin ETF approvals is out, there is a growing expectation from analysts that Ethereum might experience a similar trend. Numerous institutions have already submitted applications for spot Ethereum ETFs, contributing to a supply shock as funds pour into the Ethereum market in anticipation of a potential ETF launch.\n\nETH\u2019s price action shows a bullish flag pattern due to consolidation between $2200 support and $2400 resistance. Buyer enthusiasm rises as Ethereum breaks out, suggesting a bullish 2024.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the deal? Is this correction a dip you should buy? Will Ethereum go up?\n\nTechnical, On-Chain Metrics Say\u2019s Possible but with a Twist\u2026\n\nTechnically, Ethereum\u2019s price is navigating within an ascending parallel channel, indicating a bullish stance and the possibility of reclaiming the $2,457 range high. This upward momentum could propel ETH towards the $2,800 level, marking a substantial 15% increase from its current levels. In an exceptionally bullish scenario, Ethereum might even reach the $3000, indicating a 25% surge.\n\nSupporting this optimistic outlook are various on-chain metrics. Santiment\u2019s daily active addresses metric reveals a consistent increase in crowd interaction with Ethereum, reflected in the rise of daily active addresses from 387,000 to 413,000 in under a month\u2014a 6.7% growth. Additionally, whale transactions involving transfers of $100,000 and above have experienced a notable uptick, underlining heightened investor interest.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to acknowledge the potential for correction, especially if bears take control. A downside correction could lead to ETH losing support at $2,388. In a more adverse scenario, a prolonged decline might push the proof-of-stake (PoS) token down to $2,135, signaling a potential shift in the prevailing bullish sentiment if a lower low is established. Overall, Ethereum\u2019s current dynamics are intricately tied to the broader market sentiment and developments surrounding Bitcoin ETF approvals."

        "content": "What Happened in Crypto Today: Ethereum ETFs To Be Approved by May?\n\nAfter days of volatility and months of uncertainty, the SEC finally approved the first Bitcoin spot ETF. And as K33 Research expected, this long-awaited move did not become a \"sell the news\" event, as much of the leverage had already been shaken out last week.\n\nNow that this regulatory barrier has come down, we look ahead to what other opportunities may open up in crypto. But before we gaze too far into the horizon, let's recap today\u2019s top crypto news stories.\n\nTLDR:\n\nSEC approves first-ever spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\nFund issuers engage in battle royale for BTC ETF market share, slashing fees \ud83d\udde1\ufe0f\n\nGensler offers warnings despite approving BTC ETFs \ud83d\udea8\n\nUK central banker criticizes BTC's value and efficiency \ud83d\ude10\n\nEthereum ETF approval odds look good for May \ud83e\udd1e\n\nRipple announces $785M stock buyback plan \ud83d\udcb0\n\nNow let's dive deeper into each of those topics\u2026\n\nBTC Spot ETF Approved fr! \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\nFirst, the most important news\u2026\n\nIt finally happened - the SEC approved not just one, but ELEVEN spot Bitcoin ETFs!\n\nThis mass greenlighting came on the expected deadline after months of bottled-up anticipation.\n\nFinancial giants like BlackRock, ARK Invest, Invesco and more now have the all-clear for their BTC funds. Even Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust secured conversion authority!\n\nOf course, Gary Gensler couldn't resist throwing some shade amidst his agency's watershed Bitcoin moment. Despite the reversal, he shilled the same old \"illicit activity\" \ud83d\ude44(we will cover this one in detail).\n\nETF approval unlocks billions (or maybe trillions) in fresh institutional capital and mainstream accessibility.\n\nSo is it going to impact BTC\u2019s price eventually? Read the full story!\n\nThe Hunger Games (ETF Edition) \ud83d\udde1\n\nAnd the battle royale begins! After the SEC finally (and reluctantly) approved Bitcoin spot ETFs, fund issuers drew swords to compete over market share.\n\nAnd their chosen weapon? Significant fee cuts to attract capital inflows!\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackRock led the charge - dropping its ratio to 0.25% after originally demanding a 0.3% fee.\n\nNot to be outdone - ARK Invest, 21Shares, Bitwise and Valkyrie matched with reductions down to 0.2% or lower.\n\nOf course, one player remains the elephant in the room - Grayscale still demands 1.5% with its $28 billion GBTC AUM.\n\nWhat does this fee war indicate? Is it going to help crypto in any way? Read the full story!\n\nGensler\u2019s Warnings Continue \ud83d\udea8\n\nThe chief regulator couldn't resist throwing some shade on the assets underlying these new funds. Gensler emphasized the SEC does NOT endorse Bitcoin itself following approvals. He gave the same old narratives of volatility risks and usage for nefarious exploits. \ud83d\ude44\n\nGens even dragged precious metals like gold and silver to emphasize BTC's inferior industrial utility.\n\nCheck out his entire statement!\n\nAnd while we are at it\u2026\n\nUK Central Banker Criticizes Bitcoin Again \ud83d\ude10\n\nBank of England Governor Andrew Bailey also showed his skepticism about Bitcoin this week.\n\nDuring recent UK Parliament hearings, Bailey dragged Bitcoin as an \"inefficient\" payments innovator while doubting its intrinsic value.\n\nEchoing her boss' skepticism, Deputy Governor Breeden also spotlighted crypto's lack of regulatory guardrails as hindering mainstream adoption. But she did acknowledge the landscape is slowly evolving.\n\nThe banking bureaucrats also fretted about stablecoins and their \u201copaque\u201d inner workings. Concerns we've heard ad nauseam at this point.\n\nRead the full story!\n\nEthereum ETF Approval \ud83e\udd1e\n\nAnd something we are looking forward to\u2026\n\nWith Bitcoin's ETF floodgates busting wide open, the expectation now pivots to the impending ETH spot fund verdict!\n\nAnd Bloomberg's Eric Balchunas puts the odds of approval by May at 70%. That's when the SEC deadline hits for multiple Ethereum trust applications.\n\nHe previously said he can't imagine a scenario where BTC gets the green light but not Ethereum. After all - the ETH spot is \"tied to the hip of the Bitcoin spot.\"\n\nSo with OG coin's decade-long issue finally rectified, hopes run high for Ether's emancipation soon after!\n\nEthereum itself felt the warmth of positive sentiment this week. ETH pumped 15% in the last 7 days - piercing above $2.5K resistance as fund approval odds boost bull morale!\n\nIs Ethereum going to enjoy the same price ride as Bitcoin did? Read the full story!\n\nRipple\u2019s Buyback Announcement \ud83d\udcb0\n\nRipple Labs plans to use $285 million to buy back shares from early investors at a $11 billion valuation.\n\nThis liquidity largesse offers investors a chance to offload up to 6% of their holdings. Ripple also pledged an additional $500 million to grease the wheels on payroll tax and RSU conversions.\n\nRather than rushing to IPO, the firm reaffirmed its commitment to supporting native token growth and pursuing regulatory clarity abroad first.\n\nHow is it going to impact XRP? Read the full story!\n\nAnd that wraps up the key crypto news for today.

        "title": "After the Bitcoin ETF Fakeout: Ethereum ETH Price Soars - Blockonomi",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) rallied past the key $2,400 level this week as traders speculated on the approval of a potential Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization gained over 5% in 24 hours to hit its highest level since last September.\n\nKeypoints\n\nEther price surged past $2,400 as traders bet on a potential Ether ETF following Bitcoin ETF approvals.\n\nBlackRock previously filed for an Ethereum Trust ETF which added to speculation of an Ether product.\n\nTokens like LDO, RPL, MNT, and OP also rallied as they are connected to Ethereum and could benefit from an ETF.\n\nAnalysts say Ether looks positioned for a breakout with a bullish chart pattern targeting $3,500 if resistance around $2,320-$2,382 is broken.\n\nDespite market chaos from fake Bitcoin ETF tweets, Ether price still managed to surge due to strong fundamentals and on-chain data.\n\nDriving the bullish sentiment was previous news that BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, had filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an Ethereum Trust ETF. The proposed \u201ciShares Ethereum Trust\u201d would allow mainstream investors easy exposure to spot Ether prices.\n\nWhile Bitcoin ETF approvals are widely expected this year, the BlackRock filing added credibility to hopes for an Ether product as well. This is significant because an SEC-approved crypto ETF would bring in fresh institutional capital from pension funds, endowments, and traditional finance players.\n\nAlong with Ether, native tokens of Ethereum-based protocols also benefited from the ETF speculation. For example, staking tokens Rocket Pool (RPL) and Lido DAO (LDO) notched double-digit percentage gains. As staking rewards are a prime feature of Ethereum\u2019s shift to proof-of-stake consensus, an influx of new demand from an ETF could be a boon for staking platforms.\n\nOn the technical analysis front, Ether\u2019s bullish chart signals also reinforced the positive fundamentals. According to analyst World of Charts, ETH appears to be consolidating in a \u201cbullish pennant\u201d pattern that has an ultimate target of around $3,500. To confirm this breakout, traders first want to see resistance levels at $2,320\u2013$2,382 convincingly taken out.\n\nThe promising on-chain data also buoyed market confidence in Ether\u2019s uptrend. Blockchain intelligence firm Santiment reported that the number of large \u201cwhale\u201d transactions on Ethereum rocketed higher in the past day. This suggests that deep-pocketed investors still have an appetite to accumulate more ETH at these levels.\n\nRemarkably, Ether managed to post gains despite the wider crypto market reeling from fake news of a Bitcoin ETF approval. A series of forged tweets from a hacked SEC account initially sent Bitcoin spiking before a swift plunge once the ruse was uncovered. Still, Ethereum proved resilient with its strong fundamentals and held onto daily gains of nearly 4%.\n\nWith ETF excitement building, technicals flashing bullish signals, and whales continuing to stockpile, analysts broadly agree further upside appears in store for Ether. The next key resistance level to watch is the psychological $2,500 mark, which opens the door to test $3,000 and beyond. As long as crypto adoption trends remain intact, Ethereum looks poised to continue outpacing the broader digital asset market."

        "content": "Rep. Mike Collins discloses purchasing up to $65,000 in Ethereum in early 2024, amid market surges and political events. His actions, while legal under the STOCK Act, raise questions about ethical implications and the need for stricter regulations in lawmakers' digital asset investments.\n\nUS Georgia Representative Mike Collins disclosed investments totaling up to $65,000 in Ethereum (ETH) in early 2024. This disclosure, filed on January 9 with the House\u2019s Financial Disclosure Reports Database, includes purchases of $15,000 on January 3 and $50,000 on January 8, adding to his total ETH investments of approximately $110,000 since 2023\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nCollins' engagement with Ethereum, a leading cryptocurrency, aligns with his ongoing investments in digital assets. The STOCK Act, a regulatory framework designed to prevent conflicts of interest, mandates such disclosures by US lawmakers. However, it does not prohibit them from overseeing legislation potentially related to their investments, which has been a point of contention and debate regarding the intersection of personal wealth and public service responsibilities\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe timing of Collins\u2019 investments coincides with a notable surge in Ethereum's price, which experienced an 11% increase in early January 2024. This market behavior is partly attributed to anticipations surrounding the SEC's potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, a development that could have broader implications for the cryptocurrency market\u200b\u200b.\n\nThese financial activities occur against a backdrop of significant political events, including the looming possibility of a US government shutdown and the commencement of the 2024 presidential campaign. The intersection of these political dynamics with market movements underscores the complex relationship between governmental actions and financial markets, particularly in the realm of cryptocurrencies\u200b\u200b.\n\nThis development also highlights the broader trend of lawmakers engaging in cryptocurrency investments, reflecting the growing integration of digital assets into mainstream financial practices. However, it raises questions about the need for more stringent regulatory frameworks to ensure transparency and prevent potential conflicts of interest. The ongoing debates in this arena suggest a growing recognition of the unique challenges posed by the intersection of digital assets and political governance.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Fake Airdrop for Ethereum, Solana, Tron Users Carried out by Scammers\n\nHackers target the Ethereum, Solana, and Tron crypto communities by enticing them with a fake airdrop scheme.\n\nWallet drainers, previously fixated on executing crypto scams via EVM chains, have now expanded their horizons to target Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Tron (TRX) communities.\n\nThis shift marks a concerning trend as these scammers venture into well-established crypto groups.\n\nPhishing Scams via Fake Airdrops\n\nThe modus operandi involves enticing crypto enthusiasts through fraudulent airdrops. The scammers create a webpage where users can supposedly claim Ethereum, Solana, and Tron airdrop rewards.\n\nThese scams are labeled an \"exclusive opportunity\" for the community, urging individuals to link their primary wallets for access. Scam Sniffer highlights that these fraudsters can drain various crypto wallets using this deceptive webpage.\n\nAccording to CoinGape, this development is particularly problematic given the popularity of Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, alongside Solana and Tron.\n\nThe lure of substantial crypto rewards might mislead investors, potentially resulting in significant losses amounting to millions or even billions in digital assets due to these wallet drainer scams.\n\nIdentifying and Avoiding Crypto Scams\n\nWhile scammers occasionally upgrade their strategies, identifying potential scams can still be achieved through simple checks.\n\nAccording to Blockworks, Scam Sniffer's shared snapshot reveals grammatical errors on the fraudulent airdrop webpage, serving as a red flag for cautious users. However, it's crucial to remain vigilant as scammers adapt and refine their tactics over time.\n\nTo stay secure, always verify the source of such links. If a reputable entity is not the source of the airdrop updates, it is advisable to steer clear of such offerings.\n\nFurthermore, heightened caution is necessary, considering recent incidents where hackers compromised verified X accounts of well-known companies like Certik and Mandiant to promote crypto scams.\n\nEarlier this month, Certik experienced a similar attack on its X account, followed by Mandiant on January 4, 2024, raising concerns about the security of even the most established platforms.\n\nPhoto: Nahel Abdul Hadi / Unsplash\n\nTokenPost | [email protected]"

He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nWith Bitcoin ETFs finally approved, and the call for spot ETH ETFs rising, Ethereum is now standing at the threshold of a potential surge, with pivotal developments setting the stage for a remarkable bull in January. The imminent activation of the Dencun upgrade, known as the protodanksharding upgrade or EIP-4844, on the Goerli testnet on January 17 is poised to be a game-changer.\n\nEIP-4844: Unleashing Efficiency\n\nThe Dencun upgrade, specifically EIP-4844, aims to cut Layer 2 transaction fees on Ethereum by introducing \u201cdata blobs\u201d \u2013 sizable data pieces linked to Ethereum blocks and rollups. This innovation enhances efficiency and lowers transaction costs within the Layer 2 scaling solution.\n\nBy implementing EIP-4844, Ethereum looks forward to freeing up Ethereum\u2019s processing capacity, streamlining operations, and enabling rollups to handle transactions at a much lower cost.\n\nThe Expected Bullish Storm\n\nEthereum is on a positive trajectory, surging to $2,500 after the SEC approved the Spot Bitcoin ETF. Keeping steady above key levels like the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages at $2,231 and $1,959, analysts now set their sights on a promising target: the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,004.\n\nAs Ethereum gears up with the Dencun upgrade, the optimistic market sentiment following the approval of the Spot Bitcoin ETF has made investors eagerly wait for a potential 50% surge within reach in January."

        "content": "In the weekly chart analysis, Ethereum Classic (ETC) has shown a departure from the lower high formation that characterized the previous bearish trend until 2022. After a year-long consolidation range throughout 2023, ETC struggled to surpass the resistance at $23.\n\nA recent resurgence, however, has resulted in a bullish breakout from the consolidation range, signaling a notable trend reversal for Ethereum Classic. This breakout is seen as a significant entry point for traders on the sidelines.\n\nThe heightened market activity has contributed to a remarkable 250% increase in the 24-hour trading volume, supporting the sharp upward movement and hinting at the potential continuation of an uptrend. Currently trading at $28.43, Ethereum Classic has formed a bullish engulfing candle in the daily chart.\n\nThe breakthrough above the $25 barrier positions Ethereum Classic for a sustained bullish rally. The rising sentiment in the market is fostering increased risk appetite among investors, contributing to the broader uptrend in the altcoin market.\n\nUnder favorable market conditions, Ethereum Classic\u2019s price trajectory may lead to a breakout beyond multiple resistance levels, with a potential target of $40 on the horizon. However, should ETC struggle to maintain its momentum, a retest of the $25 level could be in the cards. Traders and investors are closely monitoring market dynamics to gauge the sustainability of Ethereum Classic\u2019s current bullish momentum."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) continued its upward trajectory Wednesday, clocking a 10% gain in 24 hours to breach past the vaunted $2,600 mark. Market watchers attribute this surge to a confluence of factors, primarily fueled by anticipation of a forthcoming Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the wake of the expected approval for a Bitcoin ETF in the US.\n\nIn a historic move that cryptocurrency aficionados hope will bring more individual and institutional investors into the market, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has approved the first spot bitcoin exchange traded funds on Thursday.\n\nEthereum ETF Buzz Sparks Strategic Moves\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a noticeable trend towards frontrunning the ether ETF,\u201d noted Alex Onufriychuk, CEO of Kaminari, in a Telegram message. This sentiment aligns with the prevailing belief that Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, would be the next candidate for an ETF after Bitcoin.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire, a prominent investor, dubbed a \u201cwhale\u201d in the crypto universe, made a strategic move by transferring 9,705 ETH (nearly $23 million) from Binance to Compound. This was followed by a 12 million Tether (USDT) loan, seemingly used to further accumulate ETH. The whale subsequently executed three profitable ETH transactions, netting roughly $5 million.\n\nThis decisive action signaled two things: confidence in Ethereum\u2019s future and the potential for profit-taking, which could introduce short-term volatility. Despite the risk, the whale\u2019s activity bolstered positive market sentiment.\n\nEthereum currently trading at $2,607.8 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nFurther validating this optimism, Ethereum\u2019s network metrics experienced a surge. Both network growth and token velocity saw increases, indicating heightened interest from new addresses and more token movement. These on-chain metrics paint a promising picture for ETH\u2019s future.\n\nETH Futures Surge Amid ETF Optimism\n\nAlso adding to the bullish case, Open Interest for ETH futures contracts jumped 15% in recent days, reaching $4.57 billion at the time of writing. This signifies more traders entering the market and anticipating significant price gains following a potential ETF approval.\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin Open Interest | Source: Velo Data\n\nAccording to reports, crypto traders expect Ethereum\u2019s price to rise after a favorable ETF judgment, even though Bitcoin is getting more attention in the media. If this situation plays out, the price of ETH could soon go beyond $2,600.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market remains volatile, and unforeseen factors could still impact prices.\n\nThe timeline for an Ethereum ETF approval is uncertain, and regulatory hurdles could create delays. Additionally, broader market conditions and news on Ethereum development could also play a role.\n\nInvestors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions, particularly in the dynamic and unpredictable world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nFeatured image from Medium\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Traders are now monitoring the products to assess their financial impact. While Bitcoin gains stay limited, Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins have registered maximum gains after the ETF approval.\n\nEthereum Investors Cheer the ETF approval\n\nSoon after the news of Bitcoin ETF approval, the Ethereum (ETH) price surged by a staggering shooting past $2,600 levels. Several market analysts have already predicted that ETH is likely to outperform BTC in Q1 2024.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAs Ether experienced a notable surge, its positive momentum extended to other cryptocurrencies within the Ethereum ecosystem. Tokens affiliated with Polygon observed a 13% increase, Chainlink saw an 11% advance, and Uniswap registered an impressive 14% surge.\n\nThe speculation around a Bitcoin ETF becoming a reality has prompted a shift in trader focus towards Ether, anticipating the next narrative of an Ethereum ETF. Conor Ryder, Head of Research at stablecoin company Ethena Labs, notes that with Ether appearing relatively inexpensive compared to most other tokens, traders are strategically positioning themselves in anticipation of developments in the Ethereum space.\n\nLooking ahead, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is slated to make decisions on spot Ethereum ETF applications starting in May. Major players such as BlackRock, Invesco, Ark, VanEck, and Grayscale, seeking to convert its existing Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF, are among the firms awaiting approval. Speaking to CNBC, Ryder added:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about getting ahead of the narratives \u2014 bitcoin has rallied versus ether for the last six months thanks to spot ETF speculation, and ETF approval ties a bow on that narrative. Meanwhile ETH has struggled to find any momentum and has underperformed compared to most of the smaller Layer 1s,\u201d or blockchain networks, like Solana and Cardano\u201d.\n\nOver the last 24 hours, ETH has experienced a surge of over 10%, contrasting with a general decline in Ethereum NFTs. Notably, Moonbirds has witnessed a drop exceeding 23%, marking its first instance below 1 ETH in history. Additionally, MAYC has seen a decrease of more than 6%, with approximately 290 MAYC currently in Blend liquidation auction status.\n\nAltcoins Join the Party\n\nApart from Ethereum, other altcoins like Cardano have also joined the party. The Cardano (ADA) price is up 12.48% and is currently trading at $0.58 with a market cap of $20.5 billion. As per the breakout on the technical chart, the ADA price can rally all the way to $1 this year.\n\nAt the same time, the Avalanche (AVAX) and Polkadot (DOT) prices are also up by 11.47% and 14.6% respectively."

She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nThe crypto industry starts the day with a strong bullish sentiment as the SEC has given the approval of the Spot Bitcoin ETF which resulted in the market displaying significant price action. Further, the leader of altcoins, ETH has added over 8% to its portfolio over the past day.\n\nThe Ethereum price traded in a consolidated range between $2,248 and $2,137 for a while, following which the market gained momentum and the price successfully broke out of the range.\n\nHowever, the rally was short-lived as the price faced rejection at $2,342, after which the ETH coin price traded under a bearish sentiment and experienced a pullback within the range. After multiple attempts, the bulls regained momentum and jumped over 11% in its valuation.\n\nTradingView: ETH/USDT\n\nAfter facing a price restriction of $2,450, the star altcoin displayed significant price volatility and after a second failed attempt to break out of the resistance, the bulls lost momentum and recorded a correction of over 10%.\n\nFollowing this, the price traded in a narrow space between $2,200 and $2,300 for a period, after which the bulls regained momentum and successfully broke out of the range. Recently, the price experienced a jump of over 16%, indicating a strong bullish sentiment in the market.\n\nThe technical indicator, MACD, displays a constant rise in the green histogram, indicating increased buying-over-selling pressure in the market. Further, the averages show a significant uptrend, suggesting a bullpower in the space.\n\nWill Ethereum Rise Back Up?\n\nIf the bulls push the price above the resistance level of $2,615, the ETH price will regain momentum and test its upper resistance level of $2,700. Maintaining the price at that level will set the stage for the ETH price to attempt to test its resistance level of $2,750 in the coming time.\n\nNegatively, if the bears overpowered the bulls, the ETH price will lose momentum and fall to test its support level of $2,500. Moreover, if the negative reversal occurs, the Ethereum price will plunge and prepare to test its lower support level of $2,450 by the weekend."

        "title": "Ethereum ETF Countdown: Analysts Optimistic on Potential Approval This Year - Coinspeaker",
        "content": "The SEC faces deadlines ranging from May 23 to August 7 to make decisions on Ethereum ETF applications.\n\nThe crypto market is buzzing with expectations as analysts predict a high likelihood of the approval of Ethereum (ETH) Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the coming months.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 Confidence and Comparisons with Bitcoin\n\nEric Balchunas, a notable ETF analyst at Bloomberg, has expressed optimism, estimating a 70% chance of approving an Ethereum spot ETF by May. This potential approval could have huge implications for the crypto market, as Ethereum continues gaining attention from institutional and retail investors.\n\nBalchunas draws parallels between Ethereum and Bitcoin, stating that he couldn\u2019t envision a scenario where spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved while spot Ether ETFs are not. He emphasized the interconnected nature of the two cryptocurrencies, noting that \u201cEther spot is tied to the hip of Bitcoin spot\u201d.\n\nBalchunas, who has reportedly heard positive signals through informal channels, believes that spot Ethereum ETFs \u201cwill be fine\u201d. Balchunas\u2019 70% probability is worth taking note off. This is because the approval odds issued on spot Bitcoin ETFs last year turned out positive.\n\nAdding to the positive sentiment, Digital asset lawyer Joe Carlasare expressed confidence in the eventual approval of Ethereum spot ETFs this year. However, he adds a cautious note, suggesting that the approval process may take longer than expected. Carlasare believes the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is working to establish a precedent that allows it to exercise discretion in determining which digital asset ETFs can enter the market, discouraging a flood of applications for various tokens.\n\nCarlasare anticipates that spot Ethereum ETFs might not commence trading until the third quarter of 2024, contrasting with the optimism of some applicants like Hashdex, which hints at potential trading as early as the second quarter. Notably, the timing of the launch remains uncertain, even though the approval odds are relatively high.\n\nJames Seyffart, another Bloomberg ETF analyst, supports the case for spot ETH ETF approvals, pointing out that the SEC implicitly accepted Ether as a commodity when approving Ether futures ETFs in September. The analyst believes this prior acceptance could pave the way for spot Ether ETFs to gain regulatory approval.\n\nEthereum ETF Application Deadlines\n\nMultiple asset managers, including BlackRock Inc (NYSE: BLK), VanEck, ARK Invest & 21Shares, Fidelity Investments, and Invesco Galaxy, have filed applications for spot Ether ETFs.\n\nThe SEC faces deadlines ranging from May 23 to August 7 to make decisions on these applications. If the SEC approves one, it may potentially approve all, similar to the approach taken with spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nMeanwhile, the anticipation of Ethereum ETF approval is already influencing the market. Following the recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs, ETH experienced a surge of 7.92% in the past 24 hours, with a notable 17% rally over the past week according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nEthereum\u2019s open interest also rose by 11.52% to $7.81 billion, signaling increased trading activity and a bullish sentiment."

        "content": "Share:\n\nMarket picture\n\nThe US Securities Commission (SEC) has announced the approval of the Bitcoin-ETP. The initial fake announcement of this created a spike in volatility. This is a stark reminder of how short-term traders are vulnerable to volatility from the news.\n\nBitcoin soared to $48K before returning below $45K. Technically, these moves fit into a trend formed back in late October last year and gained new momentum after December's sideways consolidation. It's worth preparing for a scenario where altcoins, currently appearing undervalued compared to the leading cryptocurrency, start taking centre stage. But that doesn't negate the potential for BTCUSD to reach $50-51K before a significant correction.\n\nEthereum is obviously attracting the attention of speculators, adding over 13% in less than 36 hours, as it is the next favourite for ETP approval. Potentially, these expectations could drive the price of ETH up in the next couple of months all the way to the $3500 area \u2013 the peak in April 2022.\n\nNews background\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, traders lost nearly $1 billion due to a fake tweet about ETF approval. According to Bitfinex, the liquidation of positions in the futures market was the largest since August 2023.\n\nAbout a dozen fund companies in Hong Kong are exploring the possibility of launching spot bitcoin ETFs, HashKey reported. Potential issuers include firms with Chinese capital, as well as from other Asian and European countries.\n\nRobert Kiyosaki, author of the best-selling book \"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\", suggested the price of the first cryptocurrency to rise to the $150K level after the ETF was approved. According to him, he will \"buy more gold, silver and bitcoin with fake dollars\"."

According to the analyst, if Ethereum successfully breaks out of this pattern, it could surge toward a significant level of $3,500.\n\n$Eth Trend Is Up Consolidating In Bullish Pennant Expecting Breakout Soon Incase Of Successful Breakout Expecting Move Towards 3500$#Crypto #Eth #Ethusdt #Ethereum pic.twitter.com/nlqbMfh3k0 \u2014 World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) January 10, 2024\n\nCrucial Resistance Zone: Ethereum Path To Breakout\n\nAdding to World Of Charts\u2019 optimistic outlook, crypto trader Skew has identified the $2,320\u2013$2,382 range as a key resistance zone for Ethereum. This price range has historically acted as a barrier to Ethereum\u2019s upward movement, with \u201cnumerous rejections\u201d witnessed at these levels.\n\nSkew emphasizes the importance of Ethereum closing above $2,400 on the 1-hour and 4-hour charts. This decisive move would breach the resistance zone and confirm Ethereum\u2019s bullish momentum.\n\nSkew also noted that technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and stochastics still display significant momentum, supporting the potential for Ethereum\u2019s continued upward trend.\n\n$ETH 4H\n\nMaybe it\u2019s time for ETH to shine & run, would definitely help if the BTC Spot ETF is legitimately approved later $2320 \u2013 $2382 has proven to be strong resistance with numerous rejections the key confirmation would be a solid 1H & 4H close above $2400 4H trend &\u2026 pic.twitter.com/taWbcC7eWY \u2014 Skew \u0394 (@52kskew) January 10, 2024\n\nEthereum\u2019s Solo Bull Run Amid Market Turbulence\n\nDespite recent market turbulence, including the plunge of several cryptocurrencies, including BTC, following the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) fake spot ETF approval announcement, Ethereum has shown resilience and is currently in the green.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, Ethereum has climbed by 5.5%, surpassing the $2,400 mark before a slight retracement to around $2,381 at the time of writing. This bullish trend is further supported by increased trading volume, which surged below $30 billion to approximately $39 billion in the past day.\n\nSkew suggests that Ethereum\u2019s bullish momentum could receive an additional boost from the potential approval of a Spot BTC ETF. If such approval were to come to fruition, it could further support Ethereum\u2019s upward trajectory.\n\nThis sentiment is echoed by Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, another renowned crypto analyst, who also foresees Ethereum\u2019s approach to its 2022 low as a precursor to a potential breakout. Van de Poppe believes that Ethereum\u2019s current positioning near last year\u2019s low could be crucial in absorbing liquidity and fueling a bullish breakout.\n\nVan de Poppe\u2019s analysis highlights the broader market context, specifically the awaited decision on a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US. An approval, he predicts, could notably impact the ETH/BTC trading pair, potentially triggering a sharp price movement known as a liquidation candle.\n\nFollowing this, Van de Poppe anticipates a significant reallocation of funds into Ethereum, accompanied by a bullish weekly divergence, propelling Ethereum onto an upward trajectory.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen believes that Ethereum (ETH) is about to collapse against Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIn a new strategy session, Cowen tells his 789,000 YouTube subscribers that the ETH/BTC ratio is likely repeating a historical pattern and might soon lose a key support level.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it can\u2019t ever bounce, and if it does bounce the bull market support band is what you would look towards and that\u2019s currently at around .055 BTC. So I would keep an eye on that in case there are any bounces.\n\nBut I still think that there\u2019s a good chance that we are just emulating what happened over here [in December 2017] and that we are about to enter this phase of the cycle [similar to 2019-2020] where support finally breaks [at the 0.049 BTC level], it comes down into these levels over here, finds some type of a bottom [at around 0.037 BTC], goes sideways for a while and then maybe by the end of the year starts trending back up [to 0.049 BTC].\u201d\n\nETH/BTC is trading for 0.049 BTC ($2,298) at time of writing.\n\nCowen acknowledges that the ETH/BTC pair has both lower highs and higher lows in the weekly time frame, which makes it difficult to predict the trading pair as bullish or bearish.\n\n\u201cHow best to explain Ether/Bitcoin higher lows is perhaps on some type of logarithmic regression curve. And it is important to point out the higher lows\u2026\n\nBut one concerning aspect are these lower highs.

        "title": "Top Altcoins To Watch Post ETF Approval: Ripple (XRP), Ethereum (ETH) And Solana (SOL) Set To Fully Capitalize - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nContrary to predictions that Bitcoin\u2019s price would quickly exceed $48,000 and settle around $50,000 following SEC\u2019s approval on spot ETF, the pump is yet to occur. Meanwhile, the altcoin market has seen a notable rise, with leading altcoins showing an average growth of 10%-20%. In addition, Ethereum (ETH) has surpassed its $2,500 resistance mark, reaching close to $2,700, with XRP and SOL prices set to capitalize on the current momentum.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Recent Failure Induced An Altcoin Pump\n\nFollowing the SEC\u2019s decision on the spot ETF application, which did not have the expected impact on BTC\u2019s short-term targets, the altcoin market witnessed a surge in buying interest. ETH investors grew more confident about the possibility of a spot ETH ETF approval.\n\nAdditionally, investors are looking forward to a potential XRP ETF, which may materialize in the coming years, given the ongoing SEC lawsuit against Ripple. Furthermore, the recent approval of a Bitcoin ETF is expected to inject billions of dollars into the market, significantly increasing the DeFi market cap and potentially leading to further gains in Solana\u2019s price.\n\nIn the past few hours, the altcoin season index has seen a remarkable exponential increase, rising from a low of 56 to reach 67. It\u2019s worth highlighting that should this metric exceed 75, it could signal the start of an altcoin season. In such a scenario, many investors may shift their focus to altcoins if Bitcoin fails to show any promising trends.\n\nXRP Price Analysis\n\nXRP is currently facing a decline following Bitcoin\u2019s rejection at $49K. However, the downtrend might not intensify as the market holds bullish momentum. As of writing, XRP price trades at $0.598, surging over 6.7% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nCurrently, the 100-day EMA is holding buying confidence and the RSI is trading below the overbought region, suggesting an advantage for the bulls. In the coming days, we might see a bullish attempt to break the crucial resistance at $0.66, pushing XRP\u2019s price above $0.74.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nEther experienced a significant surge from its 20-day EMA, reflecting strong buying interest at lower prices. However, this upward momentum faced a rejection soon as the price reversed from $2,700, suggesting bearish dominance near that level. As of writing, ETH price trades at $2,585, surging over 6.1% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nShould the price remain stable above $2,500, it would signal a continuation of the upward trend. In this scenario, the ETH price may retest $2,700, followed by a potential climb to the significant $3,000 mark.\n\nSolana Price Analysis\n\nSolana price is hovering within a descending channel pattern as it continues to struggle near the resistance line at $107. However, bulls are defending the SOL price above moving averages. Currently, Solana is trading at $99.3, surging over 4.9% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nThe EMA lines are showing a leveling trend, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trading close to the midpoint. This reflects a state of equilibrium between the supply and demand. If SOL breaks the current momentum above the channel\u2019s resistance line, we might see a surge toward $120."

        "content": "The crypto community is discussing the chances to see the spot ETH ETF applications approved in May 2024.\n\nIn the aftermath of the recent approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US, major cryptocurrencies, Ethereum included, witnessed a significant rally.\n\nWhile Bitcoin (BTC) saw a modest 1.35% gain, Ethereum (ETH) emerged as the standout performer, surging by 10% to surpass $2,600, reaching its highest value since May 2022.\n\nAnalysts had expected a possible \u201csell-the-news\u201d reaction to the ETF approval, anticipating BTC to reach a new all-time high. However, the leading crypto asset underperformed and maintained its $47,000 position attained on January 9 before the ETF approval.\n\nNevertheless, K33 Research senior analyst Vetle Lunde suggested that BTC\u2019s price could see improvement with the deal flow on the ETF approval, hinting at a potential cycle pushing BTC\u2019s price beyond $300,000.\n\nEthereum Breaks Resistance amidst Strategic Trading\n\nWhile BTC maintained its $47,000 position, Ethereum broke the resistance, currently trading around $2,645 at the time of writing, signaling renewed interest among traders.\n\nConor Ryder, the head of Research at Ethena Labs, a stablecoin company, opined that traders are strategically accumulating the digital asset due to ETH\u2019s comparatively lower price compared to many other tokens like BTC in anticipation for more developments within the ecosystem.\n\nWith ETH currently trading beyond $2,600, the crypto community hinted at the possibility of an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval. Last year, asset management companies such as VanEck, Ark Invest, and Hashdex submitted applications with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot Ethereum ETF product.\n\nThe financial watchdog is expected to make decisions regarding the applications in May 2024 and market analysts believe the SEC would approve the investment products in the coming months.\n\n$272 Million Liquidated after Bitcoin ETF Approval\n\nMeanwhile, the broader crypto market also witnessed positive movements, with the top 10 digital assets (excluding stablecoins) recording gains of more than 4% within 24 hours. Solana, (SOL) Cardano (ADA), Binance Coin (BNB) Avalanche (AVAX) Ripple (XRP), and Dogecoin (DOGE) showed increases ranging from 4% to 14% upon the BTC spot ETF approval.\n\nHowever, the surge in crypto prices led to significant liquidations, totaling approximately $272 million across more than 85,000 traders.\n\nBitcoin traders incurred losses of nearly $85 million, with ETH\u2019s price surge resulting in significant losses for short traders, amounting to $54 million. Long traders for Ethereum faced approximately $30 million in losses.\n\nNotably, a $3.81 million short position against Ethereum on Binance marked the most substantial liquidation. Other assets like SOL, XRP, and BNB also saw notable liquidations.\n\nBinance and OKX emerged as the platforms with the highest total losses, accounting for more than $190 million at press time."

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum Classic price formed a double-top reversal pattern that hints at a 21% decline.\n\nPrice indicators highlight the potential of the pattern failing due to bullish broader market cues.\n\nThe anticipated spot Bitcoin ETF approvals will likely have a bullish impact on altcoins, benefiting ETC.\n\nEthereum Classic price was seemingly adhering to the micro bearish reversal pattern, which failed despite the recent correction in the crypto market. The short-term outlook ahead of the spot Bitcoin ETF approval is now looking bullish as ETC is bouncing back from the crucial support of $19.33.\n\nEthereum Classic price notes a bearish reversal pattern\n\nEthereum Classic price on the 4-hour scale invalidates the double-top bearish reversal pattern that has been observed in the past four weeks. This pattern consists of two peaks or tops of nearly identical height positioned closely together, with a trough in between. It suggests a possible shift in market direction.\n\nThe potential trend reversal is indicated by the price encountering a resistance level on two separate occasions without successfully surpassing it. This is often interpreted as a sign to consider selling or initiating short positions as further declines in the market.\n\nIn the case of Ethereum Classic, this double top was formed at $23.42, with the neckline or support level of the pattern being marked at $19.33. This is also the breakout level, and an extended decline below this line would confirm the bearish reversal pattern. Furthermore, a successful pattern would only be observed when ETC falls to the target price of $15.24, which, according to the pattern, would register a 21% decline on the 4-hour chart.\n\nHowever, Ethereum Classic price took the other route and, instead of falling through the neckline, bounced off it to note minor recovery, trading at $19.90 at the time of writing. Although this does not rule out the potential for decline, the price indicators do suggest invalidation of the pattern is likely, too.\n\nETC/USD 4-hour chart\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator are giving out mixed signals, with the former still sitting in the bearish zone and the latter noting a bullish crossover.\n\nEthereum Classic RSI and MACD\n\nIf Ethereum Classic price continues the current path and broader market bullish cues kick in, ETC could move sideways or upwards beyond $20 and invalidate the bearish pattern.\n\nOn the other hand, if the Ethereum namesake falls through the neckline and falls below $19, the bullish thesis would be invalidated, and the reversal pattern could be deemed mildly successful since absolute success would warrant a 21% correction."

        "content": "The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs has sparked optimism among ether traders, who are hoping for a spot ether product as well.\n\nBlackRock has already filed a prospectus for its iShares Ethereum Trust, a spot ether exchange-traded fund, with the SEC.\n\nThe potential approval of an ether ETF could increase investment and interest in Ethereum-based projects and layer 2 networks, leading to more innovation and growth within the ecosystem.\n\nThe historic U.S. approval of spot bitcoin [BTC] exchange-traded funds (ETF) on Wednesday has buoyed ether [ETH] traders, who are betting the token that powers the Ethereum network could be next in line.\n\nNew deadline to obsess over just dropped\n\n\n\nMay 23rd is the final deadline for decision on VanEck\u2019s spot ETH ETF pic.twitter.com/dgi5EVbPeQ \u2014 Will (@WClementeIII) January 10, 2024\n\nThe ETH price has jumped 10% in 24 hours, while bitcoin added 1.3%. Tokens of layer 2 networks, which operate as individual blockchains but are ultimately built atop Ethereum, surged as well. Arbitrum\u2019s ARB and Mantle\u2019s MNT both gained more than 20%. Other Ethereum ecosystem tokens, ranging from meme coins to those that power Ethereum-based applications, rose 14% on average, the category tracked by CoinGecko shows .\n\n\u201cThe largest smart money inflows\u201d were directed toward the Ethereum ecosystem in the past 24 hours, Nansen analyst Martin Lee said in a Telegram message. Nansen defines smart money as wallets that trade or invest in a way that is considered experienced or well informed and are usually profitable.\n\nThe process for a spot ether ETF has already started. Ark 21Shares and VanEck, both sponsors of approved bitcoin ETFs, filed the paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) back in September. And BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager and also a bitcoin ETF sponsor, filed an S-1 prospectus for its iShares Ethereum Trust in November.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome traders told CoinDesk that an ether ETF could bolster the growth of Ethereum-based financial applications, whose use cases range from on-chain trading and lending to issuance of real-world assets, or tokenization, on the blockchain.\n\n\u201cA potential approval of an ether ETF could further legitimize Ethereum's standing in the mainstream financial world, leading to increased investment and interest in Ethereum-based projects and layer 2 networks,\u201d said RJ Ke, a researcher at Ethereum rollup service Taiko. \u201cThe anticipation could foster more innovation and growth within the Ethereum ecosystem as well.\u201d\n\nBets on Ethereum-based tokens may spark a reversal of fortunes for ETH investors, which underperformed bitcoin in 2023. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, climbed more than 150% last year while ether, the No. 2, added about 90%.\n\n\u201cThe approval of the Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC has opened the door for other cryptocurrencies,\u201d said Lucy Hu, a senior analyst at Metalpha, in an email. \u201cThe market is now paying close attention to Ethereum ETF applications ... As the ETH spot ETF deadline is coming close, we believe more institutional investors will allocate more ETH in their portfolios this year to capture more returns.\u201d"

This whale withdrew a considerable 9,705 ETH ($22.9M) from Binance [BNB], subsequently depositing the funds into Compound.\n\nIn a strategic move, the whale borrowed 12M Tether [USDT] to further accumulate ETH. The trading activity involved three ETH transactions, two of which resulted in profits, accumulating roughly $5M.\n\nThe whale\u2019s decisive actions introduce a spectrum of implications for ETH. On one hand, the substantial investment signals a level of confidence in ETH\u2019s future potential, bolstering positive sentiment within the market.\n\nConversely, the increased incentive for profit-taking introduced an element of risk, potentially impacting short-term price stability.\n\nAnalyzing ETH\u2019s price movement\n\nAs of the latest data, ETH was trading at $2,415.34, reflecting a positive growth of 5.07% in the last 24 hours. Crucially, metrics such as network growth and velocity experienced a surge.\n\nThis indicated heightened interest from new addresses and an increase in token movements, collectively contributing to a positive outlook for ETH\u2019s future.\n\nThe MVRV ratio, a metric gauging the profitability of ETH addresses, expanded in tandem with the recent surge in price.\n\nWhile this points to increased profitability for ETH holders, it also raises the specter of potential sell-offs, which could exert downward pressure on prices.\n\nCounterbalancing this, the rising long/short ratio, indicative of a prevalence of long-term addresses over short-term ones, suggests a greater inclination toward holding rather than selling.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nA holistic view of Ethereum\u2019s network revealed consistent gas usage, a critical metric for measuring transaction activity. However, a concerning decline in NFT trades on the network raises questions about overall network vitality.\n\nThe reduced engagement with NFT transactions may signify a shift in user preferences or potential challenges faced by the NFT sector within the Ethereum ecosystem."

        "content": "It has been a volatile week in the altcoin market so far, with most coins currently in the red.\n\nHowever, Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) have bucked this trend, showcasing impressive resilience amid the broader market downturn.\n\nEthereum Eyes Breakout as Trading Volume Spikes\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH is trading around the $2,430 level \u2013 just below last week\u2019s high.\n\nETH has posted two bullish daily closes in a row and looks to be heading for a third if the current momentum can be sustained.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, ETH\u2019s price is still trapped in a range between $2,150 and $2,450 \u2013 a range that has been in play since early December.\n\nHowever, the recent bounce from the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) on the daily time frame suggests that the token could be positioned to break out of this range to the upside.\n\nSpot trading volume for ETH has soared 35% in the past 24 hours as investors look to get involved before any breakout occurs.\n\nThis uptick in trading volume has come at the same time as the Crypto Fear & Greed Index ticking into \u201cExtreme Greed\u201d territory.\n\nAs such, all of the necessary factors are there for ETH to potentially make a run back to December\u2019s yearly high in the coming days.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix Continues to Post Presale Gains as Stake-to-Mine Feature Catches Attention\n\nAlongside Ethereum, another altcoin that\u2019s making progress while the market struggles is Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX).\n\nUnlike ETH, Bitcoin Minetrix is not yet listed on the open market and is still in its presale phase \u2013 yet has just passed the $8 million funding milestone.\n\nInvestors have been piling into the presale in recent weeks due to the discounted price of BTCMTX that\u2019s on offer.\n\nCurrently, investors can buy BTCMTX tokens for just $0.0127 \u2013 although this price is only available for one more day before increasing by 8% in the next stage.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s presale has seen enormous traction, mainly due to the project\u2019s groundbreaking Stake-to-Mine feature.\n\nThis feature enables everyday crypto users to stake BTCMTX tokens and earn \u201ccloud mining credits\u201d as a reward.\n\nThese cloud mining credits can then be used to mine Bitcoin \u2013 significantly streamlining the mining process.\n\nGiven that the Bitcoin mining sector is expected to be valued at over $4.7 billion by 2028, this Stake-to-Mine setup has the potential to tap into a significant and growing market.\n\nMore than 16,500 people now follow Bitcoin Minetrix on Twitter, demonstrating the growing interest in the project\u2019s features.\n\nWith a stellar roadmap containing plans for a dedicated mobile app and cloud mining partnerships, Bitcoin Minetrix could be an altcoin with an exciting future ahead.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nSEC ETF Confusion Triggers Altcoin Selloff\n\nAlthough Ethereum and Bitcoin Minetrix are performing well, most coins in the altcoin market are currently experiencing a downturn.\n\nInvestor sentiment appears to have shifted bearish in the past 24 hours, leading to price drops for leading altcoins like Solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP).\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) has been one of the worst-hit altcoins, dropping over 8% in the past 24 hours alone.\n\nThis bearish trend appears to be linked to the ongoing confusion around whether a spot Bitcoin ETF will be launched in the US or not.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the SEC\u2019s official Twitter account was hacked, leading to a fake tweet being posted that said a spot ETF had been given the green light.\n\nHowever, shortly after, SEC chair Gary Gensler announced this was incorrect and that a spot BTC ETF had not yet been approved.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this led to chaos in the crypto market, causing the price of Bitcoin to rally and then drop.\n\nThe volatility spread to the altcoin space, contributing to the sell-off in major coins and tokens.\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as Analyst Says ETH ETFs are Coming in 2024 \u2013 Time to Buy?\n\nThe Ethereum price has surged by 10% in the past 24 hours, rising to $2,656 on the day after the SEC approved its first ever batch of spot-based Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nYet ETH seems to be doing better than most coins today, with its 24-hour gain surpassing the 6% rise the market as a whole has made in the past day.\n\nIt\u2019s now up by 19% in a week and by 98% in a year, with experts now suggesting that the altcoin is the next in line to have spot-based ETFs approved for it in the US.\n\nAnd given ETH\u2019s already-strong fundamentals, 2024 could end up being a very big year for the coin.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as Analyst Says ETH ETFs are Coming in 2024 \u2013 Time to Buy?\n\n\n\nETH is clearly in the middle of a breakout at the moment, with its price shooting well beyond its 30-day average and likely to break its current resistance level (red).\n\nIt will therefore come as little surprise to see that the coin\u2019s relative strength index (purple) has just topped 70, signalling very strong momentum while also leaving room for further gains before we enter overbought territory.\n\nLikewise, the 30-day is now rising more steeply beyond the 200-day average, providing another clear sign that ETH is seeing lots of buying pressure.\n\nIf this weren\u2019t already clear enough, the coin\u2019s trading volume \u2013 at around $53 billion \u2013 also provides a very strong indicator that ETH has likely begun a bull phase.\n\nIt actually seems that, after buying up Bitcoin (BTC) over the past few weeks, whales have now turned to Ethereum, with data showing some very aggressive accumulating at the moment.\n\nAfter the spot #Bitcoin ETF was approved, this whale continued to borrow $WBTC and exchange it for $ETH. This whale borrowed a total of 621 $WBTC($28.95M) and exchanged it for 11,663 $ETH at a rate of 0.05327. The whale is long the ETH/BTC trading pair!https://t.co/4uE6Lhgjzx pic.twitter.com/4x93OmYRHL \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 11, 2024\n\nIndeed, some analysts now predict that it\u2019s only a matter of months before Ethereum benefits from the approval of its own spot-based ETFs in the US.\n\nFor instance, analyst Will Clemente noted yesterday on X that May 23 is the final deadline for the proposed VanEck Ethereum-based ETF.\n\nAs with the now-approved batch of BTC ETFs, these and other ETH ETFs could do wonders for the Ethereum price in the next few months.\n\nAnd when combined with Ethereum\u2019s strong fundamentals as a layer-one blockchain, the launch of such funds could enable ETH to rise to new heights this year.\n\nAs such, now may be the last time to buy ETH this year before it gets too pricey.\n\nEmerging High Potential Altcoins\n\n\n\nFor those who may worry that ETH is heating up too much, there are other promising alts in the market that also have the potential to rally big in the next few weeks.\n\nThis includes Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), an Ethereum-based stake-to-mine platform that has raised over $8 million in its soon-to-ending presale.\n\nOne of the most interesting new projects in crypto, Bitcoin Minetrix will enable users to mine BTC by staking the platform\u2019s native token, BTCMTX.\n\nUsers who stake BTCMTX will receive tokenized mining credits in return, which they can then spend to pay for Bitcoin mining to take place on their behalf.\n\nOn top of this, staking will also earn them a steady income in the form of BTCMTX, making Bitcoin Minetrix potentially one of the most profitable tokens to hold this year.\n\nThe presale has just entered its nineteenth stage, with investors able to join by going to the official Bitcoin Minetrix website.\n\nAdvantages of #BitcoinMinetrix: Convenient accessibility. Efficient cost structure. \ud83d\udcb5 Abundant space and peaceful environment. No concerns about resale value. \ud83d\udd01 pic.twitter.com/slptHOIHNk \u2014 Bitcoinminetrix (@bitcoinminetrix) January 11, 2024\n\nThey can buy BTCMTX at a price of $0.0128 per token, yet this price is likely to rise much higher once the coin lists on exchanges in the next few weeks.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix NowDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

This report highlights that he had previously declared an investment of up to $45,000 in Ether during 2023.\n\nFinancial Disclosure Reports Database submitted by Mike Collins\n\nCollins reported investments in Ethereum totaling $110,000 as part of his mandatory financial reports to Congress under the STOCK Act on January 9, 2024.\n\nHis recent transactions include purchasing Ethereum worth $15,000 on January 3 and an additional $50,000 on January 8. This active engagement in cryptocurrency trading dates back to at least 2023.\n\nThe reports align with an 11% rise in Ethereum\u2019s market value over a week. This increase may be linked to expectations about the U.S. SEC\u2019s decision on a Bitcoin ETF."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin Advocates for Modest Gas Limit Increase in Ethereum Network\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has recommended a \u201cmodest\u201d increase in the gas limit to enhance the potential throughput of the Ethereum network. During a Reddit ask-me-anything (AMA) organized by the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s research team, Buterin emphasized that the gas limit has not been raised for nearly three years, marking the longest duration without an increase in the protocol\u2019s history.\n\nVitalik Buterin on Ethereum Gas Fees\n\n\n\nIn response to a question during the AMA, Buterin expressed his view, stating, \u201cHonestly, I think doing a modest gas limit increase even today is reasonable.\u201d He highlighted the historical context, noting that the last increase occurred around late 2021 with the implementation of EIP-1559, which effectively doubled the gas limit but resulted in only a roughly 9% increase in actual average usage.\n\nButerin went on to propose a potential gas limit of around 40 million, suggesting a 33% increase from the current 30 million gas limit reported by Etherscan. He explained that allocating the gains from Moore\u2019s law post-2021 between increased capacity and enhanced ease of syncing and verification would justify such an increase.\n\nThe Ethereum gas limit, a crucial parameter that influences the network\u2019s capacity for processing transactions and executing smart contracts, has evolved. Buterin\u2019s suggestion aims to strike a balance between accommodating the growing demand on the Ethereum network and ensuring efficient syncing and verification processes.\n\nAs Ethereum continues to advance and undergo network upgrades, decisions regarding parameters like the gas limit play a crucial role in maintaining a healthy and scalable blockchain ecosystem. The proposal for a modest increase aligns with ongoing efforts to optimize Ethereum\u2019s performance and adapt to changing demands.\n\nEthereum Gas Fees Surge Again, Averaging Around 35 Gwei Amid Increased Network Activity\n\n\n\nThe cost of transacting on the Ethereum network, measured by gas prices, has seen a surge, currently averaging around 35 gwei, or $1.89, according to Etherscan. This increase has been notable since the beginning of 2024, with higher fees observed for complex smart contract operations.\n\nEthereum gas fees reached a peak of 150 gwei in May 2023 during the NFT craze. The scalability debate was reignited in November 2023 as fees surged amid another wave of NFT-related activity. Data from Ycharts indicates a 141% increase in Ethereum gas fees over the past year, reaching a current fee of 0.9084 USD/tx.\n\nThe rising fees on Ethereum have led users to explore alternative solutions, with layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum gaining popularity due to their promise of faster and cheaper transactions. Ethereum\u2019s modular approach to scalability may take time to materialize fully, prompting users to seek more immediate alternatives.\n\nOne potential solution to address high fees is the EIP-4844 upgrade, designed to make it cost-effective to send layer-2 data to the mainnet using blobs. The EIP-4844 upgrade is expected to go live in the first half of 2024.\n\nFrom a price perspective, Ethereum recently surpassed the $2,130 resistance level that had held for over a year. However, the momentum has slowed, and the price is currently consolidating below the $2,600 level."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as Inflows Surge to $29 Million \u2013 Can ETH Hit $5,000 This Month?\n\nThe Ethereum price has bounced by 5% in the past 24 hours, hitting $2,411 as the cryptocurrency market as a whole has actually dipped by 0.1%.\n\nETH\u2019s move today means it is now up by 1.5% in a week and by 7.5% in the last 30 days, with the biggest altcoin in the market also sitting on an 81% gain in the past year.\n\nThese moves come as weekly Ethereum inflows top $29 million, according to the latest CoinShares data, making ETH the most popular altcoin among funds.\n\nAnd with the market hoping for a big surge in the event of Bitcoin ETF approvals today, the Ethereum price could rally strongly very soon.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as Inflows Surge to $29 Million \u2013 Can ETH Hit $5,000 This Month?\n\n\n\nMore than most other major coins, ETH really looks like it\u2019s on the brink of making strong price gains in the next few days.\n\nIts RSI (purple) has just risen back up to 60, a sure sign of increasing momentum, particularly after the indicator dropped below 50 a few days ago.\n\nAt the same time, ETH\u2019s 30-day average is climbing more steeply again after slacking in recent days, another indicator that buying pressure is growing for the coin.\n\nOne of the encouraging signs as far as ETH is concerned, is that its support level (green) has risen consistently in recent weeks, implying that even if it doesn\u2019t rally continuously, it\u2019s not going to fall hard anytime soon.\n\nAnd as the latest CoinShares report makes clear, ETH is the most popular alt in the market this week, with its inflows comfortably exceeding those of its nearest rival, Cardano (ADA).\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 2024 is off to a strong start, with US$151 million in inflows! Total inflows since the Grayscale vs SEC lawsuit now stand at US$2.3 billion.

The #SEC's stance signals a shift.

        "content": "Thu 11 Jan 2024 \u25aa 4 min of reading \u25aa by Family Trading \u25aa\n\nThe price of Ethereum has crossed the upper limit of its range, propelling it towards a new high. Let\u2019s examine the future prospects for ETH together.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Situation\n\nThe price of Ethereum was stuck in a range for more than a month. This period of consolidation ended, stimulated by the approval of the first Bitcoin spot ETFs by the SEC. As a result, ETH broke through its previous peak at $2,400, reaching the level of $2,600. It\u2019s also important to mention that the CME Ethereum contract is on the verge of filling its bearish gap dating back to May 2022.\n\nThus, the recent fluctuations in Ethereum indicate that the bullish trend continues. This assertion is supported by the upward orientation of the 50 and 200 day moving averages. On the oscillators side, they remain above the median threshold. This signals a bullish momentum. However, a potential bearish divergence with ETH\u2019s price suggests a slowdown in this dynamic, which could signal an upcoming period of consolidation or decline.\n\nETH/USD price chart on daily timeframe\n\nThe current technical analysis has been carried out in collaboration with Elie FT, an investor and passionate trader in the cryptocurrency market. Now a trainer at Family Trading, a community of thousands of proprietary traders active since 2017. You will find Lives, educational content and support around financial markets in a professional and warm atmosphere.\n\nFocus on Derivatives (ETHUSDT)\n\nThe open interest in Ethereum saw a significant rise of over 35% in two days. This increase started from $2,240. This surge represents the addition of over $1 billion on Ethereum\u2019s perpetual contracts. Given that Ethereum\u2019s trend is bullish, we can conclude that the majority of traders were anticipating a continuation of this upward trend. This assumption is reinforced by the fact that significant liquidations of short positions did not have a notable effect on the open interest.\n\nETHUSD Open Interest\n\nAssumptions for the Ethereum (ETH) Price\n\nIf the price of Ethereum maintains above $2,400, we could anticipate a bullish continuation up to the $2,700 level. The next resistance to consider, if the upward movement continues, would be the threshold of $29,000 to even $3,000. At this stage, this would represent an increase close to +17%.\n\nIf the price of Ethereum fails to hold above $2,400, we could envision a fallback to $2,140. The next support to consider, if the downtrend continues, would be more or less around the $2,000 level. At this stage, this would represent a decrease close to -23%.\n\nConclusion\n\nJust like its parent cryptocurrency, Ethereum is starting the year 2024 with notable volatility, partly due to the excitement related to the highly anticipated SEC decision regarding Bitcoin spot ETFs. On this matter, the question arises: After Bitcoin ETF, is it Ethereum\u2019s turn? What is certain is that it will be crucial to carefully observe the price reaction at the various key levels to confirm or refute the current assumptions. It\u2019s also important to stay vigilant about potential \u201cfake outs\u201d and market \u201csqueezes\u201d in each scenario. Finally, let\u2019s remember that these analyses are based solely on technical criteria, and cryptocurrency prices can also move rapidly due to other more fundamental factors.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

However, the reversed blockchain won the market competition, keeping the original name and the ticker ETH \u2014 further attracting more capital.\n\nIn 2022, Ethereum hard-forked again with \u201cThe Merge,\u201d moving from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake network. Therefore, miners and proof-of-work supporters migrated to the classic chain, now with greater relevance.\n\nETC is currently trading at $29.50, surging by more than 41% since the Bitcoin ETF approval that moved the entire cryptocurrency market. In particular, the classic version reached a local high at $32.16 on January 11, still far behind the biggest chain.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) could reach $44 on January 31\n\nInterestingly, CoinCodex\u2019s machine learning algorithm believes ETC will continue its bull rally. Data retrieved by Finbold at the time of publication shows a forecasted price of $44.41 on January 31.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) price prediction. Source: CoinCodex\n\nThis projection would mean another 50% increase in Ethereum Classic from current prices. Meanwhile, the artificial intelligence believes ETC can reach even higher levels at $53 per token a few days before.\n\nIt is important to understand that Ethereum Classic has a significantly low hashrate and a smaller Web3 ecosystem. Essentially, ETC still faces security risks and lower adoption compared to Ethereum, challenging its growth in the competitive cryptocurrency market.\n\nAll things considered, the accuracy of the above projection will depend on the project\u2019s ability to attract demand. Investors must remain cautious and correctly evaluate the risks and opportunities of Ethereum Classic.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Consensys CEO and Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Joseph Lubin says there\u2019s a massive amount of sidelined capital waiting for crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to hit the market.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, Lubin says there are hundreds of billions of dollars sitting in the hands of professionals in the traditional finance industry waiting for easier, regulated exposure to digital assets via an ETF.\n\n\u201cThere is so much money on the sidelines managed by registered investment advisors (RIAs) in different kinds of funds like retirement funds and companies that want to access the technology, that want to gain exposure to these uncorrelated assets or digital asset classes.\n\nAnd so there was a bit of a run-up by speculators in our own industry in the price of Bitcoin anticipating these ETFs and soon hopefully an Ethereum ETF, but the point is, there\u2019s a giant amount of money \u2013 hundreds of billions of dollars on the sidelines that\u2019s waiting to get in and get exposure to this asset class.\u201d\n\nLubin says although the SEC doesn\u2019t directly reveal any of its plans or intentions to the Ethereum Foundation, after Bitcoin (BTC), he thinks ETH is likely the next best candidate for a spot ETF approval from the regulator.\n\n\u201cEthereum is arguably the most mature ecosystem, the deepest ecosystem. As a platform for decentralized applications, there\u2019s just so much infrastructure and activity around the world. Bitcoin is a narrower technology but it\u2019s a reasonably mature technology so they\u2019re both prime candidates.\n\nSolana is a great technology but it\u2019s not a mature ecosystem yet.\u201d\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Today, we continue our two-part article series on Ethereum apps. To recap, we reveal 10 Ethereum apps to watch in 2024. These 10 apps all serve very different purposes. And, I\u2019m sure that you, as a user, will find one that\u2019s just right for you.\n\nBefore we begin, do check out the first part of this article series here. If you\u2019ve done so, let us check out App #6 below.\n\n6) Daylight\n\nNumber 6 of the Ethereum apps we\u2019re watching in 2024 is Daylight. Daylight\u2019s main product is an Application Programming Interface (API). In short, an API provides a way for two programs to talk to each other. Daylight\u2019s API does just that, for:\n\nWallets.\n\nTools.\n\nCreators.\n\nPost-transaction recommendations are now live on @daylight! After someone transacts, we surface the top 3 mints they are most likely to do based on our relevance data: social graph, holdings, etc. Next year, we will power this in our app partners to increase engagement. pic.twitter.com/Q3JAMXleJc \u2014 Kyle McCollom \u2600\ufe0f (@kylemccollom) December 22, 2023\n\nBut, what does Daylight\u2019s API do exactly? Well, its API focuses on recommendations. For instance, let\u2019s say you mint an NFT from a collection. With this data, Daylight\u2019s API recommends another three other NFT collections that you may like. Hence, you\u2019ll find more NFTs that suit your preference.\n\nDaylight isn\u2019t just for NFTs though. Said API can be integrated within wallets or apps. In turn, this creates a lot of potential use cases. With your transaction data, Daylight helps you find more of what you like in crypto.\n\n7) Dookey Dash\n\nNumber 7 of our 10 Ethereum apps is Dookey Dash. The creator of this game is the renowned Yuga Labs. Yes. That\u2019s the same team behind blue-chip NFT projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and CryptoPunks.\n\nI love to play with numbers. In some of these games, I concede defeat when trying to achieve top ranks. So, I make self-achievements like matching my lb rank with token ID. Got close with @yugalabs #DookeyDash REAL close with @10KTFshop Bell rankinghttps://t.co/taQOZqc2eX pic.twitter.com/8Vzfykwqsk \u2014 \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6\ud835\udc02\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc0d (@CDNHODLer) January 5, 2024\n\nIn summary, Dookey Dash is an NFT game. One that is simple but requires skills and reflexes. As you can see from the video above, you\u2019ve got to dodge a ton of obstacles. At the same time, you\u2019ve got to collect items too. The longer you last in the game, the higher the points you get.\n\nSadly, the game is not open to the public at the moment. But, you can follow the Yuga Labs Twitter account. Once the game is back, they\u2019ll announce it. You can then try it out first-hand.\n\n8) Unlonely\n\nNow, if you aren\u2019t into just having fun yourself, check out Unlonely. It\u2019s one of the more fun Ethereum apps you can use. That\u2019s because it links you up with others on the livestream. So, it\u2019s similar to a \u201cWeb 3 Twitch\u201d platform. Indeed, any lonely person with this app will for sure feel \u201cUnlonely\u201d.\n\nwe\u2019re cooking\u2026 let us cook \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83e\udd0c if you\u2019re new to love on leverage and weren't able to catch everything live (or just miss us too much already), here\u2019s a one stop shop to tide you over until the next one \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/7IFCPz2vcS \u2014 \ud83d\udfe2 Live on Unlonely (@unlonely_app) October 18, 2023\n\nWell, of course, Unlonely isn\u2019t all about just watching each other online. You can participate in prediction markets too! All while on the live stream. So, you can bet if a couple will go on another date or not. Or, you can bet on live sports results. The possibilities are endless here. Hence, if you frequently use Twitch, do check Unlonely out too!\n\n9) Hypersub\n\nNext is Hypersub, one of many NFT Ethereum apps. Hypersub is an NFT subscription platform. But unlike other apps, it has a special feature that you might or might not like. It grants NFT creators the ability to add an expiration date to their NFTs. So, you could be the owner of an NFT you like, but only for a limited time.\n\n9. hypersub @withfabricxyz a nft subscription platform. although still nascent, i think the idea of adding a time expiration for creators is really special. creators usually get the short-end of the stick when offering \"lifetime\" access to their offering. pic.twitter.com/DGwWeVzscj \u2014 0xDesigner (@0xDesigner) December 28, 2023\n\nWith this feature, Hypersub can attract many NFT creators. Two of which showcase their work in the above tweet.\n\n10) Spinamp\n\nLast but not least, we\u2019ve got Spinamp. It\u2019s a leading project amongst music Ethereum apps, simply because it works well. It plays good music and it\u2019s got a great app. And, it\u2019s got a pipeline of artists launching their work here.\n\nSo many people still going to OpenSea to listen to the entire @RaverRealm soundtrack \u2026 Found out that all of the songs are found on @spin_amp on a DOPE player Hehe have this entire playlist on repeat today baby \ud83e\udd24 pic.twitter.com/J3nG7UzRuq \u2014 Jadyn Violet | Text me 732-655-2159 (@jadynviolet) November 27, 2023\n\nIndeed, Spinamp has built an app that truly brings value to its users on-chain. But, no amount of words can describe beautiful music. Hence, we urge you to give the Spinamp app a try. You can download the app here. It\u2019s available for iOS, Android, and Desktop.\n\nConclusion\n\nTa-da! We\u2019ve shown you the 10 Ethereum apps to watch for 2024! But sometimes, just watching the apps doesn\u2019t make sense. You\u2019ve got to download one that suits you and then try it out. By doing so, you\u2019re also contributing to the Web 3 ecosystem as well.\n\nNote: This article was inspired by this tweet.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information discussed by Altcoin Buzz is not financial advice.

        "content": "According to disclosure documents filed with the U.S. House of Representatives, Georgia Representative Mike Collins purchased up to $65,000 worth of Ether (ETH) in 2024.\n\nAccording to a Jan. 9 filing with the House\u2019s Financial Disclosure Reports Database, Rep. Collins revealed he had purchased up to $15,000 worth of ETH on Jan. 3 and up to $50,000 worth of the token on Jan. 8. The U.S. lawmaker has been trading ETH since at least 2023 according to similar filings, reporting total purchases up to $110,000.\n\nSource: Financial Disclosure Reports Database, U.S. House of Representatives\n\nUnder the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, or STOCK Act, U.S. lawmakers are largely required to report investments to Congress. However, they are still permitted to oversee or propose legislation on matters potentially related to their investments, which many have called a potential conflict of interest between their public service and personal wealth.\n\nCollins\u2019 ETH purchases came as the token\u2019s price surged more than 11% in the last seven days, from roughly $2,200 on Jan. 3 to $2,466 at the time of publication. Some experts have speculated that ETH could rally in response to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission potentially approving a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund for the first time \u2014 an event expected by Jan. 10.\n\nRelated: US lawmakers introduce bipartisan bill proposing ban on members investing in \u2018financial instruments\u2019\n\nThe disclosure filings came roughly nine days before the U.S. government is set to shut down should Congress fail to pass a spending bill before Jan. 19. Previous shutdowns have created ripples across markets, including cryptocurrencies, partly due to economic uncertainty.\n\nRepublican Party candidates for the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election will face off in Iowa on Jan. 10 for the first debate of the election season.

        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation\u2019s Research Team recently had a Reddit AMA where Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, proposed changing the network\u2019s gas limit.\n\nCiting the greatest period of stagnancy in Ethereum\u2019s history\u2014nearly three years\u2014Buterin suggested a 33% increase in the gas limit, possibly reaching 40 million. Let\u2019s discover more about this important news.\n\nVitalik Buterin Advocates Gas Limit Modifications in Ethereum\n\nThis change attempts to increase the network\u2019s throughput capacity, as opposed to the existing 30 million limit per Etherscan.\n\nShortly after Ethereum\u2019s genesis in 2015, the average gas limit was approximately 3 million. This limit has grown over time in pace with adoption and network usage. According to Etherscan, the average gas price is currently 35 gwei, or $1.89. However, there has been a price increase since the new year for complicated smart contract operations.\n\n\ud83d\udea8BREAKING \ud83d\udea8 VITALIK BUTERIN URGES FOR AN INCREASE IN ETHEREUM GAS LIMIT AFTER NEARLY THREE YEARS. pic.twitter.com/BpuxvqdWsV \u2014 Bullion (@Bullionclb) January 11, 2024\n\nThis proposed modification has significant effects on Ethereum\u2019s performance. It goes beyond being a numerical tweak. For a start, the gas limit is an essential component of Ethereum\u2019s architecture. It sets the maximum amount of gas that can be used to execute transactions or smart contracts on a block.\n\nEthereum requires gas fees for transactions or executing contracts on the chain. One of the benefits of the gas limit is that it prevents excessively large blocks. This can affect network synchronization and performance.\n\nSlightly higher hardware requirements and increased block processing time pic.twitter.com/i0W9SYNdGj \u2014 cygaar (@0xCygaar) January 10, 2024\n\nAnother core benefit of increasing the gas limit is that it would allow more transactions into each block. Thus, it increases the network\u2019s capacity and throughput. But it also raises the possibility of network spam and attacks, as well as increasing the hardware load.\n\nIt is safe to say that Buterin\u2019s proposal is a dilemma between boosting transactional capacity and sustaining network stability.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information discussed by Altcoin Buzz is not financial advice.

        "content": "Valkyrie CIO Says Market May See Ripple, Ethereum ETFs Next\n\nValkyrie Funds Chief Investment Officer Steven McClurg says it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if a Ripple and Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) came to the market speaking in an interview with Bloomberg TV.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we saw Ripple or Ethereum spot ETFs out there,\u201d said McClurg. The CIO went on to add that Grayscale recently added XRP to their publicly traded which in turn shows that there is interest.\n\nMcClurg believes that the US Securities and Exchange Commission will approve spot Bitcoin ETFs on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe SEC will deem the ETFs effective at close of business Wednesday and the trading to begin on Thursday morning,\u201d McClurg said in an interview.\n\nDozen Applications in Pipeline\n\nSo far, there are nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin ETF hopefuls who are significantly dropping their management fees in hopes of beating out their competitors, yet another sign of imminent approval.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart, Fidelity lowered their fees to 0.25% from the previous 0.39% and has offered a fee waiver to 0% through July 31.\n\nIncluding Fidelity, 5 out of the 11 issuers have revised their fee structures or offered temporary waivers after they received feedback from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Jan. 8.\n\nWith the previously lowest fee of 0.24% offered already, Bitwise reduced it to 0.20% with a waiver to 0% for 6 months or 1 billion; Wisdomtree lowered its fee of 0.50% to 0.30% also with a waiver to 0% for 6 months or 1 billion.\n\nSEC\u2019s X Account Hacked\n\n\n\nEarlier today, when the SEC\u2019s X account shared a false tweet suggesting the approval of spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF in the US. The excitement in the crypto community was short-lived as Chair Gary Gensler quickly revealed that the SEC\u2019s X account had been compromised, and the tweet was unauthorized.\n\nFollowing the false SEC announcement, the cryptocurrency market was marked by heightened sensitivity to regulatory actions, Bitcoin\u2019s price experienced a notable dip to $46,000, reflecting nearly 1.50% decrease on Wednesday."

        "content": "A fake approval post from the SEC regarding a Spot Bitcoin ETF sent shockwaves through the crypto market, impacting both Bitcoin and Ethereum Open Interest (OI). In addition, this incident triggered a volatile day for Bitcoin prices, which in turn led to a significant drop in Bitcoin Futures Open Interest (OI).\n\nHowever, amid a slip in Bitcoin OI, the Ethereum Futures Open Interest witnessed an unprecedented surge, indicating a shift in market sentiment.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum OI Soars As BTC Faces Backlash Amid Fake ETF Approval Drama\n\nThe SEC found itself embroiled in controversy after an unauthorized post on its official X handle falsely claimed approval for a Spot Bitcoin ETF. This misinformation sparked enthusiasm among crypto enthusiasts, only to be quelled when SEC Chair Gary Gensler clarified that no such approval had been granted, revealing a compromised official handle.\n\nMeanwhile, as a consequence, the crypto community expressed strong dissatisfaction, accusing the U.S. SEC of market manipulation. Notably, according to CoinGlass data, Bitcoin Futures Open Interest plummeted by 3.29% over the last 24 hours to 431.76K BTC or $19.69 billion, reflecting the impact of the misleading information on investor confidence.\n\nIn contrast, while Bitcoin faced a downturn, Ethereum emerged as a resilient player in the market. Ethereum Futures Open Interest witnessed an impressive surge of 12.08% over the past 24 hours, reaching 3.33 million ETH or $8.05 billion. This surge was mirrored on various platforms, with Binance recording a 10.39% increase and Bybit experiencing a remarkable 16.07% jump in Ethereum OI.\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock and ARK 21Shares Slash Bitcoin ETF Fees In New S-1 Filings\n\nPrice Changes Amid Market Turbulence\n\nThe crypto market was down on Wednesday, which several experts attributed to the recent SEC chaos. Meanwhile, as of writing, the global crypto market cap was down 1.14% to $1.71 trillion, while the trading volume ticked up 2.81% to $83.95 billion.\n\nNotably, the Bitcoin price was down 3.74% to $44,915.91 during writing, after hitting a high of $47,898.70 in the last 24 hours. On the other hand, the Ethereum price noted gains of 3.17% over the last 24 hours and traded at $2,371.42. Notably, the ETH has touched a high of $2,410.96 today.\n\nMeanwhile, this contrasting performance between Bitcoin and Ethereum indicates a dynamic shift in investor sentiment. As Bitcoin grapples with the aftermath of the fake spot Bitcoin ETF approval saga, Ethereum appears to be gaining momentum, attracting renewed interest and investment within the crypto space.\n\nAlso Read: Binance Delists BTC, ETH, BNB, LTC, FLOKI Spot Trading Pairs"

And it might not just be good for Bitcoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nExperts now believe the SEC\u2019s acquiescence could have opened the door to the approval of other crypto-backed spot ETFs, namely a spot Ethereum ETF. And thanks to the precedent set by a Bitcoin ETF, that financial product could enter the market in a matter of months, not years.\n\nEric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, says he is 70% confident that a spot ETH ETF will be approved by May.\n\nHow could that be, when it took Bitcoin years to accomplish the same feat? Further, hasn\u2019t the SEC repeatedly signaled that it is far more skeptical of Ethereum than of Bitcoin?\n\nDuring an appearance on Rug Radio\u2019s FOMO Hour late last week, Balchunas said it all comes down to legal strategy. After the SEC approved a Bitcoin futures ETF in 2021, Grayscale sued the federal regulator, arguing it couldn\u2019t arbitrarily approve a BTC futures ETF and reject a spot BTC ETF at the same time.\n\nFutures ETFs track the price of derivatives contracts, which themselves grant the buyer the ability to buy or sell Bitcoin at a later date. No Bitcoin is actually bought and sold when futures ETFs are bought and sold. Spot ETFs are different, and their issuers\u2014BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and many more\u2014do actually buy and store Bitcoin on behalf of their clients.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen it comes to how they should be treated by the SEC, Grayscale argued in court that it shouldn\u2019t make a difference\u2014and won. Shortly thereafter, backed into a corner, the SEC changed its tune on spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe SEC now appears to be in a similar situation with Ethereum, Balchunas believes, given that the agency approved its first Ethereum futures ETFs in October.\n\n\u201cIpso facto, you have to approve an Ether spot [ETF], or you\u2019re going to get sued again for the same exact reason,\u201d the analyst explained during a Rug Radio appearance late last week.\n\nOther analysts share that optimism. In a report released earlier this week, British multinational bank Standard Chartered predicted that a spot Ethereum ETF is likely to gain approval by Q2 of this year.\n\nJames Butterfill, head of research at digital asset investment firm CoinShares, concurs.\n\n\u201cGiven that the SEC has treated both BTC and ETH in a very similar way, it is highly likely [that approval comes] Q2 this year,\u201d he told Decrypt.\n\nBolstering that confidence is the stature of the applicants who\u2019ve already lined up to list a spot ETH ETF. In November, Wall Street behemoth BlackRock threw its weight behind a spot ETH ETF application; the asset manager\u2019s entrance to the spot Bitcoin ETF race last summer was widely considered a major boon for the financial product\u2019s prospects.\n\n\u201cThese are not\u2026 minor companies,\u201d Adam Berker, senior legal counsel at global payments platform Mercuryo, told Decrypt. \u201cThese requests originate from high-profile entities like BlackRock and Grayscale, both of which have considerable influence and a robust operational history.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOthers still in the crypto industry, however, feel that a spot Ethereum ETF isn't quite said and done\u2014yet. William Quigley, co-founder of stablecoin Tether, believes the inescapable differences between smart contract-less Bitcoin, and the complex, multilayer Ethereum ecosystem could easily have an impact on proceedings.\n\n\u201cTiming for an Ethereum ETF is hard to predict since it is a more complex technology platform than the Bitcoin blockchain, and therefore presents more potential risks from the SEC\u2019s perspective,\u201d Quigley told Decrypt.\n\nThat vast technical contrast between Bitcoin and Ethereum cuts both ways, though. Whenever a spot Ethereum ETF is eventually approved, Quigley believes, the product will prove immensely attractive to Wall Street investors eager to get a piece of the vast and incredibly active Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIf Bitcoin is a lemonade stand, then Ethereum is a money center bank,\u201d said Quigley. \u201cEthereum is more complex, has far more activity from its tens of thousands of active smart contracts and the layer 2 blockchains using it\u2014and [Ethereum-based] tokens dominate the token trading ecosystem,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat does that mean for Wall Street\u2019s appetite for an Ethereum ETF? \u201cIt's easy to see that institutional demand will be strong,\u201d Quigley said."

The cryptocurrency has grown from a 24-hour low of $2,353.93 to its price at the moment, driven in part by the hype ravaging the market following the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThis approval is boosting sentiment that the spot Ethereum ETF might also be on the way. This has further pushed retail sentiment as well, with Ethereum now notably eyeing the $2,700 benchmark."

        "title": "Experts set a date for Ethereum to reach $10k, are you ready? - Crypto Reporter",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has long been a favourite among crypto enthusiasts and investors. Over the years, ETH has seen significant price appreciation, but the question on everyone\u2019s mind is, can it reach $10,000?\n\nAccording to crypto analyst and author Chris Burniske, the answer is a resounding \u201cyes,\u201d and he\u2019s not alone in his optimism. In this article, we\u2019ll delve into the journey Ethereum has taken so far and explore the factors that could propel it to the coveted $10,000 mark. Additionally, we\u2019ll introduce a promising token, Retik Finance (RETIK), as a project to watch in the evolving crypto landscape.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Remarkable Ascent\n\nEthereum, often referred to as the \u201cking of smart contracts,\u201d has had a remarkable journey since its inception. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as digital gold and a store of value, Ethereum\u2019s blockchain platform is designed to support decentralised applications (DApps) and smart contracts. This fundamental difference has opened up a world of possibilities and applications, making ETH an indispensable part of the crypto ecosystem. Ethereum\u2019s price history tells a compelling story of growth and adoption. It began trading at just a few cents when it launched in 2015, and by 2017, it had breached the $1,000 mark. The subsequent years saw its price surge to new heights, with ETH reaching an all-time high of over $4,800 in November 2021. This impressive price trajectory underscores Ethereum\u2019s significance and potential in the world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nChris Burniske\u2019s Bold Prediction\n\nChris Burniske, a respected crypto analyst and author, shared his thoughts sometimes back on Ethereum\u2019s future in a Twitter post. He expressed his astonishment at the persistent scepticism surrounding ETH\u2019s potential, despite its consistent price appreciation. Burniske boldly stated, \u201cFor the haters that have been negative on ETH at $1, $10, $100, and $1,000, but refuse to let data change their view, see ya at ETH $10,000.\u201d While Burniske doesn\u2019t anticipate Ethereum reaching this milestone in the next few months, he firmly believes that it\u2019s only a matter of time before it happens. He set his sights on the year 2025 as the timeframe for Ethereum to hit $10,000, a prediction that has garnered significant attention and sparked optimism among ETH supporters.\n\nCommunity Consensus\n\nBurniske\u2019s prediction resonated with many members of the crypto community, and their responses to his post indicate widespread agreement. Some Ethereum enthusiasts even go a step further, suggesting that ETH could reach $10,000 as soon as 2024. The sentiment among believers is that Ethereum\u2019s fundamental value proposition, combined with its growing adoption and use cases, makes a five-figure price tag entirely plausible in the coming years.\n\nFactors Fueling Ethereum\u2019s Growth\n\nSeveral key factors contribute to the bullish outlook for Ethereum and its potential journey to $10,000:\n\nSmart Contracts and DApps: Ethereum\u2019s smart contract capabilities are at the heart of its appeal. The platform enables developers to create decentralised applications, opening up a wide range of use cases in finance, gaming, NFTs, and more. As the DApp ecosystem continues to expand, demand for ETH to power transactions and interact with these applications will likely grow.\n\nEthereum Upgrade: The Ethereum Cancun upgrade, which is expected to happen in Q1 of 2024, will increase the scalability, security, and efficiency of the Ethereum network, optimising operation and reducing gas fees through a process known as proto-danksharding.\n\nDeFi and NFTs: The decentralised finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) sectors have exploded in recent years, with Ethereum serving as the primary platform for these innovations. The growing popularity of DeFi protocols and NFT marketplaces drives demand for ETH as the preferred choice for transactions and collateral.\n\nInstitutional Adoption: Ethereum has attracted the attention of institutional investors, with major financial institutions and corporations exploring its potential. Institutional investment can bring significant liquidity and credibility to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n>>>> Click Here To Buy RETIK Tokens <<<<\n\nRetik Finance: A Promising Token to Watch\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s journey to $10,000 is on the horizon, the crypto landscape is continually evolving, with new projects emerging to address various needs and challenges. One such project that has been gaining traction is Retik Finance (RETIK). As we look ahead to Ethereum\u2019s potential growth, it\u2019s essential to keep an eye on promising tokens like RETIK. Retik Finance is a decentralised finance (DeFi) project that aims to redefine the DeFi space by introducing innovative utilities that bridge the gap between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies. Its ecosystem includes features like the Retik Wallet, Retik DeFi Debit Card, and Retik Pay, all designed to simplify financial transactions and promote accessibility to DeFi for users of all backgrounds. The project\u2019s presale stages have been a resounding success, raising over $6.7 million from the sale of over 134 million tokens. With experts predicting gains of up to 20,000%, Retik Finance is poised to make a significant impact in the crypto world.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we embark on the journey into 2024 and beyond, Ethereum\u2019s path to $10,000 remains an exciting narrative in the crypto space. Chris Burniske\u2019s bold prediction, combined with the strong fundamentals and growing adoption of Ethereum, instils confidence in its potential to reach this milestone. While Ethereum takes center stage, it\u2019s crucial to keep an eye on promising projects like Retik Finance (RETIK), which are innovating and offering solutions to the evolving needs of the crypto community. As Ethereum\u2019s journey unfolds, it\u2019s clear that the crypto landscape holds immense opportunities for those who dare to dream and believe in the transformative power of blockchain technology.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance Presale\n\nVisit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):\n\nWebsite: https://retik.com\n\nWhitepaper: https://retik.com/retik-whitepaper.pdf\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/retikfinance\n\nDisclaimer: The statements, views and opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the content provider and do not necessarily represent those of Crypto Reporter.
