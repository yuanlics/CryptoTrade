        "title": "'Ethereum Fails' Without These 3 Changes, Says Vitalik Buterin - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIf Ethereum is to expand how it's used, it will need to undergo three major transitions or risk undermining its own future, said Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nIn a blog post published on Friday, Buterin laid out his ideas for what it will take to help Ethereum mature if it is to expand in use. Calling them \u201cThe Three Transitions,\u201d Buterin said they would need to evolve around transitions in layer-2, or \u201cL2,\u201d scaling solutions, a move to smart contract wallets, and greater privacy for fund transfers.\n\nButerin\u2019s proposals bump into what has been called the \"blockchain trilemma.\" A blockchain's most important traits are being decentralized, secure, and scalable, but it can only usually achieve two of these three.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo overcome this, Buterin said that it is acknowledged that these transitions would be challenging to coordinate, but said they were needed for Ethereum to survive.\n\nOf the three, Buterin singled out a need to expand use of L2 solutions called \u201crollups\u201d as an important part of this transition. An ordinary L2 function processes transactions off of the main Ethereum blockchain, or the L1.\n\nA rollup is a scaling solution that bundles these transactions and then validates a proof of them as a much smaller piece of data on the mainnet to keep it from getting too clogged. As a result, the cost of an Ethereum transaction can be lower.\n\n\"Layer 2s are critical to the success of Ethereum\u2019s vision of the world computer. Without L2s, Ethereum won\u2019t scale,\" CEO of OP Labs and co-founder of Ethereum scaler Optimism Karl Floersch told Decrypt. \"Without scale, Ethereum will never be able to support the world\u2019s compute demand, and until the world\u2019s compute is fully supported, we can\u2019t fully realize Ethereum\u2019s vision.\"\n\nCritically, said Buterin, the version of Ethereum that does not address the move to rollups \"fails,\" adding that transaction costs would only surge in the face of a bull run and encourage more centralization on its blockchain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"The solution isn't simply 'move users off of mainnet.' Rather, the solution lies in extending the capabilities of the Ethereum network,\" Floersch said. \"This means that instead of thinking about it as a migration from mainnet, we can think about it as load balancing the demand for Ethereum mainnet with other highly secure OP chains.\"\n\nBringing Ethereum from the edge\n\nEli Ben-Sasson, co-founder of the Israeli-based company StarkWare behind layer-2 scaling solutions StarkEx and StarkNet, said Buterin was \u201cright\u201d in his diagnosis of what it would take to see an expanded Ethereum.\n\nHe said his company was already using the smart contract wallets as part of its StarkNet, and believes more of this type of scaling is \u201cover the horizon.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving the leadership from Vitalik which both appreciates the excitement of this moment and urges the community to get on board is a big part of what will propel Ethereum\u2019s success,\u201d Ben-Sasson told Decrypt.\n\nButerin said the move to smart contract wallets has some \"technical issues\" to work through but is \"not a large burden\" to address.\n\nWith a smart contract, contracts automatically execute their terms when predefined conditions are met, and Buterin said they would make some processes easier like covering transactions for non-ETH tokens.\n\nOf the three transitions, Buterin expressed concern that meeting privacy concerns would be among the bigger challenges. He said that without enough data privacy measures in place, users concerned about this will stay away from Ethereum.\n\n\u201cWithout [privacy], Ethereum fails because having all transactions available publicly for literally anyone to see is far too high a privacy sacrifice for many users,\" said Buterin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo address this, Buterin suggested using \"stealth address\" to help protect user identities, but these methods are still maturing because of issues around cost and functionality."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Analysis: Today on June 10th, the crypto market witnessed a massive liquidation amid the US SEC lawsuit against big crypto exchanges Binance(BNB) and Coinbase(COIN). As a result, the market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum tumbled 2.5% and 6.5% on intraday levels respectively. Amid this downfall, the ETH price lost crucial monthly support of $1775-$1765 indicating the coin holders could experience an extended correction.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Co-Founder Names Three Key Transitions to Watch as Network Grows\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Daily Chart\n\nA bearish breakdown below the $1765 support sets the ETH price on a 5.5% loss\n\nThe long-term trend for Ethereum stays bullish as long as the support trendline is intact;\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $4.6 Billion, indicating a 0.27% loss.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nToday, the Ethereum price showcased a high momentum breakdown from the $1775-$1765 support level. Losing this last swing low support hints the ETH price may prolong the ongoing correction phase.\n\nIf the daily candle closes below the $1765 support the selling pressure will accelerate and offer trades the opportunity to short sell. With sustained selling the coin price will tumble 5.5% to hit the long-coming support trendline.\n\nPreviously, a retest to this support trendline triggered a significant recovery in the ETH price, validating this level as a crucial accumulation zone. Therefore, potential traders must mark this dynamic support if looking for a dip opportunity.\n\nWill Ethereum Price Reach $1700?\n\nThe intense sell-off today backed by high volume indicates the sellers have a strong conviction to take the Ethereum price lower. With the breakdown of $1775-$1765 support, the coin price will more likely plunge to the next significant support of $1700, followed by the combined support of $1650 and ascending trendline.\n\nAverage Directional Index: The uptick in the daily ADX slope assures sufficient strength in sellers to carry further downfall.\n\nBollinger Band: A downtick in the lower band of the BB indicator accentuates high momentum selling in the market."

        "content": "Ethereum developer proposed final changes to add to the Cancun upgrade.\n\nETH\u2019s price soared alongside its velocity.\n\nThe new Cancun update that is supposed to be launching on Ethereum [ETH] has been a huge subject of discussion for developers over the last few months. Recently, in the \u201cAll Core Developers Consensus Call\u201d, many details of the update were finalized.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nDevelopers come to an agreement\n\nThe main topic of discussion was about blobs. Blobs are chunks of data that can be added to the Ethereum blockchain. An Ethereum developer named Dankrad Feist conducted an experiment to test how well the Ethereum network can handle large blocks with additional data.\n\nFeist found that the Ethereum network successfully processed blocks with 128 kB to 1 MB of extra data without causing any problems. He tested factors like bandwidth usage, block speed, and missed attestations. Everything remained stable regardless of block size.\n\nHowever, there was one instance where a block carrying 1 MB of additional data caused a temporary reorganization of the blockchain.\n\nBased on the experiment, Feist suggested making some changes. He recommended increasing the maximum number of blobs per block from 4 to 6, as specified in EIP 4844. He also suggested reevaluating the deadline for receiving blocks within a certain time frame.\n\nNext, the participants discussed making modifications to EIP-4788. This EIP allows the Beacon block root to be visible in the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). The suggestion was to restrict the quantity of block roots stored on the EL (Execution Layer) to control the growth of the blockchain\u2019s state.\n\nThough implementing this change would require EL clients to perform additional disk writes, everyone in the discussion agreed that it was a necessary adjustment.\n\nThe team made plans to launch a new testnet called Holesky, which will serve as an alternative platform for implementing changes to the beacon chain. The main goal of Holesky is to run a larger number of validators compared to the mainnet. This will enable them to perform stress tests and evaluate any modifications related to the Beacon chain.\n\nState of ETH\n\nThese developments could have a positive impact on the price of ETH in the future. At press time, ETH was trading at $1,845.16 according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nIts price grew over the last few days, along with its velocity. This indicated that the number of ETH transfers were increasing. However, the MVRV ratio for ETH grew in tandem with its price. The growing MVRV ratio implied that ETH was slightly in the overbought zone at the time of writing."

        "content": "The final weeks of 2022 were characterized by volatility and uncertainty in the crypto market. According to forecasts, the first quarter of 2023 was expected to be weak, potentially leading to further losses. However, contrary to expectations, the first three months of 2023 saw crypto assets recover.\n\nDuring this period, bitcoin dominated, surpassing the $22,000 resistance level in January and recording a 36% increase. However, it is essential to note that Bitcoin still faces notable challenges that require attention. Despite initial expectations, Bitcoin has yet to transform into a widespread global payment system as anticipated.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has merits, alternatives like Ethereum and DigiToads are worth considering.\n\nEthereum, renowned for its smart contract capabilities and diverse ecosystem, has experienced an upward trajectory this year. For investors contemplating how to enter the crypto market, Ethereum can present an enticing option due to its distinct features and potential.\n\nOn the other hand, DigiToads, a meme coin project with utility, has disrupted the world of digital collectibles with immersive gaming experiences. For individuals interested in purchasing altcoins that offer the possibility of significant upsides, DigiToads can be an alternative worth considering.\n\nInvestors can explore how they can maximize returns by examining alternatives that Ethereum and DigiToads may offer. As they analyze, investors take account of these projects\u2019 attributes and potential.\n\nDigiToads has a mechanism for collecting crypto\n\nDigiToads, despite being categorized as a meme coin, presents a framework for investors seeking passive income opportunities. This decentralized finance (DeFi) cryptocurrency has been designed as a web3 game but incorporates various earning mechanisms for traders and investors.\n\nYou might also like: Unpacking the growing appeal of meme coins: analyzing DigiToads and Shiba Inu\n\nIn DigiToads, users can accumulate tokens by actively participating in the platform\u2019s game. Players raise and improve DigiToads characters, participate in battles, and earn TOADS tokens through an exchange. Investors do not need to actively collect cryptocurrency at the end of each season. Regardless of their performance in the game, 10% of the collected funds are airdropped to token holders.\n\nFurthermore, a staking mechanism is available to generate passive income. Participants must purchase and stake non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to receive rewards.\n\nThe DigiToads token is also deflationary. Long-term investors may find it appealing that the system incorporates built-in token-burning mechanisms. As the supply decreases, the value of the tokens could increase.\n\nInvestors and gamers are supporting the project. DigiToads has already raised over $4.7 million in its ongoing presale, with the token price rising from $0.01 to $0.036. However, it is essential to note that any investment decision should be made after careful analysis, considering one\u2019s financial circumstances and risk tolerance.\n\n>> Buy DigiToads now <<\n\nEthereum powers dapps\n\nETH, the native token of Ethereum, a blockchain platform, may recover and rally in 2023. As a decentralized blockchain network, Ethereum facilitates the creation of diverse decentralized applications (dapps). Transactions within the Ethereum network are settled in ETH.\n\nEthereum\u2019s implementation of smart contracts within its DeFi platforms has established a secure, decentralized, and transparent environment for agreements and transactions.\n\nThe platform\u2019s robust smart contract capabilities and extensive ecosystem have attracted considerable attention from investors. Its sustained growth and adoption in various sectors, including decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), position ethereum as an option for long-term investors.\n\nWith a current market capitalization of $152 billion, Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency. It has long been regarded as a pioneer in the blockchain space and an asset investors can explore.\n\nAs more projects and applications are developed on the Ethereum platform, the demand for ETH could rise, supporting prices.\n\nIt is important to note that investing in cryptocurrencies involves inherent risks, and individuals should conduct thorough research and assessment of their financial circumstances before making any investment decisions.\n\n>> Buy DigiToads now <<\n\nBottom line\n\nInvestors are now choosing projects that have long-term potential and real-world utility. If you\u2019re looking for altcoins to buy for long-term investment or wondering how to get into cryptocurrency, exploring alternatives such as Ethereum and DigiToads can yield significant returns.\n\nEthereum and DigiToads offer unique value propositions within the crypto market, like smart contracts, decentralized applications, NFTs, and gaming.\n\nInvestors are examining DigiToads due to its NFTs, play-to-earn (P2E) gaming approach, and community-focused initiatives. The platform also has utility, which may attract investors who can add TOADS to their portfolios.\n\nFor more information on DigiToads, visit the website, join the presale, or join the community for regular updates.\n\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

        "content": "What Is ERC721-C?\n\nEthereum Request for Comment 721-C (ERC721-C) is an augmentation of the ERC721 non-fungible token (NFT) standard on Ethereum. It aims to give NFT creators increased control and customizability over their NFT collections and how royalties are treated for them.\n\nERC721-C is opt-in. If a new or existing NFT collection decides to implement it, individual NFT holders can decide whether or not to adopt it. Details on how the opt-in process works can be found here.\n\nHow To Buy ERC721-C Tokens?\n\nLimit Break, the organization spearheading ERC721-C development, has whitelisted the addresses of several NFT marketplaces (e.g., OpenSea, X2Y2, Rarible), which could theoretically support ERC721-C tokens.\n\nOther marketplaces whose addresses have also been whitelisted can be found here. The curated whitelist is maintained solely by Limit Break and is controlled by a company multi-sig wallet.\n\nAccording to Limit Break, NFT marketplaces will need to explicitly integrate the new token standard in order for the new royalty features to go live. So, while ERC721-C tokens are currently supported on certain NFT marketplaces, it will likely be some time before new royalty capabilities are added.\n\nThe Limit Break team has stated that if top marketplaces do not support the new token standard, it will launch its own NFT marketplace that does.\n\nloading 1658115962258829316\n\nWhat Blockchains Support ERC721-C Tokens?\n\nLimit Break\u2019s official \u201cCreator Token Transfer\u201d library, which houses all documentation, is currently live on Ethereum and Polygon. It is also supported on Ethereum\u2019s Sepolia Testnet and Polygon\u2019s Mumbai Testnet.\n\nWhat Are NFT Royalties?\n\nNFT Royalties are fees paid by NFT purchases to creators when subsequent trades (i.e., all trades of NFTs after they are minted) of NFTs occur. In other words, royalties allow NFT creators to generate recurring revenue following their launch of an NFT collection. The more valuable an NFT creator\u2019s collection becomes and the more the collection is traded, the more royalty revenue the creator generates.\n\nIn their current state under ERC721, royalties are not fully enforceable on-chain for Ethereum NFTs. Accordingly, NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea and Blur wield significant influence over enforcing royalty payments.\n\nAn Example\n\nFor example, while NFT creators can request different levels of royalties, Blur currently only enforces a 0.5% minimum creator royalty on its platform. These low royalties encourage trading activity on the platform by driving down costs for users.\n\nHowever, these low royalties are detrimental to NFT creators as they reduce their earnings and could be a net-negative for the NFT ecosystem as they reduce incentives for creators to remain engaged in their projects over the long term.\n\nBlur is also using its control over royalties on its platform to compete with rival NFT marketplace OpenSea. So long as NFT creators on Blur block the trading of their NFT collections on OpenSea, they will receive any royalty fee they request \u2013 not just the 0.5% minimum.\n\nWhat Are Programmable Royalties?\n\nWith ERC721-C, royalty logic can be directly incorporated into Ethereum smart contract code. This gives NFT creators direct control over royalty settings and could reduce the influence that marketplaces currently wield over them.\n\nExamples of how NFT creators can experiment with the programmability of ERC721-C include:\n\nShared Royalties: Rather than NFT creators earning all NFT royalties, they could be split between NFT creators and holders to reward early adopters.\n\nRather than NFT creators earning all NFT royalties, they could be split between NFT creators and holders to reward early adopters. Minter-Only Royalties: NFT minters could be the sole earners of royalties \u2013 not creators.\n\nNFT minters could be the sole earners of royalties \u2013 not creators. Contingent Royalties : Different criteria could be applied to determine whether or not royalties would be paid out on certain NFT trades. For example, one could configure an ERC721-C contract such that royalties would only be paid out on trades where the secondary sale price is higher than the original mint price.\n\n: Different criteria could be applied to determine whether or not royalties would be paid out on certain NFT trades. For example, one could configure an ERC721-C contract such that royalties would only be paid out on trades where the secondary sale price is higher than the original mint price. Transferrable Royalties: NFT creators could issue their holders a separate NFT, which grants holders the rights to royalty income. For example, when one mints \u201cNFT X,\u201d they would also be issued \u201cNFT Y,\u201d which is entitled to all of the royalties generated by \u201cNFT X.\u201d\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow Is ERC721 Different From ERC721-C? With ERC721 NFTs, creator royalties exist as a \u201csocial contract\u201d rather than being enforceable on-chain. With ERC721-C, creators will have increased control over their NFT design and can make royalties enforceable on-chain. Who Created ERC721-C? Limit Break, a free-to-play gaming development studio, introduced the concept of Creator Tokens in January 2021. Version 1.1 of the ERC721-C standard, which operationalized many of the concepts of Creator Tokens, went live in May 2023.\n\nData Analyst Andrew Cahill Andrew previously was a Research Director at The Block; a crypto media and research company.

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum price remains unfazed by US SEC lawsuits - The Siasat Daily",
        "content": "New Delhi: The lawsuits against top crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have not been able to severely impact the price of Bitcoin which is the largest cryptocurrency, and other digital coins.\n\nBitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, hovered around $26,500 per digital coin this week as investors remained largely unstirred by the SEC lawsuits.\n\nThe leading cryptocurrency took an initial dive below $26,000 on Tuesday but held steady above the threshold throughout the week, with analysts suggesting that investors had already priced in the actions, according to Coindesk.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a tougher regulatory situation facing the digital asset industry in the United States than what\u2019s happening right now,\u201d Andrew Lawrence, co-founder and CEO of onchain custody platform Censo, was quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cIt can feel pretty bleak, and yet there\u2019s been a tremendous resilience shown by Bitcoin and other key crypto assets,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso Read World\u2019s first Bitcoin tower to come up in Dubai\n\nEthereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, held around $1,850, a bullish sign.\n\nThe digital tokens of Cardano, Solana and Polygon smart contracts protocols, were either flat or up slightly. Popular meme coins DOGE and SHIB were also in the green.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s market value was at $521.9 billion, while trade volume stood at $22.9 billion.\n\nAccording to industry experts, Bitcoin has actually been a beneficiary of the SEC\u2019s crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nBitcoin and Ether fell just 2 per cent and less than 1 per cent, respectively, over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nThe global crypto market cap decreased 2.7 per cent to $1.1 trillion.\n\nEthereum prices gained over 3.6 per cent to reach $225.71 billion in market cap and trading volume was $9.06 billion.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Coinbase came less than 24 hours after the Binance one. Both filings listed a handful of cryptocurrencies as securities, with 12 assets noted in the Binance suit and 13 in the Coinbase one, though the SEC said it was \u201cnot limited to\u201d those.\n\n\u201cEven through all this chaos, crypto markets weren\u2019t hugely altered by the SEC suits. In the initial 24 hours after the two lawsuits, the crypto market was green,\u201d according to TechCrunch.\n\nMeanwhile, Binance.US said it was transitioning to an all-crypto exchange as of June 13, citing pressures from the SEC.\n\n\u201cWhile we remain open to a productive compromise that enables a thriving digital asset marketplace in America, Binance.US will continue to vigorously defend ourselves, our customers and the industry against the meritless attacks of the SEC,\u201d the exchange said in a tweet.\n\nThe SEC has filed for a temporary restraining order to freeze certain assets tied to Binance.US.\n\nThe SEC also accused Binance of directing $12 billion to firms controlled by CEO Changpeng Zhao, a claim that Zhao and Binance both denied.\n\nThe SEC lawsuit alleged that behind the scenes, \u201cZhao and Binance were intimately involved in directing BAM Trading\u2019s US business operations and providing and maintaining the crypto asset services of the Binance.US Platform\u201d.\n\nIn a blog post, Binance said they are disappointed that the SEC \u201cchose to file a complaint against Binance seeking, among other remedies, purported emergency relief\u201d.\n\n\u201cFrom the start, we have actively cooperated with the SEC\u2019s investigations and have worked hard to answer their questions and address their concerns. But despite our efforts, with its complaint, the SEC abandoned that process and instead chose to act unilaterally and litigate. We are disheartened by that choice,\u201d said the crypto exchange.\n\nThe US Commodity Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC) in March sued Binance for allegedly breaking trading and derivatives rules."

        "title": "How Ethereum Could Smash US$2000 This Week: A Price Analysis - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency Ethereum could smash US$2000, as per the Ethereum price analysis.\n\nDue to its growth potential and distinctive qualities, including its smart contract capability and decentralized applications, Ethereum is a promising investment. In addition, a sizable and committed developer community is continually working to enhance the platform and broaden its use cases. Ethereum probably could smash US$2000 this week. On June 5, 2023, the price of Ethereum is US$1,904.93. Ethereum\u2019s price would have to rise by more than 5% to hit US$2000. Although it seems unlikely, this is conceivable.\n\nExperts foresee Ethereum could smash US$2000. Several elements impact Ethereum price analysis, which could lead to an ETH breakthrough above US$2,000 in the future. First, the Ethereum network is undergoing a big update known as Ethereum 2.0, which is anticipated to greatly enhance the network\u2019s scalability and security. Even though this update won\u2019t be finished until 2023, some early adopters are already staking their ETH tokens to support network security. The demand for ETH is anticipated to rise as more of it is staked, which could raise the price.\n\nSecond, the general cryptocurrency market is positive, with recent gains in Bitcoin (BTC) and other significant cryptocurrencies. This optimistic outlook may also apply to ETH, which would support price growth.\n\nAnd last, a breakout in ETH may be aided by the imminent Ethereum Merge. The Ethereum network has undergone a significant upgrade called The Merge, which will alter the way ETH is mined. The proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus method will replace the current proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism used to mine Ethereum (ETH). The Ethereum network is anticipated to become more secure and energy efficient as a result of this change. As a result, the Merge might draw in more investors, which might raise the price of ETH.\n\nHere are several important technical thresholds to look out for: The all-time high for ETH is US$2,000. A significant positive indication would be a breakout above this level. The 200-day moving average for ETH is US$2,100. The upswing would be confirmed, and potential gains may be made if there were a breakout above this level. The 50-day moving average for ETH is US$2,200. The Bulls would be in charge if there was a breakout above this level.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ethereum Co-Founder Names Three Key Transitions to Watch as Network Grows - CoinGape",
        "content": "As the Ethereum network continues to grow and evolve, its co-founder has identified three key transitions that are set to shape its future trajectory.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the visionary mind behind the world\u2019s second-largest crypto, recently outlined these transitions in a blog post, highlighting their significance in enhancing scalability, security, and privacy within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOne of the most pressing challenges for Ethereum has been its scalability. As the network gained popularity, the increased demand for transactions caused congestion and high fees, hindering its usability. To address this issue, Buterin points to the transition to Layer 2 scaling solutions as the first transition, specifically rollups.\n\nThe second transition pointed by Buterin is the wallet security transition, specifically smart contract wallets.\n\nBy adopting smart contract wallets, users can have greater confidence in the security of their assets. Without the second transition, Buterin highlighted that Ethereum fails because users are hesitant to save their funds (and non-financial assets), and everyone migrates to centralized exchanges. Buterin believes that social recovery wallets are important for greater security and user experience.\n\nAdditionally, the Ethereum co-founder also stressed the significance of privacy as the third transition. Buterin acknowledges the need for privacy-preserving features within the Ethereum network, specifically focusing on funds transfers and the development of related tools such as social recovery, identity, and reputation systems.\n\nTo enable privacy features for Ethereum users, Buterin suggested implementing stealth address methods.\n\nChallenges Involved with the Transitions\n\nAchieving scalability, security, and privacy improvements on Ethereum requires more than just protocol upgrades, according to Buterin.\n\nAs with any new project, Buterin highlighted some challenges that may be involved in these transitions. He highlighted that the successful implementation of these transitions requires coordination among various stakeholders in the Ethereum community, including developers, miners, users, and application builders.\n\nAccording to the Ethereum co-founder, Transitioning to these new solutions necessitates educating and encouraging users to adopt the changes. This is because users need to understand the importance of these transitions and feel confident in adopting them.\n\nBy recognizing the importance of coordination, facilitating changes in application design, and prioritizing user education and adoption, the Ethereum community can navigate these challenges and ensure the successful resolution of these transitions."

        "title": "What Is MEV? Examples & Risks - Milk Road",
        "content": "What Is MEV In Crypto?\n\nMaximum Extractable Value (MEV) refers to the incremental revenue that blockchain validators can earn by including, excluding, or reordering transactions before finalizing them.\n\nSimilar to transaction fees, MEV is a cost borne by users that transact on public blockchains. Given that many users are not aware of MEV, it\u2019s sometimes referred to as an \u201cinvisible tax.\u201d\n\nHow Much MEV Has Been Extracted?\n\nWhile the concept of MEV has been around since as early as 2014, it was not until 2020 that it really started being extracted.\n\nAs of May 2023, ~625K ETH of cumulative MEV has been extracted on Ethereum. At an ETH price of $1,850 that translates to ~$1.2B.\n\nApproximately 70% (440K ETH) of this MEV was extracted before \u201cThe Merge,\u201d which occurred in September 2022. The remaining 30% (180K ETH) has been extracted after \u201cThe Merge.\u201d\n\nOn certain days, Ethereum validators and block builders have earned more ETH through MEV than they have earned in transaction fee revenue.\n\nFor example, on March 11th, 2023, ~5,100 ETH (~$9.4M at $1,850 per ETH) worth of MEV was extracted on Ethereum. That same day only ~2,600 ETH (~$4.8M at $1,850 ETH) in revenue was generated by transaction fees.\n\nHow Can Users Protect Themselves From MEV?\n\nLet\u2019s call a spade a spade. MEV is not good for users. But it is not all doom and gloom.\n\nFirst off, users can protect themselves by using RPCS (e.g., Flashbots Protect RPC, MEV Blocker RPC), which will prevent trades from being front-run. For those familiar with the MetaMask wallet browser extension, setup is easy. Check out our article on how to use Flashbots for a full rundown.\n\nSecondly, Ethereum users can claw back some of this MEV that is (potentially) being extracted from them by staking their ETH. With the advent of liquid staking solutions, such as Lido, users can stake any amount of ETH and earn staking rewards. The majority of validators (including Lido) run Flashbots MEV-Boost software and re-distribute the MEV they earn to stakers.\n\nHow Do MEV Bots Make Money?\n\nMEV bots monitor the pending transaction queue to identify opportunities to generate MEV revenue. In instances where they successfully identify an opportunity, they are programmed to automatically submit transactions on behalf of their operators to capture MEV rewards.\n\nWhat Is An Example Of MEV?\n\nTop examples of MEV include sandwich attacks, decentralized exchange (DEX) arbitrage, and liquidation attacks:\n\nSandwich attacks: A block builder or validator spots a large buy (or sell) order for one asset. They then place their own order ahead of the large buy order and capitalize on the price appreciation that this large order causes.\n\nA block builder or validator spots a large buy (or sell) order for one asset. They then place their own order ahead of the large buy order and capitalize on the price appreciation that this large order causes. DEX arbitrage: A blockchain user runs software (i.e., deploys bots) to identify price differentials between the same asset on different DEXes. Once the software identifies material price differentials, it buys an asset on one DEX and sells it on another at a higher price (typically all within one single transaction).\n\nA blockchain user runs software (i.e., deploys bots) to identify price differentials between the same asset on different DEXes. Once the software identifies material price differentials, it buys an asset on one DEX and sells it on another at a higher price (typically all within one single transaction). Liquidations: Liquidations typically entail a transaction sender capitalizing on an oracle price update to be the first to liquidate a loan\u2019s collateral to earn a profit.\n\nAs displayed in the chart below, sandwich attacks have emerged as one of the leading sources of MEV.\n\nThe Sandwich Attack\n\nThe average Ethereum user can\u2019t see other users\u2019 pending transactions. But an Ethereum validator can. When it comes to MEV, this visibility is what allows validators to extract profit. They can spot large incoming buy (and sell) orders on DEXes and position themselves to profit at the expense of users.\n\nThe typical steps of a sandwich attack go something like this:\n\nBob is an Ethereum validator (or block builder). In the mempool, he spots a trade submitted by Alice to make a large swap of USDC for ETH on the Uniswap DEX. Bob copies Alice\u2019s trade and also submits an ETH buy order. But because Bob is a validator, he can place his buy order ahead of the order placed by Alice (who is not a validator and cannot see Bob\u2019s transactions and cannot order transactions). Bob\u2019s ETH buy gets filled first. Alice\u2019s ETH buy then gets filled and pushes up the market price of ETH. Bob then sells his ETH at the higher market price and pockets the difference.\n\nFrom the perspective of, Bob, that is a nice trade. Sure, there is a degree of risk involved with what he did \u2013 ETH\u2019s price could have actually declined for a number of reasons and eliminated his profit opportunity. But if Alice\u2019s order is sufficiently large, chances are that it will result in a price increase of ETH and a profitable trade for Bob.\n\nFrom the perspective of Alice, this is clearly a suboptimal outcome. Bob\u2019s initial ETH buy resulted in her trade being executed at a worse price. Had Bob not front-run her, she would have gotten more ETH in return for the same amount of USDC.\n\nBob\u2019s subsequent sale could also put sell pressure on ETH and could have decreased its price. Had Alice wanted to sell her ETH after she bought it, she would have gotten less USDC in return, as Bob\u2019s ETH sale pushed down the price of ETH.\n\nIf you are a Uniswap user and this is the first time you\u2019re hearing about this, sorry. You could very well have been sandwich attacked without even knowing about it. But as mentioned above, the Flashbots Protect RPC is a good alternative that offers protection against these types of attacks.\n\nOther Examples Of MEV Attacks\n\nWhile the sandwich attack, DEX arbitrage, and liquidation attacks are the most prominent examples of MEV extraction, it can be extracted through a variety of methods. Some of these include:\n\nBack-running occurs when a validator places their transaction to be finalized directly after another transaction. Back-running typically occurs in conjunction with token listings on DEXEs. For example, immediately after someone begins providing liquidity for an asset on a DEX, MEV bots would buy large quantities of said asset. The bot would then wait for the price to go up and sell the tokens at a higher price.\n\noccurs when a validator places their transaction to be finalized directly after another transaction.

For example, immediately after someone begins providing liquidity for an asset on a DEX, MEV bots would buy large quantities of said asset. The bot would then wait for the price to go up and sell the tokens at a higher price. Front running, which is sometimes referred to as \u201csniping,\u201d occurs when a validator detects a potentially profitable transaction(s) in the mempool. The validator then copies the user\u2019s transaction and pays a higher fee for their transaction to be executed first \u2013 thus stealing the victim\u2019s alpha and gains.\n\nwhich is sometimes referred to as \u201csniping,\u201d occurs when a validator detects a potentially profitable transaction(s) in the mempool.

If block rewards are small enough compared to MEV, it can be economically rational for validators to destabilize a network\u2019s consensus process and attempt to reverse previously finalized transactions to extract MEV. Uncle-bandit attacks refer to attacks in which validators notice transactions in rejected blocks (uncles) that are not confirmed and selectively bring one or few of them back into the main blockchain to profit from them.\n\nMEV And Network Congestion\n\nHave you ever seen a chart of Ethereum transaction fees and wondered, \u201cWhy would anyone pay $30+ for a single Ethereum transaction?\u201d\n\nMedian transaction fee on Ethereum\n\nSure, fear of missing out (FOMO) could be one cause of these high fees. When NFTs or meme coins are in a state of mania, one could (rightly or wrongly) justify paying $30, or even hundreds of dollars, to get their hands on them.\n\nBut knowing what we know about MEV, all signs point to MEV playing a big role in clogging up blockchain networks and increasing transaction fees for real users.\n\nTake the \u201cDEX Arbitrage\u201d example from before. Consider a situation where ETH is trading on one DEX at $1,750 and on another DEX at $1,850. Even if an MEV bot needs to pay $99 in transaction fees to capture this $100 spread, it would still be rational for the bot to pay the fees. After all, one dollar of risk-free profits is still one dollar \u2013 even if it costs $99 to generate it.\n\nOn-chain data confirms this suspicion. One of the most notorious \u201csandwich attacker\u201d MEV bots, jaredfromsubway.eth, has paid upwards of $30M in transaction fees to extract MEV on Ethereum.\n\nWhat Are The Risks Of MEV?\n\nWhile MEV has direct negative impacts on users, it also poses risks to blockchain network stability.\n\nIf the MEV available in a block significantly exceeds the standard block reward, validators may be incentivized to reorganize previously finalized blocks and capture the MEV for themselves. Blockchain re-organizations create network instability and could reduce users\u2019 confidence in interacting with the network.\n\nAdditionally, MEV has the potential to emerge as a major cause of centralization. Identifying and extracting MEV requires significant technical expertise and resources. Solo-stakers who are running their own validators are less equipped to extract MEV and could be incentivized to delegate their stake to validators with more expertise \u2013 thus centralizing control over the network.\n\nFinally, extracting MEV requires deploying new software, which could be subject to bugs and vulnerabilities. For example, ~90% of Ethereum blocks are currently sourced via the Flashbots MEV-Boost middleware. The system is dependent on a system of relays which could potentially go offline and cause network liveness failures.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat Is Miner Extractable Value? Miner extractable value is synonymous with maximum extractable value. Following Ethereum\u2019s merge, proof-of-work miners were replaced by proof-of-stake validators in Ethereum consensus. Hence, miner extractable value was deprecated as a term and replaced by maximum extractable value. What Is Flashbots? Flashbots is a research and development organization aimed at making the MEV market more efficient, distributed, and democratic. It is a for-profit company that provides Ethereum software products to users and infrastructure providers in the MEV ecosystem. Why Is MEV Bad? Certain types of MEV are bad because they increase the cost for real users to transact on blockchains. Extracting MEV can induce network congestion which increases the explicit costs for real users that want to transact on blockchains. Does MEV Exist In Bitcoin? Yes, some MEV does exist on Bitcoin. Historically, Bitcoin was primarily used for simple transactions (e.g., transferring BTC from one address to another). But new innovations such as Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens are expanding the use cases of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain and creating new opportunities for MEV extraction.\n\nData Analyst Andrew Cahill Andrew previously was a Research Director at The Block; a crypto media and research company.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSome detractors of NFTs fixate on their ethereal, intangible nature. How can they be art, critics cry, if they're only digital, virtual, disconnected from reality?\n\nIt would be difficult to levy those claims against the works of Foodmasku.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s the moniker of Antonius Wiriadjaja, the multimedia performance artist who\u2014for three years now\u2014has created NFTs depicting himself wearing masks made entirely of food, and then eating the masks. The ultimate consumption of the work is a rule, a key component.\n\nCourtesy: Foodmasku\n\nThe association between masks and food\u2014and between food masks and the blockchain for that matter\u2014is not necessarily intuitive. That may be because, for Wiriadjaja, those connections were the product of organic necessity.\n\nIn the earliest months of the pandemic, the artist recalls, he and a group of remote colleagues were navigating the still-bizarre realm of Zoom encounters. One fateful day, one of his friends became inadvertently trapped in a video filter that apparently turned their face into a pickle. The caller was embarrassed. Wiriadjaja\u2019s first impulse was to make them feel better.\n\n\u201cSo I took [a part of] my dinner, which was a piece of kale, put it on my face and said 'Hey, I have a filter on as well,\u2019\u201d Wiriadjaja told Decrypt at NFC Lisbon earlier this week.\n\nThe pickled participant was delighted, their shame washed away, and they asked Wiriadjaja what he was going to wear tomorrow. Foodmasku was born.\n\nCourtesy: Foodmasku\n\nIn the following weeks and months, Wiriadjaja dedicated himself to the mission of creating, documenting, and eating food masks. Banana eyes, broccoli nostrils, noodle noses, shrimp eyebrows... every day, a new sumptuous self-portrait.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe project steadily gained steam, but that success was a double-edged sword: people were so enamored with Wiriadjaja\u2019s food masks that phony Foodmasku accounts began popping up across numerous social media platforms.\n\nCourtesy: Foodmasku\n\nThis was March 2021, and Wiriadjaja was frustrated. There had to be a way to own digital files, to protect his edible oeuvre. He did some searching online and came across NFTs. The artist Beeple had just sold an NFT artwork for $69 million, catapulting the emerging technology into the mainstream.\n\nSo Foodmasku became a Web3 artist. Not out of an ideological or artistic commitment to the ethos of decentralization, but instead\u2014as with the inciting kale flap\u2014because it just made sense.\n\nTo date, Wiriadjaja has created almost 2,000 Foodmasku NFTs, generating about 50 ETH, or $92,000, in sales.\n\nCourtesy: Foodmasku\n\nThe artist, who was born in Indonesia and raised in Boston, has faced different reactions to his works across various cultures and contexts. A through-line, he\u2019s found, is that people across the world tend to be afraid of technology.\n\n\u201cTechnology is scary to everyone, everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cIndonesians are worried that technology\u2019s going to kill off their traditional arts, Americans are worried technology\u2019s going to take all of their jobs. But one thing everybody relates to is food.\u201d\n\nIf foods and masks and emergent digital technologies can be brought together to give Wiriadjaja\u2019s colorfully inventive and optimistic portraits a cohesive thesis, it might be that any medium possesses the capacity to tap into the universal vibrancy of humanity.\n\nCourtesy: Foodmasku\n\nIn that vein, Wiriadjaja has recently become fascinated with artificial intelligence. He\u2019s developing a project called \u201cProof of Eat,\u201d which is intended to clear the air on the increasing disquiet prompted by blurring of the line between humans and machines.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOne big test of whether a creator is human or not, is if they can eat food,\u201d he said."

        "title": "MillionaireGame (MG): The Next Big Meme Coin for Ethereum Whales? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The meme coin market, despite recent turbulence due to SEC litigation against Binance and Coinbase, continues to thrive, particularly on the Ethereum blockchain, untouched by the SEC\u2019s scrutiny. As crypto whales gear up for an enthusiastic June trading party, it\u2019s time to introduce the hottest meme coins of the month, with MillionaireGame (MG) stealing the spotlight.\n\nMillionaireGame (MG): A Party of Ethereum Millionaires\n\nMillionaireGame (MG), a community-driven millionaire-creating meme coin, is rapidly gaining popularity. The game rule is quite simple and appealing: a millionaire is \u201cminted\u201d from the token holders every month. By purchasing MillionaireGame (MG) tokens, anyone has a chance to strike it rich overnight. MG aims to launch its tokens on the Ethereum network. This ambitious plan is set to encourage existing Ethereum whales to further invest and multiply their fortunes, as well as create a fresh influx of Ethereum millionaires. As such, MG is positioning itself to be a pivotal player in a grand Ethereum party.\n\nMillionaireGame (MG) Pre-Sale: Stage Two Surge\n\nIn an astonishingly brief period following the initial presale, MillionaireGame (MG) is about to enter its second stage in an incredibly short time. According to the project team, this next phase is anticipated to see a significant price surge. With a projected market cap of 40M, Can MillionaireGame (MG) be the next 1000x meme coin?\n\nRelated Reading: Will MillionaireGame (MG) Surge 18% as Promised?\n\nPepe Coin (PEPE): What\u2019s Next for The First 1000x Coin of 2023\n\nAfter a remarkable rise, peaking at a market cap of $1.87 billion on May 5, 2023, Pepe Coin (PEPE) established itself as the first 1000x coin of the year. However, it has experienced a 15% nosedive in the last 7 days. This sudden decrease in price corresponds to a rise in volatility, with price swings of over 30% occurring in a single day. The key support level is currently at $0.0000010, and the resistance level is at $0.0000013. The bias for PEPE is bearish, and it\u2019s anticipated that the coin could make a significant move in the days ahead, with a possibility of a further decline if the key support level is breached.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB): Where Does It Stand?\n\nShiba Inu is currently the 17th largest cryptocurrency by overall valuation with a market cap of roughly $4.7 billion. However, SHIB has seen a significant downturn, down 91% from its lifetime high, and is on a downward spiral in Q2, 2023. It\u2019s currently trading at $0.00000869 and has been down for 10 consecutive days. Price prediction firm Changelly predicts that SHIB\u2019s price could hit a low of $0.000007627 by the end of June 2023, a downturn of nearly 14.1% from its current price. Therefore, investors are advised to be cautious about investing in SHIB in June\u200b.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE): What Did The Meme Coin Big Brother Say?\n\nDogecoin, renowned as the original meme coin, currently stands for $0.071166. Interestingly, the market\u2019s long-standing expectation of a potential price surge triggered by tweets from Elon Musk, a notable supporter of Dogecoin, has been left unfulfilled in this scenario. Despite the market turbulence, the \u2018Musk Effect\u2019, often associated with rapid price boosts, has not manifested, leaving Dogecoin to navigate the current market dynamics.\n\nMillionaireGame (MG) Presale Information: https://www.millionairegame.org/claim-discount\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The crypto market crashed on Saturday, with the global market cap dropping 6% to $1.04 trillion in the past 24 hours. The total liquidation comes in at $400 million over the last 24hrs as over 190,000 traders were liquidated. The largest single liquidation happened on the crypto exchange OKX, with ETH-USD-SWAP valued at $2.18 million.\n\nBitcoin price tumbles 4%, with major downfall coming within just 2 hours. BTC price fell to a 24-hour low of $25,500. Bitcoin currently trades near $25600, with a high probability of falling below the $25k level.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum price fell 6%, with the 24-hour low and high of $1765 and $1854. ETH price currently trades below $1750. The selling pressure continues to mount with increasing trading volumes.\n\nAltcoins such as Filecoin, Polygon, Cardano, Solana, Chiliz, Sandbox, Decentraland, Axie Infinity, and others fell more than 25%. Shiba Inu (SHIB) lead the crypto market crash, falling 30% in the last 24 hours. Some buying from the dip is also recorded.\n\nAlso Read: Binance To Temporarily Suspend All Crypto Margin And Earn Related Services\n\nReasons Behind the Crypto Market Crash\n\nMajor liquidations were recorded in the cryptocurrencies mentioned in the US SEC lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance. However, the massive liquidation came in response to Binance.US stopping USD fiat support on the exchange and Robinhood delisting Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC).\n\nUS SEC mentioned BNB, BUSD, SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, ATOM, SAND, MANA, ALGO, AXS, and COTI as securities in the Binance lawsuit. The agency listed SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, SAND, AXS, CHZ, FLOW, ICP, NEAR, VGX, DASH, and NEXO as securities in the Coinbase lawsuit.\n\nAccording to Coinglass, over $300 million in longs and $30 million in shorts were liquidated in the last 24 hours. The liquidations majorly happened on Binance, OKX, and Bybit, with BTC ($50M), ETH ($46M), ADA ($17M), SOL ($16M), LTC ($12M), DOGE ($11M), BNB (10M), FIL ($10M), and MATIC ($9M).\n\nGrayscale Investments has also filed a request with the US SEC seeking withdrawal of the Trust\u2019s Registration Statement on Form 10 for Grayscale Filecoin Trust. The SEC staff continues to view Filecoin (FIL) as security. However, Grayscale says it will continue to believe that FIL is not a security.\n\nMarket makers such as Jump Crypto and Cumberland have pulled all the liquidity from altcoins. Market makers were caught dumping major crypto to exchanges Binance and Coinbase. Binance.US partners are reluctant to work with the exchange, causing a major selloff across the market.\n\nMoreover, over 4 trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens worth millions were moved from Shiba Staking to crypto exchange Binance. It triggered a selloff in SHIB and BONE prices.\n\nScimitar Capital, the hedge fund rumored to be behind the massive $2 billion altcoin liquidation, said:\n\n\u201cOur fund has made the strategic decision to liquidate our crypto holdings and return the capital to our esteemed LPs. We believe this move will provide enhanced stability and opportunities.\u201d\n\n[BREAKING] The fund that liquidated $2B of altcoins late Friday night in the broad crypto selloff is rumored to be Scimitar Capital pic.twitter.com/e23mbpuJda \u2014 thiccy (@thiccythot_) June 10, 2023\n\nAlso Read: Terra Classic\u2019s Biggest v2.1.0 Parity Upgrade Proposal Officially Passed, LUNC To $1"

        "content": "A further drop in ETH\u2019s price could send the DeFi market into another round of liquidation.\n\nThe DeFi TVL across all chains submerged.\n\nEthereum [ETH] and assets linked to the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector are experiencing a wave of uncertainty in the market. Although ETH\u2019s dominance in the smart contract space has been unwavering, liquidation in the crypto market arm reached $11 million.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nAccording to Parsec Finance\u2019s data, this liquidation was the highest recorded since 12 May. However, market participants might need to exercise more caution as DefiLlama data shed light on potential threats.\n\nDeFi: Wary of the possibilities\n\nAt the time of writing, the multi-chain DeFi aggregator showed that the total liquidatable assets amounted to $1.7 billion. This metric describes the overall worth of DeFi assets with open futures or contract positions which could suffer losses depending on the market direction.\n\nBased on DefiLlamas\u2019 data, most of the liquidation in the last 24 hours occurred via the MakerDAO [MKR] protocol. However, there were several open staked Ether [stETH] and Wrapped Bitcoin [WBTC] positions at risk of suffering the same fate.\n\nSo, this could prompt market participants to carefully evaluate the risks involved with their sentiment.\n\nOver the last 24 hours, it has not been rosy for the broader crypto market. For instance, ETH\u2019s value decreased by 5.93%. DeFi tokens like Arbitrum [ARB] and Lido Finance [LDO] lost 12.49% and 18.16% respectively.\n\nWith the falling prices, DefiLlama revealed that another 20% aggregate decrease in value could take another $161 million out of the market.\n\nAlthough 20% might seem like a lot, the press time market state does not take away the possibility. This is because more than half of the cryptocurrencies in the top 50 by market capitalization have experienced double-digit decreases in the last 24 hours.\n\nTVL in the drain\n\nInterestingly, the Total Value Locked (TVL) has not been exempt from the widespread gloomy picture of the market. Out of almost 200 chains in the sector, only one\u2014zkSync Era\u2014recorded growth in the last 24 hours.\n\nAs an indicator of whether a DeFi asset is undervalued or overvalued, the TVL measures the worth of tokens temporarily deposited into a protocol.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s MKR\u2019s market cap in LDO\u2019s terms\n\nEthereum, which has the highest TVL of $25.28 billion, lost 4.36% of smart contract deposits within the said period. Thus, the decrease implies that liquidity has been hoarded and flown out of the ecosystem by investors. So, Ethereum might not be performing at its highest capacity.\n\nUnder the Ethereum blockchain, Lido Finance continues to lead the pact with a TVL of $12.65 billion. Other projects, including MakerDAO, Curve Finance [CRV], and Aave [AAVE], trailed behind."

        "content": "You can find dozens of Elon Musk videos on YouTube that appear to be Bitcoin price predictions or his viewpoint on various cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. But the reality is that all such YouTube videos are fake! There is a whole network of cybercriminals who have uploaded fake Elon Musk videos on YouTube to scam viewers. And what's more shocking is that the scammers made $243,000 in just over a week! A report by BBC confirmed as many as 23 transfers of Bitcoin and 18 transfers of Ethereum. So, how is this Elon Musk scam being powered on YouTube?\n\nFraudsters are hacking YouTube accounts and promoting fraudulent cryptocurrency giveaways with fake videos. Thousands of people watched these bogus videos this month, according to BBC. For months, a number of individuals have been duped into transferring cryptocurrencies to criminals via these video live stream on YouTube for months. According to the BBC, the hackers alter the names and images of dozens of YouTube channels to imitate official Tesla channels, of which Musk is the CEO.\n\nA BBC report mentioned that Elon Musk said on Tuesday that YouTube was not tackling \"scam ads\" properly. While YouTube says it removes all those channels that are reported. There is one of the most common videos on YouTube that claims that people can double their money by sending Bitcoin or Ethereum to a digital wallet. Shockingly, Chilean musician Aisack has also been a victim of this fake video-streaming of Elon Musk videos on YouTube. Two weeks ago, cybercriminals hijacked the musician's YouTube channel.\n\n\"My followers on other social networks started asking me what is going on with the name of my channel and were very confused about why I was streaming Tesla content,\" BBC report quoted Chilean urban-music artist Aisack as saying. He further adds, \"I feel completely violated and insecure. YouTube is not doing enough on security issues to prevent hacker attacks, since many users are in the same situation as me.\u201d\n\nYouTube says that it had removed one of the reported channels while adding, \"We have strict Community Guidelines prohibiting scams, including Impersonation and hacking.\" Surprisingly, Whale Alert founder Frank van Weert mentioned that, scammers are having less success than the previous year - but still, there are plenty of victims falling for it."
