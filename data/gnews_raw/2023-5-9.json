        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Is Ethereum a Good Investment? - Macrohive",
        "content": "[Updated 16 May 2023]\n\nSummary\n\nWe look at the latest ethereum trends, including macro risks and on-chain/flow metrics, to reveal the best time to buy ethereum and the risks of buying ETH.\n\nFor trading ethereum over the next two to four weeks, we are slightly bearish. That means we expect prices to either stay the same or fall, with more chance they will fall.\n\nHowever, we think ethereum is a good long-term investment for the next one to three years and are bullish overall. That means we expect prices to rise in the long term.\n\nIs Now a Good Time to Buy Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is currently amid a cumulative drawdown of around 62% since the November 2021 all-time high of $4,891 and is trading at around $1,820. However, the last six months have been more positive, with ethereum up 49%.\n\nOne of the main drivers of ethereum price rises is the market\u2019s hope that the Federal Reserve has finished hiking interest rates. However, we think the Fed is not done with its aggressive hiking cycle, and recession risks are increasing.\n\nConsequently, the macro backdrop for ethereum is bearish. We analyse various on-chain/flow metrics for ethereum, which are neutral. Overall, we are neutral to bearish on ETH in the short term. Therefore, if you have a two-to-four-week horizon, now may not be a good time to buy ethereum.\n\nShould I buy ethereum? Probably not\n\nWhy Has the ETH Price Risen Recently?\n\nReasons for the Current ETH Price (Short-Term View)\n\nCrypto markets surged this year after the FDIC announced it would back all deposits at Silicon Valley Bank. This move follows the Silvergate Capital collapse and has calmed fears of a potential bank run across the US. As a result, ethereum and the wider crypto market are rallying.\n\nAlso helping the ethereum price is the market\u2019s hope that the Federal Reserve has finished hiking interest rates. After one of the most aggressive hiking campaigns in decades, the Fed seems to have finally got inflation under control. After peaking at 9.1% in June 2022, headline inflation has fallen steadily to 4.9%.\n\nHiking interest rates is a contractionary monetary policy that increases the cost of borrowing, reduces demand, and is generally negative for risk assets such as stocks and crypto. It also increases the risk of recession. However, if the Fed starts easing rates, as markets currently expect for 2023, risk assets like ethereum may benefit.\n\nThe chart below shows the latest ETH price.\n\nPrevious reasons for bullishness towards ethereum included the merge, ETH\u2019s upgrade to proof-of-stake. In a previous ethereum update, we discussed the implications of the merge. The punchline was it would be bullish for these reasons:\n\nValidators can earn yield on staked ETH post merge.\n\nFaster transactions.\n\nNet issuance is projected to drop considerably post merge, constraining supply.\n\nEthereum may become deflationary.\n\nIncreased scalability and security.\n\nBetter for the environment thanks to proof of stake not work.\n\nHowever, ethereum and the broader crypto space have been unable to escape the longer-term bearish macro backdrop. We discuss that next.\n\nLike these insights? Join our free newsletter for regular updates and trade ideas. Want to receive our latest macro and financial market updates?

The main reason for the fall going into 2023 was the Federal Reserve\u2019s response to inflation. It has hiked interest rates an aggressive 500 basis points in this cycle, and this contractionary monetary policy tends to impact risk assets such as crypto negatively.\n\nMarkets seem to think the Fed is done hiking and has conquered inflation. However, April CPI showed no incremental progress on disinflation. Here are some of our main takeaways:\n\nA large increase in used car prices offset slower inflation in other categories.\n\nThe ongoing recovery in rental indices suggests that progress on shelter cost inflation may be transitory.\n\nApril core goods inflation rose to 0.6% due to a 4.4% increase in used car prices, which is converging to Manheim used car auction results, indicating further upside.\n\nMarkets continue to under-price the Fed. The labour market remains very tight, inflation is well above target, and \u2018the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go.\u2019 Markets are currently assigning just a 5% chance of a 25bp June FOMC hike. In our view, markets are under-pricing the risk of a hike and if current inflation and growth dynamics continue, a 25bp hike in June is likely (barring a debt ceiling crisis), which would be bearish for crypto.\n\nHow Interest Rates Affect Crypto\n\nYears of low interest rates since the global financial crisis in 2008 had seen markets reach extreme valuations by the end of 2021. Who cares if tech companies are loss-making if the companies can borrow easily? And if companies cannot borrow money, they can attract capital from investors, who themselves have likely borrowed money.\n\nCrypto markets have not been immune to the support from cheap leverage in the fiat markets. After all, crypto offers the tech dream of scalability and regulatory arbitrage. And if there was any doubt that crypto was not benefiting from low interest rates, the recent declines in crypto as US rates have risen should remove it.\n\nFurthermore, the correlation of ethereum to NASDAQ started to increase sharply just as US interest rates started to rise. This is a common occurrence throughout history. When the liquidity tap turns off, usually by central banks raising rates, the correlation between diverse assets shoots up. This time appears no different.\n\nThe bottom line is that the macro backdrop for crypto remains bearish on rate hikes and inflation. The probability of recession remains high at 80%, and we expect the Fed to hike more than markets are pricing in.\n\nHow Low Can Ethereum Prices Go?\n\nOne exercise is to see how low prices could get were the NASDAQ to suffer a 2000-style crash. After all, the ethereum and NASDAQ correlation was around 80% until recently. So where the NASDAQ goes, ethereum follows.\n\nBack in 2000, the NASDAQ suffered a 78% drawdown. Currently, the NASDAQ is in a 30% drawdown. A repeat of the 2000-style drawdown would put the NASDAQ at 3,500. So where would crypto be if NASDAQ were trading at this level? We estimate a regression between ethereum/bitcoin returns and NASDAQ returns from 2020 onwards. Based on this relationship, we find:\n\nBitcoin prices would reach $8,254 if the NASDAQ fell to 3,500. This implies a 72% decline from current levels.\n\nEthereum prices would reach $143 if the NASDAQ fell to 3,500. This implies a 92% decline from current levels.\n\nHow High Can Ethereum Go?\n\nShould the currently restrictive environment of rising interest rates and recession risks subside, we could see ethereum return to its all-time high of $4,379 or even beyond. However, we caution that this scenario is unlikely in the short term and, like with any investment, it is impossible to say with certainty how high ethereum will go.\n\nWhat Else Is Happening in Crypto?\n\nRegulation also is becoming more of a theme throughout 2023, with various executive orders signed already. Increased regulation should mean less uncertainty around crypto markets for investors, which would be bullish.\n\nOn the flip side, overregulation could stifle innovation by increasing censorship. The ongoing regulatory backdrop will be key to monitor. Lastly, on ethereum specifically, there is the much-anticipated merge. We previously covered its potential implications. The punchline was that it should be bullish for ethereum.\n\nCrypto News Impacting the ETH Price\n\nRising yields have mechanically increased the probability of a recession within the next 12 months to over 80%.\n\nhave mechanically increased the probability of a recession within the next 12 months to over 80%.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) is targeting crypto companies that engage in crimes themselves or allow crimes like money laundering to happen.\n\nSummary of ETH Analysis\n\nThe bottom line is that crypto, including ethereum, will remain under pressure. The main near-term support would be Fed dovishness rather than any crypto-specific dynamics. While this is possible, persistent inflation and a roaring economy make it unlikely. And for long-term investors, we still think some allocation to crypto makes sense \u2013 just like an allocation to equities also makes sense. But be prepared for weakness in 2022-3.\n\nFor all our latest analysis on crypto markets, click here.\n\nEthereum and Crypto Price Trackers\n\nUpdated 12 May 2023\n\nThis week, all our indices are in the red, with our Bitcoin Index (-6.3% WoW) down the least and our Metaverse Index (-15.6% WoW) down the most (Chart 2).\n\nOur Smart Contract Index remains most correlated to our Bitcoin Index (+87%).

With the length of the blockchain continuing to grow and decentralised finance (DeFi) gaining ground over traditional finance, this new asset class is reshaping the investment landscape.\n\nWe think ethereum is a worthwhile long-term investment. However, we also note that ethereum is extremely volatile. That means it experiences large price movements over short periods. Before you invest in ETH, you must understand the risks involved: you could lose all or a large portion of your investment. Never invest money that you cannot afford to lose.\n\nHow to Make Money Investing in Ethereum\n\nIt is easy to get carried away with the fear of missing out. You are probably aware of Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who are reputed to be the world\u2019s first bitcoin billionaires with over 100,000 coins. Or what about Barry Silbert, the owner of Grayscale Ethereum Trust, Coinbase and Coinbase? Success stories like these often give people FOMO \u2013 or the fear of missing out \u2013 if they do not invest immediately.\n\nHowever, to invest in cryptocurrency, we must first understand it. Crypto tokens are unlike any traditional asset class. And they are all different. Just because you understand bitcoin, does not mean you know how ethereum works. Our video on bitcoin and ethereum fundamentals can help you understand how ethereum prices fluctuate and how to assess trends in important ethereum metrics. And the video below explains other cryptocurrencies that might put ethereum at risk.\n\nEach currency has different underlying protocols and technology. That impacts how they trade, their volatility, and how you can value them. Some are more like stocks, others commodities, and others currencies. And each crypto token has a unique structure of supply.\n\nWe think crypto markets are a worthwhile long-term investment. The technology can capture market share on some existing markets like payments and stock trading while creating new markets like valuable scarce digital assets.\n\nBuying the Dip\n\nYour exposure to ethereum needs to be appropriately sized so that you can survive 50% to 80% drawdowns. Drawdowns provide good entry levels for exposure, but we would not go max long in an environment of rising central bank rates and falling global growth momentum.\n\nTop 3 Tips You Need to Know Before Investing in Ethereum\n\nWhere to Buy Ethereum\n\nTo buy ethereum (ETH) or any other cryptocurrency, you need access to a crypto exchange. A crypto exchange is where buyers and sellers meet to exchange money for coins, coins for other coins, and coins for money. Many options are available such as Coinbase, Binance.com, or eToro \u2013 each come with various fee structures, so research which is best for your needs.\n\nYou also need access to a crypto wallet to store ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. Many exchanges provide these, but not all do. You can also buy ethereum on platforms like Paypal and Robinhood.\n\nETH Dollar-Cost Averaging\n\nCryptocurrencies can be extremely volatile. One way to cope with the volatility is to use dollar-cost averaging. Dollar-cost averaging is a strategy where you divide the total amount you want to invest across periodic purchases of the target asset. It simply means that you would invest the same number of dollars each month or quarter, regardless of market trends.\n\nThe idea is that when prices are high, you can afford less of the asset. But when prices are low, you can afford more. When the market recovers, you benefit from having bought more shares at the lower price. Please note that using this strategy will not always result in a profit or necessarily protect you from falling prices.\n\nDiversify Your Crypto Portfolio\n\nWith the crypto landscape so volatile and diverse, managing risk in a portfolio is critical. That essentially means position sizing and diversification \u2013 as with any other kind of investment.\n\nOne of the best pieces of investment advice we have heard recently comes from Ari Paul, co-founder and CIO of Blocktower Capital, a crypto and blockchain investment firm. As Paul says,\n\n\u201cRisk is only sizing. So, if you think bitcoin is too risky, you could size it at 0.1% of your portfolio or 0.001%. Too risky is never a reason not to own an asset. If something is positive expected value, risk adjusted, and relatively low correlation, you have to own it. That\u2019s peak portfolio management 101.\u201d\n\nOne way to diversify your portfolio is with stablecoins, although these have also been very high-risk following the Terra debacle. Our recent analysis has explored how safe is tether and which stablecoins could fall next. We advise only a very small allocation to crypto and prefer diversification with more traditional asset classes.\n\nFAQs\n\n\u2192 Is now a good time to buy ethereum?\n\nFor trading ethereum over the next two to four weeks, we are neutral to bearish. That means we expect stable to falling prices. For 2022-3 in general, we think recession risks pose a risk to ETH and so now might not be the best time to buy ethereum if you have a medium-term outlook. We think ethereum is a good long-term investment for the next one to three years and are bullish overall. That means we expect prices to rise in the long term.\n\n\u2192 When was ethereum at its lowest?\n\nEthereum was the lowest in October 2016, when its price was $0.41. Since then, Ethereum has experienced several major bull runs. The first was in 2017/8 when it peaked at $1,400. It subsequently dropped to around $300-400 until the start of 2021. From January that year, bullish sentiment took the coin to over $4,000. It was not until the closing moments of 2021 that ETH breached this threshold, continuing its rise to $4,780 in November 2021. Since then, ETH price has been volatile and generally gone downwards. It is currently around $1,500.\n\n\u2192 Can you lose your money buying ETH now?\n\nAs with all investments, the value of ethereum can rise as well as fall. While it is unlikely that ethereum will suffer a complete loss of value, investors must be prepared to suffer drawdowns of between 50% and 80%. We recommend small allocations and diversification of your portfolio. Never invest what you cannot afford to lose.\n\n\u2192 When to sell ethereum?\n\nTraditional wisdom says you should buy low and sell high. But whether you should sell ethereum depends on your investment horizon, risk appetite and financial goals. Although some website speculate that certain days of the week are better or worse then others for selling ethereum, we believe that any decision to buy or sell should be based on analysis of crypto fundamentals.\n\n\u2192 Is ethereum a good investment?\n\nWe think a small allocation to ETH makes sense in the long term. However, we caution against investing in ethereum too heavily as cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile and often subject to large downturns.\n\nAppendix\n\nEthereum as a Good Inflation Hedge\n\nEthereum and bitcoin have historically been touted as a hedge for inflation. When inflation expectations rise, you would want the relationship between the cryptocurrency and inflation expectations to be at least positive. This, historically, has held. However, since February, the relationship has broken down. Inflation expectations remained anchored while ETH prices have fallen. A more hawkish Federal Reserve could weigh on ETH going forward.\n\nThe Ethereum Merge (or ETH 2.0)\n\nEthereum has been running on two different blockchains since April 2022. One operates using proof-of-work, like bitcoin. The other is a test chain what uses proof-of-stake. The merge is an upcoming event where these two blockchains will combine, ending proof-of-work. It is expected to happen in Q3/Q4 2022, and it will eliminate the energy-intensive mining required in proof-of-work. Guest author Nikhil Shamapant explains more about the ethereum merge and what it could mean for ETH price in 2023 in his recent article.\n\nDalvir Mandara is a Quantitative Researcher at Macro Hive.

        "title": "Ethereum derivatives flirting with bearishness: Mind the $1,820 support - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "After a brief overshoot above $2,000 on May 6, the Ether price has returned to a tight range between $1,820 and $1,950, which has been the norm for the past three weeks.\n\nAccording to the latest Ether (ETH) futures and options data, odds favor the Ether price breaking below the $1,820 support, as professional traders have been unwilling to add neutral-to-bullish positions using derivatives contracts.\n\nEther price in USD, 12-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nNot even the memecoin frenzy that boosted Ethereum network demand was able to instill confidence in investors. The average Ethereum transaction fee skyrocketed to $27.70 on May 6, the highest in 12 months, according to BitInfoCharts data. As reported by Cointelegraph, one of the main drivers behind the increase was the insatiable demand for Pepe (PEPE), among other memecoins.\n\nMoreover, the increased gas fees have driven users to layer-2 solutions, which could be interpreted as a weakness. For instance, it causes a decline in the total value locked by removing deposits from the Ethereum chain, especially in decentralized finance applications.\n\nSome analysts believe the $30 million Ether sale by the Ethereum Foundation contributed to ETH being unable to break above $2,000, as nearly 20,000 ETH were sent to the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange. The foundation\u2019s last relevant transfer occurred in November 2021, when the price topped around $4,850 and subsequently declined by 80%.\n\nOn the macroeconomic side, the United States\u2019 4.9% April consumer price index (CPI) data announced on May 10, slightly below consensus, further increased investors\u2019 expectations of stable interest rates at the next Federal Reserve meeting in June. CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool showed 94% odds of stability at the current 5% to 5.25% range.\n\nTherefore, with no signs of a Fed pivot on the horizon, the demand for risk-on assets such as cryptocurrencies should remain under pressure. But if investors fear that Ether has higher odds of breaking the three-week sideways movement to the downside, i should be reflected in the ETH futures contract premium and increased costs for protective put options.\n\nEther futures reflect weak demand from longs\n\nEther quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement.\n\nAs a result, ETH futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5% to 10% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nEther three-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nEther traders have been extremely cautious in the past week, as there was no surge in demand for leverage longs during the rally above $2,000 on May 6. Presently at 1.4%, the ETH futures premium reflects a complete lack of appetite from buyers using derivatives contracts.\n\nEther options risk metric stood neutral\n\nTraders should also analyze options markets to understand whether the recent correction has caused investors to become more optimistic. The 25% call-to-put delta skew is a telling sign when arbitrage desks and market makers overcharge for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn short, if traders anticipate an Ether price drop, the skew metric will drop below 7%, and phases of excitement tend to have a positive 7% skew.\n\nRelated: Arbitrum's DAO to receive over 3,350 ETH revenue from transaction fees\n\nEther 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Amberdata & The Block\n\nAs displayed above, the ETH options' 25% call-to-put delta skew has been neutral for the past two weeks, as the protective put options were trading at a fair price relative to similar neutral-to-bullish call options.\n\nEther options and futures markets suggest that pro traders are not confident, especially considering the 10.6% rally between May 2-6. Therefore, the weak derivatives indicators are more likely to flip bearish if the three-week sideways movement breaks to the downside.\n\nIn other words, if Ether\u2019s price breaks below $1,820, traders should expect a much higher appetite for bearish bets using ETH derivatives, an indicator of distrust and a lack of demand for longs.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "The single biggest beneficiary was antigovernment extremist Ammon Bundy\u2019s People\u2019s Rights Network (PRN), which received transfers worth $93,000.\n\nHatewatch was first alerted to the cryptocurrency donations to PRN by the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights.\n\nOther major beneficiaries include white nationalist publication VDARE, which received $42,000, and white nationalist organization American Renaissance, which received $35,000.\n\nThe donations continue a pattern of anonymous big-money benefactors using cryptocurrency to conceal their identities and avoid accountability for funding extremists. Hatewatch has previously reported on similar donations including over $8 million donated to conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.\n\nDonor covers tracks\n\nThe mystery donor concealed the original source of the donations by using Tornado Cash, a so-called \u201cmixer\u201d service that disguises the origins of cryptocurrency transfers. Tornado Cash has since been sanctioned by the U.S. government due to its use in money-laundering, including by hackers sponsored by the North Korean regime.\n\nFrom Tornado Cash, the donor transferred Ethereum to three cryptocurrency addresses, which were then used to funnel the digital coins to extremists.\n\nJust over 99 Ethereum coins worth $314,000 were sent from Tornado Cash to a cryptocurrency address of unknown ownership on Jan. 10, 2022.\n\nPRN\u2019s big payday\n\nAlso on Jan. 10, 2022, PRN received a 20-coin donation from that address, and a five-coin donation on Jan. 29.

The OFAC said Tornado Cash facilitated illegal and criminal money transfers and implemented measures to censor specific transactions.\n\nIn response to the OFAC sanctions, some relay operators, the most famous of them being Flashbots, started filtering transactions that were not compliant with the OFAC sanctions. Initially, around 80% of all transactions on Ethereum were OFAC-compliant.\n\nHowever, that number has since gone down drastically. According to data from mevwatch.info, only 29% of all transactions on the Ethereum network are currently OFAC-compliant.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCryptocurrency prices rose on Wednesday after a widely-watched inflation gauge in the U.S. suggested the Federal Reserve\u2019s fight against soaring prices is making progress.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index rose 4.9% in the 12 months through April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said Wednesday, coming in slightly below economists' estimates of 5%.\n\nOn a month-to-month basis, the index, which tracks price movements across a broad range of goods and services, rose 0.4% in April compared to a 0.1% bump in March and a 0.4% increase in February.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin was up 1.4% over the past day, chipping away at weekly losses of 1.8% at around $27,900, according to CoinGecko. Ethereum was also in the green, notching a 1.6% daily increase and reversing a weekly downtrend at $1,870. Meanwhile, the global crypto market capitalization was sitting at $1.2 trillion\u2014up 0.8% from the previous day.\n\n\n\nIn terms of the impact that Wednesday\u2019s CPI print had on crypto markets, Managing Director at Wave Digital Assets Nauman Sheikh told Decrypt a lack of liquidity is likely at play, pointing to market makers like Jane Street and Jump who have scaled back.\n\n\u201cLiquidity just fell off a cliff, so any market impact on the way up on the way down will be a little bit more exaggerated,\u201d he said. \u201cThere's no depth to the market, which means any slight pressure on either side is just going to be exasperated.\u201d\n\nThe index\u2019s increase in April was largely fueled by a jump in housing prices, which grew 0.4% month-to-month, the BLS said. But the measure represented a notable decline compared to a monthly increase of 0.6% in March and 0.8% in February.\n\nThe report indicated that core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, rose 5.5% in the 12 months through April, edging down from 5.6% in March.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor the most part, inflation has steadily cooled over the past several months, down significantly from a sweltering 9.1% clip last June. Still, the latest report showed annual inflation remains far above the Fed\u2019s target of 2%. And the U.S. central bank has jacked interest rates aggressively in response to rising prices. It\u2019s lifted interest rates to their highest levels since 2007, delivering its 10th consecutive rate hike last week.\n\nHigher interest rates cool down the economy because of their ripple effect, impacting costs associated with credit cards and mortgages. They also weigh on stocks and other \u201crisk\u201d assets, such as crypto, making yields on cash reserves and U.S. Treasury Bills comparatively more attractive.\n\nThe Fed risks tipping the U.S. economy into a recession if it raises rates too quickly. And signs of stress emerged in the financial system when several banks collapsed in March. The tumult continued when First Republic Bank failed last week. Now a potential debt ceiling crisis looms.\n\nWhen the Fed decided to raise interest rates last week, Chair Jerome Powell indicated there could be a potential pause. But he said the central bank would wait and see how the economy performed before making a decision at the Fed\u2019s next meeting in June.\n\n\u201cThe fact that [inflation] is within expectations, a bit better for the annual rate, it means the Fed will likely pause,\u201d Kaiko analyst Dessislava Aubert told Decrypt, \u201cBecause the current banking turmoil in the U.S. is basically making traditional tightening less necessary\u2014banks are already tightening lending standards.\u201d"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) recently achieved a new all-time record, as the amount of ETH locked reached a staggering 19,375,242 ETH. This milestone comes after what can be described as a \"dip for ants,\" as the recent withdrawals appear minuscule when viewed from a broader perspective. This achievement has significant implications for Ethereum and its investors, particularly in terms of the cryptocurrency's future growth potential.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe locked ETH includes several categories, such as ETH staked on the Beacon chain, ETH deposited to the Beacon contract but not yet validating and rewards on the Beacon chain. Collectively, these categories represent the ETH that is \"out of circulation,\" thereby reducing the available supply and potentially driving up demand and price.\n\nETH locked* hit an all-time recently at 19,375,242 ETH\n\n\n\nWhen you zoom out, the withdrawals seem like a dip for ants\n\n\n\n*All ETH that is \"out of circulation\":\n\n\u2022 ETH staked on Beacon chain\n\n\u2022 ETH deposited to the beacon contract but not validating yet\n\n\u2022 Rewards on the Beacon chain pic.twitter.com/N1jyR7hcBO \u2014 Nansen \ud83e\udded (@nansen_ai) May 9, 2023\n\nThe fact that such a substantial amount of ETH is locked away demonstrates increasing interest in and adoption of Ethereum's proof-of-stake (PoS) system. As more investors stake their ETH on the Beacon chain, it showcases confidence in Ethereum's long-term viability and growth prospects. This trend could further solidify Ethereum's position as a leading cryptocurrency and smart contract platform.\n\nWhen analyzing recent withdrawals in the context of the broader Ethereum ecosystem, it becomes clear that these movements are relatively insignificant. The locked ETH has continued to grow despite minor fluctuations, suggesting that the cryptocurrency's overall health remains robust. For investors, this serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective when evaluating market movements.\n\nThe new all-time record for locked ETH underscores the strength of the Ethereum network and its potential for continued growth. As Ethereum 2.0 progresses and the transition to a PoS model becomes more firmly established, it is likely that the amount of locked ETH will continue to rise."

        "content": "Centralized staking pools experienced an array of farewells.\n\nValidators have opted not to cross the minimum balance required to stake.\n\nWithin Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] ecosystem, staking activity has become a topic of increasing interest and scrutiny since the Shapella upgrade\u2019s success. But contrary to projection, ETH did not witness a high level of sell pressure after staking withdrawals resumed. Instead, it was around that time that the altcoin surged to $2,000.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nHowever, post Shapella and ETH\u2019s loss of its hold on the price, there have been some notable changes in the Ethereum staking world.\n\nChange of plans for ETH?\n\nGlassnode, in its 8 May report, revealed that full withdrawals had now outpaced partial withdrawals, which were initially rampant. Unstaking all initially staked Ether means that validators, who deposited a minimum of 32 ETH, have decided to grab their rewards and take out their capital.\n\nFurthermore, the number of complete validator exits in the ecosystem determines the full withdrawals. And, as of 4 May, the complete exit from the system was as much as 1.23 million in ETH.\n\nBesides the departure, the has been a change in the validators\u2019 contrition to equilibrium. According to the on-chain analytic platform, the validators\u2019 balance, which was pegged at 32 ETH, enjoyed an average of 2 ETH addition before the upgrade.\n\nBut since Shanghai took center stage, the balance has reduced to 32.35 ETH. This inferred that those who had not deployed their assets had exchanged their rewards.\n\nDespite the withdrawals, which were as much as 48.341 validators, there were also instances of those waiting to enter the staking pool.\n\nIn fact, Glassnode showed that the number of waiting depositors was over 23,000, at the time of the report. This confirmed investors\u2019 interest in staking, and a bid to balance the growth in the number of exits. Based on Glassnode\u2019s data, exits from the staking pool had already been minimized.\n\nIndividual retirements, but Lido remains king\n\nAlthough the net validator count was near zero, Glassnode noted that it expected a positive return in the future. The report noted that:\n\n\u201cGiven the tapering off of exits and persistently high inflow of new staking entrants, we expect a net increase to validator counts in the near future.\u201d\n\nHowever, it was noteworthy to mention that most of the exits came from exchange activity. Exchanges including Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, and Gate.io topped the list.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nLido Finance [LDO], which is the most effective liquid staking platform out of the lot, had not yet enabled withdrawals. Moreover, only 6.6% of the overall withdrawals were linked to the decentralized staking providers.\n\nIn addition, Lido remained the largest pool with the highest share of stakers. While a large number of exits were from individual stakers on centralized exchanges, Coinbase and Kraken could still rank second and third, respectively, in market share."

        "content": "Ethereum Gas Fees Spike to Yearly High Amid a Renewed Meme Coin Frenzy Public Domain / Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe recent surge in interest in meme coins like PEPE has sent the daily median Ethereum gas price, or transaction cost, above 12-month highs. The increased usage of the Ethereum network has also prompted a rise in the ETH burn rate. While the memecoin frenzy seems to return, what does it mean for Ethereum holders?\n\nETH Gas Fees Surge As Meme Coin Mania Kicks Off with Pepe\n\nThe recent launch of PEPE, a frog-themed meme coin that is an adaptation of the popular movie franchise \u201cPepe the Frog,\u201d has sparked a renewed interest in meme coins. The token, which has seen massive success since its debut, is also primarily responsible for driving up the ETH gas fees.\n\nAccording to data by CoinGecko, PEPE has gained a staggering 555% over the past two weeks alone. The token surpassed the $500 million mark in market capitalization within three weeks of its launch and entered the top 100 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on May 1.\n\nPEPE is the 57th largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of over $823 million. In the last 24 hours, the trading volume for PEPE surpassed $143 million on Uniswap, higher than Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and USDT stablecoin volumes.\n\nThe success of the PEPE coin has also renewed interest in other meme coins, including CHAD and 4TOKEN, which have rallied 450% and 250% in one week. Another cryptocurrency DINO has risen 500% in two weeks.\n\nThe new meme coin frenzy has sent ETH gas fees through the roof. As of May 9, the average cost of a single transaction on Ethereum stands at above $21. On May 5, the gas fee hit a multi-month high of above $27.\n\nThis is not the first time Ethereum\u2019s mean transaction fees have reached such high levels. During the 2021 bull market, the gas fees hit as high as $70, though things have been quiet since the market crashed in May last year.\n\nETH Burn Rate Increases Amid Rising Demand\n\nThe increase in network demand has also prompted a rise in the Ethereum burn rate. Data from Ultrasound Money, a website dedicated to Ethereum\u2019s activities post-Merge, shows that 115,939 ETH (around $214 billion) has been burned over the past 30 days.\n\nZooming out, the data shows that 197,728 ETH has been burned since the Merge occurred 236 days ago. This suggests that around 58% of the total burned ETH since the Merge was burned in the last month, triggered by increased activity in the network.\n\nUniswap, the largest decentralized exchange, has accounted for most of the recent burns. Data by Ultrasound Money shows that approximately 36,000 ETH has been burned by transactions on the DEX in the last 30 days.\n\nThe burn rate sits at around 4 ETH per minute over the 30-day timeframe. Over one day, the burn rate is at 6.82 ETH per minute.\n\nThe burning is related to the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-1559, implemented in August 2021. The EIP-1559 changed how Ethereum calculates and processes network transaction fees, adding a mechanism to burn a portion of fees paid by users.\n\nThe Merge upgrade made the burning mechanism even more effective, putting ether on the path to becoming a deflationary asset by replacing miners with validators as entities responsible for running the blockchain and causing a drastic reduction in the newly minted ETH.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,847, almost flat over the past day. The token is, however, still down by more than 62% compared to its all-time high.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Tokenist\n\nSponsored: Want to Retire Early?

        "content": "Validators earned $46 million in the first week of May due to an increase in the staking rewards rate, which is a metric for validators\u2019 annualized yield. According to data, validators earned 24,997 Ether (ETH) in the week, representing a 40% increase over the previous week\u2019s income of $33 million, when 18,339 ETH were distributed as rewards.\n\nThe recent trading craze of a new memecoin called Pepe (PEPE) is the reason behind the increased rewards for validators. In the past week, the average fees on the Ethereum network have exceeded 100 gwei, marking the highest level since May 2022. As gas fees increase, end users pay over $30 per swap, resulting in higher fee income for validators from processing transactions and the regular validator rewards.\n\nETH staking rewards reference rate. Source: Beaconcha.in\n\nBeaconcha.in states that the present staking rate signifies the anticipated annualized return for validators. In order to engage in the network\u2019s consensus procedure, validators on Ethereum are mandated to stake a minimum of 32 ETH, valued at roughly $58,000.\n\nThere are two types of rewards identified by ETH Store, a company that measures reward rates: consensus rewards for proposing and attesting blocks, and transaction fees for processing transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nRelated: Worth it?

The gas fees have gotten so high during the ongoing meme coin PEPE mania that some users have become priced out.\n\nOver the past few weeks, amid the PEPE hysteria, the average Ethereum gas price went to levels not seen since May 2022.

One user cried for help about paying $100 in gas fees for a $10 purchase.\n\n$10 purchase, gas fees $101+\n\n\n\nETH miners or devs, pls make it make sense to me. \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24 pic.twitter.com/4JBYxp4dbm \u2014 Officialjioke \ud83d\udcc9\ud83d\udcca\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcb0 (@official_jioke) May 5, 2023\n\nAnother one joked that selling their left kidney is the only way to pay the high Ethereum gas fees.\n\nA new option to pay eth gas fees pic.twitter.com/R2M9QA3x4I \u2014 Sadie (@SadieCalls) May 5, 2023\n\nA Cardano community member mocked the high Ethereum fees and sarcastically asked whether Ethereum users have heard of Cardano, a blockchain with lower fees.\n\nEstimated gas fees for a tx on Eth right now: $187.71\n\n\n\nHey guys, ever heard of Cardano? pic.twitter.com/mTZ2KW9xOe \u2014 Rami (@CardanoRami) May 8, 2023\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nThere lies a paradox in the saying that \u201cno one is using Ethereum because the gas fees are so high.\u201d Gas fees are high precisely because there\u2019s an increased demand for Ethereum block space.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nHigh gas fees on Ethereum indicate higher activity on the network. However, many users get priced out of using Ethereum when gas prices are high. At the same time, there are multiple Ethereum Layer-2 solutions that are working towards scaling Ethereum and eliminating high gas fees.\n\nRead more about PEPE dumping in the past few days:\n\nMeme Coin PEPE Dumps 42% as Whales Continue to Exit\n\nRead more about Lido setting a date for st ETH withdrawals:\n\nLido Finally Sets Date for stETH Withdrawals"

        "content": "Implied volatility for Ethereum took a massive plunge.\n\nEthereum Foundation sold some of its ETH holdings.\n\nAs part of its growth roadmap, the Ethereum protocol is supposed to undergo numerous changes and upgrades. Now, interestingly, every time there is some upgrade on the network, the Implied Volatility (IV) of ETH increases.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nHowever, over the last few days, Ethereum\u2019s Implied Volatility has declined.\n\nAccording to data provided by GreeksLive, the long-term implied volatility (IV) for ETH ATM (At-the-Money) options reached a historic low of 50%.\n\nConsequently, the IV levels for ETH now align with those of BTC, inferring that the market has assimilated future volatility expectations for ETH to be on par with BTC.\n\nFor context, Implied Volatility (IV) is a measure of the expected volatility of an asset, derived from the prices of options contracts. A decline in implied volatility for ETH may indicate a decrease in the market\u2019s expectation of future price fluctuations of ETH.\n\nThis means that market participants perceive that the probability of large price swings in ETH is lower than before.\n\nDespite the low volatility experienced by Ethereum, the put-to-call ratio for Ethereum continued to increase for Ethereum across exchanges.\n\nAn increasing put-to-call ratio for Ethereum may suggest that market participants are becoming more bearish on the future price of ETH, as they are purchasing more put options to hedge their positions or speculate on a potential decline in price.\n\nEthereum Foundation and the bears\n\nYou wonder what is the reason behind the unprecedented high level of bearish sentiment around ETH. Well, you might as well thank Ethereum Foundations\u2019 recent behavior.\n\nFor context, the Ethereum Foundation is a non-profit organization that supports the development and advancement of the Ethereum blockchain and its ecosystem.\n\nAt press time, the Ethereum Foundation sold 15,000 ETH. On the last two occasions when the Ethereum Foundation opted to divest its holdings, the market value of ETH decreased.\n\nIn terms of activity, the Ethereum network took a massive hit. Over the last month, the overall number of NFT trades occurring on the network declined materially. Consequently, there was a decline in gas usage as well.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nNotably, if the activity on Ethereum continues to decline, it could impact the protocol negatively in the future."

According to pseudonymous Twitter user FlurETH, the trader in question is sitting on 133 ETH ($245,667) in unrealized profit on their investment in the memecoin.\n\nHigh gas fee transaction details. Source: Etherscan.\n\nGas fees on the Ethereum network have become the subject of debate amongst the crypto community, with a number of prominent Etheruem advocates praising the heightened activity for its revenue generating effects and long-term deflationary pressure on the supply of Ether.\n\nArbitrum One, an Ethereum layer 2 network, just did more daily fee revenue than Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nNot to mention that Ethereum itself did more than 28x the fee revenue of Bitcoin in the same time period. pic.twitter.com/plLEzdynNB \u2014 sassal.eth (@sassal0x) April 20, 2023\n\nOthers have leveled criticism at the fees, claiming that unless the network becomes more \u201caffordable\u201d mass adoption will never be achieved.\n\nAs reported by Cointelegraph, one of the main drivers behind the increase in Ethereum gas fees comes from the recent memecoin mania, driven in large part by the frenzied buying of a new memecoin called Pepe (PEPE). At the time of publication, the average Ethereum transaction fee is sitting at $22.98, the highest level recorded since May 12, 2022, when the average fee reached a peak of $31.11.\n\nAverage Ethereum transaction fees in the past year. Source: Etherscan\n\nAnother major reason behind the drastic uptick in gas fees comes from the maximal extractable value trading bot that is front-running memecoin trades en masse. The notorious MEV bot and \u201csandwich\u201d attacker, known only by the pseudonym jaredfromsubway.eth, has been profiting significantly from the heightened network use.\n\nA sandwich attack occurs when an attacker \u201csandwiches\u201d a victim\u2019s transaction between their own two transactions in order to manipulate the price and profit from the user.\n\nOn April 18, Jared cleared a whopping $950,000 in profits from the sandwich attacks. Jared has also been one of the largest gas spenders on the Ethereum network. On April 20, Jared used 7% of the total gas on the network and spent 455 ETH in transaction fees.\n\nAsia Express: Justin Sun\u2019s SUI-farming sins, PEPE\u2019s wild run, 3AC\u2019s oyster philosophy"

        "content": "Ethereum layer-2 blockchain Arbitrum will distribute Ether (ETH) worth nearly $6.2 million to its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), the project announced on May 9 on Twitter.\n\nThe funds to be collected are base fees and surplus revenue generated from network transactions. According to Arbitrum\u2019s tweet, a total of 3,352 ETH will be collected by its DAO. As internet-native organizations, DAOs are collectively owned and managed by their members. They have treasuries and make decisions through proposals voted on by the group.\n\nBig news Arbinauts!\n\n\n\nArbitrum is the only rollup that sends all surplus revenue generated by transaction fees to their respective DAO and it is time for the DAO to collect the funds so far!\n\n\n\nFollow along to learn more about it. \u2014 Arbitrum (,) (@arbitrum) May 10, 2023\n\nArbitrum is a popular scaling network used by many decentralized applications and blockchain developers. All users pay a fee during transactions on Arbitrum One.\n\nThe cost of sending ETH on Arbitrum is currently $0.25, and swapping tokens is $0.68 at the time of writing. Data from Crypto Fees shows that Arbitrum's users paid $387,423 in fees over the past seven days.\n\nEach fee paid on Arbitrum One is divided into two sections \u2014 the L1 fee and L2 fee. According to the protocol, the L1 fee covers the cost of posting a transaction on the Ethereum network and the L2 fee covers the cost of running the network.\n\n\"All revenue from the Arbitrum Network is sent to the DAO treasury and it is up to the DAO on how to spend it\", told Cointelegraph the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nA revenue breakdown reveals around 582 ETH of surplus funds generated from the L1 fee, nearly 1,308 ETH from base fees and a 1,462 ETH surplus from the L2 fee. Combined, this represents revenue of 3,352 ETH for Arbitrum's DAO.\n\nA related proposal from an anonymous member of Arbitrum's governance forum urges the protocol to create a mechanism for revenue distribution that would be triggered periodically by a smart contract. According to the proposal, delegated ARB tokens would be eligible for revenue distribution. The DAO hasn't voted on the proposal.\n\nThe proposal claims it would \"align community incentives and give ARB a purpose beyond a worthless governance token.\" Most community members support the proposal, according to the governance forum. Some members, however, highlighted that the revenue distribution might further serve to classify the ARB token as a security.\n\nCommunity member comments on Arbitrum\u2019s \"Distribution of DAO Revenue to ARB token holders\u201d proposal. Source: Arbitrum DAO.\n\nArbitrum's revenue distribution comes after the protocol team clashed with its community over a nearly $1 billion fund transfer that wasn't approved by ARB holders.\n\nUpdate (May 17, 2023 at 14:48 UTC): This article has been updated to clarify that the proposal on Arbitrum's governance forum was submitted by an anonymous member, not by the Arbitrum Foundation. The anonymous member has no relationship with the Arbitrum Foundation. The DAO has not voted to approve the proposal nor is it implemented.\n\nMagazine: Joe Lubin \u2014 The truth about ETH founders split and \u2018Crypto Google\u2019"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has transferred 30 million worth of ETH to Kraken igniting massive sell-off concerns among users.\n\nETH price plunged by 4%, hanging on to the $1,900 mark on May 7 before sliding below the resistance following the sell-off rumours.\n\nDigital asset analysts have drawn similar patterns with the last two sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation and Vitalik Buterin.\n\nEthereum (ETH) trades at $1,832 after a rough weekend for digital assets plagued with congestion on the Bitcoin Network and massive sell-off concerns.\n\nAccording to data from crypto analytics firm Lookonchain, Vitalik Buterin transferred almost half a million worth of ETH to Kraken before the Ethereum foundation did the same with about $30 million worth of ETH.\n\nAt the time of both transactions, ETH exchanged hands at $1,960, with bulls holding on to the thoughts of $2,000. The price of ETH has trickled down weeks after the Shapella update, although its on-chain data still point upwards.\n\nThe transfer of millions worth of digital assets to exchange often indicates a rising balance springing up selling pressure from traders. In this case, despite the transfer of $30 million and mounting sell pressure, ETH balances on exchanges dropped from 18.22 million to 18.15 million over the weekend, showing signs of a strong recovery.\n\nSequel to the news, digital asset analysts compared market trends from past sales of ETH by the foundation and Buterin. The last big sale came in 2021, when 20,000 ETH was sold before the bear market kicked in. On the flip side, the foundation has also made large sales in the past during bull cycles, with the price surging.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough large sales in the past preceded ETH plunging into the red zone, little or no lines can be drawn to establish a connection between the sale and the market\u2019s bearish outlook.\n\nETH bulls look toward a breakout above $2k\n\nETH now exchanges hands at $1,847, a 4.32% drop in the past 72 hours as the wider crypto market goes red. Despite this drop, on-chain indicators like ETH\u2019s 200-day exponential moving average look good to push through the resistance.\n\nFurthermore, data aggregator Santiment believes that the huge inflow of ETH in exchanges could spark an initial uptick in price similar to the scenario in 2022. The firm took to Twitter to explain that ETH looks set to decouple from Bitcoin on the verge of breaking $2k.\n\n\u201cUpdating our report on #Ethereum\u2019s sky-high active deposits, exchange addresses interacting on the network is now at its highest level since November 2021. As expected, $ETH is showing decoupling signs and on the cusp of breaking $2k once again,\u201d the tweet reads."

        "content": "Cardano takes advantage of upper hand in lower fees compared to rival Ethereum.\n\nADA slips below key support level after struggling to find bullish momentum.\n\nThe crypto market is currently at a stage where a network\u2019s weakness may pave the way for another to thrive. The rivalry between Ethereum and Cardano is perhaps an ideal example of this, with the latter undercutting the former\u2019s user base.\n\nHow many are 1,10,100 ADAs worth today\n\nCardano is one of the top blockchain networks that is currently benefiting from the rising Ethereum gas fees. Investors are reportedly switching to the likes of Cardano which is a more cost-efficient network largely thanks to one key weapon in its arsenal. Cardano\u2019s hydra upgrade made the network more scalable.\n\nHere\u2019s a comparison of the fees collected on both networks. Ethereum fees have been growing exponentially in the last few days. This growth has partly been linked to increased network congestion due to the memecoin hype.\n\nMeanwhile, Cardano fees stood pale in comparison to Ethereum. While ETH fees recently peaked at $35 million, Cardano fees recently peaked at slightly above $13,000.\n\nGranted, the number of users on Cardano was much lower than those on Ethereum. Nevertheless, the fee surge on Ethereum still underpins a major downside as far as fees are concerned, hence the growing preference for Cardano.\n\nLet\u2019s look at other areas that underscore the growing preference for Cardano. Its daily active addresses have been growing in the last seven days confirming more network activity. Its social dominance metric registered increased excitement especially on 9 May, the same day that Ethereum gas fees peaked.\n\nADA bears prevail despite improving prospects\n\nADA has been lending favor to the bears for the last few days. It has notably been slipping below an ascending support line after failing to secure enough bullish momentum to support a pivot. As such, the growing wave of adoption has not been robust enough to shield ADA from the bears.\n\nWill the selling pressure continue? ADA\u2019s Money Flow Index (MFI) reverted to the downside in the last few days but at press time, it rested on its midpoint where it was likely to pivot. However, supply distribution still indicated mixed activity among the top addresses.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Cardano Profit Calculator\n\nWhales in the 10 million to 100 million range are worth keeping an eye on because they contributed most of the selling pressure. The same whale category leveled out in the last few days, indicating that the bulls might have a chance at redemption."

        "title": "Top 10 Ways to Reduce Ethereum Transaction Fees - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Let\u2019s find out what is ethereum transaction fees, and how can you save money on them\n\nEthereum transaction fees have been one of the most crucial issues for those who use the platform. Fees that consumers must pay for Ethereum transactions is called gas fees. The greater the fee, the quicker the transaction will be processed. However, gas prices can be an obstacle for some users, particularly those with modest transactions. Here are the top 10 ways to reduce ethereum transaction fees.\n\nUse Simulation Through DeFi Saver\n\nYou don\u2019t know the actual gas fee until you carry out the transaction and pay for the gas. However, you could use the DeFi Saver app to simulate your transactions. First, you\u2019ll create a recipe for Ethereum activities and then run it virtually.\n\nUse a Layer-2 Blockchain\n\nThe Ethereum Mainnet, also known as Layer One, is frequently congested, making transactions costly. Layer-two blockchains offer users the ability to scale up their transactions, and they do so by utilizing technologies such as Rollups and side chains.\n\nPick your transaction times carefully\n\nWhen it comes to Ethereum transaction fees, timing matters. According to gasprice.io, a handy resource for checking real-time gas fees, gas prices usually peak sometime between 8 a.m. and 1 p.m. Eastern Time. Saturdays and Sundays are usually the cheapest days to transact in ETH. A good rule of thumb is that the cheapest time to make ETH transactions is typically outside of working hours in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nUse DApps That Offer Rebates and Discounts\n\nOne of the easiest ways to avoid Ethereum gas fees is to use Ethereum projects and dApps that offer fee subsidies or nominal fees. If you are looking for such a platform, Balancer is a great one. The platform refunds the gas fees up to 90 percent in the form of BAL tokens. Balancer minimizes the gas fees for high-frequency traders by carrying out traders that don\u2019t leave the vault.\n\nSort Transaction Types\n\nDepending on the sort of transaction, the gas fee varies on the Ethereum blockchain. To save money on gas fees, users may wish to organize and implement similar transactions simultaneously. Consider that they have two Ethereum addresses, each containing 1,000 tokens. Now, if users intend to store all tokens in a new DApp\u2019s crypt in order to earn higher returns.\n\nCompare rates when buying ETH or ERC-20 tokens\n\nBitPay shows rates from multiple partners to make sure you get the best price when buying crypto. BitPay simplifies the process of buying Ethereum or ERC-20 tokens by showing multiple partner rates in one place. BitPay adds a \u201cBest Offer\u201d flag to help our customers sniff out the best deal presented by our marketplace partners.\n\nUtilize Gas Tokens\n\nIf you remove your storage variables on the blockchain, you can earn ETH and create gas tokens. This process forms the basis of gas tokenization. When the gas fees are low, you can mint a significant number of gas tokens. During the execution of your transaction on the blockchain, you can redeem your gas tokens for Ether, which can later be used to pay a gas fee.\n\nAssess Network Congestion to Plan Ahead\n\nFor time-sensitive transactions, keep an eye on the Gas Price by Time of Day chart on Ethereum Gas Charts to know the live pricing of gas fees based on the local timezone. Estimate the gas fee accurately and set the correct gas limit to avoid unnecessary fines.\n\nConsider alternative ETH scaling solutions\n\nPolygon (MATIC) is an alternative ETH scaling solution that offers a more affordable way to process transactions than the Ethereum network. It\u2019s an ideal option for frequent or large transactions as it\u2019s faster and more cost-effective than Ethereum\u2019s mainnet.\n\nOptimized smart contracts\n\nThe smart contract can be optimized, which is a less extreme method. However, the more complicated the smart contract, the higher the cost is. As a result, a smart contract should be as straightforward and concise as possible. Remove all unnecessary functions and examine the code to see if it can be reduced.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArbitrum (ARB), one of the most functional Ethereum-based Layer 2 scaling solutions, has shared an insight into its adopted mechanism for managing the fees generated on its platform. Taking to its official Twitter handle, Arbitrum said it is the \"only rollup that sends all surplus revenue generated by transaction fees to their respective DAO.\"\n\nFee generation model\n\nAccording to the insights shared by the protocol, all users on Arbitrum One pay a fee when transacting on the network. This fee is split into two components, including L1 fees for covering transactions on Ethereum and L2 fees for Arbitrum fees. Of these generated fees, it said surplus tokens are accumulated before it is sent to the DAO.\n\nAll users on Arbitrum One pay a fee when transacting on the network. The fee is split into two components:\n\n1. L1 fee to pay for costs on Ethereum.\n\n2. L2 fee to pay for costs on Arbitrum.\n\n\n\nSurplus L1 fees and all L2 fees accumulate on-chain before it is sent to the DAO. \u2014 Arbitrum (\ud83d\udc99,\ud83e\udde1) (@arbitrum) May 10, 2023\n\nWhile L1 fees are not expended immediately as the Sequencer covers the cost upfront before it is recovered later, a large portion of the L1 fee is reserved for the Sequencer.\n\nAt present, Arbitrum revealed that the total funds billed for the Sequencer are pegged at 5,954 ETH worth approximately $10.9 million. The surplus on this comes in at 582 ETH, which can be sent to the DAO.\n\nArbitrum also revealed that the L2 fees accumulated thus far come in at a total of 2770 ETH. As revealed, a total of 3,352 ETH is billed to be sent to the DAO as a reward after the Sequencer is refunded 5,954 ETH.\n\nHow does this Help ARB?\n\nWith the Arbitrum protocol promising to trigger a call that will push for the collection of the accumulated Ether tokens by the DAO, the price of ARB recorded a bullish uptick with more than 3% growth to $1.1229 at the time of writing.\n\nMembers of the Arbitrum community DAO will be the beneficiaries of this reward distribution when it is finally made. This can notably trigger an intense buy-up of ARB to open access for users to gain good rewards. This event has further extended the positive outlook of Arbitrum as a viable scaling tool on Ethereum."

The remaining funds will be allocated to relatively liquid listed companies, with a market cap of at least $250 million, that confirm to the overall \u201cprivacy theme.\u201d\n\nThese new announcements from Grayscale come amid growing uncertainty around its parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG), specifically, whether the firm can repay a $630 million debt obligation due this week."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nPudgy Penguins, an Ethereum NFT project that surged amid the 2021 bull run and then toppled into chaos, was purchased by a serial entrepreneur about a year ago and given a second life\u2014right as the market collapsed. But the cartoon birds have persevered, and now the team has raised funding as its ambitions grow.\n\nToday, Pudgy Penguins announced that it has raised $9 million in seed funding in a round led by early-stage investment firm 1kx, with participation from Big Brain Holdings, Kronos Research, Old Fashion Research, CRIT Ventures, and the founders of LayerZero Labs, per a release.\n\nThe project launched in July 2021, just as the NFT market started putting up billions of dollars\u2019 worth of trading volume each month, and Pudgy Penguins\u2019 rise was propelled in part by a viral story in The New York Times.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe\u2019re not waiting for mass adoption\u2026 We\u2019re creating it. May 18th. pic.twitter.com/FjCS0WgTtd \u2014 Pudgy Penguins (@pudgypenguins) May 7, 2023\n\nBut the initial buzz didn\u2019t last, and by early 2022, the community was in disarray amid controversy over a co-founder\u2019s past Web3 actions and plans by some NFT holders to break away by \u201cwrapping\u201d their Penguins as another token. Pudgy prices fell sharply amid the drama.\n\nLuca Netz, a serial entrepreneur, purchased the project IP outright from the founders in April 2022 for $2.5 million, and told Decrypt that Pudgy Penguins didn\u2019t have the millions of dollars\u2019 worth of funds that some NFTs projects and startups had banked during the bull run.\n\n\u201cWhen we bought it, we had no money in the bank,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we knew that.\u201d\n\nNetz said that Pudgy Penguins \u201cneeded a real operator\u201d to steer the ship. Soon after, however, overall NFT sales volume plummeted amid a crypto market crash, generating fewer creator royalties from secondary market sales and diminishing broader enthusiasm in the space. His team had to be \u201creally scrappy\u201d to grow the project amid those conditions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany NFT projects have lost considerable value over the last year. The Bored Ape Yacht Club, for example, fell from a peak starting price of about $429,000 (152 ETH) in late April 2022 to a current price of $82,600 (45 ETH). But Pudgy Penguins has bucked that trend, rising from $4,365 (1.55 ETH) to $8,170 (4.44 ETH) in the same span.\n\nAmid that market-defying growth, Pudgy Penguins has launched physical toy projects and other merch and built an advisory board with leaders from Meta and Hasbro. The project recently said that it signed with major Hollywood talent agency WME to pursue media projects and beyond, and it has generated some $250 million worth of total trading volume to date.\n\nAnd while those moves have set Pudgy Penguins up to explore mainstream plans, the project has also grown its cachet amongst NFT die-hards, no doubt helped in part by being one of the rare profile picture (PFP) projects that has actually gained value amid a broader freefall.\n\nWe\u2019re proud to announce that @WME will be representing us as our official talent agency.

        "content": "The Ethereum token has maintained a price above $1800 despite a crypto market drawdown in the last few days.\n\nWhile crypto prices remain slightly volatile, Tradecurve.io, a new project built on the Ethereum blockchain, has launched its presale. In the last 24 hours, the cryptocurrency market has declined by 3%. Notably, most Ethereum investors who bought the crypto asset this year are still in profit.\n\n>>Click Here To Register For The Tradecurve Presale<<\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and the largest DeFi project. While bullish traders have had their fun for most of the week, the price seemed set for a correction.\n\nAt the start of the week, Ethereum crossed the $2000 mark for the first time since last year. The slight breakout set the stage for a more positive upward move. Following Ethereum's break, Polygon, Arbitrum, and other Ethereum projects joined the party.\n\nETH's price chart. Source: Coinmarketcap\n\nEthereum's (ETH) Price Remains Strong Despite the Shapella Unlock\n\nWhile many other top cryptocurrencies have recorded notable gains this month, Ether's price seems to steal the show. On the 12th of April, the Shanghai and Capella (Shapella) upgrade on the Ethereum network went live. ETH validators eventually gained access to the locked tokens following the upgrade since staking started in December 2020.\n\nThe token lock resulted from the staking activity, which supported the smooth transition of the Ethereum network from the Proof of Work to the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Since lots of ETH tokens were to be unlocked, several ecosystem participants were concerned about the impact on price.\n\nInterestingly, the release of ETH did not lead to a huge sell-off or massive price dump. The Ethereum team regulated the situation by gradually scheduling the release of the staked tokens.\n\nFurther, the Shapella upgrade was perceived as an improvement to the network. With Ethereum still clinging to its broad vision of improving its scalability and decentralized level, more investors are drawn to the network. Surely, layer-two scaling protocols and cross-chain projects will support the network in achieving its goals.\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) - The hottest trading platform in DeFi\n\nThe Tradecurve team is building the next generation hybrid trading platform combining the best of centralized and decentralized exchanges and providing a one-stop shop for users to trade crypto, stocks, forex and commodities.\n\nTradecurve is set to revolutionize the multi-trillion dollar trading market with a cross-border permissionless platform where users will only require an email address and connect their wallet to begin trading, breaking down the barrier to entry for users worldwide.\n\nThe team has high aspirations for the project and will not be happy toppling platforms like OKB, Robin Hood App, Huobi. Their aim is to challenge established players like Binance, Coinbase and Kraken implement Proof of Reserves (PoR). Recent issues surrounding centralized exchanges have highlighted the trust that has been lost with traders, and the appetite for challengers like Tradecurve to emerge and provide a solution.\n\nTradecurve\u2019s native token TCRV, is available to purchase for $0.01. The price is expected to soar by 50X during its presale and possibly give investors 100X profits once launched.\n\nVisit Links Below For Info About Tradecurve Presale\n\nWebsite: https://tradecurve.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.tradecurve.io/sign-up\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/tradecurve_official"

        "content": "The burn is expected to destroy 100 quadrillion BABYDOGE tokens on the Ethereum network to bolster the project\u2019s security.\n\nThe Baby DogeCoin (BABYDOGE) team has submitted a proposal to burn up to 100 quadrillions of BABYDOGE tokens dormant on Ethereum since the project launched on the network last November. The proposal also seeks to reduce fees for BABYDOGE transactions on Ethereum to 0%.\n\nThe team unveiled the proposal today shortly after a Twitter poll suggested that the community agrees with the proposition. Although the poll consented to the proposition, a definite proposal is necessary to ensure that all formalities are observed.\n\n100 Quadrillion burn and 0% fee on ETH proposal is now live to be voted on by the DAO Vote here: https://t.co/bTWRzcaLmf\n\nOrhttps://t.co/ZEAKhKyJFg To spread awareness of the proposal we will give $500 USDT to 1 winner who: 1. Retweets this tweet\n\n2. Follows @BabyDogeCoin pic.twitter.com/ZzDfuMlG43 \u2014 Baby Doge (@BabyDogeCoin) May 9, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAccording to the proposal, the 100 quadrillion token burn is expected to help enhance the project\u2019s security and mitigate risks of unscrupulous individuals taking advantage of the tokens. The BABYDOGE team noted that the proposed move is in response to concerns raised by the community. The tokens to be burned are worth a whopping $209 million at current rates.\n\nThe BABYDOGE Burn Does not Involve Circulating Tokens.\n\nIt is important to note that although the tokens to be burned represent part of the asset\u2019s total supply, they are not actually in circulation. This indicates that the burn would have little to no effect on the babydoge price actions the way burns involving circulating tokens would. The primary objective of the burn is security enhancement.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNotably, the team plans to leave some BABYDOGE tokens on the Ethereum network to allow investors to continue to bridge their assets between the Ethereum network and Binance Smart Chain. If the community passes the proposal and the 100 quadrillion tokens are burned, this will leave 85 quadrillions of BABYDOGE on Ethereum for bridging.\n\nOnce the proposal passes, BABYDOGE fees on Ethereum will be adjusted to 0% in 24 hours. However, the monumental burn will occur much later, on June 1. The team stressed that the move poses one concern: the fact that if there is an issue with BNB Chain, not all the BABYDOGE tokens will move to Ethereum.\n\nIf the proposal passes, this will be the largest burn in history. Besides the proposed burn, the BABYDOGE team remains committed to periodic burns to reduce the asset\u2019s circulating supply. In March, the team burned one quadrillion tokens. The latest burn exercise involved 500 trillion BABYDOGE ($1.3 million) on May 2."

        "content": "Economist predicts Ethereum-based altcoin Jasmy to soar over 100 times its current value\n\nRenowned economist and Bitcoin supporter Henrik Zeberg has made predictions concerning the bullish course of cryptocurrencies for the remainder of the year. Zeberg believes that one particular Ethereum-based altcoin, Jasmy (JASMY), will reach new heights and has the potential to soar more than 100 times its present market value, stating that the overall cryptocurrency market is approaching a more optimistic phase, surpassing the previous bull market in 2021.\n\nJasmy is a Japan-based Internet of Things (IoT) project with the primary objective of joining blockchain and IoT technology in creating a secure and safe environment for data usage designed to benefit everyone. Jasmy is currently trading at $0.007, a substantial 99.8% decline from its peak value.\n\nZeberg's overall bullish stance on cryptocurrencies can be seen in his prediction that the cryptocurrency market's total capitalization could sway toward a whopping $4.4 trillion. This prediction for JASMY is consistent with the current market's status as we approach the end of the year.\n\nThe expert counters the widespread notion of an impending US economic recession, with a bullish macroeconomic outlook. Zeberg believes that with the Federal Reserve halting interest rate increases, risk assets such as cryptocurrencies are now due for a considerable upswing.\n\nAll the talk of upcoming euphoria has aroused excitement and optimism among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. In this time of uncertainty, the cryptocurrency market has displayed immense potential for growth and development in the long run.\n\nOther crypto analysts have stated on social media that the bear market of 2022 is soon over, and the continuous rally of Bitcoin and the rest of the altcoin market is well underway. However, their predictions can still be invalidated if black swan events occur.\n\nTokenPost | [email protected]"

        "title": "Understanding how core inflation affects Bitcoin and Ethereum and how Avorak helps traders profit - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "In today\u2019s volatile financial landscape, investors are not surprised to turn to alternative assets like cryptocurrencies for stability and growth. With the rise of Bitcoin and Ethereum, understanding the impact of inflation on these digital assets has become increasingly important. We\u2019ll explore the concepts of inflation, hyperinflation, and stagflation and how they affect Bitcoin and Ethereum. Additionally, we\u2019ll discuss how Avorak AI can help traders navigate these uncertain times and profit from the ever-changing crypto markets.\n\nInflation, Hyperinflation or Stagflation?\n\nInflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises, and subsequently, purchasing power is falling. Central banks attempt to limit inflation and avoid deflation to keep the economy running smoothly. However, in extreme cases, inflation can lead to hyperinflation or stagflation.\n\nHyperinflation occurs when a country experiences very high and usually accelerating inflation, eroding the real value of the local currency and causing the population to minimize their holdings of the currency. This can lead to losing confidence in the currency and shifting towards alternative assets like gold or cryptocurrencies.\n\nOn the other hand, stagflation is a situation where stagnant economic growth is accompanied by high inflation and high unemployment. This can be particularly challenging for policymakers, as they must balance efforts to stimulate the economy with the need to control inflation.\n\nRegarding Bitcoin and Ethereum, both cryptocurrencies have shown potential as alternative assets during times of economic uncertainty. They offer a decentralized and secure store of value that isn\u2019t tied to the traditional financial system. This makes them particularly attractive during times of inflation, hyperinflation, or stagflation, as they can potentially maintain their value better than traditional assets like stocks or bonds.\n\nHow the FED\u2019s Interest Rate Hikes affecting Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes can significantly impact the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. As the central bank raises interest rates, it becomes more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow money. This can slow economic growth, negatively affecting the value of stocks and other traditional assets.\n\nAs investors seek alternative investments, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum may become more attractive. However, it\u2019s important to note that cryptocurrencies are still relatively new and untested assets. Their value can be extremely volatile, and their long-term performance during periods of economic uncertainty still needs to be determined.\n\nThat said, some analysts believe that the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies may help protect them from the negative effects of central bank policies. Unlike traditional assets, which are often tied to a specific country or economic system, cryptocurrencies operate independently of any central authority. This means that the actions of central banks like the Federal Reserve don\u2019t directly influence their value.\n\nAs a result, some investors see cryptocurrencies as a potential hedge against the negative effects of inflation and interest rate hikes. However, it\u2019s important to remember that investing in cryptocurrencies carries significant risks, and their performance during periods of economic uncertainty is far from guaranteed.\n\nAvorak AI \u2013 Navigate Uncertain Financial Waters with Ease\n\nIn the face of economic uncertainty and volatile crypto markets, it can be challenging for traders to decide which assets to invest in. That\u2019s where Avorak AI comes in.

This can be particularly valuable during times of inflation or crisis when traditional financial indicators may be less reliable.\n\nIn addition to its AI-powered trading bots, Avorak also offers a range of other tools to help ease cumbersome tasks and enhance performance. These AI-powered tools include chatbots and image-generation modules.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nBy leveraging powerful AI Crypto tools like Avorak, traders can navigate the complex world of cryptocurrencies with greater confidence and insight.

The price of Bitcoin (BTC) was up 3% to $28,270 while Ethereum retested levels above $1,800 following recent dumps for the top two coins by market cap.\n\nElsewhere, US stocks turned green as Consumer Price Index (CPI) data showed inflation continued to cool, with the annual rate now at its slowest pace in two years.\n\nGains across equities and in the crypto major caps were also replicated in the medium and small cap altcoins. A notable upside was with the price of Kava (KAVA), which was up more than 11% as of 12:20 ET.\n\nBTC, ETH, KAVA price prediction: what next after CPI bump?\n\nBTC/USD\n\nBitcoin price had fallen below $28k this week following the large transaction volumes that hit the network and saw fees skyrocket. The congestion, attributable to the rise in BTC-20 tokens, forced crypto exchange Binance to halt BTC withdrawals on two occasions. The ensuing FUD pushed Bitcoin price lower.\n\nAlthough prices are above $28k again, market experts and analysts suggest bulls are not in control yet. This is because the price remains below the key technical level of $30,000. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital noted via a tweet :\n\nA #BTC relief rally into $28,200 followed by a strong rejection from there would likely precede bearish continuation for price$BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin \u2014 Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) May 10, 2023\n\nETH/USD\n\nEthereum is hovering above a key support level after this week\u2019s weakness. The ETH/USD pair fell to lows of $1,800 on Monday and saw four consecutive red candles on the daily timeframe before today\u2019s uptick.\n\nThe RSI and MACD suggest bears are still strong and bulls are likely to struggle for support at current prices. This means the $2,000 remains a key technical level and moving further off it could spell more bloodbath for ETH price. Here\u2019s an analyst\u2019s Ethereum price prediction?\n\n#Ethereum breached a key demand wall at $1,850-$1,905. Failure to regain this critical support zone may trigger a correction, potentially leading $ETH to the next significant demand area at $1,570-$1,630. pic.twitter.com/7s7q1LlF06 \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) May 9, 2023\n\nKAVA/USD\n\nKAVA is the native token of layer-1 blockchain Kava, which ranks as the 98th largest cryptocurrency by market. The price of KAVA hit the all-time high of $9.12 in August 2021. At current prices, its value is more than 90% down.\n\nHowever, increased ecosystem activity around DeFi on the Kava blockchain has aided the double digit gains seen in the past 24 hours. It\u2019s what pushed KAVA/USD towards the psychological $1.\n\nThe main barrier for KAVA remains the $1.12 zone, while bears could enjoy some bloodbath to $0.52."

        "content": "While the cryptocurrency sector is starting to show signs of recovery after the recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) data showed that the inflation in the United States had risen less than expected in April, Ethereum (ETH) is no exception, but the danger of correction still exists.\n\nAs it happens, Ethereum has reached an important demand wall at $1,850 \u2013 $1,905, which represents a critical support zone that the cryptocurrency needs to retain in order to avoid declining further, crypto market analyst Ali Martinez observed in a tweet shared on May 9.\n\nAccording to the expert:\n\n\u201cEthereum breached a key demand wall at $1,850-$1,905. Failure to regain this critical support zone may trigger a correction, potentially leading ETH to the next significant demand area at $1,570-$1,630.\u201d\n\nAs demonstrated on the IntoTheBlock graphic shared by Martinez, 2.36 million addresses have bought 8.37 million ETH at the above price range between $1,853.19 and $1,905.72. At the same time, 2.85 million addresses have bought 3.12 million ETH, paying between $1,571.46 and $1,628.76 apiece.\n\nAddresses that bought Ethereum between $1,572 and $2,130.

        "title": "Memecoins Resurgence Drives Up Ethereum Gas Fees to 12-Month High - Bitcoinsensus",
        "content": "Memecoins, created as a joke or a parody of established cryptocurrencies, have gained significant popularity in recent years due to social media and online communities. The well-known meme coin Dogecoin, which was created in 2013 and based on the Shiba Inu dog meme, saw its value soar over 6,000% in 2021 and briefly surpassed the market capitalization of some of the world\u2019s largest companies. Other popular memecoins include Shiba Inu and SafeMoon.\n\nMemecoins are unique due to their strong community backing, low transaction fees, and ease of trading on decentralized exchanges. However, they are also highly volatile, with their value rapidly rising and falling based on social media hype. Investing in memecoins can be high-risk, high-reward, and it is crucial to research and understand the risks involved.\n\nOverall, while some investors have made significant profits from meme coins like Dogecoin, others have lost money due to market volatility.\n\nAlso, the median gas fee on the Ethereum network has hit a 12-month high, coinciding with the resurgence of meme coins such as Pepe, Farb, King and so on. Gas fees are paid by users to execute transactions on the Ethereum network, and the increased demand for transactions has caused the fees to skyrocket. The surge in memecoin popularity has also led to increased trading volume on decentralized exchanges, further contributing to the higher gas fees.\n\nThe high gas fees on Ethereum have prompted some users to seek alternative blockchain networks with lower transaction fees. This has led to increased interest in other networks such as Arbitrum and Solana, which offer lower fees and faster transaction times. However, Ethereum still remains the most widely used blockchain network for decentralized applications and smart contracts."

        "title": "Avalanche vs. Ethereum: Which One Is More Promising? - Tycoonstory Media",
        "content": "The world of cryptocurrencies is an exciting and ever-evolving space. With new coins and tokens being introduced regularly, it can be challenging to keep up with the latest trends and innovations. Two of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the market today are Avalanche (AVAX) and Ethereum (ETH). Both of these platforms offer unique features and benefits, making it difficult to choose which one is more promising. In this article, we will take a closer look at Avalanche and Ethereum and compare them based on various factors to help you make an informed decision. If you want to invest in bitcoins then you can visit online trading platforms like https://bitqt-app.com/\n\nOverview of Avalanche and Ethereum\n\nAvalanche is a decentralized platform that aims to provide a faster, more scalable, and secure network for developers to build decentralized applications (dApps). It was launched in September 2020 and has gained significant attention from the crypto community due to its high-speed and low-cost transactions.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum is the most popular blockchain platform for building decentralized applications and smart contracts. It was launched in 2015 and has a vast ecosystem of developers and users who have built numerous projects on its network.\n\nTransaction Speed\n\nTransaction speed is a crucial factor in the world of cryptocurrencies, especially for developers building dApps that require fast and efficient transactions. Avalanche has a significant advantage over Ethereum in terms of transaction speed, as it can process up to 4,500 transactions per second (TPS) compared to Ethereum\u2019s 15 TPS. This makes Avalanche a more suitable platform for building high-performance dApps that require fast and efficient transactions.\n\nScalability\n\nScalability is another crucial factor to consider when choosing a blockchain platform. Ethereum has been facing scalability issues due to its limited capacity to process transactions. This has led to high gas fees and slower transaction times, making it difficult for developers to build scalable dApps. Avalanche, on the other hand, has a unique architecture that allows it to scale its network according to demand, making it more suitable for building scalable dApps.\n\nSecurity\n\nSecurity is a critical factor when it comes to blockchain platforms. Ethereum is a well-established platform that has been battle-tested over the years, making it one of the most secure blockchain platforms in the market. However, Avalanche also offers robust security features, such as Avalanche-X, a consensus mechanism that ensures network security by allowing users to choose their validators.\n\nTokenomics\n\nTokenomics is another important factor to consider when comparing cryptocurrencies. Ethereum\u2019s native token is Ether (ETH), which is used to pay for gas fees on the network. Ether is also used as a store of value and a means of exchange. Avalanche\u2019s native token is AVAX, which is used to pay for gas fees on the network and also used as a governance token to vote on protocol upgrades and network changes.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, both Avalanche and Ethereum have unique features and benefits that make them promising blockchain platforms. Avalanche\u2019s high-speed transactions, scalability, and security make it a more suitable platform for building high-performance dApps that require fast and efficient transactions. Ethereum\u2019s vast ecosystem, battle-tested security, and established reputation make it a more reliable platform for developers who want to build complex decentralized applications.\n\nUltimately, the choice between Avalanche and Ethereum depends on your specific needs and requirements. If you are a developer looking to build high-performance dApps that require fast and efficient transactions, then Avalanche may be the better option. However, if you value security, reliability, and an established ecosystem, then Ethereum may be the better choice."

        "title": "Ethereum Locked Reaches All-Time High As ETH Struggles To Rally - CoinChapter",
        "content": "Ethereum locked reaches all-time high, but ETH price struggles to rally\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nStaked ETH reached a new all-time high despite Ethereum\u2019s latest update\n\nBulls struggled to revive the token price rally.\n\nNEW DELHI (CoinChapter.com) \u2014 Ethereum\u2019s latest Shanghai update had sparked fears of ETH tokens flooding the markets as stakers moved to book profits after withdrawing their staked tokens. However, it seems the fears were unwarranted.\n\nIn a post, blockchain analysis firm Nansen shared that the amount of locked ETH had reached a new ATH of 19.3 million tokens. The firm noted that the withdrawal frenzy following the Shapella update became insignificant in the longer timeframe.\n\nLocked ETH refers to Ether tokens staked on the Beacon chain, ETH that is \u201cout of circulation,\u201d rewards on the Beacon chain, and \u201cETH deposited to the Beacon contract but not validating yet,\u201d as per Nansen.\n\nNansen shared that locked ETH reached a new record high.\n\nInterestingly, the current amount of ETH locked on the Beacon chain is equivalent to the amount during the Shapella update, suggesting the net impact of withdrawals has been zero. Furthermore, full withdrawals overtook partial withdrawals.\n\nPartial withdrawals involve accrued awards, while full withdrawals are withdrawals of the entire 32 ETH balance necessary to become a validator on the blockchain. To enable withdrawals, validators must set their withdrawal credential prefixes to 0x01 from 0x00.\n\nFull withdrawals have overtaken partial withdrawals post the Ethereum Shanghai update\n\nFull withdrawals now represent 59.2% of the total ETH withdrawal. An increase in full withdrawals suggests exiting validators now make up most of the withdrawal. Meanwhile, Kraken has one of the highest withdrawal volumes.\n\nThe exchange accounted for nearly 26.3% of all withdrawals, with users withdrawing 647,000 ETH. However, Kraken\u2019s contribution might be due to the recent regulatory crackdown, which forced the exchange to shutter its staking operations.\n\nETH Price Forms Bullish Pattern\n\nETH price has been moving inside a bullish technical pattern called the \u2018Ascending Triangle.\u2019\n\nA horizontal trendline that connects swing highs and an ascending trendline connecting swing lows forms the pattern. Volume helps determine if a breakout is strong.\n\nETH price formed a bullish pattern with a 109% price target. Source: Tradingview.com\n\nIn an ideal world, buyers would enter the market as the trendlines close the gap, pushing prices above horizontal resistance with heavy volumes. Unfortunately, a low-volume breakout on the upside will likely fail, resulting in a pullback.\n\nPer the rules of technical analysis, the price target for a breakout is equal to the triangle\u2019s height at its thickest point. Therefore, ETH price might rise to $3,862 after confirming the pattern, a jump of 109% from its current price levels.\n\nEther Price Struggled To Start A Rally\n\nLocked ETH reaching a new record high should ideally be bullish for the Ether token\u2019s price since it means a lesser supply of ETH in the market. A decline in supply often helps a digital asset start a bullish rally.\n\nHowever, ETH price remained decidedly bearish. The Ethereum token extended its downtrend that began on May 6, falling nearly 9% from May 6\u2019s high of $2,021 to form a daily low of $1,843 on May 9.\n\nMoreover, bulls failed to defend the 50-day EMA (purple wave) support level. If the downtrend continues, ETH price might drop to test the immediate support level near $1,810, the Ether token has tested multiple times since April 4.\n\nETHUSD daily chart with MACD. Source: Tradingview.com\n\nMoreover, breaching the immediate support level could force ETH price below its 100-day EMA (blue wave) to test support near $1,715.\n\nTrend-based momentum oscillator MACD continues to be bearish for ETH. The MACD histogram indicates that the MACD line (difference of 12-day and 26-day EMA) is moving away from its MACD signal line (9-day EMA of MACD).\n\nHence, a divergence in MACD lines might indicate market participants remained divided.\n\nConversely, an uptrend would require bulls to force ETH above its 20-day EMA (red wave) resistance near $1,910. Additionally, breaking and consolidating above its immediate resistance level could help the Ethereum token price rise to target resistance near $2,020 before retreating."
