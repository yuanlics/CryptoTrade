        "content": "Ethereum price struggled to rise above $2,550 and $2,580. ETH started a fresh decline like Bitcoin and traded below the $2,500 support zone.\n\nEthereum attempted a fresh increase but failed to surpass $2,550.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,480 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair continue to move down if there is a move below the $2,425 support.\n\nEthereum Price Extends Decline\n\nEthereum price struggled to gain pace for a move above the $2,550 and $2,580 resistance levels. ETH formed a short-term top and started a fresh decline below $2,500 like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a move below the $2,450 level. A new weekly low was formed near $2,424 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the $2,450 level, but the bears were active near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,614 swing high to the $2,424 low.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $2,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,465 level. The next hurdle could be $2,480. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,480 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nThe next major resistance is now near $2,520. A clear move above the $2,520 level might start a decent increase. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $2,580 level.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next key hurdle sits near the $2,620 zone. A close above the $2,620 resistance could start another steady increase. The next key resistance is near $2,680. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2,720 zone.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,520 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,440 level.\n\nThe next key support could be the $2,425 zone. A downside break below the $2,425 support might send the price further lower. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,350 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,320 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,425\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,520\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Top analyst and crypto commentator who goes by @hedge__x on X (formerly Twitter) is sure that Ethereum (ETH) has all chances to outshine Bitcoin (BTC) in the coming bull run.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Max pain for Bitcoin Dominance\": Trader skeptical about Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency, is going to set a new all-time high in this cycle. However, even over $100,000 per BTC, it will be disappointing for many Bitcoiners, @hedge__x shared on Jan. 19 on his X.\n\nCorn is going higher this cycle but many will be disappointed at $100k peak.\n\n\n\nETH has much more upside potential w many more future catalyst including ETF.\n\n\n\nMax pain for BTC.D. Max gain for Total2. \u2014 Hedgex.eth (@hedge__x) January 19, 2024\n\nBy contrast, Ethereum (ETH) has way more impressive upside potential compared to the orange coin. Among other catalysts, Ethereum (ETH) has possible ETF approval ahead. This might be an amazing catalyst for the next ETH rally.\n\nIt should be noted that Ethereum (ETH) is getting closer to EIP-4844 or Proto-Danksharding upgrade activation. It is set to change the game in L2s and make them more resource-efficient.\n\nAs such, the analyst is positive about the potential of Total2, an indicator of cumulative cryptocurrency markets capitalization excluding Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nThe Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) indicator is due to go through \"maximum pain,\" the trader concluded.\n\nLegal status of Ether is crucial for ETH ETF approval\n\nIn January 2024, Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) is losing momentum. After registering a local high over 55% on Jan. 9, it lost 7.5% (4.6 points) in less than 10 days.\n\nEthereum ETF is one of the most anticipated events for the cryptocurrency segment in 2024. The community and experts are moderately optimistic about its potential approval.\n\nHowever, the court processes between the U.S. SEC and crypto exchanges over illegal securities offering might affect the timeline of the ETH ETF approval.\n\nTogether with other large-cap altcoins, Ether is one of the tokens the SEC claimed to be unregistered securities."

        "content": "Fidelity\u2019s quest to launch a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) has hit a regulatory roadblock as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) extended its decision window.\n\nFidelity\u2019s Wise Origin Ethereum Trust, if approved, is a fund that would track the performance of Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. It would allow investors to gain exposure to digital assets without directly owning them.\n\nAccording to James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg, the SEC may choose to approve a batch of spot Ethereum ETFs as it did with Bitcoin. Seyffart pointed to May 23 as the next key date, the deadline for the regulator\u2019s decision on VanEck\u2019s Ethereum ETF application.\n\nThe SEC approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs last week, allowing such funds to be traded for the first time in the U.S. Before the approvals, the SEC rejected all spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nEther price outshined Bitcoin\u2019s price following the approvals surging past US$2,600 for the first time since May 2022, CoinGecko data shows. Ether has since fallen, losing 7% over the past week to US$2,436 at 12:30 p.m. ET. Bitcoin dropped 6.4% in the same period to trade at US$40,642.\n\nFidelity\u2019s Bitcoin ETF, one the funds that received the SEC\u2019s green light last week, crossed the US$1 billion today, becoming the second to do so, The Block reported."

        "content": "The spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) obtained approval earlier this month. Now with Bitcoin being more accessible to the general public, investors are hopeful that the cryptocurrency can continue to build on the gains it has accumulated in recent months.\n\nAnd it may not be too long before another popular cryptocurrency follows in its footsteps. Ethereum (ETH 1.24%) may soon have its own spot ETF coming.\n\nA decision on Ethereum could come as early as May\n\nNow that the spot Bitcoin ETF has obtained approval, crypto enthusiasts turn to what may seem like an inevitability: The approval of a spot Ethereum ETF. Ethereum is the second most popular cryptocurrency with a market cap of $305 billion, which is less than half of Bitcoin's value of $843 billion.\n\nMultiple companies have made applications for a spot Ether ETF, including BlackRock and Ark. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to make a decision by May.\n\nEthereum's value has been rising over the past year along with Bitcoin, as enthusiasm for greater acceptance of crypto is generally a good sign for both digital currencies. Investors were buying up Bitcoin in anticipation of an expected approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF, and the same may be happening with Ethereum as well, as its value has also been spiking in recent weeks.\n\nWhy approval may not come until much later\n\nWhile there is excitement that a spot Ethereum ETF may soon be available as well, not everyone is convinced that is a sure thing. According to TD Cowen, an approval is unlikely to happen by May. And it may not even happen until after the U.S. federal election.\n\nThe rationale for this is that the investment bank believes that \"the SEC will want to gain experience from Bitcoin\" before it approves another token, whether it is for Ethereum or any other coin.\n\nInvestors shouldn't be concerned\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are the two big names in crypto, and their trajectories have been fairly similar over the past year, as both have moved in similar directions. While Bitcoin has generated the stronger returns due to its recent approval, a spot Ethereum approval may not be too far away, either. Whether it happens in May or even next year, it would appear unlikely for regulators to only approve one of the major cryptocurrencies and no others.\n\nThe SEC took its time (more than two years) in approving a spot Bitcoin ETF. So if it takes a bit of time in analyzing the rollout before approving the spot Ethereum ETF, that may not be all that surprising. What's important is that investors factor this into their expectations and not get their hopes up too high in May, in case the spot Ethereum ETF approval doesn't come through.\n\nIs now a good time to invest in Ethereum?\n\nIf you're bullish on crypto, now may be a good time to add some exposure to Ethereum. Even if it takes a little longer than expected, approval of a spot Ethereum ETF looks highly probable. And with Ethereum's gains lagging behind Bitcoin over the past year, there could be more potential upside for the cryptocurrency once the approval takes place.\n\nThere is the risk of volatility, as is always the case with any cryptocurrency, but with regulators taking a more positive view of digital currencies and approving a spot Bitcoin ETF, the outlook is as promising as ever for crypto. As long as you're OK with the risk that comes with it, now may be an optimal time to buy Ether."

In their proposal, they highlighted a court ruling from the previous year, where judges criticized the SEC for not providing a clear rationale for rejecting spot crypto ETFs while permitting futures-based equivalents.\n\nFIDELITY FILES FOR ETHEREUM ETF Source: DB | Coins: ETH \u2014 db (@tier10k) November 17, 2023\n\nWith the extended deadline, the SEC now has more time to thoroughly consider Fidelity\u2019s proposal.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart anticipated the SEC\u2019s recent decision to postpone the review of Fidelity\u2019s proposed Ethereum (ETH) ETF. He said : \u201cCompletely expected. The significant dates are likely in late May.\u201d\n\nFidelity #ethereum ETF delayed just now. Completely expected. Dates that really matter are late May in my view. https://t.co/8mvhcPRaS7 \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 18, 2024\n\nThe approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC last week has fueled speculation about the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF. Following in the footsteps of BlackRock, Fidelity entered the competition for a spot Ethereum ETF last year, shortly after the launch of ether futures ETFs.\n\nStuart Barton, co-founder at Volatility Shares, said:\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s approval of futures-based ETFs suggests they view ether similarly to bitcoin, likely not considering it a security and thus not regulating it as such.\u201d\n\nEthereum\u2019s Emerging Role in Mainstream Finance\n\nEthereum, a cornerstone in the realm of blockchain technology, is not just a digital currency. Its appeal lies in its work with decentralized applications (DApps), which Fidelity seeks to harness through its proposed Ethereum ETF. This fund was envisioned not merely as an investment tool, but as a means to diversify the crypto landscape and integrate Ethereum into mainstream finance.\n\nIs ETH next for an ETF? The market seems to think sohttps://t.co/zKFl7o8Lse \u2014 CCN (@CCNDotComNews) January 11, 2024\n\nHowever, the market harbors varied opinions.

It signifies a critical juncture for the entire cryptocurrency sector. Ethereum, in particular, has been displaying signs of growing influence, occasionally outperforming Bitcoin. The excitement over upcoming network upgrades, such as the Dencun hard fork, has amplified this positive outlook.\n\nCathie Wood expects #Ethereum will most likely outperform Bitcoin in the next Bull Run. pic.twitter.com/FEK9YAIZWo \u2014 Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) January 15, 2024\n\nSantiment, an on-chain analytics firm, has noted a rise in Ethereum\u2019s market dominance.

        "content": "After a year of underperformance in 2023, the ETH/BTC dominance will grow this year on the backdrop of Dencun upgrade and other contributing factors within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nIn the year 2023, Ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, faced a period of underperformance compared to Bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin\u2019s newfound narrative centered around smart contracts, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and optimism surrounding a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) drew significant investor interest. Analysts now suggest a potential reevaluation of Ether in 2024, given Ethereum\u2019s continued status as the leading smart contract blockchain globally, coupled with upcoming key upgrades. Analysts also see Ether as a strong contender for the next spot-based ETF in the United States.\n\nIn a recent weekly newsletter, Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase expressed optimism, stating that \u201cETH could be poised for a breakout year.\u201d The impact of last week\u2019s Bitcoin ETF news proved beneficial for Ethereum, causing a brief spike above $2,700, marking its highest price since May 2022. Further optimism for ETH\u2019s near-term future arises from the fact that firms behind Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock and VanEck, are actively considering Ethereum-based spot ETFs.\n\nA spot ETF involves actual cryptocurrency investment, offering exposure to the asset without direct ownership. This is a favorable alternative to futures-based ETFs, which are susceptible to roll costs. The potential launch of spot ETH ETFs is likely to unleash a flood of institutional and retail investment, mirroring the success observed with nearly a dozen Bitcoin spot ETFs that commenced trading in the US last Thursday. These Bitcoin ETFs have collectively recorded a cumulative volume exceeding $10 billion, with BlackRock\u2019s product amassing an impressive $1 billion in inflows.\n\nEthereum Dencun Upgrade and Its Effect on ETH in 2024\n\nCoinbase reports that Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Dencun upgrade, designed to enhance the mainnet\u2019s scalability through the introduction of \u201cdata blobs,\u201d has the potential to ignite investor interest in the cryptocurrency. The upgrade recently went live on Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade introduces \u201cdata blobs\u201d, which are temporary transaction data memories typically associated with Layer 2 solutions. These can be attached to Ethereum. Thus, following the mainnet upgrade, the network will only need to confirm the correctness of the blob data attached to the block, reducing congestion and network fees.\n\nCoinbase notes that the Dencun upgrade, currently undergoing initial tests, is likely to implement Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844 in the coming months. Some Ethereum observers predict that this proposal could significantly decrease network fees by 90% or more.\n\nETH/BTC Growing Dominance\n\nIn its annual report, institutional crypto firm ETC Group expresses a bullish outlook for the ether-bitcoin ratio. Despite Bitcoin\u2019s surge in network activity in 2023, Ethereum continues to dominate as the preferred chain for decentralized applications, NFTs, and tokenized assets.\n\nETC Group\u2019s data reveals that the top 10 ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum have a combined market value of $21 billion, surpassing the $1.6 billion market capitalization of the entire BRC-20 token universe on the Bitcoin network. ERC-20 represents Ethereum\u2019s token standard, while BRC-20 signifies a fungible digital asset on the Bitcoin network.\n\nAdditionally, in 2024, Ethereum investors can generate extra returns by staking or locking their coins on the network, earning rewards at an annualized rate of around 3.84%. Ethereum\u2019s feature of burning a portion of transaction fees paid in ETH further contributes to a deflationary effect on the token\u2019s supply, positively impacting investors.\n\nETC Group emphasizes Ethereum\u2019s strong dominance in smart contract platforms and the potential for additional yield, stating that Ethereum should be a core holding in a diversified crypto asset portfolio. The report anticipates a reversal in the relative performance of ETH/BTC in 2024, citing historical trends of mean reversion in the 12-month relative performance of these two cryptocurrencies."

        "content": "Explore Ethereum Name Service (ENS) future prospects, its growth and the evolving role in the web3 and crypto space.\n\nRecently, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has seen a remarkable surge in its market performance, capturing the crypto community\u2019s attention. This surge is closely linked to ENS domains\u2019 growing popularity and utility within the crypto ecosystem.\n\nIn early Jan. 2024, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin highlighted the importance of ENS in the broader Ethereum landscape, prompting a notable boost in trading activity surrounding the ENS token price.\n\nAs of Jan. 19, the ENS token is valued at around $19, a notable increase from its all-time low of $6.70 in Oct. 2023.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s essential to note that the ENS token is currently rebounding from a significant decline. Previously, in November 2021, the ENS token reached its peak value at $85.69.\n\nENS price | Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe current market activity around ENS tokens and domains suggests a renewed interest and optimism in ENS within the crypto space.\n\nLet\u2019s dive deeper into ENS and try to understand what it is, how it works, and how it could impact crypto and Ethereum in 2024.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Name Service (ENS)?\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a vital component in the ENS blockchain ecosystem, providing a user-friendly interface to the otherwise complex and technical blockchain addresses.\n\nENS\u2019s primary function is to convert complex Ethereum addresses, which are typically long strings of numbers and letters, into human-readable names.\n\nThis service resembles the Domain Name System (DNS) used on the internet but is tailored for the decentralized nature of the blockchain.\n\nConsider a scenario where you want to receive Ethereum (ETH) as payment. Traditionally, this transaction would require you to share your Ethereum wallet address. These addresses are typically a string of 42 hexadecimal characters, which can be complex and prone to errors when shared or entered.\n\nFor instance, an Ethereum address might look something like this:\n\n0x6310ae27e35D2d850eE1913E0447c0cc85Eb1Cdf\n\nThis is where the ENS cryptocurrency becomes invaluable. ENS resolves the challenge of remembering and correctly using these complex addresses.\n\nInstead of relying on the long string of characters, ENS allows users to represent their Ethereum address with a simple, memorable name.\n\nSo, instead of sharing a string of characters, you can simply use an ENS domain like garygensler.eth.\n\nThis transformation significantly reduces the risk of errors in transactions and makes the process of sending and receiving digital assets more user-friendly.\n\nYou might also like: Web3 breaks ground with the convenience of a consumer-centric approach | Opinion\n\nHow does ENS work?\n\nENS operates using two key smart contracts: the ENS registry and resolvers.\n\nThe ENS registry maintains a list of all domains and subdomains, storing crucial information like the domain owner, the domain resolver, and the caching time for records under the domain.\n\nThe resolvers, on the other hand, are responsible for the actual process of translating names into addresses and vice versa.\n\nENS enhances security and reduces the risk of errors in transactions. It is more resistant to censorship and hacking attacks compared to traditional DNS due to its decentralized nature.\n\nFurthermore, ENS domains have increased in value and popularity, with shorter names being particularly rare and sought after.\n\nGetting an ENS domain is relatively simple: you can check for availability and register a domain through their website. The cost of obtaining and maintaining an ENS domain includes auction costs for popular names and an annual renewal fee, payable in Ethereum.\n\nENS governance is community-driven through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), where ENS token holders can submit proposals and vote on decisions affecting the protocol.\n\nThese tokens are used for protocol governance and influence decisions on pricing and other operational aspects.\n\nUse cases of ENS\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service (ENS) offers several practical use cases besides transforming complex Ethereum addresses into user-friendly domain names. These include:\n\nDecentralized websites: ENS enables the launch of censorship-resistant websites on decentralized networks like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). This feature is especially important for content creators and businesses seeking to establish an online presence immune to centralized control or censorship\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nIdentity management on the blockchain: ENS allows users to attach personal information, such as an email address or an avatar, to their ENS username. This capability could make ENS-enabled usernames a primary digital identity on the web, enhancing the way we interact online\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nSubdomain creation: ENS domain owners have the flexibility to create subdomains. These subdomains can be used for various purposes, including directing to smart contracts, transactions, or metadata. This feature offers a level of customization and control that can be particularly useful for businesses and developers operating in the blockchain ecosystem\u200b\u200b.\n\nEnhanced security and transparency: The decentralized nature of ENS, being built on the Ethereum blockchain, makes it more secure and less susceptible to hacking compared to traditional DNS systems. This enhanced security is critical for users and businesses that prioritize the safety of their digital identities and transactions\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nWhat to expect from ENS in 2024?\n\nBased on the current trajectory and emerging patterns in the ENS cryptocurrency markets, here\u2019s an analysis of what to expect:\n\nGrowth in registrations and renewals\n\nENS has demonstrated a strong performance in recent months, with significant growth in domain registrations and renewals.\n\nThis trend could likely continue into 2024, fueled by the increasing perception of ENS domains as valuable digital assets.\n\nThe growth in registrations, especially for more affordable 4+ character domains, indicates a broadening user base. Renewals of exclusively priced shorter names also suggest a strong, loyal user base within the ENS ecosystem\u200b\n\nIncreasing integration and adoption\n\nThe integration of ENS into various blockchain platforms and services like decentralized apps (dapps) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) could progress.\n\nAs ENS simplifies the user experience in the Ethereum-based web, its adoption could rise, especially among new users entering the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThe adoption rate could be a significant factor driving the ENS crypto price and the utility of the service.\n\nENS\u2019s role in web3 and digital identity\n\nENS\u2019s importance in the web3 space could also grow. Its role in linking human-readable names to blockchain assets positions it as a useful element for web3 identity protocols.\n\nThis utility extends beyond mere address simplification and plays into broader themes of digital identity and decentralized internet.\n\nFuture trajectory\n\nAs Ethereum continues to grow, the ENS is poised to expand alongside it. The increasing adoption of Ethereum for various applications, including decentralized finance (defi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), could drive more users towards ENS for easier and more secure interactions on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nCurrently, around 2.1 million .eth ENS names have been registered.\n\nENS stats for December 2023:\n\n\u2013 23.4k new .eth registrations (currently 2.1m names)\n\n\u2013 $1.36m in protocol revenue -all goes to the @ENS_DAO\n\n\u2013 18k new eth accounts w/ at least 1 ENS name (total 800k)\n\n\u2013 16.8k primary names set (total 701k)\n\n\u2013 4600 avatar records set (total 143k) pic.twitter.com/UjLcDLayja \u2014 ens.eth (@ensdomains) January 2, 2024\n\nAs the Ethereum ecosystem evolves with the latest Dencun upgrade, ENS could play a strong role in enhancing user experience and accessibility, potentially leading to broader adoption and integration within the blockchain space\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow to buy an ENS domain? To buy an ENS domain, you\u2019ll need to follow a series of steps:\n\nAcquire ETH: First, you need to have ETH in your account since ENS domains are purchased with ETH. You can buy ETH through centralized and decentralized exchanges.\n\nSet up a crypto wallet: Next, you\u2019ll need a crypto wallet that supports Ethereum, like MetaMask. This wallet is where your ENS domain will point to and is necessary for interacting with the ENS system.\n\nConnect to the ENS dApp: With ETH in your wallet, navigate to the ENS dapp (app.ens.domains). Connect your wallet to the dApp.\n\nChoose your ENS domain: Search for your desired domain name in the ENS dApp. If it\u2019s available, you can proceed with the purchase. If it\u2019s already taken, you might have to look for alternatives or buy it on the secondary market.\n\nComplete the purchase: Follow the instructions in the dApp to register and purchase your domain. This process will include paying the registration fee and any applicable gas fees. Why buy an ENS token? Purchasing ENS token can be a strategic move for those looking to participate in the governance of the ENS protocol. Holding ENS token allows users to vote on key decisions and contribute to the development of the ENS ecosystem. However, it\u2019s essential to exercise caution. Like any cryptocurrency investment, ENS token is subject to market volatility, which can lead to significant price fluctuations. You should conduct thorough research, consider the inherent risks of crypto investments, and only invest what you can afford to lose.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "Why Experts Foresee Solana (SOL) Outshining Ethereum (ETH) By 500% In the Next Bull Run - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe co-founders of leading crypto analytics firm Glassnode, Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, foresee Solana (SOL) outperforming Ethereum (ETH) by a staggering 500% in the next bull run.\n\nThe duo who operate under the X account \u201cNegentropic\u201d recently shared their optimistic outlook on Solana\u2019s potential ascent. Notably, their perspective was inspired by a recent interview featuring macroeconomist Henrik Zeberg and Global Macroinvestor CEO Raoul Pal, where the discussion centered around the potential for a remarkable rally in the SOL/ETH chart.\n\nNotably, the interview host asked Pal and Zeberg about their crypto preferences for a $10,000 investment over a 12-month period, specifically focusing on Ethereum and Solana in terms of risk-adjusted returns.\n\nPal and Zeberg, examining Solana\u2019s recent performance trend, expressed strong confidence in its significant momentum. They anticipated Solana maintaining its upward trajectory, surpassing Ethereum, as indicated by the SOL/ETH chart.\n\nThat said, Glassnode\u2019s co-founders delved into Pal and Zeberg\u2019s analysis to answer the intriguing question of how much Solana could potentially outperform Ethereum. According to insights from Glassnode\u2019s analytics, the current SOL/ETH ratio stands at around 0.14, and the co-founders anticipate a substantial increase in the ratio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe all watched Zebergand and Paul talking about SOL-ETH ratio. They both agreed it looks BULLISH. But \u2013 just how much could the ratio rally? This chart suggests, that the SOL/ETH ratio could rise to ~0.76 from current level of ~0.14. In other words, SOL may outperform ETH by 4-5X into the Crypto top.\u201d Negentropic remarked.\n\nContrary to an isolated rally for SOL, the market experts also anticipated a significant bullish rally for Ethereum.\n\nThat said, following a remarkable surge last month that propelled it to reach an impressive $126, SOL has experienced a subsequent retracement attributed to profit-taking by investors and the broader market downturn, particularly influenced by Bitcoin\u2019s performance after the spot BTF approval.\n\nHowever, despite this setback, bullish sentiments surrounding Solana remain notably high. In a Friday tweet, analyst \u201cCrypto Simon\u201d noted that the SOL/USDT price chart is signalling a potential breakout from its descending channel, suggesting a shift towards an upward trend. He further highlighted a high probability of a bullish movement originating from the support level around $98, with SOL poised to target resistance levels near $128.\n\nAt press time of the latest update, Solana was trading at $89.31, reflecting a 6.36 % decline over the past 24 hours. Ethereum, on the other hand, was trading at $2,438 after experiencing a similar 3.8% decrease during the same timeframe. Despite this decline, Solana\u2019s one-year trajectory remains notably robust at 340.43%, surging from around $20. In contrast, Ethereum\u2019s one-year trajectory is comparatively lower at 60.72%, indicating growth from $1,500."

        "content": "The debates over Ethereum's classification \u2013 commodity or security \u2013 further complicates the scenario, with contrasting views on the SEC's stance.\n\nEthereum, often regarded as the silver to Bitcoin's gold, is currently under the spotlight for a potential breakthrough \u2013 the approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nWith a surge in investor enthusiasm in the manner of the excitement surrounding Bitcoin in 2023, the anticipation is apparent. Notably, even BlackRock is interested in offering a spot in Ethereum ETF.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has set a timetable, targeting May 2024, for the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nIn the months leading up to the SEC decision, the market is abuzz with predictions of Ethereum prices. But when can we expect the approval of spot Ethereum ETF?\n\n\u200d\n\nJPMorgan's Take on Approval Probability\n\nJPMorgan estimates the probability of the SEC approving the ETF by May to be no more than 50%. As per a report from The Block, a notable indicator of this uncertainty is the discount to net asset value (NAV) for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), hovering around 12% over the past two months. The SEC's decision not to mention Ethereum in its recent lawsuit against crypto exchanges has ignited debates within the crypto community.\n\nSome argue that this silence may indicate an imminent classification of Ethereum as a commodity, a prerequisite for spot ETF approval. However, JPMorgan analysts remain skeptical, questioning the significance of the SEC's approval of ether futures-based ETFs in September last year.\n\n\u200d\n\nMark Yusko's Perspective\n\nMark Yusko, co-founder and CEO of Morgan Creek Capital, offers a skeptical perspective. Despite a 70% chance, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, Yusko believes the SEC is unlikely to approve a spot Ether ETF in 2024.\n\nIn an interview with CoinTelegraph, Yusko points to the SEC's persisting hostility toward cryptocurrencies, as indicated by the agency's head, Gary Gensler, on the day of the recent Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nThe overarching skepticism of the SEC toward cryptocurrencies remains a significant obstacle. Yusko adds another layer, suggesting that the SEC may still regard Ethereum as a security, unlike Bitcoin, which enjoys the classification of a commodity.\n\n\u200d\n\nComparing Ethereum and Bitcoin\n\nEthereum stands as the second-largest player with a market cap of $299 billion, yet still less than half of Bitcoin's staggering $809 billion value.\n\nDrawing parallels with the recent Bitcoin ETF approval, investors are exhibiting a similar trend with Ethereum. The anticipation of a spot Ethereum ETF approval is prompting a surge in Ethereum's value, aligning with the broader bullish sentiment in the crypto market.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is trading at $2484, up, 11.5% in a month."

The native token of Ethereum\u2019s market-leading smart contract blockchain stands ready to ride catalysts both technical and regulatory to outshine bitcoin\u2019s gains this year.\n\nTLDR\n\nEther could break out in 2024 as spot ETF narrative builds and major Ethereum upgrades like Dencun reduce fees\n\nEthereum remains the dominant platform for DeFi, NFTs and smart contracts compared to competitors\n\nUpcoming Dencun upgrade aims to improve scalability and drastically lower network congestion and fees\n\nInstitutions predict ETH will outperform BTC in 2024 given Ethereum\u2019s strengths and extra yield opportunities\n\nEther supply is deflationary due to fee burning, while BTC underwent inflation in 2023 from new mining\n\nChief among them is the hotly anticipated Dencun upgrade now undergoing testing. Slated to hit Ethereum\u2019s mainnet in coming months, Dencun introduces data structures that some experts predict could slash network fees by up to 90%.\n\nBy improving scalability and throughput, Dencun aims to relieve the congestion and high costs that have hindered Ethereum adoption. The impact could be profound in unlocking the platform\u2019s true potential.\n\nBeyond Dencun specifically, Ethereum\u2019s dominance in areas like decentralized finance and NFTs continues growing. The total value locked in Ethereum DeFi protocols is an astounding 13x higher than rival blockchains. And nuevo crypto darling bitcoin saw more inflationary mining rewards issued last year while Ethereum\u2019s fee burning actually makes ETH a deflationary asset.\n\nThat scarcity combined with staking yields and rising institutional demand gives investors ways to generate returns simply for holding ETH. No such incentives exist with the comparatively static bitcoin.\n\nSpeaking of institutions, their comfort with ether vehicles continues increasing. The hottest current craze centers on spot cryptocurrency ETFs which hold tokens directly. Giant fund managers like BlackRock and VanEck \u2014 which just launched spot bitcoin ETFs \u2014 have ETH fund proposals awaiting regulatory greenlights.\n\nThe mere prospect of straightfoward ether exposure to tap into self-custody averse investors has already exited rally attempts this past week. If the floodgates open with SEC approval, expect eager capital to propel ETH prices upwards and help it decisively flip the script on last year\u2019s bitcoin domination.\n\nOf course, risks remain as with any nascent technology. But for crypto pioneers and institutions alike, Ethereum appears the smarter long-term bet compared to other blockchains vying to usurp its throne. With game-changing upgrades launching in months rather than years, 2024 shapes up to be the year ETH finally awakens to deliver on its lofty ambitions.\n\nAnd skeptical bitcoin maximalists may be left longing for the past as visions of an Ethereum-centric future edge closer to reality. The high stakes battle for blockchain supremacy enters a new phase, with all arrows pointing towards ETH market leadership through times of plenty and drought ahead."

        "content": "Recently, cryptocurrency analytics platform Lookonchain reported activities of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) whales amid the ongoing market downturn. These whales appear to have been capitalizing on the recent decline in the crypto prices to bolster their holdings.\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, amid the market dip, a newly established wallet withdrew 700 BTC, valued at roughly $29.36 million, from the Binance exchange.\n\nThese BTCs were purchased at an average price of $41,948 each.It is worth noting that, according to the analyst, such a move during a market downturn demonstrates a bullish sentiment on the future of BTC.\n\nIt seems that a whale is buying $BTC! In the recent market drop, a new wallet withdrew 700 $BTC($29.36M) from #Binance at an average price of $41,948.https://t.co/5kE1l0mJlo pic.twitter.com/Fj1thu4C6x \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 19, 2024\n\nEthereum Whales Joining The Fray\n\nThe narrative of strategic accumulation isn\u2019t limited to Bitcoin. Lookonchain\u2019s subsequent tweet highlighted similar activities in the Ethereum market.\n\nA whale took advantage of the decreased Ethereum prices, buying 3,600 ETH, worth around $8.9 million. Lookonchain highlighted that this investor\u2019s history of buying ETH at lower prices and selling at higher valuations has resulted in substantial profits, estimated at around $25.8 million.\n\nAfter the price of $ETH dropped today, this smart whale bought 3,600 $ETH($8.9M) back at a lower price 5 hours ago. This whale is very good at buying $ETH at low prices and selling $ETH at highs. The profit is ~$25.8M currently!https://t.co/UzXbheftr1 pic.twitter.com/DannZzsQVk \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 19, 2024\n\nThese whale movements are worth noting, especially considering the increasing bearish sentiment in the cryptocurrency markets. Ethereum, for instance, has seen a 1.9% decline in the past 24 hours and a 7.8% drop over the past week.\n\nThe asset is currently trading at around $2,475. Bitcoin is experiencing a similar trend, with a nearly 3% decrease in the past 24 hours and a 10% fall over the past week, bringing its price to $40,819 at the time of writing.\n\nThis market downturn is also reflected in the asset\u2019s trading volume. Bitcoin\u2019s daily trading volume fell from over $40 billion last Friday to about $26 billion.\n\nBitcoin Market Analysis And Future Predictions\n\nIn light of these developments, renowned crypto analyst Jacob Canfield has cautioned that Bitcoin might face further corrections in the short term.\n\nCanfield notes that the upcoming Bitcoin halving could play a crucial role in rebalancing the market dynamics, potentially tipping the scale towards demand over supply. However, his analysis of Bitcoin\u2019s 4-hour chart indicates the formation of a trend that has historically been an indicator of negative short to mid-term price movements.\n\nFor Bitcoin, critical levels include $48,700, marked by the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement, weekly resistance, and a significant support level to watch at $38,700. Earlier this month, Bitcoin traded at the $48,700 zone before retracing.\n\nCanfield warns that following a tap of the 61.8% level, Bitcoin often experiences an 18-22% sell-off, potentially bringing it back to the $38,700 support level.\n\n#Bitcoin update \u2013 If you\u2019ve been following me for a while, you\u2019ll know my local top on $BTC was $48.7k (as per my playbook posts) The question that everyone is asking now is \u2018where do we go from here?\u2019 The current narrative is that the ETF approval unlocked the GBTC investors\u2026 pic.twitter.com/MayIZp5vEY \u2014 Jacob Canfield (@JacobCanfield) January 18, 2024\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Kaiko Research highlighted that the correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum has dropped below its average of 0.71 for the first time since 2021.\n\nThis development comes amidst a broader market downturn, with BTC and ETH prices falling nearly 6% over the past week, currently at $40,991 and $2,463, respectively.\n\nHistorically, BTC and ETH have demonstrated a strong correlation in their market movements. However, the recent divergence raises questions about Ethereum\u2019s future trajectory, especially in light of its trade volume surge without corresponding signs of a rally in the derivatives market. This phenomenon contrasts sharply with the BTC market, which saw significant growth in anticipation of ETF approvals.\n\nYou might also like: Grayscale CEO: Most spot Bitcoin ETFs will not survive\n\nReflecting on Bitcoin\u2019s past, it\u2019s observed that BTC exhibited a remarkable 100% return over the past year, overshadowing Ethereum\u2019s 60% gains. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs marked a pivotal moment; BTC prices dipped while ETH experienced a rally, fueled by speculation that it might be the next to receive ETF approval.\n\nInvestors had previously focused on \u201cETH beta\u201d tokens, like Optimism (OP) and Arbitrum (ARB), which are closely linked to Ethereum but with higher volatility. However, after ETF approval, this trend saw a reversal, with these beta tokens experiencing a slump and ETH showing relative resilience by registering the smallest decline.\n\nThe current scenario underscores the evolving dynamics between Bitcoin and Ethereum. While BTC\u2019s ETF journey catalyzed its market presence, Ethereum\u2019s path appears less clear. Its reduced correlation with Bitcoin suggests a potential for independent market behavior. Yet, the lack of traditional rally indicators in derivatives markets and the shift away from ETH beta tokens post-BTC ETF approval inject uncertainty.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nSamson Mow, the chief executive officer of investment firm Jan3 and prominent Bitcoin (BTC) bull and evangelist, has taken his advocacy for the top coin to a new level. In his latest post on X, he took a subtle jab at alternative investment assets, including Silver and Ethereum (ETH), as his way of reducing their viability in comparison to their counterparts Gold and Silver.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSamson Mow analogy\n\nAccording to Samson Mow, Silver is the poor man\u2019s Gold, a statement that shows that investors who consider the latter to be too expensive typically opt in for the former. While both are respected metals and investment assets, Gold is still considered the superior of the two.\n\nSamson Mow deflated Ethereum\u2019s ego to end the long-standing superiority debate with Bitcoin. The vocal investor noted that \"Ethereum is the stupid man's Bitcoin,\" a statement that spooked members of the ETH community.\n\nSilver is the poor man\u2019s gold.\n\n\n\nEthereum is the stupid man\u2019s #Bitcoin. \u2014 Samson Mow (@Excellion) January 19, 2024\n\nBy valuation, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap currently stands at $809,923,408,001, while that of Ethereum comes in at $297,575,053,741. The price differentials of $41,344.01 to $2,476.66 also show that Bitcoin is the most valuable of the two. Over time, there have been conversations about shifting capital from BTC to ETH, a trend that might be amplified in the coming months if Ethereum\u2019s key fundamentals come into play.\n\nThe harsh criticism of Ethereum did not go down well with its community members, with some pointing out the key improvements the protocol has made as a blockchain in itself.\n\nIs XRP next?\n\nAs a Bitcoin Maxi, Samson Mow was asked by one of the commenters on his post what he thinks about XRP if Ethereum is the poor man\u2019s Bitcoin. He simply answered that the demand is a \"tricky one.\"\n\nSamson Mow\u2019s confidence in Bitcoin has made him forecast a $1 million price target, and his lack of confidence in XRP and Ethereum has undoubtedly made his bearish stand subtle."

Bitcoin is now hovering around $41,300 and could slip below $40,000 if the downturn continues throughout the weekend. The Bitcoin ETF pushed the cryptocurrency market up for a week and is now heading south in the charts. The BTC ETF news acted as a \u2018sell the news\u2019 kind of phenomenon as it\u2019s doing little to push Bitcoin\u2019s price up anymore.

The strengthening of the US dollar made the stock market dip leading to top companies printing losses in the charts. The effect also hit the commodity markets as gold and oil prices dipped more than 2%.

However, they noted that significant legal ambiguity could potentially impede this determination by the May deadline.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nJPMorgan puts the odds of a spot ETH ETF approval by May 23 at 50% or less.\n\nThe SEC classification of ETH as a commodity faces legal uncertainty.\n\nThe shift of the Ethereum network to proof-of-stake consensus complicates regulatory treatment.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin ETFs Surpass Silver ETFs In Assets Under Management\n\nWill Ethereum follow Bitcoin\u2019s path to spot ETF approval?\n\nThe analysis comes amid building market optimism through early 2024 that Ethereum could follow Bitcoin\u2019s path to spot ETF approval after futures-based ether funds launched in late 2022.\n\nHowever, JPMorgan contends ETH now resembles other altcoins outside of Bitcoin in the eyes of regulators after Ethereum completed its migration away from proof-of-work mining to a proof-of-stake validation model last September.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, whose energy-intensive mining process locks in its classification as a digital commodity, proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum are more challenging, the report states. Namely, ongoing lawsuits filed by the SEC against crypto exchanges for enabling staking services on proof-of-stake chains suggest legal clarity remains elusive.\n\nRead more: Chinese Crypto Users Turn To In-Person Trades To Evade Crackdown\n\nAnalysts say the resolution of those court cases seems necessary to pave the way for a spot ETH ETF.

The whale 0xc47 returned after two years of dormancy within the market, jotting an estimated gain of $31.1 million with ETH between September 8, 2020, and March 9, 2022.

        "content": "Santiment, a well-known on-chain data provider, recently unveiled informative data indicating that significant cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRPLedger, are presently encountering historically elevated levels of profit risk. This data presents valuable insights for both cryptocurrency investors and enthusiasts, offering a glimpse into potential trends and shifts in market dynamics.\n\nAs per Santiment\u2019s findings, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRPLedger have witnessed their respective profits rise to 83%, 84%, and 81%, respectively. These percentages notably surpass the historical averages, typically ranging from 55% to 75%, tracing back to 2018. While these percentages may appear promising, it is imperative to comprehend the context surrounding them.\n\nCryptocurrencies are renowned for their volatility, and their profitability levels can be influenced by diverse factors such as market sentiment, regulatory developments, and technological advancements. Despite the current elevated risk levels, the crypto market remains dynamic and susceptible to rapid changes.\n\nAlso Read: Whales Transfer over $780M in Bitcoin, Ethereum, DOGE and XRP\n\nOptimistic Outlook with ETFs and Increased Exposure\n\nThe report posits that cryptocurrencies still have growth potential, especially with heightened exposure from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and positive news developments. The crypto market has experienced a surge in interest from institutional investors, and the approval of ETFs could potentially bring more stability and legitimacy to the space.\n\nCrucial Signal for Long-Term Growth\n\nWhile predicting short-term market movements proves challenging, Santiment introduces an intriguing signal to monitor for potential long-term growth. A breach below 75% of the profits for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRPLedger could indicate a shift in market dynamics. This threshold acts as a benchmark for assessing the sustainability of their profitability levels.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Sales Pressure and ETF Inflows\n\nDespite the optimistic outlook, Bitcoin has recently encountered significant selling pressure, resulting in a 7% decline over the past week. Notably, this downturn contrasts with the robust inflows into Bitcoin ETFs during the same period. The lack of substantial price movement amid increased institutional interest prompts inquiries about the current state of the market and the influence of external factors on Bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\nXRPLedger\u2019s Profitable Supply\n\nXRPLedger, with its supply in profit hovering around 81.6 billion (81% of the total supply), presents an intriguing case. Although this figure reflects a decrease from a previous high, it still surpasses the lowest point recorded in October when the supply in profit dipped to about 71 billion (71% of the total supply). This suggests that XRPLedger has displayed resilience despite fluctuations in profit levels.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu, Bitcoin & Ethereum: 3 Boldest Price Predictions For 2024\n\nWhile positive developments like ETF approvals can contribute to market growth, monitoring profit levels below the 75% threshold may provide insights into the sustainability of cryptocurrency profitability.

Furthermore, XRP bulls have defended the support level around 54 cents and have respected a rising trend since mid-2022, which is characterized by higher highs and higher lows."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2024, Is $6000 Possible? - Live Bitcoin News",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has recently shown remarkable resilience and strength in the crypto market. As of now, Ethereum is trading at $2,563, reflecting a minor drop of -2.67% over the past 24 hours. This decline follows a period of impressive growth in which ETH surged by 23.22% in just three weeks. The recent bullish momentum has catapulted Ethereum back above the 50% level, signaling a potential continuation of the positive price action in the coming months. The ETH price prediction algorithm paints an even more optimistic picture, forecasting a staggering +253% price increase by the second quarter of 2024. If this prediction holds, Ethereum could be valued at an all-time high of $6,339.What\u2019s driving this anticipated surge? The primary catalyst is the upcoming Bitcoin (BTC) halving event, a significant occurrence in the world of cryptocurrency.\n\nUnderstanding the Bitcoin Halving and Its Timing\n\nThe Bitcoin halving event takes place approximately every four years or after every 210,000 blocks mined. During this event, the rewards miners receive for verifying transactions and securing the network are halved. This reduction in mining rewards introduces deflationary pressure into the Bitcoin ecosystem, gradually decreasing the supply of new BTC entering circulation. Historically, Bitcoin\u2019s deflationary mechanism has triggered new bull markets for cryptocurrencies. Each halving event has been followed by a surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price, ultimately leading to new all-time highs. The last Bitcoin halving took place in 2020, and the next one is scheduled for April 15, 2024.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Potential Post-Halving Growth\n\nEthereum has a history of significant price increases following Bitcoin\u2019s halving events. After the previous BTC halving, Ethereum\u2019s price skyrocketed by +2133%. This remarkable surge firmly established Ethereum as the second-most valuable cryptocurrency, propelling its native token, Ether (ETH), from $217 to an astonishing $4,864 within 18 months. One trader, known as Sporia on TradingView, has charted a long-term projection for ETH\u2019s price. The chart highlights two parallel trading channels that Ethereum has followed since the 2018 alt season, featuring a strong support line that has withstood the bearish market conditions of 2022 and 2023. Sporia points out an essential indicator: the reversal indicator signal, which has only been triggered four times in Ethereum\u2019s history, each time preceding a massive rally. According to Sporia\u2019s analysis, Ethereum is likely to maintain this market structure over the next five years. The upper resistance line in the chart provides price targets for Ethereum during the next two bullish phases of Bitcoin\u2019s four-year cycles, including a target of $16,090 in 2025. This represents an impressive +799% price increase from its current level. While Ethereum has experienced relative underperformance compared to other cryptocurrencies during recent bullish periods, with a +60% gain compared to the total crypto market cap\u2019s +80% rise in the past year, this should not raise alarm. Ethereum underwent a significant upgrade during the bear market, transitioning from a proof-of-work to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, known as The Merge. Moreover, Ethereum has benefited from increased regulatory clarity from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the introduction of new exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 scaling solutions have made substantial progress, further boosting the demand for the native ETH token. In summary, Ethereum is poised for significant growth, with a price prediction algorithm suggesting a +253% increase in the next seven months. This projection aligns with the timing of the next Bitcoin halving event, which could catalyze Ethereum\u2019s surge to new all-time highs. Amid the excitement surrounding Ethereum\u2019s potential and the upcoming Bitcoin halving, another cryptocurrency is making waves in the crypto market\u2014Retik Finance (RETIK). This groundbreaking token has attracted significant interest due to its impressive performance, having recently entered its presale stage 6.

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Jan. 18 that it has delayed its decision on Fidelity\u2019s proposed spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nMore specifically, the decision concerns a proposed rule change that would allow Cboe BZX to list and trade shares of Fidelity\u2019s planned fund.\n\nThe SEC noted that the proposed rule change was originally filed on Nov. 17, 2023 and published for comment in the federal register on Dec. 6, 2023.\n\nThe SEC said today that, based on those dates, it was previously required to approve, reject, or institute proceedings determining whether to disapprove the proposed rule change by Jan. 20. However, it has now chosen to use a provision that allows it to extend that deadline by 45 days to March 5, 2024.\n\nIt is likely that the SEC will choose to institute proceedings around Fidelity in March, as it done for certain other pending funds.\n\nSEC expected to decide on ETH ETFs in May\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said today that the Fidelity delay was \u201ccompletely expected\u201d and asserted that late May deadlines \u201creally matter.\u201d\n\nThat May deadline appears to be related to the fact that the SEC must either approve or reject VanEck\u2019s competing spot Ethereum ETF proposal by May 23.\n\nAs the SEC has already instituted proceedings on VanEck\u2019s application, it cannot delay its decision any further. And because the SEC generally approves similar ETFs together, it will likely decide on all pending spot Ethereum ETFs in late May, even though other applications have later deadlines.\n\nIt should also be noted that Fidelity, VanEck, and several other applicants succeeded in gaining approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 10. The success of those Bitcoin ETFs does not guarantee that Ethereum ETF proposals will also gain approval.\n\nPublic expectations are divided: one prediction market on Polymarket currently reports 54% odds in favor of spot Ethereum ETF approvals."

So, similar to spot BTC ETFs, potential spot ETH ETFs will open floodgates to institutional and retail capital.\n\nSeyffart\u2019s colleague Eric Balchunas believes the probability of the SEC approving an Ethereum ETF by May is 70%. As per Balchunas, the SEC\u2019s previous approval of ether futures-based ETFs in September 2023 will compel the regulator to give the green light since its approval of Bitcoin futures ETFs resulted in a court order to reevaluate Grayscale\u2019s bid to convert GBTC into a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nA likely approval of an ether exchange-traded fund coupled with the upcoming Dencun upgrade, which promises to improve the blockchain\u2019s scalability, could launch ETH to stratospheric new heights in 2024."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is currently awaiting the introduction of an Ethereum ETF after the approval of a Bitcoin ETF. Meanwhile, because of Pullix\u2019s security, investors are becoming more interested in ERC20 tokens.\n\nWhat Has Happened To Bitcoin (BTC) Since Its ETF Approval?\n\nThe United States Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs\u2014the news of the approval spiraled across the crypto community.\n\nBefore the approval, analysts predicted a surge in Bitcoin price due to increased inflows from institutional investors. Standard Chartered analysts predicted fund inflows ranging from $50 billion to $100 billion in 2024.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin has yet to rally a few days after the Bitcoin ETF approval. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin price has fluctuated between $41,753.68 and $48,494.62 in the past week.\n\nAt the moment, Bitcoin is facing huge selling pressure around the $48k level. Still, analysts remain bullish on the flagship cryptocurrency. All eyes are now on the Bitcoin halving to spark a bullish run. Analysts predict a surge to $50k and $100k in the long run.\n\nEthereum (ETH) ETF Approval Coming?\n\nSince the US SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETF, the crypto community has been betting on spot Ethereum ETFs. While some analysts believe spot Ethereum ETFs could be next in line, others have a different opinion. An example of such an analyst is JPMorgan\u2019s Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou.\n\nAccording to the analyst, the regulator must classify Ethereum as a commodity before approving spot Ethereum ETFs. On the other hand, Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas forecasts a 70% possibility that an Ethereum ETF will be approved by May.\n\nSeveral big firms, including Fidelity and BlackRock, have filed for spot Ethereum ETFs. An approval of Ethereum ETF could push the price of Ethereum as high as $4500, per analysts.\n\nPullix (PLX) Native Token Catches Investors\u2019 Interest\n\nPullix (PLX) ERC20 token, PLX, has been the main talk of investors since the beginning of its presale. The token is built on the Ethereum blockchain, meaning more security. Also, its price has increased 100% to $0.08 in less than a month. All these have gained attention among investors.\n\nThe upcoming launch of the Pullix exchange also adds to the increased interest from investors. This DeFi project is prepared to launch in Q1 2024 following its presale. It is a hybrid exchange platform, combining the strengths of both centralized and decentralized exchanges.\n\nUsers of the Pullix platform are able to trade in a range of markets such as stocks, commodities, forex indices and options. Daily turnover in the forex market is more than $6.6 trillion. Given the profit-making nature of PLX, analysts are positive about its growth in 2024. Pullix allows users to generate passive revenue by staking the PLX altcoin.\n\nStaking basically implies locking tokens in a smart contract to strengthen the platform\u2019s liquidity. Based on the quantity and duration of staking, a reward is issued. As the period of investment increases, the profits increase, too. Pullix further presents the Market-Making Liquidity Contribution, which means that any user can act as a market maker and contribute liquidity to this platform.\n\nThe annual return paid to market makers on Pullix is between 8% and 18%. This strategy is likely to increase the number of users using Pullix, which will encourage its use. With its price now standing at $0.08 per token, Pullix is already regarded as one of the best DeFi projects to invest in 2024.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile Bitcoin ETF approval has not given the expected price movement, investors are hoping Ethereum will perform differently. Meanwhile, analysts are predicting a 100x rise in Pullix\u2019s altcoin value.\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

It was sometime in October that client developers confirmed that they would not be implementing the hardfork before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cThere is no way we are implementing a mainnet fork in 2023,\u201d pseudonymous Prysm developer, Potuz stated.\n\nIt turned out to be that the developer clients for the consensus layer and the execution layer were at odds among themselves, further contributing to the delays experienced thus far.\n\nProposed Phased Launch of the Upgrade\n\nThe eventual launch on the Goerli test network indicates a significant milestone toward the integration into the Ethereum mainnet. The deployment on the Goerli testnet came with the implementation of EIP-4844.\n\nEIP-4844 is a revolutionary transaction mechanism colloquially referred to as Proto-Danksharding. It brings with it a system that reduces transaction costs for Decentralized Applications (DApps). This is achieved by allowing Ethereum nodes to temporarily store and access off-chain data. It effectively reduces the strain on storage resources, according to the description given by Ethereum developers.\n\nSoon, this will contribute to enhancing the efficiency of Layer-2 rollup chains\n\nThe upcoming deployment of the Ethereum Dencun Upgrade on Sepolia and Holesky testnets is largely dependent on what happens on the Goerli testnet in the coming weeks. By the time the upgrade is functioning smoothly on the three testnets, activation will be the next goal. The choice of a phased launch of the Ethereum Dencun Upgrade is to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Ethereum Dencun Upgrade follows the Ethereum Shapella upgrade of 2023."

The timeline for testing remains unchanged and Galaxy Digital\u2019s Christine Kim believes the likelihood of mainnet activation for the upgrade by the end of March is now 60%.\n\nLayer 2 chains are not currently ready for the upgrade, however, developers are moving ahead with the testnet releases in the next three weeks. It is likely that Dencun goes live on mainnet as early as February if the upgrades on Sepolia and Holesky do not encounter issues.\n\nDevelopers are likely to run additional tests and Layer 2 chains may want to perform client releases on Sepolia and Holesky before the mainnet upgrade. If this occurs, then the likelihood of mainnet release in February is limited to 30%.\n\nThe implementation of EIP-4844 is expected to boost the features of Ethereum and drive adoption of the chain.\n\nExpected Impacts of EIP 4844.

        "content": "SEC extends spot ETH ETF decision by 45 days\n\nMore ETH flows out of exchanges as the wait begins\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has taken its first concrete step of the year on the route to either approving or rejecting an Ethereum spot ETF. This action was conveyed through a response sent by the SEC to Fidelity.\n\nSEC responds to Fidelity\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF application\n\nAs per a letter dated 18 January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has decided to extend its decision-making process regarding the Fidelity spot Ethereum ETF application. The application, submitted on 17 November 2023 and opened for comments on 6 December, will now undergo an extended resolution period. This follows the SEC\u2019s choice to extend the decision timeline by 45 days.\n\nConsequently, the resolution is anticipated to be around 5 March 2024. Also, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart suggests that approval may be possible in May. Notably, BlackRock\u2019s CEO Larry Fink is pretty confident of the value attached to a spot Ethereum ETF. He claimed so in an interview shortly after the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nEthereum remains in a downtrend\n\nUpon the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF, there was no notable surge in price, with analysts attributing this to it being priced in before the announcement. Interestingly, for Ethereum, the news of the proposal submission and the subsequent decision announcement may significantly impact the price more than the actual approval.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was trading at around $2,400, experiencing a slight loss of less than 1% in 24 hours. Although it seems to be on a downtrend, ETH\u2019s present value is higher than what its value was a year ago.\n\nAn analysis of the daily timeframe chart revealed that ETH did not reach the present price level over the previous year. Additionally, the ongoing bull trend continued while showing signs of weakening. Notably, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remained above the neutral line, indicating a bullish trend at press time.\n\nObserving the exchange flow\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s examination of Ethereum\u2019s exchange flow showed that the balance between inflow and outflow shifted around 14 January. Since then, there has been a consistent trend of more outflow than inflow. This suggested that a more significant amount of ETH is leaving exchanges, compared to the incoming volume.\n\nAlso, the trend implied that fewer Ethereum assets are being offered for sale recently.\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nAs of 18 January, the data highlighted that over 90,000 ETH have moved out of exchanges, further supporting the notion that market participants are withdrawing their assets from exchange platforms."

Speaking on Rug Radio's FOMO Hour, Balchunas said that the SEC's prior approval of Ethereum futures ETFs has backed the regulator into a corner, since its approval of Bitcoin futures ETFs resulted in a court order to review Grayscale's spot Bitcoin ETF application.\n\nThe SEC last week approved multiple spot Bitcoin ETF applications, with chair Gary Gensler conceding that circumstances had \"changed\" following the court order.\n\n\u201cIpso facto, you have to approve an Ether spot [ETF], or you\u2019re going to get sued again for the same exact reason,\u201d Balchunas said during a Rug Radio appearance late last week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn his statement following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, SEC chair Gensler took pains to state that \"today\u2019s Commission action is cabined to ETPs holding one non-security commodity,\" Bitcoin, and that \"It should in no way signal the Commission\u2019s willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities.\" Gensler added that, \"Nor does the approval signal anything about the Commission\u2019s views as to the status of other crypto assets under the federal securities laws.\"\n\nDuring his term as SEC chair, Gensler has repeatedly refused to clarify whether the regulator considers Ethereum a security or a commodity.\n\nPrior to taking his position at the regulator, while teaching a course on blockchain at MIT, Gensler stated that Ethereum is \"not a security\" in the eyes of the SEC, noting that it considered the cryptocurrency \"sufficiently decentralized\" that it doesn't qualify. Gensler was seemingly mirroring the opinion of the SEC's former Director of Corporate Finance William Hinman in his much-cited \"sufficiently decentralized\" speech of June 2018.\n\nGensler's fellow regulator, chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Rostin Behnam, has expressed the view that Ethereum should be considered a commodity."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nChristine Kim, vice president of research at Galaxy, shared a quick recap of the latest Ethereum developers' call.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoing forward into the Dencun testing timeline, two key dates might be critical to watch ahead of mainnet activation.\n\nThe Cancun/Deneb upgrade on the Sepolia and Holesky testnets has been scheduled for activation on Jan. 30 and Feb. 7, respectively. In this regard, Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko says to expect an announcement with client releases in the coming week.\n\nQuick update from ACD call today:\n\n- Cancun/Deneb upgrade on Sepolia and Holesky testnets remain scheduled for activation on Jan 30 and Feb 7, respectively.\n\n- Client releases for both upgrades will be bundled and shared in a blog post next Tues.\n\n- Full writeup from today's call\u2026 \u2014 Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) January 18, 2024\n\nThe much-anticipated Dencun upgrade follows last year's Shapella upgrade. According to ETH developers, it will first be deployed to the Goerli testnet, then, if no major issues are found, to Sepolia and Holesky. Once Dencun is running smoothly on all three testnets, mainnet activation will be scheduled.\n\nDuring the week, the Dencun network upgrade was activated on the Goerli testnet. The upgrade included several changes, most notably the introduction of ephemeral data blobs with EIP-4844, also known as \"protodanksharding,\" which will help slash L2 transaction fees.\n\nEthereum developer Tim Beiko recounts the events that led to Goerli not finalizing immediately after the Dencun upgrade was initiated. Due to Goerli having an open validator set, there was an expected but significant drop in validator participation at the fork.\n\nIn addition to this, a client bug on the network with Prysm set the historical root value to 0 instead of copying over the last historical root when Deneb was activated.\n\nOnce the bug showed up on Goerli, its cause was found, a fix was made and a release was put out shortly after.\n\nWith more validators coming online and one client team upgrading some nodes that had been missed, the Goerli network eventually finalized.\n\nWith this significant milestone reached, Ethereum developers are now proceeding to fork the Sepolia and Holesky testnets before the mainnet launch.\n\nThe much-anticipated Dencun upgrade combines changes to both Ethereum's consensus and execution layers. The list of protocol changes includes: EIP-1153: Transient storage opcodes; EIP-4788: Beacon block root in the EVM; EIP-4844: Shard Blob Transactions; EIP-5656: MCOPY (memory copying instruction); EIP-6780: SELFDESTRUCT only in the same transaction; EIP-7044: Perpetually Valid Signed Voluntary Exits; EIP-7045: Increase Max Attestation Inclusion Slot; EIP-7514: Add Max Epoch Churn Limit and EIP-7516: BLOBBASEFEE opcode."

        "content": "Samson Mow, recognized for his outspoken opinions in the cryptocurrency realm, has sparked debate by referring to Ethereum as the \u201cstupid man\u2019s Bitcoin.\u201d However, Mow, who shared his unfiltered thoughts on the X platform, didn\u2019t stop there.\n\nWhen a user questioned the title for XRP holders, Mow intriguingly labeled it a \u201ctricky one.\u201d The cryptocurrency maverick continued his discourse, saying that Tether and MicroStrategy hold zero Ethereum, emphasizing the prevailing race to accumulate only Bitcoin. Notably, this bold perspective adds fuel to the ongoing debates within the crypto community.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSamson Mow Sees Ethereum As \u2018Stupid Man\u2019s Bitcoin\u201d\n\nIn a bold declaration on the X platform, Samson Mow likened Ethereum to the \u201cpoor man\u2019s gold,\u201d drawing a parallel to silver\u2019s relationship with gold. Meanwhile, Mow\u2019s blunt assertion categorizing Ethereum as the \u201cstupid man\u2019s Bitcoin\u201d has sparked debates within the crypto community.\n\nNotably, the comparison sheds light on the ongoing rivalry between the two major cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, and the varied opinions that often characterize this space.\n\nIn addition, addressing a user\u2019s inquiry about XRP, Mow\u2019s response, \u201cThat\u2019s a tricky one,\u201d adds an element of mystery to the dynamics surrounding Ripple\u2019s native token. The crypto community is left to ponder the nuances of Mow\u2019s perception of XRP, further intensifying the discourse on the diverse attributes of different digital assets.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Accumulations Soar As ETH Price Slips Below $2,500\n\nTether, MicroStrategy, And The Bitcoin-Only Race\n\nSamson Mow\u2019s recent critique extended beyond Ethereum, citing the crypto portfolio of major players like Tether and MicroStrategy. His post underscored the absence of Ethereum in the holdings of Tether and MicroStrategy, contrasting it with the race to accumulate Bitcoin.\n\nMow\u2019s disdain for what he terms as \u201cshilling shitcoins\u201d by some ETF issuers highlights the ongoing struggle within the crypto industry to establish other altcoins\u2019 dominance.\n\nFor context, Tether\u2019s aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin during the Q4 2023 bull run, adding $380 million worth of BTC, has been a notable trend. As reported by CoinGape Media earlier, the stablecoin issuer now boasts a substantial 66,465 BTC, valued at approximately $2.8 billion.\n\nMow\u2019s criticism echoes the sentiment within certain crypto circles that view Bitcoin as the unrivaled leader, while other assets, including Ethereum and XRP, grapple with diverse perceptions and critiques.\n\nSamson Mow\u2019s unfiltered remarks continue to stir conversations, showcasing the dynamic and often polarizing nature of discussions within the cryptocurrency community. As the crypto space evolves, perspectives like Mow\u2019s contribute to the ongoing narrative surrounding the roles and values assigned to different digital assets in this ever-changing landscape.\n\nAlso Read: Oaktree Co-Founder Deems Bitcoin And Gold Equals In Intrinsic Value Debate"

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShiba Inu has experienced a significant breakdown from its recent consolidation phase. The chart depicts a clear downward trajectory as SHIB failed to maintain its position within the ascending triangle pattern it had formed over the past few months.\n\nThe breakdown was signaled as SHIB prices breached the key support level at $0.000009, which had previously acted as a reliable floor for the price during consolidation phases. Following this, SHIB prices tumbled further, slicing through subsequent support near $0.0000087. This price action marked a decisive shift in market sentiment from accumulation to distribution.\n\nThe next support level to watch is at $0.0000082, where SHIB may find a temporary reprieve from the selling pressure. If this level fails to hold, the next critical support lies at $0.0000076, which could serve as the last line of defense before a more significant drop.\n\nFor a reversal to occur and for SHIB to regain its upward momentum, it would need to reclaim previous support levels and transform them back into supports. This would require a substantial influx of buying pressure, potentially sparked by positive developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem or broader cryptocurrency market rallies.\n\nThe first sign of a possible reversal would be a return above $0.0000087, followed by a sustained move above the $0.000009 price level. A breakout above these levels, accompanied by increasing volume, could indicate that the downtrend is losing steam and that bulls are regaining control.\n\nSolana paints reversal pattern\n\nSolana has been developing a subtle yet potentially pivotal chart pattern. The asset has been tracing a slow and steady ascending channel, a formation that suggests a controlled and consistent uptrend. This pattern, characterized by higher lows and higher highs contained within two parallel trendlines, speaks to potential for continued growth.\n\nThe significance of this pattern lies in the momentum it could provide for SOL. Should the price action remain strong within the upper half of the channel, and particularly if it challenges the upper trendline, we could see Solana break through and embark on a more aggressive rally.\n\nSuch a bullish scenario would likely be supported by increased trading volume and positive developments within the Solana ecosystem, such as new project launches or updates that enhance network performance.\n\nThe immediate local resistance stands at around $55, and a confident push beyond this could confirm bullish sentiment. Inversely, if Solana's price dips below the channel's lower boundary, around $48, it could indicate that a bearish narrative is taking hold.\n\nEthereum momentum decreasing\n\nEthereum is exhibiting signs of waning momentum, as observed in recent price movements. The asset, which has long been considered the backbone of the decentralized finance sector, is facing a pivotal moment that could determine its trajectory for the coming weeks.\n\nThe provided chart illustrates Ethereum's struggle to maintain its grasp on the market. The price has been on a downward trend, edging closer to the local 26-day Exponential Moving Average. This level, currently near $2,465, is critical; if Ethereum fails to hold this line, we might see it descend to test the more significant 50 EMA, which stands around the $2,300 mark.\n\nThe 26 EMA serves as a short-term sentiment gauge, and its breach could signal a lack of immediate bullish support. Should this level fail to act as a springboard for price recovery, Ethereum's next stop could indeed be the 50 EMA. A breach below this longer-term moving average could potentially open the gates for a test of lower support levels, highlighting the need for investors to brace for more volatility.\n\nMarket participants are now recalibrating their expectations, understanding that the road to sustainable gains is a long-term journey."

        "content": "ETC\u2019s price has dropped by double digits in the last week.\n\nDespite the price dip, bullish momentum remains.\n\nFollowing a post-ETF-approval rally, Ethereum Classic [ETC] has begun to shed its gains. AMBCrypto reported earlier that Ethereum-linked tokens ETC and Ethereum Name Service [ENS] climbed to 12-month highs after the long-awaited ETF decision on 10th January.\n\nAs of this writing, ETC exchanged hands at $23.90, dropping by 19% in the last week, data from CoinMarketCap showed.\n\nBullish momentum remains\n\nETC\u2019s price surge post-ETF approval was backed by no real uptick in demand for ETC. Now that the excitement surrounding the ETF has waned, the coin has witnessed a drop in value.\n\nHowever, despite the recent price pullback, an assessment of ETC\u2019s price movements on a daily chart revealed that bullish momentum persisted. At press time, the coin\u2019s momentum indicator rested above their respective center lines, suggesting that buying pressure exceeded coin sell-offs.\n\nFurther, the coin\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) returned a value above the zero line. When an asset\u2019s CMF value rests above zero, it signals the presence of more buying pressure.\n\nAt 0.06 and in an uptrend when writing, ETC\u2019s CMF showed rising liquidity being supplied to the coin\u2019s spot market. This is known to drive up an asset\u2019s value.\n\nConfirming the bullish trend, readings from ETC\u2019s Directional Movement Index (DMI) showed its positive directional index (green) resting above the negative directional index (red).\n\nWhen these trend lines are positioned in this manner, it suggests that the strength of the bulls exceeds that of the bears.\n\nHowever, the price decline experienced in the last week has resulted in a fall in ETC\u2019s futures open interest. According to data from Coinglass, since 12th January, ETC\u2019s open interest has plunged by 22%.\n\nAs of this writing, the coin\u2019s futures open interest was $162.34\n\nVolatility lingers in the market\n\nThe hike in ETC price post-ETF approval led to a surge in market volatility.\n\nWith the gap between the upper and lower bands of the coin\u2019s Bollinger Bands (BB) indicator still widening at press time, ETC remained prone to price swings."

        "content": "Metamask has started testing a new technology meant to help Ethereum users collaborate with third parties to improve the efficiency and affordability of their crypto transactions. If successful, the feature will give users much more agency on how to perform transactions, effectively changing the shift in power between validators and users.\n\nThe \u201ctransaction routing\u201d feature is being developed in partnership with Special Mechanisms Group (SMG), a subsidiary of Consensys. Consensys, which is MetaMask\u2019s parent company, confirmed the testing of the feature to CoinDesk. The development of the feature would represent a change in the paradigm for blockchain, resulting in more user-friendly and effective transactions.\n\nETH transaction prices are high, and don\u2019t make sense for small amounts of money. With better options out there, ETH is in a losing position at the moment.\n\nFrom \u201cHow\u201d to \u201cWhat\u201d\n\nAs confirmed to CoinDesk by SMG director Jason Linehan, the \u201ctransaction routing\u201d being developed would be a new form of Intent-centric protocol. These protocols focus on helping users achieve a specific objective when performing transactions, instead of requiring them to specify how such transactions will take place.\n\nThis means that users would be able to determine if they want to sell a token at the best price, improve transaction efficiency, or reduce gas fees. Traditionally, users would have to find the right \u201crecipe\u201d of conditions to have such an outcome take place.\n\n\u201cTransaction Routing\u201d would make this a thing of the past by letting third parties take part in the process to help achieve the desired outcome on behalf of the user. Such an approach has already been explored by other parties, often recurring to mempools (both private and public), but has failed to find widespread adoption.\n\nWhat Makes MetaMask\u2019s Approach Unique?\n\nWhile not many details are known so far, Linehan has stated that MetaMask\u2019s approach wouldn\u2019t be a \u201ccentralized solution\u201d nor a \u201cvertical integration\u201d like other intent-centric protocols. Instead, an approach similar to that of an \u201cauction-based optimization method\u201d would allow the new feature to differentiate itself.\n\nThe feature is designed to be permissionless and have mechanisms to ensure that \u201csearchers, builders, and solvers\u201d of all sizes can collaborate, according to Linehan. The feature is also likely to be open-sourced, which will play a role in the way it is licensed once the project gets to that stage.\n\nSome of the elements developed for this new routing technology are already powering MetaMask\u2019s \u201cSmart Swaps\u201d feature. As the development of the technology continues, the capabilities of the feature will continue to expand while remaining optional.\n\nMetaMask\u2019s Expansion Beyond Ethereum Continues\n\nIn a move reflective of MetaMask\u2019s commitment to expanding its reach, the MetaMask Snaps plugin has now found its way into the Hedera ecosystem. MetaMask\u2019s 30 million users can now make use of the Hedera Wallet Snap plugin to access Hedera applications that couldn\u2019t make use of MetaMask-based functionality in the past.\n\nThe Snaps plugin was developed by Tuum Technologies to extend the functionality of MetaMask by making it possible for developers to create custom plugins. This means that developers no longer need to depend on the Hedera JSON-RPC Relay, simplifying the development process and making Hedera compatible with EVM-based applications.\n\nThe launch was categorized as \u201cpivotal\u201d by The Hbar Foundation CEO Shayn Hygdon, who also stated that \u201cmore features and functionality\u201d would be announced in the future as this was \u201cjust a first step\u201d. By making it possible for developers to expand MetaMask\u2019s functionality in such a way, the HBAR Foundation.\n\nETH transaction prices will need to come down, one way or the other. If they don\u2019t there won\u2019t be a market for small ETH transactions."

        "title": "SEC lives up to the expectations as it delays spot ETH ETF; Ethereum price makes no move - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed its decision on Fidelity\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF, per a filing.\n\nDespite the spot Bitcoin ETF approval setting a precedent, the SEC stated that it needs time to consider the issues raised following evaluation.\n\nThis was expected of the regulator, given its response in the past, and the next deadline is now on March 8.\n\nEthereum price remained stationary around $2,450, unaffected by the decision, but is losing the strength to reclaim $2,500.\n\nThe crypto market faced a long battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) when it attempted to secure a spot in Bitcoin ETF, which finally came to fruition when the court interfered. Now, it seems like Ethereum is set to witness the same ordeal as the SEC is taking two steps back after rejecting the spot ETH ETF application.\n\nSEC says no to Ethereum ETF\n\nAfter a long, drawn-out battle for the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF, it was expected that Ethereum or other assets might not have to deal with the SEC in this regard. The reason was that spot BTC ETF, backed by the court, likely established a precedent for exchange-traded products (ETP) of such kind, but by the looks of it, this did not happen.\n\nThe SEC, in a filing today, delayed its decision on Fidelity\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF application. The regulatory body took an early decision as the deadline for the same was set on January 21. The final deadline for the SEC is on March 8, though this will likely get extended, too, given the present scenario.\n\nThere is a chance the SEC might not obstruct the process this time, given its brush with the law last year. i.e., Grayscale\u2019s lawsuit against the regulator. Furthermore, just like the last time, there is not just one applicant as seven major asset management firms have applied to issue their spot ETH ETF.\n\nThis includes the likes of BlackRock, ARK & 21Shares, and Grayscale too, which is attempting to convert the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot ETF. Grayscale was the biggest catalyst in making Bitcoin ETF a reality, giving Ethereum ETFs a strong backup.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF applicants\n\nEthereum price sees nothing\n\nEthereum price did not react exorbitantly as the altcoin remained mostly undisturbed and unaffected by the SEC\u2019s decision. This can be seen in the chart below, where the second-generation cryptocurrency is keeping above the $2,450 support line.\n\nThis shows that the market had been expecting something like this to happen, hence the lack of bearishness at present. However, even if there is no bearishness, it does not translate to an abundance of bullishness either. The price indicators Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) are both showing receding bullishness in the market.\n\nThe most harm this could do to Ethereum would likely be a correction to $2,356, where a bounce-off would revive the rally.\n\nETH/USD 1-day chart\n\nHowever, a rally to $2,600 and beyond would invalidate the bearish thesis and set a new multi-month high for the Ethereum price."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nLarge cryptocurrency holders, commonly known as whales, have taken advantage of the recent market dip to make strategic moves on the volatile Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) markets. Lookonchain, a prominent cryptocurrency analytics platform, tweeted twice, shedding light on the activities of these savvy whales.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe market movements and the actions of these whales underscore the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency space, where sharp price fluctuations present both risks and opportunities for investors. The ability of whales to navigate these fluctuations and capitalize on market dips demonstrates the sophisticated strategies employed by some players in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nWhales in action\n\nIn the initial tweet, Lookonchain mentioned that there appeared to be a whale engaging in the purchase of BTC. The tweet revealed that amid the recent market decline, a newly created wallet executed a withdrawal of 700 BTC ($29.36 million) from Binance, acquiring them at an average price of $41,948.\n\nIt seems that a whale is buying $BTC!\n\n\n\nIn the recent market drop, a new wallet withdrew 700 $BTC($29.36M) from #Binance at an average price of $41,948.https://t.co/5kE1l0mJlo pic.twitter.com/Fj1thu4C6x \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 19, 2024\n\nThis move by the Bitcoin whale suggests a strategic acquisition during the market downturn, showcasing confidence in the long-term potential of the leading cryptocurrency. The substantial withdrawal from Binance at a specific price point raises questions about the whale's market timing and their anticipation of a potential rebound.\n\nLookonchain's second tweet continued the narrative by stating that, following the recent decline in the price of Ethereum , a discerning whale had acquired 3,600 ETH ($8.9 million) at a lower price. The tweet highlighted the whale's proficiency in purchasing ETH at lower values and selling them at higher points, resulting in a current profit of approximately $25.8 million.\n\nAfter the price of $ETH dropped today, this smart whale bought 3,600 $ETH($8.9M) back at a lower price 5 hours ago.\n\n\n\nThis whale is very good at buying $ETH at low prices and selling $ETH at highs.\n\n\n\nThe profit is ~$25.8M currently!https://t.co/UzXbheftr1 pic.twitter.com/DannZzsQVk \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 19, 2024\n\nAs of the latest update, the current Bitcoin price is $41,414, reflecting a 2.97% decrease in the last 24 hours and a 9.69% drop in the last seven days. On the other hand, the current Ethereum price is $2,489, exhibiting a 1.82% decrease in the last 24 hours and a 4.70% decline in the last seven days."

        "content": "As the weekend unfolds, Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a notable uptick, trading at $41,700 with nearly 1.40% increase on Saturday. Despite this positive momentum, skepticism remains as The New York Times maintains a cautious stance on Bitcoin\u2019s prospects. Adding to the wary outlook, the RBI Governor has flagged cryptocurrencies as a risk to the stability of the Indian Rupee, urging investors to proceed with caution.\n\nMeanwhile, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has reported a loss of $2.3 million by the cryptocurrency exchange Debiex due to alleged romance scams, highlighting the vulnerabilities within the crypto space. Furthermore, the strength of the US Dollar Index (DXY) is seen as a potential threat to Bitcoin\u2019s recovery, compounded by the selling pressure from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).\n\nWith such diverse factors at play, investors are pondering whether it\u2019s the opportune moment to buy into Bitcoin and Ethereum as the latter taps the $2,500 mark.\n\nRBI Governor Cautions: Cryptocurrency Threatens Rupee Stability\n\n\n\nGovernor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Shaktikanta Das, has spoken about the serious risks that come with cryptocurrencies, particularly for developing nations. Das underlined the possible effects on the monetary system, currency stability, and financial stability. He voiced worries about cryptocurrencies\u2019 lack of underlying assets and their ability to replace money in payment systems and banking.\n\nDas highlights the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies and sees considerable risks, even in spite of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission having approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The governor\u2019s cautious approach increases the regulatory obstacles that cryptocurrencies must overcome and may lead to more volatility in the market.\n\nCFTC Reports: Debiex Exchange Hit by $2.3M Romance Scams\n\n\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has labeled cryptocurrency exchange Debiex as a \u201cfraudulent digital asset platform,\u201d accusing its senior staff of orchestrating romantic deceptions to defraud money.\n\nCFTC Charges Bogus Digital Asset Platform with Fraud and Misappropriation in an Online Romance Scam: https://t.co/RpskNapy7i \u2014 CFTC (@CFTC) January 19, 2024\n\nThe CFTC\u2019s report alleges that Debiex representatives engaged in forming intimate relationships with potential clients, gaining their trust, and subsequently persuading them to open and fund trading accounts. This scheme reportedly siphoned over $2 million, with five victims currently identified over two years.\n\nThese romance scam allegations add to a series of challenges within the cryptocurrency industry, potentially impacting investor sentiment and activity by undermining the trust and credibility of crypto exchanges.\n\nUS Dollar Rally and GBTC Sell-Off Endanger Bitcoin\u2019s Recovery\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Dollar Index\u2019s (DXY) rally, up 2.71% from its December 27 low, poses a challenge to Bitcoin\u2019s price recovery. Bolstered by robust retail sales and positive economic data, the DXY has seen significant gains. Concurrently, Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has experienced substantial outflows, with around 38,000 BTC withdrawn since January 11, when spot Bitcoin ETFs were introduced.\n\nEconomist Peter Schiff attributes these GBTC outflows as a key factor preventing Bitcoin\u2019s price rise. Technical analysis suggests Bitcoin could potentially fall back to around $34,000, having been repelled at the $48,000 level, which aligns with the upper limit of an ascending parallel channel."

        "content": "Ethereum and BNB See Steady Growth as Borroe Finance Shines in DeFi with Impressive Presale Stage 4\n\nEthereum (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB) are among the world\u2019s top five cryptos, and they\u2019ve recorded ecosystem wins in early 2024. However, investors are looking for the best crypto investments that will deliver massive ROI in the coming months. Luckily, these investors found Borroe Finance ($ROE)and invested over $2.6 million in the new blockchain project. Keep reading to see expert forecasts and opinions on these tokens.>>BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW<<\n\nETH Crosses $2,500 For the First Time Since 2022\n\n\n\nOn January 16, the co-founder of Ethereum,\n\nVitalik Buterin, opined that blockchain validiums are not genuine Zk-rollups. According to the Ethereum founder, validiums do not have the security architecture of rollups, meaning users cannot recover their assets in case of cyberattacks. Buterin added that the main advantage of Zk-rollups is that they enable off-chain transactions and post cryptographic proofs of legitimate transactions.\n\nVitalik suggested multiple changes to Ethereum\u2019s structure in recent weeks. As a result, ETH crossed $2,500 for the first time since May 2022. On January 10, ETH traded at $2,372. A week later, ETH gained 7.80% and traded for $2,556. As one of the world\u2019s best altcoins, ETH surged due to an influx of new investors following the SEC\u2019s approval for BTC Spot ETFs. Subsequently, experts expect ETH to stay bullish and trade for $2,800 in Q1 2024.\n\nBitPay Approves Support for Binance Coin\n\n\n\nOn January 8, BitPay (the world\u2019s leading crypto payments service provider) approved the proposal to integrate Binance Coin as a payment option on its platform. The platform also announced support for other top altcoins like Chainlink and Uniswap in an effort to boost its crypto payment options. This BitPay integration was good news to Binance Coin investors, and Binance Coin recorded a minor price surge a few hours after this announcement.\n\nOn January 8, BNB sold for $299. Within a week, BNB gained 3.14% and traded for $309. For some reason, Binance Coin investors did not hop on the bullish trend after the SEC approved BTC Spot ETFs. As a result, BNB recorded a minor surge, unlike other altcoins, and crypto experts believe BNB will also range during BTC\u2019s halving in April. Therefore, analysts expect BNB to maintain steady growth in Q1 2024 and trade for $320 by March.\n\n$ROE Completes 83% of its Fourth Presale Stage\n\n\n\nCrypto investors have been impressed withBorroe Finance\u2019s progress in the last few weeks. The new\n\nblockchain platform powered through three presale stages in the second half of 2023 and raised over $2.6 million by January. For context, Borroe Finance is an innovative AI-powered fundraising marketplace that allows web3 businesses to mint their future earnings into trending NFTs and sell them at a discount to supportive communities.\n\n$ROE\u2019s fourth presale stage is ongoing and is already over 83% complete. At the end of all presale stages, $ROE will list on major crypto exchanges and surge from its current price of $0.019 to $0.040. According to crypto analysts, this upward $ROE price movement will lead to a massive 110.5% ROI for early $ROE investors in 2024.\n\nLearn more about Borroe Finance here:\n\nVisit Borroe Finance Presale | Join The Telegram Group | Follow Borroe Finance on Twitter"

        "content": "In a noteworthy development, Cardano ($ADA) has emerged as a frontrunner in terms of the volume of substantial transactions over the last 30 days, outshining Ethereum ($ETH) in this unique aspect.\n\nThis positive shift comes amid the broader market\u2019s collective effort to break free from the persisting downtrend.\n\nAccording to insights provided by IntoTheBlock, the 30-day volume of significant transactions on the Cardano network has witnessed a substantial surge, surpassing the equivalent figures for Ethereum.\n\nNotably, ADA whales have been notably active in recent months, contributing to an impressive total of $13 billion in transactions exceeding $100,000. This surge signals a revitalization of the Cardano network.\n\nCardano whales have been quite active for the past few months. $13B in large transactions (>$100k) is being settled on Cardano daily on average. A significant amount, if you compare it to Ethereum's $5B 7-day average. pic.twitter.com/8rjeQZaonU \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 18, 2024\n\nEthereum Maintains $5 Billion Transaction And Cardano Price Action To Watch\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum has maintained an average of $5 billion over a seven-day period for transactions of comparable size. The comparison highlights Cardano\u2019s recent surge in substantial transaction volume, showcasing a distinct trend in its favor.\n\nDespite this positive development, it\u2019s essential to note that, similar to several other altcoins, ADA has experienced a decline in price over the past few weeks. The token recorded a 5% decrease in the last 24 hours and a 15% dip in the past seven days.\n\nThis price movement suggests a nuanced scenario where Cardano demonstrates strength in on-chain activities, while market dynamics continue to impact its short-term valuation.\n\nCardano\u2019s unique standing in terms of significant transaction volume indicates a potential shift in investor behavior and network activity. As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, observing how Cardano sustains and builds upon this momentum will be crucial in understanding its role in the broader market.\n\nDisclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

        "content": "By leveraging NEAR DA, Polygon developers can enjoy substantial reductions in data availability costs, enhancing the overall efficiency of their rollups.\n\nThe collaboration between the NEAR Foundation and Polygon Labs marks an important milestone in Ethereum scaling. By integrating NEAR Data Availability (NEAR DA) with Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK), developers using Polygon CDK now have access to NEAR DA\u2019s efficient and highly scalable data availability layer.\n\nNEAR DA plays a crucial role in simplifying Ethereum rollup networks, reducing costs, and ensuring high scalability. It provides rollup builders with a reliable and efficient data availability solution, allowing them to focus on their core transaction logic. With Polygon CDK, developers can create customized Layer 2 chains using zero-knowledge (ZK) technology while maintaining compatibility with Ethereum.\n\nThe integration of NEAR DA with Polygon CDK brings significant benefits to rollup builders. Developers can enjoy substantial reductions in data availability costs, enhancing the overall efficiency of their rollups. It empowers developers using Polygon Chain Development Kit to adopt NEAR\u2019s solution as an important component in their modular data availability solutions.\n\nIllia Polosukhin, Co-Founder of NEAR Protocol expressing his thoughts about the collaboration said:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to make NEAR DA available to Polygon CDK rollup builders and share the benefits of cost-effective, lightning-fast data availability that scales with NEAR\u2019s sharding for the modular Ethereum ecosystem. This is another exciting collaboration between NEAR Foundation and Polygon Labs to drive Chain Abstraction and create better experiences for developers and users.\u201d\n\nThe comparison of calldata costs between NEAR DA and Ethereum Layer 1 also shows the significant advantages of utilizing NEAR\u2019s solution. When considering the price for 231 kB of calldata, NEAR proves to be a far more cost-effective option. This substantial difference in cost presents an exciting opportunity for developers to achieve substantial savings while maintaining the high level of security provided by the Ethereum network. The lower cost of calldata on NEAR enables developers to allocate their resources more efficiently, whether it be for building new applications or expanding existing ones.\n\nDriving Future Scaling with Open Collaboration\n\nMoreover, the integration opens up opportunities for developers to build their own rollups to become part of the Polygon ecosystem. This expands the range of options available for scalable data availability solutions.\n\nThe collaboration between NEAR and Polygon also builds upon their joint research efforts, focusing on the development of zkWASM technology. This technology enables interoperability between the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM) ecosystems, paving the way for enhanced scalability and multi-chain compatibility.\n\nFor teams interested in integrating NEAR DA into their projects, an opportunity awaits as they can now explore its numerous benefits and possibilities by making their proposals. This collaboration also signifies a significant step forward in the quest for Ethereum scaling and empowers developers to build innovative solutions with enhanced data availability, scalability, and at a reduced cost."

The new date is set for March 5, 2024, by which the commission will unveil its decision to either approve or reject the proposal.\n\nFidelity Investments is not alone in pursuing an Ethereum ETF proposal, as BlackRock and Grayscale also await the commission\u2019s nod on their applications.\n\nIs the SEC Likely to Approve Ethereum ETFs?\n\nThe unpredictable nature of the Securities and Exchange Commission makes it challenging to predict a definitive outcome of the proposals.\n\nBloomberg analyst James Seyffart emphasized that a deadline extension is \u201ccompletely expected\u201d at this time.\n\nFidelity #ethereum ETF delayed just now. Completely expected. Dates that really matter are late May in my view. https://t.co/8mvhcPRaS7 \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 18, 2024\n\nThe nearest Ethereum ETF verdict deadline, slated for January 25, 2024, is for Grayscale\u2019s application. However, industry predictions suggest that approval in January remains improbable, and a May decision is a more plausible timeframe.\n\nRecent remarks from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, highlighting Ethereum\u2019s potential as a \u201cstore of value,\u201d have fueled speculation about a potential approval.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nBitcoin ETFs have experienced an impressive run since their launch, attracting over $10 billion in inflows .\n\nThe potential approval of Ethereum ETFs would signal an even more favorable regulatory stance from the SEC, building on the positive precedent set by the approval of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nInvesco, VanEck, and WisdomTree have also filed Ethereum ETF proposals with the SEC.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nWhile the Bitcoin ETF approval marks a positive shift in the SEC\u2019s approach to the industry, Chair Gensler was clear that this does not signal a pro-crypto stance. The commission remains cautious, and the extension of Fidelity Investments\u2019 Ethereum ETF deadline suggests efforts to align perspectives before making a final decision.\n\nRead more on foreign regulatory approaches to Bitcoin ETFs:\n\nBitcoin ETFs Banned in Singapore Over Eligibility Concerns\n\nSui teamed up with Stork to enhance DeFi solutions; find out more:\n\nSui Foundation Taps Stork to Boost DeFi Pricing Data"

Crucial breakout above 0.00045 BTC, if that breaks, a run to 0.0008-0.001 BTC seems next.\u201d\n\nLooking at his chart, the trader suggests that LINK/BTC is on the verge of a trend reversal and about to break through a key resistance level at 0.0004480 BTC ($18.63).\n\nLINK/BTC is trading for 0.0003741 BTC ($15.59) at time of writing.\n\nThe trader also weighs in on Bitcoin as the crypto king dipped to the low $40,000s this week. He believes Bitcoin is in the early stages of a bull market cycle and wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a correction to the $36,000 level.\n\n\u201cBitcoin isn\u2019t into a bear market; it\u2019s at the start of a new bull cycle. However, as it\u2019s at the start of a new bull cycle, discussions will be heavy between the two groups\u2026\n\nPerhaps we\u2019re there already for Bitcoin, but it seems likely that we\u2019ll test lower before we can have a reversal back up.

        "content": "In a daring forecast, the co-founders of the well-known cryptocurrency analytics firm Glassnode, operating under the X account Negentropic, have predicted that Solana (SOL) could surpass Ethereum (ETH) by an impressive 500%. Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, the masterminds behind Glassnode, conveyed their positive outlook on Solana\u2019s potential to outperform Ethereum. They drew inspiration from a recent interview featuring macroeconomist Henrik Zeberg and Global Macroinvestor CEO Raoul Pal.\n\nPositive Projections for Solana\n\nThe optimistic perspective on Solana from Glassnode\u2019s founders emerged during a discussion regarding the potential for a substantial rally in the SOL/ETH chart. In an interview exploring risk-adjusted returns, the co-founders were asked about their preferences for a $10,000 investment over 12 months. This came with a focus on Ethereum and Solana. Pal and Zeberg, after analyzing Solana\u2019s recent performance trend, expressed confidence in its significant momentum. They further anticipate it to surpass Ethereum in the foreseeable future.\n\nWe all watched @HenrikZeberg and @RaoulGMI talking on @cryptomanran Banter Show about SOL-ETH ratio.\n\n\n\nThey both agreed it looks BULLISH.\n\n\n\nBut \u2013 just how much could the ratio rally?\n\n\n\nThis chart suggests, that the #SOLETH ratio could rise to ~0.76 from current level of ~0.14.\n\n\n\nIn\u2026 pic.twitter.com/JQOD8ImN1Z January 17, 2024\n\nSOL/ETH Chart Predictions\n\nGlassnode\u2019s analytical insights further delve into the SOL/ETH ratio, presently at around 0.14. Happel and Allemann anticipate a substantial increase in this ratio, projecting it to reach approximately 0.76. This chart projection suggests a potential four to five-fold outperformance of Solana compared to Ethereum. This is as the cryptocurrency market advances through the ongoing bull season. Negentropic highlighted that SOL may outperform ETH by 4-5X as the cryptocurrency market peaks.\n\nExpectations of a Bullish Rally\n\nDespite a recent 4.7% decline, with Solana trading at $94.93, and Ethereum experiencing a 1.75% dip to $2,482.80 over the past week, Glassnode\u2019s founders maintain optimism about both cryptocurrencies. Their projections indicate that Solana\u2019s potential to outperform Ethereum is not an isolated occurrence, as they anticipate a significant bullish rally for both assets.\n\nAlso Read: Solana: Weekly $100 in SOL Since FTX Crash is Worth This Much\n\nCurrent Trajectories\n\nDespite the recent weekly decline, Solana has demonstrated a robust one-year trajectory of 340.43%, surging from $20. In comparison, Ethereum\u2019s one-year trajectory, while still noteworthy at 59%, indicates growth from $1,515. The disparity in these trajectories underscores the confidence of Glassnode\u2019s founders in Solana\u2019s capability to outperform Ethereum in the coming months.\n\nAlso Read: Solana-Based Memecoin WIF Surges 250% After Binance Listing\n\nThe bullish forecasts from Glassnode\u2019s founders introduce a compelling angle to the ongoing rivalry between Solana and Ethereum. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, investors will closely monitor whether Solana can live up to the optimistic predictions and outpace Ethereum by the projected 500%. The interplay between these prominent cryptocurrencies promises an intriguing storyline as the bull season unfolds."

Originally, the regulatory body had a deadline of January 18th to determine the fate of Fidelity\u2019s Ether ETF bid.\n\nHowever, the SEC opted to invoke a 45-day delay to allow more time to examine the proposed rule change and address associated considerations carefully.\n\nThis resets the SEC\u2019s deadline clock to March 5, 2024, for ruling on the ETF. The extension permits comprehensive scrutiny to ensure adequate investor protections around the novel crypto-based fund.\n\nThe delayed decision comes amid the SEC\u2019s recent approval of several Bitcoin ETFs.

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst says that Bitcoin (BTC) may soon lose support and fall even further.\n\nPseudonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital tells his 388,500 followers on the social media platform X that the loss of support has not yet been confirmed.\n\n\u201cBTC is losing the Range Low as support\n\nThis is not confirmed yet however\n\nA Weekly Close below the Range Low is needed as previously price would downside wick here\n\nWeekly Close below the Range Low would kickstart the breakdown process.\u201d\n\nBTC is worth $40,950 at time of writing, down 4% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDeep diving into Ethereum (ETH) in his latest Altcoin Newsletter, the analyst wonders if the leading smart contract platform by market cap\u2019s recent rally is almost over.\n\n\u201cEthereum performed a +19% move across the entirety of its red-red range, revisiting the Range High area, pretty much completing its +22% move from Range Low to Range High, narrowly missing the top of the range by some +2%.\n\nIs this move over?\u201d\n\nThe analyst says ETH could drop to the range low again, and that test could potentially be volatile for Ethereum\u2019s value.\n\n\u201cSo if the retest is a volatile one, similar to what we saw last month, ETH could drop into the very low $2000s as per this adjusted green path.\n\nHowever, if we see an even more volatile retest there, then the green macro Higher Low could come into play as a key support in the highs $1900s\u2026\n\nIt all depends on the extent of volatility at this Range Low support, which is difficult to assess ahead of time; after all, how can we assess the level of emotionality ahead of time?\u201d\n\nOverall, the trader believes ETH has completed its big move for the time being.\n\n\u201cThis $2740-$2791 range has acted as a re-accumulation range in the previous cycle.\n\nCould it become one of the same in this cycle as well?\u201d\n\nETH is trading for $2,470 at time of writing, down 8% in the last week.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The crypto market faced a long battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) when it attempted to secure a spot in Bitcoin ETF, which finally came to fruition when the court interfered. Now, it seems like Ethereum is set to witness the same ordeal as the SEC is taking two steps back after rejecting the spot ETH ETF application.\n\nBitcoin price continued its decline closer to $41,000 on Friday. At the time of writing, BTC price is $41,148. Institutions like Tether and MicroStrategy are keen on BTC accumulation and the largest cryptocurrency\u2019s ETFs have dethroned Silver as the second largest commodity.\n\nDogecoin price has emerged as one of the most disappointing crypto assets over the past month, noting consistent declines. The lack of growth has been such that even retail investors have taken a step back from participating in conducting transactions. Thus, the burden now falls on whales who are attempting to initiate a comeback for the meme coin.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

        "content": "The altcoin market has been witnessing huge progress since the turn of the year, with many cryptocurrencies experiencing an uptrend. Following the approval of the Bitcoin ETF, Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Arbitrum (ARB) holders may be set for more profit as the tokens become more bullish. Meanwhile, crypto analysts have picked Pullix (PLX) as one of the best cryptos to invest in right now, with a potential to surge by 100x at launch. Let\u2019s find out about these tokens and see how they are dominating the market.\n\nPullix (PLX): Combining the Strengths of Centralized and Decentralized Worlds\n\nAlthough Ethereum Classic and Arbitrum are flying high in the market, the prospect of Pullix is getting more attention than imagined. With some of the centralized and decentralized exchanges having transparency and liquidity issues, Pullix will act as an all-in-one platform that offers the functionalities of both services.\n\nPullix allows investors to take control of their assets by offering them a chance to personally hold the key to their wallet. This allows more security effectiveness on the exchange, eliminates third-party intervention, and makes users the sole protector of their assets.\n\nPullix has tons of features lined up for investors. From yield farming to staking, Pullix allows investors to stake their assets and access the liquidity pool. Not only that, users can trade features such as perpetual futures, contract for differences (CFD), and securely store their crypto on their own terms.\n\nThe PLX token will be used across the platform for transactional payment and is available at the presale price of $0.08. Holders of this token will get cashback, promotional offers, and bonuses as rewards for their commitment. With a projected 580% rise in the presale and 100x by launch, analysts are bullish on Pullix and have picked it as one of the best cryptos to invest in now.\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities\n\nIs Arbitrum Set for a $3 Rally After the Latest Upswing?\n\nAn 86% rise in the past month has seen Arbitrum (ARB) climb the crypto ladder, seating prettily as a top crypto in terms of trading volume. A look at the Arbitrum technical charts indicates that most key performance indicators are trending in a bullish pattern such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the 20-period exponential moving average (EMA).\n\nAnalysts attribute this to the sellers who are taking control of the token. Arbitrum broke out of the $2 threshold and is now eyeing the next resistance level of $2.35. With the bullish momentum set to continue, Arbitrum price may rally to the $3 mark by the Q1 of 2024.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) Bullish With a Price Increase of Almost 30%\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) is enjoying a resurgence after falling continuously to bear pressure. Over the last month, the Ethereum Classic price has surged by 30% in the trading charts, with a higher probability for more upward momentum.\n\nAnalysts believe only a strong bearish pressure can stop the current trajectory of Ethereum Classic. If this doesn\u2019t happen, Ethereum Classic could see a major upswing that can surge the price above the $29.73 resistance mark in the upcoming weeks.\n\n\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities"

        "content": "It\u2019s important to understand the shifts in the market ahead of time to stay profitable. As of now, Ethereum, ENS, and Maker are a few large-cap assets awaiting a series of price corrections in the coming days.\n\nThey are expected to shed weight this month, unless a broader bull run takes over the market.\n\nIs it Time to Sell Ethereum, ENS, and Maker?\n\nWhether it is Ethereum, Ethereum Name Service, or Maker, each of these assets has proven its market relevance. Their ecosystem trajectory over the years has influenced the course of the blockchain market as a whole.\n\nExcept for short-term traders looking to take advantage of slight market movements, it may not be a good idea to sell high-cap assets now. Ethereum, in particular, stands to gain a lot this year, despite the price corrections.\n\nEthereum 1-month price action, CoinMarketCap\n\nWith Bitcoin-halving on the horizon, established assets are expected to reclaim their all-time highs toward the end of the year. In addition, the crypto market has a history of sending overbought assets to new highs. In the current turbulent environment, that is not an unlikely possibility.\n\nBut the next few dips will provide users with lower entry points into these projects. Underrated low-cap gems, on the other hand, make better investments now. Here are two cryptocurrencies that have been bucking the broader market bullish trends over the last few days.\n\n1. Meme Kombat Crosses the $7M Milestone\n\nMeme Kombat is the most viral meme coin of this month, although it has yet to be launched on crypto exchanges.\n\nThe AI-based GambleFi token crossed the $7M milestone in its presale amid the chaos that unfolded in the broader market. The growing traffic to the presale hints that investors have found a haven in the meme coin, which will be launched after the bear market trends retreat.\n\nWe go big on community and @BuryCrypto recognizes that\ud83c\udf89 Check out his video on $MK being one of the best crypto presales to engage with right now! pic.twitter.com/DGIedfOdBz \u2014 Meme Kombat (@Meme_Kombat) January 16, 2024\n\nIt makes more sense to pour money into the low-cap asset than established, high-cap cryptos like ETH that are looking at more price corrections.\n\nMeme Kombat Marks a Much-Needed Evolution of GambleFi\n\nMeme Kombat\u2019s rise to prominence is a nod to the growing opinion that GambleFi could use some diversity. Although the sector broke records last year with Rollbit Coin, which went on to chart a 5000%+ growth, it is flooded with casinos and sports betting platforms now.\n\nAddressing the dearth of diversity in GambleFi, Meme Kombat launches an AI-powered battle arena where meme coin icons wage wars for supremacy. Being powered by AI, the integrity of these battles and their outcomes are strong, and impervious to fraud. The blockchain foundation fortifies the transparent framework.\n\nSocial Media War Channeled for Staking Rewards\n\nMeme Kombat streams the social media conflicts waged by meme coin communities onto its novel platform, where users can place bets on their outcomes. Attractive rewards in $MK tokens await users who make accurate predictions.\n\nThe launch of Meme Kombat Season 1 will fuel the demand for $MK tokens, even as the initial engagement surrounding its exchange listings wanes.\n\nA Potential Threat to $BONK?\n\nDespite BONK\u2019s current standing as the third-largest meme coin, the launch of Meme Kombat could call for a change in positions. The diminishing value of BONK since its peak in December has further led to a surge in interest in the new meme coin.\n\nInvestors are taking advantage of the lowest possible entry points to $MK tokens with the ongoing presale. A staking system further adds to the appeal of the opportunity.\n\nBUY $MK TOKENS FOR THE PRESALE PRICE\n\nCloud Mining Token Bitcoin Minetrix Presale is About to Sell Out\n\nBitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) is another project that has been reaping benefits from the current bear market. The presale of the cloud mining token has raised 8,729,261 so far.\n\nBut there is more going on for $BTCMTX than the dynamic shifts in the BTC market and the unfolding ETF developments. As a stake-to-mine project that focuses on simplifying BTC mining, Bitcoin Minetrix makes the sector accessible to a wider audience.\n\nRooted in utility, it provides a user-friendly dashboard where individuals can stake their tokens in exchange for BTC mining credits. Distributed as non-transferable ERC20 tokens, the mining credits are safeguarded against thefts and hacks.\n\nAlthough the conventional mining sector is highly profitable, it is currently exclusive to those with substantial investment capital and technical expertise. The industry\u2019s distribution contradicts the decentralized ethos of the market.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix Democratizes Mining\n\nBitcoin Minetrix addresses the limited accessibility of mining benefits with its staking platform. It will provide retail investors with an attractive passive income source. It is an excellent alternative to existing cloud mining platforms that come with a high risk of scams, coupled with initial hardware investment and contractual commitments.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s straightforward approach requires users only to stake $BTCMTX tokens.\n\nLast Opportunity to Buy $BTCMTX for the Presale Price\n\nThe presale, now in the last phases, presents the last opportunity to get a low entry point into the investment. Analysts Austin Hilton and Michael Wrubel have featured the project, showcasing its relevance on their popular YouTube channels.\n\nBUY $BTCMTX TOKENS FOR THE PRESALE PRICE\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs have entered their fifth trading day, and it appears that the institutional hype is just beginning. Franklin Templeton, one of the world\u2019s largest asset managers, expressed optimism about the future of Ethereum, Solana, and other layer 1 chains in a series of tweets posted yesterday.\n\nFranklin Templeton acknowledged Ethereum\u2019s challenges but remains bullish about its future. The firm cited four key factors contributing to Ethereum\u2019s promise: the upcoming Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, alternative data availability (Alt DA), community revitalization efforts, and re-staking mechanisms.\n\nWe are excited about ETH and its ecosystem. Despite the midlife crisis it's recently experienced, we see a bright future with many strong tailwinds to push the Ethereum ecosystem forward\n\n-EIP 4844\n\n-Alt DA\n\n-Community Revitalization\n\n-Restaking \u2014 Franklin Templeton (@FTI_US) January 17, 2024\n\nThe company is also interested in the vision of Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana\u2019s co-founder. Significant developments in Solana\u2019s ecosystem, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2023, caught the firm\u2019s attention. These include advancements in decentralized prediction market initiatives (DePIN), decentralized finance (DeFi), the proliferation of meme coins, NFT innovation, and the introduction of Solana\u2019s scaling solution, Firedancer.\n\nBeyond Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, the firm sees potential in other layer 1 networks. Franklin Templeton said it would actively support, monitor, and develop these networks as they grow and mature.\n\nOrdinals and layer 2 Bitcoin protocols also stand out in these tweets. The firm highlights their capacity to address Bitcoin\u2019s economic security challenges and elevate its Store of Value (SoV) role.\n\nFranklin Templeton highlights improvements in blockchain technology, including reduced fees and enhanced performance. The company believes that these technological advancements are key to unlocking new use cases and improving blockchain\u2019s economics and user experience.\n\nFranklin Templeton has around $1,4 trillion in assets under management as of December 31, 2023.\n\nBefore the launch of Franklin Bitcoin ETF, the company joined BTIG and Broadhaven Ventures to back Receipts Depositary Corporation (RDC), a startup that plans to launch the first-ever Bitcoin Depositary Receipts."

        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nBitcoin ($BTC) Spot ETFs attracted more trading volume than all other ETFs launched this year. The TradFi appetite is there. And next in line for its own Spot ETF is Ethereum ($ETH). Traders rotated immediately following the approval, and despite it being counter-intuitive, $ETH has strongly outperformed $BTC since.\n\n\n\nWhen investors understand that markets are forward-looking, $ETH outperforming $BTC starts to make sense, and the path forward becomes visible. If $BTC has already had its moment, and Ethereum is stepping into the limelight now, the natural conclusion is that in the coming weeks/ months it will be altcoins\u2019 turn in the sun. What crypto to buy today before altcoin season begins? $ETH and Galaxy Fox ($GFOX) cover all bases. Will we see Ethereum at $4k in 2024? Galaxy Fox smashes $2.8 million in its presale. A precursor to altcoin season?\n\n\n\nEthereum Targeting $4,000 In 2024?\n\n\n\nEthereum is already up more than 17% this month, and the anticipation of an ETF is driving more and more hot money into this trade. BlackRock\u2019s stellar ETF approval record and the already approved $BTC ETF make this an easy trade. Remember $BTC\u2019s ETF-driven rally from $25,000 to $40,000. Now it is Ethereum\u2019s turn.\n\n\n\nRollups and other Ethereum betas have been flying, and the scheduled EIP-4844 upgrade will provide a substantial technical catalyst for increased adoption. Introducing a new transaction type for rollups will drastically reduce gas fees for end users and solidify $ETH\u2019s role as money in different execution environments. If the rollup/ modularity thesis plays out, eventually, rollups will become the largest purchasers of Ethereum blockspace, replacing end users.\n\nEthereum is a technological bet on crypto\u2019s settlement layer, and buying $ETH is a great response to which crypto to buy today for long-term exposure to the industry. Reaching $4,000 this year involves a 60% move to the upside. ETF frontrunners are already piling in, and a massive expected increase in use across layer twos will result in rollups buying more and more $ETH. The buy pressure is there, and $ETH can easily target $4,000 this year. The real question is whether it will hit $10,000 this cycle.\n\n\n\nGalaxy Fox ($GFOX) Raises $2.8 Million\n\nGalaxy Fox has shot past $2.8 million in funding as investors read the writing on the walls. Ethereum flying means altcoin season is incoming, and the most explosive gainers will be presales situated in growing narratives. What crypto to buy today before altcoin season? Projects exactly like $GFOX. Market caps rule the world in bullish sentiment, and small market caps equal explosive upside.\n\n\n\nThe unique hybrid design of this protocol locates it in both the GameFi and memecoin narratives, and early success in raising funding clearly indicates a bullish future. The Web3 runner game at the heart of this ecosystem enables players to compete globally, with the top 20% of the leaderboard rewarded at the end of each season.\n\n\n\nNFT ownership allows players to upgrade their in-game stats, adding a new dimension to this P2E game. Staking rewards unlock passive income for all $GFOX hodlers, not just the most-skilled players. And this divergence from the classic P2E model gives Galaxy Fox a far broader market appeal.\n\n\n\nPresale participants will be among the first to stake their tokens in the Stargate module. Taxes fund these payouts introducing a direct correlation between staking payouts and ecosystem activity. Staking during $GFOX\u2019s price discovery phase will be incredibly lucrative. The token burn ensures all these rewards are deflationary, and a perfect storm is brewing to propel $GFOX into the big leagues.\n\nClosing Thoughts: Altcoins & Ethereum In 2024\n\n\n\nGoing long Ethereum is a simple play, and when it reaches $4,000, investors have secured a 60% upside on their initial investment. Investors who want to juice their returns this cycle should be looking to Galaxy Fox. $GFOX easily ranks among the best cryptocurrencies to buy today, and its tiny market cap will allow early adopters to lock in 100X returns.\n\n\n\nAltcoins are the stars of the bull market, and regarding what crypto to buy today for maximum upside, the answer is and always will be presales. Join the Galaxy Fox ICO today and front-run altcoin season before it begins.\n\n\n\nLearn more about $GFOX here:\n\nVisit Galaxy Fox Presale | Join the Community"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has been on the rise over the last few months, breaking through resistance levels one by one. Yet, the cryptocurrency might have reached a potential turning point.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: The Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily chart, the market has been acting very bullish since breaking the 200-day moving average to the upside. It has been making consistently higher highs and lows, with the Relative Strength Index showing values above 50% the whole time.\n\nYet, the $2,700 resistance level decisively rejected the price to the downside last week. The market is currently consolidating below the mentioned level. Meanwhile, considering the availability of several support levels, investors can still be optimistic about the short-term trend.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nThe 4-hour chat paints a more clear picture of the recent price action. The cryptocurrency has been forming a falling wedge pattern since failing to break above the $2,700 resistance area.\n\nA bullish breakout from the wedge can result in a retest of the $2,700 level, while a breakdown would be catastrophic, as the price could drop toward the $2,100 level in no time.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum Funding Rates\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s price has been gaining momentum on the upside, market participants have become more optimistic that ETH will eventually make a new all-time high this year. Yet, too much optimism might be a worrying factor.\n\nThis chart presents the funding rates, one of the key metrics for futures market sentiment evaluation. Positive values indicate that buyers are more aggressive on aggregate, while negative values demonstrate that short sellers are executing their orders more aggressively.\n\nAnalyzing the chart, it is evident that the funding rates have been very positive for a while, showing values comparable to what was previously seen during the $69K all-time high range. As a result, the probability of a long liquidation cascade is very high at the moment. These potential liquidations could lead to a significant drop in the coming weeks."

As profits surged to noteworthy milestones, the number of holders has also steadily risen.\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum hit historic profit levels\n\nAn analysis of Santiment data showed that Bitcoin and Ethereum have achieved historic profit levels.\n\nAs of this writing, over 83% of the Bitcoin supply was in profit, although this marked a decline from the 89% observed at the beginning of the year.\n\nSimilarly, the Ethereum supply in profit was currently over 84%, slightly down from the over 85% recorded at the start of the year. It\u2019s worth noting that the current profit levels for these assets are historic because the last time such levels were observed was in 2021.\n\nMore Bitcoin and Ethereum holders keep emerging\n\nAn analysis of Bitcoin and Ethereum holders on Santiment showed a parallel growth with the rising supply in profit.\n\nExamining the total number of Bitcoin holders from August 2023 to the present, there has been an addition of over 4 million holders.\n\nAs of this writing, the number of BTC holders was almost 53 million. Also, the chart showed an upward trend, signifying an ongoing increase in holders.\n\nSimilarly, an analysis of the total number of Ethereum holders during the same period showed an increase of over 9 million.\n\nAs of this writing, the number of ETH holders was nearly 113 million. Also, like BTC, there was a noticeable upward trend in the chart, indicating a consistent rise in the number of holders.\n\nETH maintains a bull trend while BTC falls from it\n\nThe daily timeframe chart for Ethereum showed recent fluctuations between profits and losses.\n\nDespite this, the price has sustained higher than those observed in the preceding months. As of this writing, Ethereum was trading at around $2,500, experiencing a decline of less than 1%.\n\nDespite this, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests a strong bull trend, with the RSI just below 60.\n\nIn contrast, the daily timeframe chart for Bitcoin reflects a less favorable recent price performance. Trading at around $42,500 as of this writing, Bitcoin has encountered a decline of less than 1%, placing it in a bear zone.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the BTC Profit Calculator\n\nThe BTC RSI was below the neutral line, indicating a bearish trend.\n\nCoinMarketCap data revealed that the current circulating supply of Bitcoin was around 19.6 million, while Ethereum\u2019s circulating supply was about 120.1 million."

        "content": "\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the foremost cryptocurrency, witnessed a notable downturn, dipping below the $42,000 threshold on Friday. This marked its steepest fall since December 2023. The current price of Bitcoin stands at $41,332.95, with a 24-hour trading volume of approximately $26.61 billion.\n\nEthereum (ETH), trailing Bitcoin in market dominance, also encountered declines, with its price now at $2,493.55 and a trading volume of $11.44 billion over the same period. Ethereum\u2019s price has slipped by 0.79% in the last 24 hours.\n\n\ud83d\udd3b #Bitcoin Hits $41K as 'Sell the News' Trend Intensifies \ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/NmqXpnWsZ2 \u2014 Crypto Market Trends (@Cryptomarkets_) January 19, 2024\n\nThe global crypto market cap is currently valued at $1.62 trillion, experiencing a 3.23% decrease within a day. This bearish trend in the crypto market is largely attributed to escalated liquidations and a strengthening US dollar.\n\nAmidst these market challenges, Bitcoin\u2019s resilience is being tested, particularly in the face of shifting regulatory environments and pivotal market events such as the upcoming Bitcoin halving and the potential launch of a Bitcoin Spot ETF by Hong Kong\u2019s VSFG, which might catalyze a surge in BTC price.\n\nBitcoin Weathers Market Turbulence and Regulatory Changes\n\n\n\nDespite a 3.76% drop in the overall crypto market, Bitcoin (BTC) is holding steady at around $40,900, buoyed by investor interest in the newly approved Bitcoin Spot ETF. Ethereum (ETH) is exhibiting a similar pattern, with its performance under close scrutiny.\n\nRecent comments by JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who labeled Bitcoin as \u201cworthless,\u201d have introduced near-term uncertainty, impacting market sentiment and contributing to BTC\u2019s losses.\n\nBitcoin likes to tease, but it still did not make a lower low. It needs a decisive push and even if that happens, 40k support will be next which will likely bring back buyers. Question is why BTC is not pumping considering the ETFs have been net buyers. Who's selling? pic.twitter.com/HMyyZGD41T \u2014 Duo Nine \u26a1 YCC (@DU09BTC) January 19, 2024\n\nHowever, the broader outlook for Bitcoin remains cautiously optimistic. This sentiment is in anticipation of a possible Federal Reserve interest rate cut in March and Bitcoin\u2019s halving event in April 2024. Currently, BTC faces resistance at $42,620, while ETH, trading at $2,458, encounters resistance at $2,604.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Pre-Halving Impact and Spot ETF Dynamics\n\n\n\nThe upcoming Bitcoin halving event is poised to potentially trigger a price drop, potentially down to the $36-39K range, presenting a prime buying opportunity. The recent 3.62% decline in Bitcoin\u2019s value, now at $41,144.28, has garnered close attention from investors. Analysts are speculating on a possible pre-halving sell-off, likely influenced by the introduction of the Bitcoin Spot ETF, which could significantly affect institutional investment approaches.\n\nMarket enthusiasts are expecting institutions to capitalize on this potential downturn to acquire assets at lower prices ahead of a predicted bullish trend. Industry experts, including Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, highlight the strategic advantage of \u2018buying the dip\u2019 should prices hit the $36-39K mark.\n\nThey recommend focusing on long-term investment strategies, warning against succumbing to FOMO, and stressing the importance of the classic approach of buying low and selling high in the volatile crypto market.\n\nConsequently, the speculation surrounding a potential pre-halving sell-off and the impact of the Bitcoin Spot ETF are contributing to market volatility. Bitcoin\u2019s current price of $41,144.28 may witness significant fluctuations, offering both opportunities and risks for investors.\n\nVSFG\u2019s Bitcoin ETF Launch: A Turning Point for BTC Prices\n\n\n\nThe Bitcoin (BTC) market may soon receive a boost from Hong Kong-based Venture Smart Financial Holdings (VSFG), which plans to file for a spot Bitcoin ETF. This initiative aims to be the first of its kind in the region, pending approval from Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission. The Commission\u2019s guidelines for spot crypto funds, released last December, pave the way for this development.\n\nBrian Chan, the group head of investment at VSFG, sees considerable market potential and has set an ambitious target of reaching $500 million in assets under management by year-end. This move is part of a wider global trend where institutions are increasingly exploring the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in their markets.\n\nThe announcement by VSFG to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong could significantly influence BTC prices. It underscores growing institutional interest in Bitcoin and may draw substantial investments into the cryptocurrency, potentially marking a pivotal moment for BTC\u2019s market dynamics.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction"

        "title": "Ethereum ETF Awaits SEC Verdict New Deadline Set for March - CryptoCoin.News",
        "content": ".\n\nIn the dynamic world of cryptocurrency investments, a new development has emerged, capturing the attention of both investors and market analysts. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently extended its review period for the highly anticipated Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) proposed by Fidelity Investments. This decision underscores the complexities and evolving nature of cryptocurrency regulation.\n\nThe initial application for the Fidelity spot Ethereum ETF, filed in November 2023, marked a significant step towards mainstream acceptance of Ethereum as an investable asset. Joining forces with other financial giants like BlackRock, Ark Invest/21shares, and VanEck, Fidelity\u2019s move was seen as a bullish signal for the broader crypto market.\n\nHowever, in a recent filing, the SEC announced that the decision deadline has been moved to March 5, allowing the regulatory body more time to thoroughly examine the proposed rule changes and address the concerns raised. This delay, while not uncommon in the regulatory process, has sparked discussions among market observers.\n\nJames Seyffart, a renowned ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, wasn\u2019t surprised by the delay. He believes that the key dates to watch are later in May. Seyffart\u2019s perspective sheds light on the typical ebb and flow of regulatory decision-making, where extended timeframes are often necessary for comprehensive evaluations.\n\nAdding to the conversation, Seyffart\u2019s colleague Eric Balchunas, also an ETF analyst, recently expressed a positive outlook on the approval of an Ethereum ETF in 2024. During an appearance on Rug Radio\u2019s FOMO Hour, Balchunas estimated a 70% chance of an Ethereum ETF approval by May. He argues that the SEC\u2019s prior endorsement of Ethereum futures ETFs, following a similar path taken with Bitcoin futures ETFs, has somewhat cornered the regulator into a position where approving a spot Ethereum ETF seems more likely.\n\nBalchunas pointed out the SEC\u2019s recent approval of multiple spot Bitcoin ETF applications, a move that followed a court order mandating the review of Grayscale\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application. This development, according to Balchunas, creates a precedent that strengthens the case for an Ethereum spot ETF. He humorously remarked, \u201cIpso facto, you have to approve an Ether spot [ETF], or you\u2019re going to get sued again for the same exact reason.\u201d\n\nThe potential approval of an Ethereum ETF by the SEC would mark a significant milestone in the integration of cryptocurrencies into the mainstream investment landscape. Not only would it provide a regulated and transparent vehicle for investing in Ethereum, but it would also signify a broader acceptance and understanding of digital assets by U.S. regulatory bodies.\n\nThe coming weeks will be crucial as the March deadline approaches. Investors and analysts alike are keenly watching the SEC\u2019s decision, which could have far-reaching implications for the cryptocurrency market. The approval of a spot Ethereum ETF would not only bolster investor confidence in Ethereum but also pave the way for further innovation and integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional financial products.\n\nIn conclusion, the SEC\u2019s decision on Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum ETF is more than just a regulatory verdict; it\u2019s a touchstone moment in the evolution of cryptocurrency as a legitimate and recognized asset class. As the March deadline looms, the anticipation within the financial and cryptocurrency communities continues to build, highlighting the growing intersection of traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets."

        "content": "EigenLayer relies on a pooled security model that makes it cheaper to launch certain protocols.\n\nStill, that model may encourage risk-taking.\n\nOver the past two months, founder Sreeram Kannan has revealed a change that may minimise collateral damage.\n\nA forthcoming version of the billion-dollar EigenLayer protocol will let some users buy \u201cinsurance,\u201d a change that may quell sceptics\u2019 fears that the protocol could destabilise Ethereum.\n\nEigenLabs co-founder Sreeram Kannan detailed the change earlier this month in a series of posts on X.\n\nThe change, which Kannan had outlined during a presentation at a November conference in Istanbul, is highly technical.\n\nIn short, it is intended to reduce collateral damage suffered by EigenLayer\u2019s users in the event some of them fail or are successfully hacked.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nKannan did not return requests for comment.\n\nRestaking\n\nEthereum\u2019s security model requires that users lock up, or \u201cstake\u201d their Ether. The more Ether staked, the more an attacker would need to gain control of the network. Still, retail investors often find the process too technical or the capital requirement too high to stake Ether themselves.\n\nEigenLayer matches investors who hold Ether or staked Ether with individuals and companies known as node operators, who manage the capital and hardware necessary to run the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nEigenLayer then matches node operators with protocols that would otherwise require bespoke blockchains. EigenLayer calls these protocols actively validated services, or AVSs.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThis process, restaking, makes it possible to use the same capital to simultaneously secure Ethereum and a variety of other protocols.\n\nProponents have called it one of the most exciting developments on Ethereum, something that could make it safer, cheaper, and easier to launch new protocols.\n\nThe eight-month-old protocol has adopted a phased rollout, and its first AVSs have yet to launch. Nevertheless, it has already attracted more than $1.7 billion in user deposits.\n\nEigenLayer deposits topped $1 billion in December.\n\nSceptics, however, have questioned the protocol\u2019s potential impact on Ethereum as money pours in and its full launch approaches.\n\nPooled and attributable security\n\nThat is, in part, because EigenLayer currently uses a \u201cpooled\u201d security model, in which AVSs rely on the same pool of capital.\n\nSharing the cost to access that security across every AVS makes it more affordable and ensures that attacking any single AVS would require a massive amount of capital.\n\nAt the conference in Istanbul, Kannan likened pooled security to a military alliance.\n\n\u201cCities don\u2019t have armies, nations have armies. Sometimes even many nation states coordinate to create alliances that actually work together,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly the same phenomenon. Shared security is strictly better.\u201d\n\nIt may also introduce some unproductive incentives.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re incentivizing people to basically take on more risk with security that\u2019s being subsidised by other people,\u201d Chunda McCain, founder of Ion Protocol, told DL News.\n\n\u201cIf you assume now that everyone\u2019s hand-in-hand, you know, all working together for the betterment of Ethereum, only building the most robust and resilient systems, then it\u2019s great, right?\u201d McCain continued.\n\n\u201cAs soon as you say, \u2018OK, no, this is a permissionless protocol that anyone can build on top of,\u2019 then you\u2019re like, \u2018Wait a second, this system doesn\u2019t make sense\u2019.\u201d\n\nA future version of EigenLayer will still feature pooled security, but it will also give AVSs the option to purchase \u201cattributable security,\u201d a feature that Kannan has likened to insurance.\n\nAttributable security gives an AVS a claim on a certain amount of restaked capital that it can seize and redistribute in the event something goes wrong.\n\nThat allows them to enjoy the benefits of pooled security while limiting collateral damage to node operators, restakers, and other AVSs in the event one fails.\n\nAVSs will likely pay a premium for that, according to Kratik Lodha, a founder contributor at Renzo, a liquid restaking protocol.\n\n\u201cAs an AVS, when you are attracting attributable security you will ideally incentivise that capital more, as it\u2019s solely dedicated to securing you and not any other AVS,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe see a hybrid model developing between the two wherein AVSs can have both [of] the security models and differently incentivise each.\u201d\n\nGiven concern over the leverage that restaking could introduce to the Ethereum ecosystem, adding attributable security may address some of the criticism.\n\n\u201cIt definitely is less rehypothecation than pooled security,\u201d said Meir Bank, co-founder of Anzen, a protocol under development that will attempt to automate AVS\u2019s payments to node operators.\n\n\u201cIf the concern is just about the amount of rehypothecation, attributable security is less rehypothecated by definition.\u201d\n\nSlow and steady\n\nMcCain said that some AVSs will form coalitions in order to save money on insurance \u2014 those that trust one another may opt to split the cost rather than purchasing it individually.\n\nWhile making the EigenLayer ecosystem safer, this could effectively raise the cost to launch AVSs using the protocol.\n\n\u201cYou decrease the cost of capital to some extent, but it\u2019s not like the orders-of-magnitude decrease that you would get by pooling security across thousands of applications,\u201d McCain said. \u201cBecause technically now the attributable security is a couple applications, or maybe a dozen at a time.\u201d\n\nEigenLayer has not given a timeline for introducing attributable security. Node operators and an EigenLabs-built AVS are expected to launch in the first half of 2024, with third-party AVSs to follow.\n\n\u201cThe EigenLayer team, they\u2019re not going at the fastest speed because they actually want to get these things right,\u201d Bank said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s important for the long-term security of Ethereum.\u201d"

        "content": "MetaMask, the non-custodial wallet developed by Consensys, has launched Validator Staking on MetaMask Portfolio, enabling users to run their own Ethereum validator nodes but with a 10% fee.\n\nAs per the Jan. 18 announcement, the feature will allow users to operate their Ethereum validator node without the complexities of pooling or the need for specialized hardware.\n\nIntroducing Validator Staking on MetaMask Portfolio.\ud83e\udd8a\n\n\n\nWith a 32 ETH deposit, we run your very own validator node where you're always in control.\n\n\n\nNo pooling. No hardware.

Staking through MetaMask offers an annual yield of 3.8%, from which the platform deducts a 10% commission on validator rewards.\n\nThe fee structure has drawn criticism from some industry experts, like Lefteris Karapetsas, founder of Rotkiapp, who pointed out the relative unattractiveness of the service compared to other options in the market.\n\nInteresting idea but a 10% fee makes it a completely unattractive option for any user who bothers to compare with the other available options out there. https://t.co/vSzBQwPL8f pic.twitter.com/GeuaYUm2RL \u2014 Lefteris Karapetsas | Hiring for @rotkiapp (@LefterisJP) January 18, 2024\n\nThe net yields from staking through MetaMask, after accounting for its fees, are comparable to the 3.4% offered by Lido.\n\nIn the broader context of Ethereum staking, Lido currently stands as the predominant liquid staking platform, with about 40% of the total 28.8 million ETH staked, which translates to around $22.9 billion.\n\nEthereum holders also have the option of using centralized exchanges for staking, such as Coinbase, though they charge a significantly higher 25% cut on staking rewards.\n\nThis latest development follows MetaMask\u2019s recent expansion of its global footprint. In December, the company announced new partnerships in several countries, including Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Egypt, and Chile, aiming to offer users more localized options.\n\nThrough collaborations with various payment solutions, such as VietQR, GCash, and QRIS, MetaMask is making strides in integrating its services into the financial ecosystems of these regions.\n\nMetamask also extended its reach to Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, offering additional support for local transfers through strategic alliances with Unlimit, a borderless payment solution, and TransFi.\n\nRead more: MetaMask urges immediate update for mobile users after bug fix\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "The giants Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are once again creating ripples reminiscent of their historic growth patterns. Recent research reports by Coinbase Research and Glassnode reveal a staggering similarity between the current market conditions and the period from 2018 to 2022. During this timeframe, Bitcoin witnessed a remarkable surge of 500%, while Ethereum soared by an astonishing 1,000%.\n\nParallel Patterns and Market Cycles\n\nAnalysts are pointing to various cyclicality metrics, such as net unrealized profit/loss and supply in profit, to draw parallels between the ongoing crypto market cycle and the preceding ones. These metrics indicate that the current state of the crypto markets is not exhibiting the euphoria witnessed at the peak of 2023. Instead, it suggests that there might be further potential for significant market surges.\n\nDespite the optimism surrounding the forthcoming Bitcoin halving, Coinbase Research remains cautious. The paper notes a lack of robust supporting evidence and characterizes the relationship between the halving and market performance as somewhat speculative. This cautious stance reflects a commitment to thorough analysis and a recognition of the unpredictable nature of the crypto market.\n\nEthereum's Triumph and Upcoming Upgrade\n\nIn 2023, Ethereum experienced a surge of over 90%, attributed to factors such as the success of the Shapella upgrade and the increasing likelihood of approval for spot crypto ETFs. Market participants were quick to embrace these developments, contributing to the notable increase in Ethereum's value.\n\nAnalysts are now setting their sights on the upcoming Ethereum upgrade named Cancun. Expected to enhance scalability and security, the upgrade aims to make layer-2 transactions as cost-effective as possible. The successful implementation of Cancun could potentially lead to a significant increase in the number of processed transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe Graph (GRT): A Rising Star\n\nAmidst the buzz surrounding the top crypto coins, The Graph (GRT) emerges as a rising star. With its focus on decentralized data indexing and query protocol for the Web3 ecosystem, The Graph has garnered increased attention from investors. As a decentralized oracle, The Graph provides a bridge between smart contracts and off-chain data, contributing to the efficiency and functionality of decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nInvestors eyeing altcoins to watch have turned their attention to The Graph for its innovative approach to data organization and retrieval within the blockchain space. As the crypto market continues to evolve, The Graph stands as a notable player with the potential for significant growth.\n\nRebel Satoshi Emerges in the Crypto Scene\n\nAmidst the buzz surrounding the top crypto coins, a new player has entered the scene\u2014Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ). Offering a unique proposition, Rebel Satoshi allows users to explore 9,999 unique NFTs, creating a vibrant marketplace for exclusive digital art and collectibles.\n\nInvestors in Rebel Satoshi not only have the opportunity to explore unique assets representing Rebel Satoshi and other characters but also stand a chance to be featured in the Rebel Meme Hall of Fame.

        "content": "Although the price of Bitcoin has been flat since the SEC approved spot ETFs. However, a prominent Bloomberg ETF analyst has pointed to the remarkable volumes being recorded across spot BTC ETFs.\n\nThe top altcoins looking to capitalize on this growth are Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Pullix (PLX). Analysts expect the price of ETC to jump above $30 while PLX prepares for a 10x rally. Let\u2019s find out why these are the best altcoins in the market now.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF Products Near $10 Billion in Three Days\n\nThe cryptocurrency market celebrated a landmark moment when spot ETFs were approved by the SEC. Investors haven\u2019t yet seen the anticipated price hike upon spot ETF approval, but there are indications that this is about to happen.\n\nPopular Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart clarified that in just three days of open trading, the total volume across these ETFs reached $9.771 billion. The amount in GBTC is $5.174 billion. This enormous amount demonstrates the institutional investors\u2019 intense interest in Bitcoin.\n\nMany cryptocurrency specialists are therefore optimistic about BTC. Analysts predict that Bitcoin will soon reach $50,000 even if the price hasn\u2019t been able to overcome the $44,000 obstacle since the acceptance. With the halving happening soon, Standard Chartered has tipped Bitcoin to hit $200,000 by late 2025.\n\nPullix (PLX) Soars 100%, Looks Forward To 10x Surge\n\nPullix (PLX) is one of the top altcoins that have defied the Bitcoin downtrend. The price of the DeFi coin has increased by 100% to touch a new high of $0.08. However, as the launch of the Pullix platform approaches, analysts have forecasted a 10x price surge for the PLX DeFI coin.\n\nMarket experts are bullish about PLX because of its hybrid exchange, which wants to change the crypto trading space. As a hybrid exchange, Pullix offers low fees, very quick transactions, self-custody, increased efficiency, and privacy. A key differential of Pullix is the access to multiple markets. Users can trade stocks, forex, and commodities on this DeFi project.\n\nAnother feature that has attracted users to Pullix is its earning opportunities. Users can earn PLX tokens by contributing to liquidity through staking LP Tokens. Every transaction on the Pullix Swap exchange incurs a small fee of 0.25%, which is then added to the Pullix pool as LP tokens.\n\nThese LP tokens are converted into PLX and distributed among Pullix LP token holders in the pool. This process not only enhances the value of their holdings but also offers consistent growth in their investment without the need for active management.\n\nThe Pullix team has announced that the DeFi project will be launched before the end of the first quarter. This has excited users, with investors raising over $3.8 million in just a few weeks.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) Soars 40%, Set To Reclaim $30\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) has been one of the best altcoins since the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. The price of ETC has increased by more than 24% on the weekly chart and as much as 40% over the last month. Thanks to this massive surge, the Ethereum Classic price topped $30 for the first time since September 2022.\n\nAlthough the Ethereum Classic price has retracted under this key support level, analysts remain optimistic about ETC. A major reason is that the project has dissolved its core team as it transitions into decentralized community governance. Seen as a major move in the future of Ethereum Classic, ETC is expected to rise in the coming weeks.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nThe rising volume across spot BTC ETFs suggests a bigger trend could be happening for Bitcoin. However, Ethereum Classic and Pullix have already emerged as one of the top beneficiaries. However, as the launch of Pullix approaches, analysts have forecasted a 10x surge for PLX. This makes now the perfect time to join the Pullix train.\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThe year 2024 is shaping up to be a landmark year in the world of cryptocurrencies, with Chat GPT making bold predictions for prominent players like Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH).However, the spotlight is increasingly shifting towards a rising star in the decentralized finance (DeFi) realm \u2013 Retik Finance (RETIK), which is showing potential to outperform its more established counterparts.\n\nSolana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH): Predictions and Prospects\n\nSolana\u2019s 2024 Trajectory\n\nSolana, known for its high-speed transactions and low fees, is poised for a significant recovery in 2024. Chat GPT predicts a resurgence in SOL\u2019s value, considering its technical robustness and growing adoption.Solana\u2019s ability to handle up to 65,000 transactions per second positions it as a preferred choice for DeFi and NFT projects. This advantage could drive SOL\u2019s price upwards, potentially reaching the $200 mark, a significant increase from its current standing.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Progressive Outlook\n\nEthereum, the leading smart contract platform, is expected to continue its dominance, especially with its upcoming Ethereum Cancun upgrade. This upgrade, anticipated to increase scalability and efficiency significantly, is likely to draw more users and developers to the platform, bolstering ETH\u2019s price. Chat GPT foresees Ethereum potentially breaking past its previous all-time high, with a price target hovering around $5,000 by the end of 2024.While Solana and Ethereum have their strengths, Retik Finance is emerging as a formidable contender in the DeFi space. Priced attractively at $0.08, Retik Finance is not just another token in the crypto market; it\u2019s a revolution in the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nRetik Finance (RETIK): A New Era in DeFi\n\nDespite the promising outlook for SOL and ETH, Retik Finance is emerging as a potential market leader, offering groundbreaking innovations in DeFi.

These offerings are not just technological advancements but also practical solutions that address real-world financial challenges, bridging the gap between cryptocurrencies and everyday transactions.\n\nCertik Audit \u2013 A Testament to Security and Reliability\n\nThe Certik audit of Retik Finance underscores the platform\u2019s commitment to security and reliability. This audit provides an additional layer of trust and confidence for investors, ensuring that Retik Finance\u2019s smart contracts are robust and secure against potential vulnerabilities.\n\n2024: The Year of Retik Finance\n\nChat GPT\u2019s analysis suggests that 2024 could very well be the year of Retik Finance. With its innovative features and growing ecosystem, RETIK is projected to experience substantial growth, potentially outperforming both Solana and Ethereum.\n\nRobust Features and Market Appeal: Retik Finance\u2019s array of features, particularly its DeFi debit cards, are set to transform how people interact with cryptocurrencies. These cards will facilitate the widespread adoption of crypto in everyday transactions, a significant leap towards mainstream acceptance.\n\nAI-Powered Lending \u2013 A Game-Changer: The platform\u2019s introduction of AI-powered P2P lending is a significant innovation in the DeFi space. This feature is expected to attract a broad user base, offering a more accessible and efficient lending and borrowing mechanism.\n\nMarket Confidence and Adoption: Retik Finance\u2019s presence on prominent platforms like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, coupled with its Certik audit, is building market confidence. These factors contribute to a growing investor base eagerly anticipating the platform\u2019s full launch.\n\nBold Price Predictions for Retik Finance\n\nLooking at Retik Finance\u2019s trajectory and market potential, Chat GPT predicts a remarkable performance in 2024. The platform is expected to provide substantial returns for early investors, with a price prediction indicating a surge of over 900% from its current value. This growth is not just based on market speculation but also on the tangible utility and innovation Retik Finance brings to the DeFi landscape.\n\nConclusion: A Transformative Year Ahead\n\nAs 2024 unfolds, the cryptocurrency market is set for a transformative journey. While Solana and Ethereum are predicted to see significant growth, Retik Finance is poised to make a more substantial impact. With its innovative solutions, Certik audit, and listings on key crypto platforms, Retik Finance is not just another token in the crowded crypto space; it\u2019s a harbinger of change in DeFi.

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nIn the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, 2024 is shaping up to be a pivotal year, particularly for two digital currencies: Ethereum (ETH) and the rising star, Pandoshi (PAMBO). This article zooms in on these two cryptocurrencies, each poised for significant growth. Ethereum, a veteran, continues to innovate and evolve, attracting investors with its upcoming developments. On the other hand, Pandoshi is rapidly carving out its niche, with its unique features and strategic roadmap suggesting a surge in value and adoption. We'll dissect the factors that put these two tokens in the spotlight and why they are widely anticipated to experience a substantial pump in 2024.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum, often referred to as the \"world computer,\" has been a cornerstone in the realm of cryptocurrencies since it first emerged. Pioneering the use of smart contracts, Ethereum has been instrumental in the evolution of the decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized application (DApp) sectors. In 2024, Ethereum's ongoing prominence is attributed to several crucial factors. The introduction of Ethereum 2.0 marks a significant advancement, addressing scalability issues by shifting to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nThis major update is designed to increase transaction speed and decrease energy usage, positioning Ethereum as a more efficient and sustainable blockchain platform. Additionally, the vibrant ecosystem of Ethereum continues to be a central element of its success. The platform supports an array of decentralized applications, ranging from decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and lending platforms to markets for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Ethereum's adaptability and widespread adoption make it a trusted and formidable option for both developers and users.\n\nPandoshi (PAMBO)\n\nA new cryptocurrency recently introduced to the market is garnering attention as a viable option for substantial short-term gains. With its untapped potential for growth and limited supply, this asset often witnesses sharp price increases soon after launch, appealing to investors looking for opportunities below $1.\n\nPandoshi, at first glance, might seem like just another meme coin, but in reality, it is an entirely independent and decentralized entity. The project's whitepaper reflects a deep understanding of professionalism and technical detail, emphasizing values such as decentralization, the protection of financial privacy, and community engagement.\n\nThe Pandoshi ecosystem operates on a Layer-2 network using a Proof of Stake protocol, a more environmentally friendly choice compared to traditional Proof of Work systems. Its ecosystem encompasses a decentralized exchange (DEX), the secure, user-controlled Pandoshi Wallet, interactive Metaverse gaming experiences, educational initiatives, and cryptocurrency-friendly prepaid cards, all functioning seamlessly without KYC requirements. The native utility token of this ecosystem, PAMBO, was originally launched on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Pandoshi Presale\n\nPAMBO adopts a deflationary model, utilizing a buy-and-burn strategy where tokens are bought at market prices and then permanently removed from circulation, enhancing their scarcity.\n\nKey aspects of the project, such as its decentralized exchange that imposes fees on transactions, significantly contribute to the token's value growth. These fees are used to buy and retire PAMBO tokens, diminishing the total supply and supporting the token's price.\n\nRecently, Pandoshi has attracted a surge of investors who were previously engaged with Doge and Shiba Inu. Disappointed by the lack of growth and speculative nature of their earlier investments, they are now gravitating towards Pandoshi, drawn by the prospect of a 400% return and recovering their investments.\n\nThis growing interest and investor engagement indicate the project's momentum. With substantial investors joining, the third phase is poised to be fully subscribed soon, progressing to the next stage. This moment offers an ideal chance for early investment in a credible utility project with significant potential and a capacity for delivering results.\n\nIn a market teeming with competition, Pandoshi sets itself apart by prioritizing practical and user-focused blockchain solutions. This distinctive approach positions it as a potential game-changer in the cryptocurrency arena, making it an appealing choice for today's investors. For those in search of a promising and accessible cryptocurrency option, Pandoshi offers a solid opportunity, backed by a committed community and clear strategic objectives. PAMBO coins are available for direct purchase on the project's official website.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Pandoshi Presale\n\nVisit the links below for more information about Pandoshi (PAMBO):\n\nWebsite: https://pandoshi.com/\n\nWhitepaper: https://docs.pandoshi.com/\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Fri 19 Jan 2024 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Fitah\n\nThe SEC is playing for time, pushing back its pivotal decision on the proposed Fidelity spot Ethereum ETF to March 5. In a strategic move, the regulator extends the suspense, stating that a longer examination period is necessary to assess this significant initiative. However, an analyst predicts a final verdict by the end of May.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF: A Deadline Extended to March 5\n\nIn November 2023, Fidelity submitted an application for the Fidelity Ethereum Fund, a spot Ethereum ETF. In a document released this Thursday, January 18, the SEC postponed the deadline for making a decision. Believing it is \u201cappropriate to designate a longer period,\u201d the deadline is extended to March 5. This period is required to take action on the proposed rule change, the SEC declared. The Commission now has more time to decide on approval, denial, or to initiate proceedings.\n\nThe approval of 11 Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC last week leads to speculation whether the Ethereum ETF will be next. Indeed, Fidelity joined BlackRock late last year in the race for a spot Ethereum ETF. The launch of Ether futures ETFs occurred one month prior to their application. Stuart Barton, cofounder of Volatility Shares, believes that the SEC views Ether in the same light as Bitcoin.\n\nThe SEC Should Make a Decision By the End of May\n\nJames Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, stated on Twitter that this delay was very much expected. He added that the dates that really matter are at the end of May. This deadline could be related to the fact that the SEC must approve or reject a proposal from a competing company.\n\nFidelity #ethereum ETF delayed just now. Completely expected. Dates that really matter are late May in my view. https://t.co/8mvhcPRaS7 \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 18, 2024\n\nIndeed, by May 23, the Commission must have made its decision on the ETF Ethereum request from VanEck. The SEC, having already initiated proceedings regarding this request, can no longer delay its decision. Moreover, it is known that the regulator often approves similar ETFs together. It will probably make a statement on pending Ethereum ETFs at the end of May.\n\nMeanwhile, the price of Ethereum is stabilizing around $2478, approaching a critical support zone at $2400. Despite a slight decrease over the past eight days, Ethereum still registers a 9% increase since the beginning of the year.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!
