        "title": "Where Will Ethereum Be in 5 Years? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The latest crypto winter is thawing out as we speak. From crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) driving institutional investor interest to planned technology upgrades to many of the leading crypto platforms, investors have found many new reasons to pay close attention to this space again.\n\nAs a result, smart-contract leader Ethereum (ETH 0.76%) has enjoyed a 46% price jump from the most recent market trough in October 2023. Archrivals Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA) and Algorand (CRYPTO: ALGO) nearly tripled over the same time span -- and up-and-comer Avalanche (CRYPTO: AVAX) more than tripled.\n\nDoes Ethereum have the right moves to counter these high-stakes gambits from its competitors on the grand chessboard of public opinion and developer interest? Let's see how the next three years might play out for the world's second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nHow Ethereum echoes Bitcoin's market melody\n\nFirst, let me point out that Ethereum tends to follow the price trends of sector giant Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) in the long run -- sometimes amplified and sometimes muted in comparison to its larger cousin, but almost always moving in the same direction. In other words, the two charts are strongly correlated.\n\nSo when Bitcoin gears up for halving the rewards handed out to its miners, as it does roughly once every four years, that event is expected to drive both cryptocurrencies higher over the following year or so. That trend played out in 2016 and 2020 although Ethereum lagged behind Bitcoin's big gains in the former cycle. So the Bitcoin halving, scheduled for late April 2024, should pour fresh fuel on the fires of most cryptocurrencies -- Ethereum included.\n\nThe journey ahead: Ethereum's planned upgrades\n\nThe halving event should provide a rising tide to lift all encrypted boats, but how will Ethereum tackle the soaring competition? Would investors be better off in speed-focused rivals like Avalanche, Cardano, and Algorand in the long run?\n\nWell, let's see. Ethereum is in the middle of a multiyear platform upgrade, formerly known as Ethereum 2.0 or Eth2. The switch to a proof-of-stake system is already in the books, to be followed by several stepwise technical boosts over the next five to 10 years. The precise order of these updates will vary depending on many external factors, but the process should look something like this, according to the official Ethereum development roadmap:\n\nSharding will split the workload of validating transactions into smaller, more manageable batches. This speed-boosting upgrade is running ahead of schedule, as one early step turned out to be more helpful than expected.\n\nInstead of waiting 15 minutes for validation, the same processing batch could address both the creation and validation of the same transaction. This may be the next step, and a significant upgrade to Ethereum's transaction speed.\n\nSeveral security updates are in the works, aiming to protect the blockchain from different attack types. For example, hardening the blockchain against quantum computing attacks is currently seen as a low priority, but could move up the chain if quantum hardware makes a sudden performance leap. Stay tuned.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum executes every smart contract by referring to externally owned accounts (EOAs). This architecture helps developers pull in real-world data from so-called oracle networks such as Chainlink (CRYPTO: LINK) , resulting in sophisticated contracts tied to stock prices, currency exchange trends, weather patterns, the moon phase, and so on. But it also adds complexity to the smart-contract system, slowing it down and exposing the platform to more bugs. Therefore, the Ethereum community is exploring different ways to replace this approach with a simpler and faster alternative.\n\n, resulting in sophisticated contracts tied to stock prices, currency exchange trends, weather patterns, the moon phase, and so on. But it also adds complexity to the smart-contract system, slowing it down and exposing the platform to more bugs. Therefore, the Ethereum community is exploring different ways to replace this approach with a simpler and faster alternative. Finally, mastermind Vitalik Buterin wants Ethereum to be a stateless system in the long run. This next-level spin on sharding would allow each processing node to manage just a small slice of the blockchain's total data, lowering the costs of participation while increasing processing speeds dramatically. However, this is a true long-term goal requiring dramatic changes to Ethereum's technical platform, and you shouldn't expect it anytime soon.\n\nSo Ethereum is taking steps to match the ultra-fast transaction processing speed of Avalanche and Cardano while also building a more robust and flexible platform for blockchain-based app development. Only time will tell how closely the Ethereum project will stick to its stated long-term plans, but there have been more positive surprises than unexpected snags so far.\n\nEthereum looks ready to rumble\n\nIn my view, the ball is in the court of so-called \"Ethereum killers.\" The leading smart-contract platform looks ready to meet their challenges over the next few years.\n\nOf course, the upstarts aren't sitting on their digital hands. Cardano, Algorand, and Avalanche are also boosting their already fast processing speeds while aiming for greater stability. Any one of them might come up with a game-changing innovation someday.\n\nThe challengers are fighting an uphill battle, though. Ethereum got a head start on the rest of the field, setting industry standards and gathering developer interest several years before the other names even existed. The sheer inertia of an established developer group's existing preferences makes it hard for other platforms to steal Ethereum's smart-contract throne.\n\nBut the presence of several healthy rivals should also drive Ethereum to greater heights in the long run. I can't wait to see how this Gulliver-vs.-Lilliput battle will play out over the years. All four of these cryptocurrencies may have bright futures, but Ethereum has the clearest path to sustained success. The giant isn't even on its knees yet."

        "title": "What Is Ethereum Restaking? A Beginner's Guide - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Ethereum restaking, as proposed by the Ethereum-based middleware protocol EigenLayer, involves reusing staked ETH tokens to secure other protocols. Proponents of restaking believe it can be used to amplify trust across networks, while detractors are worried about its possible ramifications.\n\nRead on to learn what Ethereum restaking is, how it works, and the pros and cons of restaking ETH tokens.\n\nWhat Is Ethereum Restaking?\n\nBefore we can delve into restaking, we need to understand staking digital assets in PoS networks.\n\nStaking refers to network participants locking up a certain amount of cryptocurrency on-chain to secure the network in exchange for staking rewards.\n\nOn Ethereum, it means locking up 32 ETH into a validator, which acts as an economic incentive for validators to act honestly when verifying transactions. In this process, a validator commits to producing Ethereum blocks and maintains the integrity of the Ethereum network. The economic incentive for validators is earning ETH rewards.\n\nHowever, if they attempt to manipulate the network or act dishonestly, they are penalized and stand to lose their staked ETH in an act called slashing.\n\nEthereum restaking refers to simultaneously using your staked ETH to secure other protocols and earn rewards. In other words, you are depositing your already staked ether tokens in another protocol to extend the same trust generated by Ethereum\u2019s validators to the new protocol.\n\nDuring this process, your ETH will remain staked on Ethereum, and validators will continue confirming transactions, but your staking power will now expand to other protocols. Restakers will earn additional rewards for their ETH stake but will be penalized or \u201cslashed\u201d for failing to perform their staking duties.\n\nHow Does Ethereum Restaking Work?\n\nEigenLayer\n\ndeploys smart contracts on Ethereum so ETH stakers can restake their assets on external protocols. EigenLayer acts as the conduit through which you can restake your staked ETH tokens, as well as a decentralized trust marketplace for stakers looking to compound their yields.\n\nEigenLayer provides two ways to restake: native restaking or LSD restaking.\n\nNative restaking allows you to restake your ETH stake directly to EigenLayer by assigning your validator\u2019s withdrawal credentials to EigenLayer\u2019s smart contracts (EigenPod).\n\nLSD restaking is you restaking your liquid-staked tokens. You can stake ETH on liquid-staking platforms such as Lido and Rocket Pool. Liquid staking is less complicated and has a lower barrier of entry than running your Ethereum validator. You can then restake your liquid-staked tokens.\n\nEigenLayer\n\nallows you to stake Lido ETH (stETH), Rocket Pool ETH (rETH), Coinbase Staked Ether (cbETH), and more liquid staked assets.\n\nHow to Restake Ethereum\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a look at how you can restake your ETH.\n\nSet up a Web3 wallet: Get a Web3 wallet to allow you to interact with DeFi protocols and dApps. If you have already staked ETH on liquid staking platforms, you can deposit it directly into the wallet. Connect your wallet to the EigenLayer App: Navigate to app.eigenlayer.xyz and connect your wallet to the protocol. The page will display the assets supported on EigenLayer and the TVL of each locked in the smart contracts. Select a restaking option: Choose the method of restaking that works for you. If you are a validator running your node, then native restaking is optimum. Alternatively, you can select your preferred liquid staking token and input the desired amount. Confirm your transaction: Confirm your deposit on EigenLayer and in-wallet to ensure the transaction is complete.\n\nBenefits and Drawbacks of Restaking Ethereum\n\nHere, we explore several benefits and drawbacks of restaking Ethereum for validators, protocols, and developers.\n\nPros\n\nAdditional rewards: The most obvious advantage of Ethereum restaking for a validator is the ability to compound staking rewards by staking ETH on other protocols.\n\nReducing the start-up cost of new protocols: By restaking Ethereum\u2019s pool of assets, new protocols can benefit economically from Ethereum\u2019s security offerings without starting their validation services.\n\nProtocols can retain sovereignty: By building on EigenLayer, protocols will have the flexibility to customize their architecture without adhering to the rigid rules imposed on Ethereum Layer 2 chains.\n\nCons\n\nSlashing: When you stake ETH, you are exposed to slashing as an economic consequence of bad behavior. Staking amplifies the risk, and you could lose staked ETH if you engage in malicious activity on a secondary protocol.\n\nRisk to Ethereum performance: Restaking opponents fear that with Ethereum\u2019s computational power being redirected to secondary networks, there could be a computational overload on Ethereum\u2019s consensus.\n\nCentralization risks: Restaking protocols like EigenLayer may attract ETH stakers with the promise of high yields, resulting in the rise of centralized networks and a decline in individual ETH stakers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile still in its early stages, Ethereum restaking is an interesting approach to network security and validation and how users can actively contribute to both.\n\nEthereum restaking may set the precedent on how blockchain protocols incorporate the power of collective participation and pooled economic incentives to shape the future of decentralized finance."

        "content": "Investment bank TD Cowen has provided a clearer timeline for when it thinks a spot Ethereum ETH +0.92% exchange-traded fund will be approved in the United States \u2014 late 2025 or early 2026. Earlier this month, the bank said the approval could come after the November 2024 election.\n\n\"We do not expect the SEC in 2024 to approve a spot Ethereum ETF,\" TD Cowen Washington Research Group, led by Jaret Seiberg, wrote in a note on Monday. \"This is a political call. We believe there is no upside for SEC Chair Gary Gensler to approve a spot Ethereum ETF given how upset progressive Democrats were over the agency's approval of a spot bitcoin ETF earlier this month.\"\n\nGensler needs the support of progressives to push forward his agenda in this election year, according to TD Cowen. Also, if Gensler pursues a different role, such as Treasury secretary, in the event of President Joe Biden winning a second term, he will still need the backing of progressives, the bank said.\n\nSo, \"there is no reason to provoke a needless fight,\" TD Cowen said. \"We say needless, as our view remains that Gensler is in no hurry to approve an Ethereum ETF as he would first like more experience with the performance of the recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs. This is consistent with his broader approach to crypto, which is to move incrementally and slowly when it comes to providing regulatory approvals or clarity.\"\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF applications\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nMore than half a dozen companies, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have applied for a spot Ethereum ETF. Last week, the SEC again postponed its decision on Grayscale Investments' proposal for a spot Ethereum ETF, following delays on other applications earlier this month.\n\nThe SEC can take its time reviewing spot Ethereum ETF applications, according to TD Cowen. \"It can eventually reject the rule change, which either will lead to a new application or litigation. Either will take another year or two to play out,\" the bank said.\n\nThe expected late 2025 or early 2026 approval deadline is possible even if Congress fails to enact broader crypto market structure legislation in 2025, TD Cowen said. Gensler's term ends in June 2026.\n\nCrypto experts have been both optimistic and pessimistic that a spot ether ETF approval is on the horizon. Some think such an approval could come as early as May \u2014 the initial deadline for approving such funds."

A recent report from Electric Capital found that 71% of smart contract code was initially deployed on Ethereum.\n\nAlthough Ethereum is the birthplace for the majority of blockchain code, developers also frequently opt to deploy their projects on alternative blockchains that boast higher speeds and reduced transaction fees.\n\nBlockchains like Solana or Cardano have had a hard time attracting Ethereum developers because they use software that is incompatible with Ethereum\u2019s. Solana uses its own custom-made solution, while Cardano uses a UTXO model.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThis has created an opportunity for Sei and similar projects looking to court Ethereum devs.\n\nNeon EVM, an Ethereum-compatible layer 2 blockchain built on top of Solana, and Monad, a yet-to-be-launched blockchain, also offer Ethereum developers routes to deploy their code on a more performant blockchain without having to make alterations to it.\n\n\u2018The EVM is here to stay\u2019\n\nCurrently, blockchains fall into one of two broad categories: those that are compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine \u2014 or EVM for short \u2014 and those that are not.\n\nEVM-compatible blockchains make it easy for Ethereum developers to build on them, but many of those chains are prone to transaction congestion and high fees.\n\nWhile some EVM-compatible blockchains find a way around this using technologies like zero-knowledge proofs, such blockchains are still relatively new.\n\nOn the other hand, blockchains that use different software, like Sei and Solana, can achieve much higher transaction speeds.\n\nSei\u2019s answer to this situation is to upgrade its current architecture to make it fully compatible with Ethereum \u2014 a request that\u2019s at the top of developers\u2019 wishlist, Jog said.\n\n\u201cThe EVM is here to stay,\u201d Jog said. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily the cleanest and most elegant execution environment to be using, but it is the one that has already gotten most market share.\u201d\n\nSei currently requires developers to write their protocols using programming languages like Rust or C++. But after the Sei v2 upgrade, they will be able to use languages like Solidity and Vyper that are popular with Ethereum developers.\n\nEVM parallelisation\n\nSei already achieves high transaction speeds compared to other blockchains. To maintain these high speeds while also letting developers use the EVM, Sei is implementing a technique called EVM Parallelisation.\n\nThis allows Sei to run multiple execution environments that can simultaneously process transactions instead of having to process transactions one after the other, as most blockchains do.\n\nSei is not the only blockchain leveraging EVM Parallelisation.\n\nNeon EVM also uses EVM Parallelisation to let Ethereum developers tap into Solana.\n\nInvestors deposits ($) in Neon, as measured by total value locked on DefiLlama\n\nBut unlike Sei v2, where both EVM and non-EVM protocols will live on the same blockchain, Neon EVM is its own separate blockchain.\n\nThat means users must first bridge their assets to Neon EVM, introducing a point of friction, which hasn\u2019t prevented Neon from making inroads with Ethereum developers.\n\nStiff competition\n\nAave, the biggest lending protocol on Ethereum with over $7 billion worth of investor deposits, recently polled its token holders on whether it should deploy its v3 version to Neon EVM. The vote ended with over 83% of token holders signalling support.\n\nMonad, a soon-to-be-launched blockchain, is also promising developers EVM compatibility and fast transactions.\n\nBoasting a proprietary consensus algorithm, Monad claims it will achieve processing capabilities of up to 10,000 transactions per second upon its launch later this year.\n\nAlthough Neon EVM has a head start, the competition between these three EVM Parallelisation projects is only just beginning.\n\nSEI token price ($)\n\nSuccess isn\u2019t guaranteed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018if you build it, they will come,\u2019\u201d Jog said. \u201cBecause there\u2019s been dozens of other chains where no one has gone.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Sei Labs\u2019 focus on parallelisation, the Sei Foundation, an affiliated nonprofit that supports the Sei ecosystem, plans to launch a grants programme for those looking to develop on the Sei blockchain."

        "content": "On Jan. 24, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) pushed back its decision on BlackRock\u2019s proposed spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund application (ETF) a day before the deadline, citing the need for more time to review the proposed rule change. While the SEC must make a final decision on BlackRock\u2019s spot Ether (ETH) ETF decision by Aug. 7, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has predicted a final decision will be made on all pending spot Ether ETFs in May \u2014 similar to the way the SEC decided on 10 pending spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs in January.\n\nThe next day, the SEC also delayed its decision on whether to approve a spot Ether ETF from Grayscale Investments, opening the application to public comments. The SEC said it would institute proceedings to determine whether to approve or disapprove a proposed rule change allowing NYSE Arca to list and trade Grayscale Ethereum Trust shares. Opening the proposed investment vehicle to public comment will push the deadline for a decision by an additional 35 days upon publication in the Federal Register.\n\nThe SEC remains one of the most consistently anti-crypto forces in the United States. According to a report from litigation consulting firm Cornerstone Research, the number of crypto-related enforcement cases brought by the SEC in 2023 was the highest since 2013, suggesting that digital assets were a \u201ctop priority\u201d for the commission. Of the 46 enforcement actions in 2023, Cornerstone reported the SEC imposed $281 million in monetary penalties for settlements and tripled the number of administrative proceedings from 2022.\n\nFINRA believes that 70% of crypto asset public communications violate the law\n\nIn other news, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) reported that roughly 70% of crypto-related communications from a survey contained \u201cfalse, exaggerated, promissory, unwarranted or misleading\u201d claims or otherwise violated guidelines on public communications. FINRA reviewed over 500 crypto asset-related retail communications starting in November 2022. According to the regulator, it identified more than 70% of the reviewed communications that had \u201cpotential substantive violations\u201d of its rules on communications with the public.\n\nAccording to the regulator, crypto-related communications could range from a podcast to an ad spot in the Super Bowl. Violations potentially included misleading claims on crypto and misrepresenting how the protections of federal securities laws apply to digital assets. FINRA added that the targeted exam provided crypto firms with questions to consider in their public communications.\n\nContinue reading\n\nFlorida and Alaska revoke Binance.US\u2019s right to operate in their territories\n\nTroubled cryptocurrency exchange Binance.US continues to face pressure from regulators in the U.S. after the former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao\u2019s guilty plea. Regulators in Florida and Alaska have told Binance.US that the crypto exchange can no longer serve its residents. The Alaska Division of Banking and Securities reportedly denied renewing Binance.US\u2019s license in January 2024. Florida\u2019s Office of Financial Regulation has also issued an emergency suspension order against Binance.US\u2019s money transmitter license. The suspension reportedly came a week after Binance\u2019s founder and former CEO Zhao, also known as CZ, pleaded guilty to violating U.S. Anti-Money Laundering rules on Nov. 21, 2023. In late December, regulators in Arkansas, Illinois and South Dakota reportedly reached an agreement with Binance.US that would allow it to keep operating in those states. As part of that, Binance.US must make the transfer of Zhao\u2019s voting rights irreversible.\n\nContinue reading\n\nCrypto lender Abra settles with Texan regulators\n\nCrypto lending firm Abra \u2014 allegedly insolvent since March 2023 \u2014 has entered a settlement in principle with the Texas State Securities Board (TSSB). The company will return assets invested by the state\u2019s citizens. According to the document, Abra \u201cbegan winding down U.S. retail operations\u201d and will notify clients with more than $10 in their balances so they can withdraw their assets in seven days. The unclaimed assets will be converted to fiat currency and directed to remaining Texas investors.\n\nAccording to the settlement text, by the time the TSSB filed actions, Abra held $13.6 million of crypto on behalf of more than 12,000 investors in the United States. Only $1.8 million of them were owned by approximately 1,600 Texas residents. The company\u2019s X account has been silent since June 2023. Bill Barhydt confirmed the settlement, emphasizing that Abra \u201chas never (ever) frozen withdrawals for US users\u201d and \u201cvoluntarily wound down\u201d the Earn and Boost programs in 2023.\n\nContinue reading"

Moreover, the ETC price struggles to break out of its key resistance level, suggesting a bear power in the crypto space.\n\nThe ETC price traded in a closed range between $20.32 and $21.94 for a while, following which the market gained momentum and the Ethereum Classic price gained just enough momentum to break out of the resistance level.\n\nTradingView: ETC/USDT\n\nHowever, the rally was short-lived as the price faced rejection at $23.45, after which it traded sideways for a while.

        "title": "Key Levels to Watch As Ethereum Price Sparks New Recovery at $2200 - CoinGape",
        "content": "The Ethereum (ETH) price has recently experienced an uptick in demand, particularly noticeable around the $2200 level. This change is highlighted by distinct long-tail rejection candles observed on its daily chart, indicating a decrease in bearish momentum. This shift comes in tandem with the Bitcoin price stabilization above $40000, alongside a broader uptick in altcoin markets, sparking a new relief rally.\n\nOver the past three days, the Ethereum price has seen a nearly 4% increase, now trading around the $2280 mark. Given this renewed buying pressure, can Ethereum leverage this momentum to surpass the $2500 threshold once again?\n\nadvertisement\n\nBear Trap Reboots Recovery Sentiment in ETH\n\nThe Ethereum Fear and Greed Index at 48% reflects a neutral sentiment among traders.\n\nThe $2200 support backed by several technical levels creates a stoned support region.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $6.3 Billion, indicating a 10.3% gain.\n\nOver the recent fortnight, the Ethereum price experienced a pronounced correction, with its value plunging from $2714 to a low of $2168, marking a significant 20% decrease. During this pullback, the coin price broke below the channel pattern\u2019s support trendline, which underpinned a recovery rally for nearly three months.\n\nHowever, as the broader market\u2019s bearish momentum began to fade, the ETH price demonstrated resilience around the $2200 mark, successfully reclaiming the previously breached support trendline. This reversal marked the prior downfall as a \u2018Bear Trap,\u2019 and triggered additional buying orders in the market, evidenced by considerable short liquidation.\n\nCurrently trading at $2280, if Ethereum can maintain its position above this reclaimed support, it could initiate a 6.85% relief rally, aiming for the $2430 level. This immediate resistance aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent correction, highlighting a pivotal barrier that sellers are likely to defend vigorously.\n\nTherefore, for Ether to continue its upward trajectory and potentially retest the $2700 mark, a breakout above this critical resistance level is essential to gain further momentum.\n\nHas Ethereum Price Entered Downtrend Momentum?\n\nExamining Ethereum\u2019s daily time frame chart, it\u2019s evident that corrections are a regular occurrence. In November 2023, the cryptocurrency underwent a 38.2% correction, followed by a 23.6% retracement in December 2023. Such trends suggest that these retracements, particularly around the 38.2% Fibonacci level, are typical for Ether, often serving as a precursor to subsequent upward movements.\n\nExponential Moving Average (EMA): Amid the recent downturn, the 100-day EMA slope at $2200 showcased its sustainability as valid pullback support.\n\nRelative Strength Index (RSI): The daily RSI slope below 45% reflects the market sentiment currently bearish.\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "title": "What Is Ronin? The Ethereum Gaming Chain Behind 'Axie Infinity' and 'Pixels' - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIn the wide world of crypto, there are now many blockchains specifically designed for gaming\u2014but Ronin was among the first to launch.\n\nGaming blockchains are typically built to offer low transaction fees and a higher number of potential transactions, so they\u2019re supposed to be more affordable and more scalable than blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Some gaming chains are also private, meaning that developers must gain approval from a blockchain\u2019s creators in order to join its ecosystem.\n\nRonin is one of those examples\u2014at least for now, though founders have said they intend to open it up sometime in 2024 for more studios to build on. In the meantime, games like Pixels and Axie Infinity are drawing players to the Ethereum sidechain. Here's what you need to know about it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat is Ronin?\n\nRonin is a gaming-centric Ethereum sidechain designed to handle transactions at a much faster and cheaper rate than Ethereum's own mainnet. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible chain originally launched back in February 2021.\n\nIt originally launched a \u201cproof of authority\u201d blockchain (PoA), meaning individuals Ronin deems reputable run validator nodes, a type of computer software, to confirm transactions on its blockchain. One common criticism of the PoA method, however, is that a lot of trust must be placed in a smaller number of validators\u2014so it\u2019s less decentralized than other methods.\n\nIn March 2022, the Ronin\u2019s bridge experienced a massive $622 million hack. The bridge connects Ronin to Ethereum. The U.S. Treasury blamed North Korean hackers for the attack\u2014and some of the lost funds were eventually recovered. Affected users were fully refunded by the Ronin network and developer Sky Mavis in June 2022.\n\nIn April 2023, the Ronin blockchain switched to the delegated proof-of-stake mechanism (DPoS), meaning that it no longer operates as a PoA blockchain. DPoS allows for more decentralization, as now any Ronin (RON) token holder with at least 250,000 RON staked on its blockchain can \u201cdelegate\u201d or select validators for the network.\n\nWhat is RON?\n\nThe Ronin token, also known as RON, is the gas token for the Ronin blockchain. Ronin network users need a bit of RON to pay for transactions on the blockchain. RON can also be staked to participate in the blockchain\u2019s aforementioned DPoS mechanism, or can be staked for other decentralized finance (DeFi) purposes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat is the Ronin Wallet?\n\nSky Mavis\u2019 Ronin Wallet is a crypto wallet for the Ronin blockchain ecosystem that exists as both a web browser extension and a mobile app for iOS and Android devices.\n\nIn early 2024, the mobile wallet\u2019s developers announced new features in an effort to expand its capabilities, adding support for other blockchains like Ethereum sidechain Polygon and the EVM-compatible BNB Chain. It\u2019s also added Binance Pay as a feature, which allows users to buy some of the Ronin ecosystem's tokens.\n\nWhat is Sky Mavis?\n\nSky Mavis is a crypto tech startup founded in 2018 that created both the Ronin blockchain and its flagship game, Axie Infinity. Sky Mavis has five co-founders: Trung Nguyen, Aleksander Larsen, Jeffrey Zirlin, Viet Anh Ho Sy, and Tu Doan.\n\nAccording to Tracxn data, Sky Mavis has 26 institutional investors, with Animoca Brands and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) among them. Sky Mavis has raised $311 million in funding at time of writing, per Tracxn, with its latest round a Series B that raised $150 million in April 2022. That round was raised to help refund Ronin users after the aforementioned hack.\n\nHow does Axie Infinity fit into Ronin?\n\nAxie Infinity is a Pok\u00e9mon-inspired play-to-earn game where players can fight each other in battles where they must pit axolotl-inspired creatures called \u201cAxies\u201d against each other. Every Axie is an NFT that can be bought and sold. Thanks to a recent update, some Axies can now be upgraded, too.\n\nWhich tokens are on Ronin?\n\nThe Ronin blockchain\u2019s best-known tokens so far are RON, AXS, and SLP. AXS is Axie Infinity\u2019s governance token. SLP, also known as Smooth Love Potion, is Axie Infinity\u2019s main in-game currency and play-to-earn reward token.\n\nIn early 2024, Sky Mavis announced that SLP would be getting a rework including a capped token supply and a \u201cstability fund\u201d that will automatically buy SLP at specified times in an effort to keep the token\u2019s price within certain target points. SLP can be earned in Axie Infinity by winning matches.\n\nPixels is also set to launch its own PIXEL token soon on Ronin, while other games are likely to debut tokens in the future as they expand and hold airdrop campaigns.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhich games are on Ronin?\n\nWhile Ronin\u2019s most well-known game is Axie Infinity (which consists of Origins, Raylights, and Homeland games), there\u2019s also games like Axie Classic, Project T prototype, and Defenders of Lunacian Land.\n\nBeyond the Axie IP, Sky Mavis has begun to bring external game developers onto the Ronin blockchain, adding Pixels, Zoids Wild Arena, The Machines Arena, Tribesters: Island of Solas, and Civitas, to name a few.\n\nPixels has been credited with helping to renew interest around the Ronin chain after migrating from Polygon in late 2023 and kicking off a play-to-airdrop campaign that concluded in January 2024. The game has driven a dramatic rise in active users on Ronin, arguably benefitting other games on the platform and driving refreshed enthusiasm around its prospects.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated after publication to note additional Sky Mavis co-founders and to clarify that Ronin users affected by the bridge hack were fully refunded."

        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Below $2,500? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After tanking 68% in 2022, Ethereum (ETH 0.76%) experienced a resurgence last year, as the digital asset soared 91% in 2023. This was on the back of renewed optimism in the crypto industry.\n\nHowever, Ethereum remains 49% off its all-time high. And the current dip might be a rare opportunity.\n\nShould investors buy this leading cryptocurrency while it's still below $2,500? Let's look at both the bull and bear cases for Ethereum, so that investors can make an informed decision.\n\nWhat the bulls are saying\n\nEthereum was the first cryptocurrency that incorporated functionality for smart contracts. And this means that it had greater potential to introduce various use cases.\n\nThis includes decentralized applications, in verticals including gaming, social, governance, and even art. But one area that has huge potential is decentralized finance (DeFi). According to coinmarketcap.com, Ethereum has 71% of the $105 billion of total value locked in the entire cryptocurrency industry. This metric measures how much capital is staked or locked up in DeFi applications, indicating Ethereum's dominance.\n\nIn September 2022, Ethereum's network transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Supporters had long waited for this upgrade, called The Merge, to make the cryptocurrency better capable of scaling up. This also reduced its energy usage by 99.95%. Furthermore, the hope is that Ethereum can process more transactions at lower costs. And this should continue to make this blockchain network a hotbed when it comes to developer activity.\n\nAnother reason why Ethereum might be on your investing radar has to do with the potential for spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to hit the market. The Securities and Exchange Commission approved Bitcoin spot ETFs recently, and there's optimism this could happen with Ethereum as well. So far, BlackRock and Ark Invest, among other asset managers, have filed applications. This could bring in massive amounts of institutional capital to Ethereum, which could support a higher price over time.\n\nThe bears have compelling arguments\n\nThe entire premise of cryptocurrencies is to take power away from central authorities and give it to the community. The goal is to create decentralized networks where individuals are in control. The issue with Ethereum, though, is that it's still controlled by a small group of people. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, has an outsize influence on the direction of the crypto. Some might view this as a huge risk because he can take actions that are more favorable to himself.\n\nBesides The Merge, Ethereum's leaders have a comprehensive roadmap that includes numerous other upgrades to the network, called the Surge, Verge, Purge, and Splurge. While this is encouraging, because it shows how well thought out Ethereum's development pipeline is, it adds tremendous technical risk. Anytime software is changed, a lot can go wrong, thus opening up Ethereum to software bugs that could make it easier for hackers to attack the network and steal people's private keys.\n\nInvestors also can't ignore regulatory concerns. SEC chair Gary Gensler has come out and said before that he views Bitcoin as a commodity, while all other cryptocurrencies are likely securities. This means Ethereum could face a more stringent regulatory framework going forward, which could discourage capital and talent from migrating to it.\n\nShould you buy Ethereum? It depends.\n\n\n\nBoth the bull and bear cases hold a lot of weight. Investors should consider the facts and come to their own conclusion about what to do with this cryptocurrency as it relates to their portfolio composition. Everyone has a different perspective.\n\nIf you're willing to take the risk, accept the uncertainty, and understand that there will be lots of volatility, then initiating a tiny position in Ethereum while it's still below $2,500 might make sense. Of course, it's critical to maintain a long-term mindset of at least five to 10 years if you go this route."

        "content": "Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen says that he\u2019s expecting Ethereum (ETH) to correct sharply to below the $1,000 level.\n\nIn a new strategy session, Cowen tells his 790,000 YouTube subscribers that historically, ETH often \u201ctests the integrity\u201d of its major cycle lows at least twice before moving into a new bull phase.\n\nThe analyst points out the retests of cycle lows in 2015, 2016 and 2020 and says that another low in 2022 has yet to be retested.\n\nCowen forecasts that Ethereum first breaks down in its Bitcoin pair (ETH/BTC) before ETH/USD follows suit, likely this year.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m suggesting is that sometime in the next few months, ETH/BTC breaks down. After ETH/BTC breaks down, ETH/USD breaks down.\n\nOne of the things about ETH/USD that you might notice is that it doesn\u2019t tend to just put in a low and then never test the integrity of that low. Look at all the prior examples\u2026\n\nSo at some point, I think Ethereum will test the integrity of that low, back down below $1,000. But, history would also suggest that it won\u2019t test it until after ETH/BTC breaks down. And history also suggests that ETH/BTC probably won\u2019t break down in January because normally January is a good month for Ethereum.\n\nIt could still take some time given these narratives that are floating around, given the spot ETF for ETH, given the halving narratives, it could take some time for that to play out.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,268.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Mustafa has been writing about Blockchain and crypto since many years. He has previous trading experience and has been working in the Fintech industry since 2017.\n\nStory Highlights Analyst Benjamin Cowen predicts a potential value drop below $1,000 based on historical patterns and the ETH/BTC pair.\n\nBitcoin's performance significantly impacts Ethereum.\n\nPotential approval of Ethereum ETFs in March could boost its price, but the wait-and-see approach remains.\n\nWell, this could come as bad news for many! Benjamin Cowen, a respected analyst, has raised a red flag regarding Ethereum\u2019s future compared to Bitcoin. Widely recognized for his precise predictions, Cowen recently shared crucial insights on YouTube, pointing towards a potential downturn in Ethereum\u2019s value.\n\nAt present, Ethereum is cautiously navigating around $2,297, reflecting a modest 0.33% dip in the last 24 hours.\n\nBut what\u2019s coming next? Read on to find out.\n\nCowen\u2019s Bearish Analysis\n\nIn a recent video, Benjamin Cowen, known for his accurate crypto predictions shared his thoughts about Ethereum (ETH), he believes that Ethereum\u2019s value might drop a lot, possibly below $1,000 before entering into a bullish period.\n\nCowen looks at how Ethereum has behaved in the past and sees a historical pattern where it usually goes down, then a bit up, and then down again. This makes him think that Ethereum might still have to go down again before things get better.\n\nKey Indicator to Focus On\n\nCowen emphasizes the importance of the ETH/BTC pair, warning that a breakdown could lead to a significant drop in Ethereum\u2019s USD value. Historical data supports this correlation.\n\nThat\u2019s why Cowen predicts that Ethereum might go back to low values below $1,000, especially if the ETH/BTC pair breaks down.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Market Analysis: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Price Prediction For This Week\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin\u2019s Impact\n\nHighlighting the symbiotic relationship between Ethereum and Bitcoin, Cowen predicts that a surge in Ethereum\u2019s value hinges on a preceding uptick in Bitcoin. The gravitational pull of Bitcoin\u2019s market dynamics significantly shapes Ethereum\u2019s journey.\n\nAcknowledging the inherent unpredictability of predictions, Cowen factors in variables such as the Ethereum spot ETF and Bitcoin halving narratives. He emphasizes the intricate nature of market dynamics, recognizing their role in shaping Ethereum\u2019s future.\n\nCould An ETF Help?\n\nWhile Cowen urges caution, optimism surrounds the prospect of Ethereum\u2019s price surge if the SEC greenlights spot Ethereum ETFs. BlackRock\u2019s extension and other major players, including VanEck, ARK 21Shares, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, Grayscale, and Hashdex, submitting ETF proposals, with decisions looming by March 10 and deadlines ranging from May to July, add layers of anticipation.\n\nRead More: Approval for Ethereum ETFs Coming Soon? Key Challenges You Should Know\n\nAs Ethereum stands at a crossroads, Cowen\u2019s insights raise crucial questions about its future trajectory. Will Ethereum weather the storm, or will regulatory decisions reshape its path? We\u2019re all waiting and watching."

He has been studying cryptocurrencies and their market behavior for several years and deeply understands the factors that affect the price of cryptocurrencies. His expertise lies in his ability to use both technical and fundamental analysis to make informed predictions about the future direction of cryptocurrency prices. He has a strong understanding of market sentiment and uses this to inform his trading decisions and price predictions.\n\nAnalyst Crypto World has opened up about the current state of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The analyst discussed the key technical indicators and potential scenarios for each cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price bounces between $37,900 and $38,500 from a crucial support level. The analyst pointed out a bearish divergence still present on the daily chart, as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has not yet broken above a descending resistance line. However, the possibility of a bullish reversal is hinted at by the potential formation of a bullish cross in the daily MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence).\n\nWhile the bearish divergence is technically active, the analyst expressed neutrality in the short term. In the immediate short term, the 2-hour Bitcoin chart displayed a breakout above resistance levels between $41,700 and $42,200. The analyst expected support in this range and warned that a confirmed break below $41,700 could lead to a potential downturn toward $39,500.\n\nEthereum\n\nThe analyst observed that Ethereum Price is still under a bearish divergence on the daily chart. Despite this, the daily MACD indicated a reduction in bearish momentum, suggesting a more neutral outlook in the short term.\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, the analyst identified a potential short-term bullish scenario, comparing the current price structure to a historical fractal. The possibility of a slight bullish relief or sideways consolidation was mentioned, with a watchful eye on potential outflows from Grayscale influencing the market.\n\nSolana\n\nThe Solana price analysis focused on the 8-hour timeframe, where the price encountered resistance around $98 to $99. The analyst pointed out potential resistance levels at $102.50 and $108 to $109. A breakout above $99 and a rejection at $102 to $103 could lead to an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern, indicating a bullish trend reversal. Support levels were identified at $91 to $92 and $83.50 to $85.50."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite Ethereum's position as a frontrunner in the altcoin sector, its growth has been stunted by a bearish trend that has held a tight grip on the market in recent weeks. A closer look at the ETH chart reveals that the expected volatility spike that could catalyze a bullish reversal has yet to materialize.\n\nLayer-2 network adoption and ecosystem expansion\n\nFirst, the surge of layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism could be a catalyst for Ethereum's growth. These networks aim to enhance Ethereum's ecosystem by providing the much-needed scalability and reduced fees, potentially driving renewed interest and increased adoption of the Ethereum network.\n\nETH/USD Chart by TradingView\n\nScalability and network efficiency\n\nSecond, Ethereum's persistent scalability issues must be addressed. Despite the implementation of EIP-1559, which was anticipated to make transaction fees more predictable, the network still struggles under high demand, leading to exorbitant fees and reduced network functionality. Resolving these scalability woes is crucial, as a more efficient and cost-effective network is vital for Ethereum to retain its value and utility.\n\nIntroduction of Ethereum ETF\n\nFinally, the establishment of an Ethereum ETF would be a strong bullish signal, mirroring the impact of the Bitcoin ETF. An Ethereum ETF would pave the way for institutional investment, providing a regulated and accessible means for traditional investors to gain exposure to ETH. This could secure Ethereum's future as a mainstream financial asset and provide a stable foundation for long-term growth.\n\nLooking at the Ethereum chart, we identify a local resistance level at approximately $2433.5, a price point that has acted as a hurdle in recent trading sessions. For a bullish case to solidify, Ethereum needs to break past this resistance with conviction. Should this occur, it could signal a shift in investor sentiment and open the path to higher price levels."

Ethereum is well ahead in terms of seven-day volume, however, at $8.9 billion compared to less than $4.5 billion for Solana.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven so, the recent short-lived reversals show that the long-dominant Ethereum is facing increasing pressure from Solana, as the rival chain offers much cheaper and faster transactions. That was the case in December when trading on Solana meme coins like BONK and Dogwifhat (WIF) helped spike DEX volume.\n\nNow, the culprit appears to be the impending launch of JUP, the official token of the popular Solana decentralized exchange aggregator Jupiter. It\u2019s set to debut on Wednesday with nearly a million wallets eligible to claim a share of JUP tokens.\n\nAccording to data from CoinGecko, Solana trading volume on Jupiter topped that of leading Ethereum DEX Uniswap V3 late Sunday, though much like with the broader chains, those places have already swapped as of Monday morning.\n\nUniswap V3 has over $629 million worth of trading volume over the past 24 hours, while Jupiter has about $571 million in DEX trading on Solana during that span.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether any recent trading will actually factor into Jupiter airdrop eligibility, however, as the protocol took a snapshot of early users on November 2. It said that some 955,000 wallets would be eligible for the eventual drop, which is now set to take place on Wednesday. However, Jupiter has additional tokens planned for future airdrops.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJupiter\u2019s launchpad was used for last week\u2019s WEN meme coin drop as a test run ahead of the JUP drop.

That\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t some semblance of DeFi activity on the network, but the blockchain\u2019s main focus is to provide services to financial institutions globally.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum offers a far more diverse range of utilities. While early activity on the network was centered around decentralized finance, Ethereum developers have spread their wings to provide blockchain-based applications in everything from supply chain management and healthcare to legal services and gaming.\n\nScalability\n\nThe XRP Ledger was designed to eclipse Bitcoin\u2019s limitations and provide an unrivaled payment system. With blazing-fast transaction speeds, high transaction throughput, and low fees, the XPRL can support vast amounts of users without breaking a sweat or breaking the bank.\n\nIn this respect, Ethereum falls short. The network has long suffered from astronomical gas fees, with a simple trade, digital currency transfer, or NFT mint costing upwards of $50. Ethereum is also much slower than Ripple, managing only around 15 transactions per second\n\nHowever, all is not lost for Ethereum. The network supports dozens of layer 2 scaling solutions that help shoulder some of the burden, providing Ethereum\u2019s unmatched developer experience on far more scalable platforms.\n\nOn top of that, Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum community are constantly working to improve the network. Plans are underway to alleviate Ethereum\u2019s issues and help it compete with more modern and performant Layer Ones.\n\nVision\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Ripple\u2019s primary focus is on delivering solutions for some of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions. While most cryptocurrency industry aims to give power and control back to the individual, Ripple is more interested in sticking with the big players.\n\nBeyond that, Ripple faces some centralization issues. While claiming to be fully decentralized, the XRP Ledger is largely operated by Ripple Labs, a private company.\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t enough, Ripple Labs holds over 50B XRP tokens in its escrow vaults.\n\nI'm still not sure the escrow was such a good idea. I initially oposed it. Later weakly supported it. And today, I'm right on the fence. \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 8, 2024\n\nThis staggering figure makes up more than half of XRP\u2019s total supply, a concept that even Ripple CTO David Schwartz has difficulty supporting.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s development and future are firmly held in the hands of its community. On-chain votes manage the protocol\u2019s governance, and anyone can submit new proposals that might dictate the blockchain\u2019s path forward.\n\nLike Bitcoin itself, Ethereum champions the original ethos of blockchain technology. The network aims to give everyone on earth greater control of their assets and provide a secure, anonymous, and permissionless platform for all.\n\nLooking to the Future\n\nHaving shaken the legal monkey off its back, Ripple can finally look ahead unburdened. At the same time, Ethereum\u2019s network effect is growing larger daily, supported by a comprehensive roadmap expected to resolve its issues. What does the future hold for these iconic cryptocurrencies?\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for Ripple?\n\nWhile Ripple Labs\u2019 legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission is far from over, Judge Analisa Torres\u2019 declaration that XRP is not a security has been a great boon for the XRP community.\n\nWith that out of the way, Ripple Labs can focus more on expanding the RippleNet work towards more partnerships with large financial institutions.\n\nRumors have been circulating about a potential Ripple IPO. However, Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse has denied these claims, suggesting that Ripple is \u2018not in any hurry\u2019 to go public.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for Ethereum?\n\nFollowing a successful transition to becoming a more energy-efficient, Proof-of-Stake blockchain in 2022, the next steps of Ethereum\u2019s roadmap are dedicated to scaling the network.\n\nCo-founder Vitalik Buterin has updated the Ethereum roadmap, painting a picture of what to expect in 2024 (ignoring the typo in his post). The plan ahead follows the 6-step path to newfound scalability, separated into comically named sections.\n\nBy popular demand, an updated roadmap diagram for 2023! pic.twitter.com/oxo58A2KuG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 30, 2023\n\nWhile it is unlikely that all this will be achieved in 2024 alone, the Ethereum community is largely happy with the proposal, which aims to bring Ethereum to greater heights.\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nComparisons between crypto projects are not always a great measure of their value. The reality is that it\u2019s hard to compare the perks and potential of two fundamentally different protocols with contrasting values and use cases.\n\nOn paper, Ripple is a far more efficient and scalable payment processor. However, Ethereum\u2019s adaptability and scope are far wider, allowing for a more diverse range of utilities and adoption channels.\n\nUltimately, the question shouldn\u2019t be as simple as \u2018Which is better?\u2019. The question is which blockchain is better suited to your individual needs.\n\nRipple is undoubtedly the better option if you want to transfer funds quickly at a low cost. For everything else, Ethereum offers a much more diverse range of tools and services that Ripple and the XRP Ledger cannot match.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nModern blockchains offer the best of both worlds. Newer, more performant blockchains like Solana can have faster transaction speeds and lower gas fees than the XRP Ledger while maintaining Ethereum-equivalent levels of smart contract composability.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nRipple and Ethereum are two of the most important digital assets in the crypto market. It\u2019s essential to understand what both networks are capable of before making any investment decisions.\n\nFAQs"

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Prediction as BTC Surpasses $42,000 Resistance and ETH Turns Red - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Prediction as BTC Surpasses $42,000 Resistance and ETH Turns Red\n\nIn the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to be the key players with their recent price movements catching the attention of investors. Bitcoin, the trailblazer of the crypto market, has recently rebounded, breaking through the $42,000 resistance level and registering a current price of $42,292. This nearly 0.50% increase in the last 24 hours coincides with the overall crypto market valuation at $1.63 trillion, despite a slight 0.15% drop.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s surge is linked to favorable stock market trends and the significant achievement of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETFs amassing over $2 billion in Assets Under Management. This bullish trend in Bitcoin\u2019s price is a focal point for price prediction analyses.\n\nOn the other side, Ethereum, the second most notable cryptocurrency, has seen a minor setback, trading at $2,269 with nearly 0.50% decline. However, the buzz around the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF, as suggested by analyst James Seyffart, signals an optimistic future for Ethereum. The approval, expected in May, could attract more investment, influencing Ethereum\u2019s price positively.\n\nMoreover, the global interest in cryptocurrencies is evident with developments like Harvest Hong Kong\u2019s application for a Bitcoin ETF and a Binance survey revealing growing crypto acceptance in Europe. These factors collectively contribute to the evolving narrative of Bitcoin and Ethereum price predictions.\n\nHarvest Hong Kong\u2019s ETF Bid: A Global Boost for Bitcoin\u2019s Value\n\n\n\nHarvest Hong Kong, a prominent Chinese fund company, has officially submitted an application for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission.\n\nThe approval of this ETF, which is poised for launch after the Lunar New Year holiday on February 10, would mark Hong Kong\u2019s first Bitcoin spot ETF. This initiative follows the successful introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, igniting worldwide interest.\n\nRachel Aguirre of BlackRock has acknowledged the impressive performance of the U.S. ETF, which has surpassed expectations. China\u2019s entry into this sector adds a significant dimension to the dynamic landscape of digital asset investments, signaling a transformation in investor preferences.\n\nThus, Harvest Hong Kong\u2019s application for a Bitcoin ETF reflects increasing global interest. Its potential approval could further elevate Bitcoin\u2019s price by attracting additional investors and reinforcing its legitimacy in mainstream financial markets.\n\nBinance Report: Rising Crypto Acceptance in Europe and Bitcoin\u2019s Prospects\n\n\n\nBinance\u2019s latest survey reveals an increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in Europe, driven by their potential for high returns, decentralization, and continuous innovation. The study indicates that 73% of Europeans hold a positive view of digital currencies, with 55% utilizing them for regular transactions. This trend aligns with the global increase in cryptocurrency ownership, which soared from 432 million in January to 580 million by December 2023.\n\nSome really positive findings from our #Binance survey across Europe. 73% of respondents were optimistic about the future of crypto & with MiCA implemented soon, there\u2019s a lot to be excited about in the region! More details from @Finbold here \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/gE3l6e5MtT \u2014 Rachel Conlan (@RachelConlan) January 25, 2024\n\nDespite a temporary decline in adoption following the FTX exchange issues in late 2022, confidence rebounded, partly due to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) approval of 11 Bitcoin ETFs. High-profile sponsorships, including Crypto.com\u2019s collaboration with the LA Lakers and OKX\u2019s partnership with Manchester City, further enhanced trust in the sector.\n\nAs a result, the optimistic sentiment in Europe, highlighted by Binance\u2019s survey, may positively impact Bitcoin\u2019s price. The growing adoption, coupled with heightened optimism and usage, could attract more investors, potentially elevating the cryptocurrency\u2019s market value.\n\nSeyffart\u2019s Forecast: Ethereum ETF Approval in May Could Elevate ETH Value\n\n\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart sees a 60% chance of a spot Ethereum ETF getting approved in May. Despite recent delays for BlackRock and Grayscale proposals, Seyffart marks May 23 as a crucial date, expecting the SEC\u2019s decision around that time. The SEC, having approved Bitcoin ETFs, is now considering proposals from BlackRock, Grayscale, Ark 21Shares, and VanEck.\n\nThe Road Ahead: A View on ETH Spot This is intended to be a deep dive into the current landscape for crypto spot ETFs generally with emphasis on ETH. Will do this in 4 parts for ease of reference. 1 \u2013 General Roadmap\n\n2 \u2013 Threshold Issue\n\n3 \u2013 BTC Spot Approval\n\n4 \u2013 ETH Analysis\n\n\ud83e\uddf5 \u2014 Scott Johnsson (@SGJohnsson) January 25, 2024\n\nSeyffart is hopeful but acknowledges the SEC\u2019s ability to delay decisions. Grayscale aims for a summer 2024 SEC decision on turning its Ethereum Trust into an ETF. As May approaches, Seyffart keeps an eye on filings, with May 23 as a key date for potential updates. Consequently, the prospect of a spot Ethereum ETF approval, highlighted by James Seyffart, could positively impact ETH price.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nAs of January 29, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC/USD) technical analysis on the 4-hour chart underscores critical price points crucial for its short-term movement. The pivot point is set at $42,161, confronting immediate resistance at $43,394. Additional resistance levels are observed at $44,372 and $45,581. In contrast, the support levels are at $40,957, $39,644, and $38,618. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reads at 70, reflecting robust buying interest that is nearing overbought territory. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is located at $40,820, providing a key support line. A significant pattern on the chart is Bitcoin\u2019s ascend past a double top near the $42,160 region. A sustained closure above this level could be indicative of a strong upward trend. Thus, Bitcoin\u2019s trend remains bullish as long as it stays above the $42,160 threshold. Ethereum Price Prediction As of January 29, Ethereum (ETH/USD) continues to hover around the $2,250 mark, demonstrating a phase of consolidation. The 4-hour chart sheds light on essential levels that are shaping Ethereum\u2019s immediate market behavior. Its pivot point is identified at $2,321, facing immediate resistance at $2,388. Further resistance levels are located at $2,476 and $2,560. Conversely, Ethereum finds its initial support level at $2,241, followed by $2,169 and $2,102. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 54, suggesting a balanced market condition. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) stands at $2,314, reflecting a close alignment with Ethereum\u2019s current price movement. Technical analysis indicates that Ethereum has achieved a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $2,313. However, a descending trendline near the $2,300 level could act as an obstacle to any potential upward progression. In summary, Ethereum\u2019s trend appears bullish above the $2,320 level. Short-term expectations include testing the resistance at $2,388, offering essential insights for traders and investors monitoring Ethereum\u2019s market trends."

        "content": "Jupiter, a Solana-based liquidity aggregator and decentralized exchange (DEX), has witnessed a significant increase in trading volumes, as the platform prepares for the issuance of its native token, JUP.\n\nThe increase in volume suggests that traders are positioning themselves to benefit from the Jan. 31 JUP airdrop. An airdrop is a method commonly used in the cryptocurrency space to distribute tokens to users, often to encourage adoption and usage of a new platform or currency.\n\nThe Solana ecosystem competes with other blockchains like Ethereum for dominance in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nSolana\u2019s total value locked (TVL), or the amount of crypto assets deposited in DeFi platforms, stood at US$1.40 billion at the time of writing, making it the fifth-largest DeFi chain in the world, according to DeFiLlama data. Ethereum hosts the world\u2019s largest DeFi ecosystem with US$31.4 billion in TVL.\n\nTrading activity on Jupiter has been comparable to that seen on established platforms like Ethereum-based Uniswap, currently ranked as the world\u2019s largest DEX with US$4.1 billion in TVL.\n\nSolana is also the world\u2019s second-most active blockchain for NFTs, with US$4.8 billion in all-time sales behind Ethereum\u2019s US$42.4 billion.\n\nIn December, Solana\u2019s US$365.48 million barely edged Ethereum\u2019s NFT sales volume of US$363.45 million.\n\nSolana\u2019s native token SOL is the world\u2019s fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization with US$43.8 billion.

However, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has provided little clarity on the prospects of such an approval.\n\nDecrypting the SEC Chair\u2019s Vague Ethereum ETF Remarks\n\nDuring an interview with CNBC, Gensler refrained from offering substantial encouragement when questioned about the likelihood of a spot Ethereum ETF gaining SEC approval in the near future.\n\nWhile discussing the recent developments, Gensler emphasized the SEC\u2019s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, drawing a comparison to previously approved commodity-based exchange-traded products.\n\nGensler declined to provide further insights into the status of an Ethereum ETF specifically.

        "content": "Ethereum, the cornerstone of decentralized finance and the second-largest coin by market cap, is currently trading above $2,250. To reach our Ethereum price prediction of $10,000, the price of ETH would need a 5x increase. Is this feasible in 2024? Let\u2019s analyze \ud83d\ude09\n\nIs Ethereum a Good Investment in 2024?\n\nIn 2024, Ethereum remains a strong investment option. Its position as a leader in the DeFi space and its consistent performance, despite market fluctuations, make it a viable choice for long-term investors. The potential for growth, as indicated by various chart analyses, suggests a promising future for Ethereum.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Merge was NOT Enough\n\nInterestingly, the price of ETH dropped post-Merge, an event that was technically significant but had a limited immediate impact on price. This underscores the importance of understanding market psychology and the difference between short-term trading and long-term investing in Ethereum.\n\nIs Ethereum a Good Buy?\n\nEthereum is considered a good buy, especially for those looking at long-term investments. Its robust fundamentals, coupled with a growing ecosystem, make it a standout in the crypto market. Investors should, however, be aware of market dynamics and invest wisely.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Will ETH Reach $10,000 in 2024?\n\nOur Ethereum price prediction analysis, based on charting techniques, suggests that while ETH reaching $10,000 in 2024 might be ambitious, it\u2019s not out of the realm of possibility. The key price point to watch in 2024 is $3,300, as surpassing this level could signal the start of an accelerated uptrend towards our target.\n\nEthereum price history chart in USD \u2013 coinmarketcap\n\nHowever, the $10,000 looks like a far target as this means a 5x from current prices.. Since Ethereum is strongly correlated to Bitcoin, this means that Bitcoin would reach around $200,000, which is a target beyond 2024.\n\nWhere to Buy Ethereum in 2024?\n\nEthereum can be purchased on various exchanges, with Bitget being a notable option. Bitget offers a user-friendly platform with robust security measures, making it an excellent choice for buying and trading Ethereum. Additionally, Bitget fees are one of the lowest in the market, so you won\u2019t have to worry about high fees if you trade regularly.\n\n\u2013> CLICK HERE TO BUY ETH <\u2013\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

Analysts expect more growth once it launches later in Q1 2024.\n\nWhales buy more Shiba Inu\n\nOnchain data shows that whales are stacking up more Shiba Inu (SHIB) and ETH.\n\nAccording to Etherscan, an anonymous whale purchased over 606 billion SHIB, bringing their total SHIB holdings to over 1 trillion coins.\n\nSo far, Shibarium, a layer-2 solution, has processed over 300 million transactions, with an average of 1.2 million to 7.8 million transactions per day.\n\nThis uptick might support prices.\n\nClosing thoughts\n\nFalling prices spurred whales to buy more ETH and SHIB. At the same time, the increasing demand for PLX shows Pullix\u2019s potential.\n\nRead more: Pullix rises as Cardano and Chainlink add to altcoin dominance\n\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

        "title": "Crypto Cartoon Explains New Bitcoin Rival on Ethereum-Blockchain \u2014 Mollars Token - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "This post is sponsored and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nA new crypto cartoon was just released on YouTube. The 2 minute and 54 second, animated short film explains the importance of a new Bitcoin rival on the Ethereum-Blockchain; A cryptocurrency called Mollars token. It\u2019s an innovative look into the digital asset and the way investors can earn money, in the form of ROI yields, by investing in its initial coin offering today.\n\nThe animated video has received 600 views since its launch on the official Mollars YouTube channel Saturday night. The view count is likely to go much higher as the week progresses and the viral-worthy content is spread about.\n\nWhat does the cartoon short film say about Mollars?\n\n\n\nThe cartoon summarizes many of the biggest key points of the Mollars Project.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is a store-of-value token like Bitcoin It\u2019s\u2019 on the Ethereum blockchain Mollars will offer traders the perks of Bitcoin but with lower transaction fees Buying during the ICO stage, before the token is listed on a public crypto exchange, can generate positive ROI yields for early investors How ICO funds are used aka \u2018tokenomics\u2019\n\n\n\nAfter these key points, the Mollars animation delves deep into how crypto traders make money from token presales. The film breaks down how one token that costs $0.45 cents today will be worth $0.62 cents, as soon as it goes live on a public cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nBeyond initial ROI gains ,the crypto animation also explains how long-term profits are much better on tokens. When the demand is high and a token is offering a solution, as Mollars is, the animation urges users to HODL and wait for much bigger gains that usually parallels how well a brand\u2019s value is built.\n\nHow Token Supply Will Be Sold\n\nThe Total Token Supply [TTS] distribution is also broken down in the cartoon. According to the artsy visual, Mollars TTS will be 10-million tokens. Only 4-million will be sold at discounted prices in the current initial coin offering. Once the ICO is closed, the other 6-million will be sold on a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange [DEX] like Uniswap.\n\nLast, beginning at the 2 minutes and 34 seconds mark, the animated characters elaborate on how investors can acquire the new Bitcoin-alternative. Users can visit the official website, Mollars.cc, and make a purchase by using Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT) or a credit card charge.\n\nThe \u201cMollars Cartoon\u201d is a great tool for educating novice investors. It could also attract more money from crypto whales and sharks, who dominate the list of the top 5 single transaction buyers from the $MOLLARS token presale.\n\nBeyond the visual itself, this video continues to show the great leadership and innovative ideas flowing from the creator of this store-of-value token. The launch of this short film was without notice and if there are other surprises to come from Mollars of similar quality, it could further catalyze growth for the initial coin offering, branding value, and demand."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has been dropping over the last couple of weeks following a decisive rejection from a significant resistance level. Yet, there are several support levels nearby.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily chart, the price has been forming a large ascending channel over the last year. It has recently tested the higher boundary of the channel, which coincided with the $2,750 resistance level and failed to break above. The resulting rejection has been gruesome, and the market has even fallen below the $2,400 support zone.\n\nWith the Relative Strength Index showing values below 50%, the price seems likely to decline toward the 200-day moving average, located around the $2,000 level.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nThe 4-hour timeframe does not have much insight to offer. The market is currently consolidating between the $2,100 and $2,400 levels. In case of a breakout to the upside, the higher boundary of the large channel would be the probable target.\n\nOn the other hand, a breakdown of the $2,100 level would likely result in a drop toward $2,000 and even below. Judging by the signs witnessed on the daily chart, further downside seems more probable.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum Taker Buy Sell Ratio\n\nWith Ethereum\u2019s price failing to climb above the $2,500 level, investors might be curious about how the futures market traders are behaving.\n\nThis chart presents the 100-day moving average of the Taker Buy Sell Ratio. This metric measures the ratio of aggressiveness of buyers compared to sellers. Values above one indicate buyers\u2019 dominance, while values below one are associated with aggressive selling pressure.\n\nAs the chart demonstrates, the metric has not recovered above one and has been dropping aggressively over the last few weeks. The ratio approaches values previously seen during the all-time high range in late 2021. This is not a positive sign by any means, and the trend might be about to shift bearish if things remain the same."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is continuing to evolve.\n\nIncredibly enough, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is now 15 years old; the original digital currency kicked off back in 2009. And as the industry matures, change inevitably comes for the industry.\n\nThe big cryptocurrency investment strategy for this year is the rise of institutional capital. With the advent of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), large financial firms can now safely deploy capital into Bitcoin with the click of a button. ETFs also allow individual investors to readily access the Bitcoin market from their tax-sheltered retirement accounts. This change opens up a new frontier for digital assets.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrypto to Buy: Bitcoin (BTC-USD)\n\nUp trend Technical graph of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) in futuristic concept, BITI ETF is a Bitcoin short fund for investors betting against Bitcoin.\n\nSource: Sittipong Phokawattana / Shutterstock.com\n\nEarlier this month, the SEC dramatically changed the cryptocurrency game. On January 11th, the SEC approved the trading of 11 different ETFs devoted to Bitcoin. Those included funds such as iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ:IBIT) and Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (NYSE:BTCO), which have attracted substantial amounts of investor capital since launching a few weeks ago.\n\nUp until January 2024, investors had much more limited access to Bitcoin on American stock exchanges. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (NYSEARCA:GBTC) was operating as a trust but could only trade on the Pink Sheets. Previously, the SEC blocked Grayscale\u2019s petition to convert itself into an ETF.\n\nNow, though, Grayscale has been able to become an ETF, and that fund conversion has ushered in the approval of all other sorts of digital asset ETFs as well. With Bitcoin being the oldest and most well-known crypto, it stands to gain the lion\u2019s share of new capital flowing into the industry.\n\nCrypto to Buy: Ethereum (ETH-USD)\n\nCrypto currency etherium. ethereum coin on exchange charts. e-currency Ethereum. Ethereum price predictions\n\nSource: viktoryabov / Shutterstock.com\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD) should be the next cryptocurrency in line to benefit from this trend. The SEC is expected to rule on whether or not it will approve Ethereum ETFs later this spring. Some analysts are hopeful this could lead to a major rally in the price of ETH.\n\nStory continues\n\nBears might contend that cryptocurrency prices initially sold off in the wake of the Bitcoin ETF approvals, which is true. However, in that case, the Grayscale Bitcoin fund already had a large sum of capital in it, and once the ETFs were approved, a large chunk of money was transferred out of that GBTC product into other funds with lower expense ratios.\n\nWith that shift largely taken care of, future inflows into the Bitcoin ETFs should be a net positive for the ecosystem and support higher prices. In any case, there is not much money in Ethereum trusts; an Ethereum ETF would tap a more unclaimed market, potentially leading to significant upside later this year.\n\nCrypto to Sell: Floki Inu (FLOKI-USD)\n\nFloki Inu price predictions. An image of a corgi wearing a horned viking helmet above text saying Floki Inu on a black background.\n\nSource: Zie Project/ShutterStock.com\n\nThere is a flip side to the cryptocurrency investment strategy centered around capturing these institutional capital flows.\n\nThe arrival of all these big-name asset managers like BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) in the ETF space is that cryptocurrency is a more serious endeavor now. And in attracting this more professional class of investors, the overall digital asset landscape changes.\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen more speculative parts of the crypto landscape, like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), lose popularity. Meme coins are likely to be another loser during this shift.\n\nTake Floki Inu (FLOKI-USD) for example. The coin is one of the various meme tokens to emerge riding off the popularity of Dogecoin (DOGE-USD). However, given Floki Inu\u2019s high transaction tax, limited visibility and minimal utility, it seems Floki Inu will not have a promising future.\n\nIn the wild west days of crypto, meme coins with little more than social media support could enjoy significant popularity. With the rise of ETFs and institutional money in crypto, however, unproven oddities such as Floki Inu are likely to fall by the wayside as the smart money concentrates in the most promising tokens and projects.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Can $ETH Hit $4,000 by Q1 2024? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price prediction: Over the past two weeks, the smart contract giant Ethereum has witnessed aggressive correction in its native token ETH. The coin price plunged from a $2714 high to a recent low of $2171, registering a 20% loss. However, as the broader market witnessed renewed buying pressure, the Ethereum price managed to hold its ground above $2200. As the development of ETH ETF gains attention from market participants, the Ethereum price could find an opportunity to return on a recovery trend.\n\nDuring the last week, Ethereum\u2019s price fluctuated between $2,170 and $2,265, showcasing a tug-of-war between market bears and bulls. This pattern reflects a year of robust growth for Ethereum, with a notable 54% increase in value. This resilience is further underscored by a surge in trading volume, which reached a staggering $7.15 billion, reinforcing Ethereum\u2019s position as the second-largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $271 billion, according to Coinmarketcap.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Recent Trends and Bullish Signals\n\nEthereum reached its peak value of $2,717 on January 12. Since then, it has mostly hovered around the $2,200 mark, indicative of a sideways movement in its price trend. These oscillations within a defined range suggest a mix of market strength and uncertainty. Crypto analysts are leaning towards a bullish short-term forecast for Ethereum, fueling optimism about its future performance in the market.\n\nCrypto analyst Crypto Tony has been closely monitoring Ethereum\u2019s price movements. His analysis suggests a forthcoming surge in Ethereum\u2019s market value. He notes a prevailing positive trend that could catalyze a substantial rally. According to Tony, should Ethereum maintain its crucial $2,100 support level, it may be on track for considerable financial growth.\n\nEthereum price analysis reveals a significant trend in its daily chart, marked by an ascending channel formation. This pattern has been a key indicator for investors. However, Ethereum\u2019s recent downturn has led to a break below the channel\u2019s support line. Additionally, Ethereum struggled against the resistance posed by the EMA 21 during its last uptrend, hinting at a potential short-term bearish scenario for the cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Can ETH Sustain the Bullish Momentum?\n\nThe current support level at $2,200, reinforced by various technical indicators, forms a robust support zone. If Ethereum manages to sustain above this critical level, there\u2019s potential for a bullish surge. This upward movement could target the $2,400 mark. Beyond this, sustained bullish momentum could see ETH challenging higher resistance levels, potentially reaching $3,000 and possibly escalating to $4,000 by the end of February 2024.\n\nConversely, a drop below the pivotal $2,200 support level could trigger a downward trend for Ethereum. Such a decline could steer the price toward the lower support line near $2,120. If bearish forces continue to exert pressure, Ethereum might find its next support level around $2,000, potentially leading to a market correction.\n\nThe technical indicators for Ethereum are showing promising signs, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently positioned at 48. This figure, hovering just below the neutral 50 mark, suggests that buyers hold firm ground. The daily chart for Ethereum reflects a positive trend, particularly after it surpassed its 200-day moving average and moved out of a significant descending channel.\n\nMoreover, bullish signals are reinforced by the behavior of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). The MACD line\u2019s ascent above the signal line indicates growing bullish momentum, a sentiment echoed by the rising histogram. This bullishness is further bolstered by the upward movement of the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the crossing of the 50-day SMA over the 200-day SMA. Additionally, the Chaikin Money Flow indicator, currently at 0.01, resides in the positive zone, providing further evidence of a bullish market outlook for Ethereum.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "title": "Ethereum ETF Will Happen Very Fast -- Here Are The Coins to Buy Now - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThe approval of Bitcoin ($BTC) Spot ETFs has created a new precedent for digital assets having ETF products, and the Ethereum ($ETH) ETF will happen very fast. An Ethereum Futures ETF product already uses spot price as its base, making any argument against an approval nonsensical. BlackRock knows what it is doing, and an Ether Spot will be available later this year.\n\n\n\nNow is the right time to be bullish on Ethereum and Ethereum betas- these are the top cryptos to buy right now. Betas are smaller cap tokens whose performance is linked to a leading asset. Regarding Ethereum, here are the coins to buy now: $ETH, $ARB, $SNX, $OP, and $GFOX.\n\n\n\nGalaxy Fox ($GFOX) Ethereum Presale Beta\n\nGalaxy Fox is a hybrid meme/ P2E token and is an excellent play for anybody who is bullish on GameFi, memecoins, and Ethereum. Its unique positioning in dual narratives gives it tremendous upside potential, and the protocol itself has an excellent user acquisition model.\n\n\n\nIts Web3 runner game pays out prizes to skilled players, and anybody can compete. A new dimension is added with NFTs boosting in-game stats, and the ability to earn real money is a perfect incentive for new users to enter this ecosystem. Users stay for the staking rewards, and the protocol\u2019s token burn means they are earning yield on a deflationary asset.\n\n\n\nThis ICO launching in the Ethereum ecosystem while specualtive attention is focused here could easily produce a 100X run. $GFOX is a top crypto to buy now.\n\nEthereum ($ETH) Spot ETF Loading\n\nEthereum is the next narrative trade, and investors already have the playbook. Bitcoin was at $25,000 when Fink announced he had made an application for a Spot ETF. It rallied all the way to $48,000. Ethereum will do the exact same.\n\n\n\nBuying $ETH now has to be one of the most straightforward trades in the world. However, given $ETH\u2019s large market cap upside potential is certainly capped compared to the beta plays.\n\n\n\nArbitrum ($ARB) Leading Layer 2\n\n\n\nArbitrum ($ARB) is the leading layer two and is an easy beta play. $ARB\u2019s performance is heavily affected by $ETH\u2019s price, and if Ethereum rallies 5%, Arbitrum typically rallies 15%+.\n\n\n\nSet to benefit from the Dencun upgrade and the introduction of a new type of transaction known as a blob. Blobs will massively reduce the cost for rollup providers and end users. $ARB is one of the top 5 cryptos to invest in for anybody bullish long-term on Ethereum and the future of rollups.\n\n\n\nSynthetix ($SNX) Liquidity Provision King\n\n\n\nSynthetix ($SNX) is another of the top cryptos to buy right now, and this liquidity provision protocol is a crucial pick-and-shovel play. It is the backend for multiple protocols on Ethereum and Optimism, and a massive percentage of trading activity taking place on-chain feeds value back to $SNX stakers.\n\n\n\nOptimism ($OP) Rise of the OP Stack\n\n\n\nOptimism ($OP) is the second-largest rollup, and the propagation of the OP Stack, a modular framework for building rollups, promises to feed an incredible amount of value to $OP token holders.\n\n\n\nThey will control governance rights for all rollups constructed using the OP Stack, and the growing adoption of this tech standard increases Optimism\u2019s technological dominance. $OP is another top crypto to buy for anybody who is bullish on Ethereum and modular design.\n\n\n\nClosing Thoughts: Ethereum Uptrend Unlocks Huge Upside For Betas\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum Spot ETF will happen sooner than investors think, and beta plays are the top cryptos to buy now. As $ETH becomes dominant and starts to outperform Bitcoin, it gives these smaller caps riding on its coattails enormous upside potential.\n\n\n\nAs per raw ROI potential, Galaxy Fox is leaps and bounds beyond its competition, and $GFOX launching in the current conditions is a clear path to a 100X rally. Participate in the presale today!\n\nLearn more about $GFOX here:\n\nVisit Galaxy Fox Presale | Join the Community"

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Prediction as BTC Rallies 10% From Recent Bottom and ETH Sees $5 Billion Flood In \u2013 Time to Buy?\n\nIn the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin\u2019s price prediction seems bullish, especially as it experiences a noteworthy upswing, currently trading at $42,220, marking a nearly 1% increase on Sunday.\n\nThis positive trend in Bitcoin\u2019s valuation coincides with a high-ranking representative\u2019s praise of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF, hailing it as a \u201chuge success\u201d across various metrics.\n\nSimultaneously, the US dollar is witnessing a decline in the wake of recent inflation figures, setting a critical stage for the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting next week. These developments collectively paint a complex but intriguing picture for Bitcoin\u2019s future in the financial landscape.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF Declared \u2018Huge Success\u2019 by Top Official\n\n\n\nSince its recent inception, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has seen strong growth, and in an interview with Yahoo Finance, U.S. Head Rachel Aguirre expressed pleasure with the outcome. After receiving permission from the SEC, IBIT\u2019s trading volume increased to an astounding $3 billion in just two weeks, drawing in $1.6 billion in capital.\n\nAguirre highlighted BlackRock\u2019s dedication to giving investor\u2019s access to Bitcoin, praising the product for its three USPs: better accessibility, the removal of hassles related to direct Bitcoin ownership, and offering high-caliber support.\n\nBREAKING: The BlackRock iShares #Bitcoin Trust is a huge success by multiple metrics, according to Rachel Aguirre, U.S. Head of iShares Products. pic.twitter.com/ZOVZEgR3dC \u2014 sunnydecree (@sunnydecree) January 24, 2024\n\nAlthough Aguirre refuted rumors of a spot Ethereum ETF, she praised BlackRock for being ahead of the curve in gauging investor demand. BlackRock currently has 16,361 BTC in order to fund IBIT.\n\nThe favorable reaction highlights the increasing interest of institutions in cryptocurrencies, which is probably pushing up the price of Bitcoin.\n\nUS Dollar Weakens Post-Inflation Data, Ahead of Fed Meeting\n\n\n\nFriday saw a little decline in the value of the US dollar as December inflation statistics confirmed the market\u2019s expectations of a mid-year interest rate drop by the Federal Reserve. Though it might have gained for a fourth week in a row, the dollar index fell 0.1% to 103.41.\n\nIn line with expectations, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index increased by 0.2%, preventing annual inflation from rising above 3%. Analysts say there is no reason for the market to be concerned about inflation anytime soon, which lessens the chance of more tightening.\n\nUS dollar slips after inflation data, Fed meeting looms next week \u2013 The Economic Times https://t.co/o391aoNCWW \u2014 FOMC Alerts (@FOMCAlerts) January 28, 2024\n\nThe dollar\u2019s rise is being restrained by mounting disinflationary pressures globally, even though U.S. rate futures priced in a 47% chance of a rate decrease in March.\n\nThe situation with Bitcoin (BTC) is becoming better, and if investors continue to be concerned about inflation, they may become more interested in inflation-resistant assets like cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nOn January 28, Bitcoin (BTC/USD) exhibits a steady uptrend, currently trading at $42,401, marking a 0.66% increase. The four-hour chart highlights pivotal price levels that are key to Bitcoin\u2019s immediate trajectory. The pivot point is placed at $42,161, with the asset facing immediate resistance at $43,394, followed by higher resistance levels at $44,372 and $45,581. Conversely, support levels are established at $40,957, $39,644, and $38,618. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 70, indicating a strong buying interest that borders on overbought conditions. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) stands at $40,820, offering a significant support level. A notable chart pattern is Bitcoin\u2019s breakthrough above a double top around the $42,160 level. Closing above this could signal a robust buying trend, with potential for further upward movement. The overall trend for Bitcoin is bullish above the $42,160 mark. Ethereum Price Prediction On January 28, Ethereum exhibits a promising uptrend, trading at $2,289.7, a gain of 0.97%. The four-hour chart analysis highlights critical levels influencing Ethereum\u2019s short-term market dynamics. Its pivot point rests at $2,321, with immediate resistance observed at $2,388. Subsequent resistance levels are marked at $2,476 and $2,560. On the downside, Ethereum finds immediate support at $2,241, with further levels at $2,169 and $2,102. Read More: Ethereum Price The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 54, indicating a neutral market momentum. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is at $2,314, closely aligning with the current price trajectory. Chart analysis reveals that Ethereum has completed a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at $2,313. However, a downward trendline near the $2,300 mark may pose a hurdle for further upward movement. Overall, Ethereum presents a bullish trend above the $2,320 threshold. In the short term, it is expected to test the resistance levels, especially at $2,388, providing traders and investors with key indicators to watch in the coming days."

        "content": "Ethereum Classic (ETC) was born from a tragic event that happened at Ethereum (ETH). There was a hack on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain that led to a theft of 3.6 million Ethereum (ETH). Ethereum Classic (ETC) was set up to maintain Ethereum (ETH) reputation as an upstanding crypto project. Ethereum Classic (ETC) is a smart contract project that can host and support the creation of decentralized apps. Ethereum Classic (ETC) is trying to distinguish itself from its parent coin with its road maps moving further away from \u200bEthereum (ETH).\n\nCelestia (TIA) is a Web3 project that is redefining the way we look at blockchain architecture. Celestia (TIA) is a modular blockchain network, Celestia (TIA) is the first to allow anyone to launch their own blockchain with minimal resistance. Celestia (TIA) does not mandate any execution or settlement laws so developers now have more space to innovate than ever before.\n\nExperts have recommended that investors invest in Pushd (PUSHD) because it has great profit projections. Holders of Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Celestia (TIA) are very interested in this new project.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) has seen better days\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) might have many of the same functions that Ethereum (ETH) has but it seems it does not have the same financial success. Ethereum Classic (ETC) is losing investors and with these figures, who can blame them for leaving? Ethereum Classic (ETC) currently costs 23.27% but this equates to a 2.42% drop in value in the last 7 days. Even looking at a longer time frame, we see that Ethereum Classic (ETC) has had a bad year, with its value being in the red for most of the year. The coin has come up a little, but it is already descending.\n\nCelestia (TIA) loses more Investors in 2024\n\nCelestia (TIA) is a good project, but will Celestia (TIA) be a top project in 2024? According to experts, this is not likely. The worth of a Celestia (TIA) token is worrisome, in the last 7 days its value has dropped to $16.66 and this translates to a 2.4% drop in value. In addition to this, Celestia\u2019s (TIA) trading volume is affected, it has pumped by 50% in just 24 hours. Celestia (TIA) holders are now investing in Pushd (PUSHD), they see it as a more profitable investment in 2024.\n\nPushd (PUSHD) has the backing of top analysts\n\nPushd (PUSHD) is new to the crypto space but it is already making rounds in the scene. Top analysts have examined the project and have predicted that it will be a top project in 2024 and will be a blue chip company in no time. But what is this project all about? Pushd (PUSHD) is going to be the first decentralized online marketplace. Users will be able to buy and sell items with crypto. Pushd (PUSHD) will have a monopoly of this marketspace and so it is going to be very profitable. Pushd (PUSHD) is now in its fourth presale stage and is selling for $0.075 with almost 6,000 investors and over 23,000 sign ups.\n\nFind out more about the Pushd presale at their official website.\n\nDisclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

According to Tim Beiko, the update will first activate its features on the Sepolia and Holesky testnets, on January 30th and February 7th, respectively.\n\nThese highly anticipated activations on testnets pave the way for a successful deployment of Dencun on the mainnet, after a series of conclusive tests. It\u2019s worth noting that preliminary trials have already taken place on January 17th on Goerli.\n\nThe integration of Dencun into Sepolia and Holesky is critical before its official launch. It aims to validate its robustness and ensure a smooth transition to this new version of Ethereum.\n\nTim Beiko emphasizes: if the tests meet expectations, the launch date of Dencun will be announced on the mainnet. Furthermore, he urges operators to update their nodes for flawless deployment on D-Day.\n\nConcrete changes that crush fees\n\nDencun continues the revolutionary work started by Shapella in 2023, this time by integrating the much anticipated \u201cEIP-4844\u201d update, better known as \u201cProtodanksharding\u201d.\n\nThis fundamental advancement is expected to drastically reduce transaction fees for Ethereum-based layer 2 solutions. We\u2019re talking about a dramatic 90% drop for protocols like Optimism or Arbitrum!\n\nThe implications of Dencun are therefore huge in terms of accessibility and increased use of the Ethereum blockchain, thanks to this radical cost reduction. Its implementation will also undoubtedly stimulate the emergence of new layer 2 innovations.\n\nIn summary, this announcement generates immense interest from both investors and developers. The upcoming activation of Dencun will mark a decisive milestone for Ethereum, thus strengthening its dominant position in the blockchain market. Its rollout is already the talk of the crypto ecosystem!\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Ethereum has a bullish structure on the weekly chart.\n\nThe two key range resistance levels overhead line up well with the liquidation heatmap.\n\nEthereum [ETH] bulls took over a month to breach the resistance at the $2.4k mark. The Bitcoin [BTC] spot ETF approval news took Ethereum to the local high at $2.7k, but was rejected from there.\n\nThis price action presented the idea of a range within a range, which AMBCrypto explores here. In the meantime, the weekly market structure remained bullish, with the $2.1k level being the higher low.\n\nThe $2370 resistance could rebuff ETH bulls\n\nThe one-week chart showed that the $2.5k to $2.7k zone was a resistance from May 2022. It had been a support zone in March 2022 but was later breached. In the past two weeks, it served as a supply zone.\n\nThe range (purple) for Ethereum extended from $2.1k to $2.6k, with the mid-range mark at $2370.\n\nThe lows of the range saw candlewicks on the daily chart venture below $2.2k, but these were quick to bounce upward. The past few days saw another such reaction.\n\nUntil the push above $2.4k, the mid-range could be considered a range by itself. The price action since then has shown that expanding the range highs made sense.\n\nTherefore, the $2.4k and $2.6k levels are likely to oppose ETH gains.\n\nThe RSI was below neutral 50 to reflect bearish momentum, but this could change. On the other hand, the OBV fell to the December highs.\n\nThe OBV appeared to move within a range, just like the price. This meant that the buyers and sellers had been equally strong over the past month.\n\nThe liquidation heatmap could give more clues\n\nThe one-day price action suggested that a bounce to $2.4k was likely. It also underlined that the $2150-$2200 region was a firm demand zone.\n\nData from Hyblock agreed with both these inferences that AMBCrypto drew from the price action chart.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThe $2420-$2450 area was estimated to have close to $3 billion worth of liquidation levels.\n\nFurther north, the $2620-$2660 and $2750-$2800 regions were estimated to have $3.8 billion and $5 billion worth of liquidation levels respectively. This meant swing traders could book profits at these levels.\n\nDisclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, crypto news you shouldn't miss - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Mon 29 Jan 2024 \u25aa 9 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nAt the intersection of cutting-edge technology and economic fluctuations, the world of cryptocurrencies never fails to astonish us. This week, we witnessed a series of events that not only redefine the value and function of digital currencies but also their impact on our society and global economy. From the depths of the Mt. Gox affair to the heights reached by Solana, not to mention the imminent challenges of Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as the intrigues surrounding SHIB, each story is a thread in the complex labyrinth of crypto. Join us on this weekly journey as we unravel these threads to bring you a clear and precise understanding of the latest developments in this fascinating universe.\n\nBitcoin: The Storm Nears with the Distribution of 200,000 BTC from Mt. Gox\n\nIn 2014, the Bitcoin world was shaken by the hacking of Mt. Gox, one of the largest exchange platforms at the time. Today, after a decade of twists and turns, Mt. Gox is set to repay its creditors, marking a major turning point. This process will result in the release of 200,000 BTC into the crypto ecosystem. Recently, the mtgoxinsolvency subreddit has been buzzing following the receipt of emails requesting confirmation of identity and account details.\n\nThe announcement of the distribution by Mt. Gox comes at a time when Bitcoin, already below the $43,000 mark, seems to be on a tightrope. On the one hand, the threat of a crash induced by the massive sale of recovered BTC looms. On the other, a breeze of optimism is blowing thanks to the successful introduction of a Bitcoin ETF by BlackRock, signaling a new influx of capital. Investors remain suspended between hopes of gains and fears of losses, making the Mt. Gox distribution a potentially seminal event for Bitcoin\u2019s recent history.\n\nBitcoin Halving 2024: Miners Soon to Go Bankrupt?\n\nThe Bitcoin halving scheduled for March 2024 will cut miner rewards in half, a situation that could be catastrophic for many mining players if not offset by a price increase. In 2024, Bitcoin mining requires colossal technological means, with professional miners investing massively in high-performance computing equipment and spending huge amounts on electricity to power their mining farms. According to Cantor Fitzgerald, the average cost to produce a single bitcoin currently sits around $8,500.\n\nSo far, the bitcoin reward awarded for each validated block allowed many miners to partially offset these deficits. But after the 2024 halving, this reward will be halved, potentially falling to 3.125 BTC. Such a drastic reduction in income, without an equivalent increase in price, could spell doom for most mining companies. Only those with the most aggressive production costs might hope to continue creating value. The Cantor Fitzgerald report warns that without a substantial rise in the price of bitcoin, the halving could trigger a \u201ccrypto winter\u201d and a wave of bankruptcies, making mining economically unviable and threatening the decentralized integrity of the Bitcoin network.\n\nSolana Launches Token Extensions: A Sizeable Revolution!\n\nSolana recently announced the introduction of token extensions, heralding the dawn of a new era in the crypto space. These extensions are not mere additions but cornerstones of a structure aiming to revolutionize the SPL Token standard. They promise to turn security, compliance, and ease of use into tangible realities for businesses in the crypto sphere. Solana\u2019s token extensions introduce innovations such as transfer hooks, adjustable transfer fees, and confidential transfers, offering secure and compliant navigation in the crypto space.\n\nAnatoly Yakovenko, the visionary behind Solana Labs, sees these extensions as the essence of what makes Solana unique. Their potential for massive adoption is particularly captivating, and the Solana Foundation envisions a future where crypto businesses dive into Web3 with assurance. Furthermore, despite recent volatility, the SOL crypto shows signs of underlying strength that is impressively resilient.\n\nEthereum Developers Announce Major Update\n\nEthereum developers have announced the deployment schedule for Dencun, a crucial update aimed at improving performance and reducing transaction fees. This update will first be activated on the Sepolia and Holesky testnets, on January 30 and February 7 respectively, before its deployment on the mainnet. These testnet activations are essential to ensure a smooth transition to this new version of Ethereum. Tim Beiko, one of the lead developers, emphasizes the importance of these tests to validate the robustness of Dencun and prepare for its official launch.\n\nDencun continues the revolutionary work started by Shapella in 2023, integrating the \u201cEIP-4844\u201d update, better known as \u201cProtodanksharding.\u201d This advancement is expected to lead to a dramatic decrease in transaction fees for Ethereum-based layer 2 solutions, with an estimated reduction of 90% for protocols like Optimism or Arbitrum. This radical drop in costs promises to increase the accessibility and usage of the Ethereum blockchain, thus stimulating the emergence of new layer 2 innovations.\n\nMysterious Transfer of 420 Billion SHIB: Is The Hype Back?\n\nA massive transfer of 420 billion Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens, worth $3.87 million, has recently puzzled crypto investors. On January 21, an anonymous investor transferred this astronomical sum of SHIB between two unidentified Ethereum addresses. The origin of the tokens, initially stored in a wallet associated with Coinbase Prime Custody\u2019s institutional custody solution, suggests possible involvement of professional investors. This transfer, of a rare magnitude, adds to the confusion and speculation surrounding the transaction.\n\nThis major movement of SHIB occurs shortly after a similar transaction was identified by Arkham Intelligence, involving large purchases of Shiba Inu by Robinhood. The SHIB price, which has recently dropped to its lowest level since early December 2023, shows signs of repurchase, hinting at a possible trend reversal. If the SHIB price manages to consolidate around its current level, some analysts estimate that a sustained crossing of the $0.00001 threshold could be feasible, potentially adding a bullish element to this scenario.\n\nOnly 5 Exchanges Control 98% of the Crypto Market in Euros\n\nA recent study by Kaiko reveals that only five exchange platforms control 98% of the total volume of crypto exchanges in euros. Among more than a dozen exchanges offering euro transaction services, Bitvavo, Kraken, Coinbase, Bitstamp, and Binance overwhelmingly dominate the market. This high concentration underlines the disparity in the distribution of market shares among crypto exchanges.\n\nEuropean traders have shown a marked preference for Bitcoin (BTC) in 2023, with exchange volumes exceeding 37 billion euros. In comparison, Ether (ETH) from Ethereum and Ripple\u2019s XRP recorded respective volumes of 15 billion euros and 9.5 billion euros. This dynamic highlights Bitcoin\u2019s preeminent crypto status.\n\nBitcoin Bonanza: Uncle Sam Prepares a Mega Sale of Silk Road\u2019s Crypto Treasury\n\nThe U.S. government is set to conduct a sensational sale of $130 million worth of bitcoins, seized in the course of the infamous Silk Road scandal. Silk Road, a virtual black market specialized in money laundering and drug trafficking, was shut down in 2013, but the confiscated bitcoins continue to haunt auctions. This sale undoubtedly represents a unique opportunity for bidders.\n\nThe seizure of 69,000 BTC related to the Silk Road case by the United States and the announcement of their imminent sale raise questions about the possibility of laundering a criminal past through government auctions. This situation shines a light on the moral dilemma surrounding the sale of seized goods from illegal activities.\n\nThat\u2019s the main news to remember for this week.

        "content": "The NUPL value has not dropped much despite the recent volatility.\n\nThe short-term market sentiment was in favor of the sellers.\n\nEthereum [ETH] prices fell to the $2.2k support level once again after the recent slash in prices. The Bitcoin [BTC] selling pressure meant altcoins suffered too.\n\nYet, AMBCrypto noted that the NUPL metric showed optimism over the past two months.\n\nThe Net Unrealized Profit/Loss is defined as the difference between Relative Unrealized Profit and Relative Unrealized Loss. It has slowly climbed higher since October 2023.\n\nUnderstanding the sentiment behind Ethereum\n\nThe NUPL reached 0.385 on the 11th of January. The last time that the NUPL of ETH was higher was back in May 2022, according to data from Glassnode.\n\nThe Unrealized Profit or Unrealized Loss is calculated by weighting each circulating ETH by the difference between its current price and realized price.\n\nRealized price refers to the price of the ETH when it was last moved.\n\nTheir difference has been useful in gauging the market cycle of Bitcoin and Ethereum in the past. Right now, the 0.385 value is a sign that the sentiment was optimistic in the macrocycle.\n\nA look at the short-term sentiment showed the opposite. The Weighted Sentiment data from Santiment stood near zero to show social media engagement didn\u2019t favor the bears or the bulls.\n\nThe Open Interest slid sharply on the 22nd and the 23rd of January, alongside the price of Ethereum. The OI had not yet recovered at press time.\n\nThe inference was that Futures participants preferred to remain sidelined as ETH traded near its $2.2k support zone.\n\nThe ETF approval caught many participants offside\n\nAfter the 11th of January, ETH has trended downward on the lower timeframe price charts (such as the 1-hour chart). Yet, from the 12th to the 22nd of January, the estimated leverage ratio climbed higher.\n\nHowever, it fell rapidly from 22nd to 24th January as prices nosedived.\n\nThis suggested that, while a good portion of speculators chose to remain sidelined (OI was falling slowly at that time) a large number also sought to increase leverage in the hopes of catching a breakout upward.\n\nAMBCrypto analyzed the estimated liquidation levels of ETH and found that the $2.3k mark was important yet again.\n\nThe Cumulative Liq Levels Delta was negative, meaning that short liquidations outweighed the long ones.\n\nHence, there is a better chance of a bounce in prices to liquidate these short sellers, than a bearish continuation over the next few days.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nTo the north, the $2310 level had close to $100 million in estimated liquidations. Many smaller liquidation levels were clustered around the $2.3k mark.\n\nTherefore, a bounce to the $2310-$2350 area has a good likelihood. Whether Ethereum will face a rejection from there or a bullish recovery remains to be seen."

Bitcoin (BTC) owners increased by 33%, rising from 222 million in January to 296 million by December, representing 51% of global cryptocurrency owners. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) saw an even more significant rise of 39%, growing from 89 million owners at the start of the year to 124 million by the end, accounting for 21% of the global total.\n\nThe report attributes Bitcoin\u2019s adoption growth primarily to Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the introduction of the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol. This protocol has enabled the minting of both non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and fungible tokens directly on the Bitcoin network, marking a significant advancement in the cryptocurrency\u2019s capabilities and appeal.\n\nIt says :\n\n\u201cStrong interest from institutional investors also contributed to the increase in BTC\u2019s adoption.\u201d\n\nEthereum Adoption Boosted by Liquid Staking Post-Shanghai Upgrade\n\nThe report highlights Ethereum\u2019s significant adoption growth , attributing it largely to the advancements in liquid staking following the Shanghai Upgrade. This upgrade enabled the withdrawals of staked ETH, marking Ethereum\u2019s transition to a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain. This development has been a key factor in driving Ethereum\u2019s increased adoption.\n\nThe prices of BTC and ETH saw a substantial rise, with BTC momentarily hitting the $44,000 mark and ETH reaching around $2,400. Concurrently, there was a significant surge in popularity for BRC-20 tokens and inscriptions, drawing in a wide variety of investors and crypto enthusiasts.\n\n\ud83d\udea8SOLD OUT!!\ud83d\udea8 Natively Digital: An Ordinal Curated sale smashed the pre sale estimates ! \u2013 Total: $1,097,000 (26 BTC)\n\n(Double the pre sale low estimate)\n\n\u2013 100% of lots sold\n\n\u2013 641 bids\n\n\u2013 95 bidders and buyers\n\n\u2013 Half of the sale sold for over their high estimates Congrats to\u2026 pic.twitter.com/jEMgMUtajl \u2014 Michael Bouhanna (@michaelbouhanna) January 22, 2024\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the green light to 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, including a noteworthy conversion of Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin trust (GBTC) into an ETF. Since its launch, Grayscale has experienced substantial outflows, in contrast to several other spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nNotably, Blackrock\u2019s Ishares Bitcoin Trust has attracted significant inflows, indicating a shifting landscape in investment preferences within the crypto ETF market."

Ethereum (ETH) also clocked significant losses over the week but has now managed to neutralize its position.\n\nOn Saturday, Bitcoin\u2019s price stood at a level close to $42,200, marking a daily increase of 1% as per CoinGlass data. The trading volume in crypto derivatives dropped significantly, down 55% to $21.50 billion. Despite this, Bitcoin\u2019s total market value stayed at $828.78 billion, with open interest (OI) for Bitcoin reported at $17.98 billion. 24-hour liquidations surpassed $13.37 million, indicating sell pressure.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn comparison, Ethereum was priced close to $2,280, with a modest daily increase. The amount traded fell by nearly 50% to $8.44 billion, while its total market value was $275.03 billion. Ethereum\u2019s OI stood at $7.79 billion, with liquidations totaling $4.35 million.\n\nBTC vs ETH: Key metrics analysis\n\nIntoTheBlock\u2019s metrics reveal insightful details about the two cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin\u2019s large transaction volume decreased by 39.08% to $25.93 billion, indicating a decrease in high-value transactions. Daily active addresses increased by 7.76% to 979,300, reflecting a rise in user activity. The holder\u2019s balance slightly rose to $581.26 billion. Notably, exchange netflows saw a significant drop of 129.87% and touched negative $71.71 million. The whale participation rate stood at 2.31%. Currently, 82.45% of Bitcoin holders are \u2018in the money,\u2019 showing a positive investment return.\n\nFor Ethereum, the large transaction volume also decreased by 49.58% to $2.14 billion. Daily active addresses were at 595,640, up by 9.94%. Ethereum\u2019s holder\u2019s balance increased to $218.04 billion. Exchange netflows showed a dramatic decrease of 405.1% and touched negative $96.24 million. Ethereum whale participation rate was significantly higher at 36.89%, with 71.70% of holders \u2018in the money.\u2019\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum are experiencing a decline in large transaction volumes, which implies a relatively reduced trading interest from investors. The negative exchange netflows for both suggest that users are moving their holdings out of exchanges.\n\nIntoTheBlock also noted that Bitcoin and Ethereum saw over a 30% decrease in transaction fees, attributed to reduced market volatility and less urgent need for transactions among users.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum fees declined over 30% as market volatility decreased, leading to relatively less urgency amongst users transacting pic.twitter.com/Bk3Wd1SblY \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 26, 2024\n\nWhat are analysts betting on?\n\nCrypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe recently said in a post on X, \u201cI personally believe that #Ethereum is going to outperform #Bitcoin in the upcoming period and it has started since the ETF approval.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out a \u2018massive weekly bullish divergence\u2019 and crucial resistance at 0.06 BTC.

With its own cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), Ethereum (ETH) has become a platform for numerous other cryptocurrencies and the execution of decentralized smart contracts. The question on many investors' minds is whether Ethereum (ETH) can reach the monumental price point of $10,000.\n\nEthereum's price is predicted to reach $10,000 due to the growth and acceptance of cryptocurrencies, its potential to become a global decentralized application platform, and its scarcity. With a total supply of 120,181,248 ETH, Ethereum's scarcity creates a sense of rarity and exclusivity, potentially pushing its price higher. Network upgrades, such as the London hard fork, enhance scalability, security, and functionality, making it a more robust platform. However, potential challenges include market volatility, regulatory uncertainties, competition from other blockchain platforms, and scalability issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nOption2Trade (O2T): A Promising Alternative\n\nAs investors evaluate the potential of Ethereum, another player is emerging in the trading and investment space: Option2Trade (O2T).

This enables traders to succeed in the market.\n\n\n\n\n\nOption2Trade: Outperforming ETH ROI in 2024\n\nWhile Ethereum (ETH) has proven to be a lucrative investment, Option2Trade (O2T) presents a compelling opportunity for investors looking to maximize their ROI. With its innovative features and commitment to revolutionizing the trading landscape, Option2Trade (O2T) has the potential to outperform Ethereum (ETH) in terms of return on investment.\n\nOption2Trade's O2T token, available for $0.007 per token, is designed to enhance user engagement, democratize platform governance, and provide unique opportunities for traders and gaming enthusiasts. Its integration into the Option2Trade (O2T) ecosystem and beyond makes it a valuable asset in the evolving world of cryptocurrency and blockchain-based gaming.\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum (ETH) and Option2Trade (O2T) are leading in the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology world.

        "content": "How ICP steals the spotlight from Bitcoin and Ethereum: A Big Innovation in Blockchain. Raj Awasthi \u00b7 Follow 3 min read \u00b7 Jan 30, 2024 -- Listen Share\n\nSince we have introduced blockchain technology, we have explored what Bitcoin and Ethereum are. Now we have another blockchain product (ICP) that surely takes charge of its unlimited possibilities.\n\nIn the Bitcoin ecosystem, the objective was to develop a decentralized digital currency that facilitates security and immutability. Apart from this, the Ethereum ecosystem was more like a decentralized platform for the installation of dApps (decentralized applications), focusing on smart contracts and programmability.\n\nIn 2021, the ICP (the internet computer) entered the blockchain industry as the third invention of the blockchain that brought the concept of infinite blockchain and redefined the development of everything.\n\nPhoto by Pierre Borthiry - Peiobty on Unsplash\n\nIn this article, we\u2019re going to take a look at how ICP transforms the outlook of the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems.\n\nHow does ICP affect the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems?\n\nIntroducing Decentralized Identity (DID):\n\nWith the inclusion of a decentralized identity, it's now a much more secure approach to storing the data. Unlike traditional protocols, which have very few ways to provide identity and authentication,\n\nThis innovation provides the benefit of an extra identity layer to the users of Bitcoin and Ethereum for the sake of reducing fraud.\n\nSignificant evolution of smart contracts:\n\nAs the blockchain landscape is evolving, there is an important advancement in smart contracts. In ICP, canister smart contracts provide a reliable and secure alternative to Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts.\n\nWith the advancement of smart canisters, it may be beneficial for developers who want to create innovative applications on ICP that interact with Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nEnabling remarkable interoperability:\n\nNot only Bitcoin integration but also ICP bridges the gap with Ethereum and fosters a seamless collaboration between the two ecosystems. This eliminates the need for bridges and achieves full decentralization.\n\nThis direct interface creates unparalleled opportunities for frictionless interactions between ICP and the Bitcoin blockchain, opening up new routes for decentralized applications.\n\nIncluding scaling capabilities and cost efficiency:\n\nUnlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, IPC comes with infinite scaling capabilities, as there are no limitations on transactions per second (TPS), which is 7 for Bitcoin and 15-20 for Ethereum. It's very important to have such an amazing scaling capacity, as it\u2019s very important for the future growth of ICP.\n\nThe cost efficiency of storing 1GB of data on ICP is approximately $5 per year, which is around $350,000,000 for Ethereum. This cost-effectiveness is one of the biggest reasons for the inclination towards ICP.\n\nSeamless integration with Bitcoin and Ethereum:\n\nThe Internet Computer (ICP) is altering the decentralized environment with its distinct set of features and capabilities. Through direct integration with Bitcoin, smooth interaction with Ethereum, and the ability to offer interactive web content directly to consumers, ICP envisions a future in which blockchain technology fulfills its full potential. Whether you're a consumer looking for a more accessible and user-friendly blockchain experience or an investor looking for game-changing companies, ICP provides an attractive opportunity to investigate the possibilities of decentralized innovation. Embrace the power of the Internet and start on the road toward a decentralized future.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nThe third invention of blockchain technology holds an amazing future for integrating with other blockchain platforms like Bitcoin and Ethereum. ICP takes an important step towards improving scalability, security, and, of course, transparency. With its optimum utilization, now we can build everything differently. As we all know, it's the era of the digital revolution, and blockchain is not an exception.\n\nHowever, it's also important to understand that ICP is still in the process of development, and with time, it will pave the way to building a whole different world along with proper governance of it.\n\nSo there you have it. If you have any suggestions for this post, feel free to join the discussion.\n\nThis is Raj Awasthi.\n\nSigning off!"

        "content": "Solana\u2019s Jupiter has risen to the top of the list of DEXes by trading volume.\n\nUniswap founder Hayden Adams has disputed Jupiter\u2019s claim to the top.\n\nJupiter\u2019s rise follows fresh capital injection into the Solana ecosystem and airdrop incentives.\n\nFollowing Solana\u2018s blistering run in 2023, competition between the Layer 1 blockchain and Ethereum, widely regarded as the DeFi king, is heating up. As the competition intensifies, Jupiter, a liquidity aggregator handling the bulk of Solana\u2019s DEX volumes, has risen to the top of the list of DEXes by 24-hour volume, seemingly surpassing Ethereum\u2019s Uniswap.\n\nJupiter\u2019s rise has elicited a flurry of reactions from crypto community members, including Uniswap founder Hayden Adams, who has disputed the competing protocol\u2019s claim to the top.\n\nUniswap\u2019s Adams Throws Shade\n\nOver the past 24 hours, Jupiter has risen to the top spot in CoinGecko\u2018s ranking of DEXes by volume. At the time of writing, the platform continues to hold this position with over $521 million.\n\nDEXes ranking by 24-hour volume. Source: CoinGecko\n\nUnsurprisingly, Jupiter\u2019s achievement has caught headlines, especially as it appears to sit atop Uniswap, Ethereum\u2019s largest DEX. This narrative, however, has faced resistance from Uniswap\u2019s Hayden Adams.\n\nResponding to reports of Jupiter flipping Uniswap, Adams contended that Uniswap\u2019s 24-hour volume was around $700 million, including its version 2 deployment on Ethereum and its deployments across Ethereum scaling solutions like Arbitrum One, Polygon, and Optimism. He implied that Jupiter\u2019s claim to the top was only temporary and fueled by airdrop speculation.\n\n\"Have seen this tweet from many protocols over the years often around an airdrop. The real challenge is being #2 in these screenshots every damn time,\" he wrote.\n\nHowever, most of the Solana faithful have shared a different view from Adams. For example, responding to Adams\u2019 post, Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko quipped, \u201conly a matter of time,\u201d likely expressing the view that Jupiter will eventually surpass Uniswap.\n\nUnderstanding Jupiter\u2019s Rise\n\nOver the past two months, Jupiter\u2019s trading volume has been on a tear, peaking at $16.6 billion in December 2023 from $3.9 billion the month before. This month, the trading volume on the platform has already exceeded $15.3 billion, with many anticipating that it would exceed the December peak.\n\nJupiter\u2019s monthly trading volume. Source: Jupiter Station\n\nThe platform\u2019s rise has been heavily linked to the inflow of fresh capital into the Solana ecosystem through airdrops from projects like Jito and Pyth. In addition to this capital inflow, Jupiter has incentivized activity by promising its airdrop of JUP tokens to active users. Distribution of this airdrop is scheduled to start on January 31.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nCoinMarketCap \u2018s DEX ranking , at the time of writing, places Jupiter in sixth place with $278 million in 24-hour trading volume, far below Uniswap v3 on Ethereum in the top spot with over $466 million.\n\nUniswap remains the largest DEX by TVL with an impressive $4.1 billion, per Defi Llama data at the time of writing.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nUniswap\u2019s Hayden Adams reaction to Jupiter\u2019s rise highlights the growing intensity of the competition between Ethereum and Solana.\n\nRead this for more on the Ethereum-Solana rivalry:\n\nCan Solana Stablecoin Volume Threaten Ethereum\u2019s Dominance?\n\n\n\nFind out how to stay safe from Ondo Finance honeypot scams:\n\nBeware of Ondo Finance Honeypot Tokens: How to Stay Safe"

        "content": "Trading application Unibot will issue a native Solana ecosystem token that accrues value back to holders of the original Ethereum-based UNIBOT tokens, a move that initially met with criticism and caused volatile price action last week.\n\nUnibot expanded to the Solana ecosystem in late December but said last week it would introduce a UNISOL token that accrued revenue in the form of Solana\u2019s SOL tokens. The decision created concerns among long-time UNIBOT holders, who feared dilution as traders would be inclined to choose the newer token in favor of the older one. A sell-off ensued.\n\nBut developers said early Monday that UNISOL could ultimately boost UNIBOT\u2019s value accrual, helping ease some losses from the past few days as traders priced in new information. The Unibot platform connects user wallets to the decentralized exchange Uniswap and lets them punt on tokens just as easily as they would send messages to each other on the popular messaging app by using the messaging application Telegram or a terminal.\n\nUNIBOT slid from over $100 to as low as $48. (DEXTools)\n\n\u201cThe revenue sharing for protocol revenue generated by @UnibotOnSolana is split 50/50 between two pools,\u201d developers posted on X. \u201cPool #1: simply being a holder of $UNIBOT on Ethereum, no strings attached. You'll link your Ethereum address, which holds $UNIBOT to a Solana address that receives revenue in the form of SOL. Pool #2: holders of $UNISOL on Solana.\u201d\n\nUNIBOT holders are set to receive some 80% of the supply of UNISOL through a snapshot and claim mechanism. Since its early January launch, over 20,000 users have generated more than $130m in total volume, developers claimed Monday.\n\n//ANNOUNCEMENT\n\n\n\nWe'd like to clear the confusion around the path forward.\n\n\n\nThe revenue sharing for protocol revenue generated by @UnibotOnSolana is split 50/50 between two pools, described as follows.\n\nPool #1: simply being a holder of $UNIBOT on Ethereum, no strings attached.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/vqEVVhG1FI \u2014 Unibot (@TeamUnibot) January 28, 2024\n\nOn-chain data shows Unibot has garnered 11,700 ether (ETH) in fees since the platform went live in May, paying out a portion of this straight to token holders. Users have also steadily increased, reaching 41,000 on Monday compared to just over 2,000 at the end of last June.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Sunday alone, the platform generated $74,000 in fees across Solana and Ethereum on $7.5 million in combined volumes.\n\n(Dune)\n\nPer Dune Analytics, Unibot's average daily volumes are just above $5.5 million, a long way from the $900 million daily on the market-leading DEX Uniswap.\n\nUNIBOT prices are up 21% in the past 24 hours, DEXTools data shows."

        "content": "The week brought a whirlwind of crypto news, with some coins soaring, others selling, and a few even burning. Dogecoin\u2019s value spiked, Donald Trump made significant moves in the Ethereum and MAGA Coin markets, a Colorado pastor admitted to fraud charges, and Shiba Inu\u2019s burn rate skyrocketed. Here\u2019s a quick look at what transpired.\n\nDogecoin Value Surges on Musk\u2019s X App Buzz\n\nOver the weekend, Dogecoin DOGE/USD value soared by more than 10% following the establishment of a dedicated account for the planned payment feature on Elon Musk\u2019s \u201ceverything app\u201d X.

        "content": "The crypto community is currently in a frenzy over Pullix (PLX). It has sold over 80M tokens and raised nearly $5M during its ongoing presale. Some analysts have even pegged this Stage 6 presale star as the next 100x altcoin in 2024. But can this newcomer outshine established players like Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH)? Today, we will find out.\n\nPullix (PLX): One of the Best Cryptos To Buy\n\nWith its ongoing presale, Pullix (PLX) has been making waves in the DeFi market. It recently announced that over 13,000 individuals have signed up for it, and 4000 people are part of its community. Global investors have faith and confidence in Pullix\u2019s long-term growth potential.\n\nPullix aims to change how people trade online by combining the best parts of CEX and DEX. This makes it different from other platforms. With a platform like Binance, you can only trade cryptocurrencies. On Pullix, you can trade all asset classes (Forex, gold, cryptos, etc.) on one account.\n\nBehind the trading services is the PLX native token. Holding this token reduces trading fees and access to specific assets. The remarkable thing about this altcoin is its \u201cTrade-to-Earn\u201d revenue-sharing model. To clarify, just staking PLX will earn users a portion of the daily revenue made by Pullix.\n\nEach PLX token is now valued at $0.10, a 100% ROI if you bought it early. Its long-term growth is excellent thanks to its ties to the OTC derivatives market, which BIS valued at $20.7T in 2022. Market analysts predict that once PLX hits major exchanges in Q1 2024, its value will spike by 100x.\n\nSolana (SOL) Introduces Token Extensions\n\nMeanwhile, Solana (SOL) has introduced token extensions. This is a groundbreaking implementation of complicated pre-built token functionality on the blockchain. Developers can now build their tokens with the extension matching unique needs.\n\nThis exciting Solana news raised interest in this altcoin. On the price charts, SOL has fluctuated between $98.23 and $87.10 in the past week alone. During that time, its market cap has also moved between $42.52B and $37.27B. With the bullish Solana crypto sentiment, market analysts forecast a potential pump to $101.37 before February 2024 ends.\n\nMicha\u00ebl Van De Poppe With a Bullish Ethereum Price Prediction\n\nCrypto analyst Micha\u00ebl Van De Poppe recently predicted a bullish Ethereum (ETH) price. According to his new tweet, Ethereum\u2019s momentum may come in the next few weeks. This rally may be due to the Ethereum ETF hype and Bitcoin\u2019s bottoming out.\n\nThe Ethereum price has fluctuated widely this past week. On both ends, it moved from $2,504 to $2,204. The same goes for market cap, which jumped to $301B just to dip to $264B later. Market analysts foresee the Ethereum crypto soaring to $2,358 within Q1 of 2024.\n\nWill Pullix Outpace Solana and Ethereum?\n\nAt just $20M, Pullix\u2019s early-stage market cap is much smaller than Solana and Ethereum\u2019s. With such a head start, Pullix could surge ahead of them and reach unimaginable heights without needing as much cash. A low market cap plus groundbreaking features make Pullix one of the top altcoins to watch.\n\nFor more information regarding Pullix\u2019s presale see links below:\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Polygon zkEVM is on the brink of an upgrade to become the first Type 2 zkEVM.\n\nPolygon Labs contends that the upgrade would provide the \u201coptimal\u201d balance between EVM equivalence and performance.\n\nThis article explains the shift and how it affects users and developers.\n\nPositive developments continue to come in hard and fast for Polygon zkEVM. As the Polygon-powered Ethereum Layer 2 bolsters DeFi activity in its mainnet beta stage 2, the network looks set to take a critical technological leap forward.\n\nOn Saturday, January 27, developers kicked off the ten-day timelock for the Etrog update, which promises to make Polygon zkEVM the first Type 2 zkEVM in a move that could see it attract more developers and optimize user experience.\n\nIn this article, DailyCoin explains what this means for developers and end users and how it compares with other zkEVM models, starting with why there are different models in the first place.\n\nWhy Are There Different Types of zkEVMs?\n\nzkEVM\u2019s are often hailed as the gold standard of scaling solutions because they can scale the Ethereum network without sacrificing security and decentralization. But these solutions have their challenges.\n\nAs Polygon Labs Developer Relations Engineer Jarrod Watts has previously highlighted, Ethereum was not initially designed with ZK applications in mind. Due to this design, some EVM operational codes can be difficult to prove, meaning that the closer a ZK virtual machine is to the EVM in operational code equivalence, the more difficult it is to generate ZK proofs.\n\nThe challenge of building an EVM-compatible ZK rollup is that Ethereum was not originally designed around ZK-friendliness.\n\n\n\nThis means that there are many parts of the Ethereum protocol that take a large amount of computation to ZK-prove.\n\n\n\n(4/50) \u2014 Jarrod Watts (@jarrodWattsDev) July 17, 2023\n\nFaced with this challenge when designing zkEVMs, developers often have to balance compatibility and efficiency. The varying approaches to strike this balance have led to the different zkEVM types.\n\nThe ZK-EVM Types\n\nIn an August 2022 blog post, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin classified zkEVMs into four and a half categories based on EVM compatibility and performance. These classes are:\n\nType 1: These zkEVMs are fully Ethereum equivalent and do not change any part of the Ethereum system. However, these take the longest time to generate proofs. An example of a Type 1 zkEVM is Taiko.\n\nThese zkEVMs are fully Ethereum equivalent and do not change any part of the Ethereum system. However, these take the longest time to generate proofs. An example of a Type 1 zkEVM is Taiko. Type 2: Like type 1, these zkEVMs are also fully Ethereum equivalent. Unlike Type 1, however, they make minor changes to the system to improve the proof generation times. While there are currently no Type 2 zkEVMs, Polygon, Linea, and Scroll have been working toward it, with Polygon looking set to take pole position.\n\nLike type 1, these zkEVMs are also fully Ethereum equivalent.

While there are currently no Type 2 zkEVMs, Polygon, Linea, and Scroll have been working toward it, with Polygon looking set to take pole position. Type 2.5: These zkEVMs are EVM equivalent like the other two classes. However, they change gas costs to allow for faster proof generation. On the downside, these changes create DApp incompatibilities. Like Type 2, there are currently no Type 2.5 zkEVMs, though Kakarot has announced it is working on one.\n\nThese zkEVMs are EVM equivalent like the other two classes.

Like Type 2, there are currently no Type 2.5 zkEVMs, though Kakarot has announced it is working on one. Type 3: These are almost EVM equivalent zkEVMs. They make changes to allow for even faster proof generation and easier development. Type 3 zkEVMs include Polygon zkEVM, Linea, and Scroll.\n\nThese are almost EVM equivalent zkEVMs. They make changes to allow for even faster proof generation and easier development. Type 3 zkEVMs include Polygon zkEVM, Linea, and Scroll. Type 4: These zkEVMs are only high-level language equivalents. They do not support some DApps but are the easiest to build and the fastest in proof generation. zkSync Era is a type 4 zkEVM.\n\nSo what does becoming a Type 2 mean for Polygon zkEVM?\n\nAn Optimized Experience?\n\nIn the blog post announcing the beginning of the Etrog update ten-day timelock, Polygon Labs developers contend that Type 2 zkEVMs strike the \u201coptimal\u201d balance between EVM equivalence and performance.\n\nThe Etrog update means developers could copy and paste their Ethereum code on the zkEVM with no required changes, thanks to the network\u2019s complete EVM equivalence. The team would hope that this new level of compatibility will attract even more Ethereum developers to build for the rollup.\n\nOn the other hand, users may have to face slower withdrawal to Ethereum due to slower proof generation than Type 3. Nonetheless, Polygon Labs maintains that the Polygon zkEVM would remain relatively fast and cheap. To improve the user experience and bolster network efficiency, Etrog modifies the network to allow blocks to hold multiple transactions and batches to hold multiple blocks.\n\nEtrog will go live on the Polygon zkEVM on February 6.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nType 2 compromises on proof generation speeds for full EVM equivalence.\n\nL2Beat data at the time of writing ranks Polygon zkEVM as the thirteenth largest Ethereum Layer 2 chain by TVL with $116 million.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nWith Polygon zkEVM set to revamp its zkEVM model, you must understand what it entails and how it affects you.\n\nRead this for more on Polygon zkEVM:\n\nPolygon zkEVM Turns to Grants to Lure Builders in DeFi Push\n\n\n\nLearn about the latest frontier in the growing competition between Ethereum and Solana:\n\nUniswap Founder Disputes Solana\u2019s Jupiter DEX Dominance"

However, with the rising anticipations for a bullish market this week, will ETH price surpass the overhead resistance?\n\nWith Ethereum\u2019s total value locked dripping under $32b, the pressure is starting to grow back on the altcoin.\n\nDespite the rising sentiments and the resurfacing hopes of a bullish year, the altcoins market struggles to sustain the recovery rally of last week. Nevertheless, the biggest altcoin is setting a bullish stage for 2024 and teases a run beyond $3K this year.\n\nTo find out if Ethereum will reach the $10K, check out our ETH price prediction.\n\nShort-Pause in ETH Price Fall Marks A Critical Stage\n\nSource \u2013 TradingView\n\nCurrently trading at $2,261, the ETH price shows a minimal indecisive intraday trend that continues the streak from the weekends. The lazy price movement aligns with the lethargic price movement of Bitcoin at the start of Asian market hours.\n\nWith the reversal from the 38.20% Fibonacci level struggling to lift off, the 50-day exponential average line comes as a dynamic resistance. The ongoing brawl undermines the bullish engulfing candle formation from Friday and may result in a retest.\n\nHowever, despite the failure, the ETH price may find a double bottom reversal to reclaim the lost momentum and break above the 50-day EMA.\n\nHence, the buyers can sustain above the $2200 level to break above the dynamics resistance; the bullish trend could reach the $2500 mark. Optimistically, as per the Fibonacci levels, the bull run can test the $2700 level.\n\nOn the flip side, if buyers can fail to assert dominance over $2200, a bearish slip can result in a ETC price drop to $2000\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nMACD indicator: The daily MACD and signal lines are continuing the bearish trend, but the uptick teases a bullish crossover.\n\nHow Many Ethereum HODLers Are Making Money?\n\nWith the Ethereum prices sustaining above the $2000 psychological milestone, the percentage of profitable addresses (in the money) is significantly higher. At press time, 78.08m addresses are in the money, accounting for 72.13% of total addresses."

        "content": "Crypto news: Ethereum Price Resilience Near $2,256 Amidst 1.25% Decline\n\nIn the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, Ethereum continues to make waves as it approaches the formidable US$2,256 mark, demonstrating resilience even in the face of a minor 1.25% decline. This subtle setback does little to diminish the overall bullish sentiment surrounding the second-largest cryptocurrency, as it navigates the intricate landscape of the digital market.\n\nCrypto news: Ethereum\u2019s price displayed resilience as it formed a foundation and initiated a recovery phase, surpassing the US$2,256 resistance. Despite encountering resistance of around US$2,300 resulting in a pullback below US$2,280 the bulls remained active above the US$2,240 support. The price rebounded, breaking a bearish trend line near US$2,265 and surpassing the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nCurrently trading above US$2,256, Ethereum faces its initial hurdle at US$2,280, followed by a more substantial barrier at US$2,300. A successful breach could propel the price toward testing the US$2,350 resistance. The market\u2019s dynamics indicate ongoing fluctuations, with key support levels and resistance zones dictating Ethereum\u2019s short-term trajectory.\n\nIs Ethereum a Solid Investment?\n\nWhen considering Ethereum as an investment, it\u2019s deemed favorable for long-term portfolios. The cryptocurrency\u2019s robust fundamentals and expanding ecosystem position it as a standout player in the crypto market. While its potential is promising, investors are advised to stay mindful of market dynamics and make informed decisions.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Price Trajectory: A Look into 2024\n\nDue to the recent approval of spot BTC ETF and the anticipation of an ETH ETF approval, some analysts are predicting crypto price targets as high as $10,000 for Ethereum. The pivotal marker to observe in 2024 is US$3,300. Surpassing this level could signify the initiation of a rapid upward trend toward our target.\n\nBalancing Ambition with Realism\n\nWhile the US$10,000 mark appears distant, constituting a 5x increase from current prices, it\u2019s essential to acknowledge the strong correlation between Ethereum and Bitcoin. Achieving this target implies Bitcoin reaching approximately US$200,000, a goal potentially extending beyond the 2024 timeframe. Investors should approach these projections with a balanced perspective, factoring in the interconnected nature of crypto markets and the broader economic landscape.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Future:\n\nCrypto analyst Benjamin Cowen recently delved into Ethereum\u2019s potential future, emphasizing its close ties to Bitcoin\u2019s performance. He noted that Ethereum\u2019s USD value is intricately linked to Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory, especially if Bitcoin experiences a significant rebound. However, Cowen highlights the crucial factor of monitoring how Ethereum performs against Bitcoin during these shifts.\n\nHistorical Patterns:\n\nExamining historical cycles, Cowen identified a recurring pattern for Ethereum, involving the formation of lows, followed by higher lows, before potential breakdowns. This historical tendency suggests that Ethereum might retest previous lows, an event likely preceding a more substantial drop.\n\nETHBTC Pair: A Pivotal Indicator\n\nCowen underlines the significance of the ETHBTC pair, indicating its critical role in forecasting Ethereum\u2019s future. If this pair breaks down, Cowen suggests it could precede a notable drop in Ethereum\u2019s USD value, aligning with patterns observed in prior cycles.\n\nTesting Previous Lows: Below $1,000?\n\nSpeculating on Ethereum\u2019s trajectory, Cowen anticipates a potential testing of previous lows, potentially dipping below US$1,000. He emphasizes Ethereum\u2019s historical inclination to retest lows before significant recoveries or further declines.\n\nScenarios for Ethereum\u2019s Movement\n\nCowen discusses diverse scenarios for Ethereum\u2019s near-term movement, contemplating a gradual decline or a notable push higher, reminiscent of past movements that witnessed substantial increases.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Influence:\n\nArguing that Ethereum\u2019s upward momentum hinges on Bitcoin\u2019s bounce, Cowen stresses the interdependence of Ethereum\u2019s movements with Bitcoin\u2019s market behavior.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "TLDR\n\nRebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) remains in the blockchain ICO spotlight as it initiates Monarchs Round 4 of its presale.\n\nAnalysts predict that Uniswap (UNI) will rise to $8.44 before the end of February.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) bulls expect ETC to drop to $20.30 before the end of January.\n\nAfter a strong performance at the close of 2023, the crypto market has taken a downturn this year. Investors seeking profits in 2024 and beyond are now questioning the potential of top crypto coins like UNI and ETC. Interestingly, $RBLZ, an emerging meme coin, has gained significant investor interest by surging 120% during its public presale. What draws Uniswap and Ethereum Classic investors to Rebel Satoshi? Keep reading to discover the reasons!\n\nUniswap Price Prediction: Analysts Foresee An Uptrend For UNI\n\nAs of January 4, as reported by news channels, Uniswap dominated the Ethereum block space with a remarkable 43 million transactions, surpassing the second-ranking protocol by 4.5 times. This announcement caused a serious buzz in Uniswap\u2019s community, yet, UNI has been on a downtrend since then.\n\nOn January 4, UNI traded at $6.54, but it dropped to $5.84 on January 23, signaling a 10.70% dip in UNI\u2019s value. Despite this drop in Uniswap\u2019s value, top market analysts are optimistic about a UNI pump due to the increasing activity in its ecosystem. Thus, they predict that UNI will rise to $8.44 before the end of February.\n\nConversely, some experts have a bearish outlook for Uniswap because of a potential exit of investors following its bearish trend. As such, they predict that UNI could dip to $5.10 before the end of January. Due to this bearish forecast for Uniswap, analysts advise investors to try out Ethereum Classic or Rebel Satoshi.\n\nEthereum Classic Price Prediction: Analysts Predict A Surge For ETC Despite Recent Downtrend\n\nBinance expanded its trading options and enhanced user experience with the introduction of four new spot trading pairs on January 19. Notably, Ethereum Classic was affected, as ETC/FDUSD was among the newly added pairs.\n\nSince this announcement, the value of Ethereum Classic has dropped. On January 19, ETC traded at $25.34, but it dropped to $23.08 on January 23, signaling an 8.92% dip. Despite this drop in Ethereum Classic\u2019s value, market experts are still bullish about ETC because of the crypto market bull wave. Hence, they expect ETC to reach $30.14 by the end of February.\n\nOn the other hand, some analysts are skeptical about Ethereum Classic because of the lack of reduced activity in its ecosystem. Thus, they expect ETC to drop to $20.30 before the end of January.\n\nRebel Satoshi Surges 120% and Emerges as Top Choice for Investors!\n\nThis rising meme coin challenging centralization, Rebel Satoshi, has been gaining attention in the crypto community during its public presale.

        "content": "Polygon Labs is introducing a potential solution to the Ethereum blockchain's fragmentation issues. In February, the L2 Ethereum scaling solution plans to launch AggLayer - a decentralized protocol that relies on zk-proofs to unite different blockchains into one single layer of usability.\n\nAggLayer is central to the development team's vision of making Ethereum as easy to navigate and engage with as the everyday internet, to encourage the general public to get on board with Web3. To achieve this, the user experience has to be greatly improved from its current state.\n\nIn the last couple of years, the fast pace of development in the sector has led to many improvements in UX, but these have also introduced new challenges.\n\nA modular blockchain architecture has allowed the ecosystem to surpass the scalability issues of the first monolithic chains. However, their proliferation has created a deeply fragmented ecosystem, where users and liquidity are separated on their own individual chains.\n\nThe purpose of AggLayer is to create an \"environment that feels like a single chain\" for end users to seamlessly transact and move between dApps built on different chains. As Polygon state, \"There will be no mass adoption with siloed liquidity and users.\"\n\nDevelopers will also benefit, as using the protocol will allow them to attract users regardless of where they choose to build their projects. Additionally, as the proposal eliminates the need for complicated bridging schemes, individual chains will be able to maintain their full sovereignty.\n\nIn this way, the protocol is hoping to enable \"near-instant, atomic transactions, unifies liquidity across the ecosystem, creates capital efficiency, and dramatically improves UX.\"\n\nPolygon Labs is just one of the development teams trying to solve the fragmented liquidity issue. Also this week, Ethereum Layer 2 protocol Polymer announced its plans to integrate the Cosmos Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol into the Ethereum ecosystem to allow for cross-chain dApps on the blockchain.\n\nPolygon's vision will likely gain more traction as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain has a much larger user base. According to blockchain analytics firm Flipside, in 2023, Polygon acquired 15.4 million users.\n\nAlmost 40% of these new users joined the chain in January, followed by a steady decline in monthly user acquisition. However, the L2 solution was still the blockchain that gained the second most users in the industry, just 160,000 users less than Ethereum and almost 5 million more than Bitcoin.\n\n'Aggregation Day', planned for next month, will open the way for more users to join the network and, by doing so, take the vision of a united and uniform Web3 forwards."

Its modules, like ethers.provider, are well equipped for the Ethereum Blockchain and can interact with its nodes easily to establish a connection.\n\nSigning and sending transactions\n\nEthers.js makes it easy to sign and send transactions. The library includes a signer object that can be used to sign transactions and a provider object that can be used to send signed transactions to the Ethereum network.\n\nQuerying Blockchain data\n\nEthers.js also provides an easy way to query data from the Ethereum Blockchain. The library includes a provider object that can be used to send JSON-RPC requests to an Ethereum node and retrieve data from the Blockchain.\n\nAdvanced Topics in Ethers.js\n\nContract deployment and interaction\n\nEthers.js makes it easy to deploy and interact with smart contracts. The library includes a Contract object that can deploy new contracts and interact with existing ones.\n\nContract testing with Ethers.js\n\nEthers.js can also be used for contract testing.

Some analysts, like Anthony Sano, are extremely bullish, predicting Ethereum could potentially hit the $10,000 mark within 2024, largely due to its unique staking feature. On the other hand, forecasts from platforms like TradingView and Wallet Investor suggest a range of predictions, from as low as around $1,600 to as high as $10,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin: Some research, like that from the ETC Group, suggests that Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether, might outperform Bitcoin in 2024. This prediction is based on Ethereum\u2019s evolution as a leading smart contract platform and its transition to a deflationary model.\n\nLong-Term Outlook: Looking further ahead, Standard Chartered Bank\u2019s Geoffrey Kendrick sees Ethereum\u2019s price potentially reaching $8,000 by the end of 2026, considering its dominance in smart contract platforms and the development of new use cases.\n\nDiverse Opinions: It\u2019s important to note that there are diverse opinions within the cryptocurrency market. While some are optimistic about Ethereum and, by extension, Ethers.js, others are more cautious, pointing out the unpredictable nature of digital assets.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthers.js is a very important module used in the Web3 landscape. Its API is simple to understand yet very powerful for any developer who wishes to program a crypto-based application.

        "title": "Spot Bitcoin ETF flows show Negative Trend since launch as Ethereum Options out of Sync with Bullish sentiment - Tekedia",
        "content": "The spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) launched by ProShares in October 2021 has seen its first net outflow of funds since its inception, according to data from ETF.com. The fund, which trades under the ticker BITO, had a net outflow of $12.6 million on January 25, 2024, bringing its total assets under management (AUM) to $1.18 billion.\n\nThis marks the first time that BITO has experienced a negative trend in its daily flows, which measure the net amount of money moving in or out of the fund. Since its launch, BITO has attracted significant investor interest, becoming the fastest ETF to reach $1 billion in AUM in just two days.\n\nBITO tracks the price of Bitcoin using futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which are settled in cash and not in actual Bitcoin.\n\nThe negative flow for BITO coincides with a sharp drop in the price of Bitcoin, which fell below $30,000 for the first time since July 2021 on January 25. The cryptocurrency market has been under pressure from regulatory uncertainty, environmental concerns, and competition from other digital assets.\n\nSome analysts have also suggested that the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which allow investors to gain exposure to the actual Bitcoin rather than futures contracts, may have reduced the demand for BITO and other futures-based ETFs.\n\nHowever, not all spot Bitcoin ETFs have fared well either. The Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF), which launched on January 3, 2024, as the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S., has also seen a net outflow of $3.4 million on January 25, bringing its AUM to $69.4 million. The fund, which trades under the ticker BTF, holds Bitcoin in a trust and charges a 0.9% expense ratio.\n\nThe only spot Bitcoin ETF that has seen a positive flow on January 25 is the VanEck Bitcoin Trust (XBTF), which launched on January 5, 2024, as the second spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. The fund, which trades under the ticker XBTF, had a net inflow of $2.7 million on January 25, increasing its AUM to $32.7 million. The fund also holds Bitcoin in a trust and charges a 0.65% expense ratio.\n\nThe performance of the three spot Bitcoin ETFs may indicate that investors are more sensitive to fees and brand recognition when choosing which fund to invest in. VanEck is a well-known name in the ETF industry, having launched several successful funds in the past, such as the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) and the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH). Valkyrie and ProShares are relatively new entrants in the ETF space and may have to compete harder to attract and retain investors.\n\nThe future of Bitcoin ETFs remains uncertain, as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to approve any ETF that directly tracks the price of Bitcoin using physical custody or a decentralized network. The SEC has expressed concerns about the potential for fraud, manipulation, and theft in the Bitcoin market, and has asked for more public input on how to address these issues.\n\nUntil then, investors who want to gain exposure to Bitcoin through an ETF will have to choose between futures-based or trust-based funds, each with their own advantages and disadvantages.\n\nEthereum Options out of Sync with Bullish sentiment\n\nEther, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been on a tear lately, reaching new all-time highs and outperforming bitcoin in terms of percentage gains. However, the options market seems to be lagging behind the bullish momentum, as implied volatility and skew indicators suggest a lack of enthusiasm among traders.\n\nImplied volatility (IV) is a measure of how much the market expects the price of an asset to move in the future. It is derived from the prices of options contracts, which give the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price and date. The higher the IV, the more expensive the options and the greater the expected price fluctuations.\n\nSkew is a measure of how much the options market favors one direction over another. It is calculated by comparing the IV of out-of-the-money (OTM) calls and puts, which are options that have strike prices above or below the current market price, respectively. A positive skew means that OTM calls have higher IV than OTM puts, indicating a higher demand for bullish bets. A negative skew means that OTM puts have higher IV than OTM calls, indicating a higher demand for bearish bets.\n\nAccording to data from Skew, the one-month IV for ether options has dropped to 86%, the lowest level since October 2020. This implies that the options market is not expecting any major price movements in ether in the next 30 days, despite the recent rally and the upcoming launch of Ethereum 2.0, which is expected to improve the network\u2019s scalability and security.\n\nMoreover, the one-month skew for ether options has turned negative, reaching -7%, the lowest level since November 2020. This means that OTM puts are more expensive than OTM calls, indicating a higher demand for downside protection than upside speculation.\n\nThese indicators suggest that ether options traders are either taking profits after the rally, hedging their long positions against a possible correction, or simply waiting for more clarity on the direction of the market. In contrast, spot and futures markets are showing more bullish signs, as ether\u2019s price and open interest continue to climb to new highs.\n\nOne possible explanation for this divergence is that options traders are more cautious and rational than spot and futures traders, who may be driven by emotions and FOMO (fear of missing out). Another possibility is that options traders are underestimating the potential of ether and Ethereum 2.0 and are missing out on a rare opportunity to profit from a paradigm shift in the crypto space.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East raise caution due to potential inflationary impacts. Ethereum anticipates a rebound with the Prague upgrade, eyeing $2500, while ETF approval remains a key catalyst. Presently, Bitcoin is at $42,292.62, up 0.43% in 24 hours, and Ethereum trades at $2,269.14, down 0.47% in 24 hours. Bitcoin's 7-day change is 1.78%, while Ethereum's is -7.59%. Technical indicators for Bitcoin suggest a \"Buy\" sentiment, with at -446.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cThe price of bitcoin rose to $42,220, boosted by praise for BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF, which Rachel Aguirre, BlackRock's US director, hailed as a \"huge success\" and reported a trading volume of $3 billion and capital of $1.6 billion. Although Aguirre denied the Ethereum ETF, he praised BlackRock's foresight. The inflation-adjusted USD weakened 0.1% to 103.41 in the dollar index, signalling a possible Fed rate cut. Bitcoin is currently trading at $42,401 indicating an uptrend with major levels at $43,394 resistance and $40,957 support. Ethereum, trading at $2,289.7, represents bullish momentum above $2,320 and faces resistance at $2,388. Analysts expect further testing of resistance levels, which will provide insight into market dynamics.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cOver the weekend, the overall crypto market has shown positivity. BTC has sustained its position above $42,000 and is now heading towards the $44,400 resistance level. BTC has also successfully reclaimed both the 20EMA Daily and 7EMA Weekly, showcasing a highly bullish last weekly close and implying overall bullishness. ETH, however, closed on a bearish note and is still positioned below the 20EMA Daily. Currently, ETH is in the middle of its range, slightly above $2,275. Key support and resistance levels for ETH are at $2,175 and $2,388, respectively.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "title": "Top Crypto Utility Tokens to Invest in 2024: Ethereum, Decentraland and Scorpion Casino - Tekedia",
        "content": "Your ultimate guide to the best crypto utility tokens to buy in 2024.\n\nAs we venture into 2024, the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, presenting new opportunities for crypto enthusiasts. Among the sea of options, utility tokens stand out for their intrinsic value and use cases within their respective ecosystems. In this context, Ethereum, Decentraland, and the emerging Scorpion Casino are garnering significant attention.\n\nThis article aims to provide an insightful comparison of these tokens, highlighting their unique features and potential for growth, especially focusing on the rising star \u2013 Scorpion Casino.\n\nPresale In Its Final Stages\n\n1. Scorpion Casino \u2013 Revolutionizing iGaming with Crypto\n\nScorpion Casino is quickly carving out a niche in the crypto presale space, especially with its focus on integrating cryptocurrency with the iGaming industry. Its unique model, which allows investors to receive daily USDT rewards based on the casino\u2019s performance, sets it apart from traditional utility tokens. With a presale strategy that\u2019s drawing attention, Scorpion Casino not only promises entertainment but also a potential for substantial returns.\n\n2. Ethereum \u2013 The Pioneer of Smart Contracts\n\nEthereum has long been a cornerstone of the crypto world, renowned for its introduction of smart contracts. These self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code have revolutionized the blockchain landscape. Ethereum\u2019s upcoming upgrades and persistent innovation continue to make it a solid investment choice for those looking to tap into the potential of decentralized applications (DApps) and more.\n\n3. Decentraland \u2013 A Forerunner in Virtual Real Estate\n\nDecentraland represents the intersection of blockchain and virtual reality, offering a decentralized platform for users to buy, sell, and build on virtual land. As the concept of digital real estate and virtual experiences gains traction, Decentraland\u2019s MANA token showcases significant potential, making it an attractive option for investors seeking exposure to the burgeoning field of virtual worlds and metaverses.\n\nWhy Scorpion Casino Stands Out\n\nUnlike traditional utility tokens, Scorpion Casino offers an innovative approach to utility and investment. The platform\u2019s blend of gaming and crypto presale opportunities caters to both entertainment seekers and serious investors. As it gears up for its launch on major exchanges like BitMart, the potential for growth and adoption looks promising.\n\nWhat Utility Token Will You Be Buying?\n\nIn the landscape of top crypto utility tokens for 2024, while Ethereum and Decentraland offer solid opportunities based on their established use cases and market presence, Scorpion Casino emerges as a uniquely enticing option. Its innovative integration of iGaming with cryptocurrency, coupled with the opportunity for daily rewards and a strong presale performance, positions it favorably for investors seeking both excitement and profitability.\n\nFor more information on SCORP, check out the following links;\n\nPresale: https://presale.scorpion.casino/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ScorpionCasino\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/scorpioncasino_official\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

        "content": "Big news in the Polygon zkEVM universe \u2013 the Etrog Upgrade is on the way, and it\u2019s about to turn things upside down (in a good way, of course). Imagine a world where developers can dance between Ethereum and Polygon zkEVM with a simple copy-paste move. Well, that\u2019s what this Type 2 ZK-EVM upgrade is all about \u2013 making life easier for the devs. Let\u2019s check the details of the eagerly anticipated Polygon zkEVM Upgrade and MATIC price.\n\nIn an exciting development, Polygon zkEVM has dropped hints about an upcoming upgrade that promises to redefine the landscape for developers working with smart contracts.\n\n\u2014> CLICK HERE TO BUY MATIC<\u2014\n\nDev Magic: One-Click Compatibility with Ethereum\n\nPicture this: you\u2019ve got your killer code on Ethereum, and now, with the Etrog Upgrade, you can just hit copy and paste it onto Polygon zkEVM. No need to tweak anything \u2013 it\u2019s like a magic wand for developers. Making Polygon zkEVM your coding playground.\n\nThe Etrog upgrade introduces five new pre-compiled smart contracts and brings innovative approaches to processing transaction batches.\n\nAs stated in the announcement, the Etrog upgrade expands support for five precompiled smart contracts: ecAdd, ecMul, ecPairing, Sha256, and modexp. This means that existing decentralized applications (dApps) utilizing these pre-compiles can seamlessly deploy on the network without the need for any modifications.\n\nPolygon emphasizes in the shared note that, once the upgrade goes live, end users can rest easy as no adjustments will be required on their part. All functions within the Polygon zkEVM protocol will continue to operate as usual, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted user experience.\n\n\u2014> CLICK HERE TO BUY MATIC<\u2014\n\nMATIC Price: Etrog\u2019s 10-Day Timelock is a Go\n\nThe Etrog upgrade has set a 10-day timelock in motion. It\u2019s like the final countdown before the grand unveiling of a tech masterpiece.\n\nBefore the big show on the mainnet, devs get a sneak peek on the Cardona testnet. It\u2019s like the backstage pass to ensure everything\u2019s rockin\u2019 before the curtains rise. Cardona, anchored to Sepolia, is where the devs test out the Etrog upgrade.\n\nHow to Connect?: Guide to Cardona\n\nReady to dive into Cardona?

Talk about a wild ride \u2013 it\u2019s got a trading volume of $563.63 million in just 24 hours! This crypto wonderland is worth a whopping $6.39 billion, holding its ground with a 0.39% market dominance. And guess what? MATIC price pulled off a cool 5.15% spike in the last 24 hours.\n\nLet\u2019s rewind a bit. On December 27, 2021, Polygon was hitting an all-time high of $2.91. Fast forward to May 9, 2019 \u2013 rock bottom at $0.003049. But the ride didn\u2019t stop there. Post-peak, the lowest price hit $0.322074, and during a peak moment, MATIC soared to $1.559350.\n\nChecking the vibes, the Polygon price prediction is all neutral with the Fear & Greed Index at a cool 54 (Neutral).\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk tokens. Polygon proudly flaunts 8.01 billion MATIC out of a max supply of 10.00 billion. That\u2019s a flex! It\u2019s killing it as #8 in Proof-of-Stake Coins, #4 in Ethereum (ERC20) Tokens, and the ultimate champ at #1 in the Layer 2 sector.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) paints a compelling narrative with its unwavering green histogram, spelling out a bullish sentiment in the crypto markets. The consistent rise in averages adds another layer of optimism, projecting a sustained uptrend for the MATIC price in the imminent future. Eyes are glued to the support level at $0.7579; should the bulls fortify their position here, an impending challenge of the $0.8268 resistance level seems inevitable.\n\nThe stakes are high as the Polygon token gears up for a potential ascent towards its upper resistance frontier at $0.8893. However, in the unpredictable ebb and flow, if the bears assert dominance, the MATIC price could witness a setback, testing crucial support at $0.7025, and in a more extreme scenario, brace for a plunge towards the lower support echelon at $0.6501. The crypto arena remains a battleground for these contrasting forces, making every move a pivotal chapter in this ongoing saga.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

        "title": "Top 3 Strategic Picks to Capitalize on Bitcoin's Upcoming Halving Event - CryptoDaily",
        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nThe crypto market in 2024 is characterized by a cautious yet optimistic outlook, shaped by significant developments and anticipatory events. The stability observed in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which traded sideways for most of the year, marks a departure from their usual volatility. This period of relative calm was disrupted by a positive upswing in the last quarter of the previous year, signaling a potential shift in market dynamics. The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs and the anticipation of Ethereum ETFs, coupled with the upcoming Bitcoin halving, are key drivers of this optimism. Anticipated events in the crypto world, like Bitcoin's halving, are set to boost market activity and liquidity.\n\nHowever, the market is also marked by a sense of caution. The principle of \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" seems to be in play, suggesting that the positive developments might have already been factored into the market prices. The Bitcoin halving, an event that reduces the reward for mining new bitcoins and is seen as an anti-inflationary measure, is expected to support market prices by limiting supply. In this context, altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Avalanche (AVAX) are emerging as strategic picks for investors seeking high returns ahead of the Bitcoin halving.\n\nRide The Wave Of Innovation With ScapesMania\n\nAs the ScapesMania presale nears its completion in February, the team is working hard to secure a quick listing on popular exchange platforms. There is a good probability that the token's value will increase exponentially after the listing.\n\nThe team behind ScapesMania, with years of expertise, has crafted a robust post-listing marketing strategy. Buyback, burn, staking, and all the perks for holders keep attracting new adopters. Through DAO governance, backers will be able to influence and benefit from a multi-billion-dollar industry.\n\nMoreover, the token's utility is impressive. It's not another meme coin whose success relies heavily on trends and hype. ScapesMania (MANIA) is a well-balanced, meticulously designed project that acts as a gaming ecosystem.\n\nAs the presale is wrapping up, you need to act fast and grab your discounted tokens now! The countdown is on \u2013 don't let this chance pass you by.\n\nPresale is Live Now \u2013 Join Now for a Chance to Benefit with MANIA\n\nScapesMania, a player in the $376 billion gaming industry, leverages the market's growth potential. Post-exchange debut, holders can anticipate greater liquidity and easier trading.\n\nThe community's excitement about the project is evident so far, with $5,000,000+ collected to date from crowd/retail contributions alone. The follower count has reached 60K+ and showcases a weekly growth of 12%.\n\nThe growing interest from crypto whales with checks of $20,000+ might expedite ScapesMania's transition from niche to mainstream.\n\nScapesMania's smart contract has received approval from prominent security-ranking firms, ensuring peace of mind for holders. Additionally, the award-winning team behind ScapesMania secured a prestigious grant from a prominent player in the blockchain industry.\n\nFurthermore, ScapesMania is notable for putting its community front and center.

Be quick if you want to get your hands on those lucrative tokens before they're all gone.\n\nPresale Closing Soon \u2013 Seize Opportunities Now!\n\nEthereum (ETH): A Bullish Outlook Amid Resistance Challenges\n\nEthereum (ETH) has recently exhibited a bullish structure on the weekly chart, with significant resistance levels at $2.4k and $2.6k. The Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETF approval news briefly propelled Ethereum to a local high of $2.7k, but it faced rejection at this level. The weekly market structure remains bullish, with $2.1k being the higher low.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price action suggests that the $2,100-$2,200 range is a key demand zone. The resistance at $2,370 could pose a challenge for Ethereum (ETH) bulls, as this zone has served as a supply zone in the past. The price has shown resilience in bouncing back from the lower end of its range.\n\nThe future of Ethereum (ETH) looks cautiously optimistic. The $2,420-$2,450 area is estimated to have close to $3 billion worth of liquidation levels, with further resistance at higher levels. Swing traders might consider booking profits at these levels. However, the bearish momentum indicated by the RSI could change, and the OBV suggests a balanced strength between buyers and sellers.\n\nSolana (SOL): Rising on Meme Coin Hype and DePIN Market Share\n\nSolana (SOL) has surged recently, joining other well-performing cryptocurrencies. The Solana (SOL) token has risen significantly, reaching its highest point since mid-January. Solana's (SOL) role in the meme coin industry, particularly with the rise of Bonk and Wen tokens, has contributed to its performance.\n\nSolana (SOL) price surge is associated with its growing role in the meme coin industry and its preferred blockchain status for meme coin launches and trading. The Solana (SOL) token formed a long-legged doji pattern (a candlestick with approximately the same opening and closing price) on January 23rd, indicating a potential reversal and remaining above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA).\n\nThe outlook for Solana (SOL) is bullish as it approaches the psychological level of $100. A break above this level could lead to a further surge towards last year's high of $126, representing a 27% increase from the current level. However, the reliance on the volatile meme coin market and the DePIN sector could introduce unpredictability.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX): A Sudden Surge in Market Performance\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) has recently witnessed a 10% jump in its price over the last week, making it one of the top gainers among the leading cryptocurrencies by market cap. This surge has brought Avalanche (AVAX) to a 10-day high of $36, accompanied by a 34% spike in daily trading volumes. This rebound has raised expectations for a more sustained rise in Avalanche (AVAX) price, especially considering the selling pressure it faced since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe recent price surge in Avalanche (AVAX) could be linked to increased activity on an Avalanche-based decentralized social app, The Arena. As Avalanche (AVAX) is the utility token of The Arena, its value is closely tied to the app's success. Additionally, the Open Interest (OI) in Avalanche (AVAX) futures has seen a significant 20% jump, suggesting heightened interest in the futures market.\n\nThe immediate outlook for Avalanche (AVAX) appears bullish, with increased demand in the futures market and the rising popularity of The Arena app. However, the reliance on a single decentralized application for its surge poses a risk. The sustainability of Avalanche (AVAX) price rise will depend on the continued success and adoption of The Arena and similar projects on the Avalanche network. While the short-term prospects seem promising, the long-term stability of Avalanche (AVAX) price will hinge on broader market adoption and the platform's ability to maintain its momentum in the decentralized application space.\n\nConclusion\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, the crypto world is buzzing with a careful kind of hope, as recent breakthroughs steer the mood of those putting their money on the line. The stability in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, coupled with the positive upswing in the last quarter of the previous year, indicates a potential shift in market dynamics. Excitement's building up with Bitcoin spot ETFs getting the green light, people are buzzing about Ethereum ETFs on the horizon, and the Bitcoin halving event is just around the corner. These events are all expected to pump up trading action and cashflow. However, the market is also tempered by caution, with the \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d sentiment suggesting that these developments might already be reflected in current prices. In this environment, Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Avalanche (AVAX) emerge as strategic picks for investors seeking high returns ahead of the Bitcoin halving.\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Luno, a regulated digital asset exchange in Malaysia, has recently introduced Ethereum (ETH) staking, offering an opportunity for customers to earn ETH rewards on a weekly basis. This initiative positions Luno as the first regulated exchange in the country to provide such a feature.\n\nScarlett Chai, Luno\u2019s Country Manager for Malaysia, commented on the launch, stating,\n\n\u201cAt Luno, we\u2019re on a mission to improve our product continuously and we\u2019re thrilled to be the first regulated exchange to bring Staking to our Malaysian customers.\u201d \u201cBy adding staking, we are giving customers the opportunity to explore more of what crypto has to offer,\u201d\n\nshe added.\n\nThe Luno staking feature, currently supporting Ethereum, allows users to earn up to 4% per year in ETH, with the rate subject to fluctuations based on network demand and validator activity.\n\nStaking in the cryptocurrency domain is a process that contributes to transaction verification, especially in systems that use a proof of stake mechanism, such as Ethereum. By staking their crypto, users see an increment in their holdings through rewards, although these staked coins are locked from selling or transferring until they decide to \u201cunstake.\u201d\n\nThe staking process is designed to be user-friendly, with a minimum deposit requirement of 0.00001 ETH or RM1, appealing to those who plan to hold ETH long-term.\n\nLuno offers up to 4% annual rewards on staked Ethereum, although the exchange says this figure can vary with network conditions. The staking service is accessible to a wide audience, requiring a minimal investment and no technical expertise, but it does include a fee deducted from the rewards.\n\nScarlett further advised customers to exercise due diligence and informed decision-making in cryptocurrency investments.\n\nFollowing South Africa, Malaysia is the second market where Luno has introduced staking for its clients. Luno also plans to launch staking for Cardano (ADA) soon, expanding its staking options for customers.\n\nFeatured image credit: Edited from Luno"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Could Plunge Below $1000 In Coming Months, Warns Crypto Analyst Benjamin Cowen - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "In a recent video, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen discussed several key points regarding Ethereum (ETH) and its potential future movements, particularly in relation to Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nHere are the main highlights:\n\nEthereum\u2019s Performance Relative to Bitcoin: Cowen notes that the future direction of Ethereum (ETH) is closely tied to its performance relative to Bitcoin. He points out that if Bitcoin were to experience a significant bounce, it would likely impact Ethereum\u2019s value in USD. However, a key factor to watch is how Ethereum performs against Bitcoin during this period. Historical Price Patterns of Ethereum: Cowen references past cycles to speculate on Ethereum\u2019s potential future movements. He observes that Ethereum has historically followed a pattern of forming a low, then higher lows, before eventually breaking down. This pattern suggests that Ethereum might test the integrity of its previous lows before potentially experiencing a larger drop. Implications of Ethereum-Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) Pair: According to Cowen, the ETH/BTC pair is critical in determining Ethereum\u2019s future. He suggests that if this pair breaks down, it would precede a significant drop in Ethereum\u2019s USD value. This pattern has been observed in previous cycles where a breakdown in the ETH/BTC pair led to substantial corrections in Ethereum\u2019s USD value. Testing of Previous Lows: Cowen speculates that Ethereum will likely test its previous lows below $1,000, but this might not happen until after the ETH/BTC pair breaks down. He emphasizes the historical tendency of Ethereum to retest its low points before any substantial recovery or further decline. Possible Scenarios for Ethereum\u2019s Movement: Cowen discusses various scenarios for Ethereum\u2019s movement in the coming months. He considers the possibility of Ethereum experiencing a slow bleed in value or receiving one more significant push higher, similar to a past movement that saw a substantial increase in its value. Influence of Bitcoin\u2019s Movements: Cowen argues that any significant upward movement in Ethereum\u2019s value is contingent on Bitcoin experiencing a bounce first. He stresses that Ethereum\u2019s future movements are heavily influenced by Bitcoin\u2019s market behavior. Uncertainty and Market Dynamics: Cowen acknowledges the uncertainty in these predictions, highlighting the complexity of market dynamics and the influence of various narratives, such as those around the Ethereum spot ETF and Bitcoin halving.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $2,257, down 0.33% in the past 24-hour period.\n\nFeatured Image via Pixabay"

        "content": "The past week saw Bitcoin (BTC) rebounding and reclaiming a pivotal $42,000 level, while Ethereum (ETH) experienced a modest uptick in its price. However, the real stars of the week were several altcoins, with Manta Network (MANTA) leading the pack, followed by Sui (SUI) and Conflux (CFX), showcasing impressive gains in the top 90 cryptocurrencies.\n\nManta Network (MANTA) stole the spotlight with an astounding 50% surge over the week, reaching a peak of $3.83. Presently, MANTA is trading at $3.66, exhibiting robust performance with a 0.80% increase in the last 24 hours.\n\nManta Network (MANTA) 7-Day Chart | Source: CoinMarketcap\n\nSui (SUI) also made waves, achieving a 35% gain during the week.

The current value of this moving average is $30,358, and despite its steady increase, Bitcoin\u2019s price has not come close to testing this crucial support.\n\nSource: X\n\nHowever, long-term data observations, including the 2019 example, suggest caution regarding claims that the market has hit its low. CryptoCon\u2019s estimate anticipates a move to the low $30K region by February or March.\n\nAs of now, Bitcoin is priced at $42,007, with a 24-hour trading volume of $20.35 billion and a market cap of $823.85 billion. In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin experienced a 1.19% decrease, while the weekly chart shows a 3% increase.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) 7-Day Chart | Source: CoinMarketcap\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) has shown signs of recovery, particularly around the $2200 level. Notable long-tail rejection candles on its daily chart suggest a decrease in bearish momentum. This positive shift coincides with Bitcoin stabilizing above $40,000 and a broader uptick in the altcoin markets, sparking a new relief rally.\n\nOver the recent fortnight, Ethereum experienced a significant correction, dropping from $2714 to a low of $2168, marking a 20% decrease. During this pullback, the coin price broke below the channel pattern\u2019s support trendline, which had supported a recovery rally for nearly three months.\n\nAs of now, Ethereum is priced at $2,284.43, with a 24-hour trading volume of $7.00 billion and a market cap of $274.55 billion. In the last 24 hours, Ethereum experienced a 0.98% decrease.\n\nEthereum (ETH) 7-Day Chart | Source: CoinMarketcap\n\nHowever, Ethereum demonstrated resilience around the $2200 mark, reclaiming the breached support trendline and triggering additional buying orders in the market. The reversal marked the prior downfall as a \u2018Bear Trap,\u2019 with evidence of considerable short liquidation.\n\nLooking ahead, Ethereum\u2019s ability to maintain its position above the reclaimed support at $2200 is crucial. If successful, it could initiate a 6.85% relief rally, aiming for the $2430 level.\n\nHowever, a significant obstacle lies at this immediate resistance level, corresponding to the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the recent correction. To continue its upward trajectory and potentially retest the $2700 mark, Ethereum must break above this critical barrier, gaining further momentum in the process.\n\nRelated Reading | RippleX Engineer Proposes Bold Overhaul for XRPL Foundation Governance"

        "title": "Ethereum has a better alternative and it's just $0.09 Now - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, innovation and progress are constant companions. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has long been a dominant force in the blockchain space. However, competition and advancement within the crypto industry have led to the emergence of alternatives that challenge Ethereum\u2019s supremacy. One such compelling alternative is Retik Finance (RETIK), and what makes it even more enticing is its incredibly affordable price tag of just $0.09. In this article, we\u2019ll delve into the world of Retik Finance, exploring its features, current status, and why it stands as a promising Ethereum alternative.\n\nRetik Finance: A Closer Look\n\nRetik Finance is not just any cryptocurrency; it represents a new generation of decentralised finance (DeFi) platforms designed to revolutionise the way we think about traditional financial systems. At its core, Retik Finance aims to bridge the gap between digital and fiat finance, providing users with a seamless and efficient platform for conducting financial transactions.\n\nBut what sets Retik Finance apart from its competitors, and why is it being hailed as an Ethereum alternative?\n\n1. Innovative Ecosystem: Retik Finance has created a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem that goes beyond the typical offerings of many cryptocurrencies. This ecosystem includes the Retik Wallet, DeFi Debit Cards, and Retik Pay, all of which are designed to enhance the user experience by facilitating easy and secure transactions. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, Retik Finance aims to address the shortcomings of traditional financial systems.\n\n2. The $RETIK Token: At the heart of Retik Finance\u2019s ecosystem lies the $RETIK token, a digital currency that serves as the lifeblood of the platform. However, its utility extends beyond the Retik Finance ecosystem, making it a versatile and attractive investment option for crypto enthusiasts. With a limited supply and growing demand, the $RETIK token has the potential for significant price appreciation.\n\n3. Strong Community Support: Like any successful cryptocurrency, Retik Finance has garnered a dedicated community of supporters who believe in its vision. Community engagement and support are crucial in the crypto world, and Retik Finance has demonstrated its ability to rally enthusiasts around its cause.\n\nRetik Finance: Current Status\n\nAs of the time of writing, Retik Finance finds itself in an exciting stage of its development: Retik Presale Stage 7. During this stage, one RETIK token is priced at a mere $0.09, making it incredibly accessible to a wide range of investors. However, the affordability of RETIK does not diminish its potential; quite the opposite.The Retik Presale Stage 7 is 84.57% filled, indicating strong interest and demand within the crypto community. This level of participation underscores the project\u2019s viability and the belief that RETIK Finance has something valuable to offer. In terms of fundraising, the stage has raised an impressive $13,537,209 out of the $17,200,000 target, indicating that there is substantial backing for the project.In terms of token availability, 224,120,023 RETIK tokens have already been sold during this stage, out of a total supply of 265,000,000. This indicates that there is still room for interested investors to participate in the presale and secure their RETIK tokens at the current attractive price.\n\nWhy RETIK Finance Stands Out\n\n1. Affordability: One of the most striking aspects of RETIK Finance is its affordability. With each token priced at just $0.09 during the Retik Presale Stage 7, it opens the door for a broad spectrum of investors, from newcomers to seasoned traders. This accessibility is a stark contrast to Ethereum, which has seen its price rise significantly over the years, potentially pricing out some prospective investors.\n\n2. Innovation: RETIK Finance\u2019s innovative approach to DeFi and its comprehensive ecosystem set it apart from many other cryptocurrencies. While Ethereum laid the foundation for smart contracts and dApps, RETIK Finance takes these concepts to the next level by offering a complete financial solution that can seamlessly integrate with traditional finance.\n\n3. Growing Community: The enthusiastic and growing community supporting RETIK Finance bodes well for its future. A strong and engaged user base can contribute significantly to a project\u2019s success, and RETIK Finance has managed to cultivate just that.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum has long been a frontrunner in the cryptocurrency space, but the emergence of alternatives like Retik Finance (RETIK) is a testament to the dynamism and innovation of the crypto industry. With its affordable price of $0.09 during the Retik Presale Stage 7, Retik Finance offers accessibility and potential that could rival Ethereum.As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, it\u2019s essential to keep an eye on projects like RETIK Finance that bring fresh ideas and solutions to the table. While Ethereum has its merits, the allure of an Ethereum alternative that combines affordability, innovation, and a growing community cannot be ignored. As the crypto journey unfolds, RETIK Finance is a name to watch, and its current status in the Retik Presale Stage 7 only adds to its appeal as a promising Ethereum alternative.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance Presale\n\nVisit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):\n\nWebsite: https://retik.com\n\nWhitepaper: https://retik.com/retik-whitepaper.pdf\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/retikfinance"

        "content": "ChatGPT has picked the three best altcoins that every investor should have as we get closer to the upcoming bull market. The three coins are Celestia, Pullix, and Ethereum Classic. Let us see what ChatGPT has to say about these coins.\n\nCelestia (TIA) Price Forecast\n\nIn October 2023, Celestia (TIA) launched after an airdrop. Ever since, it has lived up to its name, setting multiple all-time highs (ATHs) with an astounding 800% rise. With a spike of more than 9% over the past 30 days, the token has been among the best-performing digital assets.\n\nOn the monthly price chart, the altcoin is currently fluctuating between $10.91 and $20.26. ChatGPT has forecast further growth for Celestia in the future despite the recent price retracement.\n\nThe Celestia blockchain, in ChatGPT\u2019s opinion, has enormous potential and will propel the token to new heights. In the upcoming months, a climb to $40.16 has been anticipated by ChatGPT.\n\nPullix (PLX): ChatGPT Anticipate 280% Gain in the Presale Stage\n\nPullix (PLX), which is still in the pre-sales stage, is a trading platform that will allow users to trade various assets, including equities, commodities, and derivatives. Additionally, Pullix has carved out a niche for itself in the DeFi market as it facilitates OTC futures trading with cryptocurrency collateral.\n\nThe platform\u2019s transactions will be conducted using the ERC20 token PLX. Through trade execution and trading, users would receive incentives in PLX. But, the revenue-sharing concept of the PLX token is what sets it apart from the competition. Pullix is the pioneering exchange that offers token holders a chance to share in its earnings.\n\nUsers can also earn continuing pass income by providing liquidity to our automated market makers. This is a significant advancement for the DeFi market since Pullix offers a stable revenue guarantee together with the ability for users to trade and earn incentives.\n\nThe trading process has been made simpler by this platform. The platform\u2019s straightforward and user-friendly design eliminates the need for technical understanding among traders. In Q1 2024, Pullix intends to launch the platform. For $PLX, ChatGPT projects a 25x growth at launch and a 280% increase in presale from its current price of $0.10. Consideration of Pullix\u2019s ERC20 token is therefore warranted.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETH): ChatGPT Gives Bullish Forecast\n\nEthereum Classic (ETH), one of the top 30 cryptocurrencies in the market, has been fluctuating between Low $18.50 and $32.36 in the past month.\n\nThe altcoin is trading at 4725.31%, away from its all-time low of $0.4524. While Ethereum has recently moved to the Proof of Stake concept, Ethereum Classic remains a PoW token.\n\nCompared to Ethereum, Ethereum Classic is bullish on the 14-day and 30-day price charts, with gains of 13.0% and 5.8%. ChatGPT\u2019s Ethereum Classic price prediction predicts that Ethereum Classic will rise by 10.32% to $24.55 in the coming months.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nCelestia, Pullix and Ethereum Classic are some of the best altcoins in the market today, as per ChatGPT. ChatGPT has chosen them because of their unique features and possible price hikes in months ahead.\n\nFor more information regarding Pullix\u2019s presale see links below:\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities\n\n."

        "content": "Ethereum will test the Dencun update on the Sepolia and Holesky networks on Jan. 30 and Feb. 7.\n\nDencun, a crucial \u201chard fork\u201d for Ethereum, aims to reduce transaction and data costs, with release expected in late February or early March.\n\nEthereum developers have set a timeline for the latest updates to the \u2018Dencun\u2019 testnet. Trials of Dencun will be conducted on the Sepolia and Holesky test networks on January 30 and February 7, respectively, which puts the update on track to reach the main network in late February or early March.\n\nIt is known so far that a group of Ethereum developers, who are planning the blockchain\u2019s biggest upgrade in a year, known as Dencun, have confirmed in a blog post the dates for making the changes on two key test networks, which are theoretically the last steps before going live on the mainnet .\n\nDencun is a major upgrade or \u201chard fork\u201d planned for the Ethereum blockchain that will enable \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d a technical feature that will lower the cost of transactions on Layer 2, as well as make data available on the blockchain cheaper.\n\nBefore it goes live on the main blockchain, developers will conduct a dress rehearsal of the protocol changes on the Sepolia and Holesky test networks on Jan. 30 and Feb. 7.\n\nThe announcement follows the upgrade that took place last week on the Goerli testnet, which was successfully activated despite some minor hiccups. Dencun will go live on Sepolia at 22:51 UTC and epoch 132608. If all goes according to plan, the final test for Dencun will take place at Holesky on February 7 at 11:34 UTC, epoch 950272.\n\nAfter that, the developers will set a date for Dencun to hit the Ethereum mainnet, which is now targeted for late February or early March.\n\n."

        "content": "In the past week, Ethereum (ETH) and Avalanche (AVAX) experienced losses, with each dropping in price by at least 7%. This caused investors to suffer huge losses.\n\nHowever, the focus is on (a new crypto) Algotech (ALGT), as investors seek huge investment returns. This new crypto has what it takes as it successfully raised 1.1 million in just two days of its private seed sale. It is the best crypto to invest in right now.\n\nTLDR\n\nAlgotech (ALGT) tipped for 275% ROI post presale.\n\npost presale. Currently, Ethereum (ETH) is on a downward trend.\n\nOver the past 30 days, Avalanche (AVAX) has had 11/30 green days.\n\nAlgotech (ALGT) Tipped for 275% ROI Post-Presale\n\nAlgotech (ALGT) has been rated ahead of other established altcoins, and for those wondering what Algotech is all about, Algotech (ALGT) is a decentralized algorithm trading platform that aims to revolutionize crypto trading.\n\nWith the help of sophisticated technologies, such as machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI), Algotech (ALGT) builds an automated system that offers profitable and efficient crypto trading experiences.\n\nAlgotech (ALGT) takes pride in its sophisticated technical framework, which supports multiple algorithms for handling high-frequency trading and large trades.\n\nFurthermore, Algotech ALGT will optimize accurate data from reliable sources such as market data aggregators and integrations with data providers. This will help traders make informed decisions.\n\nAlgotech (ALGT) has grown in popularity and earned investors\u2019 confidence after its private sale raised $1.1 million in two days. With its innovative approach towards algorithm trading and excellent features, Algotech (ALGT) is considered the best cryptocurrency to invest in.\n\nInvestors who are interested in this decentralized algorithm trading and investment platform can participate in the public presale.\n\nCurrently, the presale is in Stage 1. Also, investors can get 275% gains when the project launches. Furthermore, investors participating in the presale can own part of Algotech (ALGT) software and earn voting rights.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: How High Can Ethereum Go?\n\nOver the past 30 days, Ethereum (ETH) has had 12/30 days (40%) and a price volatility of 5.08%. Ethereum also has a Fear & Greed Index score of 50, indicating Neutral.\n\nCurrently, the Ethereum (ETH) price is on a downward trend; however, some on-chain indicators suggest that it could begin a recovery. However, we can\u2019t tell if ETH is the best crypto to buy right now.\n\nEthereum\u2019s (ETH) bullish trend should continue this 2024, as one global adoption increases and more Ethereum-related financial services are introduced. In 2024, an expert Ethereum price prediction revealed that ETH could have a minimum and maximum price of $2,205.19 and $2,367.73, respectively.\n\nOver the past week, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price has fluctuated between $2,300 and $2,400. By July 2024, our Ethereum price prediction reveals a minimum and maximum value of $1,931.30 and $2,402.88 respectively.\n\nAVAX Price Prediction: Is Avalanche (AVAX) a Good Crypto To Buy This Year?\n\nRecently, the AVAX price gained value at a period when the crypto market fell. Its increased trading volumes & higher staking yields pushed the AVAX price to its highest since May 2022. However, Avalanche (AVAX) has been on a decline recently.\n\nThe fall in AVAX price can be attributed partly to fewer people utilizing Avalanche\u2019s C-Chain. Over the past 30 days, Avalanche has had 11/30 green days (37%) and a price volatility of 11.02%.\n\nAn Avalanche (AVAX) price prediction for June 2024 reveals a minimum and maximum price of $28.96 and $30.37, respectively, while Avalanche\u2019s expected peak value could be $31.77.\n\nExperts are optimistic about this Avalanche (AVAX) price prediction.

        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation\u2019s network developers recently unveiled a major announcement regarding the deployment schedule for the highly anticipated Dencun upgrade on the Sepolia and Holesky test nets.\n\nThe upgrade will enable additional functionalities on the Sepolia and Holesky test nets and pave the way for the successful deployment of Dencun; consequently, this significant milestone generated considerable speculation.\n\nIt is noteworthy to remark that the preliminary trials were conducted on Goerli on January 17. Before the official release and announcement of roadmap, Dencun must be implemented into the initial testnet to validate its robustness and guarantee a smooth transition to a new version of Ethereum.\n\nThe execution represents a significant progression from the initial testing phase to the practical deployment. Users and developers of Ethereum have been anticipating this final deployment with great anticipation, as it is considered to signify the start of a novel era for Layer 1 Blockchain networks focused on smart contracts.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation blog post describes Dencun, which includes modifications to the consensus and execution layers of the Ethereum blockchain network. The upgrade will encompass several significant modifications, including the EIP-4844 for Shard Blob Transactions. This will contribute to the reduction of Layer 2 transaction fees.\n\nAdditional significant enhancements consist of EIP-1153 for transient storage opcodes and EIP 4788, which implements a beacon block root in the EVM. This Dencun upgrade seeks to increase the flexibility and usability of the Ethereum blockchain network across industries by decreasing transaction fees and accelerating transaction speeds, thereby enhancing the accessibility and usability of the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nFor non-staking Sepolia/Holesky node operators, users will need to update their node\u2019s consensus layer and execution clients to the version listed on the official website. Stakers who wish to run through the Dencun upgrade process before the launch of the mainnet can use https://ephemery.dev/, which supports Dencun.\n\nThe integration of Dencun is, therefore, massive in terms of increased use and accessibility to the Ethereum blockchain due to the radical reduction of transaction costs, which will also certainly stimulate the introduction of more layer two innovations."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) have long been established cryptocurrencies. Ethereum (ETH) is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, while Bitcoin Cash forked from the original Bitcoin ledger in its vision to create a decentralized P2P electronic cash equivalent. While ETH and BCH look like good value to appreciate, their respective large market capitalizations severely limit the potential ROI investors can generate.\n\nPresale crypto investment opportunities, on the other hand, offer a greater chance of the mythical 50x to 100x gain because of their low capitalizations and higher price ceilings. In 2024, one of the leading projects currently in presale is Pushd (PUSHD), which has already attracted 23,000 signups entering stage 4 of its presale. Here\u2019s why market analysts believe Pushd (PUSHD) could generate a higher ROI than Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) this year.\n\nEthereum (ETH) SEC Decision Postponed\n\nThe United States SEC has delayed its decision on approving BlackRock and Fidelity\u2019s spot Ethereum (ETH) ETFs to March. While the SEC has already greenlit spot Bitcoin ETFs, the treatment of Ethereum ETF applications is still unclear. Speculation behind an Ethereum (ETH) ETF could play a role in Ethereum (ETH) prices rising in the future. Currently, Ethereum (ETH) trades at $2,271 as of this writing.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) Bounces Back\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) markets itself as the premier P2P electronic cash system, or what its founders believe was the original vision of Bitcoin (BTC). BCH lends itself better for payments because of its larger block size, which supports microtransactions at minimal fees. While Bitcoin Cash (BCH) dropped to $223 in the past 5 days of trading, it has since bounced back nicely to $243 as of this writing.\n\nPushd (PUSHD) Presale Expected to Deliver Big Gains in 2024\n\nPushd (PUSHD) is a newly launched decentralized online marketplace that has generated a lot of buzz behind its presale launch. Entering stage 4, with PUSHD token prices available at $0.075, Pushd (PUSHD) has already onboarded 23,000+ interested participants. Market analysts believe\n\nPushd (PUSHD) could go on a massive run in 2024, with the Bitcoin halving expected to trigger a market-wide bull run. Pushd (PUSHD) is the rare low-cap gem in its presale phase that offers presale investors a unique opportunity to be at the very beginning of a project before it skyrockets in price and prominence. It is for this reason that market analysts predict Pushd (PUSHD) could deliver greater ROIs than Ethereum (ETH) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH) in 2024. A 900% gain is well within reach for Pushd (PUSHD) in 2024\u2014gains that BCH or ETH aren\u2019t expected to generate within the same time frame.\n\nPushd (PUSHD) is creating the first decentralized alternative to eCommerce platforms like Amazon and eBay\u2014without their high fees, KYC requirements, and slow transaction processing times. Pushd ensured a safe and fair launch by getting its smart contract audit and implementing a 700-day team token lock and 20-year platform liquidity lock to ensure funds are and will always be safe. Don\u2019t miss out on what market analysts predict could be the presale investment opportunity of 2024 with Pushd.\n\nFind out more about the Pushd presale at their official website.\n\nDisclaimer: Any information written in this press release or sponsored post does not constitute investment advice.

        "content": "In a significant development in decentralized finance (DeFi), Solana\u2019s Jupiter-based decentralized exchange (DEX) has recently outperformed Ethereum\u2018s leading DEX, Uniswap, in a key metric.\n\nAccording to data from CoinGecko, Jupiter DEX recorded over $510 million in trading volume in the last 24 hours, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s Uniswap V3 and V2, which recorded $455 million and $76 million, respectively.\n\nWEN airdrop fuels Solana ecosystem\n\nThe surge in trading volume on Jupiter DEX is attributed, in part, to the recent WEN airdrop that occurred on its launchpad. This airdrop injected new capital into the Solana ecosystem, particularly benefiting Jupiter.\n\nThe WEN airdrop has bolstered Jupiter\u2019s performance and underscores a growing trend in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, where the Solana network is increasingly competing with Ethereum.\n\nData from DeFiLlama reveals that beyond Jupiter\u2019s impressive performance, the Solana network is on par with Ethereum regarding trading volume. Over the last 24 hours, Solana recorded a trading volume of $704 million, compared to Ethereum\u2019s $741 million. This signifies a remarkable convergence in trading activity between the two networks.\n\nSolana\u2019s recent achievements\n\nDecember 2023 marked a significant milestone for Solana, surpassing Ethereum in 7-day DEX volume for the first time in history. Data from The Block also indicates that Solana outperformed Ethereum regarding non-fungible token (NFT) trading volume during the same period.\n\nWhile Ethereum has long been the home of leading decentralized applications (dApps) and has dominated the DeFi landscape, Solana\u2019s consistent growth is beginning to challenge that status quo.\n\nOne of Solana\u2019s key advantages over Ethereum is its speed and cost-effectiveness. Ethereum\u2019s gas fees have been a persistent concern for users, hindering the mainstream adoption of decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\nThe rising popularity of Solana is attributed to its ability to offer faster and more cost-effective transactions. This has attracted more liquidity to the Solana network, making it an enticing option for DeFi users.\n\nThe upcoming JUP airdrop\n\nThe momentum in Solana\u2019s favor is expected to intensify with the upcoming JUP airdrop scheduled for January 31st. This highly-anticipated event is poised to draw significant attention and trading activity to Jupiter and the Solana network.\n\nEligible airdrop recipients are likely to diversify their holdings within the SOL ecosystem. In contrast, those who missed the WEN airdrop may seek opportunities in other Solana-based DeFi projects, hoping to become eligible for future native token distributions."

        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nSolana (SOL) was one of the best cryptos to invest in last year, delivering investors over 300% returns. Its prices have dropped considerably since the start of 2024, going from a high of $125 set on Christmas Day to its current price of $86.\n\nHowever, strong support was found at $76 and strong bull patterns have been forming on price charts ever since. A prominent trader who goes by the nickname Bluntz Capital predicts prices will surge by 40% soon.\n\nMeanwhile, an increasing number of Ethereum (ETH) whales are gravitating toward one of the best DeFi altcoins launched on its network: InQubeta (QUBE).\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause InQubeta is on course to earn investors substantially more profits as it opens access to artificial intelligence (AI) investments to people who don\u2019t meet the requisites of traditional avenues and those who don\u2019t have access to them.\n\nQUBE, InQubeta\u2019s governance and native token, has outperformed ETH in the past twelve months, earning investors 220% returns, while ETH only delivered 37% returns to its investors.\n\nAnalysts project InQubeta (QUBE) will be more profitable than investing in BTC ETFs or ETH\n\nThe artificial intelligence industry has passed major milestones in the past couple of decades, taking the technology from a fancy science fiction concept to a reality. Self-driving taxis now exist and humanoid robots are closer than ever to replacing human laborers. InQubeta aims to democratize access to investing in the AI startups that are pushing these changes.\n\nTraditional investing channels usually have income or net worth requirements that disqualify a large portion of the global population from using their services, but InQubeta uses a crowdfunding approach where everyone is welcome.\n\nAI investments have surged considerably in the past several years, from a mere $12 billion in 2015 to more than $120 billion at present. That figure is anticipated to exceed $1.5 trillion by 2030. InQubeta is the first DeFi crypto coin to focus on making AI investments easier to access, which sets it up for exponential growth as it connects AI startups with financiers.\n\nHere\u2019s how the decentralized investment ecosystem works:\n\nAI startups that are eligible to raise capital on the network create ERC20 coins that offer rewards or equity. Rewards might be in the form of discounts on products created or a share of profits made\n\nthat offer rewards or equity. Rewards might be in the form of discounts on products created or a share of profits made ERC20 coins , non-fungible tokens, are split into thousands of smaller pieces that are more affordable for most investors\n\n, non-fungible tokens, are split into thousands of smaller pieces that are more affordable for most investors Investors are provided resources that include information on the different companies seeking capital and expert opinions. They finance companies they find promising with QUBE\n\nThey can resell any tokens they purchase on the marketplace at any time of their choosing\n\nSolana (SOL) prices poised for 40% surge\n\nSOL prices have come down quite a bit since they broke the $125 resistance level, but analysts like Bluntz Capital expect prices to rebound soon. Solana was one of the best DeFi coins in 2023, and it emerged as the Ethereum network\u2019s main competitor after its market cap surpassed rivals like Cardano (ADA).\n\nSolana\u2019s exponential growth has been attributed to its consistent efforts to expand the services it offers and its growing user base. SOL tokens are probably as cheap as they\u2019re going to be right now.\n\nThe improvements made to the Solana blockchain in 2023 earned attention from notable personalities in the investing space, including Franklin Templeton CEO, Jenny Johnson.\n\nSummary\n\nQUBE and SOL are two of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in today. SOL appears poised to surge and it could grow as much as 3x this year. QUBE is set for 37.5% more growth before tokens are released on exchanges, and some projections expect prices to surge as much as 10,000% afterward.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities\n\n*This article was paid for.
