        "title": "Ethereum Is Turning Deflationary, But Price Remains Stagnant - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "According to Ultra Sound Money data, as of August 7, the Ethereum (ETH) network has burned over half the coins issued since the merge. Around 6.5 million ETH coins have been issued since the merge, and over 3.5 million of them have been burned.\n\nEthereum currently has a supply of about 120.2 million coins. And since the model is still inflationary, more coins are added every year. As of now, the network adds about 580,000 ETH each year. However, the Ethereum network burns about 1.75 million ETH each year, lowering the supply by roughly 0.98%. This makes the platform somewhat deflationary because the circulating ETH amount reduces as coins get actively burned on the network.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum: These ETH Futures ETFs Are Awaiting Approval\n\nPresently, gas fees generated by ETH transfers and smart contract operations are the main drivers of these burns. Additionally, NFT and DeFi platforms like OpenSea and UniSwap, also play a role. Additionally, the transfer of USDT, an ERC-20 token on the ETH network, also adds to ETH burns.\n\nWill Ethereum prices react to the burns?\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nSo far, ETH\u2019s prices have not heavily responded to the burns. This could be because of less demand as of now. Burns without demand will do little to push the asset\u2019s price. However, the project\u2019s end goal is for the burn rate to outpace the rate of issuing new coins. This would effectively turn Ethereum (ETH) deflationary.\n\nAlso Read: How To Check An Ethereum Transaction?\n\nMoreover, many argue that ETH has become more deflationary than Bitcoin (BTC) after the implementation of the EIP-1559 protocol. This protocol is responsible for burning a fraction of the gas fee from each transaction. However, ETH does not have a fixed cap on its supply, unlike BTC which is capped at 21 million coins. Therefore, ETH\u2019s burn rate will have to outpace its issuance in order for it to be truly considered a deflationary asset. At press time, Ethereum was trading at $1,833.89, down by 0.2% in the last 24 hours."

        "content": "PayPal is rolling out a new dollar-backed stablecoin.\n\nThe stablecoin, issued by Paxos Trust Co, was detailed in a statement published Monday morning by the American payments giant.\n\nPayPal announced that customers who purchase PayPal USD will be able to transfer the stablecoin between \u201ccompatible external wallets\u201d and PayPal. They will also be able to fund purchases with PayPal USD.\n\nThe stablecoin will be available starting Monday, and PayPal customers will be able to purchase, send, convert and fund purchases in the \u201ccoming weeks.\u201d\n\nThe announcement marks the first time that a major US financial company has created a stablecoin. PayPal\u2019s leadership confirmed the existence of the project in early 2022. PayPal began integrating crypto services in early 2021, allowing users to buy, sell and hold major digital assets like bitcoin and ether.\n\n\u201cThe shift toward digital currencies requires a stable instrument that is both digitally native and easily connected to fiat currency like the U.S. dollar,\u201d said Dan Schulman, PayPal\u2019s president and CEO.\n\nPaxos will be in charge of publishing a monthly Reserve Report on the stablecoin, as well as an \u201cattestation of the value of PayPal USD reserve assets.\u201d PayPal said the stablecoin will be \u201cfully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, US Treasuries and similar cash equivalents.\u201d\n\n\u201cPayPal USD is the most significant leap forward for digital assets and the financial industry and Paxos is proud to enable this transformative product,\u201d Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla said in a statement.\n\nA blockchain-based digital asset, PayPal USD will be issued on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token.\n\n\u201cOur commitment to responsible innovation and compliance, and our track record delivering new experiences to our customers, provides the foundation necessary to contribute to the growth of digital payments through PayPal USD,\u201d said Schulman.\n\n\u201cClear regulations and robust consumer protections are essential to enabling stablecoins to achieve their full potential. That\u2019s why it\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d chair of the House Financial Services Committee Patrick McHenry said in a statement.\n\nThis announcement comes a few months after PayPal enabled crypto purchases for Venmo users.\n\nUpdated Aug. 7, 2023 at 11:40 am ET: Added statement from House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry.\n\nUpdated Aug. 7, 2023 at 9:45 am ET: Added statement from Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "More than 10,000 new stakers joined Lido (LDO) in July, according to the latest report from the liquid staking protocol, indicating its continued adoption and growth despite the current market situation.\n\nIn July, Lido\u2019s TVL briefly exceeded $15 billion for the first time since May 2022 but fell below the benchmark due to Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price struggles.\n\nOver the preceding month, the value of Ether underwent a modest decline of approximately 3% to $1,815 as of press time, according to CryptoSlate\u2019s data. This price correction emerged as the initial enthusiasm within the crypto market, fueled by a bullish streak in June primarily driven by institutional investors, gradually subsided.\n\nEven though Lido\u2019s TVL experienced a decline from its impressive $15 billion benchmark, it retains its position as the foremost DeFi protocol. Notably, Lido continues to command a substantial 36% share of the aggregate TVL encompassing all DeFi projects.\n\nPredicts staked Ether to grow beyond 8M\n\nThe DeFi protocol predicted that the total number of staked Ethereum via its platform will surpass eight million in August, as it has consistently experienced large monthly net inflows despite the activation of withdrawals.\n\nDeFillama data shows that this prediction has come to pass with the total value of assets locked on Lido in terms of Ethereum currently at 8.08 million ETH, an all-time high. However, Lido\u2019s website places the number at around 7.9 million as of press time.\n\nCurve Finance exploit impact Lido\n\nIn the wake of the recent exploit of Curve Finance, several liquidity providers withdrew their assets from the platform\u2019s stETH-ETH pool.\n\nDespite the fact that this specific pool remained untouched by the exploit, stETH\u2019s usage in DeFi experienced a decline of 2.88% compared to the previous month of June. Consequently, the overall share held within the liquidity pools also underwent a substantial contraction, plummeting by 53.07%.\n\nOther metrics\n\nLido\u2019s increasing adoption has also translated into the growing adoption of its staked ETH. The number of unique addresses holding stETH increased by 9.26% from June to 255,000. The amount in lending pools also increased by 3.63%, while wstETH in Layer-2 networks jumped by 12.83%.\n\nThe demand for wrapped staked ETH on the layer-2 networks has also increased, with Arbitrum and Optimism bridges witnessing more wstETH deposits.\n\nHowever, Lido\u2019s LDO token struggled considerably in July, falling 7% amid the contagion fears that gripped the DeFi market.\n\nMentioned in this article"

It\u2019s built on Ethereum and \u201cdesigned for digital payments and Web3,\u201d with the firm saying it will soon be available to United States customers.\n\nThe launch has been seen as a boon for Ethereum adoption. Ethereum bulls Anthony Sassano and Ryan Sean Adams believe the ERC-20 stablecoin will push the blockchain closer toward becoming the money layer of the internet.\n\nThis is the Ethereum contract address for PayPal's stablecoin.\n\n\n\nI can't believe i get to tweet that.\n\n\n\nWe've come so far. pic.twitter.com/S6kSqcV4ut \u2014 RYAN S\u039eAN ADAMS - rsa.eth (@RyanSAdams) August 7, 2023\n\nThe number of daily active users on Ethereum currently hovers between 300,000-400,000, according to Etherscan.\n\nHowever, Sean Adams noted that 430 million accounts actively use the online payment processor, which means that over 5% of the world\u2019s 8 billion people could theoretically be onboarded onto Ethereum through PayPal\u2019s new stablecoin.\n\nMartin Koppelmann, the CEO and co-founder of Gnosis, added that by launching PYUSD on Ethereum\u2019s base layer, Ethereum layer-2s will be able to interact with PYUSD too.\n\nOthers, including lawmakers, have seen it as another example of larger institutions embracing crypto, breathing new life into the traditional payments system.\n\nIn an Aug. 7 statement, Patrick McHenry, chair of the United States House Committee on Financial Services, said stablecoins like PayPal\u2019s PYUSD \u201chold promise as a pillar of our 21st century payments system.\u201d\n\n#NEW: Chairman @PatrickMcHenry releases a statement following the announcement of PayPal's payment stablecoin launch.\n\n\n\nRead more https://t.co/LOF9ayUNnG pic.twitter.com/sRfSfLYbXQ \u2014 Financial Services GOP (@FinancialCmte) August 7, 2023\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced about PayPal\u2019s new stablecoin.\n\nSeveral smart contract auditors highlighted that PYUSD\u2019s smart contract contains \u201cfreezefunds\u201d and \u201cwipefrozenfunds\u201d functions, which they claim are textbook examples of centralization attack vectors in Solidity contracts.\n\nThe new Paypal USD stablecoin has an \"assetProtection\" role which can wipe your balance in two transactions (first `freeze`, then `wipeFrozenAddress`)\n\n\n\nIn smart contract security we call this a \"centralisation attack vector\" pic.twitter.com/RsmqvsnKvi \u2014 pashov (@pashovkrum) August 7, 2023\n\nThis concern was echoed by cryptocurrency researcher Chris Blec, who believes that PayPal will use the controversial functions where necessary.\n\nDigital asset lawyer Sasha Hodder believes many characteristics of PayPal\u2019s stablecoin resemble that of a censorship-enabled central bank digital currency. Another smart contract auditor noted that PYUSD\u2019s smart contract can be changed by PayPal at any time.\n\nI just read the PayPal USD terms of service.\n\n\n\n- full KYC\n\n- custody by Paxos\n\n- tied to your PayPal login\n\n- PayPal can reverse any transaction\n\n- claimed to be fully backed by actual USD\n\n\n\nAll the censorship capabilities of a CBDC, but launched by big tech instead of the gov't. \u2014 Sasha Hodder (@sashahodler) August 7, 2023\n\nIn October, PayPal was slammed for a controversial policy that could\u2019ve seen users fined $2,500 for spreading \u201cmisinformation.\u201d The firm later backpedalled, claiming the policy update was published \u201cin error.\u201d\n\nRelated: PayPal\u2019s crypto holdings increased by 56% in Q1 2023 to nearly $1B\n\nMeanwhile, blockchain engineer Patrick Collins took a slightly more neutral view, suggesting that PayPal\u2019s PYUSD could have been \u201cepic\u201d but believes some of the engineering choices were suboptimal \u2014 such as choosing an outdated version of Solidity to program the contract, making the contract upgradeable and not making it gas efficient.\n\nSassano also explained in a separate post that while PayPal\u2019s stablecoin is centralized, Ethereum users are free to choose whether they wish to use it or not.\n\nYes, PayPal's stablecoin is centralized.\n\n\n\nNo, that doesn't make it any less cool that PayPal has a stablecoin.\n\n\n\nEthereum being a settlement layer for all types of value means that different types of assets will exist on the network & you get to choose which ones you want to use. \u2014 sassal.eth (@sassal0x) August 8, 2023\n\nPayPal said PYUSD will be rolled out within the next few weeks.\n\nETH is currently priced at $1,825, which is approximately the same price at the time of PayPal\u2019s announcement about 10 hours ago, according to CoinGecko. Only minor fluctuations have been observed in ETH\u2019s price since then.\n\nMagazine: DeFi Dad, Hall of Flame: Ethereum is \u2018woefully undervalued\u2019 but growing more powerful"

This incident, which transpired on July 26, has captivated the cryptocurrency community, prompting many to ponder the rationale behind this significant burn.\n\nThe occurrence came to light on August 6 when \u201cdegeneratewisdom\u201d, a blockchain analyst, tweeted the query: \u201cCan anyone on here explain this tx to me Looks like nd4.eth sent 2500 ETH to a dead address. Doesn\u2019t look like a noob error either. Thoughts?\u201d\n\nThis tweet thrust nd4.eth\u2019s substantial 2500 ETH transfer to an inactive address into the spotlight, prompting speculation within the crypto community about the underlying intention behind this deliberate and seemingly calculated move.\n\nThe concept of \u201cburning\u201d tokens entails sending tokens to an address where they are rendered permanently unspendable, thereby diminishing the overall supply of the specific cryptocurrency. However, the reasoning behind nd4.eth\u2019s decision to annihilate such a sizable sum of Ethereum remains veiled in obscurity.\n\nLaurence Day, the innovator behind the Wildcat Protocol, infused an element of humour into the situation, tweeting, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t arise this morning and express gratitude to nd4.eth for contributing to the ultrasound money narrative, I urge you to engage in profound introspection regarding your objectives.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDelving deeper into the incident, analysts from the on-chain analysis company Lookonchain disclosed additional particulars about the persona behind nd4.eth.\n\n\u201cThe guy who transferred 2,500 $ETH($4.58M) to a dead address on July 26th is a whale with 34,287 $GMX($1.84M) and 311,003 $GNS($1.43M). He spent 5,330 $DAI to buy $GMX and $GNS on July 29 and also transferred 34.9 $GMX ($1,989) and 600 $GNX ($2,733) to the dead address,\u201d Lookonchain wrote on Monday.\n\nWhile the exact motives of the address owner are still unknown, accidentally sending crypto or NFTs to a burn address has occurred before, albeit occasionally. Last March, an NFT collector called Brandon Riley accidentally sent his CryptoPunk #685, purchased for 77 ETH ($129,437), to a burn address while attempting to wrap it for trading on NFTfi. The irreversible error wiped out a third of Riley\u2019s net worth. Although unrecoverable, Riley\u2019s CryptoPunk was \u201cresurrected\u201d as a Bitcoin ordinal on the blockchain.\n\nLast September, cryptocurrency exchange Kucoin accidentally sent a substantial amount of Ethereum (ETH), valued at tens of millions of dollars, to the Ethereum burn address. This unexpected move, spanning over three days and involving more than 3,500 USDT and ETH transactions, left the cryptocurrency community puzzled with the exact motive behind this burn remaining unknown."

        "content": "GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands, Aug. 8, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Puffer Finance, a blockchain infrastructure company, has announced the successful closure of its seed round, raising a total of $5.5 million USD. The round was co-led by Lemniscap and Lightspeed Faction, with participation from Brevan Howard Digital, Bankless Ventures, Animoca Ventures, DACM, LBK, SNZ and Canonical Crypto.\n\nThe funding will be leveraged to accelerate the development of Puffer's open-source Secure-Signer solution for the public good, and to create a capital-efficient permissionless staking pool.\n\nPuffer Finance Raises $5.5M Seed \u00adFunding to Strengthen Ethereum Decentralization & Scalability\n\nPuffer recognizes the inherent challenges validators face in the Ethereum Proof of Stake (PoS) network, particularly the risk of losing all of their staked ETH to slashing penalties resulting from software bugs or user errors. This carries significant risk for solo stakers without access to substantial amounts of ETH, discouraging small-scale participation and increasing the appeal of centralized services.\n\nPuffer's open-source project Secure-Signer is a remote signing tool designed to prevent Ethereum validators from committing slashable offenses, limiting access to validator keys in order to mitigate the effect of software bugs and user errors while simultaneously protecting them from costly penalties that disproportionately impact solo stakers. Secure-Signer previously received support from the Ethereum Foundation in the form of a $120k grant, underscoring its importance within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, Puffer Finance is actively working on a protocol to lower the barrier of entry for at-home stakers and to help them unlock additional rewards, providing a financially viable alternative to centralized Liquid Staking Providers (LSPs), whose economies of scale can otherwise provide greater rewards by addressing the issue of inactivity penalties and implementing innovative anti-slashing technology. The protocol will effectively reduce the bond requirement from 32 ETH to just 2 ETH.\n\nOther participants in Puffer's seed round include community funds such as 33DAO, WAGMI33, and Concave, as well as angel investors including DiscusFish, Co-founder of F2Pool & Cobo; Sreeram Kannan, Founder of Eigen layer; Frederick Allen, Staking Sales Lead at Coinbase Institutional; Calvin Liu, Head of Strategy at Eigen Layer; Ramble, Founder of the North American Blockchain Association; Mr.Block: Core Contributor at Curve; Ladislaus von Daniels, Staking Educator, Richard Malone, Head of Business at Obol Labs.\n\nPuffer's seed round follows an initial $650K raise in a pre-seed round led by Jump Crypto, and supported by IoTeX, Acanam Capital.\n\nCommenting on the announcement, Amir Forouzani, and Jason Vranek, Founders of Puffer Finance, said: \"The rapid advancements in infrastructure and user experience have primed Ethereum for mass adoption. As this era ushers in new centralization pressures, preserving Ethereum's core values becomes increasingly essential. We hope the Puffer Protocol will create a pocket within the validator set where decentralization can thrive. By lowering barriers to entry, anyone can run a Puffer Node from their home to operate Web3 infrastructure and play a pivotal role in shaping a Web3 that is resilient and censorship-resistant. We want to express our utmost gratitude to our investors for their trust, support, and partnership. Together and with our community, we will build a flourishing ecosystem true to the values that made Ethereum so special.\"\n\nJustin Drake, Researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, said: \"Validator operators should consider Puffer's SGX-based secure signer \u2013 at least until we get one-shot signatures. Zooming out, enclaves are a great way to incrementally improve security whenever pure cryptoeconomic defences fall short.\"\n\nRoderik van der Graaf, Founder of Lemniscap, said: \"The Puffer team is spearheading the development of sophisticated technological solutions geared towards reducing centralisation pressures on Ethereum. Puffer's proprietary Secure-Signer solution greatly mitigates operational risks associated with user errors and client bugs, providing best-in-class security for validators. The solution's low capital requirement of 2 ETH is a game changer in terms of broadening the accessibility of revenue streams for at-home stakers, encouraging new swathes of ecosystem participants to stake their claim in the burgeoning sector.\"\n\nSamuel Harrison, Managing Partner of Faction, said: \"Through software defined security, Puffer enables lower fees for users and higher ROI for node operators, whilst enabling a more decentralized and fragmented validator ecosystem. This advancement is beneficial for the entire space.\"\n\nAbout Puffer Finance\n\nPuffer is defining a new industry standard for secure validator operations with the primary objective of preserving decentralization, with Anti-Slashing technologies designed to minimize the chance of slashing events. The company's Secure-Aggregator technology provides the foundation to build a secure, scalable, and performant liquid staking protocol. Allowing permissionless and capital-efficient Node Operator (NoOp) participation allows anyone to join the PufferPool to help preserve Ethereum's decentralization.\n\nAbout Lemniscap\n\nLemniscap is an investment firm specializing in investments in emerging crypto assets and blockchain startups.

Discover SCENE\n\nPayPal is taking another step into the crypto industry, rolling out its very own stablecoin called PayPal USD.\n\nIssued by Paxos Trust Co., the dollar-pegged stablecoin is expected to become \"a part of the overall payments infrastructure,\" PayPal CEO Dan Schulman told Bloomberg.\n\nPayPal USD (PYUSD) is backed by short-term treasuries, dollar deposits, and cash equivalents, per the firm's announcement. The token will be issued on the Ethereum network as an ERC-20 token.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPayPal did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment.\n\nA stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that tracks the price of a fiat currency, such as the dollar or the pound. Currently, the market leaders in this sector are Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC).\n\nPayPal's offering is expected to work in tandem with its other crypto offerings, reportedly allowing users to swap the dollar-denominated tokens for cash or other assets on its platform.\n\nThe stablecoin will be available to eligible U.S., enabling them to transfer PayPal USD between PayPal and compatible external wallets, send person-to-person payments using PYUSD, and convert any of PayPal's supported cryptocurrencies to and from PayPal USD at vendor checkout points.\n\nIn March 2021, PayPal finally launched a crypto checkout service for merchants, letting users pay with crypto.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt continued its crypto push in May that same year with third-party integrations that allowed users to buy Bitcoin on the platform and then send it off the platform.\n\nPaxos to publish PayPal USD reserve reports\n\nPayPal further stated that starting next month, Paxos will be publishing public monthly reserve reports for PayPal USD outlining the instruments composing the stablecoin\u2019s reserves.\n\nAdditionally, Paxos will be engaged in publishing public third-party attestations of the value of PayPal USD reserve assets. This attestation will be released by an independent third-party accounting firm and conducted per attestation standards set by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).\n\n\u201cWith the launch of the first stablecoin by a leading financial institution, PayPal and Paxos are proving the real-world value of blockchain technology,\u201d Paxos CEO and Co-Founder Charles Cascarilla said in a statement, calling PYUSD \u201cthe most significant leap forward for digital assets and the financial industry.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the New York-based firm announced the termination of its relationship with the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange Binance which saw the company mint the BUSD stablecoin.\n\nThe move came after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) planned to sue Paxos for violating investor protection laws, the company confirmed to Decrypt in February."

        "title": "Ethereum And Smart Contracts: Unleashing The Power Of Decentralized Applications - Dataconomy",
        "content": "In the fast-paced world of blockchain technology, Ethereum has emerged as a groundbreaking platform that revolutionizes how we perceive decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nAt the core of this innovation lies the concept of smart contracts, enabling the trustless and automated execution of agreements. This article delves into the prowess of Ethereum, emphasizing its role in empowering DApps through smart contracts.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum\n\nEthereum, introduced by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables developers to build and deploy DApps. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum was designed to be more versatile, allowing not only the exchange of a native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH) but also the creation of smart contracts. This fundamental difference sets Ethereum apart and forms the foundation for its widespread adoption.\n\nThe concept of smart contracts\n\nAt the heart of Ethereum\u2019s disruptive potential lies the concept of smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing agreements with predefined rules and conditions that automatically trigger actions upon fulfillment.\n\nUtilizing blockchain technology makes these contracts immutable and transparent, eliminating the need for intermediaries. This feature has paved the way for various applications in finance, supply chain management, gaming, and more industries.\n\nUnleashing Decentralized Applications (DApps)\n\nDecentralized applications (DApps) are digital applications that operate on a decentralized network, providing users with enhanced security, privacy, and control over their data. Ethereum has emerged as a leading platform for DApps due to its robustness, flexibility, and large developer community.\n\nDApps built on Ethereum offer a wide array of advantages over traditional centralized applications, such as resistance to censorship, single points of failure, and increased transparency.\n\nBenefits of Ethereum for DApp developers\n\nEthereum provides numerous benefits for developers seeking to create innovative DApps.

One of the most notable applications is the rise of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms. DeFi applications provide financial services like lending, borrowing, and yield farming, all governed by smart contracts, eliminating the need for traditional financial institutions. .\n\nNon-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have gained immense popularity, allowing artists and gamers to tokenize digital assets, revolutionizing art ownership and in-game item trading.\n\nChallenges and limitations of Ethereum\n\nDespite its remarkable achievements, Ethereum faces several challenges. Scalability remains a pressing concern as the network struggles to handle many transactions, leading to high fees and slower processing times.\n\nMoreover, the energy consumption required for Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism has raised environmental concerns, mirroring the debates that arose during the bitcoin buyer.\n\nEthereum 2.0: The upgrade to overcome challenges\n\nEthereum has been undergoing a major upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 to address these issues. This transition introduces a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, significantly reducing energy consumption and improving scalability. Ethereum 2.0 aims to transform the blockchain into a faster, more secure, and more sustainable platform, enhancing the overall user experience.\n\nThe future of Ethereum and DApps\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve, its impact on DApps and decentralized technologies will likely expand further. With ongoing developments and improvements, Ethereum is positioning itself as a formidable force driving innovation across various industries. Its versatility and adaptability will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of blockchain technology.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum has undeniably unlocked the potential of DApps through the ingenious concept of smart contracts. Its impact on the blockchain industry is akin to the rise of the Bitcoin Era. By providing developers with a robust and versatile platform,\n\nEthereum has ushered in a new era of decentralized applications, fostering a paradigm shift in how we interact with digital services.

        "content": "Tue 08 Aug 2023 \u25aa 4 min of reading \u25aa by Evans S.\n\nIn the crypto sector, Ethereum presents itself not as an idyllic asylum, but rather as an unsuspected empire of cybercrime. On this digital stage, an alarming manifestation of crime thrives, the titanic scale of which was recently unveiled by insightful researchers.\n\nThe proliferating shadow of cybercrime on Ethereum\n\nThe spectre of cybercrime is spreading in the shadow of the Ethereum network. While bitcoin remains the undisputed behemoth of the cryptosphere, Ethereum stands out for the complexity of its fraudulent activities, according to researchers.\n\nIts ability to host smart contracts offers a wider range of digital crimes. This characteristic transforms Ethereum into a veritable cybercrime empire.\n\nAccording to information extracted from blockchain explorers such as Etherscan, an alarming number of over 5,600 Ethereum addresses have been identified as being linked to cybercrime activities.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, these findings find a powerful echo in the rigorous analyses carried out by Whale Alert\u2019s ScamAlert. Together, these data reveal the frightening extent of cybercrime in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThese tagged addresses traced over 1.78 million transactions from unsuspecting victims, totaling a staggering $1.65 billion in stolen funds. This figure is almost 16 times greater than self-reported losses to the FTC, revealing the severe extent to which crypto cybercrime is under-reported by regulators.\n\nThe many faces of cybercrime on Ethereum\n\nOn the throne of Ethereum crime, Ponzi schemes reign supreme. They account for 60% of stolen funds, far surpassing the scale of traditional financial Ponzi schemes. Fraudulent donations follow at 18%, followed by mining (13%) and hacking (5%).\n\nThe pseudonymity offered by blockchain has given Ponzi scams a mask of anonymity. This makes them harder to detect and crack down on.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the global reach of cryptocurrencies has widened the scope of these scams. As a result, crypto-Ponzi scams have become a ubiquitous and worrying threat to investors worldwide.\n\nBut the evil doesn\u2019t stop there. New cybercrimes are emerging, specific to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Rug pulls\u201d, for example, lure investors into new projects only to abandon them abruptly, draining all liquidity. Phony token scams create worthless imitations of real coins to fool traders.\n\nRepercussions and the need for a shift in direction\n\nBeyond simple quantification, the researchers analyzed the impact of cybercrime on investor behavior.\n\nIn the short term, victims obtain higher returns by taking greater risks. But over the long term, their risk-adjusted returns significantly underperform those of non-victims.\n\nImproved consumer protection is urgently needed to safeguard mainstream investors as cryptocurrency adoption grows. Regulators must also step up their efforts to curb illicit crypto activity, before it seriously undermines confidence in blockchain technology as a whole.\n\nOnly increased diligence on the part of legislators and investors will enable decentralized finance innovation to continue to flourish. What\u2019s more, Bitcoin\u2019s spectacular spike to $150k during its halving could attract an influx of newcomers, unfortunately opening the door to a potential multiplication of scams.

        "title": "When is EIP-4844, and why is it considered the biggest game changer for Ethereum? - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum protocol\u2019s proposed upgrade EIP-4844 is expected to go live in Q4 2023.\n\nEIP-4844 is known as proto-danksharding, its objective is to reduce fees by introducing a new transaction type.\n\nEthereum developers tried to reduce transaction fees through the past few upgrades.\n\nEIP-4844, Ethereum blockchain\u2019s proposed upgrade, is lined up for Q4 2023. Its primary feature is called proto-danksharding. Proto-danksharding has two key objectives for the Ethereum blockchain:\n\nReducing transaction fees\n\nIncreasing transaction throughput\n\nThe Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) aims to achieve these objectives through the introduction of \u201cblobs\u201d of data, a new transaction type on the ETH blockchain.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum buying spree likely in August as DAI whale holdings climb higher\n\nWhat are EIPs and why are they important?\n\nEIPs specify new features or processes that improve the Ethereum blockchain. The proposal defines technical specifications, and they are considered key for the community of developers to propose, debate and adapt changes to continuously improve the ETH blockchain.\n\nEIPs are a vehicle of governance on the Ethereum blockchain. While anyone is free to propose an improvement, stakeholders in the community determine if it should be adopted or included in a network upgrade.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain has faced a key challenge since its launch \u2013 the spike in transaction fees on the network. To address this issue, several solutions and EIPs have been proposed. EIP-4844 or proto-danksharding is set to address this as one of its key objectives.\n\nWhat is EIP-4844?\n\nEIP-4844, better known as proto-danksharding, is named after Ethereum researchers Proto Lambda and Dankrad Feist.\n\nSharding is another name for partitioning a database into smaller data segments. In simple terms, it's like cutting a pizza into slices. A pizza can be consumed more effectively and with higher efficiency when cut into slices, and the same can be applied to specific data segments.\n\nThere are several unique features in addition to segmenting data. While the Ethereum base layer processes around 15 TPS and layer 2 rollups take the number to 100, danksharding is predicted to eventually increase Ethereum\u2019s throughput to 100,000.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain is headed in the direction of a full \u201cdanksharding,\u201d and EIP-4844 is the first step. It would increase the throughput from 100 to 1,000. While it is scheduled to occur in Q4 2023, delays are anticipated.\n\nEIP-4844 is considered a game changer for this reason\n\nEIP-4844 introduces blob-carrying transactions. These are similar to regular transactions with added pieces of information. Ethereum contributor Ben Edgington has summarized EIP-4844 as an improvement that \u201cbolts blobs onto blocks.\u201d\n\nIn the first look it may be perceived as an increase in blocksize, which is counterintuitive to increasing efficiency. However, blobspace is different from blockspace, and blobs are not visible to the Ethereum Virtual Machine. They do not occupy space on the base layer of the blockchain. Blobs are visible for a short period of time, and the space occupied by them is relatively cheaper when compared to blocks.\n\nThe scaling and cost-saving benefits of sharding comes from EIP-4844, making it a game changer improvement for the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain\u2019s future roadmap is centered on \u201crollups,\u201d and EIP-4844 is a part of the same. Users will experience the difference post implementation of EIP-4844, as ETH transactions become faster and fees become relatively cheaper. This is likely to boost the competitiveness of the Ethereum blockchain."

        "content": "In a move signaling the significant shift towards digital currencies, PayPal has announced the launch of its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin \u2013 PayPal USD (PYUSD).\n\nThis development, announced by PayPal directly, adds a new dimension to the emerging potential of regulated, fully-backed stablecoins in transforming payments in digitally native environments like web3.\n\nIn a prepared statement, Paxos CEO and cofounder Charles Cascarilla said:\n\n\u201cWith the launch of the first stablecoin by a leading financial institution, PayPal and Paxos are proving the real-world value of blockchain technology. PayPal USD is the most significant leap forward for digital assets and the financial industry and Paxos is proud to enable this transformative product.\u201d\n\nThe news comes after progress on the project was said to have stalled in February. A company representative told Bloomberg then, \u201cWe are exploring a stablecoin\u2026If and when we seek to move forward, we will, of course, work closely with relevant regulators.\u201d\n\nWhat is PYUSD? PayPal USD\n\nPYUSD is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, U.S. Treasuries, and similar cash equivalents, providing a one-to-one redemption for U.S. dollars. Further, the company confirmed that the stablecoin will be available for U.S. customers.\n\nAdditionally, according to the terms listed in the announcement, it appears that PYUSD may become the native token of PayPal\u2019s crypto service with no \u201cspread\u201d charged on the swaps.\n\n\u201cWhen you buy or sell cryptocurrency, including when you check out with crypto, we will disclose an exchange rate and any fees you will be charged for that transaction. For currencies other than PayPal USD, the exchange rate includes a spread that PayPal earns on each purchase and sale. PayPal USD is not available in Hawaii.\u201d\n\nAcknowledging the need for a stable, digitally native instrument easily connected to fiat currency, Dan Schulman, President and CEO of PayPal, expressed the company\u2019s commitment to innovation and compliance,\n\n\u201cOur track record delivering new experiences to our customers provides the foundation necessary to contribute to the growth of digital payments through PayPal USD.\u201d\n\nAs an ERC-20 token issued on the Ethereum blockchain, PayPal USD aims to seamlessly bridge the gap between fiat and digital currencies for consumers, merchants, and developers.\n\nThe new stablecoin is expected to facilitate fast transfers of value, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and support global brands\u2019 continued expansion into digital assets. Moreover, PayPal USD will be compatible with web3-specific environments, with plans for availability on Venmo shortly.\n\nPYUSD issuance and transparency\n\nThe issuance of PayPal USD is overseen by Paxos Trust Company, a fully licensed limited-purpose trust company, subject to regulatory oversight by the New York State Department of Financial Services. This regulatory oversight ensures that reserves for PayPal USD are fully backed and that the stablecoin can be bought or sold through PayPal at a rate of $1.00 per PYUSD.\n\nPaxos intends to further enhance transparency by publishing a public monthly Reserve Report for PayPal USD outlining the instruments composing the reserves, starting September 2023.\n\nThis report will be complemented by a public third-party attestation of the value of PayPal USD reserve assets issued by an independent accounting firm by the standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).\n\nIn addition to offering a range of services that add utility to digital currencies, the company stated that it is committed to increasing consumer and merchant comprehension of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), while actively engaging with regulators as the industry evolves.\n\nAs the digital payment revolution progresses, PayPal\u2019s new stablecoin marks a significant stride toward a more integrated digital economy.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "But it is interesting to imagine exactly what Web3 would look like if a company like PayPal was a major crypto services provider, or even what the company\u2019s own vision for Web3 in five years will be. There is little doubt that PayPal will have to abide by U.S. sanctions, develop lengthy blacklists and use automated software to (sometimes erroneously) freeze accounts; that it will likely have underpaid comms people doing its crypto customer service. More people will be in crypto, but like the internet after the \u201cEternal September\u201d that brought a critical mass of people online (and necessitated the need for digital-first payments options like PayPal), crypto may become unrecognizable to today\u2019s users."

        "content": "With the majority of the cryptocurrency market dragging its feet in recent weeks, it is no surprise that its second-largest asset by market cap, Ethereum (ETH), is doing the same. However, the hope remains it could hit the high price level of $5,000 sometime in the future.\n\nAs it happens, Ethereum managed to get close to this mark on November 9, 2021, when it reached its all-time high (ATH) of $4,815.01, climbing by 168.25% from the $1,794.97 where it stood on July 21, 2021, which is close to its price at present and suggests a very real possibility of repeating this success.\n\nWith this in mind, Finbold has analyzed the main factors that could (but do not necessarily have to) lead Ethereum closer to the $5,000 price level and eventually overtake it \u2013 either by themselves or together with other influences.\n\nMass adoption of Ethereum-based applications\n\nWith Ethereum being the most popular blockchain choice to build a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps) on, such as in the sector of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and gaming, it could help its cryptocurrency grow further in price, thanks to the growing demand.\n\nFor instance, one of the major companies building on the Ethereum blockchain is PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), which has recently announced the launch of its own ERC-20 United States dollar-pegged stablecoin PayPal USD (PYUSD), issued by crypto firm Paxos Trust Company, as Finbold reported on August 7.\n\nImproved scalability\n\nWith the launch of the better-performing, more accessible \u2018Ethereum 2.0,\u2019 the network has improved its scalability, helping it handle more transactions per second and making it more attractive to users and developers. If this trend continues, it could lead to growing demand for Ethereum and its higher price.\n\nIndeed, the Ethereum development team has been working hard on boosting the network\u2019s usability, the work that also brought a shift from the proof-of-work (PoW) to the proof-of-stake (PoS) model with an aim to reduce energy waste and transaction times, as well as improve scalability.\n\nInstitutional adoption\n\nOn top of that, more institutional investors recognizing Ethereum\u2019s potential and buying more ETH could drive the price higher simply by following the rules of supply and demand \u2013 the more desirable an asset is, the higher its price, and institutions can have the power to contribute in shaping market trends.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s advance could also happen under the influence of the Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and X (formerly Twitter) CEO, Elon Musk, supporting the bold prediction on the future of the crypto market that could see both Ethereum and Bitcoin (BTC) surge massively.\n\nRegulatory environment\n\nAmid increased regulatory pressure, particularly in the US, which has culminated in multiple lawsuits against some of the industry\u2019s largest representatives, the cryptocurrency market as a whole can feel its effects, which is why positive regulatory developments and favorable regulations for digital assets could help drive their prices, including Ethereum.\n\nOne example of such positive developments is the refusal of the British financial services minister, Andrew Griffith, to agree with the Treasury Committee\u2019s recommendation to regulate retail trading and investing in unbacked crypto assets as gambling in late July and his support of their treatment as other financial services.\n\nMarket sentiment\n\nFinally, the atmosphere in the wider crypto and macroeconomic landscape can often influence the price of particular assets, including cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, for instance, with positive (or negative) developments and news coverage about the industry.\n\nIndeed, the above factors could contribute to the bullish sentiment, and when people are feeling bullish about digital assets in general, they are more likely to invest in them, and the positive sentiment could affect the price of ETH, which is more likely to increase.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum was at press time changing hands at the price of $1,828.2, the same as the day before, in addition to losing 0.29% in the last week and declining 2.05% on its monthly chart, as per the latest information retrieved on August 8.\n\nEthereum 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nIn conclusion, time will tell if the above factors are truly powerful enough to push the price of Ethereum toward $5,000. But one thing is for certain \u2013 they could, indeed, contribute to its strengthening and, in time, possibly reaching this coveted price level.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "USD Coin (USDC) issuer Circle has released a beta version of a multiparty computation (MPC) wallet service, according to an Aug. 8 announcement. The new service will allow developers of decentralized finance (DeFi) apps, Web3 video games, e-commerce services and other blockchain applications to create customized wallets specifically for their users. It will be available initially on Ethereum, Avalanche and Polygon.\n\nBuilding crypto apps is still too hard. Plus, less than 0.5% of the 100 million developers worldwide are actively building crypto apps today.\n\n\n\nThis needs to change. Our new wallet-as-a-service developer platform is a huge step in that regard. Check it out https://t.co/ku9LTz8Z97 \u2014 Patrick Hansen (@paddi_hansen) August 8, 2023\n\nMPC wallets are secured by splitting a user\u2019s private key into multiple shards and distributing them through a decentralized network. It\u2019s a new wallet technology many Web3 developers have been using. MPC wallets can be accessed via an application programming interface, giving them a \u201cWeb2 feel\u201d that some developers and users prefer.\n\nAccording to an explanatory blog post from Circle, the new service will allow developers to \u201cchoose the best wallet security and control configurations.\u201d For example, some developers may want to host their own MPC nodes to ensure they are not completely reliant on Circle, while others may want to choose the simpler method of connecting to Circle\u2019s nodes. Developers can also choose to \u201cshare transaction signing responsibilities with the users,\u201d allowing them to recover keys if users lose them, or they can make the product noncustodial by requiring users to sign every transaction.\n\nAccording to Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire, the new service is essential in promoting the use of USDC:\n\n\u201cCircle\u2019s Programmable Wallets is part of a new, core pillar of our strategy to advance global, mainstream utility and adoption of digital assets like USDC and public blockchain-based payments. This new platform marks the first step for Circle\u2019s Web3 services as we work to ease common pain points for developers.\u201d\n\nMPC wallets have faced controversy, with the widely used Multichain MPC bridge hacked on July 7, causing investors to lose over $100 million. The Multichain team later admitted that all MPC shards had been stored on a cloud server under the control of the CEO.\n\nIn an emailed statement to Cointelegraph, Circle\u2019s senior director of product management, Gagan Mac, claimed that the new service \u201cis built and maintained in-house and doesn\u2019t leverage external vendors,\u201d implying that third-party cloud storage systems will not be used. In addition, Gagan stated that \u201csome developers and enterprises may prefer to host an MPC node,\u201d which they will be allowed to do if they wish. Multichain did not allow partners to host their own nodes.\n\nCircle recently stated that the demand for euro-based stablecoins is heating up and also argued that a yuan stablecoin would be better than a Chinese central bank digital currency."

The stablecoin will be issued by Paxos Trust, which is subject to regulatory oversight by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).\n\nPayPal, which has more than 430 million active users, first offered users the ability to trade cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin through its platform in 2020. However, the company had put its plans to bring its own stablecoin to market on hold earlier this year, after the NYDFS began a probe into Paxos.\n\n\u201cThis announcement is a clear signal that stablecoins \u2013 if issued under a clear regulatory framework \u2013 hold promise as a pillar of our 21st century payments system,\u201d commented U.S. House Committee on Financial Services Patrick McHenry.\n\nMeanwhile, blockchain proponents believe that the development is a step in the right direction for the wider crypto industry on its path towards more mainstream adoption.\n\n\u201cEthereum is slowly but surely becoming a global settlement layer for all types of value,\u201d tweeted Ethereum advocate Anthony Sassano.\n\nSassano also addressed several criticisms raised by smart contract auditors, who took issue with some of the design choices in PYUSD\u2019s smart contract which comes with functions that allow for wiping a user\u2019s entire balance.\n\nThe new Paypal USD stablecoin has an \"assetProtection\" role which can wipe your balance in two transactions (first `freeze`, then `wipeFrozenAddress`) In smart contract security we call this a \"centralisation attack vector\" pic.twitter.com/RsmqvsnKvi \u2014 pashov (@pashovkrum) August 7, 2023\n\n\u201cYes, PayPal\u2019s stablecoin is centralized. No, that doesn\u2019t make it any less cool that PayPal has a stablecoin. Ethereum being a settlement layer for all types of value means that different types of assets will exist on the network & you get to choose which ones you want to use,\u201d said Sassano."

        "content": "The long crypto winter throughout 2022 was challenging for many investors, to put it mildly. But those who stuck it out have been rewarded with substantial gains so far this year.\n\nEthereum (ETH 1.20%) is currently up by around 52% so far this year, and Bitcoin (BTC 1.25%) has soared by roughly 74% in that timeframe. Some smaller cryptocurrencies have seen even larger gains, with Solana (SOL 0.62%) surging by a whopping 141% this year.\n\nIt's still critical to choose the right investments, however. Despite this upswing in prices, there will likely be more volatility on the horizon, and buying the wrong crypto now could come back to bite you later.\n\nWhile crypto is still speculative and there's no one-size-fits-all buying option, there's one investment I'm loading up on in August: Ethereum.\n\nEthereum continues to be a juggernaut\n\nEthereum has long been a leader in the industry, and it continues to dominate. It's the second-largest crypto behind Bitcoin by market cap, making up just under 20% of the entire crypto sector.\n\nEthereum's smart contract platform provides a wide range of uses, as it can host everything from non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to metaverse projects and more.\n\nThat alone gives it more utility than its largest competitor Bitcoin, which is used primarily as a payment coin or hedge against inflation. Ethereum's sheer size also gives it an advantage over smaller, similar networks (such as Solana or Cardano), as it dominates the smart contract space.\n\nLate last year, Ethereum developers also successfully finalized The Merge. This landmark upgrade transformed the network into a proof-of-stake blockchain, reducing its energy output by roughly 99%. Meanwhile, Bitcoin still uses the incredibly energy-intensive proof-of-work system, which could make it harder for the crypto to keep up with demand over time.\n\nMore upgrades could further strengthen Ethereum\n\nThe Merge was the biggest update to Ethereum so far, but it's far from the last. In fact, Ethereum founder Vitalike Buterin said at the Ethereum Community Conference last year that the network is only around 40% complete -- and it should get stronger with each update.\n\nButerin has created a roadmap of Ethereum's future updates, and the next one -- called The Surge -- is expected to improve the blockchain's speed and reduce transaction fees.\n\nThis has long been a sore spot for Ethereum, and its sluggish transaction times and high fees have caused many users to flock to faster and cheaper networks like Solana. If The Surge is able to squash these problems, it could be monumental for Ethereum's long-term potential.\n\nBeyond The Surge, there are several other updates on the roadmap -- including The Scourge, The Verge, The Purge, and The Splurge. The later updates likely won't take place until several years from now, but the roadmap has been designed to tackle problems in order of most to least pressing for users.\n\nIs Ethereum a good investment right now?\n\nEthereum is already a strong investment, and it should only get stronger with each new upgrade. But there are risks to consider, too.\n\nFor one, the crypto industry moves at break-neck speed, and developers are creating new blockchains by the day. While Ethereum's size and popularity give it a major leg up over smaller competitors, that doesn't mean a new network can't swoop in and steal market share -- especially if Ethereum fumbles any of its future upgrades.\n\nAlso, cryptocurrency in general is still a risky investment. Despite all of its potential uses, Ethereum's utility is largely based on speculation. In other words, if NFTs, DeFi, the metaverse, or other decentralized applications gain widespread acceptance, Ethereum will benefit from it. If they don't, Ethereum could suffer.\n\nWhen you invest in any cryptocurrency, there's always a risk it may not pan out. But if you're willing to take that risk, Ethereum could be a strong investment with loads of long-term potential."

        "title": "Markets - New hope for crypto derivatives as markets urged to hail CESR - Risk.net",
        "content": "Ethereum staking index could allow swap curve and structured products to develop\n\nLast September, Ethereum crossed the Rubicon. The blockchain, which had until then operated under a proof-of-work (Pow) architecture similar to those underpinning cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, switched to an entirely new mechanism known as proof of stake (Pos).\n\nUnder the old system, block creators known as \u2018miners\u2019 would be given Ethereum\u2019s cryptocurrency ether (ETH) in return for decrypting hexadecimal numerical codes. Under Pos, members of the network \u2013 now known as \u2018validators\u2019 \u2013 stake their ETH tokens into a smart contract, which enables them to earn fees by confirming transactions. The tokens can be destroyed if the validators behave improperly.\n\nThe transition also triggered what CoinFund president Chris Perkins says was a \u201clight bulb\u201d moment for his digital asset investment firm. Perkins saw that the fees validators would earn could wax and wane depending on the level of demand on the network. Surprising market events, like the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, could cause spikes in demand and lead to higher fees.\n\nI\u2019m hopeful we can build social consensus that CESR is the standard benchmark for Ethereum staking. Once we have social consensus, the industry \u2013 both trad-fi and crypto \u2013 can build Chris Perkins, CoinFund\n\nPerkins realised that validators, like any businesses with variable income and fixed costs, would need a way to hedge their financial exposure, and so he joined forces with CoinDesk Indices to launch the Composite Ether Staking Rate (CESR), which tracks the yields validators earn. The benchmark \u2013 pronounced in the same way as the Roman emperors \u2013 could also enable validators to enter into swap contracts whereby they would exchange CESR for a fixed rate, thus locking in their profits.\n\nPerkins says CESR, as a staking yield index, is a \u201cnon-correlated rate to traditional finance\u201d. He believes certain investors, such as hedge funds and family offices, might use it to achieve a stream of returns unconnected to conventional asset classes \u2013 such as bonds and equities, the values of which can fluctuate in reaction to changes in the US Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy.\n\nAndy Baehr, managing director at CoinDesk Indices, says using CESR as a settlement rate will support a fixed-versus-floating swap market that lines up natural users on both sides. He believes validators could experience less volatility in their revenue by swapping their variable staking yield for a fixed rate.\n\n\u201cThe other side of the trade \u2013 receiving floating \u2013 could carry a risk premium and could be incorporated into investor products,\u201d he says. \u201cDue to the natural convexity of Ethereum staking yields, dealers may find that holding on to floating inventory is, in a sense, right-way risk.\n\n\u201cThe question is, where is that fixed rate going to trade? That comes down to what fixed payments validators will be happy to receive to give away that convexity in service of improving the Sharpe ratio of their stake.\u201d\n\nIn the arena\n\nCESR is not the only staking yield index that market participants have looked at. Switzerland-based Compass Financial Technologies has been working with exchange-traded product (ETP) issuers to use its own staking yield rate as a base yield in ETH products. Compass is a European Union-approved benchmark administrator, and its STYETH index is approved for use in regulated products in the bloc.\n\nETPs could use swaps based on staking yield indices to give investors a total return on ETH.\n\nSo far, most crypto ETPs simply give investors exposure to the performance of ETH. Guillaume Le Fur, Compass\u2019s CEO, says some ETP providers have begun to offer clients a fixed staking yield on top of that. However, this is typically at the discretion of the asset manager. Compass has been working with issuers to incorporate the returns from its index into the products.\n\nETPs come with liquidity management issues. With ETH, unlike some coins on Pos blockchains, there is no minimum period of days during which the currency must be staked. However, ETH does have an entry queue: it currently takes around 31 days to stake the currency but only one minute to exit. Based on that, an ETP could not at any time stake 100% of its ETH holdings as it would have to manage daily liquidity requirements.\n\nETPs keep as profit the margin between the actual staking rate and what the client receives. Although this is currently acceptable to retail investors, Le Fur thinks that if more institutions are to be attracted to the market they will want the total return exposure.\n\nAnother use case is structured products. Chris Bae, founder and chief executive of Enhanced Digital Group, says CESR could be used for a classic zero-coupon bond structure, where the reference rate is used as the pull-to-par by maturity. The difference at inception could be used to buy ETH options that provided customised payoffs.\n\n\u201cIt just opens the yield world beyond securities lending,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a yield that we can grasp from the validators. And then all of a sudden \u2013 if you can build on it, put notes on it and financialise it \u2013 it\u2019s a really tangible hurdle and interest rate for the ETH ecosystem. Validators may be willing to swap up a considerable percentage of their received staking yields for fixed US dollars to pay for things like expenses or loan costs.\n\n\u201cInterest in structured products in general has gone up as interest rates have risen. But with US Treasuries paying more than 5%, the overall macro environment provides a lot of choices for competitive yields.\"\n\nGreg Schvey, CEO of market infrastructure technology company Axoni, says CESR could provide transparency around staking services, and thereby enable users of those services to \u201cunderstand the spread they\u2019re paying the service provider by comparing to the benchmark rate\u201d.\n\nHe adds: \u201cGiven the inherent transparency provided by the blockchain, it would also help prevent the manipulation and related issues we\u2019ve seen in Libor.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is convinced about CESR\u2019s merits. Max Boonen, founder of digital asset liquidity provider B2C2, believes it is too early for the benchmark to take off. \u201cThere could be demand for the rate if it\u2019s freely accessible and a licensing fee doesn\u2019t need to be paid,\u201d he says. \u201cBut more of a market around the actual act of staking is needed before we have data providers and the like on top.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really have much in the way of convenient user interfaces with staking. It tends to be a little bit convoluted because you need to go deep in the technology. Some exchanges offer staking as a service, but I think we\u2019re only at the beginning of that industry.\u201d\n\nGiven the inherent transparency provided by the blockchain, [CESR] would also help prevent the manipulation and related issues we\u2019ve seen in Libor Greg Schvey, Axoni\n\nHowever, Perkins says CoinFund does not mind being early and that it has responded to the feedback of finance and academia by engineering a benchmark that is robust, institutional and investible. He adds that CESR is transparent and replicable \u2013 enabling industry stakers to compete against the mean.\n\n\u201cThis sort of transparency should be a good thing for markets,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful we can build social consensus that CESR is the standard benchmark for Ethereum staking. Once we have social consensus, the industry \u2013 both trad-fi and crypto \u2013 can build.\u201d\n\nWhen in ETH, do as the ETH traders do\n\nOne crypto-native market-maker is already on board with CESR.\n\nRyan Kim is head of derivatives at California-based FalconX, which is the only crypto-native firm registered as a swap dealer with the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission. He sees demand for a contract where the CESR rate is denominated in ETH, with the USD/ETH exchange rate locked in at the outset, so both the fixed and floating legs can be exchanged in dollars. Under that scenario, Kim says FalconX could manage the USD/ETH risk, though he adds that the validators would probably want to receive the fixed leg in dollars so they could use it to pay for business or loan expenses.\n\n\u201cWhat they can do is come to FalconX and say \u2018I will give you every month my ETH production at the rate that is the average rate,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201c\u2018And in exchange, you will give me a set number of dollars every month.\u2019 I have now completely taken out the uncertainty involved with this loan. And I now know I have this stream of dollar payments no matter what the price of ETH does, and as long as I beat the average I will have that ETH on hand to deliver to Falcon X.\u201d\n\nKim says a typical tenor would be six months, with monthly coupon payments, and a typical notional size would be around $250 million. Initially, he expects most interest to come from the validator side \u2013 which would mean FalconX, as a market-maker, having to find a way to hedge \u2013 though he also expects an interdealer market in the swaps to grow over time.\n\nPerkins is confident other market-makers will get involved. Over time, he believes swap trading on the benchmark will allow for the development of a term curve, which asset managers could use as a discount curve to value their ETH assets.\n\nLast year, staking yield swaps were also attempted on Lido, a benchmark that takes in just under 30% of the total number of validators. However, while this rate is based on what Lido itself produces, Perkins says CESR is based on data from the entire Ethereum blockchain \u2013 more than 750,000 validators \u2013 \u201crather than a subset\u201d.\n\nCompass says STYETH also follows all on-chain validators worldwide.\n\nEmpire building\n\nBanks have so far been slow to take interest in CESR. Although Perkins detects curiosity from their research departments, he says traders are taking longer to \u201cdigest\u201d the benchmark. Basel capital rules mean a punitive 1,250% risk weight can be applied to holding crypto assets such as bitcoin or ETH on bank balance sheets.\n\nPerkins characterises CESR as \u201ca synthetic version once removed\u201d, as it does not reference ETH\u2019s underlying price. \u201cIf I was at a bank, I would definitely be working closely with my capital people to see if there\u2019s a structure upon which this could fit into the rates bucket,\u201d he says.\n\nPerkins, who was previously global co-head of futures, clearing and FX prime brokerage at Citi, is working with the International Swaps and Derivatives Association on updating its crypto definitions, which do not cover swaps. He believes there may be more interest in CESR from banks once ETH celebrates its 10th birthday in 2025: \u201cThat\u2019s a nice institutional unlock when you have 10 years of risk data.\u201d\n\nCESR went into production on September 15 last year after CoinDesk and Coinfund had finalised its methodology. Perkins expects more interest from regulated exchanges once it has amassed more than 12 months of historical data. He says that, as a truly global rate, it compares favourably with overnight index swap rates that are split up by jurisdiction, such as Eonia and Sonia.\n\nCESR is currently calculated once a day, seven days a week, based on a look-back period of 24 hours, but it has the potential to move to hourly releases. Initially offered in the US only, the benchmark is expected to go fully live later this month, with trades announced shortly afterwards.\n\nRelated Crypto gets to grips with interest rate swaps New derivatives provide synthetic access to staking yields and are being used in structured products\n\nBae of Enhanced Digital Group admits that a \u201cbeautiful seamless curve\u201d will not emerge immediately. He likens the evolution required for CESR to the forward curve for China\u2019s offshore renminbi in Hong Kong, which took two years to develop.\n\n\u201cCNH was really hard to adopt,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople were like, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t know why I want to trade that yet.\u2019 It was just one week and one month for a long time. And then it got to three months.\u201d He adds that a turning point that made the curve more tradeable was an increase in CNH-denominated bonds issued by Hong Kong corporates. He does, however, see definite uses cases for CESR.\n\nPerkins says the benchmark is also \u201ca pretty beautiful on-ramp into crypto for rates\u201d, as it would enable cross-currency swaps with fiat currencies or floating-for-floating basis swaps, such as SOFR against CESR.\n\n\u201cIf you have a view that traditional interest rates are going down and activity in Ethereum is going up,\u201d he says, \u201cmaybe you go long CESR and short SOFR.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen whether CESR will prove as all-conquering as its namesake. Rome was not built in a day but there are now, it seems, more roads leading to crypto derivatives.\n\nEditing by Daniel Blackburn"

This unusual act resulted in the permanent destruction of the coins, leaving the community baffled as to the motivation behind it.\n\nWhy Did nd4.eth Destroy $4.5 Million Worth of Ether?\n\nThe transaction itself occurred on July 26, but its significance only recently gained widespread attention, igniting a surge of speculation and intrigue within the crypto sphere. The true reasons behind such a bold move remain elusive, leaving analysts and observers grappling for answers.\n\nDespite the perplexity surrounding the situation, some in the community took a more lighthearted approach, even commending the individual for effectively reducing the supply of Ethereum. They saw it as an alignment with the narrative of \u201cEthereum\u2019s Ultrasound Money,\u201d a playfully embraced concept among enthusiasts.\n\nLaurence Day, the creative mind behind Wildcat Protocol, humorously commented, urging everyone to extend gratitude to nd4.eth for contributing to the \u201cultrasound money\u201d narrative.

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin (BTC) recent price action has investors skeptical about altcoins, as its continued slump continues to harm the cryptocurrency market. This is best seen in Ethereum (ETH) price, which continues to slide south. The same is illustrated by Ripple (XRP) price, whose bulls are actively losing to the bears and losing the ground covered in the June 13 rally.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin\u2019s quarterly chart simplifies confusion, 15% crash likely before $40,000, $50,000, or new all-time high\n\nOpen Interest, funding rate FAQs How does Open Interest affect cryptocurrency prices? Higher Open Interest is associated with higher liquidity and new capital inflow to the market. This is considered the equivalent of increase in efficiency and the ongoing trend continues. When Open Interest decreases, it is considered a sign of liquidation in the market, investors are leaving and the overall demand for an asset is on a decline, fueling a bearish sentiment among investors. How does Funding rate affect cryptocurrency prices? Funding fees bridge the difference between spot prices and prices of futures contracts of an asset by increasing liquidation risks faced by traders. A consistently high and positive funding rate implies there is a bullish sentiment among market participants and there is an expectation of a price hike. A consistently negative funding rate for an asset implies a bearish sentiment, indicating that traders expect the cryptocurrency\u2019s price to fall and a bearish trend reversal is likely to occur.\n\nBitcoin price delays the inevitable\n\nBitcoin (BTC) action shows intense strife between bulls and bears as both extremes pull for dominance. The red and green candlesticks on the four-hour chart below point to this fact. Amid this volatility, experts predict BTC to run back to the $30,400 range this week before a potential drop down to the $27,300 and $26,300 levels.\n\nAs buying pressure increases from the bullish breaker, Bitcoin price could ascend, potentially breaching the 50-, 100- and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) at $29,169, $29,339, and $29,438 levels, respectively. For the layperson, a bullish breaker is a failed demand or supply zone (demand zone in this case).\n\nFurther north, and with the Fair Value Gap (FVG) creating an imbalance that has to be filled, Bitcoin price could extend north to test this region at around the $30,400 level before a possible retracement. Such a move would constitute a 5% climb above the press time market value of $28,977. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) supports this outlook, tipping north to show rising momentum.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nConversely, if seller momentum outweighs bullish effort, Bitcoin price could continue south, with a decisive flip of the $28,706 support level into a resistance invalidating the optimistic outlook. If such an outcome prevails, BTC could extend south, possibly tagging the $27,300 support level, or in the dire case, extend a leg south to the $26,300 level. This would constitute a 10% slump.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin halving cycles show a weakening trend, similar to Litecoin, according to experts."

In fact, the king of altcoins\u2019 number of addresses in profit reached a one month low. However, a few of the metrics turned bullish on the token, giving hope for a volatile northbound price movement in the coming days. Is Ethereum actually setting up the stage for a bull rally?\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nEthereum investors are at a loss\n\nGlassnode Alerts\u2019 latest tweet revealed that ETH investors were suffering high losses. As per the tweet, Ethereum\u2019s number of addresses in profit reached a one month low of 66.6 million. A major reason behind this was the token\u2019s slow-moving price action. ETH has failed to cross $1,900 for quite some time.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, ETH was down by nearly 1.4% in the last seven days. At press time, it was trading at $1,837.80 with a market capitalization of over $220 billion. It was interesting to see that despite the price decline, ETH\u2019s 24-hour trading volume shot up by 23%.\n\nIn fact, as per Glassnode, the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Signal (7d MA) just reached a 3-month high of 2,386.022.

A high Galaxy Score is a bullish indicator, suggesting a northbound price movement over the coming days.

However, the sharks and shrimps continued to sell as addresses with a balance of 10 ETH to 10,000 ETH declined.\n\nApart from the Galaxy Score, a few other on-chain metrics were also in the bulls favor, increasing the chances of more volatile price action. For instance, Ethereum\u2019s exchange reserve was declining, which meant that the token was not under selling pressure.\n\nIts MVRV Ratio also showed signs of recovery, which was bullish. ETH\u2019s network activity also remained high, as evident from its daily active addresses. Moreover, ETH\u2019s network growth was also high in the last seven days.\n\nIs your portfolio green?

It means that buying sentiment was dominant in the futures market.\n\nAdditionally, its open interest registered a decline, increasing the chances of a trend reversal."

        "title": "Ethereum staking continues to gain wider acceptance, but there\u2019s a problem - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "The total amount staked equated to 21% of ETH\u2019s circulating supply.\n\nWith an increase in validators, the staking rewards have progressively reduced.\n\nThe much-awaited Shapella Upgrade, which went live on the Ethereum [ETH] mainnet earlier this year, has begun to advance towards its goal of boosting ETH staking.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nAs per a recent update by on-chain analysis firm Glassnode, the total ETH locked on the largest proof-of-stake (PoS) network clocked a fresh all-time high (ATH) of 27.03 million. This represented a nearly 40% jump since the execution of Shapella.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Total Value in the ETH 2.0 Deposit Contract just reached an ATH of 27,030,311 ETH Previous ATH of 27,029,938 ETH was observed on 05 August 2023 View metric:https://t.co/SzbMPqvhlb pic.twitter.com/H652OSM9q0 \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) August 6, 2023\n\nStakes are high\n\nShapella, which enabled withdrawals, marked an end to a two-year-long wait for users who began to lock their ETH holdings in the hopes of earning passive revenue from them.\n\nInfact not just the staked ETH but any earned staking incentives could also be withdrawn thanks to the upgrade. This marked a complete transition from the proof-of-work (PoW) to the proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithm.\n\nAs a result, individual holders who had been hesitant to deposit their money for an ambiguous period of time started to gradually stake more. These holders tested the unstaking mechanism in the first few days following the upgrade. This led to a significant uptick in withdrawal requests.\n\nHowever, since then, deposits have consistently outpaced withdrawals. According to blockchain research firm Nansen, the total amount locked at the time of publication equated to 21% of ETH\u2019s circulating supply.\n\nInterestingly, the increase in staked amount was in stark contrast to the depleting exchange supply of ETH. Since Shapella, ETH\u2019s reserves across centralized exchanged have dipped more than 20% until press time. The liquid supply constituted just 18% of all ETH tokens which were in public hands.\n\nThe fascinating divergence reflected what could be the beginning of a long-term trend in the Ethereum market. More and more people were taking ETH out of the market and using it as an investment to earn yields. And even though staking rewards have progressively reduced over the past two years, the clamor for staking continues to surge.\n\nRise of liquid staking\n\nApart from providing a fillip to staking, Shapella also unlocked new doors of opportunities for liquid staking tokens (LST). These derivative tokens, as is well known, enable users to participate in staking while also retaining the ability to use them elsewhere in decentralized finance (DeFi) for higher yield potential.\n\nTokens like Lido Staked ETH [stETH] and Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH began to replace native tokens as the primary DeFi collateral on various networks.\n\nOverall, liquid staking protocols extended their dominance since Shapella and outperformed other staking options like centralized exchanges (CEX) and staking pools.\n\nAs per Dune data, liquid staking accounted for the lion\u2019s share of the ETH staking market, roughly 36%. From being a non-existent entity when ETH staking was rolled out in December 2020, this category has steadily charged higher.\n\nWhat does ChatGPT think of ETH staking?\n\nHowever, like most analyses these days, I decided to add an AI tinge to proceedings. I consulted our AI expert ChatGPT to share its views on the future growth potential of Ethereum.\n\nI must admit the question \u2013 whether ETH staked supply will go past 30% of the total circulation supply, was very generic and egged the bot to showcase its soothsaying skills. However, it resisted the bait.\n\nChatGPT replied that predicting the next developments in ETH staking was like \u201cgazing into a crystal ball\u201d. However, it maintained that staking will play a big role in the evolution of the Ethereum network.\n\nStaking rewards drop significantly\n\nWhile ETH staking has clearly grown in popularity over the years, it has, ironically, reduced the staking yields, in pursuit of which users participated in the activity in the first place.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nAs per the proof-of-stake model, the rewards were inversely related to the amount of ETH deposited on the network and the number of stakers involved. Put simply, the more the number of stakers, the more thinly the yield gets spread out.\n\nThe total number of validators have soared by more than 50% since Shapella. However, the annualized financial return per validator has markedly dropped, as shown below. At the time of writing, the APR was 4.2%, according to Beaconcha.in."

        "content": "Programming languages suggests PYUSD was in the works since 2018.\n\nBy: Owen Fernau \u2022 Loading...\n\nCrypto News\n\nPayPal\u2019s stock jumped after the payments giant announced it will launch a stablecoin on speculation crypto may help shore up the company\u2019s financials.\n\nPaypal\u2019s shares jumped more than 2% today on the news that the company is launching an on-chain stablecoin. The crypto market. on the other hand, met the news with a muted response \u2014 ETH, the token necessary to transaction on Ethereum, moved less than a percentage point on the day.\n\nInvestors welcomed the news after the stock plunged 9% last week after the company\u2019s Q2 earnings were released. The report revealed a second consecutive quarter of dropping operating margins. Operating margin is a key indicator of a company's efficiency.\n\nProfitable Stables\n\nThe launch of PYUSD comes as Tether, the company behind the crypto\u2019s leading $83.7B stablecoin USDT, reported an eye popping $850M in profit last week \u2014 that\u2019s within striking distance of PayPal\u2019s $1.6B in operating income in Q2. And Tether actually topped PayPal in Q1 with a reported $1.5B in profit that quarter.\n\nU.S. Treasuries, whose yields are at 22-year highs, are driving Tether\u2019s profits and undoubtedly drawing eyeballs from the likes of PayPal.\n\nEthereum Blockchain\n\nPYUSD, as the stablecoin is called, will roll out on the Ethereum blockchain to PayPal\u2019s 431M active users. The firm advertised the stablecoin\u2019s use in money transfers, for day-to-day purchases, and as a currency convertible to other digital assets. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is usually pegged to the dollar, another fiat currency or a basket of assets.\n\nPayPal will back PYUSD with \u201cU.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. treasuries, and similar cash equivalents,\u201d according to a press release.\n\nControversial Code\n\nThe crypto community is still grappling with the stablecoin\u2019s feature which allows its owner to freeze and unfreeze the token in its holders\u2019 accounts.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha?

The company claims it will soon be available as a mode of payment for various purchases.\n\nPayPal launching a stablecoin could accelerate its efforts to become a crypto payment giant, an initiative the company started in 2020 after making way for crypto payments on the platform.\n\nPayPal boasts over 350 million active users and already lets users in the U.S. and the United Kingdom buy, sell and hold Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC) while also enabling payments in the assets.\n\nPayPal CEO Dan Schulman hopes the new stablecoin will become a part of the overall payments infrastructure.

Optimism, a layer 2 Ethereum protocol, is a low-cost and super-fast blockchain that has caught the attention of several companies and investors worldwide. As of August 2023, Optimism boasts a $2 billion on-chain value, $3 billion in saved gas fees, and $11 million OP tokens distributed to public goods.\n\nOptimism achieves lowered network latency and cheap transactions by combining several transactions and sending them to Ethereum\u2019s Mainnet as one. This combination effectively drops the network traffic and reduces gas fees.\n\nCreath has identified an immense potential for growth on OP Mainnet, and the company plans to leverage it as a solution for application efficiency and improved user accessibility. Some benefits that Creath and its community will enjoy from Optimism are scalability, simple integration, and low costs.\n\nThanks to the Optimistic Virtual Machine (OVM), transitioning from Ethereum smart contracts to Optimism is seamless. OVM is an iteration of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that makes it possible to onboard projects on OP Mainnet without having to rewrite existing systems.\n\nCreath aims to introduce its community to the perks of transacting with OP tokens. Creath\u2019s pilot project, Creath Art Marketplace, is currently built on the ERC-20 blockchain. For this reason, USDC, an ERC-20 compatible token, is used with traditional fiat to facilitate transactions on the platform.\n\nHowever, once the transition to OP Mainnet begins, Creath\u2019s community can enjoy the benefits of transacting with OP tokens, one of which is OP airdrops. So far, Optimism has completed two rounds of OP airdrops, with token holders awaiting a third round.\n\nCreath will release more information about its transition to the Optimism blockchain in the coming months.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) price is practically unchanged with a mere 0.14% increase over the last 24 hours. The amount of ETH burned since \u201cThe Merge\u201d has reached all-time high but has done little to spark optimism among the investors.\n\nThe Ethereum network has burned more than 50% of all the ETH issues since \u201cThe Merge \u201d event that saw Ethereum migrate from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to the proof-of-stake on the Beacon chain.\n\nAccording to data from Ultra Sound Money, the network has burned over 3.5 million ETH out of 6.5 million issued over the two years after Ethereum\u2019s EIP-1559 was introduced.\n\nWith the current rate, Ethereum is burning approximately 1.75 million ETH each year, resulting in a supply reduction of about 0.98%. From a technical perspective, the platform is gradually shifting towards a deflationary nature as the circulating supply of ETH diminishes over time due to active coin burns within the network.\n\nThis is in turn expected to increase the demand for the largest altcoin by market capitalization. In the meantime, ETH price is at risk of more losses as areas around the $1,700 demand zone come into the picture.\n\nEthereum Price At Risk of a 7% Decline\n\nBetween July 14 and August 8, the ETH price action has formed a descending triangle pattern on the daily chart. This pattern is characterized by a sequence of lower highs and relatively stable lows, reflecting a negative market sentiment. If Ether\u2019s price closes below the horizontal line of the triangle at $1,823, it would indicate a potential continuation of the on-going downtrend.\n\nIn such a scenario, the price of the smart contracts pioneer token could drop lower with the immediate support level situated at the $1,800 psychological level.\n\nAn added layer of support is anticipated to emerge from the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $1,788, preceding the price reaching the technical target of the current chart pattern at $1,700. Such a movement would lead to a cumulative loss of 7.23% from the current price.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nSupporting the bearish case for the Ethereum price is the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) which exhibited downward trends. The RSI value of 42 indicated the dominance of bearish sentiment in the ETH price trend.\n\nOn the positive side, bullish momentum would require pushing Ether\u2019s price above the descending triangle, necessitating a daily candlestick closure above the resistance line at $1,852, embraced by the 50-day SMA. Beyond this point, a formidable supply zone spans between $1,880 flanked by the 100-day SMA and the $1,900 psychological level.\n\nBreaking this barrier would validate a bullish breakout from the triangle, with the bulls then targeting the significant resistance at $1,960, followed by the psychological threshold of $2,000.\n\nThis could be where Ether\u2019s upside could be capped for the short term.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nPayPal has announced the launch of its native U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin called PayPal USD (PYUSD) based on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nFirst Global Payments Company to Launch a Stablecoin\n\nOn Monday, August 7, digital payments giant PayPal announced the official launch of its Ethereum-based stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. PayPal USD (PYUSD) will become available to the eligible U.S. customers in the upcoming weeks.\n\nThe ERC-20 stablecoin can be used for transfers between PayPal and supported external wallets, person-to-person payments, funding purchases, and converting any of the platform\u2019s listed digital assets to and from PayPal USD.\n\n\"The shift toward digital currencies requires a stable instrument that is both digitally native and easily connected to fiat currency like the U.S. dollar,\" commented Dan Schulman, president and CEO, PayPal. \"Our commitment to responsible innovation and compliance, and our track record delivering new experiences to our customers, provides the foundation necessary to contribute to the growth of digital payments through PayPal USD.\"\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s statement, PYUSD will serve as a bridge between fiat and Web3 for consumers and merchants, will be available to external developers, wallets and web3 applications, can be seamlessly adopted by exchanges, and used as a driving force behind many experiences in the PayPal ecosystem.\n\nThe issuer of PayPal USD is Paxos Trust Company, a fully licensed New-York based financial institution specializing in blockchain. PYUSD reserves are fully supported by U.S. dollar deposits, U.S. Treasuries and similar cash equivalents. PayPal USD can be bought or sold at a fixed rate $1 per PYUSD via PayPal.\n\nStarting from September 2023, Paxos will be publishing a public monthly Reserve Report for PayPal USD, and a public third-party attestation of the value of PayPal USD reserve assets.\n\n\u201cIn addition to building products and services that add utility to digital currencies, PayPal is focused on increasing consumer and merchant comprehension of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), while working closely with regulators as the industry evolves.\u201d reads the PayPal press release.\n\nPayPal Continues Integration of Crypto\n\nPayPal first confirmed its exploration of stablecoins back at the beginning of last year, although in February 2023 it reported to have halted the project due to regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. The release of PYUSD might mean that the company and its stablecoin issuer Paxos have finally reached an agreement with its persecutors.\n\nThe prominent fintech company has been actively exploring and integrating crypto services for the last couple of years. PayPal has recently revealed that it\u2019s holding almost $1 billion worth of crypto on behalf of its clients.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) rival Cardano (ADA) has seen its total value locked (TVL) explode nearly 200% since the beginning of the year, crypto analytics firm Messari reports.\n\nTVL refers to the amount of capital deposited within a protocol\u2019s smart contracts and is often used to gauge the health of a crypto ecosystem.\n\nIn a new report on the state of Cardano, Messari says that Cardano\u2019s TVL was up 9.7% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) and 198.6% year-to-date (YTD), allowing the Ethereum competitor to move up from the 34th position to the 21st in overall TVL among all chains.\n\nAccording to Messari, Cardano\u2019s TVL dipped in June after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Coinbase for allegedly offering unregistered securities, specifically naming ADA in the lawsuit.\n\nMessari says the development put sell pressure on ADA and caused liquidations on Cardano-based decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.\n\nThe firm says Cardano is also showing promise thanks to accelerated development within the ecosystem, including new stablecoins, wallets and other protocols.\n\n\u201cNew infrastructure such as stablecoins, programming languages, and wallets are helping Cardano developers create more sophisticated applications with improved UXs (user experience). During Q2, Cardano\u2019s ecosystem grew 49% QoQ in DApp transactions and 10% QoQ in TVL (USD). More importantly, the ecosystem diversified with newer protocols contributing significantly to various activity metrics.\n\nMultichain solutions, such as Hydra Head and the Milkomeda C1 sidechain, continued to mature and are aiming to support future activity increases, whether that be from DeFi or from gaming.

Is Bitcoin (and the crypto gang) getting a boost from all these shake-ups? Looking Ahead: So here\u2019s the lowdown: Some crypto gurus reckon Bitcoin might steal the show in 2023 and 2024, thanks to that halving event and more folks hopping on board. But on the flip side, there\u2019s chatter about potential dips, all because of those pesky rising interest rates and stricter money moves. Bottom line? The crypto rollercoaster ain\u2019t stopping anytime soon. Hold onto your hats!\n\nApeMax: The Talk of Crypto-Town\n\nIn case you\u2019ve been living under a rock and haven\u2019t heard of ApeMax yet, here\u2019s a quick look.

Folks are chattering about this hot crypto presale, so it\u2019s a cool chance to get the 411 on ApeMax!\n\nAre Crypto Predictions Fact or Fiction?\n\nNow, let\u2019s spill the tea. If we knew the exact trajectory of cryptos, we\u2019d all be sipping pina coladas on a private island. The world of price predictions is a mixed bag of data analysis, gut feelings, and let\u2019s face it, a bit of wishful thinking. But here\u2019s what\u2019s cool: Whether you\u2019re team #HODL or just crypto-curious, there\u2019s never a dull moment.\n\nWhat about AI and Crypto Predictions?\n\nTech heads are unleashing AI tools in the quest to predict crypto moves. From parsing tweets to analyzing market patterns, these digital soothsayers like Augur and Endor are on the case. Yet, they\u2019re not infallible. Remember, with cryptos, the only guarantee is volatility.\n\nWhy is it so hard to make good crypto predictions?\n\nLook, calling the crypto game ain\u2019t easy. Why? First, it\u2019s wild out there with all the ups and downs \u2013 that\u2019s volatility for you. Then, toss in a salad of stuff like what the big suits say (regulatory news), shiny tech upgrades, how the crypto crowd feels, and even the big world money moves. And, don\u2019t forget, big names like Bitcoin don\u2019t sleep \u2013 they\u2019re always on, so who knows when the next curveball comes? Plus, let\u2019s be real: crypto is still the new kid on the block. So, we\u2019re kinda learning as we go without much past info to guide us.\n\nFinal Words from the Wise: Tread Carefully with Crypto, Folks!\n\nLet\u2019s not sugarcoat it: the crypto world\u2019s got its risks, and they\u2019re big ones. We\u2019re talking about serious volatility and unpredictability here. So, if you\u2019re thinking of diving into the crypto pool, you\u2019d better double-check the depth first. Always do your homework\u2014like, deep-dive research\u2014and know the risks before you part with your cash. And hey, a heads up for our friends in the US, Canada, and some other places: ApeMax is not available in your countries. Best to hit up the ApeMax official site to see where the no-go zones are.

        "content": "With the continuous encroachment of the cryptocurrency industry into the mainstream, it is no surprise that the American financial technology mammoth Paypal (NASDAQ: PYPL) has supported payments via digital assets since 2020 and is now launching its own cryptocurrency, potentially boosting the adoption of the practice.\n\nAs it happens, PayPal has announced the rollout of PayPal USD (PYUSD), an ERC-20 United States dollar-pegged stablecoin issued by crypto firm Paxos Trust Company on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain and fully backed by USD deposits, short-term Treasuries, and similar cash equivalents, according to the company\u2019s press release published on August 7.\n\nPYUSD addition illustration. Source: Bloomberg/PayPal\n\nWhat this means\n\nSpecifically, the newest development will allow users to redeem PYUSD for dollars and other cryptocurrencies at any time on PayPal\u2019s network, as well as fund purchases, with availability on PayPal\u2019s popular payments app Venmo, coming soon. Once fully up and running, the latter feature will enable transfers of token holdings between PayPal and Venmo wallets. Third-party wallet compatibility with PYUSD outside the PayPal network is also pending.\n\nIn the words of PayPal\u2019s CEO Dan Schulman, who is preparing to step down in the coming months, the stablecoin will gradually become available to customers in the US, and the company\u2019s ultimate goal is to become the leader in digital payments using direct, fast, and cheaper transfer technology.\n\n\u201cThe vision over time is that this becomes a part of the overall payments infrastructure,\u201d Schulman said in an interview.\n\nPayPal and crypto\n\nIndeed, PayPal started its stablecoin work after the Department of Financial Services granted it a \u2018BitLicense,\u2019 issued to businesses working with digital assets. However, the work halted in February due to regulatory pressure on cryptos, which saw an investigation of Paxos for allegedly illegal sales of Binance USD (BUSD) that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) considers a security.\n\nHowever, the head of PayPal\u2019s blockchain and digital currencies team, Jose Fernandez da Ponte, said in an interview that his company now considers the regulatory environment \u201cprogressing toward more clarity\u201d and recognizes rising demand for an alternative stablecoin in a currently highly concentrated market.\n\nMeanwhile, PayPal has supported crypto payments for almost three years now, allowing its users to buy, sell, and hold Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto assets using its online wallets, as well as to pay for products and services in crypto, as Finbold reported on October 21, 2020."

In PoW blockchains like Bitcoin, miners compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles, with the first to solve it earning the right to add a new block to the blockchain. Once a block is added to the chain, other nodes in the network can easily verify the solution. PoW ensures the immutability and security of the blockchain, as altering a block would require redoing the work for all subsequent blocks, which becomes computationally infeasible as the chain grows. However, PoW consumes a considerable amount of energy, which has led to concerns about its environmental impact.\n\nWhat is Proof of Stake?\n\nProof of Stake (PoS) is an alternative consensus mechanism employed in various blockchains, including Ethereum. Unlike PoW, PoS does not rely on miners solving complex puzzles but rather on validators who are chosen to create new blocks, with the probability of being selected directly proportional to the number of coins staked. PoS is considered more energy-efficient than PoW as it eliminates the need for resource-intensive mining. Additionally, PoS encourages long-term participation and ownership, as validators have a financial incentive to act in the best interest of the network to avoid losing their staked coins. This consensus mechanism offers a more scalable solution for blockchain networks, reducing the environmental impact while maintaining security and decentralization.\n\nBitcoin Spark and the Proof of Process\n\nBitcoin Spark is a new Bitcoin fork that seeks to provide enhanced speed, security, and scalability. The project introduces an all-new consensus mechanism known as Proof of Process (PoP), which is a blend of Proof of Work and Proof of Stake. In this hybrid system, users are required to stake coins on the network. They must also provide processing power to the network, which is utilized by its clients for remote computing tasks with high CPU or GPU loads. The project\u2019s development team has created a user-friendly mining program that can be installed on Windows, Mac OS, Linux, iOS, and Android devices and enables users to mine by permitting secure, isolated access to their device\u2019s processing unit. The software itself adjusts how much of the device\u2019s processing power is used, thereby limiting the mining capacity by default. The work required, and energy used for block confirmation on Bitcoin Spark is thus relatively low.\n\nRewards within the Bitcoin Spark ecosystem are calculated based on a combination of the individual stake and the work done using the network as remote computing power. However, the PoP is combined with an algorithm that constrains linear rewards based on raw processing power or stake size. This fosters a more equitable distribution of rewards among network participants, ensuring that those with increased mining capabilities earn more but not in a way that is unbalanced purely by fiat-equivalent net worth. Additionally, distributing the blockchain validation across more devices and individuals reduces the risk of a single miner becoming too powerful, significantly increasing the security of the network.\n\nThe mining rewards also follow an elastic system based on revenue inflow, the price of BTCS, and the number of miners in the ecosystem. The revenue generated within the Bitcoin Spark network from CPU rental, advertisements, and other additional services supplements and reduces mining rewards. This causes the minting endpoint to move further away, leading to a self-sustaining revenue network where participants remain profitable with a limited and constant supply of BTCS.\n\nBy combining these and other innovative features, Bitcoin Spark aims to establish itself as a robust and efficient blockchain network, delivering enhanced scalability and sustainability while empowering a diverse range of network participants. Phase 1 of the Bitcoin Spark Initial Coin Offering (ICO) offers investors an opportunity to get BTCS at $1.05, along with a 20% bonus.\n\nFor more on Bitcoin Spark:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register"
