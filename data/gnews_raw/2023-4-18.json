        "content": "Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC appeared before Congress today to answer questions regarding his controversial tenure.\n\nAmong the questioners: Chair of the Financial Services Committee, Patrick McHenry.\n\nRegulators and prosecutors have been asserting, variously, that ether is a security (the attorney general of New York) or a commodity (the CFTC), or that it was a commodity in the past, but now they won\u2019t say (the SEC\u2019s director of corporate finance, William Hinman, said that neither ether nor bitcoin were securities in 2018).\n\nGiven that Gensler has spent considerable energy telling the digital asset industry that they have all the regulatory clarity they need, it\u2019s worth transcribing the interchange between the two men word-for-word, so that you can judge for yourself if Gensler was clear.\n\nMcHenry asked Gensler some very specific questions, including this one, regarding Ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n\u201cClearly an asset cannot be both a commodity and a security. Do you agree?\u201d\n\n\u201cUmmm, I\u2026 I\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 actually all securities are commodities under the Commodity and Exchange Act, it\u2019s that we\u2019re excluded commodities, but I would agree that a security cannot also be an excluded commodity and an included commodity, I\u2019m sorry chair, just to talk about the Commodity Exchange Act, more precisely.\u201d\n\nMcHenry did not appear to think this answer was an answer at all.\n\nHe followed up: \u201cI\u2019m asking you, sitting in your chair now, to make an assessment under the laws that exist: Is ether a commodity, or a security?\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout speaking to any one\u2026\u201d began Gensler.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve repeatedly said you won\u2019t speak to one,\u201d interrupted McHenry, \u201cBut you\u2019ve spoken to one: bitcoin. So I\u2019m asking you to speak to a second one, with the second largest market cap.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn speaking to the tokens,\u201d Gensler replied, \u201cThere\u2019s ten to twelve thousand, if there\u2019s a group of entrepreneurs\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking about one,\u201d interjected McHenry. \u201cI\u2019m asking you a specific question, Chair Gensler. I said this in private, this should be no shock to you that I\u2019m asking this question. Is ether a commodity, or a security?\u201d\n\nGensler: \u201cAnd again, it depends on the facts and the law on if there\u2019s a group of individuals\u2026\u201d\n\nMcHenry: \u201cI\u2019m asking about the facts and the law, sitting in your seat, and the judgment you are making.\u201d\n\nGensler: \u201cAnd so, Mr. Chair, I think you would not want me to prejudge\u2026\u201d\n\nMcHenry wasn\u2019t having it. \u201cBut you have prejudged on this. You\u2019ve taken 50 enforcement actions. We\u2019re finding out as we go, as you file suit, as people get Wells notices on what is a security in your view and your agency\u2019s view. I\u2019m asking you a very simple question about the second-largest digital asset. What is your view?\u201d\n\nOnce again, Gensler refused to answer. \u201cAnd my view is, if there\u2019s a group of individuals in the middle of it, the public is entitled\u2026\u201d\n\nMcHenry gave up and moved on.\n\nThere\u2019s your regulatory clarity.\n\nNow come in and register.\n\nYouTube / GOP Financial Services\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Crypto's Ethereum Network Completes Key Software Upgrade Without a Hitch - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Ether rallied past $2,000 for the first time since August after a widely anticipated software upgrade to the most commercially important blockchain went according to plan, and as worries of initial rapid outflows proved unfounded.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe so-called Shanghai, or Shapella, update enables investors to queue up to withdraw Ether coins they had pledged to help operate the Ethereum network in return for rewards, a process called staking. And so far, 96% of withdrawal volume has been from users withdrawing their rewards instead of their entire stakes, according to researcher Flipside Crypto.\n\nEther jumped as much as 6% to $2,023 on Thursday, taking it to levels not seen since May 2022. Its 68% year-to-date gain still trails Bitcoin\u2019s 84% gain. But there could be some additional upside if the size of withdrawals in the queue \u2014 now two weeks long, according to Rated Network Explorer \u2014 remains muted.\n\n\u201cThis could still be volatile,\u201d said Noelle Acheson, author of the \u201cCrypto Is Macro Now\u201d newsletter. \u201cThere is a queue forming for ETH withdrawals, and the looming sell pressure from Kraken, Celsius and others \u2014 that have to un-stake\u201d but the \u201coverall liquidity situation is favorable for crypto assets.\u201d\n\nCrypto exchange Kraken, which is discontinuing staking products in the US as part of a settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, dominated the initial exit queue, based on figures compiled by Rated.\n\nBut overall, the amount of Ether entering the market from Shanghai withdrawals is much lower than what was previously expected, said Grayscale Research analyst Matt Maximo. \u201cThe amount of new ETH being staked is also outpacing the withdrawals, which is creating added buy pressure to offset the withdrawn ETH.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAbout 1.2 million of Ether tokens \u2014 worth approximately $2.3 billion at current prices \u2014 was expected to be withdrawn over the next five days, according to researcher Coin Metrics. However, that represents just 6% of the roughly $36.7 billion of Ether locked up for staking, data from Staking Rewards shows.\n\nInvestors had been braced for crypto price swings around the upgrade, but so far digital-asset markets have been largely steady.\n\nSmaller coins from applications that try to make it easier to harness Ether staking rewards, such as Lido and Rocket Pool, advanced, according to CoinGecko data. LDO climbed 7.2% and RPL was up 11%, the data showed.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain in September last year transitioned to a proof-of-stake from a proof-of-work approach, a revamp called the Merge that slashed the network\u2019s electricity consumption.\n\nProof-of-stake uses piles of Ether \u2014 placed in special so-called staking wallets \u2014 to help order transactions on the Ethereum network. And with investors now able to withdraw staked funds \u2014 boosting the appeal of an Ether investment \u2014 a debate is stirring over whether Ethereum could someday replace Bitcoin as the world\u2019s largest digital currency.\n\n\u201cEthereum is updating and navigating with great skill \u2014 so far anyway \u2014 and cementing its position as the No. 2 crypto,\u201d said Aaron Brown, a crypto investor who writes for Bloomberg Opinion. The network is \u201cmoving to the future much faster than Bitcoin.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Sidhartha Shukla and Carly Wanna.\n\n(Updates price reactions and adds commentary in fourth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P."

        "content": "Ether (ETH) entered a sharp price recovery a week after hitting a six-month low versus Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nOn April 18, the widely-tracked ETH/BTC pair reached 0.0709 BTC, up about 15% from its local bottom of 0.0602 BTC six days ago. Now, the pair eyes a run-up toward 0.075 BTC by June, based on the fractal setup previously discussed here.\n\nETH/BTC daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shapella FOMO\n\nInterestingly, Ether\u2019s local bottom formation versus Bitcoin occurred on the day of Ethereum\u2019s long-awaited Shapella upgrades.\n\nThe hard fork enables Ether stakers to withdraw their rewards \u2014 around 1.1 billion ETH \u2014 from Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake smart contract. This update may have boosted ETH\u2019s appeal compared to BTC, beating anticipations that a freshly unlocked Ether supply would increase sell pressure.\n\nStakers have withdrawn 574,700 ETH \u2014 worth about $1.21 billion \u2014 since the Shapella upgrades on April 12, according to data fetched by Nansen. Interestingly, Ether\u2019s price in U.S. dollar terms has increased by 14.25% in the same period.\n\nETH deposits vs. withdrawals. Source: Nansen\n\nIt means that many stakers have decided to hold onto their Ether rewards. On the other hand, Bitcoin has failed to log a decisive breakout above its technical resistance of $30,000, possibly making ETH a more attractive short-term bet for traders.\n\nWeak institutional inflows versus Bitcoin\n\nInstitutional investors have shown more interest in Bitcoin than Ether in the past week, according to CoinShares\u2019 weekly report.\n\nFor instance, Bitcoin-based investment vehicles witnessed $103.8 million in inflows in the week ending April 14. In comparison, Ethereum funds attracted $300,000, showing that mainstream investors may have followed the \u201csell the news\u201d strategy after the Shapella upgrades.\n\nNet flows into crypto funds. Source: CoinShares\n\nEther\u2019s price, meanwhile, is also at risk of a possible bearish reversal move due to its overbought daily relative strength index.\n\nRelated: Shapella could bring institutional investors to Ethereum despite risks\n\nIf ETH price retreats from its current resistance level of around $2,140, its immediate downside target appears at around $1,984, which acted as resistance in May 2022 and August 2022.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nAn extended sell-off could push Ether price down to its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave) near $1,800, down about 15% from its current price levels.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

It\u2019s that we are excluded commodities. But I would agree that a security cannot be also an excluded commodity and an included commodity,\u201d responded Gensler.\n\nRegulators and prosecutors have held contrasting views on how to classify Ether. The Attorney General of New York recently called it a security, but the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Rostin Behnam argued that it is a commodity.\n\nGensler hinted on multiple occasions that he may view cryptocurrencies based on the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, such as Ether, as securities.\n\nIn May 2022, Gensler publicly labeled Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, as a commodity.\n\nGensler told the HFSC on Tuesday that the SEC needs more resources and bodies to regulate the crypto asset class.\n\nLate last month, Gensler testified before the Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government and requested US$2.4 billion in funding from Congress for the agency\u2019s operations, which includes its cryptocurrency crackdown.\n\nSee related story: SEC chair Gensler: No plans to ban crypto, says it\u2019s \u2018up to Congress\u2019\n\n(Updates to fifth and eighth graph)"

It was the fourth week in a row of inflows.\n\n\u201cThis four-week run of inflows now total US$345 million, almost fully correcting the prior six-week run of outflows that totalled US$408 million,\u201d the CoinShares report said. \u201cWe believe this is a flight to safety by investors fearful of the ongoing traditional finance challenges.\u201d\n\nDevelopers of the Ethereum blockchain on April 12 updated the network with new features including allowing the withdrawal of staked Ether.

        "content": "Rocket Pool, the Ethereum-based DeFi staking protocol, has just pushed a major update granting users instant access to ETH staking rewards moving forward.\n\nAtlas, which launched without issue Monday evening, brings changes and features following the successful rollout of Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade last week. Shapella enabled ETH stakers to withdraw their crypto for the first time.\n\nThis meant Rocket Pool could lower Ethereum staking amounts for its so-called \u201cminipools.\u201d These tailored validator nodes now accept ETH stakes as small as 8 ETH ($16,800), down from 16 ETH ($33,600).\n\nStaking individually to the Ethereum blockchain demands at least 32 ETH ($67,100). Rocket Pool also supports pooling of ETH to boost chances of earning greater rewards.\n\n\u201cAtlas has two themes, withdrawals and scaling Rocket Pool,\u201d the team said in an Atlas live stream. \u201cNode operators can now access their rewards they\u2019ve generated over the last 14 months \u2026 if they want to, they can exit completely.\u201d\n\nAtlas brings with it automatic rewards distributions, a unified Grafana dashboard and support for an Ethereum consensus client known as Lodestar.\n\nRocket Pool users can separately stake any amount of ETH to receive a liquid staking derivative token, rETH. Similar to other staking services such as Lido, Rocket Pool\u2019s minipools and rETH let investors with less capital participate in the staking process to earn rewards otherwise out of reach.\n\nFurther changes made it easier to engage with the Ethereum blockchain by providing greater flexibility in Beacon Chain management, the team said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Ethereum layer 2s, such as Optimism, Arbitrum and Polygon, increased in popularity in the first quarter of 2023, according to a report from Web3 development platform Alchemy. Over 635,000 Ethereum users bridged crypto assets to these networks from January to March, an increase of 44% over the fourth quarter of 2023 and 518% over the first quarter of 2022.\n\nThe report, titled simply \u201cWeb3 Development Report,\u201d cited Dune Analytics as its source for this data. It showed that only 103,000 users made bridging transactions to layer 2s in the first quarter of 2022, whereas the same three months saw over 635,000 users perform these transactions.\n\nAlchemy suggested that this increased activity may have been reinforced by successful airdrops from Optimism and Arbitrum in Q1, 2023.\n\nIn addition to increased asset bridging from users, layer 2s also showed greater activity from developers. Although the deployment of smart contracts related to layer 2s decreased by 30% relative to Q4 2022, it still increased by 160% when compared to Q1, 2022, the report said.\n\nThe crypto industry is coming off the back of a steep downturn in trading volume and crypto prices during 2022, with scandals like the UST depegging and FTX collapse causing many investors to shy away. But despite this negative sentiment, users still flocked to these new scalability solutions.\n\nRelated: 3 signs Arbitrum price is poised for a new record high in Q2\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem as a whole also showed increased developer interest. Ethereum software development kits (SDKs) such as Ethers.js, Web3.js, Hardhat and Web3.py were downloaded 1.3 million times in Q1 2022. This became 1.9 million in the first quarter of 2023, an 8% increase. In addition, downloads of the MetaMask SDK, a tool used to develop apps that can interact with Ethereum wallet MetaMask, increased in each month of the first quarter.\n\nEthereum layer 2s have been offered as a solution to Ethereum\u2019s scalability problem, which has been periodically causing high gas fees since as early as 2020. Some experts have argued that sharding the Ethereum network will also help to cut down on gas fees.\n\nThis story was updated on April 18 to clarify that the number of users bridging has increased by 518%, not the amount of assets bridged."

        "title": "Aurox Makes it Simpler to Transact on Ethereum - Blockworks",
        "content": "Aurox wallet users will no longer need to hold ether to make transactions on the blockchain.\n\nOn Ethereum today, token swapping involves users having to hold ether (ETH) in their wallets so that they can pay for gas fees which will execute the transactions. This can be a confusing experience for users who are not yet familiar with the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nTo resolve this pain point, web brower extension-based Aurox Wallet has partnered with Chainlink to enable its users to pay gas fees in any ERC-20 token instead of paying for the cost in ETH.\n\nIn an interview with Blockworks, Aurox CEO Giorgi Khazaradze explains that one of the biggest challenges he came across when he first dabbled into the blockchain technology space was not understanding that he needed to hold certain tokens in order to make transactions on-chain.\n\n\u201cI wanted to send USDC to my developer and I couldn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t have any ETH \u2014 I think a big holdup on people that are entering into DeFi is they don\u2019t realize that one tiny thing can basically make your wallet useless,\u201d Khazaradze said. \u201cSo we developed a version where even if you set up a brand new wallet, you deposit your USDC into it, you can swap that USDC in the wallet\u2026you don\u2019t ever have to touch ETH at all.\u201d\n\nUnlike many of its competitors, Aurox Wallet will not be following the ERC-2771 token standard Khazaradze notes.\n\nERC-2771 requires users to approve transactions for the ERC20 token, which means they are still required to cough up ETH for network fees.\n\nAs it currently stands, only tokens such as DAI allow users to execute transactions without paying an approval transaction fee, Khazarade said.\n\nInstead, Aurox Wallet will be using Flashbots to bundle and approve transactions.\n\nFor example, if a user is trying to swap USDC for USDT, a bundled transaction will be sent to the Flashbots \u200b\u200bRemote Procedure Call (RPC) and the transactions will be executed within the same block in three separate transactions:\n\nTransfer: ETH would be transferred from Aurox\u2019s hot wallet to the user\u2019s wallet if they do not hold any ETH.\n\nApproval: if necessary.\n\nSwap: The input token will be converted to ETH and paid back to Aurox for enabling the initial ETH transaction.\n\nPrices will be executed based on Chainlink Price Feeds to ensure users are getting accurate rates sourced from multiple different exchanges.\n\nAlthough multiple swaps will likely increase transaction fees, an Aurox GitHub post notes that these fees are offset by benefits such as Flashbots protecting users from being frontrun by MEV bots and is still relatively cheaper than paying trading and withdrawal fees on centralized exchanges.\n\nIt also notes that transactions are instant, meaning it is much faster than bridging tokens from another blockchain. Transferring ETH from another Web3 wallet is the only method that could be cheaper \u2014 albeit by a small margin.\n\nUltimately, Khazarade believes this new Aurox wallet feature will be able to eliminate \u201ca pretty serious user experience problem for retail users.\u201d\n\nA mobile version of the wallet along with hardware wallet support is planned.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH At Risk As Staker Sell-Off Concerns Emerge - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has been oscillating around the $2,100 level for the past four days as the Shapella upgrade excitement fades away. There are emergent signals of stakers positioning themselves for sell-action, as revealed by on-chain metrics. Traders are now concerned about the ability of the buyers to defend the immediate support level at $2,000.\n\nEthereum Stakers Are Ready To Offload\n\nFollowing an initial positive reaction to the successful Ethereum Shapella upgrade, the second largest altcoin by market capitalization now faces an uncertain short-term future. According to data from Glassnode, the supply of ETH deposited on exchanges has increased by more than 100,000 Ether since April 10. This is an indication that holders are seeking to sell their tokens, which can happen faster and easier when it is on the trading platforms.\n\nThe chart below shows that Ethereum balance on exchanges increased by 0.6% from 18.09 million ETH on April 13 (a day after stETH withdrawal was enabled) to 18.20 million ETH on April 17.\n\nNote that when crypto assets are held on exchanges, it makes them readily available for trading, and with Ethereum stakers pulling out their coins from the Beacon Chain, they could accumulate overhead pressure. Such an outcome could provoke a potential pullback in the next few days.\n\nAdditionally, an evaluation of the aggregate order books from different exchanges shows that the number of Ether available for sale at the moment is far more than the demand at the current market rates. On-chain data by IntoTheBlock reveals that there are open sell-orders for 6 million ETH around the +/-30% price boundaries. However, as it stands, buyers have only placed orders for around 5.2 million ETH.\n\nWhen exchange order books record more sell orders than buy orders, it usually means there is higher supply than demand for the asset.\n\nTherefore, the influx of Ethereum coins on exchanges, a sign of selling momentum accumulated possibly due to newly unstaked coins, and unbalanced exchange order books could all play out, triggering a sell-off in Ethereum price.\n\nEthereum Price At Risk Of 9% Losses\n\nETH was trading at $2,101, up 0.34% on the day, with a 24-hour trading volume of $9.23 billion. The largest altcoin was trading within a significant supply stretching from $1,900 to $2,150. If the price volatility remains the same, the Ethereum price could remain within this area for some time.\n\nThis means, a daily candlestick close below the $2,000 psychological level could see ETH drop toward the $1,900 defense level. This would represent a 9.4% drop from the current price. This could be where Ethereum\u2019s downside is capped for the short-term.\n\nHowever, incase of immense selling, Ethereum could drop below $1,900 to revisit the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $1,768, the 100-day SMA at $1,678, and the 200-day SMA at $1,486.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum was trading above these SMAs, suggesting that it sat on relatively strong support that could absorb any selling pressure. In addition, the RSI was pointing upward and was positioned in the positive region at 70, reinforcing the buyers\u2019 grip on the price.\n\nAs such, a daily candlestick close above the upper limit of the supply zone at $2,150 would confirm a bullish breakout for ETH. Such a move would bolster Ethereum toward $2,500 representing a 19.5% uptick from the current levels.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

As a result, BNB trades at $345, DOGE is above $0.9, SOL is at $25, and LTC is inches away from $100.\n\nAvalanche has soared by 6% in a day and over 15% in a week to exceed $20.\n\nThe total crypto market cap has remained at essentially the same spot as yesterday at $1.265 trillion on CMC."

        "content": "New data from crypto insights firm Messari shows the Cardano (ADA) ecosystem\u2019s rapid expansion over the last year.\n\nIn a new report, Messari says that Cardano\u2019s total value locked (TVL), or the amount of assets sitting within its protocols, has gone up 172% quarter over quarter (QoQ).\n\nAccording to Messari, the recent launch of Cardano-stablecoins were the main drivers behind the growth.\n\n\u201cTotal value locked (TVL) denominated in USD on Cardano grew 172% QoQ from $50.8 million to $138.3 million. The recent adoption of new stablecoins was a catalyst for this growth, as they are a cornerstone of DeFi but were missing from the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nMessari says that Minswap, an automated market maker (AMM) on Cardano, remains the chain\u2019s leading decentralized exchange (DEX) as far as TVL, but decreased in dominance over the first quarter due to the emergence of several DeFi (decentralized finance) protocols, including ADA-backed stablecoin Djed.\n\n\u201cThe shift in dominance from incumbent DEXs to emerging DeFi applications is due to:\n\nDjed, an overcollateralized ADA-backed stablecoin minting protocol, ending Q1 with a TVL of $13.1 million and a dominance of 9.5%.\n\nLiqwid, a borrowing and lending protocol, ending Q1 with a TVL of $8.4 million and a dominance of 6%.\n\nIndigo, an issuer of synthetic assets and stablecoins, ending Q1 with a TVL of $24.1 million and a dominance of 17.4%.\u201d\n\nMessari says that in Q1 of this year, Cardano saw significant progress in technological developments such as advancements in scalability and VM (virtual machine) compatibility.\n\nLast week, Cardano developers Input Output Global announced the launch of Lace, a new Cardano-native crypto wallet that supports hardware wallet integration and access to NFT (non-fungible token) marketplaces, decentralized apps (DApps) and DeFi services. Users can also stake ADA directly from the platform.\n\nThe developers say they are already working on new features that will be added to future releases as they promise to give Lace a slew of regular updates and enhancements.\n\n\u201cThe Lace team is already hard at work developing a DApp Store, a desktop app and digital identity solutions. Meanwhile, fiat on/off ramps, in-wallet swaps, a richer staking experience with multi-delegation, and a portfolio view are all in the pipeline.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "U.S. House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry pressed SEC Chair Gary Gensler to give a definitive answer about his stance on Ethereum.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler repeatedly dodged the question on whether Ethereum is a security or a commodity.\n\nIn an April 18 hearing before the House Financial Services Committee, Gensler was questioned by the Committee\u2019s chair Patrick McHenry on his stance on the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nMcHenry referenced prior statements made by former Director of the SEC\u2019s Corporate Finance Division Bill Hinman that ETH was not a security (which would make it a commodity), and statements last month from the CFTC Chair Rostin Benham that ETH was a commodity against a contradictory one by NYAG Letitia James that ETH was a security.\n\n\u201cClearly an asset cannot be both a commodity and a security. Do you agree?\u201d McHenry asked Gensler.\n\n\u201cActually, all securities are commodities under the Commodity Exchange Act. It\u2019s that we are excluded commodities. But I would agree that a security cannot be also an excluded commodity and an included commodity,\u201d Gensler responded.\n\nMcHenry then asked Gensler to make an assessment, under the laws that exist today, to categorize Ether as either a commodity or a security.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve repeatedly said you\u2019re not going to speak to one, except you\u2019ve spoken to one: Bitcoin. So I\u2019m asking you to speak to the second-largest [cryptocurrency] by market cap here,\u201d McHenry said.\n\nGensler alluded to the \u201cten to twelve thousand\u201d tokens that exist today, seemingly intending to make a point about a group of entrepreneurs that launch a token with the intent of making a profit, but McHenry pressed him to specifically answer the question he posed.\n\nWhen Gensler attempted to avoid giving a direct answer again, saying he did not want to \u201cpre-judge\u201d on the subject, McHenry pointed out that he had in fact done so by bringing 50 enforcement actions against crypto firms.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re finding out as we go, as you file suit, as people get Wells notices, on what is a security in your view, in your agency\u2019s view,\u201d said McHenry.\n\nIn March, The Block reported that Gensler suggested that Proof-of-Stake tokens, a category that Ethereum now falls under, are securities. In his view, the concept of users locking up tokens in a protocol with the anticipation of profit would put those token operators under the purview of the agency."

        "content": "The TON Foundation \u2013 a non-profit association of developers and enthusiasts behind The Open Network (TON) \u2013 has announced the rolling out of a two-way bridge to facilitate the transfer of ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum to natively wrapped fungible tokens (Jettons) on TON.\n\nAccording to the press release shared with CryptoPotato, the bridge is designed to offer a seamless transactional interface between Ethereum and TON. This marks a \u201csignificant milestone\u201d in the evolution of the TON ecosystem.\n\nFirst Unlimited Bridge Goes Live\n\nThe new offering, touted as \u2013 the first unlimited bridge \u2013 will help users to bridge Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), Tether tokens (USDt), USD Coin (USDC), and Dai (DAI). At launch, users will only be able to bridge over four assets. Going forward, the TON Foundation intends to make more tokens available for bridging soon.\n\nThe foundation has welcomed white hat hackers to test the security integrity of the unlimited bridge through a hackathon in 2022.\n\nThe announcement further revealed that audits from prominent blockchain security firm CertiK, \u0430 smart contract auditor, Quantstamp, a specialist auditor in the blockchain space, and Hexens, a smart contract auditor, were made on the bridge.\n\nWhile validators voted on the formation, CertiK and Quantstamp conducted end-to-end audits on the TON blockchain. Commenting on the development, Justin Hyun, Head of Incubation at TON Foundation, said:\n\n\u201cWe are delighted with the introduction of this two-way bridge, the first unlimited bridge to go live on TON. We anticipate that this bridge will bring a host of new users to the TON ecosystem. By entering into closer proximity with other layer one blockchains through such bridges, our users will experience the advantages that TON holds over its competitors.\u201d\n\nTether Integration\n\nThe latest development comes less than a month after Telegram added a new feature enabling users to send each other the world\u2019s largest stablecoin, Tether, on the Tron blockchain.\n\nThe new feature enabled users to buy, swap, and make P2P trades with TRC20 by expanding the app\u2019s facility for crypto payments. This also allowed users on the instant messaging service to directly send USDT to their peers with no transaction fees."

        "title": "Crypto Price Predictions 2023: Why Bitcoin Price pump to $60k, Ethereum Price will surge past $6k, and Love Hate Inu ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "We are currently experiencing market conditions we have not seen since we first started to come out of the pandemic. 2023 has truly been a blessing for the market after it experienced one of its worst periods ever at the back end of 2022.\n\nThe new year began with a bull run and it has been a case of start as you mean to go on for the market as a whole. Sure there have been some blips along the way but generally things have been pointing upward. The emergence of presales as successful as Love Hate Inu (LHINU) and the recovery of traditional giants Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) shows how the growth is really market-wide and indicates this is not a flash in the pan thing and should continue through Q2 and beyond.\n\nThere was a lot of caution preached after the first bull run of the year that it likely wasn\u2019t sustainable and even as Bitcoin and Ethereum continued to grow after the run on traditional banks some experts were still saying the growth would slow due to interest rate hikes. Well, that hasn\u2019t been the case and even though news coming from the feds suggests rates will still not be slashed by Q3 there is still positive buzz around the market.\n\n>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nWhy BTC and ETH will not stop pumping\n\nNow even the most skeptical of analysts are starting to change their tone. There has been too much growth market-wide to dismiss it as anything other than real. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are the market\u2019s two biggest currencies so their price movement tends to be mirrored by the market as a whole. It is their continued positive movement that has won over the doubters.\n\nIn the chart above we can see Bitcoin\u2019s growth over the last 3 months. This is the reason many believe it can return to the heights of 2021 and finally break $60,000 again. It has already seen growth of over 55% since the start of the year and that\u2019s even after the disappointment of interest not being slashed as they were predicted to be at the start of the year.\n\nSo imagine what will happen to the price once these rates finally slow and are cut? The price will likely go through the roof! This is on top of the news that has been consistently flowing in from around the world about countries softening their views of Bitcoin and many taking steps toward hiring regulators so as to introduce it to their markets in the future.\n\nWhen we take all the above into consideration and the fact that eventually, inflation rates will have to stop, we think $60,000 might even be a modest marker for Bitcoin in the next few years.\n\n>>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum has been experiencing growth due to events happening within the ecosystem. On April 12th the long-awaited Shanghai upgrade took place. This was the first time ETH holders could finally withdraw the native currency and any rewards they had incurred.\n\nSome experts feared this would plummet the price of ETH due to a mass withdrawal of funds but it looks like it has mostly been the rewards that have been withdrawn. This of course strengthens Ethereum\u2019s position as clearly, their holders believe in the project long-term.\n\nJust looking at the chart above we can see nearly 75% growth in just the last 3 months alone. Just like with Bitcoin, the $6k barrier actually feels like it will be broken by Ethereum a lot sooner than many would have thought a little while ago.\n\nWhile these traditional giants look set to continue to pump the presale of Love Hate Inu (LHINU) is gathering a similar amount of attention, let\u2019s see why!\n\n>>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nLove Hate Inu- Meme coin set to break $2 once launched\n\nIt is nearly unheard of that a presale coin would be in the news as much as coins like Ethereum and Bitcoin, but Love Hate Inu (LHINU) is no ordinary coin and it represents the most exciting project on the market right now.\n\n>>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nThe presale is still not even two months old and already it has raised over $4.5 million. Why is this the best investment opportunity right now? Well, firstly it\u2019s the very first meme coin/V2E platform meaning it will have the virality of a meme coin and the utility of a staking coin. We think that once launched it will easily pump to $2 and beyond.\n\nOne look at the site now and you will see why experts and influencers can\u2019t dedicate enough words to this crypto. For example, it is showing its future users the kind of polls they will be able to vote on, they have a \u2018do you love or hate celebrity x\u2019 poll currently to view. Each celebrity is represented by a hilarious angel and devil meme version of themselves.\n\n>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nThis of course will draw in the influencers but the experts have been drawn in by the very comprehensive white paper. Love Hate Inu is really thinking about the future and security of their project. 90 percent of the total coin allocation will be sold at presale to prevent a dodgy rug pull from happening once the coin goes to its CEX listings, this also ensures only the real LHINU lovers will have a say in any future company decisions.\n\n>>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nIf you weren\u2019t sold on Love Hate Inu being the best investment opportunity on the market they also put their user\u2019s experience to the forefront. A stake-2-vote system will be implemented that requires users to stake LHINU for 30 days before they can vote. This in turn ensures a voter\u2019s anonymity which will also be useful in the discussion platform that will be available under polls.\n\nThe more you stake the more control you will have over these polls. Also, in the future, users will be able to suggest and run their own polls. This is to harvest a community vibe and the users will need to put forward their own LHINU to run the poll. There can then be a lively discussion about what polls should go on the site, giving a lot of the power to the users.\n\nThe price of LHINU once launched will be $0.000145 so predicting a growth spurt to $2 is ambitious. However, the market has not seen a meem coin with its capabilities before so we think it will blow the competition out of the market and soar past $2 in the future.\n\n>>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nConclusion\n\nIt seems to be good news all around for the crypto market, we have incredibly successful presales like Love Hate Inu ongoing, and traditional giants Bitcoin and Ethereum look set to reach previous highs. Of all 3 Love Hate Inu is by far the best investment opportunity, its room to grow is far bigger than the other two and it can be bought at a rock bottom price meaning investors can stockpile it before it pumps.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The Ethereum blockchain underwent a successful Shapella upgrade on April 12, allowing validators to withdraw their staked Ether (ETH) from the Beacon Chain after three years. After seeing over 1 million ETH in withdrawals in the first week, the amount of staked ETH has now surpassed the number of ETH being withdrawn for the first time since the Shapella upgrade.\n\nData from the on-chain analytics firm Nansen suggests that more ETH is currently being staked than withdrawn. As of April 17, the ETH staking volume of 124,000 ETH exceeded the withdrawal volume of 64,800 ETH for the first time. In the last 24 hours, the amount of staked ETH was 94,968 against 27,076 in withdrawals. The first round was primarily partial withdrawals from Lido and old validators. It takes approximately three days to get into the withdrawal queue.\n\nVolume of staked ETH vs withdrawals. Source: Nansen\n\nThe Shapella upgrade was projected as a make-or-break situation for the Ethereum blockchain as millions in unlocked ETH posed a risk of mass selling. However, the majority of the validators are restaking their unlocked Ether. Crypto exchange Binance will open withdrawals on April 19.\n\nRelated: Ethereum price metrics hint that ETH might not sell off after the Shapella hard fork\n\nOut of the 1 million withdrawn ETH, three addresses restaked a total of 19,844 ETH. Three addresses transferred ETH to centralized exchanges (CEXs) after withdrawal, with 71,444 ETH sent to different exchanges. Other whales did the same, with some sending it to Huobi staking addresses and a few others to CEXs, according to data shared by Lookonchain.\n\nMost early withdrawals are staking rewards, and a few validators, like Kraken, had to exit to comply with a United States Securities and Exchange Commission ruling. Currently, 22,231 validators have signed up for a complete exit out of 574,624, while 910,930 ETH of the 18.6 million staked ETH is slated to be withdrawn.\n\nAnother prominent reason for the diminishing withdrawals could be ETH\u2019s price, as the average price of staked ETH is about $2,137.\n\nMagazine: 2023 is a make-or-break year for blockchain gaming: Play-to-own"

        "content": "The long-awaited Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai update finally happened. The final step of Ethereum\u2019s transition from proof of work to proof of stake pushed Ethereum\u2019s price up by $2,000.\n\nThis is the first time Ethereum\u2019s price has pumped this much in eight months, reaching the highest level since March 2022. Now, Ethereum price predictions say this second-largest crypto could reach a maximum of $3,380.14 this year.\n\nWhether or not these real increases will happen is yet to be seen, but experts agree this price pump will affect other Ethereum-based cryptos too.\n\nIn particular, Tamadoge, as one of the well-known Ethereum-based cryptos, could face exponential growth.\n\nExperts think this meme crypto could even outperform Ethereum and become one of the best cryptos to invest in this year. Moreover, the project is on a fast track to dethroning Shiba Inu and Dogecoin as the most successful meme coin, thanks to its cutting-edge technology and powerful tokenomics.\n\nHere is a short overview of everything happening in the Tamadoge universe lately.

Tamadoge will confirm the name of the exchange on April 24th, a few days before the listing.\n\nThe announcement will set the Tamadoge\u2019s price to a bullish movement. Crypto experts believe this new listing will push TAMA\u2019s price above $0.0133.\n\nThis listing would make this meme project available to millions of new investors worldwide. TAMA\u2019s price could break the $0.22 level and jump by over 120%, looking mid-term.\n\n>>>Buy Tamadoge Now<<<\n\nPotential new high on the horizon\n\nZooming in on TAMA\u2019s long-term price, there are three potential price targets: $0.0225 (66% gain), $0.034 (156% gain), and $0.042 (234% gain).\n\nTamadoge had the first price pump after the OKX listing. Then, TAMA\u2019s price hit an all-time high of $0.196. But since then, Tamadoge has established itself as the best P2E platform.\n\nThis leads to price sustainability and new price pumps, especially after the positive news about the project.\n\nThe listing on the top-tier exchange is just the first step in the process of making Tamadoge the meme coin of the future. The exchange listing, combined with investors\u2019 loyalty to the project and positive project fundamentals, can take TAMA to a new price high.\n\n>>>Buy Tamadoge Now<<<\n\n22k users are enjoying Tamadoge P2E Arcade\n\nTamadoge recently released Play 2 Earn Arcade with five games players can access to earn rewards:\n\nRocket Doge \u2013 A game in which you navigate your Tamadoge through obstacles using rockets.\n\nSuper Doge \u2013 Your Tamadoge pets must collect in-game coins while battling enemies.\n\nTo the Moon \u2013 You must take your Tamadoge to the moon or new heights.\n\nTamadoge Run \u2013 Set in the graveyard, Tamadoge pet must fight ghosts and doge devils.\n\nTama Blast \u2013 Your Tamadoge must score as many goals as possible\n\nAs of April 13th, 22k users played on the Tamadoge Arcade and spent over 84,000 credits in the ecosystem.\n\n>>>Buy Tamadoge Now<<<\n\nWhat makes Tamadoge a terrific investment option?\n\nTamadoge is the first meme coin with utility that provides real value for users.\n\nThis is the token of the future.

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThe House Financial Services Committee is holding a hearing to perform oversight of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Republicans on the committee have stated that they are dedicated to holding Chair Gensler responsible for his strategy of regulating the digital asset ecosystem through enforcement, his reckless regulatory agenda, and his disregard for the Commission\u2019s capital formation mandate.\n\nWhen questioned about the status of Ethereum as to whether it is a security or commodity. Gensler falters before the house.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler Gets Grilled On Crypto Regulation In The U.S. House Hearing\n\nIn his opening remarks, Representative Patrick McHenry brought up the commission\u2019s \u201cpunishing\u201d of companies who deal in digital assets through regulation and enforcement without a clear route to compliance. The congressman renewed proposals for legislation that would provide \u201cclear rules of the road\u201d for cryptocurrency.\n\nFurther, to Chairman McHenry\u2019s dismay, the SEC Chair evaded a direct response when Gensler inquired if Ethereum (ETH) was a security or a commodity. The Chair of the House Committee repeatedly questioned Gensler about ETH in particular given the 50 enforcement actions, to which Gensler attempted to respond in a generic manner by saying, \u201cIt depends on the facts of the law.\u201d\n\nGensler\u2019s vague comments were repeatedly highlighted by McHenry, who cited the SEC chair\u2019s desire to classify Bitcoin as a commodity and hinted at earlier, private discussions on ETH before the hearing.\n\n\u201cClearly an asset cannot be both a commodity and a security,\u201d said McHenry. \u201cI\u2019m asking you, sitting in your chair now, to make an assessment under the laws as exist, is Ether a commodity or a security?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have pre-judged on this: you\u2019ve taken 50 enforcement actions. We\u2019re finding out as we go, as you file suit, as people get Wells notices, on what is security in your view, in your agency\u2019s view.\u201d\n\nGensler had previously stated in his pre-hearing testimony that cryptocurrency intermediates were engaging in securities transactions and should register with the SEC. An all-Republican coalition of lawmakers challenged this position in a letter denouncing the SEC\u2019s viewpoints. Regulatory frameworks that are incompatible with the underlying technology and inapplicable to laws governing the issuing of securities, according to the letter, were imposed on crypto businesses by the SEC.\n\nCommunity Reactions\n\nThe crypto community, which has long criticized Gary Gensler\u2019s leadership of the SEC and its policies, has praised the inquiries made by Rep. Patrick McHenry.\n\nSome have said that Gensler ought to be removed from his role as SEC chairman immediately and should be replaced by somebody with more industry knowledge."

Moreover, the hearing before the House Financial Services Committee regarded potential SEC oversight in regulatory action taken against the digital asset industry.\n\nWithin his pre-hearing testimony, Gensler restated his opinion that crypto assets are compatible with existing securities laws.

Furthermore, they did so without laying out clear rules of operation for stakeholders.\n\nSpecifically, McHerny stated, \u201cPunishing crypto market companies when not clearly mentioning rules as to how they should comply is not ideal. Regulation by enforcement is not sustainable. Moreover, Republican lawmakers opposed Gensler\u2019s approach to crypto regulation in a new letter arriving ahead of today\u2019s testimony."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe secret to making it in crypto is by investing at the earliest stages of a project that is loaded with potential for future growth, is a game-changer in the industry or innovates entire sectors. Uwerx (WERX) presale token is likewise drawing attention from various types of crypto investors.\n\nUwerx (WERX) ready to rally in 2023\n\nUwerx (WERX) is launching the first decentralized freelance marketplace that aims to improve on existing platforms like Upwork and Fiverr \u2013\u2013 but with the added bonus of paying minimal transaction fees, more robust data and intellectual property protections, and more transparent and immutable recordkeeping practices. Uwerx (WERX) is tapping into the lucrative $1 trillion gig economy.\n\nWhile investing in Ethereum Classic (ETC) or Ethereum (ETH) might be good long-term picks, Uwerx (WERX) presents an infinitely higher upside.\n\nCrypto analysts believe that Uwerx has ensured the Web3-enabled freelance marketplace platform's long-term success by first passing an audit from InterFi Network and Solidproof, and then by locking liquidity on the platform for 25 years after the presale concludes. Additionally, contract ownership will also be renounced before the project is listed on centralized exchanges.\n\nEthereum (ETH) looks promising in 2023\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a decentralized smart contract platform that supports a robust ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). Investors have been loading up on Ethereum (ETH) at its low rates, in the hope that Ethereum (ETH) can manage to go on a big run in 2023. As predicted, Ethereum is now above $2,073; in our opinion, ETH is going to keep climbing.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) stays resilient\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) is a decentralized smart contract platform launched in 2015. Ethereum Classic (ETC) has enjoyed price appreciation associated with its cousin, Ethereum (ETH), because of its status as the \"original\" blockchain of provenance. Ethereum Classic (ETC) enjoyed all-time highs of $176 at its peak in 2021, but is, as of this writing, trading at the $20-$22 levels.\n\nAccording to analysts, current Ethereum Classic (ETC) price action indicates a decline in the token's usage, with Ethereum Classic (ETC) holders dropping significantly since the 2021 peak. In fact, in January 2023, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase delisted Ethereum Classic (ETC) on its platform due to low usage.\n\nUwerx (WERX) might see upsurge in 2023\n\nRemote work is no longer just a trend \u2013 it is a reality, along with freelancing. This trend is not going to end as we move to a post-pandemic world. With tens of millions of freelancers expected to join its global ranks, Uwerx (WERX) has all the chances to grow in prominence and value over time.\n\n\n\nPresale: invest.uwerx.network\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/uwerx_network\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/uwerx_network"

        "title": "A Comparison Of Cardano, Ethereum, And Big Eyes Coin In The Quest For Enhanced Value And Utility - Atalayar EN",
        "content": "In recent months, the cryptocurrency market has experienced a surge of interest, with investors keeping a close eye on market developments during the current bullish run. One cryptocurrency that has been garnering widespread attention is Cardano, a blockchain platform that promises to bring added value to the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. It's worth noting that discussions related to Cardano typically bring up Ethereum and Big Eyes Coin (BIG).\n\nTherefore, this piece aims to provide a comprehensive comparison of the three leading contenders in the crypto industry, namely Cardano, Ethereum, and Big Eyes Coin. Each offers unparalleled value and utility to its diverse user base. We will examine their respective price projections, and updates, and take a quick trip down memory lane to explore their backgrounds.\n\nThe Crypto Dominators\n\nETH: Dominating The NFT Market\n\nEthereum is a decentralized platform that permits the development and deployment of decentralized applications, and it is renowned for its smart contract feature. The platform has become a popular choice for DeFi applications. The most recent upgrade, known as \"Shapella,\" or the Shanghai Upgrade, introduced the ability for users to withdraw their assets and access their cryptocurrencies more efficiently. Improvements were also made to sharding, EVM, and EOF. The main feature of the update is the ability for validator staking withdrawals on the main network.\n\nCardano, The Blockchain Aimed At Empowering Change-Makers\n\nCardano, founded by Charles Hoskinson in 2015, is a blockchain platform that operates on a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, with a focus on providing a secure and scalable platform for decentralized applications, while bringing DeFi to a wider audience. Although Cardano has faced criticism over delays and network updates, it remains committed to expanding its influence in West Africa.\n\nBig Eyes Coin: Progressing Beyond Meme Recognition\n\nBig Eyes Coin, or BIG, is a cryptocurrency that is growing in popularity due to its innovative features, secure system, and potential in the DeFi ecosystem. It has also gained attention for its meme-inspired platform. Audits by Solidity Finance and verification by CoinSniper have ensured that the platform is secure for investors.\n\nBIG is not just a meme token, but a community-based token that enables investors to participate in decision-making processes. It also has a profitable NFT trading collection available on OpenSea. The presale raised $33.5 million and the ICO period ended on June 3rd, with the promo code END300 offering a 300% reward on all BIG purchases.\n\nA Thorough Comparison Of ADA, ETH, And BIG In The Cryptocurrency Scene\n\nIt's important to note the distinct differences between Cardano, Ethereum, and Big Eyes Coin. While Cardano and Ethereum utilize Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms, Big Eyes Coin uses the innovative Proof-of-Attention (PoA) mechanism, which can make their architecture faster and more efficient. However, Big Eyes Coin's PoA consensus mechanism is unique in that it incentivizes user engagement on the network, promoting security.\n\nETH has a more extensive developer community than ADA or BIG, leading to more projects and applications being developed on the platform. ETH's smart contract functionality is also more advanced, and it has a higher market capitalization.\n\nInvestors are also interested in Cardano's price prediction. ADA has seen significant price growth recently, although it experienced a slight 2.6% dip on Wednesday, trading at $0.39. Meanwhile, ETH dropped 2.53% with a trading price of $1,873.46, after surpassing the barrier at $1,919.27 on Tuesday. The USDT to BIG price is currently at 1891.89, but it is predicted to fall to $BIG 1772.15 by the last day of BIG presale on June 3rd.\n\nA Peak In The Future\n\nAlthough ADA and ETH have been around in the crypto industry for a while, the BIG team and its growing community remain optimistic about their platform's prospects. They recognize the strength of these established players, but they firmly believe that BIG will eventually surpass its competitors and become a dominant force in the market. Their unshakable confidence in the platform's potential reflects their trust in its innovative features and the bright future that awaits it.\n\nAll Things Big Eyes Coin\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL"

The member of Congress reiterated calls for U.S. lawmakers to provide \u201cclear rules of the road\u201d for crypto through legislation. In addition, he pressed SEC Chair Gary Gensler to give a definitive answer on whether Ether (ETH) qualified as a security under the SEC\u2019s purview or a commodity under the Commodity Future Trading Commission\u2019s.\n\nMcHenry repeatedly talked over Gensler\u2019s responses that did not include specifics, citing the SEC chair\u2019s willingness to label Bitcoin (BTC) as a commodity and hinting at private discussions on ETH prior to the hearing.\n\nGary Gensler and Representative McHenry arguing on whether $ETH is a commodity or a security, with Gensler unable to answer the question pic.twitter.com/DTMtazYmuS \u2014 Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) April 19, 2023\n\n\u201cClearly an asset cannot be both a commodity and a security,\u201d said McHenry. \u201cI\u2019m asking you, sitting in your chair now, to make an assessment under the laws as exist, is Ether a commodity or a security?\u201d\n\nHe added:\n\n\u201cYou have pre-judged on this: You\u2019ve taken 50 enforcement actions.

His agenda runs roughshod over process, precedent, & the #SEC\u2019s statutory authority. I look forward to speaking with him today.\n\n\n\nTune in at 10:00am https://t.co/qNdJ4wDkw5 \u2014 Patrick McHenry (@PatrickMcHenry) April 18, 2023\n\nRepresentative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the House committee, did not press Gensler on ETH but focused her questioning on the SEC\u2019s enforcement capabilities. According to the SEC chair, the commission had the means, the authority and the will to bring crypto firms into regulatory compliance.\n\nMany in and out of the crypto space have criticized the SEC under Gensler for taking enforcement actions against firms involved with digital assets and blockchain technology. On April 17, the SEC charged crypto asset trading platform Bittrex and its co-founder William Shihara for offering unregistered securities, and a Wells notice issued to Coinbase in March suggests the major exchange could be next.\n\nGensler claimed the crypto market was \u201crife with noncompliance\u201d, in many cases firms willfully doing so. His written testimony said compliance with the SEC extended to decentralized finance platforms \u2014 an indication of the commission proposing changing its rules to include DeFi in exchanges under its purview.\n\nRelated: Video of SEC chair praising Algorand resurfaces after recently deeming it a security\n\nThe April 18 hearing was the first time Gensler had directly addressed the House committee since October 2021 \u2014 prior to the collapse of FTX, Celsius, BlockFi and crypto-friendly banks including Signature, Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate. The Financial Services Committee will also meet to discuss stablecoin regulation in an April 19 hearing.\n\nMagazine: Crypto regulation: Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?"

        "content": "Single MEV Bot Accounts For 7% Of Daily Ethereum Gas Usage\n\nBy: Owen Fernau \u2022 Loading...\n\nCrypto News\n\nMemecoins are pumping like it\u2019s 2021.\n\nPEPE, a new Ethereum-based token named after the cartoon character turned memetic icon Pepe the Frog, has ascended to a market capitalization of $86M in less than five days, making it the sixth-most valuable memecoin, going by a list from CoinGecko.\n\nPepe the Frog\n\nThe PEPE rally has spurred enterprising developers to spin up tangential projects \u2014 WOJAK, named after another popular memetic character, launched on April 17 and has already jumped to a $10M market capitalization in just over a day.\n\nWojak, also known as Feels Guy\n\nSpeculators who caught these tokens early are sitting on astronomical profits reminiscent of 2021\u2019s dog coin mania, when DOGE and SHIB rallied to their all-time highs.\n\n\u2018Double-edged Sword\u2019\n\nRyan Watkins, the co-founder at Syncracy Capital, a crypto-focused hedge fund, thinks memecoins\u2019 success has a mixed effect on the digital asset space. \u201cIt\u2019s a double-edged sword,\u201d he told The Defiant over Telegram. \u201cOn one hand, memecoins make crypto more fun and accessible. On the other, they reaffirm many skeptics\u2019 criticisms that the industry\u2019s only use case is gambling.\u201d\n\nIndeed, many in the crypto community find memecoins fun, all the more so when they are making money. The Pepe and Wojak characters pop up daily in crypto Discord and Telegram channels, imbuing tokens associated with them with added allure to the blockchain-savvy.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha? Become a premium member of The Defiant and join our DeFi Alpha community. Start for free\n\nConversely, to crypto-outsiders, it\u2019s difficult to discern any real difference between DOGE and PEPE. They\u2019re both tokens with questionable utility \u2014 it\u2019s easy to write off investing time and effort into hot potato games as the most wasteful aspects of the crypto industry.\n\nRegardless of whether the new memecoins\u2019 success is good for crypto as a whole, they\u2019ve certainly caught investors\u2019 attention, with a new token dropping seemingly every few hours.\n\nZ, a well-known pseudonymous trader who has been posting seemingly non-stop about PEPE over the past three days, told The Defiant they first bought the token when it had a $30,000 market capitalization. At the token\u2019s current market capitalization of over $80M \u2014 the trader\u2019s PEPE is worth over 2000 times what they paid for it.\n\n\u201cThe PEPE pump is ringing the bell and waking everyone up to speculate,\u201d Z said. \u201cSeeing the memes that have always been around us and that we see daily become the top memecoins feels healing, cleansing.\u201d The trader said they first heard about PEPE through a private Twitter group.\n\n\u2018Dogs Have Had Their Day\u2019\n\nThe creators of the website for PEPE, who didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment from The Defiant, are looking to take on canine-themed tokens like DOGE and SHIB, which have dominated the memecoin space. \u201cThe dogs have had their day,\u201d the PEPE site reads. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Pepe to take reign.\u201d\n\nSome entrepreneurs haven\u2019t gotten the notice that dog coins are done for \u2014 AIDOGE, which launched on April 10 on Layer 2 network Arbitrum as a free claim for ARB airdrop recipients, has already hit a $35M market capitalization as of April 18.\n\nEthereum Gas Spikes\n\nThe action around memecoins is starting to affect other users of the Ethereum blockchain. Gas fees, the amount of ETH it costs to make a transaction, spiked to their second-highest level in the last six months, according to a dashboard by pseudonymous analyst Hildobby.\n\nEthereum Median Gas Price\n\nThis means Ethereum users are paying over $30 to trade a token on a decentralized exchange like Uniswap or Balancer.\n\nMEV Bot Dominates Ethereum Gas Usage\n\nAccording to information provider SeaLaunch, one entity using the Ethereum domain jaredfromsubway.eth, is running an MEV bot responsible for using 7% of the gas on Ethereum at one point. MEV bots profit by inserting orders ahead and behind unsuspecting traders, resulting in worse execution prices for users\n\nJaredfromsubway.eth was still the top gas consumer as of 10pm ET on April 18.\n\nTop Gas Consumers. Source: Etherscan\n\nTo be sure, it\u2019s not only general Ethereum users who bear the cost of memecoin season. The hype-laden world of memecoins comes with its ups and downs. BONK, a token on the Solana blockchain, was red hot in January but is now down nearly 80% from its peak.\n\nUnproven Meme Value\n\nAnd the idea of a token\u2019s value actually being tied to a meme\u2019s usage is unproven.\n\nPunk6529, a pseudonymous influencer, developed an NFT project geared around owning memes. After peaking in mid-January with a 59,000 ETH market capitalization, The Memes, as the project is called, have dropped nearly 75% to roughly 15,000 ETH, according to data provider NFTGo.\n\nStill, for some avid traders, memecoins provide the spark to get them through the bear market. Or maybe it provides some hope that the bear market may truly be ending.\n\nIn the long run, Syncracy\u2019s Watkins doesn\u2019t think the memecoin phenomenon does too much harm. \u201cIt does get tiring after a while, but speculation attracts capital to the industry necessary to fund new and interesting projects,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think memecoins are meaningfully stealing energy from \u2018real\u2019 projects.\u201d"

        "title": "Explained: All you need to know about Ethereum's latest Shapella upgrade - Business Standard",
        "content": "Last week, the developers of Ethereum announced that they have completed an upgrade called \"Shapella\". Called the final milestone in Ethereum's multi-year transition from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus, it will make earlier staked Ethereum more liquid.\n\nWhat is \"Shapella\"?\n\nThe term \"Shapella\" is derived from the words \"Shanghai\" and \"Capella\". These are two of five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that will be upgraded in the process. The upgrade will change the way Ethereum works. EIP-2565, EIP-2929, and EIP-2718 are the other protocols which will be upgraded.\n\nThe upgrade was completed on April 12.\n\nWhat changed after Shapella?\n\nIn September last year, Ethereum underwent a major upgrade called \"The Merge\", in which the network transitioned from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus. Users were rewarded for \"staking\", and not selling, their Ether and participation in the validation of the network.\n\nIn staking, the investors can freeze their tokens on the cryptocurrency's network. In return, they can earn rewards. The staked tokens are used to develop a system to validate the transactions on the database, unlike PoW, where data has to be entered by miners.\n\nHowever, it was a one-way street. To date, 18 million Ethereum tokens have been staked on the network, valued at $33 billion. The users were not able to withdraw their holdings.\n\nShapella has enabled \"unstacking\" Ether. Shanghai will create a new transaction type that will allow stakers to withdraw their balances, while Capella will enable the network to accept a withdrawal request.\n\nUsers were immediately allowed to withdraw their Ether token. Some 57,600 Ether tokens per day can be withdrawn through full withdrawals and partial withdrawals.\n\nMoreover, as it reduces the need to enter data by miners, staking brings down energy consumption. Now with Shapella, more investors will be encouraged to stake their holdings as it will be easier to withdraw.\n\nWhat happened after the Shapella upgrade?\n\nAfter the upgrade, Indian crypto investors flocked to invest as well as withdraw Ethereum. Major Indian crypto exchanges like WazirX and CoinDCX saw significant spikes in Ethereum trading.\n\nIn the past seven days, Ethereum has jumped 9.28 per cent and was trading at $2,097 on Tuesday, according to coinmarketcap."

        "title": "What is proto-danksharding? - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Proto-danksharding is the first in a series of proposed Ethereum upgrades that aim to split up the network into lots of little chains, known as shards. The hope is that running lots of shards in parallel will allow the entire Ethereum network to grow without slowing down, even if many more individuals start to use the network.\n\nIt will take several years for danksharding to be fully realized on Ethereum. Yet, once implemented, sharding could increase the throughput of the blockchain, make transactions far cheaper, and prevent bottlenecks.\n\nAccomplishing all this would solve several of the major pain points of Ethereum, namely slow and expensive transactions that can cause congestion in times of network stress. Sharding will also reduce the cost of running a validator over time, thereby decentralizing the network.\n\nProto-Danksharding\n\nThe flowery name for the upgrade, which also goes by \u201cShard Blob Transactions,\u201d conceals a more prosaic technical name: EIP-4844. EIP stands for Ethereum Improvement Proposal, the title given to any recommendation to upgrade the blockchain.\n\nDanksharding is the name of the sharding design that Ethereum\u2019s developers propose to use on the network. \u201cDank,\u201d in addition to referencing slang that means something like \u201ccool\u201d or \u201cgood,\u201d is a hat tip to Ethereum Foundation researcher Dankrad Feist.\n\nProto-danksharding, i.e., EIP-4844, is the first step toward implementing full danksharding. It would implement most of the logic and craft the rules that would be required for danksharding to go ahead. Consider it \u201cdanksharding-lite.\u201d\n\nThe upgrade would also introduce a new type of transaction called a \u201cblob-carrying transaction.\u201d These look just like regular transactions but hold a relatively large and inexpensive piece of data known as a blob. The benefit of these blob-carrying transactions, explained in greater detail below, is greater efficiency, particularly for existing scaling solutions like rollups. That will cut costs and improve speeds.\n\nHow Danksharding Works\n\nSo how does danksharding propose to scale Ethereum? Put simply, instead of verifying everything in a block, danksharding aims to have the Ethereum blockchain merely verify that these data-efficient \u201cblobs\u201d contain the right kind of information and carry out any orders contained therein.\n\nThis cuts down the amount of work required by the execution layer of Ethereum, the part of the network that is responsible for carrying out the instructions set by the other side of Ethereum, known as the consensus layer.\n\nThe execution layer of Ethereum is busy enough as it is, and making things more efficient speeds up the blockchain. Blob transactions are supposedly cheaper to execute, too, ultimately reducing transaction costs for users.\n\nThese blobs of data are likely to contain information relevant to layer-2 protocols, like Arbitrum or Optimism. Layer-2 protocols, which wrap up bundles of Ethereum transactions and process them elsewhere, are also important for scaling Ethereum. It is expected that danksharding and layer-2 protocols will work hand in hand.\n\nIn addition to the above, danksharding also reimagines how transaction fees are paid on Ethereum. One class of actor, known as the proposer, determines which transactions should fit into a block. A second class\u2014so-called block builders\u2014bids on the right to determine the transactions that are contained within a block.\n\nHow Will Proto-Danksharding Affect You?\n\nProto-danksharding only introduces a very limited version of danksharding; it\u2019s mostly throat-clearing for the real thing. However, it should make transacting on some layer-2 protocols, which will be able to access these new blob transactions, a lot cheaper.\n\nBut even these layer-2 transactions will pale in comparison to the genuine article: proto-danksharding will provide a single megabyte of data availability for each transaction, while actual danksharding will hit 16 megabytes.\n\nDanksharding doesn\u2019t have a release date, and the peanut gallery of Twitter pundits expects that even proto-danksharding could take years.\n\nIn late 2022, Ethereum officially switched from proof of work to proof of stake (known as the Merge), reducing its environmental impact by a factor of 99%. The Merge was Ethereum\u2019s biggest upgrade to date. It took about six years to implement, and came following innumerable delays.\n\nWhile you wait, note that upgrades to the Ethereum blockchain itself will be complemented by advances to layer-2 technologies, such as zk-SNARKs and rollups."

        "content": "Over $41 million of ETH long positions have been liquidated as Ethereum prices flash crash from their April peaks, Coinglass data on April 19 reveals.\n\nEthereum Remains Volatile\n\nETH, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, is under immense pressure when writing. Although the uptrend remains, and the coin has generally posted impressive results over the last four months, the price drop today has led to the biggest liquidation of ETH long positions in over one month.\n\nAccording to Coinglass data, ETH long positions were also wrecked on March 22 when over $31 million were forcefully closed. On average, less than $10 million of ETH longs have been closed on other trading days in the last month.\n\nNewsBTC\n\nThe magnitude of long or short liquidation can be used to measure general volatility in the market. Volatility indicates how fast or slow an asset price moves within a given period.\n\nDepending on the general liquidity, asset prices can move at different paces. In crypto, the most liquid assets, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, are usually less volatile than altcoins, for example, those outside the top 50.\n\n$41 Million Of ETH Longs Liquidated\n\nFrom the $41 million ETH longs liquidated, a big chunk is in OKX and Binance. These are some of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges that support the derivatives trading of crypto assets.\n\nBy supporting margin, perpetual futures, and other derivatives, OKX and Binance traders can use leverage to trade bigger positions than they would ordinarily be able to. Although leverage can amplify gains, it risks the trader\u2019s account when prices move against their prediction.\n\nThe drop of ETH prices from $2,100 moved against leverage traders in, among other platforms, Binance and OKX, leading to tens of millions of dollars being liquidated. www.tradingview.com/x/gbQIKdue\n\nBy liquidating a position, the exchange forcefully closed the long position and secured the margin since it couldn\u2019t cover the ongoing loss. How quickly a position can be liquidated also depends on the leverage level. Traders with high leverage and trading bigger positions in a volatile market stand a higher risk of having their positions liquidated.\n\nThe sharp spike in ETH long liquidations is less than a week after $54 million of short positions were liquidated on April 14. The number of ETH shorts closed by the exchange was also the largest in over a month. As the trend observed, most of those short positions were from Binance and OKX. There were also more short positions closed on Bybit and Deribit."

Moreover, the victims are all \u201cOGs who are reasonably secure.\u201d\n\nOGs targeted in sophisticated wallet heist\n\n@tayvano_ pointed out that this is a sophisticated attack deliberately targeting OGs, reiterating that no one can work out where the exploit lies.\n\n\u201cThis is NOT a low-brow phishing site or a random scammer. It has NOT rekt a single noob. It ONLY rekts OGs.\u201d\n\nForensic device examination has led nowhere \u2014 further stumping investigations into the method used to access the victims\u2019 wallet.\n\nThe commonalities between cases were the keys were created between 2014 and 2022, and victims are \u201ccrypto native,\u201d such as possessing multiple addresses and working within the crypto industry.\n\nThe hacker will commit \u201cprimary\u201d thefts, with \u201csecondary\u201d thefts following hours later to collect assets and dust missed during the initial heist \u2014 sometimes weeks or months later.\n\nIn the case of large thefts, the attacker will swap assets into ETH inside the wallet, then send the tokens to a centralized swapper, including SimpleSwap and ChangeNOW \u2014 always swapping into Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nSitting on the swapped BTC for a week, the funds are sent to a mixer for address obfuscation.\n\nTips on staying safe\n\n@tayvano_ speculates that the attacker has acquired a data cache from the victims\u2019 device.

        "content": "Elevate Your Tech Prowess with High-Value Skill Courses Offering College Course Website IIM Kozhikode IIMK Advanced Data Science For Managers Visit MIT MIT Technology Leadership and Innovation Visit Indian School of Business ISB Professional Certificate in Product Management Visit\n\nIndian crypto investors have started showing interest in Ethereum (ETH) following the highly anticipated Shapella upgrade, which resulted in a surge in transaction volumes in the digital asset last week across major local cryptocurrency exchanges.At Wazir X , the transaction volume for ETH grew from $52,000 on April 9 to $3,75000 on April 14, recording a near-eight-fold increase.Another top exchange, CoinDCX, said that its ETH volumes had spiked significantly - by 55% - on the INR trading pair over the last few weeks.According to the exchanges, the transaction volumes of ETH decreased over the weekend, but this is a common trend in the crypto markets, which usually experience lower volumes during weekends.\u201cWe anticipate an increase in momentum starting from this week,\u201d said Minal Thukral, EVP-Growth, CoinDCX.Ethereum has been up 11.73 % in the last 7 days, touching $2,076 on Coinmarketcap at 5 PM Mumbai time on Monday.On April 12, the Ethereum blockchain underwent simultaneous \"Shanghai\" and \"Capella\" upgrades while operational. The Shanghai upgrade primarily impacted Ethereum's (ETH) Execution Layer, while Capella targeted the Consensus Layer. The implementation dubbed \"Shapella,\" is expected to enhance the network's performance, security, and efficiency.The upgrade allowed users to withdraw billions of dollars in Ether, the native token of the Ethereum network, and the network recorded a hefty inflow of deposits, touching a yearly high of $2,129.Staking in crypto involves holding and locking up a certain amount of cryptocurrency to participate in the network and earn returns akin to a traditional bank FD.Investors were fearing that Ether holders would quickly withdraw their staked tokens, but fresh deposits helped sustain the staking balance for a couple of days. But lately, withdrawals from Ethereum staking contracts have exceeded deposits.Indian investors said that Ethereum holders now have more confidence to stake their tokens after the Shanghai upgrade as it will allow them to unstake their ETH after a 14-day lock-in period from that day.\"Unlike other Smart Contract Blockchains, the percentage of staked tokens is only 15% in Ethereum, which is expected to rise from here on. Cardano has 69% of ADA tokens staked, Avalanche has 54% AVAX staked, Solana has 71% of SOL staked,\" said Ashwini Nadar, a Mumbai-based software professional and avid crypto enthusiast.Ethereum, a decentralized blockchain platform founded by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, allows developers to create decentralised applications (dApps) and smart contracts. It ranks as the second-largest cryptocurrency platform by market capitalisation, following Bitcoin.Ethereum upgrades, often called \"hard forks\" or \"network upgrades,\" entail modifications to the Ethereum protocol or the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which operates smart contracts.At CoinDCX, Ethereum gained more than 6% a day after the upgrade.The exchange said that its on-chain data showed that there was a significant increase of nearly 100,000 ETH tokens staked on the Ethereum blockchain on April 14, marking the largest one-day increase in almost two months.\"This suggests that rather than withdrawing staked ETH to cash out, a significant portion of investors view the successful Shapella upgrade as an indication to stake their Ether tokens,\" said Thukral of CoinDCX.The upgrade sets the stage for a transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, replacing the existing proof-of-work (PoW) system."

        "title": "Ethereum Merge \u2013 Top 10 Things to Know - Bitbuy",
        "content": "Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market value has conducted its final test run for the long-awaited upgrade that will be a pivotal moment in the history of crypto. This upgrade is being called the \u2018Merge\u2019 and is said to be happening in mid-September. Before we go deeper into the details of this merge, we need to understand what exactly it is. Here are the top 10 things you need to know about the Ethereum \u2018Merge\u2019:\n\n1. What is the Merge?\n\nThe \u2018Merge\u2019 refers to the event when the Ethereum blockchain changes from using Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Because two independent blockchains that are now operating in parallel will be merged, it is known as \"the Merge\u2019 due to the \"Beacon Chain,\" a specialized blockchain, and the main Ethereum blockchain being combined, or \"merged.\"\n\nThe beacon chain is empty of transactions. There are no DeFi applications or tokens. It is an empty blockchain that exists just to support the Proof of Stake consensus algorithm. Since the Beacon Chain is a \"empty chain,\" it may join the Ethereum blockchain and replace the role of Ethereum's PoW system without having to worry about any other factors. A brand-new PoS consensus method will take the place of Ethereum's PoW validation once these two chains are combined.\n\n\u200d\n\n2. Why is this so Important?\n\nIn the history of cryptocurrency, no blockchain has seen such a profound transformation. A crucial aspect of a blockchain's operation is not changed very frequently, and none have undergone modifications with an economy as significant and well-developed as Ethereum's. TheMerge is a long-awaited moment in the crypto world, and it will likely change the industry tremendously, paving the way for future Ethereum upgrades and setting a precedent for other blockchain and DeFi upgrades in the future.\n\n\u200d\n\n3. What are the benefits?\n\nEthereum's transition to a PoS consensus will bring numerous benefits, including improved efficiency, scalability, and security, as well as reduced centralization. One of the main outcomes of the Merge and transition to PoS is that it will reduce Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption drastically. Ethereum, will consume about 99.5%less energy post-merge. Investors and authorities who care about the environment are concerned about the energy use associated with crypto currency mining. For instance, US legislators frequently criticize Bitcoin mining because of the network's significant carbon impact.\n\n\u200d\n\n4. Will The Merge reduce gas fees?\n\nA common misconception is that the Merge will materially lower Ethereum\u2019s transaction fees (gas fees).It was highlighted that the Merge does not increase network capacity but rather alters the consensus procedure. The relationship between network capacity and demand determines gas pricing. While switching from a PoW to a PoS consensus, the Merge does not significantly impact any aspects that directly affect network throughput or capacity. In future upgrades, Ethereum\u2019s gas price may decrease but for now, it will remain unchanged following theMerge.\n\n\u200d\n\n5. What does this mean for Eth?\n\nThe economics of ETH have been significantly impacted by TheMerge. This element of the Merge is the most important to investors. Because of the Merge's reduced ETH supply and transformation into a native yield-bearing asset, ETH's economics are fundamentally altered.Because there is less of a need to compensate PoW miners, Ethereum may lower its annual ETH issuance from 4.3% to 0.43%, making Ethereum a deflationary asset. Most people view the decrease in additional ETH issuance as exceedingly positive.\n\n\u200d\n\n6. How will this affect the price of ETH?\n\nEthereum recently traded in the mid-$1,800 range, up more than 80% from its mid-July lows of under $1,000. While most of this has coincided with a general uptick in the cryptocurrency market with improved macro mood (Bitcoin is up over 25% from its mid-July lows), experts have noted that anticipation for the merger has been a key factor pushing ETH\u2019s price higher.\n\nETH really seemed to take notice of the upcoming Merge when senior developer Tim Beiko tentatively put forth an official date for the Mainnet merge to take place this September. Anything that pushes that date back may weigh on ETH in the short-term. After the recent successful Goerli merge, combined with softer than expected US inflation figures for July that were just released, ETH prices could be in within a shot of hitting $2,000 in the very near future.\n\n\u200d\n\n\u200d7. How do I prepare for the Merge?\n\nGiven that this is one of the largest occasions in the whole history of the cryptocurrency sector, it is expected that many dishonest persons would try to take advantage of it in hopes of defrauding trusting individuals of their money. It is crucial to understand that prior to theMerge, users and holders of ETH do not need to make any changes to their accounts or wallets.\n\nAfter the switch to PoS, Ethereum's complete history, going all the way back to its creation, will be preserved. After the Merge, all balances in wallets will remain accessible, and users and holders are not forced to update.\n\n\u200d\n\n8. Are there risks involved?\n\nEthereum critics, who are usually bitcoin maximalists relate the merge to replacing an airplane's engine in the middle of a passenger flight. Not just the aircraft but also the $183 billion worth of ether in circulation are under jeopardy. Undoubtedly, there are many risks involved in making a mistake, which is one of the primary reasons why theMerge has taken so long. As a result, there is plenty of testing and polishing going on behind the scenes.\n\n\u200d\n\n9. Will this be it for Ethereum Upgrades?\n\nNo! A successful \"Merge\" also prepares the ground for the rest of the Ethereum roadmap which includes upgrades, known as\"Surge,\" \"Verge,\" \"Purge,\" and\"Splurge.\" Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin discussed the upgrade path, which would make Ethereum \"a far more scalable system,\" at the recent Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Paris.\n\nFuture upgrades include supporting thousands of transactions per second to make applications faster and more affordable to use, improving its protocol's security against all types of attack as use of it rises, and being more environmentally friendly.\n\n\u200d\n\n10. Wen Merge\n\nThe merge is currently set to occur on September 15. Exciting potential and innovations are presented by the Merge and the rest of Ethereum's roadmap. Many followers of Ethereum anticipate positive outcomes, but it's yet unclear how these changes will affect the ecosystem.\n\nSince cryptocurrency is still in its infancy, there is extreme potential for it to develop. There will be advancements in the future that no one can currently conceive but which will unquestionably be very important in this booming business.\n\n\u200d\n\n\u200d\n\nBitbuy now offers Ethereum staking for Canadians in a safe and regulated environment.

        "content": "Following the Merge, Ethereum now uses proof of stake (POS), which allows you to stake your Ether coins (ETH) in return for more ETH.\n\nStaking is designed to make the Ethereum network faster, more scalable and more sustainable. Mining on Ethereum has stopped, leaving staking the only way to earn new ETH. There are both simple and complex ways to participate in staking, each with its own benefits and risks that you need to weigh up.\n\nThis is not an endorsement of cryptocurrency or any specific provider, service or offering. It is not a recommendation to trade or use any services.\n\nWhat is Ethereum staking?\n\nEthereum staking involves validating transactions on the Ethereum network to earn new ETH coins. By locking up a minimum of ETH in a wallet, you gain the ability to confirm whether a transaction conforms to signature requirements and other rules. In return for your work, you get additional ETH coins \u2013 these are called staking rewards.\n\nAnyone can become a validator by staking through dedicated software, through your Ethereum wallet or by joining a staking pool.\n\nThe minimum amount of ETH required to run a validator node alone is 32. Anyone with less than that will want to join a pool or another service that lets you stake small amounts of ETH for rewards. You can find these pools on trading platforms such as Kraken and Binance, or DeFi services like Lido and Rocket Pool. These services usually let you start with 1 ETH or even less.\n\nStaking's goal is to make the network more secure from attacks and more decentralised. Ethereum staking is the only way to create new ETH coins following the Merge, which made energy-intensive mining obsolete.\n\nWhat is the Merge? The Merge refers to the Ethereum network upgrade that went live in September 2022. It implemented the following: The final transition to PoS and elimination of proof-of-work (PoW) mining.\n\nEnabled future scaling upgrades that will increase transaction speed and throughput.\n\nReduced energy consumption by 99.95%.\n\nHow to stake Ethereum\n\nThere are various ways of staking Ethereum. This depends on how much Ether you're willing to deposit and how comfortable you are using the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nYou must stake 32 ETH to become a validator on your own. This means you get to keep the full staking rewards. With anything less than that, you can join a pool like the DeFi protocol Lido or use an exchange like Kraken. This makes staking a lot easier for most people, although the pool will take a cut of your rewards.\n\nEthereum staking through an exchange pool\n\nIf you don't have 32 ETH or want to deposit that much, consider joining a staking pool.\n\nThis is a simpler process than staking alone as the pool and services staking for you typically do the technical work on your behalf. Because these pools provide a service for you, most pools charge either a flat fee or a percentage of your rewards for doing so.\n\nExchange pools operate on exchanges like Binance, Coinbase and Kraken, but some of these may not be available to users in Australia. Joining is a matter of creating an account with an eligible exchange and following the instructions for staking your ETH.\n\nAmount to earn on 1 ETH = $6,173.93450 Choose a rate 7% - Kraken Cryptocurrency Exchange 4.5% - Bitstamp Cryptocurrency Exchange Show all table options Daily earnings $0.00 0 ETH Weekly earnings $0.00 0 ETH Monthly earnings $0.00 0 ETH Yearly earnings $0.00 0 ETH Cryptocurrency prices provided by CoinGecko.

Use the calculator to project how much you could earn with each provider. Start earning. Once you've made your choice, click on the green \"Earn now\" button to go to the provider's website and create an account or log in.\n\nEthereum staking with a wallet\n\nYou can use any compatible Web3 wallet like MetaMask to stake through a pool like Lido or Rocket Pool. The process only takes a few minutes and has the added benefit of providing you with a Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD).\n\nLSD's are tokens that represent your staked share of ETH and increase in value over time, which reflects your accrued staking rewards. LSDs like stETH (Lido) and rETH (Rocket Pool) can are popular and can be easily sold or used with DeFi apps.\n\nAnother way of staking through a wallet is by using a Ledger hardware wallet. Ledger allows you to stake directly through the Ledger Live software or in conjunction with a Web3 wallet. Using a hardware wallet to stake adds an additional layer of security, and is considered the safest way to store cryptocurrency. Ledger partners with either Lido or Kiln to provide staking services through Ledger Live.\n\nIf you have the full 32 ETH required you can use MyEtherWallet which has partnered with a node-hosting service called Staked. It allows browser and mobile wallet users to stake ETH directly through their wallet as a validator.\n\nLedger Nano X Wallet Trezor Model T Wallet Ledger Nano S Plus Wallet Go to site Go to site Go to site Supported assets 5,500+ Supported assets 9,000+ Supported assets 5,500+ Price (USD) $149 Price (USD) $179 Price (USD) $79 See more of the best crypto wallets Compare wallets\n\nEthereum staking with a validator node\n\nStaking as a validator is complex, but here's a brief overview of a method to help you decide if it's right for you.\n\nEither install staking software on your computer or buy specialised staking hardware. Connect your hardware to the internet. Download and validate Ethereum's blockchain data. Run the execution and consensus client software. Deposit your ETH to the official ETH staking address after verifying it at ethereum.org.\n\nHardware requirements to stake alone\n\nYou need storage space and a stable connection to run the validator software:\n\nStaking requires around 2TB SSD storage drive.\n\nYou need a 24/7 uptime without bandwidth caps to sync and validate without interruptions.\n\n8GB RAM if using Raspberry Pi or 16\u201332GB RAM on a regular computer.\n\nIntel NUC, 7th-gen processor or higher.\n\nHow does Ethereum staking work?\n\nWith Ethereum staking, you secure and add new blocks to the Beacon Chain. You must deposit either 32 ETH to become a full validator or join a staking pool with a lower amount.\n\nYou earn rewards for correctly validating transactions. If you make too many mistakes \u2013 for example, validating conflicting blocks \u2013 you can lose a part of your staked coins through slashing, a process designed to punish poor validators. You might also be booted from the network.\n\nSlashing\n\nSlashing is a penalty designed to punish validators who submit fraudulent transactions to the Ethereum blockchain. If a validator breaks the rules, they will have a portion of their staked 32 ETH removed from their ownership and be booted from the network.\n\nHow much can I earn with Ethereum staking?\n\nAs of September 2022 you can earn around 4% of your invested ETH, paid annually in ETH coins. This rate is dynamic though and will change over time.\n\nYour rate of return depends on the number of ETH staked at any given time across the network. When fewer ETH are validating the network, the reward is higher to provide an incentive for more users to stake their ETH. The more ETH staked at the same time, the lower the reward.\n\nThe dollar value of your return depends on the current price of ETH. If the price of ETH rises, your reward increases even more. But if the price of ETH drops, your reward value drops as well.\n\nWhen do I get my staking rewards?\n\nThe network transfers ETH staking rewards to validators every epoch \u2013 every 384 seconds or roughly 6.5 minutes. The number of coins each validator receives is calculated based on the state of the Ethereum network after an epoch is complete.\n\nYou must be an active validator during the previous epoch to receive a reward, meaning you need to be online and validating the network. You will only be rewarded for the epochs you participate in. Calculations of potential rewards provide only an estimate and you won't know your exact reward amount until you receive it.\n\nBenefits of staking Ethereum\n\nAside from earning ETH rewards, staking is designed for those who want to be part of the community actively building the foundation of the new Ethereum.\n\nYou help the network grow and contribute toward a decentralised world. If this kind of work aligns with your ideology, it might be your main reason to stake.\n\nDrawbacks of staking Ethereum\n\nBefore getting started, weigh potential drawbacks that include the following:\n\nYou must lock up your ETH. You can't access your ETH until the developers make another upgrade after the Merge.\n\nYou can't access your ETH until the developers make another upgrade after the Merge. You can lose ETH. If you're offline for more than 50% of the epoch time or make mistakes, it can cost you. How much you lose depends on your impact on the network. Let's say you and more than two-thirds of validators are offline. You could progressively lose up to 50% of your stake over 21 days. After 21 days, you might be kicked out of the validator pool.\n\nIf you're offline for more than 50% of the epoch time or make mistakes, it can cost you. How much you lose depends on your impact on the network. Let's say you and more than two-thirds of validators are offline. You could progressively lose up to 50% of your stake over 21 days. After 21 days, you might be kicked out of the validator pool. You must keep your address safe. Without your withdrawal address and recovery phrase, you can lose all of your ETH.\n\nWithout your withdrawal address and recovery phrase, you can lose all of your ETH. Value is affected by the market. Because your ETH is locked, if the price of Ether drops, you could lose the value of your cryptocurrency without the ability to sell them off.\n\nBottom line\n\nEthereum staking is the process of locking up a portion of Ether to validate the Ethereum network and earn rewards. You can stake solo with 32 ETH or join a staking pool with a lower amount.\n\nUsing a pool like Lido or Rocket Pool will also provide you with a token which represents your share of staked ETH and rewards. These can be easily sold or used in DeFi applications.\n\nFor added security, consider using a hardware wallet to protect your private keys if you decide to stake through a wallet.\n\nKeep in mind there are various risks involved with staking, such as slashing or smart contract vulnerabilities.\n\nIf the risks feel worth the reward, you'll need to buy some ETH to get started on your staking journey."

        "content": "EOS has claimed that its EVM is considerably faster than Polygon and Solana.\n\nThe token\u2019s price increased after the launch, but later registered a decline.\n\nEOS Network Foundation [EOS] recently launched its EOS EVM, an emulation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine, deployed as a smart contract on the blockchain. Ignas, a popular Twitter account that posts insights about DeFi and other crypto spaces, highlighted EOS EVM\u2019s features and capabilities in a 17 April tweet.\n\n1/6 EOS launched the EOS EVM chain. It offers $EOS performance with the resources of the Ethereum community. EOS EVM claims to be 25x faster than AVAX and 3x faster than Solana or Polygon. \u2014 Ignas | DeFi Research (@DefiIgnas) April 17, 2023\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 EOSs worth today?\n\nA-Z about EOS EVM\n\nThe EOS EVM runs decentralized applications written in Solidity, the native programming language of Ethereum [ETH]. The solution was developed to tackle the challenges faced by Ethereum developers, such as scalability.\n\nThe blockchain\u2019s new EVM aims to solve this problem by successfully combining the strong performance of the EOS Network with the easily accessible resources of the Ethereum community. The newly launched EVM is designed to complement Ethereum and accelerate the network\u2019s mass adoption.\n\nEOS EVM vs. competitors\n\nIgnas\u2019 tweet mentioned that EOS EVM claims to be 25 times faster than Avalanche [AVAX] and three times faster than Solana [SOL] or Polygon [MATIC]. Better speed can be a key factor in attracting new users. Apart from the speed, ENV committed to investing $20 million in GameFi and EOS EVM projects to further the growth and adoption of EOS. But will it be enough to entice the community?\n\nThe question can be better answered after checking the performance of its competitors, such as Polygon\u2019s zkEVM. As per Dune\u2019s data, zkEVM\u2019s unique depositors have declined sharply, which can be good news for EOS EVM. A similar decline was also noted on zkSync Era\u2019s unique wallet counts, giving EOS EVM an opportunity to grow.\n\nEOS network since EVM launch\n\nIt was interesting to see that on the day of the EVM launch, the blockchain\u2019s network value spiked as its TVL increased. However, the uptrend was short-lived, as it declined over the following days.\n\nDespite the EVM launch, the network\u2019s development activity remained low in April 2023. Nonetheless, EOS remained a topic of discussion in the crypto community as its social volume remained relatively high throughout the last 30 days.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s EOS market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nThe network\u2019s token reaction was positive\n\nSoon after the EVM was released on 13 April, the blockchain\u2019s native token\u2019s price action turned bullish. However, the upward momentum halted soon as its price went down over the coming days.\n\nWhile its price increased, positive sentiments around EOS also spiked. Another good news for the token was its green funding rate, reflecting its demand in the futures market. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $1.21, with a market capitalization of more than $1.3 billion."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology have long been evolving with the inclusion of exclusive and groundbreaking innovations. This evolution started right due to the shortcomings and difficulties faced by the crypto users who utilized the primary crypto token . The initial altcoin (the term used for cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) to deal with the issues of the chief crypto was . It was developed and launched by Ethereum a few years after.\n\nEthereum: An Introduction\n\nFundamentally, Ethereum is known as a worldwide decentralized software platform that uses blockchain technology. It is usually famous for its local crypto token Ether (ETH). The platform of Ethereum can be utilized to develop any safe digital technology. Its token is structured for payment dealing with the work carried out to support the blockchain. Nonetheless, the members can additionally utilize it for the payment of tangible services and goods if accepted. Ethereum is developed to be decentralized, secure, programmable, and scalable.\n\nOne important aspect of Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies is the concept of a trading pair. With Ethereum, the most common trading pair is ETH USDT or Ether traded against the Tether stablecoin (pegged to the US dollar).\n\nIt is known as a blockchain platform that is preferred by enterprises and developers who are engaged in developing technology to facilitate the industries as well as serve real-world use cases. Ethereum is locally compatible with smart contracts that are categorized as an essential instrument at the back of the decentralized applications (dApps). Several applications related to decentralized finance (DeFi) utilize smart contracts in addition to blockchain technology.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Statistics\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price: $2,009.15 Ethereum (ETH) Rank: 2 Ethereum (ETH) Market Cap: $242,018,190,647 Ethereum (ETH) Trading Volume: $12,792,581,321 Ethereum (ETH) 24h High: $2,022.15 Ethereum (ETH) 24h Low: $1,901.86\n\nA Brief History\n\nThe idea of developing\n\nis credited to Vitalik Buterin. A white paper was published by him about Ethereum back in the year 2014. The platform of Ethereum was introduced a year later by Joe Lubin (the person who founded the blockchain software firm ConsenSys) and Vitalik Buterin in 2015. The Ethereum founders are considered among the earliest to be in knowledge of blockchain technology\u2019s complete potential beyond just offering a secure method for virtual payments.\n\nSince Ethereum\u2019s launch, a great rise has been witnessed in Ether\u2019s market. As a result of this, the ETH token remained successful in getting the 2nd spot after the top crypto Bitcoin in terms of market value. In this way, it is now the top crypto token among the altcoins. Similar to the rest of the digital assets, Ethereum has blockchain technology underlying it. A blockchain contains blocks in a lengthy chain.\n\nThe information kept in each of the blocks is incorporated into each of the latest-developed blocks with exclusive data. Within the network, the blockchain\u2019s identical copy is distributed. A network containing automated programs is responsible for the validation of this blockchain. The respective programs get to a consensus over the legitimacy of the transfer of information. No modifications can be done to the blockchain if the network does not reach a consensus.\n\nThe respective characteristic makes it considerably shielded. An algorithm, usually known as a consensus mechanism, is utilized to reach a consensus. Ethereum network utilizes the proof-of-stake algorithm that enables a group of members known as validators to develop exclusive blocks as well as operate in mutual harmony. In this way, they validate the information contained by them.\n\nThe blocks keep information dealing with the blockchain\u2019s status, a series of attestations (taking into account a validator\u2019s signature), transfers, and so on. It is noteworthy here that Ethereum formally altered its algorithm from the proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS) back in September last year with its enormous \u201cThe Merge\u201d upgrade. PoW is the power-intensive and expensive consensus mechanism while PoS is the latest, cost-effective, less energy-consuming, and environment-friendly consensus mechanism. The upgraded Ethereum is called Ethereum 2.0.\n\nProof-of-Stake Mechanism\n\nProof-of-stake is different from proof-of-work because it does not need the energy-consuming computing known as mining for the validation of the blocks. On the contrary, it utilizes a finalization protocol named Casper-FFG as well as an algorithm named LMD. These are added into a consensus named Gasper. The respective mechanism is responsible for monitoring the consensus as well as defining how validators are given rewards for their work or get punished for their dishonesty.\n\nSingle validators are required to stake thirty-two ETH tokens to be eligible for validation. People can stake minor\n\namounts, nevertheless, there is a need for them to join a validation pool as well as share the rewards. A validator develops an exclusive block as well as confirms that the information is valid in a procedure known as attestation.\n\nIn this process, the block is broadcasted to the rest of the validators within a committee specified for the verification as well as vote for the validity. On the other hand, the dishonest validators \u2013 who attempt to assault the network \u2013 are penalized as the ETH tokens staked by them are burned. Burning is considered the delivery of crypto assets to a wallet with no keys.\n\nGrand Split in Ethereum\n\nThe split or hard fork of Ethereum is known as a prominent incident in the platform\u2019s history, dividing it into Ethereum Classic and Ethereum. Back in 2016, several network members obtained majority control of the platform\u2019s blockchain. As a consequence of that, they took away ETH assets of above $50M worth. The respective funds were specified for a project named \u201cThe DAO.\u201d Keeping this in view, the majority of the community demanded the return of the stolen assets.\n\nThey wanted this to be done by the invalidation of the present Ethereum blockchain as well as authorizing a blockchain platform with a reviewed history. Nevertheless, a portion of the community intended to keep up with the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s original version. That is how Ethereum\u2019s unmodified version became Ethereum Classic (ETC) following the split. Ethereum Classic\u2019s blockchain still uses the PoW consensus algorithm and several speculations are also being made about the Ethereum mining profitability.\n\nComparison between Ethereum and Bitcoin\n\nA comparison is often drawn between Ethereum and Bitcoin. Though both crypto tokens have several similarities, there are also a few distinctions among them. The developers and founders of Ethereum describe it as the top programmable blockchain of the world as it is an electronic as well as programmable network that supports several applications. On the other hand, the blockchain of Bitcoin has been developed just to support the\n\ntoken.\n\nThe cumulative number of Bitcoin tokens to be entered into circulation is up to 21M. As opposed to this, the number of ETH tokens to be created is unlimited, though the time consumed in processing an ETH block limits the number of tokens to be minted every year. The Ethereum tokens in circulation are above 122M. Another important distinction between them is related to how these networks deal with the transfer processing charges.\n\nThe respective fees are paid on Ethereum by members while carrying out transfers. The charges linked to Bitcoin transfers are engrossed by the wider Bitcoin network. Above all, the consensus mechanisms of both networks are different although formerly both were using the same. Ethereum is now using a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism while\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Prediction: Price History\n\nis still utilizing its original proof-of-work consensus where the miners need to compete with each other for rewards.\n\nWith the past price performance of the crypto assets, the long-term crypto market outlook is clarified. It makes it easy to know more about Bitcoin as well as the altcoin market trends. In the case of Ethereum, the initial transaction on the network was performed back in the year 2015. Since its launch, during the major portion of that year, Ethereum remained under the $1 mark.\n\nNonetheless, in the next year, Ether moved beyond $10 in terms of price when it reached $10.03 for a brief time on the 4th of March in 2016. In the year 2017, Ether gained considerable fame and touched $100 in May. After that, by the year\u2019s end, the crypto token\u2019s value reached $774.69. Then, within 2018\u2019s 1st week, it even reached above the $1000 spot. Following the unprecedented upsurge, the crypto crash (better called the Bitcoin crash) was also experienced by Ether in 2018.\n\nAs a result, a decrease of nearly $100 in price per token was seen by 2018\u2019s end. Following that, between 2019 and 2021, the token again rallied and touched its all-time high price on the 9th of November at approximately $4,815. During 2022\u2019s initial half, the value of the token went through a significant dip. However, several developments have been carried out by the network. The chief characteristics of Ethereum like providing worldwide compatibility for DApps, smart contracts, and other scaling solutions have increased crypto adoption.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Prediction: Price Analysis\n\nAt present, the price of Ethereum is $2,009.15. The fundamental analysis of Ethereum\u2019s price says that it has a 24-hour high of up to $2.022.15 while $1,901.86 is its 24-hour low price level. The current price of the token has increased by 4.94% in the recent 24 hours. The market capitalization of Ethereum stands at $242,018,109,647. The 24-hour trading volume of the crypto token is approximately $12,792,581,321. The circulating supply of Ethereum is almost 120,457,776 ETH tokens while its cumulative supply is nearly 120,457,776.\n\nThe technical analysis of Ether points out that it has an overall bullish sentiment. This has become possible after the Ethereum network\u2019s continuous efforts to exit the bearish momentum that it was experiencing during the previous months. The potential cause behind it was the general crypto downfall and other macroeconomic factors. Since the initial coin offering of Ethereum, the price of ETH has jumped by up to 6,788.06 times in comparison with the US dollar.\n\nOn the other hand, a 105.78 times spike has been seen by the token in comparison with the top crypto Bitcoin. The fear and greed index is placed at 70 showing \u201cGreed.\u201d Apart from that, in the recent thirty days, the token has seen positive price movement in up to 16 days. The token is currently trading at a top point within its trading cycle. Moreover, Ether has a very low inflation rate. The annual inflation rate of Ethereum is almost 0.07% at the moment.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Prediction\n\nThe crypto market trends and the market analysis point out that Ethereum will likely see a great upsurge in its value in the coming time irrespective of the cryptocurrency price volatility. Apart from the retail adoption, the institutional adoption of Ethereum is also expected to have substantial uptake in the future. According to the anticipation, the political factors and the global economic factors will also get gradually favourable for crypto. Furthermore, the regulatory landscape around crypto will also be improved to a great extent.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2023\n\nThe crypto market analysis brings to the front that blockchain technology trends are getting more and more traction around the world. In this respect, Ethereum network scalability will play a significant role in onboarding a lot of exclusive people into the crypto ecosystem. Exclusive innovations like smart contracts in Ethereum are expected to elevate its popularity. Hence, the maximum price of Ether will be up to $2,650 this year. $1,450 will be its minimum price. The crypto token will trade for around $2,050 on average.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025\n\nEthereum price forecast indicates that the political and economic factors affecting crypto prices will expectedly become supportive for crypto. With the dependence of decentralized finance (DeFi) on Ethereum along with the positive crypto market predictions and trends,\n\nEthereum (ETH Price Prediction 2030\n\nis expected to reach the price level of $6,000 at maximum by 2025. The minimum price of the token will be nearly $4,300. On the other hand, ETH is anticipated to trade at around $5,150 by that year.\n\nThe positive long-term crypto market outlook suggests that the crypto regulatory landscape and its impact on prices will become positive by the year 2030. Furthermore, the crypto market sentiment analysis signifies that a huge proportion of the financial community will be pro-crypto by that time. Apart from that, the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies will also have an enormous spike.\n\nIn this regard, the Ethereum 2.0 features and benefits will grasp the attention of entrepreneurs. Ethereum price history and trends are presently pointing toward a bullish price momentum to be seen in the next years. It is expected that cryptocurrency investment opportunities will also increase with time.\n\nParticularly, Ethereum adoption and use cases will additionally surge significantly. Therefore, it is projected that the token might reach $15,555 as its maximum price by 2030. The minimum price level of Ether is predicted to be $12,500. Nevertheless, $14,028 will be the average price level of ETH by that year.\n\nCan Ethereum (ETH) Reach $100,000\n\nAt present no sufficient data is available on whether Ethereum will touch $100,000. However, Ether\u2019s price can reach the price level of $40,000 by the year 2040.\n\nFundamentally, Ethereum is known as a worldwide decentralized software platform that uses blockchain technology. It is usually famous for its local crypto token Ether (ETH). The platform of Ethereum can be utilized to develop any safe digital technology. Its token is structured for payment dealing with the work carried out to support the blockchain. Nonetheless, the members can additionally utilize it for the payment of tangible services and goods if accepted. Nowadays there are many ways to earn free Ethereum. Ethereum is developed to be decentralized, secure, programmable, and scalable.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe huge potential of Ethereum discloses that the\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is Ethereum?

        "title": "What is Optimism: Layer 2 Protocol on Ethereum - Asia Crypto Today",
        "content": "In the ever-evolving world of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, Optimism has emerged as a game-changer in the Ethereum ecosystem. By offering faster transaction speeds and reduced costs, Optimism has quickly gained traction among developers and users alike. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the origins of Optimism, its core technology, and the impact it has had on the Ethereum network.\n\nWe\u2019ll discuss the revolutionary OP token and its role in governance, the creative potential of Optimist NFTs, and the reasons why developers are increasingly drawn to Optimism\u2019s capabilities. So, whether you\u2019re a developer, crypto enthusiast, or simply curious about the future of blockchain technology, this ultimate guide to Optimism is the perfect starting point for your journey.\n\nBackground\n\nOptimism emerged on the scene in June 2019, and within a few months, they had already set up their testnet. However, it took until January 2021 for an alpha mainnet to be introduced, and it wasn\u2019t until December 2021 that Optimism saw a worldwide release with comprehensive compatibility for Ethereum and its EVM. The company was established in 2019, led by a team of experts including Chief Scientist Benjamin Jones, CEO Jinlan Wang, and Protocol Product Manager Kevin Ho.\n\nWhat is Optimism?\n\nOptimism enhances Ethereum transactions by accelerating their speed and reducing their costs through the implementation of advanced data compression methods on a separate blockchain. The core of Optimism\u2019s scaling strategy lies in its use of optimistic rollups, a technique that consolidates multiple transactions into a single transaction. This is then settled on an alternate blockchain, with the transaction receipts sent back to the primary Ethereum blockchain.\n\nOptimistic rollups are a unique type of rollup that \u2018optimistically\u2019 assumes the validity of all transactions within the rollup. This approach saves time as individual transactions don\u2019t require direct proof of validity. Validators in the rollup have a week to examine the rollup if they suspect it contains fraudulent data.\n\nData from a Dune Analytics dashboard reveals that Optimism slashes Ethereum transaction fees, also known as gas fees, by an impressive 129 times. DeFi platforms like Synthetix and Uniswap have embraced this technology, further showcasing its effectiveness.\n\nHow Do Rollups Work?\n\nOptimistic rollups work by aggregating multiple off-chain transactions into large batches before submitting them to the Ethereum network. This approach allows for the distribution of fixed costs across numerous transactions, effectively lowering the fees for end-users. Additionally, optimistic rollups utilize compression techniques to minimize the data volume posted on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe term \u201crollups\u201d is used because these techniques bundle or roll up data from hundreds of transactions, such as non-fungible token (NFT) mints and token swaps, into a single transaction on the Ethereum mainnet (layer 1). By consolidating so many transactions into one, the blockchain transaction or \u201cgas\u201d fee required is reduced to just one transaction, evenly distributed among all participants.\n\n\u201cOptimistic\u201d rollups get their name from the assumption that transactions are valid until proven otherwise, or \u201cinnocent until proven guilty.\u201d A designated time window allows for the challenging of potentially invalid transactions by presenting a \u201cfraud proof\u201d and executing the transactions\u2019 computations based on available state data. Optimism compensates for the gas necessary to carry out the computation of the fraud proof, ensuring the process remains efficient and transparent.\n\nOP Token\n\nOptimism introduced the OP token on May 31, initially distributing 214 million OP tokens for free (known as an \u201cairdrop\u201d) to 231,000 eligible addresses. This initial distribution represented 5% of the total supply of 4.29 billion tokens, with 95% of the supply remaining to be introduced to the market. The Dune Analytics dashboard provides information on the number of users who claimed the first airdrop.\n\nThe initial airdrop led to some dissatisfaction among the Optimism community as a few users claimed their tokens early and proceeded to sell them off.\n\nHolding OP tokens grants individuals the right to participate in The Optimism Collective, a dual-tier governance system consisting of the Token House and the Citizens\u2019 House. The Token House, which is currently operational, oversees technical decisions related to Optimism, including software updates. The Citizens\u2019 House, on the other hand, is responsible for governing public-goods funding decisions.\n\nOptimist NFTs\n\nOptimist NFTs are fully customizable digital avatars designed to represent your personality and establish your web3 identity. With Optimist NFTs, you can create a distinctive avatar that embodies your unique character and interests.\n\nTo craft your personalized avatar and embark on your web3 journey, visit the avatar builder. Here, you can tailor your avatar to reflect your individual style and interests before minting it for the world to see.\n\nCurrently in its Beta phase, Optimist NFTs are only available for minting by voters in RetroPGF 2. Starting in early 2023, a few hundred active addresses will be invited to mint each month based on their involvement in the Optimism Collective and data logged in the AttestationStation.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in minting Optimist NFTs in the future, follow @OptimismFND on Twitter or explore their documentation to discover products that can help build your reputation on Optimism.\n\nAs the Optimism Collective expands to include the entire crypto community, Optimist NFTs will become widely accessible for minting and customization. In the future, new traits can be unlocked depending on your participation within the Optimism ecosystem and the reputation you\u2019ve gained. During the initial stages of the Optimist NFT rollout, make sure to use the same device on which you minted your NFT to guarantee that your traits are accurately returned.\n\nWhy Developers Like Optimism\n\nOptimism is highly attractive to developers due to its seamless compatibility with the layer 2 network and existing Ethereum applications. The ability to create apps on the layer 2 network and ensure smooth functionality with Ethereum has led to a growing number of users and dApps being developed, all while benefiting from Ethereum\u2019s security. Consequently, the number of Optimism transactions has surged over tenfold in the past year.\n\nHowever, Optimism isn\u2019t competing with Ethereum; rather, it complements Ethereum\u2019s scaling strategy, which is centered around a rollup-centric roadmap. Optimistic rollups, such as those implemented by Optimism and Arbitrum (currently the two largest Layer 2 protocols), are designed to boost Ethereum\u2019s throughput. By processing transactions externally, they reduce the computational burden on the Ethereum mainchain, resulting in a significant increase in speed.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs the blockchain and cryptocurrency landscape evolves, Optimism presents itself as a notable development in the Ethereum ecosystem. As we continue to witness new advancements and adoption, it is essential to stay informed and engaged with the technologies that shape our decentralized future. By understanding platforms like Optimism and their role within the broader context, we can make more informed decisions and better anticipate upcoming trends in the blockchain space."
