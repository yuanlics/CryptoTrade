        "title": "Ethereum relies heavily on Amazon servers. Here's why that's a problem - DLNews",
        "content": "The Ethereum ecosystem relies heavily on cloud computing like that provided by Amazon.\n\nAn overreliance on it could cause millions in losses for those staking Ether and impact usability.\n\nDeFi\u2019s main selling point is its decentralisation \u2014 no bosses, no hierarchies, and accessible to all. No other blockchain offers that promise like Ethereum.\n\nBut an overreliance on cloud computing servers including Amazon threatens that decentralisation \u2014 creating weak points that could render Ethereum unusable if such servers go offline.\n\n\u201cWhat good is it to have a diversity of people running nodes and a geographically distributed network if in the end it\u2019s all running with the same cloud provider?\u201d Sajida Zouarhi, a product manager at Blocknative, an Ethereum data analytics firm, told DL News.\n\nMany companies that provide vital Ethereum infrastructure, such as ConsenSys, rely on virtual servers rented from cloud computing providers like Amazon Web Services.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nAnd a large portion of Ethereum\u2019s execution nodes \u2014 software instances responsible for producing new blocks on the network \u2014 are also hosted virtually on cloud servers.\n\nIf too much Ethereum infrastructure is hosted via one provider or at one data centre, any issues \u2014 such as power outages or other technical issues \u2014 threaten to knock large chunks of the network and the technology built on top of it offline.\n\nIt also gives cloud service providers the power to hamstring the blockchain networks which rely on them.\n\n\u201cEthereum could do better,\u201d StrategicHash, a pseudonymous blockchain researcher, told DL News.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nHe cited data from ethernodes.org, which shows 2,439 of Ethereum\u2019s 6,810 nodes are hosted via AWS \u2014 about 35%. \u201cIdeally we want one service provider to hold a maximum of 25%.\u201d\n\nOf these 2,439 AWS-hosted nodes, around 1,395 are located in a single data centre in Ashburn, Virginia.\n\nNOW READ: LBRY founder \u2018won\u2019t respect\u2019 US after judge sides with SEC against decentralised file-sharing firm\n\nStill, cloud hosting \u2014 in particular through AWS \u2014 is popular. It is often cost-effective for smaller organisations that can\u2019t afford to purchase and maintain hardware themselves.\n\nFor those running Ethereum nodes, cloud services are also seen as more reliable, as the large data centres where they\u2019re hosted have access to more stable electricity and internet connections.\n\nSlashing risk\n\nAn AWS outage is unlikely to bring Ethereum to a standstill \u2014 other nodes hosted elsewhere would continue to process transactions.\n\nHowever, StrategicHash said, an outage could still cause a lot of damage.\n\nHe explained that those staking Ether through nodes hosted on AWS would get slashed due to inactivity, resulting in thousands, if not millions of dollars of losses.\n\nSlashing refers to taking away some Ether from nodes who either act maliciously, or don\u2019t do their job correctly, like being offline when they should be checking transactions.\n\nAn outage would also reduce the number of nodes on Ethereum making the network temporarily more centralised and susceptible to attack.\n\nBut while Ethereum will likely keep chugging along, an overreliance on AWS hosting could still be a big problem for the blockchain\u2019s users.\n\n\u2018An AWS incident can have a vast impact on user-facing applications such as hosted frontends or crypto wallets\u2019 \u2014 Pascal Caversaccio\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not that much afraid of any consensus failures due to cloud hosting but rather on its impact on the user,\u201d Pascal Caversaccio, a blockchain security researcher, told DL News.\n\n\u201cAn AWS incident can have a vast impact on user-facing applications such as hosted frontends or crypto wallets,\u201d Caversaccio said.\n\nHe noted MetaMask, the most popular Ethereum wallet with over 21 million monthly users, relies on software hosted on AWS to submit transactions to Ethereum.\n\nIf the AWS servers where this software is hosted go down, MetaMask effectively stops working.\n\nNOW READ: SEC\u2019s probe of puny BarnBridge DAO augurs deep DeFi crackdown\n\nSuch a situation played out last year when Infura, MetaMask\u2019s default remote procedure call provider, which lets the wallet\u2019s users interact with blockchains, experienced an hours-long outage.\n\nWhile the problem can be fixed by switching from MetaMask\u2019s default RPC to a third-party provider, most users won\u2019t have the technical ability to do so.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to actively educate people what to do in such situations,\u201d Caversaccio said.\n\nNot immune\n\nEven DeFi protocols \u2014 which sell themselves on their ability to process transactions around-the-clock \u2014 are not immune. Some rely on AWS.\n\nIn December 2021, an AWS outage caused decentralised exchange dYdX to stop processing transactions. In a tweet, dYdX said \u201cthere are still some parts of the exchange that rely on centralised services,\u201d mentioning AWS specifically.\n\nBut the data shows Ethereum is becoming less reliant on cloud services. In 2020, over 70% of execution nodes were hosted virtually.\n\nSince then, that number has decreased to around 60% as more chose to run nodes from their homes to make the network more decentralised and resilient.\n\nNOW READ: A 20-year-old Argentinian behind the $200m Euler hack says he\u2019s now in a Paris jail\n\nHowever, despite the move away from cloud hosting, Amazon Web Services has become more dominant, and now accounts for a higher proportion of hosted Ethereum nodes than it did before.\n\nAdditionally, there are other ways to benefit from the perks of remote cloud servers while mitigating some of the risks.\n\n\u201cA possible solution is to encourage hosting on bare metal rather than cloud providers,\u201d StrategicHash said.\n\nBare metal refers to physical computer servers that are used by one tenant only, as opposed to cloud servers which share hardware with several other tenants.\n\n\u201cBare Metal is cheaper, faster and is unlikely to go down all at once,\u201d StrategicHash said.\n\nDo you have a tip or information on how DeFi uses cloud computing or another story?

Discover SCENE\n\nThe broader cryptocurrency market is showing green almost across the board today following a U.S. federal judge\u2019s ruling that XRP should not be considered a security in certain contexts. That momentum has propelled Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, over $2,000 for the first time in over two months.\n\nEthereum traded as high as $2,009 this afternoon, per data from CoinGecko, but has dipped slightly to a current price of $1,985 as of this writing. That\u2019s a 5% rise over the past 24 hours, and a 14% gain over the last month.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe last time that Ethereum traded above $2,000 was on May 5, according to CoinGecko. Ethereum briefly popped above $2,100 in April, but other than those two brief time periods, ETH has remained under the $2,000 threshold over the last 11 months.\n\nEven with today\u2019s climb, Ethereum remains down 59% from its peak price point of $4,878 set at the peak of the cryptocurrency market in November 2021.\n\nEthereum is far from the only cryptocurrency or token to benefit from the momentum generated by the XRP ruling, which has propelled XRP\u2019s own price by 81% over the last 24 hours.\n\nAltcoins like Solana, Polygon, and Cardano have each seen double-digit gains today, with Cardano and Polygon both up about 20% apiece. Bitcoin, by comparison, is only up about 2% today as of this writing, but briefly hit $31,444\u2014its highest price in more than a year.\n\nBroadly, the entire cryptocurrency market is up about 5% over the past 24 hours, per CoinGecko."

        "content": "There are several blockchain networks competing for a piece of Ethereum\u2019s smart contract and DeFi market share. Projects like BNB Smart Chain, Cardano, Solana, Tron, Polkadot, and Avalanche are some of the most prominent \u201cEthereum killers\u201d.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a blockchain protocol that supports decentralized applications and smart contracts. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and the most widely used platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nHowever, it also faces some challenges, such as high gas fees, network congestion, scalability issues, and environmental concerns. Therefore, many other blockchain platforms have emerged as potential competitors or alternatives to Ethereum, offering different features and advantages.\n\nIn this article, we are going to examine the most prominent Ethereum competitors and look into pros and cons of 6 crypto projects that are vying to become the next Ethereum.\n\nNative Coin Total Unique Add.

Analyzing the top 6 \u201cEthereum killers\u201d\n\nWhen talking about the \u201cnext Ethereum\u201d, we are referring to cryptocurrency projects that are leveraging blockchain and smart contract technology for developing DeFi and NFT solutions, which is currently the arena Ethereum is dominating thanks to its first mover advantage. In the following sections, we are going to examine six projects with robust feature sets and active communities that could challenge Ethereum\u2019s dominating market share in the future.\n\n1. BNB Smart Chain\n\nBNB Smart Chain (BSC) is a blockchain platform launched by the popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Powered by its native token BNB, BSC aims to provide an alternative to the Ethereum network by offering faster and cheaper transactions. It achieves this by using a different consensus mechanism called Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA). BSC's compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) allows developers to easily migrate their dApps from Ethereum to BSC, leveraging its high throughput and low fees.\n\nWhy is BNB Smart Chain considered the next Ethereum?\n\nThanks to a large number of users, familiar features that are heavily inspired by the Ethereum blockchain, and backing by the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, BNB Smart Chain is considered as the top Ethereum killer.\n\n2. Cardano\n\nCardano (ADA) is a blockchain platform that aims to provide a secure and sustainable infrastructure for the development of decentralized applications and smart contracts. Built using a peer-reviewed academic approach, Cardano boasts a high level of security and scalability. It utilizes a unique consensus algorithm called Ouroboros, which ensures that the network remains decentralized while maintaining fast transaction processing.\n\nWhy is Cardano considered the next Ethereum?\n\nCardano is not only one of the most popular crypto projects but also one of the most actively developed blockchains in the space, making it not only one of the top Ethereum killers, but also a potentially good investment overall.\n\n3. Solana\n\nSolana (SOL) is a high-performance blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications and crypto-currencies. It leverages a unique combination of proof-of-stake (PoS) and proof-of-history (PoH) mechanisms to achieve fast transaction speeds and low fees. Solana's scalability and throughput make it an attractive option for developers looking to build complex applications that require high-performance capabilities.\n\nWhy is Solana considered the next Ethereum?\n\nSolana is one of the most energy-efficient and cheapest crypto networks for transferring value. In addition, Solana features a healthy ecosystem of dApps and an active community, despite SOL\u2019s rapid price decrease last year, due to its connection with the now defunct FTX exchange.\n\n4. Tron\n\nTron (TRX) is a blockchain platform that aims to create a decentralized digital entertainment ecosystem. It focuses on providing a decentralized infrastructure for content creators and consumers in the entertainment industry. Tron offers high throughput and low transaction fees, making it suitable for applications such as gaming, social media, and digital content distribution.\n\nWhy is Tron considered the next Ethereum?\n\nOver the years, Tron has emerged as a credible alternative to Ethereum due to the speed of transactions and overlapping features. Also, Tron has looked to expand its offering in recent years, integrating decentralized file-sharing capabilities with the acquisition of BitTorrent (BTT) and launching a decentralized stablecoin USDD.\n\n5. Polkadot\n\nPolkadot (DOT) is a multi-chain platform that enables the transfer of any type of data or asset across different blockchains. It aims to create a decentralized internet where different blockchains can communicate and share information securely. Polkadot's unique architecture allows for interoperability between different chains, facilitating seamless data transfer and enabling developers to leverage the strengths of multiple blockchains simultaneously.\n\nWhy is Polkadot considered the next Ethereum?\n\nPolkadot was conceived by Gavin Wood, a computer scientist and co-founder of Ethereum. Wood launched Polkadot with the intention of enhancing scalability with \u201cparachains\u201d, which enable parallel processing of transactions, allowing Polkadot to handle a larger volume of transactions compared to Ethereum.\n\n6. Avalanche\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) is a highly scalable blockchain platform that prioritizes speed, security, and decentralization. It utilizes a novel consensus protocol called Avalanche, which enables high throughput and fast finality. Avalanche's unique approach to consensus makes it highly resilient to attacks and allows for quick transaction confirmations, making it an attractive choice for developers seeking a scalable and secure blockchain platform.\n\nWhy is Avalanche considered the next Ethereum?\n\nAvalanche\u2019s focus is on overcoming some of the scalability and speed limitations of Ethereum. While the blockchain itself is capable of processing about 150 times the number of transactions as Ethereum, Avalanche has struggled to build a dApp and NFT ecosystem that could challenge Ethereum, at least so far.\n\nWhich are considered \u201cEthereum killer\u201d coins?\n\nIn addition to the blockchain networks described above, like BNB Smart Chain, Cardano, and Polkadot, there are numerous other platforms considered members of the group of Layer 1 networks called Ethereum killers.\n\nSome examples of blockchain platforms that have an overlapping feature set as Ethereum include several smaller market cap projects, including Cosmos, Ethereum Classic, Near Protocol, Tezos, Algorand, and Fantom.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that several Layer 2 solutions that aim to alleviate scalability issues on the Ethereum network, like Arbitrum, Polygon, and Optimism, are also considered by some as Ethereum competitors. However, that categorization would be somewhat nonsensical, as these solutions aim to enhance the operations of the Ethereum blockchain, not replace it.\n\nAre Bitcoin and Ethereum competitors?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are both cryptocurrencies that use blockchain technology, but they have different purposes and features. Bitcoin is designed as a digital currency and a store of value, while Ethereum is a platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications. Therefore, they are not direct competitors but rather complementary projects that aim to solve different problems using blockchain technology.\n\nHowever, from the perspective of traders and investors, Bitcoin and Ethereum may be seen as competitors as they vie for market share and adoption. Bitcoin is the first and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and it has a high level of security, decentralization, and network effects. Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and it has a high level of innovation, functionality, and scalability. Both cryptocurrencies have their advantages and disadvantages, and their performance may vary depending on market conditions and user demand.\n\nThe bottom line: There are several blockchain platforms vying to become the next Ethereum\n\nEthereum was the first major blockchain platform to build the necessary infrastructure and building blocks to support the creation of decentralized applications, decentralized financial systems, and new tokens, thanks to the ERC-20 token standard. Since its launch in 2015, numerous other networks have tried to overcome Ethereum\u2019s first mover advantage, but to no avail. BSC comes the closest, especially in terms of active users, however, the ecosystem of products and services is considerably smaller on BSC than on Ethereum. Other networks, like Cardano, Solana, and Polkadot, are even further removed, despite their ability to process considerably more transactions and at a lower price than Ethereum\n\nFor more information about whether it is a good idea to buy Ethereum, and what are the pros and cons of investing in Ethereum, you can check the video below."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin All Popped on the Ripple Ruling - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nThe crypto market was on fire on Thursday afternoon after a judge ruled that Ripple (XRP 0.15%) is not a security (in most cases).\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been in a battle against cryptocurrencies this year, but the first case to actually make it to court and nearly to trial is the SEC's suit against Ripple, which was filed in December 2020. There are still questions about how this applies to other tokens and whether the ruling will hold up, but for now, it's a huge win for the industry.\n\nAltcoins are popping the most today, but the big tokens are making nice gains as well. Bitcoin (BTC 0.51%) is up 4.7% in the last 24 hours as of 4 p.m. ET, Ethereum (ETH 0.50%) has risen 7.1%, and Dogecoin (DOGE -0.20%) is up 7%.\n\nSo what\n\nThe judge's ruling concluded that Ripple was a security when it was sold to institutional investors, who they said were speculating on an asset that they would then sell. But it was not a security on the secondary market because a buyer or seller on the secondary market had no way of knowing who was getting their money.\n\nIt's hard to say that this fully clarifies what is and isn't a security in the crypto industry, and it's likely the ruling will be appealed, but for now, the secondary sale of cryptocurrencies appears to be legal. This should help the ongoing trading of existing tokens, and Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin are clear leaders from a market capitalization standpoint.\n\nWhile the secondary trading of cryptocurrencies is legal -- according to this ruling -- the initial sales to institutional investors may not be. That question will go to trial, but that will include hedge funds and venture funds that bought these assets. And it's not even clear how that trial will turn out.\n\nNow what\n\nCrypto investors have been looking for some kind of clarity in the U.S. and clearly jumped on it today. However, this is only a district court ruling, and it's the first of many potential rulings. The SEC continues to go after Coinbase (COIN 0.78%), in particular, and dozens of tokens are involved in that case.\n\nI do think this will push both the courts and lawmakers to act to bring even more clarity to the market. Taking loss after loss in court isn't a good look, and almost everyone in the industry is pushing for clarity about what is and isn't a security in the digital world.\n\nThis clarity could be good for the value of Bitcoin and Dogecoin, which right now are viewed largely as stores of value or speculative assets, which seem to pass regulatory muster, at least in the secondary market. Ethereum may benefit both from secondary trading and clarity over what can be built with NFTs or other blockchain tools.\n\nAt least for today, the crypto market is cheering a judge's ruling, but with the ups and downs we have seen the last few years, the cheering might not last for very long."

However, recent analysis suggests these programs have mixed results.\n\nAfter a series of exploits on the Multichain protocol over the past couple of weeks, the founder of Connext proposed a \u201cSovereign Bridged Token\u201d standard to prevent future issues and exploits.\n\nAlgorand\u2019s decentralized lending protocol is set to wind down by year-end as developers claimed building a borrowing and lending protocol is \u201cno longer a viable path\u201d for the protocol.\n\nThe top 100 DeFi tokens had another mixed week in terms of price action, followed by a late surge on July 13, aided by the partial verdict for Ripple in its fight against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), leading to an 84% surge in the XRP (XRP) price.\n\nEthereum scaling protocols drive zero-knowledge proof use in 2023\n\nEthereum scaling protocols dominate the use of ZK-rollups, with major launches, new research and healthy competition among the key highlights in a sector report published by ZKValidator.\n\nThe node infrastructure operator\u2019s \u201cState of ZK Q2\u201d report reflects on significant events across the ZK ecosystem, with notable launches of ZK-powered layer 2\u2019s highlighting the use of the technology for scaling in comparison with other market segments.\n\nContinue reading\n\nAlgorand decentralized lending protocol Algofi to shut down by end of 2023\n\nAlgofi, the borrowing and lending protocol built on the decentralized finance blockchain Algorand, will soon shut down.\n\nAccording to a July 11 announcement, developers\u2019 \u201cbelief in the strength of Algorand\u2019s technology and novel consensus algorithm has not wavered,\u201d however, the Algofi platform will wind down soon.\n\nContinue reading\n\nBug bounties can help secure blockchain networks, but have mixed results\n\nBug bounties are programs organizations offer to incentivize security researchers or ethical or white hat hackers to find and report vulnerabilities in their software, websites or systems. Bug bounties aim to improve overall security by identifying and fixing potential weaknesses before malicious actors can exploit them.\n\nOrganizations that implement bug bounty programs typically establish guidelines and rules outlining the scope of the program, eligible targets and the types of vulnerabilities they are interested in. Depending on the severity and impact of the discovered vulnerability, they may also define the rewards offered for valid bug submissions, ranging from small amounts of money to significant cash prizes.\n\nContinue reading\n\nArbitrum-based Rodeo Finance exploited for the second time, $1.5 million stolen\n\nArbitrum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Rodeo Finance was exploited for $1.53 million on July 11. The DeFi protocol was exploited using a code vulnerability in its Oracle, leading to a loss of over 810 Ether (ETH). Rodeo Finance was earlier exploited on July 5 for around $89,000 due to a vulnerability in its mintProtocolReserves function.\n\nAccording to data shared by blockchain analytic firm PeckShield, the exploiter later bridged the stolen funds from Arbitrum to Ethereum and swapped 285 ETH for unshETH. The exploiter then deposited the ETH on Eth2 staking. Finally, the exploiter routed the stolen ETH using the popular mixer service Tornado Cash, which exploiters often use as an exit route to obscure the transaction\u2019s footprint.\n\nContinue reading\n\nConnext founder proposes \u2018Sovereign Bridged Token\u2019 standard after Multichain incident\n\nA July 7 Ethereum improvement proposal (EIP) seeks to standardize how tokens are bridged between networks. The \u201cSovereign Bridged Token\u201d standard, or EIP-7281, allows token issuers to create canonical bridges across multiple networks.\n\nThe proposal was co-authored by Arjun Bhuptani, founder of the Connext bridging protocol. In a July 7 social media post, Bhuptani claimed the protocol would help prevent issues like the July 6 Multichain incident, which some experts have described as a hack.\n\nContinue reading\n\nDeFi market overview\n\nDeFi\u2019s total market value saw a bullish surge after three bearish weeks. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that DeFi\u2019s top 100 tokens by market capitalization had a bullish week, with most tokens trading in the green.

        "title": "Do Chinese investors own the majority of ETH? - Protos",
        "content": "A forensic researcher has suggested that Chinese investors may well own the vast majority of ether (ETH) in circulation via a raft of agents, LLCs, directors, advisors, and corporate structures.\n\nAs detailed by @BoringSleuth (aka TruthLabs), Ethereum was one of the first coins to distribute its initial supply through a pre-mine. Rather than a Bitcoin-like fair launch \u2014 distributing coins via mining rewards through the public operation of a blockchain \u2014 Ethereum\u2019s co-founders pre-mined the majority of their currency\u2019s supply at genesis.\n\nThe idea of a \u2018pre-mine\u2019 allocated for early investors and project developers was highly controversial when Ethereum held its initial coin offering (ICO) and it remains so today.\n\nWho owns all those early ETH wallets?\n\nEthereum has been famously tight-lipped about the owners of most of its earliest wallets. Although Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation happily disclose some of their stash, most co-founders and pre-ICO team members received large allocations into anonymous wallets. To this day, most decline to publicly identify their wallets.\n\nAny sophisticated investor would have found it relatively easy to contribute bitcoin to Ethereum\u2019s ICO through anonymous wallets that allowed them to obfuscate their identities and total holdings. In fact, during the ICO, it was extremely simple to contribute bitcoin via multiple wallets in order to hide one\u2019s total ownership \u2014 as well as circumvent Ethereum\u2019s poorly-enforced ICO contribution limits.\n\nICO thresholds per participant proved unenforceable. Indeed, Nansen\u2019s analysis indicates that just 100 of the 8,800 accounts contributing to Ethereum\u2019s ICO received a staggering 40% of that ETH sold.\n\nDespite all of these limitations, researchers have made substantial progress in deanonymizing wallets and providing probabilistic estimates for the supply distribution of ETH.\n\nChinese mines and pre-mines\n\nIn a previous article, Protos detailed Ethereum\u2019s ties to China, including ex-Alibaba partners, a director who worked on Chinese-language apps, interest from the Bank of China, and a unique translation of the ETH whitepaper into Mandarin. Chinese individuals also had an influence on controversial matters like Ethereum\u2019s rollback of The DAO hack in June 2016.\n\nChristine Kim at Galaxy Digital conducted a detailed analysis of ETH supply distribution in June 2022. According to this research, 60% of Ethereum\u2019s total supply was allocated to users before the network\u2019s official launch while 60 million ETH, or about 50% of the total current supply, was allocated to ICO investors.\n\nRead more: Was FTX funded by Chinese capital flight?\n\nCo-founders allocated another 10% (12 million ETH) to early team members and the ostensibly non-profit Ethereum Foundation.\n\nSince then, recipients of the pre-mined supply have sent 10.3 million ETH to exchanges. This means that just 1.3 million ETH haven\u2019t moved.\n\nBut how does this relate to the issue of potential Chinese ownership? Although it\u2019s impossible to quantify the exact amount owned by Chinese investors, it\u2019s undeniable that throughout Ethereum\u2019s history, Chinese investment has always been a top priority.\n\nCourting Chinese investors\n\nWhile raising money for Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin placed great emphasis on courting Chinese investors. For example, he flew to China for a meeting with a number of them, including Wanxiang Group investment manager Deng Chao. Buterin once served as chief scientist at Wanxiang.\n\nFellow Ethereum Foundation board member Shen Bo apparently told Hashkey Group chairman Xiao Feng that the team worried it might not have enough money to launch the mainnet. The team held at least one all-night meeting about the problem. According to Xiao Feng, that was the moment he suggested contributing $500,000 to Ethereum development under Wanxiang Blockchain Labs\u2019 name.\n\nEvery $1,000 invested into Ethereum\u2019s ICO is now worth over $6 million.\n\nAs described in Laura Shin\u2019s book The Cryptopians, Buterin tolerated and supported former executive director Ming Chan for far longer than his co-founders wanted, even after she\u2019d stirred up drama involving members of the Ethereum Foundation board of directors. His motives for keeping her around for so long were unclear, even with her previous work on online Chinese-language projects.\n\nButerin also showed an obsession with learning the Chinese language, even letting it cut into his social life and work on Ethereum for weeks. By 2016, his mastery of Chinese was good enough for him to write and present a keynote address for the Shanghai Wanxiang Blockchain International Week.\n\nButerin and fellow Ethereum co-founder Anthony Di Iorio also joined the ChinaLedger initiative as advisors in May 2016. Supported by the Internet Securities Commission of the Securities Association of China, ChinaLedger aimed to research the creation of \u2018Internet of Everything\u2019 applications that could support businesses working within the Chinese regulatory environment.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that Ethereum\u2019s early marketing included the concept of a \u2018World Computer\u2019 that developers could use to build nearly any blockchain-based app. Chinese entrepreneurs like Jeff Yang were already working on smart contract templates for Ethereum and Polygon. Yang was quoted as saying that China lacked a \u201creal code dev force\u201d \u2014 hinting at the possibility that, as early as 2017, China recognized that it needed Ethereum\u2019s developers as much as Buterin had needed Chinese investment money in 2015.\n\nBy 2017, Wanxiang had become known as a leading promotor of Ethereum adoption in China \u2014 something it would have been unlikely to do if it didn\u2019t have a significant stake in ETH and Ethereum-based apps.\n\nSome people theorized that Wanxiang was one of several fronts that made it possible for Chinese investors to buy up a majority of the ETH supply without raising suspicion. Again, TruthLabs has theorized that Chinese investors, through their various agents and companies, could control up to two-thirds of the ETH supply.\n\nA Chinese subsidiary funded wallets owned by Vitalik Buterin\n\nTruthLabs also found evidence that Wanxiang and its subsidiary, Fenbushi Capital, set up and funded wallets owned by Buterin.\n\nA quick \ud83e\uddf5showing that Wanxiang, Chinese auto and early Ethereum Investor funded and setup Vitalik Buterins official wallets.\n\n\n\n1/6https://t.co/4uMLLnzguq pic.twitter.com/Ec1cjLOLz2 \u2014 TruthLabs \ud83d\udc84 (@BoringSleuth) January 29, 2023 A Chinese entity funded Vitalik Buterin\u2019s ETH wallets.\n\nFenbushi Capital was founded in 2015, the same year that the Ethereum network launched. Buterin had a part-time position at Fenbushi until 2018 and even after leaving the job, retained a position as an advisor.\n\nAs major (and possibly majority) token holders, Chinese investors, including Wanxiang and HashKey, may still strongly influence ETH\u2019s development. And while much of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain is impossible to deanonymize, Wanxiang\u2019s continued support and Buterin\u2019s pro-China behavior throughout history could certainly lend a degree of credence to this theory.\n\nGot a tip?

        "content": "Standard Chartered made a bold prediction for Bitcoin by forecasting that the leading cryptocurrency could reach $120,000 in 2024. Bitcoin is currently trading at $30,300 levels and needs to spike approximately 300% to reach $120,000. While doing 4x in price is nothing new in the cryptocurrency markets, achieving the feat in a bear market is challenging. If Bitcoin rallies as predicted by Standard Chartered, leading altcoins might also reach new highs as they move in tandem with BTC. Ethereum would also follow Bitcoin\u2019s path and reach a new all-time high if the forecasts turn true.\n\nAlso Read: Next Cryptocurrency Bull Run Could Begin in 2024, Predicts Analyst\n\nJUST IN: $820 billion Standard Chartered Bank predicts #Bitcoin will reach $120,000 by the end of 2024. \u2014 Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) July 10, 2023\n\nIf Bitcoin Reaches $120,000, What Will Ethereum\u2019s Price Be?\n\nSource: Unsplash\n\nEthereum moves in tandem with Bitcoin and the two cryptocurrencies are the powerhouse of the digital assets market. If the forecast from Standard Chartered plays out, then Ethereum has more chances of rising 300% similar to BTC. Ethereum is currently trading at $1,870 and a 4x from here could take its price to the $7,500 level. That would be a new all-time high for ETH as its previous high stands at $4,878.\n\nAlso Read: BRICS: U.S. Has 65% Chances of Slipping Into a Recession, India Has 0%\n\nHowever, such a price rise for ETH could occur only if BTC reaches $120,000, as predicted by Standard Chartered. Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that both BTC and ETH could reach $120,000 and $7,500, respectively. The cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and could swing both ways causing losses. It is advised to do thorough research before taking an entry position into Bitcoin and Ethereum at press time.\n\nAlso Read: VeChain: When Will VET Reclaim Its All-Time High of $0.28?\n\nPredictions about Bitcoin climbing above $100,000 is nothing new. Standard Chartered had predicted that BTC would reach $100,000 in 2021 but we all know how that played out. You can read the bold price prediction by the leading bank here to refresh your memory. Therefore, bold forecasts for BTC and the cryptocurrency markets, in general, should be seen with skeptical eyes."

        "content": "Bankruptcy can be expensive, but perhaps less so when the Ethereum blockchain helps cover costs.\n\nJust ask Celsius. After filing for bankruptcy last July, estimates pegged the total compensation of its lawyers at $144 million.\n\nAnd that was before the US agencies sued the company into oblivion \u2014 amounting to a $4.7 billion Federal Trade Commission (FTC) settlement, designated to be repaid to customers.\n\nGood thing for Celsius is it\u2019s been staking ether (ETH) under its control over the past two years, not only earning it staking rewards (currently around 5%, paid in ETH) but additional maximal extractable value (MEV) as well.\n\nBlockworks analyzed blockchain data for known Ethereum addresses tied to Celsius\u2019 estate. Aside from around $114 million in ETH sitting in its addresses, Celsius has:\n\nStaked at least 356,600 ETH ($711 million) staked directly to mainnet.\n\nDeposited another 415,000 ETH ($827 million) with staking provider Figment.\n\nEarned an additional 5,100 ETH ($10 million) direct from MEV bots.\n\nCelsius took a break before staking almost 400,000 ETH last month \u2014 almost a year into bankruptcy\n\nMEV is neutral, but controversial\n\nEthereum validators can run code alongside their clients to communicate with special MEV-boosting relays.\n\nEntities known as \u201cblock builders\u201d maintain those relays. With the help of number-crunching \u201csearchers,\u201d builders present validators with more profitable orders, which add transactions to Ethereum blocks.\n\nGains made by reordering transactions are split between block builders, searchers and validators like Celsius, which began raking in MEV as soon as Ethereum switched to proof-of-stake last September.\n\nThat was only a few months after Celsius entered bankruptcy, shattered by contagion after algorithmic stablecoin Terra and defunct hedge fund firm Three Arrows Capital failed.\n\nCelsius has received nearly 42,000 payments from MEV bots to date, ranging from an eye-popping 72.76 ETH ($144,000) last November to a tiny fraction of an ETH.\n\nMEV tactics include uber-quick arbitrage, front-running and so-called \u201csandwich attacks,\u201d all taking place within the same block. Those tactics have operated in somewhat of a gray area.\n\nSome consider it exploitative, considering profit is milked from mostly unaware Ethereum users. The permissionless nature of the Ethereum ecosystem means no one can really stop it.\n\nFlashbots, one of the primary studios building MEV software, has previously proposed fair market guidelines to help keep MEV boosters in check, and has even released tools that could help protect Ethereum users from being front-run by bots.\n\nAround 80 different MEV builders have sent profits to Celsius\n\nMEV faucet handy for Celsius\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much of Celsius\u2019 staked ETH belongs to the company itself and what percentage is earmarked for users (now creditors). Celsius has staked ETH as recently as this month.\n\nEither way, the overseers of the bankrupt Celsius\u2019 crypto smartly left its validators open to MEV builders \u2014 signaling willingness to finalize blocks from prolific builders for a cut.\n\nNovaWulf, an asset manager tied to Maryland bitcoin miner TeraWulf, was \u2014 as of April \u2014 set to manage Celsius\u2019 crypto via a new company for five years once users had been paid.\n\nBut that was one month before a consortium of crypto companies, jokingly named Fahrenheit, outbid NovaWulf and others for management of a to-be-formed firm pegged to control Celsius\u2019 assets for the betterment of creditors.\n\nArrington Capital, which makes up part of the consortium, declined to comment on whether it would continue earning MEV once that happens. NovaWulf did not respond to requests for comment. Neither firm was responsible for managing Celsius\u2019 crypto at the time its ETH was staked.\n\nIn any case, with Celsius earning $1 million MEV per month on average right now, it would still take another 11 years to generate enough to pay its previous legal fee projection (at current prices).\n\nAfter that, it would take another 380 years of MEV to pay off its massive FTC fine.\n\nA few bull markets could knock some decades off that number.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

The Ethereum blockchain is a decentralized platform that enables the creation and execution of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with predefined rules and conditions. These smart contracts power the functionality and behavior of Ethereum tokens.\n\nEthereum tokens can represent a wide range of digital and physical assets, such as cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, security tokens, and even real-world assets like real estate or commodities. They are created using Ethereum\u2019s token standards, particularly the ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards.\n\nThe ERC-20 standard is the most common and widely adopted token standard on the Ethereum blockchain. It defines a set of rules and functions that a token contract must implement to be considered ERC-20 compliant. These functions include the ability to transfer tokens, check token balances, and approve token allowances for other addresses. ERC-20 tokens are fungible, meaning each token is identical and interchangeable with other tokens of the same type. Examples of ERC-20 tokens include popular cryptocurrencies like Ether (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and Chainlink (LINK).\n\nOn the other hand, the ERC-721 standard is used for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Unlike ERC-20 tokens, NFTs are unique and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis. Each NFT has distinct properties and metadata, making them ideal for representing ownership of unique digital assets like digital art, collectibles, virtual real estate, and more. The ERC-721 standard provides functions for token ownership, transfer, and metadata retrieval.\n\nCreating an Ethereum token typically involves deploying a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. The smart contract defines the token\u2019s properties, such as its name, symbol, decimal places, and total supply. It also implements the necessary functions for token transfers, balance checks, and other functionalities specific to the token\u2019s use case.\n\nOnce a token is deployed, it can be traded and exchanged on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap or centralized exchanges (CEXs) that support Ethereum-based tokens. Additionally, tokens can be stored in Ethereum-compatible wallets, such as MetaMask or MyEtherWallet, which provide users with control over their token balances and enable them to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nEthereum tokens have gained significant popularity due to the versatility and flexibility provided by the Ethereum blockchain. They have enabled the creation of new economic models, fundraising mechanisms (Initial Coin Offerings or ICOs), decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and innovative digital experiences through NFTs. The Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve, with ongoing upgrades like Ethereum 2.0 aiming to improve scalability, security, and sustainability, further enhancing the capabilities and potential of Ethereum tokens.\n\nAlso read: Top 10 Impact Of Ethereum On NFT And The Art World\n\nImportance of Ethereum Tokens for the Economy\n\nEthereum tokens play a crucial role in the economy by enabling new forms of value transfer, economic models, and financial innovation. Here are several key aspects highlighting the importance of Ethereum tokens for the economy:\n\n1. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Ethereum tokens are the backbone of the burgeoning decentralized finance sector. DeFi applications leverage smart contracts and Ethereum tokens to create decentralized versions of traditional financial instruments, such as lending, borrowing, decentralized exchanges, stablecoins, yield farming, and more. These applications provide individuals with greater access to financial services, remove intermediaries, and promote financial inclusion.\n\n2. Tokenization of Assets: Ethereum tokens enable the tokenization of real-world assets, such as real estate, art, commodities, and intellectual property. By representing these assets as tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, their ownership and transfer become more efficient, transparent, and accessible. Tokenization also enables fractional ownership, allowing smaller investors to participate in traditionally high-entry markets. This innovation unlocks liquidity and expands investment opportunities.\n\n3. Fundraising and Crowdfunding: Ethereum tokens have revolutionized fundraising models through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs). Projects can issue utility tokens to raise capital directly from the public, eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries. This democratization of fundraising enables innovative projects to access capital globally and empowers investors of various sizes to participate in early-stage investments.\n\n4. Incentive Mechanisms: Ethereum tokens can be used to incentivize desired behaviors within decentralized applications and ecosystems. Tokens can be awarded for participation, content creation, contribution to governance, or other activities that contribute to the growth and sustainability of the network. This incentivization fosters active community engagement, rewards early adopters, and aligns stakeholders\u2019 interests.\n\n5. Programmability and Smart Contracts: Ethereum tokens can be programmed with smart contracts, enabling them to have dynamic functionalities and capabilities beyond simple value transfer. Smart contracts can automate complex business logic, enforce rules, and create unique token ecosystems. For example, tokens can implement staking mechanisms, dividend distributions, voting rights, or even execute complex decentralized applications.\n\n6. Liquidity and Exchangeability: Ethereum tokens are tradable on various decentralized and centralized exchanges, providing liquidity and market access for token holders. Liquidity is vital for the efficient functioning of markets, enabling users to buy, sell, or exchange tokens easily. The ability to trade tokens globally and around the clock promotes economic activity, price discovery, and investment opportunities.\n\n7. Open and Permissionless Innovation: Ethereum tokens facilitate open and permissionless innovation, allowing developers from around the world to build applications and services on top of the Ethereum blockchain. The ease of creating tokens and interacting with the Ethereum network encourages experimentation, fosters entrepreneurship, and drives technological advancements in various industries.\n\nThe importance of Ethereum tokens for the economy is continually growing as the ecosystem expands and matures. The combination of decentralized finance, asset tokenization, fundraising mechanisms, programmability, liquidity, and open innovation creates new economic possibilities, promotes financial inclusion, and empowers individuals to participate in a more equitable and accessible global economy.\n\nTop 10 Ethereum Tokens with the Most Promising Potential\n\nEthereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain system that features its own cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH). ETH is used to pay for gas, which is required to power the execution of smart contracts and other decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum network. The Ethereum ecosystem is home to a wide variety of tokens, each with its own unique purpose and potential. Here are 10 of the most promising Ethereum tokens to watch in 2023: Chainlink (LINK) is a decentralized oracle network that provides secure, reliable, and tamper-proof data to smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. LINK tokens are used to pay for data feeds and computations on the Chainlink network. Uniswap (UNI) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows users to swap ERC-20 tokens without the need for a centralized intermediary. UNI tokens are used to govern the Uniswap protocol and participate in its decision-making process. Aave (AAVE) is a decentralized lending protocol that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies with interest. AAVE tokens are used to govern the Aave protocol and participate in its decision-making process. SushiSwap (SUSHI) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that is similar to Uniswap. SUSHI tokens are used to govern the SushiSwap protocol and participate in its decision-making process. MakerDAO (MKR) is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that issues the Dai stablecoin. MKR tokens are used to govern the MakerDAO protocol and participate in its decision-making process. Compound (COMP) is a decentralized lending protocol that is similar to Aave. COMP tokens are used to govern the Compound protocol and participate in its decision-making process. Synthetix (SNX) is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that allows users to mint synthetic assets, which are tokens that track the price of real-world assets such as stocks, commodities, and currencies. SNX tokens are used to secure the Synthetix network and participate in its governance. The Sandbox (SAND) is a blockchain-based virtual world where users can create, build, and monetize their own experiences. SAND tokens are used to purchase in-game assets and participate in the governance of the Sandbox metaverse. Decentraland (MANA) is another blockchain-based virtual world where users can own and customize their own plots of land. MANA tokens are used to purchase in-game assets and participate in the governance of the Decentraland metaverse. Enjin Coin (ENJ) is a gaming token that allows users to create and manage in-game items on the Ethereum blockchain. ENJ tokens are used to back the value of in-game items, ensuring that they have real-world value. These are just a few of the many Ethereum tokens with promising potential in 2023. The Ethereum ecosystem is constantly evolving, and new and innovative tokens are being launched all the time. It is important to do your own research before investing in any cryptocurrency, and to remember that the crypto market is volatile and prices can fluctuate wildly. However, if you are looking for Ethereum tokens with the potential to deliver high returns, the tokens listed above are worth considering. News came out that the Brazilian Central Bank is launching a CBDC pilot using an ERC20 token standard with built in abilities to freeze and control transactions. Ethereum Co-Founder Joseph Lubin laid out all these plans last year. If you can't beat them, join them, I guess.\ud83e\udee0 pic.twitter.com/U520bGXhSO \u2014 Sam Callahan (@samcallah) July 12, 2023\n\nRisks associated with Ethereum Tokens\n\nWhile Ethereum tokens offer significant opportunities and benefits, they also come with certain risks. Understanding these risks is crucial for investors, users, and developers involved in the Ethereum ecosystem. Here are some key risks associated with Ethereum tokens:\n\n1. Smart Contract Risks: Ethereum tokens rely on smart contracts, which are software programs that execute predefined rules and conditions. Smart contracts are susceptible to coding errors, vulnerabilities, or exploits that can lead to significant financial losses. Bugs or vulnerabilities in smart contracts can be exploited to drain funds, manipulate token balances, or disrupt token functionalities. It is essential to conduct thorough code audits, security assessments, and testing before deploying or interacting with smart contracts.\n\n2. Regulatory and Legal Risks: The regulatory landscape surrounding Ethereum tokens is evolving and can vary across jurisdictions. Regulatory agencies may impose restrictions, licensing requirements, or enforcement actions that can impact the issuance, trading, or use of Ethereum tokens. Uncertainty in legal frameworks, compliance obligations, and potential changes in regulations pose risks to token projects and participants.\n\n3. Market Volatility: Ethereum tokens, especially cryptocurrencies, are subject to significant price volatility. The value of tokens can experience sharp fluctuations due to market speculation, investor sentiment, regulatory announcements, or macroeconomic factors. Token holders may face substantial losses or gains depending on market conditions, and sudden price movements can impact the liquidity and stability of token markets.\n\n4. Liquidity Risks: While Ethereum tokens offer liquidity through decentralized and centralized exchanges, smaller or less popular tokens may face liquidity challenges. Low trading volumes can result in wider bid-ask spreads, making it difficult to buy or sell tokens at desired prices. Illiquid markets can also be prone to market manipulation and price manipulation schemes.\n\n5. Security Risks: Ethereum tokens are stored in wallets, which can be vulnerable to hacking, phishing attacks, or other security breaches. If an individual\u2019s wallet is compromised, the tokens stored within can be stolen or transferred without authorization. It is essential to follow best security practices, such as using hardware wallets, enabling multi-factor authentication, and being cautious of phishing attempts.\n\n6. Scalability and Network Congestion: Ethereum\u2019s scalability limitations can result in network congestion during periods of high demand. This congestion can lead to delays, higher transaction fees, or even temporary suspension of token transfers. Projects relying heavily on Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure may face challenges in delivering a seamless user experience during times of network congestion.\n\n7. Governance and Consensus Risks: Ethereum tokens that are part of decentralized governance systems rely on consensus mechanisms and community-driven decision-making. However, disputes, disagreements, or concentration of power among token holders or network participants can impact the governance process, potentially leading to contentious hard forks, network splits, or governance gridlocks.\n\n8. Counterparty Risks: Ethereum tokens often involve interactions with third-party platforms, decentralized applications, or service providers. These interactions introduce counterparty risks, including the risk of platform hacks, exit scams, or insolvency of third-party services. Users should exercise caution and conduct due diligence before relying on or transacting with external entities.\n\nIt is important to note that the risks associated with Ethereum tokens are not exclusive to Ethereum but are inherent to the broader blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem. Participants should evaluate and manage these risks by conducting thorough research, exercising caution, employing best security practices, and diversifying their token holdings. Additionally, staying informed about the evolving regulatory landscape and market conditions is crucial to navigate the risks effectively.\n\nAlso read: How To Secure Ethereum Assets- Top 10 Ways To Avoid Scams And Hacks\n\nFuture of Ethereum Tokens\n\nThe future of Ethereum tokens holds great potential as the Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve and address key challenges. Here are several aspects that shape the future of Ethereum tokens:\n\n1. Ethereum 2.0: Ethereum is undergoing a significant upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0, which aims to improve scalability, security, and sustainability. The upgrade introduces a new consensus mechanism called Proof of Stake (PoS) and shard chains to increase network capacity. Ethereum 2.0 will enhance the scalability of the Ethereum blockchain, enabling it to process a larger number of transactions and accommodate more users and applications. This scalability improvement will benefit Ethereum tokens by providing a more efficient and cost-effective environment for their creation, use, and exchange.\n\n2.

The emergence of protocols like Polkadot and Cosmos allows tokens to move seamlessly between different blockchains, facilitating cross-chain interactions and creating a more connected and accessible token ecosystem. Improved interoperability will expand the reach and utility of Ethereum tokens, fostering collaboration and innovation across different blockchain networks.\n\n3. Layer 2 Scaling Solutions: Layer 2 scaling solutions, such as state channels, sidechains, and rollups, are being developed to address the scalability limitations of Ethereum. These solutions enable the execution of transactions off the main Ethereum chain, reducing congestion and lowering transaction costs. Layer 2 solutions will enhance the usability and scalability of Ethereum tokens, making them more practical for everyday transactions and fostering wider adoption.\n\n4. DeFi Innovation: Ethereum tokens are at the forefront of the decentralized finance (DeFi) revolution. DeFi applications built on Ethereum provide innovative financial services, including lending, borrowing, decentralized exchanges, yield farming, and more. As DeFi continues to grow, Ethereum tokens will play a pivotal role in enabling new financial models, expanding access to global markets, and disrupting traditional financial systems. DeFi innovation will further drive demand and utility for Ethereum tokens.\n\n5. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): Non-fungible tokens have gained significant attention and adoption, particularly on the Ethereum blockchain. NFTs represent unique digital assets such as artwork, collectibles, virtual real estate, and more. The future of Ethereum tokens will see continued growth in the NFT space, with enhanced functionalities, improved user experiences, and increased integration with various industries, including gaming, art, music, and virtual reality.\n\n6. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): Ethereum tokens may play a role in the development and implementation of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Several central banks worldwide are exploring the potential of blockchain technology and may choose to issue CBDCs on platforms like Ethereum. Integrating CBDCs with Ethereum tokens would provide programmability, interoperability, and efficient payment infrastructures, further enhancing the usability and utility of Ethereum tokens.\n\n7. Institutional Adoption: Increasing institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology is likely to impact the future of Ethereum tokens. As more traditional financial institutions, asset managers, and corporations embrace digital assets, Ethereum tokens will gain recognition and investment interest. This institutional adoption can drive liquidity, stability, and broader acceptance of Ethereum tokens in traditional financial markets.\n\n8. Enhanced Privacy and Security: Privacy and security features are continually being improved within the Ethereum ecosystem. Initiatives like zk-SNARKs, zero-knowledge proofs, and privacy-focused solutions are being developed to enhance privacy for token transactions while maintaining transparency and auditability.

        "content": "The dynamics of the crypto-verse keep shifting. Although numerous new assets have emerged, Bitcoin [BTC] has maintained its position as the top cryptocurrency in terms of value. While its position remains unchallenged, the network activity of other assets has been gaining momentum and showing signs of strength.\n\nDespite Ethereum [ETH] being significantly lower than Bitcoin in terms of price and market capitalization, the ETH network appears to be significantly more active compared to Bitcoin. This is evident from the spike in daily transactions on the Ethereum network. According to data provided by IntoTheBlock, Ethereum recorded about 944.5K daily transactions over a 30-day period, whereas Bitcoin processed a considerably lower number of transactions at only 507.5K.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum is not the sole network that has surpassed Bitcoin in transaction volume. The Algorand network recorded an impressive 540.9K daily transactions, once again surpassing Bitcoin\u2019s transaction count. This development is surprising considering the recent dip in ALGO\u2019s price. The asset has experienced a decline of more than 10.54% over the past seven days.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin: Rising Outflows & Institutions Is Setting a Bullish Path\n\nAs seen in the above image, Avalanche [AVAX] and Litecoin [LTC] demonstrated significant transaction activity. The Avalanche network successfully handled a cumulative total of 384.4K transactions. Litecoin stood out prominently due to the growing excitement surrounding its upcoming halving event. The crypto network recorded approximately 129.3K transactions. The disparity between Bitcoin, Ethereum, Algorand, and these networks is quite high.\n\nAlso Read: Litecoin Halving \u2018Hype\u2019 Fails to Rally Price Despite High Interest\n\nDogecoin fails to rake in network activity\n\nMeme coins have gained significant popularity within the crypto industry, occasionally even surpassing the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of public interest. Nonetheless, Dogecoin [DOGE] did not manage to make a notable impact on this occasion. The network of this meme coin registered a modest number of transactions, totaling just 70.1K over the past month. It should be noted that DOGE recorded an uptrend of 6.23% throughout the month.\n\nThese above-seen data highlight the ever-changing nature of the crypto ecosystem. However, the future remains uncertain in terms of how these networks will adapt to the industry.\n\nAlso Read: Dogecoin: Miners Add Millions of DOGE to Reserves, What Now?"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nReady. Set. GHO.\n\nAave Companies is moving ahead to launch its new decentralized stablecoin, that will be native to its Aave Protocol, on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nAave said in a release that its new stablecoin (the name is pronounced \u201cgo\u201d) is designed to offer more transparency for users and will be minted through an array of collateral assets held by users across the Aave Protocol. By making use of this mix of assets, Aave says it will offer more flexibility to its users.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRight now, Aave already has pools that users can access for 30 Ethereum-based tokens, including other stablecoins like Tether and USDC. It also offers pools that count real-world assets, like real-estate, that can be tokenized for purchase or held as collateral.\n\nA stablecoin is an entirely digital token that draws its value from its peg to a fiat currency or other asset. For Aave, issuing a stablecoin is meant to improve accessibility for users across its ecosystem at lower cost and improve efficiency within its market.\n\nThe idea of launching GHO first emerged through a proposal to the Aave DAO in June 2022. After receiving the community\u2019s approval to go ahead, it was deployed in February to the Ethereum Testnet, a network used by developers to tinker with their protocols ahead of being deployed.\n\nGHO differs from some of its stablecoin peers, like MakerDAO's DAI, in the way it can be minted through the deposited collateral. Unlike DAI which requires separate vaults for each asset used for minting, different types of GHO collateral can be deposited in one transaction.\n\nTrue to its decentralized nature, Aave\u2019s DAO will be responsible for adjusting interest rates, setting mint caps, and governing who will be allowed to mint GHO based on a set of predetermined conditions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMinting will also be enabled by a set of users Aave calls \u201cfacilitators,\u201d which go through an approval process from the Aave DAO to get this status. Depending on their class, a facilitator will have the ability to mint up to a certain amount of GHO, or offer redemptions between GHO and other assets.\n\nCurrently, the company only intends to launch GHO on Ethereum's mainnet, but the company said it would submit a multi-chain plan to the rest of the community for approval. Specifics weren\u2019t available at the time of writing."

        "content": "CryptoPunks have been back in the news of late. Seedphrase, a DJ who owns the rarest CryptoPunks NFT out there (CryptoPunk #8348), announced this month that he had signed to talent agency WME for a new record release. And in June, Yuga Labs\u2014which acquired CryptoPunks in May 2022\u2014announced that it intended to release a book on the popular NFTs. So what, exactly, is this oddly-named commodity with its pixellated avatars?\n\nYuga Labs Is Writing the Book on CryptoPunks\u2014Literally\n\nThe market for crypto collectibles released as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) exploded in 2021, with $2.5 billion in transaction volume in the first six months as NFTs entered the mainstream.\n\nCryptoPunk DJ Seedphrase Signs to WME, Plans to Release Music\n\nThe boom also saw NFT enthusiasts rediscovering some of the earliest non-fungible tokens, propelling the value of these crypto collectibles to hitherto-unknown highs.\n\nOne of these early NFT projects was CryptoPunks: a set of randomly generated pixel-based avatars. Some of the rarest, most desirable CryptoPunks have sold for millions of dollars. Seriously! By mid-2022, the tokens had seen over $2 billion total sales volume.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about one of the most popular NFT collections around.\n\nWhat are CryptoPunks?\n\nCreated by development studio Larva Labs, CryptoPunks are a series of 10,000 images tokenized as NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. An NFT is effectively a deed of ownership to a digital item, and in this case, holding a CryptoPunks NFT means that you are the sole owner of a one-of-a-kind pixel avatar. As mentioned above, ownership of CryptoPunks changed hands from Larva to Yuga Labs in May 2022. Yuga is the creator of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT.\n\nBeginner's Guide to NFTs: What Are Non-Fungible Tokens?\n\nEach CryptoPunk is randomly generated from a list of dozens of attributes, which means there\u2019s an array of designs: people, zombies, apes, and even aliens. The aliens and zombies are among the most popular avatars that have commanded some of the highest sale prices to date.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhere did CryptoPunks come from?\n\nBelieve it or not, CryptoPunks were released for free back in 2017. Ethereum\u2019s ERC-721 non-fungible token standard wasn\u2019t even a thing at that point, and the two-person team at Larva Labs released them as an experiment. Ethereum wallet owners snatched up the 9,000 CryptoPunks that were released to the public, while Larva Labs held onto the rest.\n\nEthereum NFT CryptoPunks Hit $1 Billion in Total Sales\n\nNFT volume gradually rose over the next three years, but it wasn\u2019t until late 2020 and especially early 2021 that demand skyrocketed for these provably scarce digital collectibles. The secondary market value for CryptoPunks shot through the roof, leading to multi-million-dollar NFT sales, auctions at Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s, and a wealth of CryptoPunks used as Twitter profile pictures.\n\nWhat\u2019s so special about them?\n\nCryptoPunks have some high-profile owners, too, such as rapper Jay-Z, YouTube personality Logan Paul and tennis champion Serena Williams.\n\nOn top of that, there are clear differentiators that make certain CryptoPunks more desirable and valuable to collectors. Alien avatars are the rarest of the randomized images, and as such, alien CryptoPunks are among the most expensive NFTs sold to date. Ape and zombie designs are also in demand.\n\nMost of the CryptoPunks just look like humans with varying features and accessories, however, and the plainer-looking ones are close to the market floor in terms of asking price on NFT marketplaces.\n\nThe future\n\nWhat\u2019s next for CryptoPunks? Well, they will likely continue to change hands on secondary markets, potentially generating huge returns for investors who bought in before the surge.\n\nThere\u2019s no way to tell whether the current level of demand will continue, but the entry-level price for Punks continues to rise. As of July 14, 2023, the average CryptoPunk NFT goes for about 53 ETH (about $2000)\n\nThis story was originally published on January 10, 2022 and was updated on July 14, 2023."

        "title": "Guide to Base - Coinbase",
        "content": "How Base Works\n\nBase is being built on the Bedrock release of the OP (Optimism) Stack which is designed to make Optimism as close & equivalent as possible to Ethereum. The Bedrock release brings maximum compatibility with the existing Ethereum developer experience. The OP Stack is a series of modules across the consensus, execution and settlement layers that work together to form coherent and reliable blockchains. The Bedrock release has streamlined the ability to swap out different components of the OP Stack codebase and add new functionalities & capabilities. This modular architecture allows you to not only modify specific modules but swap them out entirely (for example swapping out Ethereum in favor of Celestia for the data availability layer).\n\nSource : Introducing the OP Stack\n\nThe above diagram from the Optimism Collective highlights how modules can be swapped out across the Consensus, Execution and Settlement Layers. The items highlighted in white are modules that were released as a part of the Bedrock upgrade, whereas the items highlighted in yellow represent WIPs or simply are there to emphasize that you could create your own new module to provide functionality to that particular layer - hence the \u201cPokemon?!\u201d callout.\n\nAs of today, the above diagram notes that the Execution Layer has an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) module . The Ethereum Virtual Machine is a piece of software that executes smart contracts & computes the state of the Ethereum network after each new block is added - more details can be found in this article as it relates to Ethereum specifically . In the case of the modular OP Stack, this is a lightly modified version of the EVM that adds functionality for L2 transactions initiated on the L1 (Ethereum) and adds an additional L1 data fee for each transaction to account for the fee/gas needed to publish this transaction to the L1 (Ethereum).\n\nAdditionally, the diagram references a Governance module in the Settlement Layer, which is a set of tools & processes to manage system configurations, upgrades, and design decisions.\n\nThe Optimistic Rollup\n\nThe OP Stack utilizes an Optimistic Rollup to govern how state commitments are published to the L1 (Ethereum). An optimistic rollup is a way of scaling Ethereum that involves moving computation and state storage off-chain - e.g. off Ethereum. Optimistic rollups, such as Base, execute transactions outside of Ethereum, but post transaction data to the Ethereum mainnet as calldata.\n\nBase combines off-chain transactions together in batches before sending them to Ethereum, which enables the spreading of fixed costs across multiple transactions in each batch - leading to reduced fees for those using Base and other Optimistic rollups.\n\nOptimistic rollups are called \u2018Optimistic\u2019 because they assume off-chain transactions are valid and don\u2019t publish proofs of validity for transaction batches posted on-chain. Optimistic rollups instead rely on a fraud-proving process whereby anyone can challenge a rollup batch during a set time window by computing a fault proof .\n\nInteraction with Ethereum\n\nRollups built using the OP Stack interact with the Layer 1 through a series of smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum network. There are two key components of the optimistic rollup architecture:\n\nOn-chain Contracts: The optimistic rollup utilizes smart contracts running on Ethereum. This includes contracts that: store rollup blocks, monitor state updates on the rollup, and track user deposits.\n\nOff-chain Virtual Machine: Computation and state storage occur on Base and not the Ethereum Virtual Machine. This off-chain virtual machine is where applications live and operate.\n\nSource : Optimistic Rollups\n\nIntroduction to Sequencers\n\nL2s built on the OP Stack, such as Base, have sequencer(s) that post data to the underlying L1 (Ethereum).\n\nA sequencer has the task of accurately executing transactions received.\n\nCore sequencer tasks\n\nProvides transaction confirmations and state updates\n\nConstructs and executes L2 blocks\n\nSubmits user transactions to the L1 (Ethereum)\n\nSource : Rollup Protocol\n\nBase blocks are produced every two seconds, regardless of whether they are empty (no transactions), filled up to the block gas limit with transactions, or somewhere in the middle.\n\nTransactions Get to the Sequencer in Two Ways\n\nTransactions submitted on the L1 (which are called deposits in the OP Stack) are included in the chain in the appropriate L2 block. Every L2 block is identified by the \u2018Epoch\u2019, which is the L1 (Ethereum) block to which it corresponds. The first block of the epoch includes all the deposits that happened in the L1 block to which it corresponds. If a sequencer attempts to ignore a legitimate L1 transaction it ends up with a state that is inconsistent with the verifiers, just as if the sequencer attempted to fake the state through another mechanism. This provides L2s built using the OP Stack with Ethereum level censorship resistance. Transactions submitted directly to the sequencer on the L2.\n\nSource : Rollup Protocol\n\nThe Requirements for the Processing of a Rollup Transaction\n\nThe transaction needs to be written to L1 (Ethereum). This role is normally performed by op-batcher, but any user can send an L1 transaction to submit an L2 transaction (known as \"forced inclusion\"), in which case op-batcher is bypassed. The transaction needs to be executed to modify the state (by op-geth). Periodically, op-proposer writes a commitment of the post-transaction state to L1. Note that op-proposer does not need to write an L1 commitment after each L2 block; instead it happens at a consistent period measured in L1 blocks.\n\nSource : Transaction Flow\n\nCompression & Posting to the L1 (Ethereum)\n\nThe batcher combines sequencer batches into channels. When a channel is full, it is posted to the L1 either as a stand alone transaction or as a batch of multiple transactions.\n\nSource : Transaction Flow\n\nBridging Assets\n\nBase is designed to allow users to send arbitrary messages between smart contracts on the L2 (Base) and L1 (Ethereum), making it feasible to transfer digital assets, including ERC20 tokens, between the two layers.

        "content": "In brief CryptoPunks is an Ethereum-based NFT project from 2017, making it one of the earliest examples of crypto collectibles.\n\nPrices skyrocketed as the wider NFT market expanded in 2021, leading to numerous sales in excess of $1 million each.\n\nYour Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCryptoPunks have been back in the news of late. Seedphrase, a DJ who owns the rarest CryptoPunks NFT out there (CryptoPunk #8348), announced this month that he had signed to talent agency WME for a new record release. And in June, Yuga Labs\u2014which acquired CryptoPunks in May 2022\u2014announced that it intended to release a book on the popular NFTs. So what, exactly, is this oddly-named commodity with its pixellated avatars?\n\nThe market for crypto collectibles released as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) exploded in 2021, with $2.5 billion in transaction volume in the first six months as NFTs entered the mainstream.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe boom also saw NFT enthusiasts rediscovering some of the earliest non-fungible tokens, propelling the value of these crypto collectibles to hitherto-unknown highs.\n\nOne of these early NFT projects was CryptoPunks: a set of randomly generated pixel-based avatars. Some of the rarest, most desirable CryptoPunks have sold for millions of dollars. Seriously! By mid-2022, the tokens had seen over $2 billion total sales volume.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about one of the most popular NFT collections around.\n\nWhat are CryptoPunks?\n\nCreated by development studio Larva Labs, CryptoPunks are a series of 10,000 images tokenized as NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. An NFT is effectively a deed of ownership to a digital item, and in this case, holding a CryptoPunks NFT means that you are the sole owner of a one-of-a-kind pixel avatar. As mentioned above, ownership of CryptoPunks changed hands from Larva to Yuga Labs in May 2022. Yuga is the creator of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT.\n\nEach CryptoPunk is randomly generated from a list of dozens of attributes, which means there\u2019s an array of designs: people, zombies, apes, and even aliens. The aliens and zombies are among the most popular avatars that have commanded some of the highest sale prices to date.\n\nWhere did CryptoPunks come from?\n\nBelieve it or not, CryptoPunks were released for free back in 2017. Ethereum\u2019s ERC-721 non-fungible token standard wasn\u2019t even a thing at that point, and the two-person team at Larva Labs released them as an experiment. Ethereum wallet owners snatched up the 9,000 CryptoPunks that were released to the public, while Larva Labs held onto the rest.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNFT volume gradually rose over the next three years, but it wasn\u2019t until late 2020 and especially early 2021 that demand skyrocketed for these provably scarce digital collectibles. The secondary market value for CryptoPunks shot through the roof, leading to multi-million-dollar NFT sales, auctions at Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s, and a wealth of CryptoPunks used as Twitter profile pictures.\n\nWhat\u2019s so special about them?\n\nCryptoPunks have some high-profile owners, too, such as rapper Jay-Z, YouTube personality Logan Paul and tennis champion Serena Williams.\n\nOn top of that, there are clear differentiators that make certain CryptoPunks more desirable and valuable to collectors. Alien avatars are the rarest of the randomized images, and as such, alien CryptoPunks are among the most expensive NFTs sold to date. Ape and zombie designs are also in demand.\n\nMost of the CryptoPunks just look like humans with varying features and accessories, however, and the plainer-looking ones are close to the market floor in terms of asking price on NFT marketplaces.\n\nThe future\n\nWhat\u2019s next for CryptoPunks? Well, they will likely continue to change hands on secondary markets, potentially generating huge returns for investors who bought in before the surge.\n\nThere\u2019s no way to tell whether the current level of demand will continue, but the entry-level price for Punks continues to rise. As of July 14, 2023, the average CryptoPunk NFT goes for about 53 ETH (about $2000)\n\nThis story was originally published on January 10, 2022 and was updated on July 14, 2023."

        "content": "Tron\u2019s active addresses surpassed that of Ethereum, Solana, and other blockchains.\n\nSolana and the Justin Sun-led project had a more comparable performance than Ethereum.\n\nAccording to Nansen, Tron [TRX] outpaced several blockchains, including Solana [SOL] and Ethereum [ETH], in terms of active addresses in June. The blockchain research firm, in its 12 July tweet, noted that Tron recorded a 42% increase.\n\nRead Tron\u2019s [TRX] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nActive addresses on Ethereum increased to 5.8 million while Solana decreased by a whopping 45%. All the while, other chains, including BNB Chain and the Polygon [MATIC] network, fell slightly.\n\nJune active addresses by chain: TRON: 17.1M (+42%)\n\nBNB: 11.9M (-4%)\n\nEthereum: 5.8M (+23%)\n\nSolana: 5.2M (-45%)\n\nPolygon: 4.6M (-3.5%)\n\nArbitrum: 2.4M (-14%)\n\nOptimism: 1.2M (+17%)\n\nAvalanche: 1.1M (+21%)\n\nFantom: 623K (-26%)\n\nCelo: 320K (+53%)\n\nRonin: 102K (-13%) pic.twitter.com/eavqALuY2H \u2014 Nansen ? (@nansen_ai) July 12, 2023\n\nTypically, active addresses serve as a good indicator of daily users over a particular blockchain. Sometimes, an increase in the metric could be a bullish signal, as Tron displayed a relatively good performance in the month.\n\nBut did Tron outclass these other blockchains in every aspect?\n\nSolana matches Tron\u2019s developments as ETH takes\u2026\n\nWell, in terms of development activity, Tron began rising on 29 June. And as of 1 July, the development activity was as high as 5.1. The development activity shows the level of dedicated code commits of public GitHub repositories attached to a blockchain.\n\nSo, when it increases, it implies that there is a substantial commitment to polishing the network involved. During the first week of June, Solana\u2019s development activity soared above Tron\u2019s.\n\nHowever, in the last week of the month, the metric attached to both blockchains had a similar trend.\n\nOn Ethereum\u2019s part, development activity soared and dumped at different intervals. However, the metric did not match up to the highest level that Solana and Tron reached at any point all through the previous month.\n\nConcerning social dominance, Tron could not reach the peak it hit in May. And according to on-chain analytics platform Santiment, social dominance had fallen to 0.244% at press time.\n\nSolana had a similar trend within the same period. But like Tron, social dominance fell at the time of writing. Ethereum dominated Solana and Tron in this aspect, taking .60% of the total share.\n\nThe above analysis revealed that Ethereum got more hype than both Tron and Solana. Also, this metric showed that discussion related to the second-largest blockchain was much more when compared with the other two.\n\nNo victor, no vanquished here\n\nAnother area where Tron excelled is with NFTs. Although the total trade volume had subsided at press time, the blockchain volume hit as high as 18.21 million on 28 June.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s SOL\u2019s market cap in TRX terms\n\nThe hike suggests that collections created via the Tron network attracted a good level of traders\u2019 interest. Similarly, Solana also hit highs in NFT trades count on 14 and 27 June.\n\nFor Ethereum, the NFT volume wasn\u2019t as impressive as it was in June. And at the time of writing, the number of unique addresses which bought NFTs worth $100,000 or more decreased."

Additionally, the upbeat US inflation data stirred the optimism for the global digital assets, which pushed the token to the massive gains.\n\nBitcoin was back in green, posting some big gains. The largest crypto token jumped as much as 4 per cent to hover around $31,500-mark. Its largest peer, Ethereum, outperformed and rose about 8 per cent to top $2,000-levels. However, other altcoins posted robust gains in the last 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin surged to a one-year high above the $31,700 level following a favorable federal court decision for Ripple. BTC has since consolidated and is now trading at the $30,400 level. The month-to-date performance shows a 3 per cent gain, while the year-to-date increase stands at an impressive 89 per cent, said Edul Patel, co-founder and CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\"Soon after this news, XRP reached its highest point in a year within the last 24 hours outperforming the BTC by surging by over 61 per cent. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has also reached a new high by surpassing the $2,000 mark. The current market sentiment appears to be bullish,\" he added.\n\nMajority of the top crypto tokens were trading with masculine gains on Friday with a number of tokens posting double digit gains. XRP rallied 64 per cent, while Solana surged 31 per cent. Cardano gained more than 25 per cent and Polygon advanced 18 per cent. Avalanche and Polkadot added 13 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading sharply higher, surging to $1.26 trillion-mark, as it jumped almost 7 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes zoomed about 121 per cent to $67.66 billion.\n\nThe crypto market has registered massive gains in the last 24 hours. The crypto fear and greed index has jumped 3 points to remain in the greed zone with a score of 60/100. These market gains have been triggered by a US court ruling which is partially in favour of Ripple, said said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures\n\n\"The court has stated that the trading of XRP amongst retail investors can't be dubbed as a 'securities' sale. The SEC continues to hold its stance against the ruling and will likely re-appeal, but overall this has set a strong precedent for the sector and has resulted in a massive rally in prices,\" he added.\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nRipple is currently experiencing a major rally following the victory from SEC v Ripple case, as the Judge ruled Ripple as not a security for retail investors. The asset almost doubled following the news, soaring to as much as $0.94 and is currently trading in the $0.75 range.\n\nFollowing this bullish breakout, after registering short candles for six consecutive days, a pullback can be expected in coming days. The upward shift has propelled the RSI index to the overbought territory and is currently sitting at 78.3.The notable divergence between the 20-day moving average and 100-day moving average suggests bullish momentum over the near term. If the price manages to successfully surpass the $0.85 mark, this could lead to further increase towards the resistance levels of$1.0.\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $0.50, $0.68\n\nResistance: $0.85, $1.0\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

In the US, ESG-related assets are expected to reach $10.5 trillion by 2026.\n\nAccording to PwC\u2019s report, 78% of surveyed investors said they \u201cwould pay higher fees for ESG funds.\u201d Meanwhile, 52% of investors \u201care willing to build ESG into performance-related fees.\u201d\n\nThe report highlighted that there are conflicts between asset managers\u2019 fiduciary obligations to maximize financial returns for clients and ESG concerns. However, three-quarters of investors now view ESG as a component of those obligations.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin: This Could Be Investors\u2019 \u2018Golden Chance\u2019 to Buy BTC\n\nGoing by the aforementioned data, it is possible that institutions take the ESG score into consideration before buying an asset. In that regard, Bitcoin (BTC) adoption could see a slump among financial giants, while Ethereum (ETH) might not face such issues."

        "title": "Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: BTC bears return with the weekend - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price is likely to record big price changes this weekend because of low trading volume characteristic of weekends. $ 29,872 is critical.\n\nEthereum price could reach $2,120 if whales postponed weekend gratification.\n\nRipple price suffers the brunt of an overbought market, RSI falling below 70 could spell doom for XRP holders.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price remains tightly wound in a range extending from $29,000 to $31,000. Despite the recent uptick in bullishness due to the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit, the pioneer crypto remains the same. Ripple (XRP) bulls seem to be taking a break as the initial hype dissipates, causing altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH), to shed gains.\n\nAlso Read: XRP naysayers miss out on 70% gains after Ripple Labs and SEC share joint victory\n\nBitcoin price faces the weekend\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is entering the weekend at around $31,200 market value. It continues to move horizontally within a range, making the next two days critical in determining the next direction.\n\nWhy?\n\nNormally, BTC performance on weekends is characterized by big price changes and lower volume. Therefore, there are more huge individual orders than small ones, as whales take over during weekends. While retail holders take a break from the market, whales amass or offload in big numbers as they cash in weekend price swings.\n\nAs such, if whales amass into the weekend, the ensuing buying pressure could see Bitcoin price shatter above the $31,500 level and potentially foray toward $35,260.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nConversely, if whales dump, Bitcoin price could break below the critical level at $29,872, opening the drains for a possible dropdown toward the $26,171 range. As BTC eyes a highly volatile two days, bulls must defend the $29,872 level at all costs.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is tipping south, already indicating falling momentum. Lower volume is expected, therefore, as is characteristic of weekends because traditional BTC markets have closed, exposing the market to volatility.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: Can XRP's win take BTC to $40,000?\n\nEthereum price eyes $2,120 if whales let it\n\nEthereum (ETH) price continues to hold above an ascending trendline after breaching a crucial barrier at $1,959 during the Thursday rally that saw ETH ascend 10%. An increase in buying pressure could elevate the PoS token above the $2,000 zone to tag the mid-April highs around $2,120. Such a move would denote an 8% climb from the current level.\n\nThis is plausible, considering momentum indicators favor the upside. The price strength of the RSI above 50 and the positive histograms of the Awesome Oscillators indicate that bulls are leading. While this adds credence to the bullish thesis, a lot depends on how traders play their hand this weekend.\n\nETH/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nOn the flipside, a strong rejection from the psychological $2,012 level could extend the current pullback, causing Ethereum price to flip the newly found support at $1,959 back into resistance. The ensuing seller momentum could see ETH waste all the gains made on Thursday to recollect the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $1,863.\n\nThis would equally denote an 8% downswing from current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Arbitrum unlocks Layer 3 chains as Ethereum Layer 2 wars intensify\n\nRipple price suffers the brunt of an overbought market\n\nRipple (XRP) price is down 5% over the last 24 hours, cutting down on yesterday's gains. Nevertheless, the remittance token has remained at the highest level since April 2022. As profit-taking continues, XRP could soon confirm Welles Wilder's interpretation of an overbought market when the RSI momentum indicator crosses below 70, signaling holders should sell.\n\nThe subsequent selling pressure could see Ripple price drop below the $0.544 support level. A decisive flip of this support back to resistance would invalidate the current bullish outlook.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nOn the other hand, if sidelined investors are looking for an entry point after missing the 70% rally, buying XRP now, could see an influx of upside buying pressure which could revitalize the bulls and hopefully inspire a neck up, hopefully targeting the much-anticipated $1.000.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple price races to $1.0, records the largest crypto asset hourly volume as chatter to list XRP intensify"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nOndo Finance, an Ethereum-based asset manager, is broadening its market with the help of Polygon Labs in a bid to drive greater adoption of tokenized financial products within DeFi.\n\nBy expanding to Polygon, Ondo is looking to make its first move beyond the Ethereum mainnet since it became the first company to tokenize U.S. Treasuries in February. When the Ethereum base layer reaches capacity, it drives up the cost of transactions, and Ondo says this latest move will bring those costs down.\n\nJustin Schmidt, president and chief operating officer of Ondo Finance, said that the arrangement with Polygon would facilitate more access on-chain to institutional assets. In an interview with Decrypt, Schmidt added that the change comes at a ripe moment when more returns are possible in the DeFi ecosystem than sticking with other assets like stablecoins.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"I think what's happened over the past three years is just the macro environment has shifted in the world, and you actually can earn a pretty material interest rate now on something like Treasuries,\" Schmidt told Decrypt.\n\nFor more than a year, the Federal Reserve and other central banks have been lifting interest rates to tamp down on inflation. This has also raised the yields for Treasuries, with yields on short-term bonds like the 2-year note rising from just 1.9% yield when the rate hikes started in March of last year to almost 5% today.\n\nA tokenized asset is a blockchain-based signature of ownership with the underlying properties like yield remaining the same as the real-world equivalent. In contrast, a stablecoin is an entirely digital token that draws its value from its peg to a fiat currency or commodity to keep its volatility in check.\n\nToday, Ondo has the largest market share of tokenized assets on Ethereum, with nearly $158 million in market capitalization, according to Dune Analytics. In the wider market for tokenized assets, there are other big players like Franklin Templeton, which has just over $294 million in market cap on the Stellar network, according to the RWA.xyz analytics dashboard.\n\nOndo\u2019s move to expand its tokenized financial offerings comes at a time when TradFi behemoths are eying entryways into cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn June 15, BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, filed to register a Bitcoin spot market exchange traded fund. It was followed by other applications, including from big names like Fidelity, Valkyrie, and Invesco among others. Larry Fink, BlackRock\u2019s CEO, recently went so far as to liken Bitcoin to \u201cdigitalizing gold,\u201d a sharp reversal from his previously critical views.\n\nOndo, which invests in BlackRock-managed Treasury ETFs, appears to be going in the opposite direction of this crowd. With a Bitcoin ETF, the companies are taking a new technology like Bitcoin and putting it into a more traditional wrapper familiar that's to the industry. In Ondo\u2019s case, the process is inverted, taking a traditional asset and putting it into the newer tokenized form.\n\nTradFi moving into crypto at the same time as they increasingly adopt its underlying technology for tokenization may be part of an emerging trend in finance. Colin Butler, Polygon Labs' global head of institutional capital, expressed his view that there is a \"tidal wave\" of institutions adopting tokenization, and the proof of that will be seen in the near future.\n\n\"In the next three to six months, I think it's gonna be very, very telling, because a lot of these firms are going to come out and say they've been working on this,\" said Butler.\n\nEditor's Note: This story was updated to clarify that Ondo has the largest tokenized asset fund on Ethereum."

        "title": "Sector Report: Layer-2s - Bitcoin Market Journal",
        "content": "Executive Summary: Layer-2 blockchains were developed to help overcome the weaknesses in scalability seen in Layer-1 blockchains such as Ethereum. Their success has played a vital role in the growth of DeFi, NFTs, and other Web3 solutions on Ethereum. But after the successful completion of its ongoing PoS upgrade, the Ethereum Layer-1 blockchain is expected to become faster and more scalable than ever. What role, if any, will Layer-2 protocols have in the future of Ethereum 2.0? Are they still worth your investment? Find answers to these questions and more as we take a deep dive into the top Layer-2 blockchains.\n\nIndustry Overview\n\nBlockchain developers have to balance three major needs when designing a protocol \u2013 security, decentralization, and scalability. In traditional layer-1 protocols like Ethereum and bitcoin, improved security and decentralization often comes at the cost of scalability. This is commonly referred to as the \u201cBlockchain Trilemma.\u201d\n\nEthereum was the first major blockchain to provide smart contract capabilities. This first-mover advantage allowed it to attract developers and users at a rate that other newer Layer-1 blockchains find almost impossible to emulate.\n\nBut as the number of transactions on the blockchain increased dramatically, the network started experiencing crippling delays. And since the protocol has a bidding system for available block space, this led to astronomically high transaction costs (gas fees).\n\nIn some instances, the gas fees shot up to 500m gwei or around $1600 in current prices. And in those times of peak congestion, a single transaction could take more than 24 hours. For reference, a normal transaction during low traffic only takes a few seconds or minutes.\n\nThe main reason for this congestion is the extremely low rate of transactions per second (TPS) the original Ethereum blockchain could handle \u2013 between 12 to 15 transactions. The number for bitcoin is even lower \u2013 just 5 TPS.\n\nThese older Layer-1 blockchains use a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. The system, while excellent at providing security, is severely lacking when it comes to efficiency and scalability.\n\nAs network congestion became a major headache on Ethereum post-2020, Layer-2 blockchains were created to improve transaction speeds and reduce gas fees.\n\nA Layer-2 blockchain is a separate network that is built on top of an existing Layer-1 blockchain. Its main purpose is to remove or reduce the common transaction bottlenecks that prevent a blockchain from growing to accommodate more users and decentralized apps.\n\nDuring heavy network activity, Layer-2 networks take the bulk of transactions away from the mainnet. After processing the transactions, the data is posted back onto the Layer-1 through a connecting bridge.\n\nDifferent Approaches to Layer-2 Blockchains\n\nOver the years, developers have created multiple approaches to implementing Layer-2 solutions. The most adopted Layer-2 solutions in the industry in terms of market cap and TVL use one of the following 3 approaches\n\nPlasma\n\nA Layer-2 protocol using the plasma framework creates multiple \u201cchild chains\u201d connected to the Ethereum mainnet. While it boasts of a high TPS capability, plasma chains are not easy to design. They are more useful in specific use cases like decentralized exchanges, gaming, or token transfers. Polygon is a leading Layer-2 blockchain that deploys plasma chains.\n\nOptimistic Rollups\n\nA rollup is a Layer-2 solution designed to execute hundreds of Layer-1 transactions outside the mainnet. The solution then \u201crolls up\u201d these transactions and compresses them into a single piece of data before posting them back on the mainnet.\n\nOptimistic rollups are a subcategory of rollups that operate under the assumption that all transaction data committed to the mainnet is correct by default. But users can still challenge it on-chain and trigger a dispute resolution process.\n\nBy quickly processing transactions in good faith off-chain, optimistic rollups dramatically increase transaction speeds. But there is a slight delay in confirmation of transactions on the Ethereum mainnet, due to the provision for dispute resolution.\n\nOptimistic rollups are best suited for situations that involve many low-cost transactions. Perhaps not surprisingly, two of the most popular Layer-2 protocols by network activity \u2013 Arbitrum and Optimism, use Optimistic rollups.\n\nZero-Knowledge Rollups (zk-rollups)\n\nInstead of relying on an on-chain dispute resolution model, zk-rollups use cryptography to validate and authenticate transactions. Apart from that, everything else is broadly identical to how optimistic rollups work.\n\nZk-rollups are generally considered to be more efficient in situations that involve complex computations or enhanced security considerations. But they lack the full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility that you get from optimistic rollups. This hinders interoperability, which is becoming increasingly important in the blockchain ecosystem. Additionally, zero-knowledge rollups and proof systems are complicated to build and deploy, which has limited their usage in real-world cases.\n\nLayer-2 Industry Growth\n\nLayer-2 blockchains played a major role in the rapid evolution and explosion of the DeFi ecosystem between 2020 and 2022. As Ethereum embarked on a multi-year transition into Proof of Stake (PoS), Layer-2 protocols enabled users to avoid high gas fees and network congestion.\n\nDue to its widespread adoption and features, Ethereum remains the industry leader in DeFi growth. According to DeFiLlama, the blockchain accounts for 58.58% of the total value locked into the ecosystem \u2013 valued at nearly $25 billion in Q2 2023.\n\nDuring its peak in Q4 2021, the total DeFi ecosystem was worth north of $174 billion, with close to $110 billion residing on the Ethereum network. This kind of growth would have been impossible without the support of Layer-2 blockchains.\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nLayer-2 blockchains primarily revolve around Ethereum, the largest and most popular Layer-1 blockchain that supports smart contracts and DeFi apps. That begs the question \u201cWhy not just invest in Ethereum?\u201d\n\nWhile Ethereum is big on security and decentralization, it has a critical weakness in its lack of scalability. Without the ability to scale with demand, the growth and further evolution of Etheruem seems impossible. This is why we\u2019ve seen the growth in the number of L2 solutions looking to tackle Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues.\n\nThis faith has been validated to some extent by the rapid growth we witnessed in the DeFi space after 2020. According to Nansen, the TVL in DeFi grew more than 6,900% between 2020 and 2022. Even after a 76% market correction in 2022, the space still retains billions of dollars in locked capital.\n\nOutside of the cryptocurrency space, blockchain technology has applications in traditional finance and banking. And here, just as much as in crypto, scalability is crucial. Even if the wider crypto-markets fail in the long term, Layer-2 blockchains will still have a major role to play in the future of traditional finance, making them attractive targets for investors looking to capitalize on this growing need.\n\nWhile there are many compelling reasons to invest in Layer-2 projects, significant risks also exist. Chief among them is the possibility that Ethereum fails to succeed long-term. Because the L2s depend on Ethereum that would be a blow to the sector that it might not be able to accept.\n\nUltimately, if you are going to invest in one of these Layer-2 projects, it is important to choose the best. That\u2019s the one with the most growth, the most user traction, and the one most likely to succeed. Because if L2s remain necessary it is likely that eventually it will be a winner-takes-all scenario.\n\nWho\u2019s Investing: Institutional Backing\n\nAll the major layer-2 blockchain projects have received hundreds of millions of dollars in funding from well-known investors in the crypto space.\n\nPolygon\u2019s backers include Sequoia Capital, SoftBank, Galaxy Digital, Tiger Global Management, Alan Howard, Kevin O\u2019Leary, and Makers Fund, to name a few. Together, these entities have poured over $450 million into the project across 8 funding rounds.\n\nArbitrum counts Mark Cuban, Polychain Capital, Ribbit Capital, Redpoint, Pantera Capital, Coinbase Ventures, and Compound VC among its main investors. Total capital inflows into the project exceed $143 million.\n\nIn its Series A funding round, Optimism raised around $25 million from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Paradigm, and IDEO Colab Ventures. Paradigm and a16z doubled down on their investments in the Series B round, pooling another $150 million into Optimism in 2022.\n\nImmutable raised around $75 million through its Series A and B funding rounds. Major investors included Apex Capital, AirTree Ventures, Alameda Research, and Galaxy Interactive. In another massive funding round in 2022, the firm received $200 million from Temasek, Tencent, ParaFi Capital, and nine other investors.\n\nTop Layer-2 Projects\n\nProject Market Cap Protocols Revenue (Annualized) TVL Avg Daily Active Users Polygon $5.73b 427 $25m $890.31m 389.17k Arbitrum $1.27b 361 $13.24m $2.06b 185.48k Optimism $741m 144 $16.09m $779.44m 77.17k Immutable X $660m NA NA NA NA\n\nPolygon (MATIC)\n\nMarket Cap: $5.73b\n\nNumber of Protocols: 427\n\nToken Price: $0.62\n\nTwitter Followers: 101.45k\n\nPolygon is a Layer-2 ecosystem for Ethereum that was launched in Mumbai, India as the Matic Network in 2017. Originally, the project was a plasma sidechain network. By 2021, it had expanded to include zk-rollups and optimistic rollups and was rebranded as Polygon.\n\nPolygon in its present state includes an eponymous software development kit \u2013 the Polygon SDK. Developers can use it to build any kind of Ethereum-compatible sidechain and decentralized applications.\n\nThe main Layer-2 blockchain at the core of the Polygon network is a PoS sidechain. The native token is called MATIC. The Polygon network has a TPS capacity of 65,000. And the gas fees are extremely low.\n\nDevelopers have access to all major sidechain architecture options on Polygon \u2013 plasma, zk, and optimistic. Although it lags behind other Layer-2 protocols in terms of TVL, Polygon leads the sector in market capitalization at $5.7b.\n\nA high market cap is a marker of wider recognition in the industry and greater support from investors. It shows that the project is in good financial health and has the resources to commit to further development and expansion.\n\nPolygon is way ahead of every other Layer-2 project in this aspect. The nearest contender, Arbitrum, is only one-fifth its size at $1.2b. With a wider focus on diversity, flexibility, and class-leading TPS of 65,000, it still has a long way to go.\n\nArbitrum (ARB)\n\nMarket Cap:$1.27b\n\nNumber of Protocols: 361\n\nToken Price: $1\n\nTwitter Followers: 805.5k\n\nArbitrum is a Layer-2 protocol for Ethereum launched in 2021 by a blockchain startup based in New York. The company, called Offchain Labs, was founded in 2018 and has major investors including Pantera Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, and the now-defunct Alameda Capital.\n\nUnlike Polygon, Arbitrum is only focused on optimistic rollups. Transactions and smart contracts are settled on the Arbitrum sidechain and then reported back to the Ethereum mainnet. The Layer-2 protocol boasts a TPS of 40,000 and absurdly low gas fees.\n\nArbitrum is also fully compatible with all EVM programming languages. The blockchain has gained some traction in the DeFi space in recent years. Major DeFi protocols like SushiSwap and Curve have Arbitrum integrations.\n\nIn 2023, the protocol also airdropped its highly anticipated native token called ARB. Arbitrum is generally considered a stable, mature, and reliable scaling solution for Ethereum. It also leads in terms of TVL among all Layer-2 rollups, with $2.06b or 67.12% of the market.\n\nA higher TVL indicates that more users are actively participating in contracts and transactions using the Layer-2 blockchain. Especially in the early stages of a blockchain, this is a sign of high growth potential.\n\nOptimism (OP)\n\nMarket Cap: $741m\n\nNumber of Protocols: 144\n\nToken Price: $1.16\n\nTwitter Followers: 516k\n\nOptimism is another Layer-2 blockchain solution for Ethereum with its base in New York. The project was first unveiled in 2019 before its eventual launch in late 2021. As its name indicates, Optimism uses optimistic rollups, much like its rival Arbitrum.\n\nThe Layer-2 blockchain is based entirely on Ethereum and offers full EVM compatibility. All Ethereum-based decentralized apps can run seamlessly on Optimism as well. It has a maximum TPS of 2,000 which is on the lower end of the spectrum for Layer-2 transaction speeds.\n\nThe native token on Optimism is called OP. It is based on the ERC-777 standard and functions as the governance token on the blockchain. It can also be bought and sold on all major crypto exchanges.\n\nAlthough it has been around for several years now, Optimism has failed to gain the same level of traction as its direct rivals like Arbitrum. But it still accounts for about 25% of the TVL in rollup chains. Whether it will be able to sustain its market share and grow is still an open question.\n\nImmutable X (IMX)\n\nMarket Cap: 660m\n\nNumber of Protocols: NA\n\nToken Price: $0.63\n\nTwitter Followers: 317.9k\n\nImmutable X is a Layer-2 blockchain project with a dedicated focus on NFTs. It was launched in Australia in 2018. It is one of the first Layer-2 solutions to focus exclusively on NFTs and Web3 gaming. The startup was heavily backed by Coinbase and Alameda Research.\n\nUnlike Optimism and Abritrum, Immutable X relies on the zk-rollup architecture for its Ethereum sidechains. The project uses a proprietary version of the zero-knowledge proof system called ZK-STARK for enhanced security.\n\nImmutable X offers a maximum TPS of 9000, along with near-zero gas fees. The project also claims that all its transactions are 100% carbon neutral. The protocol supports all Ethereum desktop NFT wallets.\n\nThe native token on the protocol is called IMX. It is an ERC-20 token that can be used for paying gas fees and for staking. IMX also pulls double duty as the governance token for the Immutable X DAO.\n\nWith a market cap of $670m, Immutable X is certainly quite well known in the Ethereum NFT circles. But with the crypto market downturn, NFTs and the Web3 gaming model of play-to-earn may be on their way out. Immutable X probably has the weakest prospects of all Layer-2 blockchains featured on this list due to its narrow focus.\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nLayer-2 blockchains provided the vital breathing space that Ethereum required during the bad old days of network congestion and high gas fees. After the complete transition to PoS, Ethereum 2.0 is expected to have transaction speeds of up to 100,000 TPS.\n\nHowever, according to the roadmap shared by Vitalik Buterin, that milestone is still several years away. And existing Layer-2 blockchains will continue to play a significant role in the future, even after upgrades bring features like sharding to the mainnet.\n\nAlong with bitcoin, Ethereum is one of the most reliable blockchain investments in terms of longevity and mainstream acceptance. And popular Layer-2 protocols like Arbitrum and Polygon still have a future in the Ethereum ecosystem."

        "content": "Comparing Passive Income Methods \u2013 UK Stocks v.s. Ethereum Staking And BEASTS Coin Referral Scheme\n\n\n\nPassive income is a desirable way to generate wealth without actively working for it. Investors are always on the lookout for reliable sources of passive income, and the UK stock market and cryptocurrency sector offer intriguing possibilities. We will delve into the details of these investment options to help you make an informed decision about where to allocate your funds for potential long-term gains.\n\nIn this article, we will explore various options for generating passive income in the UK, focusing on the UK stock market and cryptocurrency investments. Specifically, we will compare the potential of Greencoat UK Wind, a prominent renewable energy investment trust, with the opportunities presented by Ethereum (ETH) staking and the unique referral scheme offered by BEASTS Coin (BEASTS).\n\nWindy Profits With Greencoat UK Wind\n\nLooking for a way to generate some passive income in the UK stock market? Look no further than Greencoat UK Wind (LSE: UKW). This FTSE 250 investment trust operates 46 onshore and offshore wind farms across the UK, and it\u2019s expected to pay a dividend of 8.77p per share in 2023. That\u2019s a 13.4% year-on-year increase, and it gives the stock an attractive forward-looking dividend yield of 6.2%.\n\nGreencoat UK Wind is a FTSE 250 investment trust that operates 46 onshore and offshore wind farms across the UK. The company\u2019s revenue comes from both the sale of power produced and green subsidies.\n\nBut what\u2019s exciting about Greencoat UK Wind is its growth potential. The UK government is committed to increasing the domestic supply of clean energy, and wind power is a big part of that plan. As a result, Greencoat UK Wind is well-positioned to grow its portfolio and generate even more income for investors in the years to come.\n\nOverall, Greencoat UK Wind is a good investment for investors who are looking for a high yield and exposure to the renewable energy sector.\n\nEthereum \u2013 Earning Through Liquid Staking\n\nEthereum (ETH), a leading smart contract platform, has transformed the crypto industry by enabling developers to create dApps and launch their own tokens with ease. Its robust ecosystem, widespread adoption, and efficient execution of smart contracts make it stand out from other crypto projects.\n\nOn Ethereum, liquid staking is now a possibility.

Users can easily stake and unstake their ETH while earning high rewards by utilising sites like Lido.\n\nBEASTS Coin \u2013 A Unique Referral Scheme\n\nBEASTS Coin (BEASTS) is a newcomer in the cryptocurrency landscape that offers innovative ways to earn passive income. Its referral program is a unique approach that goes beyond traditional staking and funding techniques.\n\nThe program allows each user to generate a unique referral code, enabling them to earn 20% of the deposit made in ETH, BNB, or USDT when a new investor purchases BEASTS tokens using that code. Referees also benefit from an additional 20% of BEASTS tokens.\n\nThis unlimited earning potential tied to successful referrals sets it apart from traditional staking. The vibrant community fostered by Beasts creates a network effect that boosts earning potential. Exploring new altcoins and meme coins like BEASTS can offer exciting opportunities for those seeking passive income with a touch of adventure in the ever-evolving crypto market.\n\nIn conclusion, when it comes to generating passive income, there are promising opportunities in both the UK stock market and the cryptocurrency landscape. Greencoat UK Wind stands out as a reliable option, providing a substantial dividend yield and growth potential through its involvement in the renewable energy sector. The UK government\u2019s commitment to clean energy further enhances its long-term prospects.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum staking presents an innovative way to earn passive income within the thriving world of cryptocurrencies. With liquid staking on Ethereum, investors can stake their assets and still have the flexibility to trade or use them, all while earning attractive yields.\n\nIn the ever-evolving crypto market, BEASTS Coin offers a unique opportunity for investors seeking passive income. Its referral program, which rewards users for successful referrals with a percentage of deposits made and additional BEASTS tokens, provides an exciting way to earn income. The vibrant community surrounding BEASTS Coin adds to its potential, creating a network effect that could contribute to its growth!\n\nBEASTS Coin :\n\nWebsite: https://cagedbeasts.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CAGED_BEASTS\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/CAGEDBEASTS\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "US Commission looks into possible breaches of consumer protection laws by ChatGPT\u2019s inventor OpenAI\n\nGood morning tech fam, here are some quick tech updates for you to catch on to!\n\nWhat\u2019s New Today: US companies offer US$146,000 on average for AI talent\n\nFast-Track Insights: Crypto could soar by 2030 with Elon Musk\u2019s support, boosting Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nOpenAI, the company that created ChatGPT, has been the subject of an inquiry by the American competition watchdog because there are allegations that the firm violated the law by using public data to post inaccurate and defamatory material. The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has asked OpenAI in a 20-page letter for specific information about its technology and privacy protections, including any steps taken to prevent a recurrence of incidents in which its ground-breaking chatbot published false and disparaging information about members of the public.\n\nNew data from the international job search portal Adzuna shows that the U.S. is in the lead for artificial intelligence employment, many of which easily pay six figures. According to the Adzuna database, there were 7.6 million vacant positions in the U.S. in June, with an increasing number requiring AI expertise: 169,045 of these positions specifically mentioned AI requirements, and 3,575 of these specifically requested generative AI work. It should come as no surprise that tech positions like software engineer, product designer, deep learning architect, and data scientist are among the most prevalent.\n\nCrypto firm Circle said on Wednesday it has reduced staff and ended investments in non-core activities as the stablecoin issuer seeks to shore up its balance sheet. Crypto tokens related to Artificial intelligence (A.I.) rose more than 3% on Wednesday after Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk unveiled a new A.I. company called xAI as an alternative to the popular chatbot ChatGPT. With this crypto daily roundup, you can jumpstart your day with the latest updates on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more. Read More\n\nDespite the recent consolidation of gains by the market giants Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), several cryptocurrency enthusiasts, including Elon Musk, have expressed optimism about the future of the sector. Tesla and Twitter CEO were responding to a post from growing Daniel, a Twitter user, who predicted that all existing currencies would be digitalized by the end of the decade using computer processors or graphics processing units (GPUs).

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s decentralization is said to be at risk for its over-dependence on computing servers like Amazon.\n\nThose who stake Ethereum could be largely affected in incidents of outages as they may lose millions.\n\nLatest reports have disclosed that the decentralized nature of Ethereum (ETH) which is its main selling point could be under threat for its over-reliance on computing servers including Amazon. According to the report, companies like ConsenSys that provide important Ethereum infrastructure largely depend on virtual servers from cloud computing providers. Interestingly, Ethereum also has a large portion of its execution node hosted virtually on cloud servers.\n\nSajida Zouarhi, a product manager at Blocknative, an Ethereum data analytics firm has a strong concern about this.\n\nWhat good is it to have a diversity of people running nodes and a geographically distributed network if, in the end, it\u2019s all running with the same cloud provider?\n\nThe issue is that when too much Ethereum infrastructure is hosted through one provider or one data center, problems including technical issues or power outages can affect a large portion of the network as well as the technology built on top of it offline.\n\nStrategicHash, a pseudonymous blockchain researcher, believes that ETH could do better. It has been observed that these cloud service providers could have the control to hamstring these blockchain networks that are largely dependent on them.\n\nSpeaking on this, StrategicHash referred to the data showing that 2,439 of Ethereum\u2019s 6,810 nodes are hosted via AWS. This is around 35 percent. According to him, it is only ideal for one service provider to hold a maximum of 25 percent. Out of the 2,439 Ethereum nodes hosted via AWS, 1395 of them are found in a single data center in Ashburn, Virginia.\n\nHow Outages Can Affect Ethereum\n\nOn the part of Ethereum, the AWS outage may have a limited impact on its network as other nodes hosted elsewhere would facilitate transactions. Regardless, these outages can still cause a lot of harm according to StrategicHash.\n\nThose who stake ETH through nodes hosted on AWS would be affected by inactivity which could cost them millions of dollars. Outages would also reduce the number of nodes on Ethereum. This would make the network centralized and vulnerable to attack.\n\nPascal Caversaccio, a blockchain security researcher, commented on this.\n\nAn AWS incident can have a vast impact on user-facing applications such as hosted frontends or crypto wallets. I\u2019m not that much afraid of any consensus failures due to cloud hosting but rather of its impact on the user. An AWS incident can have a vast impact on user-facing applications such as hosted frontends or crypto wallets.\n\nHe observed that MetaMask relies on software hosted on AWS to make transactions to Ethereum. Considering that it has over 21 million monthly users, any outage can massively affect its operation. It has also been observed that some DeFi protocols rely on AWS. It can be recalled that the AWS outage in December 2021 made the decentralized exchange dYdX halt transaction processing.\n\nThe situation of Ethereum is not perfect, but better than in 2020 when over 70 percent of its execution nodes were hosted virtually. This has decreased to 60 percent.\n\nStrategicHash believes that there is a solution.\n\nA possible solution is to encourage hosting on bare metal rather than cloud providers. Bare Metal is cheaper, faster, and is unlikely to go down all at once.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "content": "DISCLAIMER: This article is a SPONSORED Press Release and does not constitute Finbold's editorial content nor undergo monitoring. Crypto assets/products involve significant risks. Do not invest unless you are prepared to lose your entire investment. For a full disclaimer, please click here.\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrency, price predictions hold huge weight for investors and enthusiasts alike.\n\nAs we look ahead to the next five years, this article dives into five surprising price predictions for major cryptos, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP.\n\nThese predictions, generated by ChatGPT\u2019s advanced algorithms, offer a unique perspective on the market that could prove both enlightening and thought-provoking.\n\n1. Bitcoin ($BTC)\n\nAs the first (and most well-known) cryptocurrency, Bitcoin continues to dominate the digital currency market.\n\nIntroduced in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, the Bitcoin network operates in a decentralized manner, which ensures transparency, security, and the immutability of transactions.\n\nWith a limited supply of 21 million $BTC, the coin\u2019s value is driven by various factors, such as market demand, adoption, and regulatory developments.\n\nThe coin has gained significant attention in recent years, with CoinMarketCap highlighting its all-time high of $68,789.63 on November 10, 2021.\n\nDespite the coin\u2019s value decline since then, ChatGPT maintains that $BTC has the potential to recover and achieve new highs in the coming years.\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, Bitcoin\u2019s value could hit $100,000 in the next five years, representing a 228% increase from today\u2019s price.\n\nThis price estimation will be music to the ears of Bitcoin bulls, who have seen the coin struggle to cleanly break the $30,000 resistance level in recent weeks.\n\n2. Ethereum ($ETH)\n\nAnother cryptocurrency that ChatGPT is bullish on in the years ahead is Ethereum.\n\nRenowned for its smart contract capabilities and scalable network, Ethereum has become the go-to blockchain for decentralized application (dApp) developers globally.\n\nDue to this, Ethereum has become the main source of decentralized finance (DeFi) innovation \u2013 prompting other blockchains to follow suit.\n\nThe Ethereum network was even at the heart of the NFT craze, hosting well-known projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and CryptoPunks.\n\nUnfortunately for $ETH bulls, the token\u2019s November 2021 high is now a distant memory \u2013 yet ChatGPT believes the token could post new highs in the next five years.\n\nPer the model\u2019s analysis, Ethereum could hit $10,000 by July 2028, a whopping 429% increase from today\u2019s price.\n\nChatGPT notes that several factors, including the sustained growth of the DeFi sector, could be the key catalysts for this price surge.\n\n3. Wall Street Memes ($WSM)\n\nLastly, Wall Street Memes ($WSM) is a brand-new meme coin inspired by the GameStop saga of 2021, when traders on r/WallStreetBets rallied against the short sellers on Wall Street.\n\nThe recently-launched $WSM token aims to capture the spirit of this movement, empowering investors to challenge the status quo in the crypto market.\n\nWall Street Memes is currently in its presale phase, which means that $WSM isn\u2019t yet available on the open market.\n\nHowever, this hasn\u2019t stopped eager investors from clamoring to buy tokens \u2013 leading to an incredible $14.4 million in funding being raised for the project thus far.\n\nA robust community has also formed around the project, with thousands of traders now participating in the official Telegram community.\n\nAll of these factors play into ChatGPT\u2019s bullish forecast for $WSM, which expects the token to hit $1 by 2028.\n\nConsidering Wall Street Memes\u2019 current presale price is just $0.0316, this would be an enormous return of 3,064% for those who invest today \u2013 and even higher for those who invested during the earlier presale stages.\n\n4. XRP ($XRP)\n\nXRP remains one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world, thanks to its \u201cOG status\u201d in the digital currency market.\n\nThis open-source project is designed to facilitate fast, cheap, and secure cross-border payments \u2013 which is still unattainable for most people.\n\nAlthough XRP was one of the first cryptocurrencies to hit the mainstream consciousness, it has displayed remarkable staying power, with CoinGecko reporting that it\u2019s still the world\u2019s sixth-largest token by market cap.\n\nHowever, this hasn\u2019t stopped XRP from becoming embroiled in a legal dispute with the SEC \u2013 a situation that has halted the token\u2019s price momentum in the past two years.\n\nFortunately, ChatGPT believes that XRP\u2019s legal troubles could soon be over, paving the way for sustained price growth.\n\nAccording to the AI model, the XRP price could rocket to $5 by 2028, representing a new all-time high.\n\nChatGPT notes that a future rise in global remittances and the need for real-time transactions could drive demand for XRP in the years ahead.\n\n5. Binance Coin ($BNB)\n\nBinance Coin, as the name suggests, is the native token of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange by trading volume \u2013 Binance.\n\n$BNB was initially launched in 2017 as an ERC-20 token but has now migrated to the Binance Chain.\n\nThe coin has a variety of use cases within the context of the Binance ecosystem, such as being used to pay for trading/network fees.\n\nHowever, many investors opt to buy and hold $BNB to gain financial exposure to Binance\u2019s growth \u2013 a strategy that has proved fruitful in recent years.\n\nAt the time of writing, the $BNB price continues to be extremely volatile, given the recent lawsuit from the SEC against the Binance exchange.\n\nThe good news is that ChatGPT still predicts enormous growth for $BNB in the years ahead \u2013 forecasting that the coin\u2019s price could hit $1,000 by July 2028.\n\nAlthough this estimation may seem outlandish, it\u2019s worth remembering that the trajectory of exchange-based cryptos can often switch in the blink of an eye, meaning this coin is one to watch going forward."

        "content": "A popular cryptocurrency analyst has recently revealed he has optimistic predictions for the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization Ethereum ($ETH), pointing to a potential upside of nearly 60%.\n\nIn a series of tweets shared with their nearly 200,000 followers on the microblogging platform analyst Altcoin Sherpa outlined a potential 59% rise for the second-largest cryptocurrency, which would see it get to the $3,000 mark, ahead of an expected pullback.\n\nUtilizing his extensive chart-based analysis, he forecasted that Ethereum might climb above $2,000 in the latter half of 2023\u2019s Q3, peaking above $2,700 in Q4, before retracting to around $1,250.\n\n$ETH: Wouldn't be surprised to see this go as high as near $3000 before a pullback. Still to be determined how far the pullback would go; it's going to depend on the macro economy IMO. Still bullish for now though. #Ethereum pic.twitter.com/fuK96ZG7kV \u2014 Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) July 11, 2023\n\nAltcoin Sherpa also shared his viewpoint on Solana ($SOL), currently the 10th-largest crypto asset by market cap. In his opinion, Solana may face about a 22% dip after hitting a critical resistance level.\n\nHe further suggested that the unfolding bankruptcy proceedings of the now-collapsed crypto exchange FTX, which was a major SOL supporter, could potentially lead to an increased supply of Solana in the market, as FTX\u2019s crypto trading division, Alameda Research, is a significant holder of Solana.\n\nThe analyst anticipated a slight decrease to the $17 mark, but noted he doesn\u2019t know what may happen next for the cryptocurrency although he is still bullish on it in the long run.\n\nAs CryptoGlobe reported, institutional investors are seemingly increasingly turning to cryptocurrencies, as crypto investment products have recently seen a significant influx of funds, with products focusing on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP leading the pack.\n\nEthereum\u2019s net flows year-to-date remain negative, with investors moving $63 million out of these products so far this year. Similarly, products focusing on multiple digital assets have seen $200,000 of inflows last week, but $35 million of outflows throughout this year.\n\nOther notable altcoins, including Solana ($SOL), $XRP, Polygon ($MATIC), Litecoin ($LTC), and Aave ($AAVE), have also seen inflows, albeit to varying degrees. In contrast, Cosmos ($ATOM) and Cardano ($ADA) experienced minor outflows.\n\nNot to be left behind, Blockchain equities \u2013 stocks of companies engaged in the development of blockchain technologies \u2013 have witnessed their largest inflows for the year, totaling $15 million.\n\nFeatured image via Unsplash."

        "title": "Stader Labs launches high-yield Ethereum staking | - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Boldly etching its name in the dynamic sphere of blockchain technology, Stader Labs has launched a high-yield Ethereum staking product.\n\nWidening the horizons of staking potential, this innovative offering proposes a lucrative appeal, dwarfing other protocols by boasting the highest yield on Ethereum (ETH) staking. It signifies an evolution in how the digital economy can be accessed and optimized.\n\nLowering the stakes for greater inclusivity\n\nNormally, native Ethereum staking would mandate a hefty lock-up of 32 ETH minimum. However, with the recent foray of Stader Labs into the Ethereum network, this prerequisite takes a nosedive.\n\nThe firm\u2019s new proposition enables network node operators to maintain network operations with a modest 4 ETH, slashing the capital commitment by an impressive 85%.\n\nThe mechanics are straightforward. A node operator pledges a 4 ether bond, in response to which, Stader Labs issues an ETHx token. This token essentially mirrors the full stake.\n\nThe 28 ether gap, therefore, is fulfilled by liquid stakers. This model\u2019s inherent flexibility effectively democratizes participation, enticing a broader demographic of users to the Ethereum staking ecosystem.\n\nStader Labs doesn\u2019t stop at inclusivity; it follows through with profitability. In a bid to sweeten the deal for its users, the company offers a 50% reward boost.\n\nConsequently, the reward rate surges to an impressive figure of over 6%. Node operators, taking advantage of Stader\u2019s service and deploying 8x leverage, can anticipate yields soaring by up to 35% on their staked ETH.\n\nFor comparison, acclaimed staking services like Lido and RocketPool currently hold a combined ether value of $15.5 billion, offering yields between 3% to 4%. Therefore, the strikingly high yields by Stader Labs unquestionably sets it apart from the competition.\n\nDecentralization: The core ethos\n\nWhile higher yields and lower capital requirements undeniably mark a winning formula, another equally significant aspect of Stader Labs\u2019 operations is its commitment to decentralization.\n\nStaking plays an essential role in blockchain network maintenance, akin to the operations of a traditional savings bank. It\u2019s a passive investment strategy that attracts substantial user involvement.\n\nThe issue lies with the prevalent centralization in the existing staking protocols. Stader Labs, however, is stepping up to this challenge.\n\nCurrently, the top three entities stake more than half of the total ETH, with a single predominant liquid staking protocol holding about a 90% market share. This presents a concern for potential power imbalances and monopolistic tendencies.\n\nAs a proactive measure against such centralization, Stader Labs has imposed a self-restriction of a 22% share of all staked ETH. This move ensures a fair distribution of power among Ethereum staking solutions and guards against possible centralization.\n\nIn the words of Amitej Gajjala, CEO at Stader Labs, the intent is to help maintain the pledge of keeping Ethereum decentralized and diversify the Ethereum staking landscape.\n\nBottomline the recent move by Stader Labs to launch a high-yield Ethereum staking product isn\u2019t just about profitability. It\u2019s a statement echoing the essence of blockchain technology \u2013 decentralization and democratization.\n\nIt\u2019s a promise to Ethereum users of a fair, balanced, and rewarding ecosystem. With such a strategy, the future certainly looks bright for both Stader Labs and the Ethereum network."

        "title": "Donald Trump's NFT company reveals shockingly low bank balance, but massive Ethereum fortune: Details - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Former President Donald Trump has disclosed new details about CIC Digital LLC, a company that receives licensing fees for using his likeness on non-fungible tokens (NFTs). According to a revised financial filing submitted by Trump on July 13, CIC Digital LLC holds an Ethereum wallet with an estimated value ranging from $250,000 to $500,000, while its US bank account balance is reported to be less than $1,000.\n\nThe disclosure comes as NFT sales of Trump-branded digital assets have experienced a notable increase. Data from OpenSea reveals a surge of 17% in the sale volume of the Trump NFT Trading Cards, with a modest 2% rise in the floor price, which now trades at 4.18 ETH.\n\nIn 2022, the former president earned a six-figure income from NFT sales. His financial disclosure form, released by the watchdog group CREW in April, revealed earnings ranging from $100,001 to $1 million from NFT transactions.\n\nTrump made headlines in December 2022 with the launch of his NFT collection, featuring digital \u201ctrading cards\u201d showcasing cartoon illustrations of himself in heroic poses and outfits. The collection, priced at $99 per card, sold out completely within a day, demonstrating the strong demand among his supporters.\n\nTrump\u2019s NFT sales and financial gains\n\nThe revised financial filing provides specifics on nearly one hundred income sources, totaling over $1.2 billion. These sources include foreign business activities, speaking fees, and earnings from a golf course in Florida. The former First Lady Melania Trump reported earning $1.2 million from her speaking engagements.\n\nTrump\u2019s financial disclosures shed light on his post-presidential finances as he prepares for a potential presidential primary. Democrats have criticized him for failing to separate his business interests from his presidency, while his Republican opponents have largely refrained from questioning the sources of his earnings.\n\nThe disclosure also reveals additional revenue streams for Trump, including royalties and payments for speaking engagements. Notably, his social media company, Trump Media and Technology Group, is valued at $5 million to $25 million, with revenue coming from advertising on the conservative live-streaming site Rumble and the ad platform RevContent. Trump has assigned $2.1 million of his speaking fees as income to the media company.\n\nThe financial filing also discloses Melania Trump\u2019s speaking income, including a $250,000 speech to the Log Cabin Republicans and another $250,000 from Fix California, an election integrity group led by Ric Grenell, Trump\u2019s former acting director of national intelligence.\n\nMoreover, the filing reveals that Trump paid off an additional loan from Deutsche Bank AG, which was not included in his original filing. He retired a mortgage between $25 million and $50 million on his Trump National Doral resort.\n\nAs Trump continues to navigate his post-presidential ventures, the disclosure of his financial details provides a glimpse into his business activities and their intersection with his political career. The NFT market, in particular, has proven to be a lucrative avenue for the former president, with his digital assets attracting significant attention and sales."
