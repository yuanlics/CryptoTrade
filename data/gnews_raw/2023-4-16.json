        "title": "Securely generate Ethereum validator keys at low cost using a serverless architecture on AWS | Amazon Web Services - AWS Blog",
        "content": "The new proof-of-stake consensus mechanism on Ethereum blockchain network allows network participants to earn rewards without spending a lot of computational power for playing a part in securing the network. Unlike miners, validators don\u2019t need to spend many CPU cycles to produce new blocks. They stake 32 ETH (the native cryptocurrency on Ethereum) to be allowed to attest user transactions and that way generate income through rewards. They also may lose a portion of their funds (slashed) for incorrect behavior, or for their node being unavailable. To avoid penalties, validators need to keep the availability of their infrastructure as high as possible, and it is a good reason why to run it on the cloud. Each validator has a public-private keypair associated with it. The validator keys (the public and private keys) are used to collect, and withdraw the 32 ETH collateral and any rewards that have been collected. The withdrawal feature is available in Ethereum\u2019s Shapella update. Generating and storing validator keys in an unsecure manner poses risks of leaked keys. Other than withdrawal of the collateral by malicious parties, leaked keys can also be used to perform long-range attacks, putting the entire Ethereum network at risk of a history rewrite. Long-range attacks work by creating and maintaining a parallel chain, thus rewriting the entire history of the blockchain. To reconstruct a parallel chain, the keys of past validators are needed. Therefore, in this blog post we will focus on safeguarding the validator keys since their inception.\n\nSolution overview\n\nWhen generating new Ethereum validator keys, the common practice is to use code written and tested by the community. But in addition to the code itself, the overall solution should:\n\nMake sure the private key will never be exposed right after generation and always stays encrypted at rest.\n\nSet the process to get assurance that the code generating the key pair is properly reviewed before deployment, and only the reviewed version can be deployed.\n\nBe as cost-effective as possible because key generation is a relatively rare process and we don\u2019t need always-on resources to support it.\n\nIn the proposed solution, we run staking-deposit-cli tool from the official Ethereum GitHub account in AWS Lambda. staking-deposit-cli tool is used generate EIP-2335 format BLS12-381 keystores (the public and private key-pair) and a corresponding deposit data JSON file. The deposit data JSON file is to be uploaded to Ethereum Staking Launchpad to signify registration of the validator to the Ethereum network. The aforementioned items are generated in-memory in AWS Lambda. We also introduce two personas: release manager and developer, to facilitate the code review process. The release manager is authorized to sign the code shared by developer with a signing profile from AWS Signer. The code signing feature of Lambda ensures that the source code package of the secure key-generation function is signed with the signing profile controlled by the release manager.\n\nThe following diagram depicts the key components and how they are used for code deployment and key generation. The accompanying GitHub repository contains the code and instructions for deploying this solution into your own account.\n\nThe diagram includes the following high-level steps to deploy the function code, review it, and then use that function to generate keys:\n\nDeveloper packages the source code for the staking-deposit tool and uploads it to the deployment Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. The release manager triggers the code signing process with AWS Signer. AWS Signer creates the signed version of the source code. The release manager triggers the deployment of the signed code package to Lambda. An automated trigger or an individual authorized user triggers the key-generation Lambda function. The Lambda function generates the secrets in-memory and encrypts them using data encryption key within AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). In our sample application we pre-generate the KMS data encryption key during the deployment of the solution. The secret generated by the function is JSON-formatted data which consists of the following: An encrypted BLS12-381 keystore\n\nA randomly generated password to decrypt the keystore\n\nA mnemonic from which the private key is derived from The Lambda function sends the encrypted secrets and the deposit data in base64 format to Amazon DynamoDB. It can be retrieved from the DynamoDB table, decoded, and finally uploaded to the staking launchpad.\n\nFinally, upload the deposit data JSON object to the staking launchpad to finish the staking process. The deposit data JSON object is not encrypted \u2013 that\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t contain any sensitive information, so it can be It can be retrieved from the DynamoDB table (see the details in the README of the accompanying GitHub repository)\n\nAfter our secrets are encrypted and stored safely, we can use it to sign attestations, which we will discuss next.\n\nKey decryption and usage\n\nIn our solution, the AWS KMS key policy shouldn\u2019t grant the Lambda function access to perform decryption of the encrypted validator key because the Lambda will never sign attestations. Instead, the key policy should be modified to allow only the protected compute, such as isolated Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance or even more isolated AWS Nitro Enclaves, to decrypt the encrypted validator keys in order to sign attestations. The code on those instances performs the following actions:\n\nRetrieve the validator private key from DynamoDB as cyphertext. Decrypt the cyphertext with the corresponding data encryption key in AWS KMS. Pass the decrypted validator key to Web3Signer code to sign attestations.\n\nIn the following series of blog posts we show the example of how such system will work, so will omit the details here.\n\nThe isolated Lambda execution environment for secure key generation\n\nIn Lambda, execution environments are isolated from one another and may only be used for one concurrent invocation at a time. Customers and other users can initiate inbound or ingress network communications with an execution environment only through the Lambda\u2019s Invoke API, which triggers the invocation of a Lambda function (services\u2019 data plane). This helps ensure that communications to your execution environment are authenticated and authorized, and that users can interact with its storage or memory only through the code that you deployed. In addition, all customer data stored within the management APIs of Lambda (its control plane) is encrypted at rest through the use of AWS KMS, which is designed to protect it from unauthorized disclosure or tampering. At the same time, Lambda execution environments may be reused across multiple invocations of the same function version for performance reasons. Therefore, the function code in the accompanying sample app regenerates the secrets for every new invocation to make sure they are not reused by subsequent calls.\n\nFor audit purposes, you can also enable AWS CloudTrail logs on the AWS account with the deployed Lambda function and use AWS Config to track your function configuration changes.\n\nFor more information on Lambda security, refer to Security Overview of AWS Lambda.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post, we learned about the new role of validators in the Ethereum network that participate in the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. We reviewed the requirements for safe key generation on cloud and walked through a sample solution architecture and the process it helps facilitate. We also reviewed the security aspects that Lambda brings into the picture, and how it encompasses security best practices using Lambda.\n\nTo learn more about using the encrypted validator keys in a secure environment using AWS Nitro Enclaves read this series of blog posts: part 1, part 2.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nNikolay Vlasov is a Senior Solutions Architect with AWS Worldwide Specialist Solutions Architect organization focused on blockchain-related workloads.

        "title": "Polygon zkEVM: Ethereum's Leading zkRollup Blockchain? - DailyCoin",
        "content": "With the Polygon zkEVM, Polygon (MATIC) is adding another weapon to its arsenal and reinstating its claim as the ultimate Ethereum (ETH) scaling ecosystem. Polygon\u2019s zkEVM network aims to offer users unmatched security and minimal gas fees, outperforming other scaling solutions.\n\nDespite their considerable resources, Polygon Labs isn\u2019t the first crypto team to release a zero-knowledge rollup to boast EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) functionality. In fact, on-chain metrics suggest that the Polygon zkEVM is playing catch-up, falling behind other players in the Layer-2 Race.\n\nIs the Polygon zkEVM truly the future of Ethereum scalability? How is the new network different from the existing Polygon PoS network?\n\nWhat Is Polygon zkEVM?\n\nPolygon zkEVM is a Layer-2 network that combines two powerful technologies to boost blockchain scalability and security. Using zero-knowledge proofs and industry-standard Ethereum Virtual Machine, the Polygon zkEVM is touted as \u2018the next big thing.\u2019\n\nSource: Twitter\n\nThe network was brought to life in March 2023 when Vitalik Buterin signed the first transaction on the new blockchain. Inspired by Neil Armstrong, the Ethereum co-founder etched \u201cA few million constraints for man, unconstrained scalability for mankind\u201d into the Polygon zkEVM mainnet forever.\n\nHow Does Polygon zkEVM Work?\n\nTo better understand how Polygon\u2019s shiny new blockchain works, let\u2019s briefly break down its two key features.\n\nZero-knowledge validity proofs are a creative way to show someone you know sensitive information without actually revealing the content of the information itself. This provides users greater security and privacy while taking advantage of a more scalable network.\n\nSource: Polygon Labs\n\nIn the case of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, zkRollups enable a network to batch up groups and transactions and prove they\u2019re valid without revealing what the transactions actually are. These transactions are sent back to the Ethereum blockchain, where they\u2019re settled using the network\u2019s famed security.\n\nIn its most basic terms, the Ethereum Virtual Machine is essentially the operating system of the Ethereum mainnet. It allows users to write smart contracts and deploy dApps and services on-chain. By running an EVM blockchains can host Ethereum-based applications. This helps users and developers interact with the network in a familiar environment.\n\nCombining these features, the Polygon zkEVM gives users the best of both worlds. They enjoy the scalability of a Layer-2 network and EVM-equivalence, with the privacy and security of Ethereum zkr ollup technology.\n\nPolygon zkEVM vs. Polygon PoS Mainnet\n\nWhile both networks aim to scale Ethereum, their methods are slightly different.\n\nPolygon PoS is a sidechain that is EVM-compatible. It runs parallel to the Ethereum mainnet and is secured by a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Gas fees on the network are paid in MATIC, the native token of the Polygon ecosystem.\n\nPolygon zkEVM is a network built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. It uses zero-knowledge architecture to speed up processing times while benefitting from the security of Ethereum\u2019s consensus. Gas fees are paid in ETH, not MATIC.\n\nInstead of being EVM-compatible, the network aims to be EVM-equivalent. Let me explain what this means.\n\nAccording to Polygon Labs, the ultimate goal is not EVM compatibility. Compatible means that the network can operate within the confines of Ethereum\u2019s broader ecosystem. Existing dApps and developer toolsets can still be ported over but might require slight code changes to avoid bugs.\n\nEVM equivalence suggests that Polygon zkEVM offers users an identical environment and experience while benefitting from improved scalability. Polygon Labs argues that the best way to scale Ethereum is to become its equal rather than simply operating within its limits.\n\nPolygon zkEVM Competitors\n\nFor all its hype and excitement, Polygon is not the only crypto project exploring zkEVM networks. ZkSync actually beat Polygon Labs to market and released their mainnet a few days before the Polygon zkEVM went live.\n\nOn-chain metrics indicate that zkSync is by far the more popular network. Within two weeks of the launch of both blockchains, zkSync has attracted $72M in TVL (Total Value Locked). In contrast, the Polygon zkEVM has only accrued $1M in TVL.\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nIn that wasn\u2019t enough, almost ten times more users have bridged over to zkSync compared to Polygon zkEVM. While zkSync is home to over 300,000 unique wallet addresses, the Polygon zkEVM mainnet beta is lagging behind with only 32,000 unique wallets.\n\nThough this could be considered a grim indicator for Polygon Labs, this staggering difference might be due to speculation around a possible zkSync token airdrop. Airdrop eligibility is often given to early supporters who bridge to new chains and provide liquidity in DeFi applications.\n\nIn any case, both zkRollups pale compared to other Ethereum scaling solutions. Optimistic rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism are clear winners in the Layer-2 adoption race, with millions of unique wallets and billions of dollars in TVL.\n\nWhat Can I Do On Polygon zkEVM?\n\nIf you\u2019re familiar with the Polygon PoS network or any other EVM blockchain, the Polygon zkEVM has similar use cases. The blockchain is used to store and transfer cryptocurrency in self-custodial accounts.\n\nThe network is also home to a variety of open-source DeFi applications like decentralized exchanges and lending platforms. NFT marketplaces are emerging, with several early collections vying for prominence in a relatively uncharted network.\n\nHow Do I Connect to Polygon zkEVM?\n\nHopping over to the Polygon zkEVM mainnet is easy and only takes 10-15 minutes. Head to the official Polygon zkEVM Bridge site and connect your Web3 wallet. The Polygon zkEVM RPC will usually automatically add and configure itself to your wallet.\n\nSource: Polygon zkEVM Bridge\n\nIf you\u2019re still struggling, head to Chainlist, search for Polygon zkEVM, and manually add the network to your wallet.\n\nRemember that the network uses ETH as a native gas token, so you\u2019ll need to bridge some Ether and keep some in reverse to pay your gas fees while you explore the network.\n\nPolygon zkEVM Pros and Cons\n\nLaunching an exciting new blockchain network always comes with overwhelming claims of \u2018revolutionary, new paradigms\u2019 and \u2018game-changing technology.\u2019 Let\u2019s cut through the noise and look at the facts.\n\nPros\n\nSolid reputation \u2013 Polygon Labs is one of the most reliable teams in the blockchain industry with a history of delivering high-quality products. They\u2019ve secured partnerships with some of the world\u2019s largest companies, like Starbucks and Meta,, and helped incubate hundreds of emerging crypto projects through ecosystem grants.\n\nEVM-equivalence \u2013 The network is EVM-equivalent, making it an ideal environment for users and developers to bridge over from Ethereum, the most popular Layer-1 blockchain.\n\nScalability \u2013 The zkEVM promises high transaction throughput and minuscule gas fees. According to Quicknode, users should enjoy transaction finality in 2-3 seconds and transaction costs of around $0.000084.\n\nZero-knowledge proofs \u2013 Zkproofs bring greater security and privacy to blockchain. Being able to validate transactions without needing to disclose sensitive details about the transaction opens many doors in decentralized finance.\n\nCons\n\nLow adoption rates \u2013 The launch of the Polygon zkEVM was a hotly anticipated catalyst for the Polygon ecosystem. However, the lack of users has arguably been anticlimactic. Polygon Labs needs to find some way of incentivizing network use.\n\nCompetitive niche \u2013 Ethereum scaling is one of the biggest pain points in the industry. Alternative zkEVM networks like zkSync dominate Polygon zkEVM regarding user adoption, while optimistic rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism are light-years ahead.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nAll the excitement and discussion shouldn\u2019t detract from what is arguably the largest service in the Polygon Labs ecosystem. The Polygon PoS sidechain is still one of the industry\u2019s largest networks, driving mass adoption through incredible partnerships with top Web2 companies.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nZero-knowledge validity proofs are certainly an innovative use of blockchain technology. The competition between Ethereum scaling solutions might be stiff. Still, Polygon Labs has a history of success, and despite a slow start, their zkEVM is expected to host exciting new applications in the Web 3 world.\n\nFAQs"

        "title": "How to use Ganache for blockchain project development - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Programming languages like Solidity, which is used to build smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain network, are frequently used in blockchain development. Ganache helps developers test and debug their applications before deploying them on a live blockchain network. Also, developers must be well-versed in blockchain technology, including its underlying architecture and concepts like consensus algorithms, cryptography and decentralized governance.\n\nThis article will discuss what Ganache is, and how you can use it in decentralized application (DApp) development.\n\nWhat is Ganache in blockchain technology?\n\nGanache is a software tool developers widely use to create a local blockchain network for testing and development purposes. Developers may effectively test different scenarios and troubleshoot their blockchain apps by simulating a blockchain network on their local PC with Ganache. Ganache supports the quick development of distributed applications using Ethereum and Filecoin.\n\nThe tool is first installed on the developer\u2019s computer, and a new workspace must be created before using Ganache for blockchain project development. Developers can link their blockchain project to Ganache once the workspace has been built, enabling them to test and debug their application on the simulated blockchain network.\n\nGanache provides a range of useful features, including the creation of new accounts, the ability to send transactions and the capability to debug smart contracts. By effectively locating and fixing bugs in their smart contract code, developers can use Ganache as a debugging tool to speed up the development process. The debugger feature allows developers to comb through their code line-by-line and see the values of variables at each step, making it easier to find and fix bugs.\n\nTwo versions of Ganache are available: a user interface (UI) and a command line interface (CLI). Thanks to the user-friendly Ganache UI, developers can quickly communicate with the local blockchain. In addition to offering real-time data on accounts, balances, transactions and events, it also has tools for testing and debugging smart contracts. In addition, the interface includes a built-in block explorer tool that lets users examine the specifics of each block and transaction.\n\nOn the other hand, developers can communicate with the local blockchain via the terminal using the Ganache CLI. It is a more versatile and compact choice for people who prefer using command-line tools. Developers may automate testing and deployment operations by integrating the CLI with other development tools and scripts.\n\nRegardless, the essential functionality of the Ganache UI and CLI is the same, and developers can choose the version that best suits their tastes and workflow.\n\nIs Ganache blockchain free?\n\nYes, Ganache is a free, open-source blockchain development tool. The personal blockchain network can be launched and managed using Ganache\u2019s user-friendly interface. To make it simple for developers to test their smart contracts in a secure environment, it also produces private keys for the accounts generated in the network.\n\nRelated: The importance of open-source in computer science and software development\n\nIn the Ethereum development community, Ganache is a popular tool for creating, evaluating and deploying smart contracts. It is ideal for developers to incorporate it into their workflows because it is interoperable with other Ethereum development tools like the Truffle Suite framework. Truffle Suite is an Ethereum development framework for building, testing and deploying smart contracts on the blockchain.\n\nAre Truffle and Ganache the same blockchain?\n\nTruffle and Ganache are not the same blockchains, but they are closely related tools used in blockchain development. Truffle can be used with various blockchain networks, but as a local development network, it is most often used with Ganache.\n\nBefore releasing their smart contracts to a live network, developers can use Truffle to design, compile and test them on the Ganache network. This makes it possible to design and test software fast and affordably, and iterate on and modify the code of smart contracts.\n\nHow to install and use Ganache\n\nGanache is an essential tool for blockchain developers, as it allows them to test and debug their applications on a simulated blockchain network before deploying them on a live network. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how to install and use Ganache for personal Ethereum blockchain development:\n\nStep 1: Download and install Ganache\n\nDownload the application for your operating system from the official Ganache website. Run the installation file after downloading it, then install the application on your computer by adhering to the on-screen prompts. Ganache is available for Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems in all its versions.\n\nStep 2: Create a new workspace\n\nTo create a new workspace, open the Ganache application and select \u201cNew Workspace.\u201d Users can set up the network parameters for their unique Ethereum blockchain in the workspace settings, including the number of accounts, the gas limit and the starting balance of each account.\n\nAn Ethereum workspace is a set of settings and user accounts that establish the parameters for a customized Ethereum blockchain network built using Ganache. Developers may quickly set up a private Ethereum network for testing and development purposes using workspaces.\n\nStep 3: Start the personal Ethereum blockchain network\n\nAfter configuring the network settings, click \u201cStart\u201d to begin your own private Ethereum blockchain network. For each of the accounts you set up in the workspace settings, Ganache will generate a set of private keys. Then, copy the remote procedure call (RPC) server address from the top of the screen, as you\u2019ll need this to connect your development tool.\n\nUsing the RPC communication protocol, client software can invoke a server-side process from a distance. As a result, it is feasible to activate a procedure or function in another address space or process without the programmer worrying about the specifics of the underlying network transport or communication protocols. It enables programs to communicate with other systems on a network.\n\nStep 4: Connect your development tool to the Ganache network\n\nIt is necessary to link one\u2019s development tool, such as Truffle Suite, to the Ganache network to deploy and test smart contracts on the private Ethereum blockchain. To do so, follow these steps:\n\nOpen your development tool and find the settings or configuration menu.\n\nSearch for a provider or network selection option, then type the RPC server address you copied from Ganache.\n\nTo ensure your development tool uses the new network, save your modifications and restart it.\n\nStep 5: Test and deploy smart contracts\n\nAfter configuring the network, users can deploy and test their smart contracts on the private Ethereum blockchain. Using the Truffle command line interface, they can compile and deploy their contracts to the Ganache network. Once the contracts are deployed, the Truffle CLI can interact with them and test their functionality.\n\nIt allows developers to interact with their smart contracts and the underlying blockchain network using various commands. Using the Truffle CLI, developers can automate the building and deployment of smart contracts, making it easier to develop and deploy DApps.\n\nWhen a smart contract is deployed to the mainnet, it must be submitted to the network, and a fee in cryptocurrency is paid to cover the cost of running the contract on the blockchain. When a contract is deployed, it becomes unchangeable and immutable. To guarantee that the smart contract works as intended and is secure, testing it properly before deployment is crucial.\n\nAn example of a simple contract deployment using Truffle CLI\n\nStep 1: Go to the directory where one wishes to build a project by opening the terminal or command prompt.\n\nStep 2: To start a new Truffle project, enter the following command:\n\n\u201cTruffle init\u201d is a command that initializes a new Truffle project with a basic directory structure and configuration files.\n\nStep 3: Under the contracts directory, add a new Solidity contract file. Here\u2019s an example of a simple contract that stores a string:\n\nThe above code is a smart contract written in the Solidity programming language. One declared variable, a public string variable called \u201cmyString,\u201d is present in the contract named \u201cMyContract.\u201d Everybody on the blockchain can access the string variable, which is initialized to \u201cHello, world!\u201d\n\nWith a tool like Ganache, this contract can be set up on a private blockchain or an Ethereum network. Once installed, it can be used to interact with transactions sent to its blockchain address.\n\nStep 4: A contract can be compiled by running the following command:\n\n\u201cTruffle compile\u201d is a command that compiles the contract code and generates an application binary interface (ABI) and bytecode. The ABI serves as the interface between smart contracts and applications, while bytecode is a smart contract\u2019s compiled version that may be run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nStep 5: Run the following command to deploy the contract to a local blockchain network like Ganache:\n\n\u201cTruffle migrate\u201d is a command used to deploy the contract to the local network and create a new migration script in the \u201cmigrations\u201d directory.\n\nStep 6: Run the following command to interact with the deployed contract using the Truffle console:\n\n\u201cTruffle console\u201d opens up a console with the web3.js library and contract artifacts loaded, allowing interaction with a blockchain network.\n\nStep 7: By establishing an instance of their contract and calling its functions once they are on the console, users can communicate with their contract. For instance, the following commands can be used to retrieve the value of myString:\n\nThe value of a string variable (myString) is then retrieved from the deployed instance of a smart contract (MyContract) using the above code. The output \u201cHello, world!\u201d is printed to the console using \u201cconsole.log(result).\u201d\n\nAdvantages of using Ganache\n\nUsing Ganache as a blockchain development tool has several benefits. One of the key advantages is that it gives users access to a private Ethereum blockchain network with an intuitive UI for testing and development. As a result, programmers can test their smart contracts in a safe and private setting before using them on a live network. By offering a local network, developers can also avoid the high costs and prolonged transaction times linked to public networks.\n\nFor testing and development, Ganache also produces private keys for the accounts formed in the network, adding another level of protection. Moreover, creating, testing and deploying smart contracts on the blockchain is made simpler due to Ganache\u2019s compatibility with the Truffle Suite framework.\n\nThe creation of DApps, such as blockchain-based games, and the testing of smart contracts for blockchain-based supply chain management systems are examples of how Ganache can be used.\n\nChallenges of using Ganache for blockchain development\n\nWhile Ganache is a powerful tool for blockchain development, there are still some challenges that developers may encounter. The fact that Ganache is a local development network and not directly connected to the Ethereum mainnet presents one of the main difficulties. Because of this, there may be differences in how smart contracts behave when deployed to a live network between the Ganache network and the mainnet, which may cause unforeseen problems.\n\nThe fact that Ganache might not always reflect the same conditions as a live network presents another difficulty with using it. Ganache, for instance, lets developers establish their own gas rates, which might not match those on a real network. When implementing smart contracts on a live network, this can cause problems because the gas price might not be enough to complete the transaction.\n\nFinally, issues with Ganache\u2019s interoperability with other Ethereum development tools may arise. Although Ganache and the Truffle Suite framework are pretty compatible, there can be problems if developers use other programs or libraries that are not made to function with Ganache."

        "title": "Haroon Mirza and Mat Collishaw launch NFT projects in the wake of Ethereum's eco-upgrade - Art Newspaper",
        "content": "In circles both artistic and environmental, the very mention of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) often causes lips to curl. These digital units, which use blockchain technology to record the ownership of an artwork (or any other asset), are widely decried as vehicles for financial speculation with little intrinsic artistic value. Then there\u2019s the environmental impact. NFTs are criticised for their heavy carbon footprint, residing as they do on the notoriously power-intensive blockchain and requiring huge amounts of energy to be minted. A 2021 analysis of around 18,000 NFTs by the digital artist Memo Akten found that the average footprint of a single NFT was equivalent to a month\u2019s electricity usage by an average EU resident.\n\nBut now the tide seems to be turning. Many of the biggest NFT marketplaces operate on the Ethereum blockchain, which cut carbon emissions by more than 99% in an upgrade known as \u201cthe Merge\u201d in September 2022. The network switched to a different \u201cproof of stake\u201d system that requires only a fraction of energy per transaction compared to the previous \u201cproof of work\u201d system. Other blockchains such as Tezos, Cardano and Kusama also use the \u201cproof of stake\u201d mechanism which looks like it is becoming the norm for minting and trading more energy-efficient NFTs.\n\nStill of Haroon Mirza's Solstice Star NFT Courtesy of the artist and Lisson gallery\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the crypto crash last year has reduced the hype surrounding NFTs and artists are starting to feel less squeamish about exploring the potential of blockchain as a creative space. Case in point is Haroon Mirza, an artist who works with sound, light and electricity to create kinetic sculptures, performances and immersive installations, who launched his first NFT project during his recent show at London\u2019s Lisson Gallery. Solstice Star released the first 200 of 1,000 minted NFTs\u200b\u200b\u2014featuring a GIF of a red-and-white fly agaric mushroom framed by a star of eight rotating solar panels\u2014for free to anyone logging on to solsticestar.xyz and verse.works .\n\n\u201cI was immediately into cryptocurrencies and I\u2019ve always thought that blockchain was an incredible technology that\u2019s going to revolutionise how we do things,\u201d Mirza says. But while intrigued by the initial emergence of NFTs, he was quickly put off by the feeding frenzy around the $69m Beeple sale at Christie\u2019s in March 2021. \u201cIt became like a Ponzi scheme within a Ponzi scheme and I didn\u2019t want anything to do with that part of it,\u201d he states. \u201cIt just became a way to invest in often dirty crypto and the type of art that went with it just made you want to throw up.\u201d\n\nThe subsidence of speculative interest in NFTs along with the switch to a more sustainable system encouraged Mirza\u2014whose work often revolves around the technological pursuit of energy\u2014to revisit the blockchain. \u201cThe Merge has made Ethereum a completely different platform to what it was before,\u201d he says, adding that for him the appeal of NFTs is conceptual rather than aesthetic.\n\n\u201cNothing about the NFT interests me other than the fact that the artwork is also the certificate and completely transparent, with everything inherent in the work itself,\u201d he states. \u201cNFTs are completely decentralised\u2014I like the idea of an artwork being a non-hierarchical community that can engage with itself in a productive way. It\u2019s like having an artwork that is inherently collaborative: it\u2019s what I do in my work anyway, and that\u2019s the thing that really excites me.\u201d\n\nFor Mirza, Solstice Star is simply \u201ca first step, an entry point\u201d into a larger interactive project that will unfold over time. The next iteration will incorporate sound, a key part of his practice. All the owners of Solstice Star NFTs will be invited to select a frequency within the human hearing range of 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz, which will then be used by the artist to create a new sound work.\n\n\u201cThe potential is that you can evolve a project that has a feedback loop with the people that are collecting it,\u201d the artist says. \u201cIt\u2019s a living thing, a live project that can grow and develop into a non-hierarchical network.\u201d Down the line, the project also promises to reap environmental benefits, with Mirza aiming to put in place a smart contract that will direct some of the proceeds towards research into renewable energies.\n\nThe communal, participatory aspect of NFTs is also a major draw for Mat Collishaw who, like Mirza, is making his first foray into the field. \u201cI\u2019m always looking for new media and if there is a new form for making an artwork, with a new vocabulary attached to it, then I want to be in there,\u201d says Collishaw. In the past the artist has used VR, animatronics and CGI as well as oil paint, mosaic, and blown glass to make stunning and sometimes shocking artworks that explore ideas around death, decay and the darker side of human nature.\n\nThe \"greenhouse\", part of Mat Collishaw's Heterosis NFT project Courtesy of the artist\n\nDrawing parallels between the craze for NFTs and 17th-century \u201ctulip mania\u201d, when entire fortunes were made and lost speculating on tulip bulbs in the Netherlands, Collishaw created Heterosis , an NFT project which allows users to cultivate bespoke animated digital flowers. Each one of these unique NFT blooms combines computer algorithms with floral genetic coding, thus enabling collectors to collaborate with one another on new hybrid species. The result is an infinite range of ever more exotic and elaborate creations. Collectors can manipulate their specimens just for pleasure or for the financial rewards of reselling them\u2014or both.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely down to the collectors what they do,\u201d Collishaw says. \u201cThe first iteration of the flower is fairly simple and the colours are pretty straightforward. They can get a lot more elaborate\u2026 we wanted to give people the incentive to breed.\u201d To spice things up, the artist has introduced a number of recessive genes that will throw up new characteristics impossible to control or predict. \u201cThere are several secret species that will be unlocked when certain breeding patterns are done,\u201d he declares. How these surprise features will affect a flower\u2019s resale value remains to be seen.\n\nSince they were released on the OpenSea NFT platform last month, all 2,500 of these infinitely mutate-able blooms have been snapped up at the initial cost of around \u00a3120 each in cryptocurrency. Collishaw is pleased that collectors have already begun to interact with each other to hybridise their flowers. Apparently some are even making additional revenue by setting competitive prices for anyone wanting to breed from theirs. The more sought-after the individual flower, the higher the price.\n\nThe \"greenhouse\", part of Mat Collishaw's Heterosis NFT project Courtesy of the artist\n\nThese hybridising transactions take place in a centralised digital space called \u201cthe Greenhouse\u201d where collectors can adopt an avatar, contact other participants and view all the Heterosis flowers growing in their most recent state. Here all the properties of a specimen can be assessed, including its market value. In keeping with Collishaw\u2019s track record of finding beauty in entropy, this interactive environment simulates the form of London\u2019s National Gallery if it were abandoned to decay. The flowers are set against a backdrop of mildewed Old Master paintings, while vegetation sprouts from the floor and the ceilings play host to a mass of dangling vines.\n\nViewing this ghostly setting where the great works of art history are reclaimed by nature, and where nature also co-exists with manipulated digital blooms, raises all manner of questions around value, beauty, desirability, natural and artificial selection. \u201cIt\u2019s quite shocking to me that you\u2019ve got the cream of 400 years of European art but nobody is looking because the only organic life is plant life,\u201d the artist observes.\n\nCollishaw also draws analogies between the traditional role of the National Gallery as a networking hub \u201cwhere citizens could gather and share intelligence\u201d and the circulation of knowledge around natural science, art and commerce exchanged amongst the tulip merchants and speculators in 17th-century Holland. These ideas around informational networks come full circle with the way in which Heterosis encourages its collectors to form an online community to trade data pertaining to their holdings as they bring the project to its full fruition.\n\nGiven the botanical theme of the project and its multifaceted exploration of how humankind has shaped the natural world for financial gain, it was especially important for Collishaw to wait for the \u201cproof of stake\u201d blockchain system to be in place before any NFT drop. \u201cI was keeping a close eye on the situation,\u201d he confirms, adding that he is also glad that the intrinsic immateriality of NFTs avoids the shipping, storage and other energy-hungry requirements of analogue art.\n\nThe fact that minting NFTs is no longer an environmental hazard has enabled both Collishaw and Mirza, in their very distinct but also overlapping ways, to demonstrate the rich and inclusive potential of the non-fungible token as an interactive artistic endeavour. Never mind that neither artist has yet made much money from their sortie into NFTs\u2014profits were never the point.\n\nAs Collishaw puts it, \u201cIn making an NFT I created an artwork that exists in a way not possible in any other context. Its value has been as an experiment, and a very interesting one. I\u2019ve learnt a lot doing it\u2014but I could have earned more by cleaning windows.\u201d\n\nHowever things play out in the crypto market, it looks as if NFT art is very much here to stay in its new, greener form.\n\n\u2022 Haroon Mirza: Solstice Star\n\n\u2022 Mat Collishaw: Heterosis\n\n\u2022 Mat Collishaw will have a solo exhibition, All Things Fall, at the Bomb Factory Art Foundation, London, 20 April-21 May"

        "content": "Keep an Eye on These Coins\n\nNothing is certain in the cryptocurrency market, but the prices of most major assets have been maintaining their positions above important support levels in recent weeks. Next, traders will watch whether these tokens can break above their resistance levels, which seems possible for some.\n\nThis week, we examine WOO Network (WOO), Render Token (RNDR), Arbitrum (ARB), Rocket Pool (RPL), and Solana (SOL). In selecting these assets, we have considered several factors, including positive technical developments, significant news events, and noticeable changes in price.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways WOO Network (WOO)'s price increased by 53%, possibly because of the shift toward decentralized exchanges (DEXs), like the one it offers, after the collapse of FTX in late 2022.\n\nRender Token (RNDR) jumped by 47%, perhaps because of the project's migration to the Solana network.\n\nproject's migration to the Solana network. Ethereum scaling solution Arbitrum (ARB) posted a 38% increase in price, amid accumulation by big holders, or \"whales,\" and a gain in market share taken from scaling solution Optimism.\n\nRocket Pool (RPL) went up by about 32%, likely because of Ethereum\u2019s successful Shapella upgrade.\n\nSolana (SOL) gained more than 25% after the announcement of the launch date of the Solana Android mobile phone.\n\n\n\nWOO Network (WOO)\n\nWOO Network (WOO) was this week\u2019s biggest gainer, rallying by 53%. This was likely due to two major trends: traders generally moving toward DEXs like the one offered by WOO Network following the collapse of FTX, which was a centralized exchange, and an increase in the use of WOO Network's protocol. Its team last week reported a substantial increase in the number of active users.\n\nWOO Network is a crypto trading platform that offers both centralized and decentralized trading options. It also provides deep liquidity and tools and analytics dashboards for traders. WOO is trading at around 31 cents and was priced at about 21 cents last week (see chart below).\n\n\n\nWOO Price: TradingView\n\nRender Token (RNDR)\n\nRender Token (RNDR) was the next biggest gainer for the week, increasing by 47%, most likely because of a migration to the Solana network. Render Token experienced significant developments during 2022, and the Solana migration adds to an ongoing increase at the start of the second quarter of 2023.\n\nRender Token provides a decentralized GPU rendering system that allows broader access to complex rendering processes. The project has utility in such industries as media, gaming, virtual reality, and medicine. RNDR is currently priced at around $1.92 and was $1.30 last week (see chart below).\n\n\n\nRNDR Price: TradingView\n\nArbitrum (ARB)\n\nEthereum scaling solution Arbitrum (ARB) also recorded a substantial increase in price, going up by 38%, possibly because of accumulation by Arbitrum whales and increased market share. Whales\u2014an industry term for large holders of tokens\u2014bought large amounts of ARB over the latest week. Arbitrum also experienced better performance across the board than Optimism, another scaling solution, and gained some of Optimism's market share, according to crypto research firm Messari.\n\nArbitrum is a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum that provides better performance for users. Layer-2 networks sit on top of the first network, leading to cheaper and faster transactions. Arbitrum is changing hands at around $1.63 and was trading at $1.18 last week (see chart below).\n\n\n\nARB Price: TradingView\n\nRocket Pool (RPL)\n\nEthereum staking solution Rocket Pool (RPL)'s token price advanced by more than 32%, possibly because of the success of Ethereum's Shapella upgrade. This upgrade to the Ethereum network The Shapella upgrade combines changes to its execution layer (via the Shanghai upgrade), consensus layer (Capella), and the Engine API. The changes allow users to unstake their ETH from the network.\n\nRocket Pool is a staking solution for Ethereum and has grown in popularity over the past year. It provides easier access to Ethereum staking, as it circumvents the need to hold 32 ETH to participate in the staking process. RPL is priced at around $58.50, rising from about $45.40 last week (see chart below).\n\n\n\nRPL Price: TradingView\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nSolana (SOL) rose by more than 25% after its team disclosed the launch date for the Solana Android mobile phone. The phones have been highly anticipated since being announced in the middle of 2022.\n\nThe phones will sell for about $1,000, and new-order registrations will begin on May 8. Pre-orders will begin shipping on April 20. SOL is trading at around $25.20; it was priced at around $20.30 last week (see chart below).\n\n\n\nSOL Price: TradingView\n\nAs of the date this article was written, the author does not own any of the assets discussed here.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "title": "$1B staked ETH withdrawn in 24hrs as round 2 begins - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "According to on-chain data, the net value of Ethereum removed from staking has surpassed $1 billion in value over the past 24 hours, yet again showcasing the network\u2019s ability to perform live network-wide updates without issue.\n\nETH withdrawals in action\n\nA total of $1.7 billion has been withdrawn since the Shanghai and Capella upgrades went live. However, as round 2 of withdrawals began, the value of Ethereum withdrawn increased. Round 1 took 4.14 days to complete as validators in the queue were processed.\n\n18,442,455 ETH is currently staked, with a value of $38.5 billion as of press time. As a result,\n\nstaked ETH makes up 15.32% of the total supply, with 33% staked with Lido.\n\nWith withdrawals now open, investors have been withdrawing their initial capital and the earned rewards. Staked Ethereum earns interest over time, and when a validator earns over 32 ETH through rewards, the excess amount does not add to their principal. Instead, it gets withdrawn automatically as a reward payment every few days.\n\nThe chart below shows the vast difference between deposits and withdrawals (rewards and principal funds) since the upgrade.\n\nRewards\n\nStaking rewards began around 15% and were put on a predefined falling curve relative to the number of validator participants until the Merge when the network took over. The current validator reward is 4.33%, including consensus rewards and transaction fees. These rewards spiked to around 5.2% in the days leading up to the upgrade but have since returned to their downward trajectory. Total staking rewards have fallen by 1.4% since the Merge last September when they jumped to 5.8% from 4.3%.\n\nIn addition to the change in deposits, withdrawals, and rewards, the average value of Ethereum staked with validators has reduced since withdrawals opened. As a result, 54.3% of stakers are now in profit with ETH around $2,000.\n\nBullish momentum\n\nUltimately, both the Shanghai and Capella upgrades appear to have been a success, as the network is processing new deposits, principal withdrawals, and reward payments without any significant issues. Furthermore, these actions are being performed on a volume of billions of dollars worth of Ethereum daily.\n\nWhile blockchain networks can certainly still be considered to be in beta in many ways, Ethereum\u2019s ability to undertake such enormous undertakings of live network upgrades without issue is highly encouraging for our burgeoning industry."

        "title": "How the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Could Affect Top Ethereum Layer 2 Coins: A Comprehensive Guide - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News",
        "content": "The Shanghai Update is a major and far-reaching change to the Ethereum protocol, which is an important part of the development of Ethereum 2.0. With the merger, Ethereum has successfully switched from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake. The upgrade is designed to make significant improvements to the Ethereum network, including increasing transaction throughput and reducing gas fees. One of the main beneficiaries of these improvements is expected to be layer 2 scaling solutions, which provide a way for Ethereum to handle more transactions without overburdening the main network. In this comprehensive guide, we\u2019ll take a closer look at the top Ethereum layer 2 coins and how they might be impacted by the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade.\n\nPolygon (MATIC)\n\nPolygon is a popular layer 2 scaling solution that uses sidechains to enable faster and cheaper transactions on the Ethereum network.

        "content": "Entrepreneur David Gokhshtein claims ETH will eventually top BTC.\n\nBitcoin hovers around the $30,000 price range with 5.5% weekly gains.\n\nEthereum broke through $2,100 with 12.5% weekly gains.\n\nCrypto entrepreneur David Gokhshtein revealed to his Twitter audience that he expects Ethereum (ETH) to flip Bitcoin (BTC) some time in the future. Not being threatened by getting roasted by his Bitcoin Maximalist friends, the Half-Baked Hero received some surprising answers from crypto aficionados.\n\n$ETH will eventually flip $BTC. I don\u2019t know for how long, but it will. \u2014 David Gokhshtein (@davidgokhshtein) April 16, 2023\n\nCrypto Twitter Does the Math\n\nAs per usual, David Gokhshtein\u2019s bald statements didn\u2019t go unnoticed. \u201cIt already did, brother,\u201d asserts Julian Kent, a crypto enthusiast who argues that adding all the ERC-20 tokens in the TOP 50 by global market capitalization does the trick. \u201cIt has been surpassed for a while now,\u201d Mr. Kent claims, while another crypto trader Sprack Burger remarks \u201cAlready has. Look at all the ERC-20 tokens with good liquidity.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s look deeper at these claims: the leading digital asset Bitcoin has a global market capitalization of $578,508,586,135. On the other hand, the leading altcoin and NFT favorite blockchain Ethereum sits at $249,842,988,311. Bitcoin\u2019s market dominance is 43.9%, while Ethereum\u2019s is 19%.\n\nOn top of that, the global cryptocurrency market rank has many ERC-20 tokens, which are based on Ethereum, including Shiba Inu (SHIB), Uniswap (UNI), top stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), along with the scaling solutions that come from forked versions of Ethereum\u2019s code, like Polygon (MATIC).\n\nEthereum Kneels Before Bitcoin?\n\nAdding up all of the Ethereum-related altcoin with at least $5 billion, the global market cap of the TOP 20, stopping at decentralized crypto exchange Uniswap (UNI), equals to $402.5bn at the time of publication, which refutes these claims for the time being.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that popular altcoins with large market capitalization like BNB (BNB), XRP (XRP), and TRX (TRX) have been excluded from the count since these altcoins originally started as ERC-20 tokens but later developed their own blockchains.\n\nUltimately, the swift growth of Ethereum-based tokens is evident in the numbers, but it\u2019s yet to top Bitcoin. The ongoing squabble on Twitter between Ethereum enthusiasts and Bitcoin Maximalists gave birth to many heated discussions and a flurry of sarcastic memes.\n\nBTC and ETH Maxis are fighting it out on Twitter\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nMany crypto enthusiasts in the Twitter thread argue that Bitcoin will remain \u201cthe mother of all crypto,\u201d comparing Bitcoin\u2019s long-term value to gold.\n\nMany also argue that \u201cBitcoin would have to crash big time\u201d for that to happen.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nThe two largest digital assets are enjoying solid bull runs, as BTC and ETH both recently achieved yearly highs.\n\nExplore trending crypto stories on DailyCoin:\n\nGokhshtein Shocked: Dogecoin Surges 7.7% After Twitter Move\n\nTestnets in Crypto: How To Use Test Networks to Earn Cryptocurrency"

        "title": "Ether hits 11-month high as post-Shapella withdrawals pass 1M ETH - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Over 1 million Ether (ETH) worth $2.1 billion has now been withdrawn from Ethereum\u2019s Beacon Chain within the first four days of the Shapella hard fork and Ether has pushed over $2,100 for the first time in 11 months.\n\nThe 1.03 million ETH withdrawals have come from 473,7000 withdrawal requests, with Saturday, April 15 the largest withdrawal day at 392,800 ETH, according to data from beaconcha.in.\n\nOf the active validators, nearly 87% or 469,000 of the 540,000 are now able to withdraw their staked Ether.\n\nApril 15 to 16 saw the largest Ether withdrawals processed so far, with 392,800 and 280,400 Ether withdrawn, respectively. Source: beaconcha.in\n\nWhile members of the Ethereum community were split on what impact Shapella would have on the price of Ether, the first four days have produced close to a 10% rise.\n\nETH has increased about 9% since the Shapella upgrade took effect late on April 12. Source: CoinGecko\n\nThe figures are of little \u201csurprise\u201d to Lachlan Feeney, chief executive of blockchain consulting and development firm Labrys, who told Cointelegraph that many validators are re-staking Ether back onto the Beacon Chain:\n\n\u201cMuch of the stake that has been withdrawn over the last few days is actually going straight back into The Beacon Chain as validators are looking to compound their interest. So much so that net stake is currently increasing.\u201d\n\nGiven the current macroeconomic climate, Feeney said that many early stakers wanted to liquidate after what has been nearly a 30-month wait for some.\n\nOver the mid to long-term, Feeney believes the Shapella hard fork will only increase the amount of Ether staked, which of course will only strengthen Ethereum at the consensus level:\n\n\u201cBecause Shapella is a massive de-risking event, over the medium to long-term more, not less, ETH will be staked. We anticipate that in the not too distant future, we will reach a record high of Ether being staked.\u201d\n\nMarkus Thielen, the head of research at digital asset platform Matrixport, told Cointelegraph that the closure of crypto exchange Kraken\u2019s staking services may have contributed to the higher figures:\n\n\u201cIt appears largely due to the Kraken's staking business being unwound. This will only have a temporary effect as we are also seeing a significant demand from investors who now are able to stake with more visibility on the liquidity of staked positions.\u201d\n\nThielen said he expects a large amount of un-staked Ether from Kraken to be \u201crecycled\u201d back into the Beacon Chain through other entities.\n\nWhile Thielen anticipates the positive price action to cool off this week amid increased selling pressure, he thinks Shapella will ultimately attract more institutional investors to stake on Ethereum.\n\nRelated: 4 strategies for staking Ethereum\n\nThe 1 million milestone is a 500% increase from an April 11 prediction by blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode, which estimated only 170,000 Ether would be un-staked after the first week of Shapella.\n\nOn-chain analytics firm Nansen slightly overshot the mark, predicting 1.4 million Ether would be withdrawn after the first few days of Shapella.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Account abstraction\u2019 supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide"

        "title": "Top 3 Bridges for Algorand - Reviews - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "The birth of Ethereum has guided crypto towards a different trajectory. Yet, Ethereum is slow and costly to transact with. This has brought about the growth of other L1 projects, such as Algorand.\n\nIndeed, projects that are smart contract-enabled now dominate the space. Many of them claim to be able to solve the blockchain trilemma. Simply put, they claim to be already:\n\nScalable. Secure. Decentralized.\n\nAlgorand is one such project. Apart from the above three points, Algorand is also environmentally sustainable. It is also much cheaper to use, with transactions as low as 0.001 $ALGO.\n\n\u201cWow, that sounds great! But, how do I get started with Algorand?\u201d Now if that\u2019s what you\u2019re wondering, then stay tuned. We\u2019ve got a good answer for you!\n\nBridging to Algorand\n\nOne of the easiest ways to get started with Algorand is to use a bridge. A bridge is a tool which allows you to port assets from one blockchain to another. Hence, the term \u201cbridge.\u201d So, if you already have assets on another blockchain, you\u2019re in luck! This article is just for you. Today, we\u2019re going to look at the top three bridges for Algorand.\n\nBridge #1 \u2013 Messina One\n\nFirst of the top three bridges for Algorand is Messina One. Its mission is to promote blockchain interoperability. In terms of safety, Messina One has valid audits from Kudelski Security. It also has put in place 24/7 monitoring and counter-measures. These help to sieve out malicious activity on the bridge.\n\nAs of now, Messina One supports the following chains:\n\nAlgorand\n\nEthereum\n\nCronos\n\nThe newest addition \u2013 Polygon\n\nBut, Messina One isn\u2019t stopping just here! The team is also looking to add on many other chains. These include Binance Chain, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Optimism, and so forth.\n\nNow, what we like about the Messina One bridge is its simple user interface (UI). On its webpage, there are two columns \u2013 \u201cSource\u201d and \u201cDestination.\u201d Connect your wallets for both these chains. Then, select your assets and the amount to bridge. Check that you\u2019ve got enough gas to pay for bridging. Voila! You\u2019re all set to bridge.\n\nSo, what happens if you bridge over a token like $USDC or $USDT to Algorand? You\u2019re pretty much stuck there if you\u2019re new to Algorand. This is because you don\u2019t have any $ALGO for gas to perform any transactions. Fret not! Messina One has this cool feature to \u201crescue\u201d you. It automatically detects such accounts with low to zero $ALGO balances. Then, it airdrops a small amount of $ALGO to you. It\u2019ll be just enough for you to make a few transactions.\n\nFor an in-depth guide on Messina One\u2019s bridge, you can refer to the link here. Next, let\u2019s move on to Bridge #2.\n\nBridge #2 \u2013 Milkomeda\n\nNext of the top 3 bridges for Algorand is Milkomeda. This bridge links the Milkomeda blockchain with Algorand. To elaborate further, Milkomeda is:\n\nA sidechain of Cardano. Milkomeda C1 sidechain aims to integrate the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) onto Cardano.\n\nA roll-up chain for Algorand. Similarly, Milkomeda A1 roll-up chain aims to bring EVM capabilities to Algorand.\n\nWith its sleek UI, it\u2019s pretty easy to bridge to Algorand. But, you\u2019re only able to do so from the Milkomeda A1 roll-up chain. To use this bridge, follow the steps below:\n\nConnect to your Milkomeda and Algorand wallets.\n\nSelect \u201cMilkomeda to Algorand\u201d under the \u201cNetwork Origin\u201d field.\n\nNext, select the asset to bridge over under the \u201cToken\u201d field.\n\nKey in the amount of the asset you want to bridge.\n\nOnce that\u2019s done, follow the prompts from your wallets. You\u2019ll be on your way to Algorand in no time! Do note that by bridging your $ALGO using Milkomeda, you\u2019re \u201cunwrapping\u201d your $ALGO. You can refer to the link here to learn more on how this process works.\n\nWithout further ado, let\u2019s move on to the final bridge for today!\n\nBridge #3 \u2013 Wormhole Bridge\n\nLast, but not least, of the top 3 bridges for Algorand is Wormhole\u2019s Portal bridge. Said bridge helps to move assets across many chains. These include:\n\nEthereum\n\nAvalanche\n\nArbitrum\n\nBinance Chain\n\nAlgorand (of course!) \u2013 and 17 other chains.\n\nAlgorand is now supported in Wormhole Portal Bridge and pNetwork. Here's what it means for $ALGO and #crypto ecosystem. \u2014 Ulam Labs (@ulamlabs) May 20, 2022\n\nBut, how does the Wormhole bridge work so well across so many chains? Let\u2019s discuss this using an example. Assuming you\u2019re looking to send $ETH from Ethereum chain to Algorand. Wormhole bridge will take your original $ETH and lock it into a smart contract. It will then issue wrapped $ETH onto Algorand. The opposite will happen when you decide to bridge from Algorand to Ethereum.\n\nWhen it comes down to safety, Wormhole bridge ensures its contracts can stand up to scrutiny. That\u2019s because Wormhole suffered a hack back in February 2022. This led to losses amounting over $320 million! But today, Wormhole has risen from the ashes. It has put in place many safety features. These comprise:\n\nStrict smart contract audits.\n\nSocial media monitoring.\n\nUsing \u201cGuardian\u201d nodes to validate transactions, and so forth.\n\n\u201cGreat! Sounds like Wormhole bridge is much safer now. How do I get to using it?\u201d If that\u2019s what\u2019s on your mind now, read on! We\u2019ll have a simple guide to bring you through.\n\nFirst, refer to the \u201c1. Source\u201d tab. Choose your \u201cSource\u201d and \u201cTarget\u201d chains. Then, connect your wallet. Next, choose the asset you want to bridge, and the amount to bridge. Then, click \u201cNext.\u201d\n\nSecondly, refer to the \u201c2. Target\u201d tab. Connect your Algorand wallet here. Ensure that you\u2019ve got $ALGO to pay for gas fees in this wallet. At the moment, you can connect using Ledger, My Algo Wallet, and Pera wallet. Then, click on the \u201cManual Payment\u201d option, and then the \u201cNext\u201d button.\n\nMoving on, refer to the \u201c3. Send Tokens\u201d tab. Approve the token limits for transfer. Then, approve the transfer of the tokens itself.\n\nLastly, refer to the \u201c4. Redeem Tokens\u201d tab. Click on the \u201cRedeem\u201d button. Approve the following prompts from you wallet. You should now be able claim your tokens on Algorand!\n\nConclusion\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve run through the top 3 bridges for Algorand. Indeed, your bridging choice should depend much on which source chains your funds reside. But, do keep an eye out for the bridge\u2019s security too. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n\u201cDoes the bridge have audits or safety features in place to prevent hacks?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs the bridge battle-tested?\u201d In other words, has the bridge processed many transactions without issues?\n\nOn top of that, the last criteria would be the bridge\u2019s user interface. Choose a bridge that you feel is most convenient. That\u2019ll make your cross-chain experience a more pleasant one!\n\nNow, let\u2019s not delay any further. Hop onto one of these bridges and head over to Algorand now!\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Check out our most up-to-date research, NFT and Metaverse buy, and how to protect your portfolio in this market by checking out our Altcoin Buzz Access group, which for a limited time, is FREE.

        "title": "Crypto Breaking News: Shiba Inu (SHIB) burn rate up 30000%, Ethereum (ETH) gets ready for Shapella Upgrade ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The world of cryptocurrency is always abuzz with breaking news, and the past few weeks have been no different. From the soaring popularity of Shiba Inu (SHIB) to the upcoming Shapella upgrade for Ethereum (ETH) and the successful $10 million fundraising by RenQ Finance (RENQ), there\u2019s a lot to catch up on in the crypto world. In this article, we\u2019ll dive into the latest crypto-breaking news and what it means for the industry.\n\nShiba Inu Burn Rate Up 30000%\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) has been making waves in the cryptocurrency world, with its popularity skyrocketing in recent months. One of the latest developments with SHIB is its burn rate, which has gone up by an astounding 30000%.The burn rate of Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has experienced a massive surge of over 30,000% in the last 24 hours, thanks to the Koyo token project. Data from the Ethereum blockchain indicates that Koyo burned a whopping 1.49 billion SHIB tokens, helping to reduce the meme-inspired cryptocurrency\u2019s vast supply.\n\nThis is not the first time that Koyo has burned a significant amount of SHIB, as it moved 1.1 billion tokens to a dead wallet earlier this year. Koyo debuted exclusively on the ShibaSwap DEX last month, and through various transactions, it has helped to reduce Shiba Inu\u2019s supply by 8.75 billion SHIB tokens.\n\nThe surge in the burn rate suggests that there is increasing demand for the token.\n\nEthereum Gets Ready for Shapella Upgrade\n\nEthereum (ETH), the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, is preparing for the highly anticipated Shapella upgrade.\n\nThe impending software upgrade of Ethereum dubbed the Shanghai or Shapella upgrade, is poised to cause a significant shift in the ecosystem as Ether holders prepare for what they believe will be a major shake-up. This upgrade marks the biggest change to the blockchain\u2019s protocol since the \u201cMerge\u201d in 2020.\n\nThe upgrade, which brings a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism to Ethereum, will allow Ether holders to earn rewards by staking their tokens. However, since users have been unable to retrieve their staked Ether since December 2020, many are eagerly anticipating the implementation of the Shanghai upgrade, which will finally allow them to withdraw their staked Ether.\n\nThe anticipated withdrawal of staked Ether is expected to lead to a massive reshuffle in the ecosystem, as users switch between service providers or move to stake on their own. Analysts predict that within the first five days after the Shanghai upgrade, users will withdraw 1.2 million Ether, valued at nearly $2.3 billion. This massive withdrawal is expected to be followed by a flurry of re-staking activity as users seek out new service providers.\n\nRenQ Finance Raises $10 Million Weeks Faster Than Experts Predicted\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ), a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, has successfully raised $10 million in its presale stage, weeks faster than experts predicted.

        "title": "What Is zkEVM? The Zero-Knowledge Proof's Role in Smart Contracts - Decrypt",
        "content": "In brief Rollups are a scaling solution that can lower transaction costs and increase throughput on a blockchain protocol.\n\nRollups are a popular Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum.\n\nA zkEVM is a new type of zk-Rollup that is EVM compatible.\n\nThe first two zkEVM options were released in March 2023. More zkEVM alternatives are in development (at the time of writing).\n\nYour Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\ntl;dr (Don't worry if you don't understand, a full explainer follows): A zkEVM is an EMV-compatible rollup that is secured by a ZKP. Zero-Knowledge Rollups (zk-Rollups) are a type of rollup that uses Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs). A ZKP is a cryptographic proof that verifies the transaction data within a zk-Rollup is accurate.\n\nThe ZKP in a zk-Rollup enhances both the privacy and security of a rollup as this proof verifies the transactions in it \u2014 no trust or \u201coptimism\u201d is required. It is called \u201czero-knowledge\u201d in the sense that you can verify the truth of all the data and transactions in a zk-Rollup \u2014 without needing to know the details of every transaction contained within it.\n\nBackground on zkEVMs\n\nIn order to understand zkEVMs, we need to go back a few blocks and explain this dense portmanteau of acronyms (zk-Rollups and EVMs). The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the computing environment of the Ethereum blockchain. The EVM could be thought of as a decentralized virtual computer; this is why Ethereum is sometimes referred to as \u201cthe global supercomputer.\u201d The EVM is where smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) on Ethereum interact with each other. Ethereum\u2019s EVM is one of the core protocol features that has made it a pillar of the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nWhat do rollups do?\n\nRollups bundle transactions in order to improve a blockchain\u2019s throughput (data or transaction processing capability over a specific time frame) while lowering transaction costs at the same time. In essence, a rollup \u201crolls up\u201d (combines) a number of transactions from a Layer-1 protocol (a blockchain like Ethereum) and executes them off-chain (not on the primary blockchain) using a Layer-2 protocol such as a sidechain or an EVM-compatible blockchain.\n\nSome rollups are \u201coptimistic,\u201d meaning they are assuming (optimistically) that all the transactions in a rollup are valid and not fraudulent. For this reason, there is a period (typically several days) where one can challenge the validity of a transaction. Examples of Optimistic Rollup (ORs) for Ethereum include Optimism, Arbitrum, and Boba Network. While ORs significantly lower costs and increase transaction throughput, faulty transactions can get through if they are not challenged in a timely manner.\n\nPopular zk-Rollup solutions include dYdX and Loopring. While these have security advantages, zk-Rollups tend to be a little more computationally expensive than ORs.\n\nComparing these two Ethereum rollup types, they both have some downsides. While ORs tend to be EVM compatible, they come with some concerns about fraud and security. While zk-Rollups tend to be praised for having better security, they generally can only used in specific transactions as they typically lack EVM compatibility; this means that zk-Rollups are limited to being used for bespoke processes that limit their adoption and use cases.\n\nFor these reasons, many have expressed the desire for a rollup that combines the best features of these alternatives into one solution; that solution is now here.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat are zkEVMs?\n\nA zkEVM is an EMV-compatible rollup that is secured by a ZKP. This gives it the enhanced functionality of some of the Optimistic Rollup solutions that are EVM-compatible while also giving it the security of earlier zk-Rollup options that didn\u2019t offer compatibility with Ethereum\u2019s EVM. These new zkEVMs allow for enhanced Ethereum process functionality (smart contracts and dApps) while also lowering gas costs and increasing Ethereum network throughput.\n\nWhy Ethereum Needs zkEVMs\n\nEthereum as a blockchain has suffered at times from high transaction fees and transaction confirmation delays. Further, the Ethereum blockchain itself can not natively process more than approximately 30 transactions per second (TPS). Each rollup solution can increase transaction throughput by up to 2,000 TPS \u2014 or more. While Ethereum\u2019s recent upgrade (called The Merge) will increase scalability, many expect Layer-2 scaling solutions such as rollups to remain popular for some time in order to ameliorate Ethereum transaction congestion issues. Scalability is one major benefit of zkEVMs.\n\nWhile scalability had already been enhanced via earlier rollup iterations, zkEVMs combine this scalability with privacy, security, and enhanced interoperability. By combining ZKPs with EVM compatibility, zkEVMs keep the security and privacy-preserving features of zk-Rollups \u2014 while enhancing Ethereum interoperability by preserving EVM compatibility. This allows zkEVMs to be interoperable with smart contracts and dApps used on Ethereum. Further, these zkEVMs should also work on EVM-compatible blockchains such as Avalanche, Solana, and Fantom.\n\nLike other rollup solutions, zkEVMs significantly lower transaction costs. At the time of writing, Ethereum transaction costs were approximately $0.90/transaction (when converted to USD). As zkEVMs can process hundreds \u2014 or thousands \u2014 of transactions in a batch off-chain, this transaction cost can be split amongst all the transactions in a rollup by simply verifying the proof of the rollup on Ethereum in a single transaction. This can lower the cost per transaction to less than $0.01 for simple solitary transactions \u2014 and a bundle of around 100 transactions could be executed for less than $0.10 worth of crypto.\n\nAnother big benefit of zkEVMs is their interoperability. Existing smart contracts and dApps can easily be migrated to a zkEVM to take advantage of rollup benefits \u2014 without requiring any coding changes. And because zkEVMs are verified on Ethereum just like other rollups, they have largely the same level of security as the native Ethereum blockchain protocol.\n\nPolygon and zkSync\u2019s zkEVMs\n\nLaunched just days apart in late March 2023, the first two zkEMVs to be released to the public were from zkSync and Polygon (on March 24th and 27th, respectively). In development since 2019, zkSync\u2019s solution called zkSync Era went live to much fanfare and is the first zkEVM to be publicly available. The Polygon zkEVM is open source and Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin was given the privilege of sending the first transaction following its public release.\n\nBoth options already have long lists of crypto projects that have indicated they plan to use one \u2014 or both \u2014 of these zkEVM solutions. It should be noted that while these zkEVMs have undergone significant security testing, both teams have cautioned that these are early versions that should initially be used carefully. Like the first iterations of other blockchain breakthroughs, they may go through some developmental growing pains and security upgrades over the coming years.\n\nThe Future of zkEVMs on Ethereum\n\nWhile these are the first two zkEVMs to be available for public use, there are numerous other zkEVM projects in development with a public release on the horizon, including alternatives from Consensys, Scroll, and Taiko. While Ethereum continues to work towards on-chain scaling through future upgrades to its protocol, these upgrades can often be delayed significantly due to their requirements and technical complexity. Layer-2 solutions like zkEVMs are continuing to solve pain points for Ethereum as it continues its developmental goals of scalability, security, throughput, decentralization, and enhanced functionality.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "According to a new report by Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange platform, cryptocurrencies reduce international money transfer fees by 96% and speed up the transaction time by 99%. Apart from Bitcoin and Ethereum another new cryptocurrency name Signuptoken.com is also expected to play a vital role in lowering the cost of remittance fees in the future.\n\nCrypto Reduces Cross-Border Remittance Fees\n\nSending out hard-earned money to beloved ones across the oceans gives many expatriates a sense of satisfaction. The IMF data shows that about one billion people in the world depend on cross-border remittances. But, a recent research by Coinbase has shown that people around the world spend up to $48 billion on commissions just to transfer money. US citizens alone spend $12 billion annually on fees for cross-border transactions. In the United States, the fees for international money transfer range from 5.5%-10.8%. And the transaction time for a traditional money transfer can take from 1-10 days.\n\nBut according to Coinbase\u2019s research, cryptocurrencies reduce the cost of sending money internationally by 96.7% compared to the current system. And it only takes 10 minutes to process the transaction compared to the traditional money transfer system. The average fee for sending Bitcoin(BTC) to another wallet costs just $1.50 regardless of the transfer amount. Similarly, Ethereum(ETH) costs an average of 0.75% per transaction. Hence, sending money in Bitcoin(BTC), Ethereum(ETC) or any other crypto makes the cross-border transaction nearly 97% cheaper and 99% faster than the traditional transfer method.\n\nSignuptoken.com: The People\u2019s Crypto\n\nSignuptoken.com is a new cryptocurrency built on the Ethereum blockchain. The project team aims to simplify crypto investment and provide efficient crypto services by incorporating new technologies.\n\nTo achieve its first aim, Signuptoken.com has skipped the presale stage. The project team has set a target of receiving one million email signups from potential investors. As no fee is charged for the signup process, crypto enthusiasts are more interested in it.\n\nPeople who want to invest in Signuptoken.com can visit the official website and signup with their mail id for free. Once registered, users will be added to Signuptoken.com\u2019s millionaire club.\n\nThe token will be launched after reaching one million sign-ups. The project team will notify the registered users about the launch by mail. Therefore, registered users will get early access to buy tokens on the Uniswap crypto exchange platform.\n\nSignuptoken.com is also looking to make a great impact in the remittance industry. With its innovative platform, Signuptoken.com aims to provide a seamless and cost-effective way for individuals and businesses to send money across borders.\n\nThe benefits of using Signuptoken.com for cross-border transactions go beyond just cost savings. It can offer greater transparency and security than traditional money transfer services, ensuring that funds reach their intended destination without any issues.\n\nAccording to a research report by Accenture, about 20% of the world\u2019s population owns some form of crypto assets. This rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) has opened up new possibilities for crypto-based remittance services. By leveraging the power of DeFi protocols, these services can offer even lower fees and faster transaction times, making them even more attractive to users.\n\nGet Started with Signuptoken.com:\n\nWebsite: https://www.signuptoken.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_SignUpToken_\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/SignUpTok\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Blockchain security firm BlockSec has launched the Phalcon Fork toolkit for collaborative testing on private chains forked from the Ethereum mainnet. The toolkit provides more control for developers over testing, analysis, and debugging of transactions, while retaining services and states from the Ethereum mainnet. It also includes an integrated faucet for free fork network Ether (ETH) and Fork RPC for integration with Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible development frameworks.\n\nIn a bid to improve collaborative testing on private chains, blockchain security technology firm BlockSec has launched the Phalcon Fork toolkit. This new toolkit provides more control to developers and security researchers who are working on testnets, ensuring that testing, analysis, and debugging of transactions can be done more efficiently.\n\nThe Phalcon Fork allows for the forking of arbitrary transaction positions and block numbers on the Ethereum mainnet, giving users greater control over the work being done on testnets. This allows developers to easily test, analyze, and debug transactions, providing a more streamlined testing process. Additionally, Phalcon Fork provides developers with more control over block information such as Timestamp, BaseFee, and MixDigest, while also retaining services and states from the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nOne of the key features of the Phalcon Fork is the integrated faucet, which provides free fork network Ether (ETH) to execute transactions on private chains. This makes it easier for developers to test their DeFi contracts on private chains, without having to worry about transaction fees. Additionally, Phalcon Fork provides Fork RPC, a remote procedure call node that can be integrated with Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible development frameworks such as Hardhat, Foundry, and Remix or added to MetaMask.\n\nAt present, users can only fork from the Ethereum mainnet. However, BlockSec has hinted at future support for additional blockchains such as the BNB Smart Chain and Arbitrum. This will allow developers to test their DeFi contracts on a wider range of blockchains, providing more flexibility in their testing processes.\n\nThe launch of Phalcon Fork follows the successful deployment of the Shapella hard fork on the Ethereum mainnet, which went live on April 12. This upgrade has enabled Ethereum validators to withdraw staked ETH from the Beacon Chain, resulting in a positive price action for Ether (ETH). Since April 12, Ether has gained roughly 12% and is currently sitting at $2,092 at the time of writing.\n\nIn conclusion, the Phalcon Fork provides developers and security researchers with more control over testing, analysis, and debugging of transactions on private chains forked from the Ethereum mainnet. It offers an integrated faucet for free fork network Ether (ETH) and Fork RPC for integration with Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible development frameworks. With future support for additional blockchains on the horizon, the Phalcon Fork provides greater flexibility in the testing process for developers of DeFi contracts."

Potential interest rate hike contributed to the same. Shiba Inu saw a price increase following the launch of the beta version of its Layer 2 network. On WazirX, Cartesi and Celer Network tokens have been the top gainers. Cartesi has introduced a set of new features on its network such as mainnet for Web3 dApps and new initiatives for developer communities across the world.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin said, \u201cBitcoin is trading sideways between $29,800 and $30,500, while an upside move above $30,500 could lead to another resistance area of \u200b\u200b$30,700 or $31,000. Ethereum hit a one-year high of $2,123.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, \u201cIn a rare development, Ethereum outperformed Bitcoin after witnessing a jump of over 13 percent in the last 24 hours and trading at $2,100.57 level. BTC, on the other hand, is holding strong above the $30,000 mark with a jump of 5.98 percent during the same period.

        "content": "In an interesting revelation, a blog post by the technologist Andy Baio on the 5th of April unearthed that the original white paper of Bitcoin (BTC) was embedded in every modern version of Apple\u2019s macOS operating system. The cryptocurrency industry is always searching for signs of relevance and importance, so when assessing cryptos like Ethereum (ETH) or Dogetti (DETI), it poses the question of what this means and if it means anything at all.\n\nCryptocurrency\u2019s quest for mainstream acceptance remains an enduring struggle for the industry. But the news that Bitcoin\u2019s white paper has been lurking in plain sight on the operating systems of Apple could be the pendulum-swinger as far as the industry is concerned. Bitcoin is a well-established name but for the rest of the industry, could this mean a growing acceptance? Does Apple\u2019s inclusion of Bitcoin\u2019s white paper signal good things in the future for Ethereum, a widely used coin for its fantastic blockchain technology, or Dogetti (DETI), a new meme-based cryptocurrency that is garnering attention?\n\nBitcoin Found In Every Modern Version Of Apple\u2019s Mac OS\n\nOn the 5th of April, Andy Baio found the original white paper for Bitcoin\u2019s network that had been authored by Satoshi Nakamoto. Baio said that a PDF version of the BTC white paper was included in every copy of MacOS since the release of Mojave in 2018. It was the strangest and most accidental of discoveries as Baio had been attempting to fix his printer and scan a document using a wireless scanner.\n\nBaio used the information to find the file\u2019s location and create easier access to the white paper for others. Baio claimed that the white paper could be found on every version of macOS from Mojave to the current version but not anything that preceded Mojave. He speculated that it might have been included for testing purposes and not end-users.\n\nWhat Does This Mean For Cryptocurrency?\n\nThe temptation to frame this as an endorsement of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by Apple is understandable. It would be a seismic affirmation of cryptocurrency\u2019s importance but this is not necessarily the case. The Bitcoin white paper is available online and has been widely circulated for a long time. Its location within macOS will not necessarily have much of a practical impact such as major price surges.\n\nWhat Are The Upsides Of It?\n\nApple\u2019s inclusion of the Bitcoin white paper, however, does highlight a growing mainstream recognition of cryptocurrency. The inclusion of Bitcoin\u2019s white paper in Apple might not result in much practically immediately for crypto investors, but it does highlight that their industry is increasingly gaining a foothold in key sectors.\n\nIn the future, could we see crypto like Dogetti (DETI) attaining a similar level of mainstream acceptance? It\u2019s possible that it could happen as cryptocurrency gains popularity. Dogetti (DETI) is a meme coin, a popular subcategory within cryptocurrency, that is a decentralised platform belonging to those who hold its DETI tokens. Basing itself on being run as a family, which it evokes through hilarious mafia literature, Dogetti (DETI) could be one of those that benefit from the growing popularity of cryptocurrency.\n\nFor More Information On Dogetti, See Below:\n\nDogetti (DETI)\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

Some of the top crypto presales include Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Ark (ARK) and Alias (ALIAS). Dogetti (DETI) is a new meme coin that\u2019s joining these ranks with one of the most impressive crypto presales ever.\n\nPresale can be the best time to invest, as coins are usually offered below market value, and investors can make a substantial return on their investments. Read on to find out more about these top crypto presales!\n\nNew Meme Coin Dogetti Makes an Impact\n\nDogetti (DETI) is a brand new meme coin approaching the end of its presale. It has already made a big impression in the crypto market and it is set to rival other meme coins.

        "content": "According to the latest crypto news, analysts are moving towards Collateral Network (COLT), Ethereum (ETH) and Enjin Coin (ENJ), as they see them as investments with the best potential.\n\nHowever, Collateral Network (COLT) outshines both Ethereum (ETH) and Enjin Coin (ENJ) even at stage 2 of its public presale, with predictions of incredible gains of 3500%.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCollateral Network (COLT)\n\nAs crypto tides turn, investors remain confident that Collateral Network (COLT) is the best new crypto project on the market. COLT offers huge real-world utility and is set to revolutionize the crowdlending industry forever.\n\nWith Collateral Network (COLT), users can use physical assets to unlock liquidity. Those assets can include real estate, luxury items, watches, vintage cars, etc. Collateral Network (COLT) will use the real-world assets mentioned and mint NFTs that represent them which are 100% asset-backed, allowing lenders to finance the loans by buying a fraction of the fractionalized NFT.\n\nFor example, a person can put their luxury watch as collateral for a loan. Collateral Network (COLT) will then get the watch from that person and turn it into an NFT and sell it in fractions. Then, lenders can buy fractions of the NFT to earn interest. Once the borrower repays the loan, COLT will burn the NFT and redeem the watch from its vault.\n\nAt the moment, Collateral Network (COLT) is in stage 2 of its public presale. Even so, experts believe it is on the path to seeing a 3500% growth, which will bring 35x gains to all Collateral Network (COLT) holders.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nWith the Shanghai update around the corner, investors have been moving around the Ethereum (ETH) space with extreme caution. Ethereum (ETH) investors and analysts anticipate increased volatility in the coin as soon as the Ethereum (ETH) Shanghai update is live.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum (ETH) is sitting at $1,874.08 for one token, a 2.35% decrease in the last 24 hours. In addition, the Ethereum (ETH) market cap is also down by 2.22% over the previous 24 hours, along with the trading volume of Ethereum (ETH), which is down by 14.53%.\n\nSo, at this moment, Ethereum (ETH) investors are decreasing their trades, expecting that prices will continue to go down.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEnjin Coin (ENJ)\n\nEnjin Coin (ENJ) is facing some mixed feelings from investors at the moment, with some believing that the token will face a bullish market and anticipate increases in the Enjin Coin (ENJ) prices. On the other hand, other Enjin Coin (ENJ) investors are predicting a further decrease in the prices and trading volume of the Enjin Coin (ENJ) token.\n\nAt the moment, Enjin Coin (ENJ) is priced at $0.4136 for one ENJ token, a 4.96% decrease in the past 24 hours. Consequently, the Enjin Coin (ENJ) market cap is also experiencing a decrease of 4.62% in the past 24 hours, while the Enjin Coin (ENJ) trading volume is down by 10.42% in the past 24 hours.\n\nLearn out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Major Ethereum upgrade goes live, and Twitter starts letting users trade stocks with eToro partnership\n\nData from CryptoCompare shows that Bitcoin\u2019s price moved significantly at the start of last week, from around $28,000 to a $31,000 high. The cryptocurrency\u2019s price has since corrected to $29,560.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, moved steadily up throughout the week, from around $1,850 to reach a $2,1000 high. The cryptocurrency is currently still trading close to that high, at $2,090.\n\nThis week, headlines in the cryptocurrency space were dominated by Ethereum\u2019s highly-anticipated Shapella upgrade, which successfully went live on the cryptocurrency\u2019s mainnet. The upgrade allows for the withdrawal of locked staked ETH, and completes the network\u2019s transition to a Proof-of-Stake system.\n\nThe upgrade has positively impacted the network\u2019s native token Ether. Its major feature was Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4895, which brought in staked Ether withdrawals. Along with the withdrawal mechanism, Shapella improved the network\u2019s gas fees for some transactions, as the core team had explained on GitHub before.\n\nStaked ETH can now be withdrawn in two ways: partial and full. Partial withdrawals keep the validators running by automatically distributing the ETH to them, so they have the required 32 ETH balance. Full withdrawals stop the validator and take out the whole staked amount.\n\nEthereum\u2019s upgrade dominated headlines in a week in which it was revealed that last month, the United States experienced its lowest inflation rate in almost two years, as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) declined to 5%, down from 9.1% in June.\n\nDuring the week, Twitter partnered with social trading platform eToro to allow its users to access stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other financial assets. The new feature lets users access these assets through Twitter\u2019s \u201ccashtags\u201d feature, which already gives them real-time trading data access.\n\nThe collaboration adds an option to click a button labeled \u201cview on eToro\u201d that directs them to eToro\u2019s site for buying and selling assets.\n\nNEWS: Twitter partners with eToro to let users trade stocks, crypto. pic.twitter.com/DHvrp6hhqF \u2014 T(w)itter Daily News \uea00 (@TitterDaily) April 13, 2023\n\nCrypto made another significant step on social media over the week, after the price of Bitcoin started appearing in search results on Douyin, China\u2019s equivalent of TikTok. This could indicate that Beijing is becoming more friendly to crypto and easing its grip on the digital asset space.\n\nDouyin is the most popular short video-sharing app in China, with 700 million people using it every day. The app shows the cryptocurrency price at a time in which Hong Kong started opening its door to crypto and China\u2019s state-owned banks.\n\nBitfinex secures El Salvador\u2019s first digital asset service provider license\n\nWhile cryptocurrencies have been gaining more traction on social media, El Salvador inaugural digital asset service provider license has been granted to popular cryptocurrency trading platform Bitfinex.\n\nThe move follows the January legislation passed by the country\u2019s Legislative Assembly creating a framework for El Salvador to launch Bitcoin-backed \u201cVolcano Bonds.\u201d In September 2021, under President Nayib Bukele\u2019s leadership, El Salvador became the first country to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender.\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s acceptance comes when Binance.US is having trouble finding a new banking partner to enable fiat transactions for its customers in the country. The exchange lost its banking services with the recent collapse Silvergate and Signature Bank, and now relies on intermediary banks to hold funds for it.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bank of England is reportedly looking to establish a team of up to 30 experts to develop a central bank digital currency (CBDC). In February, the UK\u2019s central bank and finance ministry declared their intention to undertake further research and development on a digital version of the pound sterling and called on the public to offer input on the initiative.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Montenegro\u2019s Central Bank announced a collaboration with fintech company Ripple to explore the feasibility of creating a digital currency for the nation. Montenegro has used the euro as its currency since its introduction in 2022, even though it\u2019s not a part of the Eurozone.\n\nFTX\u2019s legal bills show progress\n\nOver the week, legal bills have revealed that collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, under the leadership of newly appointed CEO John J Ray III, is contemplating reviving the trading platform to recover for its customers and creditors. Legal bills show progress on that task.\n\nWith the assistance of legal counsel from the prestigious law firm Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, FTX is examining the tax implications, cybersecurity concerns, and user experience aspects associated with a potential relaunch. The firm\u2019s February invoice for these exploratory efforts totaled $13.5 million.\n\nFrancisco Memoria is a content creator at CryptoCompare who\u2019s in love with technology and focuses on helping people see the value digital currencies have.

        "content": "The Ethereum staking process, which involves validators locking up a specific amount of Ether (ETH) to support the network\u2019s security and earn rewards, has come under scrutiny for its potential IP address privacy issues. Stakeholders in the Ethereum network have raised concerns that the requirement for validators to connect via an Ethereum client exposes their IP addresses, which could reveal their location and identity and pose a security risk.\n\nEthereum staking explained\n\nStaking generally entails securing a certain quantity of cryptocurrency or tokens as collateral to participate in a network and receive rewards. The level of anonymity and privacy for stakers depends on the staking mechanism and platform being used. In some instances, staking necessitates the use of a public IP address, which could disclose the staker\u2019s location and other identifying information. This raises concerns for those who prioritize privacy and wish to remain anonymous while staking.\n\nNumerous staking platforms and protocols implement measures to protect user privacy. Some employ techniques such as onion routing or encryption to obscure the staker\u2019s IP address and maintain anonymity. Additionally, certain platforms enable the use of VPNs or other privacy-oriented tools to enhance anonymity further.\n\nEthereum staking requires validators to hold a specific amount of ETH in a designated wallet to support the network\u2019s security and earn rewards. Validators are responsible for verifying transactions, proposing new blocks, and securing the network by locking up a minimum amount of ETH as collateral. While Ethereum staking provides numerous benefits to the network, it has raised concerns about IP address privacy.\n\nEvery computer participating in the Ethereum network must have a unique IP address to facilitate communication between nodes. Validators must connect to the network and perform their duties using an Ethereum client, such as Prysm, Lighthouse, or Teku. These clients utilize the validator\u2019s IP address to communicate with the network and exchange information.\n\nPrivacy at stake\n\nIP addresses, while crucial for network communication, can reveal the location and identity of the validator. Hackers or malicious actors could exploit IP addresses to launch attacks or gain unauthorized access to a validator\u2019s system. Additionally, governments or law enforcement agencies could use IP addresses to locate validators involved in illegal activities.\n\nRecent criticisms focus on Ethereum (ETH), which underwent a hard fork not long ago. An Ethereum Foundation researcher disclosed that ETH stakers\u2019 IP addresses are monitored as part of a broader metadata set, sparking privacy concerns. Consequently, individuals must research and understand the privacy implications of any staking platform or protocol they are considering using to mitigate these risks."
