        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nProto-danksharding is going to completely change Ethereum\u2014and for the better, says core developer Mario Havel.\n\nAt ETH Barcelona over the weekend, Havel told Decrypt that the next big Ethereum upgrade, dubbed \"Dencun,\" is nearing the \"final stages of planning.\" The upgrade will do many things, but one of the major changes is the introduction of the proto-danksharding feature, which will allow the network to scale and handle up to 100,000 transaction per second, devs say.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the focus right now is on the implementation of EIP-4844, also known as proto-danksharding,\u201d Havel explained. According to the core developer, EIP-4844 sets the foundation for data sharding through the introduction of a new transaction type\u2014the oddly named \u201cdata blob.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlob blocks also introduce what\u2019s called a KZG commitment. The name stands for Kate-Zaverucha-Goldberg, the names of the original authors who came up with it.\n\nAccording to Havel, the KZG commitment will point to certain \u201cblobs\u201d of information. That's helpful for layer-2 scaling solutions, like Optimism and Arbitrum, because they batch transactions together in what are known as \"rollups\" and currently have issues accessing data needed to verify those transactions.\n\nThe easier it is for a rollup to access the data it needs, the faster and cheaper the transactions can be verified and reported back to the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nAccording to Carl Beekhuizen and Trent van Epps, two members of the Ethereum Foundation who are working on proto-danksharding, the blobs set the foundation for data sharding.\n\nOn the Epicenter Podcast earlier this year, they clarified the idea, saying that instead of having multiple simultaneous sidechains, there is only one chain but with \u201ccrazy\u201d amounts of information.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe data can then get split up on the one chain, allowing for individual stakers or smaller sized machines to be responsible only for a sliver of that large amount of information. And, says Havel, that data will only be stored for a few weeks at a time.\n\nKZG commitments are at the end of their \u201cKZG summoning ceremony,\u201d or a \u201cmulti party computation ceremony,\u201d said Havel, which calls upon the community to help with the scaling effort.\n\nHavel also explained that blobs will only store data for a limited amount of time, and will never touch the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the environment where all smart contracts live and interact with one another, nor the Ethereum state directly.\n\n\u201cInstead, they will create a KZG commitment, which will allow us to handle data much more efficiently and in a much cheaper way,\u201d he explained, given the fact that blobs are small enough that they make disk use manageable.\n\nHavel explained that blobs will only store data for a limited amount of time, and will never touch the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). \u201cWe will be able to handle data much more efficiently, and in a cheaper way as well,\u201d he concluded.\n\nAdditional reporting by Rodrigo Martinez."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nVitalik Buterin highlights the pros and cons between Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nEthereum co-founder highlights both BTC and ETH\u2019s \u201ccore commitments to values\u201d during Twitter Space.\n\nButerin also notes that Bitcoin and Ethereum don\u2019t execute privacy very well.\n\nVitalik Buterin highlighted fundamental differences between the core design of Bitcoin and its smart contract pioneering predecessor Ethereum having trade-offs during a widely-tuned-into Twitter Space on July 6 .\n\nButerin, who co-founded Ethereum alongside eight other influential cryptocurrency developers, spoke at length with Bitcoin advocates Eric Wall and Udi Wertheimer about the technical and cultural nuances of either protocol.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re definitely different experiments in terms of the culture and unavoidable trade offs that they\u2019re making and that\u2019s something that I\u2019ve only really come to realize over time.\u201d\n\nButerin believes there is great value in Bitcoin and Ethereum continuing to co-exist, while admitting he had separated the technical and cultural aspects as best he could\n\n\u201cWhen I was starting with Ethereum I was looking at them as a kind of technical\n\nsystems and cultural systems somewhat separately. I had my beliefs on culture, that maximalism is crazy.\u201d\n\nButerin said he had focused on taking a system from Bitcoin, which was fairly basic, and creating a more programmable system that mirrors \u201chow computers evolved\u201d.\n\nFundamental System Choices\n\nWith technological and cultural aspects intermingled in the development of both Bitcoin and Ethereum, Buterin highlighted the inevitable trade-offs of these systems.\n\n\u201cThere are points at which you have to make certain choices. Like if you make a system that supports more functionality, then any kind of functionality that you support ends up having risks, right?\n\nButerin said that extensive functionality requires protocol complexity, but functionality itself can introduce risks to a blockchain system.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an example of something that we saw during the last few years.\u201d\n\nProof-of-Work vs Proof-of-Stake\n\nEthereum, which originally employed Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work consensus algorithm, shifted to proof-of-stake consensus in 2022 during the highly anticipated Merge.\n\nThe change in its core consensus protocol saw stakers introduced as the new \u2018miners\u2019 of the network. Staking 32 ETH is required to be a validator, which then receives rewards for processing transactions and maintaining the network.\n\nThe change also caused a split within the Ethereum community as Buterin highlighted, referring to the Ethereum DAO fork of 2016 which caused a fork in the chain, leaving ETH as we know it today and Ethereum Classic (ETC) as two separate chains.\n\n\u201cA lot of the people who were in favor of a more purist approach toward immutability ended up\n\ngoing to Ethereum Classic and people who are much stronger proof of work proponents.\u201d\n\nValuable Experiments\n\nButerin believes that many of the \u201csubtle choices\u201d made by both protocols in terms of functionality end up providing value and continue to co exist.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just like a lot of these subtle choices that both platforms have made that like really go beyond the question of being general purpose or not trying to be general purpose?\u201d\n\nHighlighting a plethora of differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum which ended up in either protocols \u201cchoosing different trade offs\u201d down the line.\n\n\u201cThe result of all this is that we have these two different experiments that seem to me to be valuable. I\u2019m happy that they\u2019re both continuing to exist.\u201d\n\nButerin added that both protocols can also be considered \u201cmore honorable\u201d than \u201coverinflated\u201d scams that the cryptocurrency space has been littered with over the years.\n\n\u201cI do think that there is a kind of core commitment to values in there that I think is valuable for the space to actually provide something that matters to people.\u201d\n\nAnother central theme emphasized by Buterin was the need for blockchain to move beyond its current limitations by prioritizing scalability:\n\n\u201cWe need to find ways to scale up blockchain systems to handle a larger number of transactions without sacrificing security or decentralization.\u201d\n\nThis sentiment echoes the growing consensus within the industry, as developers and innovators strive to enhance the capabilities of blockchain networks."

        "content": "Coin Bureau host Guy Turner is listing two catalysts that could potentially trigger a bullish run for Ethereum (ETH).\n\nIn a new video, Turner tells Coin Bureau\u2019s 2.28 million subscribers that two upcoming milestones could send \u201ccould send ETH\u2019s price higher.\u201d\n\nAccording to Turner, one of the milestones is the proto-danksharding upgrade.\n\n\u201cThe biggest upcoming milestone for Ethereum is the EIP-4844 upgrade which is colloquially referred to as proto-danksharding. The reason why proto-dank sharding is a big deal is because it will basically allow Ethereum to reach a level of scalability that\u2019s comparable with centralized computer systems. This will be achieved by addressing Ethereum\u2019s main bottleneck to scalability which is data availability\u2026\n\nProto-danksharding solves this by making it possible for special blobs of data to exist on the Ethereum blockchain. These blobs make transaction data more readily available which should increase Ethereum scalability, lower its fees and increase transaction speeds on its layer-2s.\u201d\n\nThe Coin Bureau host further says that the second upcoming milestone for Ethereum is an effort to enhance privacy.\n\n\u201cBesides proto-danksharding, Ethereum developers have apparently been hyper-focused on privacy.\n\nBack in January, [Ethereum creator] Vitalik [Buterin] penned a blog post where he referred to privacy as \u2018one of the largest remaining challenges\u2019 in the Ethereum ecosystem and proposed stealth addresses as one solution.\n\nIn April, privacy on Ethereum came into the spotlight again because of supposed privacy concerns related to ETH staking.\n\nJust last month, Vitalik penned another blog post where he noted privacy as being one of the \u2018three transitions that Ethereum must implement or else it will fail.\u2019\n\nThe sudden focus on privacy is not all that surprising when you realize that institutional investors want privacy more than anyone else. And remember that the Shappella upgrade has increased institutional interest in ETH.\u201d\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nIn a recent video, Guy Turner, the host of Coin Bureau, has captivated the attention of Coin Bureau\u2019s 2.28 million subscribers by unveiling two key catalysts that could potentially ignite a powerful bullish run for Ethereum (ETH). These upcoming milestones hold the promise of driving ETH\u2019s price to new heights.\n\nProto-dank sharding upgrade\n\nThe first milestone highlighted by Turner is the eagerly anticipated proto-dank sharding upgrade, officially known as EIP-4844. This groundbreaking upgrade seeks to address Ethereum\u2019s long-standing scalability challenge, allowing the network to achieve a level of scalability comparable to centralized computer systems.\n\nBy tackling Ethereum\u2019s primary bottleneck\u2014data availability\u2014proto-dank sharding introduces special blobs of data that enhance transaction data accessibility. This boost in scalability is expected to result in lower fees, faster transaction speeds on layer-2 solutions, and an overall improvement in Ethereum\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cThe biggest upcoming milestone for Ethereum is the EIP-4844 upgrade\u201d\n\nEnhancing Privacy, Post ETH Staking?\n\nTurner then turns the spotlight to Ethereum\u2019s renewed focus on privacy, marking it as the second significant milestone. Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin has openly acknowledged privacy as one of the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s major challenges. To tackle this issue, Ethereum developers have been diligently exploring solutions, such as the implementation of stealth addresses.\n\nThe recent attention to privacy has been further intensified by the Shappella upgrade, which has sparked increased interest from institutional investors. Recognizing the growing demand for privacy from these investors, Ethereum aims to deliver enhanced privacy features that align with their requirements.\n\nWith these two powerful catalysts on the horizon, Ethereum\u2019s potential for a remarkable price surge is gaining momentum. As Ethereum continues to address critical challenges and push the boundaries of innovation, investors and enthusiasts eagerly anticipate the impact these developments will have on the cryptocurrency\u2019s value."

        "content": "Ether has been on a downward trend, with the $2,000 level forming a crucial resistance level in recent months.\n\nWhile Bitcoin (BTC) recorded 11.94% gains, moving past $30,000 in June after BlackRock filed an application for an exchange-traded fund with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States, the upside in Ether (ETH) stayed around 3.16%.\n\nIn the first week of July, buyers attempted to move the price past crucial resistance at around $1,900. However, a failed breakout exposed the price to further correction.\n\nThe Ethereum network also witnessed a decline in activity, evident in the one-year-low levels in total transaction fees. The price of leading nonfungible token (NFT) collections on Ethereum plummeted, while decentralized finance (DeFi) activity stalled due to low yields.\n\nThe 7-day moving average of total transaction fees paid on Ethereum.

Source: Glassnode\n\nThe total ETH deposited in staking contracts is 19.7% compared to the centralized exchange balance of around 12.8%. LSD platforms captured most of the inflow, followed by independent validators and staking-as-a-service clients.\n\nEther staking deposits increased significantly after the Shanghai upgrade in April, as confidence increased with active redemptions. Among LSD platforms, Lido led the sector, followed by Rocket Pool and Frax.\n\nThe weekly inflows of ETH staking deposits by category.

Glassnode\u2019s analysts wrote, \u201cThis leveraged staking position is estimated to amplify yield by 3x.\u201d\n\nThe LSD sector appears to be the current hotspot for DeFi players looking to maximize their yield.\n\nRelated: Rapid growth in DeFi-focused Ethereum liquid staking derivatives platforms raises eyebrows\n\nEther price analysis\n\nETH recorded a positive breakout from a bullish ascending channel pattern with a target of $3,000 earlier this week. However, the trend reversed quickly, as Bitcoin dropped to $30,000 after expectations of a rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve rose and sellers gained an upper hand.\n\nTechnically, the price can take two paths from here: find support at the base of the ascending triangle around $1,790 before making a break for the $1,900 resistance level again, or a continued drop toward the long-term resistance and support level of $1,700.\n\nA breakdown below $1,700 would give sellers a chance to target the 200-day weekly moving average at around $1,575.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart.

Source: TradingView\n\nEther had a failed positive breakout in early July, exposing the price to further downside to around $1,700.

        "content": "VICTORIA, Seychelles and MUMBAI, India, July 8, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Bitget , top crypto derivatives and copy trading platform , has entered the rapidly expanding cryptocurrency loan sector with the launch of its native Crypto Loans product. The new offering is intended to attract a new audience of users dissuaded by traditional credit institutions and seeking alternative means of funding via digital assets.\n\nBitget Launches Crypto Loans For Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and more as a Lending Services\n\nBitget's Crypto Loans product is based on a dual-coin approach, allowing users to stake one coin from their holdings as collateral in exchange for the ability to borrow a corresponding amount in another coin. Each loan is issued at a specific interest rate to pay, with the borrowed amount determined by the market value of the staked collateral. The loans are issued within a predetermined period, users can choose to repay before or at the predetermined deadline.\n\nCrypto loans have been gaining attention in recent years thanks to the overall growth of the digital lending sector, which surpassed the $8.5 billion mark in 2022 and is predicted to grow by a CAGR of 20.5% from 2023 to 2032. The report by Global Market Insights highlights the increasing reliance on traditional lending and its potential to drive the demand for digital lending products. As this trend continues, the smooth onboarding of traditional users will play a crucial role in the adoption of these solutions.\n\nWith this in mind, Bitget has streamlined the loan process to not only facilitate user onboarding but also replicate the familiar procedures found in traditional financial institutions. The first step involves staking collateral, followed by the automatic disbursement of the loan amount, ensuring a user-friendly and efficient experience for borrowers. After the loan has been received, users will have the flexibility to utilize the funds as needed, as well as adjust the collateral by adding or withdrawing based on their circumstances or individual requirements.\n\n\"Bitget's new product highlights the flexibility of collateralized currency usage, enhancing capital utilization.

        "title": "Why Ethereum saw 580,000 new addresses in one week - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum has seen over 580,000 new addresses in the past week.\n\nETH price recovered with less than a 1% increase in price.\n\nThe Ethereum [ETH] merge revolutionized the platform by introducing staking, sparking intense discussions throughout the chain. While this groundbreaking event garnered much attention, there\u2019s another metric steadily ascending in the background, silently shaping the future trajectory of ETH with great potential impact.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nEthereum new addresses surge\n\nAmidst the focus on Ethereum\u2019s staking and price trends, it\u2019s easy to overlook other crucial metrics. However, recent Santiment data sheds light on a quietly surging aspect: the network\u2019s remarkable growth.\n\nThe data indicated a consistent influx of new users joining the network, signaling potential market cap expansion.\n\nA closer examination of the chart revealed that over 580,000 new addresses were created between 1 July and 7 July alone. This remarkable surge further highlighted the underlying strength and promising trajectory of ETH.\n\nETH on exchanges decline\n\nAccording to the latest data from Coin Market Cap, Ethereum held an impressive 19% of the total cryptocurrency market cap. With this, it secured its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency, surpassed only by Bitcoin [BTC], which claimed over 49%. Despite ETH\u2019s market dominance, ETH holders actively withdrew their holdings from exchanges.\n\nSantiment\u2019s chart revealed that the supply of Ethereum on exchanges, relative to the total supply, stood at a mere 9.1%. This suggested that less than 10% of all ETH remained on exchanges, while the majority had been moved to other storage methods.\n\nFurther analysis of the chart revealed that approximately 11.3 million ETH was being held on exchanges at press time, indicating a visible decline. This withdrawal trend underscored the growing preference among Ethereum holders for alternative storage solutions.\n\nAlso, it reflected their confidence in the long-term value of their holdings.\n\nEthereum price declines as TVL dominates\n\nAccording to data from DefiLlama, Ethereum maintained its position as the leading blockchain in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL), compared to other chains. As of this writing, the total TVL across all chains was $44 billion, with Ethereum commanding over $26 billion.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nThis meant that Ethereum held more than half of the entire TVL in the market, showcasing its dominant presence in decentralized finance.\n\nHowever, ETH has experienced a recent decline. Nevertheless, there were signs of a potential recovery as of this writing. Ethereum was trading at approximately $1,864, showing a modest increase of almost 1% from its previous value."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTron Founder Justin Sun is in the headlines today after his latest on-chain transaction was brought to life. According to insights shared by crypto sleuth Lookonchain, Justin Sun transferred a total of 23,000 ETH worth approximately $43 million to Poloniex. While the purpose of the transfer remains unknown, there has been growing speculation from crypto Twitter.\n\nPotential reasons for funds movement\n\nJustin Sun owns the Poloniex exchange and, as a crypto founder with many top Web3.0 companies in his portfolio, the recent funds movement, which is not uncommon with him, can mean a lot of things. First, Justin Sun may set his eyes on gradual liquidation to take advantage of the recent bouts of price surges that Ethereum has experienced over the past few months.\n\nAccording to an extensive review of the associated wallet address, it was discovered that Justin Sun is a functional trader in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem, partaking in a series of staking activities from which he earns regular rewards. As a platform that supports staking, part of the reason for moving the funds to Poloniex might be to also stake it there as he has a record of doing this.\n\nAnother plausible reason is to cushion liquidity on the Poloniex exchange. With Justin Sun's direct oversight on the trading platform, ensuring there is enough liquidity to fulfill all customers' orders is essential, and this funds movement can be directed to this purpose.\n\nJustifiable fears?\n\nJustin Sun is undeniably a market whale with large holdings of different digital currencies beyond Ethereum. While the recent moves with respect to the Ethereum transfer have sparked fear of a possible sell-off, the fear of a sell-off might be unjustified.\n\nThis is because the total sum of the funds might not make a dent in the Ethereum market, which boasts a market capitalization of over $224 billion. Should Justin Sun choose to sell off the quoted ETH tokens, the impact on the market may not be as grievous as is being projected."

        "content": "Justin Sun, the renowned crypto entrepreneur and founder of Tron Blockchain, has once again made waves in the cryptocurrency world with a substantial transfer of Ethereum (ETH) tokens. In a recent transaction, reported by Lookonchain, Sun transferred a staggering 23,000 ETH, equivalent to approximately $43 million, to the popular cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex.\n\nJustin Sun ETH Transfer\n\nThe transfer of 23,000 ETH, worth $43 million, adds to Justin Sun\u2018s impressive track record of moving large amounts of Ethereum to Poloniex. Sun\u2019s ETH balance currently stands at 163.35 ETH, held in the wallet address 0x3DdfA8eC3052539b6C9549F12cEA2C295cfF5296.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn addition to the recent transfer of 23,000 ETH to Poloniex, it is worth highlighting some previous notable transfers made by Justin Sun. One significant transaction occurred in December when Sun sent 6,500 ethers to the same exchange. Coincidentally, following this transfer, the price of Ethereum experienced a drop from $1,350 to approximately $1,151 in the subsequent days.\n\nAnother substantial transfer took place on January 25th of this year when Sun moved another 10,000 units of ETH to Poloniex. Over the past year, he has sent a total of 67,500 ETH, amounting to a whopping $126 million, in seven separate transactions.\n\nAlso Read: Liquidity Crunch Hits Crypto, Bitcoin and Ethereum Face Buy-Side Decline\n\nWill it Impact Eth Price?\n\nSun\u2019s transfer may be part of a routine derisking strategy as a long-term holder. Such strategies involve diversifying one\u2019s holdings or reducing exposure to a specific asset. Moreover, it is possible that Sun\u2019s transfer to Poloniex serves a dual purpose, providing liquidity to the exchange while also supporting its operations during a period of decreased liquidity in exchanges.\n\nThis transfer comes on the heels of Justin Sun\u2019s withdrawal of $29.7 million worth of ETH from the liquid staking platform Lido Finance last month. Following the withdrawal, Sun promptly sent the tokens to Huobi, another prominent crypto exchange.\n\nIn addition to his involvement with Ethereum, Sun has recently made headlines with the announcement of Tron\u2019s foray into the Ethereum blockchain through the innovative BitTorrent bridge. At the press time, the price of Ethereum (ETH) is $1,861.62. The 24-hour low and high for Ethereum are $1,854.06 and $1,876.96, respectively."

        "content": "Polygon spin-off Avail unveiled its data attestation bridge to Ethereum, Friday, as it seeks to carve out a niche in Ethereum\u2019s rollup-centric scaling roadmap.\n\nLayer-2 rollups currently use Ethereum mainnet for posting their transaction data, which represents the majority of the transaction cost to users. These costs are expected to come down significantly following the next Ethereum upgrade \u201cDencun\u201d later this year, which will implement EIP-4844.\n\nFurther scaling gains should be found higher up the stack, on layer-3 networks envisioned such as Arbitrum Orbit, or zkSync\u2019s hyperchains. That\u2019s where Avail\u2019s solution will likely come in, Anurag Arjun, Avail\u2019s co-founder, told Blockworks in an interview.\n\n\u201cWith computation with something like [zero-knowledge proofs], you are able to compress proofs, you\u2019re able to do recursive proofs and make it small, but with data, you cannot do it,\u201d Arjun said.\n\nRight now, some early attempts make use of what are known as data availability committees (DACs), but in the future Avail or Celestia could provide a better alternative because they use a technique known as data availability sampling (DAS). Ethereum\u2019s own implementation of DAS is still likely years away.\n\n\u201cBy enabling rollup constructions to run in validium, optimistic chains, and volition modes, we are not only reducing costs but also paving the way for a more inclusive and efficient layer-2 and layer-3 ecosystem,\u201d Arjun said in a statement.\n\nThere are some trade-offs in terms of security, but for the kinds of use cases that are most likely to require layer-3s, the cost, performance, and privacy concerns will make off-chain data availability options worth it, according to zkSync co-founder Alex Gluchowski.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very cheap, but you only have a partial inheritance of Ethereum security,\u201d Gluchowski said.\n\nAvail opted to become an independent company outside of the Polygon product suite so that it could service all kinds of rollups, not only those from Polygon.\n\n\u201cWe wanted it to be more credibly neutral in that aspect because Avail is a general purpose base layer,\u201d Arjun told Blockworks.\n\nThe transition, completed about three months ago, saw Arjun leave his operational role at Polygon, which will now be one customer of many for the new firm.\n\nPolygon\u2019s PoS chain, which Polygon recently announced would morph into a zkEVM validium, will initially make use of its own validator set to provide data availability, but it could also use Avail in the future, Arjun said.\n\nAvail is built using Polkadot\u2019s Substrate technology due to its use of nominated proof-of-stake (nPOS) and tendency to facilitate wide distribution of stake.\n\nArjun observed from his experience with Tendermint consensus used by the Polygon PoS chain that there is a concentration of stake with a majority controlled by eight to 10 validators.\n\nA new staking token, AVAIL, will facilitate a permissionless validator set of up to 1,000 validators.\n\nOther than that, there is no connection to the Polkadot ecosystem. They may be able to help Polkadot build zk rollups on a Polkadot parachain using Avail, Arjun said, but this idea is very new and will require a lot of further development.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Discover SCENE\n\nSix months after launching a protocol that lets people mint NFT-like media assets on the Bitcoin blockchain, the Ordinals space is rapidly evolving. Not only are new products springing up one after another, but the Ordinals-based BRC-20 tokens are now expanding onto none other than Ethereum, the dominant NFT and token ecosystem.\n\nTwo of the largest BRC-20 tokens on the market, ORDI and OXBT, have partnered with Emblem\u2014a tool that lets users store tokens across blockchains without need for a bridge\u2014to release BRC-20 Curated Collections.\n\n\u201cThis should be considered a day in which BRC-20s began exploring what their asset class is,\u201d said Jake Gallen, who is in charge of NFT strategy and product at Emblem.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u2b1b\ufe0f\ud83d\udfe7 $ORDI and $OXBT MEGATHREAD \ud83d\udfe7\u2b1b\ufe0f \ud83d\ude80 VAULTING IS NOW LIVE \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\udd38 How to Mint\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Where to Trade\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Vaulting Mechanics\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Details, Info, Integrations, and Partnerships pic.twitter.com/AANoZjTVxs \u2014 Emblem Vault (@EmblemVault) July 6, 2023\n\nBRC-20 tokens use the Ordinals protocol to generate what are effectively fungible tokens built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Broadly, they\u2019ve been used thus far to create a wide variety of meme tokens, with the total market cap of all BRC-20s briefly nearing $1 billion in May before falling sharply since.\n\nGallen told Decrypt that the BRC-20 Curated Collections are important \u201cbecause we can now test what type of asset BRC-20s are most closely related to.\u201d He\u2019s looking forward to \u201chow the community views them,\u201d and whether they want to trade them like fungible tokens \u201cor want some variety.\u201d\n\nHe teamed with Adam McBride, colleague and self-proclaimed NFT archaeologist, to share a video deep dive earlier this week about the collection launch. An official launch was pegged for next week, but the functionality is already live and the resulting NFTs are being traded on the OpenSea and Blur marketplaces.\n\nAccording to McBride, the innovation at play with the new partnership is to sidestep traditional cross-chain bridges. He explained that \u201cbefore, users would send their BRC-20s to a Bitcoin wallet, which then would mint new ERC-20s on Ethereum.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEmblem\u2019s solution, created in-house, is to create specialized vaults. Before Ordinals, Emblem vaults were used to transfer digital artwork minted on other Bitcoin-related protocols (like Counterparty) over to Ethereum, where they were newly minted as ERC-721 NFTs. The Rare Pepe collection is a prominent example.\n\nIn this case, with Ordinals-based BRC-20 tokens, users send their ORDI or OXBT to a vault which stores the private keys and holds the tokens. Then, using a single ERC-721 token, users will mint their Bitcoin-based NFT on Ethereum.\n\nIn essence, \u201cthe BRC-20 sits inside a Taproot wallet, which sits inside an NFT,\u201d said Gallen, explaining that \u201cthe NFT (which is an ERC-721 token) is the one doing all the traveling.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m super excited to see how the Ethereum marketplace will react to this,\u201d said McBride. \u201cThis will bring a level of ownership which is far more superior than what already exists, unlocking a bunch of use cases like farming, lending, and other stuff that is built out on Ethereum smart contracts.\u201d\n\nThe creator of BRC-20s and ORDI in particular, pseudonymous on-chain data enthusiast Domo, did not reply to a request for comment. According to Gallen, however, Domo \u201cis really excited to get to show his creation to Ethereum,\u201d adding that \u201cgetting those tokens to OpenSea and Blur is huge.\u201d\n\nGallen told Decrypt that the Emblem team has interacted more with ORDI builders than holders, whereas they are in direct contact with the OXBT community\u2014led by the pseudonymous BitGod\u2014since it is more ETH-native, \"so the interest in ETH-denominated trading is much higher.\"\n\nNonetheless, Gallen said that Emblem\u2019s team \u201cbelieves Bitcoin can equal or overtake Ethereum in NFT trading volume, but with its own culture and style.\u201d"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nNoted cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen recently shared a cryptic chart that has sparked debate among his followers. The chart, which appears to be a reverse representation of the Ethereum (ETH) to Bitcoin (BTC) pair, has left followers pondering its significance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the Twitter post, Cowen, well-known for his incisive crypto analyses, did not explicitly mention the chart's name. However, he posed a simple question to his followers: \"Is this bullish or bearish?\" The enigmatic chart and the question have since provoked considerable speculation within the community.\n\nThe crux of the debate revolves around the interpretation of the ETH/BTC chart. A bullish ETH/BTC chart implies that Ethereum's value is set to appreciate against Bitcoin. In contrast, a bearish chart suggests that Bitcoin will outperform Ethereum. In the broader perspective, a bullish ETH/BTC chart could also be indicative of an impending surge of volatility on the crypto market.\n\nOver the past weeks, the ETH/BTC chart has shown a downward trend, which could indicate that Bitcoin has been outperforming Ethereum in the crypto race. However, this trend seems to be flattening out, which could potentially suggest a changing dynamic between the two leading cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile the intention behind Cowen's post remains a mystery, it has undeniably succeeded in generating discussion and speculation among crypto enthusiasts. The ETH/BTC pair has long been viewed as an important metric in the crypto space, providing insight into the relative performance of the two largest cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn case of a breakthrough on ETH/BTC, we might see a surge of volatility on the cryptocurrency market, especially in the DeFi and NFT sectors. For now, however, the performance of the crypto market remains suppressed."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nEchoing last week, the values of market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum remained pretty inert over the past seven days.\n\nNonetheless, market leader Bitcoin (BTC) hit a one-year high after crossing the $31,000 threshold on Monday on news that the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, was refiling its application to the SEC for a Bitcoin spot ETF\u2014a regulated investment vehicle that, if approved, would provide investors with exposure to Bitcoin without the dangers of buying it directly.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe SEC expressed misgivings about BlackRock\u2019s first filing last month, stating broadly that none of the many applicants for a Bitcoin spot ETF have been specific enough about how they'll integrate a \"surveillance-sharing agreement\" to deter fraud and manipulation. Such an agreement would allow applicants to monitor market trading activity and clearing activity and verify customer identity.\n\nBlackRock named Coinbase as its market surveillance partner in its refiling. Two days later, the crypto-focused asset manager Valkyrie also refiled its ETF application and, echoing BlackRock, it named Coinbase as its market surveillance partner.\n\nIn another bullish sign for Bitcoin fans, the crypto ATM operator Bitcoin Depot became the first company of its kind to be publicly listed on the NASDAQ on Monday.\n\nHowever, the headlines weren\u2019t enough to turn Bitcoin\u2019s upward price movement into a sustained rally. The biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization dropped back under $31,000 on Tuesday, then briefly recrossed the threshold early on Thursday before bottoming out at $30,153.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s volatility settled down by the weekend. It currently changes hands at $30,252\u2014about one percent lower than it was this time last week.\n\nEthereum (ETH) holders suffered marginally greater losses. The second biggest cryptocurrency in the world dropped in value 2.8% to enter the weekend at $1,861. It moved in step with Bitcoin, posting intraweek highs of close to $2,000 on Monday and Thursday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe prices of most of the top thirty cryptocurrencies remained flat over the last seven days. The biggest growth was observed in Solana (SOL), which exploded 20% to hit $22.85 by Saturday, up nearly 20% for the week.\n\nRemarkably, Solana thrived in spite of news that popular trading app Revolut is delisting it\u2014along with Polygon (MATIC) and Cardano (ADA)\u2014after they were named as securities by the SEC in its ongoing lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase.\n\nBig losses were felt by holders of Litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). The former dropped 11% to $98, while the latter dropped 12.5% to $19.06.\n\nEthereum forked from Ethereum Classic in 2016 after an infamous DAO smart contract hack enabled thieves to abscond with $55 million in ETH. The Ethereum community voted to have the illicit transactions wiped from the blockchain and continued under the name Ethereum. The original ledger recording these transactions continued as Ethereum Classic.\n\nRegulation in Asia and the UK\n\nOn Monday, Singapore announced two new consumer protection measures as the island nation\u2019s regulators continued to build a regulatory framework for its burgeoning crypto industry.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)\u2014the country\u2019s chief financial regulator\u2014will enforce a ban on lending and staking for retail customers (individual traders, as opposed to institutional clients).\n\nThe MAS now also requires that exchanges move customers\u2019 digital assets into a trust before the end of the year to prevent an FTX-style scenario where their funds are commingled or traded.\n\nCoincidentally, Thailand\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission also announced a ban on \u201cdepository services that offer returns to depositors and lenders,\u201d thus outright banning exchanges from offering both lending and staking services.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn the other side of the globe on Tuesday, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for the United Kingdom announced that companies promoting cryptocurrencies to UK customers must get ready to comply with the regulator\u2019s financial promotion regime before October 8, 2023.\n\nThe rules govern all communications that can be regarded as \u201cfinancial promotion,\u201d including websites, social media posts, mobile apps, and online advertising. Crypto companies will need to register with the FCA to get authorization and, if approved, they\u2019ll also need to pay a fee."

        "content": "The advent of Bitcoin (BTC) Ordinals signals the \u201corganic return of builder culture\u201d to the network, according to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nButerin made the comments in a July 7 Twitter Space where he spoke at length with Bitcoin proponents Eric Wall and Udi Wertheimer about what Bitcoin developers could learn from Ethereum devs.\n\nButerin praised Ordinals and the BRC-20 token standard, which he sees as a rejection of \u201cstagnant\u201d politics in the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\n\u201cOrdinals are starting to bring back a culture of actually doing things. It feels like there's real pushback to the laser-eye movement, which is good,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nThe nearly two-hour-long conversation centered around the issue of scalability. Wall claimed that Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network can\u2019t scale for future users and fails \u201cfrequently\u201d when processing \u201ceven medium-sized payments.\u201d\n\nIn response, Buterin suggested the best approach would be to focus on implementing different types of layer-2 solutions and look for ways to make the Bitcoin base layer more efficient.\n\n\u201cI think focusing on rollups is good, and so is being open to ZK-snark-based scaling solutions.\u201d\n\nWertheimer believed the introduction of zero-knowledge rollups could create an interesting side effect.\n\n\u201cIf we adopted rollups for Bitcoin, we actually get an execution environment too [\u2026] We can do smart contracts,\u201d Wertheimer said.\n\nWall and Wertheimer \u2014 two key figures behind the Ordinals project Taproot Wizards \u2014 are outspoken exponents of Ordinals and routinely advocate for building increased functionality on top of the Bitcoin network.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin miners raked $184M in fees in Q2, surpassing all of 2022\n\nTheir stance has drawn criticism from more fundamentalist Bitcoiners who claim NFTs and smart contracts on Bitcoin dilute its supposed primary function as a peer-to-peer cash network.\n\nSuch critics include Jan3 CEO Samson Mow, who believes Ordinals waste block space that could otherwise be dedicated to Bitcoin payments.\n\nWall noted these criticisms and explained that Bitcoin could be used as a \u201cproof system\u201d for zero-knowledge proofs, which wouldn\u2019t congest the network.\n\n\u201cMy perspective is that we [Bitcoiners] always wanted to do DeFi adjacent things, but we just wanted the Bitcoin base layer to just act as sort of a judge or an arbiter of that computation and not have to run the computation on-chain,\u201d Wall said.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t necessarily just be thinking about second layers as a way to make payments, but I think we could also think about them [as a way of doing] expressive things.\u201d\n\nThe discussion yielded fresh controversy in the Bitcoin community, with Wertheimer slamming Mow and Blockstream CEO Adam Beck for being dismissive of the conversation with Buterin.\n\nThese 2 laser-eye clowns have been running blockstream into the ground for the last decade\n\n\n\nIn 10 years that company couldn\u2019t come up with a single successful product\n\n\n\nTheir joke of a blockchain processes 3 txs a day\n\n\n\nAnd they think they have nothing to learn from ethereum pic.twitter.com/mp7we9Lvxq \u2014 Udi Wertheimer (@udiWertheimer) July 6, 2023\n\nMagazine: Ordinals turned Bitcoin into a worse version of Ethereum: Can we fix it?"

        "content": "The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on July 7 released nonfarm payrolls (NFP) and unemployment rate data for June. The NFP came in at 209K for June, below market forecasts of 225K. It is the lowest reading since December 2020, but remains more than twice the 70k-100k needed per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The nonfarm payrolls came in at 306k last month.\n\nMeanwhile, the unemployment rate came in line with market expectations at 3.6% but decreased as compared to May\u2019s seven-month high of 3.7%. The jobs data indicate an anticipated economic slowdown in the U.S., while the Federal Reserve can continue raising interest rates to combat inflation.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhile the US dollar index (DXY) fell below 102.75, which signals the crypto market will rise and Bitcoin could regain above $31k, the tight labor market is bearish for the economy. Also, job creation is positive, but reliance on government jobs for 28% of additions suggests a lack of robust private sector growth. This comes after the strong ADP Employment data showed 497,000 new jobs in June.\n\nOverall, the macro outlook remains challenging for Bitcoin, with treasury yields rising rapidly and volatility returning to the crypto and stock markets. The CME FedWatch tool indicates a nearly 90% probability of a 25 bps rate hike during the July FOMC meeting.\n\nKeep in mind +209k jobs is still a good (not great) number, but the re-acceleration in nominal wage growth, flat LFPR, and falling unemployment rate represent a RESILIENT AND DYNAMIC LABOR MARKET. \u2014 Caleb Franzen (@CalebFranzen) July 7, 2023\n\nAlso Read: Professor Edward Kim Unveils Terra Luna Classic\u2019s AI Chain \u201cBlock Entropy\u201d\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum Prices Rise\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum prices are increasing due to the US dollar weakness after the recent jobs reports.

        "content": "Assets worth more than $65 million have been deposited on Starknet.\n\nStarknet still suffered with poor transaction throughput.\n\nLaunched in 2021, Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] layer-2 solution (L2) Starknet has grabbed a lot of eyeballs in the first half of 2023. Though still in its infancy, the zero-knowledge rollup (zk-rollup) witnessed significant activity.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nDeposits on the rise\n\nAccording to blockchain analytics firm Nansen, more than 500,000 wallets have bridged over to Starknet, depositing assets worth more than $65 million. As evident from the graph below, ETH was the most bridged asset, equating to nearly 75% of the total value bridged (TVB).\n\nUsers port their assets to take advantage of the speed and cost-effectiveness of a L2 technology. The StarkGate bridge is used to port assets in the case of Starknet. Each supported token is associated with an L1 and L2 bridge contract that communicates via Starknet\u2019s messaging mechanism.\n\nStarkware, the firm which developed Starknet, has set limitations involving the deposit amount and total value locked in the L1 bridge contract. An increase in deposit caps in mid-March resulted in the sharp jump in deposits. As of this writing, ETH had the maximum cap of 80,000 among all assets.\n\nNansen also emphasized the age breakdown of depositing wallets, shedding light on some intriguing aspects of Starknet\u2019s demand. As revealed below, nearly 75% of these wallets were created in the last one year, with a significant 41% being in the age-band of 3-12 months. This indicated that Starknet\u2019s demand was driven by newer market participants.\n\nStill early days\n\nWhen compared with other L2 solutions, Starknet was still in its nascent stage. According to a Dune dashboard, deposits on Starknet were still considerably less as compared to established players like Arbitrum [ARB] and Optimism [OP] and even trailed the recently launched zk-rollup zkSync Era.\n\nOne reason behind the poor growth rate could be the low transactions processed per second (TPS). Data from Dune highlighted that while Ethereum mainnet handled 11 TPS on average, the number of transactions on Starknet was less than one, a significant low for a rollup.\n\nHowever, Starknet was looking to address this issue through the upcoming version 0.12.0. The upgrade is expected to reduce block execution time, thus significantly improving throughput and latency."

In it, the lead developer Diyahir Campos proposed a standard for a DeFi \u201ccircuit breaker.\u201d It essentially aims to set a standard for a smart contract that can halt suspiciously large token outflows from a DeFi protocol.\n\n1/ Announcing ERC 7265: Circuit Breaker\n\n\n\nWe are fixing the biggest problem with DeFi Security - lack of response time to mitigate hacks.\n\n\n\nBuilt by @Diyahir @tcb_00 @real_philogyhttps://t.co/4KQDYEK2H7 \u2014 Meir Bank (@MeirBank) July 3, 2023\n\nLast year was the single biggest year for crypto hacks, with at least $3.1 billion stolen from DeFi protocols \u2014 and cross-chain bridges accounted for 65% of that.\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Campos said circuit breakers could have prevented billions in losses.\n\n\u201cThe ones that weren\u2019t rugs, you could probably save 70% of the money [...] with minimal impact to users.\u201d\n\nCampos revealed he was one of the many that lost funds in the $195 million Euler Finance attack in March, which led to contagion impacting 11 other protocols.\n\n\u201cActually, I was one of the depositors in the Euler hack,\u201d he said.\n\n3/ Our data analysis shows that DeFi Guardian could have saved more than 50% of losses from the recent @eulerfinance hack.\n\n\n\nInstead of draining the entire TVL of Euler within moments, the Euler hacker would have been rate limited, saving tens of millions of dollars for users. pic.twitter.com/Nuck06iQIo \u2014 Meir Bank (@MeirBank) June 1, 2023\n\n\u201cFrom that experience, I\u2019m looking at the TVL [total value locked] charts and the transactions that happened, and really it begged the question:\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would you ever let 100% of your TVL leave in 10 seconds or five blocks?\u201d\n\nA typical DeFi protocol would see around 20% of total value locked entering or leaving a project in a day.\n\n\u201cOnce you start talking 30% or 40%, that's when you really start separating exploits versus daily usage,\u201d said Campos.\n\nThe proposed standard has not been without controversy. DeFi researcher Chris Blec was among the skeptics on Twitter concerned the circuit breaker could be used for potentially nefarious purposes.\n\nOh dear Lord. What is this nonsense?\n\n\n\nGiving DeFi devs a protocol-level method that allows them to freeze your money forever?\n\n\n\nWHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG???\n\n\n\n(h/t @DefiantNews) pic.twitter.com/RofYYv9Nud \u2014 Chris Blec (@ChrisBlec) July 6, 2023\n\nCampos said the circuit breaker isn\u2019t suitable for every DeFi protocol and doesn\u2019t guarantee a protocol is safe. He noted the circuit breaker would be an \u201copt-in thing\u201d for DeFi projects.\n\nHe also believes that a well-designed circuit breaker must strike a balance between protecting users and preventing \u201cfalse positives,\u201d as it would be extremely disruptive whenever the breaker trips.\n\nRelated: Multichain MPC bridge sees $100M+ outflows, sparking fears of exploit\n\nHowever, a circuit breaker would be useless in cases of internal rug pulls, as it could simply be deactivated by the team controlling the protocol.\n\nA quick exploration of the power of circuit breakers in DeFi and their limitations in preventing costly hacks https://t.co/bZKeWJyUkI \u2014 Diyahir (@Diyahir) June 27, 2023\n\nCampos is a smart contract developer at Hydrogen Labs. He said work began on the proposed standard during an April hackathon in Tokyo alongside Meir Banks, the co-founder of Hydrogen Labs.\n\nThe idea for the DeFi circuit breaker was inspired by similar circuit breakers that have been used by global stock exchanges for decades.\n\n\u201cIn DeFi, we aren\u2019t trying to calm the markets, which is the intention of the [New York Stock Exchange\u2019s circuit breaker] rather we want to prevent hack losses,\u201d wrote Campos in a June 27 blog post.\n\nOther developers working on the standard include Philippe Dumonet, founder and CEO of DeReg and Blagoj Dimovski, co-founder and former chief technology officer of Diagonal Fiance.\n\nCampos said the standard is still being shaped at this stage, but is confident it will be ready \u201cwithin months,\u201d which would put it in \u201ca really good stage\u201d to be integrated into protocols.\n\nMagazine: Should you \u2018orange pill\u2019 children?

        "title": "Polygon spinoff launches testnet bridge to allow for low-cost layer 2s - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Blockchain network Avail has launched a testnet data availability bridge to Ethereum, according to a July 7 announcement. Once testing is completed, the bridge will allow developers to easily create \u201cvalidiums\u201d or low-cost layer 2s that do not store full transaction data on Ethereum, the announcement stated.\n\nAvail was originally created by Polygon Labs, but was spun off as an independent project in March. Polygon\u2019s co-founder, Anurag Arjun, is also the founder of Avail.\n\nAvail Block Explorer. Source: Avail.tools\n\nLayer-2 rollup networks like Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon zkEVM, and zkSync Era lower transaction fees by batching transactions into compressed \u201crollups\u201d and periodically adding them to the base layer. However, because these networks must write all the transactions to the base layer, they often have higher transaction fees than layer-1 competitors.\n\nTo get around this problem, some networks have opted to write only the validation proofs of each transaction to the base layer, while storing the full transaction data off-chain. This produces a type of network called a \u201cvalidium.\u201d For example, StarkEx features a validium mode that stores data with a data availability committee (DAC) instead of on Ethereum. Polygon proof-of-stake may become a validium that stores its data on a proof-of-stake chain in 2024.\n\nRelated: Starknet\u2019s Quantum Leap hits testnet with TPS reaching \u2018triple figures\u2019\n\nAccording to the announcement, the new bridge allows developers to create custom validiums quickly and easily by storing their transaction data on the Avail network, eliminating the need to create their own DAC or proof-of-stake data availability network. When a user tries to withdraw cryptocurrency from layer 2 back to the base layer of Ethereum, the Avail bridge will transmit an attestation that the data is available on Avail, allowing the withdrawal to occur.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s launch of the Data Availability attestation bridge marks a major advancement in our mission to optimize blockchain scalability and efficiency,\u201d said Arjun. \u201cBy enabling rollup constructions to run in validium, optimistic chains, and volition modes, we are not only reducing costs but also paving the way for a more inclusive and efficient layer-2 and layer-3 ecosystem.\u201d\n\nArjun previously told Cointelegraph that data availability solutions would become essential to the Web3 space as zero-knowledge proof rollups are more widely used."

        "title": "How to Take Advantage of Ethereum Flippening Bitcoin in the Next Bullrun - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is filled with excitement and speculation as investors and enthusiasts eagerly await the next bull run. Within this context, the concept of \u201cFlippening\u201d has garnered significant attention. The Flippening refers to the hypothetical event in which Ethereum (ETH) surpasses Bitcoin (BTC) as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin have long been the pillars of the crypto world, capturing the imagination and investments of millions. While Bitcoin has held its dominant position since its inception, Ethereum has been steadily gaining ground, fueled by its unique features and expanding ecosystem.\n\nIn June 2017, Ethereum experienced its highest level of dominance in the crypto market, reaching 25.32%. This period coincided with the golden age of initial coin offerings (ICOs) when numerous projects launched altcoins on the Ethereum protocol.\n\nOn June 12, 2017, the market capitalization of ETH was nearly 84% of that of Bitcoin (BTC), with just $7.16 billion separating the two, as per TradingView data. Currently, that figure stands at approximately 38%, indicating a significant change in the relative market positions of ETH and BTC. A dominance level above 100% suggests a \u201cflippening,\u201d where ETH surpasses BTC in market capitalization.\n\nFlippening Metrics\n\nFlippening metrics refer to indicators used to analyze the potential shift in dominance between Ethereum and Bitcoin, specifically regarding market capitalization and other relevant factors. While market capitalization is the primary metric used to gauge the Flippening, several other metrics provide insights into this phenomenon.\n\nActive addresses\n\nActive addresses represent the unique addresses involved in sending or receiving transactions within a specific period. However, due to differences in address usage patterns between Ethereum and Bitcoin, this metric can disadvantage Ethereum, as users/ contracts frequently reuse their addresses.\n\nAccording to BlockchainCentre, the active address Flipenning is at 52%.\n\nTransaction count\n\nTransaction count is another crucial metric, measuring the total number of on-chain transactions on the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks. If Ethereum surpasses Bitcoin in this metric, it indicates a higher transaction activity. Ethereum has flipenned Bitcoin on the Transaction count metric.\n\nTransactions volume\n\nTransaction volume is the total value of USD transferred over the network, explicitly comparing Ethereum transfers with Bitcoin transfers. It\u2019s important to note that Ethereum\u2019s volume may exceed 100% when considering additional token transfers, as Ethereum supports a broader range of tokens. According to BlockchainCentre, the transaction volume flipenning is at 71%.\n\nTrading volume\n\nTrading volume reflects the adjusted exchange trading volume for Bitcoin and Ethereum, providing insights into the trading activity and liquidity of the cryptocurrencies. According to BlockchainCentre, the trading volume flipenning is 65%.\n\nTotal transaction fees\n\nTotal transaction fees represent the USD value of fees paid for conducting transactions on each network. A higher percentage for Ethereum suggests that it has surpassed Bitcoin regarding transaction fee generation. According to BlockchainCentre, Ethereum has flippened Bitcoin on the value of fees paid to conduct transactions.\n\nGoogle search interest\n\nGoogle search interest measures the relative popularity of \u201cBitcoin\u201d and \u201cEthereum\u201d in search queries on Google, reflecting each cryptocurrency\u2019s public interest and awareness.\n\nAccording to BlockchainCentre, the Google search interest flipenning metric is 13%.\n\nThese metrics collectively offer a comprehensive perspective on the potential Flippening between Ethereum and Bitcoin. However, it\u2019s essential to acknowledge that various factors, including technological advancements, adoption rates, regulatory changes, and investor sentiment, influence market dynamics and cryptocurrency performance.\n\nWhile Ethereum has demonstrated significant growth and dominance in certain areas, the Flippening would indicate Ethereum surpassing Bitcoin in market capitalization, marking a shift in prominence within the cryptocurrency market.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Strengths and Potential Catalysts\n\nEthereum is a formidable contender in the cryptocurrency market, driven by its unique strengths and potential catalysts that could propel it to surpass Bitcoin in the next bull run. Let\u2019s delve into the key strengths of Ethereum and explore the factors that could act as catalysts for its growth.\n\nSmart Contract Functionality and Versatility\n\nOne of Ethereum\u2019s greatest strengths lies in its smart contract functionality. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with predefined conditions written into code, allowing for the automation and facilitation of transactions without intermediaries. This feature has revolutionized various industries, enabling the development of decentralized applications (DApps) and opening doors to new economic models.\n\nThe versatility of Ethereum\u2019s smart contract platform has led to the rapid growth of the DeFi ecosystem. DeFi applications built on Ethereum offer various financial services, including lending, borrowing, yield farming, and decentralized exchanges, providing users greater control over their assets and economic activities.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nEthereum\u2019s ecosystem has become a hotbed for innovation in DeFi and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). DeFi protocols built on Ethereum enable users to access financial services traditionally offered by centralized institutions but in a decentralized and permissionless manner. The exponential growth of the DeFi sector has attracted billions of dollars in value locked in these protocols, indicating the increasing adoption and utility of Ethereum. Liquidity in Ethereum contracts offers great utility/ functions like flash loans.\n\nSimilarly, NFTs have revolutionized digital ownership, allowing artists, creators, and collectors to tokenize and trade unique digital assets, from digital art and virtual real estate to in-game items and collectibles.\n\nWhat could kill Ethereum?\n\nTwo potential factors could pose risks to Ethereum: a core issue and an issue/exploit in an upgrade. Let\u2019s explore each of these factors in more detail:\n\nCore Issue\n\nA core issue is a fundamental problem or limitation within the Ethereum protocol. These issues could undermine the network\u2019s security, functionality, or usability, potentially leading to a loss of user confidence and adoption. Here are a few examples:\n\nSecurity Vulnerabilities: If critical security vulnerabilities are in Ethereum\u2019s core codebase, it could expose the network to attacks or exploits. These vulnerabilities might allow malicious actors to manipulate transactions, compromise user funds, or disrupt the operation of smart contracts.\n\nGovernance Challenges: Ethereum\u2019s governance model, which involves decision-making processes for protocol upgrades, can sometimes be a point of contention. If governance challenges arise and lead to significant conflicts or delays in implementing necessary improvements or upgrades, it could hinder Ethereum\u2019s progress and competitiveness.\n\nRegulatory and Legal Concerns: The evolving regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology can impact Ethereum\u2019s growth and adoption. Adverse regulatory actions or legal uncertainties could create barriers to entry for users and developers, potentially stifling innovation and causing reputational damage.\n\nIssue/Exploit in an Upgrade\n\nEthereum regularly undergoes upgrades to address existing challenges and introduce new features. While these upgrades aim to enhance the network, there is always a risk of issues or vulnerabilities emerging during the implementation process. Here are a few scenarios:\n\nSmart Contract Vulnerabilities: Ethereum\u2019s upgrades often involve changes to the smart contract functionality. A critical vulnerability in a widely used smart contract language or framework could result in the exploitation of contracts and the loss of user funds. Such incidents could erode trust in Ethereum and deter users and developers from utilizing the platform.\n\nNetwork Consensus Issues: Upgrades that involve changes to the consensus mechanism or network validation process carry inherent risks. If an upgrade introduces a flaw or vulnerability in the consensus algorithm, it could lead to network disruptions, consensus failures, or even chain splits. These events can undermine the integrity of the Ethereum network and fragment the community.\n\nIncompatibility or Implementation Errors: Upgrades often involve complex technical changes and require careful implementation. If errors occur during the upgrade process or if an upgrade is incompatible with existing contracts or infrastructure, it could lead to operational issues, service disruptions, or unintended consequences that negatively impact Ethereum\u2019s functionality.\n\nEthereum developers and the broader community employ rigorous testing, auditing, and peer review processes before implementing upgrades to mitigate these risks. Additionally, test networks like Ropsten, Rinkeby, and Goerli allow testing and identifying issues in a controlled environment before deploying upgrades on the Ethereum network.\n\nIt is important to note that while these risks exist, the Ethereum community actively works to address them through ongoing research, security practices, and collaboration. The decentralized nature of Ethereum allows for continuous improvement and adaptability to emerging challenges.\n\nWhat will it take for Ethereum to flip Bitcoin?\n\nFor Ethereum to flip Bitcoin and become the dominant cryptocurrency, Ethereum would need to surpass Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization, which is the total value of all coins in circulation. As of now, Bitcoin holds a significant lead in this metric. However, if Ethereum continues to experience significant growth, adoption, and sustained investor interest, it could close the gap over time.\n\nTo achieve this fete, Ethereum would have to excel in several areas, these include:\n\nNetwork Adoption and Usage: Ethereum\u2019s network must demonstrate higher adoption and usage levels than Bitcoin. This includes factors such as the number of active addresses, transaction count, transaction volume, and trading volume. If Ethereum consistently outperforms Bitcoin in these metrics, it could signal a shift in market preference towards Ethereum.\n\nTechnological Advancements: Ethereum\u2019s technological advancements, such as scalability solutions, improved transaction speeds, and lower fees, would need to provide a competitive edge over Bitcoin. Successful implementation of these upgrades could enhance Ethereum\u2019s attractiveness relative to Bitcoin.\n\nDeFi and Smart Contracts: Ethereum\u2019s position as the leading platform for DeFi and smart contracts provides a unique advantage. Continued growth and innovation in the DeFi space and developing compelling decentralized applications (dApps) and use cases could contribute to Ethereum\u2019s overall value proposition and potentially attract more users and investors.\n\nMarket Perception and Sentiment: Market sentiment plays a crucial role in cryptocurrency adoption and investment. Ethereum must maintain a positive perception among users, developers, investors, and the broader cryptocurrency community. This includes factors such as robust community support, favorable media coverage, regulatory clarity, and overall confidence in Ethereum\u2019s long-term viability.\n\nExternal Factors: It\u2019s important to consider external factors influencing the flippening. These factors include macroeconomic trends, regulatory developments, geopolitical events, technological breakthroughs, and competition from other cryptocurrencies. Ethereum must navigate these external dynamics effectively and demonstrate resilience and adaptability to emerge as the dominant cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum layer-1 competitors\n\nWhen considering layer-1 blockchains that have the potential to flip Bitcoin, it\u2019s important to note that Bitcoin\u2019s position as the leading cryptocurrency is well-established and challenging to surpass. However, several layer-1 blockchains have gained attention and could compete with Ethereum. Here are a few examples:\n\nCardano (ADA): Cardano is a blockchain platform that has gained attention for its scientific approach and commitment to peer-reviewed research. It utilizes a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to provide a secure and scalable infrastructure for developing decentralized applications.\n\nSolana (SOL): Solana is a high-performance blockchain for decentralized applications and crypto-assets. It combines proof-of-stake (PoS) and proof-of-history (PoH) mechanisms to achieve scalability and fast transaction speeds. Solana\u2019s architecture and growing ecosystem have attracted attention and positioned it as a potential challenger to Bitcoin.\n\nBinance Smart Chain (BSC): Binance Smart Chain is a blockchain platform developed by the popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance. It aims to provide a high-performance infrastructure for decentralized applications and token issuance. BSC\u2019s close integration with the Binance ecosystem and lower transaction fees than Ethereum have contributed to its rapid growth and popularity.\n\nPolkadot (DOT): Polkadot is a multi-chain platform enabling interoperability between blockchains. It offers a scalable and secure infrastructure for building decentralized applications and connecting various blockchain networks. With its focus on cross-chain communication and governance, Polkadot presents a unique value proposition and has gained attention as a potential challenger to Bitcoin.\n\nThe Open Network (TON): The Open Network (TON) is a blockchain project initially led by Telegram, aiming to create a decentralized platform for applications and fast transactions. Although Telegram exited the project in 2020, TON has seen subsequent developments and spin-offs, such as Free TON and Toncoin. These community-driven initiatives utilize the original TON codebase to explore the potential of decentralized applications and offer improved features such as encrypted messaging. While TON has undergone changes and separate entities have emerged, its core objective remains to provide a robust blockchain network for decentralized innovation and secure communication.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum\u2019s programmability and smart contract capabilities have made it the preferred platform for dApps and DeFi projects, fueling its impressive growth and adoption. The vibrant Ethereum ecosystem, coupled with constant development and upgrades, positions it as a strong contender to challenge Bitcoin\u2019s dominance.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin still holds a significant advantage in market capitalization, brand recognition, and widespread acceptance as a store of value. Bitcoin\u2019s limited supply and first-mover advantage have contributed to its status as digital gold and a haven asset during uncertain times.\n\nThe crypto market is notoriously volatile and influenced by a myriad of factors. Only time will tell how these two powerhouses will evolve and shape the future of digital finance."

        "title": "Top 5 Decentralized Applications on the Ethereum Blockchain - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "DApps is an application developed on a decentralized network and combines smart contracts as a front-end user interface. The first DApp was launched in April 2016 over the Ethereum blockchain. The concept is emerging as the future of technology with its potential to make secure monetary transactions.\n\nDApps simply add a layer of security that is not offered in the traditional banking system, boosting the popularity of the concept in the crypto market. There are around 2,800 DApps on the Ethereum blockchain. Here are some of the DApps that are going to build the effective future of the crypto market.\n\nUniswap V2\n\nUniswap V2 is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange introduced in 2018. It is a secondary iteration of Uniswap. The platform does not require the addition of Ethereum (ETH) as one of the crypto assets and offers users to directly swap between two ERC-20 tokens.\n\nCurrently, the DApp has around 2014 coins and 3125 trading pairs with a total volume of $94,259,304.84. The concept played a major part in reducing the number of transactions and offers a user-friendly transaction platform. Traders using the Uniswap V2 platform need to pay a transaction fee of 0.30%.\n\nOpenSea\n\nOpenSea is a platform used for bidding, buying, and selling NFTs considering smart contracts. It is a decentralized NFT marketplace for trading digital goods and is one of the largest marketplaces for NFTs. OpenSea was launched in December 2017 for trading NFTs over the Ethereum blockchain. The platform is best known for its close connectivity with modern games, socials, and artists offering a high level of security, user-friendly platform charges around 2.5% as a transaction fee. The platform\u2019s current value is around $3 Billion and has around 1 Million users at the moment.\n\nCompound\n\nCompound is another strong player in the crypto market that allows users to lend, borrow and earn over specific currencies. It is a DApp developed in September 2018 and operates over an Ethereum blockchain platform. Compound allows working with 14 different types of cryptocurrencies including ETH, Dai, USD Coin etc. The platform simply offers a range of earning options without any requirement for the trading fee which makes the platform unique from other DApps. The current price of the Compound is approximately $58.55 with a trading volume of $103,506,612.\n\nMakerDAO\n\nMakerDAO is one of the oldest projects on Decentralized Finance (DeFi) on Ethereum that allows individuals with ETH and Metamask wallets to take part in the trading of digital assets. The platform was launched in December 2017 with the purpose to allow users to trade and earn money. The current price of MakerDAO is $1,003.48 with a total trading volume of $116,960,267 and it is expected to increase shortly. MakerDAO offers smart contract audits, community governance, and multi-signature wallets that provide a secure and reliable platform to trade.\n\nSocios.com\n\nSocios.com is another powerful DApp that mainly empowers fans supporting clubs with tokens and rewards. The platform was developed by Alexandre Dreyfus in 2018 with the purpose to reward the fans for their loyalty. The DApp simply allows users to trade, buy and execute voting rights in their favorite team using cryptocurrency. Great rewards for loyalty and chances to win prizes make the platform unique from other DApps.\n\nConclusion\n\nDApps are digital applications running over a decentralized network and use digital assets as a means of payment. Socios.com, Compound, MakerDAO, OpenSea, and Uniswap V2 are some of the best DApps over Ethereum Blockchain."

        "content": "High-profile cryptocurrency founder Justin Sun drew attention today by making a significant transfer of Ethereum (ETH) coins. Data from the on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain reveals that Sun moved a staggering 23,000 ETH, equivalent to approximately $43 million, to Poloniex, a cryptocurrency exchange he owns.\n\nThis kind of substantial funds movement isn\u2019t out of character for Sun. As the founder of Tron and owner of multiple leading Web3.0 firms, he has his fingers in many pies in the crypto space. However, his recent movement of funds has led to speculations about its possible reasons.\n\nThere are speculations that Sun may be preparing to liquidate gradually, hoping to capitalize on Ethereum\u2019s recent price surge. An investigation of his associated wallet address reveals that Sun is an active participant in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem, frequently partaking in staking activities that yield regular rewards. Since Poloniex supports staking, this latest move might be a strategy to stake the funds on his platform.\n\nAn alternate possibility relates to liquidity management at Poloniex. As Sun has direct oversight of the trading platform, ensuring sufficient liquidity to meet all customer orders is a priority. This recent Ethereum transfer could bolster the platform\u2019s liquidity reserves.\n\nFear of sell-off: Is It justified?\n\nDespite these speculations, the fear of a massive sell-off spurred by Sun\u2019s recent move might be unjustified. Indeed, Sun holds a whale\u2019s share of various digital currencies, including Ethereum. However, even if he were to offload the entire 23,000 ETH, it might not significantly impact Ethereum\u2019s market, which boasts a market capitalization of over $224 billion. Consequently, the potential fallout from such a sell-off might not be as severe as some fear.\n\nAs Sun\u2019s significant Ethereum transfer has the crypto world buzzing, questions are being asked about whether it\u2019s a savvy market strategy or an attempt to manage liquidity on his exchange. Only time will tell."

        "title": "Who Owns the Most ETH? Meet the Key Players in Ethereum's Ecosystem - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "One intriguing aspect of Ethereum\u2018s ecosystem is who owns the most ETH. Understanding the ownership distribution of this digital asset can provide insights into the dynamics of Ethereum\u2019s economy and the influence wielded by different individuals and entities. However, determining the exact ownership of ETH can be a complex task, considering the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies and the potential anonymity of holders.\n\nThis guide will examine the prominent figures and entities associated with significant ETH holdings. While the ownership landscape may evolve, the information provided will offer valuable insights into the key players in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem.\n\n9 out of the 10 Ethereum Whale addresses aren\u2019t individuals\n\nLooking at the distribution of ETH across the Ethereum network on Etherscan, it is interesting to note that a significant portion of the largest holders are not individual entities. Among the top accounts by ETH balance, only 1 out of the top 10 belongs to respective owners. The largest holder of Ethereum is the Eth2 Deposit contract, which holds a substantial amount of ETH. Following closely is Wrapped Ether.\n\nAbout half of the top 50 Ethereum whales have yet to be publicly identified. Apart from the non-individual holders, several prominent exchanges also have a substantial stake in Ethereum. Binance, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, holds considerable ETH across multiple wallets. Other well-known exchanges like Bitfinex, Kraken, and the Gemini contract also have significant positions among the top holders of Ethereum.\n\nThis distribution of ETH ownership showcases the diverse ecosystem surrounding Ethereum, with a combination of institutional investors, decentralized applications, and exchange platforms playing a role in its network. It highlights various entities\u2019 growing interest and participation in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem and its potential as a leading blockchain platform.\n\nVitalik Buterin\n\nVitalik Buterin, the brilliant mind behind Ethereum, holds a prominent position in the cryptocurrency community. As one of the co-founders of Ethereum, Buterin has played a pivotal role in shaping the platform\u2019s vision and development. While Buterin\u2019s influence extends far beyond his personal ETH holdings, exploring his involvement in Ethereum\u2019s ownership landscape is still interesting.\n\nIn October 2018, Buterin took a bold step by publicly disclosing his personal ETH wallet address via Twitter, inviting transparency and scrutiny into his holdings. This address (tagged Vb) currently holds just 55.58 ETH, valued at around $109k. Buterin moved over 325,000 ETH into a new contract (Vb3). The contract has about 244,000 ETH, valued at about $479 million. Another of his wallets, \u2018Vitalik.eth\u2019, holds 4,119 ETH, valued at around $8 million.\n\nIt is worth noting that Buterin has made significant contributions to the Ethereum community by championing the platform\u2019s development, promoting decentralization, and advocating for innovative use cases. In addition, Buterin has demonstrated his commitment to the broader crypto ecosystem by actively engaging in philanthropic endeavors. He donated over 16,000 ETH to charitable causes, alongside various meme coins, which amounted to a donation worth over $1 billion. The contributions exemplify his dedication to the positive impact that cryptocurrencies can have on society.\n\nWhile Buterin may not be at the top of the list regarding ETH holdings, his influence, and contributions to Ethereum\u2019s success cannot be understated. His vision and technical expertise have propelled Ethereum to become a leading blockchain platform, fostering innovation and attracting a vibrant community of developers and entrepreneurs.\n\nPrivate User\n\nExamining the top 5 addresses on Etherscan reveals an interesting observation. Among them, one private address stands out, sparking speculation that it may belong to Joseph Lubin, the co-founder of Ethereum and the Ethereum software company ConsenSys. This private address holds a significant amount of 1,493,000 ETH. It would position him as the most significant ETH holder if it is associated with Lubin.\n\nLubin has chosen not to reveal the exact quantity of ETH he holds. Previous estimates by Forbes from 2018 suggested that Lubin\u2019s ETH ownership could range between 5% and 10% of the total circulating supply at that time. Joseph Lubin\u2019s contributions to the early development and growth of Ethereum have been instrumental in establishing it as a decentralized platform capable of executing smart contracts.\n\nEth2 Deposit Contract: The Largest ETH Holder\n\nWithin the Ethereum ecosystem, one entity stands out as the largest holder of ETH\u2014the Eth2 Deposit Contract. While it may not represent an individual or a traditional entity in the typical sense, its position is the primary staking contract for Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake protocol.\n\nETH holders stake their tokens in the Eth2 Deposit Contract, participating in the PoS consensus and supporting the network\u2019s operations.\n\nAt the time of the provided information, the Eth2 Deposit Contract holds a substantial balance of 25.97 million ETH, valued at approximately $50 billion. It represents 21.6% of the total ETH supply and underscores the importance of staking Ethereum.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the Eth2 Deposit Contract is a smart contract address not owned or controlled by a single individual or entity. Instead, it serves as a mechanism for users to lock their ETH as collateral and participate in the PoS consensus. The funds in the contract are intended to be returned to the users once they unstake their tokens.\n\nThe significance of the Eth2 Deposit Contract\u2019s ETH holdings goes beyond its sheer quantity. As a key component of Ethereum\u2019s transition to PoS, it represents ETH holders\u2019 collective participation and commitment to the network\u2019s evolution. Users actively contribute to the network\u2019s security by staking their tokens and earning rewards for their involvement.\n\nWrapped Ether (WETH): Enabling Usability on Ethereum-based DApps\n\nEthereum, with its native cryptocurrency ETH, revolutionized the blockchain landscape by enabling the execution of smart contracts. However, the standard form of ETH, known as Ether, does not conform to the ERC-20 standard. This lack of compatibility with ERC-20-based DApps limited its direct use and integration within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWETH is an ERC-20 token that represents a 1:1 representation of ETH. It bridges the native ETH and ERC-20-compliant tokens, allowing users to interact with a broader array of Ethereum-based DApps seamlessly. Wrapping ETH involves locking a specific amount of ETH in a smart contract and minting an equivalent amount of WETH. This WETH can be freely transferred and traded on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and other platforms supporting ERC-20 tokens. When users want to convert their WETH back into ETH, they can simply \u201cunwrap\u201d it by redeeming their WETH for the corresponding amount of ETH held in the smart contract.\n\nThe WETH smart contract is the second largest holder of ETH. The contract holds 3 million ETH, worth about $6 billion. The ETH constitutes about 2.8% of the total ETH in circulation. However, you should note that the exact figure constantly changes as users wrap and unwrap ETH.\n\nBinance and Other Centralized Exchanges (CEXs)\n\nCentralized exchanges (CEXs) play a significant role in facilitating the trading and storage of digital assets, including ETH. These platforms act as intermediaries, connecting buyers and sellers and providing liquidity for various cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.\n\nWhile centralized exchanges provide convenience and liquidity, they operate under a centralized model, meaning users entrust their assets to the platform. This differs from decentralized exchanges, which allow users to retain control of their private keys and trade directly from their wallets. However, centralized exchanges often offer additional features, such as fiat on-ramps, advanced trading tools, and enhanced liquidity, making them a popular choice for many traders and investors.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to exercise caution and consider factors such as security, reputation, and regulatory compliance when choosing a centralized exchange for trading and storing ETH. Researching and selecting reputable exchanges with a strong security and customer support track record can help mitigate potential risks associated with centralized custody.\n\nHere is a quick breakdown of the top CEX wallets holding ETH, as tagged on Etherscan at press time:\n\nPosition CEX Wallet Balance Percentage 3 Binance 7 1,996,008 1.66% 4 Kraken 13 1,598,923 1.33% 7 Binance 8 1,070,814 0.89% 8 Binance: Binance-Peg Tokens 589,999 0.49% 9 Bitfinex 19 450,118 0.37% 10 Bitfinex: MultiSig 3 428,053 0.36% 11 Gemini 3 409,498 0.34% 17 Bitfinex 20 275,000 0.23% 42 Bithumb 12 170,000 0.14% 47 Binance 28 159,998 0.13% 50 OKX 6 150,0000 0.12%\n\nHere are some other notable mentions in the top 50:\n\nArbitrum: Bridge\n\nThe Arbitrum ETH Bridge is a critical component of the Arbitrum network, a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. It facilitates the seamless transfer of Ethereum (ETH) and ERC-20 tokens between the Ethereum mainnet and the Arbitrum network, enhancing scalability and reducing transaction costs.\n\nBuilt by Offchain Labs, Arbitrum utilizes Optimistic Rollup technology to process transactions off-chain, resulting in increased throughput and reduced congestion on the Ethereum mainnet. The Arbitrum ETH Bridge connects the mainnet and the Arbitrum network, allowing users to transfer their ETH and tokens between the two environments.\n\nUsing the Arbitrum ETH Bridge typically involves depositing ETH or ERC-20 tokens from the Ethereum mainnet onto the Arbitrum network. This transfer locks the assets on the mainnet while creating a corresponding representation on Arbitrum. Users can then utilize these assets within the Arbitrum network for various decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts, taking advantage of the improved scalability and lower fees Arbitrum provides.\n\nWhen users wish to move their assets back to the Ethereum mainnet, they can initiate a withdrawal from the Arbitrum network to the mainnet via the Arbitrum ETH Bridge. This process unlocks the assets on Arbitrum and transfers them back to the Ethereum mainnet, making them available for use in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThis Arbitrum bridge contract holds 1.16 million ETH, worth about $2.27 billion. However, you should note that the exact figure constantly changes as users move ETH into and out of the Arbitrum contract.\n\nEthDev\n\nAn address tagged as \u201cETH DEV\u201d from the Ethereum Foundation is among the top 20 Ethereum holders. It is essential to note that the Ethereum Foundation itself holds a significant amount of ETH due to its involvement in developing and promoting the Ethereum platform.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation, the organization behind Ethereum, has accumulated ETH over the years through various means, such as fundraising events, grants, and contributions. These holdings support the ongoing development of the Ethereum ecosystem, fund projects, and ensure the platform\u2019s long-term sustainability.\n\nThe EthDev wallet holds 318,272 ETH, worth about $622 million.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth mentioning that the Ethereum network operates in a decentralized manner, and the ownership and distribution of Ether are not publicly disclosed for individual wallets or addresses.\n\nOther wallets identified on EtherScan with substantial ETH include:\n\nPolkadot: MultiSig with 306,276.63 ETH.\n\nzkSync Era: Diamond Proxy with 297,942.66 ETH.\n\nBitDao: Treasury with 264,946.63 ETH.\n\nCompound: cETH Token with 251,726.65 ETH.\n\nPolygon (Matic): Ether Bridge with 221,499.78 ETH\n\nLido: Curve Liquidity Farming Pool Contract with 213,857.51 ETH\n\nConclusion\n\nDetermining the exact ownership of the most Ether (ETH) can be challenging due to the decentralized nature of the Ethereum network. However, by examining various sources and available data, we can identify some prominent entities and individuals who hold significant amounts of ETH.\n\nThe ownership of ETH is diverse, involving a combination of entities such as development funds, decentralized finance protocols, early investors, individual holders, and exchanges. As Ethereum continues to evolve and gain prominence in the blockchain ecosystem, the distribution of ETH ownership may undergo further shifts.\n\nWith the dynamic cryptocurrency market, ETH\u2019s ownership landscape will likely evolve as new entities and individuals participate in the Ethereum network."

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin's Surprising Ethereum Staking Strategy Explained - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently shared some intriguing insights into his personal staking strategy for Ethereum (ETH).\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, during a June 29 episode of the Bankless podcast, Buterin revealed that he only stakes a \u201csmall portion\u201d of his ETH. The reason? The complexities of multisignature wallets, or multisigs.\n\nUnraveling the Multisig Mystery\n\nMultisigs are a type of digital signature scheme that requires multiple parties to sign off on a transaction before it can be executed. This added layer of security is crucial in the crypto world, but it\u2019s not without its challenges. Buterin explained that staking ETH requires the keys to be public on an online subsystem for safety, and setting up a multisig for this purpose can be quite complicated.\n\nComparing Staking Strategies\n\nButerin\u2019s cautious approach to staking stands in stark contrast to that of Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Ethereum and founder of Cardano. Hoskinson expressed his surprise on Twitter, stating he was \u201cat a loss for words\u201d upon learning that Buterin only stakes a small portion of his Ether. He went on to reveal that he stakes all of his Cardano holdings.\n\nI had to listen to this a few times. I'm just at a loss for words. All of our Ada is staked. Guess what that's how it's supposed to be for a properly designed Proof of Stake protocol. https://t.co/ye6va1DH06 \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 29, 2023\n\nThe Future of Staking: EigenLayer Protocol\n\nButerin also touched on the topic of the EigenLayer protocol during the podcast. This protocol allows Ethereum validators and stakers to \u201cre-stake\u201d their assets onto other emerging networks. While it\u2019s still in its testnet phase and not expected to launch until Q3 2023, Buterin highlighted that it poses \u201ccentralization risks.\u201d He explained that the system would value trustworthy stakers more than untrustworthy ones, and the former are less likely to get slashed.\n\nSreeram Kaanan, the founder of EigenLayer, concurred with Buterin\u2019s concerns, emphasizing the \u201ccomplex risks\u201d associated with restaking. He advocated for a \u201cconstrained approach in building restaking,\u201d focusing on what\u2019s beneficial for the ecosystem and the potential for new innovation.\n\nThe Challenges of Scaling and Smart Contract Wallets\n\nButerin\u2019s comments on staking come on the heels of his June 9 blog post, where he stated that the Ethereum blockchain would \u201cfail\u201d without sufficient scaling infrastructure to make transactions affordable. He also pointed out another potential point of failure related to smart contract wallets. According to Buterin, the move to these wallets has led to complexities in user experience when users manage multiple addresses simultaneously."

        "title": "Bitcoin ($BTC) and Ethereum ($ETH) Could See Massive Gains in Period of 'Absolute Pleasure', Popular Analyst Says - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "The anonymous host of the popular YouTube channel InvestAnswers, who has in the past said he expects Bitcoin\u2019s price to hit $1.5 million by 2030, is forecasting bullish price tracjetories for both Bitcoin ($BTC) and Ethereum ($ETH) in the near future.\n\nIn a recent video shared with the host\u2019s dedicated following of 445,000 subscribers, he disclosed that the anticipatory rise of Bitcoin to $42,000 by April 2024 would not come as a surprise, based on trends observed in the options market.\n\nAccording to InvestAnswers, Bitcoin\u2019s call options have attracted more demand than put options, indicating a decidedly bullish sentiment. Call options, it\u2019s worth noting, are products that grant the holder the right but not the obligation to urcahse an asset at a specified price within a certain timeframe.\n\nConversely, put options allow but don\u2019t oblige the holder to sell an asset under the same conditions. InvestAnswers\u2019 host noted that for late this year there\u2019s a \u201chuge amount of action at the $45,000 level,\u201d and added that the put-call ratio is now at 0.39, which \u201cis very bullish.\u201d He added:\n\nI said many times before I would not be surprised if we saw $42,000 by April 2024 at the time of the halving. According to the [chart below], we could be there by Christmas \u2013 $45,000+. Again if these options actions\u2019 players are correct\n\nSwitching to Ethereum, the anonymous analyst is interpreting the put-call ratio for this second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization as an \u201cextremely bullish\u201d harbinger. Per his words there\u2019s a \u201clot of call demand again at $2,500 for ETH, same date December 29, 2023.\u201d\n\nThe put-call ratio here, he said, is at 0.21, which is \u201cextremely bullish\u201d and \u201cpretty much nobody\u201d is buying puts on Ethereum as the market is expecting the cryptocurrency to surpass $2,000 and go up to $2,500 by Christmas.\n\nThe host added that the timing may be unpredictable, but the next five months promise to be exciting, as will the year after that. Per his words, there will be 18 months of \u201cabsolute pleasure\u201d to come.\n\nAs CryptoGlboe reported, cryptocurrency analyst Willy Woo has recently indicated that he believes the price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin is in the \u201cearly stages of another price squeeze,\u201d suggesting the cryptocurrency\u2019s price could surge in the near future.\n\nWoo\u2019s words come as major financial powerhouses that collectively manage an astounding $27 trillion in assets are making inroads into the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency after a race to list the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States kicked off.\n\nThese financial behemoths, which include BlackRock, Fidelity, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, BNY Mellon, Invesco, and Bank of America are \u201cactively working to provide access to Bitcoin and more,\u201d according to CoinShares\u2019 Chief Strategy Officer Meltem Demirors.\n\nFeatured image via Unsplash."

        "title": "Crypto Analysis: Tradecurve, QNT Vs. ETC - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nCryptocurrencies began July with a reinvigorated bullish momentum, sparking interest from investors. Tradecurve (TCRV), Quant (QNT), and Ethereum Classic (ETC) are among the top digital assets that have captured the interest of investors. However, among these three leading altcoins, which would offer the better returns in the next bull market?\n\nHow High Can Quant (QNT) Go On This Uptrend?\n\nIn early 2023 when the cryptocurrency market was on a huge price bounce, Quant (QNT) recorded minimal gains. On the flip side, the second quarter losses hugely affected the price of Quant (QNT) as it lost more than 30% of its value. The losses of Quant (QNT) were a result of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) classification as a security.\n\nHowever, Quant (QNT) appears to have shrugged off the SEC\u2019s effect. With things changing, Quant (QNT) is now on a bull run. Over the last two weeks, the price of Quant (QNT) has increased by 13% to reach a high of $110. However, with cases like these usually drawn out like XRP\u2019s case, experts are only fairly bullish about Quant (QNT) predicting a high of $120-$125 in the third quarter.\n\nCan Ethereum Classic (ETC) Continue Its Meteoric Rise\n\nSince the Ethereum migration when Ethereum Classic (ETC) received a hoard of miners, the crypto has been cast into the spotlight. Ethereum Classic (ETC) has been one of the top-performing cryptos, gaining 14% over the weekend. In the last two weeks, the price of Ethereum Classic (ETC) has increased by more than 50% \u2013 from under $14 to trading as high as $20.4 today.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) currently trades at $19.94, just above the $19.3 support level. Ethereum Classic (ETC) bulls would need to act at this price zone to force an uptrend. Unlike Quant (QNT), crypto analysts are more bullish about Ethereum Classic (ETC), largely because of the growth of the network. For the end of the year, analysts have predicted that Ethereum Classic (ETC) could trade between $29.19 to $43.79, representing a 50% \u2013 125% price rise.\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) Jumps 80%, Onchain Metrics Point to More Gains\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) is another altcoin that caught the attention of investors in June. Last month, the price of Tradecurve (TCRV) increased by a remarkable 80%, making it one of the best-performing cryptos. However, Tradecurve (TCRV) is still showing bullish signs and analysts predict that a 40% price rise could happen this week to send Tradecurve (TCRV) from $0.018 above $0.025.\n\nThe bullish sentiment of Tradecurve (TCRV) comes from it being a one-of-a-kind platform that could revamp the DeFi sector. Tradecurve (TCRV) is building a platform to give DeFi users access to trade assets from one of the biggest global markets \u2013 the OTC derivatives market valued at $632 trillion.\n\nThis will allow users to trade stocks, forex, commodities, options, ETFs, and others from a single account. It is this liquidity that makes experts bullish about Tradecurve (TCRV) predicting it could yield 50x returns by the end of 2023\n\nTo find more information about Tradecurve and the TCRV token, visit the links below:\n\nClick Here For the Website\n\nClick Here To Buy TCRV Presale Tokens\n\nFollow Us Twitter\n\nJoin Our Community on Telegram\n\n*This article was paid for Cryptonomist did not write the article or test the platform."

        "title": "Ethereum Network Experiences Quiet Surge In Growth Signals Potential Market Cap Boom - TronWeekly",
        "content": "Santiment, a renowned blockchain analytics firm, took to Twitter to highlight an intriguing observation regarding Ethereum\u2019s network growth. According to their tweet, this growth has steadily increased, albeit with minimal fanfare.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 #Ethereum's network growth has somewhat quietly been on the rise. New addresses are being created at an increased pace, which is a signal for eventual market cap growth. We'll monitor this #bullish divergence as $ETH ranges just below $1,900. https://t.co/TpiOUGgYGl pic.twitter.com/B0SrlrsrmB \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) July 6, 2023\n\nNotably, a surge in the creation of new addresses has caught their attention, which they consider to be a promising sign of future market capitalization expansion.\n\nThis bullish divergence has piqued the interest of market observers who are closely monitoring Ethereum\u2019s progress as it hovers just below the $1,900 mark.\n\nInterestingly, Ethereum\u2019s price movement has been closely tied to that of Bitcoin in recent times. However, recent notable transactions suggest that Ethereum may soon break away from this correlation and establish its independent trajectory.\n\nWhale Alert, a platform that tracks large cryptocurrency transactions, reported a substantial transfer of 25,264 ETH, valued at approximately $48 million. The funds were moved from an undisclosed wallet to Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nWhile such significant transfers can sometimes signal an impending uptrend, they can also introduce short-term volatility into the market. These movements often serve as indicators of possible changes in price sentiment.\n\nIt is worth noting that alongside the aforementioned transfer, another substantial transaction involving 30,000 ETH was also recorded. This sizable amount was transferred from an anonymous wallet, adding further intrigue to the unfolding Ethereum landscape.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nAccording to the latest data from CoinMarketcap, ETH is currently trading at $1,853.13, with a decline in both daily and weekly charts. As per the data, in 24 hours, the coin decreased by 3%, while in the seven-day chart, there was a 2.70% decline.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nDue to various factors, ETH\u2019s price rally was halted after reaching the $1,970 level on July 3. These include the possibility of more interest rate hikes and stricter regulations in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe Ethereum network also experienced withdrawals from its smart contract applications, which affected the June rally. Investors are now questioning whether the demand for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund has diminished, potentially leading to a correction in ETH\u2019s price.\n\nRegulatory developments, such as the European Union\u2019s Data Act and Binance Australia\u2019s derivatives business investigation, have contributed to the challenging environment.\n\nThe Ethereum network\u2019s total value locked (TVL) has decreased, indicating a decline in investor interest or a shift to layer-2 alternatives.\n\nSource: DefiLlama\n\nProfessional traders have increased their leveraged long positions in Ether futures, but other indicators suggest a balanced demand for call-and-put options. Overall, these factors present significant obstacles for Ethereum bulls in breaking the $1,970 resistance level.\n\nRelated Reading | Bitcoin: BlackRock\u2019s Fink Addresses Crypto Benefits"

        "content": "MetaMask, the most popular Ethereum software wallet, has changed its look by updating its user interface following some negative feedback from the community.\n\nThe extension now becomes cleaner and tidier, able to cope with the demands of the web3 audience.\n\nLet\u2019s look at all the details together.\n\nEthereum software wallet: MetaMask extension updates user interface\n\nMetaMask, the software wallet for Ethereum developed by the company Consensys, announced yesterday that it has made some changes to its user interface in order to meet the needs of its community.\n\n\ud83e\udd8aMetaMask v10.33 is here!\n\n\n\nWith a cleaner layout, more intuitive site connections, network and account selection, foxing with web3 got easier. Your feedback inspired us to improve, enabling a simpler web3 journey.\n\n\n\nWe hope you enjoy it!\n\n\ud83d\udd17https://t.co/tW2nucHkzs pic.twitter.com/g0JsZSLybX \u2014 MetaMask \ud83e\udd8a\ud83e\udef0 (@MetaMask) July 6, 2023\n\nIn version 10.33, the fox mask has swapped the sorting of some features, effectively changing its look by making it sharper and neater.\n\nFirst, information about account name, connection status, and network selection have all been included within a single top row, reducing the visual noise previously experienced by users.\n\nNow everything you need to operate in DeFi is at your fingertips in the top area of the extension.\n\nConnection status in particular is now more apparent, so you can more easily manage access with the various dApps and know in real time what you are about to connect to.\n\nA common \u201cproblem\u201d with the previous version of the MetaMask Ethereum wallet was that the global menu navigation was embedded with the account selection and was confusing to a large part of the community.\n\nInstead, now the account avatar is placed next to the name so that you have a clear visual association with your identity.\n\nIn addition, with the new update the problem of \u201ctoken-network\u201d matching has been solved: when, for example, logging into the Avalanche network, instead of the token \u201cAVAX\u201d it would still read \u201cETH,\u201d which was quite confusing for newbies.\n\nInstead, now each network is correctly associated with its respective token.\n\nOne final adjustment to the user interface of the Ethereum wallet concerns the \u201cportfolio\u201d entry, now added directly to the main MetaMask dashboard.\n\nThe hope is that with this update Consensys may have simplified the user experience of its flagship product, prompting positive feedback and consequently increasing the number of downloads to the extension.\n\nHardware wallet vs software wallet\n\nDespite the updated user interface of MetaMask, the main Ethereum wallet, the ongoing debate between those who prefer software version crypto wallets and those who prefer hardware wallets remains alive.\n\nIndeed, MetaMask, as a downloadable extension for Chrome, Ios and Android, suffers from all the security issues related to software wallets.\n\nIn particular, when MetaMask is downloaded (as well as all software wallets), the private keys of the account are kept internally in the device (the computer) on which the installation takes place, in a folder that can easily fall victim to hack attacks.\n\nThere are many cases where users have experienced breaches of their wallet with associated loss of all funds, typically due to a malware attack.\n\nEven if you download a good antivirus and take all the precautions in the world, you need to be aware that this vulnerability unfortunately cannot be fixed.\n\nA different matter applies to hardware wallets such as Ledger, Trezor, Bitbox and Coldcard where the private key storage is within the device itself (the flash drive to be clear).\n\nBy using these wallets in offline mode and removing the hardware every time we have finished our transactions, it will be much more difficult (if not impossible) to be robbed by malicious parties.\n\nObviously, this type of wallet is more complex than the software wallets: for a user who performs dozens of transactions a day, it might be more inconvenient as there is trivially a pin to enter to approve any transaction.\n\nThere is also to consider that the device has to be guarded away from the seed phrase, as if a thief happens to come in and take away both the hardware and the seed, we can kiss our cryptocurrencies goodbye.\n\nSame goes for natural disasters such as fires, floods, and earthquakes: if you lose both components at the same time, you are screwed.\n\nIn any case, assuming that the custody of the device and the seed phrase is done properly, we can conclude that the hardware versions turn out to be significantly more secure than their software counterparts.\n\nAs much as software wallets for Ethereum, such as MetaMask, may be extremely more \u201cconvenient\u201d and straightforward for those beginning to approach the DeFi world, the hardware versions are definitely the most tamper-proof.\n\nHowever, we can take advantage of the convenience of operating via MetaMask with the security of hardware wallets by simply connecting one\u2019s device to the extension."

        "title": "Ethereum Co-founder Vitalik Buterin Applauds Bitcoin Ordinals - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, during a July 7, 2023, Twitter Space, spoke about Bitcoin Ordinals stating it brought back the \u2018builder culture\u2019 back. The Ethereum co-founder was speaking with Bitcoin proponent Eric Wall and Udi Wertheimer and praised the new developments in the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nVitalik Buterin Praises Bitcoin Ordinals\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder thinks that since the inception of Bitcoin Ordinals, there has been a revival of the builder culture over the network. He also praised the new BRC-20 token standard. Buterin sees the new standard as rejecting political stagnancy in the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nEver since the Ordinals arrived, argued Buterin, the builder culture responsible for exciting developments and innovations is back on the network. Furthermore, he said \u201cthere\u2019s real pushback to the laser-eye movement, which is good.\u201d The conversation with the host lasted a couple of hours and was primarily centered around scalability issues.\n\nWall argued that the praised Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning network, which facilitates faster transactions, cannot be scaled up for future users. Also, the system fails frequently even when a medium-sized payment is being processed. Unless these issues could be adequately addressed, achieving scalability would be different.\n\nIn response, the Ethereum co-founder suggested an approach; he said the best practice would be to emphasize implementing different types of layer-2 solutions. Also, the network should try to make Bitcoin\u2019s base layer more efficient.\n\n\u201cI think focusing on rollups is good, and so is being open to ZK-snark-based solutions.\u201d \u2013 Buterin.\n\nAnother host, Wertheimer, suggested that introducing zero-knowledge rollups would inadvertently create stimulating side effects for the blockchain. Continuing Buterin\u2019s suggestion, he said adopting rollups for Bitcoin could lead to an execution environment that could be used to test smart contracts.\n\nWall and Wertheimer have been key figures behind the Taproot Wizards, Ordinal project. They are outspoken exponents of Ordinals and are known to frequently advocate building increased functionality on top of the Bitcoin network.\n\nFundamental Bitcoinists, on many occasions, have criticized their stance. They have argued that including Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and smart contracts on the network could deviate the network from its primary function\u2013 a peer-to-peer (P2P) cash network.\n\nSamson Mow, Jan3 CEO, believes Ordinals waste the block space in the blockchain, which could otherwise be used as a dedicated space for Bitcoin payment. Wall is aware of the critics and explained that Bitcoin could be a proof system for zero-knowledge proofs, and how this scenario shall avoid network congestion.\n\nFurther in the interview, Wall argued the Bitcoin community has always tried to do things similar to a decentralized finance ecosystem. But most members wanted the Bitcoin base layer to act as \u201csort of a judge or an arbiter of that computation and not have to run the computation on-chain.\u201d\n\nThese 2 laser-eye clowns have been running blockstream into the ground for the last decade\n\n\n\nIn 10 years that company couldn\u2019t come up with a single successful product\n\n\n\nTheir joke of a blockchain processes 3 txs a day\n\n\n\nAnd they think they have nothing to learn from ethereum pic.twitter.com/mp7we9Lvxq \u2014 Udi Wertheimer (@udiWertheimer) July 6, 2023\n\nThe discussion between the greats of the crypto community sparked a new controversy in the Bitcoin community where Wertheimer criticized Mow and Adam Beck, the CEO of Blockstream, for being unenthusiastic about the outcomes of the conversation with Buterin.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals inscriptions, which were launched in 2023, have garnered much interest from the community. Also, the 2021\u2019s Taproot upgrade has become a turning point as it provided more utilities to the Bitcoin blockchain. The BRC-20 token standard, often referred to as being similar to Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 token standard, brought in the capabilities for fungible tokens on the blockchain."

        "content": "Key Takeaways:\n\nDecentralized exchanges (DEX) Uniswap plans to launch its much-awaited V4 version\n\nHowever, the launch will come only after Ethereum (ETH) completes its Cancun upgrade\n\nAccording to reports, the ETH Cancun upgrade is due at the end of September\n\nUniswap (UNI) will launch its V4 version after Ethereum\u2019s Cancun upgrade\n\nYEREVAN (CoinChapter.com) \u2014 Uniswap (UNI), one of the leading decentralized exchanges (DEX), eagerly awaits the implementation of the Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) upgrade on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain to launch its highly anticipated version 4 (V4).\n\nUniswap V4 aims to enhance user experience, provide advanced features, and address existing limitations. However, according to Erin Koen, head of the Governance Lead at the Uniswap Foundation, its successful launch hinges on the timely deployment of the Cancun upgrade.\n\nThe current version of Uniswap, V3, has gained significant popularity. It offered unique features such as concentrated liquidity and the ability to provide greater capital efficiency for liquidity providers. It also focused on maximizing capital efficiency compared to the previous V2 version.\n\nNevertheless, the Uniswap team envisions even more powerful capabilities with the upcoming V4 release.\n\nBesides, after the completion of the Cancun upgrade, another crucial step in the process is to conduct a thorough security audit. This stage holds significant importance as it serves to evaluate and ensure the robustness and security of the new protocol.\n\nAccording to The Block, which cited Koen, Uniswap will not rush through the audit to ensure that the integrity and security of its ecosystem are not compromised.\n\nUniswap v4 a massive upgrade\n\nThe launch of Uniswap v4 will come as a huge upgrade to the largest decentralized exchange protocol for Ethereum. It boasts of a total value locked (TVL) of around $4 billion, according to DefiLlama.\n\nUniswap v4\u2019s draft code went live on June 13, ushering in a new era for the DEx protocol. This transition is centered around the implementation of \u201chooks,\u201d which are smart contracts that allow customization of how pools, swaps, fees, and LP positions interact in Uniswap v4. These include options for fees, on-chain limit orders, and personalized on-chain oracles.\n\n\u201cUniswap v4\u2019s architecture reduces costs and ensures efficiency. It introduces a new \u201csingleton\u201d contract, where all pools live within a single smart contract. We believe the combination of hooks and singleton architecture creates an incredibly powerful platform \u2e3a fast, safe pool customization and efficient routing across many pools,\u201d the company announced in a blog post last month.\n\nThe upgrade also introduces an innovative \u201cflash accounting\u201d system that aims to reduce fees for liquidity providers. Unlike the v3 model, which involved transferring assets in and out of pools after each swap, the v4 model will only transfer net balances, developers have clarified.\n\nThis adjustment ensures a more efficient and streamlined approach to managing liquidity within the protocol.\n\nSince news of the upgrade hit the newsstands, investors have been waiting to see how it will impact the UNI token price. The UNI is the native cryptocurrency of the Uniswap ecosystem.\n\nLast month, after Uniswap v4\u2019s draft code went live, Wintermute Trading accumulated over $4 million worth of UNI tokens.\n\nA large crypto whale has accumulated over $4 million worth of UNI tokens\n\nThis development led many to speculate that the upgrade will send the UNI price soaring. At the time of writing, the UNI coin price in the market is around $5.5. This is still significantly down from its all-time high of nearly $50 in May 2021.\n\nEthereum Cancun upgrade coming in September\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun upgrade is due at the end of September 2023. This development comes months after Ethereum (ETH) network completed its Shanghai upgrade earlier this year.\n\nThe upcoming upgrade will improve the scalability, security, and usability of the Ethereum network. To achieve this, it will implement several improvements, including the introduction of Proto-Danksharding to the network.\n\nP\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi, an Ethereum core developer, has emphasized the significance of Proto-Danksharding, stating that it should be the central focus of the upgrade.\n\nAccording to the company, Proto-Danksharding serves as an intermediary upgrade aimed at scaling rollups on the Ethereum network. It comes as a crucial step towards enhancing Ethereum\u2019s scalability and transaction speed.\n\nIn addition, the Ethereum Cancun upgrade is likely to incorporate several other Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). These may include EIPs 4758, 6046, and 6190, which involve the removal of the SELFDESTRUCT function, along with EIP-663, which allows for unlimited SWAP and DUP instructions.\n\nThe much-awaited upgrade may also introduce other potential features, such as EIP-5920, which relates to the PAY opcode, and EIP-1153, which introduces the concept of transient storage.\n\nWill the Cancun upgrade impact Ethereum (ETH) price?\n\nEthereum (ETH) remains the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin (BTC), with a market cap of over $220 billion. At the peak of the crypto rally in late 2021, its price surged significantly to reach an all-time high (ATH) of $4,891. At the time, Bitcoin also peaked at more than $68,000.\n\nBut then immediately came the downdraft. Inflation rates went up, creating FUD among investors amid speculations that the Federal Reserve would hike borrowing costs in 2022. As a result, traders drifted away from cryptos to safer, traditional assets.\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum, and a host of leading tokens tanked, sending the crypto market into an overall slump.\n\nSince January this year, ETH has made slight gains, adding over 50% to its price. However, it remains well below its peak of November 2021.\n\nWhile writing, ETH exchanges hands at $1,860, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has tanked since November 2021, except for a slight surge in April last year. Graph Credit: CoinMarketCap\n\nMeanwhile, although it is impossible to ascertain, the Cancun upgrade has the potential to serve as a significant catalyst for Ethereum\u2019s price. By improving the scalability, security, and usability of the network, the upgrade may attract a larger user and developer base to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nIt is typical for network upgrades to reflect positively on the token\u2019s price. Long-term investors will be looking to see if they can regain their losses, while more recent ones will hope to make quick short-term profits."
