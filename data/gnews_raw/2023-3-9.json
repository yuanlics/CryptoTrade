        "title": "New York Attorney General says ETH is a security - Ledger Insights",
        "content": "Continuing the regulatory clampdown on the cryptocurrency sector, the New York Attorney General has alleged that the Ethereum network token ETH is a security. It made the assertion in a lawsuit filed against crypto exchange KuCoin, alleging that it is operating in New York state without licenses as a commodities broker-dealer and securities broker-dealer.\n\nJoe Lubin, the founder of ConsenSys, was a major backer of Ethereum in the early days and had a big chunk of ETH at the time of its initial coin offering (ICO). ConsenSys is heavily involved in both crypto and enterprise applications of Ethereum including as maintainer of the Quorum enterprise blockchain. Ethereum was the first permissionless blockchain to show potential for various applications beyond payment, including real world solutions.\n\nBackground: A security or a commodity?\n\nBitcoin is generally considered a commodity, in part because it didn\u2019t have an ICO. But we\u2019ll come back to that. ETH is considered a commodity by the CFTC, and a 2018 speech by SEC Director William Henman implied that ETH probably was a commodity as well.\n\nThe well known Howey test looks at an investment contract. To determine if it\u2019s a security, it asks whether it involves:\n\nThe investment of money\n\nin a common enterprise\n\nwith a reasonable expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others.\n\nHinman (sort of) added a \u2018sufficiently decentralized\u2018 test: \u201cIf the network on which the token or coin is to function is sufficiently decentralized \u2013 where purchasers would no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts \u2013 the assets may not represent an investment contract.\u201d\n\nHence, it was thought ETH probably was a security at the time of the ICO, but by 2018, perhaps it was not.\n\nIs it about staking or new legal precedents?\n\nThe NYAG court filing includes the following text, which interprets ETH as an investment and also references staking activities.\n\nThe court case states, \u201cETH satisfies the Waldstein test. The ICO was used to raise funds to develop the Ethereum network, as set forth in the ICO Documents. And Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation retained large positions of ETH that they continue to use to fund ETH\u2019s development. ETH was also designed as an investment. It continues to be referred to as an \u201cinvestment\u201d on the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s website. And ETH is used to generate staking rewards for investors. Furthermore, ETH was used to promote the Ethereum enterprise because ETH is needed to process any transactions on the Ethereum network.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more in the document about the ICO and staking.\n\nBut the NYAG filing also leans on a recent court case in late 2022 where a summary judgment ruled that the LBRY-issued LBC token was a security based on the Howey test. LBRY did not conduct an ICO, and LBC was designed as a utility token for a video network.\n\nAn interpretation of the ruling highlighted that LBRY and insiders retained significant quantities of the token, which reinforces the third prong of the Howey test of an expectation of profit based on the efforts of others. However, the alignment of interests is also evidence of a common enterprise. Ropes & Gray argued the case collapsed Howey prongs two and three into a single argument contrary to court precedent.\n\nThe law firm added, \u201cThere are numerous reasons for a project to retain portions of its own coin that would not relate to an expectation that the coin will increase in value. For example, a project may retain a portion of its own coins to facilitate validation of transactions on a proof-of-stake network.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the trial between the SEC and Ripple over whether or not XRP is a security has yet to conclude after starting under the previous administration."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Are Crashing Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nCryptocurrencies have had a rough couple of days as word spread that the influential Silicon Valley Bank, which trades under SVB Financial Group (SIVB.Q 8361.54%), is facing a liquidity crisis. While this isn't directly a hit to crypto, many venture capital firms use Silicon Valley Bank, so there's a risk of a broader financial impact, which is why cryptocurrencies are down Friday.\n\nAs of 10:30 a.m. ET, Bitcoin (BTC 0.90%) had fallen by 8.5% over the prior 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH 1.41%) had fallen 8.8%, and Solana (SOL -1.36%) was down 5.7%. Looking further back, over the past seven days, those cryptocurrencies are down 11.2%, 10.7%, and 18.5% respectively.\n\nSo what\n\nThe two major events of the past week have been the collapse of Silvergate Capital and the potential collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Silvergate provided a direct gateway into cryptocurrencies for many wealthy investors and institutions, and even operates many publicly traded funds. But it was seen as a more crypto-specific bank.\n\nThis week's bank run on Silicon Valley Bank is more concerning for the broader tech ecosystem. It is used by many start-ups and provides services small companies need in order to scale their businesses quickly.\n\nContagion, or cascading risks from one entity to another, is the biggest fear here. That could lead to less lending and investors pulling back their investments. Silicon Valley's venture capital firms provide the fuel for the tech ecosystem, and anything that impacts them could impact a lot of smaller start-ups.\n\nAs far as crypto goes, dozens of blockchain start-ups have been funded by venture capitalists in Silicon Valley. If they face pressure from regulators, banks and ultimately, investors, they may not be able to build the tools and services that are intended to make cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana more useful, and thus more valuable.\n\nIn short, these ecosystems are intertwined, and the fear this week is that a collapse of Silicon Valley Bank will make this crypto winter even worse.\n\nNow what\n\nThe risk to financial institutions can't be understated because they're critical to making the financial system work. When lending pulls back all at once or there's a credit crisis, there can be an economywide impact, as we saw in 2008 and 2009.\n\nThe Labor Department's February jobs report Friday morning did provide some positive news. The U.S. economy added 311,000 non-farm jobs last month, but more people entered the workforce to seek jobs, so the unemployment rate rose to 3.6%. So far, the tech sector slowdown, the crypto collapse, and the downfall of some banks haven't spilled over to the broader economy.\n\nInvestors with a long-term view should start looking at this as a buying opportunity for high-quality cryptocurrencies. Despite the downturn in token values, the crypto industry continues to grow and innovate, which is ultimately what's going to drive value.\n\nI don't know if we are at or even near the bottom, but I am betting on innovation in the blockchain winning in the long term. The Ethereum and Solana blockchains are where most developers are building, and that's where I'm looking to be a buyer if this crash gets worse."

Discover SCENE\n\nThe New York Attorney General's office today filed a lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin for allegedly violating securities and commodities laws in the state.\n\nIn the complaint, Attorney General Letitia James makes the startling claim that not only are Terra (LUNA) and TerraUSD (UST) securities, as previously alleged by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, but also Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\n\u201cThis action is one of the first times a regulator is claiming in court that ETH, one of the largest cryptocurrencies available, is a security,\u201d today\u2019s announcement read. \u201cThe petition argues that ETH, just like LUNA and UST, is a speculative asset that relies on the efforts of third-party developers in order to provide profit to the holders of ETH.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe NYAG's lawsuit targets KuCoin for allegedly \u201cfalsely representing itself as an exchange\u201d when really it is a \u201csecurities and commodities broker-dealer.\u201d It aims to block access to the exchange in New York by forcing KuCoin to geo-fence its website based on IP addresses and GPS location.\n\nThe Seychelles-based exchange ranks fifth on CoinGecko's list of crypto exchanges based on \"trust score\" and 17th in the world based on 24-hour trading volume. KuCoin allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum from virtually anywhere in the world, including the United States. The company once touted itself as \u201cthe most advanced and secure cryptocurrency exchange,\" before suffering a $150 million hack in 2020.\n\nThe lawsuit argues that ETH is a security because, among other reasons, users can now earn financial rewards by holding the cryptocurrency. \u201cSince transitioning to the proof-of-stake consensus, possession of ETH translates directly to profit potential by earning staking rewards,\u201d reads the lawsuit.\n\nEthereum last year became a proof-of-stake blockchain. This is a consensus mechanism which requires users to stake or \u201clock-up\u201d its native cryptocurrency, ETH, to keep the network running. And the more ETH a user stakes, the more rewards they can potentially earn.\n\nThe timing of the lawsuit is also notable, given the attention that staking services have received lately from regulators. Just last month, the SEC fined popular American exchange Kraken $30 million because its staking product allegedly violated securities laws. And SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has hinted that Ethereum may be on the Commission's radar, repeatedly making public statements that suggest Bitcoin is the only crypto asset the SEC believes is a non-security.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAttorney General Letitia James\u2019s move is the latest in a tough crackdown by U.S. authorities on the crypto industry.\n\nThe SEC has ramped up enforcement actions of late, and politicians and lawmakers have turned up the anti-crypto rhetoric following the dramatic collapse of the once-dominant FTX crypto exchange and the arrest of its founder Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nThe state of New York, which has some of the strictest laws in the country regarding crypto, last month filed a lawsuit against crypto exchange CoinEx for also failing to register itself as a securities and commodities broker-dealer."

        "content": "Neeraj Agrawal, the Director of Communications at Coin Center, disagreed with the New York Attorney General\u2019s (NYAG) recent assessment of Ethereum as a security.\n\n\u201cCoin Center will be monitoring the case and if there\u2019s an opportunity to weigh in, we will.\u201d\n\nIn support of this view, Agrawal linked a 2018 article arguing that there is a difference between \u201ca token pre-sale and the token itself.\u201d\n\nApplicable securities laws use the Howey Test to determine whether a contract, scheme, or transaction meets the definition of a security. It focuses on resolving if investors paid money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits from the efforts of others.\n\nAlthough these rules date back to the 1930s, before computers and digital assets, specific cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) (or token pre-sales) have met the definition of an investment contract, according to regulators.\n\nNYAG says Ethereum is a security\n\nOn March 9, the NYAG, Letitia James, filed a lawsuit against Seychelles-based exchange KuCoin, citing concerns over \u201cfalsely representing itself as an exchange.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s action is the latest in our efforts to rein in shadowy cryptocurrency companies and bring order to the industry.\u201d\n\nJames said she could trade cryptocurrencies on the exchange in New York, yet the entity was not registered in the state. Furthermore, the AG added that users could buy and sell \u201cpopular virtual currencies, including ETH, LUNA, and TerraUSD (UST), which are securities and commodities.\u201d\n\nAlthough the principal theme of the lawsuit centered on KuCoin operating illegally in New York, James categorically called out the trading of securities on the platform as a basis for operating illegally, not just failure to register.\n\nThis paves the way for Ethereum\u2019s U.S. securities status to be determined in a court of law.\n\n\u201cThis action is one of the first times a regulator is claiming in court that ETH, one of the largest cryptocurrencies available, is a security.\u201d\n\nThe crypto community chimes in\n\nLawyer Jake Chervinsky dismissed James\u2019 claims about Ethereum, saying the enforcement action is simply an unfounded allegation, albeit an allegation from a regulator.\n\n\u201cAgencies are like any other plaintiff: they can write whatever they want in a complaint. It may get some press, but it doesn\u2019t change a thing.\u201c\n\nSimilarly, Messari founder Ryan Selkis echoed Chervinsky\u2019s comments, saying, \u201cETH is not a security.\u201d However, Selkis did not provide his reasoning, only hinting at a coordinated attack against crypto, saying, \u201cthe administrative state is completely out of control.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, as expected, Bitcoin maximalist Max Keiser opposed the previous consensus, praising regulators for \u201cfinally doing their job.\u201d\n\n\u201cETH is obviously a security. Now the regulators are finally doing their job. Shut this sh**show down, Gary!!!\u201c\n\nMentioned in this article"

If $ETH would be worth same as ChatGPT parent OpenAi it would put price of $ETH around $350. \u2014 Citron Research (@CitronResearch) March 10, 2023\n\nAs KuCoin is accused of selling unregistered securites, Ethereum (ETH) is one of them. Citron Research stressed that the security status of Ether (ETH) bacame even more obvious as the network migrated to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus and replaced mining by staking.\n\nEthereum (ETH) failed to deliver on its promises of a \"decentralized network,\" researchers say. Instead, it become a full-fledged investment vehicle and should, therefore, be taxed and regulated accordingly.\n\nAs such, Ethereum (ETH) could better be compared to corporations, not to \"alternative\" systems like Bitcoin (BTC). Should one compare Ethereum (ETH) and OpenAI, a U.S.-based ChatGPT creator, by approximate market capitalization, Ethereum (ETH) would be valued at about $350.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is changing hands at $1,401 by press time. Should Citron Research be right about its prospects, it would be on the eve of a 75% price plunge.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, Citron Research is an adamant critic of cryptocurrencies: they slammed Ethereum (ETH) in 2022 and compared it to collapsed exchange FTX. Also, it bashed Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), one of the most overhyped investment tools of the previous bull run.\n\nEthereum (ETH) or OpenAI, Lululemon, Chipotle and Twitter?\n\nWhen regulators investigate the internal processes of Etheruem (ETH), they will find an ordinary \"ICO,\" not \"smart contracts,\" the skeptics added:\n\nWhen the AG opens the Ethereum Network kimono we expect the secrets of the to be just as bad as any shadowy organization with: self dealings, shady ICO transactions, multiple attempts to avoid federal laws of taxation and securities, all while being controlled by a small group of people under a guise of decentralization.\n\nAlso, recent charity initiatives by Vitalik Buterin look suspicious to Citron Research: they might cover tax evasion and look too similar to FTX's patented \"effective altruism.\"\n\nIn order to demonstrate how absurd Ethereum's (ETH) current market capitalization is, Citron Research stressed that it is bigger than the market caps of OpenAI, Lululemon, Twitter and Chipotle combined, or as large as Disney."

        "title": "Next stop Shanghai \u2014 Ethereum's latest milestone approaches - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Ethereum ecosystem will continue its ongoing metamorphosis as the highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade draws near. The latest preeminent smart contract blockchain protocol improvement will activate Ether (ETH) withdrawals from Ethereum\u2019s Beacon Chain.\n\nThe Merge marked a significant milestone for the Ethereum network in 2022, with the blockchain platform shifting from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus. That change introduced validators as the new \u201cminers\u201d of the network, with staking ETH becoming a key component in maintaining the network.\n\nWhile full validators were required to stake 32 ETH to process transactions and add new blocks to the network, the broader ecosystem could stake smaller amounts of ETH to earn a share of rewards \u2014 much like an investor that puts capital into interest-bearing accounts.\n\nThose that locked up ETH to become validators have been unable to withdraw their staked holdings from the Beacon Chain. This changes with the Shanghai upgrade, and is a major reason for the increased fanfare around the latest change to the Ethereum network.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade features a handful of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) in addition to activating staking withdrawals. Cointelegraph reached out to members of the ConsenSys team, the Ethereum Foundation and analytics firm Nansen to unpack all aspects of the upcoming milestone.\n\nCapella x Shanghai = Shapella\n\nThe upcoming changes feature two simultaneous upgrades amalgamated to encompass all facets of the upgrade.\n\nShanghai refers to changes to Ethereum\u2019s execution layer, mainly enabling staked ETH to be deposited to execution layer wallets. The Shanghai upgrade requires a simultaneous change to the Beacon Chain, which has been dubbed Capella.\n\nJustin Florentine, a staff protocol engineer for Hyperledger Besu at ConsenSys, further explained the combined upgrades at the execution and consensus layers:\n\n\u201cIt is doubly named because it is the first simultaneous upgrade of Ethereum\u2019s execution layer and consensus layer, and is highly anticipated because it will enable staked ETH withdrawals.\u201d\n\nWithin the Ethereum ecosystem, execution layer upgrades are named after cities that have hosted Devcon events, while consensus layer upgrades are named after stars. Therefore the upcoming upgrade\u2019s technical name is Shapella, combining Shanghai and Capella.\n\nNevertheless, given the focus on activating staked ETH withdrawals, the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem refers to the looming upgrade as Shanghai. As Beiko explained, Shanghai closes an important chapter in Ethereum\u2019s evolution:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to think of Shanghai as \u2018finishing the Merge\u2019 than related to future upgrades. We didn\u2019t introduce withdrawals during the Merge because that upgrade was already the most complex in Ethereum\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nShanghai in a nutshell\n\nAs has been highlighted by several analysts and Ethereum developers, Shanghai features five EIPs. EIP-4895 will enable users to withdraw from the Ethereum staking contract, which had previously been locked.\n\nReward payments will be sent automatically to withdrawal addresses at regular intervals to validators. Users also have the option to exit staking entirely, which will return their entire validator balance.\n\nEthereum's Shanghai upgrade will unlock 17.6M ETH or over $28 billion. https://t.co/qt8K4Zn55y \u2014 Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) March 2, 2023\n\nValidator balances are maxed out at 32 ETH, meaning that balances above this threshold as a result of rewards do not contribute to the principal amount nor increase the weight of a validator on the network.\n\nEIP-3651, EIP-3855, EIP-3860 and EIP-6049 are the other four elements of the network upgrade. Matt Nelson, Hyperledger Besu and Web3 senior product manager at ConsenSys, highlighted the impact of each of these EIPs.\n\nThe Ethereum protocol prices gas based on how many units of work a function will require of a computer in the network. Changes to Ethereum\u2019s gas costs often adjust to correct overpriced or underpriced operations that have central processing units doing more or less work than anticipated. Warm coinbase (3651), PUSH0 (3855) and the initcode changes (3860) are part of these corrections, according to Nelson.\n\nEIP-3651 changes the price of accessing the coinbase address of a validator that submits and executes transactions. Validators receive fees to their coinbase address for maintaining the network. As Nelson summarized, EIP-3651 looks to lower the gas cost of accessing a coinbase address so that users that submit transactions can pay the validators directly in specific conditions:\n\n\u201cRegardless, this EIP corrects a previous oversight on the cost to access the coinbase address and gives some added benefits to users and developers that open up new use cases.\u201d\n\nEIP-3860 will have a similar effect. Developers submit initcode to the network when deploying a new smart contract. When the initcode is executed, a smart contract \u201cbytecode\u201d is created on-chain, running each time the contract is called, and also runs decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nMetering initcode intends to correct the gas cost required for network nodes to process and deploy the smart contracts specified in the initcode. Validating nodes currently check that contracts are valid on deployment, which costs time and gas to complete, which the initcode EIP aims to improve as Nelson explained:\n\n\u201cEIP-3860 applies a new cost to the initcode that scales in correlation to the size of the \u2018initcode\u2019 to ensure handling that contract creation is costed appropriately.\u201d\n\nLastly, EIP-3855 carries out a \u201cstraightforward and simple change\u201d to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and gas costing. The current state of the EVM does not store a value of zero on the execution stack cheaply, with developers having to use the \u201cexpensive\u201d PUSH1 operation to set a value to zero.\n\nNelson highlighted that gas costs are directly linked to storage space in this instance, meaning the EVM only needs 1 byte to store a single zero, while more than 1 byte is required to store a bigger number from the PUSH1 operation:\n\n\u201cThis change creates a new PUSH0 opcode, which is cost for 1 byte of data storage (less than PUSH1), and will bring gas costs for developers (and ultimately users) down.\u201d\n\nBeiko also reiterated that Ethereum Virtual Machine object format EIPs initially included in the Shanghai upgrade have been removed from the event.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nThe effect of the Shanghai upgrade on cryptocurrency markets and the value of ETH is another pertinent question that is perhaps more difficult to answer.\n\nMichiel Milanovic, a DeFi market analyst at ConsenSys, weighed in on the anticipated effects that Shanghai will have in terms of market supply and value of ETH after the upgrade. Milanovic noted that validators are broadly categorized as short-term or long-term, with the current market split roughly 40/60 respectively, which allows for some simple predictions to be made:\n\n\u201cWe see potential for an increase in the supply of ETH in circulation from long-term validators who are eager to withdraw their accumulated rewards.\u201d\n\nMilanovic also highlighted that the mechanics of withdrawals are engineered with a limit of 16 withdrawals per block and prioritizes short-term validators. The likely outcome is that any market impact from long-term validators will be gradual.\n\nMeanwhile, short-term validators are mostly run by liquid staking providers (LSPs), which are more incentivized to use rewards to spin up new validators. Milanovic said this is mainly due to an expected increased demand once withdrawals are enabled, as it reduces the liquidity risk of staking ETH.\n\n\u201cWe also expect to see more staked ETH tokens issued by these providers to be used across DeFi, which has so far been fairly limited.\u201d\n\nAndrew Thurman, an analyst at blockchain analytics platform Nansen, told Cointelegraph that the upgrade would have significant ramifications for supply flows and price of ETH, given that staking creates fundamental changes to Ethereum\u2019s market structure:\n\n\u201cSome believe that a successful network upgrade will spur more deposits, which would lead to bullish market activity. Others, meanwhile, believe that large portions of the staked ETH supply \u2014 now in excess of 17.5 million ETH \u2014 will be withdrawn and sold.\u201d\n\nSimon Dudley, a ConsenSys senior blockchain protocol engineer, summed up a shift in focus for the Shanghai upgrade to prioritize validator withdrawals. This meant that the implementation of certain EIPs was shifted further down the timeline to limit risks of further delays to the upcoming upgrade:\n\n\u201cFor this reason, there was a strong desire among the core developers to prevent the Shanghai upgrade from becoming overly complicated.\u201d\n\nSeveral of these EIPs have been pushed back to the Cancun upgrade, which will follow Shanghai later in 2023. This includes improvements that will lay the foundation for sharding, namely \u201cProto-Danksharding\u201d EIP-4844.\n\nDudley noted that Shanghai intentionally excluded foundational sharding work, but work on EIP-4844 has continued in parallel. He also concedes that the deployment of Shanghai may well influence the ongoing work on sharding in the months to come:\n\n\u201cShipping the Shanghai upgrade may have an impact on sharding because it frees up developers who were working on Shanghai to focus on the more complicated series of sharding upgrades, known as \u2018The Surge.\u2018\u201d\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade is scheduled to take place on the Ethereum mainnet in early April. The original date was pushed out from March 2023, with the Goerli test network \u2014 which allows for development testing before mainnet deployments \u2014 carrying out the Shapella upgrade on March 14."

        "content": "New York Attorney General Letitia James became the first regulator in the US to claim in court that ethereum is a security in a lawsuit against exchange KuCoin.\n\nSeychelles-based KuCoin has been operating in New York without registering as a securities and commodities broker-dealer, James alleged in the suit.\n\nKuCoin facilitates trading of ETH, James added, \u201ca speculative asset that relies on the efforts of third-party developers in order to provide profit to the holders of ETH.\u201d The exchange should have registered before offering ETH, LUNA and TerraUSD \u2014 all of which fall under the securities classification, according to James.\n\nHowever, the NYAG may not have the final say on the issue. Rostin Behnam of the CFTC told the Senate Agriculture Committee as recently as Wednesday that ETH is in fact a commodity, not a security.\n\n\u201cWe would not have allowed the Ether futures product to be listed on a CFTC exchange if we did not feel strongly that it was a commodity asset,\u201d he explained.\n\nSEC leaders have made similar statements. In 2018, William Hinman, the then-Director of Corporate Finance at the SEC, said in a speech that both bitcoin and ETH are not securities. His justification was that bitcoin is \u201cdecentralized\u201d and ETH, despite its 2014 initial coin offering, had become \u201csufficiently decentralized\u201d over the past four years to make it a non-security.\n\nThe Office of the State Attorney General (OAG) confirmed KuCoin\u2019s alleged unlawful actions because OAG Detective Brian Metz has been transacting on the exchange from New York since May 2022, the lawsuit states.\n\nKuCoin\u2019s lending and staking product, KuCoin Earn, is also an unregistered security offering, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nThe OAG served KuCoin a subpoena on Jan. 10, 2023 but respondents did not reply and failed to appear to testify on the date specified in the subpoena, the lawsuit claims.\n\nThe lawsuit is similar to a suit brought against exchange CoinEx in February alleging the exchange offered trading services for tokens including AMP, LUNA and LBC, all of which the Attorney General\u2019s office says are securities."

SEC Commissioner Peirce attacks agency\u2019s fines against Kraken exchange\n\nFast facts\n\nBehnam, speaking to the Senate Agriculture Committee in a Wednesday hearing, argued that Ethereum had been listed on CFTC exchanges for quite some time, and that creates a \u201cdirect jurisdictional hook\u201d for the agency to police both ETH\u2019s derivatives market and the underlying market.\n\n\u201cWe would not have allowed the Ether futures product to be listed on a CFTC exchange if we did not feel strongly that it was a commodity asset,\u201d he added.\n\nThe debate of whether cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities or commodities has picked up steam among regulators over the past several years, as it would determine which agency assumes chief oversight of the digital assets. The crypto industry has widely voiced support for CFTC as a preferred regulator over the SEC.\n\nAccording to Gensler, proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies such as Etherium pass the Howey Test, which refers to a U.S. Supreme Court case for determining whether a transaction qualifies as a security asset.\n\nBehnam also seemed to diverge from Gensler on stablecoins. While the SEC threatened to charge Paxos for issuing BUSD as an unregistered security last month, Behnam has said that stablecoins should be considered commodities in the absence of new legislation for stablecoins.\n\nSee related article: Paxos ordered to stop minting Binance stablecoin as SEC mulls legal action"

        "title": "4 strategies for staking Ethereum - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Staked Ether (ETH), liquid derivatives \u2014 it\u2019s a whirlygig of smart contracts and big-brain blockchain jargon out there. Nonetheless, there are a few paths through the ETH staking wilderness.\n\nBut remember, anon, as the poet Antonio Machado said, \u201cThere is no path, paths are made by walking\u201d \u2014 which is a fancy way of saying this isn\u2019t financial advice and make sure you do your own research.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the first personality type and the type of ETH staking that might be appropriate.\n\nThe Ox: Slow and steady\n\nThe ox, archetypally, has a strong, dependable personality but can be stubborn and suspicious of new ideas. If that sounds like you, you may be interested in staking directly with Lido.\n\nLido Finance is not only the biggest liquid staking derivative (LSD) protocol but it\u2019s now the biggest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol in the market in terms of total value locked ($9.5 billion) and market capitalization. Lido takes your ETH and stakes it via a team of vetted validators, pooling the yield garnered and distributing it to the validators, the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and investors.\n\nRelated: 3 tips for trading Ethereum this year\n\nIn return for providing ETH to Lido, the DAO issues \u201cstaked ETH\u201d (stETH) tokens, which are like receipts (or \u201cliquid derivatives\u201d) that can be redeemed for your original ETH plus the yield accrued. These tokens, along with those from other LSD protocols, such as Rocket Pool and StakeWise, can be traded on the open market.\n\nThe risks include the fact that the smart contracts holding your ETH might have an undiscovered bug, the DAO might get hacked, or one or more of Lido\u2019s validators might get penalized by Ethereum and have some of their stake removed. All the following strategies contain these risks plus more.\n\nThe Dog: Honest, prudent and a little feisty\n\nIf that sounds like you, maybe look into auto-compounders. For example, adding liquidity to Curve Finance and then locking up the liquidity pool (LP )tokens.\n\nWhen using Curve, I like to use Frax-based tokens, as the two protocols clearly have the hots for one another, and Frax pools often have the best rewards. I passed some of my ETH to Frax to stake and received their LSD called Frax ETH (frxETH).\n\nIt\u2019s in Frax\u2019s interest to maintain a highly liquid market for frxETH, so they run an LP on Curve, which offers up to 5.5% APY on top of the fact that your frxETH is also earning a similar yield. Nice.\n\nETH staked by entity. Source: Nansen\n\nBut some of this APY is paid out in CRV tokens. No shade, but I would rather have ETH, so I hopped on to Aladdin DAO\u2019s Concentrator protocol and gave them my LP tokens, which is like a receipt for my share of the frxETH/ETH pool. They do some wizardry and return 8% APY paid in the underlying assets. Nice.\n\nNaturally, when mixing DeFi protocols into a screwy, money cake, the risks compound with the yield. Here, there are three protocols involved as opposed to one, which could mean the risk is cubed \u2014 but I\u2019m no mathematician.\n\nThe Tiger: Sleek, sophisticated and always in control\n\nThis is perhaps the most sophisticated strategy on the list and should be considered by experienced investors with a large amount of money on the line.\n\nEssentially, the tiger can use a similar strategy to the dog; indeed, there are many LP pools and many compounders across the DeFi world, so finding one that fits shouldn\u2019t be an issue. The issue for tigers is how to hedge their risk.\n\nA few options contracts might be in order. The basic approach would be to buy enough in-the-money put options to act as insurance in the event ETH takes a dive. This might be all that\u2019s needed seeing as the risk of impermanent loss is low, given stETH tends to maintain its peg. (Those wanting to hedge against a depeg event should check out Y2K protocol over on Arbitrum.)\n\nA more optimal strategy would be a \u201cbear call spread,\u201d as that will insure against depreciation but also return some profit in a sideways market.\n\nThe Frog: The airdropping Ponzi lover\n\nThe next strategy is quite popular in some sections of the crypto world. In terms of risk, it\u2019s as about as safe as covering yourself in peanut butter and running at a horde of malicious chimpanzees.\n\nIt involves \u201clooping,\u201d which refers to supplying an asset, borrowing against it, swapping the borrowed money for more of the original asset, and repeating the process.\n\nRelated: 5 tips for investing during a global recession\n\nFrom my own research, I found a yield farm that will give you about 2% yield when you deposit wstETH (the same as stETH but with a harder peg) and allow you to borrow USD Coin (USDC) against it for 3.5% interest.\n\nYou can then swap the USDC for more wstETH and repeat the process, using a 75% loan-to-value ratio, so you don\u2019t get instantly liquidated. If you loop this process five times, you will end up with an APY of over 13% on your wstETH, which itself is earning 5%.\n\nWhatever your personality, it\u2019s possible to find the strategy that works for you, and while it might sound complicated if you have your own decentralized wallet or one on an exchange, most of them can be enacted with just a few clicks. While some bearish types might decry the continuation of overly-ebullient risk-taking, I see the trend in LSDs as part of the birth of a new yield-bearing asset: ETH.\n\nOne day, stETH might even rival the traditional bond market. After all, if governments can run trillion-dollar economies essentially as derivatives of their own bond market, what are a few validator nodes among crypto friends?\n\nNathan Thompson is the lead tech writer for Bybit.

        "content": "ETH might be prone to more sell pressure as Voyager liquidates its holdings.\n\nLong positions shift in favor of shorts as bearish market conditions prevail.\n\nThe ghost of 2022\u2019s crypto contagion is yet to be exorcised. A wave of ETH sell pressure might be on the way courtesy of distraught crypto firm Voyager.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s Ethereum\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nCrypto research company Arkham recently confirmed that voyager has commenced the process of liquidating its digital assets.\n\nThe company filed for bankruptcy after a series of unfortunate market events that led to heavy losses. Initial data reveal that Voyager has slightly over 100,000 ETH in its addresses which will be liquidated to pay creditors.\n\nVoyager is in the process of liquidating their on-chain assets. They are currently sending 7-8 figures of crypto to Wintermute and Coinbase addresses daily. They have over 100K ETH remaining to sell off \u2013 that's over $150M! Arkham will be dropping a deep-dive at 12:00 EST. pic.twitter.com/XhACb5wlxa \u2014 Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) March 9, 2023\n\nThe amount of ETH to be liquidated is worth over $150 million. The report further revealed that the funds will be sent to Coinbase and Wintermute addresses.\n\nThose liquidations may translate to a large amount of sell pressure within the next few days. Such an outcome might trigger a deeper bearish move below $1,500.\n\nETH bears have so far pushed the price down by roughly 12% from its February highs to its $1,527 press time price. However, the Voyager liquidations are not the only bearish concerns for bullish traders.\n\nBullish expectations dimmed for the last few weeks courtesy of anticipated rate hike increases. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell recently reignited those bearish expectations during a recent Senate hearing. He revealed that the FED might have to increase rates to have a better chance at combatting inflation.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nAre ETH derivatives traders taking advantage?\n\nWith the aforementioned problems taking center stage, shorts traders will be looking to take advantage. That is likely the case according to multiple metrics including the futures estimated leverage ratio. The latter has improved over the last two weeks as prices dropped.\n\nThe surge in the futures estimated leverage ratio is particularly evident in the last two days confirming healthy demand for leverage.\n\nThe price has been bearish during the same time. Also, ETH\u2019s open interest metric is on the rise this week and especially in the last two days. A potential sign that there is demand for shorts.\n\nAnother noteworthy observation regarding the state of derivatives is that investors have shifted from long positions likely in favor of shorts.\n\nThe longs liquidation metric shows a drop in liquidations courtesy of the bearish market conditions."

The transaction data is then sent back to Ethereum which helps increase transaction speed and reduce costs.\n\nTo achieve scalability, Scroll\u2019s network uses ZK-rollup technology, specifically its zkEVM (zero-knowledge Ethereum virtual machine). This technology allows Scroll to batch transactions and generate proof that verifies their legitimacy. Once the proof is created, it is broadcast to Ethereum for approval enabling the transactions to be processed more efficiently.\n\nLast week, Scroll launched its zkEVM on the Goerli testnet as it transitioned out of its pre-alpha testnet phase.\n\nThe traction on the pre-alpha testnet was impressive, with Scroll Co-Founder, Sandy Peng, noting in an interview that it had achieved one million unique addresses and 16 million transactions. The mainnet launch is expected to take place in the next three to four months, according to Peng.\n\nAlong with Scroll, several other Ethereum scaling networks use ZK-rollups, such as Polygon, StarkWare, and Matter Labs. According to Peng, who is just one of Scroll\u2019s co-founders, the network\u2019s competitive advantage lies in its three core design principles: community-driven, security-first, and decentralization at every level.\n\nWith the $50 million raised in the latest funding round, Scroll plans to use the capital to continue building its product, launch its mainnet, and expand its ecosystem. The company plans to increase its team size from around 60 to nearly 100 in the near future.\n\n______________________________________\n\nFollow us on Twitter for the latest posts and updates\n\nJoin and interact with our Telegram community\n\n______________________________________\n\n______________________________________"

        "content": "In an interesting development, the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) exerted jurisdictional power over Ethereum and stablecoins while calling them commodities. With this, the CFTC sets a direct confrontation with the U.S. SEC which is keen to treat all cryptocurrencies, except Bitcoin, as securities.\n\nInterestingly, the latest development also shows the non-alignment among US regulators to regulate the crypto space. Addressing the Senate Agriculture Committee on Wednesday, March 8, CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam said:\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cNot withstanding that, they are a commodity, and we have to police that market without a clear direction from Congress that they\u2019re some other type of asset. Based on the cases that we\u2019ve brought around stablecoins, I think that there\u2019s a strong legal argument that USDC and other similar stablecoins would be commodities\u201d.\n\nThe CFTC chair added that the fiat-backed stablecoins don\u2019t work with the expectation of profit and return to its holder. Thus, Behman was hinting that stablecoins shouldn\u2019t fall in the category of securities.\n\nAlso, the CFTC chair cited the investigation into Tether during a 2021 lawsuit. After that, Tether agreed to pay $40 million in settlement charges.\n\nCFTC Chair Calls Ethereum A Commodity\n\nNot only stablecoin, but Behnam also stated that Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency and Bitcoin competitor, is also a commodity. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s been listed on CFTC exchanges for quite some time, and for that reason,\u201d it creates a \u201cdirect jurisdictional hook\u201d for the CFTC to look after the Ethereum derivatives and underlying market.\n\n\u201cWe would not have allowed the Ether futures product to be listed on a CFTC exchange if we did not feel strongly that it was a commodity asset,\u201d added the CFTC chair. Furthermore, he added that his agency has \u201cserious legal defences\u201d to support their case.\n\nAdditionally, Rostin Behnam called out the Congress, seeking more clarity regarding the jurisdictional powers in regulating the crypto space. Behnam also demanded comprehensive regulatory legislation from Congress adding that enforcement alone is not enough to address the risks and consumer protection issues in crypto.\n\n\u201cAnd as our markets have proven, as our regulations have proven over many, many decades, comprehensive regulation can prevent fraud, can prevent manipulation, and can stabilize markets and ultimately protect customers,\u201d he said."

        "content": "Ether (ETH) bulls are facing a do-or-die moment, as the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization that powers the dominant smart-contract-enabled Ethereum blockchain retests key support in the form of its 200-Day Moving Average in the $1,420s.\n\nThe ETH price briefly dipped below the 200DMA to hit $1,408, before regaining some composure to trade closer to $1,450 once again. But ETH/USD is still trading down by around 6% on the day, as per TradingView, and by more than 8% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap.\n\nCryptocurrency markets have been taking a broad beating on Thursday in wake of Wednesday's collapse of crypto-friendly bank Silvergate, which has raised concerns that fellow crypto-friendly financial institutions SVB Financial and Signature Bank might be next.\n\nThe demise of Silvergate is widely viewed as a blow to crypto adoption, given the bank\u2019s prior efforts to better connect the fiat monetary system and crypto exchanges via its now-shuttered 24/7 wire transfer service between the two.\n\nOngoing macro headwinds, with the US dollar and US yields having seen significant upside in recent weeks as markets up their Fed tightening bets, have been compounding things. Crypto traders will be nervously watching Friday\u2019s US jobs report and next week\u2019s US CPI report, which could determine whether or not the Fed hikes interest rates by 25 or 50 bps later this month.The 200DMA is Key to ETH\u2019s Near-term Outlook\n\nThe 200DMA is viewed as a key technical level by most traders. A break above or below it can signal, or act as confirmation of a significant shift in the market\u2019s near-term momentum. Meanwhile, if the market finds strong support at the 200DMA, or fails an attempt to break above it, this is also sometimes interpreted as a signal that the market isn\u2019t ready to shift direction just yet, and may revert to its prior trend.\n\nIndeed, the 200DMA has certainly been a key level for Ethereum in recent months. It acted as a ceiling to the price action twice in 2022 (April and November), twice confirming that the Ether bear market was still in play. Meanwhile, Ether\u2019s decisive break above its 200DMA in mid-January was viewed as a signal that the 2022 bear market might well be over, with the cryptocurrency going on to find strong support above it in mid-February.\n\nIt would be a significant blow to the market\u2019s near-term sentiment if Ethereum was to lose its grip on its 200DMA. Indeed, a swift test of the mid-December highs in the $1,350s would become overwhelmingly likely, with a break below here possibly opening the door to a run lower towards November\u2019s sub-$1,100 lows.\n\nOne saving grace for ETH might come in the form of its 14-Day Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is close to entering over-sold territory, signaling some consolidation might soon be in order."

        "title": "What are Bitcoin ordinals? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "What are Bitcoin NFTs? Bitcoin NFTs \u2014 aka Bitcoin ordinals, aka digital artifacts \u2014 are a way to inscribe digital content on the Bitcoin blockchain. The Bitcoin ordinals protocol was launched in January 2023 by Casey Rodarmor. The protocol allows inscribing of digital content like art onto the Bitcoin blockchain. Unlike nonfungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum and other blockchains, Rodarmor wanted to create an immutable on-chain presence of a piece of art, text or video. The genesis ordinal was a pixel art of a skull that Rodarmor inscribed on Dec. 14, 2022. As the NFT space based on Ethereum\u2019s ERC-721 standard skyrocketed in 2021, Rodarmor, who was a programmer and an artist, saw the opportunity to create a similar yet unique experience on the Bitcoin blockchain. His solution was Bitcoin ordinals, based on ordinal theory, which he went on to implement through 2022. Ordinal theory concerns itself with satoshis, giving them individual identities and allowing them to be tracked, transferred and imbued with meaning. The ordinals hype really kicked off in February 2023, six weeks after the genesis ordinal was created. The number of inscriptions doubled every week for a few weeks. However, the number could have been much higher if the infrastructure to inscribe and trade ordinals had been better planned and executed. The rise of Bitcoin ordinals has seen the Bitcoin network explode in terms of usage, fees and storage space as shown in the chart above. This may also be the first big breakthrough for the Bitcoin application tier and can help move the narrative from a pure \u201cstore of value\u201d to something more utilitarian.\n\nHow do Bitcoin ordinals work? Bitcoin ordinals are based on ordinals theory that essentially has brought life to satoshis (sats) and allows them to be treated as atomic units on the Bitcoin blockchain. Ordinals, in their simplest state, are a numbering scheme for sats. Ordinals theory drives the mechanics behind how Bitcoin ordinals work. Ordinals theory defines satoshis (sats) as the atomic unit that can be identified and traded individually on the Bitcoin network. There are 100 million sats that make up 1 Bitcoin (BTC). Sats are numbered based on the order of mining, and this number, which uniquely identifies a sat, is an ordinal number. Related: Bitcoin vs. Satoshi: Key differences explained By being a unit of transaction, sats can also be inscribed with digital content that make up Bitcoin ordinals. They become immutable digital collectibles that can be transacted on the Bitcoin network using Bitcoin wallets. As per ordinal theory, sats can be attached to security tokens, accounts or stablecoins using ordinal numbers as stable identifiers. Due to the broad set of use cases that ordinals can support, Rodarmor prefers not to equate Bitcoin ordinals with NFTs. The use case of ordinals to number a sat that\u2019s been attached to or inscribed with a JPEG can be called a nonfungible token on the Bitcoin blockchain. Although the ordinal\u2019s use that found market fit is that of NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain, ordinals are much more than just nonfungible tokens.\n\nHow to mine Bitcoin ordinals? Mining, minting or inscribing Bitcoin ordinals are the terms that have been used to refer to this process. Unlike minting NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain, which is a relatively matured process, mining Bitcoin ordinals is a technically complex process and lacks intuitive tools. Bitcoin ordinals, in the initial days, could only be mined by those who ran a Bitcoin node. For tech-savvy users, a Bitcoin node with the ord app, a command line wallet, would be the gateway to mining ordinals. Node operators would load their wallets with some sats to pay for the gas fees and perform an inscribing process on their ordinals. However, no-code ordinal mining applications like the Gamma or the Ordinals Bot aim to allow users to upload the content that they want to inscribe to create their Bitcoin ordinal. The user journey takes them through a payment process using a QR code and is intuitive enough for the less technically gifted. The tools around Bitcoin ordinals are still at a very early stage. It has only been a few months since the genesis ordinals were inscribed. As demand from ordinary users and followers increases, the ecosystem and the tooling should start maturing with more user-friendly journeys.\n\nHow to buy, sell and trade ordinals Much like the process of minting Bitcoin ordinals, the trading process hasn\u2019t had the matured tooling. Yet there are a few tools to trade these digital artifacts. As Bitcoin ordinals grow in popularity, most of the trades have been largely over-the-counter. Collections, such as \u201cPlanetary Ordinals\u201d and \u201cBitcoin Punks,\u201d among the first 1,000 inscriptions were transacted mostly without an NFT marketplace such as OpenSea or Blur. However, tools like the Ordinals Wallet, Hiro and Xverse allow users to buy and sell Bitcoin ordinals. Users can buy some sats within the wallet, using on-ramp payment plugins, and perform the transactions to buy and sell ordinals. The typical user journey involved in buying Bitcoin ordinals using Ordinals Wallet is as follows. Go to ordinalswallet.com Click on \u201cCreate Wallet\u201d Take a backup of the recovery phrase for your wallet Set up a password for wallet access Use the address of the Ordinals Wallet to send some sats to the wallet Go to \u201cCollections\u201d at the top of the page Choose the ordinals collection and the inscription that you would like to buy Buy the ordinal (using the sats in your wallet).\n\nHow have ordinals been perceived by the broader Bitcoin ecosystem? Bitcoin ordinals are a great innovation that can highlight various applications unique to the chain, thereby driving developers to participate and create the tools needed by users. Bitcoin ordinals have certainly seen a hype that potentially peaked sometime in February 2023, based on transaction data. However, the hype around the application tier on the Bitcoin blockchain is just getting started. For instance, Stacks (STX) has seen a rise in price since the ordinals episode warmed up. It is clearly the early days for the Bitcoin ecosystem, but if developers are attracted to the chain, then the network effects between developers and users could come in time for the next crypto cycle. Related: Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem explained However, there are downsides to the way ordinals have been designed. As the inscribed content is all on-chain with ordinals unlike with most Ethereum-based NFTs, the size of the blockchain would increase. As new applications emerge and network utilization and transactions increase, so will the cost of transactions. The other potential impact of Bitcoin ordinals is whether it will affect the fungibility of sats. So far, satoshis have been exchanged with one sat being valued the same as another. With various applications of ordinals, this may not be true in the future. A sat with a Bitcoin Punk inscribed in it could be priced differently. Nonetheless, it would be interesting to see how this narrative evolves over the next few months and years."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nPrivacy-focused web browser Brave announced on Friday the rollout of a new feature that allows users to not only buy cryptocurrency but also now sell it for fiat\u2014including U.S. dollars, euros, and the British pound\u2014without leaving the integrated Brave Wallet.\n\nSelf-custody and the \u201cnot your keys, not your coins\u201d mantra have regained momentum following the collapse of prominent cryptocurrency firms like Celsius and FTX. Brave said it aims to make crypto self-custody easier with this new desktop browser feature, which is powered by crypto on-ramp startup Ramp Network.\n\n\u201cAfter recent events where centralized exchanges mishandled customer funds, it\u2019s more important than ever to offer secure and easy-to-manage self-custody,\u201d the company said in a post announcing the update.\n\nIn Brave\u2019s latest desktop version (v1.49), we\u2019ve added a new off-ramping feature to Brave Wallet, powered by our friends at @RampNetwork! Several cryptocurrencies can now be sold more easily for fiat currencies.

The company said that 38 cryptocurrencies can be sold via the off-ramp service.\n\n\u201cWhile self-custody has grown in popularity over the past decade, the most common way to hold digital currency and tokens remains with centralized exchanges,\u201d the company added. \u201cWe expect to see that shift with innovations in user experience, like the one we are releasing today.\u201d\n\nLaunched in 2016, Brave blocks online advertisements and website trackers by default, making it a popular web browsing tool for privacy-minded individuals. In 2017, Brave added the Basic Attention Token, which rewards users for allowing the browser to show advertisements while they surf the web.\n\nBrave then announced a deal with Ramp in May 2022 that enabled users to buy crypto with fiat currency via the Brave Wallet installed within Brave\u2019s desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLast month, Brave added support for decentralized applications (dapps) using the Solana blockchain on its iOS and Android mobile browsers, allowing users to connect to platforms like the Solana-centric NFT marketplace, Magic Eden."

        "content": "If humans cannot be trusted to do what's best for them, why not pass the responsibility onto something that could - an AI? According to a recent survey conducted by IE University in Madrid, approximately 30 percent of the 25,000 people surveyed said they would be willing to be governed by AI. One of the main reasons for this line of thinking is that people have simply lost faith in their political leaders and believe that machines would be able to make better, fairer, and more rational decisions that would benefit everyone.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, recently sparked a thought-provoking conversation with his tweet: \"What even is an institution?\" Accompanying the tweet was a blog post by Dennis Pourteaux titled \"Institutional Alignment\" with a subtitle of \"Navigating a Disorienting Era with a New Political Matrix.\" This highlights the significance and relevance of institutions in today's rapidly changing world, particularly for disenfranchised youth. The tweet and blog post come at a time when people around the world feel that institutions such as parliament, political parties, bureaucracy, and central banks - that we are used to - are already obsolete. The new paradigm of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) has emerged as a fit for the 21st century digital world.\n\nWith the tweet, Vitalik successfully prompted many people to question whether institutions like the government still serve a valuable purpose in society, as well as the effectiveness of current institutions. If the government is not fulfilling its purpose and delivering value to society, what roles can encryption, artificial intelligence, automation, and cryptocurrency play in shaping and refining our society and its institutions? In a similar fashion, Dennis argues that the disastrous institutional failures of the last decade have brought the question of their value and purpose in society to the forefront. Therefore, it is time for us to take a hard look at the role of government and other institutions in shaping our world and collectively ensure the greater good is delivered to society.\n\nThe Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank of Nepal, has declared a ban on the use of cryptocurrencies. Even though the ban was implemented due to concerns over the absence of proper regulation and the potential for financial fraud, this decision is akin to banning the internet in the 90s. Despite the republican setup portraying itself as one of the most progressive to date, many believe that its policies, and those of most political parties, are outdated and do not align with modern thinking. The current government and political parties can be described as being stuck in the past, failing to keep pace with modern technological advancements. At its core, communism advocates for the abolition of private property and the creation of a classless society in which the means of production are collectively owned and controlled by the people. However, Ethereum enables individuals to create and manage their own digital assets through smart contracts, effectively allowing for the creation of private property within the platform. The interplay between these opposing forces is sure to be intriguing to observe.\n\nThe traditional institutions of democracy, politics, and bureaucracy are at risk of becoming defunct. With the advent of ChatGPT, people's hopes of replacing heads of state with AI have increased. In an article titled \"AI presidents \u2013 a good idea or a disaster waiting to happen?\" Richard van Hooijdonk discusses how the idea of having an AI president is gaining ground as the public becomes increasingly disillusioned with their current political leaders, who have failed to govern people based on facts and common sense, instead letting their emotions influence their decisions. Unfortunately, this is unlikely to change anytime soon. If humans cannot be trusted to do what's best for them, why not pass the responsibility onto something that could - an AI? In any case, government leaders will not be exempt from the upcoming robotic revolution, especially in light of the public's growing disillusionment with those in power.\n\nBrilliant individuals such as Elon Musk and the late Stephen Hawking have echoed this grim vision by repeatedly warning about the existential threat that AI poses to humanity. However, many people seem to have a different outlook. According to a recent survey conducted by IE University in Madrid, approximately 30 percent of the 25,000 people surveyed said they would be willing to be governed by AI. One of the main reasons for this line of thinking is that people have simply lost faith in their political leaders and believe that machines would be able to make better, fairer, and more rational decisions that would benefit everyone.\n\nOne of the big problems with human leaders is that they are selfish mammals, while an artificial intelligence president could be truly altruistic,\" says Bart Selman, a professor of computer science at Cornell University. \"Humans are actually quite poor at making compromises or looking at issues from multiple perspectives. I think there\u2019s a possibility that machines could use psychological theories and behavioral ideas to help us govern and live much more in harmony.\n\nAt first, the idea of having an AI president may seem silly. However, considering that people already trust AI to perform tasks such as driving cars and airplanes, managing bank accounts, and making medical diagnoses, it may not be such a big leap to entrust the governing of a country to an AI.\n\nIn fact, some experts already believe that an AI president could potentially make more rational and impartial decisions, free from the biases and emotions that often influence human leaders. With advancements in technology, we could even envision building a new Nepal on Ethereum network and electing an AI president. While this idea may still seem far-fetched to some, it's worth considering the potential benefits and exploring the possibilities that technology can offer in shaping our future. Ethereum has the potential to disrupt old institutions, particularly those that rely on centralized leadership and control."

        "content": "By EWN \u2022 Published: 09 Mar 2023 \u2022 10:00\n\nThe renowned crypto analyst, and the famous YouTuber Nicholas Marten\u2019s recent price prediction on Ethereum, one of the top cryptocurrencies in the market, has shocked crypto investors across the world.\n\nEthereum faces a gloomy future\n\nEthereum is the second biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation. The currency is, at the time of writing, trading at 68.05% lower than its all-time high value. Though the coin has been in revival mode since the beginning of this year, the price fell below $1,600 due to the silver gate bank\u2019s insolvency crisis. Before that, Ethereum was trying to breach the $1,677 mark but failed to achieve it. On Thursday, Nicholas Martin, founder of the DataDash, one of the largest YouTube channels for cryptocurrencies with over 500K Subscribers, shared his prediction on the Ethereum price action. In his video, he expressed his disappointment over Ethereum not being able to elevate beyond $1,600-$1,800 for multiple months. He also said that if Ethereum sees again what it saw in previous bear markets, it could go down to just a few hundred dollars.\n\nAs his prediction sent shock waves across the crypto community, other crypto analysts predicted Ethereum would rise. Chris Burniske, the founder of the venture firm Placeholder, predicted that if the dollar and rates slip lower, Bitcoin could push through $25,000. And Ethereum could also see another round of fireworks if it follows the trend. Another crypto analyst Guy Turne, who is also the host of YouTube Series Coin bureau, predicts a bright future for Ethereum. Garner said that he can only see Ethereum growing. Over the past 30 days, Ethereum\u2019s price decreased by 6.0%. In the past week alone it lost 4.5% in its price.\n\nFloki Inu \u2013 No Looking Back\n\nIf Floki Vikings, an investors community of Floki Inu meme-coin, has anyone to thank, it\u2019s certainly Elon Musk. The World\u2019s Richest man\u2019s single tweet has skyrocketed its price to surge by 489% since the beginning of this year. It also broke into the list of top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation in late February.\n\nOn 25 June 2021, Elon musk tweeted that he named his Shiba Inu breed dog Floki. It was how the Floki Inu meme-coin came into existence. It has a long relationship with Elon Musk\u2019s family. Floki Inu is the partner of The Million Gardens Movement founded by Elon Musk\u2019s brother Kimbel Musk. On February 15, right after Elon Musk published his dog Floki\u2019s pic posing as the CEO of Twitter, the meme-coin market witnessed a sudden surge in price. Floki Inu utilised the hype and became the top gainer. Since then Floki Inu has been outperforming the crypto analysts\u2019 predictions. It also surpassed its rivals Dogecoin and Shiba Inu by trading volume. With an ambitious goal of becoming the world\u2019s most used cryptocurrency, it released a road map for 2023 consisting of 4 phases and 18 amazing plans. It has recently secured a strategic marketing partnership with the Real Madrid Football club. As part of this partnership, Floki Inu\u2019s sign will be displayed during Real Madrid Home Games.\n\nBig Eyes Coin \u2013 $31 Million and Counting\n\nBig Eyes Coin, a cat-themed, cryptocurrency is reaching new heights in the meme-coin market filled with Dogs. Big Eyes Coin\u2019s presale was rolled out in 2022. In the beginning, a single unit of BIG token cost only $0.0001. Now in stage 12 of the presale, a single unit of BIG token costs 0.00049, which is a 390% rise from the initial price. The price will be increased to $0.0006 at launch. Big Eyes Coin is planning to donate 5% of its total supply to save oceans. It promised not to impose any tax or fee. Big Eyes Coin is planning to launch an NFT called Sushi crew where users can buy exclusive digital assets. It also made a few notable charities to help children, pet animals, elderly people, and the people of Turkey who lost their livelihood in the earthquake. Big Eyes\u2019 unique features and concern for the community have been bringing more investors to its ecosystem. It has raised more than 31 million dollars in the presale. To encourage investors, it has recently released 5 types of loot boxes at different prices which could offer the BIG tokens worth up to one million dollars. As each and every loot box has BIG tokens worth equal to or more than what they cost to open, the investors won\u2019t lose even a penny.

The Ethereum co-founder had ditched other meme coins like MOPS, SHIK, and CULT. Cumulatively, these tokens earned him over $300,000.\n\nMeanwhile, Buterin\u2019s latest warning has negatively impacted the meme coin\u2019s price performance.

According to on-chain data, the deployer also burnt 50 trillion of the token\u2019s supply.\n\nBlockchain analytical firm Arkham Intelligence reported the transfer and questioned the motive of the deployer. According to the firm, Buterin had recently sold off unsolicited tokens sent to his addresses.\n\nDingo is an ERC-20 token designed to burn 10% of the tokens involved in every transaction. According to its website, the burn function would help to control its overall supply and increase its value over time.\n\nIts five-phase roadmap showed it was supposed to reach 100,000 holders by the fourth quarter of 2022. However, it has only 444 holders as of press time.\n\nThe website showed no further information about its use case or other details. The token was previously deployed on Binance Smart Chain, according to tweets seen on its Twitter page.\n\nThe token is available on the decentralized exchange Uniswap.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Notwithstanding the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) strict regulations, the crypto market grew by more than $80 billion as we entered the third quarter of February. Following a difficult first and second quarter, crypto markets are finally showing signs of a bullish run and increasing pace, ignoring any barriers or negative news.\n\nBig Eyes Coin, the newest meme coin in the cryptoverse, is leading the way, having raised over $31.5 million in its presale. Only time will tell when and where this adorable cat-themed coin will come to an end. On the other hand, there are two crypto titans, Bitcoin and Ethereum. The market was controlled by Bitcoin, with consumers exchanging other cryptocurrencies into BTC following SEC laws. Players like Cardano are also throwing their hats in the proverbial ring.\n\nBitcoin is here to rule:\n\nAs we entered the second half of February, Bitcoin (BTC), the king of cryptocurrencies, achieved a peak of $24,755, the highest since June of 2022. Once many users and investors switched their capital away from other cryptocurrencies, and towards the crypto beast, the value of BTC skyrocketed. BTC was priced at $24,551 at the time of writing, a gain of about 10% in the previous 24 hours, with a market capitalization of $473.59 billion.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto, an anonymous entity, introduced Bitcoin as an alternate method of payment in 2009 with the goal of creating an interconnected and autonomous digital currency network. To validate transactions, Bitcoin employs a Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism, and BTC, Bitcoin\u2019s digital currency, has a finite amount of just 21 million coins.\n\nCan Ethereum Hit $1.8K in BTC?\n\nEthereum (ETH), like Bitcoin, saw advances and hit $1,700, an increase of more than 8%. Only time will tell if Ether\u2019s value can reach $1,800. Ethereum\u2019s last value of $1,800 was in August 2022. At the time of writing, ETH was worth $1,683 and had a market value of $205.75 billion.\n\nEthereum was introduced in 2015 as a De-Fi coin and a platform for decentralized apps and smart contracts. In comparison to Bitcoin, it is the most desired platform in the world by developers and consumers due to its scalability, security, and usability. Ethereum initially employed the Proof-of-Work technique but switched to PoS (Proof-of-Stake) in 2022 because it is faster, uses less energy, and is more secure.\n\nCardano\u2019s Long-Term Blockchain\n\nCardano is a blockchain that employs proof-of-stake (ADA). As a result, the energy efficiency of the coin is improved. The classic proof-of-work consensus approach necessitates additional mining and transaction time. The blockchain was developed in 2017, and four years later, the \u201cAlonzo\u201d hard fork was introduced. As a result, its smart contract functionality exists. Smart contracts are difficult to hack due to their encrypted security. The proof-of-stake system allows for highly fast, efficient, and exact transactions!\n\nCardano\u2019s commitment to transaction security has aided its development into a powerful blockchain platform. The speed and efficiency of its transactions, as well as its smart contract, contribute to its environmental friendliness! Investing has a high potential for success.\n\nBig Eyes That Strain to the Horizon:\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is a community-owned, cat-themed meme coin that offers profitable utilities and use cases in addition to an attempt to enhance the Earth\u2019s ecology. Big Eyes Coin has surpassed $31 million in its presale and now intends to reach $50 million by the end of its presale. This new meme coin with a cat mascot is a promising crypto with enormous potential and the ability to become the world\u2019s largest meme coin.\n\nBig Eyes have run a series of promotional campaigns in recent weeks, including a tattoo competition, discount codes, and now, an amazing set of loot box offers that are too good to miss.\n\nWhile some online critics have called the currency and its authenticity into doubt, the community-led token has proven time and time again that it\u2019s here to stay and has a bright future ahead of it, quelling any concerns being spread by these crypto pundits.\n\nWith amazing innovations in tech, accessibility, a user-friendly design, NFTs, loot boxes, and more, Big Eyes Coin is striving to become a crypto mainstay.\n\nFor more information:\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Dogetti, Bitcoin, and Ethereum: Post-Silvergate Price Prediction - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "On Wednesday, Silvergate bank publicly spoke about its problems with the SEC regarding a filing that would delay its financial report. With this, the crypto bank decided to press the breaks on the payments to its exchange, the Silvergate Exchange Network. This spiked fear and uncertainty in investors, causing a bank run that led to a loss of $1 billion!\n\nSilvergate Bank is the main payment network provider for numerous cryptocurrencies, so the bank run has had a severe impact on the industry. Silvergate is also well known for working with FTX and Alameda Research and, in effect, also experienced an enormous loss of $14 billion in 2022. How will the bank\u2019s recent problems with the SEC affect some of crypto\u2019s top coins and tokens?\n\nDETI\u2019s Recent Developments\n\nThe top crypto meme coin, Dogetti (DETI), is yet to be officially released. However, through a strong community ethos and enticing features, the token has already managed to rake in a mass \u201cfamily\u201d of investors.\n\nWhile DETI is still in its early presale stages, they have already secured an official contract address as of last week. A contract address is an address created by cryptographic technologies which allow cryptocurrencies to be bought and sold. This is an exciting step toward the dog-themed coin becoming an established part of the industry. In addition, the DETI team has released a limited launch code (WISEGUY25) which offers 25% off all tokens during stage 1 of the presale.\n\nGiven that Dogetti is still in its presale, most investors assume the dust will have settled regarding the Silvergate damage before the token\u2019s launch. Furthermore, crypto analysts predict that these unfortunate events will have little to no impact on DETI.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Bear March\n\nOn account of the Silvergate complications, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) latest price action has abolished $20 billion of its market cap, which now stands at $431 billion. The coin\u2019s price fell from $23,800 to $22,300, and many other coins, such as Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC), encountered losses between 4% to 5%. BTC is now facing major selling pressure following a decision taken by Coinbase and Paxos from Silvergate to alternative banking partners.\n\nOn the 4th of March, BTC was hanging on around $22,350. However, if it weren\u2019t for recent events, analysts predict that BTC would have reached 25k this week! If matters get worse, the coin may even break $22k and plummet near $21,600. BTC is now floating at around $22,400, but if it manages to break $23k, we may see a bull run for BTC once again.\n\nCan Ethereum Recover from this?\n\nThere was another major bank run for crypto investors on Saturday, leaving Ethereum (ETH) to slip by 0.19%, in addition to its 4.73% drop on Friday. This reduced the coin\u2019s price to $1,567, below the point of 1,600 for the first time since mid-February! This morning, ETH experienced a high of $1,578 but struggled against its resistance level, which stands at $1,630.\n\nConsidering the latest Silvergate bank drama, the ETH charts indicate more bear runs before things improve. However, Ethereum has managed to hold a price of above $1,550, which it hasn\u2019t fallen below since the beginning of February, and even then, it quickly recovered back up to $1,600 in a mere few days.\n\nSo even if ETH is bound to face further price drops, there\u2019s a good chance that it will recover soon enough. With that, we can only hope that the possible incoming bankruptcy of Silvergate bank doesn\u2019t affect other crypto-related firms in its wake. All things considered, crypto analysts still believe that ETH is likely to return to $1,700 once things have cooled down. They also predict that by the end of 2023, the coin may likely break past $2,000 and be on its way to a full recovery!\n\nClick the Following Links to Learn More About Dogetti!\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Bitcoin vs Ethereum: How Is Ethereum Different From Bitcoin - ClearTax",
        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum are the Xbox and Playstation of the cryptocurrency world. They are two of the most popular cryptocurrencies whose contribution to the sector's growth has been enormous. From price to the premise, their concepts are unique but with a few things in common.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nUsers under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto first created the concept of Bitcoin in 2008. Bitcoin allows users to manage a currency not controlled by any financial institution or government.\n\nA set of decentralised networks runs the Bitcoin blockchain software with its own rules to which every participant must agree. These rules determine how every transaction works. It was the first cryptocurrency based on DLT (Decentralized Ledger Technology) blockchain.\n\nThe Bitcoin network processes multiple data sets and converts them into hashes through an algorithm called the SHA-256 hash function. It processes data and converts them into long strings of numbers.\n\nBitcoin's mining and consensus mechanism ensures that users cannot spend their funds twice, enabling it to stand out as a tamper-proof currency. Moreover, Bitcoin also features a store of value, which users can stock as an asset and use over time. Bitcoin's hassle-free mode of transactions has increased its popularity over time.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nThe Ethereum network was launched in July 2015, and its co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, published its white paper in 2013. Ethereum uses its blockchain to create a decentralised computer, like interacting with applications and making transactions based on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe main goal of Ethereum was to decentralise everything on the internet. This cryptocurrency operates on its programming language and solidity and is surging daily on the ladders of innovation. For instance, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and decentralised financial service applications are examples of what developers can create using Ethereum-based smart contracts.\n\nUsers must pay a fee for creating smart contracts, paying for transactions, and using decentralised apps in Ether. Today, as this ambitious cryptocurrency's value is increasing, it is also being used to store value.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum: Overview\n\nQuite often, these two biggies of the crypto world are compared against each other. However, you should know that Bitcoin and Ethereum are merely systems, whilst the cryptocurrencies these two systems use are called bitcoin (small letter b) and Ether. Their respective stock symbols are:\n\nbitcoin: BTC\n\nEther: ETH\n\nMain takeaways: Bitcoin v/s Ethereum\n\nParticulars Bitcoin Ethereum Currency v/s platform A feasible alternative to traditional currency. Acts as a medium of exchange and store of value. A platform that runs programmatic applications and contracts via Ether. Launch date January 2009 July 2015 Price** \u00a323,756 \u00a31,575 Market cap** \u00a3478 bn \u00a3191 bn Consensus mechanism Proof of work Proof of stake Block time 10 minutes 12 to 14 seconds Max supply 21 million Unlimited\n\n**Please note that the abovementioned data is current as of 27th May 2022 and is subject to change over time.\n\nSpeaking of how similar these two systems are, both use blockchain technology to record and validate all their transactions. However, Ethereum's upcoming change plans differ concerning accessibility, sustainability, and speed.\n\nBefore discussing their major difference in the consensus mechanism, let's understand what a consensus mechanism is.\n\nConsensus Mechanism\n\nA consensus mechanism refers to a computer algorithm which mainly aims at solving the problem of 'double spending' by making any blockchain viable. BTC is a string of codes that can be infinitely copied. In other words, you can become as wealthy as you want to be by simply making multiple copies of your BTC.\n\nHowever, the reality is very different. Every time you spend a bitcoin, its copy gets destroyed, and the recipient on the other side of the transaction receives a new version. A record of all details of transactions is maintained on a distributed ledger, where the world can see that you have spent your BTC.\n\nThe ledger holders' consensus would clearly indicate the fake one if you attempt to spend a copied version. Counterfeiting even one such transaction would be difficult, and then you have to modify each transaction since all of them are correlated.\n\nTo work around this, you either have to control at least 51% of that network's mining hash rate or have massive computing power. Therefore, an attack as such on Bitcoin or Ethereum is probable but still hypothetical. From the very beginning, Bitcoin and Ethereum used distinct consensus mechanisms. Bitcoin uses 'proof of work' while Ethereum aims at using a 'proof of stake' consensus mechanism.\n\nBitcoin: Proof of Work\n\nProof of work (PoW) is the decentralised consensus mechanism, where network members put feasible amounts of effort to deter anyone from gaming the system. It is mainly used in cryptocurrency mining for mining new tokens and validating transactions.\n\nProof of Work: Understanding\n\n'Work' involves estimating a unique 64 characters string that is alphanumeric as accurately as possible. Within a 10-minute window, anyone making the maximum number of guesses per second has the highest chance of being chosen as a validator.\n\nProof of Work: Criticism\n\nEarlier, hobbyists sitting at home used to do this 'work'. However, the processing power required to get it done has increased exponentially. As a result, only those able to afford the necessary power and hardware can get this work done today, like companies and specialist mining organisations.\n\nThe energy required for computer hardware is enormous and is the sole reason behind Bitcoin's criticism. Currently, it uses 19 terawatt hours (TWh) every year, nearly the amount used by an entire country like Norway.\n\nEthereum: Proof of Stake\n\nThis consensus mechanism initiates processing transactions and helps create new blocks in the blockchain based on the total number of validator stakes coins. The PoS structure has less potential for a network attack thanks to its well-designed structure.\n\nUnder Proof of Stake, the next block writer is selected randomly, with nodes having larger stake positions being assigned with higher odds.\n\nProof of Stake: Understanding\n\nUnder proof of stake (PoS), owners themself offer coins as collateral and are given a chance to validate blocks. As a result, coin owners with 'stake coins' are eligible to become 'validators'; however, they should own a specific amount of stake coins. Next, a random validator is selected who gets to do the 'mining' unlike the competition-based mechanism as in the proof of work.\n\nProof of Work v/s Proof of Stake: Main Takeaways"

        "title": "Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM): Features, Purpose And Benefits - ClearTax",
        "content": "The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a computation engine which functions as a decentralised computer with abundant applications that can be implemented. It is the central framework in the Ethereum blockchain. The EVM is one entity upheld by numerous connected computers that perform instructions in large numbers. Every instruction comprises an operator and its operands.\n\nWhat is the EVM?\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a dynamic and isolated virtual stack implanted entirely throughout the Ethereum node. It is responsible for implementing contract bytecode. After writing them in complex languages, like Solidity, contracts are compiled to EVM bytecode. Many programming languages like C++, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, and Python execute Ethereum Virtual Machines efficiently.\n\nFeatures of EVM\n\nThe following are the essential features of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. They are:\n\nEVM acts as a virtual machine and the foundation of the total operating system of Ethereum.\n\nThere are two types of accounts for Ethereum under the EVM. They are Contract Accounts and Externally Owned Accounts (EOA).\n\nThe EVM arranges numerous additional utilities to the blockchain so users can enjoy hassle-free running on the system.\n\nAll nodes of Ethereum perform on EVM to keep consensus throughout the blockchain.\n\nEVM enables a special code to run on Ethereum, known as smart contracts.\n\nThe code inside EVM is entirely inaccessible to the system, network, or other areas.\n\nIt is a part of the Ethereum network that focuses on executing transactions alongside smart contract deployment. In the meantime, smart contracts keep contract accounts in smart wallets.\n\nWhat is the purpose of the EVM?\n\nThe main power of EVM is to decide the comprehensive state of Ethereum for every block in a blockchain. Ethereum is quite similar to other blockchain-based networks. It has its native cryptocurrency (Ether) and uses a distributed ledger that includes autonomous computers (nodes) for recording, synchronising and running transactions in particular electronic ledgers.\n\nHowever, Ethereum retains some special functions due to its smart contract capability. In other words, the state of Ethereum is a huge database that records every Ether (ETH) account and balance.\n\nHow is gas related to the performance of EVM?\n\nAny transaction on Ethereum symbolises an Ether (ETH) transaction. Transactions require fees. When it comes to Ethereum, it denotes its fees as gas, which fuels decentralised applications.\n\nIn case of high networking activity, gas fees increase. However, if the execution fails, you can stay sure of getting the pre-paid amount. An execution will end soon if it runs out of gas.\n\nBenefits of EVM\n\nThere are certain benefits of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. They are:\n\nAnyone can create their decentralised application via EVM as it has no involvement of security obstacles.\n\nNowadays, NFTs or Non-Fungible Tokens, are gaining a lot of fame in cryptocurrency. With adequate knowledge about these financial securities, you can create digital art and sell it on a decentralised market using EVMs.\n\nDrawbacks of EVM\n\nUnlike advantages, there are some disadvantages of the Ethereum virtual machine. Let\u2019s see them too:\n\nIf the owners of these services discontinue using Ethereum, the nodes will stop doing any function, thereby crumbling the entire network.\n\nUsing an EVM requires certain technical proficiency. Hence, it is limited to those who do not know to code. Only a few applications have Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) that only enable some selected individuals to gain the advantage of NFTs.\n\nEthereum is also called a \u2018global/world computer\u2019 as all Ethereum network nodes successfully run the EVM and implement similar instructions. It makes all other nodes reach a consensus about the system's state."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency has been gaining prominence for several years now, both within the financial community and beyond. It\u2019s not a straightforward market to breach successfully, and knowing when to invest or what to invest in is tricky in itself. The traditional giants, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), have been solid investments for many years, but the recent Silvergate Bank crisis has shown vulnerability. Sometimes, there is a potential for profits in new lesser-known cryptos, and one such coin is SignUp Token which presents people with an unmissable opportunity before it goes live.\n\nSignUp Token Launches Onto The Market Through Email Registration\n\nMost of the time, when crypto prepares to launch into the market, it does so through the usual avenues, be it presales or an ICO. This is a fine setting for many cryptos to assess the kind of impact they are likely to have on the market, but other ways ought to be explored. SignUp Token is a brilliant example of that.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t need a presale or any kind of prepayment. Instead, all it pushes for is one million email sign-ups. What are the potential benefits for someone who signs up for this? Once SignUp Token reaches one million, it enters the crypto exchanges, and those who have registered their emails will be the first to know, allowing them to engage with the crypto with significant advantages with strong potential for huge profits.\n\nWe\u2019ve all skipped past the endless streams of marketing emails, but this is not an email you want to miss out on. SignUp Token could be the new exciting crypto in 2023, and it\u2019s offering everyone an unmissable opportunity to buy its tokens at an advantage when it finally enters the crypto market. Don\u2019t spurn the golden chance to be one of the one million who register their emails.\n\nNo presale. Nothing to pay for whilst it\u2019s yet to debut. All you need to do to put yourself in the position of eventually acquiring a potentially lucrative coin is register your email. That sounds too good an opportunity to pass up.\n\nSilvergate Troubles Cause Slump In Bitcoin Price\n\nThe Silvergate Bank has been providing a payment network to many cryptos for many years. But recently, it sunk into a crisis authored in part by the FTX crisis that saw Silvergate lose 60% of its deposits in one quarter when customers departed with around $8.1bn. This prompted a loss of confidence in Silvergate and saw many cryptos either distance themselves or entirely sever ties.\n\nThe effect on Bitcoin was clear. Its price went down by 4.5% as it fell from $23,500 to $22,259 whilst losing the not-so-small matter of \u00a320bn from its market cap.\n\nThis underlines that, like a lot of other digital currencies, Bitcoin isn\u2019t immune to experiencing blowbacks from external events. But it\u2019s worth pointing out that Bitcoin is resilient to volatile trends within the market and has consistently stayed ahead of the competition. Its price has definitely been shaken by the Silvergate Bank crisis, but it is a coin built on tenacity, and that is why many investors persistently place their faith in it.\n\nEthereum Has Resilience To Recover From Silvergate Crisis\n\nBitcoin wasn\u2019t the only major coin to be affected by what happened at Silvergate. The market\u2019s second-largest coin, Ethereum (ETH), was also affected by the crisis as its price fell by 4.6% while its market cap dropped to just over $193 billion.\n\nBut just as this shouldn\u2019t put anyone off from investing in Bitcoin, it has to be emphasised that Ethereum is one of the most resilient crypto platforms that investors love for a good reason. Why is this? It\u2019s because price falls and bearish market moods are not uncommon. The crypto market regularly encounters turbulence, but what is striking about Ethereum is its capacity to remain one of the biggest coins despite this. Its prominence has grown within the market due to the growing use of DeFi platforms and decentralised applications, with many developers using Ethereum\u2019s platforms to build their applications.\n\nIts utility and resilience make it one of the most coveted coins in the market for a reason.\n\nTo conclude, SignUp Token is utilising cost-free for everyone to get on board with its new token. It doesn\u2019t cost you anything to register your email, and you get the significant advantage of knowing when it will debut on the market before everyone else.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in what it\u2019s offering, have a look below!\n\nSignUp Token Website: https://signuptoken.com/\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The question that is probably on many investors\u2019 minds is: Is the bottom here or is the crypto winter only just beginning?\n\nThe total market cap for all cryptocurrencies had peaked at US$2.97 trillion in November 2021 but had declined nearly 66% to about US$1 trillion as of the time of writing.\n\nYet signs of economic recovery and expectations for the US Federal Reserve\u2019s (FED) rate hikes to reduce has caused Bitcoin prices to claw back some losses, rising 35% since 1 January 2023.\n\nHowever, crypto is still not out of the woods yet as regulatory bodies around the world including the US SEC are taking an increasingly hawkish approach towards crypto, signaling greater regulation for the industry and a taming of the crypto \u201cwild west\u201d.\n\nWith both bull and bear forces tugging on the market, we will look at five major trends that will shape the crypto world in 2023.\n\nRead Also: Top 10 Worst Performing Cryptocurrencies In 2022 (With At Least 1 Billion Market Cap)\n\n#1 The FED Seems Poised To Hike Rates A Few More Times In 2023\n\nAs Crypto Street and Wall Street become increasingly co-related in recent years, moves in the stock market are often magnified in the crypto market due to its nature as a risk-on asset. For much of 2022, the crypto world had been closely watching the actions of the US FED.\n\nRecent data have revealed inflation easing in the US. The inflation rate which reached a high of 9% in June 2022, has since dropped to 6.5% in Dec 2022.\n\nImage Credit: CNBC; US Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 consumer price index\n\nHowever, the FED considers this reduction to be inadequate and is striving to bring inflation back to its target of 2% weighted average.\n\nBelow are the tentatively scheduled meetings in 2023, where they will decide on whether to raise interest rates or not. We will just have to watch the FED\u2019s actions in the coming months.\n\nJanuary 31-February 1 (Concluded. Raised rates by 25 basis point, bringing interest rates to a target range of 4.5%-4.75% )\n\nMarch 21-22\n\nMay 2-3\n\nJune 13-14\n\nJuly 25-26\n\nSeptember 19-20\n\nOctober 31-November 1\n\nDecember 12-13\n\nWith a dropping inflation rate as well as a strong labour market, expectations are for the FED\u2019s rate hikes to reduce. Cautious optimism has caused Bitcoin prices to recover in prices since this year.\n\n#2 Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Hard Fork Could Disrupt Crypto Markets\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has been up nearly 30% since the start of 2023. Though a key reason was due to the improving economic climate, another main factor was the upcoming Shanghai Hard Fork in March.\n\nSo what is the Shanghai Hard Fork (and why was it given that name)?\n\nA crypto Hard Fork is basically a huge update to the blockchain, and historically Ethereum forks had always been named after famous cities (both historical and modern) such as Istanbul, Atlantis, and Constantinople.\n\nImage Credit: Visual Capitalist\n\nThe Shanghai Hard Fork will be the biggest Ethereum upgrade since The Merge in September 2022. The Shanghai upgrade will include Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4895. This basically allows the withdrawal of staked ETH, which at the time of writing is worth more than US$26 billion, making it the most staked crypto in terms of market cap.\n\nThis change raised concern due to the fact that validators could potentially withdraw $26 billion ETH, leading to a wave of selling pressure. However, the opposing view is that with greater liquidity, more validators would be incentivised to stake, soaking up excess liquidity.\n\nIn fact, the percentage of staked ETH to total ETH Supply is only around 14%, which is low compared to other major Proof-of-Stake chains such as Cardano, Solana (both about 70%), and BNB (around 97%). With the new liquidity, ETH staking may in fact even increase post-Shanghai to 30-50% according to analysts.\n\nRegardless of whether there will be more or less ETH being staked, the market is betting that some of the biggest winners of Shanghai will be staking services like Lido Finance (LDO) and Rocketpool (RPL). The price of LDO is up ~140% since 1 Jan 2023, while RPL is up ~138%.\n\nRead Also: [Airdrops, Hard Forks, Play-To-Earn, Staking, Yield Farming] 8 Ways You Can Earn Cryptocurrencies For Free And Why They Are Free In The First Place\n\n#3 Impressive ETH Layer 2 Growth Show No Signs Of Abating\n\nThe amount of gas used by Ethereum Layer 2s has increased by nearly 400% in the past seven months, and the percentage of gas used by Layer 2s compared to the rest of the Ethereum Network continues to show an uptrend.\n\nLayer 2 ETH gas units increased from 1 billion in July 2022 to 4 billion in February 2023 / Image Credit: Dune Analytics\n\nIn Nov 2022, Ethereum Layer 2 Network Gas Usage hit all-time highs as transactions on Layer 2s increased substantially. Though the amount of gas has since dropped due to the market downturn, the percentage of ETH used for Layer 2s as compared to the rest of the Network continues to grow.\n\n\n\nPercentage of gas used by Layer 2s hovered between 1-2% for much of 2021 and 2022. It is now 4%. / Image Credit: Dune Analytics\n\nWith the growth of Web 3 and decentralised applications, ETH Layer 2\u2019s demand increases. Some of the most popular Layer 2 crypto solutions include Polygon, Loopring, Arbitrum, and Optimism.\n\nMost of the popular Layer 2s are built upon Ethereum, and despite the ongoing updates to the Ethereum blockchain, Layer 2s remain a key factor in scaling. The Ethereum Foundation has stated: \u201cThe Ethereum ecosystem is firmly aligned that Layer 2 scaling is the only way to solve the scalability trilemma while remaining decentralised and secure.\u201d\n\nLayer 2 solutions on other blockchains such as Bitcoin Lightning Network also showed explosive growth last year. 2022 was the year that saw a 300% increase in Bitcoin locked within the network as compared to mid 2021, spurred by factors such as growth of Bitcoin peer-to-peer payments. The Lightning Network is currently in use in El Salvador, and is one of the most popular Layer 2 solutions for Bitcoin.\n\n#4 Increased Regulations Will Shape The Crypto Market\n\nFor years, governments around the world have been looking to subject crypto markets to greater financial regulations, but with the recent crypto contagion, these efforts have only heightened.\n\n2022 was the biggest year ever for crypto hacking, with $3.8 billion stolen from cryptocurrency businesses, according to a Chainalysis report.\n\n\n\nImage Credit: Chainalysis\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is leading the push to subject the crypto market to greater regulation, increasing scrutiny on Initial Coin Offerings and new tokens, calling for greater scrutiny on exchanges, and ramping up probes into Wall Street firms\u2019 dealings with crypto, amongst other measures.\n\nChina has famously banned crypto mining in May 2021, followed by an outright ban in September 2021. Last year, it rolled out its own Central Bank Digital Currency officially in August.\n\nThe EU has launched various Anti Money Laundering (AML) directives in recent years, tightening Know Your Customer (KYC) and standard reporting requirements. In September 2020, the EU also proposed the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) framework aimed at protecting consumers, which was passed into law in 2022.\n\nFirms themselves have also started to release Proof-of-Reserve in order to regain customer trust in the wake of the FTX collapse. These firms include Binance, Bitfinex, OKX, Huobi, Gate.io, and Kraken.\n\nThe recent years also saw an increase in the number of crypto custody providers due to firms\u2019 need to navigate complex crypto regulations in their respective jurisdictions as well as increasing crypto security risks.\n\n\n\nImage Credit: Blockdata\n\nRead Also: Insights: Key Lessons From The Recent FTX Fallout For Crypto Investors\n\n#5 Institutional Investors Back Away From Crypto and DeFi (For Now)\n\nFollowing the rapid collapse of FTX, institutional investors have slowed down their pace of investing in the crypto markets.

Once the economy starts to turn for the better, institutional investing may yet again return to crypto. And whilst institutional interest in crypto waxes and wanes, longterm crypto plans for many Wall Street firms continue to stand, signaling that institutions believe that crypto is here to stay and are willing to invest in it.\n\nFinance giants Blackrock, Nasdaq, BNY Mellon, JPMorgan and Citadel are all launching various crypto services or investing in partners, and unveiled plans in Q3 and Q4 last year.\n\nThese institutions have signaled that they are primarily tapping digital assets as an alternative investment to stocks and bonds. There is also a growing sense among institutions that digital assets are here to stay, according to co-founder and CEO of Digital Asset Capital Management Richard Galvin.\n\nThe crypto market looks set to recover in the not-too-distant future (though that may take months, or at worst years). While some of these trends may cool the markets in the short term, for the long term interest and market fundamentals are only going to improve as a result.\n\nWhilst prices are low, investors may even consider Dollar Cost Averaging into crypto.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency world has seen significant growth and development over the past few years, with new projects emerging daily. Among the most exciting are Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Orbeon Protocol (ORBN). Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is currently in its presale stage, surging by 1988% so far.\n\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\n\nLitecoin (LTC)\n\nLitecoin (LTC) is a decentralized proof of work cryptocurrency meant as a faster and cheaper alternative to Bitcoin.\n\nAs one of the oldest crypto projects out there, Litecoin (LTC) shares many similarities with Bitcoin (BTC). Still, Litecoin (LTC) has several distinguishing features from Bitcoin (BTC). These unique features make Litecoin (LTC) better suited for smaller payments.\n\nFor one, Litecoin (LTC) transactions are four times faster than Bitcoin (BTC), and have lower fees. Additionally, Litecoin (LTC) has a higher supply limit, with a maximum of 84 million LTC compared to Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) 21 million.\n\nSince the FTX crash last year, there has been a resurgence in interest in Litecoin (LTC). Investors considered \u201cdigital silver\u201d Litecoin (LTC) a safer bet than many other crypto projects. When decentralization is at a premium, Litecoin (LTC) will probably do well.\n\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum (ETH) is the largest blockchain network for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). These innovative features attracted a strong community to Ethereum (ETH), with thousands of projects.\n\nThe primary advantage of Ethereum (ETH) is its smart contract capabilities, which enable developers to build decentralized applications that run on the blockchain. This feature has led to the growth of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, which has seen significant growth in recent years.\n\nUnlike other smart contract networks, the size of Ethereum (ETH) means that it is relatively decentralized. This helps independent developers mitigate the platform risk. So far, Ethereum (ETH) was the go-to network for most serious dApp developers.\n\nHigh gas fees and slow transactions have slowed the adoption of Ethereum (ETH). However, the latest upgrades are tackling those issues. The popularity for Ethereum (ETH) will likely continue to grow as the network expands its capabilities and features.\n\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\n\nOrbeon Protocol (ORBN)\n\nOrbeon Protocol (ORBN) is a unique investment platform disrupting the crowdfunding and venture capital industries. The Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) platform enables anyone to invest in some of the most promising early-stage companies on a fractional basis.\n\nThe Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) platform allows startups to raise funds and engage their communities by issuing reward and equity-based NFTs. Additionally, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) uses blockchain as an additional layer of security for investors.\n\nORBN is currently in its presale phase and has seen tremendous price growth in recent weeks. So far, the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) token jumped 1988%. Experts believe it could go as high as 6000% before the end of the presale.\n\nGoing forward, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) could play a significant role in the growth of the decentralized finance (DeFi) and startup sector. This makes Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) a project to watch in the coming weeks.\n\nFind Out More About The Orbeon Protocol Presale\n\nWebsite: https://orbeonprotocol.com/\n\nPresale: https://presale.orbeonprotocol.com/register\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

        "title": "Crypto Experts Name Ethereum The Queen Of Digital Currency But Let's Talk About Its Security - Harlem World Magazine",
        "content": "The last few years have shown that the jurisdiction of digital currencies knows no limit as several sectors welcomed cryptocurrencies and the blockchain into operations.\n\nInvesting in digital currencies with a history of beating bear markets and secure networks is crucial for organisations seeking ways to maintain exposure and competitiveness in the market. Ethereum and Bitcoin are the most well-known digital currencies that fit the bill. Those looking for a platform where to buy Ethereum or Bitcoin can use Binance because it provides information about cryptocurrencies\u2019 evolution and helps them figure out when the ideal moment to invest in a coin is.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have been on the crypto market for more than two cycles, enabling investors to earn high returns on investments in bull markets. People considering investing in cryptocurrency at the moment most likely think about buying one of the two largest digital currencies by market cap. However, considering the high price of Bitcoin, many turn to Ethereum. Ethereum is also a proven bear market beater because it spiked in value in the next bull market. A lot has changed for the most popular altcoin since the last bear market, most notably the Merge that allowed it to switch to a proof-of-stake consensus. This eco-friendly consensus allows the blockchain to save 99.95% more energy. Considering the present global focus on energy efficiency, ETH ensured its longevity and survival in the sector. But this feature isn\u2019t enough to convince investors to add it to their portfolios.\n\nIs Ethereum secure?\n\nThe potential of a cryptocurrency like Ethereum doesn\u2019t count for much if it lacks advanced security features. So, the question is, how secure is the decentralised network that is Ethereum?\n\nAccording to experts, Ethereum is more secure than most innovative blockchain solutions. Still, if you use an exchange or decentralised app that lacks proper security, your data and finances can get compromised.\n\nSign-Up for our Newsletter * Select list(s) to subscribe to Harlem World Magazine Example: Yes, I would like to receive emails from Harlem World Magazine.

Emails are serviced by Constant Contact\n\nSuppose you\u2019re new to the subject; asking if Ethereum is a secure cryptocurrency is similar to asking if laptops and smartphones are secure; you should be more specific if you want a meaningful answer. Ethereum is a blockchain, like all the other cryptocurrencies available on the market. However, its functionality is different from the other digital currencies because it was created to enable the execution of smart contracts. So if you want to find out if Ethereum is secure, you need to find answers to more specific questions like Is the Ethereum blockchain secure? Are smart contracts secure? Can the Ethereum network be hacked?\n\nUnfortunately, people lacking cryptocurrency knowledge will look at a hack resulting from an issue with smart contracts and conclude the entire Ethereum blockchain is unsafe. This is a bad interference because you cannot say that the entire Internet is unsecure only because cybercriminals can use it to send scam emails.\n\nWhy do some believe Ethereum lacks security?\n\nThe matters of security have become more complicated since Layer 2 networks have increased in popularity because they add a new dimension to the Ethereum network and bring their own security concerns. Layer 2 ecosystems are different from the Ethereum blockchain because they\u2019re meant to remove some of the computational strain the main blockchain features and boost its scalability.\n\nTo understand if Ethereum is secure, it\u2019s best to focus on its infrastructure as a blockchain and its smart contracts \u2013 even if the Layer 2 networks have a huge impact on its security processes.\n\nBlockchain hacks don\u2019t have much to do with Ethereum\u2019s security\n\nMost of the high-profile hacks and security issues the news reported aren\u2019t the result of a vulnerability in the Ethereum blockchain. They\u2019re connected with the infrastructure of smart contracts because blockchain as technology in itself is one of the most reliable solutions known.\n\nBlockchain (whether we talk about Ethereum or bitcoin) has been created to prevent anyone from seizing control over the ecosystem or adding counterfeit blocks to the ecosystem. Ethereum miners receive economic incentives \u2013 minted ether, transactions fees \u2013 for mined blocks, which encourages them to act in the blockchain\u2019s best interest instead of trying to manipulate it.\n\nThe proof-of-stake consensus is expected to boost Ethereum\u2019s security\n\nEveryone knows that Ethereum completed the Merge, meaning that it transitioned from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus. The previous mining model encouraged miners to solve complex mathematical problems to create new blocks to add to the blockchain. But the new model requires validators to take turns on the ecosystem to propose and validate blocks. They receive incentives according to the number of coins the node is staking.\n\nEthereum supporters state that the switch can increase Ethereum\u2019s security. For someone to take control over a proof-of-stake blockchain, they need to control 51% of the computing power. But for someone to control a proof-of-stake blockchain, they need to control over 51% of the total number of coin stakes. Therefore, holding this amount of ETH is more expensive than controlling 51% of computing power.\n\nStatistics show that a 1-hour attack on Ethereum using the proof-of-work consensus would cost $282,539. Ethereum\u2019s current market cap is over $38 billion, so someone would need around $20 billion to control 51% of ETH. An attack in the present conditions would cost millions.\n\nSmart contracts\u2019 flexibility could harm Ethereum\u2019s security\n\nWhen it comes to digital currencies, there\u2019s a trade-off between decentralisation and security because the more decentralised a system is, the higher the risk of a security breach. Smart contracts are such a trade-off example. Solidity \u2013 the programming languages of the blockchain were created with flexibility in mind. Ethereum enables developers to design virtually any kind of token or DApp they want. This is one of the reasons why Ethereum hosts some of the most prominent projects in the sector but has also experienced several security breaches over the years.\n\nThe programming language\u2019s flexibility shouldn\u2019t be blamed for the blockchain\u2019s vulnerability, but its semantics because they make it challenging for some programmers to master. It\u2019s hard for some developers to learn programming languages because while they look similar to JavaScript, they behave differently.\n\nGiven the presented info, we can conclude that Ethereum is a secure blockchain, but its users\u2019 choices can make them vulnerable to breaches."

        "content": "The latest statement passed by Rostin Benham over the nature of Ethereum (ETH), created a new controversy among US lawmakers.\n\nIn the United States (US), there are two dominant financial market regulatory bodies. These are the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC agency regulates the crypto market with more dominance over the CFTC agency. The CFTC agency regulates derivatives markets, including futures, options, and swaps. The SEC agency ensures the creation of fair markets, corporate disclosure, protecting Investors, and enforcing the law.\n\nOn 8 March 2023, Before the Senate Agriculture Committee, the CFTC chair Rostin Benham said that he believes Ethereum is security and should be listed on CFTC exchanges.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made the argument that Ethereum is a commodity\u2026it\u2019s been listed on CFTC exchanges for quite some time,\u201d Benham said.\n\nAccording to Benham, his opinion on the nature of Ethereum will provide a basic support for the CFTC agency to regulate the derivatives markets trading ETH & also underlying products.\n\nFurther on the stablecoins, Benham said that Stablecoins should also be a commodity in his opinion despite the comprehensive dedicated regulatory framework on the stablecoin companies.\n\n\u201cI agree \u2026 that stablecoins are and should be \u2026 regulated financial instruments. Notwithstanding a regulatory framework around stablecoin, they\u2019re going to be commodities in my view,\u201d the CFTC chair said.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, SEC chairman Gary Gensler stated that all cryptocurrencies are securities, except Bitcoin. For that statement, Gensler faced huge criticism from the crypto proponents.\n\nHowever many experts said that we should not focus on the statement passed by the SEC chairman because it was his personal opinion on the nature of cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn the present time, the SEC agency fighting against the San Francisco headquartered Fintech company Ripple over the nature of the XRP token, as a priority case in its to do list. In Dec 2020, the SEC initiated the case against Ripple executives & Ripple labs over the sale of more than $1.3 billion worth of unregistered securities sale.\n\nRead also: Despite several crypto companies\u2019 fallout, people trust centralized crypto custody services"

        "title": "The Shanghai Upgrade: A Game-Changer for Ethereum? - Blockzeit",
        "content": "The Shanghai upgrade for Ethereum is currently targeted for this March. This will enable staking withdrawals for the first time since people began staking their ETH in 2020. Unlike other PoS networks like Cosmos, with a fixed withdrawal period for stakers, set at 21 days, Ethereum\u2019s is dynamic based on how many validators are exiting at a given time.\n\nSo, how does the Shanghai upgrade come into play?\n\nThe Ethereum\u2019s Overview\n\nThe Ethereum network is scalable, programmable, and decentralized. For many investors, it is the blockchain of choice.\n\nEthereum started with a proof of work (PoW) mechanism. Later, it began its journey toward proof of stake (PoS) with the launch of the Beacon Chain in December 2020. Later on, the Ethereum Merge happened after a series of testnet checks, making the Ethereum network a PoS one.\n\nStaking, for many investors, is a crucial way of making money as it helps put assets to work and earn passive income without selling assets. However, in the Ethereum network, one issue still was hectic; cost. This is because the minimum amount required for staking to join the Beacon Chain was 32 ETH.\n\nAs a result, a series of projects began working on a more accessible way to stake on Ethereum, dubbed liquid staking.\n\nThe Shanghai Upgrade\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade is likely one of the most significant events for the Ethereum blockchain. Currently planned for the first half of 2023, the upgrade is set to bring several improvements to Ethereum.\n\nShanghai comprises of several upgrades, but the most impactful one allows ETH stakers to remove their staked ETH and the rewards accrued.\n\nThis change is established in the EIP-4895 proposal.\n\nSeveral other proposals related to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Object Format (EOF). This software component of all EVM-compatible chains contains more than 120 operation codes that give decentralized programmability to the networks.\n\nHowever, one of the proposals that will not be present in the March 2023 release is EIP-4844. The proposal introduces proto-danksharding and sets up the highly anticipated sharding upgrade due in 2024 for the Ethereum network.\n\nThe most likely advantage of the upgrade is the spur it brings on the case of innovations regarding direct staking and liquid staking solutions. Additionally, it will bring on ETH\u2019s position on the table as a staking protocol.\n\nTakeaway\n\nThere are preparations already set for the upgrade. The most visible is Metamask integrating Lido and Rocket Pool, some of the most popular liquid-staking options. Once the Shanghai upgrade is complete, this will enable their users to stake ETH directly from their Metamask wallets.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade is an essential milestone in Ethereum\u2019s ongoing evolution. As the network continues to grow, we can be sure to expect even more exciting developments in the future."

        "title": "Know These Things About Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) - Inventiva",
        "content": "To understand how the Ethereum blockchain works, it is essential to get acquainted with its core component \u2013 the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The EVM provides a secure, trustless infrastructure for developers to compile and execute smart contracts on Ethereum. Before investing in Ethereum, you may also read about some top advantages of Ethereum.\n\nFor many skilled coders in the blockchain space, this technology is one of the biggest advantages that make launching DeFi platforms like DApps, tokens, and DEXs on Ethereum so appealing. If you\u2019re new to all this tech talk but still curious about what makes the EVM appealing, here\u2019s an overview of what it does and how it functions.\n\nWhat is an Ethereum Virtual Machine?\n\nEthereum Blockchain has developed an important component known as Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It is the main platform of blockchain that permits the operation of codes for smart contracts. It\u2019s authored in Solidity programming language and also operates on Ethereum as a runtime atmosphere for several distributed applications (DApps).\n\nThe EVM\u2019s adaptability as well as support for smart contracts is exactly what makes it well-known among programmers. Additionally, it enables you to create applications in your chosen programming language and run them in the safe environment of Ethereum. The EVM can identify the condition of the bzzlockchain after including each block, apart from utilising smart contracts. It\u2019s developed like a state machine which enables it to execute specific immutable operations to figure out the state of Ethereum.\n\nHow does Ethereum work?\n\nEthereum Virtual Machine functions like a sandbox or a private Virtual computer in which you could create dApps. These dapps are created in various programming languages and are maintained in the Ethereum blockchain. Inside the Ethereum system, the EVM can be incorporated into every node. It produces a cloud environment including all guidelines as well as conditions for the delivery of code. This guarantees the instant implementation of smart contracts.\n\nCode may be made in scripting languages such as Solidity, Python, Vyper or maybe some EVM-compatible language. The EVM can\u2019t, though, handle all programming languages. Firstly, it transforms the code into \u201cbytecode\u201d computer-understandable code. Additionally, since operations are carried out in a sandbox atmosphere, you can change them at any time without impacting your data or programs.\n\nThis will make the computer more dependable and secure for getting started on any DeFi project. At the front end of carrying out smart contracts, various functions happen. It includes 2 primary features:\n\nGas Fee Calculation\n\nFor every transaction which the EVM performs there\u2019s a charge. It makes sure, though, that the device doesn\u2019t have downtime and functions seamlessly. If you wish to utilize the highly effective EVM tool to put into action a smart contract, you have to purchase the gas. Gas is utilized as a unit of work for Ethereum. It sets the price of calculation for a transaction in the system. This is the reason the EVM computes its gas charges along with the backdrop of good contract execution. Additionally, it internally calculates commissions for completed orders. Thus, whenever you verify a transaction, your wallet is going to ask you for a little amount of Ether as reimbursement for gas. The payment generally depends upon the specifics of a smart contract.\n\nEVM using OpCode\n\nThe EVM is a Turing Complete platform, which means that it can operate any complicated algorithm. This particular ability is the result of the Opcode because it lets EVM carry out instructions for smart contracts. Opcodes are a group of more than 140 instructive operations that assist EVM in executing codes. These actions are Push, Call, and ISZERO mSTORE among others. It additionally utilizes other actions to be able to work with various blockchains."
