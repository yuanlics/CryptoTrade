        "title": "Could Ethereum Hit $3,500 in 2023? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "At a recent price of about $1,270, Ethereum (ETH -0.01%) is down nearly 75% from the all-time high of $4,891.70 it touched in November 2021. That stratospheric level now seems like a distant memory for Ethereum investors, who enter 2023 uncertain of what's next for the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. Is a potential comeback in the making?\n\nAlthough the idea that it could nearly triple in value this year to $3,500 might sound outlandish, Ethereum was actually trading around $3,500 as recently as April 2022. But it will be a long, difficult path for it to regain that level in 2023.\n\nForget about The Merge\n\nIf there was one catalyst that was supposed to send Ethereum's price skyrocketing in 2022, it was The Merge -- the cryptocurrency's much-anticipated transition from a proof-of-work blockchain to a proof-of-stake blockchain. Although The Merge went as planned from a technical standpoint, it didn't from an investment perspective. The meltdown of crypto exchange FTX (FTT 3.89%) occurred about two months after The Merge took place, so we'll never really know what could have been. But we do know what did happen: Ethereum is down by nearly 25% since Sept. 15, the date The Merge took place.\n\nAs a result, investors can basically forget about any price gains driven by that transition this year. Yes, Ethereum has a number of updates planned for the year ahead that will improve the blockchain and increase its efficiency, but none of them will be really earth-shattering. Maybe it's just me, but I can't see Ethereum soaring in price on the basis of hype about \"rollups\" and \"sharding.\" So we're going to have to look elsewhere for catalysts that are capable of driving major gains.\n\nFlight to quality\n\nOne overarching investment trend that could help to buoy the prospects of Ethereum is a flight to quality. If 2022 was the year that investors got burned by holding risky, volatile assets, then 2023 is likely to be the year that they embrace less risky assets. While it might sound crazy to categorize Ethereum as less risky in any way, the fact remains that among cryptocurrencies, there are two that are generally considered to be quality assets on a relative basis: Bitcoin (BTC 0.48%) and Ethereum.\n\nAs a result, we can expect that many investors will continue to move their money out of more speculative tokens and into those two trusted coins. The big picture is that institutional investors increasingly consider crypto to be an asset class all its own, and as such, we can expect a flow of institutional money into Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nEven at the retail investor level, I think we are going to see money flowing into Ethereum as new investment products and trading platforms are created. One good example is the new Fidelity Crypto platform unveiled by Fidelity Investments in late November, which lets investors trade Bitcoin and Ethereum commission-free.\n\nCreation of new market opportunities\n\nEven this flight to quality, however, probably will not be enough to drive a three-fold return for Ethereum in 2023. What would also be needed is the introduction of a brand-new market opportunity that completely changes the game. Given that Ethereum has been a leader when it comes to creating new market categories such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), and the metaverse, that type of innovation is not out of the question.\n\nOne new market opportunity that has potential involves customer loyalty programs running on the blockchain. Polygon (MATIC -1.32%), a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, is at the forefront of this trend. The brand-new Starbucks (SBUX 0.36%) Odyssey loyalty program, running on Polygon, just launched in early December. Through this program, customers can earn extras such as NFTs and Web3 experiences. If other brands follow suit, this could jump-start a larger trend and generate renewed interest in Ethereum as the go-to blockchain for brands and consumer-facing businesses.\n\nAnother market opportunity involves crypto payments. According to Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, this is where all the work that has been done to increase transaction speeds and improve scalability for the Ethereum blockchain can really pay off. Basically, once blockchains can consistently process large amounts of transactions faster than the Visa (V 1.20%) payments network, we could see a migration of payments to the blockchain. As might be imagined, this would be a huge win for Ethereum. Encouragingly, Visa released a technical paper at the end of 2022 that outlined the possibility of recurring payments being handled via Ethereum one day.\n\nThe outlook for Ethereum\n\nI'm cautiously optimistic about Ethereum in 2023. The overall macroeconomic outlook continues to weigh heavily on all cryptos, and it will be a tough task for Ethereum to surge in value if the economy tips into recession.\n\nHowever, I'm super-bullish on Ethereum for the long term. The blockchain continues to generate fantastic new market opportunities on a regular basis. If any of these new opportunities turn out to be home runs, then Ethereum might just be a three-bagger in 2023."

        "title": "Cryptocurrencies To Watch: Week of January 9 - Investopedia",
        "content": "Keep an Eye on These Coins\n\nIs the crypto market on the verge of breaking out of the doldrums? That\u2019s not certain, but the asset class looks healthier than last week. Most cryptocurrencies are above where they were last week, with green across the board. However, there\u2019s no guarantee that the tokens will continue upward. What is notable is that a handful of assets clearly outperformed the market last week.\n\nThis week we examine Solana (SOL), Ethereum Classic (ETC), The Graph (GRT), Optimism (OP), Decentraland (MANA), and Ethereum (ETH). In selecting these assets, we have considered several factors, including, but not limited to, positive technical developments, significant news events, and noticeable changes in price.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways The price of Solana (SOL) increased by a massive 45% in the past week as a result of the Solana-based BONK token becoming popular.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) saw its token increase by 30% in the past seven days after a favorable turnaround in the network\u2019s hashrate.\n\nThe Graph (GRT) experienced a 22% increase in the past week after news of its ecosystem\u2019s expansion and the number of indexers increased.\n\nThe Optimism (OP) token went up by over 35% in a week as a result of bullish sentiment related to its rollups.\n\nDecentraland\u2019s MANA token increased by approximately 29% in the past seven days, thanks to an increased interest in gaming and metaverse tokens, as well as it is represented in CME\u2019s new reference rates.\n\nEthereum (ETH) also saw a sizable jump of 10% over the week, thanks to the upcoming Shanghai upgrade.\n\n\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nSolana (SOL) was one of the biggest gainers in the past seven days, with the coin increasing by about 45%. This was partly due to the fact that the Solana-based meme coin, BONK, took the crypto community storm, with its own valuation increasing by 1000% in the last week.Solana\u2019s active user base also increased significantly over the week. The number of daily active wallets increased by 3x from pre-FTX levels.\n\nThe Solona blockchain network made news last week due to its efforts to rebuild itself after the collapse of FTX. The Solana Foundation, which holds approximately 3.24 million shares of FTX Trading LTD common stock, along with about 3.43 million FTT tokens and 134.54 million SRM tokens from the decentralized exchange (DEX), Project Serum, is now trying to move forward without Sam Bankman-Fried's help.\n\nSolana is currently priced at around $16.55 after having started last week at $11.30.\n\nSolona (TradingView).\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC)\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) saw its price increase by 30% after a critical change in the hash rate of the network. In simple terms, the hash rate refers to how fast a crypto mining machine works.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum Classic's hash rate is 107.58 TH/s, up nearly 10% from its December 2022 low. A faster mining speed means more transactions on the network, and therefore more profitability.\n\nETC is currently trading for around $21.26.\n\n\n\nEthereum Classic (TradingView).\n\nThe Graph (GRT)\n\nThe Graph (GRT) saw its token increase by 22% in price as a result of an increase in the number of projects working on the network. It also saw a rise in the number of indexers, which likely also contributed to the price growth. The token is now priced at around $0.07.\n\nThere are currently over 600 decentralized apps, or DApps, on The Graph, while there are over 300 indexers. Together, this helps boost the ecosystem and increases usability.\n\n\n\nThe Graph (TradingView).\n\nOptimism (OP)\n\nOptimism\u2019s OP token increased by 35% as a result of all the positive sentiment surrounding the rollup technology. The Layer 2 scaling solution is one of the most well-known projects implementing the rollup technology. Through these scaling solutions, blockchain networks are made faster and more secure.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also provided some details on rollup scaling, which no doubt added brought some attention to Optimism. It is among those scaling projects which will have an eventful 2023. The OP token is currently valued at around $1.31.\n\nOptimism (TradingView).\n\nDecentraland (MANA)\n\nMetaverses and blockchain-based gaming remain on the radar of investors, and Decentraland\u2019s MANA token is a strong beneficiary of the revival in this niche. The token went up by 29% consequently.\n\nThe CME Group revealed that it would add reference rates and real-time indexes for metaverse crypto assets, with Decentraland being one of them. This might be primarily the reason why the MANA token shot up in value. The token started last week at $0.31. It is currently priced at around $0.40.\n\n\n\nDecentraland (TradingView).\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nThe market\u2019s second largest token, Ether, saw its price increase by 10% as the network is about to experience its Shanghai upgrade. The latter will be a major shift for Ethereum, as it will allow staked tokens to be unstaked.\n\nEthereum introduced staking when it switched to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism last year. However, those who staked could not unlock their tokens until the Shanghai upgrade was introduced. This major upgrade will change that and mark another major moment in Ethereum\u2019s history. ETH started last week at $1,216. It is now hovering at around $1,322.\n\n\n\nEthereum (TradingView).\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other initial coin offerings (ICOs) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Might Lead New Rally, Start Expected in Q1, 2023: Opinion - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nProminent Bitcoin (BTC) mining entrepreneur Jiang Zhuoer, CEO of BTC.TOP and B.TOP mining firms, shared his forecast on the first phase of the next bullish rally in crypto. While the run might start in a few months, its scenario might be different to what we witnessed in previous cycles.\n\nOptimistic and pessimistic forecasts by industry veteran\n\nMr. Jiang Zhuoer took to Twitter to share his estimations of the prospects of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in the next bullish rally. He attempts to compare the ongoing cycle with those of 2014 and 2018. As such, he publishes two scenarios for cryptocurrency bulls, an optimistic and a pessimistic one.\n\n1/ I would like to discuss our current position in the Bitcoin market cycle.\n\nStarting from the previous Bitcoin (BTC) all-time high (ATH) and ending with the next halving, #BTC crossed the bear market bottom in 2014 and 2018, respectively. pic.twitter.com/IAq4U7q0iJ \u2014 Jiang Zhuoer BTC.TOP (@JiangZhuoer) January 9, 2023\n\nIf the November 2022 decline triggered by the FTX drama was the ultimate bottom of this cycle, the four-year period remains valid for every major cycle in crypto. As such, the potential collapse of Digital Currency Group, which is being widely discussed in the media, is already priced in and will not affect the price significantly.\n\nThen, while the new upsurge is almost imminent, the market can follow one of two scenarios. If the optimistic one plays out, the rally might start two months after the last phase of \"sideways\" moves.\n\nThe pessimistic scenario, meanwhile, opens the road to an eight-month painful \"sideways\" period. Thus, cryptocurrency capitalization might start its new rally in early Q4, 2023.\n\nFirst Ethereum (ETH), then Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nAlso, Mr. Jiang Zhuoer is fascinated by the prospects of Ethereum (ETH) compared with Bitcoin (BTC). As this is the first time, Ethereum (ETH) meets with EIP-1559 activated and on a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus, Ethereum (ETH) is exposed to trivial inflation:\n\nMore specifically, looking at the data of Ethereum (ETH), the inflation rate was 3.59% when ETH was in Proof-of-Work (POW). Bitcoin's inflation rate is 1.72%. Even after the bear market, with the inactive coin burning, the ETH inflation rate is as low as 0.01%.\n\nBesides that, Ethereum's (ETH) price decline during this bearish cycle is only 80% of that of the largest cryptocurrency, which is yet another indicator of Ether's maturity as an asset.\n\nAs such, Ethereum (ETH) will start rising earlier than Bitcoin (BTC); the first spike can be expected between March and May 2023, Mr. Jiang Zhuoer says.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, in March, 2022, Mr. Jiang Zhuoer criticised \"permanent bulls\" for their lack of common sense."

        "content": "Investors sentiment toward Ethereum improved of late.\n\nKey metrics such as the MVRV ratio and long/short difference suggest that there may be some selling pressure on Ethereum in the coming days.\n\nEthereum faced a lot of volatility over the past year, especially after the merge. However, according to Santiment\u2019s recent data, the tides may soon turn in Ethereum\u2019s favor as investor sentiment appears to be highly bullish at the moment.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nThe public sentiment\n\nAccording to the data provided by Santiment, traders were interested in Ethereum over other cryptocurrencies such as BNB, BTC, and ADA.\n\nWell, interestingly enough, the sentiment for Ethereum remained positive despite the declining activity on the social front. According to data provided by LunarCrush, the number of social mentions and engagements for Ethereum decreased materially over the last month.\n\nTo be precise, social mentions for Ethereum decreased by 33.7% and the number of engagements fell by 12.8%.\n\nNow, the behavior of the retail and big-pocket investors was in alignment with the bullish demand. Based on the information provided by glassnode, the number of addresses holding more than 10 Ethereum, at the time of writing, reached an all-time high of 352,360 addresses.\n\nIn fact, the number of non-zero addresses on the Ethereum network grew considerably over the last few months. During press time, this metric was at 92.36 million.\n\nAlong with the investors, the validators also supported the network. Based on data provided by Staking Rewards, the number of validators on Ethereum grew by 2.3% over the last 30 days. At press time, there were 496,462 validators.\n\nOne of the reasons for the growing number of validators on the network can be increased revenue. Over the past week, the revenue generated by these validators increased by 14.24%. And at press time, the overall revenue generated by the validators was $959.18M.\n\nThe \u201cTrade\u201d off\n\nThat said, the derivative market of Ethereum had a lot of things going against it.\n\nAccording to data provided by coinglass, the number of short positions being taken against Ethereum increased substantially over the last few days. At the time of writing, 51.53% of all positions taken against ETH were short.\n\nMeanwhile, the MVRV ratio for Ethereum increased over the last last two weeks, according to information provided by Santiment. This suggested that most Ethereum holders would profit if they decided to sell.\n\nA lot of these Ethereum holders who were profitable were short-term holders. This was indicated by the negative long/short difference for Ethereum.\n\nAre your ETH holdings flashing green? Check the profit calculator\n\nSource: Santiment"

        "content": "The sight of a forlorn and dishevelled Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, being led away in handcuffs in the Bahamas last month aptly embodied the current plight of an entire industry. After numerous scandals and trillions of dollars wiped off its value in 2022, crypto finds itself on its knees with the vultures circling. Systemic change now seems unavoidable, and the industry can either take the bull by the horns or be forced to by the red-tape mafia waiting in the wings.\n\nCryptocurrency mining rigs at a facility in Quebec, Canada. (Photo by James MacDonald/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nA good place to start would be the industry\u2019s outsized environmental footprint, which currently exceeds that of many countries. Yet some within the industry are rising to the challenge. In September 2022, Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency platform (\u2018ether\u2019 is second only to Bitcoin), almost nullified its power demand through an event called the Merge. By replacing the blockchain\u2019s \u201cproof-of-work\u201d (PoW) mining mechanism with an alternative coined \u201cproof-of-stake\u201d (PoS), Ethereum cut its electricity consumption by 99.84% \u2013 a reduction equivalent to the annual power requirements of Ireland or Austria.\n\nAlthough energy consumption is just one part of crypto\u2019s environmental problems, and it would be premature to declare the Merge an outright victory, the move does offer cryptocurrencies everywhere a possible path towards environmental sustainability. Whether they choose to follow it is another matter.\n\nAlthough estimates of the total environmental footprint of all crypto assets vary, it is thought that the electricity demand of Bitcoin alone exceeded 13GW, with an associated carbon footprint of more than 65 million tonnes of CO2 (MtCO2), in 2021. That demand is just over half that of all global data centres combined and represents nearly 0.5% of global electricity consumption. The associated carbon footprint is bigger than the global CO2 reduction created by all electric vehicles. On top of that, other cryptocurrencies were estimated \u2013 prior to the Merge \u2013 to add another 50% to Bitcoin\u2019s energy demand.\n\nOne recent study indicated that Bitcoin has a greater climate impact than gold mining. The research from the University of New Mexico judged the climate cost of various commodities in relation to their overall market capitalisation. The results found that the climate damage from producing Bitcoin has averaged 35% of its market value over the past five years, peaking at 82% in 2020. That is comparable to 33% for beef production or 46% for natural gas extraction.\n\n\u201cSince Ethereum\u2019s Merge, I would hazard an educated guess that Bitcoin now represents 90% of crypto\u2019s environmental footprint,\u201d says Alex de Vries, a digital currencies researcher at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\n\nHow well do you really know your competitors?

Crypto also has an issue with electronic waste. The hardware used to mine the various cryptocurrencies regularly becomes obsolete. In fact, the annual electronic waste of Bitcoin is equivalent to that of the Netherlands. \u201cAnd that is just Bitcoin,\u201d says Carmine Russo, formerly a visiting researcher at the Centre for Climate Finance & Investment at Imperial College Business School, UK, and now a PhD researcher at the University of Naples Federico II, Italy. \u201cBut consider that there are more than 20,000 cryptocurrencies out there!\u201d\n\nShifting to green crypto\n\nAs crypto\u2019s climate impact has become ever more apparent, regulators have begun sharpening their knives. In some places, the bloodletting has already started. In spring 2021, the Chinese government cited environmental concerns as it introduced a countrywide ban on crypto mining \u2013 effectively evicting most of Bitcoin\u2019s global mining network.\n\nIn March 2022, the European Parliament toyed with a similar ban but settled instead on additional environmental disclosures for crypto asset service providers from 2024. However, the European Central Bank wrote in a July report that it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that European authorities would not pursue crypto mining further \u2013 and potentially ban it outright.\n\nIn the US, the state of New York is poised to introduce new legislation banning cryptocurrency miners from receiving behind-the-meter power from fossil fuel plants. However, mine operators that have already filed paperwork for new or renewal permits are exempt, including the controversial Greenidge Generating Station on the western shore of Seneca Lake. Additionally, a report from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy released in September 2022 recommended promoting \u201cenvironmentally responsible crypto-asset technologies\u201d. Legislation to \u201climit or eliminate\u201d energy-intensive cryptocurrency mining should be introduced if other measures prove ineffective, it added.\n\nChange is also coming from within. In 2021, a coalition of around 200 cryptocurrencies teamed up with think tank RMI to create the Crypto Climate Accord. The signatories agreed to reduce the carbon emissions from their electricity consumption to net zero by 2030, partly using carbon offsets but also by switching all blockchain technology to renewable energy sources by 2025 and using energy tracking tools such as so-called green hashtags.\n\nArguably the largest shot in the arm for the green crypto agenda, however, has come from Ethereum\u2019s Merge \u2013 a small change in the software that effectively replaces the energy-intensive mining process altogether. Blockchains, the technology underlying cryptocurrency, are literal chains of blocks of data; updates to the network are processed within those blocks, which are then added to the end of the chain. No single party is in charge of that process; instead, anyone can proffer their computer hardware to assist in the block-creation process, with a reward offered for every created block. The difference between Bitcoin\u2019s PoW and Ethereum\u2019s PoS relates to how new blocks are added to the blockchain.\n\nWith PoW, the block-creation process is purposely made computationally challenging. New blocks are added to the blockchain only when a \u201cminer\u201d obtains a valid PoW, which can be achieved only through an iterative process of trial and error that is \u201cbest described as a numeric guessing game\u201d, says de Vries. A correct guess completes a block, allowing the winner to add it to the blockchain and claim the reward. The more guesses the miner can generate, the greater their chance of winning. The process repeats indefinitely after every newly created block. \u201cBefore the Merge, the Ethereum network generated around 900 billion of these guesses every second of the day, non-stop,\u201d says de Vries.\n\nWith PoS, however, the network does not incentivise participants, or \u201cminters\u201d, to compete on computational power to create new blocks. Instead, the block selection process is primarily based on wealth. Minters must buy some of the native currency from a cryptocurrency platform, which is then used as collateral in the \u201cstaking\u201d process \u2013 a minimum of 32 units of Ether, in Ethereum\u2019s case. The software then randomly chooses a \u201cstaker\u201d to create the next block for the blockchain. The larger the amount staked, the greater the chance of being chosen. While minters still need a device with sufficient storage capacity and an active internet connection, the computational power of the device is irrelevant. This negates the need for vast mining networks of electricity-gorging computers. \u201cA laptop will suffice,\u201d says Russo.\n\nEthereum\u2019s transition to PoS has reduced its power demand by between 99.84% and 99.9996%, according to a range of estimates, setting a benchmark for decarbonising the world\u2019s remaining PoW-reliant cryptocurrencies. \u201cThis is the solution to getting rid of the majority of crypto\u2019s energy consumption,\u201d says de Vries. \u201cIt solves almost the entirety of the industry's environmental impact.\u201d\n\nIndirectly, it goes a long way to solving crypto\u2019s e-waste problem, explains Russo. \u201cBecause the participants aren\u2019t competing on computational power, they just need a laptop to confirm a transaction, rather than huge amounts of computer hardware that regularly needs replacing when it becomes obsolete.\u201d\n\nNo panacea\n\nHowever, despite the evident promise of the Merge, the purported 99% reduction of Ethereum\u2019s power demand does not quite tell the whole story. The \u2018ASICS\u2019 devices that used to mine PoW Ethereum can still be used to mine the cryptocurrencies Ethereum Classic and EthereumPoW \u2013 a spinoff that maintains the PoW mechanism. Indeed, days after the Merge, the pair had absorbed a quarter of Ethereum\u2019s hashrate (the marker of its mining activity) \u2013 and it was still around a fifth a month later.\n\nFurthermore, the GPUs (a type of computer hardware) formerly used to mine Ethereum can be repurposed to mine other cryptocurrencies, thereby negating some of the Merge\u2019s saved power consumption. However, that would likely come at a cost to miners. For instance, miners on Ethereum Classic can only earn around $0.5m a day compared with the $22.1m they could make from mining Ethereum \u2013 in turn reducing the power expenses they can afford. \u201cI\u2019m mining at a loss,\u201d TheCrowbill, an Ethereum Classic miner, told The Defiant on 27 September. \u201cProbably will remain that way for some time.\u201d\n\n[Keep up with Energy Monitor: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter]\n\nSimilarly, many of the GPUs may have been repurposed to focus on other energy-intensive activities such as cloud computing, AI and gaming. There is also a suspicion that Bitcoin miners have pounced on the data centre space that has become available as result of the Merge. Between 250,000 and 500,000 Bitcoin mining devices are thought to remain unused for a lack of data centre rack space.\n\nFinally, although the Merge makes Ethereum one of most energy-efficient cryptocurrencies, it still remains less efficient than more centralised alternatives. The underlying blockchain technology replicates data and processes over thousands of participating devices, resulting in more data redundancy and higher associated energy costs from maintaining multiple copies. For example, for the roughly 1.1 million transactions a day that Ethereum processes since the Merge, the average electricity consumed per transaction ranges from 0.8 to 14.7 watt-hours (Wh). A Mastercard transaction, by contrast, consumes just 0.7Wh on average.\n\nConverting Bitcoin\u2019s sceptics\n\nNonetheless, many of these issues would be redundant if all cryptocurrencies switched from PoW to PoS. So, unlike many industries, crypto\u2019s path to decarbonisation appears relatively simple. The very sizeable snag, however, is that the Bitcoin community \u2013 the source of the lion\u2019s share of remaining emissions \u2013 has shown little willingness to make the move.\n\nThe Change the Code campaign launched by Greenpeace in 2022 aimed to convince Bitcoin to ditch PoW, but it was met with outright hostility by much of the community. They see the software\u2019s immutability as one of its foundational strengths and the source of its enduring value, and due to the network\u2019s decentralised structure, it is hard to imagine convincing the entire community to make the jump.\n\n\u201cThe solution is there, but now you need to get this really stubborn community to think about adopting it,\u201d says de Vries. \u201cThat is the hard part, especially since there is nobody in charge who can enforce the decision.\u201d\n\nIt is made even more difficult by the fact that many in that community are notoriously unconcerned by climate change. \u201cA lot of the loudest influencers in the Bitcoin community are climate change deniers, who often make statements like, \u2018we breathe out carbon, so how can it be so bad?\u2019\u201d adds de Vries.\n\nEthereum has, however, proven that it is possible to convince a disparate, doubting community to shift to PoS, without any resulting increase in much-dreaded centralisation. The apparent success of the Merge may convert a fair few of Bitcoin\u2019s doubters. \u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily need to convince the entire Bitcoin community,\u201d notes de Vries. \u201cYou just need a critical mass.\"\n\nA transition to PoS by Bitcoin would likely result in more climate benefits than the Merge, as unlike the GPUs formerly used to mine Ethereum, Bitcoin\u2019s ASIC-based devices cannot easily be repurposed.\n\nNet-zero crypto\n\nThe possibility of crypto ever reaching net-zero emissions is inextricably wedded to Bitcoin\u2019s adoption of PoS or a similarly energy-efficient mining mechanism \u2013 and if and when that will happen depends on who you ask. Much will depend on the direction of the price of Bitcoin going forward. \u201cIf the price goes up again consistently, I don\u2019t see the community considering a change in the software,\u201d says de Vries. \u201cBut if it keeps going down, they will have a serious [financial] concern on their hands and will be much more willing to contemplate changes.\u201d\n\nIf governments were to slam a range of adverse regulations on Bitcoin for continuing to use PoW, de Vries also believes much of the community would soon change its tune. \u201cIn the end, money talks,\u201d he says.\n\nConsidering the Merge reduced Ethereum\u2019s power consumption by 99%, Russo believes that if all the other cryptocurrencies followed suit, the industry could reach net zero \u201cin a few years\u201d. He points out that it took Ethereum five years to complete the transition. \u201cSo let's say that on average, we need ten years to do this with other cryptocurrencies,\u201d he says. \u201cI think in 15 years, if crypto still exists, it will be a much more sustainable environment.\u201d\n\nUltimately, for Bitcoin, the writing is on the wall \u2013 or, more accurately, in the source code. Around 19 million of the planned 21 million Bitcoins have already been created. And when that quota is filled, there will be no incentive for mining left. That will be great news for the environment; the only downside is that is not forecast to happen until 2140. \u201cFor humanity\u2019s sake, let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t come down to that,\u201d says de Vries."

        "content": "New Release Overview\n\nGrowing momentum of enterprise blockchain use cases drives the need for interoperability between the blockchain platform and other systems, including other blockchain ledgers. To better support our customers' and partners' requirements, 22.4.2 release of Oracle Blockchain Platform and its low-code Blockchain App Builder provides a number of new capabilities to arm developers building sophisticated blockchain solutions. Main features in this release include:\n\nOAuth 2.0 support for REST proxy event callbacks to enable callback delivery authenticated by the subscribing organization's Identity Providers. This extends the current security model based on mutual TLS (certificate exchange) with an OAuth 2.0 security token option for integrating members in consortium networks that need to have event callbacks delivered to their OAuth token-secured enterprise systems.\n\nMore popular web3 API support for OBP users running Solidity smart contracts using an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on OBP nodes. As more users started taking advantage of these capabilities, this release has certified Fab3 provider for web3 JSON RPC API, making it easier to work with Solidity smart contracts using standard web3 interfaces.\n\nEthereum interoperability enabling developers to combine OBP native smart contract transactions with Ethereum/EVM smart contract transactions in a single atomic operation. This feature extends REST proxy orchestration with Ethereum client to enable invoking Ethereum/EVM-based smart contracts as part of the 2PC-based atomic transaction support released previously. Atomic commits ensure both sides are committed on the leger, or, if either side fails, none are committed.\n\nExtending tokenization SDKs and generated chaincodes in Blockchain App Builder to support the new ERC-1155 specification that allows fungible and non-fungible tokens to be defined in a single template and run in a single chaincode. This multi-token capability, including batch transfers, simplifies more advanced tokenization solutions.\n\nExtending the TTF-based tokenization SDK to support exchange across different fungible tokens on OBP, which enables more complex financial use cases for banks handling multiple currencies or rewards systems with different brands loyalty points that can be exchanged.\n\nThis release is in production deployments at all supported OCI regions today, and can be used by provisioning new OBP instances or upgrading existing ones to the latest release. For detailed documentation on these features see the latest What\u2019s New for Oracle Blockchain Platform.\n\nOAuth2 secure token support\n\nOBP has always supported OAuth2 for inbound REST API requests, but the callbacks triggered by event subscriptions were secured by mutual TLS, which depended on X.509 certificates that a subscribing system had to issue to OBP, and OBP had to include in the callback process. While a very secure approach, issuing and renewing X.509 certificates requires some effort and not all participating parties are able to run PKI systems necessary for this purpose. To make it easier for diverse participants to join the blockchain consortia and use event notifications/callbacks to integrate with their back-office systems, we looked at providing additional security options that are simpler and more broadly accessible. OAuth2 tokens are widely used when connecting systems across company boundaries and their tokens can be automatically issued or refreshed through many Identity Management (IdM) solutions.\n\nRequest/Response flow for event callbakcs using OBP REST Proxy OAuth 2.0 token support\n\nTo use OAuth2 tokens for event subscription callbacks, you have to specify the relevant client ID, client secret, and scope parameters for the target system\u2019s OAuth server when registering an event subscription using an \u201coauth\u201d parameter structure:\n\n\"oauth\": { \"clientID\": \"my-client-id\", \"clientSecret\": \"my-client-secret\", \"tokenUrl\": \"https://identity.example.com/oauth2/v1/token\", \"authInHeader\": true, \"scopes\": [\"urn:opc:idm:__myscopes__\"] }\n\nWeb3 API support\n\nWeb3 API refers to the APIs used by the open source web3.js library, which is a collection of modules that allow you to interact with a local or remote Ethereum node or one emulated by an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). OBP has long supported an EVM option, enabling Solidity developers to easily deploy and run their smart contracts on OBP in a private Ethereum model. In the past, these interactions between the client dApps and Solidity smart contracts were possible through a Remix Ethereum IDE or OBP REST proxy API. However, with growing popularity of web3, more developers want to be able to take advantage of this de-facto standard to interact with smart contracts on multiple networks, including OBP.\n\nIn order to support that, this release supports a Fab3 module built as a gateway between web3.js library and Hyperledger Fabric. It exposes web3 JSON-RPC APIs to external clients and internally maps these requests through the Hyperledger Fabric client SDK to gRPC calls to EVMCC chaincode on OBP nodes, enabling interaction with Solidity smart contracts deployed in EVMCC runtime. This enables standard web3-based clients, such as crypto wallets and other dApps to work with Solidity/EVM contracts on OBP.\n\nWeb3 JSON-RPC API enablement using Fab3 provider with OBP EVM support\n\nEthereum Interoperability with Atomic Transactions\n\nThe worlds of public and permissioned blockchains are growing closer together. More customer and partner solutions embrace both types of distributed ledgers to meet complex requirements, where the performance and confidentiality of permissioned blockchain is as important as broader reach and liquidity of the public blockchains. Oracle blockchain vision fully embraces this interoperability and this release enables it through the orchestration capabilities of OBP REST proxy.\n\nIn the last release we provided an atomicTransaction feature that enabled applications to invoke multiple OBP smart contracts on the same channel or across different channels as a single atomic operation based on 2-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol. It ensured that all the transactions would commit together, or, if any failed, all would be rolled back. While this was a significant innovation within Hyperledger Fabric world, we didn\u2019t stop there. With this release developers can extend the list of smart contracts in atomicTransaction API with a single Ethereum (or EVM-based) smart contract, and still achieve the same atomic result \u2013 all succeed or all get rolled back.\n\nYou might ask how this is possible, since Ethereum, unlike OBP, doesn\u2019t support 2PC protocol for orchestrating atomic transactions. The answer lies in LRC (Last Resource Commit) optimization of 2PC. It essentially enables one non-2PC resource to be included in the 2PC-based global transaction. After the \u201cprepare\u201d phase of the OBP transactions, REST proxy uses a built-in Geth client to execute an Ethereum smart contract transaction and wait for its commit (based on finality rules parameters provided in the API). If it commits, the related OBP transactions then go through their own \u201ccommit\u201d phase. If it fails, then the \u201cprepared\u201d OBP transactions are rolled back. Thus we extend the atomicTransaction API with an \u201clrc\u201d segment that specifies an Ethereum contract to invoke and a set of parameters related to Ethereum invocation, including the finality parameters on how many blocks or how long to wait for the commit on Ethereum side.\n\nEthereum interoperability with OBP orchestrated by OBP REST Proxy\n\nThe following example shows the API details with transactions array for OBP chaincode invocations and lrc section for Ethereum contract invocation. The lrc section includes an ethReq section for signed or unsigned transaction request, and a finalityParams section, which determines how long to wait for transaction finality.\n\n{ \"transactions\": [ {\"chaincode\":\"bt1\",\"args\":[\"invoke\", \"a\", \"b\", \"7\"],\"timeout\":0, \"channel\":\"ch1\"}, {\"chaincode\":\"bt2\",\"args\":[\"invoke\", \"a\", \"b\", \"5\"],\"timeout\":0, \"channel\":\"ch2\"} ], \"lrc\": { \"ethReq\": { \"url\": \"http://<IP address of Ethereum server>:<port>\", \"chainId\": 1337, \"unSignedReq\": { \"privateKey\": \"de1fab4e05b476f81d11901a69e58a3000859395eb6bdb222fcb583b8d599b00\", \"ethValue\": \"1000000000000000000\", \"gasLimit\": 21000, \"toAddress\": \"0x7336d04f97fdccd0a93462947474c8879a5c6597\" }, \"finalityParams\": { \"checkFinality\": true, \"blocksToWait\": 2, \"secondsToWait\": 30 } } }, \"isolationLevel\": \"serializable\", \"prepareTimeout\": 10000, \"sync\": true }\n\nThe unSignedReq section above can also be replaced with a signedReq:\n\nThe result of the Ethereum transaction can be seen in this Etherscan view from Goerli Testnet.\n\nEtherscan view of an Ethereum testnet transaction initiated by OBP as part of a global atomic transaction.\n\nEthereum interoperability with atomic transactions support enables a number of scenarios to support numerous interoperability use cases:\n\nAtomic asset exchange Pre-fund OBP fungible tokens using ETH or ERC-20 tokens Use ETH or ERC-20 tokens to pay for NFTs minted and traded on Oracle Blockchain Prep and mint NFT on Oracle Blockchain, allow NFT buyer to transfer to Ethereum or another Solidity/EVM-based network for secondary market liquidity\n\nUse OBP tokens to track public chain token balances across multiple ledgers or marketplaces\n\nOBP transaction processing using confidential business data generates an event that triggers an Ethereum smart contract, e.g., to process payment or other complex business processes\n\nOBP transaction based on confidential on-ledger data has its hash published on Ethereum as public proof without disclosing any confidential transaction details\n\nERC-1155 Support\n\nBeyond the initial ERC-721 spec for NFTs, a number of new specs have been proposed that extend NFTs in a variety of ways to handle more complex use cases, greater regulatability, etc. One of the more popular extensions in ERC-1155, which combines fungible and non-fungible tokens in a single contract, supports batch transactions across multiple tokens, and provides more dynamic NFT properties. As a leading low-code blockchain development tool our Blockchain App Builder now allows you to specify ERC-1155 tokens by using \u201cstandard: erc1155+\u201d in a token template and defining multiple assets, that can include fungible and non-fungible tokens as well as non-token assets. A sample template using \"erc1155+\" standard is included with the latest version of the Blockchain App Builder.\n\nAs a multi-token digital asset specification, ERC-1155 combines the best of ERC-20 (fungible) and ERC-721 (non-fungible) assets in a single contract, and allows you to convert fungible tokens to NFTs (e.g., pay for an NFT with certain number of loyalty points or coins). With a single ERC-1155 chaincode, a user account can create and hold multiple fungible and NFT token assets, unlike ERC-721 which has a single NFT linked to an account. ERC-1155 also provides for batch transfers via a single smart contract method and provides greater security by allowing safe transfer functions to verify transaction validity and reverse the transaction if it\u2019s not valid. Batch transfers make it not only easier and faster to transfer multiple assets, but open the door to more complex NFT instruments. And the ability to convert between NFTs and fungible tokens in a single operation is going to optimize a number of NFT- related transactions and enable new tokenization use cases.\n\nEvolving tokenization specs\n\nWhat about that \u201c+\u201d in \u201cerc1155+\u201d standard? Just like with ERC-721 we have extended ERC-1155 to include burn method, account management features (creating, associating, suspending, and resuming custodial accounts on-chain), and role-based security to control who can mint and burn these tokens. Look for a more detailed post on ERC-1155 features soon.\n\nToken exchange for TTF-based fungible tokens\n\nSome of the more popular use cases for fungible tokens are in financial sector, where tokens represent digital currency, or in rewards programs where they represent loyalty points for different brands. In both of these areas, exchange between currencies or exchange of loyalty points between brands is an important requirement. There are a few approaches to exchanging tokens, and we selected one of the fastest growing mechanisms known as exchange pools (a.k.a. liquidity pools.) Exchange pools are modeled on an equivalent of a liquidity pool concept in the financial system or cryptocurrency \u2013 these are just accounts maintained by a trusted party that contain multiple currencies. They can be funded by any other parties called Liquidity Providers who transfer funds to an exchange pool, usually in exchange for fees collected from exchange pool users. However, instead of having to rely on external liquidity pools, we enable users to create and fund them directly on OBP ledger as part of our tokenization engine and enable liquidity providers to join OBP as members to transfer funds into OBP exchange pools.\n\nTo use token exchange method you need to first invoke the methods to set up the exchange pool facility and set the conversion rate. Then liquidity providers from multiple token systems can transfer tokens into it, which funds the exchange pool accounts. Once ready, the exchange itself is done with a single method call:\n\nTokenConversion(from_token_id string, to_token_id string, to_org_id string, to_user_id string, token_quantity float64)\n\nFor example: TokenConversion(\u201cTokX\u201d, \u201dTokY\u201d, \u201cAccount2\u201d, \u201cAccount2_user\u201d, 10)\n\nWhen invoked via this API the tokenization SDK then initiates an exchange transaction from Account 1 (the invoker) for 10 units of TokX to be delivered to Account2 as TokY. Under the covers, this involves transferring 10 TokX to the exchange pool account, where it\u2019s credited and a corresponding amount of TokY (based on the exchange rate set through the pool API) is debited from the exchange pool and is transferred to the target account.\n\nExchange pool mechanism in Oracle blockchain tokenization engine\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say we have one token named USD and another one EUR, and an exchange pool defined for USD and EUR funded with 100 units of USD and 70 units of EUR, and a conversion rate set at 0.95 EUR to 1 USD. We can invoke a transfer method from Account 1 for 10 USD for delivery to Account 2 in EUR. This would debit Account 1 10 USD tokens, credit these to the exchange pool USD account, debit exchange pool EUR account 10.52 EUR tokens (10/0.95), and credit this amount to Account 2 in EUR. As the result, the total amounts of USD and EUR in the system remain as they were before the transaction, and we have achieved an exchange by crediting and debiting the required amount within the exchange pool accounts. This mechanism is similar to market makers used in foreign exchanges with systemic banks often providing liquidity pool services. With our token exchange, you can implement a multi-currency CBDC system or any financial instruments that need to operate in a multi-currency world.\n\nSummary\n\nThe complexity of blockchain use cases is on the rise, and with it comes a strong need for interoperability \u2013 with other enterprise systems and across multiple blockchain technologies. Making this not only functional, but easy-to-use and easy-to-secure is a challenge facing many blockchain platforms. The latest Oracle Blockchain Platform release addresses these challenges head on in the following ways:\n\nOAuth2 token support makes enterprise integration of event callbacks easier to secure within the member's enterprise IdM ecosystem and more broadly appealing.\n\nBeing able to execute multiple transactions across different blockchain channels in an atomic manner is crucial to many use cases. No blockchain implementations other than Oracle Blockchain Platform supports such use cases without the need to change existing chaincodes and/or to introduce complex, and vulnerable bridging solutions.\n\nWith Fab3 provider for web3 JSON-RPC APIs we\u2019ve made it easier to integrate common crypto wallets and dApps with Solidity/EVM contracts on OBP. You can use this to run a private Solidity/Ethereum solution on the managed OBP service in OCI and integrate with standard wallets and other dApps.\n\nAs NFTs move beyond digital art and collectibles, more advanced capabilities are needed to model different forms of assets, combining both fungible and non-fungible capabilities. With ERC-1155 we are enabling developers to take full advantage of the latest approaches to making NFTs more useful and easier to adapt to real-world use cases.\n\nAnd with fungible token exchange, we are enabling digital currency or rewards programs to easily operate in a multi-currency or multi-brand world leveraging OBP-supported exchange pools mechanism.\n\nAll this and many other innovative capabilities show the power of Oracle blockchain to support your tomorrow today."

        "title": "Ethereum's Shanghai Upgrade Brings Heat To Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) with LDO Seeing 71% Increase In - Ethereum World News",
        "content": "The Shanghai upgrade of the Ethereum network, set to launch in March, will allow users to withdraw their ether (ETH) from the network.\n\nA public test network for the Shanghai upgrade will be released by the end of February.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade has generated excitement among some due to the potential for competition between Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) after the upgrade.\n\nThe LDO token, associated with the Lido DAO, has recently seen strong performance with a 71% increase in value over the past week.\n\nShanghai Upgrade\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade of the Ethereum network will focus on allowing users to withdraw their ether (ETH) from the network. This upgrade, set to launch in March, will enable users to access coins that have been staked on the network as part of the transition to proof-of-stake consensus, which occurred in September.\n\nIn order to meet the March deadline, the developers plan to release a public test network for the Shanghai upgrade by the end of February. During the recent core developers call, it was decided not to consider adding the Ethereum Virtual Machine Object Format (EOF) to the upgrade due to concerns that it may delay the rollout. The priority for the Shanghai upgrade is to ensure the smooth implementation of the withdrawals feature.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade of the Ethereum network, scheduled for March 2023, has generated excitement among some as they anticipate competition between LSD (Liquid Staking Derivatives).\n\nThere are a few anticipated potential outcomes following the upgrade.\n\nPotential Sell Pressure: A possibility is that there could be increased sell pressure from large investors or those looking to sell their assets.\n\nStakers Will Not UnStake: Another possibility is that stakers may continue as per usual, with no change in their behavior.\n\nStakers Will move their unstaked ETH in LSDs: Another anticipated possibility is that investors may move their newly unstaked Ethereum to Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) in order to benefit from higher returns and decentralized finance functionality. This could potentially result in new innovations and developments in the space.\n\nWhat is Liquid Staking?\n\nLiquid staking, also known as \u201csoft staking,\u201d is a way to earn rewards by locking up funds while still retaining access to them. This is in contrast to traditional staking on the Beacon Chain, which involves a larger investment of 32 ETH (around $40,000) and does not allow for funds to be withdrawn until the staking period is over. With liquid staking, any amount can be staked and the funds can be withdrawn at any time.\n\nOnce staked ETH becomes available for withdrawal, the revenue of liquid staking providers is expected to increase. Liquid staking derivatives allow for participation in decentralized finance without sacrificing staking yields. Examples of this include Lido, which offers stETH staking and LDO tokens that earn yields, though it does take a 10% cut of the staking rewards. Rocket Pool is another well-known provider that emphasizes decentralization and offers competitive returns. Other notable providers in this space include Stakewise and Frax Finance, both of which have seen rapid growth. Stader Labs is also planning to launch an Ethereum liquid staking derivative in the first quarter of the year, and it is possible that other companies may follow suit.\n\nThe LDO token, which is associated with the Lido DAO, has experienced strong performance recently, with a 71% increase in value over the past week according to CoinGecko."

        "title": "Ethereum Rival Solana (SOL) Surges 109% From Lows As Crypto Markets Turn Green - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "Solana (SOL), one of Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) biggest competitors, has more than doubled in price since it collapsed to $8.30.\n\nSOL\u2019s local low of $8.30 marked a nearly 97% drop from its all-time highs, and created uncertainty surrounding the future of Solana.\n\nSolana Labs and the Solana Foundation both had exposure to FTX, and the close ties between the organizations put significant sell pressure on SOL.\n\nAt time of writing, however, SOL is up 103% in less than two weeks, currently changing hands at $16.91.

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crypto market started off the week slowly due to the holiday season but picked up a pace later in the week. Bitcoin began trading at the US$16,584 level. It has been trading in a narrow range between $16,256 and $17,061 in recent days, indicating a lack of strong movement from either bulls or bears.On Thursday, BTC started consolidating above the $16,800 level as market volatility remained high following the release of the Federal Open Market Committee's minutes. The bank expects a more aggressive rise in inflation to be at 3.5% this year, which is higher than expected. Bitcoin declined by nearly 75% since its all-time high of US$69,000 in November 2021. In the past 24 hours, BTC has traded above the US$16,900 level. Resistance level for BTC is at $17,000. However, a clear move above the US$17,000 level might create a sense of confidence among the bulls to move further in value in the coming week.On the other hand, Ethereum also consolidated marginally with momentum on Thursday. However, despite a small drop, sentiment remains somewhat bullish as ETH continues to trade above the US$1,250 level. Other major cryptocurrencies also spend much of this week in a similar trend to BTC and ETH.In an interesting turn of events, the UK will soon enforce a tax exemption for foreign investors purchasing crypto through local investment managers or brokers.

        "content": "Astar Network \u2013 a smart contract innovation hub that connects the Polkadot ecosystem to all Layer 1 blockchains \u2013 launched its Cross-Virtual Machine (XVM) on the public testnet Shibuya.\n\nIt enables projects building on Astar to interact with other smart contract ecosystems, including the WebAssembly (WASM) and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nEnter the XVM\n\nAccording to a document seen by CryptoPotato, Astar Network launched the first major product part of its 2023 strategy \u2013 the Cross-Virtual Machine (XVM).\n\nThe feature is a set of interfaces and a custom pallet that allows smart contracts from one virtual machine to engage with others. The XVM can conduct bi-directional calls between WASM and EVM, regardless of the programming languages the virtual machines employ. Speaking on the development was Hoon Kim \u2013 Chief Technology Officer at Astar Network:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working hard to create the foundation of the future, regardless of outside influences that are happening now. And today, I am proud to introduce one of our most important features to achieve the Astar Vision; the Cross-Virtual Machine (XVM). It will be the start of the next wave of innovation for dApps. Astar will not only have interoperability through XCM (Cross-chain Messaging) with other parachains but also have interoperability between different smart contract environments.\u201d\n\nThe XVM enables developers to explore numerous contract environments instead of having just one choice. They are also able to build a variety of complex applications that can provide many use cases, such as proving ownership of digital assets.\n\nThe Previous Developments\n\nAstar Network joined forces with the blockchain company Alchemy in August last year to amplify Web3 development on Polkadot\u2019s ecosystem. Astar\u2019s Founder and CEO \u2013 Sota Watanabe \u2013 explained the potential benefits of the partnership:\n\n\u201cSupporting the developer ecosystem is one of Astar\u2019s core values, and our collaboration with Alchemy will help bring even more incentives and innovation to the community. Our collaboration will provide the resources needed to grow the builder community in web3 on Astar, Polkadot, and beyond.\u201d\n\nAstar, which is Polkadot\u2019s leading parachain, inked another collaboration a week later with the DeFi network Acala. The joint initiative aimed to accelerate decentralized finance by introducing new opportunities to developers and rewarding them for their efforts in the Polkadot ecosystem."

        "title": "Most Popular Programming Languages Used in Blockchain Technology - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Here are the most popular programming languages that are used in blockchain technology\n\nIt is important to understand how crucial is blockchain programming and its underlying applications in this digital world. This article represents a comprehensive manual for blockchain programming that will bring you a wealth of knowledge about blockchain and blockchain programming since knowledge of programming blockchain systems, smart contracts, and more is gradually becoming essential today as blockchain technology is modernizing business processes.\n\nThe fundamentals of Blockchain programming:\n\nBlockchain is a distributed database that allows a network of computers to reach a consensus on the state of its records. It is often associated with the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, but it can be used for other purposes as well. To start with Blockchain programming, firstly you need to learn about distributed systems and cryptography. Some specific topics that you may want to explore include:\n\nPublic key cryptography: This is used to secure transactions on a blockchain. It involves the use of a public key, which is used to encrypt a message, and a private key, which is used to decrypt it.\n\nHash functions: These are used to create a unique \u201cfingerprint\u201d for each block in the chain. This fingerprint is called a \u201chash,\u201d and it is used to verify the integrity of the block and its contents.\n\nConsensus algorithms: These are used to ensure that all of the computers on the network agree on the state of the blockchain. Different algorithms can be used, such as Proof of Work (used by Bitcoin) or Proof of Stake.\n\nSmart contracts: These are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained therein are stored and replicated on the blockchain network.\n\nBlockchain Programming:\n\nThe optimal programming language to learn for blockchain development depends on a variety of parameters, most of which change depending on the blockchain project. For those who wish to know what language blockchain is written in, the list below can give us a good idea.\n\nThe most popular programming languages for blockchains are Solidity, C++, Go, Phyton, and JavaScript, among others.\n\nAbout Solidity:\n\nThe Ethereum team created Solidity, a domain-specific, object-oriented, high-level language that is similar to javascript. Solidity is a language for building decentralized applications for the Ethereum platform and Ethereum Virtual Machine that was influenced by C++, Python, and JavaScript (EVM). The EVM is the environment in which smart contracts created on the Ethereum platform are run. Inheritance, libraries, and sophisticated user-defined types are all supported by the statically typed language Solidity. It continues to be the DSL that the Ethereum community and blockchain sector have adapted the most.\n\nOther Blockchain Programming languages:\n\nC++: A blockchain is designed to communicate with many untrusted nodes while still offering everyone speedy service. This quick service is essential to a cryptocurrency\u2019s success. You need total control over CPU and memory utilization to meet all these requirements and operate at the greatest level. This is provided to users of C++.\n\nGo: A key feature needed for blockchain projects is the ability to run several programmes or many parts of a programme asynchronously or in parallel. This capacity is provided by Go programming constructs called goroutines.\n\nPython: Python cannot be omitted from this list no matter what you do because practically every blockchain ecosystem contains at least one publicly available utility built in Python. More people than ever are learning Python as a language.\n\nJavaScript: Javascript excels at handling asynchronous actions, which is one of the primary characteristics that makes it ideal for blockchain operations. The connectivity between all of these various blockchain nodes becomes easier for JavaScript to manage as there are more users using blockchain and doing actions simultaneously.\n\nConclusion: You can learn more about the technical facets of blockchain programming and development by taking online courses and tutorials.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Enabling MEV as a user choice with Allnodes - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "The rapid rise of cryptocurrencies in recent years has led to a billion-dollar industry with top companies and trading platforms integrating trading strategies toward getting maximum returns on their investment.\n\nThe complex nature of trading strategies has brought about new terminologies and concepts, and MEV is regarded as one of the new novel concepts in the crypto industry.\n\nWhat is MEV?\n\nMEV, or maximum extractable value, is the extra monetary value users can get from a block production in addition to staking rewards or gas fees. When transactions in the block are included, excluded, or rearranged in favor of more profitable ones, MEV is generated.\n\nBecause transaction placement and speed are critical in trading, MEV employs various strategies that mimic front running on Wall Street, such as sandwich attacks and back running. These strategies are most commonly found on blockchains such as Ethereum, where smart contracts play an important role in transaction processing.\n\nTypical settlement mechanisms on the blockchain allow orders to be organized in batches and exposed before settling, allowing any agent to propose a series of trades. If these arbitrageurs use the standard transaction channel for their transactions, they risk being exploited.\n\nFor example, Ethereum\u2019s original architecture called for all pending transactions to be kept in the mempool, where the public could view them before being submitted to a peer-to-peer validator network for processing. Knowledgeable users could evaluate the pending transactions and execute their deal ahead by submitting the same trades with themselves listed as beneficiaries and a higher fee.\n\nWhat are the negative impacts of MEV?\n\nMEV front running and sandwich attacks inflate asset values and increase network congestion and gas fees. Prioritizing trades over other transactions increases the amount of gas required for the transaction and slows down the network. Sandwich attacks are also harmful to the network because they increase slippage and cause problems with transaction execution.\n\nWhat is MEV Relayer?\n\nAn MEV relay is a trusted mediator between block producers and block builders, which helps solve some of the inherent problems of MEV. Essentially, it\u2019s a separate piece of open-source software run by validators that queries and outsources block-building to a network of builders.\n\nThis open-source middleware gives access to a competitive block-building market. The consensus layer client of a validator proposes the most profitable block received from the MEV relayer to the Ethereum network for attestation and block inclusion.\n\nRelayers increase block rewards while also preventing arbitrage and bad actors from extracting and manipulating transactions, separating the role of proposers from block builders and having a net positive effect for end-users transacting on chain.\n\nWhy should I use an MEV Relayer?\n\nThe primary reason anyone participating in staking or running a validator should run an MEV relayer is to increase their yield. MEV Boost can increase your rewards 3-4x over vanilla blocks.\n\nIt is equally important to mention that public MEV relayers have been developed to support the sustainable and democratized distribution of block reward, reducing the negative impacts of MEV mentioned above. Relayers can also censor blocks, this topic is currently under much discussion within the various blockchain communities.\n\nWho are the main MEV services?\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that many MEV relayers are not mutually exclusive, bundles can and are often sent through multiple routers.\n\nFlashbots: Flashbots is a research and development organization founded to mitigate the negative externalities posed to stateful blockchains, beginning with Ethereum.\n\nBlocknative: Blocknative provides solutions for real-time blockchain transaction management, optimization, and maximizing block rewards for public blockchain networks.\n\nBloxRoute: The bloXroute MEV service allows traders to submit MEV bundles and participate in merged bundles with other traders with three services: Max Profit, Ethical and Regulated.\n\nEden Network: Eden is a priority transaction network that protects traders from frontrunning, aligns block producer incentives, and redistributes miner extractable value.\n\nManifold Finance: Manifold Finance functions as an intermediary between Ethereum users and validators. It consolidates all Ethereum transactions in the best possible way to create a block that delivers the highest return on investment for all stakeholders.\n\nHow can you use MEV?\n\nIf you are technical enough to run your own Ethereum validator and meet the minimum requirements, you can install and run the relayers above. However, most people are staking Ethereum with a staking service such as Allnodes, which offers 1 click staking and allows you to maintain control over your keys.\n\nWhen choosing a staking service, it\u2019s important to see if the increase in MEV-boosted block rewards is being sent to you. Services like Allnodes do not take a cut of MEV-related rewards, so 100% of the yield is directed back to the end user (staker).\n\nThe other important decision is which MEV relayer to choose. Some services will not give you a choice, whereas Allnodes provides the user with an option directly in the UI on which MEV they want to use.\n\n\u201cWe run over 15k Ethereum nodes, so we decided the best option is to allow our users to choose what MEV relayer they want to deploy directly in the UI with a simple click. It\u2019s a no-brainer to support the sustainable and democratized distribution of block production while also getting more rewards for staking\u201d\n\n-Robert Ellison \u2013 Head of Growth at Allnodes\n\nWe recommend visiting a site like https://www.rated.network/relays to decide which MEV relayer you want to use.\n\nAllnodes give users a choice of MEV\n\nAllnodes is a non-custodial platform that allows you to host nodes, stake, and monitor blockchain addresses in a few clicks. Their primary goal as Ethereum validators is to maximize rewards for their customers safely and effectively while at the same time securing the network. As such, they are committed to best practices for MEV, with all rewards returning to the end user.\n\nAs an Ethereum validator on Allnodes, your revenue from staking will increase substantially with MEV. Furthermore, the additional revenue distribution is automatic and won\u2019t require technical know-how on your part. You can start hosting your own Eth node here if you have the required minimum of 32 Eth or if you have the minimum of 16 Eth and would like to use Rocketpool.\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid post and should not be treated as news/advice."

        "title": "Is Ether ($ETH) a Better Long-Term Bet Than Bitcoin ($BTC)? - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "Although both $BTC and $ETH are currently down roughly 75% from their all-time highs (which were reached in November 2021), quite a few recent tweets and articles about these two cryptocurrencies suggest that the general perception in the crypto community is that the latter is probably a better long-term bet.\n\nIt is difficult to definitively say whether Ether (ETH) is a better long-term bet than Bitcoin (BTC). Both cryptocurrencies have their own unique characteristics and have performed well in the past, and it is ultimately up to individual investors to decide which one aligns more with their investment goals and risk tolerance.\n\nOne argument in favor of Ether as a long-term investment is its potential for wider adoption. While Bitcoin is primarily used as a store of value and a means of exchange, Ether has the added use case of powering smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. This makes Ether an attractive investment for those who believe in the potential of decentralized applications (dApps) and the wider adoption of blockchain technology.\n\nAnother argument in favor of Ether is its strong developer community and support. Ethereum has one of the largest and most active developer communities in the cryptocurrency space, which has contributed to the platform\u2019s ongoing evolution and growth. This strong community support can provide a level of stability and security for Ether investors.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that Bitcoin also has a strong developer community and has proven to be a resilient and secure cryptocurrency over the years. Bitcoin has the advantage of being the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, which gives it a level of brand recognition and mainstream visibility that Ether does not yet have. Additionally, Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million coins, which gives it a level of scarcity that can make it a more attractive store of value for investors.\n\nOn Thursday (5 January 2023), Mike McGlone, a Senior Macro Strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence (Bloomberg\u2019s research arm on the Bloomberg Terminal\u201d), shared his outlook for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nIn the January 2023 edition of Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s \u201cCrypto Outlook\u201d report, McGlone (and the two contributing analysts he worked with on this research) said:\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s upward performance vs. Bitcoin has been unshaken by 2022 deflation in most risk assets and may be gaining underpinnings. At a ratio of about 0.07, the Ethereum/Bitcoin cross rate is the same as in May 2021, when the Nasdaq 100 Stock index was about 20% higher.\n\n\u201cOur graphic shows the enduring trend of the No. 2 crypto outperforming No, 1, which appeared coincident with the rise of risk assets. The 2022 drop of about 30% in the index is part of a receding tide, including about a 70% decline in Ethereum. Migration into the mainstream is our takeaway, and once the dust settles from some reversion in risk assets amid inflation pressure, Ethereum appears more likely to resume what it\u2019s been doing \u2014 outperforming.\u201c\n\nThe popular pseudonymous host of crypto market analysis show \u201cCoin Bureau\u201d says that if the Shanghai upgrade goes well, \u201c2023 could be a really big year for Ethereum and for ETH.\u201d\n\nAccording to a report by The Block, at Ethereum Core Devs Meeting #151, which was held on 8 December 2022, a provisional timeline for the completion of the Shanghai upgrade, also known as Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4895, was set. This upgrade will enable users to withdraw their staked funds from the Ethereum blockchain, a feature that is currently not available. According to Cointelegraph, \u201cdevelopers will aim for May or June 2023 to launch the Ethereum Improvement Protocol (EIP) 4844 upgrade that will introduce proto-danksharding to the network.\u201d\n\nLast month, Coin Bureau released a video update (titled \u201cQ&A: ETH Predictions, BTC & Crypto Market in 2023!\u201d) and according to a report by The Daily Hodl, the host of the show had this to say about the potential impact of the upcoming Shanghai network upgrade and the overall outlook for Ethereum in 2023:\n\n\u201cWhen they see that that ETH can in fact be unstaked and easily sold, then it might incentivize them to actually stake themselves. So I really think it could go either way. Now, I wouldn\u2019t at all be surprised if it was slightly bearish in the short term if we do see some selling. But I think the future for ETH is so, so bright, and I think Shanghai, assuming it goes off without a hitch as the merge did, then I think 2023 could be a really big year for Ethereum and for ETH...\n\n\u201cPrice prediction, I don\u2019t know\u2026 I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see a five-figure ETH in 2023, but I think that\u2019s entirely possible. We could, of course see, a flippening, but I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m expecting very much kind of sideways price action for ETH over the course of next year.\u201c\n\nOn 19 August 2022, Real Vision Founder and CEO Raoul Pal took to Twitter to say that although he does not expect the Ether price to reach \u201cnew lows\u201d (i.e. go below the June 18 low of $902), there could be a \u201cgut-check quick drop\u201d; however, he also pointed out that for him \u201cnew lows\u201d means that he will buy even more $ETH since he finds Ether\u2019s \u201c2-year risk/reward\u201d quite attractive.\n\nEssentially, Pal believes that at worst, $ETH could fall to the $800-$900 range, but the upside is much bigger since \u2014 as he has said in the past \u2014 he expects the $ETH price to reach $20,000 in the next couple of years.\n\nAh, the old cheeky pre-merge crypto shakeout I see\u2026 I don't expect new lows but most likely a gut-check quick drop, but let's see.\n\n\n\nNew lows = keep adding (for me) as 2-year risk/reward gets really, really attractive\n\n\n\n50% downside vs possible 10x upside = 20:1 R/R#ETH #BTC \u2014 Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) August 19, 2022\n\nOne popular crypto analyst who agrees with Pal\u2019s view that Ethereum will outperform Bitcoin in the next few years is Ben Armstrong, who told his over 880K Twitter followers that he expects $ETH to have a higher market cap than $BTC by 2025:\n\n2017: Ethereum outperformed Bitcoin\n\n2021: Ethereum outperformed Bitcoin\n\n2025: ThIs TiMe It WiLl Be DiFfErEnT\n\n\n\nYea it will be different. Because $ETH will have a higher market cap than $BTC in 2025 \u2014 Ben Armstrong (@Bitboy_Crypto) August 19, 2022\n\nOf course, there are those who believe that Bitcoin might in fact be the best store-of-value asset and that as this view becomes more widely held, the price for one Bitcoin in the next 10 years could easily reach $1 million (something which ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood believes) and maybe even go as high as $23 million (as Blockware Solutions seems to be believe).\n\nRegardless of which of these two cryptocurrencies has more price increase potential in the long term, one thing that seems undeniable is that Bitcoin has much higher regulatory clarity in the U.S. than Ether since both former SEC Chair Jay Clayton and current SEC Chair Gary Gensler have on several occasions have confirmed that they consider Bitcoin to be a commodity rather than a security and therefore outside their purview. Sadly, the same cannot be said about Ether.\n\nApart from what William Hinman, a former Director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Corporation Finance, said during a speech in June 2018, the SEC\u2019s position is that it has never in any official form stated that Ethereum is a commodity or a security, i.e. it is possible (especially if Ripple Labs loses the on-going lawsuit started against it by the SEC in December 2020) that any day in the future the SEC could decide to declare that Ether is a security, which could have a huge negative impact on its price since crypto exchanges in the U.S. would then have to delist it.\n\nSo, although we can\u2019t be certain which of these two cryptocurrencies is a better long-term bet as far profit potential is concerned, at this stage, with the lack of regulatory clarity that we currently have in the U.S., the safer long-term bet seems to be Bitcoin.\n\nIt is important for investors to carefully consider their individual goals and risk tolerance before making a decision. It may be helpful for investors to diversify their portfolio by including both Ether and Bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies and traditional assets. It is also important for investors to be aware of the inherent risks of investing in cryptocurrencies and to carefully research and understand the assets they are considering before making any investments.\n\nImage Credit\n\nFeatured Image via Pixabay"

        "title": "Cryptocurrencies to watch for the week of January 9, 2023 - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "As the first week of 2023 ends, most cryptocurrencies have traded in the green zone after massive sell-offs over the past year. Notably, some assets aim to build on the fuel that has inspired a mini-rally as a foundation for sustained gains.\n\nIn particular, several digital currencies are already standing out, aided by the specific narrative they drive alongside increasing use cases. Therefore, below are the top five cryptocurrencies to watch for the week of January 9.\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nThe flagship cryptocurrency is leading the market in gains after receiving a boost from positive employment data in the United States. Although Bitcoin (BTC) is trading in the shadow of the previous highs, the crypto has sustained solid gains across 2023. At the same time, as the new week starts, Bitcoin\u2019s price remains of focus, especially with more macroeconomic data expected to come out. In this line, the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) and inflation data will likely influence the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy and consequently risk assets like Bitcoin.\n\nNotably, as reported by Finbold, crypto trading expert and analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe stated that inflation data is likely to be good and might spell good fortunes for the asset. Overall, the analyst pointed out that Bitcoin has higher odds of breaking out in the coming week after testing key resistance levels while targeting $17,000.\n\nBy the time of publishing, Bitcoin was trading at $16,943 with daily gains of about 0.1%. On the weekly chart, BTC has rallied over 2%.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nBased on the recent price movement, Bitcoin is attempting to put behind the sideway trading pattern and break above $17,000. However, it is worth noting that moving into 2023, Bitcoin is still facing a cloud of uncertainty, considering the threat of an extended sell-off from incidents such as the FTX crypto exchange collapse and the Fed\u2019s next policy. However, Bitcoin will look forward to building on milestones achieved in 2022 despite the bear market.\n\nFrom a technical analysis perspective, Bitcoin offers mixed signals on the daily gauges. A summary aligns with \u2018neutral\u2019 at 8, while moving averages are for \u2018buy\u2019 at 8. Elsewhere, oscillators recommend the \u2018sell\u2019 sentiment at 3.\n\nBitcoin technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nThe decentralized finance (DeFi) token appears to defy recent concerns about its future due to close ties with the now-collapsed FTX crypto exchange and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Indeed, the concerns resulted in SOL dropping to as low as $8. However, part of the current resurgence resulted in Solana witnessing an over $1.5 billion capital inflow within a week as of January 6.\n\nAlthough SOL has historically rallied in line with the general market, the latest price movement is heavily linked to the hype around the Bonk (BONK) meme cryptocurrency that seeks to emulate Shiba Inu (SHIB). Notably, after BONK was airdropped to Solana non-fungible token (NFT) communities and creators, SOL recorded a surge in value and trading volume.\n\nTherefore, moving into the new week, SOL remains an asset to watch, and the sustainability of the BONK hype. This is vital considering that SOL has no other possible specific bullish triggers for a rally while the effects of FTX collapse are lingering; the network is also facing scrutiny over the constant outages that characterized the platform in 2022.\n\nBy press time, SOL, or the \u2018Ethereum (ETH) killer,\u2019 was trading at $13.85 with gains of almost about 5% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, SOL has gained by over 35%.\n\nSolana seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAmid the short-term gains by SOL, the machine learning algorithm at PricePredictions indicates that SOL is likely to be in a consolidation phase at the current price by the end of the month. The forecast suggests that SOL will trade at $13.75 on January 31, 2023.\n\nElsewhere, Solana\u2019s one-day technical analysis summary indicates the \u2018buy\u2019 sentiment at 10, while moving averages are also for buying at 8.\n\nSolana technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nLido DAO (LDO)\n\nLido DAO, the liquid staking solution for Ethereum, has spiked in value and market cap, to the surprise of most investors. Although the native token of Lido Finance has also moved in accordance with the general market, the latest rally can be linked to the upcoming Ethereum Shanghai upgrade that saw developers set a date before March.\n\nNotably, the upgrade is expected to release staked Ethereum after the Merge update. In this line, Lido Finance accounts for almost 25% of staked Ethereum, making it one of the largest liquid staking platforms for Ethereum. Therefore, with the possibility of more people withdrawing their staked Ethereum after the upgrade, the Lido platform will likely benefit as potential investors use its platform to stake.\n\nConsequently, moving into the week of January 9, investors need to monitor the asset to see if it will sustain the gains. At the moment, the token is facing the possibility of experiencing selling pressure, with the likelihood of investors taking profits remaining high.\n\nBy press time, Lido DAO was trading at $1.61 with daily gains of almost 8%. The weekly chart shows that LDO was up over 60%.\n\nLido DAO seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nBased on TradingView\u2019s technical analysis, LDO is facing bullish sentiments. A summary of the daily gauges is for a \u2018strong buy\u2019 at 16, similar to moving averages at 14. Oscillators are \u2018neutral\u2019 at 8.\n\nLido DAO technical analysis. Source: TradingView.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC)\n\nEthereum Classic\u2019s (ETC) latest rally has seen the Ethereum fork reclaim $20, a position considered a fundamental support level for the asset. Although the trigger for the rally remains vague, ETC has witnessed increased network activity that might influence the price movement.\n\nNotably, the network\u2019s hash rate has spiked recently, translating into a possible surge in miner profitability. It\u2019s worth mentioning that following the Ethereum Merge upgrade, ETC has stood out to benefit, considering ETH miners need minimal upgrades to start mining on the network.\n\nFurthermore, ETC\u2019s price could be benefiting from a short-squeeze approach from its community. For instance, data from the crypto analysis platform Santiment noted that ETC had witnessed increased trading volume alongside being shorted significantly by traders. Therefore, with no formidable trigger, focusing on ETC price will be essential, especially if traders start taking profits.\n\nBy press time, ETC was trading at $20.02 with weekly gains of over 27%.\n\nEthereum Classic seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nFurthermore, ETC technical analysis offers mixed sentiment with a summary aligning with \u2018neutral\u2019 at 9. Moving averages are for \u2018buy\u2019 at 9.\n\nEthereum Classic technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nAcross 2022, Cardano (ADA) attained several milestones, with the network recording sustained development activity that is considered a key catalyst for a possible price rally. Consequently, in the first week of 2023, ADA\u2019s price has gained double digits. It is worth noting that Cardano\u2019s value has mainly followed the general market sentiment in its price trajectory.\n\nInterestingly, ADA has rallied despite the Cardano network being embroiled in an NFT controversy. In particular, founder Charles Hoskison was at the center of attention after initially declining to buy an NFT that he had used for his profile picture on Twitter.\n\nAlthough the rally trigger cannot be instantly identified, ADA\u2019s gains can partly be linked to the Cardano DeFi ecosystem expansion. In this line, ADA\u2019s total locked value has recently witnessed minor gains.\n\nAt the same time, investors\u2019 interest in ADA might be increasingly triggered by sustained whale activity in the token. In the meantime, Cardano continues to rank among cryptocurrencies with the highest development activity on GitHub. Overall, ADA is the center of attention moving into the next week, as the focus will be on the sustainability of the gains.\n\nBy press time, ADA was trading at $0.29 with daily gains of almost 5%. On the weekly chart, Cardano is up 17%.\n\nCardano seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nThe latest gains have thrust ADA technical analysis into the bullish zone. A summary of the daily gauges on TradingView is for \u2018buy\u2019 at 12, similar to moving averages at 9.\n\nCardano technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nIn general, the week of January 9 is huge for the crypto space considering the implication of the upcoming inflation data and how the Federal Reserve will respond. At the same time, the focus will be on how the market reacts to any regulatory outlook considering the Fed recently warned banks against engaging with crypto.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Don\u2019t invest unless prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nJoin Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) story traces back to 2015 when Vitalik Buterin and a team of developers developed the Ethereum network. However, Ethereum was founded in 2013, and developments started in 2014. During this time, 1 ETH was auctioned for $0.31 as part of the developers\u2019 crowdfunding campaign. In the past week, Ethereum price registered good bids above the $1,165 level against the U.S. Dollar, forming a base and slowly moving higher above the $1,180 level.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum price is trading at $1,263, after losing 0.12% in the last 24 hours. The second largest crypto recorded a 24-hour trading volume of $2.57 billion and a live market cap of $154.6 billion, placing it at #2 on CoinMarketCap.\n\nEthereum Investors Hoping For Things To Turn Positive After Last Year\n\nThe year 2022 was a difficult period in the crypto industry, to say the least, as the whole market lost almost 64% in value. Things were somewhat different for Ethereum as the smart contract crypto as it lost 68% in the year, making investors wonder whether things will turn around in 2023.\n\nThe ecosystem saw a huge upgrade, dubbed The Merge, when Ethereum transitioned from the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work mechanism, which naysayers hate about the king crypto Bitcoin, to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism. Ethereum supporters were eager for the second-largest crypto to complete the event as it would result in a much more sustainable and energy-efficient blockchain network.\n\nThe Merge event enabled Ethereum to implement a new feature christened sharding, which splits up the whole Ethereum network load into several distinct portions with their smart contracts. As per information on the official Ethereum website, the network will integrate the sharding upscale sometime within 2023.\n\nWith Ethereum upgrading to a PoS system, together with the sharding possibility, the network has paved the way for the ETH token to position itself for another more expansive adoption. This comes as investors hope the two updates will lead to reduced fees and a rise in network throughput. Should the two positive outcomes prevail, it would have eliminated two of the most prominent criticisms of Ethereum, slow and expensive.\n\nNevertheless, based on data from bitinfocharts.com, Ethereum can only facilitate a speed of 13 transactions per second today, which is far less than what is required to deliver greater adoption. In fairness, there are plenty of unchecked boxes in the Ethereum ecosystem as it is an entirely new technology and unexpected speed bumps may happen.\n\nAdditionally, there is much uncertainty regarding new regulations that may occur following the negative activities that have taken place in the industry throughout 2022. Still, ETH proponents now have tangible advancements that they can point to for confidence with the Ethereum network setting itself up to attain its long-term potential.\n\nWill Ethereum Price Return To $1,400?\n\nEthereum price is currently trading at $1,263 as the bulls target the $1,400 range high. The price is currently relying on the support offered by the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) after it was flipped from resistance on Wednesday, January 4.\n\nCurrently, the bulls are facing immediate resistance at the $1,295 level, which is embraced by the 100-day SMA. If bulls can increase their buying pressure past this hurdle, they can face the next resistance at the $1,350 level. In highly ambitious cases, ETH bulls could push the price to tag the $1,400 psychological level, embraced by the 200-day SMA.\n\nThe relative strength index (RSI) at 50 is advancing toward the positive zone, which shows that the price may increase.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nOn the downside, if the Ethereum price drops further and records a daily candlestick close below the 50-day SMA support, then Ethereum price could drop further to retest the support level at$1,180 and if selling pressure increases, then the price could descend lower to the revisit the range low at $1,165.\n\nOther Projects To Consider In the Second Week of 2023\n\nThe cryptocurrency market witnessed a lot of activities in the past year, but as the year approached its end, many new became cryptos charged up and ready to bring exceptional value to traders and investors alike.

        "content": "Don\u2019t invest unless prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nJoin Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage\n\nEthereum (ETH) struggled most of 2022 after nearing the $5,000 price peg in 2021. The foremost smart contract network\u2019s stunted growth was largely due to yead transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) due to technical difficulties. Despite this, Ethereum maintained a strong presence in non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), and even the metaverse ecosystems.\n\nWith this year just beginning, Ethereum seems set for a phenomenal 2023. Below, we consider some of the major fundamental strengths of the ETH token, its technical performance, and alternative projects value-facing investors can key into this year.\n\nShanghai Upgrade Scheduled For 2023\n\n2022 was a tough year for the emerging crypto industry, and the Ethereum development team\u2019s forestalled PoS migration compounded an already poor situation for the ETH token. After making a record rally to the north of $5,000, the Ether price slipped alongside Bitcoin following an industry-wide incident and the pressures of global economic issues.\n\nETH slipped to a 52-week low of $1,148, losing over 57% of its previous record value. This year, the Ether token is starting on a strong footing as the digital asset has already clocked a week\u2019s increase of 10% with a 30-day breakout of 4.5% so far. This change in fortune has largely been due to recent developments in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAccording to recent reports, the Ethereum network is expected to launch another upgrade to its PoS protocol called Shanghai. This will allow users who have staked their Ether in the last two years to withdraw their funds come March 2023. With staked ETH now unlocked, users can participate in liquidity-providing platforms, thereby increasing their expected turnouts on investment.\n\nThe rapid pace of these new upgrades will also significantly increase investor confidence in the project. Given its previous slow pace in executing network upgrades, the Shanghai launch could speed things up as the foremost smart contract network looks to boost its transaction speed and cut down on exorbitant high gas fees in the coming months.\n\nEther Posts Decent Gain\n\nAt press time, the ETH network token is trading at $1,321, an uptrend of 4.6% in the last 24 hours. Its weekly growth of 10% and a monthly increase of 4.5% show a possible breakout on the horizon. This is further emphasized by a six-month increase of 27.32% and a year-to-date (YTD) of 10.5%.\n\nThese positive results have positively impacted the technicals of the cryptocurrency, which has so far flipped to a \u201cBuy\u201d signal. Its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) price of $1,247 is significantly below its current price action, and the crypto asset\u2019s moving average convergence and divergence (MACD) is trailing on the green trend line, emphasizing a positive market sentiment.\n\nRegarding its relative strength index (RSI), Ether currently holds a 77 figure, putting it in the overbought region. So far, Ethereum is likely on a trail back to the $2,000 price peg but is it the best investment for value-driven investors? Not entirely.\n\nD2T and FGHT Taking the Industry by Storm\n\nThe crypto space has experienced explosive growth despite a significant drop in value. Some of the new entrants have been the D2T and FGHT tokens. Both are currently in their presale stages and are vastly different crypto projects.\n\nD2T is the network token for the Dash 2 Trade blockchain, a data and social analytics project that gives investors detailed information about crypto projects for better investment decisions.\n\n?HEY D2T COMMUNITY? Don't forget \u2013 for the next 2 days you can still buy $D2T tokens in the over-funding round?? \u2705Currently 1 $D2T = 0.0556 USDT. This is the last chance to buy before the listing!https://t.co/ExvBBjKIU6 pic.twitter.com/izAz0ZIYoi \u2014 Dash 2 Trade (@dash2_trade) January 9, 2023\n\nIt provides exchange liquidity levels for all its users to monitor the trading volume of each crypto asset. Besides this, it also incorporates a crypto trading signal, automation, and backtesting functionalities.\n\nDash 2 Trade also affords users the privilege to access newly launched projects in their presale stage before they get listed on crypto exchanges. This way, they can get in on promising projects early enough before they make a market debut.\n\nAnother impressive token is the FGHT, which powers the revolutionary fitness protocol, Fight Out. The project leans towards the Solana-based move-to-earn (M2E) fitness protocol, Stepn but with a twist. It enables users to also take care of their health by participating in challenges in the metaverse space.\n\nGet fit, have fun, and earn rewards with #FightOut! ?

The D2T token has raised over $14.74 million, while the FGHT token has raised $2.79 million. D2T is about rounding up its presale stage, while FGHT is on its way to its second presale stage.\n\nRelated News"
