        "title": "Ethereum's Shanghai Update Opens a Rift in Crypto - WIRED",
        "content": "At 19:27 Eastern time on April 12, the Ethereum blockchain, home to the world\u2019s second-most-popular cryptocurrency, ether, will finally sever its links to crypto mining. Within the Ethereum bubble, a sense of anticipation is building; some are planning \u201cviewing parties\u201d for the occasion. Codenamed \u201cShanghai,\u201d the update to Ethereum caps off a process, after \u201cThe Merge,\u201d which fundamentally changes the way transactions are verified and the network secured.\n\nUnder the old system, proof-of-work (PoW) mining, the right to process a batch of transactions and earn a crypto reward is determined by a race to solve a mathematical puzzle. The greater the computing power miners throw at the problem, the greater their chance of winning the race. Under Ethereum\u2019s new proof-of-stake (PoS) system, there is no race and there are no miners; instead, the winner is determined by raffle. The greater the amount of ether somebody locks up on the network\u2014or stakes\u2014the greater the chance they hold a prize-winning ticket.\n\nBy demonstrating that a large-scale blockchain can shift from one system to another, Shanghai will reignite a debate over whether the practice of mining that still supports bitcoin, the most widely traded cryptocurrency, is viable and sustainable. Figures from the University of Cambridge suggest the Bitcoin network consumed 107 terawatt-hours of energy in 2022\u2014equivalent to that of the Netherlands\u2014of which only just over a quarter came from renewable sources. Prior to The Merge, Ethereum consumed roughly two-thirds as much energy as the Bitcoin network. But the move away from mining has cut that consumption, according to analysis by Alex de Vries, data scientist at De Nederlandsche Bank and creator of Digiconomist, a source of crypto emissions data, by at least 99.84 percent.\n\n\u201cThe energy consumption problem is Bitcoin\u2019s achilles heel,\u201d says de Vries. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple fact that as the price of bitcoin gets higher, the energy consumption problem gets worse. The more money miners make, the more they will typically spend on resources: hardware and electricity.\n\nBut many bitcoiners dispute the characterization of the network as energy-guzzling and carbon intensive, saying that mining is increasingly powered by renewable energy. And, they say, PoS is inferior to PoW\u2014prone to centralization (crypto\u2019s great nemesis), concentrating influence and wealth in the hands of the wealthy, without any mitigating forces, like energy costs, pulling in the opposite direction. All of this makes Shanghai a proxy battle over the future of crypto.\n\nIn bitcoin\u2019s infancy, the cryptocurrency could be mined effectively with just a personal computer and simple software. But as the level of appetite for bitcoin increased, the industry professionalized. Today, the mining scene is dominated by large companies\u2014some publicly traded, like Marathon Digital and Riot Blockchain\u2014that operate gargantuan facilities with rack upon rack of hardware. The largest of these mines, many of which are located in Texas, can draw upwards of 700 MW of power."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a recent series of tweets , Chris Burniske, a well-known analyst, made a bold prediction about the future of Ethereum (ETH). Burniske hinted that Ethereum's price could reach $10,000 by 2025. While this may seem like a stretch, especially considering Ethereum's current price of $1,858, Burniske's optimism should not be disregarded.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBurniske's tweets were seemingly aimed at those who have been consistently bearish on Ethereum, even as its price has risen from $1 to $10, $100 and $1,000. He suggests that the naysayers may have to reconsider their stance as Ethereum continues its upward trajectory, potentially reaching the $10,000 mark by 2025.\n\nThere are several factors that could contribute to Ethereum's bullish rally in the coming years. The recently announced staking contract unlock could lead to increased adoption of Ethereum and its associated technologies, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nFurthermore, the resurgence of interest in blockchain technology and digital currencies from institutional investors may considerably boost Ethereum's value. As an increasing number of institutions start allocating a portion of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies, Ethereum is expected to reap the benefits of heightened demand and investment.\n\nIt is important to highlight that Ethereum's supply dynamics are undergoing a transformation due to the introduction of EIP-1559, which implements a fee-burning mechanism. This modification could render Ethereum scarcer, potentially resulting in a rise in its worth over time.\n\nAlthough Burniske's forecast of Ethereum hitting $10,000 by 2025 may appear excessively optimistic, it is crucial to bear in mind that the crypto market is infamously unstable and erratic. Even the most seasoned experts can have difficulty precisely predicting the future trajectories of digital assets."

        "title": "Ethereum blockchain upgrade unlocks US$34 billion in Ether, what does it mean for crypto prices? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Developers at Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-biggest blockchain with a capitalization of US$231 billion, are set to upgrade the software network on Wednesday with reported new features and improvements to efficiency, cost and security.\n\nHowever, the main feature of the so-called Shanghai upgrade \u2013 to take place at 10:27 p.m. UTC on Wednesday, according to the Ethereum Foundation \u2013 is the EIP-4895. This allows users to withdraw their staked Ether, or tokens deposited to support the operations of a blockchain in return for a passive income, usually in the form of more tokens.\n\nWith around 18 million Ether (US$34.5 billion) \u2013 or about 15% of the total supply \u2013 staked into the network, according to Etherscan, concerns emerged that holders could rush to sell Ether to lock in profits, which would drive prices lower. Ether has risen about 60% so far this year and recently traded at more than US$1,900.\n\nBut on-chain data provider CryptoQuant doesn\u2019t expect a flood of Ether sales, according to a report it released in February.\n\n\u201cWe argue that there would be low selling pressure for Ether from staking withdrawals after the Shanghai upgrade,\u201d CryptoQuant said, adding that the majority of the staked Ether was still holding losses compared to Ether prices when it was staked. Ether reached all time highs of more than US$4,600 in November 2021.\n\n\u201cTypically, selling pressure emerges when market participants are sitting on extreme profits, which is not the case right now for the Ether that has been staked,\u201d CryptoQuant said.\n\nCryptoQuant also pointed out that the currently locked Ether cannot be withdrawn simultaneously, estimating it may take up to a year to withdraw the total value staked in the network,\n\nOther benefits\n\nZhuling Chen, chief executive officer of crypto staking service provider RockX, said some short-term market volatility is to be expected following the upgrade, but he preferred to focus on the \u201csubstantial\u201d long-term benefits to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s capacity to handle more transactions per second increases, transaction costs decrease, and the security and efficiency of smart contracts improve,\u201d Chen said in a statement. The staking landscape will be transformed and Ethereum will become the benchmark yield for crypto, Chen added.\n\nThat\u2019s a view shared by Alex Esin, chief executive officer of P2P.org, which offers institutional staking and blockchain development services. Expect a substantial increase in staking activity in the year following the Shanghai upgrade, Esin said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe do not anticipate a massive unstaking once this functionality goes live,\u201d Esin said.\n\nGuilhem Chaumont, chief executive officer of crypto-financial service Flowdesk, points out the system to withdraw staked Ether could itself prevent a sell off in the token.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to realize that the withdrawal queue only allows a limited set of requests per day (115,200), so while there may be sustained downward pressure on the price, unstaking is not likely to cause a sharp, sudden dip,\u201d he said in an emailed comment.\n\nChaumont said it\u2019s more likely a sizable portion of Ether will remain staked \u201cwith staking rewards outperforming current interest rates.\u201d\n\nOverreact?\n\nKen Timsit, head of Cronos Labs, the accelerator of the Cronos chain that links the Ethereum and Cosmos blockchains, did caution that Ether stakers will monitor withdrawals after the Shanghai upgrade kicks in and may potentially overreact if there is significant withdrawal demand.\n\n\u201cOnce short-term volatility has been smoothed out, however, it is likely that the outcome will be neutral given that this upgrade has been priced into Ether value for some time,\u201d Timsit said in an emailed comment.\n\nDanny Chong, co-founder of Tranchess, a decentralized app that offers Ethereum services, said the Shanghai upgrade will lower the risks associated with liquid staking and \u201cshould see increased institutional participation.\u201d\n\nLiquid staking, also known as soft staking, allows investors to access their locked funds for other crypto-based activities while still earning rewards. Users with deposits locked on liquid staking platforms receive a tokenized version of their crypto assets, which then can be stored or traded elsewhere.\n\nThe total value of crypto assets locked in liquid staking services stood at US$17.3 billion on Tuesday, up from US$14 billion on March 1, making liquid staking the second-largest service in decentralized finance, following decentralized exchanges, according to data provider DefiLlama.\n\n\u201cEarning yield from liquid staking shares similarities with certain traditional financial instruments such as bonds or stocks that offer interest payments,\u201d Chong said. \u201cHence it would likely attract TradFi [traditional finance] participants who are familiar with such instruments.\u201d\n\nChen of RockX shared similar views: \u201cWe will see more innovations coming from direct and liquid staking solutions, and liquid staking will start playing a much larger role in the cryptocurrency space.\u201d\n\nSome cryptocurrency exchanges have also spotted opportunities to expand their staking products. For example, Singapore-based crypto exchange Bybit last month launched a new staking pool in time for the Shanghai upgrade.\n\n\u201cThe highly liquid and trading-integrated ETH staking options we will be rolling out around the time of Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade will open up many new opportunities for our users,\u201d Ben Zhou, chief executive officer of Bybit, said in a March statement.\n\nSee related article: What impact will Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade have on ETH and crypto markets?"

        "title": "Why the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Will Lead to War - Blockworks",
        "content": "DeFi industry: There is a new war on the horizon. Unlike the Curve Wars, fought over stablecoin liquidity dominance, this war will be fought over the future of liquid staking tokens.\n\nThe catalyst for this upcoming battle?\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghai fork, set to take place on April 12, when more than 18 million in staked ether (~$34.2 billion) will become unlocked and battlelines will be drawn.\n\nI believe that Shanghai will provoke a period of intense competition among liquid staking protocols that will come to be known as the \u201cLiquid Staking Wars\u201d \u2014 albeit wars that will ultimately benefit the entire industry.\n\nThose of us who were here for DeFi Summer will remember the Curve Wars well: the ruthless competition between the emerging stablecoin protocols, who \u201cfought\u201d on the Curve DEX to have the deepest liquidity and most diverse set of liquidity pairings.\n\nLet\u2019s review the ingredients that precipitated the Curve Wars:\n\n1) a DEX Automated Market Maker (AMM) especially designed for trading stablecoins (Curve);\n\n2) a mechanism for protocols to incentivize liquidity providers (LPs) to move from LPing one stablecoin to another (Curve incentive contracts);\n\nand 3) a bunch of new stablecoin protocols jockeying for market share (USDC, USDT, DAI, FRAX, LUSD, etc).\n\nI see striking similarities with the Curve Wars in the burgeoning competition between protocols that offer liquid staking tokens (LSTs) \u2014 yield-bearing tokens that allow holders to stay liquid while enjoying the yield from staked ETH.\n\nWe already see the same ingredients coalescing with:\n\n1) novel DEX AMM protocols especially designed to facilitate LPing liquid staking token (LST) pairs;\n\n2) incentive contracts that LST protocols can use to reward LST LPs; and\n\n3) a cascade of emerging LST protocols vying for market share.\n\nThe Liquid Staking Wars have one last different ingredient \u2014 the imminent Shanghai upgrade that will enable LPs to easily and cheaply unstake ETH from one LST and move it to another LST.\n\nThe Liquid Staking Wars will be won by whichever protocol can capture the most TVL and volume for their LST. I believe that the battle for LST supremacy will see its first skirmishes by early May and that it will have a lasting impact on the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nAfter all staked Ethereum becomes unlocked in mid-April, unstaked ETH holders will be incentivized to move their ETH from one liquidity staking token solution to another, always seeking the highest potential returns in liquidity pools. LST protocols will likewise be incentivized to capture market share by having their token be the most liquid.\n\nThis war \u2014 or competition between LST protocols to provide the dominant asset in crypto \u2014 will reshape all crypto pairs across all DEXs.\n\nLiquidity provider (LP) strategies will also evolve based on the yield-bearing characteristics of LSTs; DEXs will evolve their offerings to accommodate this new landscape; and the DeFi industry will benefit from a wave of innovation (as we see in most periods of increased competition).\n\nThe Liquid Staking Wars\u2019 tactics will mirror those of the Curve Wars\n\nWe will see LST protocols attempt to differentiate themselves through innovation, usability and yield. The most obvious mechanism will be yield: LST protocols will seek to maximize the incentives for LPs to fund liquidity pools using their LST over any other LST.\n\nPost Shanghai, there will be a big opportunity cost for LPs who add liquidity to ETH-denominated pools instead of pools denominated in an LST. The ETH LPs will be foregoing ~4% return for no good reason.\n\nEven pre-Shanghai, we have seen a massive demand for LST yield: Liquid staking tokens have skyrocketed in total value locked (TVL) to account for more than $14 billion, according to DeFiLlama as of April 3, 2023. The LST sector is second only to the current size of all decentralized exchange protocols combined.\n\nSome may claim that Lido \u2014 with a near 75% of LST TVL market share \u2014 has won the war before it has even begun. But while Lido has established itself as a leader, entrants such as Frax, Coinbase, Rocket Pool, and new protocols that have yet to launch are jockeying for position to have their LST become the preeminent ETH replacement.\n\nAs with any war, the winners and losers will be defined by strategically deploying the right set of tactics on the battlefield.\n\nThis competition \u2014 and specifically the competitive incentivization of liquidity pools it will entail \u2014 should also benefit other participants across the DeFi ecosystem. LSTs have a place not just paired with each other or with ETH in pools, but also with other utility tokens. For example, instead of WBTC-ETH being a popular pool on DEXs, I expect to see WBTC-WSTETH, WBTC-cbETH or WBTC-rETH.\n\nI expect a groundswell of co-incentive liquidity pool structures pairing utility and yield tokens. These partnerships should benefit long-tail tokens by providing the liquidity required to build their businesses, as well as some of the most well-known utility tokens seeking to expand their influence.\n\nIn addition to maximizing incentives into liquidity pools, subtle differences in Automated Market Makers (AMMs) can provide significant advantages to LST protocols \u2014 especially considering how LSTs gain value over time from the yield of underlying staked ETH. This intrinsic value-growth dictates that LPs will need to more closely monitor their positions to keep their liquidity active as prices move. Pairing with an AMM that can maximize LP capital efficiency for an LST pair, as an example, can provide significant benefit.\n\nI anticipate increased innovation from DEXs, specifically around the functionality of AMMs. To win the Liquid Staking Wars, protocols will need a set of tools to incentivize the liquidity of their liquid staking tokens using minimal incentives and maximum efficiency. Protocols that can boost LP incentives through this type of \u201csurgical incentivization\u201d and provide greater capital efficiency will ease the capital requirement burden from LSTs. This will in turn enable the LSTs to maximize their return on incentives, and capture a greater market share.\n\nFor stakers and LPs, it\u2019s essential to understand the financials (fees, etc.) before they stake or provide liquidity on a particular platform. As mentioned, due to the unique return structure of LSTs, some existing AMMs are not capital efficient for LST liquidity. This is because LSTs and the unique liquidity challenges they represent did not exist when these AMMs were developed.\n\nFor instance, infinite-range AMMs like Sushi, Balancer, and Uniswap v2 are known to have low efficiency for almost any pair. But even Range AMMs like Uniswap v3 and related forks can have a low efficiency for an ETH-LST pair, because the price in the AMM will continuously exceed the LP\u2019s range unless the LP actively manages their position or stakes a very wide price range. In addition to the incentives offered, LPs must be aware of these crucial structural details of the protocols before they deploy their capital.\n\nEven though I am calling this next phase in DeFi after Shanghai a \u201cwar,\u201d what it\u2019s ultimately leading to is more liquidity injected into the ecosystem. And with greater capital efficiency in liquidity pools ushering in an era of more \u201cactive capital,\u201d these volumes will be more consistently utilized to the benefit of the entire industry.\n\nBob Baxley is a technologist, entrepreneur, and builder of technology companies. Bob is the core builder at Maverick Protocol, a new infrastructure for decentralized finance built to facilitate the most liquid markets for traders, liquidity providers, DAO treasuries, and developers. Bob designed Maverick AMM, a revolutionary Dynamic Distribution AMM that provides greater capital efficiency and control for liquidity providers.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum will conclude its two-year transition to proof of stake this week with the launch of the Shanghai upgrade on April 12. The move will introduce a number of technical improvements to the network, but most Ethereum traders only care about one thing: staking withdrawals.\n\nWith more than 18 million ETH\u2014worth roughly $34 billion\u2014locked up on the Ethereum network set to finally become available to validators, investors are understandably uneasy about what this might mean for the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nAndrew Thurman, a data analyst at Nansen, told Decrypt that in his view price impact in the short-term, however, will be \u201ca little bit more muted\u201d than community expectations suggest.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlso known by its consensus name Capella, Shanghai ends the two-year lockup period on staked ETH and its corresponding rewards. If all goes well, Ethereum stakers will be able to begin sending withdrawal requests to the network immediately after Shanghai goes live\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean users will receive the funds on day one. Because of the anticipated length of the withdrawal queue, holders may have to wait weeks to months to retrieve their assets.\n\n\u201cWith many speculating whether this event will cause a massive sell-off in price, it\u2019s important to realize that the withdrawal queue only allows a limited set of requests per day (115,200),\u201d Guilhem Chaumont, CEO and co-founder of Flowdesk, said in a statement shared with Decrypt. \u201cSo while there may be sustained downward pressure on the price, unstaking is not likely to cause a sharp, sudden dip.\u201d\n\nIndividual stakers, those who were able to pony up at least 32 ETH (worth approximately $60,000 at today\u2019s prices) themselves, can expect to wait at least two to three days to have withdrawal requests processed, Ethereum developers previously explained to Decrypt. Those staking through pools and other service providers, such as Lido or crypto exchanges like Coinbase, may have to wait several weeks or even months to withdraw their funds.\n\nAnd besides the wait times, others point out that the availability of liquid staking services such as Lido means that traders who have wanted the ability to trade staked ETH have been able to do so even before Shanghai.\n\n\u201cMost people have been able to sell [staked ETH] for quite some time, because the majority of ETH is being staked through platforms with liquid staking tokens, like Lido or Rocket Pool,\u201d Jacob Cantele, head of product at Ethereum layer-2 Mantle, previously told Decrypt. \u201cSo I don't actually think [Shanghai] represents a major shift in the economics of Ethereum.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMatthew Niemerg, co-founder of privacy-enhancing blockchain network Aleph Zero, concurs: \u201cTo be more direct, it's priced in,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is entirely possible that there will be more people willing to stake ETH (locking up liquidity and reducing the available supply) after the upgrade, as people will be more certain that they can safely unstake their ETH,\" said Niemerg.\n\nNansen\u2019s Thurman believes that while the short-term price action may be lackluster, Shanghai may give Ethereum investors reason to be more bullish in the long term.\n\n\u201cIt's gonna take a while for people to really understand what the dynamics are regarding whether or not this is a bullish or bearish action in the short to medium term,\u201d he said. \u201cI will say, though, that on a long enough time horizon, it's really difficult to come up with a thesis that isn't wildly bullish.\u201d\n\nThurman argues that the reason for this is the enhanced business use-case for crypto custody. In recent years, major banks including JPMorgan Chase, Standard Chartered, and CACEIS have increasingly shown interest in cryptocurrency custody, a service which refers to the safekeeping and management of securities or financial assets on behalf of consumer clients.\n\n\u201cCustody is going to get much more competitive,\u201d Thurman told Decrypt, \u201cbecause suddenly you can custody ETH as a bank, or as one of these solutions, for low to no fees. I think that\u2019s going to lead to a lot of locked up [ETH]. And of course, that's going to be great for the price in the long run,\u201d he said.\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "content": "In its newly launched Fortune Crypto 40 benchmark, the media firm ranked the top 5 firms in the crypto space in each of the eight categories.\n\nThe categories include centralized finance (CeFi), traditional finance (TradFi), Venture Capital, Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Data, Infrastructure, decentralized finance (DeFi), and Protocols.\n\nTo find the top 40 firms, Fortune used various empirical metrics along with surveys of over 200 financial executives conducted by Researchscape. Fortune claims the results are \u201cimpartial and rigorous.\u201d\n\nThe top 40 crypto firms by category\n\nThe benchmark ranked the Ethereum Foundation as the top protocol, followed by Bitcoin. Polygon Labs, which develops Ethereum scaling solutions, and Solana Foundation, the non-profit responsible for developing the Solana ecosystem, ranked third and fourth, respectively. Offchain Labs, the firm behind Ethereum scaling solutions provider Arbitrum, secured the fifth position in the Protocols category.\n\nCoinbase topped the CeFi category, followed by Binance and Kraken. Mike Novogratz-led Galaxy Digital and USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin issuer Circle grabbed the fourth and fifth positions in the benchmark.\n\nPayPal\u2019s integration with MetaMask placed it at the top of the TradFi category, which ranked the top 5 firms innovating with blockchain technology. Stock trading platform Robinhood, which enables crypto trading, came in second, followed by JP Morgan Chase, which launched its own blockchain Onyx.\n\nFidelity, which received flak for allowing pensioners to invest part of their retirement funds in Bitcoin, ranked fourth, while Visa secured the fifth position.\n\nPolychain Capital ranked first in the VC category, followed by Animoca Brands and Andreessen Horowitz. The last two spots in the category went to Pantera Capital and Blockchain Capital.\n\nAs the largest NFT marketplace, OpenSea secured the top position in the NFT category. Yuga Labs, which launched some of the top NFT collections, including Bored Ape Yacht Club and Mutant Ape Yacht Club, ranked second.\n\nSky Mavis, creator of the popular NFT game Axie Infinity, and generative art NFT platform Art Blocks ranked third and fourth, respectively. RTFKT, which Nike acquired in 2021, is the fifth NFT firm in the benchmark.\n\nIn the data category, Chainalysis ranked first, followed by Coin Metrics and The Graph. Dune and Messari secured the two other spots.\n\nThe Fortune benchmark also included crypto firms that offer infrastructure for the industry. Non-custodial wallet provider Ledger topped the category. Bitcoin mining giant Genesis Digital Assets, not to be confused with the Digital Currency Group lender that filed for bankruptcy, secured the second spot.\n\nBitcoin mining chip developer Bitmain ranked third, followed by Alchemy, which provides plug-and-play tools to build products and services on blockchains. Crypto payment solution MoonPay ranked fifth in the infrastructure category.\n\nDeFi is all about Ethereum\n\nFortune listed Uniswap Labs, Lido, MakerDAO, Aave, and Curve as the top five contenders in the DeFi category. It is worth noting that all the DeFi applications are built on Ethereum.\n\nIn fact, according to DefiLlama data, these are the top five DeFi applications in terms of total value locked (TVL). The five DeFi applications have over $31 billion in TVL at the time of writing, as per DefiLlama.\n\nFurthermore, the Fortune benchmark includes a high number of Ethereum-based applications, not to mention that two out of the five top protocols are Ethereum scaling services.\n\nBut the focus on Ethereum may have been a result of the fact that Ethereum controls nearly 70% of all DeFi activity.\n\nMentioned in this article"

But like almost everything else in the digital-asset world these days, the long-anticipated tweaks won\u2019t come without complications.\n\nThe overhaul, dubbed Shanghai, follows last year\u2019s game-changing \u201cMerge,\u201d which replaced power-hungry computers with a process involving staked, or pledged, Ether tokens and so-called validators to order transactions on the most commercially successful crypto network. Now, Shanghai will allow withdrawals for the first time by owners of Ether who have staked their coins since December 2020. Owners of the cryptocurrency who stake earn a yield that is paid out in additional Ether tokens."

        "content": "Polygon outperformed Ethereum in terms of activity over the last 24 hours.\n\nHowever, TVL growth for Polygon remains low as DEX volume declined.\n\nPolygon [MATIC] has emerged as a prominent L2 solution in recent years, with several partnerships and an influx of NFT migrations contributing to its ability to remain competitive with other layer 2 solutions.\n\nRead Polygon\u2019s [MATIC] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nAs per the data shared by Token Terminal, Polygon surpassed Ethereum [ETH] in daily active addresses owing to these factors. In the previous 24 hours, the count of daily active addresses on the Polygon network stood at 399,950, while Ethereum recorded 376,350 users.\n\nThe surge in activity on Polygon can be attributed to several factors, and one of them is the performance of its dApps. Notably, well-known dApps like Planet IX observed a significant increase in both active addresses and volume, with the latter rising by 15.29% in the last month.\n\nThe NFT market of Polygon also experienced a surge in interest, and this can be linked to the migration of y00ts NFT. After the transfer to the Polygon network, the y00ts NFT witnessed a notable rise in both volume and the count of holders.\n\nSince the migration started on 28 March, y00ts\u2019 secondary sales saw $4.6M in volume from 1,043 sales, averaging $4,461 per sale.\n\nNot all roses and sunshine\n\nHowever, Polygon faced some challenges in the DeFi space, particularly in its DEX volume. Compared to other Layer 2 solutions, such as Arbitrum [ARB], Polygon\u2019s DEX volume saw a significant decline. This had a knock-on effect on the total value locked (TVL) on the network, which also experienced a decrease.\n\nPolygon\u2019s native token, MATIC, was also facing some setbacks. Santiment\u2019s data revealed that the overall transaction count on the network saw a decline, and the price of MATIC dropped from $1.16 to $1.096 during this period.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Polygon Profit Calculator\n\nDespite the price correction, there was a lack of interest in MATIC among new addresses, which was evident from the declining network growth.\n\nOnly time will tell whether Polygon\u2019s surge in daily activity will have a positive impact on the price in the future."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe future of Ethereum as it relates to its scaling capabilities has been placed under deep scrutiny as the role of the growing horde of Layer 2 protocols in tapering down associated fees is being analyzed. According to data from L2Fees, the majority of L2 protocols have significantly lower fees associated with transfers and swaps of assets when compared with Ethereum's.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer the data, Loopring ranks as the cheapest platform to conduct transactions as the average cost to send Ethereum is pegged at $0.03, while swapping costs $0.05.\n\nArbitrum (ARB), Polygon's zkEVM and zkSync Era require 6 cents, 16 cents and 5 cents, respectively. While these protocols are notably more efficient, the fact that they are able to combine speed and low cost when compared to Ethereum has already positioned them as outfits with immense potential.\n\nImage Source: L2Fees.Info\n\nEthereum, despite its soaring gas fees, is still the most robust blockchain protocol in the world, though there has been an ongoing targeted rebrand in the network's features as a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol. While a push to higher scalability is in the works, the best way to make use of the Ethereum protocol easily at this time is via the associated L2 protocol.\n\nAre L2s enough?\n\nThe majority of Layer 2 protocols out there make use of the Zero Knowledge Proof technology to verify transactions. zk-Proof, as it is fondly called, helps convey verification information faster in a way that frees up additional data that can drag down transaction processing.\n\nTo date, it is considered the most viable way to fully commercialize the Ethereum blockchain, as many transactions can be bundled and confirmed at the same time and for much less. While these technologies are still undergoing active development, they represent the best avenue to onboard the next billion users into the Ethereum ecosystem."

        "content": "Etherscan, a block explorer for the Ethereum blockchain, announced on April 10 a feature that is designed to prevent users from falling victim to scams.\n\nEtherscan to hide zero-value transfers\n\nEtherscan said that, in order to protect users from scams called address poisoning attacks, it will hide zero-value token transfers by default.\n\nWhile the site previously greyed out zero-value transactions, those transactions are now hidden entirely under the new feature, as seen below.\n\nDuring an address poisoning attack, a scammer creates a \u201cspoofed\u201d address that is nearly identical to one that their target has previously transacted with. The scammer then sends zero-value transfers from the spoofed address to the target\u2019s address. The target may confuse the two similar addresses and direct funds to the spoofed address by mistake.\n\nBecause this approach depends on user error and is a type of phishing, hiding transactions that contain no value can make the scam far less alluring to its victims.\n\nEtherscan noted that preventing scams in a neutral manner is \u201can infinite cat-and-mouse game\u201d and said that it recognized the value of \u201cuncensored\u201d blockchain records. As such, users will be able to toggle the option in settings, it said.\n\nEtherscan already includes other anti-scam features: for example, it flags addresses that are known to be involved in scams and hacks.\n\nZero-value attacks increasingly common\n\nThe type of scam in question has gained wider attention in the crypto industry. Two blockchain firms, X-explore and WuBlockchain, estimated that zero-value transfer phishing and related attacks have resulted in up to $32 million in thefts on Ethereum.\n\nCoinbase, meanwhile, suggested that this type of attack originated in November 2022 and had led to $19 million of thefts on various platforms by February 2023.\n\nThe Ethereum-focused wallet Metamask also warned of address poisoning scams in January 2023 and provided users with ways to protect themselves."

        "title": "Even as ETH 2.0 deposit contracts surge, why are investors on the sidelines - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "ETH is winning on the staking side, but other metrics underline lower network activity.\n\nDemand slows down limiting ETH\u2019s potential upside.\n\nInvestors keeping a close eye on Ethereum [ETH] may have noticed that investor interest was limited despite the hype surrounding the Shanghai upgrade. Meanwhile, at press time, some network developments underpinned substantial activity in its preparation.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nAccording to 9 April\u2019s Glassnode data, the amount of liquidity locked in ETH 2.0 deposit contracts has not only been rising but is at a new ATH. Such an observation would normally be associated with more confidence in the market, and also in line with a major development.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Total Value in the ETH 2.0 Deposit Contract just reached an ATH of 17,330,295 ETH View metric:https://t.co/SzbMPqvhlb pic.twitter.com/d5o6D7bFpX \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) April 9, 2023\n\nThe timing of the growth in ETH 2.0 deposit contracts suggests that it might be heavily influenced by the countdown to the Shanghai upgrade. One potential reason for this is that ETH holders are locking their ETH on staking facilities so that they can earn passive rewards. Is this is in anticipation of increasing trading activities near, during, and after the upgrade? Not really, according to these metrics.\n\nEthereum network activity slows down\n\nETH\u2019s daily active addresses have been declining, and at press time, were down to their lowest in the last seven days. This translates to lower transactions and thus, lower gas fees. It is therefore no surprise that ETH gas fees have also been at their lowest level in the last four weeks.\n\nLower gas fees, despite growing ETH 2.0 deposit contracts, may indicate a lack of organic growth underpinned by lower transactions. This meant that at press time, there was low demand for ETH. Higher gas fees are usually observed in times of strong network growth and usage, as network participants were willing to pay a premium under such conditions.\n\nActive deposits have also slowed down in the last few days, in line with the above observations. Therefore, Ethereum experienced negative network growth, especially in the last seven days. Its network growth metric fell to the lowest weekly level in the last 24 hours at press time.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nETH enthusiasm thwarted\n\nThe declining network activity, despite a surge in ETH 2.0 deposits, reflected ETH\u2019s price action. It closed last week on a net gain thanks to a strong bullish performance in the first half of the week. However, a mid-week pivot followed by a 5.6% correction to its $1838 press time ensured that most of retail buyers during the week got trapped.\n\nDespite the mid-week retracement, there was some excitement that fueled the rally at the start of the week. This was enough for a new YTD high as the price drew closer to the highly coveted $2000 price level. However, the second half ultimately revealed the state of low demand."

        "title": "Comparing Ethereum's Layer 2 Solutions: A Look at zkSync, Arbitrum, and Optimism - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum has been facing scalability issues, high gas fees, and network congestion. To address these problems, several projects are developing layer 2 solutions that aim to improve the performance and user experience of Ethereum without compromising its security and decentralization. Three of the most prominent layer 2 solutions are zkSync, Arbitrum, and Optimism. In this article, we will compare these solutions in terms of their advantages, disadvantages, and overall performance.\n\nzkSync:\n\nzkSync is a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum that uses zero-knowledge proofs to enable fast and cheap transactions without compromising security or decentralization. zkSync aims to bring the benefits of blockchain technology to mainstream users by providing a user-friendly interface, low fees, high throughput, and privacy guarantees. zkSync supports smart contracts, NFTs, and various tokens, and is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). zkSync also offers a developer-friendly environment with SDKs, APIs, and documentation to help developers build and deploy scalable applications on zkSync.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nzkSync can reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored on Ethereum, which lowers the gas costs and increases the throughput.\n\nzkSync can achieve up to 2000 TPS and sub-cent fees per transaction.\n\nzkSync supports smart contracts written in Solidity.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nzkSync relies heavily on ZKPs, which can be complex and expensive to implement.\n\nzkSync may face issues with privacy and data availability.\n\nArbitrum:\n\nArbitrum is a layer-2 blockchain for Ethereum using optimistic rollups as scaling technology. It processes transactions on its proprietary sidechain and relays the new chain state to the Ethereum mainnet. Arbitrum aims to improve Ethereum\u2019s performance by providing a more efficient and scalable environment for decentralized applications and smart contracts. Arbitrum benefits from the security and compatibility of Ethereum, but reduces the fees and congestion that users face on the mainnet. Arbitrum has attracted many developers and projects to its ecosystem, and has launched its own token, ARB, which is used for governance and incentives.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nArbitrum can reduce the amount of computation that needs to be done on Ethereum, which lowers the gas costs and increases the throughput.\n\nArbitrum can achieve up to 4500 TPS and sub-dollar fees per transaction.\n\nArbitrum supports smart contracts written in Solidity or any other language that compiles to EVM bytecode.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nArbitrum may face issues with data availability and security.\n\nArbitrum\u2019s challenge period can be up to one week, which can lead to slower finality and higher latency.\n\nOptimism:\n\nOptimism is a layer-2 scaling protocol for the Ethereum network. The scaling solution works by moving transactions and computations from layer-1 (L1) onto a second layer, thus reducing transaction fees and increasing network throughput. Optimism is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which means that any smart contract or decentralized application (dApp) that runs on Ethereum can also run on Optimism with minimal changes. Optimism uses a technique called optimistic rollups, which are batches of transactions that are executed on the second layer and periodically posted to the main chain. Optimism also employs a fraud-proof system, which allows anyone to challenge an invalid transaction and revert it if proven wrong.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nOptimism\u2019s OVM is compatible with EVM, making it easier for developers to write smart contracts.\n\nOptimism has a shorter challenge period than Arbitrum, which leads to faster finality and lower latency.\n\nOptimism can achieve up to 1000 TPS and sub-dollar fees per transaction.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nOptimism\u2019s OVM removes some opcodes that are not necessary for layer 2 execution, which may limit its functionality.\n\nOptimism may face trade-offs in terms of security due to its design choices.\n\nConclusion\n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s clear that zkSync, Arbitrum, and Optimism are all promising solutions for Ethereum\u2019s scalability and cost issues. Each one has its own unique features and drawbacks, so it really depends on what the user is looking for.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty impressive how the Ethereum community is constantly finding ways to improve the platform\u2019s performance and user experience, while still keeping its core values of security and decentralization intact. As Ethereum continues to evolve, we\u2019re excited to see what new developments will come up in the world of layer 2 solutions. Who knows what the future of decentralized finance and other Ethereum-based applications will look like!\n\nMore from DeFi"

        "content": "Forks in Crypto are a perfect example of decentralization in action. The beauty of open-source, decentralized blockchain protocols is that anyone can suggest new rules and functionalities that improve the network.\n\nDespite blockchain forks having existed for years, there\u2019s still plenty of confusion around what they are and how they work. Key milestones like Cardano\u2019s (ADA) Vasil upgrade or Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) Merge are much more than catchy names, they\u2019re hard forks that improve the chain with new features.\n\nWhy do cryptocurrency forks happen and what do they mean for a blockchain network? What are the different kinds of blockchain forks and are they always for the best of the ecosystem?\n\nWhat is a Fork in Cryptocurrency?\n\nAs we all know, a blockchain network is a chain of data interconnected by units called blocks. When new blocks are created, they reference the data and events of previous blocks, which is why we can trace every transaction on the Bitcoin network right back to its genesis.\n\nWhen a blockchain fork occurs, it creates a permanent divergence from the network\u2019s latest version. Like branches on a tree, a blockchain split causes a new version of the network to run, often with new features and new rules, like a change in block size.\n\nThis process is called forking and essentially creates a new blockchain without changing the old version of the blockchain. In most cases, the new chain benefits from software upgrades voted in by community members.\n\nWhy Do Forks Happen?\n\nForks in crypto help blockchain networks improve. For example, the Alonzo hard fork introduced smart contracts to the Cardano blockchain. Ethereum\u2019s iconic hard fork, \u2018The Merge,\u2019 transitioned the network to a Proof-of-Stake algorithm, making it more scalable and energy efficient.\n\nOf course, not all forks stand the test of time and fulfill their vision of becoming new and improved versions of old chains. Bitcoin forks, despite being cheaper and more efficient networks, were never able to usurp Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s original and become the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency.\n\nJust like in your kitchen drawer, not all blockchain forks are created equal. Let\u2019s take a look at what types of forks exist and how they\u2019re different.\n\nThe Different Types of Blockchain Forks\n\nThere are two primary kinds of forks in the crypto world. In most cases, blockchain forks are recognized as either hard forks or soft forks. Both varieties serve the same purpose but have slight differences.\n\nAn easy way to understand the difference between hard forks and soft forks is to imagine upgrading your computer. In this example, a soft fork is like installing new software like an updated operating system. On the other hand, a hard fork is like replacing your computer entirely.\n\nHard Forks\n\nIn a hard fork, a significant upgrade means that the network effectively splits into two separate chains. Changes to the blockchain protocol are not backward-compatible, meaning that the new chain will not recognize the old chain. Node operators need to upgrade their software, or else the network won\u2019t recognize their new blocks.\n\nWhen this happens, node operators and community members need to make an important decision. Will they continue to use the updated software protocols of the new chain? Or would they rather stick to the old rules and the previous version of the software?\n\nIf there is enough community support for the old chain and the old rules, the pre-fork chain may continue to exist. This is why we still have networks like Ethereum Classic.\n\nIf a hard fork creates a new chain that means it also creates a new coin. Because a fork is a split of an existing chain, you can usually expect to have new cryptocurrency tokens. For example, if you held 1 Ether during The Merge, you would also have 1 Ether on the Ethereum PoW chain that still exists alongside the new Ethereum PoS chain.\n\nSoft Forks\n\nA soft fork occurs when changes occur to the network, but nodes and miners aren\u2019t required to upgrade themselves to continue participating in the blockchain. These nodes can still create new blocks under the new rules.\n\nIn blockchain technology, a soft fork is like a light software update. Any new blocks still recognize the existing network and node operators, so it doesn\u2019t force a blockchain split and result in a new blockchain.\n\nDeFi Application Forks\n\nIf you have any experience in the wild world of decentralized finance, you\u2019ve probably heard the word \u2018fork\u2019 mentioned in a slightly different way. DeFi application forks are essentially copies of existing platforms and smart contracts that might feature slight alterations.\n\nTo give you an example, think of the UniSwap decentralized exchange. The project is completely open source, so anyone can dive into the application\u2019s source code to see how it works. As more blockchain networks, like BNB Chain and Polygon, emerged, these networks needed their own DEXes for users to trade tokens on.\n\nInstead of building new apps and code from scratch, it\u2019s much easier to simply copy, or \u2018fork\u2019 an existing platform that works well. If you check the source code for QuickSwap, the leading DEX on Polygon, you\u2019ll see that all its basic code and functionality are directly copied from UniSwap\u2019s code.\n\nForking dApps is a common practice in the DeFi world. A comprehensive list of crypto projects created from forks is available on DefiLlama.\n\nHistoric Blockchain Forks\n\nCrypto history is full of crucial forks that have helped blockchain protocols address dangerous security issues and improve the most popular networks. Some of these hard forks have resulted in new coins that have held their position in the Top 100 cryptos by market cap for years on end.\n\nEven Dogecoin (DOGE), the most famous meme coin in the crypto market, was born from a fork of other networks. The Dogecoin blockchain was forked from LuckyCoin, which was in turn a Litecoin fork.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Forks\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain is the oldest and best-known cryptocurrency network in the world. Naturally, many developers have tried to fork Bitcoin and create new and improved networks.\n\nBitcoin Cash\n\nIn August 2017, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) made history by becoming the first-ever fork of the Bitcoin blockchain. Like the original Bitcoin, BCH has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins.\n\nBitcoin Cash features a larger block size, meaning that the network can process more transactions per second than the original Bitcoin network. It\u2019s also cheaper to use, with lower transaction fees.\n\nThis Bitcoin fork is also called the SegWit upgrade, named after the initial proposal that eventually resulted in the Bitcoin Cash hard fork.\n\nBitcoin Gold\n\nAnother fork of the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin Gold aims to provide a more scalable alternative to Bitcoin as a payment network. Bitcoin Gold\u2019s vision was to make Bitcoin mining accessible to everyone. The forked network used common GPUs to mine new coins, instead of Bitcoin\u2019s competitive and intensive ASIC mining rigs.\n\nUltimately, Bitcoin Gold was more of a passion project than a genuine competitor. Its community appears to have abandoned the network. There have been no updates to the Bitcoin Gold site since 2021.\n\nEthereum Forks\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain has certainly witnessed a messy history, but you don\u2019t become the future of finance without overcoming some challenges along the way. Fortunately, the Ethereum community is resilient, as proven through several significant hard forks throughout the network\u2019s lifespan.\n\nEthereum Classic\n\nThe story of Ethereum Classic is an essential part of crypto history. It involves a historic hack worth hundreds of millions and a \u2018gross misuse\u2019 of blockchain technology from Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum community.\n\nThe DAO was an investment group created in the early days of the Ethereum blockchain. In 2016, the DAO successfully raised over 150 million dollars worth of ETH, with the intention of becoming a venture capitalist firm in the emerging DeFi space.\n\nWhen hackers found a smart contract exploit in the DAO\u2019s wallet, they were able to siphon over $60 million in Ether, giving the hackers an enormous stake in the network and raising concern over whether the network was truly usable. At the time, the DAO held over 14% of all circulating ETH.\n\nAfter much negotiating between Vitalik Buterin, the Ethereum community, and the hackers themselves, it was eventually decided that a network hard fork could kickstart a new network from before the hack occurred, returning funds to investors and rewriting Ethereum\u2019s history.\n\nThis was an extremely controversial decision. It went against all the principles of blockchain technology, such as decentralization and immutable transactions. The Ethereum community was split in two; those who agreed with the hard fork proposal and those who did not.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain we know and love today is the new chain created from this historic hard fork. The old chain, whose community did not accept the display of power and control, is now called Ethereum Classic.\n\nEthereum POW (Proof-of-Work)\n\nIn late 2022, the Ethereum blockchain finally completed its long-awaited migration to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. This new chain was the result of years of work and reduces Ethereum\u2019s annual energy consumption by as much as 99%.\n\nEthereum miners who were against The Merge hard-forked the old chain and created Proof-of-Work Ethereum. The Ethereum PoW functions just like the normal Ethereum blockchain did pre-merge. However, the new coin, ETHPOW has little demand and the network doesn\u2019t see much user traffic.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nForks in crypto are essential processes that improve blockchain networks and help drive progress in the industry. However, they do pose security risks if poorly executed.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nHard fork events like The Merge, the Alonzo upgrade and the Shanghai update are crucial moments in blockchain evolution. Being informed about the processes involved can help you prepare for potential outcomes and help you better understand blockchain technology.\n\nFAQs"

Every single component is licensed with AGPL v3, including the zkProver, which is where all of the ZK magic happens \ud83e\ude84 More: https://t.co/H124ATcuWJ pic.twitter.com/adceTbOVMq \u2014 Polygon (Labs) (@0xPolygonLabs) March 27, 2023\n\nIn what Polygon Labs describes as a watershed moment for the Web3 industry, the launch of the zkEVM solution presents a resolution to the scaling problems such as lack of speed and throughput.\n\n\u201cThis solution has the capability to scale Ethereum infinitely, allowing the network to surpass the transaction throughput of major payment processors such as Visa,\u201d said Polygon in a release.\n\nThe launch on mainnet comes almost a year since the zkEVM was first introduced in a testnet back in July 2022.\n\nzkEVMs, which are ZK rollups designed for compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, are considered the holy grail of scaling technology.\n\n\u201cThey are the only solution that can achieve three major blockchain design goals: scalability, security that is inherited directly from Ethereum itself, and a seamless experience for developers building on Ethereum.\u201d\n\nZero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups) themselves are layer 2 protocols that bundle (or \u2018roll-up\u2019) hundreds of transfers off-chain and generate a cryptographic proof (or validity prooof) which gets posted on L1 drastically simplifying the process.\n\nPolygon Labs also announced that all aspects of Polygon zkEVM are now open-source under an AGPL v3 license. Open-source licenses allow developers to share their code and encourage collaboration and innovation within the developer community.\n\nAccording to Polygon, over 50 of the world\u2019s biggest Web2 and Web3 companies have committed to building on Polygon zkEVM, including Spanish telecom giant, Telef\u00f3nica, which will use the tech to improve the privacy and confidentiality of company data in enterprise use cases.\n\nJose Luis Nu\u00f1ez, Head of Blockchain at Telef\u00f3nica Tech said:\n\nTelef\u00f3nica Tech, leading company in digital transformation, and leaders in the development of blockchain solutions for enterprises, will be one of the first companies to deploy its framework, TrustOS, for notarisation and traceability solutions on top of the zkEVM Mainnet to improve privacy and confidentiality of companies and user\u2019s data in enterprise use cases.\n\nOther platforms adopting the zkEVM include:\n\nLens\n\nAavegotch i\n\nOvix\n\nQuickswap\n\nEtherScan\n\nPhantom\n\nMidnight Society\n\nLuganodes\n\nCeler\n\nGameSwift\n\nYeeha Games\n\nWhile several teams in the Web3 community are working on ZK rollups, Polygon indicates it has several advantages, not least being the first to launch a beta version on mainnet:\n\nIt is the only leading full-featured, open-source zkEVM with a complete, working, and audited prover\n\nIt\u2019s EVM-equivalent, meaning existing developer tools on Ethereum, existing wallets, infrastructure, etc., can be used seamlessly, unlike \u2018EVM-compatible\u2019 alternatives, which require existing developer tools and smart contracts to be modified to work creating incompatibility and increasing the risk of security vulnerabilities\n\nWithdrawal times back to Ethereum take 30 \u2013 60 minutes on Polygon zkEVM compared to a 24-hour withdrawal delay for zkSync Era, for example\n\nPolygon is the first to launch a mainnet beta making it the most advanced solution available. Alpha mainnets test basic functionality in a closed environment while beta mainnets are more stable and feature-rich\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s launch is an incredible milestone and the beginning of a new chapter for blockchain technology, fulfilling Ethereum\u2019s original promise of becoming a true \u2018world computer\u2019 and creating a fairer, more egalitarian internet for all\u201d said Mihailo Bjelic, Co-Founder of Polygon.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nFollow us on Twitter for the latest posts and updates\n\nJoin and interact with our Telegram community\n\n_________________________________________\n\n_________________________________________"

        "content": "Investors who understand the workings of market cycles within crypto will be more profitable than those who do not. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) prices have been trading flat after recent rallies, which means only one thing, altcoin season has begun. New projects have huge potential to rip, and one, Collateral Network (COLT), has already been forecast to gain 3,500% in its presale.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\n\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\n\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has thrived in the past months as the failings of fractional reserve banking have been highlighted to the world. With decreasing confidence in the dollar, more and more people have begun to look to Bitcoin (BTC). This application-specific hard money may unseat gold as the world\u2019s reserve currency in the coming decade.\n\n\n\nBitcoin (BTC) began in 2009 following the global financial crisis, and the same landscape which birthed Bitcoin (BTC) is helping it gain traction currently. Bitcoin (BTC), after surging upwards, has stalled as money floods into altcoins such as Collateral Network (COLT), and investors would be wise to rotate. Price predictions from analysts vary enormously, with some predicting that Bitcoin (BTC) will trade as high as $180,000 in 2025, whereas more conservative estimates put Bitcoin (BTC) trading between $77,000 and $92,000 in 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nWith the Shanghai upgrade for Ethereum (ETH) scheduled on the 12th of April, many investors have grown increasingly cautious about holding Ethereum (ETH). The Shanghai upgrade will enable Ethereum (ETH) staking withdrawals, and analysts predict that Ethereum (ETH) withdrawals will unleash heavy sell pressure.\n\n\n\nHowever, more bullish analysts and capital fund managers such as Chris Burnisky predict that Ethereum (ETH) withdrawals going live with lead to a greater influx of staked Ethereum (ETH). Regardless of the upgrade, traders should be cautious and, instead of holding Ethereum (ETH), should take advantage of altcoin season and projects like Collateral Network (COLT), which continue to rip to the upside.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\n\n\nCollateral Network (COLT)\n\n\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) has generated a buzz not seen in the crypto landscape for a long time. This challenger lender unlocks liquidity for real-world assets. The growth and integration of real-world assets into DeFi have been an expected growth driver amongst venture-capital firms for several months. Collateral Network (COLT) makes this possible through its use of 100% asset-backed NFTs.\n\n\n\nAsset owners can collateralize their assets with Collateral Network (COLT), anything from real estate and vintage cars to fine art and luxury watches. Collateral Network (COLT) mints an NFT 100% backed by the asset, which then becomes liquid. The holder can access the crowdsourced liquidity through fractionalizing the NFT.\n\n\n\nThe COLT token powers this entire ecosystem and grants discounts to borrowers and lenders, and also enables access to the auction where distressed assets will be sold off. On top of this, it can be staked for passive income, making it a DeFi token with excellent utility cases.\n\n\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) aggressively expands liquidity flows and lending potential within DeFi. For this reason, analysts have already forecast a 3,500% growth in its presale. Still, many expect it will rally much harder when it launches on centralized exchanges, and early holders could see a 100X on their initial investment.\n\n\n\n\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has reversed its downward trend and regained momentum, while Ethereum (ETH) has outperformed BTC, rising by more than 4%. This upward rally in the cryptocurrency market is attributed to several factors, including an increase in consumer confidence in March, recent advancements in the cryptocurrency industry, and Bitcoin\u2019s reputation as a safe-haven asset. Additionally, consumers are losing trust in traditional banks following recent bank collapses, which is considered a key factor in the Bitcoin price increase.\n\nEthereum Now Recognised As A Commodity Like Bitcoin\n\nThe crypto market cap has risen by 2.56% to $1.16 trillion, with Bitcoin and ETH leading the charge. The head of the US CFTC has reiterated that Ether is a commodity, not a security, which could boost its value. Ethereum\u2019s current price is $1,807.78, with a 24-hour trading volume of $7,635,430,660. It is likely to find an immediate resistance at $1,850, and a bullish breakout above this level could raise the price on to the next resistance level of $1,960.\n\nThe CFTC (Commodities Futures Trading Commission) has acknowledged Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC) as commodities, similar to Bitcoin (BTC). This means that both of these altcoins are now considered trading assets, like gold or oil. The CFTC made this statement as part of an investigation into Binance, a popular cryptocurrency exchange. This development is likely to have a positive impact on BTC and ETH prices, as it verifies their commodity status, potentially enhancing their legitimacy and adoption in traditional financial markets. It could also lead to increased regulatory oversight and institutional investor approval.\n\nBitcoin Hitting Bull Market\n\nRecent strong predictions regarding Bitcoin\u2019s future are also contributing to the rise in BTC prices. For instance, former Coinbase technical director Balaji Srinivasan has bet $2 million that bitcoin would reach $1 million in value within 90 days, implying that the value of Bitcoin will increase sharply in the near-term future. Marshall Beard, the Chief Strategy Officer of Gemini, an American-based cryptocurrency exchange, is more cautious and interested, estimating that Bitcoin will hit $100,000 this year. These forecasts are being influenced by several factors, including the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies by institutional investors, which may increase demand for Bitcoin and ultimately its price.\n\nAs of this writing, Bitcoin\u2019s price is $28,259.78, and its 24-hour trading volume is $16.5 billion. A breakout above this level could potentially push Bitcoin\u2019s price toward the next resistance level of $28,900. The bullish potential for Bitcoin is also supported by the violated downward trendline.\n\nDogetti Strives To Be The Top Dog Coin\n\nDogetti (DETI) is one of the new altcoins that has caught the attention of investors in the meme coin cryptocurrency space. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, meme coins are designed to be fun and engaging while providing investors with an opportunity to make a profit.\n\nThe Dogetti (DETI) team values community and aims to provide a healthy income for all investors. Dogetti NFTs are a fun way to interact with other DETI holders besides generating a steady stream of income. These NFTs are modelled after canine companions and can be bought, sold, and traded for $DETI. In the future, the platform plans to allow Dogetti NFTs to reproduce, which would result in more NFTs and more funds for investors.\n\nInvestors who want to get in on the ground floor of this exciting altcoin can participate in Dogetti\u2019s presale. This presale offers investors the opportunity to purchase $DETI tokens before the official launch, giving them a chance to make a profit if the coin\u2019s value increases. The presale also offers various bonuses and incentives to investors who participate, making it an attractive opportunity for those who believe in Dogetti\u2019s potential.\n\nFor more information about Dogetti (DETI):\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The upgrade includes smaller EIPs to reduce gas fees and more upgrades are expected later in 2023, including those for scalability and improving the Ethereum Virtual Machine\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade may impact the price of ETH, with concerns about flooding the market, but investors may not immediately withdraw due to potential losses\n\nEthereum's highly-anticipated Shanghai upgrade (EIP-4895), dubbed the Shapella upgrade, is set to occur on April 12, 2023. The hard fork is set to enable stakers and validators to withdraw assets from the Beacon Chain, which is a major development associated with the upgrade. The Shapella upgrade is a combination of two Ethereum Improvement Proposals: Shanghai and Capella. With staked Ether accounting for roughly 16 million coins, or a seventh of the total supply, this upgrade has significant implications. The current value of all staked Ether stands at over $30 billion.\n\nEthereum upgrade enables ETH withdrawal and reduces transaction fees\n\nThe Shapella upgrade marks the culmination of Ethereum's transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism for network maintenance. This hard fork will enable stakers to withdraw their ETH, among other benefits. Additionally, the upgrade will help lower transaction fees for users while enhancing Ethereum's capacity to process transactions.\n\nThe most crucial development associated with the Shanghai upgrade is Ethereum Improvement Proposal-4895, which allows validators to withdraw staked tokens. Validators have staked around 16 million ETH to secure the mechanism, which has become increasingly vital to the Ethereum blockchain since the Merge transitioned Ethereum's consensus mechanism from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in September 2022. According to the new rules post-Merge, validators that stake 32 ETH in the chain can participate in validating blocks, and each staked ETH increases the likelihood of a validator receiving block rewards.\n\nFollowing the Merge, validators had to lock up their ETH and any rewards earned until a later chain update. Despite the Merge taking place in 2022, validators have been staking ETH since December 2020, when the Beacon Chain was released, relying on proof-of-stake as a mechanism.\n\nSince the Beacon Chain's launch in December 2020, over 16 million ether has been staked in the network. Although not the entire balance can be unstaked immediately after the upgrade, roughly 1.1 million coins received as staking rewards can be withdrawn instantly. ETH is used to pay rewards to ether stakers.\n\nSince that time, Ethereum staking has been unidirectional. Users are able to stake their ETH to become validators and receive rewards in their wallet for performing their duties. However, they are currently unable to withdraw their staked ETH.\n\nAdditional EIPs to reduce gas fees and support Ethereum developers in Shanghai Upgrade\n\nAside from Ethereum Improvement Proposal-4895, the Shanghai fork also includes several other smaller EIPs that aim to reduce gas fees during periods of high activity to benefit Ethereum developers. These include EIP-3651, EIP-3855, EIP-3860, and EIP-6049.\n\nWhile the Shanghai upgrade may seem relatively small compared to the Merge, it has the potential for a significant impact on those with staked ETH on the chain. Further upgrades to the Ethereum protocol are expected later in 2023, including those aiming to improve the Ethereum Virtual Machine and another that seeks to split the Ethereum blockchain into several \"shards\" to enhance scalability. EIP-4844, which aims to split the Ethereum blockchain, had initially been considered for inclusion in the Shanghai upgrade, but was later pushed back.\n\nHow the Shanghai Upgrade will affect the price of ETH is a point of some debate\n\nThere is a debate on how the Shanghai Upgrade will impact the price of ETH. One concern is that the release of more than 16 million staked ETH, valued at over $30 billion currently, could lead to a flood of ETH into the crypto market, causing an immediate price drop due to an increased supply without a corresponding increase in demand. However, it is important to note that two years ago, the price of ETH was nearly three times its current price, and it is currently trading at almost half the price it was a year ago. In addition, many investors who staked their ETH could face losses if they withdraw immediately, which may discourage them from doing so."

        "content": "Shiba Inu is expected to become more decentralized than Ethereum.\n\nShiba Inu would also receive some critical infrastructure from Unification as UNODE plays a pivotal role in the ecosystem.\n\nShibarium is the project expected to transition Shiba Inu from a meme coin to a technologically focused ecosystem. It is set to operate as a blockchain layer that runs on top of Ethereum. Shibarium would take over a large portion of SHIB transactions to prevent the asset from solely relying on Ethereum. Recently, the beta testnet was launched. Shiba Inu could compete with Ethereum on the grounds of decentralization as development firm Unification, which is known as the main developer of the Shibarium project, considers this as an important objective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRingoshi Toitsu, a popular validator of the Unification (FUND) network tweeted a screenshot on April 5 featuring an interaction between the Unification Foundation and a community user. As captured in the screenshot, Unification was attempting to address the centralization of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) node operations issue. The Unification\u2019s upcoming tool UNODE for decentralized applications (dapps) in the Shibarium ecosystem would, therefore, be used by SHIB\u2019s layer 2.\n\nIt is worth noting that the native token of Unification is FUND. This is said to play a critical role as the only crypto that would be used by UNODE. According to Toitsu, UNODE would be very useful in the SHIB ecosystem.\n\nUnification is now tackling the next major point of centralization for Shibarium operations \u2013 EVM node operations. UNODE\u2019s launch in 2023 offers a more secure and decentralized infrastructure for developers & Dapps \u2013 using FUND as the gas!\n\nShiba Inu is currently bullish\n\nThe decentralization aspect of the project is very important considering how Ethereum has been a topic of discussion after its recent ETH.20 upgrade. According to Messari\u2019s study conducted in the fall of 2022, 70 percent of leading Ethereum applications run on four centralized node providers. In a blog post, Unification mentioned that Alchemy, Infura, Moralis, and Quicknode are the four centralized industry incumbents that provide the most ETH nodes. This is said to create a vulnerability in the technology stack of decentralized applications. Many also require card payments through DApps, hence, are permissioned and identifiable. In this case, tracking could be triggered.\n\nUnification\u2019s UNODE addresses this Achilles\u2019 Heel, by democratizing, decentralizing, and incentivizing EVM node operations. In accordance with our ethos, this will be pure Web3.\n\nOracle of Oracles (OoO), is also part of the Unification technology. OoO provides real-time asset prices by combining data from decentralized and centralized exchanges. This would be integrated into the SHIB ecosystem and includes ShibaSwap, Shiboshi NFTs, and Shibarium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means important infrastructure from Unification would be received by Shiba Inu.\n\nUnification is doing an excellent job with their technology for Shibarium, and no one else can match it. We\u2019re still in an early beta stage with a focus on delegating/staking. People know that BONE is gas, there will be REAL governance, and TRUE SHIB users will be able to earn rewards from using the blockchain.\n\nThe current sentiment of Shiba Inu is bullish and is trading at $0.000011 as of press time. In the last seven days, the asset has surged by 2 percent.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "content": "If anything, the last couple of months have taught us that the crypto industry is a rollercoaster that goes both up and down\u2014and sometimes really down. The market is seriously bearish across the board, and investors are sitting on their hands, waiting for the perfect time to buy the dip.\n\nWhen is the perfect time? Investors are itching to get into buy positions as many coins on their watchlist are etching close to their all-time low price. This means bigger returns for investors if they get in early and if these tokens rally as high as they\u2019ve done in the past. The top item on this list for the majority of investors is Ethereum.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll explore expert opinions on the Ethereum price prediction for 2023 and when exactly it is the best time to buy Ethereum in order to maximize profit. We\u2019ll also dive into the world of Pikamoon, the new GameFi project that experts believe will outperform Ethereum in 2023.\n\nShould I Buy Ethereum Now? \u2013 Ethereum Price Prediction For 2023\n\nWhile Ethereum may have gained 2.5% in the last 7 days and 3.1% in the last 30 days, it is noteworthy to mention that the overall Ethereum trend is still bearish. Ethereum has dropped over 60% from its all-time high price and may still go lower if certain criteria are not met quickly.\n\nReports from Coinmarketcap show that 66% of investors holding ETH tokens are in profit, 29% are in loss, and a small 5% are at breakeven. With the majority of investors in profit, it is easy to get excited at the thought of loading up on your buy positions on Ethereum.\n\nExperts believe this may not be the best course of action at the moment as ethereum\u2019s price is not quite settled yet. The price of the ETH token is presently trading above the $1920 support level. This is a good indicator that prices may reach as high as $2500 without major obstructions. Before taking any more buy positions, wait for a clear close of the daily or weekly candle above the $2121 price region and a retest of the $1890 support level.\n\nNonetheless, the $2500 resistance zone is a critical region for the price of Ethereum. If the price of Ethereum fails to break the level to the upside, the price of its token may fall to $1800 lows or even lower.\n\nThis is why analysts are telling ETH investors who are looking to diversify their portfolios to load up on as many $PIKA tokens in the ongoing Pikamoon presale as the GameFi token is poised to rally as much as 20,000% before the end of the year.\n\nWhat is Pikamoon?\n\nPikamoon is a leading P2E in the crypto industry developed by crypto experts and blockchain analysts who are fully doxxed and properly vetted by Coinsult, a leading blockchain audit company. This is one of the many reasons big investors, the crypto community, and big brands trust the Pikamoon project.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. When it comes to community support, Pikamoon is way ahead of its peers in the industry. The Pikamoon community is made up of crypto enthusiasts and expert investors who are fully involved and invested in the project\u2019s success. This is why experts believe Pikamoon is on its way to becoming an industry leader.\n\nTo top it all off, the Pikaverse, which is the metaverse of the Pikamoon game, is built on the best gaming engine in the industry, Unreal Engine 5. This is the same gaming engine that the legendary Fortnite game is built on. So when it comes to your expectations of the Pikamoon game, you can let your imaginations run wild.\n\nBoth gamers and crypto enthusiasts are patiently waiting for Pikamoon\u2019s launch so they can experience the Pikaverse firsthand.

        "title": "What happened to CryptoKitties? - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "CryptoKitties is the NFT collection that made history in 2017, but what happened to them now? How are their prices performing? Let\u2019s take a closer look at them below.\n\nCryptoKitties: what are the famous NFTs?\n\nAs one of the first and most popular NFT projects, CryptoKitties introduced blockchain technology to thousands of early users, players, traders, and collectors. In fact, the early days of the collection\u2019s release and sales are now something of a crypto legend.\n\nInterest in CryptoKitties has been so great since its inception that it has created an estimated six-fold increase in the number of Ethereum transactions. At one point, it accounted for 25% of the volume of transactions on the network.\n\nThe increase in volume caused a significant drop in transaction speed and an increase in gas rates across the entire Ethereum network. When this event occurred, at the peak of the 2017 bull-run cycle, it emphasized the scalability challenges of the Ethereum network and threatened to exclude other decentralized blockchain-based application startups.\n\nNot only that, the demand for CryptoKitties NFTs can be partly credited to the 256-bit DNA sequence assigned to each. The unique characteristics of each CryptoKitty are derived from a combination of the cattributes of its parents.\n\nThis genome mechanism allows nearly four billion unique CryptoKitties to be minted from the parent CryptoKitties. The popularity of the CryptoKitties NFTs has also attracted high-profile celebrity collaborations.\n\nMuse, a popular rock band, and Momo Wang, a famous Chinese fashion designer, have both participated in custom-themed cats for the CryptoKitties franchise. NBA superstar Stephen Curry was perhaps the most prominent celebrity to support the project. His initial involvement led to the creation of three CryptoKitty NFTs inspired by him.\n\nGrowth and decline of CryptoKitties\n\nCryptoKitties, which launched on 28 November 2017 after a five-day closed beta, quickly gained notoriety with the tantalizing slogan \u201cthe world\u2019s first Ethereum game.\u201d\n\nAccording to nonfungible.com, sales volume increased significantly from only 1,500 non-fungible cats on launch day to over 52,000 on 10 December 2017, with many CryptoKitties selling for prices in the hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\nIn addition, the game\u2019s use of the Ethereum blockchain may have contributed to the success of that technology. Along with the launch of CryptoKitties, Ethereum took off like a rocket, going from less than $300 per token in early November 2017 to just over $1,360 in January 2018.\n\nHowever, CryptoKitties faltered when Ethereum rose higher, which would later prove to be a troubling indication for the future of blockchain games.\n\nEarly December 2017 saw a spike in daily sales, which declined in January and averaged less than 3,000 in March. The fact that the value of NFTs themselves declined more slowly is evidence that the game still has a strong fan following, including Rabono, who bought Dragon long after the game\u2019s height.\n\nUntil 2018, their activity broke records for the value of NFTs. Nowadays, CryptoKitties are fortunate to reach 100 sales per day and the total value is often less than $10,000.\n\nThere are still significant transactions, such as the sale of Founder Cat No. 71 for 60 ether (about $170,000) on 30 April 2022, although they occur only occasionally. It is doubtful that CryptoKitties\u2019 decline into obscurity will stop.\n\nThe company that owns CryptoKitties, Dapper Labs, has moved on to other businesses such as NBA Top Shot, a website that allows basketball fans to buy NFT \u201cmoments,\u201d which are essentially video clips of NBA games.\n\nWhy have the popular NFTs collapsed?\n\nThe latest blog post (4 June 2021) on the game\u2019s website, commemorating the breeding of the 2 millionth CryptoKitty, contains a hint about the end of the game. To date, it is believed that there are two main reasons why CryptoKitties have collapsed.\n\nThe first, concerns the amount of available kittens. In the sense that the more players increased demand, the more they also increased the ability to increase supply by breeding more cats. This has rapidly reduced the rarity of each NFT.\n\nSecond, there is the huge volume of CryptoKitties, which has effectively destroyed the Ethereum blockchain, the world\u2019s second most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization (after Bitcoin).\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Ethereum values transactions using a fee called gas. Gas fees will increase whenever there is an increase in transactions (purchase, generation, and so on), and that is exactly what happened when CryptoKitties went to the moon.\n\nHence, high fees were a problem for more than just CryptoKitties. The entire blockchain was affected by the problem. As the game gained popularity, gas prices increased for anyone who needed to make a transaction on Ethereum for any reason."

        "title": "92% of Hackers Want ETH, Interest in Tezos Surged By 122%: Survey - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "\u2013 Whitehats see reentrancy as the most common vulnerability when reviewing code.\n\n\u2013 Whitehat hackers are not driven by money.\n\n\u2013 The more Web3 grows, the more career opportunities it offers.\n\nWhitehats prefer the Ethereum blockchain over the others, but interest in Ethereum dropped by 4 per cent, says Immunefi in its Hacker Ecosystem Survey 2023. The leading bug bounty and security services platform for Web3 surveyed whitehats to get an insight into their interests, challenges and opportunities in Web3. It saw a significant increase in interest in Tezos, a 122.2 per cent YoY growth.\n\nThe survey found \u201creentrancy\u201d as the most common vulnerability whitehats come across when reviewing code, followed by access control. Other vulnerabilities include input validation, oracle manipulation and logical errors. There are also rounding errors, gas optimization, unchecked returned values, uninitialized proxy, and flash loans.\n\nNot Doing It for the Money\n\nImmunefi, in its report, highlighted that money is not the driving factor in whitehat hackers\u2019 interest. Most respondents, 77 per cent, are mainly interested in solving technical challenges. About 69 per cent of respondents said financial gains, 62 per cent pointed out career opportunities, and 38 per cent said community.\n\nBut most whitehats (55.8 per cent) said hacking is their primary job. 44.2 per cent of the respondents phish in their free time and spend most of their day as software developers within the Web3 or security industries. But there has been a significant increase in whitehats hacking in their free time, compared to 39.8 per cent in the previous period \u2013 an 11 per cent YoY growth.\n\nThe survey found that more whitehats are joining the field and using their free time to work on transitioning to Web3 cybersecurity full-time. Most whitehats, on average, have worked in cybersecurity for almost four years and have been inclined towards Web3 security for almost two years.\n\nAll Eyes on Web3\n\nWeb3 is a high-paying industry. The more this space grows, the more career opportunities it offers. Whitehats believe their role in security is of high value for the industry and is well-rewarded as the technology leads to monetary funds being directly at risk. Web3 brings a host of possibilities. Whitehats see a steep learning curve, irrespective of previous cybersecurity or Web2 development background, as a key challenge.\n\nKeeping up with the industry is challenging given the complexity of solidity coding and protocols, possible attack vectors in Web3 and the continuously evolving requirements.\n\nMitchell Amador, CEO of Immunefi, believes there is a need always to stay ahead of bad actors. He said it\u2019s crucial to have the most talented security ecosystem in place and to operate under a reliable incentivized system. Amador added that working closely with whitehats, sharing insights and growing from their experience is of tremendous value and will continue to be beneficial, as they are on the frontline of protecting the industry."
