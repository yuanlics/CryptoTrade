        "title": "Ethereum co-founder says ether not a security, compares it to oil after regulator claims - CNBC",
        "content": "The co-founder of Ethereum, Joseph Lubin, hit out at regulators likening the ether cryptocurrency to a security, saying it was more akin to a commodity like oil.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC's Arjun Kharpal at Paris Blockchain Week Thursday, Lubin said he was \"very confident\" ether was not a security.\n\nIf it were treated as such, ether would need to be registered with regulators and subjected to much stricter requirements around pre-clearance and reporting.\n\n\"Anyone can say anything, it doesn't make it true,\" Lubin told CNBC.\n\nThe concerns that ether may be deemed a security stem from a lawsuit filed by the New York Attorney General Letitia James against Seychelles-based cryptocurrency exchange Kucoin, which alleged the firm failed to register as a securities and commodities broker-dealer and falsely represented itself as an exchange.\n\nIn the lawsuit, the NYAG's office listed ether among several tokens listed on Kucoin that the regulator viewed as securities, stating it was a \"speculative asset\" that relies on the efforts of third-party developers to provide holders with a profit.\n\n\"It's unfortunate that that sort of side swipe was made, but I don't think it's all that relevant,\" James said.\n\nEther is different from bitcoin in that it fuels an ecosystem of applications where users can make trades, loans, or buy nonfungible tokens."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s ERC-4337 Standard: Explained\n\nBy Jemima Conlon\n\nRead 6 min Medium\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS \u2014 Ethereum\u2019s ERC-4337 standard makes it easier to design interoperable smart wallets.\n\n\n\n\u2014 The ERC-4337 standard is commonly misconceived as achieving account abstraction, instead, it defines a decentralized relay network.\n\n\n\n\u2014 While smart wallets already existed, this ERC-4337 standard allows for new capabilities which will improve user experience.\n\nIf you follow the latest in Ethereum news, you may have heard about the ERC-4337 standard announcement. If you haven\u2019t, let us explain.\n\nERC-4337 sets a new standard for crypto accounts using smart contracts. They may seem familiar on the surface, but this contract standard allows for something very different from the smart wallets you might know thus far. These accounts have capabilities that may affect the wider Ethereum Ecosystem.\n\nBut hold on a minute. Smart wallets aren\u2019t a new thing, right?\n\n\n\nCorrect! In fact, popular smart wallets such as Argent and Gnosis Safe existed long before ERC-4337\u2019s inception. These wallets have similar capabilities, such as social recovery for those who lose access to their accounts. However ERC-4337 accounts can actually do much more.\n\nBut what is the ERC-4337 really about? Plus how do these wallets work compared to the smart wallets we are already familiar with?\n\nLet\u2019s explore, as Ledger Academy takes you through what ERC-4337 smart wallets really mean for the Ethereum network.\n\nWhat is ERC-4337?\n\nERC-4337 is a Smart Wallet standard on the Ethereum Blockchain. While the concept was proposed back in 2021, Yoav Weiss, an Ethereum Foundation developer, announced its availability for use at WalletCon in Colorado on March 1, 2023. The standard can be deployed on any Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible blockchain and allows for a new Ethereum wallet account capable of arbitrary verification logic.\n\nIf that sounds too technical for you, in short, this innovation allows you to perform complex actions straight from your wallet. Another key feature of these kinds of wallets is: they are not solely based on private key ownership, opting for a smart contract solution instead. That said, many smart wallets use mechanisms for validation that may still require a private key.\n\nPut simply, it\u2019s a way to make the user experience better, allowing users to customize how to pay transaction fees. While many have said ERC-4337 achieves account abstraction, that\u2019s not exactly the case.\n\nBut to understand that, let\u2019s first understand what account abstraction means.\n\nWhat is Account Abstraction?\n\nAccount abstraction is a way to let people use smart contracts as their primary accounts, essentially creating \u201csmart wallets\u201d.\n\nBut it\u2019s a bit more than that. Account abstraction aims to do a few important (and ambitious) things.\n\nFirstly, it allows you to execute functions directly from your wallet. It also gives your wallet the \u201cintelligence\u201d to determine how much to pay for a transaction fee and who will pay it. Account abstraction also allows for more advanced security features. For example, it allows you to set up transactions that require multiple signatures.\n\nFurthermore, recovery becomes a problem of the past: You can even recover your account without centralized help.\n\nPerhaps most excitingly, account abstraction allows for quantum-safe cryptography, meaning even a quantum computer wouldn\u2019t be able to hack the system.\n\nERC-4337 Vs Account Abstraction: What\u2019s the difference\n\nAlthough ERC-4337 accounts allow you to execute functions and have more flexibility over who pays transaction fees, it does not achieve true account abstraction.\n\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin stated, \u201cThe big really valuable, and necessary thing that ERC-4337 provides for account abstraction is a decentralized fee market for user operations going into smart contract wallets.\u201d\n\nTo explain, instead of allowing for true account abstraction, ERC-4337 is like a transaction relayer: It allows you to organize transactions in an off-chain order book, and then relay the final transaction to the blockchain.\n\nTrue account abstraction will offer much more than that: It aims to change the way Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) interact with the Ethereum blockchain itself.\n\nHowever, these functionalities will require an upgrade to Ethereum\u2019s whole consensus \u2013 which is no easy feat. While the ERC-4337 standard is an important step in the right direction, Ethereum account abstraction is still a way away.\n\nWhat is ERC-4337 for?\n\nWell, now you know that ERC-4337 is one step on the path to account abstraction. But what does it actually let us do? Some of the most exciting things about this standard include;\n\nPerforming Multiple Actions in One Transaction\n\nFirstly the standard allows you to bundle multiple transactions together. This means you can set approval for, initiate and execute a trade all in one go, and it\u2019s only possible due to \u201cbundling\u201d. This is great for traders and gamers specifically, who currently must sign multiple transactions just to carry out one action.\n\nPerforming One Transaction with Multiple People\n\nThere are a couple of instances you might want to share a transaction with your friends or family and ERC-4337 makes that possible.\n\nFirstly, it allows you to set up a transaction that requires multiple signatures. So for example, you could set up a transaction that needs the signature of both you and your partner before validation.\n\nThe advancement also lets you share transactions in other ways. For example, while using ERC-4337 wallets you don\u2019t always have to pay a gas fee., That\u2019s because \u201csponsored transactions\u201d are now possible, allowing another entity, such as a dApp or wallet provider, to pick up the transaction fee for you. To make it even easier, these wallets will also let you pay transactions with arbitrary tokens, such as ERC-20 tokens.\n\nA more Seamless User Experience\n\nThe ERC-4337 standard allows for other functionalities too. For example, blockchain subscriptions will be possible, as the ERC-4337 standard can process automated and recurring payments. You can now set up a recurring payment to an online magazine or even a monthly coffee subscription using these types of accounts.\n\nAdditionally, you can set pre-approval and auto-approve transactions. This allows a more seamless experience for users, which is especially important for players of blockchain games.\n\nImproved Security Measures\n\nFinally, the ERC-4337 standard gives users more flexibility with their security. For example, it allows you to define rules regarding spending or approval. For example, you may want to limit the amount you can spend in a single transaction, within a single day, or even over a whole month. You can also use this standard to set up more complex methods to access your funds, requiring 2FA and a hardware wallet signature for transactions over a certain amount.\n\nLike many smart wallets today ERC-4337 also has the power to let you recover your wallet.\n\nIf you lose access to your account, smart wallets use a feature called Social recovery. This is not a new concept. Argent is a good example of a smart wallet that allows specific people, called guardians, to help you regain access to your assets.\n\nThe ERC-4337 standard aims to allow you to do something similar in a more decentralized way. The idea is that each thing you interact with on the blockchain can now help provide a piece of proof of who you are, instead of having to rely on a centralized validator.\n\nSo, How Does ERC-4337 Work?\n\nTo explain the ERC-4337 smart wallet standard introduces a new object (a basic unit of data that contains information and allows certain functions) to the Ethereum network.\n\nThe new object introduced by the ERC-4337 standard is called \u201cUserOperation\u201d. When a user initiates a UserOperation, it\u2019s sent to the mempool \u2013 a place where transactions go to be validated. This is an entirely separate mempool from the one used for processing transactions on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nFirstly, you must understand that all transactions on the Ethereum network must be triggered and paid for by an Externally owned Account (EOA). Using a separate mempool lets users bypass these rules without affecting Ethereum\u2019s underlying system.\n\nIt has different requirements to the mainnet, meaning you have more flexibility with the details of your transaction.\n\nFirstly, you can perform multiple transactions at once. But more importantly, anyone with an EOA, such as a wallet provider, can pay the fees on behalf of the user.\n\nTo explain, once the userOperations are bundled into an Ethereum mainnet transaction, they still require payment via an EOA. However, ERC-4337 defines a way where it doesn\u2019t actually need to be the user themselves. This makes the process more efficient and minimizes user fees.\n\nHow To Use Smart Wallets Securely\n\nWhile a smart wallet may have more functionality than a traditional wallet, it doesn\u2019t have to operate alone. It contains valuable assets, thus securing your smart wallet is very important.\n\nTo do so, it\u2019s recommended that you set up your smart wallet with a hardware wallet. In short, your hardware wallet is designed to keep your private key safe from the internet and its risks. Working in tandem with your smart wallet, your hardware wallet can act as an unhackable verification method, allowing you to sign transactions with your smart wallet with confidence.\n\nWhile web2 hardware like smartphones and laptops are subject to hacks, web3 hardware wallets are not. For this reason, using a hardware wallet with your smart wallet is still the most secure option for securing your digital assets. Ledger hardware wallets secure your keys with a secure Element chip, known to be one of the safest computer chips in existence. This means you can sign transactions with absolute confidence. For now, a Ledger Device is still the most secure option for protecting your keys- and therefore your assets."

        "title": "ETH 2.0: Understanding the Beacon Chain, Proof-of-Stake, and Sharding - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Ethereum, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, is undergoing a significant upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0. This upgrade is intended to address some of the current Ethereum network's scalability and security issues.\n\nIn this article, we will look at Ethereum 2.0's key components, such as the Beacon Chain, Proof-of-Stake, and Sharding.\n\nThe Beacon Chain\n\nThe Beacon Chain is Ethereum 2.0's first phase, and it is already operational. It is a new blockchain that will be used to coordinate the activities of other shards that will be added in subsequent phases. The Beacon Chain employs a new consensus algorithm known as Proof-of-Stake (PoS), which replaces the current Ethereum network's Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm.\n\nProof-of-Stake\n\nThe Beacon Chain uses Stake as a consensus algorithm to validate transactions and create new blocks. In contrast to PoW, which requires miners to solve complex mathematical problems in order to validate transactions, PoS requires validators to stake a certain amount of Ethereum in order to participate in the validation process.\n\nValidators are chosen based on the amount of Ethereum staked, and their participation is rewarded with newly created Ethereum.\n\nOne advantage of PoS is that it consumes less energy than PoW. PoW necessitates the use of significant amounts of energy by miners to solve complex mathematical problems, whereas PoS only necessitates validators to stake Ethereum. As a result, PoS is a more environmentally friendly option than PoW.\n\nSharding\n\nSharding is a key component of Ethereum 2.0, and it is intended to improve the Ethereum network's scalability. Currently, every transaction must be processed by all nodes in the Ethereum network, which can cause congestion and slow transaction times.\n\nSharding addresses this issue by dividing the network into smaller, more manageable shards.\n\nEach shard can process its own transactions, reducing network load and increasing transaction throughput. This increases the network's scalability and allows it to handle a greater number of transactions.\n\nThe Advantages of Ethereum 2.0\n\nEthereum 2.0 has a number of advantages over the current Ethereum network. One of the primary advantages is increased scalability. Ethereum 2.0 can process more transactions per second than the current Ethereum network thanks to sharding.\n\nThis is critical for Ethereum's growth and adoption because it will allow it to handle more users and applications.\n\nIncreased security is another advantage of Ethereum 2.0. The use of PoS in the Beacon Chain increases network security by lowering the likelihood of 51% attacks. A 51% attack occurs in a PoW network when a single miner or group of miners controls more than 50% of the network's mining power.\n\nThis allows them to manipulate transactions and possibly double-spend coins. Validators in PoS are chosen based on the amount of Ethereum staked, making it more difficult for a single entity to gain control of the network.\n\nFinally, Ethereum 2.0 is less harmful to the environment than the current Ethereum network. PoS reduces the amount of energy required to validate transactions, making it a more sustainable alternative to PoW.\n\nEthereum 2.0 Challenges\n\nWhile Ethereum 2.0 has several advantages, it also has some implementation challenges. The transition from the current Ethereum network to Ethereum 2.0 is one of the most difficult challenges. This will necessitate extensive coordination and testing to ensure that the transition goes smoothly and that the network remains secure.\n\nAnother issue is the possibility of centralization. Validators in PoS are chosen based on the amount of Ethereum they possess.\n\nThis means that those with more Ethereum have a better chance of being chosen as validators, which may lead to network centralization. To address this issue, Ethereum 2.0 is introducing the Slashing Condition, which penalizes validators who act maliciously or go offline for extended periods of time.\n\nFinally, interoperability is a concern. Because Ethereum 2.0 is a distinct blockchain from the current Ethereum network, applications and smart contracts built on the current network will be incompatible with Ethereum 2.0. Adoption may be hampered as a result of the need for developers and users to rebuild their applications and contracts to work with the new network.\n\nWhat Is the Future of Ethereum 2.0?\n\nThe first phase of Ethereum 2.0, the Beacon Chain, is already operational, and the development team is currently working on implementing the subsequent phases, which will include the addition of shards and the migration of the current Ethereum network to Ethereum 2.0.\n\nThe development team is working in stages to ensure that each phase is thoroughly tested before proceeding to the next.\n\nEthereum 2.0 has the potential to revolutionize the blockchain industry once it is fully implemented. With improved scalability, security, and energy consumption, it could very well become the go-to platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nWill ETH 2.0 Topple Bitcoin?\n\nAs two of the most prominent cryptocurrencies in the market, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have been long-time competitors in the cryptocurrency space. However, with the recent launch of Ethereum 2.0, many have begun to wonder how the two compare.\n\nBitcoin, the world's first cryptocurrency, was created in 2009 and has been the market leader ever since. It was designed to be a decentralized currency, allowing users to send and receive payments without the need for intermediaries like banks or financial institutions. Bitcoin's primary use case has been as a store of value and a medium of exchange.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, was created in 2015 as a decentralized platform for building decentralized applications (dApps). It introduced the concept of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. This made it possible to build decentralized applications that could execute complex logic and automate processes without the need for intermediaries.\n\nWith the launch of Ethereum 2.0, the Ethereum network is undergoing a major upgrade. This upgrade aims to solve some of the scalability and security issues that have plagued the Ethereum network, making it more efficient and secure. Ethereum 2.0 introduces a new consensus algorithm called Proof of Stake (PoS), which replaces the existing Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm.\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, still uses the PoW consensus algorithm. This means that Bitcoin mining requires a massive amount of computing power, making it extremely energy-intensive. Bitcoin's transaction throughput is also limited by the block size and block time, which can lead to slow and expensive transactions during times of high demand.\n\nWith Ethereum 2.0, the network is expected to become much more scalable, with the ability to process thousands of transactions per second. This will make it more competitive with traditional payment systems and position it as a serious contender in the global financial system.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin still holds its position as the dominant cryptocurrency and the store of value of choice for many investors. Its fixed supply of 21 million BTC has led to its reputation as a \"digital gold,\" and its popularity has only increased in recent years with the rise of institutional adoption.\n\nOne of the biggest differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin is ETH\u2019s ability to facilitate smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. This allows for trustless transactions and eliminates the need for intermediaries. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is primarily used as a store of value and a means of exchange.\n\nIn terms of their respective communities, Bitcoin has a more established and passionate community of supporters, while Ethereum has a more diverse ecosystem of developers, users, and applications.\n\nIn conclusion, while both Bitcoin and Ethereum have their strengths and weaknesses, Ethereum 2.0's launch marks a significant step forward in the evolution of the cryptocurrency space. As the two continue to compete, it will be interesting to see how they develop and how they continue to shape the future of finance.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum 2.0 is a significant upgrade to the current Ethereum network that is intended to address scalability and security concerns. The Beacon Chain, Proof-of-Stake, and Sharding are key components of Ethereum 2.0, and each provides distinct advantages to the network.\n\nWhile Ethereum 2.0 has significant advantages over the current network, there are also implementation challenges, such as the transition from the current network and the possibility of centralization.\n\nDespite these obstacles, Ethereum 2.0 has the potential to revolutionize the blockchain industry and become the decentralized application and smart contract platform of choice."

        "title": "Better Buy: Ethereum or Polygon? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Amid all the excitement surrounding The Merge last year, the fortunes of Ethereum (ETH 1.51%) and Polygon (MATIC 1.81%) appeared to be inextricably linked. After all, Polygon was the most popular Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, so any future growth in the Ethereum ecosystem implied future growth in the Polygon ecosystem. But fast forward to 2023, and it looks like the paths of these two cryptocurrencies are starting to diverge.\n\nWhile both cryptos are up about 50% for the year, it's their performance over the past 30 days that's the most troubling. During that time, Ethereum was up about 10%, while Polygon was down 17%. Is this a short-term mispricing in the marketplace or a sign for investors that Polygon's future growth prospects are coming under pressure?\n\nWhat happened to Polygon's growth?\n\nOn the surface, the growth story for Polygon remains in place. It's arguably still the most popular Layer 2 in the Ethereum ecosystem and has some of the best technology out there for making Ethereum run faster, better, and more efficiently.\n\nMoreover, there are still plenty of top brands and companies utilizing Polygon for new Web3 initiatives. As a result, Polygon has a market capitalization of $9.8 billion, making it one of the top 10 cryptos in the world.\n\nHowever, look beneath the surface, and the picture gets a bit murkier because there's been a steep falloff in growth at Polygon since December.\n\nFor example, consider the number of new Polygon addresses being created on a daily basis. These are down 32% from mid-February levels, a warning sign that developers and users could be looking elsewhere when deciding to build on top of Ethereum. Even more troubling, Polygon recently said it was cutting of 20% of its team.\n\nThe crowded Layer 2 field\n\nWhat's going on here? The problems at Polygon could be linked to the emergence of new competition.\n\nPolygon isn't the only Layer 2 option that developers have, and it's starting to become very evident now. For example, Optimism (OP) seemingly exploded out of nowhere this year to become a super-popular Layer 2 scaling solution. For the year, it's up more than 170%.\n\nOptimism recently made headlines as the result of a high-profile partnership with crypto exchange operator Coinbase Global. If you look at key blockchain metrics such as total value locked (TVL), Optimism appears to be narrowing the gap with Polygon.\n\nMoreover, there are other Layer 2 names out there that are generating buzz. Another top Layer 2 solution is Immutable X (IMX -2.93%), which is up more than 200% this year. It now has a market cap of over $1 billion, making it the No. 53 crypto in the world.\n\nBut the name that everyone is talking about now is Arbitrum, which is about to get its own crypto token soon. According to some traders, the price of Polygon could sink as much as 15% as soon as the new Arbitrum token starts trading.\n\nLayer 1 or Layer 2?\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum has shown little-to-no impact from the recent spate of bank failures and bank runs and is now being mentioned as a potential safe haven for investors thinking about moving their money into crypto. According to Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, Ethereum has not \"skipped a beat\" during the recent market upheaval, and that should be very reassuring to investors.\n\nUltimately, the choice of whether to invest in Ethereum or Polygon comes down to a single question: Do you feel more comfortable investing in a Layer 1 or a Layer 2 blockchain? While there's a lot of exciting activity happening at the Layer 2 level, the field is getting so crowded now that investing in a Layer 1 looks a lot more appealing.\n\nFinally, keep in mind track records. Ethereum has a proven track record dating back to 2015 and managed to pull off The Merge in 2022 amid one of the worst crypto meltdowns ever. If you're looking for a crypto to ride out the gathering financial storm, the clear choice now is Ethereum."

If the fractal plays out, the pair could rally toward the same resistance level by June 2023.\n\nIn other words, Ether has a decent chance of rebounding by more than 15% to around 0.075 BTC. Conversely, a break below the ascending trendline support will invalidate the bullish fractal.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "What is the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade?: ETH Analysis - YouHodler.com",
        "content": "The Ethereum cryptocurrency network has a massive update due in April 2023 called the Shanghai upgrade. The Shanghai upgrade is a hard fork. It will radically change the blockchain\u2019s protocol - hopefully for the better.\n\nEthereum is no stranger to huge updates like this, seen by their switch to proof-of-stake. All signs point to The Shanghai upgrade significantly benefiting the blockchain and it comes as a result of ETH\u2019s liquid staking consensus mechanism.\n\nBut how will this affect your crypto wallet exactly?\n\nWhat is the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghai upgrade is a series of upgrades. The Ethereum developers will implement them at once. To understand this upgrade's significance, it's important to know Etherem's history. This upgrade is the result of several past changes to Ethereum\u2019s network.\n\nThe proof-of-works(PoW) period\n\nEthereum started in 2015 as a proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrency, just like Bitcoin. This method involves spending time and energy to solve complex math formulas. Using sophisticated technology, miners who solve the formulas receive crypto rewards. This type of consensus mechanism has some downsides, though.\n\nPoW is energy-intensive and made scaling hard for the blockchain.\n\nSuggested reading: Proof-of-Work vs. Proof-of-Stake: The Ultimate Guide\n\nEthereum migrates to Proof-of-stake (PoS)\n\nAfter many test runs, ETH switched to the proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism in 2020. This hard fork change is now called \"the Ethereum Merge.\" This made the blockchain more secure, and eco-friendly and improved scalability.\n\nPrimary benefits of \"The Merge\"\n\nThe Merge allowed Ethereum validators to stake their crypto in the blockchain for passive income. At the time, they could not withdraw their ETH from the blockchain. The funds were locked to support the network. This method is similar to a high-yield savings account in a traditional bank. Holders with stakes in ETH could also vote on future blockchain changes.\n\nPrimary challenges of Ethereum's PoS mechanism\n\nThe PoS system still had one big negative, though - cost. To join the Beacon Chain, which coordinates staking, users had to give a minimum of 32 ETH. At the time the PoS system was rolled in, one ETH cost about $4,000. At the time of writing, it is around $1,550. This high entry point made it difficult for many to join.\n\nThe solution: The Shanghai Upgrade\n\nCrypto teams improved this issue somewhat using liquid staking. With this technique, users can stake a smaller amount of ETH in return for tokens that represent their crypto. They can then use their tokens for other transactions. The Shanghai upgrade seeks to address this issue even further and make it more accessible to join ETH.\n\nIn 2022, Ethereum tested a draft version of the Shanghai upgrade, the Shangdong test network. It tried out the practicality of the upgrade proposals. The Shanghai upgrade has five proposals, with one more\n\nproposal (EIP-4844) postponed to 2024. EIP stands for Ethereum Improvement Proposal.\n\nWhat improvements will Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade bring?\n\nThe five proposed changes in the current Shanghai upgrade are:\n\nEIP-3651: Warm COINBASE\n\nCoinbase payments are becoming more popular. To improve transaction execution, Coinbase addresses will be warm at their start. This will increase transaction speed but maintain security.\n\nEIP-3855: PUSH0 instruction\n\nThis introduces the PUSH0 instruction to contracts. It keeps the stack at a constant 0 value. This change will reduce contract code size and reduce the need for the DIP instruction (which solves duplicating zeroes). It also reduces the risk of contracts misusing instructions for optimization.\n\nEIP-3860: Limit and meter initcode\n\nThis EIP extends EIP-170 with a maximum size limit for the initialization code. This ensures the code is fairly charged to minimize future risk. It also provides an extendable cost system for the future.\n\nEIP-4895: Beacon Chain push withdrawals\n\nThis improvement introduces a system-level operation to support validator withdrawals. It provides a separate way for withdrawals to enter the EVM (Ethereum virtual machine). The EVM executes smart contracts on the blockchain network.\n\nThis is the most important change. It gives validators the option to withdraw their staking rewards. Since the Ethereum Merge, validators have staked over $17 million in Ether. This works out to over 22 billion USD.\n\nWhile some validators are sure to withdraw stakes, there\u2019ll be a cap of 43,200 ETH per day. The cap, and ETH\u2019s other improvements, will prevent a mass exit of validators. More people will likely become validators.\n\nEIP-6049: Deprecate SELFDESTRUCT\n\nThis warns against the use of the self-destruct instruction, which terminates a smart contract. However, ETH users are still discussing how best to use self-destruct. A change to this EIP is likely to come in the future.\n\nETH Analysis: Will the upgrade affect the price?\n\nAnalysts have theories about whether the Shanghai upgrade will affect Ethereum's price. Some users fear the upgrade will cause a crash, but there are some arguments against that.\n\n\u200d Withdrawal process : Validators queue up to withdraw stakes and go through a two-tier system. At maximum, only 10% of the staked ETH can leave the pool per month.\n\n\u200d \u200d\n\n: Validators queue up to withdraw stakes and go through a two-tier system. At maximum, only 10% of the staked ETH can leave the pool per month. \u200d Staking popularity will increase: Staking popularity is likely to rise after the upgrade. JPMorgan says Ethereum\u2019s staking ratio will increase post-upgrade. The number of validators could rise from half a million to 2.2 million. This will result in a massive net positive. The increased investment will appreciate the value of ETH.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade will improve the security and effectiveness of Ethereum\u2019s PoS system. It\u2019s not likely to cause any major negatives, and will probably improve prices in the long term. You can expect to see the upgrade launch in early April 2023 - but delays are expected.\n\nFor traders, expect volatility in both directions. Ethereum - and the blockchain industry on the whole - is still young and experiencing growing pains. Bullish and bearish volatility is normal. However, this volatility presents plenty of good opportunities for those prepared.\n\nDisclaimer: \u201cThe content should not be construed as investment advice and does not constitute any offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product.

        "title": "Choosing Polygon over Ethereum to Build Efficient dApps - Appinventiv",
        "content": "Polygon aims to give people numerous choices when they create dApp on Polygon. Some developers keep security over speed while others compromise on security for lowered fees and speed \u2013 the technology is building multiple Ethereum-centric scaling solutions to address all these different features.\n\nEthereum has remained a pillar in the cryptocurrency space. Right from DeFi to smart contracts and even NFTs, Ethereum has remained one of the key innovations of Web3. However, inspite of the glaring success, the technology has struggled with massive network congestion, high network fees, and lowering transaction throughput \u2013 factors that have created a scope for newer crypto projects coming in to scale it. Polygon is one such project.\n\nOriginated in 2017, India-based software company Polygon Technology scales Ethereum without sacrificing on its decentralization benefits. With the number of dApps on Polygon having reached 53,000, businesses are using the technology\u2019s low fees and fast speed to build Ethereum-powered dApps.\n\nIn this article, we are going to look into the different facets of Polygon and what makes the technology better than using Ethereum for dApps development.\n\nHow does the Polygon dApp builder work?\n\nPolygon is a Layer 2 scaling solution that enables developers to build dApps on Ethereum without getting stuck with Ethereum\u2019s limitations.\n\nHow it does that is by developing a layer 2 solution using off-chain on-chain concepts and different governance models like Proof of Stake, which helps the network lower its energy footprint by 99.95% \u2013 one which Etherum has also reached after The Merge. In addition to using a PoS architecture where the network participants stake MATIC for validating the transactions, Polygon enables developers to use its open source SDK to launch their Polygon dApp at the back of multiple scaling techniques:\n\nZK-Rollups: The ethereum-based technology acquired a zero-knowledge (ZK) protocol developer, Mir, for USD 400 million. What this protocol does is it enables transaction authenticators to validate the encrypted data without actually accessing the information enabling them to generate the verification proof in under 170 milliseconds.\n\nOptimistic Rollups: It consists of bundling several off-chain transactions into massive batches before submitting them in Ethereum. This way, the fixed costs get spread across multiple transactions that reduce the end-user fees. In essence, this scaling technique assumes off-chain transactions validity without pushing out validity proofs for the on-chain transaction batches by following a fraud-proving methodology to identify transactions having discrepancies.\n\nPlasma Chains: This scaling technique builds a child-parent relationship in Ethereum\u2019s main chain. For example, the plasma chains can deploy their own dApps on Polygon which comes in handy when the other sidechains get hacked or are down. Additionally, the plasma chains tend to deliver off-chain transactions at higher efficiency levels.\n\nAt the back of these scaling methods, while the answer to how much time does it take to build dApp on Polygon is same as that on Ethereum or other blockchain technology, the transaction speed and cost difference is unmatched.\n\nFeatures of Polygon for dApp development\n\nThe technology merges the capabilities of sovereign blockchains and Ethereum into an attractive feature set that helps developers build a decentralized app on Polygon that is highly efficient, scalable, and speedy.\n\nEthereum compatibility\n\nWhen you build dApp on Polygon you work on a platform with complete Ethereum compatibility to tech stack, languages, standards, and tools.\n\nHigh scalability\n\nThe technology is built on dedicated blockchains, a scalable consensus algorithm, and a customized Wasm execution environment.\n\nCompetitive network Greater security\n\nPolygon dApp development is built on a modular \u201csecurity as a service\u201d facility offered either by Ethereum or a pool or validators.\n\nInteroperability\n\nThe technology comes with a native support for the arbitrary messaging passing bridges for external systems and can easily connect with Ethereum main chain using the bridging SDKs polygon offers.\n\nGood user experience\n\nWhen you build dApp on Polygon it is very similar to one on Web2 purely at the back of a facility like instantaneous transaction finality.\n\nModularity\n\nPolygon comes with high extensibility, customization, upgradability, community collaboration, and a short time-to-market.\n\nThese features of Polygon for dApp development are designed to bring the technology at par with the adoption of Ethereum minus all the limitations of the latter. This makes it profitable for developers and enterprises alike to build a decentralized app on Polygon.\n\nAmidst these feature sets and the obvious benefits of Polygon for dApp development, is it time to let go of Ethereum? And on a technological level, what difference does Ethereum hold from Polygon dApp development?\n\nCreating dApps on Polygon vs Ethereum\n\nWhile The Merge moved Ethereum from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, bringing down its 112 TWh of energy consumption down to 0.01 TWh, the technology is where Polygon already is.\n\nThe Merge however, didn\u2019t change the high variable transaction cost that Ethereum comes with \u2013 a factor that Polygon addresses on a massive extent. In addition to this, the transaction processing speed has also remained unchanged, which in case of Polygon dApps development is only 65,000 transactions per second at the back of the Layer 2 scalability solution.\n\nLet us look into the differences to understand why it makes sense to build dApps on Polygon.\n\nFactors Ethereum Polygon Foundation 2013 2017 Scalability 10 TPS 7000 Market Cap 139.56 Billion 7.698 Billion Average transaction fees 0.4876 US$0.01 Programming language Solidity Solidity, Golang, Vyper Transaction Deterministic Finality Instant 5 minutes Total dApps 2970 53,000\n\nWhile Polygon\u2019s popularity is on a fast rise, there are some issues that are still prevalent in the technology. For understanding Polygon to its entirety, it is critical to know the limitations it comes attached with. Let us give a brief look at them:\n\nEthereum Dependency: Ethereum lies at the center of Polygon\u2019s ecosystem as its settlement layer. This has resulted in Polygon being completely dependent on Ethereum for its operations.\n\nEthereum lies at the center of Polygon\u2019s ecosystem as its settlement layer. This has resulted in Polygon being completely dependent on Ethereum for its operations. Under Development: Presently, Polygon comes with Matic POS Chains and Matic Plasma as scaling solutions.

Matic Plasma Chains: Polygon plasma chains can only be used for a limited set of use cases. Comparatively, POS Chains are a lot more famous since they offer greater user experiences and flexibility when compared to Matic Plasma.\n\nPolygon plasma chains can only be used for a limited set of use cases. Comparatively, POS Chains are a lot more famous since they offer greater user experiences and flexibility when compared to Matic Plasma. Competition: There are a number of scaling solutions such as Solana, Cosmos, Polkadot, etc. which are gaining steady momentum. They are making use of Ethereum and other blockchains to offer better user experience. Amidst this, we might see other solutions coming up and taking Polygon\u2019s market share.\n\nWith everything we have covered up until this point, one thing is clear \u2013 even though the technology has some limitations which need to be addressed, the benefits of Polygon for dApp development are unignorable. However, for an entrepreneur what is necessary is to know the use cases on which they can create dApp on Polygon.\n\nThe use cases to build dApp on Polygon\n\nThe biggest reason why dApp development service providers like Appinventiv choose Polygon is the fact that the end product is the same as what results from Ethereum app development but the customer experience is much greater. So while the businesses get the same Ethereum-powered app, their users get an innovative user experience, higher lowered transaction speed, and minimal transaction fees.\n\nPayments: Polygon platform is engineered to create dApps that speed up the payment process, powering almost real-time payment settlement via specialized API and SDK integration. This enables apps, users, and merchants to instantly perform transactions through multiple cryptocurrencies, usually through the ETH or ERC-20 tokens. This system is being rolled out in three distinct phases: 1. ERC-20 token payments 2. Token transfer in cross-chain 3. Fiat-based payment models.\n\nLending Platform: The next use case to consider when you build dApp on Polygon is creating a module that would enable lenders to analyze users credit ratings and building a smart contract that would automate the loan disbursement journey.\n\nGames: The Layer 2 sidechain scaling solution of Polygon makes blockchain-based gaming platform development efficient and fast. With Ethereum and Polygon working together, the platform will be able to address the lag issues that non-Polygon blockchain games face.\n\nOther Use Cases: There are a range of other use cases to consider when you build a decentralized app on Polygon such as enabling fast settlement times required for decentralized exchanges to provide faster and cheaper trading.\n\n[Also Read: How to monetize with your dApp?]\n\nAmidst these use cases, the Polygon ecosystem is fast expanding. Here\u2019s a look into some of the top applications that are a part of the network\n\nAdditionally, most of the dApps require a method to sign transactions without submitting in the users\u2019 private keys details. On the back of its scalability enhancements, the technology helps in enabling an open identity framework for the dApp, thus solving the privacy issue.\n\nThese use cases are only a surface-level explanation of why businesses should develop dApp on Polygon. There are a range of other applications that can be built on Polygon.\n\nUltimately, even though Polygon dApps are built upon Ethereum, there are some very critical differences between them, specifically in transaction speed and cost. Such costly gas fees and slow transactions can lead to poor user experience that would leave a negative impact on the platform\u2019s adoption. On this note, it makes better business sense to select Polygon, thanks to its ability to back faster transactions and lowered gas fees.\n\nAt Appinventiv, it is our constant endeavor to think about our clients\u2019 customers first and this is the reason why we make dApp on Polygon. Using the technology we have built a range of decentralized apps right from a crypto wallet app to a DeFi exchange all promising a positive customer experience.\n\nLooking to explore the technology for your next dApp project?

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has been consolidating over the past week as the price is struggling to break above a key resistance area. Did ETH mark a local top?\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nThe Daily Chart:\n\nOn the daily time frame, ETH\u2019s price has broken above the symmetrical triangle pattern lately and above the 50-day moving average line (around the $1600 mark). However, ETH is trading inside a very tight range above the broken triangle and has yet to break with confidence above the $1800 level.\n\nIf the market fails, a pullback toward the 50-day and even the 200-day moving average located around the $1600 and $1400 levels, respectively, could be expected. On the other hand, a valid break above the $1800 level could lead to another short-term rally \u2013 first to target the $2K level for the first time in 2023, and then a further target amind the $2300 area.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, the consolidation becomes more evident, as the price has been bouncing around the $1800 resistance level. The RSI indicator has been indicating a clear bearish divergence signal for a while, which could point to a pullback in the coming days.\n\nIn this case, the $1650 level could be retested as support, followed by the $1500 level. However, it is still too soon to predict whether the bullish trend will continue or reverse, as the market has yet to decide amid the $1800 resistance.\n\nOn-Chain Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nEthereum Open Interest\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has steadily climbed over the last few months, following a reversal around the $1000 support mark. However, the futures market behaves quite differently from the previous few times when the market experienced short-term rallies during the recent bear market.\n\nThe open interest metric (OI) measures the daily number of open futures contracts and is a handy indicator for evaluating the futures market sentiment. Generally, rising open interests are followed by high volatility and bearish reversals. However, the open interest has remained relatively low during the recent rally.\n\nAs a result, the uptrend could still be sustained as there is a lower chance of long liquidation cascades occurring in the short term. Note \u2013 the spot market should also be considered in order to make more precise predictions."

        "title": "Ethereum Scaling Solution zkSync Launches Alpha Mainnet - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA day after Arbitrum\u2019s public airdrop, another Ethereum scaler is launching its own offering.\n\nMatter Labs\u2019 zkSync Era is now open to users to begin bridging and using the layer-2 technology.\n\nIt\u2019s the final step in a phased mainnet launch that began in 2019.\n\nRollups allow Ethereum to scale by moving transactions off of the mainnet, and onto a layer-2 network like zkSync. Users can then go about their business on this second network, with transactions being batched and compressed into a small piece of data called a proof. This proof is then sent back to Ethereum and verified.\n\nToday\u2019s zkSync launch does, however, come with a word of warning.\n\n\u201cIt will definitely be an alpha version of the system,\u201d Matter Labs head of engineering Anthony Rose told Decrypt. \u201cWe're not claiming this is the system that we expect it to be either 2 or 3 years from now. There\u2019s lots and lots more engineering work to do. But this is the core skeleton of the zkEVM.\u201d\n\nA zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine, or zkEVM, is another core aspect of zkSync\u2019s scaling product. The team is implementing a version of rollup technology that draws from zero-knowledge cryptography, hence the \u201czk,\u201d rather than so-called optimistic rollups. ZkSync\u2019s virtual machine thus allows for this complex cryptography to be easily integrated with Ethereum as it exists today, tried and battle-tested.\n\nzkSync\u2019s defense mechanisms\n\nThough the gates are open to permissionless onboarding, with various constraints lifted, Rose explained that there will still be a few key security measures in place.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe most notable will be delayed withdrawals from zkSync\u2019s bridge technology. Because zkSync is a layer-2 solution, users must bridge their funds from Ethereum to zkSync. This means using a proprietary bridge built by Matter Labs to make these transfers possible.\n\n\u201cThis is the point where, honestly, if there's one place where I felt like the most acute risk, it is probably this,\u201d said Rose. \u201cIt's really just because of what we've seen over the last few years in the ecosystem where this [bridges] has been a serious point of weakness.\u201d\n\nBridge exploits have led to some of the industry's biggest losses, with the most notable being the $622 million hack of Axie Infinity's Ronin bridge last year.\n\n\u201cThey won't be instantaneous on day one. Because we want to be in a position where if the worst happens, and there is a major security incident, we want users to know that we've got the ability to mitigate a bad actor,\u201d said Rose.\n\nUsers will instead have to wait one day to execute their withdrawals but Rose said his team would be \u201crelaxing that\u201d feature over the coming months.\n\nAfter non-instantaneous withdrawals, zkSync has also teamed up with security auditors OpenZeppelin, among others.\n\n\u201cAs part of that, we've been working a lot on a very sophisticated monitoring platform,\u201d Rose told Decrypt. \u201cMonitoring on-chain activities, monitoring off-chain activities, monitoring across on-chain and off-chain. Does the amount that you think has been breached into your system by the smart contract layer correspond to how much you see in a database?\u201d\n\nStill, nothing, especially in crypto, is foolproof.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut now it's time to get the product out in the wild, he said.\n\n\"We've spent millions of dollars on audits, bug bounties, public contests, private reviews,\" said Rose. \"At some point, you do cross that competence threshold and say, 'Okay, I think we're ready.'\""

        "title": "Decentralized Identity Platform DotNames Ends the Hustle to Memorize Long Ethereum Addresses - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "DotNames\n\nDotNames puts an end to the need of remembering lengthy wallet addresses by allowing users the option of customizing usernames and using them instead of their addresses.\n\nLondon, UK, March 24, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Despite attaining new and unimaginable heights, there are many hassles in the crypto space that need to be addressed. Not just this, but many of the features and innovations being offered are complex and difficult to adopt. The crypto world needs to make its process simple and more user-oriented. Among the many problems faced by investors, memorization of the 42-character-long Ethereum address is perhaps the most problematic of all. What the sector needs right now is a solution to this hindrance. DotNames is a newbie firm in the crypto sector that caters to this issue.\n\nWhat is DotNames\n\nUsers in the crypto space have been subjected to great anguish since the advent of the Ethereum addresses in 2015. They are an absolute nuisance since remembering them is almost near impossible. Individuals who have more than one wallet do not even bother to try and memorize these long codes anymore.\n\nDotNames is a superlative cryptocurrency firm that puts an end to this problem by providing customized domains. Individuals who have trouble remembering their wallet addresses can create a user name of their choice and use it instead of their address. The DotName username can be as short or long as one wishes for and can have any character.\n\nInstant Utility\n\nThe firm has launched a mini wallet dApp which gives utility to the DotName domains. Individuals wishing to send tokens to other users simply have to enter that person\u2019s DotName domain in the transfer section of the wallet instead of the lengthy 42-character address.\n\nA similar process is followed when receiving tokens. Users simply have to share their DotName domains with the sender to experience a seamless transfer of assets at the rate of knots.\n\nStore Limitless Data\n\nAnother great use case of the DotName domain is that it can be utilized for storing almost anything. This can be bios, personal information, and specific information. The information stored is 100% secure and only the domain owner has permission to modify that data.\n\nStory continues\n\nDecentralized\n\nThe world is rapidly adopting the concept of decentralization in all spheres. DotName is no different. It employs blockchain technology to offer a decentralized environment for its users. This means that only domain owners can update or change the name and specifications of the address.\n\nCustomizable\n\nWallet addresses allotted by Ethereum are always too prolix and users have no say in what they want their addresses to be. With DotNames, this is no longer the case. Since DotName domains are a replacement for Ethereum addresses, users can thus give them any name that they want.\n\nStorage\n\nCompanies or individuals looking for a place to store important data can also make use of DotNames. The firm allows users to store any type and amount of data. This data is linked to their DotName domains.\n\nTokenomics\n\nThe endurance and longevity of any cryptocurrency firm are highly dependent on how well the company manages its finances. For this reason, DotNames has laid down a well-considered Tokenomics.\n\nThe native token of the firm, $DNS has a total supply of 100 million coins. For every transaction, the firm fixes a 6% tax. The tax rates have been kept low to refrain from burdening traders.\n\nDotNames efficiently utilizes the tax collected for the benefit of the community and the firm itself. A 5% tax is used for marketing purposes. Marketing is of utmost importance for alluring new investors. The remaining 1% of the tax is used for development.\n\nThe firm uses 50% of the generated revenue for a buyback. $DNS tokens obtained via buyback are burned to reduce the circulating supply. The reduced supply together with an increased demand for the token helps to ameliorate the price of the token.\n\nRoadmap\n\nDotNames has divided its roadmap into three major parts. Ignition, Ascent, and Orbit. Ignition, the first part has been completed. Ascent is still in progress, which will be closely followed by Orbit.\n\nFinal Words\n\nDotNames offers its services on leading blockchains such as Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Polygon. The firm and its multi-utility token are bound to have a lasting impact on the crypto sector.\n\nTo learn more about the project, visit the official website, read the whitepaper, or follow DotNames on social media to become a part of the DotNames community:\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Telegram | Medium\n\n\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThe information provided in this release is not investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s Potential Rivalries: Exploring the Competition among Smart Contract Platforms - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is known for its smart contract capabilities, which enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on its blockchain.\n\nHowever, as blockchain technology becomes more widely used, other smart contract platforms are emerging as possible competitors to Ethereum. In this post, we will look at the competition among smart contract platforms as well as Ethereum's possible competitors.\n\nSmart Contract Platform on Ethereum\n\nEthereum's smart contract platform is one of the industry's most established and widely used. It's been used to build dApps in a variety of industries, including finance, gaming, and supply chain management.\n\nThe platform\u2019s success can be ascribed to its accessibility and the large developer community that contributes to its development and upkeep.\n\nHowever, several new competitors are challenging Ethereum\u2019s supremacy in the smart contract platform market.\n\nCompetitors to Ethereum\u2019s Smart Contract Platform\n\nCardano\n\nCardano is a decentralized blockchain platform that debuted in 2017. Charles Hoskinson, one of Ethereum's co-founders, invented it. The network employs a proof-of-stake consensus process, which is more energy-efficient than Ethereum's proof-of-work mechanism. Cardano also claims to be more scalable than Ethereum, with a transaction rate of up to 257 per second.\n\nPolkadot\n\nPolkadot is a multi-chain platform that began operations in 2020. It was developed by Gavin Wood, who was also a co-founder of Ethereum. The platform employs a novel sharding method that allows for parallel transaction processing, making it more scalable than Ethereum.\n\nPolkadot also enables blockchain interoperability, allowing for smooth communication and data transfer across them.\n\nBinance Smart Chain\n\nBinance Smart Chain is a blockchain technology that was introduced in 2020 by the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. It employs a proof-of-staked authority consensus mechanism, which is more efficient and less energy-intensive than Ethereum's proof-of-work process. Binance Smart Chain is also less expensive than Ethereum, with lower transaction gas fees.\n\nSolana\n\nSolana, which was introduced in 2020, is a high-performance blockchain platform. It employs a novel consensus technique known as Proof of History, which enables rapid and secure transaction processing. Solana promises to be one of the quickest blockchain platforms today, capable of processing up to 65,000 transactions per second.\n\nEthereum's Rivals' Opportunities and Challenges\n\nWhile these new smart contract platforms threaten Ethereum's supremacy, they also bring substantial potential and difficulties.\n\nOpportunities\n\nAs new platforms arise, there is a potential for innovation and the development of new features and capabilities that can benefit the blockchain ecosystem as a whole.\n\nScalability: Many of these platforms are working to improve their scalability, which is a major hurdle for Ethereum. If such solutions are successfully implemented, they may attract developers and users who want rapid and efficient transaction processing.\n\nCost: Some platforms are focusing on lowering transaction costs, which may entice developers and consumers who are put off by Ethereum's high gas fees.\n\nChallenges\n\nEthereum's supremacy is due in part to the network effects that have built around its platform. Many developers and users are already familiar with Ethereum, which makes developing and deploying dApps on its platform easier. It will be difficult for new platforms to overcome the network effect and gain a large user base.\n\nSecurity: Ethereum has been through many battles and has a solid security infrastructure in place. New platforms may lack the same level of protection and be subject to cyber attacks.\n\nAdoption: Creating a successful smart contract platform necessitates not only technology but also a developer and user community. It will be difficult for new platforms to attract and retain this community, especially given that established platforms such as Ethereum already have a big and loyal community.\n\nWill Ethereum 2.0 Blow Its Competition out of the Water?\n\nEthereum 2.0 is a major upgrade that promises to deliver significant improvements in scalability, security, and sustainability.\n\nOne of the most significant changes is the shift to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which is expected to make the network more energy-efficient and secure.\n\nAnd, what perhaps is the key differentiating element, Ethereum 2.0 will introduce sharding, which will divide the network into smaller pieces, enabling it to process more transactions in parallel.\n\nWhen taking a closer look at how Ethereum 2.0 compares to Cardano, Solana, and Polkadot, the advantage given by ETH 2.0 sharding becomes evident.\n\nETH 2.0 VS Cardano\n\nCardano is a third-generation blockchain that was created to address the scalability and sustainability issues of existing blockchains.\n\nThe Cardano platform uses a PoS consensus mechanism, which is similar to Ethereum 2.0. However, Cardano has given the PoS model a twist by using a rather unique approach called Ouroboros, which is designed to be more secure and energy-efficient than other PoS implementations.\n\nBut, while Cardano may be an impressive platform, it seems it won\u2019t be able to match the speed and efficiency of Ethereum 2.0.\n\nEthereum 2.0's sharding approach is expected to enable it to process up to 100,000 transactions per second, while Cardano's current capacity is limited to just 257 transactions per second.\n\nETH 2.0 VS Solana\n\nSolana is another third-generation blockchain that aims to address the scalability limitations of existing blockchains. The Solana platform uses a unique consensus mechanism called Proof of History (PoH), which is designed to enable high-speed processing of transactions.\n\nSolana can process up to 65,000 transactions per second, which is significantly higher than Ethereum's current capacity but lower than what ETH 2.0 promises to deliver.\n\nThis happens because while Solana's processing speed is impressive, Ethereum 2.0's sharding capabilities are expected to give a massive boost to its transaction speed.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum 2.0's shift to PoS is expected to make the network more energy-efficient and secure than Solana's PoH consensus mechanism.\n\nETH 2.0 VS Polkadot\n\nPolkadot is a third-generation blockchain that aims to enable interoperability between different blockchains.\n\nAdditionally, the Polkadot platform uses a unique sharding approach which makes this blockchain duel much more interesting.\n\nPolkadot enables multiple chains to run in parallel, enabling interoperability between them. This feature is intended to enable different blockchains to communicate and interact with each other more seamlessly, which is currently a major limitation in the blockchain space.\n\nMoreover, Polkadot is able to provide stronger guarantees than ETH 2.0 with fewer validators per shard, which is an incredible feat many seem to overlook.\n\nBut, while Polkadot's vision of interoperability is unique and promises to deliver more TPS than ETH 2.0, one can't rule out Ethereum just yet as it has a large and active developer community which is expected to continue to drive innovation and development on the platform.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs blockchain technology becomes more widely adopted, new smart contract platforms are likely to emerge as possible competitors to Ethereum. While Ethereum has tremendous market domination, it is not indestructible.\n\nThe advent of new platforms opens up new avenues for innovation and advancement in the blockchain ecosystem as a whole. however, these systems present substantial hurdles, such as network effects, security, and acceptance.\n\nFinally, the ability of any smart contract platform to attract and sustain a loyal community of developers and users will determine its success. While Ethereum's competitors may have certain benefits in terms of scalability, cost, and creativity, they may find it difficult to overcome the network effects that have been built around the Ethereum platform.\n\nOnly time will tell whether the platform emerges as the dominating force in the market for smart contract platforms."

        "title": "NYAG Questions Historic Classification of Ethereum\u2019s Cryptocurrency in KuCoin Lawsuit - ArentFox Schiff",
        "content": "On\n\nNew York\u2019s Martin Act[1] provides that it is unlawful for any dealer, broker, or salesman to sell, offer, or purchase securities from the public unless and until such dealer, broker or salesman files a registration with the attorney general.[2] For the suit to succeed, the NYAG will need to prove that Ether, LUNA, or TerraUSD are either \u201ccommodities\u201d[3] or \u201csecurities\u201d under the Martin Act.[4]\n\nThe complaint seeks a full accounting relating to KuCoin\u2019s New York customers, including transaction records covering the last six years, disgorgement of all revenue obtained from New York residents, and reimbursement of the NYAG\u2019s court costs.\n\nWhat is KuCoin?\n\nFounded in 2017, KuCoin is a cryptocurrency platform where individuals can buy and sell cryptocurrencies. In addition to cryptocurrency trading, KuCoin allows users to engage in spot and margin trading, trade futures contracts, and buying and selling NFTs. The platform also allows users to earn interest on and/or staking rewards with their cryptocurrency via its KuCoin Earn service. According to KuCoin, one in four cryptocurrency holders use its platform.\n\nNYAG\u2019s Complaint Against KuCoin\n\nThe KuCoin complaint asserts that Ether \u2014 the cryptocurrency native to the Ethereum blockchain \u2014 is a security (as opposed to a commodity) and further alleges that since KuCoin provides a platform where Ether may be traded without being registered as a securities broker or dealer, KuCoin violated the Martin Act.\n\nThe complaint is one of the first times a regulator has claimed in public court filings that Ether is a security; an assertion that would likely have significant ramifications for the blockchain, web3, and crypto industries if endorsed by the courts or other regulators.\n\nCentral to the NYAG\u2019s argument that Ether is a security is the recent shift of the Ethereum blockchain from a \u201cproof-of-work\u201d to \u201cproof-of-stake\u201d method for verifying transactions. The complaint alleges that as a result of this shift, Ether no longer needs to rely on competition between computers for verification, but rather requires Ether to rely on a pooling method that incentivizes users to own and stake Ether and that any Ether holder may now profit from Ether by merely participating in staking. The NYAG argues that this investment-oriented approach contrasts with Ethereum\u2019s original proof-of-work framework under which computers on the Ethereum network competed to answer a \u201cmathematical puzzle\u201d to verify transactions on the blockchain and receive digital asset awards.\n\nIn addition to this proof-of-work versus proof-of-stake argument, the NYAG makes the argument, albeit obliquely, that Ether, over time, became an investment of money, in a common enterprise, for profit, derived primarily by the efforts of others; characteristics that are typically associated with securities or \u201cinvestment contracts.\u201d To support these allegations, the NYAG asserts that \u201cdevelopers of Ether promoted it as an investment that was contingent on the growth of the Ethereum network.\u201d Further, the complaint quotes the Ethereum Foundation, which notes on its website that many users of Ether \u201csee it as an investment, similar to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\u201d The switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, per the complaint, has significantly altered the value proposition of Ether, since \u201cpossession of Ether translates directly to profit potential by earning staking rewards.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Ether\u2019s development and management, per the complaint, is largely driven by a small number of developers standing to profit from the growth and related appreciation of Ether. The complaint also asserts that the revenue generated by Ether sales is reinvested to promote the development of Ethereum, thereby tying the fortunes of token holders to management. Finally, the NYAG asserts that the Ethereum Foundation retains significant influence over Ethereum, often being a catalyst behind major initiatives that impact Ether\u2019s functionality and price. As such, according to the complaint, the growth and development of the Ethereum network, as well as any promised profits for \u201cinvestors,\u201d are dependent upon the managerial efforts of the network\u2019s founders and management teams. All of which, according to the complaint, are indicative of securities.\n\nNext Steps\n\nThis KuCoin complaint, while unique in many ways, is unremarkable in its attempted broad application of securities laws to cryptocurrency and other blockchain based tokens. Given that this complaint represents the first instance in which Ether is alleged to be a security under New York law and the major repercussions such a finding could have, it is notable that the NYAG chose not to provide a more in-depth analysis of Ether\u2019s (or LUNA\u2019s or TerraUSD\u2019s) status as a security under the Martin Act.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if other states elect to commence enforcement against KuCoin and the sponsors of other crypto assets under their securities laws.\n\nOur team will be monitoring this case as well as Dapper Labs and DraftKings as they progress. Please feel free to contact your ArentFox Schiff LLP attorney or any of the authors with questions or concerns.\n\n[1] Article 23-A of New York General Business Law (GBL).\n\n[2] GBL \u00a7 359-e (3).\n\n[3] GBL \u00a7 359-e (14).\n\n[4] Under the Martin Act, investments of money in common enterprises with profits to be derived primarily from the efforts of others are considered \u201csecurities.\u201d"

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Bulls Brace For Quick Drop As Charts Predict 10% Downswing - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) price has shown signs of a potential downturn as it reached an exhaustion of bullish momentum, signaling a possible drop in the near future. According to analysts, ETH has produced a clear sell signal, indicating a shift in the cryptocurrency\u2019s trend.\n\nThe world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been on a bullish run for the past few weeks, with its price surging by more than 34% in just a matter of days, according CoinMarketCap data.\n\nThe digital asset has been benefiting from a strong market sentiment, as well as the growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). However, experts are suggesting that this could be an opportunity for long-term investors to accumulate and take advantage of the potential dip.\n\nEthereum Price To Face Immediate Resistance\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ethereum has been experiencing a bullish trend and traded above $1,800 earlier today, although it has since fallen to $1,759 at the time of writing.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), and Ripple (XRP) have also seen significant gains.\n\nETH/USD pair is positively biased, its upward momentum is not as strong as Bitcoin\u2019s. Ethereum is currently struggling to break through the $1,800 level and may face resistance at $1,900 if it does.\n\nDespite Ethereum\u2019s price reaching higher highs since March 14, its relative strength index (RSI) and Awesome Oscillator have produced lower highs, indicating a divergence. Divergence can lead to declining momentum and a potential reversal in price.\n\nIn the context of cryptocurrency prices, divergence refers to a situation where the price of a particular cryptocurrency moves in a different direction than that of a related asset or benchmark.\n\nETH total market cap now at $214 billion on the daily chart at TradingView.com\n\nFor example, if the price of Bitcoin is rising, but the price of Ethereum is falling, this could be considered a divergence between the two cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis phenomenon can occur due to a variety of factors, such as differences in market sentiment, news events, or technical factors affecting each cryptocurrency.\n\nTraders and investors may use divergence as a signal to adjust their trading strategies, as it can indicate a shift in market dynamics or potential opportunities for profit.\n\nBullish Thesis At Stake\n\nAlthough Ethereum\u2019s price has been on an upward trend, it is possible that it may experience a 10% drop and fall to either the psychological level of $1,600 or the monthly level of $1,677. This potential drop should be approached with caution, as it could signal a shift in market sentiment.\n\nSpecifically, if the price drops below the $1,600 level and continues to experience selling pressure, it could lead to the $1,422 level becoming a resistance level and invalidate the optimistic outlook for Ethereum.\n\n-Featured image from EthereumPrice\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The U.S. Federal Reserve balance sheet rises almost $100 billion this week, taking the total to $400 billion. The central bank continues to print more money for rescuing cash-strapped banks since the collapse of Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank. Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have soared higher as a result, with the crypto fear and greed index rising to 61.\n\nUS Banks borrowed a combined $163.9 billion from the U.S. Federal Reserve, against $164.8 billion in the earlier week. Borrowing rates by banks have increased after the Fed raised interest rates by another 25 bps to 4.75%-5% and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said no blanket insurance for all bank deposits.\n\nadvertisement\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk, billionaire Bill Ackman, former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan, and Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood criticized the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s rate hikes amid the banking crisis.\n\nBitcoin Price To Hit $35,000 and Ethereum Set For $2000?\n\nBitcoin price rises over 2% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading near $28,100. The 24-hour low and high are $27,359 and $28,729, respectively. While the BTC price has increased, the trading volume has decreased in the last 24 hours.\n\nOn-chain analysis and sentiment analysis revealed Coinbase Premium Index is decreasing and Korea Premium Index is increasing. High premium values indicate strong buying pressure by U.S. and Korean investors. However, the current scenario signals a more balanced price momentum.\n\nMoreover, 4 on-chain metrics reveal potential correction in the BTC price for more upside moves in the coming days as positive sentiment rise. Analysts said Bitcoin has the potential to hit $35,000 amid the banking crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum price is also witnessing an upside move, with ETH price rising 3% in the last 24 hours amid bullish sentiment. ETH price is trading at $1,710, with a 24-hour high of $1,853. Ethereum price will be volatile amid high gas fees and the Shanghai upgrade set for April 12.\n\nAlso Read: Binance CEO \u201cCZ\u201d, Nic Carter On Repercussions Of Operation Choke Point 2.0"

        "content": "After several spikes since the beginning of the year, up over 40% from January, Ethereum investors have profited, translating into key metrics. According to the on-chain analysis firm Glassnode, the number of Ethereum addresses in profit has now hit a 10-month high of nearly 64 million.\n\nThis comes after ETH dipped below $1,200 last year, allowing investors to accumulate more cryptocurrency. These investors are profiting from its price spike to above $1,800 on Thursday.\n\nProfitable Ethereum Addresses Increasing\n\nAccording to data from Glassnode, the total number of addresses that are in profit (7D MA) has now surged to a 10-month high of approximately 63 million. Notably, this is not the first time Ethereum will push its total number of addresses in gain to a figure nearing 64 million.\n\nBefore the latest recorded number of addresses in profit, the previous 10-month high sat at around 63.9 million as of March 23, according to the same source. Meanwhile, Ethereum hasn\u2019t been the only crypto to see a spike in profitable investors.\n\nEarlier this month, Glassnode reported that the total number of Bitcoin (BTC) addresses worth a million dollars or more surged to more than 67,000, slightly higher than the amount of 65,000 in January earlier this year when BTC first crossed $20,000 in months.\n\nFurthermore, Glassnode announced earlier today that Ethereum non-zero addresses had reached a new ATH of 96 million. This data suggests that more people are buying the cryptocurrency amid the bullish price action.\n\nETH To Continue Rally?\n\nOver the past two weeks, ETH price has rallied by nearly 10%, from a low of $1,723 on March 17 to as high as trading at $1,845 on March 23. Though at the time of writing, the asset is seeing a retracement down by 3.7% in the last 24 hours with a trading price of $1,775.\n\nMeanwhile, looking at the 1-day time frame, it seems as though the asset\u2019s slight retracement may not last for long as the price would still need to hit the external high just above the $2,000 region.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum\u2019s trading volume hasn\u2019t made any significant move in the past 7 days. Still, the range between $12 billion indicated a possible accumulation which may result in another rally that may happen soon, given the upcoming Shanghai upgrade set to occur next month.\n\nInterestingly, the asset\u2019s market capitalization has added over $5 billion in the past week, moving from a $207 billion last week to $212 billion as of today.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Commodity or Security: How This 1 Question Could Save Your Crypto Portfolio - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Before the recent surge in prices, the beginning of March was a rough time for crypto. Multiple lawsuits against crypto companies came about, and fears of coming regulation increased as investors prepared for the worst.\n\nSince then, talks of widespread regulation seem to have cooled as the recent banking fiasco has taken center stage and the crypto market has been on a tear. But there is still plenty of reason to believe that regulation of crypto will be coming to the U.S., and investors need to make sure they are prepared when this day comes. It isn't so much a matter of if, but when.\n\nThe current crypto landscape\n\nDue to the complexity and vastness of the cryptocurrency asset class, legislators have struggled to implement any sweeping regulation. Despite this, past comments from key officials have shed light on the possible path of action they will take, and it boils down to one thing: Is crypto a commodity or a security?\n\nTo answer this polarizing question, lawmakers typically summon what is known as the Howey test to define whether an asset is a security. Deriving its name from a 1946 Supreme Court case, the Howey test analyzes an asset in four ways to determine if it is a security. The Howey test says assets are considered to be securities if there is an investment of money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profit derived from the efforts of others.\n\nI hate to be a buzzkill, but this sounds like most cryptocurrencies in circulation today.\n\nWhat looming regulation could look like\n\nSo why does this all matter? Well, it's relatively simple. Should legislators deem that most of crypto is a security, then that means the entire landscape will dramatically change. Just like publicly traded companies that offer shares of stock, cryptocurrencies that are considered securities will have to register and comply with rules enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This will ultimately lead to more stringent reporting to ensure cryptocurrencies are meeting transparency standards. It will also create more barriers, and subsequently create a less than ideal environment for price appreciation.\n\nOn the contrary, should a cryptocurrency not pass the Howey test and be considered a commodity, then the amount of possible regulation dwindles significantly as commodities are not held to the same standard as securities.\n\nWith this in mind, it is crucial for investors to tailor their portfolios to prioritize cryptocurrencies that are most likely to be considered commodities, as it will ensure the least amount of disruption.\n\nBy using this approach, two options come to the forefront -- Bitcoin (BTC 1.04%) and Ethereum (ETH 1.43%).\n\nWhen asked about his thoughts on Bitcoin, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has said on multiple occasions that he views Bitcoin as a commodity. This is likely due to the fact that there is no single, well-known group or person that keeps Bitcoin running and as such, it doesn't pass the Howey test. It truly is a decentralized network, and this is the primary reason most other legislators happen to agree with Gensler.\n\nHowever, while there seems to be consensus that Bitcoin is a commodity, there is open debate as to whether or not the world's second most valuable cryptocurrency, Ethereum, falls into security or commodity territory.\n\nSurprisingly, while Gensler claims Ethereum is a security, his counterpart at the Commodities Future Trading Commission (CFTC) believes it meets the criteria of a commodity and thus is out of the SEC's jurisdiction.\n\nWhether this is the case or not will likely take more time to determine. But the key point is that there are split opinions. This could be viewed as a positive development for Ethereum.\n\nMaking a game plan today\n\nMoving forward, crypto investors in the U.S. should attempt to prioritize investing in cryptocurrencies that could be considered commodities. That makes the list relatively short since it likely only includes Bitcoin and Ethereum. But when taking into account that these two make up more than 60% of the value in the entire industry and most other cryptocurrencies' prices are correlated to them, it could actually come to be the most profitable strategy.\n\nWhile cryptocurrencies are traded internationally and not wholly subject to just the decisions made by regulators in the U.S., there is little doubt that sweeping and dramatic regulation would negatively impact the majority of cryptocurrency prices. As it seems like this reality will come to fruition sooner than later, it would be advisable for investors to keep their crypto portfolios simple and prioritize investing in assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum."

        "content": "Earnings from transaction fees on the network declined by 3.66% over the previous week.\n\nThe Open Interest (OI) for ETH rose, complementing the increase in price.\n\nIn preparation for the much-anticipated Shanghai hard fork which is scheduled to go live on 12 April, Ethereum [ETH] developers asked all network validators to upgrade their nodes.\n\nDuring the All Core Developers Consensus Call, Ethereum client teams gave updates about the status of their final releases after which Alex Stokes, who chaired the call, asked all stakeholders to follow relevant distribution channels to take the next step.\n\nAnother developer Paritosh added that mainnet nodes were getting synced and once final client releases were out, developers will execute one final mainnet shadow fork, a week before the eventual launch.\n\nEthereum conducted successful launches of the Shanghai Upgrade, also known as Shapella, on various test networks. However, the last one on Goerli, the largest public Ethereum testnet, saw a dip in participation rates because validator nodes didn\u2019t upgrade.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nAll\u2019s not well with staking!\n\nStaking activity on the Ethereum network saw steady growth as per data revealed by Glassnode. The total number of validators on the network reached 564,951, an increase of 5% over the previous month.\n\nBut while the overall number of validators grew, the pace at which new players were entering the ecosystem declined. From a one-year high of 6,302 on 25 February, the number of new validators plummeted to 483 as of 23 March.\n\nA similar trajectory was observed for the growth in new value staked.\n\nOne possible reason could be due to the decline in revenue collected by the validators. As per data by Staking Rewards, earnings from transaction fees declined by 3.66% over the previous week.\n\nPositive signals for ETH\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH increased by 3.36% to $1813.97 in the 24-hour period, as per CoinMarketCap.

        "content": "Analyst suggested that Ethereum could soon follow Bitcoin\u2019s rally.\n\nNFT trades and lowering gas fees may impact network activity in the long run.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] has been seeing quite a rally over the last few days, inspiring a lot of positive speculation around the king coin. However, it appears that Ethereum [ETH] will also soon be joining the rally and see a surge in its prices.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nWhere BTC goes ETH follows?\n\nAccording to analyst crypto sunmoon on CryptoQuant, the drop in prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum from 9 \u2013 13 March resulted in a swift decrease in exchange reserves. It is possible that investors took advantage of the situation by depositing more Bitcoin into exchanges than they purchased during the subsequent rebound.\n\nIn comparison to Bitcoin, Ethereum has not experienced a significant surge and the number of withdrawals has remained low. However, sunmoon believes that once Bitcoin\u2019s upward trend is fully realized, there may be a substantial increase in Ethereum\u2019s value.\n\nAnother positive indicator for Ethereum would be the rising number of addresses on the network. According to Glassnode\u2019s data, addresses holding more than 0.01 of ETH have reached an eight-month high.\n\nHowever, the overall activity on the network could soon slow down. This would be because of the falling NFT trades on the Ethereum network. This suggested that users were losing interest in Ethereum-based NFTs.\n\nAnother indicator of the same would be the falling gas usage, implying that the activity on the Ethereum network has fallen.\n\nEven though ETH NFT interest has started to decline, Open Interest had started to surge at press time.\n\nAs the Shanghai Upgrade approaches, many traders would be interested in making bets on the future of Ethereum. However, it is important to note that high Open Interest also implies that there could be high volatility in the future.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Futures Contracts Open Interest just reached a 6-month high of $625,263,663 on #Deribit Previous 6-month high of $623,061,491 was observed on 20 March 2023 View metric:https://t.co/uXJN8QUW5D pic.twitter.com/LduET6sFll \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) March 21, 2023\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAt press time, the trader sentiment is mostly bearish.

        "content": "Some of the biggest names in decentralized finance, including Uniswap, Sushi, Maker and Curve, are set to launch March 24 on zero-knowledge proof roll-up zkSync Era.\n\nThe Ethereum layer 2 scaling network has finally opened to users in alpha after four years in development, enabling faster and cheaper transactions. It is the first Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible zk-Rollup to launch on mainnet (competitor StarkWare uses a bespoke language called Cairo), allowing most Ethereum DApps to simply port over with very few changes.\n\nBetween 32 to 50 projects are expected to go live on March 24 or over the weekend, including Balancer, Pyth Network, Mute, Redstone, Graph and Argent. Banxa, Yearn Finance, Celer, Chainlink, Aragon, Woo Network and Tracer DAO are also porting to the network.\n\n\u201cFriday for us is the big one, it\u2019s full launch alpha,\u201d Anthony Rose, the head of engineering for zkSync developer Matter Labs, told Cointelegraph earlier in the week.\n\n\u201cBut the systems are super complex and there's a million other things we want to do.\u201d\n\nWhile zkSync Era can provide scaling \"orders of magnitude\" greater than Ethereum\u2019s current 10 to 12 transactions per second (TPS), Rose said it would offer \u201ctens of TPS\u201d initially and scale up as demand requires.\n\nThe project launched its \u201cfair onboarding alpha\u201d on Feb. 17, allowing projects to port over and test out security and optimizations. Matter Labs said it spent $3.8 million on security testing, seven independent security audits and a bug bounty program to reduce the risk of any incidents.\n\nThe mission continues, and we\u2019ve got more exciting news to share from zkSync Era\u2019s fast-growing ecosystem. Today, we\u2019re announcing our collaboration with WEMADE, creators of @WemixNetwork, to make the future of blockchain gaming a reality. #jointhemissionhttps://t.co/UVBHE838Rr \u2014 zkSync \u220e (@zksync) March 22, 2023\n\nWhat is a zk-Rollup?\n\nZk-Rollups \u2014 which include zkSync, Scroll and solutions from Polygon, StarkWare and Consensys \u2014 compute transactions away from the Ethereum blockchain while providing a tiny cryptographic proof that is written as a single transaction back on Ethereum showing that a bundle of other transactions has been carried out correctly. zkSync also employs recursion, which generates a proof showing a batch of other proofs (each representing many transactions) have been carried out.\n\nZk-Rollups can enable virtually instant withdrawals, giving them an advantage over optimistic-rollup layer 2s such as Optimism, where withdrawals take a week. However, zkSync Era will impose a 24-hour waiting period initially as a security precaution.\n\n\u201cThe reason being is if you have some critical bug that has somehow got through the many different audits and security mechanisms and somebody completely drains the protocol, this is obviously a disaster for everybody involved,\u201d he said. The waiting period is likely to be reduced to an hour within weeks.\n\nNative account abstraction\n\nzkSync has also enabled native account abstraction, meaning every account in the network is a \u201csmart account\u201d that can utilize two-factor authentication (2FA), social recovery, autopay transactions and more via smart contract wallet providers like Argent.\n\n\"This was and probably still is my favorite feature,\u201d Rose said, explaining that it\u2019s an improvement on Ethereum\u2019s ERC-4337 implementation and will help remove the \u201cjankiness\u201d for new crypto users getting into the space.\n\n\"Scalability is fine, the infrastructure needs to be there. But it needs to come with a user experience that can also scale.\"\n\nAccount abstraction is a way to appeal to the next billion users \u26a1\ufe0f #Ethereum https://t.co/Ma3O0iPRhj \u2014 Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) March 1, 2023\n\nNot decentralized yet\n\nzkSync Era will not be fully decentralized on launch, so the team can implement fast fixes for any security or technical issues. However, a time lock will later be implemented so that the Security Council and community can sign off on decisions.\n\nLike competitor StarkWare, zkSync relies on a centralized sequencer and prover, which are faster, but provide a centralized point of failure. Running a prover, however, requires the purchase of expensive hardware or renting cloud capacity at $10,000 a month, which makes decentralizing that aspect of the network tricker. Underscoring the challenge, the decentralized version of StarkWare is called StarkNet and is currently running at a paltry 0.11 TPS.\n\nRose said a new proof system was already being developed that substantially reduces hardware requirements and should be available on mainnet this year.\n\n\u201cSo the idea for us is to get through this, then start talking about how we upgrade the proof system to be such that we can be meaningfully decentralized,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere's lots of hard problems to solve to make the systems real.\u201d\n\nNFT Creator: Creating \u2018organic\u2019 generative art from robotic algorithms: Emily Xie"

        "content": "Despite the US Federal Reserve increasing the interest rate by another 25 basis points, Bitcoin and other crypto tokens were trading higher on Friday. The unrest in the banking sectors developed some interest in the digital token market. Traders lapped up some well-known blue-chip tokens.\n\n\n\nBitcoin rose more than 3 per cent to regain the $28,000 mark as the markets digested the US Fed rate hikes. Its largest peer, Ethereum, was also up about 4 per cent, regaining the $1,800 level. Altcoins outperformed the headline peers, rising up to 22 per cent.\n\nBarring the US dollar-pegged stablecoins, all other top crypto tokens were trading with decent gains on Friday. Tron jumped more than 7 per cent, while Litecoin surged 6 per cent, Avalanche and Dogecoin added 4 per cent each, whereas XRP, Polkadot and Solana rose 3 per cent, each.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading with big gains at $1.18 trillion, jumping more than 3 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes slumped over 19 per cent, close to $55.11 billion.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market reacted sharply to the interest rate hike announced by the Fed in its latest FOMC meeting. Bitcoin was poised to test the $30,000 level but lost steam after the Fed continued its hawkish stance to tame soaring inflation, said Dhruvil Shah, SVP of Technology at Liminal.\n\n\n\n\"Bitcoin recovered from the Fed shock today and is back above the $28,000 level while Ethereum and other digital assets showed a similar upward trend. The Fed may continue its moderate rate hike to manage the health of the economy and we can expect restricted growth in the markets due to high borrowing costs,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View By Giottus\n\nRecently, Ethereum (ETH) soared to new heights in 2023 after reclaiming its golden pocket resistance, owing to a substantial 20 per cent rise in just 48 hours a couple of weeks ago. Hovering around the $1,800 mark, ETH has experienced a phenomenal 50 per cent growth year-to-date.\n\n\n\nFor the past week, ETH has been trading between the Fibonacci resistance at $1,826 and its golden pocket at $1,705. The upcoming days promise to be a thrilling ride for ETH, as the crypto is primed to potentially reach a new yearly high. If Ethereum can claim the 0.78 Fibonacci resistance, the path to $2,030\u2014its highest point since August of last year\u2014will be wide open, given the absence of any strong resistance above.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, robust support of the golden pocket below serves as a safety net, instilling confidence in bulls to go all-in on Ethereum.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, bears should be mindful of ETH's 50 and 200-day moving averages, which stand at $1,633 and $1,433, respectively, and are considerably below the market price. This could present a window of opportunity for bears to drag ETH down. However, they should exercise caution and hold off on any long-term moves until they manage to push ETH below its golden pocket. Once this is achieved, they can set their sights on the next Fibonacci support at $1,550.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels\n\nResistance: $1,826, $2,030\n\nSupport: $1,705, $1,665, $1,550\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "SAITAMA is an ERC-20 token that started as a meme coin in 2021 and upgraded into a utility coin in June 2022. Like other ERC-20 tokens, the SAITAMA coin is created and hosted on the Ethereum blockchain, meaning it will eventually be part of it.\n\nTo transform from the perception of being a meme coin, SAITAMA added a wide range of innovative Decentralized Finance (DeFi) features into its ecosystem. This action aligns with making meme coins more accessible and safer for generation Z.\n\nAs a result, its platform (Saitama) comes loaded with unique features such as the \u2018anti-whale\u2019 that prevents established wallet holders from influencing the overall token prices or transactions.\n\nLet\u2019s explore Saitama and how to buy it on different platforms.\n\nWhat is Saitama Inu?\n\nSaitama (SAITAMA) is a decentralized ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain designed to educate Generation Z on crypto investments. It was purposely created to inform users about blockchain technology, thus encouraging them to be part of the digital revolution.\n\nIn other words, Saitama aims to make cryptocurrency adoption easy for all Generation Z members by providing them with a user-friendly experience.\n\nUnlike most platforms, the Saitaima platform offers 100% free services to its users while allowing them to earn passive income through email campaigns, social media, and content creation.\n\nSaitaPro plays a crucial role in the Saitama ecosystem, serving as its main utility. Moreover, its partnership with EpayMe further enhances its value proposition.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, SAITAMA coins in circulation stand at over 38 billion. This is a considerable supply, given that the token started trading in June 2022.\n\nSAITAMA token has a deflationary burning mechanism that helps protect its value and reward long-term holders. In SaitaPro, they have implemented a 1% Burn Tax to ensure sustainable growth. A 1% Buy Back and Burn contribution further strengthens their commitment to supporting worthy projects.\n\nBesides, the SAITAMA coin is planned to be the primary medium of exchange for an upcoming marketplace where people can buy and sell NFTs. When people use SAITAMA coin to buy or sell NFTs on this marketplace, investors will earn a small percentage of the transaction fees.\n\nYou can access the SAITAMA coin through some centralized and decentralized platforms.\n\nHow to Buy SAITAMA on Binance\n\nNow that you know what Saitama is, let\u2019s find out what Binance is and how to buy SAITAMA tokens.\n\nBinance is the biggest crypto exchange platform by market cap. But while it constantly reviews and adds cryptocurrencies that can be traded on its platform, the SAITAMA coin is yet to be listed. However, below is a step-by-step guide to purchasing SAITAMA by linking your digital crypto wallet to a decentralized exchange using your Binance account to buy the base currency, Ethereum.\n\nDownload & Set Up MetaMask\n\nAlthough numerous decentralized, self-custodial, Ethereum-based digital wallets exist, MetaMask is the most trusted. Launched in 2016, MetaMask allows users to safely store, buy, convert, send, and swap crypto tokens. The MetaMask Wallet is a mobile application or browser extension on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Brave, or Opera. To install it on your browser, follow these steps (the browser we will use to illustrate is Brave, but the process is similar on all browsers on which MetaMask is available):\n\n1. Visit the MetaMask website and click the \u201cDownload\u201d button.\n\nWhen accessing the official MetaMask website, on the first page, you will find a \u201cDownload\u201d button that you will have to click. Once pressed, you will be redirected to the Download section on the Chrome Web Store.\n\n2. Add MetaMask to Your Browser.\n\nOnce in the Chrome Web Store, click on the add extension button in the browser and confirm the addition by clicking \u201cAdd Extension.\u201d\n\n3. Create Your MetaMask Wallet or Import an Existing One\n\nAfter clicking the add extension button, you will be redirected to your MetaMask account setup page. If you already have an account, click \u201cImport an existing wallet. If you do not have an account, click the \u201cCreate a new wallet\u201d button.\n\nOf course, to go ahead, you must accept the terms and conditions.\n\nTo set up, you will need to choose a password for your account, secure your wallet by saving your Secret Recovery Phrase in a safe place (beware, losing this code may result in losing assets in your MetaMask wallet), and confirm your Secret Recovery Phrase.\n\n4. Pin Your MetaMask Extension\n\nNow, your MetaMask account is configured and ready to use. You can pin the MetaMask extension near the browser search bar for easier usage. To access your MetaMask wallet, click the Foxface icon on the top right.\n\nBuy Ethereum (ETH)\n\nIn order to convert ETH to SAITAMA, you obviously need to have ETH in your wallet. On MetaMask, you have two options: Either buy ETH directly from the platform or buy from a Crypto Exchange and then transfer it to your wallet.\n\nBuy Ethereum (ETH) Directly on MetaMask\n\nIf you choose the method to buy ETH directly from MetaMask, click on the \u201c+\u201d button and then select the payment processor through which you want to buy ETH. You will have three options: Coinbase Pay, Transak, and MoonPay. MoonPay is the easiest way to buy ETH on MetaMask using a bank card, Apple Pay, or Google Pay.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve decided, select the processor and move on. The process is simple and fast.\n\nBuy Ethereum (ETH) on Binance\n\nAfter creating and downloading the MetaMask wallet, log in to Binance to purchase Ethereum. If you don\u2019t have an account, you must create an account on Binance, confirm it, and follow the entire account validation process. Also, you need to fund your account if you do not have funds in your Binance account.\n\nTo buy Ethereum, click \u201cCash Balance\u201d in the \u201cBuy Crypto\u201d menu.\n\nMake sure you are on the \u201cBuy\u201d menu in the open menu, enter the quantity you want to buy, and complete the transaction. Make sure you are buying ETH and not another currency. Select ETH by clicking on the button next to the Receive row.\n\nThis is not the only way to buy ETH on Binance, but it is one of the handiest.\n\nSend Ethereum from Binance to Your MetaMask Wallet\n\nTo send the Ethereum you bought on Binance to the MetaMask wallet, go to your Binance wallet section and withdraw it by filling in the required information. Set up the network to Ethereum and provide your MetaMask wallet address (copied from account 1) and the amount you want to transfer.\n\nClick \u201cwithdraw.\u201d The transferred Ethereum will appear on your MetaMask wallet.\n\nAttention, be very careful when transferring from Binance to an external wallet. If you get the wrong address, this can result in the permanent loss of your funds.\n\nChoose a DEX\n\nNumerous DEX can integrate with MetaMask wallet, including 1inch Network, VoltSwap, UniSwap, and Biswap, among others. To illustrate, we will continue the process of buying SAITAMA through Uniswap.\n\nConnect Your MetaMask Wallet to the Chosen DEX\n\nConnect your MetaMask wallet to your preferred DEX using your wallet address copied from account 1. Some platforms allow an easier connection. In the example above, the connection takes place instantly after you confirm by pressing the \u201cConnect\u201d button on the UniSwap platform and then pressing MetaMask.\n\nTrade Your ETH for SAITAMA\n\nSelect Ethereum as the payment and SAITAMA as the coin you want to buy and proceed with the transaction. Now, you bought SAITAMA for ETH.\n\nHow to Buy SAITAMA on Coinbase?\n\nCoinbase is one of the best global exchange platforms because it is available in over a hundred countries and has user-friendly features. If you are a beginner in the cryptocurrency world, you would probably use Coinbase. First, opening up an account and linking your wallet takes a few minutes. The platform also offers a step-by-step guide on how to go about the exchange, thus making it the easiest among many others. At the time of writing, SAITAMA can only be purchased on Coinbase in the Coinbase Wallet.\n\nHere is a detailed guide on how to buy SAITAMA on Coinbase:\n\nDownload Coinbase Wallet & Set Up Your Account\n\nCoinbase is a non-custodial digital wallet available as a mobile app (Android & iOS) and browser extension. Coinbase Wallet account creation is similar to MetaMask. To get started, follow these steps:\n\n1. Install the Coinbase wallet extension from the Chrome Web Store\n\n2. Select \u201cCreate new wallet.\u201d\n\n3. Back Up Your 12-word Recovery Phrase\n\nThis phrase is critical in recovering your Coinbase wallet if you forget your password. Therefore, it would be best to store it securely either by writing it down or memorizing it. Avoid storing it in a computer where a second party can easily access it. Confirm that you have saved your backup phrase before proceeding to the next step.\n\n4. Create Your Wallet Password\n\n5. Get Your Free Web3 Username\n\nThe username is what other Coinbase wallet users can use to find you. The platform automatically generates your username if you do not claim it.\n\n6. Fund Your Wallet\n\nThe process of buying Ethereum on Coinbase depends on whether you are using a mobile app or a chrome extension. If you are using the chrome extension, follow these steps:\n\nClick \u2018+\u2019 on the top right side of your screen to add crypto\n\nChoose \u2018Add crypto with Coinbase Pay.\u2019\n\nSign into your Coinbase account to authorize the Coinbase wallet extension.\n\nBuy Ethereum (ETH) on Coinbase\n\nIf you don\u2019t have it, buy Ethereum in Coinbase and transfer it to your Coinbase Wallet.\n\nChoose a DEX\n\nNumerous DEX can integrate with MetaMask wallet, including 1inch Network, VoltSwap, UniSwap, and Biswap, among others.

Now, you bought SAITAMA for ETH.\n\nHow to Buy SAITAMA on SaitaPro\n\nSaitaSwap is advertised as the best-decentralized crypto exchange for Saitama Inu. If you want to purchase SAITAMA on this platform, follow these steps:\n\n1. Install the SaitaPro Wallet App\n\nThe SaitaPro app is freely available for Android and iOS. However, if you have another wallet, such as MetaMask, you can connect it to SaitaSwap and start trading.\n\n2. Buy Ethereum (ETH)\n\nSAITAMA currently has limited trading pairs, so the easiest way to purchase it is to buy ETH first and then exchange it for SAITAMA. However, it would help if you had enough ETH to cover gas fees.\n\n3. Trade ETH for SAITAMA\n\nOnce you have an ETH token in your SaitaPro wallet, you can swap them for SAITAMA by selecting \u201cswap\u201d on the digital assets section and then choosing SAITAMA as the token you want to acquire.\n\nFAQ\n\nI Can\u2019t Find SAITAMA on the DEX. What Can I Do?\n\nIf SAITAMA does not appear on the selected DEX platform, find its smart contract address and copy and paste it on the decentralized exchange.

        "title": "Ether (ETH) is not ready for a new bullish cycle! - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Fri 24 Mar 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nThe two biggest cryptos by market cap have been on a relatively upward trend since the beginning of the year. Several analysts have recently stated that this trend could continue for ether (ETH) \u2013 particularly. Santiment has actually suggested that Ethereum has the potential to climb to more than $2,000, up from around $1,800 currently. But, for analyst Benjamin Cowen, we shouldn\u2019t expect a significant rise in ETH\u2019s price anytime soon.\n\nBenjamin Cowen alerts investors to Ethereum\n\nCowen argues that Ethereum is not ready for a major rally, even though it is currently managing to overcome the turbulence. Instead, the crypto strategist expects a massive correction for the second-biggest crypto by market cap. He submitted that this decline could be seen in the short term. He did not fail to explain the origin of this bearish sentiment. Indeed, the latter was born following the crypto\u2019s unsuccessful efforts to break above a key resistance level. The crypto analyst made his prediction in a new video posted on YouTube on March 21.\n\nBenjamin Cowen said that the key resistance level being discussed is the $1,800 price. \u201cThere\u2019s so much anxiety in this level like I think it\u2019s much more likely to break down eventually\u201d the analyst explained. Cowen added that the level of apathy in the market is currently low. According to him, it is lower than it was during the 2019/2020 bear season.\n\nSpecifically, the analyst said, \u201cI will be the first to admit it\u2019s taking longer than I thought it would. But I also don\u2019t really feel that same type of apathy in the market now that I did back in 2019 and 2020.\u201d He noted that if ETH fell into triple digits, the level of apathy could increase. \u201cI imagine that if it were down here (around $700), the apathy would really set in.\u201d he said.\n\nStrategist at Bloomberg Mike McGlone predicted in December that ether will overtake bitcoin in the next bull run. But, Benjamin Cowen observed that currently, it is bitcoin that is outpacing its larger rival. He noted, \u201cEthereum has been showing a lot of weakness recently and Bitcoin has continued to push up while Ethereum/Bitcoin valuation has been getting very very weak. And unfortunately, this time it doesn\u2019t really have The Merge to sort of generate hype.\u201d\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "A treasure trove of crypto appeared on Thursday in a matter of minutes.\n\nThe long-awaited native cryptocurrency for Arbitrum, the leading scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain, finally became available for more than 600,000 recipients, according to Dune Analytics.\n\nWith over 1 billion ARB tokens airdropped\u2014distributed to select individuals\u2014so far, the total market capitalization for the token has stabilized near $1.8 billion, per data from CoinMarketCap. Developers have planned to create an initial supply of 10 billion tokens\u2014putting the current fully diluted market cap above $14 billion.\n\nAmong the total number of eligible recipients\u2014ARB was made available only to members of the Arbitrum community\u2014more than half have claimed theirs.\n\nThe token\u2019s release, one of the most valuable in recent memory, follows last week\u2019s announcement that Offchain Labs, the developer that created Arbitrum, was establishing the Arbitrum Foundation and an associated DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization.\n\nThe two entities will govern the management and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem, which is composed of two layer-2 blockchains built on top of Ethereum: Arbitrum One, the larger of the two blockchains, and Arbitrum Nova, designed for Web3 games and social media applications. Both blockchains are designed to make transactions on Ethereum faster and less expensive.\n\nThe ARB token will not be used for transaction fees on the blockchains but will allow owners to vote on proposals submitted to Arbitrum\u2019s DAO.\n\n$ARB airdrop claim is at 60%\n\n\n\nI have started buying at $1.29 will be buying over the next 12h\n\n\n\nPlan to sell at $1.8+ (first pump) pic.twitter.com/qarUReG1Rg \u2014 Mac \ud83d\udc3a (@MacnBTC) March 23, 2023\n\nFervor for the token was so high that Arbitrum\u2019s website and blockchain scanner were down ahead of the token\u2019s release, as crypto enthusiasts stampeded to the sites in anticipation.\n\nAs of late Thursday afternoon, ARB\u2019s price was hovering near $1.45. Its current market capitalization puts it ahead of the token for Arbitrum\u2019s closest competitor, Optimism, another layer-2 blockchain that aims to expedite transactions on Ethereum. On Thursday, the market capitalization for OP was around $774 million, after briefly shooting up above $800 million soon after ARB dropped, with a token price of $2.46."

        "title": "With banks sinking, the future of Bitcoin (BTC), RenQ Finance, and Ethereum (ETH) seems brighter than ever - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "As traditional financial institutions face increased scrutiny and declining public trust, many investors are turning to cryptocurrencies as a more reliable and secure store of value.\n\nCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, RenQ Finance, and Ethereum are becoming more attractive to investors. Their decentralized nature, security, and potential for long-term growth make them a strong choice for those looking to diversify their portfolios.\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin is the world\u2019s first and most well-known cryptocurrency, launched in 2009 by an anonymous individual or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Its decentralized nature and built-in scarcity have made it a popular choice for investors looking to diversify their portfolios.\n\nAs traditional banks struggle with issues of inflation, Bitcoin\u2019s limited supply and algorithmically-capped maximum supply of 21 million coins make it a strong alternative store of value. Despite recent volatility in the crypto market, Bitcoin has maintained its position as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ)\n\nRenQ Finance is a decentralized finance platform that uses advanced AI technology to offer users secure and efficient financial services. RenQ Finance is built on a blockchain that enables cross-chain interoperability, making it easy for users to transfer assets between different blockchains.\n\nRenQ Finance has gained significant attention in the crypto market, with its successful presale phase raising over $2.7 million and its potential for further growth. RenQ Finance has the potential to revolutionize the DeFi industry with its innovative approach to cross-chain exchange technology, offering a more effective and affordable method of transferring assets between different blockchains.\n\nAdditionally, Investors have gained more trust in RenQ Finance following its successful CertiK security audit. This has been a significant development for the project, as it assures investors that their investments are secure and that the platform is reliable. The audit found no critical vulnerabilities or issues in RenQ Finance\u2019s smart contracts, demonstrating that the project is built on a strong and secure foundation. This has further strengthened the project\u2019s position in the market and attracted more investors looking for a trustworthy DeFi project.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) using smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing agreements that run on the Ethereum network, allowing developers to create a wide range of decentralized applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to online marketplaces.\n\nEthereum\u2019s popularity has grown significantly in recent years, and it is now the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Its decentralized nature and strong community support make it a reliable and secure choice for investors looking to diversify their portfolios.\n\nBitcoin Vs Ethereum Vs RenQ Finance: What is the difference\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum, and RenQ Finance are all cryptocurrencies, but they have different features, use cases, and technologies behind them.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) was the first and most well-known cryptocurrency. It was created in 2009 as a decentralized digital currency that could be used to make peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks or payment processors. Bitcoin\u2019s main use case is as a store of value and a means of exchange. It has a limited supply, with a maximum of 21 million coins that can be mined, and its mining process is based on the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a decentralized blockchain platform that allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. It was created in 2015 to create a decentralized platform for building decentralized applications. Ethereum\u2019s main use case is as a platform for building dApps and smart contracts. It uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm and has no fixed supply, but instead uses a dynamic issuance model.\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ) is a multi-chain, decentralized exchange that allows for direct trading through the user\u2019s wallet app. It is designed to enhance decentralized trading and support DeFi protocols. RenQ Finance\u2019s main use case is as a decentralized exchange and it uses a Layer 2 scaling solution to reduce transaction costs and increase speed. RenQ Finance has a total supply of 1 billion coins.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the cryptocurrency market can be volatile, these three cryptocurrencies have shown resilience in the face of market fluctuations and are well-positioned for future growth. As the world becomes more digitally focused and decentralized, the future of Bitcoin, RenQ Finance, and Ethereum looks brighter than ever.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

Discover SCENE\n\nThe love story between luxury brands and Web3 continues.\n\nAt this year\u2019s Paris Blockchain Week, LVMH presented the latest developments around its Aura Blockchain Consortium.\n\nFirst launched in 2021, the consortium, which includes Prada Group, OTB Group, and Cartier, focuses on promoting more sustainable trends in the fashion world and helping members upgrade their products\u2019 traceability via blockchain technology.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen you talk about luxury, you are talking about long-term products, repair, and care,\u201d Frank Le Moal, vice-chairman of Aura Blockchain Consortium and LVMH\u2019s CIO, told Decrypt. \u201cDigital passports backed by a blockchain are a way to provide better repair and care services to customers, and to develop a better one-to-one relationship with them.\u201d\n\nOTB Group, which holds famous brands like Diesel, Maison Margiela, Marni, Viktor&Rolf, and Jil Sander, was one of the first entities to join the Consortium.\n\nSource: Aura Blockchain Consortium.\n\nThe CEO of the group\u2019s web3 subsidiary BVX, Stefano Rosso, is convinced that blockchain technology is going to \u201cchange the way we interact, consume, socialize, and communicate,\u201d he told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cFor us, it was fundamental to jump on the boat now. It was the right moment to experiment and join other fellows in this space,\u201d Rosso said. \u201cThe sky is the limit.\u201d\n\nThe Consortium\u2019s real challenge was at some point to convince other luxury brands, most of them competitors, to join the project.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe luxury industry is very competitive, people are fighting most of the time,\u201d said Le Moal. \u201cBut we managed to develop a collaborative concept, involving many brands. We want to offer this as a solution to the world of luxury.\u201d\n\nLuxury brands build in public\n\nMore than a collection of luxury brands, Aura is also a private blockchain built on ConsenSys\u2019 Quorum.\n\nAnd this week, LVMH also rolled out a new feature for its network called the \u201cMulti-Token minter\u201d (MTM).\n\nSource: Aura Blockchain Consortium.\n\nThe MTM lets consortium members build out smart contracts that can be deployed on Aura\u2019s blockchain, but also on any public blockchain, including Ethereum, Solana, or Cosmos.\n\n\u201cWe want to allow every luxury brand to enjoy the possibilities of Web3. We are already more than pleased to have 24 brands on board, 21 of them using NFTs,\u201d Frank Le Moel. \u201cBut with MTM, we feel a strong excitement. Because we know that some brands prefer to go on a public blockchain.\u201d"

        "title": "Why are Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) pumping? Why is it good for projects like RenQ Finance (RENQ)? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are two of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world. In recent weeks, both coins have been experiencing an upward trend. The question on everyone\u2019s minds is, why are these coins pumping?\n\nAccording to the report, which aimed to explain the sudden surge in the values of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the influx of capital from institutional investors has been the driving force behind the price pump. Since February 2023, these investors have injected approximately $1.6 billion into the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin is often referred to as the king of cryptocurrencies, and for good reason. It is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, with a market dominance of over 40%. BTC has seen significant growth in recent years.\n\nThere are several reasons why Bitcoin is currently pumping. One major factor is institutional adoption. Large companies and financial institutions are starting to invest in Bitcoin as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. This has led to a surge in demand for BTC, which in turn drives up its price.\n\nAnother factor contributing to Bitcoin\u2019s rise is the limited supply of cryptocurrency. Only 21 million BTC will ever exist, and with a growing number of people wanting to own it, the supply-demand dynamics come into play, causing the price to increase.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and it is often referred to as the platform for decentralized applications (dApps). ETH has also been experiencing significant growth, with its price increasing steadily over the past few weeks.\n\nOne reason for Ethereum\u2019s recent rise is the growing popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. These applications are built on the Ethereum blockchain, and they allow users to lend, borrow, and trade cryptocurrencies without the need for a centralized intermediary. As DeFi continues to gain traction, demand for ETH will likely increase, driving up its price.\n\nAnother reason for ETH\u2019s rise is the recent launch of Ethereum 2.0. This upgrade to the Ethereum network promises to improve its scalability, security, and energy efficiency, making it more attractive to developers and users. This has led to increased optimism and interest in the platform, which in turn drives up the price of ETH.\n\nWhat is RenQ Finance?\n\nRenQ Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that aims to bring new and innovative financial services to the blockchain ecosystem. It is a community-driven project that provides users with a suite of tools and products that enable them to participate in the emerging DeFi economy. The platform is built on the Ethereum blockchain and supports a wide range of assets, including ERC-20 tokens and popular cryptocurrencies.\n\nRenQ Finance offers a variety of services, including yield farming, liquidity provision, lending and borrowing, and more. The platform\u2019s primary product is the RenQ Vault, which allows users to earn high yields on their crypto assets by automatically investing them in a variety of DeFi protocols.\n\nThe RenQ Finance platform is governed by its community, with proposals and decisions made through a voting process. RenQ token holders can participate in governance and propose changes to the platform. This ensures that the platform is transparent, democratic, and driven by the community.\n\nWhy is it Good for Projects like RenQ Finance (RENQ)?\n\nThe recent price surges of BTC and ETH have had a positive impact on the entire cryptocurrency market. As the two largest cryptocurrencies, they set the tone for the rest of the market. When BTC and ETH are doing well, it typically signals a bullish sentiment in the market, which can lead to increased demand for other cryptocurrencies, including RENQ.\n\nAdditionally, the growing popularity of DeFi applications built on the Ethereum blockchain, such as Uniswap and Aave, has created a demand for interoperability between different blockchain networks. This is where projects like RenQ Finance come in. RenQ Finance is a multi-chain DeFi platform that allows users to access liquidity across different blockchain networks. As the demand for interoperability increases, platforms like RenQ Finance are well-positioned to benefit.\n\nFurthermore, the growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin is a signal of the maturing cryptocurrency market. As more large companies and financial institutions start investing in cryptocurrencies, it brings more legitimacy to the industry and increases the chances of regulatory clarity. This can lead to a more stable and predictable market, which is good for all projects in the long run, including RenQ Finance.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "ARB buyers on Uniswap might be at risk of losing funds to fake ARB.\n\nUNI might be headed for some more upside as whale demand picks.\n\nThough Arbitrum [ARB] has finally been AirDropped successfully, the initial hype has already led to some risk for Uniswap [UNI] users. A fake ETH/ARB pool has already been created, and was out to get unsuspecting users.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Uniswap Profit Calculator\n\nInitial reports revealed that the fake ETH/ARB had over 95 million fake ARB and over 400 WETH on Uniswap V3 at press time. The pool ranked on top, making the situation worse as far as risk exposure was concerned. Uniswap users trying to access ARB can avoid this scam by confirming the official contract addresses for ARB through the Arbitrum foundation\u2019s official documents.\n\nWhen searching for ARB directly on Uniswap, the fake ETH/ARB Pool is at the top. 0x64\u20269545 added a fake ETH/ARB Pool consisting of 400 WETH and more than 95 million fake ARBs on Arbitrum Uniswap V3. Users need to pay attention. H/T @levels_crypto \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 23, 2023\n\nThe risk is only on the ETH/ARB pool, as far as initial reports are concerned. The scam incident was limited to the aforementioned pool; hence it would not affect all Uniswap users. On the plus side of things, Uniswap joined the list of the top 10 tokens by trading volume among the 500 largest Ethereum [ETH] whales.\n\nThe high trading volume by ETH whales was a sign of bullish or bearish activity, thus the need to explore further. Some of Uniswap\u2019s metrics may offer some clarity regarding direction. For example, the age consumed metric registered significant activity in the last two days. Meanwhile, UNI\u2019s MVRV ratio achieved a sizable pivot in favor of the upside.\n\nUNI exhibits readiness for a bullish move\n\nThe pivot confirmed that the bulls were overwhelmingly dominant during the last two days. UNI\u2019s exchange flows revealed that there were higher exchange outflows than inflows. The same point was particularly evident by the large spike in exchange outflows in the last 24 hours at press time.\n\nUNI\u2019s price action reflected the above observations. It exchanged hands at $6.19 at the time of writing, after some upside in the last 24 hours. This may contradict the expectations of a strong bullish performance based on the metrics\u2019 observations.\n\nHow many are 1,10,100 UNIs worth today?\n\nA closer look at UNI\u2019s price action revealed that the buying pressure highlighted in the metrics cut short a previous bearish trend. UNI tanked by 11% from its peak on 19 March to its mid-week low.\n\nUNI\u2019s chart alone highlighted multiple signs that may have forecasted the current pivot. For example, the bearish performance in the first half of the week resulted in an interaction with the 200-day moving average. The price has also been hovering within the 50% RSI level, where a pivot is likely to happen. A larger upside might be on the cards if the whales continued buying."

        "content": "The early March collapse of three significant cryptocurrency banks, Signature, Silicon Valley Bank, and Silvergate, which had a significant amount of exposure to cryptocurrencies, shocked the economic sectors. These financial institutions were explicitly labeled as adaptable hubs where cryptocurrency investors could store their funds. Fortunately, this week saw the two largest cryptocurrencies\u2019 prices turn lushly green.\n\nExperts opine that the failure of these banks will probably have a temporary effect on the cryptocurrency market.

Following the announcement that the Federal Reserve, U.S. Treasury, and FDIC would step in to counterbalance all reserves at SVB and Signature banks, the cryptocurrency market popped to a roar starting last weekend night.\n\nPrices were pushed up by the excessive use of the Ethereum network by cryptocurrency holders trying to exchange their USDC, which had unreachable access to $3.3 billion in SVB, for other stablecoins. Nearly every one of the top thirty cryptocurrencies saw price progress. Along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, Filecoin (FIL), Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), and BNB were some of the biggest gainers. Therefore, as the market prepares for the Bull Run, the Big Eyes coin has caught the attention of cryptocurrency analysts due to its potential for future growth.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum Surge Post-Banking Crisis\n\nAccording to a Reuters report, the market for digital assets has become more well-liked as a result of the traditional banking sector\u2019s increasing instability. This trend started with Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s failure and has so far culminated in UBS\u2019 acquisition of Credit Suisse at a discount over the weekend.\n\nThe data from Coin Market Cap indicates that the price of Bitcoin has risen 36% over the last ten days and is currently trading at $27,781. The industry-services financial institution\u2019s failure caused BTC to lose about 10% of its value. The live market cap of BTC is $533,605,171,708.\n\nEthereum, the second-ranked coin in the market, has returned to its pre-recession level. ETH has increased 27% over the past seven days and is currently trading at $1,832. It has a circulating supply of 122,373,866 ETH coins with a live market cap of $212,506,040,339.\n\nBig Eyes Going Big\n\nSince its initial presale, Big Eyes Coin, a cryptocurrency with a cat-themed meme, has gotten a lot of backing from crypto analysts. Investors looking for promising investment opportunities are paying attention to the coin due to its astounding presale numbers and cutting-edge features it provides. The entire project offers one-of-a-kind use cases to entice investors. Big Eyes Coin offers 80% of its tokens through a public presale. Big Eyes Coins has made its mark in the cryptocurrency world by raising more than $31 million in just 12 stages of its presale phase. With a 5% split going to the charity wallet, the remaining portion of the funding will be split into one-fourth for marketing and three-quarter for locking in a liquidity pool for two years.\n\nBig Eyes, developed on the Ethereum Network, uses the Proof-of-Stake consensus method to validate transactions. Big Eyes seeks to utilize this protocol to do away with the need for energy-intensive cryptographic mining, which lowers carbon emissions. Additionally, Big Eyes Coin will enable users to scalable, quick, and secure processes. The platform\u2019s availability of smart contract options makes it even more appealing to investors and cryptocurrency users. Big Eyes Coin has developed an ICO that enables investors to join the cat community and take part in the decision-making process. 90% of Big Eyes Coin will be available at launch, which is a great reason for cryptocurrency enthusiasts to invest in it.\n\n250% ROI with BULLRUN\n\nThe token price is still significantly below market price at stage 12 of the presale, allowing for a respectable profit once the project launches. During the 12th stage of its presale phase, Big Eyes Coin is issuing the bonus code BULLRUN250. This entitles the token purchasers to a return of 250% of their investment in $BIG. For instance, if a user spends $100, he will receive $250 worth of BIG rewards.\n\nBig Eyes Coin ones are here:\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"
