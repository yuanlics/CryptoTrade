        "content": "Bitcoin block space looks set to be the hottest commodity in crypto.\n\nBitcoin once again occupies more than half the entire crypto market, having outperformed ether by nearly double so far in 2023. Now, the long-prophesied \u201cflippening\u201d of ether over bitcoin is even further in the future.\n\nThe market currently values Bitcoin three times higher than Ethereum. Bitcoin\u2019s market cap, at $727 billion, has swelled by $400 billion in 2023 \u2014 a figure bigger than Mastercard\u2019s entire stock valuation and about twice that of Netflix\u2019s.\n\nEthereum\u2019s valuation has grown by $100 billion, jumping from under $145 billion in January to nearly $245 billion today.\n\nSome anticipate that Ethereum\u2019s market cap will one day eclipse Bitcoin\u2019s, despite the latter\u2019s half-decade head start.\n\nThings were looking good coming out of the 2019 bear market and into 2021\u2019s explosive bull cycle. DeFi summer and NFT mania boosted interest in Ethereum, at times driving up fees for certain actions beyond $250.\n\nBitcoin\u2018s market value was 925% of Ethereum\u2019s \u2014 $130 billion to $14 billion \u2014 at the end of 2019 (bottom of the bear market).\n\nThat figure had shrunk to under 200% by the end of 2021 (peak bull market).\n\nBitcoin\u2019s market value is now 300% of Ethereum\u2019s.\n\nThe Bitcoin rally has widened the gap\n\nThe case for flippening has recently taken a hit by a different flip: The Bitcoin network now rakes in more fees than Ethereum for the first time since December 2020.\n\nOver the past four days, Bitcoin users have paid miners about $40 million to have their transactions processed.\n\nEthereum users, meanwhile, forked out less than $27 million ether (most of those fees have been burned, slightly reducing Ethereum\u2019s overall supply).\n\nLayer-2 Ethereum networks Arbitrum and Optimism haven\u2019t bridged that gap as they each generate less than $200,000 in fees per day right now.\n\nThe fee-flippening (flee-pening?) is awkward when you consider the sheer amount of use cases supported by Ethereum. Decentralized exchanges, DAOs, memecoins, NFTs, stablecoins, DeFi and GameFi all run atop Ethereum.\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s Justin Drake is unconcerned despite ether\u2019s middling year pricewise: Q&A\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, had for the longest time mostly had one application \u2014 bitcoin transactions. But the rate of on-chain transactions had until recently sustained very little growth since 2015. Perhaps due to its \u201cdigital gold\u201d narrative and the rising ubiquity of alternative cryptocurrencies.\n\nOver the past five years, Ethereum users have paid $17 billion in fees, Bitcoin users just $2.9 billion\n\nAll that changed with Ordinals \u2014 a protocol for inscribing individual units of bitcoin (BTC) with unique data to create digital collectibles, first launched in January.\n\nMusic, text, art, video and even code for browser-based DOOM clones have since been inscribed to Bitcoin, resulting in an on-chain collectibles market worth thousands of BTC. Bitcoin users trade Ordinals as Ethereum or Solana users would trade NFTs.\n\nToday, anywhere from around a third to one half of Bitcoin transactions contain Ordinals, driving up demand for blockspace as well as transaction fees. At times today, \u201cmedium priority\u201d transactions went for around $11 compared to around $2.30 for the same on Ethereum (more priority generally means faster processing), although those prices have since come down.\n\nTron comes in third overall for monthly fees, mostly thanks to stablecoin Tether\n\nSo is Bitcoin netting more fees than Ethereum good for Bitcoin? Maybe not.\n\nSome Bitcoin insiders worry the network isn\u2019t properly equipped to handle Ordinals and potential influxes of interest in its original use case, BTC payments.\n\nThe CryptoKitties incident in December 2017 \u2014 during which a NFT game grew so popular that it spectacularly clogged Ethereum \u2014 first showed that Ethereum probably couldn\u2019t handle serving as the \u201cWorld Computer\u201d just yet.\n\nThen, the 2021 bull market saw NFT mint costs soar to $250 at times \u2014 a reminder of how necessary it was to port activity to smaller chains, including rollups. Still, memecoins and low quality token projects ratcheted up fees beyond $20 earlier this year, drastically reducing Ethereum\u2019s usefulness for non-critical tasks.\n\nThe NFT craze of 2021 made Ethereum block space the hottest commodity in crypto. Even while tanking its utility.\n\nOrdinals may end up having the same effect on Bitcoin, especially if demand keeps up and the bull market truly hits.\n\nAt that point, it would seem reasonable to value Bitcoin and Ethereum more similarly. It might just take another run.\n\nUpdated Nov. 16, 2023 at 4:25 pm ET: Corrected reference to percentages in bullet points.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Bitcoin Overtakes Ethereum in Transaction Fees on the Back of Renewed Ordinals Frenzy\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has recently surpassed Ethereum (ETH) in terms of average daily transaction fees, signaling a notable shift in the fee landscape. On November 20, Bitcoin's average daily transaction fee reached $10.34, while Ethereum's average fee stood at $8.43.\n\nThe upswing in Bitcoin transaction fees is a result of heightened activity surrounding the Ordinals Protocol, which enables the creation of NFT-like assets and BRC-20 tokens on the Bitcoin network. After a period of relative dormancy in late September to October, Ordinals-based assets experienced a significant surge in late October, according to Dune Analytics.\n\nSince October 24, over 6 million Ordinal assets have been generated, leading to the redistribution of more than 800 BTC in fees (equivalent to $30 million) to the network. The momentum further escalated when ORDI, the second-largest BRC-20 token by market capitalization, was listed on Binance on November 7. This listing sparked increased buying activity of BRC-20 tokens, resulting in a price surge of slightly over 50% for the ORDI token.\n\nIn addition to the growing popularity of the Ordinals Protocol, the Taproot Wizards project, which is built on the Ordinals protocol, announced a seed funding round of $7.5 million on November 17.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "Ethereum Continues to Roll, Holding Above $2,000 This Weekend - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Among the most-watched cryptocurrencies in the market, Ethereum's (ETH 2.51%) rise and fall over any given time period can influence the whole market. It's the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization, so its price swings over a given time frame have an outsized impact on the market overall.\n\nFor this reason, Ethereum's increase over this past weekend has stoked surging interest in the crypto sector. Ether has surged 5% since 4 p.m. ET on Friday (as of 12:30 p.m. ET today), holding steady above the key psychological level of $2,000 per token.\n\nGeopolitical concerns, which are driving uncertainty in the markets, in combination with a falling U.S. dollar have some investors looking to alternative assets such as crypto to safeguard their wealth. Unsurprisingly, Ethereum remains a top option for investors looking to combat currency-related risks from a ballooning U.S. budget deficit.\n\nAdditionally, recent reports indicate that Ethereum's circulating supply is at record lows. The circulating supply of a given token is the percentage of overall tokens available that actually circulate in the ecosystem. This could indicate that investors are viewing Ethereum more as an asset to hold in cold storage (offline) than a token to be traded, highlighting Ethereum's potential as a store of value.\n\nWhat does all this mean?\n\nInvestors have a myriad of concerns to contend with in this market. Heightened geopolitical risks as a result of the recent Israel-Palestine conflict, in addition to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, have stoked more defensive positioning from many institutional investors. Accordingly, for portfolio managers looking to spread out their alternative asset holdings across various asset classes such as crypto, Ethereum is going to hold some allure in this respect.\n\nIt's also worth thinking about Ethereum and other megacap cryptocurrencies as a perceived store of value. We haven't really seen how Ethereum has held up during a market crash, as it wasn't invented until after the global financial crisis (and most investors won't call the pandemic a true long-lived recession). With the actual circulating supply of Ethereum near all-time lows, any sort of material demand for these tokens could reasonably spark a further run-up in price.\n\nWhere to go from here\n\nOf course, when an asset like Ethereum (worth nearly $250 billion at the time of this writing) is less liquid than it's been historically, this low liquidity environment can also work in reverse. If we get some sort of bear market dynamic building, it's possible we could see Ethereum give up its recent gains as it has during previous cycles in 2022.\n\nThat said, the strength in crypto markets this year has been notable. As with other risk assets, investors appear to be looking through whatever pain could be on the horizon. And given the added value Ethereum holds as a perceived store of value, it's very possible this strong momentum can continue into 2024."

        "content": "ETH whales are slowly accumulating.\n\nThe altcoin can be said to be undervalued.\n\nAddresses holding 10,000 Ethereum [ETH] tokens, and more have started topping up the amount of ETH held in the portfolio, AMBCrypto\u2019s assessment of Glassnode\u2019s data revealed. As of the 9th of November, 1064 addresses held 10,000 ETH or more.\n\nBut at the time of writing, the count had increased. Although the rate at which the number is climbing seemed slow, it affected ETH\u2019s price. At press time, ETH changed hands at $2,036. This value amounted to a 4.46% increase in the last 24 hours.\n\nBuying is not yet for retail\n\nRecently, there have been complaints from market players about ETH\u2019s slow movement compared to other altcoins. So, the whale accumulation, alongside the increase in price, may have brought some sort of relief to ETH retail holders.\n\nShould the large accumulation continue, then ETH might stabilize above $2,000. In a case where the accumulation becomes rapid, the altcoin might be able to reclaim $2,100. But is this cohort following the same path as the whales?\n\nOn evaluating the balance of addresses in the 1-100 Ethereum cohort, AMBCrypto found out that a large part had refrained from accumulating. A situation of this sort implies that retail Ethereum holders are not bullish on the short-term price action.\n\nFurthermore, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-score had risen to 0.40. This metric is a function of the difference between the market cap and the realized cap. It is also responsible for indicating if a cryptocurrency is undervalued or overvalued compared to its fair value.\n\nWhen the MVRV Z-Score is above seven, it means that investors have made a lot of profit. When the metric is below zero, it indicates that the market is bleeding. Therefore, ETH\u2019s press time MVRV ratio showed that the altcoin is close to being undervalued.\n\nLittle by little, ETH moves\n\nSo, long-term ETH holders have the opportunity to become profitable, as long as the cryptocurrency remains in their portfolio. For the short term, one metric that could be valuable to evaluate is the Seller Exhaustion Constant.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nUsing the 30-day price volatility, the Seller Exhaustion Constant detects if a cryptocurrency has the potential to create high losses or otherwise. At the time of writing, the metric was 0.055. A close look at the chart below showed that it had exited the danger zone (red) at the time of writing.\n\nTherefore, ETH\u2019s price at $2,000 could be considered healthy for buying. Also, the altcoin may resist a significant plunge in as much as the Seller Exhaustion Constant does not fall to the reading it was around the first few weeks in October."

        "title": "Exploring Ethereum: a comprehensive look at ETH and its ecosystem - OKX",
        "content": "Have you ever wondered what Ethereum is and how it's different from other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin?\n\nEthereum is a decentralized network of computers worldwide that follows a set of rules known as the Ethereum protocol. This network serves as a platform for creating and using applications, communities, organizations, and digital assets, allowing anyone to do so without relying on a centralized power. Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), pays for network activities, including the computation necessary to build and run decentralized apps (DApps) and organizations on Ethereum.\n\nThat's only scratching the surface about Ethereum, and in this article, we take a close look at the ecosystem, its native token, and how Ethereum is impacting the future of decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nTL;DR\n\nEthereum is a decentralized platform that allows smart contracts and DApps with its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), used for transactions.\n\nETH, launched in 2015, is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and is essential for Ethereum network operations.\n\nEthereum's smart contracts are self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code, facilitating automated, secure, and efficient transactions and applications without intermediaries.\n\nThe Merge has caused Ethereum to move to a proof-of-stake (PoS) system, which has significantly affected ETH issuance and energy consumption. This shift has had a massive impact on the network's sustainability and ETH's economic model.\n\nDespite challenges like competition from other blockchains, scalability issues, high transaction fees, regulatory risks, and security threats, Ethereum's future looks bright. This is due to numerous technological enhancements and advances in token standards.\n\nWhat's Ethereum and how does it differ from Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are fundamental cryptocurrencies that have helped accelerate the transformation of blockchain. However, the technologies are significantly different in their aim and operation. Ethereum uses blockchain technology, similar to Bitcoin, but also serves as a platform for DApps by applying smart contracts. These contracts are programmed to execute the conditions of an agreement automatically \u2014 an action that's directly included in the code.\n\nBitcoin, meanwhile, was created as a decentralized alternative to fiat currency. It aims to be a store of value and a medium of exchange. Blockchain technology creates a decentralized accounting ledger for Bitcoin transactions, removing the need for a single authoritative body.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum's blockchain is built to do even more. Through this platform, developers can build and launch various applications. This can be anything from video games to intricate financial systems. Ether, the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, is used to execute and manage transactions within this environment.\n\nAs a result, Ethereum has become a base for thousands of crypto token projects, each using the technology to power their own DApps.\n\nWhat ultimately separates Ethereum from Bitcoin is its technical basis. Ethereum has a faster block time than Bitcoin, meaning it can process transactions in less time. This is necessary for applications that demand rapid transaction speeds.\n\nFor many, the comparison between Ethereum and Bitcoin is rooted in the distinction between their respective capabilities. Where Bitcoin is mainly a medium of exchange, Ethereum is more of a development platform with added features like smart contracts. This has resulted in a significant market cap for cryptocurrencies operating on decentralized blockchain technology.\n\nWhat is ETH?\n\nIn 2015, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin created ETH, which has since become the second-largest cryptocurrency in market value behind Bitcoin. Unlike conventional currencies, ETH isn't regulated by any governing body. The token is a tradable asset class on multiple crypto exchanges.\n\nETH stands out in the crypto space because it's not just a medium of exchange or a store of value. ETH is used to run operations on the Ethereum network, such as executing smart contracts and DApps. To perform these processes, users must pay a fee in Ether, often called \"gas,\" given to miners to incentivize them to validate transactions on the blockchain.\n\nETH plays an essential part in the maturing DeFi environment, which aims to reproduce and modernize traditional financial services such as borrowing, lending, and trading without intermediaries. ETH is widely employed as collateral, a form of currency, and a unit of account in various economic protocols in DeFi.\n\nTraders and users hold ETH for various reasons: some \"hodl\" it long term, speculating on the growth of the Ethereum network and the broader adoption of blockchain technology. Others use it more actively for trading and accessing the network's capabilities.\n\nTo sum up, ETH is an essential component of the Ethereum network and the basis of the DeFi space.\n\nHow do Ethereum's smart contracts work?\n\nEthereum is renowned for its smart contracts. These contracts don't follow conventional guidelines. Instead, their terms are encoded into computer code. Smart contracts are located on the Ethereum blockchain, an open system that guarantees the underlying action or agreement will be carried out without disruption, control, deception, or outside influence.\n\nSmart contract functionality\n\nImagine a smart contract as a vending machine. When you choose a product (a digital deal or contract), you pay the necessary amount of ETH and the machine (the smart agreement) will instantly execute the deal in line with the encoded requirements. This system removes the need for intermediaries such as lawyers or brokers, which minimizes expenses and boosts effectiveness.\n\nThe power of automation in blockchain\n\nWhen the set parameters are fulfilled, smart contracts can autonomously enforce and complete the obligations of a deal. This way, these contracts can automate the administrative and transactional processes. This capability is game-changing in areas like finance, real estate, and legal operations, where complex agreements are common.\n\nDApps and beyond\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain serves as the base for various DApps. These applications are hosted on a peer-to-peer network instead of a single computer. The advantages of using DApps built on Ethereum are bolstered by blockchain technology's security, reliability, and transparency. From DeFi to NFTs, the range of applications is rapidly increasing.\n\nEthereum's smart contracts provide a reliable, clear, and efficient approach to supporting digital purchases and arrangements, creating change that could influence many industries positively.\n\nWhat are the real-world applications of Ethereum?\n\nEthereum's most notable use is in DeFi, which encompasses smart contract-powered loans and other financial activities. Ethereum stands out because of its decentralization, transparency, automation, and immutability, making it suitable for many different applications across various industries.\n\nBanking, crowdfunding, and web hosting are just some of the ways Ethereum has changed how people transact and interact. For example, Ethereum offers new ways of processing loans, borrowing, and trading digital assets.\n\nSmart contracts on Ethereum can be used to set up trustless and secure crowdfunding initiatives. At the same time, prediction markets employ the technology to create decentralized platforms for forecasting the results of events. Ethereum has also been used to create decentralized web services, spotlighting its influence in multiple domains.\n\nEthereum's blockchain technology supports various real-world applications across different industries, and several companies are actively leveraging its capabilities:\n\nTake-Two: In August 2023, the publisher behind the Grand Theft Auto gaming franchise announced the development of Sugartown, a Web3 game built on Ethereum. Sugartown's plot follows three agricultural animals that, by chance, open a wormhole from another world to Sugartown, allowing odd creatures known as Ora\u2019s to enter the city. Using their inventiveness, the Ora\u2019s turn Sugartown into a lively destination that offers enjoyable activities and amusements.\n\nING : The Dutch bank has been involved in multiple Ethereum-based projects. One example is Komgo, which aims to optimize trading documents. ING is also a part of Fnality, a payments settlement consortium, and has been working on Bamboo, a bilateral letter of credit.\n\nTD Ameritrade: As a brokerage firm, TD Ameritrade has embraced Ethereum by supporting ErisX, a CFTC-regulated spot exchange that leverages Ethereum smart contracts. What's more, the firm allows customers to trade Ethereum futures through the platform.\n\nThe above examples show how Ethereum's blockchain can enable secure, open, and effective trading of digital assets, the production of NFTs, and underpin a variety of financial activities.\n\nHow does Ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake affect ETH?\n\nEthereum's shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), known as \"The Merge,\" has had a profound impact on the issuance and economics of ETH:\n\nPre-merge issuance:\n\nMiners issued ~13,000 ETH/day under PoW.\n\nAnnual inflation rate was approximately 4.61%.\n\nPost-merge issuance:\n\nIssuance reduced to validators issuing ~1,700 ETH/day under PoS.\n\nAnnual inflation rate now approximately 0.52%.\n\nTotal new ETH issuance down by ~88%.\n\nSustainability:\n\nThe Merge eliminated energy-intensive mining activities.\n\nValidators require a smaller reward, contributing to lower issuance.\n\nETH burning:\n\nTransactions require a base fee that gets burned, removing ETH from circulation.\n\nOn days of high network demand, the burning can offset the daily ETH issuance, potentially leading to deflation.\n\nValidator economics:\n\nValidators are incentivized to withdraw rewards over 32 ETH.\n\nWithdrawal limits are in place to maintain network stability.\n\nThe switch to PoS has significantly cut ETH's inflation rate and enhanced the blockchain's sustainability. The supply and demand for ETH is now affected by less issuance and the burning of transaction fees, which may sometimes result in net-zero inflation or deflation.\n\nWhat are the risks and challenges facing Ethereum and ETH?\n\nMany believe the risks and challenges that could affect Ethereum and ETH center on issues with functionality and value.\n\nCompetition from other blockchains\n\nNetworks like Solana and Cardano, which offer faster and cheaper transactions, are emerging as competitors that could potentially erode Ethereum's market share. However, one positive from increased competitive pressure is the potential for fresh innovation.\n\nScalability and storage\n\nAs Ethereum's blockchain increases, it's faced with scalability issues. The need for large storage capacity is growing faster than for Bitcoin. If this need is not managed effectively, it could result in the network exceeding the available resources which could cause problems with performance.\n\nHigh transaction fees\n\nEthereum's network can be too costly for transactions with little monetary value due to high fees. This could restrict its use to only those transactions with higher values, potentially impeding its day-to-day utility.\n\nRegulatory risks\n\nRegulations surrounding the DeFi and NFT segments running on Ethereum could change. If these segments are prohibited or limited in their use of Ethereum, it could diminish demand for transactions on the network.\n\nSecurity threats\n\nEthereum's layered architecture is susceptible to a variety of attacks:\n\nReplay attacks : hackers can copy and use transaction details again if crucial factors such as timestamps and nonces aren't handled correctly.\n\nFalse top-up attacks : errors in the confirmation process of tokens traded on platforms can result in the theft of possessions.\n\nHoneypot attacks : scam contracts that trick users into thinking they can steal ETH when in fact they lose it.\n\nShort URL attacks : bad input validation in exchanges can make transfer amounts look bigger than they are.\n\nAirdrop hunting attacks : these attacks involve the exploitation of airdrop functions to accumulate wealth illicitly.\n\nArbitrary storage writing attacks : the potential for attackers to change the data stored in smart contracts.\n\nGas exhaustion denial of service attacks: agreements that use up all the gas in a block, leaving no room for processing other transactions.\n\nWhat's the future outlook for Ethereum and ETH?\n\nA combination of market analysis, recent technological developments, and new innovations in token standards are shaping the future outlook for Ethereum and ETH.\n\nMarket analysis\n\nEthereum's price is predicted to hover between $1,800 and $1,900 throughout 2023, with resistance at $1,760 and potential dips to $1,600. The average trading price is expected to be around $1,880.75, and some analysts predict returns of around 5%. An ascending triangle technical trading setup indicates a bullish trend, suggesting Ethereum's rally could continue.\n\nBy November 2023, forecasts anticipate a value increase of 4.3%, reaching approximately $2,038.14. The market sentiment at November 2023 was neutral to bullish, with the Fear & Greed Index indicating a state of \"Greed.\"\n\nTechnological developments\n\nEthereum's transition from PoW to PoS with The Merge has reduced its energy consumption and improved security. Further upgrades, such as Danksharding, are expected to enhance Ethereum's scalability, speed, and efficiency, potentially strengthening its position in the crypto space.\n\nWith these technological advancements and a robust developer community, Ethereum is expected to sustain its growth and success.\n\nInnovation in token standards\n\nA notable innovation in 2023 is the introduction of ERC-6551 Token Bound Accounts (TBA). This new Ethereum token standard significantly expands the functionality of NFTs, enabling them to act as their own smart contract accounts.\n\nThis overcomes the limitations of the previous ERC-721 standard by allowing for seamless interactions and improving the real-world usability of digital assets.\n\nEthscriptions\n\nEthscriptions are a new innovation on the Ethereum blockchain. They offer a way to share data \u2014 currently only images \u2014 without the need to create ERC-721 tokens. They differ from NFTs in their use of calldata for storage, lower creation and transfer costs, and their native hosting on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nEthereum Follow Protocol (EFP)\n\nBrantly Millegan proposed the EFP in spring 2023. The protocol allows users to follow each other natively on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe vision is to build an essential social graph structure that's focused on Ethereum and can be incorporated with pre-existing platforms like the Ethereum Name Service (ENS).\n\nEthereum's future looks encouraging, bolstered by positive market movements, regular upgrades to its technology, and the emergence of new token standards that should help improve the platform's usefulness and features.\n\nBecause of this, Ethereum has the potential to keep growing and become an even more significant player in the world of digital currencies. As with all projects and tokens, it's wise to continue researching and following updates to Ethereum to stay up to speed with its developments.\n\nThe final word\n\nEthereum stands out as an influential platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts, powered by Ether (ETH).\n\nThe shift from PoW to PoS with the arrival of The Merge demonstrates Ethereum's dedication to progress and sustainability. This is seen in the network's growing scope of uses beyond transactions, paving the way for further DeFi innovation. Despite certain obstacles, such as scalability issues and rival protocols, Ethereum continues to push forward and find new users.\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve with new technological advancements, its impact on the digital and financial landscape is poised to grow. What future do you envision for Ethereum in this rapidly changing ecosystem?"

        "title": "Ethereum Exchange Supply Drops To 5-Year Lows, What This Means For Price - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum recently cleared the $2,000 price level again in the past 24 hours, as filings of Spot Ethereum ETFs in the US start to pile up. New on-chain data has shown a clearer sentiment among ETH investors, and it looks like many are getting ready for the long haul.\n\nData shows that the amount of Ethereum held on exchanges has dropped since the middle of last week to the lowest levels since 2018. That means fewer people are selling their Ethereum, and more are holding onto it or staking it.\n\nEthereum Exchange Supply Plummeting\n\nAlthough Ethereum is still down by 2.57% in the past seven days, the cryptocurrency is now trading above $2,000 after breaking the barrier on Monday, November 21. The recent surge would be the third time Ethereum crossed over the price level this month, as it\u2019s still looking to maintain a sustained price increase.\n\nThe recent spikes can be attributed to applications of Ethereum Spot ETFs piling up in front of the US SEC. BlackRock, in particular, joined the spot Ethereum ETF race on November 15th, igniting a price spike that pushed ETH past the $2,000 mark for the second time this month.\n\nIt would appear that investors reacted to BlackRock\u2019s ETH filing with the same sentiment they had in response to the investment company\u2019s spot Bitcoin filing. CryptoQuant\u2019s Exchange Reserves metric indicates that investor sentiment started to change around this period, as investors started to pull their assets off of exchanges into cold storage immediately after the news.\n\nAccording to the metric, the number of ETH deposited across crypto exchanges amounted to 14.5 million as of November 15. However, this figure dropped by 152,583 ETH in the days after to reach 14.3 million on November 20th.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nIntoTheBlock\u2019s exchange netflow reveals a similar sentiment. The netflow calculates the number of tokens entering exchanges minus tokens leaving exchanges. According to the metric, exchanges have had around 228,450 ETH more in outflows than inflows since November 15.\n\nSource: IntoTheBlock\n\nWhat To Expect For ETH Price Action In The Coming Months\n\nDropping exchange reserves reduces the amount of ETH available for trading, thereby increasing scarcity. The data from both Cryptoquant and IntoTheBlock indicates Ethereum might be gearing up for a price spike fueled by increasing scarcity.\n\nEthereum is trading at $2,013 at the time of writing. We\u2019ve already seen the crypto increase by 67% from $1,200 at the beginning of the year, and many analysts expect this trend to continue if supply tightens. According to crypto analyst Tony The Bull, Ethereum could cross $10,000 very soon if a bullish scenario plays out.\n\nETH price holds $2,000 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Exame, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "What to expect from Bitcoin and Ethereum as the bull rally ends - AMBCrypto English",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s transaction volume has started to decline in the recent past.\n\nEthereum was down by over 4%, and the meme coins were following a similar trend.\n\nThe entire crypto market, including top coins like Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH], enjoyed a comfortable rally during the last few weeks. Most cryptos managed to register promising gains, allowing the capitalization of the overall crypto market to rise.\n\nUnfortunately, like all good things, this bull rally came to an end as well. Therefore, let\u2019s take a look at the crypto market\u2019s condition to see what the future holds as we enter the end of 2023.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s performance looks robust\n\nAt the time of writing, the crypto market cap stood at $1.4 trillion. However, Santiment recently posted an analysis pointing out that the comfortable bull rally came to an end somewhere around the 12th of November.\n\n\ud83d\udcca #Crypto market caps have temporarily run out of steam after the huge 4-week rallies. In our mid-month November market report, we take a look at #Bitcoin's supply moving off exchanges, and how the crowd will impact prices the rest of the year: https://t.co/jhUT3OPulx pic.twitter.com/Pd46PH2Npj \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 18, 2023\n\nSantiment\u2019s latest report also highlighted how the king coin performed during the bull rally. To begin with, BTC\u2019s price surged by nearly 30% last month.\n\nAs per Santiment\u2019s report, over the last 30 days, key wallets holding between 10 \u2013 10k BTC shed 50,882 bitcoins. Interestingly, after a comfortable rise in transaction volume, the metric started to decline at a time when BTC\u2019s value continued to rise.\n\nLike transfer volume, Bitcoin\u2019s MVRV ratio also increased over the past few weeks. Santiment\u2019s report mentioned that the average trading returns for 365 days were still at +32%, implying that they may need to even out too close to 0% before another takeoff can happen.\n\nNonetheless, the fact that the dormant token movement has been quite active in the first part of November is encouraging.\n\nThis can be expected from Bitcoin\n\nLike Santiment\u2019s report, AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis also found that the possibility of Bitcoin\u2019s price action slowing down was high. As per CoinMarketCap, BTC was already down by more than 15 in the last seven days.\n\nAt the time of writing, it was trading at $36,656.75 with a market cap of over $716 billion.\n\nIts trading volume also plummeted by 40%, suggesting a lower willingness of investors to trade the coin. BTC\u2019s fear and greed index had a value of 69, meaning that the market was in a \u2018greed\u2019 position at press time. When this happens, it brings about the possibility of a price drop.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of BTC\u2019s daily chart pointed out that the MACD displayed a bearish crossover. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also registered a downtick over the past few days.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Bollinger Bands suggested that the coin\u2019s price entered a less volatile zone, minimizing the chances of an unprecedented surge. Nonetheless, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) rested above the neutral mark of zero \u2014 a hopeful sign.\n\nAltcoins also rallied substantially\n\nEthereum was not left out of last month\u2019s rally. As per CoinMarketCap\u2019s data, ETH\u2019s price went up by more than 25% in the last 24 hours, allowing it to go above the $2,000 mark.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data revealed that ETH\u2019s trading volume spiked each time its price went up. A positive signal for Ethereum was that its transaction count remained consistently up. When the token\u2019s price crossed $2,000, its MVRV ratio also peaked.\n\nHowever, like BTC, ETH\u2019s bull run also shows signs of ending, as its price dropped by more than 4% in just the last seven days. At the time of writing, it was trading at $1,959.51 with a market cap of over $235 billion.\n\nWhen AMBCrypto checked CryptoQuant\u2019s data, it was revealed that selling sentiment in the market was dominant.\n\nBoth Ethereum\u2019s Korea Premium and Funds Premium were red, meaning that Korean retail investors and investors in funds and trusts, including Grayscale, have relatively weak buying sentiment.\n\nEthereum\u2019s number of transactions and transfer volume dropped as well \u2014 a worrying sign.\n\nInterestingly, while the token\u2019s price dropped, its demand in the derivatives market increased. ETH\u2019s Funding Rate was green, suggesting that investors were buying the token at a lower price at press time.\n\nAdditionally, its Taker Buy Sell Ratio was green as well, further showing that buying sentiment in the futures market was high. Therefore, the possibility of ETH continuing its downtrend seems likely in the days to come.\n\nHow are the meme coins faring?\n\nThe meme coin pack followed the king of altcoins as their values also plummeted in the recent past. For instance, Dogecoin [DOGE], the world\u2019s largest meme coin, registered a value drop of nearly 7% in just the last 24 hours.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the BTC Profit Calculator\n\nShiba Inu [SHIB] had a similar fate, as the token\u2019s price also sank by more than 5% over the last seven days.\n\nConsidering all the aforementioned metrics and market conditions, one can conclude that the market might remain a little slow in the coming days."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as ETH Breaches $2,000 Resistance \u2013 Time to Buy?\n\nEthereum (ETH), the cryptocurrency that powers the smart-contract-enabled Ethereum blockchain, has pushed back to the north of the $2,000 per token mark on Monday, extending its gains since last week\u2019s near-$1,900 lows to above 6%.\n\nThe rally comes as the broader crypto market enjoys tailwinds on Monday from a weakening US dollar on bets the Fed\u2019s tightening cycle is over and amid optimism about accelerated crypto adoption in South America in wake of Argentina\u2019s election of pro-crypto/Bitcoin President Javier Milei.\n\nEther bulls will be looking to see whether the cryptocurrency can this weak break to the north of a short-term downtrend that has been capping its price since earlier monthly highs in the $2,100s.\n\nWith major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity moving to set up spot Ethereum ETFs, the Ether supply back in deflation thanks to a recent improvement in on-chain activity, and with the macro backdrop seemingly turning into more of a tailwind for crypto, Ether price predictions are likely to remain mostly bullish.\n\nPrice Prediction \u2013 Time to Buy Ether (ETH)?\n\n\n\nEther price predictions turned substantially more bullish earlier this month when ETH vaulted to the north of a downtrend that had been in play since the April yearly highs.\n\nThe bulls have lost momentum in the last week and a half amid profit-taking following ETH\u2019s failure to break above the yearly highs in the $2,100s, but should this level break in the weeks ahead, the cryptocurrency is set up for strong gains.\n\nThat\u2019s because, above the $2,150 area, there aren\u2019t any notable levels of resistance all the way until around $3,500.\n\nIf a crypto \u201cSanta rally\u201d really gets going into the end of 2023, traders could be looking at quick 70% gains in the months ahead.\n\nThat being said, now is probably a good time to buy ETH, even though the cryptocurrency is close to yearly highs.\n\nEthereum remains the dominant blockchain utilized by the Decentralized Finance (DeFi), NFT and broader web3 sectors and Ethereum scaling protocols like Arbitrum, Polygon and Optimism are helping the blockchain retain its dominance against upcoming layer-1 rivals like Avalanche and Solana.\n\nWith upgrades in the coming years likely to address Ethereum scaling problems, the blockchain is expected to experience significant further adoption.\n\nThat means Ether is a prime candidate to continue performing well during the upcoming crypto bull market that is arguably already well underway.\n\nEther Alternative to Consider\n\n\n\nA fun new coin called Ether ETF Token ($ETHETF) is performing well alongside Ether and might be a good candidate to consider for risk-tolerant crypto investors looking to diversify their crypto holdings.\n\nThe token is designed to reward its holders based on news events relating to the upcoming expected approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the US.\n\nThe token was last up around 15% in the last 24 hours, as per DEXTools, with a market cap of less than $1 million, suggesting plenty of room for potential upside should more investors pile into the token.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the token has $440,000 in locked liquidity and no concerning aspects to its smart contract, as per the DEXTools security audit, so investors shouldn\u2019t be too fearful that the token is a scam.\n\nBuy ETHETF HereDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

Moreover, they can get rental income from properties, depending on their ownership percentage. ELDG is the native crypto, and it can be staked for passive income.\n\nDuring Stage 7 of the preamble that just started, the crypto trades at $0.025.\n\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale\n\nWebsite: https://www.everlodge.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/everlodge"

Source: BitInfoCharts\n\nThe sudden uptick in Bitcoin transaction fees stems from a renewed market appetite for assets inscribed with the Ordinals Protocol \u2014 a tool for creating nonfungible token (NFT)-like assets and BRC-20 tokens on Bitcoin.\n\nFollowing a significant lull in activity between Sept. 25 and Oct. 23, Ordinals-based assets saw a drastic uptick beginning in late October, according to Dune Analytics data.\n\nThe number of Ordinals inscriptions grew by over six million since late October.

        "content": "Ethereum is once again gaining significant traction in the world of cryptocurrencies as ETH whale accumulations appear to be on a gradual accumulation path for the first time over the past two months, according to data offered by Glassnode, a platform providing on-chain market metrics.\n\nFurthermore, over the past few hours, amid the price recovery experienced by cryptocurrency markets, the ETH price displayed notable gains, overtaking the $2000 mark as of writing.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, with market resistance levels holding still, there\u2019s a rising concern among significant crypto enthusiasts and whales, who hint towards a potential exit plan following two months of discreetly amassing cryptos.\n\nETH On-Chain Metrics: A Closer Look\n\nNotably, the on-chain data highlighted by a leading analyst aligns with an optimistic perspective of Ethereum\u2019s price despite the constant price flux witnessed by the token over the past few days.\n\nFurthermore, an important trend accompanying the price flux is the sudden rise in non-exchange Ethereum balances and the accumulation of ETH. This pattern indicates that rather than responding with panic and quickly selling holdings on crypto exchanges, these significant stakeholders, also known as whales in the crypto segment, are choosing to gather more of the altcoin.\n\nMoreover, after a two-month interval, Ethereum addresses with a balance surpassing 10,000 tokens or $20 million have been discreetly on the rise. This upswing is reinforcing Ethereum\u2019s present path as buyers gain confidence in sustaining momentum beyond the $2,000 threshold.\n\nAlso read: BCBS Report: Banks Invest $10.27 Billion in Crypto, XRP Emerges as Top Altcoin\n\nETH Price Evaluation\n\nAs of writing, the Ethereum price was marginally up by 3.65%, reaching $2,025.38 as of today. Furthermore, the twenty-four-hour trading volume also witnessed a substantial increase of 34.53% and stood at $9.80 billion while writing.\n\nThe aforementioned price surge also seems to come in alignment with the recent amassing of colossal amounts of ETH by whales.\n\nIf the bulls succeed in maintaining the price above the crucial threshold of $2,000, Ethereum might recover, gain momentum, and position itself for an impending breakout from its symmetrical triangle pattern. A successful breakout could propel the coin to challenge its resistance at $2,190 in the coming future.\n\nAlso read: Massive Institutional Buying Of BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, ADA Continues"

        "title": "Solana and Avalanche follow Ethereum\u2019s lead, reap these benefits - AMBCrypto English",
        "content": "Solana and Avalanche witnessed a rise in staking.\n\nGrowth in the DeFi sector was observed for both chains even as price movement declined.\n\nIn the last few quarters, interest in Ethereum [ETH] staking has reached new heights. With multiple addresses joining the network to stake ETH, liquid staking protocols such as Lido [LDO] also prospered.\n\nHowever, recently, it was seen that interest in staking wasn\u2019t just limited to Ethereum. Networks such as Solana [SOL] and Avalanche [AVAX] were slowly making their mark in this space as well.\n\nStaking on the rise\n\nSolana has a considerable portion of its available supply locked in staking, which means users hold and store their Solana coins in a special account to support the network.\n\nThis contrasts with Ethereum, where a smaller percentage of its circulating supply is used for staking.\n\nThe recent price increase of Solana may be largely influenced by this high level of staking activity, indicating strong community support and confidence in the Solana network.\n\nStaking is a way for crypto holders to earn rewards by actively participating in network security and operations, making their coins work for them. This difference in staking dynamics contributes to Solana\u2019s recent surge in value.\n\nAn overview of the staking landscape. Solana actually has significantly more of it's circulating supply in staking, compared to Ethereum. This could largely be the biggest contributing factor to it's recent pump. pic.twitter.com/AMWZNDH2GL \u2014 ImNotTheWolf (@ImNotTheWolf) November 20, 2023\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t just Solana that was seeing growth in this space.\n\nRecently, BenqiFinance on Avalanche experienced growth in liquid staking comparable to what Solana observed in the past month. More people staking on Avalanche is like a team getting stronger. It makes AVAX, the native coin, more secure.\n\nThis also attracts people to Avalanche, causing a surge in the token\u2019s price.\n\nAn overview of the staking landscape. Solana actually has significantly more of it's circulating supply in staking, compared to Ethereum. This could largely be the biggest contributing factor to it's recent pump. pic.twitter.com/AMWZNDH2GL \u2014 ImNotTheWolf (@ImNotTheWolf) November 20, 2023\n\nGrowth in DeFi\n\nThere was also some growth in the DeFi sector. Notably, Solana\u2019s exchanges had a big week, trading at $1.93 billion. This shows a lot of money moving on Solana\u2019s blockchain.\n\nDEXes let people trade crypto directly without a middleman. The high volume means more interest and action in DeFi on Solana. This growth shows that people really like using Solana\u2019s DEXes for crypto trading.\n\nAlong with the surge in Solana\u2019s DEX volumes, Avalanche\u2019s DEX volumes also grew. Coupled with that, the TVL on both Solana and Avalanche also rose.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the SOL Profit Calculator\n\nA rising Total Value Locked (TVL) is good for Solana and Avalanche. It means more assets are locked into their networks. This boosts confidence in the platforms. Thus, higher TVL can attract more projects and users.\n\nDespite the protocol\u2019s improvement in terms of staking and DeFi, the growth wasn\u2019t reflected in the price. Over the last few weeks, the overall price of AVAX and SOL fell. At press time, SOL was trading at $9.544 and AVAX was trading at $22.36."

This slow purchase activity began for the first time in the past two months, per Ali's X post.\n\n#Ethereum | There's a subtle yet intriguing shift happening \u2013 $ETH whales seem to be on a slow accumulation path for the first time in two months! pic.twitter.com/LfvOG0sM3T \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) November 20, 2023\n\nAccording to the Glassnode chart he shared, these are whales that hold 10,000 ETH or more in their wallets.\n\nOver the last 24 hours, Whale Alert crypto tracker, as if supporting this point, spotted two massive ETH transactions made from major exchange Bitfinex to unknown blockchain addresses \u2014 21,229 ETH (worth $42,454,140) and 19,764 ETH (evaluated at $39,157,392). The latter ETH sum went to a new wallet, the above-mentioned source emphasized.\n\nBoth transactions look like purchases of ETH that had been withdrawn to cold wallets for long-term storage.\n\nWhales taking profit as ETH price surges\n\nIn the meantime, the Ethereum price managed to regain the $2,000 high over the weekend, now trading at the $2,023 level on the Bitstamp exchange. Thus, from Friday, Nov. 17, to today, Ethereum has demonstrated 6.10% growth.\n\nAs the ETH price has been rising, several whales decided to withdraw their profits over the weekend. According to Whale Alert data, there were three massive transactions, sending ETH to top exchanges Bitfinex and Coinbase.\n\nThe aforementioned blockchain sleuth spotted 18,373 ETH; 18,095 ETH and 15,000 ETH sent to be sold. The first two transactions are evaluated at slightly more than $35 million. The last of the three was worth $29,711,897."

Major altcoins like Solana, Dogecoin, and Avalanche cooled their rallies and dipped in price.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut other smaller, albeit well-known coins and tokens, such as PancakeSwap and ApeCoin made impressive gains.\n\nPancakeSwap (CAKE), the native token behind the decentralized exchange, was trading for $2.67 by the time this article was published\u2014an 8% jump over the day.\n\nWhile ApeCoin (APE) was also up nearly 8% in 24 hours, trading hands for $1.48. It's welcome news for APE holders, who in the past couple months have seen the token hit new laws. At one point in September, it was trading for $1.16 per token.\n\nThis time last month, an Apecoin community accelerator launched from Animoca Brands' Forj, an NFT creators platform.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAs Ethereum (ETH) approaches the pivotal $2,000 mark, investors are closely monitoring its potential to sustain or reverse the current momentum. The significance of the $2,000 level lies not just in its psychological impact but also as a technical indicator that has historically acted as both support and resistance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the current context, Ethereum's price resilience can be partially attributed to the network's decreasing supply. With the implementation of EIP-1559, a portion of transaction fees is \"burned,\" effectively removing ETH from circulation. Recent data shows a substantial amount of ETH being burned, with a yearly estimated burn rate of 1,273K ETH. This deflationary mechanism is juxtaposed against the supply growth of 0.35% per year, presenting a compelling narrative for scarcity-driven value appreciation.\n\nEthereum's supply dynamics are complemented by its ever-growing ecosystem, with DeFi and NFTs continuing to create demand for ETH. However, it is essential to consider that, while supply metrics are encouraging, demand must keep pace for a positive price action to be sustained. The overall state of the asset is strong, with fundamentals supported by continuous development and anticipation of the full transition to Ethereum 2.0.\n\nInvestors should consider Ethereum's broader role in the blockchain ecosystem, its technical advancements and the macroeconomic factors that influence the crypto market as a whole. As ETH retests the $2,000 threshold, its ability to hold above this level could be a bullish sign, yet any failure to do so might see the asset seeking support at lower levels. Therefore, investors would do well to keep a keen eye on market trends, on-chain metrics and global economic indicators that could influence Ethereum's trajectory.\n\nShiba Inu claws at key resistance\n\nThe meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been making headlines in the cryptocurrency market, not just for its community-driven initiatives but also for its price action, which has recently shown signs of rallying. The technical analysis of SHIB/USDT on the daily chart indicates that SHIB is currently testing a critical resistance level, which, if broken, could signal a bullish trend.\n\nAs of now, SHIB is hovering around the 0.00000850 mark. For SHIB to confirm a bullish breakout, it would need to consistently close above this level and maintain upward momentum. The coin has been making higher lows, which is a positive sign for investors looking for a potential uptrend continuation. Conversely, if SHIB fails to breach this resistance, it could see a retraction to lower support levels.\n\nThe broader sentiment in the crypto market, particularly around meme coins, can be fickle, heavily influenced by social media and market trends. Shiba Inu's strong community backing and the recent increase in burn rates have added a deflationary aspect to the token's economics, but the overall impact on price remains to be seen.\n\nInvestors are advised to keep a close eye on volume changes and market sentiment indicators to gauge the potential for SHIB's price movement. Shiba Inu's transition from a meme-based asset to one with actual utility is underway, as evidenced by partnerships like the one with The Manny Pacquiao Foundation, which aims to utilize the Shibarium blockchain for charity initiatives\u200b\u200b.\n\nThese developments paint a bullish picture for SHIB, suggesting that its current market price could offer a lucrative opportunity for investors eyeing the next bull run, with the ambitious target price of $0.01 being a focal point for the community\u200b\u200b.\n\nWhile the burn rate's direct impact on price remains a topic of debate, these concerted efforts by the SHIB community reflect a strategic approach to fostering both demand and long-term value for the token."

        "content": "An Ethereum-based (ETH) decentralized exchange (DEX) has suffered millions of dollars in losses after an alleged market manipulation attempt by a rogue user.\n\nIn a new thread on the social media platform X, the DEX protocol dYdX says that $9 million from its insurance fund was used to fill gaps in liquidations processed in the recent yearn.finance (YFI) correction but notes that no customer funds were affected.\n\n\u201cLast night about $9 million from the dYdX v3 insurance fund was used to fill gaps on liquidations processed in the YFI market. The v3 insurance fund remains well funded with $13.5 million in funds remaining. No user funds were affected and our team is working to investigate the event.\u201d\n\nAccording to dYdX founder Antonio Juliano, the events that led to the $9 million loss were likely staged by a deep-pocketed bad actor.\n\n\u201cBasically all of this was driven [by] one actor (traceable through on-chain fund movements)\u2026\n\nThe actor was able to withdraw a good amount of USDC from dYdX right before the price crash. The YFI price crash in the spot market seems like an intentional effort by a single actor (unsure whether the same or different one) to target the large OI (open interest) on dYdX\u2026\n\nThis information strongly makes me think this was an intentional market manipulation attempt by a well-capitalized actor(s) designed to drain funds from the dYdX insurance pool.\u201d\n\nThe DEX protocol says it is now widening its margin requirements for its more illiquid trading pairs.\n\n\u201cAs an immediate measure, we have increased initial margin requirements for less liquid markets: EOS, ZRX, AAVE, ALGO, ICP, XMR, XTZ, ZEC, SUSHI, RUNE, SNX, ENJ, 1INCH, CELO, YFI, UMA, SUSHI. We will continue to monitor, but believe this to be an important first step.\u201d\n\ndYdX is trading for $3.26 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "A new Ethereum layer-2 rollup, announced Monday, has already attracted $27 million in total value locked (TVL), but there\u2019s a twist: It doesn\u2019t yet exist.\n\nThe promised network, Blast, would launch as an optimistic rollup in February 2024, but its backers immediately began soliciting deposits into a smart contract \u201cbridge.\u201d\n\nIn the span of half a day, the contract has amassed enough ether (ETH) and dai (DAI) to put it at number 16 in rollup tracker L2Beat\u2019s TVL rankings, ahead of established names such as derivatives DEX Aevo and Arbitrum Nova.\n\nThe announcement touts Blast as \u201cthe only Ethereum L2 with native yield for ETH and stablecoins,\u201d meaning it taps into Ethereum staking yield by directing all ETH to Lido and uses DAI to tap MakerDAO\u2019s growing US Treasury bill yield through its Dai Savings Rate (DSR), currently at 5%.\n\nBlast\u2019s development team, led by pseudonymous Blur co-founder Pacman, raised $20 million from venture capital firms Paradigm and Standard Crypto, joined by a motley crew of angel investors and crypto influencers.\n\nEarly reaction has focused on the one-way nature of the \u201cbridge\u201d \u2014 once you cross you can\u2019t exit until after Blast actually launches and withdrawals are enabled.\n\nNormally, a bridge allows assets to flow both ways. This contract is apparently controlled by a five-key multi-signature wallet. However, of the five addresses, one contains no ether and has no transaction history, and the other four were recently funded by a single address.\n\nThat calls into question the independence of the signing cohort.\n\nAccording to Pacman, there\u2019s no need to worry.\n\n\u201cThe Blast Early Access bridge contract does use a multisig, and each signer is a unique contributor to Blast,\u201d he told Blockworks. \u201cThis is the same security model that other L2s like Optimism, Polygon, and Arbitrum utilize \u2014 these L2s are all upgradeable via multisig as well.\u201d\n\nBlockworks also contacted Paradigm and Standard Crypto for comment.\n\nL2Beat designated the project \u201cupcoming\u201d rather than \u201cactive\u201d as a result of its current implementation.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThe use of Lido has drawn the ire of Ethereum community members concerned with centralization risk in staking providers, including Dankrad Feist, who called it \u201ca very bad idea\u201d on X.\n\n\u201cETH and liquid staking derivatives are different assets with different risk profiles (and rewards), and users should have a choice about which one they want to use,\u201d he said.\n\nIt should come as no surprise, given that Paradigm is an investor in both Lido and Blur.\n\nCritics also question the use of a multi-level-marketing style referral campaign, which doles out points, of unknown value, to incentivize sending invitations to prospective new users.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThe site explicitly promises an airdrop based on early access participation. Points earned are expected to be redeemable in May 2024.\n\nPoints systems have increasingly been used as a growth bootstrapping mechanism by protocol developers \u2014 including Pacman\u2019s prior marketing of Blur \u2014 and are widely seen as a precursor to an airdrop or something else of value.\n\nUpdated Nov. 21, 2024 at 12:15 pm ET with comment from Pacman and Nov. 22 at 5:57 am ET with additional context.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Since Nov. 21, 2022, they have amassed 30.3% additional coins and now control 52% of Ethereum's circulating supply.\n\nFurthermore, 94,700 new ETH wallets were created on Nov. 21, the largest number since July.\n\nETH was down 1.22% in the last 24 hours to $2,076 at the time of writing. On Nov. 24, bulls drove the price of Ethereum to a high of $2,134 before falling.

        "content": "ERC-4437 Promised an Ethereum Revolution\u2014Adoption Figures Tell a Different Story\n\nData from November 14 shows that ERC-4437 has failed to gain meaningful traction among Ethereum developers and users in the months since its launch.\n\nWhen ERC-4437 was unveiled in March 2023, many in the Ethereum community were optimistic that these so-called \u201csmart accounts\u201d would alter user experiences on Ethereum-compatible blockchains for the better. By allowing assets to be controlled by smart contracts rather than externally owned accounts (EOAs), ERC-4437 was supposed to make transactions easier and more secure for everyday users.\n\nAdoption Falters Despite Ethereum Compatibility\n\n\n\nAccording to figures from BundleBear, an account abstraction data analytics platform, both usage and retention of these smart accounts have been underwhelming so far. Only 6.89% of initial smart accounts created have remained active for over six months. The average ERC-4437-enabled account has also only conducted five transactions in total.\n\nThe poor user engagement comes despite ERC-4437\u2019s touted benefits of bypassing seed phrases and simplifying transactions. The standard was designed specifically to make Ethereum more user-friendly, but its sluggish pickup indicates those user experience goals have not yet materialized.\n\nIn addition, core infrastructure providers enabling the functionality have struggled to turn a profit. Bundlers, which allow smart accounts to operate on EVM chains, are largely running at a loss, even with some users accidentally overpaying gas fees.\n\nRetention is terrible. The one exception to this is CyberConnect, who had a lot of users return to claim an airdrop. Data: @0xBundleBear pic.twitter.com/TUzQQJYcp8 \u2014 John Rising (@johnrising_) November 13, 2023\n\nLooking at the data, ERC-4437 advocate John Rising described the adoption figures as \u201cterrible.\u201d After its enthusiastic launch and promotion, the standard has so far failed to deliver the promised advancements in Ethereum user experience.\n\nWill ERC-4437 Eventually Catch Fire on Ethereum?\n\n\n\nSome in the Ethereum community urge patience with ERC-4437. Jesse Pollak, protocol lead at Coinbase, argued adoption of new standards happens gradually before reaching an inflection point. The growth of ERC-4437 may seem slow now but could suddenly accelerate as more developers build supporting infrastructure.\n\nAugust 2023 saw the most active ERC-4437 wallets in a month, with over 420,000 across seven blockchains. While this number declined to 143,000 in October, it still indicates steady initial adoption. For a standard launched in 2023, Pollak contended ERC-4437 uptake remains healthy even if below initial expectations.\n\nThe coming months will be crucial in determining if ERC-4437 delivers on its promise to improve user experiences on Ethereum. For now, the reality is that adoption stays muted. But Ethereum\u2019s history shows community standards like ERC-20 took time to gain traction too before transforming the ecosystem. ERC-4437 advocates are still betting this latest standard will eventually catch on in similar fashion."

        "content": "Ethereum Layer 2 Blast has gone live in early access mode following a $20 million investment from Paradigm and Standard Crypto, among others.\n\nBlast announced the launch in a post on X late yesterday, aiming to become the first Ethereum Layer 2 to introduce a native yield model. Flashbots strategy lead Hasu, Delegate CEO Foobar and members of investment group eGirl Capital also participated in the round.\n\nBlast was built by Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of the NFT marketplace Blur BLUR +1.72% , also known as \u201cPacman.\u201d Roquerre previously doxxed himself in February, outlining plans for the platform to become the \"Binance of NFTs.\"\n\nRoquerre will oversee the development of both Blur and Blast, adding that he had raised another $40 million to contribute to the Blur ecosystem, including Layer 2 apps for NFTs.\n\nBlast plans to airdrop tokens to community members and developers, with half the tokens allocated for each of the two groups. The airdrop will be based on the number of points each member has earned. The developer airdrop is scheduled for January 2024 when the testnet launches while the airdrop for community members will be in May.\n\nWhere the money comes from\n\nThough users can already earn 3-4% by separately staking ether, Blast said the baseline interest rate on existing Layer 2s is 0%, with the value of assets depreciating against inflation over time. With Blast\u2019s native yield, users\u2019 balances compound automatically, offering 4% for ether and 5% for stablecoins, alongside rewards known as \u201cBlast Points,\u201d the team said.\n\nMore specifically, Blast said it natively participates in staking ether and passes the yield on to the Layer 2\u2019s users and dapps, with their balances automatically growing over time.\n\nAdditionally, Blast offers stablecoins yields on USDC, USDT and DAI, which are deposited in on-chain T-Bill protocols like MakerDAO with the yield passed back to users in the form of USDB \u2014 Blast\u2019s auto-rebasing stablecoin.\n\nOver $30 million has bridged to the Layer 2 since launch, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard. This includes over 13,000 ETH ($26 million), $3.4 million in DAI, $2.3 million in USDC and $900,000 in USDT.\n\nAccording to a separate post by Roquerre, there is $100 million of total value locked in Blur\u2019s bidding pool not earning yield, and a Layer 2 was the answer. \u201cA new L2 with native yield for dapps and users would allow the Blur ecosystem to avoid asset depreciation, reduce NFT transaction costs and launch NFT perps,\" he said.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nModel criticism and no withdrawals until February\n\nDespite the apparent demand, the platform has received criticism over how its model is structured and marketed.\n\nInvite-only early access members are offered more points based on how much they bridge and who they invite to rank further up the leaderboard, according to a screenshot shared by Tytan.eth on X and verified by The Block. Members get rewards from those they invite, and then a smaller portion of rewards from people that their invitees then invite. Some have likened it to a Pyramid scheme.\n\nUsers also have to wait until the Blast mainnet launch in February before dapps go live and they can withdraw any funds, according to the team.\n\nCurrently the bridge to send funds to Blast is a multisig wallet owned and controlled by five people.\n\n\"Legally speaking, this is beyond crazy, particularly when only managed by a multisig. You are simply investing in a crypto hedge fund,\" said Delphi Labs General Counsel Gabriel Shapiro on X.\n\nRoquerre did not immediately return a request for comment from The Block.\n\nDisclaimer: Larry Cermak, CEO of The Block, is an angel investor in Blast."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s latest Layer 2 network Blast, has swiftly directed over $20 million in ether and stablecoins via investors.\n\nThe Blast Layer 2 solution is designed to address the speed, cost, and scalability challenges faced by Ethereum\u2019s Layer 1 blockchain. Bridges, acting as a blockchain-based channel, facilitates seamless token transfers between different networks.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBlast\u2019s Unique Design Yields Generation and Innovation\n\nDepositors on Blast can earn yields on transferred ether, coupled with BLAST points. This will add an inventive twist to the pre-existing Layer 2.\n\nStaking returns are distributed back to users and decentralized apps (DApps) on the Layer 2 network as a result of the platform\u2019s inherent participation in ETH staking. According to the firm, having 1 ETH in your Blast wallet will automatically expand to 1.04, 1.08, and 1.12 ETH over time.\n\nHowever, access to the Blast network is currently \u201cinvite-only\u201d, mandating a code from invited users. Withdrawals and on-chain activities will be accessible after the mainnet launch in February. Additionally, the accrued BLAST points can be redeemed starting in May.\n\nIn terms of money invested, more than $19 million in ether has been staked on Lido. This will provide investors with an annualized dividend of up to 4%. Another $3 million is on Maker, while a smaller chunk of $150,000 in DAI stablecoins is in the wallet awaiting action. Blast presents USDB, an auto-rebasing stablecoin, for users bridging stablecoins. The USDB yield is derived from MakerDAO\u2019s on-chain T-Bill protocol.\n\nAlso Read: Bloomberg Analyst Slams SEC For Implicitly Accepting Ethereum As Commodity\n\nAdditional Funding Into Blast\n\nRoquerre, the man behind the pseudonymous figurehead PacmanBlur and co-founder of the non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Blur, reported a significant $40 million fundraising.\n\nThe funding will be used to build decentralized apps (DApps) on top of the platform. Most of the funds will be used to accelerate the progress of NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAs per investor Standard Crypto VC, TVL is an imperfect measuring tool, yet its broad acceptance warrants its examination. Perhaps, the most successful dApps have gathered billions of dollars in external user deposits across multiple categories, including crypto exchanges, lending platforms, perpetual contracts (perps), and social applications.\n\nAdditionally, Standard Crypto VC sees Blast and its connected dApps enforcing unique monetization models. Blast can monetize by collecting a percentage of the yield, removing the need for sequencing fees as a source of revenue, as per the firm. This mechanism, in particular, allows Blast to possibly refund gas fees to the dApps that generate them.\n\nIn response to this news, Blur\u2019s native token, BLUR\u2019s price rose by 12% to trade at $34.\n\nAlso Read: Chainlink Whale Accumulation on the Rise, LINK Price Rally to Continue"

        "content": "Galaxy Fox (GFOX) is a memecoin that some in the crypto community believe has potential for growth. It aims to have versatile functionality compared to competitors.\n\nSome think Galaxy Fox could perform well relative to other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) in 2023.\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum is the second-largest crypto after Bitcoin (BTC) in terms of market capitalization. Its goal is to be a platform where decentralized applications (dapps) and smart contracts can run.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum does not have a fixed cap on the supply of ETH, which has raised some concerns among institutional investors.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum among major blockchains, dominating with 92.5% of total TVL\n\nEthereum aims to apply blockchain\u2019s principles of decentralization, security, and open-source code to a wide range of potential applications. However, the network has faced challenges with congestion, high fees, and limited ability to scale thus far.\n\nNewer blockchain platforms like Solana were explicitly designed to address scalability issues by incorporating improved infrastructure. As a result, Ethereum now faces increasing competition in dapp and smart contracts deployment. The project continues working to upgrade its architecture and performance.\n\nCardano\n\nCardano is a blockchain platform founded in 2017 as an alternative to proof-of-work networks like Bitcoin. It uses a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus mechanism called Ouroboros to address sustainability concerns surrounding crypto\u2019s environmental impact.\n\nBy incorporating proof-of-stake, Cardano aims to create a greener platform than Bitcoin\u2019s electricity-intensive mining operations. This could make it more appealing to institutional investors who consider environmental factors.\n\nThe project was designed to rival Ethereum and allow decentralized apps and smart contracts. However, development has progressed slowly, and some of Cardano\u2019s promised capabilities are not yet active on the platform despite initial expectations of faster advancement. This has caused frustration among some investors.\n\nAs the platform aims to expand functionality, it must demonstrate real-world utility and adoption to compete with faster-moving blockchain projects. The environmental benefits of its consensus model remain a key differentiator if further development progresses.\n\nGalaxy Fox\n\nGalaxy Fox aims to reshape the meme and gaming industries. With its unique combination of play-to-earn (P2E) gaming, staking, and non-fungible token (NFT) offerings, Galaxy Fox has attracted investors who believe it has the potential to carve market share in crypto.\n\nGalaxy Fox will release 3,000 NFTs representing characters from its ecosystem during its presale period. These will be minted, held, or traded on popular NFT marketplaces.\n\nThe platform\u2019s native token, GFOX, will power the Galaxy Fox ecosystem, enabling transactions, investments, and trading.\n\nSupporters are pinning Galaxy Fox\u2019s early success in its presale to the platform\u2019s features and growing popularity.\n\nThe Galaxy Fox presale is in stage 1 and ongoing.\n\nLearn more about Galaxy Fox (GFOX) here:\n\nVisit Galaxy Fox Presale | Join The Telegram Group | Follow Galaxy Fox on Twitter\n\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

Yearly high reclaim.\n\nMake Synthetix great again, [SNX founder Kain Warwick].\u201d\n\nThe trader, whose firm\u2019s holdings include Synthetix, says that SNX has no high time frame resistance until it hits $4.\n\n\u201cI like how this chart is looking, no major resistance until $4 essentially.\u201d\n\nHe adds that the relatively small number of SNX in circulation means just a few big buys could send SNX soaring.\n\n\u201cBelieve SNX has the least amount of circulating coins on CEXs (centralized exchanges) for a top 100 coin. More than 70% of the total supply is staked.\n\nWe have more SNX than some of the CEXs here.

        "content": "Blockchain networks get praise for their transparency. And we like that. But you don\u2019t want your national ID number out there on-chain for anyone to see or use to steal your identity right?\n\nBecause public transparency has its limits. And if you want to limit how much of your public information others can see and access on-chain, then today\u2019s project is for you. Meet this sleeping giant: DOP and its selective transparency protocol.\n\nWhat is Selective Transparency?\n\nBlockchains are public. At least the good ones are. So we\u2019ve been conditioned to think blockchain privacy is only an all-or-nothing game. It has to be not private at all like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Or completely 100% private like Secret Network or Aleph Zero.\n\nBut that\u2019s not true. DOP, which stands for Data Ownership Protocol, gives you an idea of where they stand just by the name. They want YOU to own and control your data. You can see in the background DOP is talking about how shielding some of your data will help crypto go mainstream.\n\nBut they have this selective transparency thing. So what is that? DOP offers the chance for you to decide what, when, and how much of your data you expose to the public. So it\u2019s not all or nothing. Real privacy moves on a sliding scale. Sometimes it matters a lot.\n\nIf you are paying a bill online, or maybe something that costs more than $1000, then maybe you don\u2019t want others to see that info. But then smaller transactions of sending $50 to a friend or buying a small free minted NFT, you may not care as much who sees it. There are lots of advantages to this method.\n\nThe biggest advantage, by far, is that it\u2019s less of a hassle dealing with local regulations worldwide. Many jurisdictions becoming hostile to crypto now. And some of these same jurisdictions have the \u201cguilty until proven innocent\u201d stance even if they say they believe otherwise.\n\nWith that in mind, it means platforms like Secret have a target on their back from these regulators and jurisdictions. And while we are against these types of policies, it\u2019s also foolish to ignore them when you know they are out there. Since DOP lets YOU select what to reveal, the responsibility falls to you. And if a regulator asks the DOP dev team about you, that\u2019s what they will say.\n\n(1/6) At DOP, we're committed to preparing the ground for mass adoption by bringing data ownership to Ethereum. But we know we can't go mainstream without fighting illicit activity. \ud83e\uddf5below: \u2014 Data Ownership Protocol (@dop_org) November 20, 2023\n\nData Ownership vs Privacy\n\nWe already see that with DOP, the level of privacy you choose is on a sliding scale. You get to decide.\n\nBut there are some important distinctions too. Privacy coins are a relatively small part of the market at $6 billion. The previously mentioned regulations are just one of a few reasons why. The biggest coin is Monero at #27 by market value. But DOP is building on top of Ethereum. The EVM market is huge at over $365 billion. It\u2019s 60x larger!!\n\nSo maintaining data ownership down at the user level where you control it, but within the EVM ecosystem can be MUCH more impactful. You are revealing your information much less often on the most popular platforms in crypto. Other advantages include:\n\nZero-knowledge-based KYC if your app needs to KYC customers.\n\nCustomized data disclosures.\n\nShowing full data ownership on Ethereum for the first time.\n\nSo you can see that while privacy is a great goal. Full 100% privacy Secret-style might be more limiting than we\u2019d prefer. DOP\u2019s approach broadens the possibility of you only disclosing this info when you want to even when using the most popular ETH protocols.\n\nDo you use any privacy protocols now? If so, which one is your favorite? Let us know in the comments below.\n\nThank you @Binance for a wonderful event!\n\nWe had a great time at #BinanceBlockchainWeek sharing our vision, showcasing our technology and taking a step closer to true Data Ownership. A big shout out to our amazing community!\n\nIt was wonderful seeing you. Can't wait till next\u2026 pic.twitter.com/3E2Dr2k2DX \u2014 Data Ownership Protocol (@dop_org) November 10, 2023\n\nThe Future of ETH Apps & Protocols\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen the term account abstraction around. It\u2019s confusing and it means a couple of different things.\n\nIt\u2019s supposed to make using Ethereum safer and better. The creation of a \u201csmart account\u201d lets you do the things you want to do like connect to a DeFi app but in an easier way than we do now by:\n\nConnecting.\n\nApprove interaction with the smart contract.\n\nApprove the transaction.\n\nAnd Signing multiple times.\n\nThis shift from Externally Owned Accounts (which is doing it the old way) to this new, faster, safer way is the future of all Ethereum apps and protocols. This new way of using account abstraction allows DOP to offer you flexibility in how private your account is.\n\nBasic human rights like control of your financial data are at risk in the crypto space, and DOP is here to protect it. Our new article explores how DOP allows for the confidentiality users deserve.\n\nRead more: https://t.co/Xembm5il1V pic.twitter.com/L6WHrVpiEH \u2014 Data Ownership Protocol (@dop_org) November 13, 2023\n\nAt the network level, meaning on Ethereum, your account details will now be invisible. So ETH can\u2019t tell who you are. They can only see the smart contract you interact with. So at the user level, which is us, those things are hidden. We now have more options for deciding who sees what instead of the full transparency of a working public blockchain.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt means wallets and apps are easier to work with AND our control over our data will increase. Without account abstraction, it\u2019s hard to make privacy work unless you make everything private like a Secret Network. And the idea of you being in control of your data disclosures would be non-existent.\n\nAccount abstraction is the future of ETH apps. And you can see how it will work in real life with one of the first apps to implement it. Stay tuned out there as the testnet is coming soon so you can try it out for yourself.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information discussed by Altcoin Buzz is not financial advice.

        "content": "Key Highlights:\n\nFollowing plans to build a cross-chain AI Hub, ChainGPT recently announced its integration of Chainlink CCIP across Ethereum and Polygon\n\nThe move follows ChainGPT's plans to improve the experiences within web3 AI.\n\nChainGPT, a renowned AI platform that seeks to bridge the gap between AI and Web3 is seeking to improve its cross-chain AI hub with Ethereum and Polygon.\n\nChainGPT has recently welcomed Ethereum and Polygon to its web3 AI ecosystem after its integration with Chainlink CCIP, an industry standard for secure interoperability between chains.\n\nChainGPT to Foster Cross-Chain Operations Within Its Crypto AI Hub\n\nAccording to a recent blog post from ChainGPT, the platform revealed that the integration will allow it to harness CCIP's arbitrary messaging functionality, thereby paving the way for cross-chain capabilities within the Crypto AI Hub.\n\nAs such, users can now effortlessly list, buy, and sell prompts across Ethereum and Polygon mainnets while they enjoy a more interconnected and streamlined experience.\n\nHeavy on security and efficiency, it appears that ChainGPT's decision to incorporate CCIP was rooted in Chainlink's unparalleled reputation for maintaining top-tier security and reliability in the Web3 industry.\n\nNotably, CCIP's affiliation with the Risk Management Network adds an extra layer of vigilance, continuously monitoring and verifying cross-chain operations to mitigate the risk of suspicious activities within ChainGPT's Crypto AI domain.\n\nArguably, this move reflects ChainGPT's commitment to bringing advanced and remarkable solutions to the web3 and AI industry. As the platform continues to pursue this goal, it has made plans to extend its reach to a diverse array of top EVM chains without deploying its native token directly on those chains.\n\nThis strategic integration eliminates additional liquidity costs while providing users with a broader spectrum of AI tools and solutions. Hence, its integration of the Ethereum Mainnet will see it leverage the network's improved scalability, security, speed, sustainability, and lots more to boost its operations.\n\nFurthermore, the seamless integration process offered by CCIP simplifies the developer experience, requiring only the integration of the CCIP Router on-chain to initiate the creation of secure cross-chain applications. In addition to this, CCIP's scalable architecture eliminates the need for developers to write custom code for chain-specific integrations, enabling users to interact with any blockchain through a unified interface.\n\nIlan Rakhmanov, CEO & Founder of ChainGPT commented on the integration saying;\n\n\u201cWith Chainlink CCIP, ChainGPT can expand its reach faster than ever without adding on the overhead of multi-chain expansion.\u201d\n\nBeyond the immediate advantages, Chainlink CCIP proves to be future-proof. Its adaptability supports continuous updates, including the integration of new blockchains, advanced functionalities, and additional security measures. This forward-looking approach ensures that ChainGPT remains at the forefront of cross-chain innovation without incurring switching costs in the face of evolving requirements."

        "content": "Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson sought to clear the air after new evidence emerged about his past involvement with the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nCardano\u2019s founder, Charles Hoskinson, has often been haunted by the experience he had in his early days in the blockchain ecosystem, especially while working on Ethereum.\n\nIn the latest development, the Cardano founder was compelled to speak in a 22-minute livestream in which he dispelled the rumors and provided clarity to listeners.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAt the heart of the current matter was a video and documentation shared by Steven Nerayoff. Nerayoff was an early Ethereum advisor who had access to essential communication within the team. In the documentation being sold as an NFT, Nerayoff shared previously private information on a troubling period in Ethereum\u2019s history.\n\nAt the time, the Ethereum team wanted to restructure the project and called on Nerayoff for advice, leading to a lengthy call between the advisor and Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin. With or without Vitalik\u2019s permission, Nerayoff recorded the call, which he now wants to monetize as an NFT.\n\nETHEREUM RESCUE & RESTRUCTURE PLAN:\n\nIn late 2014 Ethereum was in trouble. Vitalik Buterin asked Steven Nerayoff to do a full diagnostic assessment and recommendations on how to save Ethereum and restructure it for long term success. Over the early months of 2015 Steven and\u2026 pic.twitter.com/o7H0dwMhiy \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 16, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNotably, Charles Hoskinson was among the major subjects of the call. A transcript of the call shows that Charles was mentioned 69 times, with Nerayoff speaking favorably of the entrepreneur\u2019s involvement with Ethereum.\n\nNew Evidence Clarifies Charles Hoskinson\u2019s Reputation with Ethereum\n\nSteven Nerayoff\u2019s latest reveal suggests that Charles Hoskinson was a valuable member of the Ethereum Foundation. During the conversation with Vitalik Buterin, Nerayoff spoke highly favorably of Charles Hoskinson and urged the team to bring him back into the ranks, given his experience and strengths.\n\nReviewing this part of the conversation, Charles Hoskinson said in the recent livestream, \u201cHe [Nerayoff] was trying really hard to bring me back into the fold. At this juncture, I was already deep in the thick of things, starting Input Output [Cardano\u2019s engineering arm].\u201d\n\nAccording to Charles Hoskinson, Nerayoff\u2019s documentation and call with Vitalik dispel three main accusations that were leveled against him by naysayers. The allegations include that \u2018Charles is a pathological liar, never contributed to the crypto space, and constantly overstated his role in Ethereum\u2019s early development.\u2019\n\nThe Cardano founder, alluding to recent reports by crypto journalist Laura Shin, added that half-baked stories have helped foster those lies. However, such lies hold no water compared to Nerayoff\u2019s independently released information.\n\nMeanwhile, Hoskinson reiterated his long-term commitment to building out Cardano and his reputation in the crypto space. He noted that he has been in cryptocurrency for over 10 years and has had no \u201cclass action lawsuit, legal issues.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the entrepreneur has sustained an impressive track record, having \u2018built a $12 billion dollar valued blockchain, collaborated on over 200 academic research papers, and written a lot of code.\u2019\n\n\u201cYou can disagree with the economic value of these things. [Yet] You can\u2019t disagree with the fact that I\u2019m here and I\u2019ve been building things,\u201d Charles Hoskinson added.\n\nNotably, Cardano (ADA) has consistently ranked among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization in recent years. At the same time, the blockchain has seen increased DeFi TVL in the past few months, underlining its continued growth."

        "content": "On-chain fees for Bitcoin transactions have surpassed those on Ethereum for the first time in three years.\n\nOptimism surrounding a potential spot Bitcoin ETF approval and the rising popularity of Bitcoin ordinals inscriptions has led to a rise in transaction fees on the network, which surpassed fees on Ethereum for the first time since 2020.\n\nAccording to data from Crypto Fees, Bitcoin transaction fees reached a daily high of $11.6 million, outpacing the $5.6 million in daily transaction fees recorded by Ethereum over the same period.\n\nHowever, on a weekly basis Ethereum transaction fees stands at around $8.3 million, while Bitcoin averaged $7 million in fees.\n\nRead more: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Calls Bitcoin an \u2018International Asset\u2019 that Could \u2018Revolutionize Finance\u2019\n\nStill, the shift in daily metrics potentially implies a change in current market dynamics, especially when taking into account the factor at which Bitcoin fees have risen over the last few weeks.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, Bitcoin generated $11M in transaction fees.

        "content": "Crypto trading volumes soar, BlackRock files to launch spot Ethereum ETF, while Tether goes Bitcoin mining\n\nData from CryptoCompare shows that the price of Bitcoin started last week with a sharp move downwards, dropping from around $37,000 to a low near $35,000, before recovering to now trade at $37,100 per coin.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, moved steadily upward throughout the past week, going from around $1,940 per coin to a peak near $2,050 before a small correction over the weekend brought ether down to $2,020 a token.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price kept rising as BlackRock \u2013 the world\u2019s largest asset manager \u2013 filed an application with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF), the iShares Ethereum Trust.\n\nThe fund would aim to \u201creflect generally the performance of the price of Ether\u201d, and would have Coinbase as the custodian for the ETH held by the fund. Ethereum\u2019s price started climbing after BlackRock registered the iShares Ethereum trust with Delaware\u2019s Division of Corporations a week ago.\n\nBlackRock has filed the S-1 prospectus for its Spot Ethereum ETF with the SEC, earlier this morning.\n\nThe filing, among other things, appoints Coinbase as the Custodian for the underlying ETH.\n\n\n\nThere appears to be no mention on whether the Trust will actively be staking the ETH\u2026 \u2014 Tree News (@News_Of_Alpha) November 16, 2023\n\nWhile the spot ETH ETF filing helped the price of Ether rise, a fake XRP ETF filing sparked a trading frenzy that saw the price of the cryptocurrency rise as much as 13% throughout the week, before BlackRock denied any involvement. XRP\u2019s price then erased its gains, leading to over $7 million in liquidations.\n\nThe fake XRP ETF filing also appeared on Delaware\u2019s website, and Delaware\u2019s Department of Justice could now be looking into the fraudulent filing. It\u2019s unclear how it ended up on the website.\n\nMeanwhile the cryptocurrency arm of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Cboe Digital, is set to introduce margined Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts on January 11, following their their receipt of approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in June.\n\nThe move will position Cboe Digital as the first regulated U.S. platform to provide both spot and leveraged derivatives on a single platform. Margined futures enable traders to utilize leverage to trade beyond their collateral, a feature not available with regular futures.\n\nCrypto market volume soars amid South Korean trading frenzy\n\nIn the last two months, the volume of the digital asset market has experienced a significant rise, largely driven by trading activity in Asia, particularly South Korea. According to CCData, South Korean exchanges have more than doubled their market share, increasing from 5.2% in January to 12.9% in November. The total trading volume also saw growth in October and November.\n\nThe firm\u2019s recent Exchange Review report details that Upbit, a centralized exchange, witnessed a substantial increase in market share in October, accounting for 9.16% of the trading volume on these platforms.\n\nThis is the highest market share that the Korean cryptocurrency exchange has achieved since its inception, with local traders reportedly focusing on altcoins.\n\nMeanwhile cryptocurrency exchange giant OKX has started offering derivatives trading off of its platform, eliminating the counterparty risk of holding assets on an exchange, at a time in which it\u2019s also introducing its own layer-2 blockchain called X1.\n\nPoloniex, a well-established cryptocurrency exchange, suffered a major security breach after hackers stole over $100 million worth of digital assets from its hot wallets and used some of the funds to pump the price of TRX, a cryptocurrency created by Poloniex investor Justin Sun.\n\nTether to spend $500 million on Bitcoin mining expansion\n\nLeading stablecoin issuer Tether has started venturing into the Bitcoin mining industry with a significant investment, aiming to become a global leader in the sector. Tether\u2019s incoming CEO Paolo Ardoino has revealed the firm is investing $500 million over the next six months to strengthen its position in the sector.\n\nArdoino has revealed that Tether is establishing Bitcoin mining operations in Uruguay, Paraguay, and El Salvador. Each of these locations will have a power capacity ranging from 40 to 70 megawatts. The company\u2019s objective is to increase its portion of the Bitcoin hashrate, which is the computational power that underpins the network, to 1%.\n\nMeanwhile, global banking giant JPMorgan has launched a new programmable payment option for its institutional clients using its proprietary blockchain platform JPM Coin.\n\nThe latest feature provides institutional clients with the ability to establish treasury operations that are programmable and operate in real-time, laying the groundwork for cutting-edge digital business models, according to JPMorgan.\n\nFrancisco Memoria is a content creator at CryptoCompare who\u2019s in love with technology and focuses on helping people see the value digital currencies have.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nSantander Private Banking International, the international arm of Spanish lender Banco Santander, has recently announced it is delving deeper into the crypto market. The bank has rolled out a new service allowing high-net-worth clients with Swiss accounts to invest in and trade Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nExtending Crypto Services\n\nAffluent customers of Santander Private Banking International will now have access to trade bitcoin and ether. The rollout of the new crypto trading service will initially start with BTC and ETH only, with the banking behemoth planning to introduce other cryptocurrencies meeting its stringent screening standards in the coming months.\n\nAs per the report, the digital asset services will be available exclusively at customers\u2019 request and facilitated through their designated relationship managers. The bank will store the private cryptographic keys of the tradable cryptocurrencies in a secure and regulated environment.\n\nThe move by Santander, a prominent banking institution with a history spanning more than 160 years and an extensive customer base of 166 million, represents a wider acceptance of cryptocurrencies in mainstream banking.\n\nJohn Whelan, head of crypto and digital assets at Santander, pointed at the progressiveness of Swiss crypto regulations while commenting on the development. Whelan explained:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Swiss regulation related to digital assets is one of the first and most advanced in the world since it provides clarity and a comprehensive regulatory environment for our clients. As holding of crypto as an alternative asset class continues to expand, we expect that our clients prefer to rely on their existing financial institutions to be responsible for their assets.\u201d\n\nMore Traditional Banks Are Embracing Crypto\n\nSantander\u2019s push into digital asset trading is rather bold, as most multinational banks prefer dabbling in tokenization while avoiding direct exposure to open-access blockchains and crypto assets. The bank will likely benefit from Switzerland\u2019s robust crypto regulatory outlook, overseen by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). Notably, Switzerland has been grabbing every chance to establish itself as a global leader in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nSantander\u2019s foray into crypto services is a rising trend among banking institutions across the globe. German bank Commerzbank was the first full-service bank in the country to secure a crypto custody license from local regulators. Commerzbank\u2019s move positions it to cater to the growing institutional interest in crypto assets among its clients.\n\nDr. J\u00f6rg Oliveri del Castillo-Schulz, chief operating officer of Commerzbank, stressed the bank\u2019s commitment to applying the latest groundbreaking technologies while fully complying with local regulations.\n\nThe increasing involvement of banks in the cryptosphere is a pivotal moment that demonstrates a growing acceptance of digital assets within mainstream financial services."

        "content": "Mon 20 Nov 2023 \u25aa 4 min of reading \u25aa by Mikaia A.\n\nThere\u2019s something new with Ethereum. In due time, the account abstraction related to rollups on the world\u2019s most popular blockchain will become effective. Let\u2019s dive in !\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation wants to revise the concept of rollups\n\nDecongesting Ethereum is the goal of the promoters of the layer 2 zkRollup technology which is behind Loopring (LRC), Hermez (HEZ), and ZKSync. Among all the existing solutions (or those under construction), Loopring would arrive with almost non-existent gas fees: 0.25% for the swap. That\u2019s about a 90% reduction compared to ETH transaction fees on layer 1s.\n\nEven Hermez Network by Polygon doesn\u2019t compete with Loopring on this point.\n\nLet 'er RIP! \u2728\n\n\n\nNative Account Abstraction for rollups standardization that is https://t.co/hR0MU6inuh \u2014 erc4337 (@erc4337) November 18, 2023\n\nBased on the tweet by Alexander Forshat, a developer at the Ethereum Foundation, U\u00b0Today highlighted the imminent arrival of ERC 4337 at the level of Ethereum Virtual Machine rollups. For now, it is just a simple proposal. However, once effective, this account abstraction will facilitate the blurring of the line between accounts on Ethereum and smart contracts.\n\nThe title of Alexander Forshat\u2019s proposal is: \u201cRoadmap for Native Account Abstraction Introduction\u201d (or Roadmap for the introduction of native account abstraction). It also goes by another name, \u201cRIP-7560: Native Account Abstraction\u201d.\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to make use, for the first time, of the concept of AA in the ecosystem of rollups. Using it would facilitate the integration of second-layer scaling solutions for Ethereum, the issuer of ETH cryptocurrency. And at the same time, it would endow on-chain Ethereum wallets with smart contract functionality.\n\nConditions to be respected\n\nOnce AA is enabled in EVM rollups, both L1 and L2 of Ethereum will have similar AA designs conducive to a \u201cseamless ecosystem\u201d. But before we get there, these changes will need to be made within smart contract accounts:\n\nadjusting the entry point address ;\n\nrewriting the validateUserOP function ;\n\ndeveloping transaction logics.\n\nAdditionally, some tweaks will be needed in the adjustment of Paymaster operations and the signature aggregation process.\n\nThis has sparked the interest of Ethereum enthusiasts, who have not hesitated to leave comments in the GitHub repository of the famous proposal. Alexander Forshat remains very optimistic about his proposal.\n\n\u201cWe believe that standardization and network effect are essential to the success of any account abstraction initiative, which is why we invite everyone to participate in creating the standard for native account abstraction that can be adopted by all layer 2 and layer 1 networks,\u201d he said.\n\nNote that from a developmental perspective, the Ethereum developers have recently distinguished between Ethereum Research Concepts (ERC) and Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP).\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

As long as firms, fintech startups, exchanges, and banks have the license to operate under the guidelines of FINMA, Santander will not face any issues.\n\nWhile many retail banks are struggling to find a spot to fix their roots on crypto land, Santander has shown a great approach starting with Switzerland. Previously, the investment bank was registered under the French regulator as a crypto custodian.\n\nThe company has been granted digital asset service provider (DASP) certification by France\u2019s Financial Market Supervisory Commission (AMF) to deliver the services it claims.\n\nAlso Read: Mastercard Taps Feedzai To Fortify Defense Against Crypto Frauds\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum Prices Reacts Positively\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have been seen complementing each other.

The recent developments in the field of ETF are one of the reasons. Spot Bitcoin ETF, which is still under the scrutiny of the SEC is yet to be allotted to the 12 firms in the queue.\n\nThe recent announcement of Spot Ethereum ETF filling by BlackRock has created a spark in the market again.

        "content": "Just like Bitcoin and some other popular cryptocurrencies, Ethereum ($ETH) also shows good chances of recovery during 2024. There is speculation in crypto circles that Ethereum ($ETH) could reach a value of as much as $3,000, but investors rightly wonder how realistic that is.\n\nMany experienced crypto investors are aware that the chances of $ETH advancing that much are actually minimal, and that\u2019s why they prefer to choose cryptocurrencies in which they can invest on much better terms and at a much better price. Those with rich crypto experience currently choose Bitcoin ETF ($BTCETF), Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX), Meme Kombat ($MK), T.G. Casino ($TGC) and eTukTuk ($TUK), and decide to leave Ethereum ($ETH) aside.\n\nBut in order not to favor these young cryptocurrencies without prior analysis, let\u2019s first analyze the factors that could potentially propel Ethereum to $3,000 as well as take a look at the price prediction for this popular crypto.\n\n>>>Buy The Best Crypto Now<<<\n\nBitcoin ETF ($BTCETF) shows more chances of success in 2024 than Ethereum ($ETH)!\n\nA coin that shows a much higher chance of success during 2024 and whose presale would be wise to take advantage of is the Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF). This rising crypto star that can potentially bring early investors a huge return on investment has been delivering impressive results from day one. According to crypto influencers, by investing early in the Bitcoin ETF Token, and taking advantage of the fantastic presale price of only $0.0054, you are increasing your chances to become rich very quickly, so don\u2019t miss this unique opportunity! Just keep in mind that this 10x potential crypto has a limited supply, so act fast!\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin ETF Now<<<\n\nBitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) is more popular than Ethereum ($ETH) for a good reason!\n\nMore and more investors decide to invest in Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) instead of Ethereum ($ETH) because this coin is set for massive gains!

The unique stake-2-mine approach gives you the chance to win fantastic passive rewards and potentially make a big return on your investment because $BTCMTX is a crypto that shows a chance to bring 10x returns to the ones who invest early!\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin Minetrix Now<<<\n\nMeme Kombat ($MK) could surpass Ethereum ($ETH)!\n\nA meme coin that, judging by the results so far, could also surpass Ethereum ($ETH) is Meme Kombat ($MK). This exciting coin that provides a comprehensive experience, from active betting to passive staking, and numerous other earning opportunities, has won the sympathy of crypto users, and we can conclude that from the outstanding presale results. In a relatively short period, $MK has raised more than $1.7 million, and that figure is increasing every day. It seems that the Meme Kombat, one of the hottest crypto presales, will be completed much sooner than we think, so take the opportunity to invest in this high-potential crypto and grab it while its price is only $0.189!\n\n>>> Buy Meme Kombat Now<<<\n\nT.G. Casino ($TGC) is a fantastic alternative to Ethereum ($ETH)!\n\nIf you are disappointed that Ethereum ($ETH) has little chance of reaching $3,000, don\u2019t worry, because there is a fantastic alternative that is set for big gains: T.G. Casino ($TGC). The world\u2019s number one Telegram Casino has raised more than an incredible $2 million, and the reason for this is the huge number of crypto gambling fans who are aware of all the benefits that owning $TGC tokens brings. By investing in $TGC at an excellent price of only $0.155, you get not only the opportunity to enjoy a unique gambling experience but also to potentially make impressive earnings on your investment.

More and more users are choosing this green crypto instead of Ethereum ($ETH), because not only does $TUK show chances for fine results and a fine increase in value, but at the same time it leaves a positive impact on the entire planet by reducing pollution.\n\n>>>Buy The Best Crypto Now<<<\n\nEthereum ($ETH) price prediction for 2024.\n\nIt is an undeniable fact that the popular Ethereum ($ETH) has been experiencing a slight recovery in recent days. Observing the \u201cbehavior\u201d of Ethereum ($ETH), market analyst Markus Thielen concluded that this crypto could progress quite well in the coming months.\n\nAccording to his analysis, several factors could influence the explosion of the value of Ethereum ($ETH) during the year 2024. Thielen claims that if increased transaction activity and increased user interest continue, Ethereum will very likely manage to reach $3,000. In the opinion of this market analyst, the Eth2 upgrade could also have a positive effect on the value of Ethereum.\n\nOn the other hand, a large part of crypto experts are convinced that the explosion of Ethereum\u2019s value will not happen in 2024, and here are their predictions:\n\nMONTH MINIMUM PRICE MAXIMUM PRICE January $1,726.51 $2,028.56 February $1,718.62 $2,079.45 March $1,710.72 $2,130.35 April $1,702.83 $2,181.24 May $1,694.93 $2,232.14 June $1,687.04 $2,283.03 July $1,679.14 $2,333.93 August $1,671.24 $2,384.82 September $1,663.35 $2,435.72 October $1,655.45 $2,486.61 November $1,647.56 $2,537.51 December $1,639.66 $2,588.40\n\nAs you can see, the probability of $ETH reaching $3,000 in 2024 is almost non-existent, so it would be good to put this coin aside and invest in one of the coins that has a real chance to pump in price!\n\n>>>Buy The Best Crypto Now<<<\n\nConclusion\n\nAs you can see for yourself, the popular Ethereum ($ETH) will continue to recover, but it will still not manage to achieve explosive growth in value and reach the value of $3,000, at least not during the year 2024. But, the good thing is that some young coins that bring a bunch of other benefits show excellent chances to achieve much greater success than $ETH! So, choose $BTCETF, $BTCMTX, $MK, or $TGC, and invest in them as soon as possible, because they will all achieve impressive results next year!\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the oldest and most valued cryptocurrency in the world, managed to rise above the $37,000 mark, riding high on the news of the Argentine presidential election win of Bitcoin-friendly Javier Milei. Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand, cashed in on a boost caused due to Fidelity seeking Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) and climbed above the $2,000 mark. Other popular altcoins \u2014 including the likes of Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), and Dogecoin (DOGE) \u2014 landed in the reds across the board.\n\nThe global crypto market cap stood at $1.41 trillion at the time of writing, registering a 24-hour gain of 1.75 percent.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Today\n\nBitcoin price stood at $37,175.82, registering a 24-hour jump of 1.80 percent, as per CoinMarketCap.

As per WazirX, SOL price in India stood at Rs 5,340.\n\nTop Crypto Gainers Today (November 20)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto gainers over the past 24 hours:\n\nSynthetix (SNX)\n\nPrice: $3.50\n\n24-hour gain: 21.19 percent\n\nNear Protocol (NEAR)\n\nPrice: $2.01\n\n24-hour gain: 15.88 percent\n\nArweave (AR)\n\nPrice: $9.04\n\n24-hour gain: 13.90 percent\n\nImmutable (IMX)\n\nPrice: $1.31\n\n24-hour gain: 13.60 percent\n\nGala (GALA)\n\nPrice: $0.02531\n\n24-hour gain: 10.58 percent\n\nTop Crypto Losers Today (November 20)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto losers over the past 24 hours:\n\nCelestia (TIA)\n\nPrice: $6.57\n\n24-hour loss: 6.71 percent\n\nRender (RNDR)\n\nPrice: $3.27\n\n24-hour loss: 4.52 percent\n\nXDC Network (XDC)\n\nPrice: $0.05247\n\n24-hour loss: 1.80 percent\n\nUNUS SED LEO (LEO)\n\nPrice: $4.05\n\n24-hour loss: 0.57 percent\n\nORDI (ORDI)\n\nPrice: $22.71\n\n24-hour loss: 0.55 percent\n\nWhat Crypto Exchanges Are Saying About Current Market Scenario\n\nMudrex co-founder and CEO Edul Patel told ABP Live, \u201cBitcoin is presently trading above the $37,300 level, following the victory of pro-Bitcoin candidate Javier Milei in the Argentinian Presidency elections. To maintain this positive momentum, Bitcoin will need to clear the resistance at the $37,800 mark or risk finding support around $36,500. Meanwhile, the Altcoin Near Procol (NEAR) has marked a substantial 17 percent price increase over the past week, thanks to its partnership with the South Korean platform Zep for metaverse game development. Ethereum, on the other hand, is trading around the $2,000 threshold.\u201d\n\nParth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures, said, \u201cThe crypto market started gaining momentum on Sunday, as a pro-Bitcoin candidate \u2014 Javier Milei \u2014 won the elections in Argentina. On this account, BTC (+2.2 percent) observed a steep rise before correcting near $37,200 levels. Analysts predict support to range between $33,000 to $34,500 with resistance at $38,000. On the institution adoption front, Fidelity has become the latest financial firm that is seeking to create an ETH ETF. Joining its rival BlackRock and 5 other companies, the entry of such financial giants in embracing crypto provides positive signals for the sector.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cDogecoin soared dramatically following a groundbreaking partnership with SpaceX, propelling its value to unprecedented heights. Simultaneously, Bitcoin faces market fluctuations, prompting reflection and comparisons to its 2021 performance. Tether strategically invests $500 million in Bitcoin mining, signalling a deliberate expansion and diversification within the stablecoin sector.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin is trading cautiously on the upside at $37,100 and a notable threshold at $38,000. Support levels at $35,835, $35,235 and $34,522 highlight potential stabilization points in the downtrend. Technical indicators present a mixed but slightly bullish scenario with RSI at 51 indicating a balanced sentiment. The 50-day EMA at $36,400 supports a short-term bullish trend. Chart analysis reveals a slight ascending channel, indicating a potential continuation of the bullish momentum. Overall, while favouring bullish trends above $36,400, the market remains cautious, with immediate resistance and support key for short-term moves and potential moves in the coming days.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cThe overall crypto market cap crossed the 1.4-trillion dollar mark with BTC and ETH leading the effort. ETH breached the $2,000 mark per piece due to the euphoria around the Blackrock spot Ethereum ETF application. BTC crossed the $37,000 mark over the weekend and the market is expected to ride the ETF wave in the coming weeks owing to the favourable macroeconomic conditions.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cOver the weekend, both BTC and ETH showed strength, each gaining more than 2.5 percent. This unexpected resilience during the usually quiet weekends might be because of the positive news about Javier Milei, a supporter of Bitcoin, winning the presidential election in Argentina. He sees Bitcoin as a way to return money to the private sector. Looking at the technical side, BTC has consistently bounced back from an important incline trendline support and the 20EMA Daily. Currently, it's trading a bit above $37,300, aiming for the next resistance at $38,000. As for ETH, it's sitting around the Support and resistance flip level of $2,011. Breaking through this could push the price to a major resistance level at $2,130, with ETH keeping above the 20-EMA Daily.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "title": "Rumours of Ethereum fraud 'bigger than FTX'? Where's Brenda from Bristol when we need her? - CityAM - City A.M.",
        "content": "Rumours of Ethereum fraud \u2018bigger than FTX\u2019? Where\u2019s Brenda from Bristol when we need her?\n\nI\u2019ll start with something for the meme lovers.\n\nDoes anyone remember Brenda from Bristol, who in response to a BBC interviewer\u2019s question, asking her what she thought about Theresa May\u2019s decision to call an early general election in 2017 only two years after the previous one in 2015, cried \u201cYou\u2019re joking \u2013 not another one!\u201d.\n\nNiche. But it\u2019s worth a watch.\n\nWell, I found myself crying \u201cNot another one!\u201d in a Brenda-esque fashion last week, when I read the headline that former Ethereum lawyer, Steven Nerayoff, claims that he is aware of a massive fraud at the centre of the Ethereum network, apparently \u201cbigger than the FTX fraud\u201d, and perpetrated by none other than the Ethereum founders themselves.\n\nAs yet, we have no idea as to the veracity of these allegations. However, Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s guilty verdict earlier this month, and multiple other high-profile collapses and bankruptcies allegedly caused by an underlying fraud, have fuelled the crypto naysayers\u2019 party line that the crypto world is comprised solely of scammers, fraudsters, and money launderers. \u201cFraud\u201d and \u201ccrypto\u201d are now inextricably linked in the minds of the public and in the press. A monumental fraud at the heart of Ethereum would add credence to the notion that crypto is or should be dead. Long live fiat.\n\nHowever, my response to that, continuing Brenda from Bristol\u2019s line of thinking, remains: \u201cOh for God\u2019s sake\u2026honestly, I can\u2019t stand this!\u201d.\n\nFiat is still the preferred medium for most financial crime, including fraud. Fraud perpetrated by any means remains the most common crime experienced in England & Wales, with 1.15 million fraud and computer misuse offences recorded in our fair land between 2022/23, the highest it has ever been.\n\nLegislation slipping under the corporate radar\n\nCue the government\u2019s latest efforts to tackle the fraud epidemic: the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 (ECCT), which came into force on 26 October. It introduces two major changes in the law:\n\nA new offence of \u2018failure to prevent fraud\u2019; and An expansion of the scope of individuals whose criminal conduct can be attributed to a company for economic crime under the \u2018identification principle\u2019.\n\nWhilst the crypto industry has been understandably focusing on the latest regulatory developments in the UK, including the implementation of the financial promotions regime with respect to crypto assets on October 8 2023, and the publication of the final proposals for crypto and stablecoin regulation on October 30 2023, this piece of legislation may have slipped under the corporate crypto radar.\n\nBut under the ECCT, big industry players need to have implemented \u201creasonable\u201d compliance procedures to prevent fraud, as a company can be found guilty of this offence where it failed to prevent fraud intended to benefit the company, committed by an \u201cassociated person\u201d, defined widely as an employee, agent or subsidiary; an employee of a subsidiary; or a person who \u201cotherwise performs services for or on behalf of the organisation\u201d.\n\nWhy do I say \u2018big\u2019 industry players? Because the ECCT only applies to companies if it, and/or its group, meet two or more of the following criteria:\n\nMore than 250 employees; More than GBP 36m turnover; or More than GBP 18m in total assets.\n\nGetting your house in order\n\nI can hear a small and medium sized cheer from the small and medium sized crypto start-ups, who perhaps may not yet have the compliance wherewithal to ensure that it has implemented such reasonable procedures to prevent fraud, although such organisations should have already ensured that their compliance programmes have adequate and reasonable policies and procedures in place to prevent and detect other offences, including other \u2018failure to prevent\u2019 offences of bribery and facilitation of tax evasion.\n\nCrucially, large overseas crypto asset service providers may think that the legislation does not apply to them, particularly if they do not have a UK subsidiary. However, the jurisdictional reach of the ECCT is such, that even if a non-UK crypto asset service provider did not have any subsidiaries in the UK, the overseas company could still be liable for failing to prevent fraud if an associated person (e.g. an employee or a person performing services on behalf of the non-UK bank) committed fraud under UK law or targeted UK victims, with the intention ultimately to benefit the overseas company. This could capture a whole host of large overseas industry players who haven\u2019t even set a corporate foot in the UK.\n\nThe organisation can defend itself if it has \u201creasonable procedures\u201d in place to prevent fraud. Guidance is still awaited from the government as to what such \u2018reasonable\u2019 procedures might look like. But compliance officers will certainly need to conduct an appropriate fraud risk assessment and implement commensurately \u2018reasonable\u2019 procedures across their UK operations or those acting on behalf of the business in the UK, in addition to those for other failure to prevent\u2019 offences, alongside, of course, its anti-money laundering and sanctions policies and procedures. And if all of this is news to you and you haven\u2019t got a compliance officer yet\u2026well you probably need to put an ad in the newspaper, stat.\n\nThe effect of the ECCT\u2019s expansion of the \u2018identification principle\u2019 is that the actions of a wider group of people (defined as \u2018senior managers\u2019) can be attributed to the organisation for certain economic crimes, including fraud, theft, false accounting and concealing criminal property. The idea of this is to make it easier for authorities to pursue corporates for those offences, as well as the individuals concerned.\n\nFor fraud practitioners, this is all exciting stuff. For corporates caught by the legislation, not so much. But the hope will be that this legislation coupled with the full implementation of the crypto UK regulatory regime will reduce my need to shout \u201cnot another one!\u201d a la Brenda from Bristol, and will allow the industry to thrive in the UK, as it should, without fraud being perceived as the driving force behind it.\n\nCharlotte Tregunna, Partner, Peters & Peters"

        "content": "In the not-so-distant past, the financial landscape witnessed a seismic shift with the advent of cryptocurrencies.\n\nBeginning with Bitcoin; digital assets have transcended from obscure experiments to formidable contenders in the global financial arena.\n\nAs the narrative of digital currencies unfolds, Ethereum emerges as a transformative force, not just as a currency but as a platform shaping the future of payment.\n\nEthereum took the concept of blockchain beyond a mere digital currency and introduced smart contracts \u2013 self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.\n\nThis groundbreaking innovation expanded the realm of possibilities, enabling developers to create decentralized applications (DApps) and fueling the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nGlobal Reach: Breaking Down Boundaries\n\nCryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, transcend geographical limitations. Unlike traditional payment methods restrained by borders and fluctuating exchange rates, embracing cryptocurrency opens the doors to a vast, borderless marketplace.\n\nYour business gains immediate access to a global customer base, tapping into markets that were once considered unreachable.\n\nThis borderless nature of cryptocurrency facilitates seamless transactions, making it an attractive option for international trade.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a small startup or an established enterprise, the ability to transact with customers from different corners of the globe enhances your market reach significantly.\n\nAmong the myriad of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has emerged as a frontrunner, distinguished by its smart contract capabilities and wide-ranging applications beyond just a digital currency.\n\nIncorporating Ethereum into your payment options not only adds a layer of sophistication to your transactions but also aligns your business with one of the most influential players in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nSmart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain automate and enforce agreements, streamlining complex processes and reducing the risk of fraud.\n\nThis level of transparency and efficiency is particularly appealing for businesses engaged in cross-border transactions, where trust and speed are paramount.\n\nCryptocurrency as the Future of Payments\n\nAs businesses worldwide recognize the potential of cryptocurrencies, the acceptance of digital assets, particularly Ethereum, is becoming a hallmark of forward-thinking enterprises.\n\nThe decentralized nature of these currencies ensures security, while the global reach provides unprecedented opportunities for growth.\n\nBy embracing cryptocurrency, your business positions itself at the forefront of a financial revolution, signaling to customers that you are not just adapting to change but actively shaping the future of commerce.\n\nThe inclusion of Ethereum in your payment options serves as a strategic move, aligning your business with a versatile and widely accepted digital currency.\n\nIt\u2019s factual to state that the era of cryptocurrency is upon us, and businesses that embrace this paradigm shift are reaping the rewards of a global customer base.\n\nEthereum, with its technological advancements and widespread acceptance, stands as a beacon in the world of digital currencies, offering your business not just a means of payment but a gateway to unparalleled global opportunities.\n\nIt\u2019s time to leverage the power of Ethereum and position your business at the forefront of the evolving landscape of finance."

        "content": "In the tumultuous crypto landscape, while global attention is often monopolized by Bitcoin, an in-depth analysis by 21Shares reveals that Ethereum is emerging as a resilient and growing player.\n\nDespite recent challenges, including a hacker attack, we will explore the remarkable recovery of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with a close look at the outstanding performance and partnerships that outline a promising future.\n\n21Shares: the In-Depth Analysis of Ethereum Performance\n\nIn recent times, the cryptocurrency landscape has been dominated by the narrative focused on Bitcoin, with its performance and growing reputation as a haven in times of instability in traditional financial markets.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that significant events, such as Ethereum recent recovery, could have equally significant impacts.\n\nDespite an overall loss of 7.82% recorded in the last week, the price of ETH showed a remarkable 12.54% increase in a single night, significantly surpassing previous figures.\n\nWhile the drop can be primarily attributed to a hacking attack, the positive developments can be traced back to the growing calls for the approval of an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) dedicated to this digital currency and the return to June\u2019s fee and \u201cburn rate\u201d levels.\n\nFactors favoring Ethereum positive momentum\n\nThe push for cryptocurrency has been fueled by the application for approval of an ETF by several companies, including Ark Invest and 21Shares itself, with significant buy-in from BlackRock, an $8.6 million asset manager.\n\nThese developments have triggered growing optimism among investors.\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s solid recovery is anchored by robust fundamentals, emancipating itself from contingent dynamics.\n\nProminent among the signs of recovery are rising base fees and the rising \u201cburn rate,\u201d which have returned to levels observed last June.\n\nThis indicates a general revitalization of on-chain activities. Despite the recent hacker attack against Poloniex, which resulted in the theft of more than $100 million in ETH, Ethereum\u2019s rally has not been halted.\n\nArkham Intelligence forecasts indicate the possibility of losses of up to 10%, but it is crucial to note that this has not weakened the cryptocurrency\u2019s consolidation process.\n\nPartnerships and projects involving the Ethereum network reflect its attractiveness. A significant example is the collaboration between NEAR and Polygon, which has led to multiple agreements to align their respective networks.\n\nThis effort is evident in the partnership with Polygon Lab, which offers Polygon CDK developers a wide range of options for creating customizable networks not bound by EVM standards.\n\nThe integration of advanced technologies, such as sharding, provides a distinctive advantage to both networks.\n\nThe increase in base fees is a clear sign of growing activity on the Ethereum platform. This phenomenon, combined with a rising \u201cburn rate,\u201d indicates rapid consumption of circulating ETH, confirming a general upswing in on-chain activity.\n\nThese indicators not only testify to the robustness of the network, but also suggest an increase in user and developer interest.\n\nThe recent hacker attack and possible losses\n\nThe recent hacker attack against Poloniex, although it generated concern and caused the loss of a considerable sum, did not significantly destabilize Ethereum\u2019s positive performance.\n\nIt is crucial to recognize that market reaction to such events can often be transient, especially when the underlying robustness of the blockchain is not compromised.\n\nArkham Intelligence forecasts indicate possible losses, but Ethereum\u2019s resilience could mitigate negative impacts in the medium term.\n\nIn addition, Ethereum\u2019s strategic partnerships with projects such as NEAR and Polygon underscore its prominent position in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThe partnership with Polygon Labs, in particular, offers advanced solutions to developers, enabling the creation of customizable networks.\n\nThis integration of cutting-edge technologies, such as sharding, represents a significant step toward evolving and optimizing network capabilities.\n\nIn closing, while Bitcoin remains a beacon in the cryptocurrency universe, detailed analysis of Ethereum reveals an equally interesting and potentially profitable narrative. The recent recovery, despite the challenges, is an indicator of Ethereum\u2019s fundamental soundness and the continued enthusiasm of investors and developers.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, Ethereum is positioned as a key player, poised to shape the future of this revolutionary financial technology."

        "title": "Ethereum Crosses $2,000 as Whales Trigger Quiet Accumulation After Two Months: ETH Price Faces Liquidation ... - Blockchain Reporter",
        "content": "In recent hours, the market experienced a modest recovery, with Bitcoin\u2019s price managing to climb above the $37,000 mark. In the wake of this development, Ethereum (ETH) also saw a significant increase, surpassing the $2,000 threshold, and is currently gearing up for a potential push beyond the $2,100 level. Nonetheless, as resistance levels are holding firm, there is a growing concern among large holders, or whales, who have been quietly accumulating assets for the first time in two months, hinting at a possible exit strategy.\n\nEthereum Triggers $12 Million In Short Liquidation\n\nOver the last 24 hours, ETH price made a surprising rebound and surged above $2,000. This has triggered massive liquidations on the chart, as revealed by Coinglass data. Nearly $12 million worth of short positions were liquidated after the price went against sellers\u2019 bearish bets below $1,900, strengthening immediate support levels.\n\nInterestingly, on-chain data, as pointed out by a prominent analyst, supports a bullish view of Ethereum price. Lately, Ethereum\u2019s price has been displaying a series of fluctuations, primarily heading in a downward direction. Although this might appear worrisome to the average observer, smart investors, particularly the significant players commonly referred to as \u2018whales,\u2019 perceive this as a valuable opportunity.\n\nA noteworthy pattern accompanying these price declines is the abrupt increase in non-exchange Ethereum balances and ETH accumulation. This trend signifies that instead of reacting with panic and hastily liquidating their holdings on exchanges, these prominent stakeholders are opting to accumulate more of the altcoin.\n\nFor the first time in two months, Ethereum addresses holding a balance exceeding 10,000 tokens or $20 million have been quietly increasing. This surge is strengthening Ethereum\u2019s current trajectory as buyers grow more confident in maintaining momentum above the $2,000 mark.\n\nIntense Battle Between ETH Buyers And Sellers\n\nThe Ethereum long/short ratio is presently in the midst of a fierce struggle between bullish and bearish sentiments. There\u2019s a rising possibility of ETH price facing liquidation if the bulls lose faith in breaching the $2,100 threshold. Recent data indicates that the long/short ratio stands at 0.9736, with buyers holding 49.3% of positions and sellers commanding 50.7% of positions.\n\nFurthermore, there seems to be declining interest among long-term whales as Ethereum\u2019s price struggles to break past the $2,100 mark. Information from IntoTheBlock shows a decline in whale transactions, plummeting from a peak of $6.6 billion to approximately $2.2 billion.\n\nThe likelihood of a sudden drop in Ethereum\u2019s price might not be substantial at this juncture, as BlackRock\u2019s proposal for a spot ETH ETF seems to be having a positive influence, potentially keeping the altcoin\u2019s price within an attractive buying range.\n\nHowever, the NVT (Network Value to Transactions) ratio has been on a somewhat ascending trajectory, currently standing at 78.83. This indicates that as the price of ETH surges, there is a concurrent rise in network value. However, in relation to this, Ethereum\u2019s transaction activity has remained relatively subdued this week, suggesting that the ETH price may be approaching overvaluation and could be poised for a correction around the $2.1K peak.\n\nShould the bulls manage to uphold the price above the critical threshold of $2,000, Ethereum (ETH) will regain its momentum and position itself for an imminent breakout from its symmetrical triangle pattern. Upon a successful breakout, the coin is poised to make a move to challenge its resistance level at $2,190 in the coming hours.\n\nHowever, on the bearish side, if sellers dominate and Ethereum can\u2019t surpass a key resistance level, its momentum might weaken, risking a drop to the $1,900 support if it breaks out of its current pattern."

        "title": "Blast is an Ethereum L2 with native yield for ETH and stablecoins - Get Invite for Blast Airdrop - Gizmo Times",
        "content": "So, a new chain has emerged, and this time, it comes with backing from the big names including Paradigm and Standard Crypto. It\u2019s called Blast, and they say, \u201cBlast is the first L2 that incorporates native yield. Your balance on Blast compounds automatically.\u201d\n\nBlast yield comes from ETH staking and RWA protocols. The yield from these decentralized protocols is passed back to Blast users automatically. The default interest rate on other L2s is 0%. On Blast, it\u2019s 4% for ETH and 5% for stablecoins.\n\nHere\u2019s how Blast works.\n\nAuto Rebasing\n\nUsers transact in ETH. Dapps are built around ETH. Blast was designed from the ground up so that ETH itself is natively rebasing on the L2.\n\nL1 Staking\n\nBlast only became possible this year following Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade. ETH yield from L1 staking, initially Lido, is automatically transferred to users via rebasing ETH on the L2.\n\nT-Bill Yield\n\nUsers who bridge stablecoins receive USDB, Blast\u2019s auto-rebasing stablecoin. The yield for USDB comes from MakerDAO\u2019s on-chain T-Bill protocol. USDB can be redeemed for USDC when bridging back to Ethereum.\n\nBlast contributors have raised $20m from Paradigm, Standard Crypto, eGirl Capital, Primitive Ventures, Andrew Kang, Hasu, Foobar, Blurr, Will Price, Hsaka, Santiago Santos, Larry Cermak, Manifold, Jeff Lo, and other crypto-natives.\n\nA quick comparison done on the website of Blast shows that it is better than Optimism and Arbitrum in terms of giving native yields, and it shares all the gas revenues with the developers on the chain, and there are substantial incentives to devs compared to what the devs on the other two chains get.\n\nRight now, users can bridge their funds to Blast, get an early entry into the Airdrop leaderboard, and invite friends to make a team that deposits at least 5 ETH in total, so that they qualify for the squad reward where the entire squad is rewarded with points. The Blast Community Airdrop is split between Early Access Members (50%) and Developers (50%). The ETH that you deposit right now is available for withdrawal in February 2024 when Blast Mainnet gets launched, and the actual distribution of Blast airdrop is going to happen in May 2024.\n\nIf you need invite codes for Blast, you can tweet reply to me @thecaptaingates and I will try to share a few as and when I get them from the squad. Make sure you RT the post that mentions Blast."
