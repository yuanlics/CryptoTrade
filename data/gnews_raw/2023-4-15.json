        "title": "Polygon zkEVM: Ethereum's Leading zkRollup Blockchain? - DailyCoin",
        "content": "With the Polygon zkEVM, Polygon (MATIC) is adding another weapon to its arsenal and reinstating its claim as the ultimate Ethereum (ETH) scaling ecosystem. Polygon\u2019s zkEVM network aims to offer users unmatched security and minimal gas fees, outperforming other scaling solutions.\n\nDespite their considerable resources, Polygon Labs isn\u2019t the first crypto team to release a zero-knowledge rollup to boast EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) functionality. In fact, on-chain metrics suggest that the Polygon zkEVM is playing catch-up, falling behind other players in the Layer-2 Race.\n\nIs the Polygon zkEVM truly the future of Ethereum scalability? How is the new network different from the existing Polygon PoS network?\n\nWhat Is Polygon zkEVM?\n\nPolygon zkEVM is a Layer-2 network that combines two powerful technologies to boost blockchain scalability and security. Using zero-knowledge proofs and industry-standard Ethereum Virtual Machine, the Polygon zkEVM is touted as \u2018the next big thing.\u2019\n\nSource: Twitter\n\nThe network was brought to life in March 2023 when Vitalik Buterin signed the first transaction on the new blockchain. Inspired by Neil Armstrong, the Ethereum co-founder etched \u201cA few million constraints for man, unconstrained scalability for mankind\u201d into the Polygon zkEVM mainnet forever.\n\nHow Does Polygon zkEVM Work?\n\nTo better understand how Polygon\u2019s shiny new blockchain works, let\u2019s briefly break down its two key features.\n\nZero-knowledge validity proofs are a creative way to show someone you know sensitive information without actually revealing the content of the information itself. This provides users greater security and privacy while taking advantage of a more scalable network.\n\nSource: Polygon Labs\n\nIn the case of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, zkRollups enable a network to batch up groups and transactions and prove they\u2019re valid without revealing what the transactions actually are. These transactions are sent back to the Ethereum blockchain, where they\u2019re settled using the network\u2019s famed security.\n\nIn its most basic terms, the Ethereum Virtual Machine is essentially the operating system of the Ethereum mainnet. It allows users to write smart contracts and deploy dApps and services on-chain. By running an EVM blockchains can host Ethereum-based applications. This helps users and developers interact with the network in a familiar environment.\n\nCombining these features, the Polygon zkEVM gives users the best of both worlds. They enjoy the scalability of a Layer-2 network and EVM-equivalence, with the privacy and security of Ethereum zkr ollup technology.\n\nPolygon zkEVM vs. Polygon PoS Mainnet\n\nWhile both networks aim to scale Ethereum, their methods are slightly different.\n\nPolygon PoS is a sidechain that is EVM-compatible. It runs parallel to the Ethereum mainnet and is secured by a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Gas fees on the network are paid in MATIC, the native token of the Polygon ecosystem.\n\nPolygon zkEVM is a network built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. It uses zero-knowledge architecture to speed up processing times while benefitting from the security of Ethereum\u2019s consensus. Gas fees are paid in ETH, not MATIC.\n\nInstead of being EVM-compatible, the network aims to be EVM-equivalent. Let me explain what this means.\n\nAccording to Polygon Labs, the ultimate goal is not EVM compatibility. Compatible means that the network can operate within the confines of Ethereum\u2019s broader ecosystem. Existing dApps and developer toolsets can still be ported over but might require slight code changes to avoid bugs.\n\nEVM equivalence suggests that Polygon zkEVM offers users an identical environment and experience while benefitting from improved scalability. Polygon Labs argues that the best way to scale Ethereum is to become its equal rather than simply operating within its limits.\n\nPolygon zkEVM Competitors\n\nFor all its hype and excitement, Polygon is not the only crypto project exploring zkEVM networks. ZkSync actually beat Polygon Labs to market and released their mainnet a few days before the Polygon zkEVM went live.\n\nOn-chain metrics indicate that zkSync is by far the more popular network. Within two weeks of the launch of both blockchains, zkSync has attracted $72M in TVL (Total Value Locked). In contrast, the Polygon zkEVM has only accrued $1M in TVL.\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nIn that wasn\u2019t enough, almost ten times more users have bridged over to zkSync compared to Polygon zkEVM. While zkSync is home to over 300,000 unique wallet addresses, the Polygon zkEVM mainnet beta is lagging behind with only 32,000 unique wallets.\n\nThough this could be considered a grim indicator for Polygon Labs, this staggering difference might be due to speculation around a possible zkSync token airdrop. Airdrop eligibility is often given to early supporters who bridge to new chains and provide liquidity in DeFi applications.\n\nIn any case, both zkRollups pale compared to other Ethereum scaling solutions. Optimistic rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism are clear winners in the Layer-2 adoption race, with millions of unique wallets and billions of dollars in TVL.\n\nWhat Can I Do On Polygon zkEVM?\n\nIf you\u2019re familiar with the Polygon PoS network or any other EVM blockchain, the Polygon zkEVM has similar use cases. The blockchain is used to store and transfer cryptocurrency in self-custodial accounts.\n\nThe network is also home to a variety of open-source DeFi applications like decentralized exchanges and lending platforms. NFT marketplaces are emerging, with several early collections vying for prominence in a relatively uncharted network.\n\nHow Do I Connect to Polygon zkEVM?\n\nHopping over to the Polygon zkEVM mainnet is easy and only takes 10-15 minutes. Head to the official Polygon zkEVM Bridge site and connect your Web3 wallet. The Polygon zkEVM RPC will usually automatically add and configure itself to your wallet.\n\nSource: Polygon zkEVM Bridge\n\nIf you\u2019re still struggling, head to Chainlist, search for Polygon zkEVM, and manually add the network to your wallet.\n\nRemember that the network uses ETH as a native gas token, so you\u2019ll need to bridge some Ether and keep some in reverse to pay your gas fees while you explore the network.\n\nPolygon zkEVM Pros and Cons\n\nLaunching an exciting new blockchain network always comes with overwhelming claims of \u2018revolutionary, new paradigms\u2019 and \u2018game-changing technology.\u2019 Let\u2019s cut through the noise and look at the facts.\n\nPros\n\nSolid reputation \u2013 Polygon Labs is one of the most reliable teams in the blockchain industry with a history of delivering high-quality products. They\u2019ve secured partnerships with some of the world\u2019s largest companies, like Starbucks and Meta,, and helped incubate hundreds of emerging crypto projects through ecosystem grants.\n\nEVM-equivalence \u2013 The network is EVM-equivalent, making it an ideal environment for users and developers to bridge over from Ethereum, the most popular Layer-1 blockchain.\n\nScalability \u2013 The zkEVM promises high transaction throughput and minuscule gas fees. According to Quicknode, users should enjoy transaction finality in 2-3 seconds and transaction costs of around $0.000084.\n\nZero-knowledge proofs \u2013 Zkproofs bring greater security and privacy to blockchain. Being able to validate transactions without needing to disclose sensitive details about the transaction opens many doors in decentralized finance.\n\nCons\n\nLow adoption rates \u2013 The launch of the Polygon zkEVM was a hotly anticipated catalyst for the Polygon ecosystem. However, the lack of users has arguably been anticlimactic. Polygon Labs needs to find some way of incentivizing network use.\n\nCompetitive niche \u2013 Ethereum scaling is one of the biggest pain points in the industry. Alternative zkEVM networks like zkSync dominate Polygon zkEVM regarding user adoption, while optimistic rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism are light-years ahead.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nAll the excitement and discussion shouldn\u2019t detract from what is arguably the largest service in the Polygon Labs ecosystem. The Polygon PoS sidechain is still one of the industry\u2019s largest networks, driving mass adoption through incredible partnerships with top Web2 companies.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nZero-knowledge validity proofs are certainly an innovative use of blockchain technology. The competition between Ethereum scaling solutions might be stiff. Still, Polygon Labs has a history of success, and despite a slow start, their zkEVM is expected to host exciting new applications in the Web 3 world.\n\nFAQs"

        "content": "Welcome to our latest cryptocurrency price analysis for April 15, 2023, where we take a closer look at Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve and mature, it\u2019s important to keep a close eye on the latest trends and developments. In this article, we will provide an in-depth analysis of the price movements of these three major cryptocurrencies, and discuss what the future may hold. Will crypto prices continue to rise? Or will we witness a short-term price adjustment?\n\nBitcoin Price Analysis for April 15, 2023\n\nBitcoin prices managed to start a renewed uptrend as prices bounced from the support price of $19,700. From there, Bitcoin prices increased by more than 50% in 1 month. Today, we see how the $31,000 price consists of a short-term resistance, sending prices slightly lower. We anticipate that prices will continue to retrace lower and enter the price zone between $28,000 and $29,000. However, prices should be able to rise back again and breach the 31K resistance.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis for April 15, 2023\n\nEthereum\u2019s chart looks very similar to Bitcoin\u2019s. This is no coincidence as Bitcoin\u2019s dominance in the crypto market rose back to 46%. This means that the price movement of Bitcoin influences other altcoins when its prices move either way. Ethereum price reached the high price of $2,115 and is looking to either consolidate or retrace lower. After a rise in prices from $1,850, ETH should retrace as part of a breather. We expect a similar price action as Bitcoin\u2019s, where ETH adjusts towards $1,950 briefly before continuing higher.\n\nXRP Price Analysis for April 15, 2023\n\nXRP prices started to rise after consolidating on the support price of $0.36 after lagging for quite a while. After extended consolidation, XRP prices shot high and increased by more than 60% within 2 weeks. XRP established a new support price at $0.50 and is on a new uptrend. From the current $0.52, XRP should be able to reach the psychological price of $0.60 and make 14%.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

        "title": "$1B staked ETH withdrawn in 24hrs as round 2 begins - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "According to on-chain data, the net value of Ethereum removed from staking has surpassed $1 billion in value over the past 24 hours, yet again showcasing the network\u2019s ability to perform live network-wide updates without issue.\n\nETH withdrawals in action\n\nA total of $1.7 billion has been withdrawn since the Shanghai and Capella upgrades went live. However, as round 2 of withdrawals began, the value of Ethereum withdrawn increased. Round 1 took 4.14 days to complete as validators in the queue were processed.\n\n18,442,455 ETH is currently staked, with a value of $38.5 billion as of press time. As a result,\n\nstaked ETH makes up 15.32% of the total supply, with 33% staked with Lido.\n\nWith withdrawals now open, investors have been withdrawing their initial capital and the earned rewards. Staked Ethereum earns interest over time, and when a validator earns over 32 ETH through rewards, the excess amount does not add to their principal. Instead, it gets withdrawn automatically as a reward payment every few days.\n\nThe chart below shows the vast difference between deposits and withdrawals (rewards and principal funds) since the upgrade.\n\nRewards\n\nStaking rewards began around 15% and were put on a predefined falling curve relative to the number of validator participants until the Merge when the network took over. The current validator reward is 4.33%, including consensus rewards and transaction fees. These rewards spiked to around 5.2% in the days leading up to the upgrade but have since returned to their downward trajectory. Total staking rewards have fallen by 1.4% since the Merge last September when they jumped to 5.8% from 4.3%.\n\nIn addition to the change in deposits, withdrawals, and rewards, the average value of Ethereum staked with validators has reduced since withdrawals opened. As a result, 54.3% of stakers are now in profit with ETH around $2,000.\n\nBullish momentum\n\nUltimately, both the Shanghai and Capella upgrades appear to have been a success, as the network is processing new deposits, principal withdrawals, and reward payments without any significant issues. Furthermore, these actions are being performed on a volume of billions of dollars worth of Ethereum daily.\n\nWhile blockchain networks can certainly still be considered to be in beta in many ways, Ethereum\u2019s ability to undertake such enormous undertakings of live network upgrades without issue is highly encouraging for our burgeoning industry."

The snapshots essentially record the transactions being executed and deployed by the user at a given time.\n\n\u201cThe snapshot feature is particularly useful in the following two scenarios: When a user wants to run multiple times of a testing script, he/she just needs to revert to the original snapshot and rerun the script. [Or] When a user wants to save some states and return to them later, he/she can create a snapshot and then revert to this snapshot later,\u201d the manual reads.\n\nPhalcon Fork also has an integrated faucet so users can acquire free fork network Ether (ETH) to conduct transactions on the private chains.\n\nTo directly interact with the chains and execute transactions, Phalcon Fork provides a remote procedure call node called Fork RPC, which can be integrated with Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible development frameworks such as Hardhat, Foundry and Remix or added to MetaMask.\n\nAs it stands, users can only fork from the Ethereum mainnet; however, future support for additional blockchains, such as the BNB Smart Chain and Arbitrum, has been teased.\n\nTeased blockchain support additions.

        "title": "#CryptoExplained: The Wonderful World of Ethereum - Rolling Stone India",
        "content": "As Ethereum prepares for its latest upgrade, it\u2019s a good time to look at the second biggest crypto currency by market cap after Bitcoin. In fact, the Ethereum Ecosystem as a whole is very likely more valuable than the Bitcoin ecosystem even though the currency is only second, because the vast majority of Financial Assets in crypto, exist on Ethereum. Tokens, NFT\u2019s, DAO\u2019s, decentralized exchanges and more, are all innovations that first took hold in the Ethereum ecosystem and have come to dominate the Crypto economy. In this series of articles, we will explore the Ethereum ecosystem and why it could become the base layer of trust on the internet.\n\nSo what exactly is Ethereum? Ethereum is a blockchain based decentralized system like bitcoin, and its native currency is called Eth. The Bitcoin network is very specialized and is primarily focused on being a decentralized method of exchanging value in the form of the Bitcoin token. Ethereum on the other hand is focused on being a world computer. This means that not only does it have the ability to transfer value, but it also allows the creation of smart contracts that are immutable and trustless. Smart contracts that are run by a decentralized computer form the basis of the wonderful world of ethereum.\n\nAny normal person would wonder why we need to run smart contracts on a decentralized network? We need this for the same reason we need transactions recorded by decentralized computers (see my article on Bitcoin). Trust.\n\nA smart contract is simply a set of instructions that a computer can understand. A smart contract that is stored and run by the Ethereum decentralized system means that it will run anywhere in the world, any time, by any one, exactly the way it was written. This is because the smart contract is checked by thousands of computers around the world to ensure that it has not been changed. This is different from a piece of code run on a centralized system that can be changed by the person running it without anyone knowing it.\n\nSo we can trust that a smart contract that was written to allocate assets in specific ways will always do that. For example, a Will written in the form of a smart contract will always transfer funds the way the writer intended. Imagine a Warren Buffet of the crypto world who wanted to make sure his wealth was transferred to charities on his death. Warren could write a smart contract that included the addresses of the charities and the amounts each would receive. He would publish it on the network. Once the contract detects that Warren has passed away, it automatically transfers the assets to these charities. No lawyers, no arbitration, and no family members tampering with the will.\n\nSmart contracts form the basis of most things we consider to be innovations in crypto. Tokens for example are created using the ERC-20 smart contract. This is a specific type of ethereum contract that specifies how the features of a token are to be constructed. This standard is the reason so many coins exist. The vast majority of \u2018Crypto Currencies\u2019 are actually ERC-20 tokens that run on Ethereum. This means that transactions with these currencies are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain and not a blockchain specific to the token. This also means that you can create your own crypto currency in less than 10 minutes. Try it out at https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/wizard\n\nNFT\u2019s, DAO\u2019s, and decentralized exchanges also use smart contracts to operate. And thanks to these we have things like Crypto Kitties, Nouns DAO, Uniswap, and Crypto Punks. The wonderful world of ethereum has created innovations the world has never seen before that is turning finance, law, and value transfer on its head. And it is poised to continue to do so."

        "title": "With Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) Rallying How Does Their Growth Compare To New Deflationary Meme Coin ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Over the past few years, meme coins have taken the crypto industry by storm by offering ways for investors to generate huge profits from tokens that seem to have no intrinsic value.\n\nHowever, as we move into 2023, many meme tokens with exciting prospects and real-world utility are now providing limitless growth opportunities.\n\nOne of these meme tokens with an exciting prospect is DigiToads, a recent toad-featuring token revolutionizing the crypto industry with its deflationary, utility-rich, community-oriented features.\n\nCompared to major crypto projects like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), DigiToads (TOADS) has proven to be a high-growth token.\n\nIn this article, we are going to look at the new token, DigiToads (TOADS), as it compares to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nDigiToads (TOADS)\n\nDigiToads (TOADS) is a deflationary meme coin with a focus on real-world utility. DigiToads is a high-growth token. And holders of its native token, TOADS, will earn residual income through NFT staking and P2E gaming.\n\nThe DigiToads\u2019 P2E Gaming features an exciting web3 game that allows players to collect, nurture and battle other unique DigiToads.\n\nEach DigiToad has its own characteristics, giving players a wide range of options. Players will acquire these DigiToads by buying, trading, or winning them.\n\nPlayers will have the opportunity to make their DigiToads the strongest in the swamp arena. They can achieve this by using their TOADS tokens to purchase food and training equipment for their DigiToads.\n\nThese items will help their DigiToads learn new abilities, increase their size and strength, thereby helping the players compete better in battles against other players.\n\nAt the end of the DigiToads season, which lasts for one month, the platform allocates 50% of the funds raised from sales to the prize fund and distributes it among the top 25% of players. This provides the players with an opportunity to earn real money while enjoying the game.\n\nThe DigiToads ecosystem also incorporates NFT staking. This is a well-designed system that guarantees that the community is always rewarded.\n\nThe platform ensures that 2% of every TOADS transaction is put into the staking pool allowing users who stake their NFTs to get rewards depending on how much time their tokens are staked.\n\nDigiToads also plans to support the Amazon rainforest, home to many species of toads and frogs. The platform will donate 2.5% of the money raised from its sales to charities dedicated to replanting trees and preserving the rainforest.\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is a decentralized digital currency which one can use to purchase, sell, and exchange directly with other users without any intermediary.\n\nThe token\u2019s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, said that there is the need for \u201can electronic payment system based on crypto proof instead of trust.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is open-source; nobody owns or controls it, and everyone can participate. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate without any need for a central authority; managing transactions is carried out by the network.\n\nThrough its special properties, Bitcoin includes many exciting features not covered by previous payment systems.\n\nSince its launch, Bitcoin has risen dramatically in value. Although it once sold for under $10 per token, as of April 11, one BTC sells for about $30,000.\n\nBecause its supply is limited to only 21 million tokens, many crypto experts expect Bitcoin\u2019s price to keep rising, especially as more big investors begin to treat it as digital gold to hedge against market inflation and volatility.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum (ETH) is an open-source blockchain developed in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, who wanted a project that would deliver much more possibilities against Bitcoin\u2019s design for storing and transferring money.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s thinking was: if one can use blockchain technology to decentralize money, why can\u2019t we use the same blockchain to decentralize other things?\n\nEthereum introduced the decentralized app (DApp) system, enabling developers to create applications that expanded the use of blockchain to many uses.\n\nThe Ethereum network is the leading system for the nascent decentralized finance (DeFi). The system aids smart contracts in executing secure financial transactions. Smart contracts allow decentralized applications to run automatically on the blockchain when specific predetermined conditions are met.\n\nThe supply of ETH is infinite, and there are currently more than 121 million in circulation. The 2022 Ethereum \u201cMerge\u201d will dramatically slow the creation of new tokens and possibly make Ether deflationary.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe TOADS token is a high-growth asset that offers tremendous growth opportunities for investors to earn passive income through holding the tokens, NFT staking, and P2E gaming.\n\nDigiToads presale for the TOADS has just started, with over $1.2m raised so far. The token is currently selling at the price of $0.016.\n\nThis is an excellent opportunity for early investors to achieve higher returns on their investment as the presale will go through ten stages, with the token\u2019s price increasing at each stage.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Testnets in Crypto: How To Use Test Networks to Earn Cryptocurrency - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Testnets are the unsung heroes of the crypto world. Every time a shiny new blockchain, cryptocurrency, or dApp goes live, it\u2019s almost guaranteed that it has already existed for months on a test network.\n\nLike a shadowy vigilante, testnets expose hidden vulnerabilities and protect the cryptocurrency ecosystem. What many people don\u2019t know about testnets is that there is a litany of benefits to using and exploring them, even if you\u2019re not a developer.\n\nHow is something designed to be valueless so valuable?\n\nWhat are blockchain testnets? Why should everyone use them, and how can I get started?\n\nWhat are Testnets?\n\nA testnet is a valueless, low-risk sandbox environment similar to a main network. Blockchain engineers and smart contract developers use testnets to trial the functionality of their protocols and decentralized applications before deploying them on a mainnet or live blockchain.\n\nBecause a testnet is a separate ledger from its main network, all coins and tokens have no value. Regardless of the market price of Bitcoin (BTC), testnet bitcoin should always be worth $0. As a result, all transaction fees on a testnet are essentially free.\n\nThis is important for DeFi developers on networks like Ethereum (ETH), infamous for expensive gas fees. The Ethereum testnet enables developers to send thousands of transactions for free, which would normally cost tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nWhat Is the Purpose of Test Networks?\n\nThe main purpose of a testnet is to trail contracts and applications in a free environment. This helps developers ensure their applications run smoothly but also helps expose vulnerabilities and potential security issues.\n\nCybersecurity attacks in the crypto space are commonplace, with the on-chain world of DeFi and NFTs being particularly hazardous. White-hat hackers and security auditors use blockchain testnets to find potential faults before contracts get deployed on the mainnet, where an exploit could cost developers, and users like you and me, millions of dollars.\n\nThe cost of failure of a main network like Ethereum or XRP could be devastating. Hence, developers need a secure, valueless environment to make mistakes and break things safely before the public uses them.\n\nDo Testnet Coins Have Any Value?\n\nRemember when I said earlier that testnet coins have no value? The truth is, it\u2019s not so black and white.\n\nDevelopers still need testnet coins, like Goerli Ethereum (gETH), to pay \u2018transaction fees\u2019 on the testnet. That means they still have some demand from developers testing decentralized applications.\n\nTestnet coins are collected from faucets, or free sites that \u2018drip\u2019 small amounts of test cryptocurrency into a testnet wallet. During periods of high demand, these faucets actually empty their supply of testnet coins, making them a hot commodity on the crypto market. For a brief moment, gETH was trading at over $1.\n\nIn February, a bridge opened between the Goerli Ethereum Testnet and the Ethereum Mainnet. Developers needing gETH can buy testnet Ethereum if the faucets are empty or unavailable.\n\nYou can\u2019t trade gETH on a crypto exchange like Binance or Coinbase, but decentralized exchanges like UniSwap aren\u2019t bound by the same restrictions as their centralized alternatives.\n\nThis was great news for developers and testnet faucet farmers who\u2019ve been collecting gETH for free over time. In fact, one savvy player could even play a Cryptopunk NFT worth over $100,000 with gETH they accumulated for free.\n\nUltimately, testnet coins are intended to be free for everyone and have zero value on the market. That doesn\u2019t mean that there is no demand and that testnet crypto is worthless.\n\nWhy You Should Use a Testnet, Even If You\u2019re Not a Blockchain Developer\n\nEven if buying a Cryptopunk for free isn\u2019t enough of an incentive, the non-developers out there might be thinking:\n\n\u2018That\u2019s all very interesting, but what does that mean for me, a humble crypto enthusiast?\u2019\n\nThere are plenty of benefits to using a testnet, even if you aren\u2019t building dApps or designing blockchains. Many emerging crypto projects ask community members to trial products on a testnet in exchange for rewards, like token airdrops.\n\nFor example, the Aptos Incentivized Testnet gave anywhere between 150-300 APT tokens to selected users who operated a node validator or minted an NFT on their testnet. These tasks didn\u2019t take long to complete, and participants could claim an airdrop worth over $5,000 at Aptos\u2019 all-time high price.\n\nHow Do I Access A Testnet?\n\nThe good news is that accessing a blockchain testnet is easy. Metamask is a great open-source testnet wallet for any EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) network, like Polygon.\n\nAll you need to do is visit a trusted site like Chainlist and connect your wallet. Then, check the box to \u2018Include Testnets\u2019 and search for your chosen network, and the site will automatically configure your testnet account for you.\n\nWhich Blockchain Networks Have a Testnet?\n\nAlmost every blockchain in the cryptocurrency industry uses a testnet of some description. That includes leading Layer-1 networks like Solana and Cardano.\n\nSome networks, like Ethereum, have multiple different test networks for different areas of development. You must make sure you\u2019re connecting to the right network for your specific testing requirements, or else you might run into some errors.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nBlockchain testnets are an obscure area of the crypto industry. As a result, you may find the occasional scammer who will try and confuse you into sending your real crypto for valueless testnet coins.\n\nAs always, take extra care when exploring the possibilities of a blockchain testnet and never give anyone your crypto or seed phrase.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nEven if you\u2019re not a developer, using a blockchain testnet can make you eligible for generous airdrops and give you a better understanding of how certain blockchains and decentralized applications work for free.\n\nFAQs"

        "content": "According to the latest crypto news, analysts are moving towards Collateral Network (COLT), Ethereum (ETH) and Enjin Coin (ENJ), as they see them as investments with the best potential.\n\nHowever, Collateral Network (COLT) outshines both Ethereum (ETH) and Enjin Coin (ENJ) even at stage 2 of its public presale, with predictions of incredible gains of 3500%.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCollateral Network (COLT)\n\nAs crypto tides turn, investors remain confident that Collateral Network (COLT) is the best new crypto project on the market. COLT offers huge real-world utility and is set to revolutionize the crowdlending industry forever.\n\nWith Collateral Network (COLT), users can use physical assets to unlock liquidity. Those assets can include real estate, luxury items, watches, vintage cars, etc. Collateral Network (COLT) will use the real-world assets mentioned and mint NFTs that represent them which are 100% asset-backed, allowing lenders to finance the loans by buying a fraction of the fractionalized NFT.\n\nFor example, a person can put their luxury watch as collateral for a loan. Collateral Network (COLT) will then get the watch from that person and turn it into an NFT and sell it in fractions. Then, lenders can buy fractions of the NFT to earn interest. Once the borrower repays the loan, COLT will burn the NFT and redeem the watch from its vault.\n\nAt the moment, Collateral Network (COLT) is in stage 2 of its public presale. Even so, experts believe it is on the path to seeing a 3500% growth, which will bring 35x gains to all Collateral Network (COLT) holders.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nWith the Shanghai update around the corner, investors have been moving around the Ethereum (ETH) space with extreme caution. Ethereum (ETH) investors and analysts anticipate increased volatility in the coin as soon as the Ethereum (ETH) Shanghai update is live.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum (ETH) is sitting at $1,874.08 for one token, a 2.35% decrease in the last 24 hours. In addition, the Ethereum (ETH) market cap is also down by 2.22% over the previous 24 hours, along with the trading volume of Ethereum (ETH), which is down by 14.53%.\n\nSo, at this moment, Ethereum (ETH) investors are decreasing their trades, expecting that prices will continue to go down.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEnjin Coin (ENJ)\n\nEnjin Coin (ENJ) is facing some mixed feelings from investors at the moment, with some believing that the token will face a bullish market and anticipate increases in the Enjin Coin (ENJ) prices. On the other hand, other Enjin Coin (ENJ) investors are predicting a further decrease in the prices and trading volume of the Enjin Coin (ENJ) token.\n\nAt the moment, Enjin Coin (ENJ) is priced at $0.4136 for one ENJ token, a 4.96% decrease in the past 24 hours. Consequently, the Enjin Coin (ENJ) market cap is also experiencing a decrease of 4.62% in the past 24 hours, while the Enjin Coin (ENJ) trading volume is down by 10.42% in the past 24 hours.\n\nLearn out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Is Ethereum staking a potential threat to user privacy? - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "The Ethereum staking process, which involves validators locking up a specific amount of Ether (ETH) to support the network\u2019s security and earn rewards, has come under scrutiny for its potential IP address privacy issues. Stakeholders in the Ethereum network have raised concerns that the requirement for validators to connect via an Ethereum client exposes their IP addresses, which could reveal their location and identity and pose a security risk.\n\nEthereum staking explained\n\nStaking generally entails securing a certain quantity of cryptocurrency or tokens as collateral to participate in a network and receive rewards. The level of anonymity and privacy for stakers depends on the staking mechanism and platform being used. In some instances, staking necessitates the use of a public IP address, which could disclose the staker\u2019s location and other identifying information. This raises concerns for those who prioritize privacy and wish to remain anonymous while staking.\n\nNumerous staking platforms and protocols implement measures to protect user privacy. Some employ techniques such as onion routing or encryption to obscure the staker\u2019s IP address and maintain anonymity. Additionally, certain platforms enable the use of VPNs or other privacy-oriented tools to enhance anonymity further.\n\nEthereum staking requires validators to hold a specific amount of ETH in a designated wallet to support the network\u2019s security and earn rewards. Validators are responsible for verifying transactions, proposing new blocks, and securing the network by locking up a minimum amount of ETH as collateral. While Ethereum staking provides numerous benefits to the network, it has raised concerns about IP address privacy.\n\nEvery computer participating in the Ethereum network must have a unique IP address to facilitate communication between nodes. Validators must connect to the network and perform their duties using an Ethereum client, such as Prysm, Lighthouse, or Teku. These clients utilize the validator\u2019s IP address to communicate with the network and exchange information.\n\nPrivacy at stake\n\nIP addresses, while crucial for network communication, can reveal the location and identity of the validator. Hackers or malicious actors could exploit IP addresses to launch attacks or gain unauthorized access to a validator\u2019s system. Additionally, governments or law enforcement agencies could use IP addresses to locate validators involved in illegal activities.\n\nRecent criticisms focus on Ethereum (ETH), which underwent a hard fork not long ago. An Ethereum Foundation researcher disclosed that ETH stakers\u2019 IP addresses are monitored as part of a broader metadata set, sparking privacy concerns. Consequently, individuals must research and understand the privacy implications of any staking platform or protocol they are considering using to mitigate these risks."
