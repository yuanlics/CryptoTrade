        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission delayed its deadline to make a decision on Fidelity's proposal for a spot Ethereum ETH +1.07% exchange-traded fund until March 5, according to a filing on Thursday.\n\n\"The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,\" the SEC said.\n\nFidelity applied for the Fidelity Ethereum Fund in November, noting in its proposal a court ruling last year where judges said the SEC failed to find a coherent reason on why it should reject spot crypto ETFs when it had allowed futures-based products.\n\nThe SEC will now have more time to decide whether to approve, disapprove or institute proceedings.\n\nDelay had been expected\n\nBloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart said the SEC's move to delay was expected.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\n\"Fidelity #ethereum ETF delayed just now. Completely expected. Dates that really matter are late May in my view,\" Seyffart wrote in a post on X.\n\nThe SEC last week authorized 11 spot bitcoin ETFs to begin trading, sparking some in the industry to wonder if a spot Ethereum ETF is next.\n\nFidelity joined fellow giant BlackRock late last year in the race for a spot Ethereum ETF. A month before those firms applied for the spot products, ether futures ETFs went live.\n\n\"The fact that they allowed listing of the futures based ETFs is enough to say they are thinking about ether the same way they are thinking about bitcoin and you can infer from that they're probably thinking it's not a security and not going to regulate it that way,\" Stuart Barton, co-founder at Volatility Shares, said last week."

        "content": "Ethereum price struggled to rise above $2,550 and $2,580. ETH started a fresh decline like Bitcoin and traded below the $2,500 support zone.\n\nEthereum attempted a fresh increase but failed to surpass $2,550.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,480 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair continue to move down if there is a move below the $2,425 support.\n\nEthereum Price Extends Decline\n\nEthereum price struggled to gain pace for a move above the $2,550 and $2,580 resistance levels. ETH formed a short-term top and started a fresh decline below $2,500 like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a move below the $2,450 level. A new weekly low was formed near $2,424 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the $2,450 level, but the bears were active near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,614 swing high to the $2,424 low.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $2,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,465 level. The next hurdle could be $2,480. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,480 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nThe next major resistance is now near $2,520. A clear move above the $2,520 level might start a decent increase. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $2,580 level.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next key hurdle sits near the $2,620 zone. A close above the $2,620 resistance could start another steady increase. The next key resistance is near $2,680. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2,720 zone.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,520 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,440 level.\n\nThe next key support could be the $2,425 zone. A downside break below the $2,425 support might send the price further lower. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,350 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,320 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,425\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,520\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Since the BTC ETF narrative gripped the market last year, traders have been looking at ether as the next likely candidate to get a spot ETF approval in the U.S. Reflecting this sentiment is the discount to net asset value (NAV) for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which has been contracting since the summer, and has lingered around 12% over the last two months, according to JPMorgan."

        "content": "Fidelity\u2019s quest to launch a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) has hit a regulatory roadblock as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) extended its decision window.\n\nFidelity\u2019s Wise Origin Ethereum Trust, if approved, is a fund that would track the performance of Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. It would allow investors to gain exposure to digital assets without directly owning them.\n\nAccording to James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg, the SEC may choose to approve a batch of spot Ethereum ETFs as it did with Bitcoin. Seyffart pointed to May 23 as the next key date, the deadline for the regulator\u2019s decision on VanEck\u2019s Ethereum ETF application.\n\nThe SEC approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs last week, allowing such funds to be traded for the first time in the U.S. Before the approvals, the SEC rejected all spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nEther price outshined Bitcoin\u2019s price following the approvals surging past US$2,600 for the first time since May 2022, CoinGecko data shows. Ether has since fallen, losing 7% over the past week to US$2,436 at 12:30 p.m. ET. Bitcoin dropped 6.4% in the same period to trade at US$40,642.\n\nFidelity\u2019s Bitcoin ETF, one the funds that received the SEC\u2019s green light last week, crossed the US$1 billion today, becoming the second to do so, The Block reported."

        "content": "Blobs are live on Goerli.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Goerli testnet successfully forked to \u201cDencun,\u201d featuring the \u201cProto-Danksharding\u201d EIP-4844 innovation.\n\nThat paves the way for two more major testnet forks, keeping on schedule, for now, a further move to Ethereum mainnet by the end of March.\n\nThe consensus coming out of Thursday\u2019s All Core Devs meeting was to prepare a new software version by mid-next week. This could be used for both the Sepolia and Holesky testnets, slated for Jan. 30 and Feb. 7, respectively.\n\nDencun\u2019s concept of \u201cblobs\u201d is a key component of the upgrade, and refers to a large piece of data that is not directly included in an Ethereum block but is instead referenced by the block.\n\nBy including extra data for transactions, Ethereum will better serve rollups that use mainnet for data availability. Rollups are expected to see around a 90% cost savings, which they will pass on to users in the form of cheaper transactions.\n\nRead more: Dencun and Pralectra: Ethereum core devs chart an ambitious 2024\n\nEven though the data in blobs is stored off-chain, the integrity and availability of this data are still maintained. Blobs are designed to be cryptographically secure, ensuring that the data they reference is immutable and verifiable.\n\nClient diversity wins the day\u2026again\n\nA minor consensus issue in the popular Prysm client caused the forked chain to encounter difficulty finalizing blocks.\n\nTerence Tsao, protocol developer at Offchain Labs, which develops the Prysm client, estimated the resulting delay at about four hours while the team patched the problem.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\n\u201cWhen Prysm upgraded from Capella to Deneb state, we kept the historical route empty instead of carrying it over, so this issue was fairly easy to find,\u201d Tsao told colleagues on the ACD call.\n\nThe bug didn\u2019t show up in the many Devnets (developer networks) run over the past few months because these are forked from testnets and contain insufficient history to trigger the issue.\n\n\u201cThis is one of those very rare edge cases,\u201d Tsao said. \u201cI\u2019m thankful for Goerli, because otherwise we probably wouldn\u2019t have caught it until later.\u201d\n\nPrysm now operates on less than 40% of Ethereum network nodes, so the resulting drop in validating participation rates, if it happened on mainnet, would be bad, but not catastrophic.\n\nIn fact, a similar incident occurred in May, showcasing the benefit of client diversity.\n\nRead more: Ethereum devs issue final report on finality SNAFU\n\nGoerli itself is scheduled to be retired following this month. The Ethereum Foundation and other developers have been encouraging users to transition to the newer Sepolia testnet, which will serve as the primary testnet for dapp developers in preparation for Goerli to be shut down.\n\nAnother testnet, Holesky, launched in September 2023 and is intended more for infrastructure and protocol development.\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s Hole\u0161ky testnet launch hits a speed bump\n\nThe Prysm bug was the only major client issue observed in the wake of the fork, and one which can be easily avoided in the future according to Danny Ryan, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, who nevertheless called it \u201ca failure\u201d that \u201cshould be caught way upstream.\u201d\n\nRyan said he intends to spend some time \u201cmaking sure there\u2019s nothing else funky on the fork boundary test.\u201d\n\nClient teams expressed no reservations about sticking to the previously outlined release and testnet schedule, pending the results of the next fork in less than two weeks\u2019 time.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

It\u2019s similar to Bitcoin but with added functionalities, such as the ability to build decentralized applications, also known as dApps.\n\nthat enables the creation and execution of smart contracts. It\u2019s similar to Bitcoin but with added functionalities, such as the ability to build decentralized applications, also known as dApps. Ethereum, often referred to as the world computer , has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential to revolutionize various industries, including finance, supply chain management, and even online gambling.\n\n, has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential to revolutionize various industries, including finance, supply chain management, and even online gambling. With its robust infrastructure and advanced features, Ethereum provides a solid foundation for the development of innovative and transparent gambling platforms.\n\nNow that we have a basic understanding of Ethereum, let\u2019s delve deeper into how Ethereum casinos work. Ethereum casinos leverage the power of smart contracts to offer transparent and provably fair gambling experiences. These smart contracts act as the backbone of the casino, ensuring that every transaction is secure and tamper-proof.\n\nWhen a player interacts with an Ethereum casino, they are essentially interacting with a smart contract. This smart contract contains the rules and logic of the game, eliminating the need for a centralized authority to oversee the gambling process.\n\nThe transparency of the blockchain ensures that all transactions and outcomes can be verified by anyone, providing a level of trust that traditional online casinos often lack.\n\nOne of the key advantages of Ethereum casinos is the ability to verify the fairness of the games. Traditional online casinos rely on random number generators (RNGs) to determine game outcomes. However, these RNGs are often centralized and can be manipulated by the casino operator. In contrast, Ethereum casinos use cryptographic algorithms to generate random numbers, making it virtually impossible for the casino to cheat or manipulate the results.\n\nEthereum casinos offer a higher level of security compared to their traditional counterparts. With traditional online casinos, players often have to trust the casino operator with their funds, leaving them vulnerable to hacks or mismanagement. In contrast, Ethereum casinos store funds in smart contracts, which are secured by the blockchain\u2019s robust encryption. This means that players have full control over their funds and can be confident that their money is safe.\n\nAnother exciting aspect of Ethereum casinos is the ability to earn and use cryptocurrency within the gambling ecosystem. Many Ethereum casinos have their own native tokens eg ( RollBit & Lucky Block), which can be used for betting, receiving bonuses, or even participating in the governance of the platform. This adds an extra layer of utility and value to the gambling experience, allowing players to benefit from the growth of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nEthereum casinos offer a new and innovative approach to online gambling. By leveraging the power of smart contracts and the transparency of the blockchain, these casinos provide a secure and fair gambling environment. With the ability to verify game outcomes, enhanced security measures, and the integration of cryptocurrency, Ethereum casinos are poised to disrupt the traditional online gambling industry.\n\nBenefits of Using Ethereum in Online Casinos\n\nThere are several advantages to using Ethereum in online casinos. Let\u2019s explore a few:\n\nSpeed and Efficiency\n\nOne of the key advantages of using Ethereum in online casinos is the speed at which transactions can be processed. Unlike traditional payment methods, which may take days to settle, Ethereum transactions are almost instantaneous. This means that you can start playing your favorite casino games in no time!\n\nImagine you\u2019re sitting at home, eager to try your luck at an online slot machine. With Ethereum, you won\u2019t have to wait for hours or even days for your deposit to be confirmed. Instead, the transaction will be processed within seconds, and you can start spinning those reels right away. The fast and efficient nature of Ethereum transactions ensures that you won\u2019t miss a single moment of the gaming excitement.\n\nSecurity and Anonymity\n\nWhen it comes to online gambling, security and anonymity are of utmost importance. Ethereum casinos provide an added layer of security by leveraging the decentralized nature of the blockchain. Every transaction made on the Ethereum network is recorded on multiple computers, making it nearly impossible for hackers to manipulate or tamper with the data.\n\nFurthermore, since Ethereum transactions don\u2019t require you to enter personal information, your identity remains anonymous, protecting your privacy. This anonymity is especially crucial for those who prefer to keep their gambling activities private. With Ethereum, you can enjoy the thrill of online gambling without worrying about your personal information falling into the wrong hands.\n\nLower Transaction Fees\n\nTransaction fees can quickly eat into your gambling budget. With Ethereum casinos, you can say goodbye to hefty transaction fees. Since Ethereum operates on a peer-to-peer network, the fees associated with transactions are significantly lower compared to traditional payment methods.\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re a frequent online gambler who enjoys playing various casino games. With traditional payment methods, you may have to pay a substantial amount in transaction fees over time. However, with Ethereum, the fees are minimal, allowing you to allocate more of your funds towards actual gameplay. This means more spins, more bets, and ultimately, more chances to win big!\n\nCriteria for Ranking Ethereum Casinos\n\nWhen it comes to ranking Ethereum casinos, we consider several factors to ensure a comprehensive evaluation. Here are some of the criteria we take into account:\n\nCasino Reputation and Trustworthiness\n\nAbove all, we prioritize your safety. We thoroughly research the reputation and trustworthiness of each Ethereum casino before placing them on our top picks list.

We delve deep into the history of each casino, looking for any red flags or concerns that may affect your gaming experience. We believe that trust is the foundation of any successful casino, and we want to ensure that you can play with peace of mind.\n\nAdditionally, we consider the licensing and regulatory compliance of each casino. It is important to us that the casinos we recommend operate within the legal framework and adhere to industry standards. This ensures that you are playing in a fair and secure environment.\n\nVariety of Games Offered\n\nA good Ethereum casino should offer a wide range of games to cater to all types of players. From classic table games like blackjack and roulette to modern slots and live dealer games, variety is key. We assess the game selection of each casino to ensure that you have a plethora of options to choose from.\n\nOur team of experts examines the quality and diversity of games available at each Ethereum casino. We look for popular titles from reputable software providers, as well as unique and innovative games that can enhance your gaming experience.

In today\u2019s fast-paced world, being able to play your favorite casino games on the go is essential. We evaluate the mobile compatibility of each casino, ensuring that you can enjoy seamless gameplay on your smartphone or tablet.\n\nQuality of Customer Support\n\nCustomer support can make or break your experience at an Ethereum casino. We test the responsiveness and helpfulness of each casino\u2019s customer support team to ensure that you\u2019ll receive prompt assistance whenever you need it.\n\nOur team simulates various scenarios to gauge the effectiveness of customer support. We reach out with inquiries and assess the speed and accuracy of the responses received. We also evaluate the availability of different support channels, such as live chat, email, and phone support, to ensure that you can easily reach out for help.\n\nAdditionally, we consider the availability of multilingual support. We understand that not all players speak English as their first language, so we look for casinos that offer customer support in multiple languages. This ensures that language barriers do not hinder your gaming experience.\n\nFurthermore, we take into account the availability of comprehensive self-help resources, such as FAQs and knowledge bases. A good casino should provide you with the tools and information you need to resolve common issues on your own, without having to rely solely on customer support.\n\nBy considering all these factors, we aim to provide you with a thorough evaluation of Ethereum casinos. Our goal is to help you make an informed decision and find the perfect casino that meets your needs and preferences.\n\nAnd there you have it \u2013 our top picks for the best Ethereum casinos. Whether you prioritize speed, security, or game variety, there\u2019s an Ethereum casino on our list that\u2019s sure to meet your needs. Happy gambling!\n\nFAQs"

        "title": "Spot Bitcoin ETF Gets Green Light: Is Ether Next? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) obtained approval earlier this month. Now with Bitcoin being more accessible to the general public, investors are hopeful that the cryptocurrency can continue to build on the gains it has accumulated in recent months.\n\nAnd it may not be too long before another popular cryptocurrency follows in its footsteps. Ethereum (ETH 1.24%) may soon have its own spot ETF coming.\n\nA decision on Ethereum could come as early as May\n\nNow that the spot Bitcoin ETF has obtained approval, crypto enthusiasts turn to what may seem like an inevitability: The approval of a spot Ethereum ETF. Ethereum is the second most popular cryptocurrency with a market cap of $305 billion, which is less than half of Bitcoin's value of $843 billion.\n\nMultiple companies have made applications for a spot Ether ETF, including BlackRock and Ark. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to make a decision by May.\n\nEthereum's value has been rising over the past year along with Bitcoin, as enthusiasm for greater acceptance of crypto is generally a good sign for both digital currencies. Investors were buying up Bitcoin in anticipation of an expected approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF, and the same may be happening with Ethereum as well, as its value has also been spiking in recent weeks.\n\nWhy approval may not come until much later\n\nWhile there is excitement that a spot Ethereum ETF may soon be available as well, not everyone is convinced that is a sure thing. According to TD Cowen, an approval is unlikely to happen by May. And it may not even happen until after the U.S. federal election.\n\nThe rationale for this is that the investment bank believes that \"the SEC will want to gain experience from Bitcoin\" before it approves another token, whether it is for Ethereum or any other coin.\n\nInvestors shouldn't be concerned\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are the two big names in crypto, and their trajectories have been fairly similar over the past year, as both have moved in similar directions. While Bitcoin has generated the stronger returns due to its recent approval, a spot Ethereum approval may not be too far away, either. Whether it happens in May or even next year, it would appear unlikely for regulators to only approve one of the major cryptocurrencies and no others.\n\nThe SEC took its time (more than two years) in approving a spot Bitcoin ETF. So if it takes a bit of time in analyzing the rollout before approving the spot Ethereum ETF, that may not be all that surprising. What's important is that investors factor this into their expectations and not get their hopes up too high in May, in case the spot Ethereum ETF approval doesn't come through.\n\nIs now a good time to invest in Ethereum?\n\nIf you're bullish on crypto, now may be a good time to add some exposure to Ethereum. Even if it takes a little longer than expected, approval of a spot Ethereum ETF looks highly probable. And with Ethereum's gains lagging behind Bitcoin over the past year, there could be more potential upside for the cryptocurrency once the approval takes place.\n\nThere is the risk of volatility, as is always the case with any cryptocurrency, but with regulators taking a more positive view of digital currencies and approving a spot Bitcoin ETF, the outlook is as promising as ever for crypto. As long as you're OK with the risk that comes with it, now may be an optimal time to buy Ether."

        "title": "Here\u2019s Why Ethereum Price May Outperform Bitcoin Recovery in Near-Term - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has exhibited a notable bullish trend since the second week of January. This period coincided with the much-anticipated approval of the Spot Bitcoin ETF, a development that significantly contributed to Ethereum\u2019s price surge from $2,170 to $2,714. In contrast, Bitcoin displayed continued volatility during this period. As previously reported by Coingape, there was a substantial increase in whale accumulation for Ethereum in December 2023. This trend suggests that \u2018smart money\u2019 investors showed a greater inclination towards Ethereum over Bitcoin, despite a historical milestone.\n\nWill Bitcoin continue to rise as Ethereum ETF could be the next topic of investor\u2019s focus?\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Project Strength for Prolong Recovery.\n\nThe ETH price may prolong recovery until the expanding channel is intact.\n\nA falling coin price may find a surge in demand pressure $2430 and $2300 supports\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $11.03 Billion, indicating a 10.3% gain.\n\nThe Ethereum coin has rallied in a bullish trajectory for the past four months, where the price jumped from $1522 to a recent high of $2714, registering 77% growth. A look at the daily time frame chart shows that this recovery can be followed using two divergence trendlines which show the formation of an expanding channel.\n\nThe coin price rebounded at least thrice from both trendlines indicating the market participants took a stick on this pattern structure. In theory, this chart setup reflects increasing volatility in an asset but provides a directional trend, once price breaks from either trendline.\n\nAmid the current downturn in the market, the Ethereum price recently reverted from a $2714 high to a plunge of 7.25% to $2517. This bear within the chart range could tumble the ETH value another 8-9% to lower the trendline around $2300.\n\nSome recent insights from on-chain analytics firm Santiment indicate. In just one week, the Ethereum price dominance over Bitcoin has spiked, reaching a remarkable increase of +22.4%. The network is experiencing rapid growth, averaging 89.4K new $ETH addresses daily, with an impressive surge to 96.3K new wallets yesterday. Ethereum\u2019s presence in exchange supplies is dwindling, dropping from 8.15% to 8.10%, approaching its all-time low of 8.05%.\n\nThese developments project the ETH price is likely to rebound from a lower trendline which could surge its value past $2700 to chase the $3000 mark.\n\nETH/BTC Pair Rebounds From Crucial Support\n\nBased on the latest insights from respected analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, Ethereum is showing a remarkable rebound, potentially signaling an upcoming uptrend. To firmly establish this trend, Ethereum must surpass the 0.06 BTC level. The observation of a weekly bullish divergence is a strong indicator of Ethereum\u2019s increasing momentum, suggesting we might see considerable strength in the market over the next few months.\n\nExponential Moving Average (EMA): The ETH price above daily EMAs(100 and 200) accentuates the overall trend is bullish.\n\nRelative Strength Index (RSI): The daily RSI above 50% reflects the buyers having an upper hand on this asset.\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "content": "ETH\u2019s value increased above $2,600 despite the 100 ETH sell-off.\n\nDominance over Bitcoin jumped, but it could be better to wait for a pullback.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation let go of another round of Ether [ETH] on the 16th of January, data from Etherscan revealed.\n\nAccording to the details from the transaction, the Foundation changed 100 ETH to stablecoin DAI through its \u201cGrant Provider\u201d address.\n\nThough the purpose of the sale was unknown at press time, previous similar transactions suggest that it was probably a donation to a project.\n\nOver the past year, AMBCrypto revealed how the foundation sold some of its coins. But at different points, the team cleared the air that it was not liquidating its holdings unnecessarily.\n\nTrust in ETH continues to rise\n\nThis time, it does not seem like ETH\u2019s value will plummet because of the action. In fact, on the same day, the value of ETH rose past $2,600 before it later reversed below the level.\n\nHowever, there were solid reasons why we concluded that ETH would not feel the effect of the sell-off. This could be traced to a recent post by on-chain analysis tool Santiment.\n\nAccording to Santiment, 89,400 new addresses were created per day on the Ethereum network in the past week. It also mentioned that a higher number of wallets appeared on the 16th of January.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 #Ethereum's price dominance continues to surge against #Bitcoin's, now +22.4% in a week.

Should this remain the same way, the chance of ETH\u2019s plunge will remain extremely low.\n\nAlso, the increase in the number of wallets created sparked conviction in the long-term potential of the cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, it did not end there. AMBCrypto also looked at the supply of the altcoin on exchanges and the supply outside of it. At press time, ETH\u2019s supply outside of exchanges had reached an All-Time High (ATH) of 121.31 million.\n\nConversely, the supply on exchanges got close to an All-Time Low (ATL). At press time, the percentage was 8.08%. These occurrences have helped Ethereum\u2019s dominance over Bitcoin [BTC].\n\nOkay, now could be time to wait for a pullback\n\nIn the past seven days, Ethereum\u2019s market dominance had risen by 22.4% over Bitcoin. If this continues to be the case, then ETH, alongside some altcoins, would outperform BTC.\n\nHowever, an assessment of the Market Value to Realized Value Ratio (MVRV) ratio preached caution.\n\nThe MVRV ratio tells whether a cryptocurrency is trading at a fair value, below it, or is overvalued. Values lower than 1 suggest that the coin is undervalued. But when the MVRV ratio is higher than 1, it suggests closeness to the local top.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nAt press time, Glassnode\u2019s data showed that Ethereum\u2019s MVRV ratio was 1.67. This suggested that the market was a little overheated. However, the metric seemed to be falling, which is something that could excite investors.\n\nIf the MVRV ratio drops lower than 1.5, it could be a good entry for those looking to profit from ETH in the long term."

He said : \u201cCompletely expected. The significant dates are likely in late May.\u201d\n\nFidelity #ethereum ETF delayed just now. Completely expected. Dates that really matter are late May in my view. https://t.co/8mvhcPRaS7 \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 18, 2024\n\nThe approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC last week has fueled speculation about the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF. Following in the footsteps of BlackRock, Fidelity entered the competition for a spot Ethereum ETF last year, shortly after the launch of ether futures ETFs.\n\nStuart Barton, co-founder at Volatility Shares, said:\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s approval of futures-based ETFs suggests they view ether similarly to bitcoin, likely not considering it a security and thus not regulating it as such.\u201d\n\nEthereum\u2019s Emerging Role in Mainstream Finance\n\nEthereum, a cornerstone in the realm of blockchain technology, is not just a digital currency. Its appeal lies in its work with decentralized applications (DApps), which Fidelity seeks to harness through its proposed Ethereum ETF. This fund was envisioned not merely as an investment tool, but as a means to diversify the crypto landscape and integrate Ethereum into mainstream finance.\n\nIs ETH next for an ETF? The market seems to think sohttps://t.co/zKFl7o8Lse \u2014 CCN (@CCNDotComNews) January 11, 2024\n\nHowever, the market harbors varied opinions.

It signifies a critical juncture for the entire cryptocurrency sector. Ethereum, in particular, has been displaying signs of growing influence, occasionally outperforming Bitcoin. The excitement over upcoming network upgrades, such as the Dencun hard fork, has amplified this positive outlook.\n\nCathie Wood expects #Ethereum will most likely outperform Bitcoin in the next Bull Run. pic.twitter.com/FEK9YAIZWo \u2014 Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) January 15, 2024\n\nSantiment, an on-chain analytics firm, has noted a rise in Ethereum\u2019s market dominance.

On the other hand, it could have a negative impact on market morale and investor confidence.\n\nAnticipation Builds as SEC Deliberates on Ethereum ETF\n\nWith the SEC\u2019s March 5 deadline drawing closer, the cryptocurrency community is eagerly awaiting the outcome. Fidelity\u2019s proposal for a spot Ethereum ETF is a critical test of the balance between innovation and regulatory oversight in the digital era. The SEC\u2019s decision could either pave the way for Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies in the financial mainstream or reinforce existing barriers.\n\nSEC Delays Fidelity's $ETH ETF!\n\nWhat does this mean for ethereum?\n\nAbsolutely nothing!

This trend, along with upcoming Bitcoin (BTC) halving events and macroeconomic factors, adds to the complexity of the cryptocurrency market landscape."

        "title": "Ethereum's ETH Gears Up for Potential Resurgence in 2024 amid Dencun Upgrade - Coinspeaker",
        "content": "After a year of underperformance in 2023, the ETH/BTC dominance will grow this year on the backdrop of Dencun upgrade and other contributing factors within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nIn the year 2023, Ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, faced a period of underperformance compared to Bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin\u2019s newfound narrative centered around smart contracts, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and optimism surrounding a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) drew significant investor interest. Analysts now suggest a potential reevaluation of Ether in 2024, given Ethereum\u2019s continued status as the leading smart contract blockchain globally, coupled with upcoming key upgrades. Analysts also see Ether as a strong contender for the next spot-based ETF in the United States.\n\nIn a recent weekly newsletter, Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase expressed optimism, stating that \u201cETH could be poised for a breakout year.\u201d The impact of last week\u2019s Bitcoin ETF news proved beneficial for Ethereum, causing a brief spike above $2,700, marking its highest price since May 2022. Further optimism for ETH\u2019s near-term future arises from the fact that firms behind Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock and VanEck, are actively considering Ethereum-based spot ETFs.\n\nA spot ETF involves actual cryptocurrency investment, offering exposure to the asset without direct ownership. This is a favorable alternative to futures-based ETFs, which are susceptible to roll costs. The potential launch of spot ETH ETFs is likely to unleash a flood of institutional and retail investment, mirroring the success observed with nearly a dozen Bitcoin spot ETFs that commenced trading in the US last Thursday. These Bitcoin ETFs have collectively recorded a cumulative volume exceeding $10 billion, with BlackRock\u2019s product amassing an impressive $1 billion in inflows.\n\nEthereum Dencun Upgrade and Its Effect on ETH in 2024\n\nCoinbase reports that Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Dencun upgrade, designed to enhance the mainnet\u2019s scalability through the introduction of \u201cdata blobs,\u201d has the potential to ignite investor interest in the cryptocurrency. The upgrade recently went live on Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade introduces \u201cdata blobs\u201d, which are temporary transaction data memories typically associated with Layer 2 solutions. These can be attached to Ethereum. Thus, following the mainnet upgrade, the network will only need to confirm the correctness of the blob data attached to the block, reducing congestion and network fees.\n\nCoinbase notes that the Dencun upgrade, currently undergoing initial tests, is likely to implement Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844 in the coming months. Some Ethereum observers predict that this proposal could significantly decrease network fees by 90% or more.\n\nETH/BTC Growing Dominance\n\nIn its annual report, institutional crypto firm ETC Group expresses a bullish outlook for the ether-bitcoin ratio. Despite Bitcoin\u2019s surge in network activity in 2023, Ethereum continues to dominate as the preferred chain for decentralized applications, NFTs, and tokenized assets.\n\nETC Group\u2019s data reveals that the top 10 ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum have a combined market value of $21 billion, surpassing the $1.6 billion market capitalization of the entire BRC-20 token universe on the Bitcoin network. ERC-20 represents Ethereum\u2019s token standard, while BRC-20 signifies a fungible digital asset on the Bitcoin network.\n\nAdditionally, in 2024, Ethereum investors can generate extra returns by staking or locking their coins on the network, earning rewards at an annualized rate of around 3.84%. Ethereum\u2019s feature of burning a portion of transaction fees paid in ETH further contributes to a deflationary effect on the token\u2019s supply, positively impacting investors.\n\nETC Group emphasizes Ethereum\u2019s strong dominance in smart contract platforms and the potential for additional yield, stating that Ethereum should be a core holding in a diversified crypto asset portfolio. The report anticipates a reversal in the relative performance of ETH/BTC in 2024, citing historical trends of mean reversion in the 12-month relative performance of these two cryptocurrencies."

        "content": "Explore Ethereum Name Service (ENS) future prospects, its growth and the evolving role in the web3 and crypto space.\n\nRecently, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has seen a remarkable surge in its market performance, capturing the crypto community\u2019s attention. This surge is closely linked to ENS domains\u2019 growing popularity and utility within the crypto ecosystem.\n\nIn early Jan. 2024, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin highlighted the importance of ENS in the broader Ethereum landscape, prompting a notable boost in trading activity surrounding the ENS token price.\n\nAs of Jan. 19, the ENS token is valued at around $19, a notable increase from its all-time low of $6.70 in Oct. 2023.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s essential to note that the ENS token is currently rebounding from a significant decline. Previously, in November 2021, the ENS token reached its peak value at $85.69.\n\nENS price | Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe current market activity around ENS tokens and domains suggests a renewed interest and optimism in ENS within the crypto space.\n\nLet\u2019s dive deeper into ENS and try to understand what it is, how it works, and how it could impact crypto and Ethereum in 2024.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Name Service (ENS)?\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a vital component in the ENS blockchain ecosystem, providing a user-friendly interface to the otherwise complex and technical blockchain addresses.\n\nENS\u2019s primary function is to convert complex Ethereum addresses, which are typically long strings of numbers and letters, into human-readable names.\n\nThis service resembles the Domain Name System (DNS) used on the internet but is tailored for the decentralized nature of the blockchain.\n\nConsider a scenario where you want to receive Ethereum (ETH) as payment. Traditionally, this transaction would require you to share your Ethereum wallet address. These addresses are typically a string of 42 hexadecimal characters, which can be complex and prone to errors when shared or entered.\n\nFor instance, an Ethereum address might look something like this:\n\n0x6310ae27e35D2d850eE1913E0447c0cc85Eb1Cdf\n\nThis is where the ENS cryptocurrency becomes invaluable. ENS resolves the challenge of remembering and correctly using these complex addresses.\n\nInstead of relying on the long string of characters, ENS allows users to represent their Ethereum address with a simple, memorable name.\n\nSo, instead of sharing a string of characters, you can simply use an ENS domain like garygensler.eth.\n\nThis transformation significantly reduces the risk of errors in transactions and makes the process of sending and receiving digital assets more user-friendly.\n\nYou might also like: Web3 breaks ground with the convenience of a consumer-centric approach | Opinion\n\nHow does ENS work?\n\nENS operates using two key smart contracts: the ENS registry and resolvers.\n\nThe ENS registry maintains a list of all domains and subdomains, storing crucial information like the domain owner, the domain resolver, and the caching time for records under the domain.\n\nThe resolvers, on the other hand, are responsible for the actual process of translating names into addresses and vice versa.\n\nENS enhances security and reduces the risk of errors in transactions. It is more resistant to censorship and hacking attacks compared to traditional DNS due to its decentralized nature.\n\nFurthermore, ENS domains have increased in value and popularity, with shorter names being particularly rare and sought after.\n\nGetting an ENS domain is relatively simple: you can check for availability and register a domain through their website. The cost of obtaining and maintaining an ENS domain includes auction costs for popular names and an annual renewal fee, payable in Ethereum.\n\nENS governance is community-driven through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), where ENS token holders can submit proposals and vote on decisions affecting the protocol.\n\nThese tokens are used for protocol governance and influence decisions on pricing and other operational aspects.\n\nUse cases of ENS\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service (ENS) offers several practical use cases besides transforming complex Ethereum addresses into user-friendly domain names. These include:\n\nDecentralized websites: ENS enables the launch of censorship-resistant websites on decentralized networks like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). This feature is especially important for content creators and businesses seeking to establish an online presence immune to centralized control or censorship\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nIdentity management on the blockchain: ENS allows users to attach personal information, such as an email address or an avatar, to their ENS username. This capability could make ENS-enabled usernames a primary digital identity on the web, enhancing the way we interact online\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nSubdomain creation: ENS domain owners have the flexibility to create subdomains. These subdomains can be used for various purposes, including directing to smart contracts, transactions, or metadata. This feature offers a level of customization and control that can be particularly useful for businesses and developers operating in the blockchain ecosystem\u200b\u200b.\n\nEnhanced security and transparency: The decentralized nature of ENS, being built on the Ethereum blockchain, makes it more secure and less susceptible to hacking compared to traditional DNS systems. This enhanced security is critical for users and businesses that prioritize the safety of their digital identities and transactions\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nWhat to expect from ENS in 2024?\n\nBased on the current trajectory and emerging patterns in the ENS cryptocurrency markets, here\u2019s an analysis of what to expect:\n\nGrowth in registrations and renewals\n\nENS has demonstrated a strong performance in recent months, with significant growth in domain registrations and renewals.\n\nThis trend could likely continue into 2024, fueled by the increasing perception of ENS domains as valuable digital assets.\n\nThe growth in registrations, especially for more affordable 4+ character domains, indicates a broadening user base. Renewals of exclusively priced shorter names also suggest a strong, loyal user base within the ENS ecosystem\u200b\n\nIncreasing integration and adoption\n\nThe integration of ENS into various blockchain platforms and services like decentralized apps (dapps) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) could progress.\n\nAs ENS simplifies the user experience in the Ethereum-based web, its adoption could rise, especially among new users entering the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThe adoption rate could be a significant factor driving the ENS crypto price and the utility of the service.\n\nENS\u2019s role in web3 and digital identity\n\nENS\u2019s importance in the web3 space could also grow. Its role in linking human-readable names to blockchain assets positions it as a useful element for web3 identity protocols.\n\nThis utility extends beyond mere address simplification and plays into broader themes of digital identity and decentralized internet.\n\nFuture trajectory\n\nAs Ethereum continues to grow, the ENS is poised to expand alongside it. The increasing adoption of Ethereum for various applications, including decentralized finance (defi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), could drive more users towards ENS for easier and more secure interactions on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nCurrently, around 2.1 million .eth ENS names have been registered.\n\nENS stats for December 2023:\n\n\u2013 23.4k new .eth registrations (currently 2.1m names)\n\n\u2013 $1.36m in protocol revenue -all goes to the @ENS_DAO\n\n\u2013 18k new eth accounts w/ at least 1 ENS name (total 800k)\n\n\u2013 16.8k primary names set (total 701k)\n\n\u2013 4600 avatar records set (total 143k) pic.twitter.com/UjLcDLayja \u2014 ens.eth (@ensdomains) January 2, 2024\n\nAs the Ethereum ecosystem evolves with the latest Dencun upgrade, ENS could play a strong role in enhancing user experience and accessibility, potentially leading to broader adoption and integration within the blockchain space\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow to buy an ENS domain? To buy an ENS domain, you\u2019ll need to follow a series of steps:\n\nAcquire ETH: First, you need to have ETH in your account since ENS domains are purchased with ETH. You can buy ETH through centralized and decentralized exchanges.\n\nSet up a crypto wallet: Next, you\u2019ll need a crypto wallet that supports Ethereum, like MetaMask. This wallet is where your ENS domain will point to and is necessary for interacting with the ENS system.\n\nConnect to the ENS dApp: With ETH in your wallet, navigate to the ENS dapp (app.ens.domains). Connect your wallet to the dApp.\n\nChoose your ENS domain: Search for your desired domain name in the ENS dApp. If it\u2019s available, you can proceed with the purchase. If it\u2019s already taken, you might have to look for alternatives or buy it on the secondary market.\n\nComplete the purchase: Follow the instructions in the dApp to register and purchase your domain. This process will include paying the registration fee and any applicable gas fees. Why buy an ENS token? Purchasing ENS token can be a strategic move for those looking to participate in the governance of the ENS protocol. Holding ENS token allows users to vote on key decisions and contribute to the development of the ENS ecosystem. However, it\u2019s essential to exercise caution. Like any cryptocurrency investment, ENS token is subject to market volatility, which can lead to significant price fluctuations. You should conduct thorough research, consider the inherent risks of crypto investments, and only invest what you can afford to lose.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nEthereum continues to trade with a bearish consolidation due to Bitcoin\u2019s ongoing failures to break above the $43,000 to $44,000 range since the start of ETF trading. Despite this, Ethereum has shown notable strength compared to Bitcoin following the market correction, with various on-chain metrics signaling positive trends.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Strong Dominance Against Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin\u2019s dominance continues to fall, while Ethereum\u2019s surges, as observed on charts. Bitcoin\u2019s dominance has steeply dropped from 55% and it has been declining for the fifth day in a row is commonly seen as a positive sign for altcoins, potentially enabling them to outshine Bitcoin.\n\nThis trend is further evidenced by the recent data, which shows Ethereum\u2019s dominance climbing to a three-month high of over 18.5%. On-chain data provider Santiment reports a significant rise in Ethereum\u2019s price dominance relative to Bitcoin, with an increase of 22.4% in the past week.\n\nThis period also marked a notable increase in Ethereum network engagement, with the creation of around 90K new Ethereum addresses each day, showing the network\u2019s growing appeal. Particularly striking was the creation of a remarkable 96,300 wallets on January 16.\n\nEthereum is also doing a lot of network improvements recently as the newest upgrade to the Ethereum network, codenamed \u201cCancun-Deneb\u201d or \u201cDencun,\u201d went live on the Goerli testnet for the first time yesterday.\n\nUpon its deployment on the mainnet, the Dencun upgrade is expected to substantially reduce transaction costs on Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 solutions like Optimism, Base, Polygon zkEVM, among others, as claimed by developers. Additionally, this upgrade will restrict self-destruct operations and introduce new functionalities for bridges and staking pools.\n\nDue to the active network upgrades, ETH price is holding investors\u2019 confidence and it has impressively outperformed Bitcoin. According to Tradingview, the ETHBTC ratio has also skyrocketed as it now holds momentum at 0.06.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nEther is currently experiencing a corrective phase within a triangle pattern, with buyers aiming to maintain the ETH price above $2,450. However, bears continue to dominate as they recently plunged the price below $2,500. As of writing, ETH price trades at $2,473, declining over 2% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nThe declining 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $2,530 and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) heading toward the selling region suggest that the market momentum is leaning towards the sellers.\n\nA reversal from its present value or a rebound from the $2,400-$2450 zone would indicate a strong inclination for purchasing during dips. Under such circumstances, the ETH/USDT pair could potentially surge to break the pattern at $2,600. Surpassing this threshold might pave the way towards a retest of $2,700 level.\n\nConversely, this bullish scenario could be invalidated in the short term if the price continues its downward trajectory, falling below $2,400. Such a decline could lead the price towards the critical support zone at $2,130-$2,200."

        "content": "A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader doesn\u2019t believe Ethereum (ETH) could lose its top layer-1 (L1) position anytime soon.\n\nThe analyst pseudonymously known as Kaleo tells his 615,900 followers on the social media platform X that the second top-performing digital asset by market cap enjoys a comfortable edge over its multiple competitors.\n\nThe trader believes there\u2019s little chance of ETH losing its top spot in the current crypto market cycle to any L1 project. However, he says the odds of a competitor dethroning ETH could increase after two additional market cycles.\n\n\u201cGonna put this out there: for as much hate as ETH gets, I still don\u2019t expect any L1 to flip it this cycle. Doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t see plenty outgain it. But over the past seven years that I\u2019ve been plugged into this space, I\u2019ve heard countless names called out as the next ETH killer. Ultimately, none of them have unseated Ethereum\u2019s place as the ultimate settlement layer, and I don\u2019t see that changing quite yet. If it were to happen, I think we\u2019re two cycles away from seeing it take place.\u201d\n\nThe trader also updates his outlook on Ethereum and other digital assets, suggesting a possible crypto market cooldown before Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) halving event in April, when miners\u2019 rewards are cut in half.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve started to contemplate this a bit more and think there\u2019s a solid chance we don\u2019t see an ETH run quite yet, and I\u2019m fine with that. I got caught up in the narrative that other L1s were having solid pumps, so ETH had to. In all honesty, we\u2019re probably closer to July of 2019 in the ETH cycle than we are December 2020. We haven\u2019t even had the halving yet, so there\u2019s no need to really jump the gun and get too bullish too fast.\n\nA bit more cool off in the market wouldn\u2019t surprise me, and honestly would be incredibly healthy. It\u2019d give you a chance for incredible entries on alts that you thought you missed over the past several months before the real bull market starts. If somehow we\u2019re still sent endless green candles in the short term, I obviously wouldn\u2019t hate that either, but I\u2019m prepared to be patient.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $2,481 at time of writing, down nearly 2% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "What you'll learn The number of blockchain developers fell 24% last year.\n\nNewcomer devs accounted for a greater proportion of the exit from the blockchain developer community.\n\nBlockchain developer talent is becoming more evenly spread across the globe.\n\nA new report by web3-focused venture firm Electric Capital found a significant drop in the number of monthly active developers in the last year, with a nearly 25% decrease to 22,411 compared to 2022.\n\nDeveloper activity is often seen as a measure of value creation in the crypto space. Despite challenges like bear market conditions and the allure of the emerging AI sector, most experienced developers \u2014 those with at least a year under their belt \u00ad\u2014 remain committed to blockchain development.\n\nBut for the least experienced developers \u2014 those who have been working in crypto for less than a year \u2014 the scenario is quite different.\n\nBlockchain developer count declined last year (Electric Capital)\n\nThe report points out that the high turnover among the least experienced developers in the crypto sector is linked to the bear market\u2019s impact.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nElectric Capital\u2019s cohort retention analysis shows shows that those developers who start their careers during a bear market are more likely to leave sooner than their counterparts who join in more stable market conditions.\n\nExperienced developers grew 16%, according to the report. This growth trend is in keeping with the steady increase in established developers who choose to remain in the industry as seen over the last five years Indeed, growth figures for the most tenured blockchain developers is up over 52% in the last five years.\n\n\u201cExperienced devs push more code: 75% of code is created by developers in crypto 1+ years,\u201d the report said.\n\nEVM chains hold sway\n\nWhile multichain development has increased 10-fold since 2015, much of that activity is concentrated in Ethereum and other blockchains that run on the so-called Ethereum Virtual Machine. That includes blockchains like Avalanche, Fantom, and Polygon.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nEVM networks are similar to Ethereum and they use the same smart contract logic. That makes developers on Ethereum more likely to migrate to other EVM blockchains and vice versa. EVM blockchains account for 87% of multichain developer activity, as per the report.\n\nEthereum layer 2 blockchains \u2014 Ethereum scaling networks that rely on the mainnet for security \u2014 saw the most crossover among developers from across all EVM networks. Developers working on layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum, Starknet, and Optimism saw the greatest level of crossover in this regard.\n\nDev report 1 The majority of EVM smart contract code is first deployed on Ethereum (Electric Capital)\n\nBNB Chain and Polygon also drew from the crowd of multichain developers with roots in Ethereum. At least a third of Ethereum multichain developers deployed code on Polygon and BNB Chain.\n\n\u201c71% of contract code is initially deployed on Ethereum.\u201d \u2014 Electric Capital Blockchain Developer Report 2023\n\nEthereum the most unique\n\nEthereum stands out as the dominant player among EVM blockchains, boasting 7,864 monthly active developers, although this represents a 25% decline from the previous year.\n\nThe report highlights that the smart contract codes deployed on Ethereum last year were predominantly unique, with most not being deployed on any other EVM platforms.\n\nMoreover, 71% of EVM contracts are initially launched on Ethereum, reinforcing its role as the leading source of new on-chain logic for other networks.\n\nWhat about Bitcoin?\n\nMost blockchain development happens on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the top 200 crypto projects by market capitalisation, with Bitcoin and Ethereum accounting for 40%, according to the report.\n\nNOW READ: Degens are so high on inscriptions they just poured $106m into a Bitcoin NFT game that hasn\u2019t even been created\n\nBitcoin has seen a notable decrease in its developer activity, with 1,071 monthly active developers currently, marking a 19% reduction from the previous year\u2019s figures.\n\nThis decline is primarily attributed to the departure of part-time Bitcoin developers and those who are involved in multiple blockchain projects.\n\nBut the report also found that developers dedicated exclusively to Bitcoin were more likely to remain engaged in the platform.\n\nWhile Ordinals caused a transaction spike on Bitcoin, it did not translate to significant developer interest, attracting only 3% of devs with most of their colleagues focused on Bitcoin layer 2 networks and other scaling networks.\n\nThe US loses more ground\n\nAs crypto adoption spreads across the globe, so also is the distribution of blockchain development talent across the globe.\n\n\u201c74% of crypto developers live outside of the US.\u201d \u2014 Electric Capital Developer Report 2023\n\nSeven out of every 10 blockchain developers are outside North America and the United States has lost 14% of its share of the global blockchain dev market since 2018, the report said. The US now only accounts for 26% of blockchain developers compared to 40% in 2018.\n\nGlobal blockchain developer distribution continues to be more diverse with each passing year (Electric Capital)\n\nEurope and Central Asia are now the major global hub for blockchain development with 36% of devs from this report, per the report.\n\nWith more blockchain developers outside North America, the distribution of talent has undergone a meaningful shift. India and Nigeria have seen the highest growth in developer count over the last five years.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

        "title": "Spot Bitcoin vs Ethereum ETFs: The Race Is On - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "ETF Investing Tools\n\nThe bitcoin versus Ethereum ETF race is on for 2024.\n\nA 24% performance differential divides the popular crypto investments, as futures-based Ethereum ETFs are up nearly 15% and the new spot bitcoin ETFs are down 9% in their first three days of trading through Jan. 16.\n\nOver that brief period, $1.2 billion has flowed from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), while $740 million has flowed into new spot ETFs like the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), meaning that almost $2billion has gone into the non-GBTC spot bitcoin ETFs this year. The heavy flows and trading volume partially explain the negative performance for spot bitcoin ETFs thus far.\n\nInvestors Eye SEC Approval of a Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum appears to be gaining a similar kind of investor enthusiasm as Bitcoin did in 2023, as multiple issuers, including the ETF behemoth BlackRock, Inc., have filed for a spot Ethereum ETF. The timetable for the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve a spot Ethereum ETF takes us to May 2024, which could lead to the bidding up of Ethereum prices in the coming months.\n\nAlthough the 2024 spot bitcoin versus Ethereum ETF race has only just begun, the story is setting up as the more established cryptocurrency versus the rising outsider.\n\nGBTC Outflows Impact Spot Bitcoin ETF Pricing\n\nDigging a bit deeper into spot bitcoin\u2019s poor start, $1.2 billion flowing out of GBTC pumped significant liquidity into the bitcoin ecosystem. The higher supply offset the early demand; thus, the price did not leap higher as many expected. The SEC announcement also appeared to become a \u201csell the news\u201d event.\n\nBTC\u2019s price rose more than 21% from late November through Jan. 8, peaking near $47,000 according to crypto data aggregator CoinGecko data, as signs suggested increasingly that the SEC would approve at least a few of the filings (the agency approved all 11 applications). A primary reason for GBTC\u2019s huge outflows is likely its expense ratio of 1.50%, which is more than 100 basis points higher than any of the other 10 spot bitcoin ETFs on the market. Another reason is that GBTC had previously been a closed-end bitcoin trust with $29 billion in assets, and the SEC allowed it to convert to a spot bitcoin ETF last week as the new spot ETFs launched.\n\nStory continues\n\nGBTC\u2019s conversion enabled investors to sell shares. They had likely been waiting to exit the closed-end fund once they were longer locked in. Many investors bought GBTC at a discount in 2023, which was as low as 50%. and sold at par to capture gains after the conversion.\n\nClosed-end funds can be less liquid than ETFs, which are open-ended funds. The limited number of shares outstanding can result in wider bid-ask spreads and reduced liquidity for CEFs. If there aren't enough buyers, a closed-end fund can trade at a discount.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for the Spot Bitcoin vs Ethereum ETF Race?\n\nInvestors will likely be eyeing the bitcoin halving in April. The halving will cut the reward for bitcoin miners from the current 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoin, reducing the number of tokens entering the system. Observers of the digital asset space widely expect the event to boost BTC\u2019s price and bring more assets into spot bitcoin funds.\n\nBitcoin miners are lynchpins of the blockchain, helping to ensure its integrity. A month later, the SEC will decide on multiple applications for Ethereum ETFs, which could increase the price of ether, the token of the Ethereum network.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com.

        "title": "Why Experts Foresee Solana (SOL) Outshining Ethereum (ETH) By 500% In the Next Bull Run - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe co-founders of leading crypto analytics firm Glassnode, Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, foresee Solana (SOL) outperforming Ethereum (ETH) by a staggering 500% in the next bull run.\n\nThe duo who operate under the X account \u201cNegentropic\u201d recently shared their optimistic outlook on Solana\u2019s potential ascent. Notably, their perspective was inspired by a recent interview featuring macroeconomist Henrik Zeberg and Global Macroinvestor CEO Raoul Pal, where the discussion centered around the potential for a remarkable rally in the SOL/ETH chart.\n\nNotably, the interview host asked Pal and Zeberg about their crypto preferences for a $10,000 investment over a 12-month period, specifically focusing on Ethereum and Solana in terms of risk-adjusted returns.\n\nPal and Zeberg, examining Solana\u2019s recent performance trend, expressed strong confidence in its significant momentum. They anticipated Solana maintaining its upward trajectory, surpassing Ethereum, as indicated by the SOL/ETH chart.\n\nThat said, Glassnode\u2019s co-founders delved into Pal and Zeberg\u2019s analysis to answer the intriguing question of how much Solana could potentially outperform Ethereum. According to insights from Glassnode\u2019s analytics, the current SOL/ETH ratio stands at around 0.14, and the co-founders anticipate a substantial increase in the ratio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe all watched Zebergand and Paul talking about SOL-ETH ratio. They both agreed it looks BULLISH. But \u2013 just how much could the ratio rally? This chart suggests, that the SOL/ETH ratio could rise to ~0.76 from current level of ~0.14. In other words, SOL may outperform ETH by 4-5X into the Crypto top.\u201d Negentropic remarked.\n\nContrary to an isolated rally for SOL, the market experts also anticipated a significant bullish rally for Ethereum.\n\nThat said, following a remarkable surge last month that propelled it to reach an impressive $126, SOL has experienced a subsequent retracement attributed to profit-taking by investors and the broader market downturn, particularly influenced by Bitcoin\u2019s performance after the spot BTF approval.\n\nHowever, despite this setback, bullish sentiments surrounding Solana remain notably high. In a Friday tweet, analyst \u201cCrypto Simon\u201d noted that the SOL/USDT price chart is signalling a potential breakout from its descending channel, suggesting a shift towards an upward trend. He further highlighted a high probability of a bullish movement originating from the support level around $98, with SOL poised to target resistance levels near $128.\n\nAt press time of the latest update, Solana was trading at $89.31, reflecting a 6.36 % decline over the past 24 hours. Ethereum, on the other hand, was trading at $2,438 after experiencing a similar 3.8% decrease during the same timeframe. Despite this decline, Solana\u2019s one-year trajectory remains notably robust at 340.43%, surging from around $20. In contrast, Ethereum\u2019s one-year trajectory is comparatively lower at 60.72%, indicating growth from $1,500."

        "content": "Recently, cryptocurrency analytics platform Lookonchain reported activities of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) whales amid the ongoing market downturn. These whales appear to have been capitalizing on the recent decline in the crypto prices to bolster their holdings.\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, amid the market dip, a newly established wallet withdrew 700 BTC, valued at roughly $29.36 million, from the Binance exchange.\n\nThese BTCs were purchased at an average price of $41,948 each.It is worth noting that, according to the analyst, such a move during a market downturn demonstrates a bullish sentiment on the future of BTC.\n\nIt seems that a whale is buying $BTC! In the recent market drop, a new wallet withdrew 700 $BTC($29.36M) from #Binance at an average price of $41,948.https://t.co/5kE1l0mJlo pic.twitter.com/Fj1thu4C6x \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 19, 2024\n\nEthereum Whales Joining The Fray\n\nThe narrative of strategic accumulation isn\u2019t limited to Bitcoin. Lookonchain\u2019s subsequent tweet highlighted similar activities in the Ethereum market.\n\nA whale took advantage of the decreased Ethereum prices, buying 3,600 ETH, worth around $8.9 million. Lookonchain highlighted that this investor\u2019s history of buying ETH at lower prices and selling at higher valuations has resulted in substantial profits, estimated at around $25.8 million.\n\nAfter the price of $ETH dropped today, this smart whale bought 3,600 $ETH($8.9M) back at a lower price 5 hours ago. This whale is very good at buying $ETH at low prices and selling $ETH at highs. The profit is ~$25.8M currently!https://t.co/UzXbheftr1 pic.twitter.com/DannZzsQVk \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 19, 2024\n\nThese whale movements are worth noting, especially considering the increasing bearish sentiment in the cryptocurrency markets. Ethereum, for instance, has seen a 1.9% decline in the past 24 hours and a 7.8% drop over the past week.\n\nThe asset is currently trading at around $2,475. Bitcoin is experiencing a similar trend, with a nearly 3% decrease in the past 24 hours and a 10% fall over the past week, bringing its price to $40,819 at the time of writing.\n\nThis market downturn is also reflected in the asset\u2019s trading volume. Bitcoin\u2019s daily trading volume fell from over $40 billion last Friday to about $26 billion.\n\nBitcoin Market Analysis And Future Predictions\n\nIn light of these developments, renowned crypto analyst Jacob Canfield has cautioned that Bitcoin might face further corrections in the short term.\n\nCanfield notes that the upcoming Bitcoin halving could play a crucial role in rebalancing the market dynamics, potentially tipping the scale towards demand over supply. However, his analysis of Bitcoin\u2019s 4-hour chart indicates the formation of a trend that has historically been an indicator of negative short to mid-term price movements.\n\nFor Bitcoin, critical levels include $48,700, marked by the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement, weekly resistance, and a significant support level to watch at $38,700. Earlier this month, Bitcoin traded at the $48,700 zone before retracing.\n\nCanfield warns that following a tap of the 61.8% level, Bitcoin often experiences an 18-22% sell-off, potentially bringing it back to the $38,700 support level.\n\n#Bitcoin update \u2013 If you\u2019ve been following me for a while, you\u2019ll know my local top on $BTC was $48.7k (as per my playbook posts) The question that everyone is asking now is \u2018where do we go from here?\u2019 The current narrative is that the ETF approval unlocked the GBTC investors\u2026 pic.twitter.com/MayIZp5vEY \u2014 Jacob Canfield (@JacobCanfield) January 18, 2024\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Kaiko Research highlighted that the correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum has dropped below its average of 0.71 for the first time since 2021.\n\nThis development comes amidst a broader market downturn, with BTC and ETH prices falling nearly 6% over the past week, currently at $40,991 and $2,463, respectively.\n\nHistorically, BTC and ETH have demonstrated a strong correlation in their market movements. However, the recent divergence raises questions about Ethereum\u2019s future trajectory, especially in light of its trade volume surge without corresponding signs of a rally in the derivatives market. This phenomenon contrasts sharply with the BTC market, which saw significant growth in anticipation of ETF approvals.\n\nYou might also like: Grayscale CEO: Most spot Bitcoin ETFs will not survive\n\nReflecting on Bitcoin\u2019s past, it\u2019s observed that BTC exhibited a remarkable 100% return over the past year, overshadowing Ethereum\u2019s 60% gains. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs marked a pivotal moment; BTC prices dipped while ETH experienced a rally, fueled by speculation that it might be the next to receive ETF approval.\n\nInvestors had previously focused on \u201cETH beta\u201d tokens, like Optimism (OP) and Arbitrum (ARB), which are closely linked to Ethereum but with higher volatility. However, after ETF approval, this trend saw a reversal, with these beta tokens experiencing a slump and ETH showing relative resilience by registering the smallest decline.\n\nThe current scenario underscores the evolving dynamics between Bitcoin and Ethereum. While BTC\u2019s ETF journey catalyzed its market presence, Ethereum\u2019s path appears less clear. Its reduced correlation with Bitcoin suggests a potential for independent market behavior. Yet, the lack of traditional rally indicators in derivatives markets and the shift away from ETH beta tokens post-BTC ETF approval inject uncertainty.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nSamson Mow, the chief executive officer of investment firm Jan3 and prominent Bitcoin (BTC) bull and evangelist, has taken his advocacy for the top coin to a new level. In his latest post on X, he took a subtle jab at alternative investment assets, including Silver and Ethereum (ETH), as his way of reducing their viability in comparison to their counterparts Gold and Silver.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSamson Mow analogy\n\nAccording to Samson Mow, Silver is the poor man\u2019s Gold, a statement that shows that investors who consider the latter to be too expensive typically opt in for the former. While both are respected metals and investment assets, Gold is still considered the superior of the two.\n\nSamson Mow deflated Ethereum\u2019s ego to end the long-standing superiority debate with Bitcoin.

The price differentials of $41,344.01 to $2,476.66 also show that Bitcoin is the most valuable of the two. Over time, there have been conversations about shifting capital from BTC to ETH, a trend that might be amplified in the coming months if Ethereum\u2019s key fundamentals come into play.\n\nThe harsh criticism of Ethereum did not go down well with its community members, with some pointing out the key improvements the protocol has made as a blockchain in itself.\n\nIs XRP next?\n\nAs a Bitcoin Maxi, Samson Mow was asked by one of the commenters on his post what he thinks about XRP if Ethereum is the poor man\u2019s Bitcoin. He simply answered that the demand is a \"tricky one.\"\n\nSamson Mow\u2019s confidence in Bitcoin has made him forecast a $1 million price target, and his lack of confidence in XRP and Ethereum has undoubtedly made his bearish stand subtle."

She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nThe crypto industry is on the verge of concluding the week on a bearish note as the market has recorded four out of six red days this week. Further, the hype of the ENS price seems to have faded away as the price has been constantly displaying bearish moves since its high of $26 this week.\n\nThe ENS price traded in a narrow space between $9.32 and $10.91, following which the price gained momentum and jumped approximately 66% in valuation.\n\nTradingView: ENS/USDT\n\nAfter this, the price traded in a consolidated range between $10.91 and $15.74 for over a week. As the market regained momentum, The Ethereum Name Services displayed a jump of 124% in valuation within the next three days.\n\nSince then, the price has been constantly trading in a consolidated range between $21.89 and $26.0. Recently, the price experienced a strong bearish move by recording a correction of approximately 11%.\n\nThe RSI displays a descending trend, indicating strong selling pressure in the crypto industry.

        "content": "The debates over Ethereum's classification \u2013 commodity or security \u2013 further complicates the scenario, with contrasting views on the SEC's stance.\n\nEthereum, often regarded as the silver to Bitcoin's gold, is currently under the spotlight for a potential breakthrough \u2013 the approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nWith a surge in investor enthusiasm in the manner of the excitement surrounding Bitcoin in 2023, the anticipation is apparent. Notably, even BlackRock is interested in offering a spot in Ethereum ETF.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has set a timetable, targeting May 2024, for the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nIn the months leading up to the SEC decision, the market is abuzz with predictions of Ethereum prices. But when can we expect the approval of spot Ethereum ETF?\n\n\u200d\n\nJPMorgan's Take on Approval Probability\n\nJPMorgan estimates the probability of the SEC approving the ETF by May to be no more than 50%. As per a report from The Block, a notable indicator of this uncertainty is the discount to net asset value (NAV) for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), hovering around 12% over the past two months. The SEC's decision not to mention Ethereum in its recent lawsuit against crypto exchanges has ignited debates within the crypto community.\n\nSome argue that this silence may indicate an imminent classification of Ethereum as a commodity, a prerequisite for spot ETF approval. However, JPMorgan analysts remain skeptical, questioning the significance of the SEC's approval of ether futures-based ETFs in September last year.\n\n\u200d\n\nMark Yusko's Perspective\n\nMark Yusko, co-founder and CEO of Morgan Creek Capital, offers a skeptical perspective. Despite a 70% chance, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, Yusko believes the SEC is unlikely to approve a spot Ether ETF in 2024.\n\nIn an interview with CoinTelegraph, Yusko points to the SEC's persisting hostility toward cryptocurrencies, as indicated by the agency's head, Gary Gensler, on the day of the recent Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nThe overarching skepticism of the SEC toward cryptocurrencies remains a significant obstacle. Yusko adds another layer, suggesting that the SEC may still regard Ethereum as a security, unlike Bitcoin, which enjoys the classification of a commodity.\n\n\u200d\n\nComparing Ethereum and Bitcoin\n\nEthereum stands as the second-largest player with a market cap of $299 billion, yet still less than half of Bitcoin's staggering $809 billion value.\n\nDrawing parallels with the recent Bitcoin ETF approval, investors are exhibiting a similar trend with Ethereum. The anticipation of a spot Ethereum ETF approval is prompting a surge in Ethereum's value, aligning with the broader bullish sentiment in the crypto market.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is trading at $2484, up, 11.5% in a month."

        "title": "Ether Could Soar in 2024 on the Back of Dencun Upgrade, ETF Narrative: Analysts - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Investors are likely to have a relook at ether as the spot ETF narrative gathers steam and Ethereum remains the dominant chain in the DeFi and NFT world, according to analysts.\n\nEther is qualified to be a core holding in a diversified crypto portfolio, one observer said.\n\nEther [ETH], the native token of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, underperformed bitcoin [BTC] in 2023, as the latter\u2019s new-found smart contract, non-fungible tokens (NFT) narrative, and spot ETF optimism drew investor money.\n\nPer analysts, investors will likely have a relook at ether this year as Ethereum is still the world\u2019s leading smart contract blockchain with key upgrades lined up, and ether is widely seen as the next likely candidate to get a spot-based ETF in the U.S.\n\n\u201cETH could be poised for a breakout year,\u201d Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange Coinbase said in the weekly newsletter. \u201cLast week\u2019s bitcoin ETF news proved to be a boon for ethereum, which briefly spiked above $2,700 \u2014 reaching its highest price since May 2022. And there are reasons to be even more optimistic about ETH\u2019s near-term future. For one, several of the firms behind the BTC ETFs \u2014 including BlackRock and VanEck \u2014 are also plotting ether-based spot ETFs.\u201d\n\nA spot ETF invests in actual cryptocurrency, allowing investors to take exposure to the asset without having to own it, and is considered a better option than futures-based ETFs, which are vulnerable to roll costs. So, just as spot BTC ETFs, a potential launch of spot ETH ETFs is expected to open floodgates to institutional and retail money.\n\nNearly a dozen bitcoin spot ETFs began trading in the U.S. last Thursday and have registered a cumulative volume of over $10 billion, with BlackRock\u2019s product amassing $1 billion in inflows.\n\nDencun upgrade and institutional demand\n\nIn addition, Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Dencun upgrade, which aims to improve the mainnet\u2019s scalability by introducing \u201cdata blobs,\u201d could galvanize investor interest in the cryptocurrency, according to Coinbase. The upgrade went live on Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet early this week.\n\nStory continues\n\nA blob is a temporary transaction data memory typically related to Layer 2 solutions that can be attached to Ethereum. Following the upgrade to the mainnet, the network will only need to confirm the correctness of the blob data attached to the block rather than verify each transaction, helping reduce congestion and network fees.\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade began initial tests on Wednesday and in coming months is expected to implement EIP-4844 (\u201cEIP\u201d stands for \u201cEthereum improvement proposal\u201d), which some ETH watchers predict could help reduce network fees by 90% or more,\u201d Coinbase noted.\n\nInstitutional crypto firm ETC Group, in its annual report, discussed a bullish outlook for the ether-bitcoin ratio and explained that despite 2023's inscriptions-led boom in Bitcoin's network activity, Ethereum remains the dominant chain for building decentralized applications, NFTs, and tokenized assets.\n\nFor instance, data tracked by ETC Group show, the top 10 ERC-20 tokens have a cumulative market value of $21 billion \u2013 or 13 times bigger than the $1.6 billion market capitalization of the entire BRC-20 token universe of over 37,000 coins. ERC-20 is Ethereum\u2019s token standard, while BRC-20 is a fungible digital asset created on the Bitcoin network.\n\nFurther, ether investors can generate extra returns on top of their holdings by staking or locking their coins in the network in return for rewards. The current annualized reward rate is around 3.84%, having averaged about 4% to 5% since Ethereum completed the Merge in September 2022.\n\nLastly, Ethereum's feature of burning a portion of transaction fees paid in ETH has a deflationary effect on the token's supply, positively affecting investors.\n\n\"The strong dominance of Ethereum in terms of smart contract platforms and the possibility to earn an additional source of yield imply that it should also be a core holding in a diversified cryptoasset portfolio as well,\" ETC Group said. \"We therefore think that it is quite likely for the relative performance of ETH/BTC to reverse itself in 2024. In fact, ETH/BTC\u2019s 12-month relative performance has historically shown a strong tendency to mean revert,\" ETC Group added.\n\nEther has outperformed bitcoin so far this year, with the ether-bitcoin ratio (ETH/BTC) trading 10% higher. The ratio tanked over 25% last year.\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Ether is gearing up for a major breakout year in 2024, according to market analysts. The native token of Ethereum\u2019s market-leading smart contract blockchain stands ready to ride catalysts both technical and regulatory to outshine bitcoin\u2019s gains this year.\n\nTLDR\n\nEther could break out in 2024 as spot ETF narrative builds and major Ethereum upgrades like Dencun reduce fees\n\nEthereum remains the dominant platform for DeFi, NFTs and smart contracts compared to competitors\n\nUpcoming Dencun upgrade aims to improve scalability and drastically lower network congestion and fees\n\nInstitutions predict ETH will outperform BTC in 2024 given Ethereum\u2019s strengths and extra yield opportunities\n\nEther supply is deflationary due to fee burning, while BTC underwent inflation in 2023 from new mining\n\nChief among them is the hotly anticipated Dencun upgrade now undergoing testing. Slated to hit Ethereum\u2019s mainnet in coming months, Dencun introduces data structures that some experts predict could slash network fees by up to 90%.\n\nBy improving scalability and throughput, Dencun aims to relieve the congestion and high costs that have hindered Ethereum adoption. The impact could be profound in unlocking the platform\u2019s true potential.\n\nBeyond Dencun specifically, Ethereum\u2019s dominance in areas like decentralized finance and NFTs continues growing. The total value locked in Ethereum DeFi protocols is an astounding 13x higher than rival blockchains. And nuevo crypto darling bitcoin saw more inflationary mining rewards issued last year while Ethereum\u2019s fee burning actually makes ETH a deflationary asset.\n\nThat scarcity combined with staking yields and rising institutional demand gives investors ways to generate returns simply for holding ETH. No such incentives exist with the comparatively static bitcoin.\n\nSpeaking of institutions, their comfort with ether vehicles continues increasing. The hottest current craze centers on spot cryptocurrency ETFs which hold tokens directly. Giant fund managers like BlackRock and VanEck \u2014 which just launched spot bitcoin ETFs \u2014 have ETH fund proposals awaiting regulatory greenlights.\n\nThe mere prospect of straightfoward ether exposure to tap into self-custody averse investors has already exited rally attempts this past week. If the floodgates open with SEC approval, expect eager capital to propel ETH prices upwards and help it decisively flip the script on last year\u2019s bitcoin domination.\n\nOf course, risks remain as with any nascent technology. But for crypto pioneers and institutions alike, Ethereum appears the smarter long-term bet compared to other blockchains vying to usurp its throne. With game-changing upgrades launching in months rather than years, 2024 shapes up to be the year ETH finally awakens to deliver on its lofty ambitions.\n\nAnd skeptical bitcoin maximalists may be left longing for the past as visions of an Ethereum-centric future edge closer to reality. The high stakes battle for blockchain supremacy enters a new phase, with all arrows pointing towards ETH market leadership through times of plenty and drought ahead."

If the buyers can continue to break above the upper angle of the price channel, then resistance is expected at $2,770 (1.414 Fib Extension) and $2,800.\n\nIf the bulls can clear higher resistance at $2,950 (1.618 Fib Extension), they will be free to attempt $3,000.\n\nWhat ERC-20 Tokens Are Traders Buying for Profit?\n\nWhile Ethereum started to see a surprising move upward, traders are now turning their focus back to ERC-20 tokens, believing they can provide significant profits.\n\nIn particular, $SPONGE is turning heads as it attracts over $4 million into its staking contract for its V2 upgrade, slated to bring the first 100x meme coin return in 2024.\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) also gains momentum after crossing the $8.5 million fundraising milestone.\n\n$SPONGE Sees an Incredible $4 Million in Staked Assets As Traders Ready Themselves For V2 100x Return\n\nSpongebob Token ($SPONGE) has now seen the total amount of $SPONGE staked in its V2 contract rise past the $4 million level, demonstrating the building hype behind its v2 upgrade.\n\n$SPONGE was one of the hottest trending meme coins in 2023 after providing a 100x return following its fair launch in May 2023.\n\nThe cryptocurrency managed to amass a combined social following of 30,000 people as top exchanges like Gate.io and MEXC rushed to list the token.\n\nThe project is back with its V2 incarnation, aiming to reproduce the 100x return in 2024.\n\nThe exciting thing is that $SPONGE isn\u2019t hosting a typical presale. Instead, it\u2019s utilizing a stake-to-bridge, which requires $SPONGE holders to staker their V1 tokens to be allocated an equivalent amount of the V2 upgrade.\n\nThe stake-to-bridge utility is the only way to get positioned in V2. If you don\u2019t own $SPONGE V1, you can purchase it through the project\u2019s website and have it automatically staked for the V2 upgrade.\n\nAll $SPONGE V1 locked in the smart contract will be permanently locked to facilitate the transition to the V2 token.\n\nThe project has been audited by SolidProof, bringing security to investors.\n\nOverall, $SPONGE has already shown its capabilities in 2023 with a 100x surge and is back to repeat its success in 2024.Buy and Stake $SPONGE Today\n\n$BTCMTX Raises An Enormous $8.5 Million In Stake-to-Mine Presale\n\nBitcoin MInetrix ($BTCMTX) is another token turning heads as the presale crosses the $8.5 million milestone.\n\nThe significant backing clearly demonstrates that investors are touting Bitcoin Minetrix as a disruptive force in the cloud mining sector ahead of the next Bitcoin block halving.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix intends to make it easier for everyday users to mine Bitcoin without trusting centralized entities.\n\nThe project introduces a novel stake-to-mine concept that lets users buy and stake $BTCMTX tokens to start cloud mining Bitcoin.\n\nParticipants are doubling their passive income, with one source coming from mining returns and another from staking rewards.\n\nThose currently staking are earning an impressive 76% APY on their holdings.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix essentially tokenizes the cloud mining sector, putting the control back into the hands of the miners, who won\u2019t have to worry about being short-changed on potential earnings or being locked into long-term contracts.\n\nThose interested in the token can purchase it during the presale for $0.0128.\n\nBuy $BTCMTX Today.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

For these reasons, JPMorgan considers a spot Ethereum fund approval in the near term unlikely.\n\nStill, the report acknowledges that the discount to net asset value for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust has tightened in recent months as anticipation mounted for potential regulatory greenlights ahead."

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nThe Ethereum Classic price has lost approximately 5% in valuation within the past 24 hours, making it one of the top losers in the crypto industry for the day. Further, the market displays a constant bearish movement, suggesting a strong bear power.\n\nThe Ethereum Classic price traded in a closed range between $20.32 and $21.94 for a period, following which the bulls gained momentum and the price broke out of the range. However, the rally was short-lived as the price faced rejection at $23.45.\n\nTradingView: ETC/USDT\n\nAfter this, the price traded between $21.94 and $23.45 for about a week. As the bears overpowered the bulls, the ETC price recorded a correction of approximately 15% in valuation.\n\nFollowing this, the price traded in a consolidated range between $18.77 and $21.94 for a brief period. The bulls regained momentum, resulting in the Ethereum Classic price jumping over 42% in valuation within a day.\n\nAfter facing rejection at $31.23, the price has been constantly trading under a descending channel pattern, indicating a strong bearish influence in the market.\n\nWill ETC Price Regain Value?\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) displays a neutral trend, suggesting weak buying and selling pressure in the market. Further, the averages show a constant decline, suggesting an uncertainty in the future price action of the coin.\n\nIf the market regains value, the ETC price will test its resistance level of $29 soon. Maintaining the price at that level will set the stage for the Ethereum Classic price to attempt to test its upper resistance level of $31.23 in the coming days.\n\nConversely, if the bears overpowered the bulls, the price would lose momentum and fall to test its support level of $25.04. Moreover, if the bears continue to dominate the market, it will plunge and prepare to test its lower support level of $23.45."

This fee is deducted when rewards are collected. Rewards displayed for each validator are always post-fee.\n\nStaking Rewards\n\nRewards for Ethereum validators consist of a consistent base rate, supplemented by variable rewards received when a validator is randomly chosen to participate in block validation. The current reward rate for staking is at 4.26%, according to stakingrewards.com.\n\nConsenSys Staking, the entity behind MetaMask Staking, boasts no slashing penalties incurred in over two years of operation and managing over $2 billion in ETH across more than 33,000 validators, according to MetaMask's website.\n\nSlashing happens where validators lose a portion of their 32 ETH stake as a penalty for misbehavior, such as improper block attestation or inactivity.\n\nThe wallet had introduced staking via its Portfolio app in August."

        "title": "Arbitrum Commands Nearly Half of Total Market Share in Ethereum Rollups: Nansen - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Arbitrum has \u201crobust fundamentals,\u201d according to a Nansen analyst, but investors are concerned about its upcoming $2 billion token unlock.\n\nArbitrum, the leading scaling solution for Ethereum, has captured roughly half of the entire rollup market share, according to blockchain analytics firm Nansen in a research report published Thursday.\n\nRollups are designed to help users transact faster and more inexpensively on the Ethereum network by moving computation off-chain and batching a collection of transactions before posting them to Ethereum\u2019s base layer.\n\nWith $11.47 billion in locked value in its smart contracts, Arbitrum has captured about 48% of the entire rollup market share.\n\nArbitrum has \u201crobust fundamentals,\u201d Nansen research analyst Sandra Leow said in the research report. Notably, growth in daily transactions and monthly revenue has been impressive. Despite Ethereum surpassing it in daily transactions, Arbitrum averages 600,000 to 900,000 transactions per day, outpacing its rollup rival, Optimism, the second largest rollup with over $5.5 billion in locked value, per L2Beat.\n\nArbitrum\u2019s revenue trajectory has been consistently upward since Sept. 2023, Leow noted. Last month, Arbitrum generated revenue of $11.9 million, its highest monthly earnings to date.\n\nConcerns About Upcoming Token Unlock\n\nThe outlook is not all sunny for Arbitrum, however. Some crypto investors see risks in Arbitrum due to its upcoming token unlocks which will free up a massive amount of ARB.\n\nToken unlocks refer to the release of frozen or locked cryptocurrencies. Ideally, token unlocks are gradual to prevent large-scale sell-offs by early investors. But Arbitrum is about to have a \u201cheavy unlock,\u201d explained Charles Storry, co-founder of crypto index platform Phuture, to Unchained on Telegram.\n\nRight now, Arbitrum has a very small circulating supply of 1.275 billion ARB, only 12.75% of its total token supply. However, in about two months, 1.11 billion ARB \u2014 87% of its circulating supply \u2014 will be unlocked.\n\nAfter the March unlock, which is valued at over $2 billion, Arbitrum will begin monthly unlocks for the next three years, according to its governance documents.\n\nPositive Catalysts\n\nSeveral catalysts may increase positive sentiment among the Arbitrum community, however, according to Nansen\u2019s Leow. The first is a recently passed proposal about the implementation of a staking mechanism, which would let token holders lock their ARB in exchange for rewards.\n\nThe second is Arbitrum\u2019s short-term incentive program (STIP), which allows protocols such as GMX and Camelot to apply and receive grants as a means to boost on-chain activity.\n\nThe third is EIP-4844, which \u201cis a big step forward in Ethereum\u2019s Rollup-centric roadmap,\u201d because it reduces the cost of rollups by 10-20x, wrote Leow. While investors have expressed bearish remarks about ARB\u2019s price, \u201cgenerally people are more closely monitoring EIP-4844 (blobs) in the Ethereum Dencun upgrade,\u201d Carlos Mercado, a data scientist at blockchain analytics firm Flipside Crypto, said to Unchained over Telegram.\n\nRead More: Ethereum\u2019s Dencun Upgrade Live on Testnet After Bug Delays Finalization\n\nThe last catalyst revolves around Arbitrum Orbit, which allows developers to create new chains atop Arbitrum\u2019s layer 2 rollup. According to Leow, the main benefit of Arbitrum Orbit is that it allows the use of tokens native to the chains atop Arbitrum as compensation for gas, which would \u201climit sell pressure of the said token.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite investor concerns over imminent token unlocks and the ARB token\u2019s underperformance, ARB is strategically positioned as a frontrunner in the optimistic rollup sector, commanding nearly half of the total market share in rollups,\u201d Leow said.\n\nARB, the governance token for Arbitrum, is currently trading at $1.91, down roughly 14% in the past seven days, data from Coingecko shows.\n\nDisclosure: Arbitrum is a sponsor for Unchained."

        "content": "In an exciting turn of events witnessed within the cryptocurrency landscape, Ethereum whale accumulations appear to be on the rise as the token\u2019s price has recently noted a significant downturn. As per on-chain data surfacing over the crypto horizon, two prominent whales appear to be on a buying spree, accumulating Ethereum at price dips. These whales have previously been observed accumulating ETH at price lows, thereafter selling them at price highs, nabbing noteworthy profits.\n\nMeanwhile, as the accumulations emerge amid the token\u2019s price plunge, market sentiments for Ethereum are taking a thrilling twist, hinting at bolstered prices shortly ahead.\n\nadvertisement\n\nA Closer Look Into The Report\n\nAccording to the data revealed by Spotonchain, a platform offering blockchain tracking insights, the two whales, 0x347 and 0xc47, accumulated colossal amounts of ETH today, January 19. Aligning with this, the whale 0x347 withdrew 3,600 ETH, worth $8.84 million, from Binance at $2,456. Whereas, the whale 0xc47 accumulated 5,580 ETH, worth $13.76 million, from Coinbase.\n\nIntriguingly, these whales have been noted, accumulating similar amounts of ETH and converting them into profits in the past. The whale 0xc47 returned after two years of dormancy within the market, jotting an estimated gain of $31.1 million with ETH between September 8, 2020, and March 9, 2022. Meanwhile, the whale 0x347 was noted, accumulating ETH during last year\u2019s bear market, further depositing it to CEXs amid price rises.\n\nAlso Read: Cathie Wood & Elon Musk Bullish On Bitcoin, Ark Buys More ARKB ETF With BITO Holdings\n\nEthereum Price Plunges\n\nAs of writing, the Ethereum price showcased a significant fall in the past 24 hours, dropping 2.09%, reaching $2,482. Moreover, its weekly chart also showcased a plunge of 4.92%, aiding the whales in buying the dip. However, the token\u2019s 24-hour trading volume marked a substantial upswing of 15.28% and is currently resting at $11.93 billion.

        "title": "Ethereum Proto-Danksharking Successfully Live on Goerli Testnet - Blockonomi",
        "content": "The Dencun upgrade, one of the major upgrades in the Ethereum blockchain, went live on January 17, successfully integrating proto-danksharding (EIP-4844) to the Goerli tesnet. This testnet deployment will set the stage for the next upgrades on the Sepolia and Holesky testnets and the final launch on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nDespite encountering hurdles, the Dencun upgrade has successfully deployed on the Goerli testnet.\n\nParitosh Jayanthi, a DevOps engineer at Ethereum Foundation, confirmed the implementation in an X post: \u201cGoerli forked and blobs are now enabled on the testnet!\u201d He also monitored a live stream that showcased the upgrade.\n\nAs the implementation took place, it hit unexpected roadblocks, including a potential \u201cchain-split\u201d as there were issues with syncing between clients. Jayanthi noted that the Goerli fork failed to reach consensus and finality due to the low participation of Prysm validators, reportedly 80% being online at launch.\n\nEthereum Evolves\n\nTerence, a maintainer of Prysm, an Ethereum consensus layer client, said that this issue could be attributed to the lack of software upgrades and a software bug.\n\nTo wit, \u201cThe participation is low (~80%). Losing finality requires approximately 10% of validators to be offline. Being offline could be due to operators not upgrading a piece of software (and there are multiple)\u2026or a software bug.\u201d\n\nHowever, Jayanthi said within a few hours that the issue was fixed and validators were back online, successfully reaching finality.\n\nOne thing to note is that the Goreli testnet will stop running within one to three months after the Dencun upgrade is successfully implemented. Following this decision, the Ethereum Foundation acknowledged that this would moderately affect the network\u2019s stability.\n\nStill, it would be a good opportunity for them to check the delays and security when many validators get reduced, similar to how they got rid of Ropsten and Rinkerby as Ethereum continuously achieved important progress.\n\nLower Transaction Costs Coming Soon?\n\nDencun is one of the major upgrades of the Ethereum network, following the Merge and Shanghai. The upgrade is expected to introduce a number of improvements to Ethereum, such as reducing the cost of storing transaction data and storage demand, improving the cross-chain design, and changing the blocks\u2019 data structure, among others.\n\nDencun also aims to significantly reduce transaction costs for Optimism Rollups like Arbitrum or Optimism, attracting more users and enhancing Ethereum\u2019s scalability.\n\nBefore its finalization on Goreli, the development team had initially implemented Dencun on multiple testnets to check for possible problems. If Dencun operates smoothly without major bugs in all these testnet environments, the activation on the mainnet will be planned and scheduled within Q1/2024.\n\nWith the successful implementation, all eyes are set on Ethereum\u2019s price movement during the year\u2019s first quarter. Layer 2 protocols will also be in the spotlight since the Dencun upgrade is expected to bring major benefits to these protocols.\n\nAt the press time, Ethereum is trading at around $2,500, down 2.35% in the last 24 hours. The decline followed a report of the Ethereum Foundation engaging in the sale of ETH through over-the-counter (OTC) exchanges. Notably, the team conducted a transfer of 100 ETH (equivalent to $253,000) to address 0xd77, receiving 253,000 DAI in return.\n\nWhile ETH is a leading token, it will have to fight with other blockchains going forward. SOL, for example, is getting attention, and this could make it a real threat to ETH in the coming years.\n\nThroughout 2023, the organization reportedly liquidated 2,262 ETH at an average price of $1,609 per ETH. These divestitures are often observed preceding market declines, drawing attention within the cryptocurrency community.\n\nDespite these sales, the Ethereum Foundation maintains a substantial ETH portfolio. On-chain data indicates total ETH assets amounting to $886 million, comprising $806 million in ETH and $79.81 million in WETH. Additionally, they possess around $500,000 in stablecoins and $15,000 in Binance Coin (BNB)."

        "content": "Santiment\u2019s on-chain data recently signaled a notable bullish momentum for XRP (XRP). Meanwhile, Ethereum Classic\u2019s (ETC) rollercoaster performance in Q4 2023 and its upcoming Spiral Hard Fork adds complexity to the crypto landscape.\n\nYet, NuggetRush (NUGX) emerges as a standout altcoin, blending cryptocurrency, physical mining, and gold mining into a P2E NFT gaming platform.\n\n>>Visist NuggetRush Presale<<\n\nXRP (XRP) Bulls to Gain Momentum? Santiment On-Chain Data Signals Optimism\n\nOn January 14, 2024, Santiment on-chain data showed a significant bullish bias toward XRP (XRP). Bitcoin (BTC) had its historic moment in the past week after the SEC approved its exchange-traded funds that have been pending for many years.\n\nOn that note, sentiment toward large-cap assets remained optimistic, with a focus on them after the ETF approvals. On that note, traders have discussed the possibility of XRP ETF approvals.\n\nSantiment highlighted that XRP sentiment and discussion rates have surged to the highest levels since May 2023. That was when XRP social discussions increased weeks before the July 11 ruling, which stipulated that XRP was not a security.\n\nSeveral notable figures in the crypto space have speculated about the altcoin\u2019s possibility of having an ETF approved. Investors might be more ready to buy XRP due to fear of missing out, but so far, this doesn\u2019t seem to have pushed the prices higher.\n\nAt the time of this writing, XRP is trading at a 5% loss for the past 7 days.\n\nEthereum Classic\u2019s (ETC) Rollercoaster Q4 2023 Performance, Anticipation and Concerns Surrounding Spiral Hard Fork\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) performed well in Q4 2023, surging from $16.36 to $22.69 in December, a 36.19% increase. Nonetheless, Ethereum Classic (ETC) dropped to where it currently trades at around $25 on January 18th.\n\nThe Spiral Hard Fork, expected to go live on January 31, 2024, increases considerations for this market\u2019s participants. This upgrade aims to enhance compatibility and guarantee technical improvements for Ethereum Classic (ETC). However, experiences with hard forks in crypto have caused market uncertainties.\n\nInvestors and traders will approach ETC cautiously since the Ethereum Classic transition needs participants, including those in crypto mining and exchanges, to update software to adopt these changes. Future market sentiment around Ethereum Classic (ETC) might be influenced by possible challenges or uncertainties linked to the upgrade.\n\nBut, after the recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum Classic (ETC) awakened. Ethereum Classic (ETC) was trading at $27.03 on January 14, up 36.93% in that week. It has since retraced slightly, as mentioned above.\n\nUnlocking Adventure: NuggetRush (NUGX) Dominates Blockchain Gaming with Innovative P2E and NFT Integration\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX) blends cryptocurrency, physical world artisanal mining, and gold mining into a play-to-earn (P2E) NFT gaming platform. The integration of these elements rewards NuggetRush (NUGX) players with valuable in-game items and creates a thrilling gaming experience.\n\nSince it is a community-driven blockchain game, NuggetRush (NUGX) attempts to enable users to generate passive wealth. The game sets up a mining network and challenges players to operate successful mining businesses as they enjoy rewards.\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX) lets players start with a small amount of land and simple equipment. They must navigate the digital space, looking for collectibles offered as financial rewards.\n\nBesides earning potential, NuggetRush (NUGX) enables players to experience an enjoyable and realistic gaming adventure. It blends physical mining experience with strategic land discovery, thinking, and the fun of collaborating on mining tasks with the other players.\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX) players earn by trading in-game collectibles like character NFTs and RUSHGEMs on its marketplace. Notably, NuggetRush has recorded massive success, selling over 155 million NUGX tokens and raising more than $1.8 million.\n\nCurrently, NuggetRush (NUGX) has almost completed round 4 of its presale, valued at $0.015. Round 5 is coming up, and the token will surge to $0.018, assuming the round is successful.\n\nVisit NuggetRush Presale Website\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "title": "Ethereum's Layer 2 Debate: Buterin Aligns with Daniel Wang on Validium Classification - Blockchain.News",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin agrees with Daniel Wang on classifying Ethereum rollups using external data chains as validiums, not traditional rollups. This debate underscores the nuances in Ethereum's layer-2 scaling solutions, focusing on security and scalability trade-offs.\n\nEthereum's co-founder, Vitalik Buterin , has sparked a significant discussion in the crypto community regarding the classification and nature of layer 2 scaling solutions, especially focusing on the concept of validiums. This debate arises following Buterin's agreement with a statement by Daniel Wang, the founder of the Ethereum rollup solution Taiko, on the classification of certain layer-2 solutions as validiums.\n\nButerin concurred with Wang's view that Ethereum rollups utilizing external data chains, such as the modular blockchain Celestia, should be considered validiums rather than traditional rollups. The crux of this classification lies in the security guarantees provided by these solutions. Buterin emphasized that the essence of a rollup is its unconditional security guarantee, which allows users to recover their assets even in cases of collusion. This level of security is compromised when data availability relies on external systems, a characteristic of validium networks.\n\nValidiums, a subset of Ethereum scaling solutions, use zero-knowledge proofs to facilitate off-chain transactions while depending on Ethereum's mainnet for security and verification. Unlike zero-knowledge rollups that batch transactions on a layer-2 network and then verify them on Ethereum's main chain, validiums do not post full transaction data to the main chain. Instead, they post cryptographic proofs of the transactions' validity, aiming for greater scalability since the complete transaction data isn't stored on-chain. However, this approach has its drawbacks, notably in terms of data availability, as it depends on operators to post honest proofs.\n\nThe debate around validiums and their classification as layer-2 solutions is not just technical but also conceptual. It reflects the evolving nature of Ethereum's infrastructure and the diverse perspectives within its community. Buterin, in response to the debate, suggested new terminologies, proposing terms like \"strong\" for security-favoring systems and \"light\" for scale-favoring systems, such as validiums. This proposal is part of a broader conversation about the trade-offs between security, decentralization, and scalability in the development of Ethereum's layer-2 solutions.\n\nDespite the ongoing debates, the adoption of layer-2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism is increasing, indicating a growing interest and investment in Ethereum's scaling solutions. The upcoming Ethereum Merge upgrade is anticipated to further boost the efficiency and appeal of these networks.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum's journey mirrors the early days of the internet, evolving from a niche technology to a mainstream platform. As Ethereum undergoes significant technical transitions, including the layer-2 scaling transition, it faces challenges similar to those the internet overcame. This evolution, marked by debates like the one sparked by Buterin, is a testament to Ethereum's dynamic and innovative community, striving to balance scalability, security, and decentralization.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Santiment, a well-known on-chain data provider, recently unveiled informative data indicating that significant cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRPLedger, are presently encountering historically elevated levels of profit risk. This data presents valuable insights for both cryptocurrency investors and enthusiasts, offering a glimpse into potential trends and shifts in market dynamics.\n\nAs per Santiment\u2019s findings, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRPLedger have witnessed their respective profits rise to 83%, 84%, and 81%, respectively. These percentages notably surpass the historical averages, typically ranging from 55% to 75%, tracing back to 2018. While these percentages may appear promising, it is imperative to comprehend the context surrounding them.\n\nCryptocurrencies are renowned for their volatility, and their profitability levels can be influenced by diverse factors such as market sentiment, regulatory developments, and technological advancements. Despite the current elevated risk levels, the crypto market remains dynamic and susceptible to rapid changes.\n\nAlso Read: Whales Transfer over $780M in Bitcoin, Ethereum, DOGE and XRP\n\nOptimistic Outlook with ETFs and Increased Exposure\n\nThe report posits that cryptocurrencies still have growth potential, especially with heightened exposure from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and positive news developments. The crypto market has experienced a surge in interest from institutional investors, and the approval of ETFs could potentially bring more stability and legitimacy to the space.\n\nCrucial Signal for Long-Term Growth\n\nWhile predicting short-term market movements proves challenging, Santiment introduces an intriguing signal to monitor for potential long-term growth. A breach below 75% of the profits for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRPLedger could indicate a shift in market dynamics. This threshold acts as a benchmark for assessing the sustainability of their profitability levels.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Sales Pressure and ETF Inflows\n\nDespite the optimistic outlook, Bitcoin has recently encountered significant selling pressure, resulting in a 7% decline over the past week. Notably, this downturn contrasts with the robust inflows into Bitcoin ETFs during the same period. The lack of substantial price movement amid increased institutional interest prompts inquiries about the current state of the market and the influence of external factors on Bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\nXRPLedger\u2019s Profitable Supply\n\nXRPLedger, with its supply in profit hovering around 81.6 billion (81% of the total supply), presents an intriguing case. Although this figure reflects a decrease from a previous high, it still surpasses the lowest point recorded in October when the supply in profit dipped to about 71 billion (71% of the total supply). This suggests that XRPLedger has displayed resilience despite fluctuations in profit levels.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu, Bitcoin & Ethereum: 3 Boldest Price Predictions For 2024\n\nWhile positive developments like ETF approvals can contribute to market growth, monitoring profit levels below the 75% threshold may provide insights into the sustainability of cryptocurrency profitability.

        "content": "We\u2019ve analyzed multiple Ethereum mining apps for Android to help you understand why using them probably isn\u2019t the best idea and why any app claiming to offer \u201cEthereum mining\u201d is misleading.\n\nHowever, we don\u2019t want to leave you empty handed, so we\u2019ll also be featuring 5 Ethereum apps for Android that will enable you to earn ETH passively through staking.\n\nAre Ethereum mining apps for Android legit?\n\nThe short answer is no. The Ethereum cryptocurrency is secured through staking, and not mining. This has been the case since September of 2022, when an upgrade called The Merge removed the network\u2019s old Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism and introduced a new Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism.\n\nEven if Ethereum still used mining, no mobile phone on the market today would be powerful enough to mine it profitably.\n\nTherefore, any app that claims to provide Ethereum mining services is misleading at best and an outright scam at worst.\n\nWe were able to find 5 apps on the Google Play store that claim to be providing Ethereum mining or Ethereum cloud mining services. While the majority of these apps have a solid rating of 4 stars or more on the surface, a closer look at the reviews makes it obvious that the majority of 5-star reviews are not genuine. Meanwhile, there are a lot of genuine reviews with a 1-star rating that suggest the apps are not actually mining Ethereum. In some cases, the apps are even trying to convince users to buy another product.\n\nFor example, there are a lot of complaints from users saying that the app requires them to purchase a particular cryptocurrency wallet app before they can withdraw the ETH rewards they have supposedly earned.\n\nIf someone is asking you to pay to use a cryptocurrency wallet, that is a major red flag \u2014 legitimate cryptocurrency wallets, even those offering the most advanced features, can be downloaded for free. In fact, we haven\u2019t been able to find a single legitimate cryptocurrency wallet that is not completely free to use (apart from the fees blockchain networks charge for transactions).\n\nBest Android apps for earning Ethereum rewards\n\nThe bottom line is that you should avoid all apps that claim to be offering Ethereum mining. However, there are apps that will allow you to earn ETH passively, by giving you access to Ethereum staking. Please keep in mind that you\u2019ll need to already own some ETH if you want to earn additional ETH through staking.\n\nBinance - The world's top crypto exchange has an Ethereum staking feature\n\n- The world's top crypto exchange has an Ethereum staking feature Kraken - A rock-solid crypto exchange that allows users to earn ETH staking rewards\n\n- A rock-solid crypto exchange that allows users to earn ETH staking rewards Coinbase - Beginner-friendly crypto exchange with Ethereum staking feature\n\n- Beginner-friendly crypto exchange with Ethereum staking feature MetaMask - The best Ethereum wallet overall\n\n- The best Ethereum wallet overall Trust Wallet - A versatile crypto wallet that you can use to stake ETH and earn rewards\n\n1. Binance - The world's top crypto exchange has an Ethereum staking feature\n\nBinance is a leading cryptocurrency exchange that lists hundreds of different crypto assets and provides a diverse suite of services for crypto investors. This also includes Ethereum staking \u2014 if you have ETH, you can stake it on Binance to passively earn rewards.\n\nIf you stake ETH through Binance, you will receive WBETH tokens, which represent your staked ETH. The conversion rate between WBETH and ETH gradually increases in favor of WBETH through the time to reflect the rewards earned by the ETH Binance is staking on behalf of its users.\n\nIf you wish to get your ETH back, you can simply redeem your WBETH tokens and receive ETH in return. The amount of ETH you can earn this way is determined by the size of your stake (bigger is better) and the duration of your stake (longer is better).\n\nEarn ETH on Binance\n\n2. Kraken Pro - A rock-solid crypto exchange that allows users to earn ETH staking rewards\n\nKraken is a cryptocurrency exchange that has been operating for more than a decade and has built a strong reputation for keeping its users\u2019 fund safe even though many other exchanges have lost their customers\u2019 fund to hacks.\n\nIf you have ETH, you can stake it via the Kraken Pro app to benefit from staking rewards. Unlike Binance, which uses a token to represent staked ETH, the process on Kraken is more straightforward as there is no such token involved. However, the downside of Kraken\u2019s approach is that users can\u2019t get any liquidity from their staked ETH unless they unstake their coins.\n\nEarn ETH on Kraken\n\n3. Coinbase - Beginner-friendly crypto exchange with Ethereum staking feature\n\nCoinbase is a reputable crypto exchange that\u2019s known as one of the best crypto platforms for beginners. Coinbase provides an Ethereum staking service which allows ETH holders to earn additional rewards on their coins passively.\n\nUsers on Coinbase have the option to wrap their staked ETH coins and receive cbETH tokens. These tokens can be redeemed (or \u201cunwrapped\u201d) for ETH, but can be useful to still access the liquidity associated with your staked ETH.\n\nIf you\u2019re a long-term ETH holder that wants to put your idle coins to work, staking through Coinbase is certainly an option worth considering.\n\nEarn ETH on Coinbase\n\n4. MetaMask - The best Ethereum wallet overall\n\nThe previous ETH staking options we\u2019ve covered in this article are all facilitated through centralized cryptocurrency exchanges which stake users\u2019 ETH on their behalf. Now, let\u2019s take a look at some options to stake Ethereum in a more decentralized manner using on-chain liquid staking protocols.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with MetaMask, an extremely popular Ethereum wallet that also offers an Android app version. MetaMask offers a convenient staking option within the MetaMask portfolio feature that allows users to easily stake their ETH through liquid staking protocols such as Lido and Rocket Pool.\n\nThe added benefit of using MetaMask instead of a cryptocurrency exchange is that you remain in control of your private keys and don\u2019t have to trust anyone but yourself to keep them safe.\n\nGet MetaMask\n\n5. Trust Wallet - A versatile crypto wallet that you can use to stake ETH and earn rewards\n\nTrust Wallet is a very popular all-purpose crypto wallet that is available both as a browser extension or as a standalone desktop application.\n\nOne of Trust Wallet\u2019s biggest strengths is that it supports a truly impressive selection of cryptocurrencies, as it\u2019s not just limited to EVM-compatible blockchains. You can also use Trust Wallet to store Bitcoin, XRP, Solana and many other popular cryptocurrencies.\n\nTrust Wallet has a user-friendly interface designed to cater to both beginners and experienced users. Navigating the wallet is easy, allowing users to seamlessly view their portfolio value in their preferred currency, monitor their transaction history, and effectively manage multiple wallets.\n\nYou can use Trust Wallet to securely hold your ETH and use it in liquid staking protocols to earn staking rewards. Just like MetaMask, Trust Wallet is also a non-custodial wallet, which means that you control your own private keys.\n\nGet Trust Wallet\n\nThe bottom line\n\nHopefully, this article helped explain why there are no legitimate Ethereum mining apps available on the market. However, there are still ways to earn ETH using an Android app. For example, you can stake your ETH coins through a cryptocurrency exchange app or use an Ethereum wallet app to stake your coins via protocols such as Lido and Rocket Pool.\n\nIf you want to learn more on the topic of earning crypto with your phone, make sure to take a look at our list of the best crypto mining apps for Android."

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Jan. 18 that it has delayed its decision on Fidelity\u2019s proposed spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nMore specifically, the decision concerns a proposed rule change that would allow Cboe BZX to list and trade shares of Fidelity\u2019s planned fund.\n\nThe SEC noted that the proposed rule change was originally filed on Nov. 17, 2023 and published for comment in the federal register on Dec. 6, 2023.\n\nThe SEC said today that, based on those dates, it was previously required to approve, reject, or institute proceedings determining whether to disapprove the proposed rule change by Jan. 20. However, it has now chosen to use a provision that allows it to extend that deadline by 45 days to March 5, 2024.\n\nIt is likely that the SEC will choose to institute proceedings around Fidelity in March, as it done for certain other pending funds.\n\nSEC expected to decide on ETH ETFs in May\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said today that the Fidelity delay was \u201ccompletely expected\u201d and asserted that late May deadlines \u201creally matter.\u201d\n\nThat May deadline appears to be related to the fact that the SEC must either approve or reject VanEck\u2019s competing spot Ethereum ETF proposal by May 23.\n\nAs the SEC has already instituted proceedings on VanEck\u2019s application, it cannot delay its decision any further. And because the SEC generally approves similar ETFs together, it will likely decide on all pending spot Ethereum ETFs in late May, even though other applications have later deadlines.\n\nIt should also be noted that Fidelity, VanEck, and several other applicants succeeded in gaining approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 10. The success of those Bitcoin ETFs does not guarantee that Ethereum ETF proposals will also gain approval.\n\nPublic expectations are divided: one prediction market on Polymarket currently reports 54% odds in favor of spot Ethereum ETF approvals."

So, similar to spot BTC ETFs, potential spot ETH ETFs will open floodgates to institutional and retail capital.\n\nSeyffart\u2019s colleague Eric Balchunas believes the probability of the SEC approving an Ethereum ETF by May is 70%. As per Balchunas, the SEC\u2019s previous approval of ether futures-based ETFs in September 2023 will compel the regulator to give the green light since its approval of Bitcoin futures ETFs resulted in a court order to reevaluate Grayscale\u2019s bid to convert GBTC into a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nA likely approval of an ether exchange-traded fund coupled with the upcoming Dencun upgrade, which promises to improve the blockchain\u2019s scalability, could launch ETH to stratospheric new heights in 2024."

Concerning the testnets activation, client releases for both upgrades will be bundled and shared in a blog post on January 23.\n\nadvertisement\n\nQuick update from ACD call today:\n\n\u2013 Cancun/Deneb upgrade on Sepolia and Holesky testnets remain scheduled for activation on Jan 30 and Feb 7, respectively.\n\n\u2013 Client releases for both upgrades will be bundled and shared in a blog post next Tues.\n\n\u2013 Full writeup from today's call\u2026 \u2014 Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) January 18, 2024\n\nThe Ethereum Dencun Upgrade has been expected for a very long time with the launch scheduled for 2023 but due to certain discrepancies, the launch was consistently postponed to a more preferred date. It was sometime in October that client developers confirmed that they would not be implementing the hardfork before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cThere is no way we are implementing a mainnet fork in 2023,\u201d pseudonymous Prysm developer, Potuz stated.\n\nIt turned out to be that the developer clients for the consensus layer and the execution layer were at odds among themselves, further contributing to the delays experienced thus far.\n\nProposed Phased Launch of the Upgrade\n\nThe eventual launch on the Goerli test network indicates a significant milestone toward the integration into the Ethereum mainnet. The deployment on the Goerli testnet came with the implementation of EIP-4844.\n\nEIP-4844 is a revolutionary transaction mechanism colloquially referred to as Proto-Danksharding. It brings with it a system that reduces transaction costs for Decentralized Applications (DApps). This is achieved by allowing Ethereum nodes to temporarily store and access off-chain data. It effectively reduces the strain on storage resources, according to the description given by Ethereum developers.\n\nSoon, this will contribute to enhancing the efficiency of Layer-2 rollup chains\n\nThe upcoming deployment of the Ethereum Dencun Upgrade on Sepolia and Holesky testnets is largely dependent on what happens on the Goerli testnet in the coming weeks. By the time the upgrade is functioning smoothly on the three testnets, activation will be the next goal. The choice of a phased launch of the Ethereum Dencun Upgrade is to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Ethereum Dencun Upgrade follows the Ethereum Shapella upgrade of 2023."

The fund which is currently valued at approximately $25 million, comes with an allocation of 400 million COTI tokens.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn the long run, it would offer support to projects from developers who are interested in contributing to the growth and success of the COTI ecosystem by researching, developing, and building within COTI V2. As such, COTI is geared up to start inking strategic partnerships with interested parties. Soda Labs, a leading player in cryptographic Multi-Party Computation (MPC) is the first project to receive funding.\n\nPrecisely, Soda Labs will focus on leading research that is targeted at expanding practical applications for garbling protocols, to ensure a secure and scalable privacy network for COTI users. Dr. Avishay Yanai, one of the co-founders of Soda Labs, confirmed the company\u2019s previous effort toward innovation in the garbling circuit protocol. Therefore, the alliance with COTI is a stepping stone towards reaching its goal.\n\nCOTI Aims to Accelerate Ethereum Privacy\n\nThe plan to advance into a Layer-2 network that encourages Ethereum privacy has been ongoing for many months but it was not until a few weeks ago that COTI commenced the gradual release of the upgrade. COTI\u2019s CEO Shahaf Bar-Geffen stated that the Ethereum privacy-centered fund marks a monumental step for the firm.\n\n\u201cThe creation of this fund by the COTI Foundation is integral in driving both the adoption of COTI V2 and the development of applications within the ecosystem,\u201d Bar-Geffen added.\n\nCOTI looks forward to making more meaningful connections in the coming months that support its newly launched Ethereum privacy vision. One of COTI\u2019s plans for the future is the addition of a developer\u2019s grant program distributed amongst milestones. This will contribute significantly to the holistic growth strategy of the COTI V2 ecosystem. This strategic move from COTI is likely to improve Ethereum adoption and integration in the long run."

With a large portion of each asset\u2019s supply already in profit, the potential for a mass selloff is heightened. This is especially true if broader market conditions turn sour or negative news specific to any of the three cryptocurrencies emerges.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nThey posit that, as facilitated by ETFs, institutional interest might steer prices upward despite the elevated profit percentages.\n\nNot every instance of high-profit percentages has resulted in significant selloffs as the crypto market is influenced by multifaceted factors, making it challenging to predict a uniform outcome based on this metric.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe current high levels of \u201cPercent of Total Supply in Profit\u201d suggest a heightened risk of price corrections for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. While not a definitive prediction of a downturn, this metric is a valuable indicator for investors to watch as they navigate the ever-volatile world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nTo learn more about the impact of Bitcoin ETFs facing a ban in Singapore and the eligibility concerns surrounding it, dive into the details here:\n\nBitcoin ETFs Banned in Singapore Over Eligibility Concerns\n\n\n\nCurious about the Howey Test facing scrutiny as a judge challenges the SEC\u2019s interpretation?

Discover SCENE\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has pushed back its deadline for a decision on Fidelity's proposed spot Ethereum ETF to March 5.\n\nAccording to a Thursday filing, the SEC \"finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change,\" in order to ensure that it has \"sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.\"\n\nBloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart said that the delay was \"completely expected,\" adding that, \"Dates that really matter are late May in my view.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFidelity applied for its spot Ethereum ETF in November 2023, joining the likes of BlackRock, Ark Invest/21shares and VanEck.\n\nFidelity #ethereum ETF delayed just now. Completely expected. Dates that really matter are late May in my view. https://t.co/8mvhcPRaS7 \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 18, 2024\n\nSeyffart's colleague Eric Balchunas expressed confidence that an Ethereum ETF would be approved in 2024 earlier this month, asserting that there is a 70% chance of an approval by May. Speaking on Rug Radio's FOMO Hour, Balchunas said that the SEC's prior approval of Ethereum futures ETFs has backed the regulator into a corner, since its approval of Bitcoin futures ETFs resulted in a court order to review Grayscale's spot Bitcoin ETF application.\n\nThe SEC last week approved multiple spot Bitcoin ETF applications, with chair Gary Gensler conceding that circumstances had \"changed\" following the court order.\n\n\u201cIpso facto, you have to approve an Ether spot [ETF], or you\u2019re going to get sued again for the same exact reason,\u201d Balchunas said during a Rug Radio appearance late last week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn his statement following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, SEC chair Gensler took pains to state that \"today\u2019s Commission action is cabined to ETPs holding one non-security commodity,\" Bitcoin, and that \"It should in no way signal the Commission\u2019s willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities.\" Gensler added that, \"Nor does the approval signal anything about the Commission\u2019s views as to the status of other crypto assets under the federal securities laws.\"\n\nDuring his term as SEC chair, Gensler has repeatedly refused to clarify whether the regulator considers Ethereum a security or a commodity.\n\nPrior to taking his position at the regulator, while teaching a course on blockchain at MIT, Gensler stated that Ethereum is \"not a security\" in the eyes of the SEC, noting that it considered the cryptocurrency \"sufficiently decentralized\" that it doesn't qualify. Gensler was seemingly mirroring the opinion of the SEC's former Director of Corporate Finance William Hinman in his much-cited \"sufficiently decentralized\" speech of June 2018.\n\nGensler's fellow regulator, chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Rostin Behnam, has expressed the view that Ethereum should be considered a commodity."

In this article, we\u2019ll delve into the intricate comparison between these two giants, exploring their histories, technologies, use cases and future outlooks.\n\nHistorical Context\n\nGenesis of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin, introduced in 2009 by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, marked the inception of decentralized digital currency. Its limited supply of 21 million coins set the stage for a unique economic model.\n\nEmergence of Ethereum\n\nEthereum, proposed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015, expanded on Bitcoin\u2019s capabilities. It introduced smart contracts, self-executing contracts with coded terms.\n\nTechnology Underlying Ethereum and Bitcoin\n\nBlockchain Technology\n\nBoth cryptocurrencies rely on blockchain technology, a decentralized ledger ensuring transparency and immutability.\n\nSmart Contracts in Ethereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s distinctive feature is the integration of smart contracts, allowing automated and trustless execution of agreements.\n\nMining Processes\n\nWhile both use proof-of-work, Ethereum has plans to transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism to address scalability concerns.\n\nSupply Mechanism\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Fixed Supply\n\nBitcoin\u2019s capped supply adds scarcity, often likened to gold, making it a store of value.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Evolving Supply\n\nEthereum, with its uncapped supply, aims to balance inflation and network security.\n\nUse Cases and Applications\n\nBitcoin as Digital Gold\n\nBitcoin is often dubbed \u201cdigital gold\u201d due to its store-of-value function, attracting long-term investors.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Versatile Applications\n\nEthereum\u2019s blockchain serves as a platform for various applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nReal-World Implications\n\nBoth cryptocurrencies impact real-world scenarios, but Ethereum\u2019s applications extend beyond finance.\n\nTransaction Speed and Scalability\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Transaction Speed Limitations\n\nBitcoin\u2019s transaction speed is relatively slower compared to Ethereum, limiting its use for daily transactions.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Scalability Solutions\n\nEthereum addresses scalability challenges through ongoing upgrades, such as Ethereum 2.0.\n\nDecentralization\n\nComparative Analysis of Decentralization\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum differ in their degrees of decentralization, influencing security and resistance to censorship.\n\nImpact on Security and Censorship Resistance\n\nThe decentralized nature of both networks contributes to their resilience against attacks and censorship.\n\nDevelopment Community\n\nSize and Influence of Bitcoin\u2019s Community\n\nBitcoin boasts a robust community, but Ethereum\u2019s community actively contributes to its continuous development.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Vibrant Developer Ecosystem\n\nEthereum\u2019s open-source nature attracts developers, fostering innovation and new projects.\n\nMarket Performance\n\nHistorical Price Trends\n\nBitcoin\u2019s historical price volatility contrasts with Ethereum\u2019s more dynamic price movements.\n\nFactors Influencing Price Movements\n\nMarket sentiment, regulatory developments, and technological upgrades influence the price of both cryptocurrencies.\n\nRegulatory Environment\n\nGlobal Regulatory Stance on Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin\u2019s regulatory status varies globally, with some countries embracing it and others imposing restrictions.\n\nChallenges and Opportunities for Ethereum\n\nEthereum faces challenges and opportunities within the evolving regulatory landscape.\n\nFuture Outlook\n\nPotential Developments in Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin\u2019s future may involve increased institutional adoption and integration into traditional finance.\n\nEvolution of Ethereum\u2019s Ecosystem\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey includes the transition to Ethereum 2.0, aiming for improved scalability and sustainability.\n\nRisks and Concerns\n\nSecurity Vulnerabilities\n\nBoth cryptocurrencies face security threats, from 51% attacks to vulnerabilities in smart contracts.\n\nMarket Volatility and Risks\n\nInvestors must navigate the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency markets and be aware of potential risks.\n\nAccessibility and Adoption\n\nEase of Access for Investors\n\nBitcoin\u2019s simplicity attracts entry-level investors, while Ethereum\u2019s complexity may appeal to those seeking diverse opportunities.\n\nMainstream Adoption Trends\n\nBoth cryptocurrencies strive for mainstream adoption, with varied approaches and challenges.\n\nCommunity Sentiment\n\nPublic Perceptions and Sentiments\n\nPublic sentiment toward Bitcoin often revolves around its potential as a hedge against inflation, while Ethereum is appreciated for its innovation.\n\nOnline Discussions and Forums\n\nForums and social media platforms showcase vibrant discussions and opinions about the two cryptocurrencies.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the comparison between Ethereum and Bitcoin unveils their unique strengths and weaknesses. While Bitcoin remains a stalwart store of value, Ethereum\u2019s versatility and ongoing development attract a diverse range of applications. As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, both offer distinct opportunities for investors and enthusiasts alike."

In this regard, Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko says to expect an announcement with client releases in the coming week.\n\nQuick update from ACD call today:\n\n- Cancun/Deneb upgrade on Sepolia and Holesky testnets remain scheduled for activation on Jan 30 and Feb 7, respectively.\n\n- Client releases for both upgrades will be bundled and shared in a blog post next Tues.\n\n- Full writeup from today's call\u2026 \u2014 Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) January 18, 2024\n\nThe much-anticipated Dencun upgrade follows last year's Shapella upgrade. According to ETH developers, it will first be deployed to the Goerli testnet, then, if no major issues are found, to Sepolia and Holesky. Once Dencun is running smoothly on all three testnets, mainnet activation will be scheduled.\n\nDuring the week, the Dencun network upgrade was activated on the Goerli testnet. The upgrade included several changes, most notably the introduction of ephemeral data blobs with EIP-4844, also known as \"protodanksharding,\" which will help slash L2 transaction fees.\n\nEthereum developer Tim Beiko recounts the events that led to Goerli not finalizing immediately after the Dencun upgrade was initiated. Due to Goerli having an open validator set, there was an expected but significant drop in validator participation at the fork.\n\nIn addition to this, a client bug on the network with Prysm set the historical root value to 0 instead of copying over the last historical root when Deneb was activated.\n\nOnce the bug showed up on Goerli, its cause was found, a fix was made and a release was put out shortly after.\n\nWith more validators coming online and one client team upgrading some nodes that had been missed, the Goerli network eventually finalized.\n\nWith this significant milestone reached, Ethereum developers are now proceeding to fork the Sepolia and Holesky testnets before the mainnet launch.\n\nThe much-anticipated Dencun upgrade combines changes to both Ethereum's consensus and execution layers. The list of protocol changes includes: EIP-1153: Transient storage opcodes; EIP-4788: Beacon block root in the EVM; EIP-4844: Shard Blob Transactions; EIP-5656: MCOPY (memory copying instruction); EIP-6780: SELFDESTRUCT only in the same transaction; EIP-7044: Perpetually Valid Signed Voluntary Exits; EIP-7045: Increase Max Attestation Inclusion Slot; EIP-7514: Add Max Epoch Churn Limit and EIP-7516: BLOBBASEFEE opcode."

        "title": "Could MetaMask's Secret Project Shake Up Ethereum? - CoinDesk",
        "content": "There is a secret project going on over at Meta mask and it could shake up how Ethereum works. I'm intrigued. So joining us right now is deputy managing editor of Tech and Protocols. Sam Kessler. Sam. So nice to see you. Good to see you. It's been a little while. I miss the hash days. We all do. We all know R I pr IP. All right. Tell us, tell us about the secret project, what's going on. Yeah. So Meta Mask, which is um one of the biggest crypto wallets, the biggest crypto wallet by far on Ethereum um is um putting together this secret project where they're changing the way that the app works. So conventionally, um when you're using a crypto wallet and when you're transacting on a Blockchain, more generally, what you do is you submit a transaction. So you want to trade some tokens, you'll go to unis swap, a decentralized exchange or sushi swap, another decentralized exchange and you go to one of these, you choose the, the specific specific exchange you want to go to. You say, hey, I want to sell these tokens. You find the specific price that you're gonna sell those tokens at you don't want to go above this price below this price. You specify a bunch of different things, bless you. You specify a bunch of different things. And then um what you end up doing is um submitting a a transaction um that you know, does what you specified, but now me mask and a bunch of other programs that are kind of following. Um Well, that metamask is more than one following are are switching to this idea of intents where instead of having to submit a specific transaction, what you do is you submit a general intent. The idea like, hey, I just want to sell a token, um get me the best price and then meta mask behind the scenes through some mechanism that they're putting together and that's what this news is about. Um you know, figures out how to route your transaction to get or, you know, route a series of transactions to accomplish what you want to accomplish. Um I know that's like kind of a AAA jumble of a lot of different things, but hopefully that at a high level um explains it. So what does that mean for the end user folks who are interacting with meta mask? Yeah, so I mean, the two big benefits are first user experience. Now, you don't have to, you know, suss out exactly what the best venue is for a given action on a Blockchain. There's a million different ways to do different things and you know, you don't have to do any of that leg work anymore. Um Meta mask can handle it for you in the future as this stuff rolls out. And the second thing for end users. Um So it's user experience, but the second thing is just price um fees. Um you know, all of those things that people are typically mindful of. Meta ma can take care of, they can help you avoid mev bots maximal extractable value. You can look that up. But the idea of people in the Ethereum ecosystem front running your transactions, they'll help you avoid that. They'll help you get the cheapest gas, they'll help you, you know, find the best route for your transaction. Maybe you should arbitrage a bunch of weird ways to get a better price for your tokens. I mean, this is like one example, but there's a bunch of ways where uh uh ostensibly this should help you out, but there's also some risks. I want to talk about the risks in just a second. But how did you find out about this secret? And why is it a secret? Yeah, it's a good question. And the second part, the why is it a secret plays into some of the risk question frankly. But um you know, I found out about it from just Ethereum ecosystem. People who will not be named won't be named. Don't want to be named um who kind of heard about this and for various reasons, you know, just wanted to give me, you know, bits and pieces of it. And then when I went to Meta Mask and I was like, hey, I know Xy and Z um first they were like, hey, no, um you know, please don't, you know, publish this until such and such a time. But, you know, they knew we were going to publish something anyway. And so they were willing to get on the record and the story that we published yesterday and specify the, the some of the um you know, more specific details of the, of the project. And so that's why we know with 100% certainty. Um This is what's happening. OK. Now, before we take this home, tell us about the risks, the challenges that are presented with this. Yeah. So, you know, um I, I've kind of like given the explanation of this at a high level, it's kind of like a black box, right where it's like now I put it in an intent and I say, hey, I want to sell my tokens. I want to do this, I want to do this and then meta mask handles it. What does that mean? What that means is they rely on third parties, a marketplace of third parties who auction against one another through some, you know, complicated mechanism in order to get the privilege to carry your transaction or your series of transactions or figure out what your transactions should be from point A to point B. Now again, that, that's confusing. It sounds like this kind of like a morphus thing. But what really matters at a fundamental level here is that meta mask, the biggest crypto wallet on a theory and behind, you know, so like the Lions share of transactions in decentralized finance on the, the biggest decentralized finance ecosystem is now making a fundamental change to who and how it routes your transactions where now it and at least this mechanism it's routed. Um It's creating has a ton of leeway over how it decides to funnel different transactions from users. So say, and, and I'm not saying this at all, but say meta mass for whatever reason behind the scenes decided that it was going to somehow configure its mechanism to route all trades to unis swap. There's reasons why it would do the opposite of that. But you know, say it decided to do that, that would be a big problem for users. Now, meta mask in this story explains a lot of ways why um you know how this is not centralized, this is not vertical integration, it prevents specifically against the case that I've mentioned right there. But this is something that we'll be taking a look at and the mechanism that they're putting together to assure neutrality is going to be closely scrutinized to avoid the sort of outcomes of, you know, centralized control, monopoly and also regulatory capture the idea of regulators looking at something like this and being like, huh there's a company that in some form or fashion has a big chokehold over where transactions flow in this really valuable ecosystem. Um Yeah, I it's complicated but really important as you're explaining the risks. I know two different stories, two totally different things. I was just thinking about ledger recover and the backlash that they received for that product because of uh centralization. Do you think that once this is launched, we could see similar backlash just from, from users? Yeah. So the Ledger recover case, which is a crypto wallet. Um There was like a bug or not even a bug but a capability in their software where, you know, there was a sort of backdoor situation people could go in and essentially by hacking people in a certain way, get their tokens in a manner that Ledger said it specifically prevented against. This is a little bit different because the code for this theoretically is all going to be public in in um in a way that should prevent against such a surprise. Um But it is similar um from the standpoint that the marketing of this product is going to need to match the way that it works in actual, you know, day to day, you know execution. So if meta s says we're creating this incredibly neutral, credibly, neutral and incredibly neutral platform where anybody can join in it's permissionless. Anybody can carry user, any third party can join to compete with one another to carry user transactions in a way that is, you know, neutral and balanced and so on and so forth. But then we realize that hey, some of these third parties are way more powerful and therefore accrue in the way that this system is constructed. A lot of the power. Again, we're being vague here because we don't have all the details and this market hasn't shaken out yet. But if that ends up happening, that is out of alignment with the marketing. And so people are gonna want to take a close look at it and might be concerned. Sam, thank you very much for joining me and explaining that story to us. I'm sure you'll be watching closely on next development. So we'll have you back on to tell us about the latest updates. Yeah, good to see you, Jen. Thanks for having me. That was deputy managing editor of Tech and Protocols at Coindesk. Sam Kessler."

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nRecently the market sentiment on the two coins SOL and ETH has seen many price fluctuations since the start of the year. Now that Glassnode co-founders, Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, known as Negentropic, have projected Solana (SOL) to potentially outperform Ethereum (ETH) by 500% the market is curious to know if this will be true.\n\nExperts Waged Debate on Solana Price\n\nThis optimistic outlook follows discussions with macroeconomist Henrik Zeberg and Global Macroinvestor CEO Raoul Pal, who highlighted Solana\u2019s magical momentum in the SOL/ETH chart in terms of risk-adjusted returns on the Crypto Banter Show.\n\nThey both have a similar outlook on SOL\u2019s upward movement in the chart is an indicator that it will surpass ETH soon. Looking at the key trajectories of Solana, the analysts are also betting $10000 investment in SOL as they expect it will rise in the coming weeks while answering the interviewer.\n\nTo give a more concrete example, the co-founders of Glassnode look at the current SOL/ETH ratio, which is 0.14. Based on their prediction, this ratio is expected to go up a lot, possibly hitting 0.76. If this happens, it means that Solana will do four to five times better than Ethereum as the crypto market continues to rise during this bullish phase.\n\nBut he has similar hopes with ETH too. He notes that this potential outperformance could continue until the cryptocurrency market reaches its peak. Importantly, the analysis doesn\u2019t envision a solo surge for Solana; instead, it anticipates a significant bullish rally for Ethereum as well.\n\nCurrent Market Sentiments\n\nWhile Solana is currently trading at $98.55 with a 4.7% weekly decline, and Ethereum at $2,516 with a similar decline, the Glassnode founders express confidence in Solana\u2019s continued success. Despite recent fluctuations, Solana has exhibited a robust one-year trajectory, growing by 340.43% from $20. Ethereum, in comparison, has a one-year growth of 59%, rising from $1,515.\n\nSince both coins are rising on distinct parameters, the market is still divided. Only time will tell who wins."

It was last down 1.25% at $2,484.\n\nSpotonchain reports that another massive whale with $25.8 million in total profit from ETH has taken advantage of the recent market dip to accumulate more tokens. The said whale recently withdrew a large chunk, 3,600 ETH worth $8.84 million, from the Binance crypto exchange, buying at a lower price.\n\nETH developers tease big announcement for Dencun upgrade\n\nThis week, Ethereum developers deployed the Dencun upgrade, which includes proto-danksharding (EIP-4844) on the Goerli testnet. This is a forerunner to projected deployment on the Ethereum mainnet, which is expected for the first quarter of 2024.\n\nAccording to Ethereum Core developer Tim Beiko, Sepolia will be forking on Jan. 30 and Holesky on Feb. 7, while urging the community to expect an announcement regarding client releases in the upcoming week.\n\n\n\nAs for what might come after the Dencun upgrade, Paradigm predicts the Prague hard fork on Ethereum testnets by Q3,2024, and the mainnet by the end of the year."

        "content": "Metamask has started testing a new technology meant to help Ethereum users collaborate with third parties to improve the efficiency and affordability of their crypto transactions. If successful, the feature will give users much more agency on how to perform transactions, effectively changing the shift in power between validators and users.\n\nThe \u201ctransaction routing\u201d feature is being developed in partnership with Special Mechanisms Group (SMG), a subsidiary of Consensys. Consensys, which is MetaMask\u2019s parent company, confirmed the testing of the feature to CoinDesk. The development of the feature would represent a change in the paradigm for blockchain, resulting in more user-friendly and effective transactions.\n\nETH transaction prices are high, and don\u2019t make sense for small amounts of money. With better options out there, ETH is in a losing position at the moment.\n\nFrom \u201cHow\u201d to \u201cWhat\u201d\n\nAs confirmed to CoinDesk by SMG director Jason Linehan, the \u201ctransaction routing\u201d being developed would be a new form of Intent-centric protocol. These protocols focus on helping users achieve a specific objective when performing transactions, instead of requiring them to specify how such transactions will take place.\n\nThis means that users would be able to determine if they want to sell a token at the best price, improve transaction efficiency, or reduce gas fees. Traditionally, users would have to find the right \u201crecipe\u201d of conditions to have such an outcome take place.\n\n\u201cTransaction Routing\u201d would make this a thing of the past by letting third parties take part in the process to help achieve the desired outcome on behalf of the user. Such an approach has already been explored by other parties, often recurring to mempools (both private and public), but has failed to find widespread adoption.\n\nWhat Makes MetaMask\u2019s Approach Unique?\n\nWhile not many details are known so far, Linehan has stated that MetaMask\u2019s approach wouldn\u2019t be a \u201ccentralized solution\u201d nor a \u201cvertical integration\u201d like other intent-centric protocols. Instead, an approach similar to that of an \u201cauction-based optimization method\u201d would allow the new feature to differentiate itself.\n\nThe feature is designed to be permissionless and have mechanisms to ensure that \u201csearchers, builders, and solvers\u201d of all sizes can collaborate, according to Linehan. The feature is also likely to be open-sourced, which will play a role in the way it is licensed once the project gets to that stage.\n\nSome of the elements developed for this new routing technology are already powering MetaMask\u2019s \u201cSmart Swaps\u201d feature. As the development of the technology continues, the capabilities of the feature will continue to expand while remaining optional.\n\nMetaMask\u2019s Expansion Beyond Ethereum Continues\n\nIn a move reflective of MetaMask\u2019s commitment to expanding its reach, the MetaMask Snaps plugin has now found its way into the Hedera ecosystem. MetaMask\u2019s 30 million users can now make use of the Hedera Wallet Snap plugin to access Hedera applications that couldn\u2019t make use of MetaMask-based functionality in the past.\n\nThe Snaps plugin was developed by Tuum Technologies to extend the functionality of MetaMask by making it possible for developers to create custom plugins. This means that developers no longer need to depend on the Hedera JSON-RPC Relay, simplifying the development process and making Hedera compatible with EVM-based applications.\n\nThe launch was categorized as \u201cpivotal\u201d by The Hbar Foundation CEO Shayn Hygdon, who also stated that \u201cmore features and functionality\u201d would be announced in the future as this was \u201cjust a first step\u201d. By making it possible for developers to expand MetaMask\u2019s functionality in such a way, the HBAR Foundation.\n\nETH transaction prices will need to come down, one way or the other. If they don\u2019t there won\u2019t be a market for small ETH transactions."

        "content": "In an unexpected turn of events, an Ethereum (ETH) whale has reemerged from the depths of crypto hibernation to make a staggering investment in popular cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB). Etherscan data reveals that the wallet address \"0xfb2\" executed a series of purchases, acquiring a whopping 606.36 billion SHIB within the past 24 hours, amounting to a substantial $5.80 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis sudden buying spree catapults the mysterious investor to the top of the Shiba Inu token buyers' list for the given period. As a result, the whale's cryptocurrency portfolio now boasts an impressive 733.21 billion SHIB, valued at $6.97 million. Remarkably, Shiba Inu has swiftly risen to become the second-largest holding in the investor's portfolio, trailing only behind Ethereum.\n\nEthereum, with a substantial holding of 52,618 ETH, retains its position as the leading asset in the whale's portfolio, valued at an impressive $132.92 million. The cumulative value of the investor's entire portfolio currently stands at an estimated $182.76 million.\n\nDelving into on-chain data, it is evident that the initial foray into Shiba Inu by this Ethereum whale occurred two years ago. At that time, the unidentified individual procured nearly 200 billion SHIB, setting the stage for what is now a significant and attention-grabbing resurgence in their Shiba Inu holdings.\n\nAs the crypto market continues to evolve, the sudden interest of major players like this mysterious ETH whale in the Shiba Inu token adds an element of intrigue, leaving SHIB enthusiasts and traders eager to see how the situation unfolds in the days to come."

        "content": "Share:\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed its decision on Fidelity\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF, per a filing.\n\nDespite the spot Bitcoin ETF approval setting a precedent, the SEC stated that it needs time to consider the issues raised following evaluation.\n\nThis was expected of the regulator, given its response in the past, and the next deadline is now on March 8.\n\nEthereum price remained stationary around $2,450, unaffected by the decision, but is losing the strength to reclaim $2,500.\n\nThe crypto market faced a long battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) when it attempted to secure a spot in Bitcoin ETF, which finally came to fruition when the court interfered. Now, it seems like Ethereum is set to witness the same ordeal as the SEC is taking two steps back after rejecting the spot ETH ETF application.\n\nSEC says no to Ethereum ETF\n\nAfter a long, drawn-out battle for the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF, it was expected that Ethereum or other assets might not have to deal with the SEC in this regard. The reason was that spot BTC ETF, backed by the court, likely established a precedent for exchange-traded products (ETP) of such kind, but by the looks of it, this did not happen.\n\nThe SEC, in a filing today, delayed its decision on Fidelity\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF application. The regulatory body took an early decision as the deadline for the same was set on January 21. The final deadline for the SEC is on March 8, though this will likely get extended, too, given the present scenario.\n\nThere is a chance the SEC might not obstruct the process this time, given its brush with the law last year. i.e., Grayscale\u2019s lawsuit against the regulator. Furthermore, just like the last time, there is not just one applicant as seven major asset management firms have applied to issue their spot ETH ETF.\n\nThis includes the likes of BlackRock, ARK & 21Shares, and Grayscale too, which is attempting to convert the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot ETF. Grayscale was the biggest catalyst in making Bitcoin ETF a reality, giving Ethereum ETFs a strong backup.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF applicants\n\nEthereum price sees nothing\n\nEthereum price did not react exorbitantly as the altcoin remained mostly undisturbed and unaffected by the SEC\u2019s decision. This can be seen in the chart below, where the second-generation cryptocurrency is keeping above the $2,450 support line.\n\nThis shows that the market had been expecting something like this to happen, hence the lack of bearishness at present. However, even if there is no bearishness, it does not translate to an abundance of bullishness either. The price indicators Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) are both showing receding bullishness in the market.\n\nThe most harm this could do to Ethereum would likely be a correction to $2,356, where a bounce-off would revive the rally.\n\nETH/USD 1-day chart\n\nHowever, a rally to $2,600 and beyond would invalidate the bearish thesis and set a new multi-month high for the Ethereum price."

The ability of whales to navigate these fluctuations and capitalize on market dips demonstrates the sophisticated strategies employed by some players in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nWhales in action\n\nIn the initial tweet, Lookonchain mentioned that there appeared to be a whale engaging in the purchase of BTC. The tweet revealed that amid the recent market decline, a newly created wallet executed a withdrawal of 700 BTC ($29.36 million) from Binance, acquiring them at an average price of $41,948.\n\nIt seems that a whale is buying $BTC!\n\n\n\nIn the recent market drop, a new wallet withdrew 700 $BTC($29.36M) from #Binance at an average price of $41,948.https://t.co/5kE1l0mJlo pic.twitter.com/Fj1thu4C6x \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 19, 2024\n\nThis move by the Bitcoin whale suggests a strategic acquisition during the market downturn, showcasing confidence in the long-term potential of the leading cryptocurrency. The substantial withdrawal from Binance at a specific price point raises questions about the whale's market timing and their anticipation of a potential rebound.\n\nLookonchain's second tweet continued the narrative by stating that, following the recent decline in the price of Ethereum , a discerning whale had acquired 3,600 ETH ($8.9 million) at a lower price. The tweet highlighted the whale's proficiency in purchasing ETH at lower values and selling them at higher points, resulting in a current profit of approximately $25.8 million.\n\nAfter the price of $ETH dropped today, this smart whale bought 3,600 $ETH($8.9M) back at a lower price 5 hours ago.\n\n\n\nThis whale is very good at buying $ETH at low prices and selling $ETH at highs.\n\n\n\nThe profit is ~$25.8M currently!https://t.co/UzXbheftr1 pic.twitter.com/DannZzsQVk \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 19, 2024\n\nAs of the latest update, the current Bitcoin price is $41,414, reflecting a 2.97% decrease in the last 24 hours and a 9.69% drop in the last seven days.

        "content": "Cardano (ADA) has proven that it can outshine Ethereum (ETH), the industry\u2019s largest smart contract network, in one of the most understated ways.\n\nAccording to data from crypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock (ITB), the 30-day volume of large transactions on Cardano has far outstripped that of Ethereum. This update comes in the wake of the general market push to wriggle out of the current bearish situation that is playing out in the ecosystem thus far.\n\nCardano\u2019s market price and capitalization are down by 2.56% in the past 24 hours to $0.5177 and $18,322,533,885, respectively, as the trading volume has dropped by 15.56% to $285,507,234. Ethereum has a milder growth rate, having slipped by 0.85% in 24 hours to $2,516.35.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe Cardano Advantage\n\nOver the past few months, Cardano has always recorded massive inflows from market whales. Despite the dampened sentiments overall, the IntoTheBlock data showed that a total of $13 billion in large transactions is settled on the Cardano blockchain on average daily. By definition, the platform considers ADA transactions above $100,000 in fiat value as \u2018Large.\u2019\n\nCardano whales have been quite active for the past few months. $13B in large transactions (>$100k) is being settled on Cardano daily on average. A significant amount, if you compare it to Ethereum's $5B 7-day average. pic.twitter.com/8rjeQZaonU \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 18, 2024\n\nBy comparison, Ethereum only records a total of $5 billion in whale transactions on average per week. At the moment, the bearish sentiment in the market has subtly tilted the whale transaction trend in Ethereum\u2019s favor per rate of change over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe data from IntoTheBlock shows that Ethereum\u2019s large transactions have soared by 6.74% to $4.16 in 24 hours. Cardano on the other hand maintains a larger volume pegged at $11.24 billion but with an 8.74% slump within the same period.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWill Cardano Flip Ethereum?\n\nJust the way there is a fight for dominance in the memecoin world, so also is there a foundational tussle amongst Layer-1 networks to outshine one another. One of the biggest ambitions of Cardano community members is to see the protocol flip Ethereum in market capitalization in the long term.\n\nThis is a distant dream, considering Cardano\u2019s $18.3 billion market cap is just a fraction of Ethereum\u2019s $302,549,903,898 capitalization. For the foreseeable future, Cardano may need to relish its areas of strength, including whale volume and developer activity."

        "content": "In a noteworthy development, Cardano ($ADA) has emerged as a frontrunner in terms of the volume of substantial transactions over the last 30 days, outshining Ethereum ($ETH) in this unique aspect.\n\nThis positive shift comes amid the broader market\u2019s collective effort to break free from the persisting downtrend.\n\nAccording to insights provided by IntoTheBlock, the 30-day volume of significant transactions on the Cardano network has witnessed a substantial surge, surpassing the equivalent figures for Ethereum.\n\nNotably, ADA whales have been notably active in recent months, contributing to an impressive total of $13 billion in transactions exceeding $100,000. This surge signals a revitalization of the Cardano network.\n\nCardano whales have been quite active for the past few months. $13B in large transactions (>$100k) is being settled on Cardano daily on average. A significant amount, if you compare it to Ethereum's $5B 7-day average. pic.twitter.com/8rjeQZaonU \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 18, 2024\n\nEthereum Maintains $5 Billion Transaction And Cardano Price Action To Watch\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum has maintained an average of $5 billion over a seven-day period for transactions of comparable size. The comparison highlights Cardano\u2019s recent surge in substantial transaction volume, showcasing a distinct trend in its favor.\n\nDespite this positive development, it\u2019s essential to note that, similar to several other altcoins, ADA has experienced a decline in price over the past few weeks. The token recorded a 5% decrease in the last 24 hours and a 15% dip in the past seven days.\n\nThis price movement suggests a nuanced scenario where Cardano demonstrates strength in on-chain activities, while market dynamics continue to impact its short-term valuation.\n\nCardano\u2019s unique standing in terms of significant transaction volume indicates a potential shift in investor behavior and network activity. As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, observing how Cardano sustains and builds upon this momentum will be crucial in understanding its role in the broader market.\n\nDisclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

        "content": "By leveraging NEAR DA, Polygon developers can enjoy substantial reductions in data availability costs, enhancing the overall efficiency of their rollups.\n\nThe collaboration between the NEAR Foundation and Polygon Labs marks an important milestone in Ethereum scaling. By integrating NEAR Data Availability (NEAR DA) with Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK), developers using Polygon CDK now have access to NEAR DA\u2019s efficient and highly scalable data availability layer.\n\nNEAR DA plays a crucial role in simplifying Ethereum rollup networks, reducing costs, and ensuring high scalability. It provides rollup builders with a reliable and efficient data availability solution, allowing them to focus on their core transaction logic. With Polygon CDK, developers can create customized Layer 2 chains using zero-knowledge (ZK) technology while maintaining compatibility with Ethereum.\n\nThe integration of NEAR DA with Polygon CDK brings significant benefits to rollup builders. Developers can enjoy substantial reductions in data availability costs, enhancing the overall efficiency of their rollups. It empowers developers using Polygon Chain Development Kit to adopt NEAR\u2019s solution as an important component in their modular data availability solutions.\n\nIllia Polosukhin, Co-Founder of NEAR Protocol expressing his thoughts about the collaboration said:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to make NEAR DA available to Polygon CDK rollup builders and share the benefits of cost-effective, lightning-fast data availability that scales with NEAR\u2019s sharding for the modular Ethereum ecosystem. This is another exciting collaboration between NEAR Foundation and Polygon Labs to drive Chain Abstraction and create better experiences for developers and users.\u201d\n\nThe comparison of calldata costs between NEAR DA and Ethereum Layer 1 also shows the significant advantages of utilizing NEAR\u2019s solution. When considering the price for 231 kB of calldata, NEAR proves to be a far more cost-effective option. This substantial difference in cost presents an exciting opportunity for developers to achieve substantial savings while maintaining the high level of security provided by the Ethereum network. The lower cost of calldata on NEAR enables developers to allocate their resources more efficiently, whether it be for building new applications or expanding existing ones.\n\nDriving Future Scaling with Open Collaboration\n\nMoreover, the integration opens up opportunities for developers to build their own rollups to become part of the Polygon ecosystem. This expands the range of options available for scalable data availability solutions.\n\nThe collaboration between NEAR and Polygon also builds upon their joint research efforts, focusing on the development of zkWASM technology. This technology enables interoperability between the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM) ecosystems, paving the way for enhanced scalability and multi-chain compatibility.\n\nFor teams interested in integrating NEAR DA into their projects, an opportunity awaits as they can now explore its numerous benefits and possibilities by making their proposals. This collaboration also signifies a significant step forward in the quest for Ethereum scaling and empowers developers to build innovative solutions with enhanced data availability, scalability, and at a reduced cost."

This steadiness is partly due to the excitement around the newly approved Bitcoin spot ETF, which has brought a fresh wave of investor interest, although Bitcoin\u2019s price has experienced only marginal changes.\n\nEthereum, another major player in the crypto space, mirrors this trend, with analysts closely watching its performance. Amidst this, Jamie Dimon\u2019s recent remarks labeling Bitcoin as having \u2018no value\u2019 have sparked debates and short-term uncertainty in the market.\n\n15 min TF$BTC consolidating above 42k support in a tight 42k-43k range, strong move coming soon \u2026. pic.twitter.com/P4UNOG7RK4 \u2014 Satoshi Flipper (@SatoshiFlipper) January 18, 2024\n\nYet, the broader sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, as the crypto community awaits the potential impact of the Federal Reserve\u2019s anticipated interest rate cut in March and the approaching Bitcoin halving in April 2024.\n\nThese events are expected to play a significant role in shaping Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s price predictions in the near term.\n\nJamie Dimon\u2019s Criticism Sparks Short-Term Uncertainty in Bitcoin Market\n\n\n\nJamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, recently stirred the Bitcoin market by comparing the cryptocurrency to a \u201cPet Rock\u201d during a CNBC interview. His critique has sparked some uncertainty in the crypto sphere, especially for newcomers.\n\nDimon acknowledged the promise of blockchain technology but differentiated it from Bitcoin, which he views more skeptically. While JPMorgan actively engages in tokenization with its JPM Coin, Dimon advises caution regarding Bitcoin, despite the bank\u2019s role in BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust.\n\n$JPM CEO Jamie Dimon still says he sees no value in $BTC, and doesn't want to talk about it. Here's a quote from Dimon today in an interview:\n\n\"Please stop talking about this $#!*\"\n\n\u201cI hope this is the last time I\u2019m talking about [Bitcoin], so help me god,\u201d \u2014 Market Rebellion (@MarketRebels) January 17, 2024\n\nDimon\u2019s skepticism extends to Bitcoin\u2019s intrinsic value and its potential links to illicit activities. He also expressed concern about a possible recession, pointing to factors like dwindling pandemic savings and geopolitical tensions. His comments have the potential to influence short-term market sentiment, possibly leading to fluctuations in Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nEthereum (ETH), another major cryptocurrency, isn\u2019t directly mentioned by Dimon, but its market often mirrors Bitcoin\u2019s trends. As a platform known for its practical applications in blockchain technology, Ethereum may be less affected by Dimon\u2019s specific criticisms of Bitcoin, but it\u2019s still subject to the broader market sentiments and economic factors impacting the crypto industry."

The approval marked a notable shift from the commission\u2019s once-rigid approach to the industry, stirring hopes for a similar move in the ongoing review for Ethereum ETFs.\n\nHowever, as the industry awaits a verdict, the commission has opted to extend the deadline on its decision, reverting to its traditional approach of delays.\n\nSEC Stalls Fidelity Ethereum ETF\n\nOn Thursday, January 18, the SEC filed to extend the evaluation period of asset management firm Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum ETF application.\n\nThe proposal, filed on November 17, 2023, proposed a new rule change that would allow the U.S. stock exchange Cboe BZX to list and trade shares of the Fidelity Ethereum Fund.\n\nCiting the necessity for a more comprehensive evaluation of the rule change and related concerns, the SEC extended the initial deadline by 45 days. The new date is set for March 5, 2024, by which the commission will unveil its decision to either approve or reject the proposal.\n\nFidelity Investments is not alone in pursuing an Ethereum ETF proposal, as BlackRock and Grayscale also await the commission\u2019s nod on their applications.\n\nIs the SEC Likely to Approve Ethereum ETFs?\n\nThe unpredictable nature of the Securities and Exchange Commission makes it challenging to predict a definitive outcome of the proposals.\n\nBloomberg analyst James Seyffart emphasized that a deadline extension is \u201ccompletely expected\u201d at this time.\n\nFidelity #ethereum ETF delayed just now. Completely expected. Dates that really matter are late May in my view. https://t.co/8mvhcPRaS7 \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 18, 2024\n\nThe nearest Ethereum ETF verdict deadline, slated for January 25, 2024, is for Grayscale\u2019s application. However, industry predictions suggest that approval in January remains improbable, and a May decision is a more plausible timeframe.\n\nRecent remarks from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, highlighting Ethereum\u2019s potential as a \u201cstore of value,\u201d have fueled speculation about a potential approval.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nBitcoin ETFs have experienced an impressive run since their launch, attracting over $10 billion in inflows .\n\nThe potential approval of Ethereum ETFs would signal an even more favorable regulatory stance from the SEC, building on the positive precedent set by the approval of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nInvesco, VanEck, and WisdomTree have also filed Ethereum ETF proposals with the SEC.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nWhile the Bitcoin ETF approval marks a positive shift in the SEC\u2019s approach to the industry, Chair Gensler was clear that this does not signal a pro-crypto stance. The commission remains cautious, and the extension of Fidelity Investments\u2019 Ethereum ETF deadline suggests efforts to align perspectives before making a final decision.\n\nRead more on foreign regulatory approaches to Bitcoin ETFs:\n\nBitcoin ETFs Banned in Singapore Over Eligibility Concerns\n\nSui teamed up with Stork to enhance DeFi solutions; find out more:\n\nSui Foundation Taps Stork to Boost DeFi Pricing Data"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) alternative currently priced at $0.07 is the perfect token to Invest in Before the Actual Bull Run\n\nIn the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, savvy investors are always on the lookout for promising alternatives to established tokens like Ethereum (ETH). As we inch closer to the next anticipated bull run, one such alternative garnering significant attention is Retik Finance, currently priced at an accessible $0.07. This article delves into why Retik Finance is an ideal investment opportunity before the actual bull run.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Legacy and the Search for Alternatives\n\n\n\nEthereum, often hailed as the pioneer of smart contract platforms, has played a pivotal role in shaping the cryptocurrency landscape. Its introduction of smart contracts revolutionized the way we perceive blockchain technology, extending its applications far beyond mere financial transactions. However, with the growing demand for Ethereum, issues such as high gas fees and network congestion have become more apparent, driving the search for viable alternatives.\n\nIntroducing Retik Finance: A New Era in DeFi\n\n\n\nRetik Finance emerges as a compelling Ethereum alternative, particularly in the realm of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Priced at just $0.07, Retik Finance stands out with its unique blend of features and potential for high returns. Here\u2019s why Retik Finance is an investment worth considering:\n\n1. Accessible Pricing and High Potential\n\nAt $0.07, Retik Finance is not just affordable but also carries a high growth potential. This pricing positions Retik as an attractive entry point for both seasoned and novice investors, offering the chance to be part of a growing DeFi platform.\n\n2. Innovative DeFi Solutions\n\nRetik Finance isn\u2019t just another token; it\u2019s a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem. The platform offers innovative solutions like DeFi debit cards, next-gen payment gateways, AI-powered P2P lending, and a highly secure multi-chain wallet. These features aim to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the crypto world, making DeFi more accessible and practical for everyday use.\n\n3. Scalability and Efficiency\n\nOne of the critical advantages of Retik Finance over Ethereum is its focus on scalability and efficiency. With advanced blockchain technology, Retik aims to offer faster transaction speeds and lower fees, addressing some of the primary concerns associated with Ethereum.\n\n4. Strong Security Measures\n\nRetik Finance places a high emphasis on security. With robust protocols and continuous system audits, investors can be assured of the safety of their assets. This commitment to security is crucial, especially in a landscape where vulnerabilities can lead to significant losses.\n\n5. Community-Centric Approach\n\nA key factor driving Retik Finance\u2019s growth is its community-centric approach. The platform actively engages with its user base, ensuring that the ecosystem evolves in line with user needs and market trends. This approach not only fosters a loyal community but also ensures the platform remains relevant and user-friendly.\n\n6. Potential for High Returns\n\nGiven its innovative offerings and strategic market position, Retik Finance holds the potential for high returns, especially as we approach the next bull run. Early investors in Retik could see significant gains as the platform expands and gains more recognition in the DeFi space.\n\nEthereum vs. Retik Finance: Diversification Strategy\n\n\n\nWhile Ethereum remains a cornerstone in the crypto world, diversifying with alternatives like Retik Finance could be a strategic move. As the market dynamics shift, tokens like Retik that offer practical solutions to current blockchain challenges could see substantial growth. Investing in Retik Finance could provide a balance to Ethereum\u2019s more established but possibly slower-growing nature.\n\nPreparing for the Bull Run: The Case for Retik Finance\n\n\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market anticipates the next bull run, timing and strategic investment choices become crucial. Retik Finance, with its current pricing and promising roadmap, offers a unique opportunity. Investors looking to capitalize on the early stages of a growing platform may find Retik an ideal choice, especially considering the potential saturation and maturation of older platforms like Ethereum.\n\nThe Road Ahead for Retik Finance\n\n\n\nRetik Finance\u2019s roadmap is dotted with milestones that aim to strengthen its position in the DeFi space. The focus on integrating real-world financial applications with the crypto universe sets it apart. With plans to enhance its AI-powered P2P lending and expand the utility of its DeFi debit cards, Retik is not just positioning itself as an alternative to Ethereum but as a pioneer in a new wave of DeFi solutions.\n\nNavigating Market Volatility\n\n\n\nIn the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, diversification remains key. While Ethereum has its strengths, its limitations in scalability and efficiency present opportunities for alternatives like Retik Finance. The lower entry price of Retik also means a potentially lower risk for investors looking to explore beyond the more established tokens.\n\nCommunity and Investor Confidence\n\n\n\nA strong community and investor confidence are vital in the crypto space. Retik Finance has been building a robust community, a factor that is often indicative of a project\u2019s long-term viability. The enthusiasm and support from its community not only drive the platform\u2019s development but also help in navigating the market\u2019s ups and downs.\n\nExpert Predictions and Market Trends\n\n\n\nSeveral crypto analysts and experts have turned their attention to emerging platforms like Retik Finance. With predictions of substantial growth and the potential for high ROI, Retik is quickly becoming a part of conversations about promising crypto investments for the future.\n\nConclusion: The Time for Retik Finance is Now\n\n\n\nAs the crypto market evolves, staying ahead of trends and diversifying investment portfolios is essential. Retik Finance, with its current pricing and innovative approach to DeFi, offers a compelling opportunity for those looking to maximize their returns in the next bull run. Its combination of accessibility, security, and a community-driven approach positions it as a strong contender in the world of DeFi, making it a token worth considering for any forward-thinking investor. In conclusion, while Ethereum continues to play a significant role in the cryptocurrency market, the emergence of Retik Finance represents the dawn of a new era in DeFi \u2013 one that balances innovation with practicality and security. For investors seeking to diversify and potentially capitalize on the early stages of a promising platform, Retik Finance at $0.07 could be the golden ticket as we gear up for the upcoming bull run.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance PresaleVisit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):\n\nWebsite: https://retik.com\n\nWhitepaper: https://retik.com/retik-whitepaper.pdf\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/retikfinance\n\nDisclaimer: The text above is a press release that is not part of Cryptonews.com editorial content."
