        "title": "How To Know Whether Ethereum Will Be Bullish In 2024? - Investing Haven",
        "content": "As an investor, it is important to differentiate bullish from bearish outcomes. Sometimes, this might require predicting an outcome (which tends to come with a forecast). However, sometimes it is really as simple as defining the \u2018line in the sand\u2019 in terms of price or time. If we apply this general principle to Ethereum, it is so simple to find the \u2018line in the sand\u2019 that it may seem so obvious that it escapes our attention. ETH will be bullish in 2024 as long as it respects 1550 USD on a 5-day closing basis, it\u2019s as simple as that.\n\nFrom time to time, we need to keep charting as simple and obvious as possible. Ethereum in 2023 and likely also in 2024 is a prime example of this guiding principle.\n\nThe chart of Ethereum, otherwise very volatile, became an easy read lately as ETH entered a trendless state.\n\nWe would pick 2070 USD as the \u2018breakout\u2019 level. This is easy to remember as it\u2019s the ATH price of gold. In Ethereum terms, it is the 50% retracement level of the decline that started in November of 2021, with a bottom set in June of 2022.\n\nWhen we carefully analyze the Ethereum price chart, we can find 2 more important price points, other than 2070 USD. On the one hand, we find the start of the mini-crash in November of 2022 (FTX implosion), it started when ETH was trading around 1600 USD (see yellow circle). The other important price point is the point in January of 2023 where ETH cleared its 10-month falling trendline (2nd yellow circle), around 1330 USD.\n\nThe lows set in 2022 was 1000 USD.\n\nWhile we can spend a lot of time predicting Ethereum\u2019s next price move, we can also keep it very simple: ETH bottomed at 1000 USD, it has an epic breakout level (resistance for now) at 2000 USD. The two levels that really matter, as outlined above (also visible on the chart, yellow circles) are 1330 and 1600, so that\u2019s 30% and 60% in the range 1000-2000.\n\nFor 2024, we will keep it very simple: as long as ETH can respect 1550-1600 USD, on a 5-day closing basis, it is trading in an area with a bullish bias, able to quickly move to 2070 USD to start a breakout attempt, on bullish momentum in the crypto market.\n\nBelow 1330 USD it will become very vulnerable unless 1230 USD holds. In that scenario, it might be that ETH will be working a long term bullish reversal in the form of a double bottom.\n\nNeedless to say, below 1000 USD, in 2024 or beyond, it will be bearish for Ethereum.\n\nWe believe that ETH will respect 1330 USD in 2024. We also believe that ETH qualifies as a lower risk play in a high risk crypto market. In our premium crypto service, we identified a few bullish setups that might provide leverage whenever bullish momentum returns in the crypto market, as outlined in 3 Top Cryptocurrencies For November 2023.\n\nReceive our crypto FREE newsletter alerts Download 50 crypto investing tips"

        "title": "Explore The Possible Earnings That Can Be Obtained From Ethereum and BTCS - CoinCodex",
        "content": "With the current state of the crypto market, it is essential to explore the possible earnings that can be obtained from Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin Spark (BTCS).\n\nEthereum price prediction\n\nWhile there have been many projections of Ethereum's future price movements, the one recently put forth by Standard Chartered has elicited considerable excitement among crypto enthusiasts. According to the global banking giant, Ethereum (ETH) has the potential to surge to $8,000 within the next two years. This bullish outlook is rooted in Ethereum's expanding role in smart contracts, gaming, and the tokenization of traditional assets. Geoff Kendrick, the Head of FX Research at Standard Chartered, further projected a structural valuation ranging from $26,000 to $35,000 by 2040, supported by the growing real-world applications in Ethereum's blockchain. These predictions underscore Ethereum's potential to yield substantial earnings for investors who capitalize on its current price, which is around 68.40% below its all-time (ATH) of $ 4,891.70.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Spark (BTCS)?\n\nBitcoin Spark is a new blockchain that was inspired by Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s vision. It seeks to address the limitations of previous blockchain platforms and introduce a new era of digital transactions.\n\nThe Bitcoin Spark blockchain ensures quick transaction processing and low transaction costs through its short block time, high individual transaction capabilities per block, and massive number of nodes. The blockchain also has multiple layers, including a smart contract layer with multiple execution systems that attain singular network finality, allowing for a variety of high-level and low-level programming languages. This positions it as a robust platform capable of supporting smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) catering to diverse use cases.\n\nBitcoin Spark has especially received recognition for its groundbreaking consensus mechanism, the Proof-of-Process (PoP), which is an effective hybrid of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems. Users are required to stake BTCS tokens and provide processing power to the network in order to confirm blocks and earn rewards. However, the PoP exponentially reduces rewards as additional stake and processing power are added. This nonlinear approach, combined with the network\u2019s massive nodes, ensures a more equitable distribution of rewards and allows for broader participation, promoting true decentralization. Notably, the Bitcoin Spark network will have a native application developed by its team, compatible with a wide range of operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS, iOS, and Android. The application will serve as a wallet and as the network validation application, enabling accessible and seamless participation.\n\nInterestingly, Bitcoin Spark will channel the contributed computing power to institutions and individuals seeking remote computing resources, who then pay for the service in BTCS, the network's native cryptocurrency. Network validators will receive newly minted BTCS and transaction fees from confirmed blocks plus 97% of the revenue generated from what would have otherwise been dormant processing power.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin Spark will have advertising spaces on its application and website, with a strong emphasis on community policing to uphold decentralization. Advertisers pay in BTCS, and 50% of the revenue, along with incentives for monitoring the ads, is allocated to network participants.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin Spark is currently in Phase 8 of 10 in its Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with BTCS selling at $3.25 and investors getting a 6% bonus, among other benefits.\n\nBitcoin Spark (BTCS) future\n\nBitcoin Spark is set to officially launch on the market on 30th November, with BTCS at $10. This denotes a 326% increase for investors in Phase 8 and an 800% for those who invested in the first phase. Many analyses, including a recent one by Oscar Ramos, suggest that Bitcoin Spark has a great future ahead. As Bitcoin-inspired crypto, there\u2019s a limited supply of 21 million BTCS coins, which shows potential for long-term value increases. Additionally, Bitcoin Spark has innovative technologies, unique real-world uses, and a community-centered approach, which is bound to attract many users, increasing demand and subsequently its price. Moreover, Bitcoin Spark\u2019s low market cap, coupled with its launch being close to the predicted 2024 bull run, suggests potential for massive price rallies for BTCS.\n\nThe bottom line:\n\nWhile Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin Spark (BTCS) have significant potential to provide massive profits, it\u2019s essential to do your own research before investing.\n\nTo get more information on Bitcoin Spark and its ICO:\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article.

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price created a multi-month ascending triangle pattern that breached the downside.\n\nETH is currently retesting the $1,639 resistance level that has been pivotal for the past year.\n\nThe theoretical forecasting method hints at a 45% crash for ETH after the bearish breakout.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price breached its multi-month consolidation, favoring the bears. This breakout has caused panic among investors, and if the outlook does not improve for ETH, more downside is likely. While the weekend price action has given bulls some hope, ETH needs to overcome two key resistance levels before investors can breath a sigh of relief.\n\nRead more: Ether crosses $1.6K, Bitcoin SV leads Altcoin gains with 30% bump\n\nEthereum price at crossroads\n\nEthereum (ETH) price set up four higher lows and three equal highs since May 2022. Connecting key swing points using trend lines reveals an ascending triangle pattern. This technical formation is bullish, and a decisive breakout forecasts an uptrend equal to the distance between the first swing high and swing low.\n\nBut for Ethereum price, the breakout was bearish, which forecasts a 45% crash to $998. This target is obtained by adding the distance between the first swing high and swing low to the breakout point at $1,825.\n\nIn its descent, Ethereum price has already breached the $1,639 support level, which has been key for the past year. If buyers fail to overcome this hurdle, it is likely ETH will continue its southbound move and eventually tag the $1,000 psychological level. From the current position of $1,598, this descent would constitute a 38% crash.\n\nAlso read: Solana vs. Ethereum: Renewed debate erupts over efficiency, development and scalability\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum price has produced three distinctive higher lows over the past month, which are not confirmed by the Relative Strength Index (RSI). This non-conformity is termed as bullish divergence and often leads to a small rally to the upside.\n\nDue to the aforementioned bullish signal, if Ethereum price manages to flip the $1,639 hurdle into a support floor on the daily or three-day time frame, it could provide bulls a respite. This move could likely attract more sidelined buyers and potentially trigger a minor rally to retest the next key resistance levels at $1,767 and $2,000."

This prevents validators from spamming the network with invalid messages that exceed six blobs per block.\n\nPrysm, an Ethereum client, announced the release of its v4.1.0 version earlier this week. Although capabilities such as backward syncing and filesystem-based blob storage are planned for Q4, 2024, this release sets the groundwork for Deneb support.\n\nThis release also includes new features such as decreasing memory with multi-value slices, optimizing block processing with EIP-4881, boosting portable build performance with BLST0.3.11 and providing live previews of multiarch containers."

        "content": "An Ethereum ICO participant re-emerged after 8.2 years of inactivity, transferring 2,000 ETH ($3.2 million) to four different addresses on October 21, 2023. Acquired at a mere $620 at the Ethereum Genesis, this move not only underscores Ethereum's substantial price appreciation but also hints at potential market dynamics as long-dormant assets re-enter circulation. The transaction could signal various intents, from cashing out to redistributing or reinvesting the holdings, each with its own set of implications for the Ethereum market.\n\nA participant of the initial coin offering (ICO) for Ethereum has emerged from an 8.2-year hiatus, transferring their entire stash of 2,000 ETH, valued at $3.2 million, to four distinct addresses. This event occurred on October 21, 2023, as reported by Lookonchain via Twitter. The transaction showcases not only the price appreciation of Ethereum but also the potential market dynamics induced by long-term dormant cryptocurrency holdings transitioning to active status.\n\nThe participant acquired these 2,000 ETH during Ethereum's genesis phase at an approximate total cost of $620, given the ICO price of approximately $0.31 per ETH. The tweet included a link to the Etherscan page showing the transactions from the address 0x6403d062549690c8e8b63eae41d6c109476e2588. The remarkable price appreciation highlights the enormous potential for early adopters in the cryptocurrency space, with the value of the assets skyrocketing from about $620 to $3.2 million over a span of 8.2 years.\n\nMarket Implications\n\nThe reactivation and transfer of assets from long-dormant cryptocurrency wallets to exchanges can evoke various reactions within the market and the cryptocurrency community. These transactions are often closely monitored and speculated upon, generating discussions and narratives that may impact market sentiment and price dynamics in the short term. Cryptocurrency exchanges may see an influx of ETH, which could potentially affect the asset's price depending on the subsequent actions taken by the ICO participant\n\nLarge transfers from dormant addresses are sometimes perceived by the market as a prelude to selling, which could potentially put downward pressure on the price of the cryptocurrency involved. This concern may escalate especially in cases where a substantial amount of cryptocurrency is moved, potentially affecting market liquidity, more so if the cryptocurrency has a relatively smaller market cap.\n\nBeyond the immediate market reactions, the reactivation of long-dormant wallets carries sentimental or symbolic significance. It highlights the patience and long-term vision of early adopters, reflecting the historical narrative of the cryptocurrency in question. Such events showcase real-world examples of significant asset appreciation over time, underscoring the potential rewards for long-term holders in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

On Saturday, the ETH tokens in question changed wallets for the first time.\n\nAn #Ethereum #ICO participant woke up after 8.2 years of dormancy and transferred all 2,000 $ETH($3.2M currently) to 4 addresses 10 mins ago. He/she received 2,000 $ETH(the cost is ~$620) at Ethereum Genesis, and the ETH ICO price is ~$0.31.https://t.co/zyMsEZIlb3 pic.twitter.com/juvlKCnIsW \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 21, 2023\n\nThe wallet holding the pre-mined stash of ETH had been dormant for exactly 8.2 years (July 2015). Thanks to the exponential growth of Ethereum and the entire crypto market, the value of these holdings has grown to nearly $3.2 million at the current price.\n\nIn the X (formerly Twitter) post, Lookonchain highlighted that the ICO participant transferred the Ethereum tokens to four different addresses. About 500 Ether tokens were sent to each address, with minutes separating the transactions.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the wallet owner is preparing to sell the tokens, stake on the network, or carry out other transactions. In the event of a sell-off, though, the price of ETH may experience momentary downward pressure.\n\nLarge transfers from early ICO participants are not exactly common occurrences, but there have already been a couple of similar transactions in 2023. Notably, an ICO participant moved $116 million worth of pre-mined ETH to a Kraken exchange address in July.\n\nETH Price Overview\n\nAs of this writing, Ethereum\u2019s price stands at $1,605, reflecting a 0.7% decline in the past day. This comes on the back of a week where the value of ETH showed signs of recovery, registering a 3.8% price increase in the past seven days.\n\nThe past week was dominated mainly by the optimistic performance of Bitcoin and the false news of a spot ETF approval. This positive run of BTC, however, eventually rubbed on the broader cryptocurrency market, including the price of Ethereum.\n\nEthereum price hovers around the $1,600 mark on the daily timeframe | Source: ETHUSDT chart on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from The Economic Times, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "A venture capitalist who called the bottom of the crypto bear market last year says that one of Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) biggest rivals is the best contrarian altcoin play for the next bull run.\n\nCrypto investor Chris Burniske says that Solana (SOL) is the best \u201cnon-consensus\u201d opportunity for an upcoming market expansion in the digital asset space.\n\nBurniske, the former head of crypto at Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest, says that SOL\u2019s non-consensus status today is similar to ETH\u2019s in the bear market of 2018.\n\n\u201cETH was non-consensus in 2018/2019, but is now consensus and anyone worth their salt as a crypto investor is there \u2013 quality asset.\n\nBut SOL is the strongest non-consensus asset of this bear. Watch out for when it becomes a consensus long, lots of momo investors will be scrambling.\u201d\n\nLooking at Solana versus Ethereum (SOL/ETH), the investor says the pair looks like it may have enough steam to finally overcome the level that it lost during the collapse of the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX.

        "content": "The Ethereum (ETH) price shows a newfound recovery after bouncing off the $1,530 support level on October 14. This bullish reversal represents a 6.6% increase within two weeks, bringing the coin\u2019s current trading price to $1,628. A closer look at the daily time frame suggests that this upswing could be part of a bullish reversal pattern known as a Double Bottom.\n\nAlso Read: Elevated US Treasury Yield Is Hurting Ethereum More Than Bitcoin, Here\u2019s Why\n\nadvertisement\n\nBullish Pattern Hints Upcoming Recovery\n\nThe formation of a double-bottom pattern set the ETH price for a significant rally ahead\n\nMultiple support at $1500 indicates a high accumulation zone for traders\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $6.6 Billion, indicating a 34% gain.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nOver the past two months, the Ethereum price has been caught in a consolidation range between $1,745 and $1,535. While the short-term trend indicates sideways movement, these specific levels are significant as they contribute to the formation of a double-bottom pattern. Historically, such patterns occurring at key technical supports have often led to significant upswings.\n\nAs of press time, the ETH price is trading at $1,630 and faces resistance at the $1,650 level, as evidenced by a high-wick rejection candle on the daily chart. A daily candle close above this minor resistance could propel the ongoing recovery by another 5.2%, challenging the pattern\u2019s neckline at $1,745.\n\nBreaking above this crucial resistance would provide more reliable confirmation of a sustained recovery, potentially pushing the price up to the $2,000 mark, a gain of approximately 14.5%.\n\nWill ETH Price Hold $1500 Support?\n\nWhile the near-term outlook for the ETH price appears bullish, it\u2019s important to note that the existing corrective trend remains in place until the price breaks above the last swing high of $1,745. Should the ongoing rally face supply pressure at this neckline resistance, the prices could experience another rejection, leading to a continuation of the sideways trend. However, a long-coming support trendline currently hovers around the $1,500 mark and offers coin holders a safety net against major corrections.\n\nExponential Moving Average: The 50-day EMA slope moving around $1650 offers an additional resistance level against buyers.\n\nRelative Strength Index: The daily RSI slope above 50% reflects a suitable momentum to carry price recovery."

        "title": "Why Will Solana Outperform Ethereum and Polygon? - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "If FTX owns a ton of your tokens, then your project MUST be in trouble right? Or your project is a piece of trash, right? WRONG. FTX holds a big stake in Solana. And even with all the potential sale pressure on those 57 million tokens, Solana\u2019s price isn\u2019t tanking.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s UP 17% just in the last 3 months. By the way, if you are a concerned holder, the average token unlock for these is near the end of 2025, according to Messari. So, this is just one more piece of evidence that we think the worst is over for Solana. It has the potential to grow more than ETH and many other projects in the next year. Come find out why!\n\nWhy SOL Will Outperform ETH?\n\nAs many of you know by now, SOL is a VC chain. There\u2019s A LOT of money behind it. We have mixed feelings about VC chains. They are in no way decentralized.\n\nBut that does not mean they aren\u2019t useful. For one thing, you can do lots of transactions fast and cheap there. That\u2019s good on many levels esp when trying to increase adoption for crypto around the world. So specifically, why will it outperform Ethereum?\n\nNFT Growth\n\nIf you believe in the future of NFTs, whether it\u2019s collections, games, or tokenizing assets, then you should be looking at Solana. The amount of ETH used to pay for NFT sales has dropped down to 2021 levels. Not only is the market for NFTs not growing on Ethereum. It\u2019s shrinking.\n\nYou NFT lovers know that for most of this bear market, it\u2019s been the same pool of NFT buyers and sellers selling to each other. Now that pool is even smaller. But not so on Solana.\n\nHere the market is growing fast. In Q3, Messari reports that Solana minted 45 million NFTs. That\u2019s a 316% increase from Q2. And while most of the mints are free collections, it\u2019s still significant.\n\nBig ETH NFT projects could add a free mint or a side project if they wanted. But they aren\u2019t. Because there\u2019s no interest there. Solana\u2019s NFT community is growing while Ethereum\u2019s is shrinking. Plain and simple.\n\nWhich one do you think will be stronger in a bull market? The one that\u2019s growing during a bear market? Or one that\u2019s shrinking?\n\nDeFi TVL Growing\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just NFTs. DeFi TVL is growing on Solana too. All while TVL is shrinking on Ethereum. In the last 90 days, SOL\u2019s TVL is up 32% to $368 million. That puts them 8th of all chains. Ethereum is still the undisputed leader.\n\nBut ETH\u2019s TVL is shrinking. In the last 30 days, as you can see in this DeFiLLama chart, Ethereum\u2019s TVL is down 10.31%. That\u2019s almost $2 billion dollars. And you can\u2019t put all that on a drop in ETH\u2019s price. ETH\u2019s price is down only 1.7% in the same 30 days.\n\nHow did @solana perform Q3'23? Solana tech is continuing to gain mindshare, with market cap growing 17% QoQ and revenue for SOL up 10% QoQ. DeFi TVL also grew 32% QoQ to $368M, thanks to protocols like @marginfi, @cypher_protocol, and @solendprotocol. pic.twitter.com/UN6ywL8NiK \u2014 Messari (@MessariCrypto) October 18, 2023\n\nAnd Solana, DeFiLLama tells us their TVL is up 6.12% in the last 30 days. This last month is a positive contributor to the overall 32% growth in the last quarter. Marinade, Jito, and SoLend are benefitting the most but every DeFi platform on Solana is up in recent weeks. The entire ecosystem is growing.\n\nSuper Low Transaction Costs\n\nBack to the Messari report again. For Q3, the average transaction cost on Solana is $0.0002. That\u2019s 2/100ths of a cent. There\u2019s no lower transaction cost anywhere in crypto.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to think if you are in the US, Canada, or Western Europe that things like transaction costs don\u2019t matter. Especially if one L1 is 3 cents while another is 15 cents. Both are much cheaper than bank wire fees so we\u2019d take either one.\n\nBut what\u2019s the biggest potential market for crypto in the world now? India. And where is crypto growing the fastest? Sub-Saharan Africa. In these regions, due to their weak currencies, even paying 10 cents for a transaction could be expensive for them based on income and currency value.\n\nBut everyone can afford 2/100ths of a cent. This is why low transaction costs are so key to increasing global adoption.\n\nAnd low transaction costs are something Ethereum will never, ever have.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Central Bank Mentality\n\nYes, I\u2019m serious here. Have you noticed that the rules that govern Ethereum keep changing? And not in a community adoption of new proposals way like you see on Cosmos.\n\nMore like Federal Reserve central bankers. Vitalik, Joseph Lubin, the Ethereum Foundation. Consensys, and those who got the 70% premine of Ethereum keep changing the rules in ways that benefit them. And not just the move to Proof of Stake, either.\n\nAnd people are starting to notice. If you were in the early ETH club, then congratulations. But for the rest of us, they don\u2019t care at all what you think. They just change the rules so they benefit more while doing nothing to make transacting easier, faster, or cheaper. Even some crypto influencers like DU09BTC, who is not a Bitcoin maxi, agree.\n\nI've been following Ethereum closely. Vitalik and the early insiders continue to change the rules and modify the code. Now some are threatening to abandon the project altogether in the face of government intervention. I'm not waiting any longer. Today, I am selling all my ETH. \u2014 Duo Nine \u26a1 YCC (@DU09BTC) October 19, 2023\n\nThose sound like some bankers we already know. Solana has its faults, especially with its heavy VC ownership. But it\u2019s not doing this and it seems to care more about its community.\n\nWhy SOL Will Outperform MATIC\n\nNow Polygon is a different story. While it has its own chain, most of its work is in Layer 2 solutions. That means faster, cheaper, and more scalable transactions. Here they are more competitive with Solana than Ethereum is.\n\nDeFi\n\nPolygon\u2019s DeFi has grown recently too. But not as fast as Solana\u2019s. And in the last month, like Ethereum, Polygon\u2019s TVL is down 15% while Solana\u2019s is up 6%.\n\nTransaction Fees\n\nFees on the Polygon network can go as low as 5/100ths of a cent up to as high as 20-ish cents. And that\u2019s both reasonable and fair. Especially since the base fee on Polygon is burned and validators only earn the gas portion of the fee. But that\u2019s still higher than Solana.\n\nIn 2 emerging markets for crypto like Cameroon and Colombia, the average monthly salary is under $300. FOR THE MONTH. So, even if inflation is low, the difference between a 10c transaction fee and 2/100ths of a cent is a big deal.\n\nWe love Polygon as you know. But right now, Solana is in a position to outperform it in the next bull market.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information discussed by Altcoin Buzz is not financial advice.

Over the past week, the coin has made two unsuccessful attempts to breach the $1,600 mark, indicating strong overhead supply pressure. If this resistance endures, the coin price might remain in a consolidation phase above the $1,500 support level.\n\nAlso Read: Elevated US Treasury Yield Is Hurting Ethereum More Than Bitcoin, Here\u2019s Why\n\nadvertisement\n\nEmerging Pattern Hints a Rally to $1745\n\nEthereum Fear and index at 48% reflect a neutral sentiment in the market\n\nA bullish breakout from $1745 could set a direction trend in the ETH price\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $6.6 Billion, indicating a 34% gain.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nIn today\u2019s trading, the Ethereum price posted an intraday gain of 2.68%, exhibiting a bullish morning Star candle pattern that originated from the $1,530 support. Such a pattern at a crucial support level often signals an imminent bullish reversal.\n\nHowever, the candle formation today shows a high wick, suggesting the presence of sellers around the $1,600 level. If this supply pressure persists, the ETH price could continue its consolidation, potentially revisiting the $1,530 level to regain bullish momentum.\n\nAs of now, the second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum trades at $1,609. For a more confident recovery to be confirmed, it needs to surpass its October 16th high of $1,556. Achieving this could position Ethereum for a quick 5% rally to $1,572 and complete a bullish Double Bottom reversal pattern.\n\nIs ETH Price Ready for Recovery?\n\nIn the broader context, the ETH price has been traveling in a sideways trend oscillating between $1,745 and $1,530 horizontal level. Amid this consolidation, the daily chart shows the forming of what appears to be a double-bottom pattern, a bullish reversal indicator. Should this pattern play out, the Ethereum price has the potential to break out of its current consolidation range, aiming for a breach above the $1,745 mark, thereby heralding a new recovery trend.\n\nSuper Trend: A red film projected in the daily indicates the sellers pose an upper hand\n\nRelative Strength Index: Contrary to sideways action, the daily RSI slope showing an evident rise indicates the increasing bullish momentum at bottom support."

This technical formation forecasts handsome games for patient ETC holders as the altcoin prepares before an explosive move to the upside,\n\nAlso read: Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH needs to hold these key levels to revisit $2,000\n\nEthereum Classic price prepares for volatility\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) price has created a multi-month descending triangle setup. In particular, ETF has bounced off the $14.70 support level five times since December 2022. The last four bounces, aka swing lows, were followed by a string of lower highs. Connecting these swing points using trend lines reveals a descending triangle setup. This technical formation has a bearish bias but investors cannot ignore the possibility of an upward breakout since this rangebound movement is happening after a long duration of downtrend.\n\nOn October 23, Ethereum Classic price breached the descending triangle's hypotenuse by producing a daily candlestick close above it. This pattern forecasts a 30% upswing to $20.59, which is obtained by measuring the distance between the first swing high and the swing low to the breakout point of $15.90.\n\nConsidering the Relative Strength Index\u2019s (RSI) position above the 50 level on the daily timeframe, the chances of the ongoing rally's continuation are high. With these points in mind Ethereum Classic price needs to overcome the $17.15 and $19.99 hurdles to reach the theoretical target of $20.59. From its current position of $16.53, this move would constitute a near 2 5%-gain.\n\nRead more: Ethereum classic is looking for more gains\n\nETC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nWhile the bullish outlook makes logical sense, investors need to note that this weekend rally could come undone at the start of a fresh week. In such a case, if the Ethereum Classic price produces a daily candlestick close below the $14.70 support floor, it will confirm a bearish breakout. In such a case, the measurement rule forecast a 30% correction to $10.36. But the descend might face exhaustion around $10.72, which is the three-day support last seen in February 2021."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAn Ethereum whale who holds a massive amount of ETH was faced with significant losses after making error moves, according to Lookonchain. The ETH whale was said to have accumulated 4,892 ETH worth $13.84 million at nearly $2,830 in the year 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the whale decided to sell after months of hodling, thinking to stop more losses. Thus, the whale lost over $5.24 million after depositing 4,274 ETH worth over $6.85 million to Binance some hours ago. Depositing assets on an exchange usually indicates a desire to sell.\n\nA \"Stupid Money\" deposited 4,274 $ETH($6.85M) to #Binance 7 hrs ago to stop more losses, losing ~$5.24M.\n\n\n\nHe/she accumulated 4,892 $ETH($13.84M) at ~$2,830 in 2022.\n\n\n\nDuring stETH/ETH decoupling, he/she panicked and swapped 3,705 $stETH for 3,536 $ETH, with a loss of 169 $ETH. pic.twitter.com/uzsyH74ip5 \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 21, 2023\n\nThe whale's timing to sell coincided with a sharp spike in the ETH price in the last 24 hours, so it turned out to be wrong overall. The whale would have been able to minimize the losses by benefiting from the price increase.\n\nEthereum saw a sharp spike on Oct. 20 from a low of $1,582 to a high of $1,632. ETH sustained the rise and remained in green at press time to trade at $1,606.\n\nThe whale had been bearish on ETH, given the profit-taking earlier in the week after approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF was confirmed to be false. The whale had anticipated the profit-taking to continue and hence was caught unawares by the sudden recovery in price.\n\nBarring the 24-hour price increase, the whale panicked and ended up selling his ETH holding at a lower price than when he bought it, resulting in a loss.\n\nThe aforementioned ETH holder also made other mistakes that resulted in losses. According to Lookonchain, the ETH whale panicked and exchanged 3,705 stETH for 3,536 ETH, resulting in a loss of 169 ETH.\n\nDormant ETH tokens have shifted in the last 24 hours. According to a PeckShield alert, a dormant ETH ICO participant who had been inactive for eight years moved over 2,000 ETH out.\n\nIn progress updates as regards Ethereum ETF, Invesco US and Galaxy have now filed their 19b-4 via CBOE for their spot Ethereum ETF. According to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, the final deadline is undetermined, although it is expected to be around the first week of July."

        "content": "By staking Ethereum (ETH), investors have yet another potential income stream to consider in the rapidly expanding cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nAs the leading Proof of Stake crypto, the Ethereum Network has the highest staking market capitalization in the whole space. Accruing for a total of $44.56 billion in ETH locked by validators, by press time.\n\nThe creation of new tokens (block subsidy) and transaction fees reward investors when they stake their tokens to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Similar to what happens with Bitcoin (BTC) mining. Nevertheless, the supply inflation resulting from these rewards can also impact the real reward rate for Ethereum investors.\n\nThis happens because the increased circulating supply also dilutes the ETH holder\u2018s true value. Finbold demonstrated this dilution in a previous report analyzing the price Ethereum would trade at if it hits its all-time high market cap.\n\nEthereum staking reward rate vs. real reward rate\n\nIn this context, Finbold retrieved data from StakingRewards.com to discover how much Ethereum staking investors are being really rewarded after locking up their capital with ETH. By looking at the raw numbers, the network has paid $1.55 billion dollars year-over-year.\n\nNotably, despite having an estimated annual reward rate of 3.47%, the real reward rate (adjusted by Ethereum\u2019s supply inflation) is 3% per year. This means that a staking position of 32 ETH ($51,200) would reward a validator around $1,536 yearly.\n\nStaking Ethereum data. Source: StakingRewards.com\n\nNevertheless, it is also important to say that staking Ethereum gives investors one of the closest real reward rates to the annualized expected reward rate among other staked cryptocurrencies.\n\nAt the time of publication, there were a total of 863,550 validators staking 27.73 million ETH. However, the staked tokens dropped 65.59% in the last 24 hours."

Meanwhile, a score above 50 points toward greed. Over the past month, the index has hovered largely in the neutral zone.\n\nFor instance, on Oct. 12, the index registered a reading of 41, with Ethereum priced at $1,566.\n\nBy Oct. 11, the index fluctuated slightly but remained neutral, ranging from 42 to 45. During that period, Ethereum's price had been oscillating between $1,566 and $1,576.\n\nThe recent shift to 55 suggests a growing bullish sentiment among investors.\n\nCloser look at Ethereum's price movement\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $1,628, a marginal increase of 1.4%, according to CoinGecko data. The cryptocurrency has been trading between $1,603 and $1,646 in the last 24 hours.\n\nEthereum's market capitalization stands robust at approximately $196.4 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of roughly $8.7 billion.\n\nHowever, investors should exercise caution.

        "content": "Ethereum lagged behind Bitcoin\u2019s recent rally as interest in altcoins surged\n\nRecent Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) and active developer discussions have tried to enhance Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem\n\nWhile Bitcoin approached the $30,000-level, many other cryptocurrencies saw a corresponding surge in interest. And yet, Ethereum [ETH], often seen as a digital silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold, saw relatively subdued growth over this period.\n\nNevertheless, Ethereum\u2019s performance, or lack thereof in terms of price movement, didn\u2019t reflect the ongoing developments within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nNew proposals\n\nOne noteworthy development is the latest Ethereum Improvement Proposal, commonly known as EIP, which aims to introduce asynchronous deposit and redemption flows. This proposal serves as an extension to the existing ERC-4626 tokenized vault standard. The ERC-4626 standard focuses on creating parameters for yield-bearing vaults, which are smart contract platforms executing strategies, providing rewards to token depositors.\n\nEIP-7540, in particular, focuses on enabling asynchronous deposits and redemption flows, significantly improving processes for protocols dealing with real-world assets (RWAs), cross-chain lending, and liquid staking. In fact, this potential enhancement was highlighted in an interview with Asad Khan, a DeFi expert at Centrifuge.\n\nKhan explained that EIP-7540 allows for more seamless interactions between users who deposit assets and the tokens they receive in return, creating a more user-friendly experience. This is especially relevant in areas such as RWAs, where different real-world assets can be tokenized and managed more efficiently.\n\nDevelopments on the network continue to hike\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s developer community has remained highly active, demonstrating its commitment to the network\u2019s evolution. During their 120th meeting on October 19, 2023, Ethereum developers discussed vital updates, including changes to Ethereum\u2019s core consensus layer (CL). This illustrates the continuous efforts to refine Ethereum\u2019s core functionality, ensuring its reliability and performance.\n\nOne specific issue addressed in this meeting pertained to data blob synchronization. Data blob synchronization involves efficiently propagating blocks of information across the Ethereum network. This synchronization is crucial for ensuring all participants have consistent access to the same data. Developers at the meeting scrutinized the impact of data blob synchronization on block latency.\n\nFor context, Block latency in Ethereum refers to the time it takes a new block of transactions to be received and processed by nodes in the network. Lower block latency is desirable as it improves the efficiency and responsiveness of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nAs Ethereum undergoes these developments and enhancements, questions remain about the potential impact on the price of ETH. At press time, it was trading at $1,609. Ethereum\u2019s price can be influenced by both these technical developments and wider market sentiment.\n\nAt the same time, network growth showed signs of decline, suggesting that Ethereum may need to rekindle interest among new users to continue growing in the future."

        "title": "ChatGPT Predicts Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Chainlink (LINK) Prices For End of October: The End of ... - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The crypto world is on edge, with a decisive court mandate this Friday potentially altering the Bitcoin ETF saga. This development, central to Grayscale Investments LLC\u2019s fight with the SEC, could ripple across the sector, impacting established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Chainlink (LINK), while paving the way for emerging projects like ScapesMania. The situation is unprecedented, leaving market analysts and major players, anticipating the SEC\u2019s next move in an unclear approval process. Recent market upheaval from false news underscores the high stakes and sensitivity, with Bitcoin\u2019s current stance at $28,200 indicating the market\u2019s cautious watchfulness. Amidst this, ScapesMania\u2019s innovative approach is gaining attention, suggesting a new era in the crypto domain. This climate sets a tense backdrop for major cryptocurrencies, each awaiting outcomes that could pivot their market journeys.\n\nWe asked ChatGPT to assess market noise and indicators in order to forecastEthereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Chainlink (LINK) price changes until the end of the month. Let\u2019s check the outcome!\n\nScapesMania: x500% ROI is Likely\n\nMany crypto experts pick ScapesMania as the best new project of 2023 and beyond. It manages to separate itself from the competition by offering holders a multitude of revenue streams and high potential ROIs during presale.\n\nCompanies and individual crypto traders looking for fast potential gains should definitely look into ScapesMania\u2019s proposition. Once the presale finishes, the price will soar, securing possible returns in the range of 400-500%. Right now, there\u2019s an active discount of close to 85%, but it won\u2019t last forever \u2013 the clock is ticking and all interested in leveraging this offer need to act fast.\n\nWhen dissecting the tokenomics and other features of ScapesMania, it becomes clear that it\u2019s the best altcoin to hold now. The innovative gaming-related core idea, impressive presale numbers, $150,000 giveaway, undying social media hype, and other positive aspects can guarantee that ScapesMania will continue on its winning journey, so it makes sense to get involved as soon as possible.\n\n>>> Join Presale at a Discount on the Official Site <<<\n\nEthereum (ETH): ChatGPT Price Prediction\n\nEthereum (ETH) recent innovation, restaking, proposed by middleware protocol EigenLayer, has stirred a debate in the crypto community. According to Chat GPT\u2019s analysis, restaking allows the reuse of staked or locked-up Ether tokens to earn fees and rewards, which can then be used to secure and validate other protocols. While some see it as a way to extract additional security and rewards from already staked Ethereum (ETH), others, including Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin, view it as a potentially unstable foundation that could have adverse effects on the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum (ETH) price oscillates between $1,570 and $1,732. The 10-Days Moving Average is at $1,565, hinting at a stable trend, while the 100-Days Moving Average is slightly above at $1,710. With insights from Chat GPT, with support levels identified at $1,308 and $1,470, Ethereum (ETH) has a solid foundation in the market. Conversely, resistance levels at $1,794 and $1,955 could pose challenges for upward movement.\n\nThe restaking debate, as highlighted by Chat GPT, adds a layer of complexity to Ethereum (ETH) future. Proponents argue that it can expand Ethereum (ETH) capabilities, allowing it to secure other bridges and oracles. However, concerns about computational overloads and the potential for nefarious actors to exploit the system have been raised. The consensus is that while restaking offers potential benefits, it also comes with risks that need to be carefully managed. As the debate unfolds, Ethereum (ETH) trajectory will be influenced by the outcomes of this innovation.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Analysis\n\nMarket cap Price 2022 change Price 2021 change Price 2020 change Price 2019 change Ethereum (ETH) $190.62 B -67.49% 399.75% 469.58% -2.04%\n\nLitecoin (LTC): ChatGPT Price Prediction\n\nLitecoin (LTC), once hailed as the digital silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold, has recently achieved a significant milestone by processing its 180 millionth transaction. This achievement, as highlighted by Chat GPT, is even more remarkable considering that in 2023 alone, the platform recorded over 51 million transactions, outpacing the previous year\u2019s total of 39 million. However, while these numbers paint a picture of a thriving network, the underlying asset, Litecoin (LTC), has been grappling with challenges to maintain its stature in the ever-competitive crypto landscape.\n\nCurrently, Litecoin (LTC) price hovers between $59.66 and $70.33. The 10-Days Moving Average, standing at $61.73, suggests short-term stability, while the 100-Days Moving Average at $72.59 indicates a potential for upward momentum in the longer run. However, as pointed out by Chat GPT, the asset has witnessed a concerning decline of approximately 45% since July, plummeting from a notable $114 to its present value around $63. This decline is in stark contrast to its once-celebrated all-time high of $413.\n\nSuch fluctuations in fee revenue, coupled with the asset\u2019s declining value, suggest changing user activity dynamics and transaction volumes. Even though Litecoin (LTC) boasts a circulating supply of 73.5 million Litecoin (LTC) and a market cap of $5.3 billion, it has slipped to the 15th spot in the crypto rankings. As the bear market continues to exert its influence, and as Chat GPT analysis suggests, Litecoin (LTC) journey ahead will be one of resilience, adaptation, and a quest to regain its former glory.\n\nLitecoin (LTC) Price Analysis\n\nMarket cap Price 2022 change Price 2021 change Price 2020 change Price 2019 change Litecoin (LTC) $4.64 B -48.54% 17.83% 200.73% 38.11%\n\nChainlink (LINK): ChatGPT Price Prediction\n\nChainlink (LINK), a decentralized blockchain oracle network, has recently announced its forthcoming upgrade: Chainlink Staking v0.2. As highlighted by Chat GPT, this upgrade aims to transform Chainlink staking by introducing a platform with a total pool size of 45 million Chainlink (LINK). However, it also raises questions about the network\u2019s adaptability and the broader market\u2019s response. The initial beta version of Chainlink staking (v0.1) launched last December had a 25 million LINK staking pool, focusing on the cryptoeconomic security of the ETH/USD Data Feed on Ethereum.\n\nCurrently, Chainlink (LINK) price hovers between $6.529 and $9.051. The 10-Days Moving Average stands at $7.340, hinting at potential short-term fluctuations, while the 100-Days Moving Average at $6.974 suggests a longer-term trend that\u2019s slightly below the current price range. Based on insights from Chat GPT, with support levels at $2.356 and $4.877, Chainlink (LINK) has some cushion against market downturns. However, resistance levels at $9.919 and $12.441 could pose challenges for upward movement.\n\nThe Chainlink Staking v0.2 upgrade, as pointed out by Chat GPT, introduces potential challenges. The new unbonding mechanism and enhanced security measures, such as stake-slashing, might deter potential stakers. Additionally, the modular architecture for future upgrades raises questions about the network\u2019s adaptability. With the rollout planned in three phases, each with its uncertainties, Chainlink (LINK) staking will be closely watched. The network\u2019s stability and its response to these challenges will be crucial in determining Chainlink (LINK)\u2019s market position.\n\nChainlink (LINK) Price Analysis\n\nMarket cap Price 2022 change Price 2021 change Price 2020 change Price 2019 change Chainlink (LINK) $4.16 B -71.47% 73.84% 536.07% 458.35%\n\nConclusion\n\nThe crypto sphere is poised for significant shifts as Bitcoin\u2019s ETF prospects could catalyze changes across the board. Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Chainlink (LINK) are each at their own crossroads, facing unique challenges and transformative developments within their ecosystems. The anticipation surrounding Ethereum (ETH) restaking proposals, Chainlink (LINK) staking platform evolution highlights the growing importance of user participation in network security and reward systems.\n\nAs these coins face an uncertain future, ScapesMania\u2019s growth rate and indicators should make people all over the crypto world sit up and take notice. Now is the right time to get involved since it\u2019s poised for growth and x500% ROI is only just the beginning. Discounts, limited-time giveaway, and a bonus of up to 150% can all be leveraged to make it even a sweeter deal.\n\nSite: https://scapesmania.io/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ScapesMania\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/scapesmania\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have been in especially in vogue ever since tech titans such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Twitter founder and CEO Jack Dorsey started talking about them on various social media platforms and some even started accepting payment in this form. While Bitcoin has been around for quite some time and it has also been instrumental in familiarising the world with cryptocurrencies and its underlying technology, that is, blockchain, it is only recently that interest in it has peaked again.\n\nFor those of you who are new to this technology, a cryptocurrency is decentralized digital money based on blockchain tech. It can be used to buy goods and services. It can also be invested in like an asset. However, it is considered to be more volatile compared to other assets such as property and gold, simply because there is no underlying asset, nor is there any government backing in most countries. Unlike fiat currency, which is notes and coins that are issued by the central bank of a country, a cryptocurrency is not managed by a central government authority. Cryptocurrency is based on cryptographic proof that is verified and recorded on a blockchain program. Once recorded, the details of a transaction cannot be tampered with. Every transaction is secured with two sets of keys -- a public key and a private key, which make it secure.\n\nNow that you have learned about the basics of cryptocurrency, let's take you through some of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the internet right now.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin is the first cryptocurrency. Its working principle was outlined by Satoshi Nakamoto in a paper titled \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\u201d back in 2009.\n\nBitcoin.org says that \u201cBitcoin is a consensus network that enables a new payment system and completely digital money. It is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its users with no central authority or middlemen. From a user perspective, Bitcoin is pretty much like cash for the Internet.\u201d\n\nBitcoin can be purchased from Bitcoin exchanges and it can be used at a growing number of brick-and-mortar businesses like restaurants, apartments, and law firms. At the time of writing this article, the value of Bitcoin stands at $64,574.39 as per CoinDesk.\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the internet right now. Ethereum.org says that \u201cEthereum is a technology that lets you send cryptocurrency to anyone for a small fee. It also powers applications that everyone can use and no one can takedown.\u201d \u2018ETH' is a cryptocurrency by Ethereum that can be used on the internet for purchasing goods and services.\n\nAt the time of writing this article, the value of ETH stands at $4,167.99 as per Ethereum.org.\n\nDogecoin\n\nDogecoin is a cryptocurrency just like ETH and Bitcoin. It was created by software engineers Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer in late 2013 as a part of a lighthearted joke for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Its logo features a popular meme at the time that includes a deliberately misspelt word \u2018doge' to describe a Shiba Inu dog.\n\nIts value exploded earlier this year after Elon Musk tweeted about it. According to a Forbes report, Dogecoin is easier to mine compared to Bitcoin as it is easier for miners to complete the mathematical equations that complete and record transactions. Additionally, there is no cap on the creation of Dogecoin, which makes it a better option for processing payments."
