        "title": "Ethereum Faces Critical Test At $1,960 As Massive 33 Million ETH Resistance Emerges - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been making significant strides in recent weeks, riding on the wave of positive developments in the crypto industry.\n\nOver the past seven days, Ether has witnessed a remarkable surge of 16%. However, its primary rival, Bitcoin, has outpaced it with a 20% surge during the same period. Notably, this surge saw Ethereum breaking key resistance at $1,745, sparking optimism among investors and analysts.\n\nDespite these gains, Ethereum\u2019s upward momentum is now at a critical juncture. The crypto community is closely monitoring a formidable resistance level at $1,960, which has raised concerns.\n\nOn Thursday, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez took to Twitter to shed light on this impending challenge, stating, \u201cWhen will Ethereum break out? Well, you may need to wait for $ETH to overcome the huge supply wall at $1,960. Here, 1.14 million addresses bought nearly 33 million ETH, according to data from Into the Block.\u201d\n\nThis said resistance level, often referred to as a \u201cbuy wall,\u201d represents a level where a substantial amount of Ethereum was bought in the past. Investors who bought then may be inclined to sell their Ethereum at this price point, which can act as a significant barrier to further price appreciation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, the close correlation between Ethereum and Bitcoin has been evident, where changes in one frequently impact the other. In another tweet, Martinez pointed out that Bitcoin\u2019s potential 5% correction to $33,000, driven by its formation of an ascending triangle on the hourly chart, a move that could trigger a similar selloff in Ethereum.\n\nAdding to Martinez\u2019s views, crypto analyst \u2018Cryptotony\u2019 also presented a bearish perspective on Ethereum, telling his 346,000 X followers that the cryptocurrency might gain momentum and test the $2,500 resistance zone before entering a distribution phase and possibly decline leading up to the next halving event.\n\nAnother analyst, \u2018Cryptonary,\u2019 emphasized the significance of Ethereum\u2019s ongoing test, stating that it was crucial to determine whether the bulls could break through the resistance at $1,960 or if Ethereum would echo Bitcoin\u2019s overbought signals.\n\nNotably, the pundit\u2019s technical analysis revealed that Ethereum had been oscillating between support at $1,745 and resistance at $1,823-$1,853, with no clear breakout yet. Additionally, he noted that the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) was overbought but not as extended as Bitcoin\u2019s.\n\nThat said, as Ethereum faces a pivotal moment along the $1,960 resistance level, the outcome of this test will determine whether Ethereum can continue its recent bullish trend, plunge or face a period of consolidation.\n\nEther was trading at $1,796 at press time after a 0.32% increase over the past 24 hours."

        "title": "Ethereum Excellence Could Propel This New ETF - ETF Trends",
        "content": "Ethereum serves as the platform for transactions conducted in the digital currency known as ether. It is widely known as the second-largest crypto asset behind bitcoin.\n\nThat\u2019s not necessarily a bad place to be. With a burgeoning usage case for smart contracts and more, ethereum has its own bull thesis that could match or exceed that of bitcoin. Additionally, as is the case with its larger rival, it has a penchant for drawing eye-catching price forecasts.\n\nPut it all together and there\u2019s a budding case for ethereum in the exchange traded funds wrapper. This a concept being met by new ETFs, including the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) . The ETF is less than a month old. It invests in CME-listed ethereum futures contracts with an emphasis on front-month contracts.\n\nAETH Could Be a Well-Timed Ethereum ETF\n\nNew ETFs, regardless of underlying asset class, can benefit from good timing. That perk may be enjoyed by AETH. That is because the fund debuted when an increasing number of cryptomarket participants are forecasting sizable gains for ether.\n\nSome ether bulls believe the digital currency will rise to $10,000, a more than fivefold increase from current levels. That outlook is supported by both attractive fundamentals and bullish technicals.\n\n\u201cFor almost its entire history of price action, ETHUSD has been filling out what appears to be a massive rising wedge pattern. Such patterns are predominantly bearish, breaking down roughly 60% of the time,\u201d reported Tony Severino for NewsBTC. \u201cThat leaves 40% of the time that these patterns break upward. Descriptions of the pattern reveal that wedges are notoriously prone to false breakouts and/or false breakdowns, where price violates one trend line, only to reverse and target the other.\u201d\n\nHow long it takes for ether to make good on the promise of its bullish technical setup remains to be seen. But $10,000 is likely a long way off. Some crypto experts believe that if ethereum can conquer $2,100, a significant near-term rally could be in the offing. Fortunately, there is a fundamental case to support ether\u2019s technical objectives and it could make AETH more appealing.\n\n\u201cEthereum is unlike many other crypto assets in that its value is driven directly by the use of the Ethereum blockchain. Every time people use an application built on Ethereum, they have to pay a fee using the Ethereum asset. This fee is returned to Ethereum investors in a manner similar to stock buybacks and dividends, providing an important starting point for valuations,\u201d according to Bitwise."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Fueled by optimism over the potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF, the crypto market has seen a surge in buying activity over the past week. As Bitcoin touched the $35,000 mark for the first time in 2023, the ripple effect extended to altcoins which resulted in an extended recovery sentiment. Thus, the second largest cryptocurrency Ethereum broke through its last swing high resistance at $1,745, signaling more room for an upward journey.\n\nAlso Read: 80% of Bitcoin Holders in Profit, What\u2019s Next? Caution or BTC Price Rally?\n\nadvertisement\n\nIs ETH Price Heading to $2000?\n\nAn upside breakout from the $1745 barrier prepares the ETH price for a 12.5% jump\n\nA bullish crossover between the 20-and-50-day EMA could boost the market buying pressure.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $6.6 Billion, indicating a 34% gain.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nThe ETH price has been on a seven-day ascent, climbing from an October 19 low of $1,643 to its current trading price of $1,786\u2014a notable 14.10% gain. This upswing enabled Ether to shatter a crucial two-month resistance at $1,745 on October 23, liberating the coin from a sideways range and completing a bullish reversal pattern known as a double bottom.\n\nDespite the rally, the presence of supply pressure near the $1,800 level suggests a possible short-term pullback to retest the $1,745 support. Should the Ethereum price successfully validate this level as new support, it would pave the way for an extended rally targeting the $1,970 to $2,000 range.\n\nAccording to Dow Theory, breaking past the last high resistance of $1,745 could indicate an early sign of a trend reversal for Ethereum.\n\nGlobal In/Out of the Money Metric\n\nSource- intotheblock\n\nAs for on-chain analytics, the Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) metric reveals that 62.13% of Ethereum addresses are currently in the money, realizing profits, while 34.19% are out of the money and experiencing losses. This suggests that a significant majority of ETH holders are in a profitable position, reducing the likelihood of fear selling in the near term.\n\nRelative Strength Index: the daily RSI above 70% marks reflects the active bullish momentum in the crypto market.\n\nExponential Moving Average: For the anticipated pullback, the 200 EMA slope wavering around the $1730 mark could offer strong support."

        "title": "Do rollups actually scale Ethereum or are we fooling ourselves? - Blockworks",
        "content": "In the quest to scale Ethereum, developers have been busily building mechanisms called \u201crollups\u201d that operate more efficiently \u201con top\u201d of the base chain.\n\nBut what exactly is a rollup? When asked the loaded question, Jon Charbonneau laughs.\n\n\u201cOh, this is gonna be tough,\u201d he says. \u201cThis has been, like, a whole big debate with everyone over the last few months.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to get the mental model right, he says, in order to determine the true purpose of a rollup \u2014 and whether it\u2019s a genuine scaling solution for Ethereum. After all, if it\u2019s just building \u201con top\u201d of the chain, is it really scaling the chain?\n\nOn the Lightspeed podcast (Spotify/Apple), the co-founder and partner at crypto investment firm DBA gives a simple definition before elaborating: \u201cA rollup is just some state that you derive off of some data, basically, that is posted on another blockchain, another data layer.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s data posted on Ethereum and I can run some state transition function over that data that says, \u2018Hey, this is the state of my rollup.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is all you really need to have a rollup at a fundamental level.\u201d Everything else, while important, is just a matter of implementation, he says.\n\nThe concept can get a little more convoluted when it comes to bridging \u2014 or not \u2014 back to Ethereum, Charbonneau explains. \u201cIf it lacks this bridge from the base layer to the rollup, well, then what the hell is the point of this thing?\u201d\n\nThe researcher notes that a rollup doesn\u2019t necessarily have to bridge back to the original data layer if it is strictly using the base network for its security properties. He suggests that a developer might decide to use another chain\u2019s consensus and other security benefits instead of bootstrapping their own validators, for example, allowing for a much easier setup.\n\nBut the use cases for such a rollup are \u201cunclear,\u201d Charbonneau says. \u201cYou want to be able to bridge assets around,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is what we are using most of these things for.\u201d\n\nDefining scaling\n\nThe discussion centers on the question: Do rollups actually contribute to scaling Ethereum or are they ultimately just offloading the activity elsewhere?\n\nThe crux of the matter is the meaning of \u201cscaling,\u201d Charbonneau explains. He defines it as \u201ctrying to get more throughput through a system relative to whatever the resource requirements are.\u201d\n\nWith rollups, he says \u201cit\u2019s possible to create more efficient execution environments that, for comparable amounts of resources, do get you a lot more throughput.\u201d\n\nIn regards to the question of whether rollups actually scale Ethereum, Charbonneau admits he doesn\u2019t have \u201cthe perfect answer.\u201d\n\nRead more: Blockchain tech narrative is \u2018lightyears ahead of reality,\u2019 says Dudas\n\nThe answer lies within a \u201cfuzzy line,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich is why a lot of people very reasonably say, \u2018okay, rollups aren\u2019t scaling Ethereum \u2014 you just have to consider the base layer itself.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re generally scaling it if you are using the properties of the underlying system in some way and retaining a lot of the underlying security properties of the system.\u201d\n\nScaling with rollups on Ethereum \u201clets you do a lot more interesting things with your [ether] [ETH] that you couldn\u2019t do on the base layer,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIf I send my [ETH] to Coinbase, and now I can do whatever I want with Coinbase, that\u2019s not really scaling in my mind at that point,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause you effectively just have no security properties derived from it.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "This article was originally published on ETFTrends.com.\n\nThe cryptocurrency universe is growing increasingly enthusiastic regarding the possibility that the SEC will soon approve a spot bitcoin ETF. But market participants shouldn\u2019t take their eyes off ethereum.\n\nEthereum is the digital platform for transactions conducted in ether, the second-largest digital currency behind bitcoin. Alone, that status makes ethereum worth watching, if not investing in. Regarding the latter point, a slew of recently launched U.S.-listed ETFs make that process easier. That group includes the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT).\n\nThe actively listed EFUT \"offers exposure to ether-linked investments through an accessible exchange traded vehicle. The Fund does not invest in ether or other digital assets directly,\u201d according to VanEck. Some interesting signs are pointing to near-term upside for ethereum, potentially signaling that EFUT is a new ETF for risk-tolerant investors to consider.\n\nEthereum Whale Watching\n\nA favorite pastime of some experienced crypto investors is monitoring \u201cwhale\u201d activity in some of the more broadly tracked, liquid digital currencies; namely, bitcoin and ether. In simple terms, whales are sizable owners of these cryptocurrenices, and their buy and sell orders can affect pricing.\n\nEFUT could receive a spark from ether whales because data indicates that cohort of market participants has recently been active.\n\n\u201cIndeed, Ethereum whale transactions, specifically those above $100,000, have skyrocketed to a six-month high, while the supply of ETH on exchanges has hit a record low since its genesis in 2015, according to the data shared by blockchain analytics platform Santiment on October 25,\u201d reported Ana Zirojevic for Finbold.\n\nIncreased activity among large traders could very well be one reason ether is higher by more than 14% over the past week. As Finbold noted, there were nearly 6,050 ethereum trades worth at least $100,000 on Tuesday, representing the biggest day by that metric in six months.\n\nStory continues\n\nPotentially adding to the case for EFUT is that point that the recent uptick in sizable activity in ethereum isn\u2019t a one-off contained to this digital currency. Rather, it\u2019s occurring across other major cryptocurrencies as well.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, Bitcoin (BTC), Cardano (ADA), and Dai (DAI) are witnessing massive increases in whale activity themselves, with Bitcoin recording 14,833 of $100,000+ transactions on October 24, the most since June\u2019s news of the multiple filings for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to the blockchain platform\u2019s analysis,\u201d observed Finbold.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Beyond Basic Beta Channel.\n\nPOPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COM\n\n\n\nREAD MORE AT ETFTRENDS.COM >"

ETH tested the $1,750 support where the bulls emerged. A low was formed near $1,756 and the price started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a move above the $1,780 and $1,785 resistance levels. The price was able to climb above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downside correction from the $1,849 swing high to the $1,756 low. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,795 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $1,780 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $1,825 level. It is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downside correction from the $1,849 swing high to the $1,756 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe first major resistance is near the $1,850 zone. A close above the $1,850 resistance could spark another rally. The next key resistance is near $1,880, above which the price could accelerate higher. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $1,950 level. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $2,000.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,825 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,800 level and the trend line region.\n\nThe next key support is $1,750 and the last swing low. The main support is now forming near the $1,740 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. A downside break below the $1,740 support might send the price further lower. In the stated case, Ether could drop toward the $1,700 level. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,660 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,750\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,850\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Venture capitalist Arthur Cheong says that Ethereum (ETH) could go on a massive rally if one possible scenario plays out.\n\nThe DeFiance Capital founder and CEO tells his 151,900 followers on the social media platform X that if BlackRock succeeds with its application for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) the financial giant may apply for a spot Ethereum ETF next.\n\nHe predicts a BlackRock application for a spot ETH ETF could happen within the year and that it would send Ethereum soaring.\n\n\u201cETH is probably the best six to 12 month long among large-cap assets now when BlackRock applies for spot ETH ETF six to 12 months down the road.\n\nEthereum\u2019s ESG (environmental, social, and governance) friendliness and native staking yield will be appealing to institutional investors should BTC spot ETF turn out to be a success.\u201d\n\nHowever, he says that the ETH/BTC trading pair is likely to remain in a correction for at least six months before Ethereum starts to make gains against the king crypto.\n\n\u201cDoes that mean ETH/BTC have bottomed? Probably not yet as all short-term focus will be on BTC combined with halving April next year. This is something that might pick up post BTC halving.\u201d\n\nETH/BTC is trading for 0.0526 BTC ($1,771) at time of writing.\n\nHe notes that crypto is potentially one of the best investments due to its global reach.\n\n\u201cThe biggest lesson from the past 10-15 years of financial market is the best investments to own are generally assets that attract global demand in nature and ideally US dollars denominated. What other assets attract global demand and USD denomination besides US equities and fixed incomes? Crypto.\u201d\n\nLastly, he suggests that Solana (SOL) is poised for a correction after a big rally and he suggests other altcoins may start breaking out next.\n\n\u201cMost of the market attention is on SOL but there are some names that are not that far behind with way less attention and not as overbought. Will we see follow-through?

        "title": "Ethereum Price Outlook: Can ETH Hit $2k This Year as This Token Also Looks Poised to Surge - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has showcased strong performance over the past week, with the token\u2019s price up 15% since Thursday.\n\nWith growing retail and institutional interest, many ETH holders are optimistic about it reaching the $2,000 level before the end of the year.\n\nMeanwhile, the newly launched Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) project is also making waves, offering investors an intriguing opportunity to get in on the ground floor before the token hits the open market.\n\nEthereum Poised to Hit $2,000 Amid Renewed Bullish Momentum\n\nETH is trading around the $1,787 level after posting six bullish daily closes in a row.\n\nThis sharp surge has taken ETH above the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) on the daily time frame, indicating that the token\u2019s trend has definitively shifted.\n\nETH has also breached the strong resistance level at $1,740, which had capped price twice since August.\n\nZooming out, the token has emerged from the tight trading range it was trapped in for over two months, signaling newfound bullish momentum that could pave the way toward $2,000 in the near term.\n\nIf ETH were to hit $2,000, it would represent a further 12% push from today\u2019s price and take the token to its highest value since July.\n\nWith spot trading volumes exceeding $11.7 billion in the past day and investor sentiment positive, Ethereum is in a solid position to sustain its trajectory and potentially reach this key milestone in the weeks ahead.\n\nConfluence of Factors Propels Ethereum\u2019s Price Rally\n\nEthereum\u2019s bullish momentum can be attributed to a confluence of positive factors.\n\nFirst, the recent Bitcoin price surge to $35,000 for the first time in over a year is lifting the broader crypto market.\n\nAs the world\u2019s second-largest coin, Ethereum often benefits from Bitcoin\u2019s price rallies.\n\nSecond, Ethereum is surging in part thanks to renewed optimism around a potential spot Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nIf approved, a spot BTC ETF is expected to bring significant new institutional investment into the crypto space, likely benefiting Ethereum.\n\nLastly, recent outflows from major crypto exchanges, such as over $500 million from Binance in 24 hours, signals that traders are moving assets into secure storage in anticipation of rising crypto prices.\n\nWith all these factors at play, many crypto community members believe Ethereum is poised to continue its surge to $2,000 \u2013 and possibly even higher.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix Also Bullish, Project Offers Exciting New Way to Earn as Crypto Bull Run Accelerates\n\nAs Ethereum and the broader crypto market continue to build momentum, another emerging token that looks well-positioned to surge is Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX).\n\nStill, in the early stages of its presale, Bitcoin Minetrix aims to disrupt the world of Bitcoin mining by tokenizing cloud mining credits on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nBy doing this, Bitcoin Minetrix enables everyday investors to gain exposure to BTC mining rewards, not just the coin\u2019s price movements.\n\nGiven Bitcoin\u2019s recent resurgence and the growing expectations of a prolonged bull run, the timing looks ideal for Bitcoin Minetrix to launch and allow users to earn recurring BTC payouts.\n\nNot only that, but Bitcoin Minetrix allows users to stake their BTCMTX tokens to earn yields of 259% per year \u2013 with over 161 million tokens staked already.\n\nEarly investors can buy BTCMTX tokens for just $0.0112 during Stage 3 of the ongoing presale event.\n\nHowever, the presale price will increase by 10% once the stage\u2019s funding goal of $3.1 million has been met \u2013 a milestone expected to be hit in the coming days, given the current investment momentum.\n\nOnce Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s presale ends, the developers plan to launch BTCMTX on numerous top exchanges, creating additional liquidity and potentially driving up demand.\n\nWith over 4,100 people following the project\u2019s Twitter page and the official Telegram channel seeing robust growth, Bitcoin Minetrix looks primed to capitalize on this engagement and make a strong market entrance.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "title": "Ethereum Could Soon Exceed $1,860 As 60% Of Holders Become Profitable: What\u2019s Next For ETH Price? - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nTill now, in October, Ethereum has seen a surge of more than 20%, revealing the bullish momentum of \u2018Uptober.\u2019 Nonetheless, as traders seek to cash in near the peak of $1,860, ETH\u2019s price faces challenges in climbing higher. Yet, the sentiment seems favorable as various on-chain metrics turn bullish, indicating that ETH is poised for another surge, potentially exceeding a 30% rise by the month\u2019s conclusion.\n\nConfidence Skyrockets Among 61% Profitable Holders\n\nAmid the hype surrounding ETF, a wave of FOMO led many to invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, these investors are now eyeing profitable exit points close to market peaks. This sentiment has put a pause on Ethereum\u2019s surge, particularly near the $1,860 high. Yet, the shift towards favorable on-chain metrics suggests a promising scenario, potentially fading bearish expectations for ETH\u2019s value.\n\nIntoTheBlock\u2019s data indicates that the recent rise in ETH price beyond $1,730 has positioned over 61% of holders in a profitable state. Consequently, the market maintains a healthy sentiment devoid of any substantial sell-off activities from these holders. Additionally, Open Interest is rising, suggesting traders\u2019 willingness to ride the increased volatility. This metric has experienced a $400 million surge in just a few hours, with the current standing at $5.7 billion.\n\nNonetheless, any unfavorable news could trigger a significant long-liquidation as whales recently lost interest following ETH\u2019s inability to break past the $1,860 mark. Indicators point to a $2.5 billion reduction in whale transfers as of yesterday. Furthermore, since the 23rd, the exchange netflow has shifted positively as there\u2019s been a notable surge in deposits onto exchanges compared to withdrawals.\n\nPresently, with a Netflow recorded at 33.2K ETH, it appears exchange reserves are on the rise as holders show a preference for liquidation. This trend could potentially trigger a price pullback under the current unstable conditions.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nEther\u2019s price is currently attempting to meet buyers\u2019 demand as it heads toward breaking above $1,860. However, increasing bearish pressure is creating multiple rejections for the altcoin. As of writing, ETH price trades at $1,784, declining over 1.2% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nAttempts were made to send the rally below $1,760, but a pronounced long wick on the day\u2019s candlestick indicates substantial buying pressure at lower prices. Now, all eyes are on the $1,860 mark, a critical resistance level. If the bulls successfully surpass this level, there\u2019s a chance for the ETH price to jump beyond $2,000.\n\nHowever, the bears might not stand idly by. They\u2019re likely plotting to pull the value down below the $1,760 threshold, aiming to trap overconfident bulls. Should this happen, the price could retreat to the 50-day EMA at $1,705. A move like this would imply a longer consolidation period for the price."

        "content": "Ethereum client developers confirmed on Thursday that the anticipated Dencun upgrade will not be implemented in a network hard fork before the end of 2023.\n\nAlready last month, when the new Hole\u0161ky testnet was successfully launched behind schedule, the consensus was that putting the upgrade through its paces by the time December holidays rolled around was unlikely.\n\nWhen an optimistic scenario was put forward on today\u2019s All Core Developers call, the consensus was evidently with pseudonymous Prysm developer Potuz, who commented, \u201cthere is no way we are forking mainnet in 2023.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to consistent consensus issues arising on the 10 developer networks (devnets) that have been spun up so far to test the upgrade over the past few months, adding that \u201cnot a single one went well.\u201d\n\nRead more: Devnet, testnet, mainnet: Ethereum\u2019s next upgrade progresses \u2014 slowly\n\nEthereum clients are divided into two main camps, one for the execution layer and the other the consensus layer, with the distinction reflected in the name of the upgrade \u2014 consensus teams use cities where Ethereum\u2019s major conference, Devcon, has been held (e.g. Cancun), while execution client developers opt for star names (e.g. Deneb) \u2014 hence \u201cDencun.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to the consensus teams, execution layer client teams reported being in good shape for the upcoming testnets.\n\n\u201cWe are in a pretty good place, a lot of things are also on Master now,\u201d said Geth developer known as Lightclient, referring to the Go Ethereum project\u2019s digital workspace where the code, files, and revision history are stored.\n\nDevnet 10 was launched this week, with plans for the execution clients to transition to a larger test on the Goerli testnet. But Prysm\u2019s Potuz is not on board with that idea.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely not comfortable at all having a full client fork on Goerli,\u201d he said. \u201cI see very large and deep changes still being pushed in the branch,\u201d he added regarding Prysm, the software currently runs 45% of the consensus layer clients.\n\nA smaller Devnet 11 is planned, but it now appears the move to testnets will be put off until after Ethereum\u2019s Devconnect developer conference, which will be held in Istanbul in mid-November.\n\nCelebrating the KZG ceremony\n\nThe Dencun upgrade required a bit of fancy cryptography to ensure the Ethereum scaling improvement, known as Proto-Danksharding, a key feature, remains secure.\n\nThe KZG Ceremony involved multiple participants, each concocting a secret and performing a computation to blend it with preceding contributions. This process results in the formation of a \u201cstructured reference string\u201d (SRS), which is crucial for the KZG Commitments cryptographic scheme, and integral to Proto-Danksharding.\n\nThe final outcome of this chain of contributions is then put into the upgrade. The whole setup remains secure so long as there is at least one honest participant in the ceremony. After months of soliciting contributions, a total of 141,416 makes that all but certain.\n\nCarl Beekhuizen, who coordinated the ceremony for the Ethereum Foundation, invited participants to verify that their contributions are, in fact, included, by visiting ceremony.ethereum.org.\n\nThere, one can input a contributing wallet address, and receive a commemorative POAP NFT.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

I've told more than one young financial journalist over the years that clearing is a vital part of financial markets, yet it's generally a dull topic, so it's important when writing about clearing to stress the former to overcome the latter. But it turns out DTCC can spark excitement! BlackRock's proposed ETF showed up on a DTCC webpage, complete with a CUSIP and ticker symbol. Crypto folks thought that was good news, maybe even a sign BlackRock's application had been approved. It definitely didn't mean that, though it's not exactly bad news that BlackRock is completing this prep work, getting a CUSIP and ticker, etc. This possibly misguided optimism likely fueled some, or maybe even most, of Monday's big bitcoin rally. But boring websites giveth and boring websites taketh away. By Tuesday, BlackRock's ETF had vanished from the DTCC site. Bitcoin fell . Later in the day, DTCC revealed something to CoinDesk that meant people probably shouldn\u2019t have gotten so worked up this week: The BlackRock ETF has been on that page since August."

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nFollowing the news of Bitcoin ETF, the crypto market has gained significant value movement. The information has attracted more institutional traders, resulting in the price experiencing a massive jump in value.\n\nBitcoin price has recorded a surge of over 19% in value in the past week, breaking the price out of its important resistance level of $31,000.\n\nThe Ethereum price has displayed a massive price action in its value and has followed the footsteps of the market leader as it has jumped over 14% within the past week, resulting in the altcoin breaking out of its key resistance at $1,745.26 for the first time in over 50 days, further indicating a bullpower in the market.\n\nTradingView: ETH/USDT\n\nETH price had witnessed a significant fall in its value from $1,850 to $1,650 during mid-August, following which the star altcoin lost momentum and started trading in a closed range of $1,600 and $1,686. The coin attempted to break out and start a bullish jump, but the price repeatedly got rejected at $1,745.26, making it a key resistance level.\n\nFurther, the ETH coin was seen trading under a bearish influence, resulting in the coin breaking down its crucial support level at $1,600. Ethereum then started trading close to its lower support level at $1,539.01 for a short period, following which the market gained momentum.\n\nThe ETH price broke out of multiple resistance levels to test its important resistance level at $1,800 and successfully managed to cross it, but the rally was short-lived as the bears pulled back the price below the $1,800 mark, forming a long wick in the chart.\n\nThe MACD displays a robust rising green histogram in its chart, indicating a massive ongoing price action for the Altcoin. Further, the averages show a rising pattern, suggesting the price to continue rising in the coming days.\n\nWill ETH Price Rise Again?\n\nIf the bulls continue to hold the price and push it above the $1,800 mark, the ETH price will regain momentum and prepare to test the upper resistance level of $1,916.13 soon.\n\nFurther, if the bulls continue to dominate the market, the price will make a run to reclaim its $2,000 mark in the coming month.\n\nConversely, suppose the bears regain power over the bulls, and a trend reversal occurs. In that case, the ETH price will experience a drop below its support level at $1,745.26 and continue to plunge and test its lower support level of $1,686.77 in the coming days.\n\nMoreover, if the bulls fail to hold the price at that level, the price will continue to dip and test its crucial support level at $1,600 in the coming days."

        "content": "New POL token will facilitate restaking for multi-chain Polygon ecosystem\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nPolygon's new POL token is live on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nPolygon announced the news on Oct. 25, comprising a major milestone in the project\u2019s ongoing \u201c2.0\u201d overhaul. The roadmap seeks to establish Polygon\u2019s various scaling solutions as an interoperable ecosystem, launch a new staking layer, and unify its PoS Chain and ZkEVM networks.\n\nPOL will power Polygon's upcoming revamped staking layer. The layer will support restaking, allowing stakers to simultaneously perform multiple tasks for different Polygon networks \u2014 including transaction sequencing, proof generation, and committee participation. POL will also comprise the network token for Polygon chains.\n\n\u201cThe launch of POL is a major milestone on the Polygon 2.0 roadmap, but it\u2019s only the beginning,\u201d said Mihailo Bjelic, the co-founder of Polygon. \u201cIt paves the way for a number of upgrades, including launching a new staking layer to power Polygon L2s, upgrading Polygon PoS to zkRollup, and implementing an... interoperability and shared liquidity protocol for all these L2s.\u201d\n\nThe launch follows months of development and a successful testnet deployment. Polygon previously said it aims to enable migrations from its existing MATIC token to POL by the end of the year.\n\nPolygon 2.0\n\nPolygon first unveiled its 2.0 roadmap in June before outlining plans for a governance overhaul in July. The upgrades seek to consolidate and unify Polygon\u2019s various scaling solutions into an interconnected ecosystem secured by a shared staking layer.\n\nPolygon\u2019s ecosystem currently spans its Layer 2 rollup, ZkEVM, its long-standing Ethereum sidechain, PoS Chain, and its Layer 3 architecture, Supernets. Polygon also continues to develop Miden, a ZK-STARK-based L2.\n\nPolygon\u2019s new staking layer will leverage \u201crestaking\u201d to allow validators to secure its various chains using a single token.\n\nRestaking was pioneered with the launch of EigenLayer on Ethereum in June. EigenLayer allows Ethereum stakers to validate third-party services while also securing the Ethereum blockchain to earn additional yields on top of staking rewards. However, the mechanism also comes with increased slashing risks, meaning restakers could be penalized if the services they secure misbehave.\n\nPolygon designed its restaking mechanism to exclusively service chains within its own ecosystem, reducing the threat of slashing penalties.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha?

However, the profit booking an impulsive buying in crypto is nothing new.\n\n\n\nBitcoin saw some profit booking after a strong secular rally as the largest crypto token declined over a per cent but managed to hold about 34,000-levels. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, dropped almost 2 per cent but remained below $1,800-level. Majority of the altcoins were trading lower.\n\n\n\nBitcoin's value recently crossed the $35,000 threshold following the sudden appearance of BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF (IBTC) ticker on the US Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation's website. However, within the last 24 hours, prices settled back around $34,000 after the ticker's temporary disappearance and subsequent reappearance, said Edul Patel,Co-Founder & CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"This bullish momentum may also be linked to Grayscale's legal triumph over the US SEC, as the DC Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the agency to reconsider its rejection of Grayscale's spot bitcoin ETF application. These combined factors have fostered optimism among market participants, who are hopeful about the imminent approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF applications,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring a few exceptions, the majority of top crypto tokens were trading lower on Wednesday. Dogecoin and Polkadot tumbled over 3 per cent each, while Toncoin, Polygon, Solana and BNB were down 2 per cent each. Among the gainers, Chainlink rallied over 11 per cent, while XRP added about a per cent.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly lower, falling down to $1.25 trillion-mark, as it declined about a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes dropped over 13 per cent to $69.61 billion.\n\n\n\nOver the past 24 hours, both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have experienced a decline, which could be linked to the temporary removal of BlackRock's (BLK) spot Bitcoin ETF ticker, IBTC, from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation's (DTCC) website. However, it's important to note that the ticker was relisted after a few hours, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\n\n\"From a technical perspective, both BTC and ETH are trading above the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA-D) and are currently consolidating after their recent upward momentum. While ETH faces a few resistance levels to clear for its uptrend, BTC is showing strength as it reaches a 52-week high,\" he said.\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nAptos (APT), trading above its 50-day exponential moving average, is in an ascending trend. The asset has broken above the previous key resistance of $5.5 and is currently experiencing a rally, due to wider positive sentiment in the market.

According to a press release today, Polygon made a move after several months of development, a successful testnet launch, and community consultation.\n\nNotably, the POL token upgrade on the Ethereum mainnet is part of the Polygon 2.0 roadmap. It bears mentioning that POL will replace MATIC as Polygon\u2019s native token.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAs a result, the token will power multiple Polygon-based blockchains through a native re-staking protocol, thus allowing holders to validate various chains.\n\nIn addition, POL holders can also perform a variety of roles on each ZK-based L2 chain, including participating in data availability committees, sequencing, and ZK proof generation.\n\nIn a statement, Polygon Labs disclosed:\n\n\u201cThe POL upgrade paves the way for the next series of milestones in the Polygon 2.0 roadmap. That list includes launching a new staking layer to power Polygon L2s, upgrading Polygon PoS to zkRollup, and implementing an advanced, ZK-powered interoperability and shared liquidity protocol for all these L2s.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nProposal to Upgrade MATIC to POL\n\nRecall that in July, a group of Polygon researchers and founders proposed a token upgrade that would see POL replace MATIC as the ecosystem\u2019s native token.\n\nInterestingly, the researchers proposed that POL functions as a single token for all Polygon-based blockchains, including the main blockchain, Polygon\u2019s zkEVM, as well as various supernets.\n\nAccording to the whitepaper, users will be required to perform a simple technical action to upgrade their MATIC tokens to POL. The upgrade requires users to send MATIC to the upgraded contract. In return, users will automatically receive an equivalent amount of POL.\n\nFurthermore, users will be given ample time for the upgrade, which could take up to four years or more.\n\nPolygon Highlights Proposal for POL Upgrade\n\nAs part of the Polygon 2.0 roadmap, the team released three Polygon Improvement Proposals (PIPs) in September.\n\nThe first proposal, dubbed PIP-17, detailed how Polygon will replace MATIC with POL. PIP-18, the second proposal, focused on Phase 0 of the upgrade.\n\nThe proposal requires both developers and end-users to do nothing, as the upgrade will be implemented automatically. The third proposal, PIP-19, highlights the compatibility in the switch to POL from MATIC."

According to an update on October 25, Polygon Labs, the team behind the Ethereum sidechain, Polygon, said the move is a milestone for the project. The team claims the release of POL \u201cpaves the way for the next series of milestones in the Polygon 2.0 roadmap.\u201d\n\nPolygon 2.0 Taking Shape: What\u2019s In Store?\n\nThe Ethereum sidechain continues to build. Despite challenges in the last bear run, which saw MATIC, the platform\u2019s native currency, drop below $1 before crashing to spot levels, the team announced the start of Polygon 2.0, reviving developer activity.\n\nThe primary objective of the upgrade is to make the network more scalable, secure, and user-friendly. To achieve this, Polygon will leverage a new consensus mechanism, proof-of-stake liquidity (POSL), which the developer claims is more efficient.\n\nNotably, the team is developing key differences between this consensus system for Polygon 2.0. For instance, validators must stake their native tokens and liquidity to participate in the network.\n\nThe liquidity provided by participating validators will then be channeled to boost the liquidity of its decentralized exchanges (DEXes). Subsequently, once Polygon 2.0 goes live, exchanges running on the sidechain will be more liquid, meaning users can easily swap tokens in a low-fee, highly scalable environment.\n\nWill MATIC Bulls Break $1?\n\nMoreover, POL will be critical for Polygon 2.0. With the token now being initiated on the Ethereum mainnet, Polygon Labs is jump-starting the process, setting the ball rolling for POL, which the team said will \u201cpower a vast ecosystem of ZK-based layer-2 chains.\u201d\n\nThe team claims POL is a \u201chyperproductive token\u201d primarily designed to power a multichain ecosystem. Besides, the token will be used to settle fees, and holders will participate in governance. At the same time, those who choose to stake it will be paid in the token.\n\nStill, it is not clear whether this update will support MATIC prices in the long run. At present, the $1 psychological level remains elusive.\n\nLooking at price charts, MATIC is already up 30% from October 2023 lows and continues to unwind losses. Moreover, bulls have reversed the dump of October 17 and continue to power higher.\n\nFrom the daily chart, bull bars are banding along the upper BB, a volatility indicator. This suggests that the underlying momentum is building up, favoring optimistic buyers.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum Validator Queues for Entry and Exit Positions Drop to New Record Lows: Report\n\nSource: Pexels\n\nThe Ethereum network\u2019s validator queue is empty for the first time since the Shanghai update in May, signaling that investor demand for Ether staking is plummeting.\n\nAccording to blockchain data report from Validator Queues, merely a few validators are in the Ethereum network entry and exit queue, and their initiation process is almost instant.\n\nSource: ValidatorQueue\n\nThe report revealed that there were about 96,508 validators in the queue to stake ETH on its PoS network as of June 10.\n\nHowever, there are currently no validators in the entry queue, a significant decrease from its peak earlier this year. This shows an increasing impact on the broader staking landscape.\n\nSource: ValidatorQueue\n\nThe average wait time (queue) for validators to join the blockchain network is zero minutes, compared to the 45 days and 22 hours validators had to queue in for in early June.\n\nAt press time, the activation and exit limit for validators, known as Churn Limit, has increased from 12 to 13 epochs. This means a daily limit of 2,925 validators can join or exit the Ethereum network.\n\nEthereum Staking Rewards Continues To Plummet\n\nThe dwindling rate of Ethereum\u2019s entry and exit queues for validators is the first for the network since it launched \u201c Shanghai ,\u201d also referred to as Shapella upgrade, in April.\n\nThe upgrade signaled Ethereum\u2019s upcoming transition to an anticipated and fully functional proof-of-stake network (PoS) and propelled the rise of institutional investors depositing large amounts of ETH.\n\nValidators maintain and secure Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake blockchain by locking up their Ether. In exchange, they earn staking rewards.\n\nValidators were granted the ability to withdraw their staked ETH for the first time, eliminating risk factors for investors concerned about not getting their funds back. Unfortunately, things have now started to cool off.\n\nAccording to Glassnode\u2019s Ethereum on-chain data metrics , staking rewards have dropped significantly to nearly 3.3% from the previous 7% earlier this year.\n\nDespite the slump in yields, ETH supply increased by $47M last week. Many analysts attributed this increase in supply to the decline in transaction activity in the past few days.\n\nNevertheless, while the demand for staking ETH has dropped, the number of active validators has also increased.\n\nValidator Queues report shows that there are currently 861,938 active validators on the Ethereum network, with 22.79% of the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply staked.\n\nSource: ValidatorQueue"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nCrypto analyst Ali Martinez, who often publishes crypto charts for particular coins and comments on them on his X app profile, has shared this time a screenshot with an Ethereum chart provided by IntoTheBlock to answer the question as to when Ethereum is likely to begin surging.\n\nIn order to do that, the analyst believes, the second most popular digital currency needs to overcome a certain major resistance in its way \u2014 the big supply wall at the $1,960 level. Here, according to the analyst's X post, 1.14 million wallets purchased a massive Ethereum amount of almost 33 million coins, according to the screenshot.\n\nWen #Ethereum break out?\n\n\n\nWell, you may need to wait for $ETH to overcome the huge supply wall at $1,960. Here, 1.14 million addresses bought nearly 33 million #ETH, according to @intotheblock. pic.twitter.com/B2noPQbJPc \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) October 26, 2023\n\nNew whales breaking their necks to buy ETH\n\nEarlier this week, several brand new wallets were spotted that acquired a terrific amount of Ethereum. Four new blockchain addresses grabbed 56,070 ETH, paying a cumulative $98.06 million in fiat for it.\n\nAt the start of the week, the Ethereum price pleased the crypto community with a mighty jump of 10.57% to reach the $1,846 level per coin. On the same day, the global flagship crypto, Bitcoin, soared by 11.73%, breaking above the $34,000 level and leading the way up for the rest of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nEthereum price performance\n\nUnlike other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin has so far managed to hold onto that level, supported by the growing hype about the SEC being likely to greenlight the Bitcoin spot ETF pretty soon. Actually, many large figures in the world of finance expect this positive decision to be made this year \u2014 among them founder of SkyBridge Capital Anthony Scaramucci and chief of Galaxy Digital Mike Novogratz.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum shed a bit of its Monday gains and for a few days traded within the $1,780 range. Then, after a 4.29% rise today, the second biggest coin has dropped back to the $1,821 level, where it is changing hands at the time of this writing.\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin ETFs\n\nMeanwhile, it is not only Bitcoin ETFs that have been making news recently. Several Ethereum futures ETFs were also launched in October (\"Uptober\" as the crypto community loves to call it for bullish prospects). However, the trading volume of those products surprisingly was not as high as it was expected to be.\n\nThe funds were launched by such companies as ProShares, VanEck, Bitwise, Valkyrie, Kelly and VolShares on CBOE. Their trading volumes only managed to reach a combined $1.7 million in trading volume during the first several hours of their trading debut.\n\nWhen a Bitcoin futures ETF was launched by ProShares in 2021, its volume surged above $200 million just within the first quarter of an hour since trading began.\n\nNow, several Ethereum spot ETFs are pending as the SEC is considering them, along with Bitcoin spot ETFs. Grayscale filed for the former."

Discover SCENE\n\nNew Polygon, new token.\n\nAs the multi-chain scaling solution continues to roll out its updated roadmap, Polygon today finally deployed the token contracts for its new POL token on Ethereum.\n\nA token contract is a type of smart contract that has the records and utilities powering a token, like its supply and who holds what balance.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPOL will replace the network's current MATIC token; the network will not support two tokens. MATIC holders will have four years to migrate their holdings to the new token.\n\nThe POL token was first announced back in July and is expected to play a critical role in the network's wider upgrade.\n\nOriginally launched as a proof-of-stake network to help Ethereum scale, Polygon has become a sprawling series of different tech solutions, including application-specific blockchains and zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine-based (EVMs) networks.\n\nThe former refers to networks optimized for a specific use case, like gaming or stablecoins, for instance, and may even have their own native cryptocurrency.\n\nThe latter is a broader spectrum scaling solution and joins a host of zk-specific scaling solutions like zkSync Era, Starknet, and Linea.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo help secure all these networks, the POL token will reportedly let users stake their holdings across as many compatible chains as they wish.\n\nThis means that as soon as they deposit their holdings, they start earning protocol rewards and transaction fees on each staked chain.\n\nIn terms of what's next on the roadmap, Polygon has hinted at moving its PoS chain to a pure-play zkRollup as well as introducing a new interoperability standard for its various chains.\n\nEdited by Stephen Graves"

Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) position against Bitcoin (BTC) has been in a steady decline.

Historical data, represented by the pink line, showcases Ethereum\u2019s peak dominance at -0.085, typically seen during bull markets when Ethereum outperforms. However, the tables turn in bear markets, with Bitcoin taking the lead.\n\nAs current trends suggest, we might be on the verge of a market shift with Bitcoin potentially regaining its dominance in terms of market cap."

        "content": "According to Etherscan.io, an Ethereum (ETH) whale has moved 30,710 ETH, worth around $54.9 million, to the crypto exchange Binance. The whale had recently withdrawn 42,311 ETH from Binance, leading many to speculate if it made a profit on the 30,710 ETH and hence is moving to sell them, leaving it with 11,601ETH.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction: October End 2023\n\nThe whale began withdrawing its Ethereum (ETH) on Sept. 20. The total withdrawn amount has come to over $75.67 million, with an average price per ETH of around $1,667. The whale might have sent its holdings to Binance to realize profits as ETH closes in on $1.8k.\n\nThe large transfer to Binance could spell trouble for ETH investors. The transfer of tokens to an exchange increases the chances of them being sold, which could bring down the asset\u2019s price. ETH has surged by over 14% in the weekly charts. However, the altcoin is down by 1.1% in the last 24 hours.\n\nWill Ethereum\u2019s price take a hit if the whale sells its holdings?\n\nSource: Investopedia\n\nAny sale of such a magnitude will likely impact ETH price. However, Bitcoin (BTC) is currently leading the markets, and a sell-off of ETH will most likely not make a dent in the larger crypto market. Moreover, recently investors with over $1 billion worth of ETH took control of 32% of the token\u2019s current supply. If some of these billionaires decide to sell, it may have dire consequences for the project.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Billionaires Now Hold 32% of Supply\n\nAs long as BTC continues to rally, ETH may enjoy a similar pattern. Moreover, several bullish developments for BTC could sustain its rally, including a spot BTC ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) approval in the U.S. and BTC\u2019s next halving cycle. Both of these events could spark a new bull run for the crypto market."

Now, it's deploying contracts on the Ethereum mainnet. This token is an evolution of MATIC, and it looks to align with the architecture of the upcoming Polygon 2.0 upgrade.\n\nPrice Action: MATIC in the past 24 hours has seen a drop of 33.9% in its trading volume while the price of the token is down around 1% at the time of writing.\n\nThe upgrade involves the following steps, launching a new staking layer to fuel Polygon Layer 2 chains, transitioning Polygon proof-of-stake to zkRollup, and implementing a ZK-powered interoperability and shared liquidity protocol for all the Layer 2s.\n\nAlso Read: Google Cloud Joins The List of 100-Plus Validators On Polygon's Network\n\nFind out more about the Polygon network and its token Meet and engage with other transformative Digital Asset and Crypto business leaders and investors at Benzinga's exclusive event: Future of Digital Assets. Tickets are flying: Get yours! The token will not replace MATIC immediately. Replacement needs to have governance approval and will be synchronized with the rollout of the Polygon 2.0 upgrade. MATIC holders will have four years to migrate their holdings to the new token.\n\nThis development comes on the heels of a series of approved Polygon Improvement Proposals in September which detailed POL token specifications.\n\nWhy It Matters: POL will now serve as the main cryptocurrency for the Polygon 2.0 ecosystem, supporting an ecosystem of zero-knowledge-based Layer 2 chains and including features such as staking, community ownership, and governance.\n\n\u201cPOL, a next-generation hyperproductive token, will power a vast ecosystem of zero knowledge-based Layer 2 chains via a native re-staking protocol that allows POL holders to validate multiple chains and perform multiple roles on each of those chains,\u201d Polygon Labs said in a statement on its blog.\n\nThis step will enable POL to function as a single token for all Polygon-based networks including the main Polygon blockchain, the Polygon zkEVM network, and various supernets like application-specific blockchains that run over the main Polygon network.\n\nBenzinga's Future of Digital Assets conference is scheduled in New York on Nov.14. Attend and learn more about the Ethereum mainnet and the various tokens operating on it. The gathering is seen as pivotal for the digital assets community.

        "content": "External - Press Release\n\nBy: Chainwire \u2022\n\nExternal PR\n\nLondon, UK, October 25th, 2023, Chainwire\n\n\n\n\n\nContango, a unique decentralized market that builds perps on top of money markets, has launched on Polygon PoS and Ethereum mainnet today, expanding its liquidity to a staggering $2.4B.\n\nIts unique perpetual instruments are called cPerps (Contango perps) and are built without an order book or liquidity pools.\n\nAt a high level, long and short positions are synthesized by creating leveraged exposure on spot and money markets. More precisely, Contango builds perps by automating a looping strategy. Looping is the DeFi-native way of leveraging on-chain and became popular when users started borrowing and lending recursively on MakerDAO and Compound to build a leveraged exposure to a certain asset.\n\nCurrently, Contango employs Aave as the underlying money market for cPerps, which, at the time of writing, totals $2.4B in liquidity across Polygon PoS, Arbitrum, Optimism and Ethereum ( source).\n\n\u201cLaunching cPerps on Polygon PoS and Ethereum marks another step forward for Contango \u2013 explains Kamel Aouane, co-founder of Contango \u2013 as traders can now benefit from greater liquidity on L1, as well as cheap fees and fast transactions on L2s.\u201d\n\nBesides traders, cPerps have a particularly interesting use case for loopers and whales looking to access on-chain leverage. Aouane explains: \u201cIf you\u2019re preparing for the bull market and want to build up a large low-leverage position over the long-term, you need two things: deep liquidity and funding rates with low volatility. Contango offers you both, hiding away all the complexity of looping behind a simple trading interface.\u201d\n\ncPerps funding rates are determined by Aave\u2019s lending and borrowing rates, and these are notoriously less volatile than funding fees of derivative exchanges. An internal study by the Contango team confirms that over the past 8 months these rates have been less volatile than Binance, the largest centralized exchange, and dYdX, the leading decentralized derivatives protocol ( source).\n\nAouane also emphasized the scalability of the design behind Contango: \u201cIn just three weeks we have expanded horizontally, launching on four major chains. Now we plan to expand vertically, by integrating more markets within the same chains.\u201d\n\nAfter Aave, the team is targeting an integration with Compound, Spark, MakerDAO, and Morpho. \u201cThe integration with Morpho Blue is particularly interesting \u2013 says Aouane \u2013 as their new design with custom loan-to-values could allow for higher leverage on Contango\u201d.\n\nTraders can already try cPerps on Polygon PoS and all the major chains at: https://app.contango.xyz/\n\nAbout Contango\n\nContango builds perps through looping on money markets. Deep liquidity is sourced on money markets, where interest rates produce less volatile funding rates. An intuitive trading interface welcomes advanced traders ready to trade with size, seasoned loopers looking for better monitoring tools, and degens eager to farm rewards on money markets.\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Discord | Docs | Blog | Media kit\n\n\n\n\n\nContact\n\nContango team\n\ninfo@contango.xyz\n\n"

If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThe adoption of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum into luxury and high-end commerce is an exciting development that has sparked considerable interest and speculation. Ferrari, a name synonymous with sophistication and excellence, has ventured into digital currencies, ratifying Bitcoin and Ethereum as acceptable forms of payment. The Ferrari crypto move signifies a growing acknowledgment of the role of cryptocurrencies in the global economy and raises the question of which digital assets might be next. As Bitcoin Spark continues to gain momentum and acceptance, it might soon find its place on the list of accepted payment methods.\n\nFerrari Crypto\n\nFerrari\u2019s decision is a compelling example of the ongoing evolution of cryptocurrencies, paving the way for future integrations and advancements in the financial landscape. Ferrari, the luxury car manufacturer, will let US customers use cryptocurrency to pay for their cars, with plans to expand this to the Europe clientele. Ferrari crypto news pinpoints that some customers are wealthy crypto investors, and others want to diversify their payment options. They\u2019ll be using BitPay to handle the crypto transactions. Such a rare move reflects Elon Musk\u2019s decision to accept Bitcoins as a means of payment in Tesla. Although Ferrari won\u2019t hold the cryptocurrencies themselves, it is a move signifying widespread crypto adoption.\n\nBitcoin Spark (BTCS)\n\nBitcoin Spark is a project that combines innovation, inclusivity, and sustainability. Its Proof of Process (PoP) mechanism addresses the energy and resource consumption issues often associated with traditional blockchain technologies. Bitcoin Spark aims to distribute ownership across devices by encouraging power renting. This approach enhances network security and resilience against potential attacks while ensuring diversified participation and benefits.\n\nBTCS strives to open the doors to a broader mining audience by offering a user-friendly mining application. BTCS simplifies the mining process by removing barriers often associated with specialized hardware. Anyone can mine BTCS using simple devices like standard computers or smartphones, promoting inclusivity and accessibility for participants. The platform\u2019s user-friendly mining application ensures that users, regardless of their technical expertise, can engage in BTCS mining.\n\nBitcoin Spark offers an exciting investment opportunity, especially for those looking for a project that values community involvement, energy efficiency, and accessibility. Its ICO, currently in phase eight, has gained traction as it receives enormous inflows. It provides investors with the chance to acquire BTCS tokens at a discounted rate of $3.25 with a 6% bonus and a lucrative return on investment of 326% when the platform fully launches in November. The launch price is expected to be $10. BTCS smart contract audit is good news for investors as its findings depict a stable, secure, transparent, and compliant infrastructure.\n\nBTCS will integrate a smart contract layer into its network, allowing for the expansion of its functionality without transaction congestion. This multi-layer approach sets the stage for the development of diverse applications using different programming languages. This versatility could make BTCS a versatile and dynamic platform in the evolving blockchain landscape.\n\nBTC Price\n\nBitcoin (BTC), despite its famous price volatility, has been the best-performing asset class over the last decade. Launched in 2009, it pioneered the crypto ecosystem. Despite incredible BTC price increases over the years, Bitcoin remains a subject of debate, particularly regarding its environmental impact due to its energy-intensive mining process. Nevertheless, it has gained widespread acceptance as a store of value and investment asset, and its market continues to evolve.\n\nThe current price of Bitcoin is $28,349.58, which represents a decrease of -0.61% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization now stands at approximately $553.33 billion. Year-to-date, Bitcoin has experienced a price change of 71.42%.\n\nETH Price\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap after Bitcoin, is a decentralized computing platform serving as a foundation for various applications, decentralized finance (DeFi) apps, and services, among other things.\n\nETH price has hovered between $1,745 and $1,530 for the last two months. ETH price is currently 68.30% below its all-time high of $4,891.70.\n\nLearn more on BTCS and ICO:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register"

        "content": "Polygon Labs has launched the Ethereum contract for the new Polygon token, POL, according to an Oct. 25 announcement. The new token is intended to replace the ecosystem\u2019s current token, MATIC (MATIC). However, the team said users presently don\u2019t need to exchange their MATIC for POL.\n\nThe POL token upgrade is now live on Ethereum mainnet.\n\n\n\nPolygon 2.0, released this summer, is a roadmap for scaling Ethereum to build the Value Layer of the Internet. POL unlocks that future.\n\n\n\nPOL is a next-generation token that can power a vast ecosystem of ZK-based L2 chains.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/gmrsu0ZqLz \u2014 Polygon (Labs) (@0xPolygonLabs) October 25, 2023\n\nAccording to blockchain data, the new token was created on Oct. 25 at 9:06 am UTC. Its full name is the \u201cPolygon Ecosystem Token.\u201d In the announcement, the Polygon team claimed that POL would \u201cpower a vast ecosystem of zero knowledge-based Layer 2 chains\u201d by implementing a \u201cre-staking protocol\u201d that allows tokenholders to stake it on multiple chains, performing multiple functions in the process.\n\nThe token\u2019s launch will now pave the way for other aspects of the Polygon 2.0 roadmap to be implemented, including the launch of a new staking layer for the Polygon ecosystem, upgrading the current proof-of-stake (PoS) network to zkEVM layer-2, and creating a shared liquidity protocol for all Polygon networks, the post stated.\n\nRelated: ZK-focused Manta Pacific opts out of OP Stack for Polygon CDK\n\nThe team emphasized that POL is not currently being used for any systems in the Polygon network. Staking on both Polygon PoS and Polygon zkEVM is still being performed via the old token, MATIC, and gas fees on the PoS network are still being paid for with MATIC. So, users, validators,and app developers do not need to exchange their MATIC for POL at present.\n\nPolygon Labs first announced it was developing a new layer-2 ecosystem on June 29. It called the new ecosystem \u201cPolygon 2.0.\u201d On Sept. 14, the team announced that Polygon 2.0 would use a new token, POL. But at the time, the token was just a proposal and had not been deployed to Ethereum.\n\nPolygon\u2019s proposed layer-2 ecosystem will use zero-knowledge proofs to validate transactions between networks. It will face competition from the Optimism ecosystem proposed by Optimism Labs, which will use optimistic rollup technology to secure messages between networks."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum has long held a prominent position. However, recent data indicates that Solana (SOL) is increasingly becoming a preferred choice in various global markets, with India being a noteworthy example.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeveral compelling factors underpin Solana's escalating fame on the Indian subcontinent. For one, the cost-effectiveness of Solana transactions stands out. In a nation where value-driven decisions often determine market choices, the frugality associated with Solana is hard to overlook. The relatively low transaction fees offer a refreshing alternative, especially in contrast to the sometimes excessive fees on the Ethereum network.\n\nFurther cementing its position in the Indian ecosystem is Solana's strategic marketing, tailored specifically to resonate with Indian developers. By recognizing the vast talent pool and the potential of Indian developers, Solana has effectively broadened its user base and fostered a sense of community. It is a smart move, considering India's rich IT sector and its knack for innovation in the tech arena.\n\nMoreover, during bullish market cycles, Ethereum's gas fees tend to skyrocket, positioning Solana as an economical alternative. The price point, combined with its robust technical foundation, lends credence to the argument that Solana is not just a fleeting trend but a sustainable force in the crypto realm.\n\nThe accompanying chart reinforces this narrative. From the latter part of 2023, there is a noticeable uptick in Solana's trajectory. The sharp ascent, particularly in the last quarter, indicates not just increased interest but also growing trust in its stability and potential return on investment. While past performance is not always indicative of future results, this consistent growth trajectory suggests that Solana is on a path that many seasoned investors are keen to watch."

The upgrade to POL has been initiated on the Ethereum mainnet, after months of development, community consultation and a successful testnet launch,\u201d said Polygon Labs.\n\nThe POL token upgrade is now live on Ethereum mainnet. Polygon 2.0, released this summer, is a roadmap for scaling Ethereum to build the Value Layer of the Internet. POL unlocks that future. POL is a next-generation token that can power a vast ecosystem of ZK-based L2 chains.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/gmrsu0ZqLz \u2014 Polygon (Labs) (@0xPolygonLabs) October 25, 2023\n\nBased on blockchain records, the creation of the new token occurred on October 25 at 9:06 am UTC. The official name of the token is the \u201cPolygon Ecosystem Token.\u201d In their announcement, the Polygon team stated that POL will energize an extensive ecosystem of Layer 2 chains based on zero-knowledge technology. This shall happen through the implementation of a \u201cre-staking protocol\u201d that enables token holders to stake POL on multiple chains, facilitating various functions simultaneously.\n\nPolygon Labs\u2019 Push for POL Token\n\nBack in September, Polygon commenced the transition from MATIC to the POL token, initiating this process with the introduction of three Polygon Improvement Proposals (PIPs). PIP-18, in its Phase 0, laid the foundation for an extensive network of interconnected Layer 2 chains driven by zero-knowledge technology, with the aim of scaling Ethereum to the magnitude of the Internet.\n\nThe POL upgrade also looks towards facilitating the forthcoming milestones outlined in the Polygon 2.0 roadmap. This further includes the launch of a new staking layer designed to empower Polygon L2, the upgrade of Polygon PoS to zkRollup. Additionally, it includes the implementation of advanced interoperability and shared liquidity protocol, all harnessed by zero-knowledge technology.\n\nThe team has underscored that, as of now, the POL token is not in use within any Polygon network systems. Stakeholders continue to engage in staking activities through the traditional MATIC token on both Polygon PoS and Polygon zkEVM. Also, the settlement of gas fees on the PoS network shall happen using MATIC. Therefore, there is currently no requirement for users, validators, or application developers to convert their MATIC holdings into POL."

Some members of the mining communities who cannot profit from Ethereum\u2019s new protocol support EthereumPoW.\n\nThe native token of the blockchain, ETHW, can be used to buy products and services from decentralised applications (dApps) created on the platform. The token is also useful to cover network transaction costs and receive rewards for mining to secure the protocol.\n\nInfo On Project\n\nEthereum switched from a so-called proof-of-work system to a proof-of-stake mechanism to conserve energy and secure the network. However, a section of the blockchain\u2019s legacy computing operations declined to take part in the software update known as the Merge.\n\nA team of miners led by Chandler Guo opposed Ethereum\u2019s transition to a more energy-efficient network security method, claiming that Ethereum 2.0 will make crypto miners obsolete. Guo is a seasoned Ether miner and major supporter of Ethereum Classic, another PoW fork of Ethereum.\n\nHolders of ETHPoW are certain that the coin and its ecosystem will stay out of any legal trouble the new Ethereum will encounter. According to Gary Gensler of the SEC, the staking features of the latest version of Ethereum could qualify it as a security under the Howey Test.\n\nFor now, only a few exchanges support ETHW, the native token for the EthereumPoW network. On these exchanges, individuals can trade, and the token is offered for spot trading on platforms like FTX, ByBit, Kraken, and BitMart.\n\nAlong with the mainnet launch, the EthereumPoW team sent an update advising users of some adjustments and updates. There have been more than 1.7 billion transactions since the launch. Also, the total number of addresses holding ETHW now stands at about 254 million.\n\nUse Cases\n\nMany projects have declared support for the EthereumPOW network since its introduction. Uniswap V3, MetaMask, DefiEdge, other decentralised wallets, decentralised exchanges, and other Web3 systems are some of these projects.\n\n.\n\nMining pools that had previously mined on other networks when Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake algorithm have now started mining ETHW. With the mining pool accounting for 41.7% of the known hash rate, F2pool and others have begun directing resources toward the token.\n\nHow Does EthereumPoW Work?\n\nA few hours after Ethereum successfully migrated to the PoS consensus method algorithm, anonymous developers forked the Eth blockchain and introduced the EthereumPoW token. It utilises the Proof-of-Work mechanism (mining) and functions similarly to how Ethereum did previously.\n\nThe underlying algorithm used by proof-of-work blockchains determines mining operations\u2019 rules and difficulty level. The \u201cwork\u201d itself is mining. It involves adding legitimate blocks to the chain. Computers must solve cryptographic puzzles as proof of work to be compensated with the capacity to validate blockchain transactions. It\u2019s similar to competition and is known as bitcoin mining. It operates on the concept that one can fend off a malicious attack and confirm the authenticity of a transaction by using a lengthy string of letters and numbers, known as hashes.\n\nThe proof-of-work algorithm that Ethereum\u2019s mainnet has used since its creation will be maintained in ETHPoW. Although the scheduled difficulty bomb was intended to make it impossible to mine on the PoW chain, ETHPoW has continued to be mined by mining pools.\n\nThe ETHPoW fork, which has a similar transaction background as the main Ethereum network, will begin producing its blocks upon activation of the Merge upgrade. The pre-Merge state of the Ethereum network acts as the initiation point for the PoW merge, meaning all token smart contracts and balances will also be brought over.\n\nTherefore, everyone who now has ETH on-chain will end up with an identical amount of ETHW on the ETHPoW chain. Only the PoW fork will have native ETHW, a completely distinct asset from the original Ethereum token (ETH).\n\nWith ETHW originally forking the Ethereum blockchain, the chain would start with the same circulating supply as proof-of-stake Ethereum. The currency supply of the two chains would diverge, though, because the post-Merge Ethereum will have a considerably lower inflation rate than its current PoW version. As a result, the supply of EthereumPoW will increase more quickly than Ethereum on PoS if mining continues.\n\nIs ETHW a Good Investment?\n\nThe creation of ETHW by the community ensured that miners could continue to operate and prevent it from becoming outdated. Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin claimed that those promoting the hard fork are only \u201ctrying to make a quick buck.\u201d However, some notable personalities in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, like Justin Sun and Chandler Guo, have expressed support for the fork chain.\n\nBefore making an ETHW investment, keep the following in mind:\n\nSpeculative Value: Reputable crypto projects have backed the new PoS chain and the Ethereum Foundation. While ETHW is not yet widely accepted like the classic Ethereum, several projects already support the chain, which could lead to more value increases.\n\nReputable crypto projects have backed the new PoS chain and the Ethereum Foundation. While ETHW is not yet widely accepted like the classic Ethereum, several projects already support the chain, which could lead to more value increases. Volatility: Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization; this liquidity promotes a stable market. The market value and trading volume of ETHW are much lower. Any coin with a low trading volume is vulnerable to manipulating the market and experiencing higher volatility.\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization; this liquidity promotes a stable market. The market value and trading volume of ETHW are much lower. Any coin with a low trading volume is vulnerable to manipulating the market and experiencing higher volatility. Exchange Listings: Digital assets are listed on exchanges according to their demand and security. If coins and tokens are regarded as secure and make money from heavy trade, they are more likely to stay listed. However, the exchange may delist the asset if the trading activity falls below a necessary profit margin. However, ETHW is currently tradable on several crypto exchanges, including Kraken, FTX, Poloniex, Gate.io, MEXC, Huobi, etc. This shows there is a growing demand for the digital asset.\n\nHow to Buy EthereumPOW on Kraken\n\nInvestors\u2019 interest in buying EthereumPOW will continue to rise as more people understand how it works. Buying ETHW is straightforward and can be completed with these few steps:\n\nRegister an Account\n\nFirst, users should visit the Kraken site, click \u201cCreate Account,\u201d and register by providing a username, email address, and password. Next, click on the verification email sent as part of the registration process.\n\nVerify\n\nOnce users have signed up, they must go through account verification in adherence to the platform\u2019s KYC requirements. For example, to get \u201cStarter Level\u201d verification status, a trader will need to provide a name, email address, physical address, and phone number.\n\nThe \u201cStarter\u201d verification procedure is automated and normally takes less than one hour.\n\nOnce traders are verified, they can access the overview section of their trading dashboard to click on \u201cBuy\u201d to make their first crypto purchase. First, however, they will have to fund their account before they can buy any digital asset.\n\nDeposit Funds\n\nTraders can fund their Kraken account using a credit or debit card, bank account, and cryptos.\n\nThe navigation bar lets traders move between features on the Kraken account dashboard. Traders must click \u201cfunding\u201d to make a deposit into their account and select their preferred payment method.\n\nBuy ETHW\n\nCustomers should return to the website and place their first order after receiving notification from Kraken that their cash has arrived. Select \u201cTrade\u201d then click \u201cNew Order\u201d from the menu. Users can create customised orders by choosing \u201cSimple\u201d or \u201cAdvanced.\u201d\n\nOnly two input fields are available for users if they select the \u201cSimple\u201d option: volume and Amount. Purchasing cryptocurrency at market value is the simplest method. Enter the desired amount for buying the \u201cETHW/USD\u201d pair. An estimate of the total cost of the order is shown on the right side of the page.\n\nEthereumPOW FAQs\n\nWill Coinbase support ETHW?\n\nETHW is not supported by Coinbase right now. However, the crypto exchange stated that following The Merge, if an ETH PoW fork occurs, this asset will be reviewed with the same scrutiny as any other asset listed on their exchange. Therefore, there might still be future support for the digital asset.\n\nWhat is Ethereum PoW?\n\nEthereumPoW is a clone of the proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain used by the Ethereum network before switching to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. The mining communities that cannot profit from Ethereum\u2019s new protocol support EthereumPoW because it preserves the functionality of the Ethereum network before its switch to PoS.\n\nCan you mine proof-of-stake?\n\nProof of stake cannot be mined. For proof of stake, validators are chosen at random to verify blocks of information and confirm transactions. Instead of employing a competitive rewards-based approach like proof-of-work, this system randomly selects who is eligible to receive fees. Proof-of-stake blockchains enable networks to run with significantly reduced resource consumption since they do not require miners to expend electricity on redundant processes (competing to solve the same puzzle).\n\nWhich coins use proof-of-stake?\n\nProof-of-stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism for blockchain networks, and some coins that use this mechanism include Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Tezos (XTZ), Algorand (ALGO), etc."

        "content": "Circle Set to Launch USDC Stablecoin on Ethereum Scaling Solution Arbitrum \u2013 Stablecoin Adoption on the Rise?\n\nSource; Arbitrum Foundation\n\nCircle, the US-based payments firm which issues the USD coin (USDC) stablecoin, is set to launch its coin natively on Arbitrum, an Ethereum (ETH) scaling solution, with the kick off scheduled for June 8.\n\nIn a statement released on June 1, Arbitrum Foundation said that USDC issued by Circle is to be native to Arbitrum.\n\n\u201cThis will be the official version of USDC that is recognized within the Arbitrum ecosystem, and will ultimately replace the currently circulating bridged version of USDC that comes from Ethereum,\u201d according to the entity\u2019s statement.\n\nArbitrum Foundation named a number of benefits that it believes will be generated by the forthcoming launch and the resulting native USDC on Arbitrum. Among others, the token will be:\n\nfully reserved and always redeemable in the ratio of 1:1 per US dollar;\n\nenabled with institutional on/off ramps via Circle as well as other partners;\n\nbacked by forthcoming support by Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (#CCTP) to eliminate bridge withdrawal delays;\n\nsupported by an upgradeable smart contract for future enhancements by Circle.\n\n\u201cAhead of the launch of native USDC on June 8th, Arbitrum will be renaming the Ethereum-bridged version of USDC on block explorers as \u201cUSDC.e\u201d. There will also be outreach to ecosystem apps to make the same change in their app UI and documentation,\u201d Arbitrum Foundation said.\n\nClose cooperation with ecosystem apps\n\nAccording to the entity, the team behind Arbitrum will be closely collaborating with ecosystem apps in a bid to ensure \u201ca smooth transition of liquidity from bridged USDC to native USDC over time. There will be no immediate changes to the Arbitrum Bridge, and it will continue to operate normally for bridging USDC to and from Ethereum.\u201d\n\nIn addition to this, as part of the latest project, Circle plans to bring the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol to Arbitrum following the scheduled launch of the native USDC.\n\n\u201cUpon integration into the Arbitrum Bridge, this will enable USDC to move natively to-and-from Ethereum (and other supported chains) in minutes \u2014 no more withdrawal delays,\u201d according to the foundation.\n\nOn March 16, the foundation said in a statement that the day marked \u201cthe launch of The Arbitrum Foundation and DAO Governance for the Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova networks. Arbitrum has become the first EVM rollup technology to achieve the second stage of decentralization.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Arbitrum token will put governance power in the hands of the DAO. 12.75% of the $ARB token supply will be airdropped on March 23,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\n\n"

Ethereum price was not spared, as it encountered headwinds, sliding below support/resistance at $1,800 to trade 1.3% lower on the day to $1,773.\n\nThe total market value suffered a 2.1% dip to $1.29 trillion due to altcoins taking a major hit. For instance, Solana is down 6.4% to $31, Chainlink is down 5.2% to $10.53 while Bitcoin Cash dodders at $243 after its market value fell 5.1% in 24 hours.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAre Ethereum Price Dips Profitable?\n\nThe first major dip since the uptrend started early last week has many analysts and investors wondering if dips could turn profitable. Analysts like Rekt Capital believe that dips offer investors opportunities to fill their bags as the bull run continues. Altcoins in particular are expected to have bursts of bullish moments and considerable corrections.\n\nAltcoin Sherpa, a renowned trader and analyst shared a similar sentiment earlier today asking investors \u201cto be cognizant about what the start of a really strong rally looks like.\u201d\n\nAlthough I always try to preach patience, you also need to be cognizant about what the start of a really strong rally looks like. I'm not saying this is anything close to 2021 but it's still good to note what this spark looks like Check $LUNA $AVAX: no pullbacks, just big moves pic.twitter.com/ay5he7KQac \u2014 Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) October 26, 2023\n\nHe added in another post on Twitter (now X) that there was the likelihood of altcoins correcting by between 10-20%. \u201cI think that is still possible and valid,\u201d he added.\n\nI'm still waiting for alts to pull back 10-20%, I think that is still possible and valid. And before anyone says I'm sidelined, I'm always fucking max long and have the majority of my networth in crypto. It's been that way since I went full time and I don't expect it to change. \u2014 Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) October 26, 2023\n\nETH Price Prediction: Is $2,000 Next?\n\nEthereum started the rally by capitalizing on a double-bottom pattern with support roughly at $1,545. Subsequent steps above key moving averages like the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (red), the 100-EMA (blue), and 200-EMA (purple).\n\nThe breakout from the double-bottom pattern targeted a 12.25% move to $1,958 but the pullback on Thursday saw Ethereum price abandon the uptrend at $1,868.\n\nIf support at the double-bottom pattern neckline holds, Ether would be in a position to make a stronger move, possibly above the coveted $2,000 blockade.\n\nThe position of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the overbought region despite Ethereum\u2019s correction from October highs, affirms the bullish outlook. In other words, bulls are likely to resume the uptrend as opposed to bears taking over and pushing for lower prices below $1,700.\n\nAll three moving averages, starting with the 200-day EMA at $1,711, the 100-day EMA at $1,648, and the 21-day EMA at $1,658 would be in line to absorb the selling pressure to give bulls a chance to push for another rebound.\n\nRelated Articles"

Read here.\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nThis marked a notable change, especially for low-fee layer-2 networks, which had seen consistent growth over the past year. These changes demonstrate the adaptability of the Ethereum ecosystem in response to evolving market dynamics.\n\nAnother key contributor was the decreased engagement in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), layer-2 networks, and even Telegram bots. NFTs experienced a substantial dip in their weekly trading volumes.\n\nNFT trading volumes dropped to levels not seen in two years. This shift is indicative of evolving trends and priorities within the cryptocurrency space. Telegram bots, which enjoyed a surge in popularity in the second quarter of the year, also witnessed a decline in activity as October began.\n\nEthereum Turns Inflationary Due to Reduced Gas Fees\n\nThe decrease in Ethereum gas fees had a big impact beyond just the cost of transactions. In September, Ethereum went from being in a deflationary state to an inflationary one, and this was mainly due to the lower gas fees.\n\nAdditionally, ETH experienced its lowest rate of \u201cburn,\u201d where only 7,084 ETH was used up, which was quite different from earlier times.\n\nEnhance Your Crypto Trading Skills With Our Legends\u2019 Trading Masterclass\n\nEmpower your crypto trading skills with our Legends Masterclass.

This gives some insight into what it means for Ethereum to move towards an inflationary model and how sustainable it might be in the long run."

        "title": "Proof of Stake networks experience historic low in staking yields - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The average staking yield of the top 35 stakable cryptocurrencies has reached a historic low due to the rising average stake rate among investors during the third quarter, according to a report from Staked, a non-custodial staking platform subsidiary of Kraken.\n\nThe average staking rate increase to a substantial 52.4% across proof-of-stake (PoS) networks led to a decline in the yield on these chains to 10.2%, the lowest ever rate.\n\nFor context, Ethereum (ETH), the largest PoS network, saw its Consensus layer yield drop to a low of 3.2% while the percentage of total supply staked assets increased to a record high of 22% during the third quarter. The decline was more pronounced in ETH\u2019s Execution layer, dropping to 1.3%, according to Staked.\n\n\u201cThe combination of a high stake rate, and transaction activity shifting from Mainnet (L1) to the various Ethereum Layer 2 networks (Ls), resulted in a Q3 staking yield of 4.5%, ETH\u2019s lowest on record.\u201d\n\nWhile Ethereum staking saw a notable surge, overall deposit activity significantly slowed during the three months. Staking deposits hit a low of 1,300 in September.\n\nStaking is vital in PoS networks as it helps improve their overall security. The process entails holding and locking a specific amount of cryptocurrency for a period to help facilitate the operations of a blockchain network, resulting in the receipt of rewards.\n\nPotential rewards have made this venture attractive to crypto investors, including institutional players seeking passive income from their digital asset holdings. Notably, FTX, despite its bankruptcy, staked $150 million in ETH and Solana tokens to generate additional revenue, a move aligned with its commitment to compensating its clients.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to know that staking activities have come under intensified regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) categorized the activity as securities in its legal action against the crypto exchange Coinbase and also imposed a $30 million fine on Kraken because it failed to register its staking product as a securities offering.\n\nMeanwhile, the staking yield has been on a downturn since it peaked at 15.4% in March last year. The decline in staking rewards has been steady across chains, except for two proof-of-stake networks, Polkadot (15.1%) and Cosmos (18.9%), which currently offer yields higher than 7.5%. This trend could have significant implications for both individual investors and the broader cryptocurrency market."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nPolygon Labs has taken a huge step toward realizing Polygon 2.0. The scaling technology firm has successfully launched smart contracts of the project\u2019s next-generation token, POL, on Ethereum.\n\nThe Polygon 2.0 roadmap entails a token switch from MATIC to POL.\n\nPOL Token Contracts Debut On Ethereum\n\nPolygon Labs revealed in an October 25 press release that the POL token has gone live on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nCrucially, POL is an upgrade from the MATIC token, which will be deprecated as part of the move. MATIC token holders will have roughly four years to transfer their holdings to the new token.\n\n\u201cToday marks a major milestone on the Polygon 2.0 journey toward building the Value Layer of the Internet. The upgrade to POL has been initiated on the Ethereum mainnet, after months of development, community consultation, and a successful testnet launch,\u201d Polygon Labs stated in the official announcement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolygon Labs first announced POL in July 2023, and it expects it to work as a multipurpose token and play a key role in the network\u2019s broader 2.0 upgrade.\n\nIn September, Polygon released three inaugural Polygon Improvement Proposals (PIPs) for community consideration and voting. The PIPs outline technical details for \u201cPhase 0, which includes a proposal for the transition and specifications that will see MATIC become POL.\n\nThe Polygon 2.0 vision paints a picture of multiple Polygon-based chains, bridges, and the implementation of privacy-enhancing zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to validate all transfers. POL, a next-generation hyperproductive token, will power all Polygon-based networks: the main Polygon blockchain, the Polygon zkEVM network, and various supernets.\n\nTo help secure all these layers, POL will reportedly allow users to stake their holdings across as many compatible chains as they want. This suggests that users start accruing protocol rewards and transaction fees on each staked chain as soon as they deposit their holdings.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that the POL token will not immediately replace MATIC despite the deployment on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nIs MATIC Set For Major Surge?\n\nIn terms of what comes next on the Polgyon 2.0 roadmap, Polygon has hinted at transitioning its proof-of-stake chain to a zkRollup as well as implementing a new ZK-powered interoperability and shared liquidity protocol for its multiple chains.\n\nIt is my pleasure to report that POL contracts are live on Ethereum mainnet! \ud83e\udd29\ud83d\udcab\n\n\n\nThe launch of POL is a major milestone on the Polygon 2.0 roadmap, but it\u2019s only the beginning. It paves the way for a number of upgrades, including launching a new staking layer to power Polygon\u2026 pic.twitter.com/9qdY6Bv5Lp \u2014 Mihailo Bjelic (@MihailoBjelic) October 25, 2023\n\nThe price of MATIC gained 25.3% in the last week, indicating investors are ready to snap up tokens with positive fundamental developments that promise increased use cases. The token is up 2.8% on the day, currently trading hands at $0.6456, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nMATIC is still down 77.92% from its December all-time high of $2.92, although the team has been consistently delivering the necessary updates and improvements to the Polygon network. It\u2019s worth noting that mainnet and protocol updates tend to cause bullish price action.\n\nInvestors will be closely monitoring the progress of the Polygon 2.0 roadmap following the launch of POL."

        "title": "Why Ethereum (ETH) Price Exploded Above $1840 This Week, and New Crypto Coins with 10x Potential - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Over the past few days, Ethereum\u2019s price shot up from its $1500-1600 price range up to over $1840. The question on everyone\u2019s minds these days and following months of sideways trading: could Ethereum and crypto be poised for a bullish market cycle and higher price levels? In this article, we\u2019ll discuss Ethereum\u2019s recent price increase, and discuss some of the possible reasons behind ETH\u2019s recent price uptick. This article will then also discuss some of the new crypto coins such as ApeMax that are eliciting interest from Ethereum holders and ETH whales.\n\nWhy Ethereum Price is Going Up:\n\nRecent news surrounding Bitcoin ETFs have led to a bullish upswing in crypto markets across the board, resulting in increased demand for Ethereum resulting in a price increase.\n\nSeveral third party analysts and media outlets, including Galaxy Digital research, have published findings predicting that Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency prices could experience further growth, further fueling bullish market sentiment and renewed interest in major crypto coins like ETH.\n\nCrypto whales have also been looking at altcoins including younger tokens such as ApeMax, now available at presale and which can be purchased by eligible buyers in Ethereum.\n\nAs Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap and the main chain used for smart contract related implementations, it is only natural that many are looking to Ethereum as the crypto market warms up.\n\nHow much has Ethereum price gone up by?\n\nEthereum\u2019s price rose by over 19% in just 5 days from $1,547 on October 19th to $1,841 on October 24th.\n\nThis is the first time ETH broke the $1,800 price threshold since August 2023,\n\nFollowing its sharp climb to $1841, Ethereum\u2019s price then dropped slightly to $1,777 and then bounced back above $1,790.\n\nAs ETH\u2019s price rose, another token, ApeMax, is also experiencing growth in its rapidly expanding presale, where buyers can acquire ApeMax by using Ethereum or other mainstream crypto tokens.\n\nSome attribute the slight price decline following the peak to many holders taking their gains by selling some of their tokens.\n\nHot New Crypto Coin Generating Buzz Amongst ETH Whales:\n\nApeMax is the world\u2019s first \u201cBoost-to-Earn\u201d crypto coin and a top new token garnering interest amongst Ethereum token holders and ETH whales. ApeMax shines with its unique new staking model referred to as \u201cboosting\u201d, a new decentralized protocol where stakers can earn by booting entities they like and potentially earn token rewards in a transparent manner.\n\nThe ApeMax presale is currently underway and open for a limited time only. During the ApeMax presale, interested eligible buyers can acquire ApeMax tokens at early presale rates, and also enjoy the exclusive Early Bird Loot Box discounts. ApeMax tokens can be purchased using a range of mainstream crypto coins including Ethereum but also BNB, USDT, USDC, BUSD, and Polygon (Matic).\n\n>> Visit the ApeMax Website to Learn More <<\n\nHow much has Ethereum grown over the years?\n\nEthereum (ETH) was launched on July 30, 2015. It had a pre-sale in mid-2014, during which the initial price per Ether (ETH) was set at about 31,529 ETH per 1 Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nETH\u2019s price in early August 2015 gravitated around $2.83, and climbed to a first peak in January 2018 when Ethereum\u2019s price soared to $1,448 before sliding back down to $25o levels.\n\nIn the 2021 crypto bull market, Ethereum rose to an all time high of $4,815 on the 9th of November 2021\n\nEarly 2022 saw ETH\u2019s price adopt a downwards trend in spite of momentary and short lived upswings and climbs.\n\nIn April 2023, ETH\u2019s price broke past the $2,000 threshold and peaked at $2,118 on the 17th of the same month.\n\nOver the past few weeks, ETH\u2019s price has been trading sideways below the $1,700 mark, and surpassed this threshold on October 24th amidst bullish market sentiment.\n\nOver the last few weeks, the ApeMax presale has been growing from strength to strength, attracting legions of ETH fans and crypto enthusiasts.\n\nWhy Ethereum (ETH) Price Exploded \u2013 Conclusion\n\nThe crypto market has been engulfed in a wave of optimism and excitement over the last few days as the price of Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies has experienced growth. Ethereum\u2019s price increase can be attributed to a number of factors, including optimistic news surrounding Bitcoin ETFs and the ensuing bullish market sentiment which it has awoken in the crypto markets. Moreover, increased demand for ETH, and growing interest in this smart contract enabling blockchain have also contributed to Ethereum\u2019s price increase as of late. While ETH experiences growth, other newer coins such as ApeMax have also been garnering buzz and attention, from Ethereum holders in particular, and the exclusive ApeMax presale has been rapidly expanding.\n\nAlthough the crypto market has been going up recently, it\u2019s vital to understand that cryptocurrencies have risks and can be subject to high levels of volatility, with potential price upswings and also sharp price decreases, even to zero in the case of some tokens. This article does not offer any financial advice. Prior to engaging in any crypto, it\u2019s paramount to comprehend and acknowledge these risks, and not to spend more than you can accept to part with. Furthermore, acquiring crypto might not be the right fit for everyone. Cetrian coins, such as ApeMax, have regional buying restrictions whereby individuals from certain countries may not purchase this token. The ineligible areas list comprises several countries such as the USA, Canada, and more. Please refer to the official ApeMax website for the full details.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "In the latest development, Polygon Labs has launched an Ethereum contract for its new POL token, intended to power the Polygon zkEVM layer-2 ecosystem.\n\nPOL token, \u2018a next-generation hyperproductive token\u2019, will eventually replace MATIC, Polygon\u2019s original staking and gas token, according to the October 25 announcement.\n\nThe POL token upgrade is now live on Ethereum mainnet.\n\n\n\nPolygon 2.0, released this summer, is a roadmap for scaling Ethereum to build the Value Layer of the Internet. POL unlocks that future.\n\n\n\nPOL is a next-generation token that can power a vast ecosystem of ZK-based L2 chains.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/gmrsu0ZqLz \u2014 Polygon (@0xPolygon) October 25, 2023\n\nHowever, Polygon emphasized that MATIC holders do not need to immediately swap their tokens for POL. MATIC will continue to be used for staking, transaction fees, and other operations on Polygon\u2019s proof-of-stake network.\n\nThe POL token will only be utilized once additional layer-2 networks launch on Polygon 2.0 next year.\n\nPOL token will boost the ecosystem of zk-based Layer 2 chains through Polygon\u2019s native re-staking protocol. The protocol allows POL holders to sail across various chains for various purposes, including sequencing, ZK proof generation, participation in data availability committees, etc.\n\nThe POL token was created on the Ethereum blockchain earlier today at 9:06 am UTC under the name \u201cPolygon Ecosystem Token.\u201d Polygon first unveiled plans for a new token and layer-2 ecosystem called Polygon 2.0 in June. At the time, specific details were not made available.\n\nLast month, the team revealed that a zero-knowledge proof-based network called the Polygon zkEVM would serve as the flagship layer-2 chain in Polygon 2.0.\n\nThe zkEVM will offer faster and cheaper transactions while ensuring a high degree of privacy and security.\n\nZero-knowledge proofs allow transactions to be validated without revealing any underlying data. Polygon believes this technology will greatly expand its layer-2 ecosystem while avoiding bottlenecks and congestion issues faced by rival platforms.\n\nThe launch of the POL token is a significant milestone along Polygon\u2019s roadmap for phasing in Polygon 2.0 over the coming year.\n\nOther planned upgrades include a new staking layer, transitioning the existing proof-of-stake chain to a zkEVM-based layer-2, and creating a modular liquidity protocol.\n\nPolygon Co-Founder Mihailo Bjelic stated that POL unlocks \u201can exponential increase in flexibility and modularity that will power Web3 to scale new heights.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), which managed to climb above the $34,000 mark yesterday, managed to hold on to its newfound high early Wednesday morning. However, Ethereum (ETH) lost its $1,800 mark and was found dwelling within the $1,700 range. It is usual to see a bout of dip in coin prices right after a sudden rally. Hence, most of the popular altcoins \u2014 including the likes of Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Litecoin (LTC) \u2014 saw minor dips across the board. Memecoin Pepe (PEPE), which was the biggest gainer on Tuesday, emerged to be the biggest loser of the lot, with a 24-hour dip of over 7 percent. The MINA token, on the other hand, became the biggest gainer, with a whopping 24-hour jump of over 50 percent.\n\nThe global crypto market cap stood at $1.25 trillion at the time of writing, registering a 24-hour dip of 1.67 percent.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Today\n\nBitcoin price stood at $34,016.72, registering a 24-hour dip of 1.40 percent, as per CoinMarketCap.

However, over the past 24 hours, prices settled at the $34,000 range as the ticker disappeared and then reappeared. This bullish upturn may also be attributed to Grayscale's legal victory against the US SEC after the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the SEC to reconsider its prior rejection of Grayscale's spot bitcoin ETF application. These developments have raised optimism among market participants, fueling expectations of an impending approval for Bitcoin spot ETF applications. Meanwhile, Ethereum has continued to trade above the $1,700 level.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin\u2019s breakaway from consolidation has been phenomenal with prices increasing to the levels of last year April. The increase in fund inflows and the short squeeze on the network last week added to the surge. The SEC\u2019s softening stance towards Crypto ETFs as per prominent institutional investors, has also ignited hopes of an early bull market which might be too soon to predict. Bitcoin\u2019s market dominance was prominent as key tokens such as Ether, Solana, etc. increased in price following BTC\u2019s price rally.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin's meteoric 10 percent rise this week to an all-time high of $35,900 has had a ripple effect on related stocks. MicroStrategy, known for its sizable bitcoin holdings, saw its shares rise a remarkable 12 percent, bringing unrealized bitcoin gains close to $1 billion. Coinbase shares rose 7.33 percent, reflecting the cryptocurrency's success. Bitcoin mining companies Riot Blockchain and Marathon Digital Holdings surged more than 10 percent and 12 percent, respectively, beating Bitcoin in both daily and year-to-date gains. Companies like Cipher Mining, Riot Platforms, and Bitfarms have exceeded 100 percent growth this year. This increase can be attributed to a variety of factors, including anticipation of a bitcoin halving event in 2024 and a legal ruling in favour of Grayscale's application for a bitcoin ETF, which was previously rejected by the SEC. This decision, reiterating the approval of the Bitcoin futures ETF, underscores the continued importance of Bitcoin in the financial landscape.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cOver the past 24 hours, both BTC and ETH have experienced approximately a 2 percent decline. This dip could be linked to the temporary removal of BlackRock's (BLK) spot Bitcoin ETF ticker, IBTC, from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation's (DTCC) website. However, it's important to note that the ticker was relisted after a few hours. The presence of the ticker on the DTCC site had led investors to speculate about the imminent approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, which contributed to BTC's significant surge from the $30,000 range to over $35,000.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

Operating on the Ethereum blockchain, this digital currency is designed to engage users in a unique way through staking, voting on meme polls, and earning rewards. As cryptocurrencies continue to gain popularity, more and more individuals are trying to join the action. While news and articles explain the basics of crypto, how it works, and market trends, they may not provide the valuable insights needed to truly understand the industry. Thankfully, thought leaders and crypto pioneers have taken to the internet to share market insights and perspectives with a global audience, helping both investors and those who plan to join the crypto space stay up-to-date on everything related to cryptocurrency.\n\nTop Crypto Influencers You Should Be Following on Social Media:\n\nTop Crypto Thought Leaders to Follow on Social Media\n\nCryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Dogecoin have become very popular lately due to a number of reasons.

Here, we\u2019re sharing some of the most notable websites and blogs that deliver updated information on all things blockchain and crypto, from updates to current issues.\n\nConsidered one of the oldest and most established sources of news on Bitcoin and blockchain technology, Bitcoin Magazine has been providing a global audience with analysis, research, and valuable crypto- and Bitcoin-related resources. It has established itself as a hub where thought leaders gather to share timely and relevant material on the crypto industry.\n\nOne of the great things about the website, aside from offering the latest news and updates, is that it lets you purchase Bitcoins, thanks to its partnership with Simplex. It also provides you with an avenue to earn Bitcoins via Carrot. The magazine likewise shares the latest news on business, culture, and events within a crypto context.\n\nRanking as one of the leading websites on crypto and blockchain technology, with more than 5.1 million unique visitors, CoinDesk features a variety of resources for both novices and pros.

But whether or not it will come to replace traditional assets still remains to be seen.\n\nAs crypto continues to grow, so too will its use cases, investors, supporters, and yes, even detractors. And while it has become hugely popular, enticing many to join and invest in crypto, there\u2019s a bigger barrier to entry that prevents many individuals to go right into it, and that\u2019s lack of knowledge.\n\nThere\u2019s a wealth of articles, guides, and reviews that cover almost every aspect imaginable when it comes to crypto and blockchain technology, giving them a more open, and thus, seemingly more accessible, air.\n\nHowever, this research highlighted that younger generations show significant interest in digital assets, but many face barriers to active participation in the cryptocurrency or NFT market due to insufficient knowledge and a lack of national and international market regulations that would improve investor trust and transaction security.\n\nAdditionally, a substantial portion of respondents cited security concerns, specifically data privacy, as a significant obstacle. Other barriers include government regulations, reservations about the technology itself, and strong habits involving the use of physical cash.\n\nOne of the best things you can do, whether you\u2019re a long-time crypto advocate or a novice, is to arm yourself with updated knowledge on crypto and blockchain technology to stay ahead of the game.\n\nLike any other financial and investment endeavor, delving into crypto can either make you more money or cause you to lose money. It\u2019s a gamble that may be worth taking, especially if you\u2019re looking to grow your assets and you\u2019re equipped with sufficient knowledge and insights from some of the industry\u2019s thought leaders.\n\nHave you ever tried going into crypto? Which digital currency did you invest in and who among these thought leaders have made an impact on your decisions?\n\nFrequently Asked Questions Who is the best crypto analyst? The best crypto analysts are Anthony Pompliano and Vitalik Buterin. Anthony is one of the most popular and iconic crypto analysts. Vitalik Buterin is the Ethereum co-founder and one of the world\u2019s youngest crypto billionaires. What is the best cryptocurrency to invest in 2024?

Meanwhile, altcoins like Binance Coin (BNB) and Cardano (ADA) witnessed more modest inflows, amounting to $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively. However, Ethereum (ETH) products reported outflows of $7.4 million. Persistent concerns revolving around Ethereum prompted a further withdrawal of $7.4 million, making Ethereum the sole altcoin experiencing outflows last week."

        "content": "Important news in the DeFi sector: the distribution of Polygon POL crypto contracts on the Ethereum main blockchain is imminent.\n\nLet\u2019s look at all the details and implications of this news below.\n\nPolygon\u2019s crucial role in Ethereum\u2019s scalability: crypto contracts\n\nAs expected, Polygon Labs recently implemented contracts for the next-generation crypto, POL, on the Ethereum main network, following a testnet implementation earlier this month.\n\nThis development follows the approval of a set of proposed improvements to the Polygon network in September, which outlined the specifications of the POL token.\n\nThis cryptocurrency represents an evolution of MATIC and is intended to be integrated into the architecture of the forthcoming update, Polygon 2.0.\n\nAmong the key proposals discussed were PIP-17, which will initiate the POL cryptocurrency upgrade, and PIP-19, which recommends the adoption of POL as the native proof-of-stake gas and staking currency for Polygon.\n\nAs a result, POL will become the primary cryptocurrency in the Polygon 2.0 ecosystem, supporting a range of zero-knowledge-based Layer 2 chains and providing features such as staking, governance and community engagement.\n\nPolygon Labs describes POL as a \u201chighly productive, next-generation token\u201d that powers a vast ecosystem of zero-knowledge Layer 2 chains.\n\nThis is achieved through a native re-staking protocol that allows POL holders to validate multiple chains and play different roles on each.\n\nThe POL token: a smooth transition to the core Polygon ecosystem\n\nAlthough the POL token has been deployed on the core network, there will be no immediate replacement of MATIC.\n\nIn fact, this process requires governance approval and is designed to be synchronised with the launch of the Polygon 2.0 update.\n\nThis final update will involve a number of key steps.\n\nThese include the release of a new staking layer to support Polygon\u2019s Layer 2 chains, the transition of Polygon\u2019s proof-of-stake to zkRollup, and the implementation of ZK-based interoperability and a common liquidity protocol for all Layer 2s, according to Polygon Labs.\n\nBinance supports native USDC on the Polygon network: convergence of finance and blockchain\n\nRecently, Binance announced its support for the native USD Coin (USDC) token on the Polygon (MATIC) network, marking a significant step towards the interaction between leading financial platforms and cutting-edge blockchain networks.\n\nThis development is important as Binance had initially supported the bridge version of USDC, known as USDC.e.\n\nTo differentiate between the two versions, the bridge version will now be referred to as MATICUSDCE on the platform.\n\nBinance has also planned separate announcements for the deposit and withdrawal processes for native USD coins on the Polygon network. However, it is important to note that these changes in the integration process may cause temporary disruptions.\n\nIn particular, deposit and withdrawal services for existing USDCs on the Polygon network were suspended on 25 October.\n\nIt is reassuring to note that this suspension did not affect other functionalities such as USDC spot trading, margin trading, futures trading, Binance Earn and Binance Pay services.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Binance\u2019s goal is to ensure a smooth user experience during this transition.\n\nThey have also assured users that deposits and withdrawals for the bridged USD coin, MATICUSDCE, will remain unchanged and can be made at any time."

It primarily serves the Ethereum trading community, but it also facilitates the trading of other cryptocurrencies with significant market capitalization. Ethereum Code, when used in conjunction with cryptocurrency trading, allows users to get better returns on their investments in Ether, Bitcoin, and other altcoins. It offers several advantages over a traditional cryptocurrency exchange, particularly as a result of its automated trading mechanism.\n\nThis robot offers short-selling of Ethereum equities, which allows you to profit from transactions by selling at a high price and buying at a low price, as opposed to long-selling. When the price of Ethereum falls, the Ethereum Code trading system may allow a trader to profit from the decline in value of the cryptocurrency. It can also result in profits for investors if the market\u2019s values rise and then fall again. Even though it may appear to be a fraud, this feature of the Ethereum Code trading system is actually a legitimate practice among cryptocurrency investors. It directs your investments at a dropping price index to purchase more digital money assets at reduced prices as the price index declines.\n\nIts trading mechanism is built around leveraged auto trading, which is a key component of the Ethereum Code program. It enables brokers or traders to get into the trading business with a small initial investment. Trading Ethereum tokens and expanding your place in the global crypto-investors circle can be accomplished with a small initial investment. Multiple trades can be executed concurrently, and the potential gains of each trade are magnified by the software. It also debunks every investment fraud that may or may not come your way while you\u2019re making a decision.\n\nEthereum Code: Legit or a Scam?\n\nOne of the greatest fear of users when using this robot is its legitimacy. Some have tried to prove that the Ethereum Code trading software is not legit. However, they do not have evidence to back up their allegations. According to our research, this robot seems to be a legit one. One of the factors proving its legitimacy is the features and services rendered by this robot. The Ethereum Code platform indeed analyzes market trends and notifies traders of trading signals, which helps investors to make profitable trades.\n\nAfter digging through tons of reviews online, we found a lot of users on online review platforms such as Trustpedia, dropping feedbacks on how they have benefitted from the platform. Although there are reviews on the Ethereum Code official websites, they seem to be exaggerated as the profits mentioned by users on the external sites are not as much as the ones mentioned on the platforms. So traders should not base their judgment on the reviews found on the site.\n\nEthereum Code Features\n\nRegistration\n\nThe registration process for the Ethereum code is relatively straightforward.

To be forced to wait so long for funds to arrive in your bank account may be extremely stressful and upsetting, especially when you\u2019re dealing with a substantial sum of money. We\u2019ve discovered that the withdrawal process for the Ethereum Code is exceptionally fast. After requesting a withdrawal, many consumers see their gains in their bank accounts within 24 hours of submitting their request.\n\nFees\n\nThe charging of registration fees is a typical method for trading bots to collect money from their users. There are no registration fees, broker fees, or any other hidden fees associated with Ethereum Code. The application retains only 1% of the revenues generated by its users in order to meet its operating costs.\n\nRisk level control Feature\n\nThe implications of this are that traders can choose the risk level that is most comfortable for them when trading in the bitcoin market, depending on their experience and competence. Traders should be aware of the amount of money they have available to invest.\n\nReverse trading feature\n\nThis cryptocurrency trading platform assists traders in reducing risk while also maximizing their returns through the use of algorithms. Apart from that, when a trade is on the losing side, this capability can be engaged, allowing the trader to change losing trades into winning trades by utilizing the functionality of reverse trading.\n\nAdvanced Technology\n\nModern technology and a complex algorithm are employed by this cryptocurrency trading bot to ensure that it is efficient in its trading operations.

Ethereum Code is the tool to use if you want to trade with more precision.\n\nWorthy Tips for Beginners to Make Positive Returns Using Bitcoin Robots\n\nBegin with a small budget\n\nStarting with a small amount of money and working your way up is the best advice. Begin with the bare minimum ($250) and gradually increase your investment. Even if you have prior trading experience, it is recommended that you avoid investing large quantities of money immediately soon. It is impossible to predict the future of the markets, and you will never be able to control them no matter who you are or what you do. As a result, start small and gradually increase your dedication over time; there\u2019s no need to rush into anything.\n\nProfits should be set aside for a rainy day\n\nYou should set aside a percentage of your earnings once you start earning money for future usage or investment. You should try to recoup as much of your initial investment as possible while keeping your account cash flow positive at all times. Because every cent in your account is profit, you will eventually reach a position of perfect security with no risk.\n\nLet go of your Ego\n\nMake a point of remaining humble and accepting the fact that no matter what you do, you will never be a successful trader; in fact, no one will ever be a successful trader. Even the most successful traders, regardless of their level of success, make catastrophic mistakes regularly. This rule applies to traders as well. They can only keep their position by winning a few games. Likewise, keep in mind that you are no better than anyone else, and that, in the end, the market selects what is best.\n\nAlways seek to Learn\n\nYou should continue to seek out fresh information and expertise whenever and wherever you get the chance if you have the opportunity. If you want to excel at Bitcoin trading, find many well-known brokers and follow their advice. You can also participate in online communities and forums where you can discuss trade and financial theory with other individuals. Others, such as successful traders who post videos on YouTube and others who tweet daily advice and even describe the trades they made that day, are available to listen to and learn from. Always remember that you should continue to learn new things.\n\nWhy are Bitcoin Robots Profitable?\n\nTrading at any time of day or night\n\nBots can trade at any hour of the day or night. Because the bitcoin market is active 24 hours a day, you may be able to make money even while you sleep. Trading manually can be time-consuming; however, employing an auto-trader reduces this burden by continuously performing all of the heavy liftings.\n\nAccuracy\n\nThis functionality allows it to receive data and process it in order to generate predictions, which users can then choose to act on if they so wish. The user, on his or her part, must supply the appropriate commands and tactics for the bots to follow.\n\nEfficiency\n\nBitcoin robots are profitable because they are incredibly efficient at leveraging exchange tools and methods, such as trailing stops and buying and selling based on crypto signals.\n\nMarket access is available 24/7\n\nAnother element that contributes to trading bots\u2019 profitability is the ability to have access to the cryptocurrency market at any time of day or night, as well as a consistent stream of profits. This is impossible to achieve if you trade cryptocurrency manually.\n\nMarket access is available around the clock\n\nYou can program your bot to perform even more difficult tasks for you, such as arbitrage and accumulation if you have a solid technological background.\n\nPossible Risks when Trading with Ethereum Code\n\nVolatility\n\nPeople who do not put in enough effort to understand how the system works are one of the numerous reasons why they fail at trading. As a result, they make a big number of investments and lose a lot of money, which is just one of the numerous reasons why people fail at trading. Keep in mind that the Bitcoin market is extremely unpredictable and that investing a substantial sum of money without fully understanding the risks entails taking a significant chance of losing your money.\n\nLesser Autonomy\n\nWhen you convert to automated trading, you effectively give up the ability to trade on your own time, at your discretion, and with your judgment. Because of the current status of the bitcoin market, your cryptocurrency charts may respond unexpectedly. As a result, you won\u2019t be able to control your need to enter or exit the market based on current market analysis until at least the middle of the trade. As a result, it\u2019s even more important to ensure that your initial analysis is accurate in light of these new events.\n\nDoes Ethereum Code Have an App?\n\nYes, Ethereum Code has a desktop program that allows you to keep track of your trades and register them. For now, you cannot download a mobile application for Android or iOS devices. But you can access it through browsers on your smartphone.\n\nHas Ethereum Code Been Featured on the Media or Endorsed by a Celebrity?\n\nEthereum Code Reddit Ethereum Code has allegedly been featured on multiple television shows, according to numerous public discussions on Reddit. Because Ethereum Code has not made any such information publicly available, there is no proof to back up their claims. The shows mentioned above are well-known television shows that would have acquired global notice instantly if they had utilized the Ethereum Code platform.\n\nEthereum Code Trustpilot Trustpilot has a huge number of Ethereum Code reviews in a variety of languages. The Ethereum Code App has received a lot of positive feedback on Trustpilot. This is one of the strongest proof of the site\u2019s legitimacy.\n\nEthereum Code Elon Musk Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla Inc. and SpaceX has allegedly endorsed the Ethereum Code software. This, however, is not true. One of the things that blow people away when they hear this false claim is because Elon Musk has invested in cryptocurrency. This is true, but he has never endorsed or invested in any crypto system such as Ethereum Code.\n\nEthereum Code Martin Lewis Martin Lewis of Money Saving Expert has previously sued Facebook for advertisements claiming he has made a fortune from bitcoin investments made through the Ethereum Code exchange. Martin voiced his annoyance with his name and photograph being used without his consent \u201cI don\u2019t do advertisements or anything like that. Any advertisement that uses my image or name is done without my permission.\u201d\n\nEthereum Code Dragons Den Some have peddled rumours about Ethereum Code being featured in the Dragons Den episodes. Truly there were episodes about cryptocurrency, but there was never an episode about any Bitcoin robot especially Ethereum Code.\n\nEthereum Code Review: Our Conclusion\n\nWhen using this platform, the crypto trading algorithm automatically monitors the crypto market, performs technical analysis, and places price quotations and trade orders more quickly than a human trader would. Furthermore, the Ethereum Code trading bot is simple to use and extremely user friendly, allowing the trader to set up the trading session by incorporating their trading strategy and other trading parameters within minutes of downloading and installing the bot. However, we recommend traders be careful in trading with the Ethereum Code app as crypto trading carries risk.\n\nTop 3 Alternative Bitcoin Robots:\n\nALSO READ:\n\n\u2013 Ekrona Cryptocurrency Review\n\n\u2013 Profit Secret App\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin Code Platform\n\nFAQs"
