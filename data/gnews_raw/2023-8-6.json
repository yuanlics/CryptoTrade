They will also be able to fund purchases with PayPal USD.\n\nThe stablecoin will be available starting Monday, and PayPal customers will be able to purchase, send, convert and fund purchases in the \u201ccoming weeks.\u201d\n\nThe announcement marks the first time that a major US financial company has created a stablecoin.

PayPal began integrating crypto services in early 2021, allowing users to buy, sell and hold major digital assets like bitcoin and ether.\n\n\u201cThe shift toward digital currencies requires a stable instrument that is both digitally native and easily connected to fiat currency like the U.S. dollar,\u201d said Dan Schulman, PayPal\u2019s president and CEO.\n\nPaxos will be in charge of publishing a monthly Reserve Report on the stablecoin, as well as an \u201cattestation of the value of PayPal USD reserve assets.\u201d PayPal said the stablecoin will be \u201cfully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, US Treasuries and similar cash equivalents.\u201d\n\n\u201cPayPal USD is the most significant leap forward for digital assets and the financial industry and Paxos is proud to enable this transformative product,\u201d Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla said in a statement.\n\nA blockchain-based digital asset, PayPal USD will be issued on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token.\n\n\u201cOur commitment to responsible innovation and compliance, and our track record delivering new experiences to our customers, provides the foundation necessary to contribute to the growth of digital payments through PayPal USD,\u201d said Schulman.\n\n\u201cClear regulations and robust consumer protections are essential to enabling stablecoins to achieve their full potential.

Volatility Shares moved to do so on July 28 and sparked several funds to apply for Ether-related ETFs last week.\n\nA post-effective adjustment to an existing open-end fund or investment trust can take up to 60 days to take effect, while a new open-end fund may do so in 75 days under SEC Rule 485(a).\n\nAlthough the Valkyrie file puts it ahead of rivals in terms of its anticipated debut date, the SEC is not required by law to adhere to anyone's schedule. No matter which deadline might have put someone first, the SEC could approve all Ether-related ETFs on the same day."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAn anonymous individual using the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) pseudonym \u201cnd4.eth\u201d recently sent a substantial 2,500 ETH, equating to roughly $4.5 million, to a burn address. This incident, which transpired on July 26, has captivated the cryptocurrency community, prompting many to ponder the rationale behind this significant burn.\n\nThe occurrence came to light on August 6 when \u201cdegeneratewisdom\u201d, a blockchain analyst, tweeted the query: \u201cCan anyone on here explain this tx to me Looks like nd4.eth sent 2500 ETH to a dead address. Doesn\u2019t look like a noob error either. Thoughts?\u201d\n\nThis tweet thrust nd4.eth\u2019s substantial 2500 ETH transfer to an inactive address into the spotlight, prompting speculation within the crypto community about the underlying intention behind this deliberate and seemingly calculated move.\n\nThe concept of \u201cburning\u201d tokens entails sending tokens to an address where they are rendered permanently unspendable, thereby diminishing the overall supply of the specific cryptocurrency. However, the reasoning behind nd4.eth\u2019s decision to annihilate such a sizable sum of Ethereum remains veiled in obscurity.\n\nLaurence Day, the innovator behind the Wildcat Protocol, infused an element of humour into the situation, tweeting, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t arise this morning and express gratitude to nd4.eth for contributing to the ultrasound money narrative, I urge you to engage in profound introspection regarding your objectives.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDelving deeper into the incident, analysts from the on-chain analysis company Lookonchain disclosed additional particulars about the persona behind nd4.eth.\n\n\u201cThe guy who transferred 2,500 $ETH($4.58M) to a dead address on July 26th is a whale with 34,287 $GMX($1.84M) and 311,003 $GNS($1.43M). He spent 5,330 $DAI to buy $GMX and $GNS on July 29 and also transferred 34.9 $GMX ($1,989) and 600 $GNX ($2,733) to the dead address,\u201d Lookonchain wrote on Monday.\n\nWhile the exact motives of the address owner are still unknown, accidentally sending crypto or NFTs to a burn address has occurred before, albeit occasionally. Last March, an NFT collector called Brandon Riley accidentally sent his CryptoPunk #685, purchased for 77 ETH ($129,437), to a burn address while attempting to wrap it for trading on NFTfi. The irreversible error wiped out a third of Riley\u2019s net worth. Although unrecoverable, Riley\u2019s CryptoPunk was \u201cresurrected\u201d as a Bitcoin ordinal on the blockchain.\n\nLast September, cryptocurrency exchange Kucoin accidentally sent a substantial amount of Ethereum (ETH), valued at tens of millions of dollars, to the Ethereum burn address. This unexpected move, spanning over three days and involving more than 3,500 USDT and ETH transactions, left the cryptocurrency community puzzled with the exact motive behind this burn remaining unknown."

        "content": "In a move signaling the significant shift towards digital currencies, PayPal has announced the launch of its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin \u2013 PayPal USD (PYUSD).\n\nThis development, announced by PayPal directly, adds a new dimension to the emerging potential of regulated, fully-backed stablecoins in transforming payments in digitally native environments like web3.\n\nIn a prepared statement, Paxos CEO and cofounder Charles Cascarilla said:\n\n\u201cWith the launch of the first stablecoin by a leading financial institution, PayPal and Paxos are proving the real-world value of blockchain technology. PayPal USD is the most significant leap forward for digital assets and the financial industry and Paxos is proud to enable this transformative product.\u201d\n\nThe news comes after progress on the project was said to have stalled in February. A company representative told Bloomberg then, \u201cWe are exploring a stablecoin\u2026If and when we seek to move forward, we will, of course, work closely with relevant regulators.\u201d\n\nWhat is PYUSD? PayPal USD\n\nPYUSD is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, U.S. Treasuries, and similar cash equivalents, providing a one-to-one redemption for U.S. dollars. Further, the company confirmed that the stablecoin will be available for U.S. customers.\n\nAdditionally, according to the terms listed in the announcement, it appears that PYUSD may become the native token of PayPal\u2019s crypto service with no \u201cspread\u201d charged on the swaps.\n\n\u201cWhen you buy or sell cryptocurrency, including when you check out with crypto, we will disclose an exchange rate and any fees you will be charged for that transaction. For currencies other than PayPal USD, the exchange rate includes a spread that PayPal earns on each purchase and sale. PayPal USD is not available in Hawaii.\u201d\n\nAcknowledging the need for a stable, digitally native instrument easily connected to fiat currency, Dan Schulman, President and CEO of PayPal, expressed the company\u2019s commitment to innovation and compliance,\n\n\u201cOur track record delivering new experiences to our customers provides the foundation necessary to contribute to the growth of digital payments through PayPal USD.\u201d\n\nAs an ERC-20 token issued on the Ethereum blockchain, PayPal USD aims to seamlessly bridge the gap between fiat and digital currencies for consumers, merchants, and developers.\n\nThe new stablecoin is expected to facilitate fast transfers of value, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and support global brands\u2019 continued expansion into digital assets. Moreover, PayPal USD will be compatible with web3-specific environments, with plans for availability on Venmo shortly.\n\nPYUSD issuance and transparency\n\nThe issuance of PayPal USD is overseen by Paxos Trust Company, a fully licensed limited-purpose trust company, subject to regulatory oversight by the New York State Department of Financial Services. This regulatory oversight ensures that reserves for PayPal USD are fully backed and that the stablecoin can be bought or sold through PayPal at a rate of $1.00 per PYUSD.\n\nPaxos intends to further enhance transparency by publishing a public monthly Reserve Report for PayPal USD outlining the instruments composing the reserves, starting September 2023.\n\nThis report will be complemented by a public third-party attestation of the value of PayPal USD reserve assets issued by an independent accounting firm by the standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).\n\nIn addition to offering a range of services that add utility to digital currencies, the company stated that it is committed to increasing consumer and merchant comprehension of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), while actively engaging with regulators as the industry evolves.\n\nAs the digital payment revolution progresses, PayPal\u2019s new stablecoin marks a significant stride toward a more integrated digital economy.\n\nMentioned in this article"

The true reasons behind such a bold move remain elusive, leaving analysts and observers grappling for answers.\n\nDespite the perplexity surrounding the situation, some in the community took a more lighthearted approach, even commending the individual for effectively reducing the supply of Ethereum. They saw it as an alignment with the narrative of \u201cEthereum\u2019s Ultrasound Money,\u201d a playfully embraced concept among enthusiasts.\n\nLaurence Day, the creative mind behind Wildcat Protocol, humorously commented, urging everyone to extend gratitude to nd4.eth for contributing to the \u201cultrasound money\u201d narrative. This tongue-in-cheek response reflects the community\u2019s diverse perspectives on the unexpected act.\n\nOn-Chain Analysts Uncover Big Holdings in nd4.eth\u2019s Wallet\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the term, \u201cburning\u201d refers to the permanent removal of tokens from circulation. In this particular case, the tokens were sent to the designated address, 0xdea\u2026069, where they will forever remain out of reach.\n\nDelving into the identity of the enigmatic nd4.eth, on-chain analysts at Lookonchain discovered that this individual is currently a major holder of tokens from perpetual trading protocols. Holding an impressive 34,287 GMX tokens valued at $1.84 million and 311,003 Gains tokens worth $1.43 million, nd4.eth\u2019s influence within the crypto market is undeniable.\n\nThe intriguing saga does not end there, as nd4.eth also sent an additional 1.5 ETH, 34.9 GMX, and 600 GNS, which collectively amount to roughly $7,000, to the same burning address. These actions have only deepened the mystery surrounding the motives of this crypto enigma.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nThere is a chance that the transfer of 2,500 ether to a burn address could be a marketing stunt , aimed at manipulating Ethereum\u2019s market sentiment.\n\nThe on-chain analysis provided by Lookonchain are not sufficient enough to draw definitive conclusions about the motivations of nd4.eth.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe recent act of sending 2,500 ether, equivalent to a substantial $4.5 million, to a burn address by an unknown individual has provoked both curiosity and contemplation within the community. This action defies conventional logic, compelling us to contemplate the intricate motivations that drive such an extravagant renouncement of value within the cryptoverse.\n\nTo learn more about the Terra Classic Revival Whitepaper progress, read here:\n\nUSTC Team Shares Terra Classic Revival White Paper Progress\n\nTo delve into the startling data revealing 97 crypto funds collapsing this year, read here:\n\nStartling Data Shows 97 Crypto Funds Have Collapsed This Year"

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin (BTC) recent price action has investors skeptical about altcoins, as its continued slump continues to harm the cryptocurrency market. This is best seen in Ethereum (ETH) price, which continues to slide south. The same is illustrated by Ripple (XRP) price, whose bulls are actively losing to the bears and losing the ground covered in the June 13 rally.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin\u2019s quarterly chart simplifies confusion, 15% crash likely before $40,000, $50,000, or new all-time high\n\nOpen Interest, funding rate FAQs How does Open Interest affect cryptocurrency prices? Higher Open Interest is associated with higher liquidity and new capital inflow to the market. This is considered the equivalent of increase in efficiency and the ongoing trend continues. When Open Interest decreases, it is considered a sign of liquidation in the market, investors are leaving and the overall demand for an asset is on a decline, fueling a bearish sentiment among investors. How does Funding rate affect cryptocurrency prices? Funding fees bridge the difference between spot prices and prices of futures contracts of an asset by increasing liquidation risks faced by traders. A consistently high and positive funding rate implies there is a bullish sentiment among market participants and there is an expectation of a price hike. A consistently negative funding rate for an asset implies a bearish sentiment, indicating that traders expect the cryptocurrency\u2019s price to fall and a bearish trend reversal is likely to occur.\n\nBitcoin price delays the inevitable\n\nBitcoin (BTC) action shows intense strife between bulls and bears as both extremes pull for dominance. The red and green candlesticks on the four-hour chart below point to this fact. Amid this volatility, experts predict BTC to run back to the $30,400 range this week before a potential drop down to the $27,300 and $26,300 levels.\n\nAs buying pressure increases from the bullish breaker, Bitcoin price could ascend, potentially breaching the 50-, 100- and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) at $29,169, $29,339, and $29,438 levels, respectively. For the layperson, a bullish breaker is a failed demand or supply zone (demand zone in this case).\n\nFurther north, and with the Fair Value Gap (FVG) creating an imbalance that has to be filled, Bitcoin price could extend north to test this region at around the $30,400 level before a possible retracement. Such a move would constitute a 5% climb above the press time market value of $28,977. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) supports this outlook, tipping north to show rising momentum.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nConversely, if seller momentum outweighs bullish effort, Bitcoin price could continue south, with a decisive flip of the $28,706 support level into a resistance invalidating the optimistic outlook. If such an outcome prevails, BTC could extend south, possibly tagging the $27,300 support level, or in the dire case, extend a leg south to the $26,300 level. This would constitute a 10% slump.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin halving cycles show a weakening trend, similar to Litecoin, according to experts."

In fact, the king of altcoins\u2019 number of addresses in profit reached a one month low. However, a few of the metrics turned bullish on the token, giving hope for a volatile northbound price movement in the coming days. Is Ethereum actually setting up the stage for a bull rally?\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nEthereum investors are at a loss\n\nGlassnode Alerts\u2019 latest tweet revealed that ETH investors were suffering high losses. As per the tweet, Ethereum\u2019s number of addresses in profit reached a one month low of 66.6 million. A major reason behind this was the token\u2019s slow-moving price action. ETH has failed to cross $1,900 for quite some time.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, ETH was down by nearly 1.4% in the last seven days. At press time, it was trading at $1,837.80 with a market capitalization of over $220 billion. It was interesting to see that despite the price decline, ETH\u2019s 24-hour trading volume shot up by 23%.\n\nIn fact, as per Glassnode, the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Signal (7d MA) just reached a 3-month high of 2,386.022. Nonetheless, LunarCrush\u2019s latest data gave a bullish notion and suggested that ETH\u2019s price chart could soon turn green.\n\nDecoding Ethereum\u2019s stance\n\nLunarCrush\u2019s data revealed that Ethereum had the highest Galaxy Score. A high Galaxy Score is a bullish indicator, suggesting a northbound price movement over the coming days. The whales also seemed to have high confidence in the token.\n\nThis was evident from the slight rise in the number of wallets with a balance of 10,000 ETH to 100,000,000 ETH. However, the sharks and shrimps continued to sell as addresses with a balance of 10 ETH to 10,000 ETH declined.\n\nApart from the Galaxy Score, a few other on-chain metrics were also in the bulls favor, increasing the chances of more volatile price action. For instance, Ethereum\u2019s exchange reserve was declining, which meant that the token was not under selling pressure.\n\nIts MVRV Ratio also showed signs of recovery, which was bullish. ETH\u2019s network activity also remained high, as evident from its daily active addresses. Moreover, ETH\u2019s network growth was also high in the last seven days.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nThings in the derivatives market also looked optimistic for ETH. Its takers buy/sell ratio was green. It means that buying sentiment was dominant in the futures market.\n\nAdditionally, its open interest registered a decline, increasing the chances of a trend reversal."

        "content": "The total amount staked equated to 21% of ETH\u2019s circulating supply.\n\nWith an increase in validators, the staking rewards have progressively reduced.\n\nThe much-awaited Shapella Upgrade, which went live on the Ethereum [ETH] mainnet earlier this year, has begun to advance towards its goal of boosting ETH staking.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nAs per a recent update by on-chain analysis firm Glassnode, the total ETH locked on the largest proof-of-stake (PoS) network clocked a fresh all-time high (ATH) of 27.03 million. This represented a nearly 40% jump since the execution of Shapella.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Total Value in the ETH 2.0 Deposit Contract just reached an ATH of 27,030,311 ETH Previous ATH of 27,029,938 ETH was observed on 05 August 2023 View metric:https://t.co/SzbMPqvhlb pic.twitter.com/H652OSM9q0 \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) August 6, 2023\n\nStakes are high\n\nShapella, which enabled withdrawals, marked an end to a two-year-long wait for users who began to lock their ETH holdings in the hopes of earning passive revenue from them.\n\nInfact not just the staked ETH but any earned staking incentives could also be withdrawn thanks to the upgrade. This marked a complete transition from the proof-of-work (PoW) to the proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithm.\n\nAs a result, individual holders who had been hesitant to deposit their money for an ambiguous period of time started to gradually stake more. These holders tested the unstaking mechanism in the first few days following the upgrade. This led to a significant uptick in withdrawal requests.\n\nHowever, since then, deposits have consistently outpaced withdrawals. According to blockchain research firm Nansen, the total amount locked at the time of publication equated to 21% of ETH\u2019s circulating supply.\n\nInterestingly, the increase in staked amount was in stark contrast to the depleting exchange supply of ETH. Since Shapella, ETH\u2019s reserves across centralized exchanged have dipped more than 20% until press time. The liquid supply constituted just 18% of all ETH tokens which were in public hands.\n\nThe fascinating divergence reflected what could be the beginning of a long-term trend in the Ethereum market. More and more people were taking ETH out of the market and using it as an investment to earn yields. And even though staking rewards have progressively reduced over the past two years, the clamor for staking continues to surge.\n\nRise of liquid staking\n\nApart from providing a fillip to staking, Shapella also unlocked new doors of opportunities for liquid staking tokens (LST). These derivative tokens, as is well known, enable users to participate in staking while also retaining the ability to use them elsewhere in decentralized finance (DeFi) for higher yield potential.\n\nTokens like Lido Staked ETH [stETH] and Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH began to replace native tokens as the primary DeFi collateral on various networks.\n\nOverall, liquid staking protocols extended their dominance since Shapella and outperformed other staking options like centralized exchanges (CEX) and staking pools.\n\nAs per Dune data, liquid staking accounted for the lion\u2019s share of the ETH staking market, roughly 36%. From being a non-existent entity when ETH staking was rolled out in December 2020, this category has steadily charged higher.\n\nWhat does ChatGPT think of ETH staking?\n\nHowever, like most analyses these days, I decided to add an AI tinge to proceedings. I consulted our AI expert ChatGPT to share its views on the future growth potential of Ethereum.\n\nI must admit the question \u2013 whether ETH staked supply will go past 30% of the total circulation supply, was very generic and egged the bot to showcase its soothsaying skills. However, it resisted the bait.\n\nChatGPT replied that predicting the next developments in ETH staking was like \u201cgazing into a crystal ball\u201d. However, it maintained that staking will play a big role in the evolution of the Ethereum network.\n\nStaking rewards drop significantly\n\nWhile ETH staking has clearly grown in popularity over the years, it has, ironically, reduced the staking yields, in pursuit of which users participated in the activity in the first place.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nAs per the proof-of-stake model, the rewards were inversely related to the amount of ETH deposited on the network and the number of stakers involved. Put simply, the more the number of stakers, the more thinly the yield gets spread out.\n\nThe total number of validators have soared by more than 50% since Shapella.

Discover SCENE\n\nShowing that crypto doesn\u2019t sleep, several imposter tokens using the PYUSD ticker have already appeared on the decentralized exchange, Uniswap, hoping to cash in on the hype around PayPal\u2019s newly announced ERC-20 stablecoin, PayPal USD.\n\nA PayPal spokesperson confirmed with Decrypt the real PayPal USD ERC-20 contract address via Etherscan. The token itself was created on November 8, 2022.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCurrently, trading pairs on Uniswap using the PYUSD ticker include PYUSD/WETH and PYUSD/WBNB. Both WETH and WBNB are \"wrapped\" tokens pegged to the market price of Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, respectively.\n\nThe ERC-20 token standard allows developers to create tokens on the Ethereum network. While not all, many of the tokens trading on Uniswap, like PayPal USD, are ERC-20 tokens.\n\nToday, we\u2019re unveiling a new stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD). It\u2019s designed for payments and is backed by highly liquid and secure assets. Starting today and rolling out in the next few weeks, you\u2019ll be able to buy, sell, hold and transfer PYUSD.

A decentralized exchange uses smart contracts to facilitate trading between individuals but doesn\u2019t take control of their coins.\n\nThanks to the hype surrounding Pepecoin, Uniswap\u2019s daily volume surpassed $1 billion, putting it ahead of centralized exchange Coinbase in May.\n\nPayPal just announced that they are launching a USD stablecoin, called PYUSD, as an ERC20 token on the Ethereum network Ethereum is slowly but surely becoming a global settlement layer for all types of value \u2014 sassal.eth \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@sassal0x) August 7, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a case of buyer beware, PayPal has stated that PYUSD would only be available through PayPal and did not specify if there were plans to list on third-party exchanges like Coinbase or Binance.\n\nPayPal said in its press release that PayPal USD could be sent between PayPal and compatible external wallets and adopted by exchanges, so the stablecoin could one day find its way onto decentralized exchanges whether PayPal likes it or not.\n\nStill, it is unlikely the tokens currently trading on Uniswap are anything other than a cash grab.\n\nDegens launching meme coins based on recent events is not new. On Sunday, news of the discovery of a new substance, LK-99, and its potential use for superconductors saw the launch of superconductor meme-coins, including LK-99, Superconductivity, and LK-99 Protocol.\n\nUniswap has not yet responded to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment."

This amount of Ether is worth $4.6 million. Nobody knows who this burner was and why he decided to remove the aforementioned ETH stash.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, @sassal0x made a reminder that roughly every 30 hours, the Ethereum network removes 2,500 from the circulating supply thanks to the EIP-1559 upgrade implemented two years ago.\n\nSome guy burned 2,500 ETH ($4.6mil) by sending it to an inaccessible Ethereum address\n\n\n\nFriendly reminder that the Ethereum network currently burns 2,500 ETH every 30ish hours thanks to EIP-1559\n\n\n\nSince EIP-1559 went live 2 years ago, 3.5mil ETH ($6.4bil) has been burned \u2014 sassal.eth \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@sassal0x) August 7, 2023\n\nBy now, since then, a total of 3.5 million Ethereum has been burned worth approximately $6.4 billion in fiat. Burning in plain language means reducing the circulating supply of a cryptocurrency by moving coins to unspendable wallets.\n\nStill, despite these massive daily burns, the ETH price has been unable to show any impressive performance. Currently, the second largest crypto is trading at $1,826 after a small decline. Earlier today, Ethereum managed to go up by 0.85% but has erased this gain by now.\n\nAside from that, Ethereum stakers keep adding their ETH to the Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract. According to the data shared by Glassnode recently, the total amount of ETH locked within the contract has reached 27,047,171 ETH \u2013 that is a new all-time high."

It\u2019s built on Ethereum and \u201cdesigned for digital payments and Web3,\u201d with the firm saying it will soon be available to United States customers.\n\nPayPal USD compatibility with crypto exchanges, Web3 apps and crypto wallets. Source: PayPal\n\nPYUSD will be redeemable for U.S. dollars at all times, can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies on PayPal, and will be transferable between PayPal and Venmo. The company claims it will soon be available as a mode of payment for various purchases.\n\nPayPal launching a stablecoin could accelerate its efforts to become a crypto payment giant, an initiative the company started in 2020 after making way for crypto payments on the platform.\n\nPayPal boasts over 350 million active users and already lets users in the U.S. and the United Kingdom buy, sell and hold Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC) while also enabling payments in the assets.\n\nPayPal CEO Dan Schulman hopes the new stablecoin will become a part of the overall payments infrastructure. The company first confirmed its plan to launch a crypto stablecoin in January 2022, claiming it would work closely with relevant regulators.\n\nWhile there are multiple stablecoins available in the crypto market, PayPal will be the first launched by a major payment processor. Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cWith the launch of the first stablecoin by a leading financial institution, PayPal and Paxos are proving the real-world value of blockchain technology. PayPal USD is the most significant leap forward for digital assets and the financial industry, and Paxos is proud to enable this transformative product.\u201d\n\nThe firm claimed that the regulatory environment around stablecoins in the U.S. is gradually \u201cprogressing toward more clarity,\u201d and thus, there is demand for an alternate stablecoin than what is currently available in the market.\n\nRelated: US Treasury says it must \u2018modernize and adapt\u2019 to digital currencies\n\nThe crypto stablecoin market has a $126 billion circulating supply, dominated by Tether-issued USDT (USDT) (which has an $86.5 billion market cap) and followed by Circle-issued USD Coin (USDC) (with a $26 billion market cap) and a few others. However, many stablecoins have recently faced regulatory hurdles in the United States, where policymakers are currently discussing a bipartisan stablecoin bill.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Yuan stablecoin team arrested, WeChat\u2019s new Bitcoin prices, HK crypto rules: Asia Express"

        "content": "By Peace Longe (Blockchain Writer)\n\nCreath has announced its plan to Launch on the Optimism (OP) Mainnet in Q4 of 2023. Optimism, a layer 2 Ethereum protocol, is a low-cost and super-fast blockchain that has caught the attention of several companies and investors worldwide. As of August 2023, Optimism boasts a $2 billion on-chain value, $3 billion in saved gas fees, and $11 million OP tokens distributed to public goods.\n\nOptimism achieves lowered network latency and cheap transactions by combining several transactions and sending them to Ethereum\u2019s Mainnet as one. This combination effectively drops the network traffic and reduces gas fees.\n\nCreath has identified an immense potential for growth on OP Mainnet, and the company plans to leverage it as a solution for application efficiency and improved user accessibility. Some benefits that Creath and its community will enjoy from Optimism are scalability, simple integration, and low costs.\n\nThanks to the Optimistic Virtual Machine (OVM), transitioning from Ethereum smart contracts to Optimism is seamless. OVM is an iteration of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that makes it possible to onboard projects on OP Mainnet without having to rewrite existing systems.\n\nCreath aims to introduce its community to the perks of transacting with OP tokens. Creath\u2019s pilot project, Creath Art Marketplace, is currently built on the ERC-20 blockchain. For this reason, USDC, an ERC-20 compatible token, is used with traditional fiat to facilitate transactions on the platform.\n\nHowever, once the transition to OP Mainnet begins, Creath\u2019s community can enjoy the benefits of transacting with OP tokens, one of which is OP airdrops. So far, Optimism has completed two rounds of OP airdrops, with token holders awaiting a third round.\n\nCreath will release more information about its transition to the Optimism blockchain in the coming months. Follow Creath\u2019s social media pages to stay up to date on its future goals and objectives.\n\nShare this article"

PayPal USD (PYUSD) will become available to the eligible U.S. customers in the upcoming weeks.\n\nThe ERC-20 stablecoin can be used for transfers between PayPal and supported external wallets, person-to-person payments, funding purchases, and converting any of the platform\u2019s listed digital assets to and from PayPal USD.\n\n\"The shift toward digital currencies requires a stable instrument that is both digitally native and easily connected to fiat currency like the U.S. dollar,\" commented Dan Schulman, president and CEO, PayPal. \"Our commitment to responsible innovation and compliance, and our track record delivering new experiences to our customers, provides the foundation necessary to contribute to the growth of digital payments through PayPal USD.\"\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s statement, PYUSD will serve as a bridge between fiat and Web3 for consumers and merchants, will be available to external developers, wallets and web3 applications, can be seamlessly adopted by exchanges, and used as a driving force behind many experiences in the PayPal ecosystem.\n\nThe issuer of PayPal USD is Paxos Trust Company, a fully licensed New-York based financial institution specializing in blockchain. PYUSD reserves are fully supported by U.S. dollar deposits, U.S. Treasuries and similar cash equivalents. PayPal USD can be bought or sold at a fixed rate $1 per PYUSD via PayPal.\n\nStarting from September 2023, Paxos will be publishing a public monthly Reserve Report for PayPal USD, and a public third-party attestation of the value of PayPal USD reserve assets.\n\n\u201cIn addition to building products and services that add utility to digital currencies, PayPal is focused on increasing consumer and merchant comprehension of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), while working closely with regulators as the industry evolves.\u201d reads the PayPal press release.\n\nPayPal Continues Integration of Crypto\n\nPayPal first confirmed its exploration of stablecoins back at the beginning of last year, although in February 2023 it reported to have halted the project due to regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. The release of PYUSD might mean that the company and its stablecoin issuer Paxos have finally reached an agreement with its persecutors.\n\nThe prominent fintech company has been actively exploring and integrating crypto services for the last couple of years. PayPal has recently revealed that it\u2019s holding almost $1 billion worth of crypto on behalf of its clients.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Despite the non-farm payroll report's negligible effect on its price, the market anticipates potential shifts with the release of July's CPI reports from US and China. Meanwhile, XDC sees a remarkable 15 percent price surge, while Ethereum maintains its $1,800 to $1,850 trading range.\u201d\n\nParth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures, said, \u201cThe crypto market has been range-bound over the weekend, with a market capitalisation of just over $1.2 trillion, up 0.4 percent in the last 24 hours. The crypto fear and greed index continues to be in the neutral zone but fell by a point over the weekend and is currently at 49/100. The market seems to be waiting for new signals which will determine future price action.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, offered his take, \u201cBitcoin tantalisingly approaches the $30,000 resistance level, fueling excitement among traders and investors for a potential bullish breakthrough. The cryptocurrency's recent price surge has generated optimism in the market, but uncertainty looms as the long-awaited Bitcoin ETF approval remains pending. Market participants eagerly anticipate the ETF's introduction, as it could potentially unleash a new wave of institutional investment, further solidifying Bitcoin's position in the financial landscape. On WazirX, Orchid (OXT) and Pendle (PENDLE) have been the top gainers in the last 24 hours.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin is in a tight trading range from $29,000 to $30,000 showing a bearish trend, with RSI and MACD indicating a further decline. SHIB defies the bear market and claims top crypto status in various metrics. SHIB's price rally continues, supported by increasing trading volume and decreasing supply on exchanges since April 2021. In particular, whale activity is surging, with SHIB in fourth place in holdings among the top 100 ETH whales. Despite a potential downside for Bitcoin towards $28,200 if support at $28,700 breaks, SHIB's resistance and bullish sentiment remain prominent as it diverges from the overall market trend.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, \u201cThe past 24 hours have seen a tremendous increase in market activity in the world of cryptocurrencies. An outstanding 8.08 percent rise and a staggering total volume of $21.53 billion showing a thriving environment bursting with promise. With a decline of about 5 percent in the previous day, Ripple's XRP topped the downward movement among large-cap digital assets. The market price of the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was 64 cents. The smart contracts platforms' respective coins, ADA, SOL, and MATIC (Cardano, Solana, and Polygon) also reversed, giving up early gains. The native token of the Litecoin network, LTC, continued its downward trend that usually occurs around its quadrennial halving event and fell another 4.5 percent. \u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "content": "Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain system that operates on an open-source platform. It has its digital currency called Ether (ETH) and serves as a foundation for various other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, it enables the execution of decentralized smart contracts.\n\nVitalik Buterin outlined the concept of Ethereum in a whitepaper published in 2013. To fund the project, Buterin, and the co-founders organized a public crowd sale in 2014, during which they raised $18.3 million worth of Bitcoin.\n\nThe initial price of Ethereum during the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) was $0.311, and more than 60 million Ether were sold. Considering the current price of Ethereum, this translates to an impressive annualized return on investment (ROI) of over 270%, nearly quadrupling the initial investment each year since the summer of 2014."

        "content": "With the continuous encroachment of the cryptocurrency industry into the mainstream, it is no surprise that the American financial technology mammoth Paypal (NASDAQ: PYPL) has supported payments via digital assets since 2020 and is now launching its own cryptocurrency, potentially boosting the adoption of the practice.\n\nAs it happens, PayPal has announced the rollout of PayPal USD (PYUSD), an ERC-20 United States dollar-pegged stablecoin issued by crypto firm Paxos Trust Company on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain and fully backed by USD deposits, short-term Treasuries, and similar cash equivalents, according to the company\u2019s press release published on August 7.\n\nPYUSD addition illustration. Source: Bloomberg/PayPal\n\nWhat this means\n\nSpecifically, the newest development will allow users to redeem PYUSD for dollars and other cryptocurrencies at any time on PayPal\u2019s network, as well as fund purchases, with availability on PayPal\u2019s popular payments app Venmo, coming soon. Once fully up and running, the latter feature will enable transfers of token holdings between PayPal and Venmo wallets. Third-party wallet compatibility with PYUSD outside the PayPal network is also pending.\n\nIn the words of PayPal\u2019s CEO Dan Schulman, who is preparing to step down in the coming months, the stablecoin will gradually become available to customers in the US, and the company\u2019s ultimate goal is to become the leader in digital payments using direct, fast, and cheaper transfer technology.\n\n\u201cThe vision over time is that this becomes a part of the overall payments infrastructure,\u201d Schulman said in an interview.\n\nPayPal and crypto\n\nIndeed, PayPal started its stablecoin work after the Department of Financial Services granted it a \u2018BitLicense,\u2019 issued to businesses working with digital assets. However, the work halted in February due to regulatory pressure on cryptos, which saw an investigation of Paxos for allegedly illegal sales of Binance USD (BUSD) that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) considers a security.\n\nHowever, the head of PayPal\u2019s blockchain and digital currencies team, Jose Fernandez da Ponte, said in an interview that his company now considers the regulatory environment \u201cprogressing toward more clarity\u201d and recognizes rising demand for an alternative stablecoin in a currently highly concentrated market.\n\nMeanwhile, PayPal has supported crypto payments for almost three years now, allowing its users to buy, sell, and hold Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto assets using its online wallets, as well as to pay for products and services in crypto, as Finbold reported on October 21, 2020."

        "title": "Crypto Price Analysis: BTC, ETH, and SHIB Struggle to Break Above Key Levels - Blockchain Reporter",
        "content": "In this comprehensive crypto market analysis, we will delve into the recent price movements of several prominent cryptocurrencies and explore their technical indicators. Each coin exhibits unique traits that contribute to its popularity in the market. We\u2019ll discuss Bitcoin\u2019s stability as a market influencer, Ethereum\u2019s battle with resistance levels, Bancor\u2019s notable surge, and Curve Network\u2019s rebound after an exploit.\n\nWe will also discuss Shiba Inu\u2019s steady gains, StormX\u2019s loyalty rewards impact, and SOLANA\u2019s distinct appeal fueled by meme culture. Traders and investors alike must be well-informed as they navigate these dynamic crypto landscapes, considering both technical analysis and underlying factors affecting each token\u2019s price trajectory.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $29,036, which is up 0.01% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin, being the pioneer and most dominant cryptocurrency, often sets the tone for the entire market. Looking at the price chart, we can see that Bitcoin has been moving in a relatively tight range over the last 24 hours. The small percentage change indicates a lack of significant price movement in the short term.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Bitcoin\u2019s price is still above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which is a bullish signal. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching overbought territory, suggesting a potential short-term pullback. Traders should keep a close eye on key support and resistance levels at $28,500 and $30,000, respectively. A breakout above $30,000 could lead to further gains, while a drop below $28,500 may signal a deeper correction.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Analysis\n\nEthereum (ETH) is currently trading at $1,830, which is 0.1% down in the last 24 hours. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has been experiencing minor losses in the past few days. The price chart shows that ETH is struggling to break above its recent resistance levels. The technical indicators for Ethereum are mixed. The moving averages are still in a bullish posture, indicating a potential for further upside.\n\nHowever, the RSI is hovering in neutral territory, suggesting a lack of clear direction. Traders should closely monitor the support level around $1,800 and the resistance level near $1,900. A break below $1,800 might trigger additional selling pressure, while a break above $1,900 could lead to a new bullish trend.\n\nBancor (BNT) Price Analysis\n\nBancor, an automated liquidity protocol, has seen a notable price surge today. Bancor (BNT) is currently trading at $0.5812, which is 7.16% up in the last 24 hours. This positive movement indicates increased buying interest in the token. From a technical standpoint, Bancor\u2019s price has broken above its 50-day moving average, suggesting a potential trend reversal.\n\nThe RSI is also in bullish territory, indicating that there might be further upside potential. Traders should watch for potential resistance at the previous highs around $0.60 and $0.65. A continuation of the upward trend may lead to a test of these levels, while a pullback could find support at around $0.55.\n\nCurve Network (CURVE) Price Analysis\n\nCurve Network (CURVE) is currently trading at $0.0001385, which is 11.17% up in the last 24 hours. Curve Network, a decentralized exchange liquidity pool, recently witnessed a major exploit. This resulted in a significant decline in the price of CURVE. However, as the situation improved in the past few days, the token has experienced significant gains.\n\nThe price chart shows a strong upward movement. The technical indicators for CURVE are overwhelmingly bullish. The token\u2019s price is well above its moving averages, and the RSI indicates that it is not yet in overbought territory. Traders should be cautious, as the sharp price increase might lead to profit-taking and a potential correction. Key levels to watch are the recent resistance at $0.00014 and the support around $0.00012.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) Price Analysis\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at $0.000009652, which is 2.73% up in the last 24 hours. Shiba Inu, a meme-based cryptocurrency, has shown modest gains and the price movement appears to be relatively stable compared to some other cryptocurrencies in this analysis. The technical indicators for SHIB are neutral. The price is hovering around its moving averages, and the RSI is close to the middle ground\n\nThese technical indicators are indicating a lack of strong buying or selling pressure. Traders should keep an eye on the support level of Shiba Inu at $0.000009 and the resistance at $0.00001. A break above $0.00001 might signal a potential uptrend, while a drop below $0.000009 could lead to further downside for SHIB.\n\nStormX (STMX) Price Analysis\n\nStormX, a blockchain-based loyalty rewards platform, has seen a slight increase in its price today. StormX (STMX) is currently trading at $0.006927, which is 0.24% up in the last 24 hours. The technical indicators for STMX suggest a relatively stable market. The price is trading around its moving averages, and the RSI is in a neutral zone.\n\nSTMX traders should closely monitor the support level at $0.0065 and the resistance level at $0.007. A break above the resistance for the STMX price may signal a potential bullish move for the coin, while a drop below support could lead to further consolidation. Traders should closely watch STMX price movements in the upcoming days.\n\nBarbieCrashBandicootRFK888Inu (SOLANA) Price Analysis\n\nBarbieCrashBandicootRFK888Inu (SOLANA) is currently trading at $0.000000003932, which is 2.75% down in the last 24 hours. What sets SOLANA apart as an absolute game-changer is its unwavering commitment to memes and viral brilliance. This cryptocurrency thrives on pushing boundaries and refusing to settle for anything less than sheer awesomeness.\n\nThe community behind SOLANA is a force to be reckoned with, comprising meme warriors who unleash an unstoppable onslaught of viral content that will leave you in awe and stitches. These factors contribute to SOLANA\u2019s popularity and make it an exciting and vibrant cryptocurrency in the market. However, investors and traders should exercise extreme caution when dealing with low liquidity and lesser-known tokens."

        "title": "Bitcoin Spark Creates Hybrid Approach To Ethereum and Bitcoin Scaling Solutions - Blockzeit",
        "content": "While many Ethereum and Bitcoin scaling solutions exist, Bitcoin Spark is making waves with its innovative hybrid approach. By combining elements of Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, Bitcoin Spark is positioning itself as a promising contender in the race for a fast, secure, and scalable blockchain network.\n\nWhat is Proof of Work?\n\nProof of Work (PoW) is the first consensus mechanism to be used in the blockchain ecosystem. A consensus mechanism refers to the process by which participants in a decentralized network agree on the validity of transactions and the order in which they are added to the blockchain. In PoW blockchains like Bitcoin, miners compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles, with the first to solve it earning the right to add a new block to the blockchain. Once a block is added to the chain, other nodes in the network can easily verify the solution. PoW ensures the immutability and security of the blockchain, as altering a block would require redoing the work for all subsequent blocks, which becomes computationally infeasible as the chain grows. However, PoW consumes a considerable amount of energy, which has led to concerns about its environmental impact.\n\nWhat is Proof of Stake?\n\nProof of Stake (PoS) is an alternative consensus mechanism employed in various blockchains, including Ethereum. Unlike PoW, PoS does not rely on miners solving complex puzzles but rather on validators who are chosen to create new blocks, with the probability of being selected directly proportional to the number of coins staked. PoS is considered more energy-efficient than PoW as it eliminates the need for resource-intensive mining. Additionally, PoS encourages long-term participation and ownership, as validators have a financial incentive to act in the best interest of the network to avoid losing their staked coins. This consensus mechanism offers a more scalable solution for blockchain networks, reducing the environmental impact while maintaining security and decentralization.\n\nBitcoin Spark and the Proof of Process\n\nBitcoin Spark is a new Bitcoin fork that seeks to provide enhanced speed, security, and scalability. The project introduces an all-new consensus mechanism known as Proof of Process (PoP), which is a blend of Proof of Work and Proof of Stake. In this hybrid system, users are required to stake coins on the network. They must also provide processing power to the network, which is utilized by its clients for remote computing tasks with high CPU or GPU loads. The project\u2019s development team has created a user-friendly mining program that can be installed on Windows, Mac OS, Linux, iOS, and Android devices and enables users to mine by permitting secure, isolated access to their device\u2019s processing unit. The software itself adjusts how much of the device\u2019s processing power is used, thereby limiting the mining capacity by default. The work required, and energy used for block confirmation on Bitcoin Spark is thus relatively low.\n\nRewards within the Bitcoin Spark ecosystem are calculated based on a combination of the individual stake and the work done using the network as remote computing power. However, the PoP is combined with an algorithm that constrains linear rewards based on raw processing power or stake size. This fosters a more equitable distribution of rewards among network participants, ensuring that those with increased mining capabilities earn more but not in a way that is unbalanced purely by fiat-equivalent net worth. Additionally, distributing the blockchain validation across more devices and individuals reduces the risk of a single miner becoming too powerful, significantly increasing the security of the network.\n\nThe mining rewards also follow an elastic system based on revenue inflow, the price of BTCS, and the number of miners in the ecosystem. The revenue generated within the Bitcoin Spark network from CPU rental, advertisements, and other additional services supplements and reduces mining rewards. This causes the minting endpoint to move further away, leading to a self-sustaining revenue network where participants remain profitable with a limited and constant supply of BTCS.\n\nBy combining these and other innovative features, Bitcoin Spark aims to establish itself as a robust and efficient blockchain network, delivering enhanced scalability and sustainability while empowering a diverse range of network participants. Phase 1 of the Bitcoin Spark Initial Coin Offering (ICO) offers investors an opportunity to get BTCS at $1.05, along with a 20% bonus.\n\nFor more on Bitcoin Spark:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register"
