        "title": "Understanding Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) - Ledger",
        "content": "Understanding Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\n\nBy Lipsa Das\n\nRead 6 min Medium\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: \u2014 Ethereum Virtual Machine (or EVM) is a virtual computer that distributes information across the entire Ethereum network. It is responsible for executing smart contracts and updating the state of the blockchain.\n\n\n\n\u2014 EVM is not just for Ethereum; many layer one and two blockchains use it, including Polygon, Arbitrum and Avalanche.\n\n\n\n\u2014 EVM has improved interoperability and accessibility, powering countless decentralized applications and other use cases across multiple blockchains.\n\nAs the world\u2019s most popular blockchain for smart contracts, Ethereum owes much of its success to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). From gas fees to smart contract execution, the Ethereum Virtual Machine is responsible for much of the magic behind the Ethereum blockchain. EVM also powers the ecosystem of other leading blockchains like Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, etc.\n\nBut what is the Ethereum Virtual Machine, and how does it work?\n\nLet\u2019s dig in and find out.\n\nWhat Is the Ethereum Virtual Machine?\n\nEthereum Virtual Machine is software that executes programmable code on the blockchain (smart contracts) and determines the state of Ethereum after each successful block.\n\nAs a virtual machine, EVM doesn\u2019t have a central computer or cloud \u2014 it distributes and executes information across hundreds of computers participating in the network, also called nodes. These nodes all run the same EVM code, which makes it easier to build software on Ethereum.\n\nHistory of the Ethereum Virtual Machine\n\nBefore diving deep into what EVM does, let\u2019s first understand how it came to be. Vitalik Buterin introduced the idea of Ethereum in 2013 \u2014 creating a decentralized platform for building applications. Vitalik\u2019s idea eventually became the Ethereum network, and at the heart of that network is the EVM.\n\nInterestingly, Vitalik claims that BitTorrent was the first decentralized app (or dApp) ever created in 2001. BitTorrent and the EVM are similar in that they are both peer-to-peer networks with no central authority, but they serve different purposes.\n\nFor instance, BitTorrent is great for a singular purpose i.e, sharing files. But EVM goes beyond just file sharing with decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nThe EVM provides a secure and reliable environment for running dApps, which is crucial, particularly while handling sensitive data or financial transactions.\n\nWhat Does the Ethereum Virtual Machine Do?\n\nEthereum Virtual machine primarily functions as a runtime environment for smart contracts.\n\nYou can think of EVM as the \u201cbrain\u201d behind the Ethereum network: It executes code and ensures the entire network agrees on the outcome of the code.\n\nEVM powers many decentralized applications and NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. Due to the flexibility and security of smart contracts, these dApps range from play-to-earn games to crypto lending and borrowing applications. With EVM, you can build these dApps in any programming language and execute timely transactions.\n\nFurther, EVM is capable of Turing completeness, which means that smart contracts can perform any combination of code and complex calculations. This includes complex computations like AI and cryptography, allowing for a wide range of use cases and applications.\n\nTherefore, Ethereum dApps benefit from the security of a decentralized network, plus the flexibility of performing complex computations.\n\nHow the Ethereum Virtual Machine Works\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine can implement smart contract logic and validate ownership of funds. To do so, it uses a stack-based architecture, which means the nodes come in a particular order. Having a strict pre-defined order helps Ethereum resist hacker attacks and increase efficiency. Further, a stack-based architecture is very versatile, and easily supports different types of instructions.\n\nEVM supports different programming languages, but the most popular ones for developers are Vyper and Solidity. This is because developers write smart contracts and decentralized applications using these languages.\n\nHowever, since EVM cannot understand English like humans, the network must translate the code before deploying it. This is where compilers come into play \u2013 software that acts as a translator between the machine and the developer.\n\nCompilers convert human-readable Solidity code to the computer-friendly version in two components: an instruction format called \u201cbytecode\u201d and a specification technique called Contract ABI.\n\nWhile Bytecode is the common language that the entire Ethereum network understands, Contract ABI defines how other applications can interact with each smart contract. Let\u2019s understand how this works in the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nFirst, each smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain goes through the Ethereum compiler, translating it to bytecode and Contract ABI.\n\nNext, the bytecode and Contract ABI is deployed to the EVM, distributing it across the entire Ethereum network. Each node on the network receives and stores a copy of the bytecode, making it tamper-proof.\n\nNow, the EVM has the job of simplifying the bytecode further for the computer. Each computer has pre-defined sets of instructions known as opcodes. Bytecode sequences correspond to and trigger these opcodes. Next, the EVM executes all of the requests represented by the opcode.\n\nAdvantages of the Ethereum Virtual Machine\n\nBlockchains using the Ethereum Virtual machine are very developer-friendly, and therefore quite popular. EVM allows for a range of capabilities but here are some of the most prominent ones:\n\nCross Blockchain Support\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine can support any blockchain with bytecode-compatible smart contracts. Therefore, several blockchains, such as Polygon and Avalanche, use EVM to power their ecosystems.\n\nIsolated Sandbox\n\nAlthough the EVM uses the same computer network for all applications, it can execute each code separately. There is no impact on the underlying blockchain or other data stored by the node computers. This allows for fast and efficient development.\n\nFlexible Development\n\nEVM can easily execute complex and customized smart contracts, such as those used for transactions on dApps, DeFi, games, and NFTs. It also has a large developer community that makes building software easier.\n\nCross-functional Across Operating Systems\n\nBlockchains have a large number of computers participating in their network, each with different operating systems like MacOS, Windows etc. These operating systems are vastly different from the others, which makes it challenging to develop software. However, EVM allows us to standardize and run programs on multiple operating systems without writing separate code.\n\nDisadvantages of the EVM\n\nWhile building on Ethereum has many benefits, all good things come at a price. And in Ethereum, that price is high crypto gas fees.\n\nThe EVM has scalability limitations, meaning it can only handle a limited number of transactions per second. As a result, when the network is too crowded, the gas fees can shoot up very quickly.\n\nDue to the popularity of Ethereum, it can become expensive to deploy custom smart contracts or bulky applications. You need to optimize your contracts for speed and efficiency, removing repetitive code or unnecessary functions. You also need to account for the fact that storage costs on Ethereum can be equally expensive.\n\nAnother disadvantage of EVM is that once you deploy a smart contract on the blockchain, you can\u2019t change it. This can be a major problem if you discover a bug or vulnerability after deployment. In such cases, you\u2019ll need to redeploy the entire contract, and the extra fees can add up quickly.\n\nThe Future of EVM\n\nThe future of EVM is bright, with growing adoption and exciting developments on the horizon.\n\nFor instance, with other blockchains using a common base such as EVM, interoperability is becoming easier. For instance, developers can easily create dApps compatible with multiple blockchains at once. Further, it\u2019s easier to transfer funds between EVM-compatible blockchains, so new blockchains can scale faster.\n\nAnother exciting development for the EVM is the EOF upgrade in 2023. To explain, EOF stands for EVM Object Format and it will be the first upgrade to the Ethereum Virtual Machine since its inception in 2015. To learn more about the details, make sure you read the EOF documentation. But to give you a basic overview: EOF will significantly change how EVM works, allowing for cheaper and faster smart contracts and an overall increase in security.\n\nYour Wallet on EVM blockchains\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered why your address is the same on your Ethereum wallet as it is on Polygon, let\u2019s get into why.\n\nNow, your wallets on EVM blockchains are \u201cExternally Owned Accounts (EOA)\u201d, which means they use traditional key pairs to access them. One of them is the public key, an identifier, and the other is the private key, the passphrase. Wallets are of two types: Software or hardware wallets. Software wallets are digital wallets that store your private keys on your computer or mobile device. On the other hand, hardware wallets store your private keys offline on a physical device.\n\nNo matter which of these wallets you have, all EVM-compatible blockchains use EVM as the base technology. Accordingly, they use the same addressing scheme. Wallet addresses on these blockchains start with \u201c0x\u201d followed by 40 characters of alphanumeric code.\n\nThat means you can use the same wallet address on all EVM-compatible blockchains, such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon.\n\nKeep Your Assets Secure Using a Ledger Hardware Wallet\n\nAlthough software wallets provide easy access, hardware wallets keep your crypto secure from physical or digital attacks. Your private key is stored offline, so your assets are completely in your control.\n\nWhen it comes to security, Ledger\u2019s industry-leading hardware wallets have you covered. Ledger\u2019s devices have an advanced secure element chip, the preferred solution for securing critical data among banks and governments!\n\nSecure your crypto assets with the ultimate protection of a hardware wallet like Ledger."

        "title": "3 reasons why Ethereum price can reach $3K in Q2 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), eyes a run-up toward $3,000 in Q2 2023 after wrapping the previous quarter with 55% gains.\n\nETH price nears potential breakout\n\nThe price of Ether has more than doubled after bottoming out in June at around $880, weathering a slew of negative events, including the collapse of FTX, interest rate increases, and stricter U.S. regulations.\n\nIn doing so, ETH/USD has painted an ascending triangle, confirmed by its rising trendline support and horizontal level resistance. The pattern suggests aggressive buying as lows get steadily higher while highs stay around the same level, indicative of a higher selling pressure at the given level.\n\nAs of April 2, ETH\u2019s price is testing its horizontal level resistance range ($1,700-1,820) for a potential breakout move.\n\nETH/USD three-day price chart featuring an \u201cascending triangle\u201d bottom setup.\n\nA breakout will be confirmed if the price closes above the resistance range while accompanying higher volumes. Furthermore, the ascending triangle breakout target is measured with its length equal to the triangle height.\n\nIn other words, the bullish ETH price target is in the $3,350-3,900 range, depending on where traders see the triangle\u2019s rising trendline support, as shown by the T1 and T2 in the chart above. This would suggest 80% gains by June.\n\nConversely, a pullback from the $1,700-1,820 range risks delaying the upside setup and resulting in a broader price correction.\n\nEthereum whale accumulation remains strong\n\nFrom an on-chain perspective, Ether\u2019s short-term and long-term trends look skewed toward the bulls.\n\nMost Ethereum whale cohorts have increased their ETH accumulation in recent weeks, according to the latest data from Santiment. For instance, the supply of Ether held by addresses with a 1,000-10,000 ETH balance (blue in the chart below) has grown by 0.5% in March.\n\nEther supply distribution among investors holding at least 1,000 ETH. Source: Santiment\n\nSimilarly, the 1 million-10 million ETH (brown) and the 10 million - 100 million ETH balance cohorts have witnessed 0.4% and 0.5% rises, respectively.\n\nThe growth appeared amid what appears to be the absorption of selling pressure introduced by the 100,000-1 million ETH (pink) and 10,000-100,000 ETH (orange) address cohorts.\n\nAt the same time, the growth could attributed to the network\u2019s proof-of-stake contracts \u2014 directly or by using third-party stakers such as Lido DAO (LDO).\n\nEthereum 2.0 total value staked [in ETH]. Source: Glassnode\n\nThe net Ether deposited at the official Ethereum 2.0 address crossed above 18 million ETH after rising about 3.5% in March.\n\nRelated: Analysts debate the ETH price outcomes of Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Shapella upgrade\n\nThe deposits have grown ahead of Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai and Capella upgrades on April 12, which will enable stakers to withdraw ETH from the PoS smart contract. Currently, this is not possible.\n\nMVRV Z-Score: Ethreum price bottom reversal\n\nMore bullish arguments stem from Ethereum\u2019s MVRV Z-Score entering a stage that has previously preceded long-term ETH price rallies.\n\nEthereum MVRV-Z Score. Source: Glassnode\n\nThe MVRV Z-Score assesses when Ethereum is overvalued and undervalued relative to its \u201cfair value.\u201d As a rule, the MVRV Z-score indicates a market top (red zone) when market value rises above realized value, while the opposite indicates market bottoms (green zone).\n\nEther\u2019s previous price recoveries coincide with its MVRV Z-Score bouncing from the green zone, suggesting the same could happen over the next three months.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "What the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Means for You, ETH, and the SEC - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIn just shy of two weeks, if all goes to plan, Ethereum\u2019s eagerly anticipated Shanghai upgrade will go live, enabling the withdrawal of staked ETH from the blockchain network and effectively completing its years-long transition to proof of stake.\n\nSince December 2020, when Ethereum began that journey to a proof-of-stake model\u2014in which users stake cryptocurrency with a network to validate on-chain transactions, and then are rewarded for that participation with newly generated cryptocurrency\u2014network participants have deposited over $32.95 billion worth of ETH with the network.\n\nIn September, Ethereum\u2019s merge event successfully upgraded the network\u2019s mainnet to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, forever changing the way Ethereum transactions are processed and reducing the network\u2019s carbon footprint by 99%, according to figures from the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the merge did not grant stakers on the network the ability to withdraw deposited ETH or the rewards generated by those deposits. Those funds remain captive on Ethereum; Shanghai will finally, after over two years, make them accessible.\n\nOn April 12, at 11:27 pm UTC, Shanghai will activate. What will that seismic moment in Ethereum\u2019s history mean for the network, for its participants, and for the broader crypto ecosystem?\n\nETH better have my money\n\nAs a technical matter, Shanghai will be less involved than one might expect. The vast majority of Ethereum stakers, who have deposited their ETH with the network through intermediaries like Lido and Coinbase, won\u2019t need to do anything on their ends once Shanghai goes live\u2014besides wait.\n\nStaked ETH, and the rewards generated by those funds, will be made available for withdrawal by intermediaries at varying dates following Shanghai\u2019s successful implementation. Lido, the largest ETH staking intermediary, recently announced that such capability will be introduced about a month after the upgrade, after a series of audits and safety checks.\n\nCoinbase, meanwhile, has not offered a firm timetable for rolling out staked ETH withdrawals, saying the process could take up to several months for some customers. All Ethereum network participants staking via third parties should check with those companies as to when their funds will be made available.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor the smaller number of independent validators who have staked directly with Ethereum (that pool is smaller because Ethereum requires validators to deposit at least 32 ETH, or just over $58,000 at writing, to stake with the network), matters will be only slightly more hands-on.\n\nValidators must first provide a withdrawal address for staked funds to be sent to; typically, most validators already submitted that address during the staking deposit process. Once a withdrawal address has been submitted to Ethereum, it cannot be changed.\n\nValidators can then opt for either a partial or full withdrawal. A partial withdrawal will send all funds and rewards generated beyond the minimum deposit amount of 32 ETH to a validator\u2019s withdrawal address. If a validator\u2019s withdrawal credentials are updated, then partial withdrawals will be sent to their withdrawal address automatically.\n\nIndependent stakers can also opt for a full withdrawal, which removes a user\u2019s full stake, including original deposits of 32 ETH, from Ethereum, ending a validator\u2019s participation in the transaction validation process. To fully withdraw from Ethereum\u2019s staking process, a validator need only send a single exit message to the network using their validator keys and validator client.\n\nPartial and full withdrawals will be processed in the order they are received by the network; based on the expected amount of traffic to come immediately following Shanghai\u2019s implementation, that initial queue could last up to 2 to 3 days.\n\nWhat will Shanghai mean for the Ethereum ecosystem?\n\nWhile Shanghai will certainly be a notable event for individual stakers, and carries great symbolic significance as the culmination of Ethereum\u2019s transformation to a functional proof-of-stake network, the upgrade will not meaningfully change the way that users interact with Ethereum, nor the underlying economics of the network itself.\n\n\u201cMost people have been able to sell [staked ETH] for quite some time, because the majority of ETH is being staked through platforms with liquid staking tokens, like Lido or Rocket Pool,\u201d Jacob Cantele, head of product at Ethereum layer-2 Mantle, told Decrypt. \u201cSo I don't actually think [Shanghai] represents a major shift in the economics of Ethereum.\u201d\n\nThe vast majority of ETH staked with Ethereum has, up to this point, been deposited with the network via third-party intermediaries, including staking pools like Lido, Rocket Pool, and Stakefish, as well as centralized crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance. This is largely due to the fact, as mentioned above, that an individual validator must possess 32 ETH, or just over $58,000 at writing, to stake directly with Ethereum. Intermediary staking services generally allow for ETH deposits of any amount, in exchange for a small service fee.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany of those intermediaries have issued tokens representing staked ETH to their customers, meaning that a sizable portion of the capital supposedly held captive in Ethereum\u2019s staking deposit contract has been traveling freely around the crypto ecosystem for years. And with Ethereum\u2019s internal mechanisms fully converted to proof of stake since September, the network looks poised to chug along post-Shanghai without much noticeable difference.\n\n\u201cShanghai\u2019s very exciting, but I do think it's just another step in the progression forward,\u201d Alison Mangiero, executive director of Proof of Stake Alliance, an advocacy group for proof-of-stake blockchain networks like Ethereum, told Decrypt.\n\nWhat will Shanghai mean for the broader crypto climate?\n\nBut whereas matters within Ethereum appear likely to look largely unchanged following Shanghai, the political landscape beyond the network\u2019s virtual borders may be much more substantially impacted by the upgrade.\n\nIn the last year, and particularly since the stunning collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November, American regulators have cracked down heavily on crypto companies, most recently those offering staking services. In February, the SEC hit centralized crypto exchange Kraken with a $30 million fine, alleging the company\u2019s intermediary staking services constituted illegal securities offerings.\n\nKraken competitors like Coinbase took the opportunity to clarify that their own staking services did not determine rates of return on staked deposits in-house, as Kraken\u2019s had, and therefore should not be considered yield products. Last week, regardless, the SEC issued Coinbase with a Wells Notice, alleging that company\u2019s staking services also constitute unregistered securities. Such a notice indicates that an enforcement action in the form of a lawsuit from the SEC is likely forth-coming.\n\nShanghai\u2019s implementation alone may not immediately change the calculus of the SEC\u2019s escalating war with staking intermediaries. But it could place another, much larger staking-related target in the federal agency\u2019s crosshairs: Ethereum itself.\n\nThe very day the merge successfully transitioned Ethereum to proof of stake in September, SEC chair Gary Gensler, according to the Wall Street Journal, told reporters that proof of stake networks could be considered securities offerings due to their rewards mechanisms, all-but calling out Ethereum by name. Since that date, Gensler has slowly but surely built the case that ETH is likely a security, primarily by suggesting that \u201conly Bitcoin\u201d is a commodity.\n\nIt is possible that the SEC\u2014which has long-defined \u201cinvestment contracts,\u201d a type of security, as investments made with an \u201cexpectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others\u201d\u2014might use the implementation of Shanghai as evidence of the fulfillment of a securities arrangement between ETH stakers and the core Ethereum team that implemented the upgrade.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPeople aren't going to get the [Ethereum] that they've earned as staking rewards, unless the Shanghai upgrade is successful,\u201d Michael Selig, an attorney specializing in crypto regulation, who previously worked for the CFTC, told Decrypt. \u201cWho's coordinating that? The SEC might have a list of people. It\u2019s the essential efforts being performed by these guys to make it happen.\u201d\n\nWhile Selig adamantly believes such a move on the SEC\u2019s part would constitute a misinterpretation of securities law, particularly given the decentralization of the Ethereum core development team, he fears it may be a path forward to censoring the Ethereum network as a whole.\n\n\u201cWhat do they have to say? \u2018Look, these are investment contracts, and here\u2019s evidence that there\u2019s management or efforts being made by certain people,\u2019\u201d Selig said.\n\nSuch an argument would not likely be made until withdrawals are enabled on Ethereum, and the theoretical contract between Ethereum and its users is fulfilled. Should the Shanghai upgrade fail\u2014an unlikely scenario, given the diligence and track record of Ethereum\u2019s core developers\u2014the SEC would have an even better case, arguing on behalf of swarms of disgruntled stakers that the network failed to fulfill its end of an investment bargain.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the SEC\u2019s appetite for crypto regulation might have grown so large as to attempt to snuff out one of the linchpins of the entire blockchain ecosystem. But whereas April 12\u2014the date of Shanghai\u2019s implementation\u2014will remain a largely symbolic milestone within the crypto industry, symbolism can often have much more tangible repercussions in the realm of politics."

        "title": "Top Analyst Forecasts Ethereum (ETH) Short Squeeze, Says Crypto May Play Catch Up To Stock Market - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "A closely followed crypto analyst believes Ethereum (ETH) could be gearing for a rally en route to liquidating traders who are bearish on the leading smart contract platform.\n\nIn a new blog post, Justin Bennett says that the S&P 500\u2019s (SPX) rally on Friday could hint at the short-term performance of the crypto markets.\n\nAccording to the analyst, crypto tends to follow in the footsteps of the stock market but there appears to be lag between the two asset classes. Bennett adds that should crypto take cues from equities, he sees Ethereum taking out resistance at $1,840.\n\nBennett says an Ethereum breakout could trigger a short squeeze as he notes that there\u2019s a \u201csignificant cluster\u201d of short liquidations up the the $2,000 price level for ETH.\n\nA short squeeze happens when large numbers of traders who shorted an asset decide to cut their losses in response to an unexpected price bump. The squeeze then triggers additional rallies.\n\nSays Bennett,\n\n\u201cThat could be telling, as cryptocurrencies like to target these areas, and $2,030 is the August 2022 high. Far more long liquidations are below current levels, but proximity matters, so the short liquidations up to $2,000 may influence ETH in the short term.\u201d\n\nHowever, Bennett says that the clock is ticking for crypto and Ethereum. According to the trader, the Ethereum short squeeze must happen in the coming days. Otherwise, he says that the rally may not materialize at all.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019d like to see crypto play \u2018catch up\u2019 to equities sooner rather than later if this is to materialize.\n\nIf we don\u2019t see ETH flush these shorts in the next few days, it\u2019s less likely to occur.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $1,818.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum ERC-4337 and its Potential for the Real-Estate Industry\n\nEthereum\u2019s recent upgrade to the ERC-4337 standard is the key to onboarding the $3.7 trillion world of traditional real estate to Web3. Deployed in a surprise announcement at ETHDenver, this new protocol standard caught many people off-guard with its list of improvements. So what is ERC-4337 all about?\n\nWhat is the ERC-4337 standard?\n\nERC-4337 ushers in a new standard for Ethereum wallets called account abstraction. Quite simply, Ethereum wallets that opted into ERC-4337 are now \u201csmart wallets\u201d that live entirely on-chain. The wallets are programmable, much like smart contracts themselves, and allow for important benefits such as:\n\nAccount Recovery\n\nTwo-factor authentication security\n\nBundled transactions\n\nIncrease interoperability between EVM-compatible tokens\n\nSetting spending limits on accounts\n\nHow can these new features help real estate?\n\nAnyone who has been a part of a real estate transaction can tell you one thing \u2013 it is an inefficient process stuck in the Web Zero era. Title searches are slow and aren\u2019t guaranteed to catch everything, people need to drive around in cars to hand physical pieces of paper to each other, and payments can take days to complete.\n\nFor years, many people have looked to blockchain technology as a way to modernize some of these pain points. Commonly discussed improvements include:\n\nUsing NFTs to represent property deeds\n\nReplacing title searches with Etherscan searches\n\nCollecting rent using stablecoins\n\nUsing contract signatures instead of notarized signatures\n\nWhile these ideas sound great, there also come with many hurdles to overcome. Account abstraction will help to resolve two of the biggest issues \u2013 account recovery and two-factor authentication.\n\nAccount Recovery\n\nCustodying crypto is a challenge, and losing access to a wallet holding something important like a deed or a landlord\u2019s operating account would be catastrophic. Just using crypto is scary for many people, and the idea of needing to keep a 24-word seed phrase safe forever is a hard sell to anyone already skeptical of the industry.\n\nFortunately, ERC-4337 allows users the ability to regain control of their wallets, even if the owner were to lose their private keys, with the use of \u201cGuardians\u201d.\n\nGuardians are individuals or entities users can elect to recover an account in the event of losing access to a wallet. An example of a Guardian would be a trusted friend, a university that distributes diplomas as NFTs, or even, someday, a local bank.\n\nERC-4337 decreases reliance upon seed phrases, greatly helping mainstream adoption\n\nBy allowing social recovery for Ethereum wallets, it\u2019s now much more likely that real estate companies will consider using smart contracts technology in their day-to-day business.\n\nTwo-factor authentication\n\nAnother key feature of ERC-4337 is the introduction of two-factor authentication support. To many, the crypto world is synonymous with getting hacked. \\With two-factor authentication, users can finally protect their accounts from hackers gaining access to their wallets, and within minutes, stealing all their assets.\n\nAdditionally, wallet owners will be able to set limits for transferable amounts. So, If a wallet contains 100 eth, for instance, users can restrict an ERC-4337-enabled wallet from sending more than 10 eth without first approving the transaction with two-factor authorization.\n\nThe ability to properly secure high-value items with two-factor authentication and spending limits makes it much more likely that real estate firms will feel comfortable using blockchain in the future. Before this implementation, there was too much risk involved for traditionally conservative real estate companies to consider using blockchain to any serious extent.\n\nCommon 2FA services include Google Authenticator and Authy\n\nWill Account Recovery and Two-Factor Authorization be enough to onboard the real estate industry into Web3?\n\nBy themselves, of course not. However, the applications of blockchain technology in real estate are endless. For example, it makes payments significantly easier, faster, and cheaper, resolves the need for inefficient record-keeping of physical papers, and gives us a verifiable method of tracking events over long periods of time. It\u2019s not so much a question of if real estate companies will begin using blockchain, but rather when it will become commonplace.\n\nAs our population becomes more comfortable with technology over time, it seems almost inevitable that blockchain technology will disrupt the real estate industry. With quality-of-life improvements from the ERC-4337 update such as account recovery and two-factor authentication, the path to uniting real estate and Web3 seems easier than ever before.\n\nWant more?

However, they remained far behind Ethereum. Meanwhile, as Ethereum ramps up preparations to enable staked Ether [stETH] withdrawal, traders seem to get involved in taking ETH positions.\n\nNot a question of \u201cOptions\u201d\n\nAccording to Glassnode, the options Open Interest (OI) across all exchanges had been increasing since 24 March. The options OI reveals the total amount of funds dedicated to opening options contracts.\n\nAnd, at press time, the metric was $7.56 billion. This indicated that traders are increasingly forecasting which direction ETH will head given the blockchain\u2019s forthcoming upgrade.\n\nFurthermore, the Ethereum fear and greed index was 61 out of a possible 100, at the time of writing. The indicator uses price volatility, market volume, and social trend data to assess if an asset is at a fair price.\n\nEthereum Fear and Greed Index is 61 \u2013 Greed\n\nCurrent price: $1,792https://t.co/w9g6chjUEShttps://t.co/9mfbj9d3uH pic.twitter.com/4be0oO6UxM \u2014 Ethereum Fear and Greed Index (@EthereumFear) March 31, 2023\n\nSo, the current condition implies that market mentions do not see a buying opportunity. Similarly, the sentiment does not expect a notable correction in the short term.\n\nHowever, institutions who trade Over The Counter (OTC) contracts seem not to share the same perceptions with the overall derivatives market. According to the CME Group, ETH\u2019s futures OI was down to 4,246 while the volume increased to 5,103 ETH.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nThe goal is to keep providing\n\nEither way, predicting ETH\u2019s price action around developments like this remains a dicey decision. In times past like the year of the Merge, several long positions were open. But unfortunately, most liquidated as the ETH price plunged.\n\nMoreover, the number of ETH 2.0 deposit contracts by staking providers had reached new peaks via different networks and exchanges. And, as expected Lido Finance [LDO] edged out every other protocol while Binance dominated exchange activity."

        "content": "The Ethereum Beacon Chain: Explained\n\nBy Gaurav Roy\n\nRead 7 min Medium\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS:\n\n\u2014 The Beacon Chain was the main component of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s transition from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS).\n\n\n\n\u2014 Ethereum\u2019s Beacon Chain helped improve the network\u2019s security and scalability by introducing staking and allowing for sharding implementation.\n\n\n\n\u2014This article provides a deeper understanding of Ethereum\u2019s core components, allowing for a better understanding of the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nIf you know anything about cryptocurrencies, you\u2019ve likely heard of what the Ethereum network is. But do you know how it works? Well, the Ethereum network is the second most popular cryptocurrency, and a true pioneer of blockchain use cases. However, did you know that Ethereum changed its whole consensus mechanism?\n\nThe move was dubbed \u201cEthereum 2.0\u201d and involved Ethereum transitioning from the legacy Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to an alternative system, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) in 2022.\n\nBut to do so it needed the help of a separate chain already using PoS. So, the Beacon Chain launched on December 1st, 2020 to facilitate that transition.\n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at what it was all about!\n\nWhat was the Ethereum Beacon Chain?\n\nThe Beacon Chain was the backbone of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s transition from PoW to PoS as it introduced PoS to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nIt was created to ensure the PoS consensus logic was sound and sustainable before it could be enabled on the Ethereum Mainnet. That\u2019s why it ran as a parallel chain to the original PoW Ethereum.\n\nWhat did the Beacon Chain do?\n\nA key piece of ETH 2.0, the Beacon Chain was responsible for establishing new parameters for governance, validator operations, staking rewards, and other changes related to the PoS system.\n\nThe Beacon Chain did not process any smart contract transactions. Rather conducted the network of Ethereum stakers before they started validating real Ethereum transactions. Besides overseeing validators and managing ETH, along with the formation of validator committees and recording their votes, it also monitored the behavior of the validators. It rewarded validators for their good behavior while penalizing malicious activity by slashing rewards.\n\nThe Merge: From Beacon Chain To Main Consensus\n\nTo switch from PoW to PoS on Ethereum, the Beacon chain had to be instructed to accept blockchain transactions from the original Ethereum chain. These transactions were then bundled into blocks and organized into a blockchain using the PoS consensus mechanism.\n\nAt the same time, the original Ethereum clients turned off their mining, block propagation, and consensus logic, handing all of that over to the Beacon Chain. This event was known as The Merge.\n\nIn Sept. 2022, the Beacon Chain was merged with the original PoW chain to formalize PoS as Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism. With The Merge upgrade, there were no longer two blockchains; just one PoS Ethereum chain that you can access with your Ethereum wallet.\n\nEthereum Proof of Stake (PoS)\n\nThe Ethereum PoS network is run by a group of validators, which are essentially \u201cvirtual miners\u201d. They run the consensus of Eth 2.0. These validators were originally activated by the Beacon Chain, the contents of which included a registry of validator addresses, the state of each validator, and attestations.\n\nTo secure the network, each validator had to stake 32 ETH into the smart contract. Then the Beacon Chain deactivated validators whose balance reached 16 ETH. Randomly chosen validators could then build a block each 12 seconds. At the merge, the Beacon chain became part of the new Ethereum PoS network, and its validators came along with it.\n\nThe Beacon Chain started with 21,063 validators. Post-merge, these are the validators of the Ethereum PoS network and there are over 500,000 of them.\n\nBeacon Chain Impact\n\nNow, let\u2019s see how it impacted the wider Ethereum network.\n\nSecurity: Staking on Ethereum\n\nIn introducing PoS to Ethereum, the Beacon Chain brought staking to the network. If you don\u2019t already know, check out the Ledger Academy article on what crypto staking is. But for the Ethereum network, it involves staking Ethereum by locking ETH in a deposit contract.\n\nAccording to data from Etherscan, the Ethereum Beacon Chain staking contract held more than 16 million ETH tokens at the time of the Merge, which is equivalent to over $22 billion, representing more than 13% of the coin\u2019s market cap.\n\nWhile staking has been live since Dec. 1, 2020, right from the Beacon Chain\u2019s initiation, staked ETH can\u2019t be withdrawn yet. This functionality is expected to be included in the next network upgrade, named Shanghai. The Shanghai upgrade will take place in April 2023, and it will finally allow participants to unlock their ETH.\n\nScalability: Sharding Ethereum Becomes Possible\n\nWith the Beacon Chain merged, the Ethereum community is now equipped to explore different ways of scaling the network.\n\nPreviously, scaling solutions involved rollups or sidechains.\n\nBlockchain rollups rely on the Ethereum mainnet for security, but they are capable of executing transactions outside the main chain. A good example of an Ethereum project using this scaling solution is Immutable X.\n\nThen, sidechains are independent blockchains that communicate with the main chain via a two-way bridge, such as how Polygon does with Ethereum.\n\nHowever, moving to a proof of stake consensus also allows the implementation of another scaling solution: Sharding. Sharding involves splitting the main Ethereum network into multiple chains called \u201cshards,\u201d with each shard chain having its independent state. This would allow the Ethereum network to process more transactions than it currently handles and dramatically improves its scalability.\n\nIt is a multi-phase upgrade that provides secure distribution of data storage requirements, enabling low crypto gas fees while leveraging the security of Ethereum.\n\nThe Future of Ethereum Upgrades\n\nThe Beacon Chain has made it possible for Ethereum to become one of the most secure and reliable blockchain networks in existence today. Co-founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin suggested that the Merge and then the Shanghai upgrade are by no means the end of the story for the Ethereum network. In the future, we may see major upgrades to the network\u2019s capabilities, from the Ethereum Virtual Machine to the network\u2019s very consensus."

        "content": "Crypto Staking is one of the blockchain industry\u2019s most misunderstood concepts. Staking has become a buzzword that entices holders and investors to lock up their tokens with the promise of generous passive income and crypto rewards.\n\nMany staking reward contracts and platforms don\u2019t technically offer any staking at all. You can\u2019t stake Bitcoin (BTC), for example, so take care around any provider who tells you it\u2019s possible.\n\nCrypto staking is a broad topic, with different blockchain networks living by slightly different staking rules. What is true for Ethereum (ETH) staking is not set in stone on Cardano (ADA).\n\nWith the SEC cracking down on crypto exchanges like Kraken and Coinbase over their staking programs, there\u2019s never been a better time to revisit the basics.\n\nWhat is staking in cryptocurrency? What on earth does Proof-of-Stake even mean and what are the risks?\n\nWhat Is Crypto Staking?\n\nStaking cryptocurrency is a popular way to earn passive income on your digital assets. Many crypto investors like to see it as a kind of savings account, where you can earn an attractive APY (annual percentage yield) by staking coins.\n\nDespite the inherent volatility of the crypto market, staking helps holders grow their crypto investment over a long period of time. They don\u2019t need to actively trade or inject fresh capital into their portfolio to increase their exposure.\n\nBut as the saying goes: \u2018There\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch.\u2019\n\nWhere do these generous interest rates and seemingly endless staking rewards come from?\n\nThe Proof-of-Stake Consensus Mechanism\n\nThe Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus is, unfortunately, not a group of friends that tell you whether or not your beef is rare or medium-rare. It\u2019s the process used by several blockchains to secure the network and produce new blocks.\n\nGenerally, a network validator is someone who locks up staking coins to a blockchain to help decentralize the network and verify transactions. For ensuring the security of the network and producing new blocks, validators earn staking rewards. These rewards are generally new tokens entering the supply based on the network\u2019s emission schedule.\n\nIn a Proof-of-Work blockchain, like Bitcoin, miners solve complex computational puzzles to compete for the right to create new blocks and earn mining rewards. This is why successful Bitcoin miners consume so much energy.\n\nSource: Ethereum\n\nTo give you an idea of just how much energy a PoW chain uses, Ethereum reduced its consumption by 99% after transitioning to a PoS consensus.\n\nOn the other hand, PoS chains randomly select a validator for each new block. This process uses considerably less energy than PoW and incentivizes crypto investors to stake more crypto assets, increasing their chances of winning the staking reward.\n\nThis exercise is a win-win, the blockchain attracts a greater variety of stakers and decentralizes network operation, while stakers earn cryptocurrency rewards and help support the ecosystem.\n\nHow Much Cryptocurrency Can I Earn Through Staking Rewards?\n\nCryptocurrency staking interest rates vary between different blockchains, providers and lock-up periods. Generally speaking, rewards fluctuate between 4-18% APY. Sites like StakingRewards.com aggregate data to tell us where the best pure staking opportunities are. However, it doesn\u2019t include options from centralized exchanges.\n\nIn some cases, cryptocurrency exchanges will offer staking rewards at boosted rates to entice holders to lock-up their staking coins for longer periods of time.\n\nFor example, this crypto exchange is offering 35% APY if we\u2019re willing to lock up our Cosmos (ATOM) tokens for 120 days, but just 1% for a flexible deposit.\n\nWhat Are the Risks of Staking?\n\nLike in every corner of the crypto space, staking comes with its own risks. For example, if you\u2019ve delegated your tokens to a bad validator, you might be at risk of \u2018slashing.\u2019 Slashing is a defense mechanism used by staking protocols to ensure that validators are behaving properly and fulfilling their tasks.\n\nIf a PolkaDot (DOT) validator is misbehaving and running malicious software, its stake is at risk of being \u2018slashed.\u2019 If this happens, a portion of their stake is forcibly removed and given to the protocol treasury.\n\nEach network and staking protocol has its own slashing rules, so if you\u2019re running a validator it\u2019s worth checking what might put you at risk.\n\nOther risks include loss of value due to price volatility. If you\u2019ve locked up your staking coins for a long period of time, you might find yourself unable to sell quickly in case of a black swan event.\n\nSource: CoinMarketCap\n\nRemember when LUNA crashed from $80 to a few cents in a few days? Thanks to the 14 day unlock period, thousands of LUNA stakers could do nothing but watch their holdings burn to the ground before their eyes.\n\nThe same goes for those who stake their coins through centralized exchanges. When FTX collapsed, anyone staking their crypto through FTX staking pools had zero access to their assets.\n\nCrypto Staking Myths and Misconceptions\n\nLike any misunderstood crypto topic, there is plenty of misinformation that can lead you astray. Some of this confusion is centered around the definition of staking drifting away from its original purpose and being loosely applied to any circumstance where you deposit tokens in exchange for rewards.\n\nLet\u2019s shed light on some of these misconceptions.\n\n\u201cI Can Stake My Tokens in DeFi Apps to Earn Other Tokens\u201d\n\nWhile you can deposit certain tokens in DeFi apps, like liquidity farms, to earn other tokens, this isn\u2019t technically staking. In this example, PancakeSwap says we can earn tokens by staking their native CAKE token in staking pools.\n\nWhat we\u2019re actually doing here is depositing CAKE into a smart contract and earning emissions of other tokens. We\u2019re not helping to secure the non-existent CAKE blockchain. DeFi apps like PancakeSwap offer these \u2018staking pools\u2019 because it brings utility and demand to the CAKE token.\n\n\u201cStaking My Tokens Means I Don\u2019t Control Them Anymore\u201d\n\nIn many cases, staking cryptocurrency means delegating them to a validator who uses them on your behalf. However some networks, like Cardano, don\u2019t follow this rule.\n\nStaked ADA never leaves your crypto wallet, making it one of the most secure staking protocols in the market.\n\n\u201cStaking Rewards Are Fixed and Accurate\u201d\n\nJust because staking emissions are fixed and regular, doesn\u2019t guarantee that your validator will be randomly selected and receive their estimated rewards. This is a question of statistics more than anything, so if you\u2019re staking long term, you probably won\u2019t even notice.\n\nSource: Solana Docs\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that staking APY doesn\u2019t take into account token inflation and emissions. For example, Solana\u2019s token inflationary emission rate means that SOL\u2019s supply increases by anywhere from 1.5-5% each year.\n\nEven though you might be earning 6-8% APY by staking SOL, the supply is still inflating and potentially losing value. Some crypto enthusiasts prefer to calculate their staking rewards by subtracting a tokens inflation rate from the original APY.\n\n\u201cI Can Stake NFTs to Earn Crypto Tokens\u201d\n\nLike PancakeSwap, this is a liberal use of the phrase \u2018Stake.\u2019 Yes, you can deposit your Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT into a smart contract to earn $APE tokens, but you\u2019re not helping anyone secure the network and produce new blocks.\n\nCyberkongz earn $BANANA, DeGods earn $DUST, Neo Tokyo Citizens earn $BYTES, the list goes on. Why do so many NFT collections do this?\n\nDepositing NFTs in staking contracts takes them off the market and makes the available supply look scarcer. A collection with only 2% of its total supply listed looks like a much more desirable asset than a collection with 20% of its pieces up for sale.\n\nCrypto Staking Pros and Cons\n\nCryptocurrency staking is a pretty nuanced subject, with a lot of moving parts and specific rules. To make it easier to wrap your head around why staking might be interesting to you specifically, here are the benefits and drawbacks.\n\nPros\n\nPassive Income \u2013 Cryptocurrency staking is a great way to earn passive income and organically grow your holdings with minimal risk.\n\n\u2013 Cryptocurrency staking is a great way to earn passive income and organically grow your holdings with minimal risk.

This also helps to distribute ownership and governance of the chain itself. Increase token scarcity \u2013 Staking cryptocurrency takes your coins off the market and reduces the number of tokens available for buyers. In a bullish market scenario, this creates a good environment for price appreciation.\n\nCons\n\nLock up periods \u2013 To get the juiciest staking rewards, you\u2019ll usually need to lock up your tokens for a long period of time. This is problematic if you find yourself needing to sell quickly\n\n\u2013 To get the juiciest staking rewards, you\u2019ll usually need to lock up your tokens for a long period of time. This is problematic if you find yourself needing to sell quickly Relinquish full control of your funds \u2013 In most cases, staking means you need to deposit your crypto into a staking contract. To be honest, this sounds a lot scarier than it really is. Slashing and validator hacks are uncommon, and operators have a vested interest in the security of the chain they\u2019re validating.\n\nHow Can I Start Staking My Cryptocurrency?\n\nAlmost every crypto exchange under the sun offers staking in some shape or form. If you want to get started with crypto staking for the first time, this is by far the easiest method.\n\nYour preferred crypto exchange should have an \u2018Earn\u2019 section where you can browse available staking subscriptions. All you need to do is search for the crypto you\u2019d like to stake and choose a lock-up period that you\u2019re happy with.\n\nRunning your own validator is a different story. This can be quite complicated, especially if you don\u2019t have a background in development. The best place to start looking for answers is in the developer documents of the blockchain of your choice.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nCrypto staking, like any financial growth strategy, has its risks. Everyone loves getting free cryptocurrency, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you should trust everything at face value. Take care when choosing your staking provider.\n\nAs explained above, the term \u2018Staking\u2019 has drifted away from its technical definition. These days, staking is used to describe most circumstances where you deposit digital assets in exchange for some kind of token reward, rather than contributing to a Proof-of-Stake network.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nStaking your cryptocurrency helps decentralize and support your favorite blockchain ecosystem while rewarding you with tokens. It\u2019s important to understand what staking is and how it works to ensure that you\u2019re \u2018putting your crypto to work\u2019 safely.\n\nFAQs"

        "content": "Revolutionary Meme Coin Presale Dogetti (DETI) has announced an upcoming community challenge on Twitter! With the community in mind, its worth trying to understand why community is such an important part of Dogetti\u2019s goals, as well as why community support is necessary for the success of a project as a whole by taking a look at two top altcoins that owe a lot of their achievements to the community, Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTE).\n\nEthereum\u2019s Community\n\nAs the biggest blockchain network in the world and the second highest ranking crypto on the market, Ethereum has always been a huge project that attracts many to it. Regardless of its recognisability, it actually has proven utility that stretches across multiple different projects as the host to most of the other coins alongside its own native Ether. On top of that, it has acted as inspiration for all of the blockchain network and protocol projects that have followed it such as Solana (SOL) and Polygon (MATIC). With such a necessary function that has led to a substantial amount of the market\u2019s growth, Ethereum would\u2019ve likely been a high-ranking project anyway, but it probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten to where it is today without its community.\n\nWith a dedicated community hub that allows the hundreds of thousands of crypto enthusiasts involved in Ethereum to communicate and take part in the improvement of the network, Ethereum has managed to consistently make improvements based on its users\u2019 wants and needs. The team also regularly interacts with the community, creating a real sense of personal connection.\n\nLitecoin\u2019s Community\n\nLitecoin is a crypto that has had an interesting journey regarding its growth towards becoming the strongest Bitcoin fork available. On the market for over a decade and regularly moving up and down in the top 20 ranked crypto, Litecoin has proven itself to be a success but at times struggles to remain stable. Despite this, its community sticks beside it throughout it all. As a peer-to-peer platform, personal involvement is inherent to its functionality, which is why the community continue to work together to keep it strong. This has especially worked out so far this year, with Litecoin experiencing multiple spikes over the past few months.\n\nDogetti\u2019s Community\n\nIf you take anything from the Dogetti presale, it is that community is the MOST important thing to the project. Calling its community the \u201cDogetti Family\u201d, the team wants to instil a shared feeling of real comradery among the members of it, where they all work together to send Dogetti to the top of the meme coin space. Both owned and controlled by this community, they will have a say in every move that is made to make sure this vision becomes a reality. In return, 6% of the overall token supply will be redistributed, with 2% of that being extra tokens given to holders simply for being members of the community!\n\nFor More Information On Dogetti (DETI):\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The Ethereum blockchain would expand to a three-layer client.\n\nLatency and data efficiency remained a problem.\n\nEthereum [ETH], plagued by transaction delays and network congestion a few years back, has been on top of solving these challenges, thanks to the plethora of scaling solutions. The last of these is the zero-knowledge integration with the Ethereum Virtual Machine [zkEVM], launched by Polygon [MATIC].\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nAlthough the Mainnet Beta was inaugurated on 27 March, not many intended participants understand how the L1 project would interact with its L2 counterpart. Due to this blurred view, Vitalik Buterin released a blog post concerning the matter.\n\nIt\u2019s time for a sharing formula\n\nAccording to the Ethereum co-founder, the project\u2019s nodes consisting of the consensus and execution client have been reduced to allow for zkEVM participation. The execution client uses the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism to validate data on the blockchain. Conversely, the consensus client is responsible for maintaining the latest database and executing transactions.\n\nNormally, these clients account for two-thirds of the network. But with the introduction of the zk rollups have ensured that it is not the case anymore. Therefore, allowing developers to intervene while the chain stops finalizing blocks. Vitalk noted,\n\n\u201cAs of today, no consensus or execution client makes up more than 2/3 of the network.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Vitalik pointed out that the space freed would mean that zkEVM becomes the third Ethereum client. However, he noted that it won\u2019t be as immediate since the L1 needs to work on using them for verification to verify execution.\n\nOf challenges and fixes\n\nDespite the zk capability, Vitalik mentioned that there were problems that no L2 could solve. He mentioned the latency challenge, which could allow disruption of the chain after a late published block. And data efficiency, which could expose validator signatures. However, he cited that there were possible solutions in the long-term saying,\n\n\u201cThe latency challenge could be addressed by being careful when designing the single-slot finality protocol. The data efficiency issue would have to be addressed by having a separate protocol for aggregating verification-related data.\u201d\n\nFurther insights into the publication made mention of the zk Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARKS). As zk proofs allow parties to verify a true statement without revealing any other information, zk-SNARKS allows proof of possession with no interaction between the prover and verifier.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nAs Vitalik puts it, the zk-sNARKS and ERC-4337, which makes it possible to create and transact contracts on the blockchain, could also solve the data efficiency issue.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum head conceded that the whole process would take a long time to become reality. He also admitted that slow block execution and verification could be a problem in the initial stages."

        "title": "What is the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade? - Ledger",
        "content": "What is the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nBy Gaurav Roy\n\nRead 7 min Medium\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: \u2014 The Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade is the next major upgrade after \u2018The Merge\u2019 and it\u2019s scheduled for April 12th.\n\n\n\n\u2014 This upgrade will introduce the ability to withdraw staked ETH and rewards from the Beacon Chain.\n\n\n\n\u2014More upgrades are scheduled to improve Ethereum\u2019s scalability, security, and sustainability.\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum network launched in 2015 using a proof of work consensus, much like Bitcoin. However, unlike Bitcoin, it can execute smart contracts. This functionality meant more and more projects joined the network. As a result, the Ethereum network became busy, which made transactions both slow and expensive. Ethereum was facing a scalability issue.\n\nSo, you might be thinking \u201cCan\u2019t you just improve the network to handle more data?\u201d And you\u2019d be right because you can\u2026but it\u2019s not that simple.\n\nTo explain, improving the scalability of a blockchain also impacts its decentralization and security. This is what the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, coined \u2018The Blockchain Trilemma\u2019. Essentially, Ethereum chose to solve this problem by changing its whole consensus mechanism from Proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nThe History of Ethereum Upgrades\n\nThe concept of a PoS Ethereum was originally called ETH 2.0. But to transition to its new state, Ethereum needed the help of a separate chain that used a PoS consensus. This was named the \u2018Beacon Chain\u2019.\n\nTo explain, PoS blockchains require users to stake their ETH to secure the network. Then these validators have the power to create new blocks and secure the network. In return for their stake, they receive ETH rewards.\n\nSpecifically, the Beacon Chain required users to stake 32ETH to become a validator. However, the validators on the Beacon chain could not unstake this ETH or receive their rewards until it merged with the mainnet. The Merge took place in September 2022 and following that, the beacon chain became part of the new PoS Ethereum mainnet. However, the staked ETH remained locked up.\n\nWhat is the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade is the next major upgrade after \u201cThe Merge\u201d. Also known as the Shapella upgrade, the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade is an important step towards the continued development of the Ethereum protocol. In short, it finalizes Ethereum\u2019s move from PoW to PoS.\n\nWhat does the Shanghai upgrade mean for the Ethereum Ecosystem?\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade has the potential to increase accessibility and flexibility for users and improve the overall scalability and security of the network. Plus, it opens the door to new developments in Ethereum\u2019s future. However, the main impact will be the ability to withdraw staked ETH from the Beacon Chain \u2013 the feature everyone has been waiting for.\n\nUnstaking ETH from the Beacon Chain\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade will allow the phased withdrawal of Ether (ETH). In short, the upcoming upgrade will allow validators to withdraw their ETH and cash out their rewards.\n\nSince many participants staked their ETH and nobody could withdraw it, there\u2019s a lot of liquidity at stake. To avoid transactional chaos, there will be some limits. For example, there will be a limit on the number of withdrawals in each block. Fortunately for validators though, they won\u2019t have to pay gas fees to withdraw.\n\nThose who wish to withdraw their ETH have two options \u2013 partial withdrawals or full withdrawals. Partial withdrawals involve withdrawing only the rewards, which can be withdrawn to any Ethereum wallet. However, the validator account will still be active on the beacon chain, and you will continue to validate transactions as usual.\n\nA full withdrawal, on the other hand, involves withdrawing your entire staked balance, including the 32 ETH required to become a validator, plus any rewards earned. To initiate a full withdrawal, you must submit a voluntary exit message with your validator keys. This message will start the process of exiting from staking, and your validator account will be placed in the exit queue. The time it takes to exit will depend on how many others are planning to do the same thing.\n\nOnce the exit process is complete, your validator account will no longer be responsible for validating transactions, and you will no longer be eligible for rewards. At this point, your account status changes to \u201cwithdrawable,\u201d and you can provide your withdrawal credentials.\n\nFollowing that, you\u2019ll receive your full account balance at the withdrawal address.\n\nWill the Shanghai Upgrade Impact ETH Price?\n\nThere is no way of telling if the Shanghai Upgrade will impact the price positively or negatively.\n\nHowever, upgrades to the Ethereum network often create a buzz that can increase demand. Furthermore, as the Ethereum network becomes more efficient and accessible, it attracts more users. With increased network functionality, new use cases arise. And this innovation usually leads to further demand. So perhaps, the Shanghai upgrade will spark off a whole new wave of Ethereum projects bringing something new to the table. Since ETH has been deflationary since the Merge, some believe it could lead to bullish price action.\n\nOn the other hand, some anticipate a selling wave as unlocking staked ETH will increase the circulating supply of ETH. This could potentially lead to a decrease in price due to selling pressure. However, Ethereum has a staking ratio of 14%, meaning only that percentage of its circulating supply is locked up. That might not mean much to you, but it\u2019s much less than the Solana network\u2019s 70%.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s important to approach any speculation about the impact of the upgrade on ETH price with caution, as market dynamics are complex and can be difficult to predict with certainty. One thing is certain, though, approximately 1 million ETH in rewards will be available for withdrawal once the upgrade goes live.\n\nWhat Else Could The Upgrade Impact?\n\nThe Shanghai Upgrade may also impact liquid staking services like Rocketpool and Lido. But why?\n\nWell, staking on Ethereum requires you to lock up 32ETH for a specific length of time. For example, Kiln uses this method to allow users to fund a validator through Ledger Live and earn rewards.\n\nLiquid staking services, however, allow you to unstake at any time. However, instead of unstaking ETH, you get a token representing the staked ETH instead. You can use these tokens to participate in various DeFi activities just like regular ETH. But in fact, the service still has the staked ETH. Considering liquid staking accounts for 41.69% of the ETH staking market share, and there will be so much ETH flooding into the market, it may impact the price of these platforms\u2019 tokens. That said, how the upgrade will affect these platforms and the wider ecosystem is still hard to predict.\n\nWhen will the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade happen?\n\nThe last test before the upgrade took place on 28th February, when the Goerli Test network forked successfully. While it processed deposits just fine, the test wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing. Allegedly, some validators did not update their client software, leading to a small delay. That said, the rest of the event was a success, with the mainnet upgrade scheduled for some time in April.\n\nThe Next Ethereum Upgrade: EOF\n\nAfter Shanghai, Ethereum will prepare for its next big change: The EOF upgrade. To explain, EOF stands for EVM Object Format. While its name is very technical, the upgrade itself will allow for practical functionality.\n\nIn short, the upgrade will focus on improving the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This is the virtual machine responsible for executing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. If you want to learn more, check out the Academy article on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. But without getting too technical, the EOF upgrade is the first major upgrade to the EVM since its inception in 2015.\n\nIt consists of five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that aim to make EVM execution more efficient and easily upgradeable. It will introduce a new binary format for smart contracts, making it easier to create, execute, and upgrade them. This will ultimately lead to better performance and more efficient use of resources on the Ethereum network.\n\nHowever, the EOF upgrade has been delayed and will launch a few months after the Shanghai Upgrade.\n\nLaying the Foundation for Sharding\n\nEOF will allow the Ethereum network to implement sharding. To explain, sharding is a scaling solution that will dramatically improve Ethereum\u2019s capacity, gas cost, and transaction speed. Sharding allows for the parallel processing of transactions across multiple shards or smaller partitions of the Ethereum network. By using sharding, the Ethereum network can handle significantly more transactions per second (TPS) than it currently does, making it more suitable for widespread use in mainstream applications.\n\nFuture Ethereum Upgrades\n\nBesides Shanghai and EOF upgrades, Ethereum has several other major upgrades in the pipeline. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin stated ETH\u2019s transition to Ethereum 2.0 is only 55% completed after the merge.\n\nSo, the future Ethereum upgrades include the following:\n\nSurge \u2013 This will bring sharding to Ethereum later this year, leading to improvements in scalability, gas costs, and transaction speeds.\n\nVerge \u2013 This one will focus on optimizing storage on the network and reducing node size to improve scalability further.\n\nPurge \u2013 This will help reduce the amount of space required to store ETH on a hard drive, freeing up space for developers.\n\nScourge \u2013 This one aims to provide censorship resistance and avoid centralization and other risks associated with MEV.\n\nSplurge \u2013 This upgrade includes various miscellaneous innovations to make Ethereum better.\n\nThere is no concrete schedule for these upgrades yet, but they may be completed around 2025.\n\nHow to Stay Safe when Interacting with the Ethereum Network?\n\nStaking ETH doesn\u2019t have to be difficult. For those ready to get stuck in already, you can also find staking options directly through Ledger Live.\n\nVia the discover feature, you can fund a validator and earn rewards with Kiln. Or you could even take part in Liquid Ethereum staking with Lido.\n\nThe Ethereum Network is at your fingertips through the power of the Ledger Ecosystem. Firstly, you can also access countless blockchain apps directly through Ledger Live.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThis week in coins. Illustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nThe news earlier this week that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is suing the largest crypto exchange in the world, Binance, and its CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao, could have rocked crypto markets.\n\nInstead, the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum briefly wobbled after the news broke on Monday, then recovered. Bitcoin (BTC) is up 3% over the past week to $28,410 as of Saturday morning, and Ethereum (ETH) is up 4.2% to $1,825.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMost of the top thirty cryptocurrencies are in the same boat, with no substantial change in either direction over the last seven days, but two names posted hefty rallies: Stellar (XLM) leaped 22% and currently trades at nearly $0.11, while XRP blew up 20% to $0.53 thanks to \"investor hope\" among the XRP army that Ripple's endless case with the SEC might go Ripple's way.\n\nThe CFTC is the United States\u2019 leading derivatives regulator. According to the lawsuit filed with a Chicago federal court, the federal agency accuses Binance of unauthorized derivatives trading by offering futures, swaps, and options on many leading cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe suit claims the exchange is offering these services to U.S. clientele despite not having registered with the regulator. It added: \u201cBinance has taken a calculated, phased approach to increase its United States presence despite publicly stating its purported intent to \u2018block\u2019 or \u2018restrict\u2019 customers located in the United States from accessing its platform.\u201d\n\nOther allegations in the suit accuse the exchange of having insufficient anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) controls, knowingly evading or helping U.S. clients evade regulators, and, rather damningly, trading against its own customers.\n\nFor its part, Binance told Decrypt on Monday that the lawsuit is: \u201cunexpected and disappointing as we have been working collaboratively with the CFTC for more than two years.\u201d\n\nCoin politics\n\nOn Wednesday the state of Texas introduced Senate Bill 1751, a bill that seeks to protect the state\u2019s grid during peak electricity loads, but the proposal could mean that local mining operations may soon lack the incentives that have made the state an attractive location for miners.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe bill restricts Bitcoin miners from participating in a state-run demand response program that rewards miners for giving power back to the grid at peak times.\n\nIt also blocks \"virtual currency mining from tax abatements given that the large scale of growth in virtual currency mining is already projected to occur in the state,\u201d according to the bill\u2019s sponsor Senator Lois Kolkhorst during Tuesday's testimony, who argued there\u2019s no need to subsidize the growth.\n\nThat same day U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler testified at the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government and said that rules for making crypto compliant already exist\u2014in response to repeated calls by the industry for clearer guidelines\u2014but that the industry is still \u201crife with noncompliance.\u201d\n\nDuring the hearing, Gensler stuck to his guns in reiterating his belief that most cryptocurrencies are unlicensed securities: \u201cFrankly, of the ten or twelve thousand tokens, there are very few that don\u2019t have a group of entrepreneurs in the middle that the public is counting on. Those are securities under the securities law.\u201d\n\nFinally, across the pond, the Bank of England\u2019s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) lead Katie Fortune said that CBDC\u2019s can be a \u201cbridging asset\u201d between TradFi and crypto.\n\nCBDC\u2019s are an envisioned form of centrally-issued cryptocurrency pegged and backed by the state currency, in this case, a digital sterling.\n\nIn a talk at the Citi Digital Money Symposium, she said: \u201cWhat you have today is, I have a Santander account, I can go to a cash machine and take out the same cash my friend with a Barclays account takes out. I think that could be really powerful in a world of stablecoins and other digital forms of money to have a central bank digital currency that can be a bridging asset between all these different forms of money.\""

        "content": "DeGods NFT migrated to Ethereum from Solana, with slow sales and declining activity.\n\nY00ts NFT collection saw a successful start on Polygon, while trade volume increased on both Ethereum and Solana.\n\nDeGods NFT has officially moved to the Ethereum [ETH] network, leaving Solana [SOL] behind. The migration was not without controversy, as it involved a couple of challenges from the Dust Labs.\n\nIn the last 24 hours since the migration, the impact on Ethereum NFT trading volume was closely monitored to assess how DeGods NFT has fared in its new home.\n\nDeGods makes a move to Ethereum\n\nDeGods has made good on its previous announcement by beginning its migration from Solana to Ethereum on 1 April, 2023. The project had pledged to cover gas fees for the first 24 hours of the migration to smooth the transition.\n\nYou can now migrate your DeGods to Ethereum.https://t.co/xn9gOwqn69 pic.twitter.com/keAVf8Hejd \u2014 DeGods III (@DeGodsNFT) April 1, 2023\n\nFor those who prefer to skip the queue and speed up their migration, the user will cover the gas fees. This approach aims to make the process as seamless as possible while giving users the option to prioritize their migration if they choose.\n\nLast year, Dust Labs made a surprising announcement regarding the migration of DeGods and y00ts from Solana to Ethereum and Polygon, respectively. According to project leader Frank DeGods, this move was motivated by a desire to explore new opportunities.\n\nThe decision to shift away from Solana\u2019s blockchain was likely influenced by the platform\u2019s challenges over the past year.\n\nHow DeGods fared so far\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, sales for DeGods on the Ethereum network have been relatively slow. As of this writing, the project has only achieved a trading volume of around 0.5%, with 17 sales representing roughly 6%.\n\nHowever, there is a silver lining, as the number of owners has already exceeded 700. While these figures may not be as impressive as some other NFT projects, it\u2019s important to remember that DeGods has only just migrated to the Ethereum network.\n\nAn analysis of Unique Active Wallets (UAW), transactions and volume data on DappRadar revealed that DeGods experienced a decline in activity. According to the graph, the most recent recorded activity was on March 26. The decline could be due to various factors, such as the migration to Ethereum or changes in market sentiment.\n\nIn contrast, the y00ts NFT collection enjoyed a successful start on the Polygon network.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap\u2019s latest data, the project achieved impressive results within a 24-hour timeframe. The volume increased by over 190%, while sales more than doubled. Additionally, the project has already attracted over 1,300 owners.\n\nImpact on Solana and Ethereum NFT trades\n\nData from Santiment indicated that there has been a notable increase in NFT trade volume in USD on both Solana and Ethereum. As of this writing, the trade volume on Solana reached approximately $5.4 million. Moreover, there was a visible spike in NFT trade volume on the Solana network since 17 March.\n\nIn addition to Solana, the Ethereum network has also seen a noticeable increase in NFT trade volume since 17 March, according to Santiment\u2019s data. As of this writing, the NFT trade volume in USD on Ethereum reached around $7.8 million."
