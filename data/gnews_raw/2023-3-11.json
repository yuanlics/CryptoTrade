        "title": "What Is Ethereum? Blockchain's Future of Finance Explained - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is the second largest crypto by market capitalization, second only to Bitcoin (BTC). While Bitcoin is undeniably revolutionary, Ethereum has reimagined the real-world use cases of blockchain and cryptocurrency.\n\nIf Bitcoin lets you be your own bank, Ethereum takes things further. Fully decentralized and open-source, the Ethereum network aims to liberate millions of people worldwide from the grip of centralized entities.\n\nSimple dApps within the ecosystem give you complete control of your assets and empower users to manage their finances through lending, borrowing, and trading. You can play engaging games and even collect provably unique digital art and store it on secure decentralized servers.\n\nHow does the Ethereum blockchain make all this possible? What exactly is a smart contract, and why are they so important?\n\nIntroducing Ethereum, the future of finance and the next generation of the internet.\n\nAbout Ethereum\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain network that gives users full custody of their assets and hosts apps, organizations, and peer-to-peer transactions on a publicly verifiable network. The Ethereum mainnet has no centralized owner. Instead, it\u2019s governed by a community of users and powered by Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the network.\n\nAnyone can build an application or use the network at any time. The Ethereum blockchain is permissionless, meaning that no centralized body can stop me if I want to send cryptocurrency to a friend, trade tokens on a decentralized exchange, or store data on-chain. Even the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit that helps develop and guide Ethereum\u2019s growth, doesn\u2019t have the power to censor how the network is used.\n\nLike Bitcoin, the Ethereum blockchain offers anonymity. No invasive KYC procedures need to be completed before using the network, and you don\u2019t need to provide any personal details before storing your funds securely on-chain.\n\nHow does a network with no owner operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, without interference or a centralized service managing everything?\n\nHow Does Ethereum Work?\n\nThe Ethereum network is a public blockchain supported by thousands of independent computers worldwide. Each participant is called a \u2018Node\u2019 and helps secure the Ethereum blockchain. This decentralized system is more stable and reliable than centralized systems because a single point of failure does not threaten it.\n\nFor example, take the diagram below. If the central piece of the centralized network suffers an outage, none of the other participants can communicate with each other. In a decentralized system, plenty of other interconnected nodes will step up and support the network if any nodes fail.\n\nDuring The Merge, a network upgrade completed in September 2022, Ethereum migrated to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Ethereum\u2019s PoS mechanism randomly selects validators to produce new blocks and secure the network. This is a more energy-efficient model than its original Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism, which demands high computational power.\n\nNode operators are responsible for securing the Ethereum mainnet, processing transactions, and creating new blocks. As a reward for their services, these validators earn Ether tokens. Ether is valuable because users need it to pay transaction fees on the Ethereum network. However, ETH can also be sold on the crypto market in exchange for fiat currencies, like USD.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking; this sounds remarkably similar to Bitcoin or XRP. However, one key difference gives the Ethereum blockchain a greater variety of use cases than its predecessor.\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a computational state that manages the network. Essentially, the environment houses all accounts and smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Most Ethereum smart contracts are written in Solidity, the network\u2019s dominant programming language.\n\nPut simply, a smart contract is a line of code stored in blockchain programs and applications that execute when certain conditions are met. Smart contracts automate agreements between users in permissionless, anonymous environments, leading to greater trust and security on the network.\n\nThe easiest way to understand smart contracts is to imagine a vending machine. I enter an automated contract if I want a drink from the machine.\n\nI provide money and choose my drink, providing my side of our agreement .\n\n. The vending machine accepts my money and automatically dispenses my drink, providing its side of our agreement.\n\nSmart contracts allow Ethereum users to manage their cryptocurrencies more efficiently. They remove the need for intermediaries to oversee transactions. There is no room for human bias or error. Moreover, anyone can view the contract and verify its safety. In many ways, smart contracts add a layer of law and order to blockchain\u2019s private and anonymous world.\n\nWhy is this important? What does Ethereum offer that traditional services cannot?\n\nWhat Can I Do On The Ethereum Blockchain?\n\nThe Ethereum network is home to a rapidly expanding suite of apps and programs. Innovation and creativity are fully displayed in Web3, with new use cases being discovered and unveiled daily.\n\nDecentralized Finance\n\nFirst and foremost, the world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is one of the most widespread use cases of the Ethereum blockchain. DeFi apps like Uniswap allow traders to swap ERC-20 crypto tokens with liquidity pools on-chain instantly. This not only gives traders access to a wider range of cryptocurrencies, but it also gives emerging Web3 startups a place to list their tokens without needing to pay a centralized exchange costly listing fees.\n\nLending and borrowing platforms like AAVE let DeFi users maximize their crypto holdings. In the same way, property owners can take out a loan against their house, apps like AAVE let holders get instant access to funds without selling their crypto. On the other hand, lenders can loan out their ETH and other cryptos to earn interest on their holdings in real-time.\n\nImagine trying to do any of this in traditional finance. Getting approved for a loan can take months and come with high fees from intermediaries like banks. Human bias also comes into play, and you have no way of knowing whether your loan will be approved. DeFi on Ethereum fixes this and levels the playing field. Anyone can access financial tools regardless of their funds, credit, or status.\n\nNFTs\n\nNon-fungible tokens have come a long way. While originally, NFTs were considered to be nothing more than flexes and digital art pieces, NFT utilities are evolving in earnest. Some of the world\u2019s biggest brands, like Adidas and Porsche, are incorporating NFT technology into their businesses. TravelX, a Latin American travel company, is developing NFT flight ticketing services.\n\nEthereum is the home of NFT culture. The network allows anyone to mint an NFT, whether a document containing important information or a unique masterpiece of digital art. Creator royalties on NFT collections mean that artists will receive ongoing fair value for their work, even years after it was originally sold.\n\nData Storage & Decentralized Governance\n\nStoring data on the Ethereum blockchain is a solution for users wanting decentralized and immutable storage options. Data stored on Ethereum is distributed across a network of computers, making it more resistant to hacking. Moreover, once data is stored on the Ethereum blockchain it\u2019s immutable. It cannot be altered or deleted, providing a tamper-proof data record.\n\nEthereum data can be accessed and used by other decentralized applications within the ecosystem, enabling seamless integration between different Ethereum-based applications and programs.\n\nBy tokenizing assets on Ethereum, groups of individuals can form a DAO or a decentralized autonomous organization. Many decentralized platforms are governed by DAOs, who vote on development proposals and the community decisions that shape the protocol\u2019s future.\n\nEthereum itself is governed in this way. Every decision that influences the future development of Ethereum is voted on by its community of Ether holders.\n\nThe Birth of Ethereum\n\nThe idea of Ethereum was first conceived by Vitalik Buterin when he was just a teenager. At the time, Buterin was a talented computer programmer and co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine. Buterin envisioned greater utility for blockchain technology beyond what Bitcoin could.\n\nHe published the first Ethereum whitepaper in 2014, which attracted the attention of other industry big brains like Gavin Wood and Charles Hoskinson.\n\nIn 2014, Buterin brought his idea for the world\u2019s first smart contract-capable blockchain to the Bitcoin conference in Miami. The concept was met with enthusiasm, and the Ethereum founders hosted an ICO (initial coin offering), raising over $18 million in BTC.\n\nThe first iteration of the Ethereum mainnet, Frontier, officially went live in July 2015.\n\nEthereum 2.0 (Serenity)\n\nWhile Ethereum is in itself a revolutionary technology, it is not without its flaws. Ethereum\u2019s biggest issue is undoubtedly its scalability. The Ethereum network has congestion issues, like slow transaction speeds and high gas fees.\n\nTo address these problems, Vitalik and the Ethereum Foundation proposed a series of upgrades to the network. These Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) aim to reinvent the network into a more scalable and secure blockchain. While it\u2019s most commonly referred to as ETH 2.0, the official name for the upgraded network is Ethereum Serenity.\n\nThere have been plenty of Ethereum upgrades over the years. However, the most important have been listed below.\n\nBeacon Chain\n\nEthereum was originally a Proof-of-Work blockchain. Vitalik and the Ethereum Foundation proposed migrating to a Proof-of-Stake consensus to achieve true scalability and reduce energy consumption.\n\nFollowing the approval of the proposal by the community, Vitalik, and the Ethereum foundation deployed the Beacon Chain in December 2020. Essentially, the Beacon Chain ran alongside the Ethereum main chain, testing how the PoS consensus would work within Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure and laying a foundation for the Merge.\n\nLondon Hard Fork (EIP 1559)\n\nThe London Hard Fork is a significant milestone for the Ethereum ecosystem. It introduced a deflationary mechanism that burned a small percentage of Ethereum transaction fees. This was introduced to counteract Ether\u2019s inflationary validator rewards system.\n\nSource: UltraSoundMoney\n\nSince the London Hard Fork, over 46,000 ETH has been burnt. This represents over $71 million at the current ETH price. Investors expect that the ongoing effects of the London upgrade will be positive for Ethereum price as the token supply becomes more scarce.\n\nThe Merge\n\nPerhaps the biggest upgrade Ethereum ever witnessed occurred in September 2022. As the name would suggest, the Merge represented the key moment when Ethereum\u2019s existing PoW chain merged with the Beacon Chain, Ethereum\u2019s preparatory PoS chain.\n\nSource: Ethereum\n\nFollowing The Merge, Ethereum became a far more energy-efficient network. The upgrade reduced Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption by 99.95% and the earth\u2019s total usage by around 1%. The transition to a PoS consensus has also enabled the network to implement Sharding, a scaling solution that will increase Ethereum\u2019s transaction throughput and processing speeds.\n\nShanghai Upgrade (EIP 4985)\n\nAs part of the earlier Beacon Chain and Merge upgrades, Ethereum holders staked their ETH in locked contracts to help secure the network during the transition. Scheduled for early 2023, the Shanghai upgrade will release the staked ETH back to providers over time and aims to reduce transaction fees on the network.\n\nIt is expected that over 17 million ETH will be unlocked in the weeks following the Shanghai Hard Fork.\n\nOn The Flipside\n\nSince Ethereum first launched back in 2015, many other \u2018Ethereum-Killer\u2019 blockchains have emerged to compete with the market leader. These include popular networks like Cardano, BNB Chain, and Solana.\n\nWhile these competitors haven\u2019t been able to reach ETH in terms of market cap, they have proven themselves as faster and more affordable alternatives.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nEthereum is the world\u2019s first blockchain that supports smart contracts and introduced concepts like DeFi and NFTs to the masses. It\u2019s by far the most adopted Layer 1 blockchain in the industry.\n\nFAQs"

        "content": "Crypto advocacy group Coin Center spelling out why it believes Ethereum (ETH) is not a security, despite claims to the contrary coming from New York Attorney General (NYAG) Letitia James.\n\nIn a new lawsuit against the crypto exchange Kucoin, Attorney General James argues Ethereum is a security that relies on the efforts of third-party developers to generate profits for its holders.\n\nThe Attorney General calls ETH \u201ca speculative asset\u201d and placed the leading smart contract platform in a group with the collapsed crypto project Terra (LUNA) and its algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST).\n\nCoin Center\u2019s director of communications Neeraj Agrawal refutes the NYAG\u2019s assertions and says the think tank\u2019s view on Ethereum remains unchanged.\n\n\u201cObviously, we disagree with the NYAG\u2019s argument that ETH is a security. Coin Center will be monitoring the case and if there\u2019s an opportunity to weigh in, we will.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, Coin Center published a blog post explaining why it believes Ethereum is not a security. The group argued that while Ethereum may have met one of the prongs of the Howey test when it was issued in 2014, ETH in its current form today is not a security.\n\nUnder the Howey framework, a transaction represents an \u201cinvestment contract\u201d if a person \u201cinvests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter, sponsor or other third party.\u201d\n\nAccording to Coin Center, Ethereum in its current iteration is \u201ctoo useful and too decentralized\u201d and that ETH\u2019s value does not rely on the efforts of a discernible third party to generate profits.\n\n\u201cThe value of Ether and the functionality of the Ethereum network is not reliant on the [Ethereum] Foundation, rather it flows from the efforts of thousands of unaffiliated developers, miners, and users\u2026\n\nConflating the pre-sale and the running network is confused analysis that could be misunderstanding the tech or the law or both.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $1,466.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Can Ethereum Reach $4,000 Again? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Although it might feel like eons, it was just a year and a half ago when Ethereum (ETH 1.46%) reached its all-time high of $4,644.33. Since then, a brutal crypto winter has left its mark on the industry as the entire landscape has changed dramatically. In the midst of this bear market, Ethereum lost more than 75% of its value at one point. Despite this drastic pullback, there is plenty of reason to believe that Ethereum could once again return to those previous all-time highs.\n\nOne of the primary reasons I believe Ethereum has what it takes to reclaim the $4,000 mark is a series of upgrades implemented in the blockchain over the last year and a half.\n\nUpgrades help Ethereum grow\n\nIf you recall, The Merge occurred in the fall of 2022 and effectively transitioned Ethereum from the bulky and power intensive proof-of-work to a more streamlined and efficient proof-of-stake blockchain. While this upgrade was highly publicized, and for good reason due to its magnitude, I believe there is another upgrade that will ultimately have a greater influence on Ethereum's future price ascension.\n\nKnown as the London hard fork, this upgrade was launched in the summer of 2021 and laid the foundation for The Merge. In preparation for miners becoming obsolete, the London hard fork introduced a new mechanism for handling the network's fees. Previously, transaction fees were sent to Ethereum miners as an incentive for morning. After the London fork, the fees are actually \"burned\" or removed from circulation.\n\nWhile on proof-of-work, miners added blocks to the blockchain. As a reward for their efforts, they would receive a fee which was included in every transaction on Ethereum. But instead of getting rid of the miner fee altogether, Ethereum developers implemented the burn feature that would permanently destroy the fee previously allocated to miners. In doing so, Ethereum essentially became a deflationary asset, a crucial quality for an asset to maintain and increase its value over time. By creating scarcity in the supply of Ethereum, the burn feature can increase demand and drive up the price.\n\nA new beginning\n\nBefore The Merge and the London hard fork, Ethereum's annual inflation rate hovered around 3.5%. But with both of these upgrades now implemented, the number of total ether in circulation has decreased and thus Ethereum has entered a deflationary stage. Today it boasts a deflation rate of -0.088%.\n\nThe inner workings are a little complex, but the combination of these upgrades makes it so that the more transactions that occur on the network, the more ether is burned. It took some time for this phenomenon to materialize due to the current bear market dampening the number of transactions, but toward the end of Q4 2022 and the first few months of 2023, Ethereum finally began to reap the benefits that came out of the London hard fork and The Merge.\n\nThe number of transactions occurring on Ethereum has been rising steadily since the beginning of 2023 and is just shy of levels not seen since it reached its previous all-time high. As a result of this increase in activity, the total number of ether has actually decreased since The Merge as the burn mechanism from the London hard fork has begun to take effect.\n\nFor Ethereum investors, this is nearly a perfect scenario. Over the coming years, as demand (hopefully) picks back up to levels seen in the last bull market, it could lead to explosive growth in Ethereum's price as it becomes truly subject to the pressures of limited supply and increased demand. Should this play out, it could not only send Ethereum past the $4,000 mark, but likely to a new all-time high."

        "title": "Ethereum layer-2 solutions may focus less on token incentives in the future - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Layer-2 networks continue to gain momentum as the Ethereum ecosystem advances. For example, data from analytics provider Token Terminal found that layer-2 scaling solution Polygon had 313,457 daily active users as of Jan. 17, 2023 \u2014 a 30% increase in activity since October 2022.\n\nMoreover, the Polygon ecosystem recently announced the launch of its beta version Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine. As a result, Polygon\u2019s native token, Polygon (MATIC), maintains a bullish narrative.\n\nWhile notable, some believe layer-2 networks offering token incentive models may soon become obsolete. For instance, Jesse Pollak \u2014 head of protocols and Base core contributor at American crypto exchange Coinbase \u2014 told Cointelegraph at ETHDenver 2023 that there are currently no plans to associate a token with Base, the Ethereum layer-2 network recently launched by Coinbase. He said:\n\n\u201cWe think about tokens as a powerful incentive tool that can change user and developer behavior. At the same time, we have seen situations unfold over the last few years where tokens have been used as an incentive mechanism with a lack of product fit for the underlying chain. Tokens have also resulted in nefarious or risky situations in the past.\u201d\n\nAccording to Pollak, Base is a layer-2 solution that allows developers to easily build applications without requiring an incentive mechanism. \u201cOur product will stand on its own. It will be very easy for developers to use to build applications and distribute those to real human beings,\u201d he said.\n\nShifting focus from token models to user experience\n\nFocusing on ease of use and distribution are important points, as Pollak pointed out that many of today\u2019s decentralized applications have been used solely for trading cryptocurrencies. \u201cTrading is not enough to make cryptocurrency the future of the economy. At Base, we are making it easy for developers to build useful applications that people actually want to use,\u201d he added.\n\nPollak explained that Base is investing in core infrastructure, such as Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844, which will make the network secure and low-cost compared with other layer-2 networks. \u201cIt costs about 10\u201315 cents to conduct transactions on layer-2s. We aim to bring that down,\u201d he mentioned.\n\nWhile Base launched its testnet in February, Pollak shared that the Base mainnet launch will take place in the coming months. Moreover, while no plans exist for Base to offer a native token, several ecosystem participants have already expressed interest in building on Base.\n\nRecent: Next stop Shanghai \u2014 Ethereum\u2019s latest milestone approaches\n\nFor example, Konstantin Richter, chief executive officer and founder of Blockdaemon \u2014 a blockchain infrastructure provider \u2014 told Cointelegraph at ETHDenver 2023 that Blockdaemon will serve as an official infrastructure partner for Base. Richter shared that he thinks Base shouldn\u2019t have a token associated with the network, as he believes proof-of-stake (PoS) is an entirely broken system. \u201cBlockdaemon runs more PoS nodes than anyone else, and I can tell you that proof-of-stake only works when token prices go up,\u201d he said.\n\nRichter further explained that Blockdaemon plans to use the Base network to determine how to allow network participants to run nodes while possibly earning a fixed U.S. dollar fee. \u201cThis may result in a different type of PoS mechanism, possibly around commitment of compute rather than a staked percentage of tokens that may not serve the network well,\u201d he said. Richter added that such a model could result in a better user experience. He said:\n\n\u201cThis could be the biggest paradigm shift within the cryptocurrency ecosystem since the invention of PoS. We are moving away from incentive models that reward users for using a product. We are now focused on ease of functionality and low fees.\u201d\n\nYet it remains questionable how exactly Base will attract users and developers to the platform without a token incentive model. Given Coinbase\u2019s vast understanding of institutions and decentralized finance (DeFi), Richter doesn\u2019t think this should be an issue: \u201cI prefer to work with Base given Coinbase\u2019s understanding of institutions and DeFi. It\u2019s remarkable that a public Fortune 500 company is committed to putting transactions transparently on Base.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s too soon to predict future outcomes, it\u2019s important to note that Arbitrum, another Ethereum layer-2 network, also functions without a native token. This has certainly not stopped users from interacting with the Arbitrum network. According to data from the analytics website L2Beat.com, Arbitrum has about $3.35 billion total value locked, making up about 54% of the market share on Ethereum.\n\nHowever, rumors have been circulating that Arbitrum may initiate a token airdrop in the future. While this may or not be the case, it demonstrates Arbitrum\u2019s ability to determine product market fit before launching a token. Gil Rosen, president of the Stanford Blockchain Accelerator, told Cointelegraph at ETHDenver 2023 that finding product market fit is about ensuring projects acquire the right customers whose value is accretive to the ecosystem, which often isn\u2019t the case with tokens. \u201cEarly projects that launch tokens are often locked into tokenomics models before finding product market fit and then are unable to pivot dynamically,\u201d Rosen said.\n\n\u201cDeFi Dad,\u201d a partner at digital asset investment firm Fourth Revolution Capital, told Cointelegraph that he believes the main driver behind layer-2 tokens is to ensure decentralized control over layer-2 networks.\n\nFor example, he explained that the upcoming launch of zkSync\u2019s Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine would use a PoS mechanism to allow zkSync tokenholders to act as stakers. \u201cLayer-2 tokens are necessary for building the decentralized future,\u201d he said.\n\nThanks to our community and the entire ecosystem for an energizing ETHDenver 2023. For the remainder of the week, we\u2019ll share highlights from ETHDenver around ZK scaling and building a future-proof zkEVM. First topic, hyperscalability.\n\n\n\n1/7 pic.twitter.com/qOVSQ475a2 \u2014 zkSync \u220e (@zksync) March 8, 2023\n\nDeFi Dad thinks a layer-2 network without plans to implement a native token could be successful if users are willing to sacrifice decentralization and censorship resistance in the short term.\n\nRecent: Banks with crypto services require new Anti-Money Laundering capabilities\n\nHe said, \u201cBase could be successful as a network for transacting with a user\u2019s crypto. However, make no mistake; Base will be a layer-2 (at least for the foreseeable future) that makes trade-offs. As DeFi users, we tend to deprioritize security and censorship resistance until we really need it.\u201d\n\nWith this point in mind, Rosen mentioned that he believes token models will remain for many decentralized projects with large developer and user communities, but these will launch later. \u201cA project may launch a token when the networks themselves are more mature and have found product market fit.\u201d"

        "title": "Ethereum Blasts Off With ERC-4337 Token Standard - NFT Plazas",
        "content": "Ethereum Blasts Off With New ERC-4337 Token Standard\n\nOn March 1st at ETHDenver, Ethereum announced its latest upgrade to the NFT token standard \u2013 the ERC-4337. This new standard is designed to enhance the interoperability and user-friendliness of NFTs on the Ethereum network, the world\u2019s leading blockchain platform for decentralized applications (dApps), making it more accessible to non-crypto natives.\n\nProposed by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and others in September 2021, the ERC-4337 standard builds on the widely-used ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens. Essentially, focusing on improving accessibility by providing benefits like lost key recovery, the ability to opt-out of seed phrases, and gasless transactions. It\u2019s designed to make it easier for buyers and sellers to create wallets, thereby making it more attractive to a mainstream audience. With the new standard\u2019s launch, Ethereum is again demonstrating its commitment to innovation and leadership in the blockchain space.\n\nWith the ability to provide a new and easier level of usability for digital collectibles, ERC-4337 is set to become the new standard for high-value NFTs on the Ethereum network. As the NFT market continues to grow and evolve, it is clear that standards like ERC-4337 will play an increasingly important role in integrating mass adoption of this exciting new market.\n\nERC-4337: What does it bring to Web3?\n\nOne of the key features of ERC-4337 is its ability to recover lost private keys through a \u201csocial recovery system.\u201d This method significantly improves wallet creation and management by allowing designated users to restore access to a wallet if private keys are lost.\n\nAdditionally, ERC-4337 supports secure wallets that don\u2019t rely on seed phrases, which can be challenging for some users to remember and keep safe. This option provides a more user-friendly way of storing tokens, improving the overall usability of NFTs in the general market.\n\nAutomated trading is another important feature of ERC-4337, allowing NFT owners to trade their tokens without manual intervention. This is achieved through smart contracts, which can be programmed to execute trades automatically based on predetermined conditions making it more user-friendly and accessible to non-technical users, such as monthly spend limits, AI trading, and yield farming positions\n\nLastly, ERC-4337 supports gasless transactions, allowing NFT collections and their DAOs to sponsor gas fees for users.

        "title": "Crypto Week at a Glance: Bitcoin, Ethereum buffeted by market volatility - The Economic Times",
        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring this week, the global cryptocurrency market experienced a decline as most digital assets saw a decrease in value due to various factors. Bitcoin , which began trading at the US$22,000 level on Monday, dropped to its lowest point since January 2021, reaching US$19,000. Similarly, Ethereum , the second-largest cryptocurrency, also experienced a drop, falling to the US$1,300 level. As a result, both of these cryptocurrencies experienced significant losses in their weekly gains.However, following the release of the US jobs data on Friday, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies experienced a rebound, as the US added 311,000 jobs in February, surpassing predictions. Over the past 24 hours, both Bitcoin and Ethereum gained 3%.Investors and traders reacted to the recent statement by US Fed Chair Jerome Powell regarding potential interest rate hikes, resulting in sell-offs and increased concerns over aggressive interest rate policies. However, the decline in the crypto market may also be attributed to uncertainties surrounding Silvergate Bank broadly this week.In November, the bank faced significant withdrawals of $8.1 billion from investors following the FTX incident, leading to a chain reaction of negative consequences, including the sale of debt at a loss of $718 million. The bank's latest financial report showed staggering losses of $1 billion for Q4 and $949 million for the entire year of 2022, in contrast to the $76 million profit recorded in 2021. The bank's announcement of liquidation this week has also significantly impacted the crypto market.On the other hand, during early trading, the stock of Signature Bank (SBNY) experienced a decline of up to 30% due to the impact of Silvergate Bank's collapse on the wider banking industry. Nevertheless, SBNY is recovering from this sudden drop in a volatile market, and now its decline has been reduced to 22%.In an interesting turn of events, according to reports, Amazon is set to launch its own NFT marketplace next month. The marketplace will reportedly be accessible as a tab on Amazon's main website, under the name \"Amazon Digital Marketplace\".Meanwhile, the highly anticipated Shanghai hard fork update for the Ethereum blockchain has been delayed by approximately two weeks. Originally slated for a late March launch, it is now expected to be implemented in early April.The Ethereum network has recently introduced a new feature called account abstraction, which will assist users in recovering their cryptocurrencies in the event that they lose their wallet's private keys. This is just one of several upgrades to the ETH network.Regarding the price action, here is an overview of the best and worst-performing cryptocurrencies among the top 100 by market capitalization during the previous week:Top 5 crypto gainers during the week:1. Kava is up by 18%2. Bone ShibaSwap is up by 8%3. PAX Gold is up by 2%4. UNUS SED LEO is up by 1%5. KuCoin Token is up by 0.53%Top 5 crypto losers this week:1. Dash is down by 28%2. SingularityNET is down by 27%3. Stacks is down by 26%4. Frax Share is down by 25%5. Mina is down by 25%(The author, Edul Patel, is CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex , a global crypto investing platform)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "title": "Big Eyes Coin Launches Vault Pin; Bitcoin, Ethereum Continue to Plunge - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Big Eyes Coin (BIG), one of the newest cat meme tokens in the crypto space, recently launched its vault pin as a part of its presale. This coin is perhaps one of the best ways to take a break from the volatile market as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) dip further, causing all altcoins to turn red in the market.\n\nBIG Cat Crew Grab Free Loot Boxes\n\nBig Eyes recently introduced the vault pin, where investors are able to get a free Loot Box depending on the amount they spend.\n\nWhen buyers go to Big Eyes\u2019 website to purchase tokens, they can enter the vault pin 819 and get their reward, providing that they spend over $100.\n\nIf the user spends $100, they will get a Saver Tin which contains $1000 worth of BIG, as the biggest prize possible. For users who have spent $1000 they will receive a Cute Box, which may help them win up to $10,000 worth of BIG. Meanwhile, those who have spent $5000 can get a Kitty Vault, where they can win up to $25,000 worth of BIG.\n\nInvestors can also get the top two biggest Loot Boxes, depending on how much they have spent. If investors spend $10,000 and $100,000, they will get a Super Saiyan Box and Excali-Paw Chest, respectively. The Super Saiyan Box allows token holders to win up to $100,000 worth of BIG, while the Excali-Paw Chest contains a prize of up to $1 million worth of BIG!\n\nTherefore, the more users spend money on Loot Boxes, the bigger the box they will receive.\n\nBitcoin Takes a Nosedive Due to Looming Inflation\n\nBitcoin continues to have a bad month following Silvergate woes and macroeconomic impact. To make things worse, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stated that inflation could go higher than previously thought.\n\nAfter Powell\u2019s statement before the US Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, BTC fell by 1.6%, with its price down to $22,000.\n\nWith FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) spreading throughout the crypto market, Bitcoin investors are turning their backs on BTC and flocking to tokens with smart contract functionality.\n\nAs of now, crypto enthusiasts have every reason to invest in other altcoins or even new tokens. However, buying presale coins might be a better option to take a break from market volatility.\n\nEthereum Volume Has Been Down by 90% since 2020\n\nEthereum\u2019s price saw a recovery of 78% since June 2022, but it does not necessarily mean that it guarantees success. Looking at the digital asset\u2019s volume profile, it highly suggests a major crypto market correction.\n\n\n\nIn March 2020, Ether\u2019s volume profile showed a greater selling volume than the buying volume when there was about 160 million ETH across the $85-$270 price range. This was quickly replaced with a higher buying volume, with 64.25 million trades across the $270-$450 range from July to November 2020.\n\nWhen 2022 came, fewer investors participated in the coin\u2019s potential bottom compared to the start of the bull market in 2020. However, we are seeing a rising volume during the current ETH price rebound.\n\nRecently in March 2023, 65% of Ethereum was bought at a lower price, which means securing profits might still remain high even if a significant price drop looms ahead.\n\nThe crypto market has always been volatile, but if you want to rest from market volatility, consider investing in Big Eyes Coin today! Check them out on their website and social media.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank has jolted the entire crypto industry.\n\nUSD Coin issuer Circle\u2019s $3.3 billion exposure to the bank has caused the stablecoin to lose its peg.\n\nUSDC fell as low as $0.87 earlier today as holders rushed to redeem the stablecoin and convert it to other crypto assets.\n\nOpportunistic traders are scooping up USD Coins at a 10% discount in hopes of a gradual recovery.\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank has sent shockwaves throughout the crypto industry, with considerable spillover into the traditional finance space. The fear and uncertainty from SVB\u2019s closure have spelled trouble for several companies in the crypto space. The most notable crypto entity that is facing collateral damage is Circle Internet Financial, the issuer of the world\u2019s second-largest stablecoin USD Coin (USDC).\n\nUSDC falls to $0.87 amid SVB induced turmoil\n\nAfter hours of silence regarding its exposure to Silicon Valley Bank, Circle took to Twitter earlier today to reveal that it had $3.3 billion stuck in the downed bank. The funds are part of the $40 billion reserve that backs the USD Coin. Within an hour of this news, the stablecoin lost its peg to the dollar and proceeded to lose more than 11% of its value, falling as low as $0.87.\n\n@circle is currently protecting #USDC from a black swan failure in the U.S. banking system. @SVB_Financial is a critical bank in the U.S. economy and its failure \u2013 without a Federal rescue plan \u2013 will have broader implications for business, banking and entrepreneurs. https://t.co/CYi6Z26ngH \u2014 Dante Disparte (@ddisparte) March 11, 2023\n\nDante Disparte, the Chief Strategy Officer of Circle revealed that the company was protecting its stablecoin from a \u201cblack swan failure in the U.S banking system.\u201d Disparte emphasized the need for a federal rescue plan in order to avert \u201cbroader implications for business, banking, and entrepreneurs.\u201d Silicon Valley Bank is the second largest FDIC-insured bank to fail in the United States. However, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures deposits up to $250,000.\n\nAmerican crypto exchange Coinbase, which launched USDC in partnership with Circle, suspended USDC: USD conversions for the stablecoin as holders rushed to exchange it for other crypto assets. The conversions will reportedly resume on Monday. According to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, Jump Trading, Wintermute, and Genesis Trading are among those who redeemed USD Coin for USD via Circle and Coinbase ahead of the weekend redemption break. Meanwhile, opportunistic traders have lined up to grab USDC at a 10% discount, in anticipation of a gradual recovery to its dollar peg."

        "title": "Ethereum Market Update: A Comprehensive Overview - Cyber Daily",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nThe Ethereum market has witnessed significant growth and development since its inception. As one of the leading cryptocurrencies, Ethereum continues to capture the attention of investors, traders, and enthusiasts alike. This article provides a comprehensive update on the Ethereum market, covering recent trends, price movements, and notable developments. Additionally, it explores the importance of data security in the cryptocurrency industry, drawing attention to key considerations for protecting sensitive information in the wake of data breaches.\n\nRecent Trends and Price Movements\n\nThe Ethereum market has experienced both ups and downs in recent months, reflecting the volatility inherent in the cryptocurrency market. As of late, Ethereum has demonstrated resilience and showcased its potential as a robust digital asset. The market has seen positive momentum, driven by factors such as increased adoption, institutional interest, and the continuous development of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nDespite occasional fluctuations, Ethereum has maintained a strong position and remains one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Its blockchain technology has revolutionized various industries, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts.\n\nNotable Developments in the Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem is vibrant and constantly evolving, with new projects, upgrades, and collaborations contributing to its growth. One notable development is the integration of Ethereum-based tokens on platforms like easymarkets. This integration enables users to access and trade Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies conveniently, expanding the accessibility and liquidity of the market.\n\nAnother significant development is the ongoing transition from Ethereum's current proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism. The implementation of Ethereum 2.0 aims to enhance scalability, security, and sustainability, further solidifying Ethereum's position as a leading blockchain platform.\n\nFurthermore, the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications built on the Ethereum network has created a new paradigm in financial services. DeFi protocols offer users the opportunity to lend, borrow, and trade digital assets without intermediaries, providing financial inclusivity and transparency.\n\nThe Importance of Data Security in the Cryptocurrency Industry\n\nAs the popularity and value of cryptocurrencies continue to soar, ensuring data security has become paramount. Cryptocurrency transactions involve the transfer and storage of sensitive information, including personal and financial data. Protecting this information from unauthorized access and data breaches is crucial to maintain trust and security within the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nIn light of recent data breaches across various sectors, including the financial industry, it is essential to address the issue of data security head-on. Here are three key considerations to keep in mind:\n\nImplement Robust Security Measures: Crypto exchanges and wallet providers should prioritize implementing robust security measures, including multi-factor authentication, encryption, and cold storage solutions. Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments can help identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they are exploited. Educate Users About Best Practices: Educating cryptocurrency users about best practices in data security is crucial. Users should be encouraged to adopt strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and avoid sharing sensitive information online or with unauthorized parties. Raising awareness about potential scams, phishing attempts, and the importance of conducting transactions on secure platforms is vital to prevent data breaches. Stay Informed About Data Privacy Regulations: As data privacy regulations evolve, it is essential for cryptocurrency businesses to stay informed and comply with relevant laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other regional privacy frameworks. Adhering to these regulations not only protects user data but also builds trust and credibility within the industry.\n\nNavigating the Ethereum Market and Ensuring Data Security\n\nThe Ethereum market continues to demonstrate resilience and growth, driven by technological advancements, market adoption, and ongoing development within the Ethereum ecosystem. Traders and investors should stay informed about market trends and developments to make well-informed decisions.\n\nSimultaneously, safeguarding data security remains paramount in the cryptocurrency industry. By implementing robust security measures, educating users about best practices, and adhering to data privacy regulations, businesses and individuals can mitigate the risk of data breaches and protect sensitive information.\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve and reshape the financial landscape, staying vigilant and proactive in data security measures will contribute to a safer and more secure cryptocurrency ecosystem for all stakeholders. By prioritizing data security alongside market analysis and strategic decision-making, participants in the Ethereum market can navigate its dynamic landscape with confidence and reap the potential benefits it offers."

        "content": "An investor who correctly called the 2022 crypto bottom says that Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) are ahead of the curve when it comes to pulling in more users.\n\nIn a new interview on Real VIsion with macro guru Raoul Pal, Chris Burniske, a partner at venture capital firm Placeholder, says that crypto assets competing with Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have less potential in terms of harnessing network effects.\n\nAccording to Burniske, even though interoperable blockchains like Polkadot (DOT) and Cosmos (ATOM) made more \u201clogical\u201d design choices, they\u2019re not as attractive as Ethereum and Solana.\n\n\u201c[Polkadot] is still a top-20 network, and I don\u2019t think it goes away, but it\u2019s important for people to pay attention to the differences in crypto asset design and use, because that\u2019s a big one. That\u2019s where I see ETH and SOL as quite similar, and some of the other designs. They made more rational or logical decisions I would say, but they\u2019re less explosive or less exposed to network effects.\u201d\n\nBurniske goes on to say that he and his company are interested in investing into the future infrastructure of blockchains as well as crypto projects focused on creating decentralized applications (DApps).\n\n\u201cIn the public markets, it has been buying the distressed, important infrastructure of the next expansion\u2026 They\u2019re big teams, they\u2019re well-financed, they\u2019re liquid. It\u2019s a little bit like being able to buy Microsoft and Amazon and those types of names after the dot-com crash\u2026\n\nRight now, at least at the venture stage, because again, I have all this infrastructure exposure in the public markets, venture stage, I\u2019m drawn more toward application stuff, and so it would be things like Tensor, which is built on Solana. So it\u2019s a NFT [non-fungible token] exchange built on Solana, really native experience. It\u2019s kind of like the TradingView or Bloomberg of NFTs\u2026\n\n[Another example would be] Vault. Vaults are basically programmable environments for artists to launch experiences for their top fans. They start with the music industry because the music industry has lost a lot of revenue because the top fans can\u2019t interact with artists like they used to be able to and Vault is trying to create that in a digital environment.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ether (ETH) has been able to restore some of its calm following the release of a mixed US employment data for February, which saw it briefly go below the $1,400 mark for the first time in nearly two months earlier in the session.\n\nWhen US wage growth came in lower than anticipated and following a surprising increase to 3.6% in the US unemployment rate, ETH, the cryptocurrency that drives the smart-contract enabled Ethereum blockchain, was last trading close to $1,425.\n\nAs a result, Ether is still down about 1% for the day and nearly 7% for the past 24 hours.\n\nThe price of ETH plummeted from the mid-$1,500 range due to worries about the failure of cryptocurrency-friendly Silvergate Bank and a rising liquidity crisis at another cryptocurrency-friendly bank, SVB Financial.\n\nOnce the New York Attorney General referred to Ether as a security in its ongoing lawsuit against KuCoin, sell pressure increased.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission is reportedly considering a crackdown on Ether on the grounds that it is an unregistered security, which has caused concern in the crypto markets in recent weeks.\n\nSome have also said that the next budget from the Biden administration, which aims to crack down on crypto tax loss harvesting, may have a negative impact on prices.\n\nToday\u2019s Ethereum Price\n\nDATE ETC USD Today 01 $ 1,452.70 Ethereum Price Prediction As long as ETH is able to maintain above $1,400, there hasn\u2019t been a sustained, convincing break below the critical $1,423 level of the 200-Day Moving Average. The 200DMA has been hailed as a crucial support level for 2023 and served as strong resistance in 2022. A sustained break above the 200DMA (as seen earlier this year) is considered as a vital indicator of a favorable shift in the market\u2019s medium-term momentum, hence a break below it would be a devastating blow to the medium-term bullish ETH thesis. It might be argued that this momentum would have vanished if ETH drops back below $1,400. Next week\u2019s important US CPI inflation data release will be closely watched. ETH bulls will be looking for a downside surprise in the data that causes markets to further discount the possibility of a 50 basis point rate hike from the Fed later this month. Bulls will also be looking for some quiet over the issues US banks that support cryptocurrencies are having. Advertisement If ETH does bounce, key resistance in the form of the February lows is located around $1,460 to watch out for. Bears will be watching for a retest of $1,350 as support on the downside. A breach below this level might lead to a retest of the lows from last November under $1,100. This is a crucial region of support, according to DeFi Llama, who used on-chain statistics, because a break below it would result in a large $68 million in liquidations of long bets put out on decentralised exchanges (DEX). DeFi Llama advises traders to keep an eye on the price around $1,240, where $30 million in DEX long positions could be lost.

        "content": "The week hasn\u2019t been one of roses and sunshine for investors betting on Bitcoin and Ethereum, but for Big Eyes Coin lovers, the honeymoon phase has only just begun.\n\nOn a whole, the market has not been doing well all week, with more reds than greens in what people are describing as a delayed reaction to the series of news affecting the crypto scene of late. Bitcoin has fallen back to $22k after much anticipation that it would hit $25k by the end of this quarter, and Ethereum hasn\u2019t fared much better with its current price of $1.5k.\n\nBIG, on the other hand, is unaffected as it continues to enjoy a successful presale journey and expand on its popularity and appeal.\n\nBig Eyes Sets A New Pre-sale Record\n\nBig Eyes has a large and unified following, contributing to the presale sales of $31.24 million. The coin has achieved the most amazing presale in the last two years, making history in the process. Due to the success of its presale, the team is offering intriguing rewards.\n\nIn addition to the exciting loot boxes that have been released, the meme coin has just introduced a vault pin that allows users to get up to 5,000% extra BIG tokens when they buy a loot box. When making a purchase, one is required to enter the pin, which is 819.\n\nThe Excali-Paw Chest, which costs $100,000, was just revealed one week ago as a new loot box that may enable one to win up to $1 million worth of Prizes.\n\nThe other boxes are the Saver tin, which costs $100, the Cute Box goes for $1,000, the Kitty Vault \u2013 $5,000; and the Saiyan box for $10,000.\n\nThe loot boxes are safe compared to any dangerous endeavour because everyone is guaranteed to receive at least a portion of what they put in. Less is not an option; only equal to or greater is.\n\nHas Bitcoin Hit A Wall?\n\nThroughout the previous 24 hours, the price of Bitcoin has remained stable at just above $22,000. Despite this, the largest digital asset is still up by roughly one-third in 2023 thanks to its early-year gain, but Bitcoin has already dropped below its recent peak of $25,000.\n\nThe $23,000 to $24,000 area, which had reigned for all of February, was also decisively thrown in the rear-view by a severe selloff this week, wiping out optimistic traders who were relying on Bitcoin\u2019s recovery into a new bull market after a terrible 2022.\n\nWhile investors try to stay optimistic, many are wondering if BTC hasn\u2019t hit a wall in its ascent and is unable to push through.\n\nEthereum price goes down\n\nSince June 2022, the value of Ether (ETH), the native token of Ethereum, has increased by 78%. Yet, this does not ensure additional gains, especially given that dropping trade volumes indicate a strong likelihood of a significant correction.\n\nThe trading volume tracks activities around the buying and selling of the coin. This is usually an indication of how well the coin is doing or not doing. In the last 24 hours, ETH fell by 0.42%, and this has been the consistent pattern all week.\n\nIt is currently selling for $1,556.43 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $6,769,307,144 USD as of the time of this writing.\n\nIt still remains number 2 on the crypto chart with a live market cap of $190,465,827,618 USD.\n\nClick below for more on Big Eyes Coin:\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

Plus, we\u2019ll introduce you to a new crypto project called SignupToken that might just make you a millionaire.\n\nThe Bear Market: A Chance to Buy Low\n\nRemember that old saying, \u201cbuy low, sell high\u201d? Well, that applies to crypto too. When the market is in a bearish state, prices are low, making it the perfect opportunity to invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Signing up takes only a minute, and there\u2019s no cost to become involved. It could be a game-changer for those who have been hesitant to dip their toes into the crypto waters.

It\u2019s a project worth keeping an eye on, especially if you\u2019re looking for a low-risk investment that could pay off big.\n\nTo Conclude\n\nThe crypto market can be daunting, but by taking advantage of the bear market and holding onto your investments for the long term, you could see significant gains. And if you\u2019re feeling adventurous, give SignupToken a shot. It\u2019s free to sign up, and who knows \u2013 you might just become one of the 1 million millionaires they\u2019re aiming to create!\n\nFollow the Link For More Information on Sign Up Token!\n\nWebsite: www.signuptoken.com\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market suffered a huge loss in value in 2022 which was undoubtedly a terrible year for cryptocurrencies, perhaps even an understatement. The FTX crash in November last year plummeted the prices of cryptocurrencies across the board and its effects are still felt in the industry which has prompted governments around the world to draft legislation to regulate crypto.\n\nThe FTX controversy has left a cloud of uncertainty causing the industry to trade in an alarmingly volatile state. What was once an industry with a global market capitalization of $2.86 trillion in 2021, now stands at $931.71 billion, a decrease of 6.58% from the previous day. The latest crumble comes as Silvergate Capital, a high profile US-based crypto-friendly bank announced its closure after failing to recover from the FTX crash.\n\nDespite the woes, however, many believe that 2023 will be successful and cryptocurrencies are on the road to recovery. Given their features of being fast and secure, cryptocurrencies have made the process of transferring money across borders a lot easier. But regardless that the cryptocurrency market is open 24/7, guessing the right timing means a lot and for new crypto investors it is a far more complicated environment to understand.\n\nLockyourcrypto.com offers holders of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as well as new investors a haven to store, secure, and control their assets for a period of time.\n\nLockyourcrypto.com \u2013 Buy, Store, and Lock Your Crypto Assets\n\nLockyourcrypto.com is a platform to store and transfer cryptocurrencies in a more secure and reliable way. The sole purpose of the platform is to give new crypto users control of their assets with the opportunity to lock up their funds for a period of time to eliminate the chances of buying and selling too early or too late.\n\nThe platform offers investors the option of storing their funds for 6 and 12 months as well as custom time periods. And once the transaction is confirmed the crypto holder will receive a contract or certificate which will serve as proof of ownership and can be used for future reference.\n\nLockyourcrypto.com employs industry-standard security measures, including high-level encryption, and secure storage practices, assuring crypto holders that their data and funds will remain secure for the duration of the chosen period.\n\nThe platform offers a simple process, which can be completed within just a few clicks, and Lockyourcrypto.com will not allow any withdrawals or transfers before the confirmed holding period has lapsed, except in cases of extreme emergency.\n\nBitcoin \u2013 The Inevitable Crash\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is having its worst week since November 2022 as its price crashed below the $20,000 mark to trade at $19,918.07 after declining by roughly 8% overnight and a weekly downward movement of 11.06%.\n\nThe industry\u2019s oldest and most powerful currency has been in an extremely volatile state since the beginning of March as an equity selloff, fear over higher interest rates and an escalating US regulatory crackdown on crypto combine to hurt investor sentiment.\n\nBitcoin has seen its 24-hour trading volume spike by over 73% to $37.5 billion as its market capitalization, at the time of writing, had dropped by 8.03% to $384 billion.\n\nEthereum \u2013 Impending Price Crash Below $1350?\n\nEthereum (ETH), the industry\u2019s second most powerful cryptocurrency, fell sharply below the $1500 mark for the first time since January this year as its price slumped overnight by 8.24% to trade at $1,408.78 continuing its weekly downward decline of 10.27%.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price crash and the persistent downward trend are the aftermaths of Bitcoin\u2019s downward movement as analysts now suggest that a failure to close below a key level could result in Ethereum\u2019s price to dip below $1350.\n\nThe price slump comes after the Chair of Commodities Futures Trading Commission, Rostin Benham, recently called Ethereum a commodity in front of US senators and SEC Chair Garry Gensler tightens the screws around cryptocurrencies, terming them \u2018unregistered securities\u2019.\n\nFore more information, visit:\n\nWebsite: https://lockyourcrypto.com\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Market left in shock after an Ethereum whale moved billions in Shiba Inu worth a staggering $2.6 million, for a transaction fee of only $2.\n\nShytoshi Kusama makes a key statement regarding the recent launch of the bate version of the holy anticipated Shibarium upgrade.\n\nAn Ethereum whale have reportedly moved a significant amount of Shiba Inu (SHIB), following the launch of Shibarium beta. According to data from the blockchain-tracker service Etherscan, a crypto whale has left the entire market in shock after moving billions in Shiba Inu.\n\nAccording to Etherscan, the whale transferred a whopping 258,837,671,569 SHIB to Shiba Inu\u2019s smart contract. The funds can either be burned or utilized for the network\u2019s ongoing projects. The Shiba Inu tokens moved were worth over $2.64 million as at when the transaction was carried out.\n\nNotably, the transaction, despite being a staggering sim, only cost the whale around $2 in fees, to successfully process the transfer. It is also worth noting that the whale in question still has an even larger amount of Shiba Inu tokens in its possession. The transfer has left no holes in the whale\u2019s account, as the whale still reportedly holds a mouth-watering 4,925,361,871,313 Shiba Inu, which is worth more than $50.23 at report time. Shib is up 2.54% at this time, with prices sitting at $0.00001053.\n\nThe whale account also holds $11.97 million worth of Polygon (MATIC), $5.55 million worth of Chainlink (LINK), $2.17 million worth of AAVE (AAVE), and $2.63 worth of Compound (COMP).\n\nThe beta version of the Shibarium layer-2 scaling solution is live, here\u2019s what to know\n\nMeanwhile, the Shiba Inu community is still in celebratory mode, after the network successfully launched the beta version of the highly anticipated layer-2 scaling solution Shibarium. Shytoshi Kusama, the lead shiba inu developer revealed that the testnet is now available to beta testers for use.\n\n\u201c\u2026today we begin the EARLY Beta Test of the Shibarium Network which we call PUPPYNET! As we\u2019ve mentioned many times, Shibarium is a layer 2 blockchain that allows anyone to build DAPPS, integrate into IRL businesses, and power projects with it. It is low cost, burns Shib in the process, and is being adjusted as the beta test continues over the next few months.\u201d Kusama noted in a recent blogpost.\n\nIn a recent blogpost detailing the entirety of the launch, and everything developers and users need to look out for, Kusama stated that Shib burns will on tokens in the network. Developers will be able to see the amount of burnt Shib in a running chart on a burn portal.\n\nHe also warned that all Puppynets are not real and that users should not spend their Shib tokens on them despite intense shilling from other market players. He goes on to emphasize the importance of doing your own research (DYOR) to avoid falling for scams.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s recent crackdown on \u201cshitcoins\u201d has sparked a wave of backlash from the cryptocurrency community. In a post on a small subreddit, Buterin labeled several coins, including Bite (BITE), as having \u201cno redeeming cultural or moral value\u201d and predicted they would result in significant financial losses for investors.\n\nButerin\u2019s comments come on the heels of his recent sale of billions of dollars worth of \u201cfree shitcoins,\u201d as reported by LookOnChain. The sale included 50 billion MOPS for 1.25 Ethereum ($2K), 10 billion CULT for 58 ETH ($91K), and 500 trillion SHIK for 380 ETH ($600K), as reported by TronWeekly.\n\nDespite his efforts to distance himself from these so-called \u201cshitcoins,\u201d it seems that Buterin\u2019s comments may have backfired. Some have lauded Buterin\u2019s efforts to eliminate scams and illegitimate projects, while others have come to the defense of the coins he criticized.\n\nAmong those defending the coins, one user welcomed Buterin to the $BITE community, urging others to invest and enjoy the ride. Meanwhile, some users questioned Buterin\u2019s motivations, accusing him of engaging in \u201csoft shilling\u201d and \u201csoft FUD\u201d to manipulate prices.\n\nOthers still rejected the entire premise of the debate, suggesting that the value of a cryptocurrency is subjective and based on cultural and moral factors that are open to debate.\n\nThey even went so far as to compare the value of Ethereum to Bitcoin and to suggest that currency based on moral or cultural capital is never truly worthless without debate.\n\nDespite the varying opinions, it\u2019s clear that the debate over \u201cshitcoins\u201d is far from over, and Buterin\u2019s latest comments are just the latest chapter in an ongoing saga.\n\nEthereum Co-founder\u2019s NFT Collection Sparks Surge in Sales\n\nThe sale of an NFT collection featuring Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s stamp of approval has caused a stir on Crypto Twitter and resulted in several million dollars worth of sales. Metalabel, in collaboration with Gitcoin, created the collection to honor Buterin\u2019s contributions to the Web3 funding model.\n\nEach NFT includes a signed digital version of the 2018 whitepaper \u201cLiberal Radicalism: A Flexible Design for Philanthropic Matching Funds\u201d and commemorates the creation of quadratic funding.

        "title": "Cardano (ADA) vs Ethereum (ETH); Which Crypto Should I Invest in? - Crypto Economy",
        "content": "A good way to decide which cryptocurrency to invest in is to compare two of them. Knowing their similarities and differences is perhaps the best alternative to know exactly which cryptocurrency best suits each investor. Two of the cryptos that have been most compared for their potential are Cardano vs Ethereum.\n\nBoth the digital assets are altcoin heavyweights that rank among the top 10 cryptocurrencies and provide users with a massive investment opportunity. Although they provide similar functionalities in relation with smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApp), there are some major differences that separate ADA and ETH miles apart.\n\nOf late, the war between the two formidable opponents has intensified owing to the significant surge in decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Furthermore, the comparison between the two has piqued interest, in part because Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson was also one of the original developers of Ethereum. The Ethereum network seems to be at a commanding position compared to the Cardano network due to its sheer size. It\u2019s the second-most popular cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nEthereum is also the most popular network for non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces, DeFi applications, and numerous metaverse projects. While Cardano also host these types of applications, Ethereum is the clear leader in this space.\n\nHowever, since launch Cardano has adopted a more cautious path with a peer-reviewed research-driven approach aiming to incorporate academic rigour and math with blockchain technology. Its primary focus has been on creating a system that is cheaper to use and more efficient than Ethereum.\n\nAlthough there are many similarities between Cardano and Ethereum, they have their differences depending on an individual investor or user\u2019s perspective. In this article, let us understand in details the key differences between the Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA).\n\nMain Differences Between Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA)\n\nEthereum and Cardano seem similar on the surface, but they have significant operational and application differences. The key differences have been segregated under 4 main categories as follows:\n\nTransaction Volume\n\nEthereum enjoys a wider fanbase handling approximately 1 million daily transactions. On the other hand Cardano processes less than 100,000 transactions on a daily basis. However, in regards to transaction speed, Cardano has eclipsed Ethereum in transactions per second (TPS). On Layer 1, Ethereum can process up to 30 TPS. That\u2019s in contrast to Cardano network\u2019s speed, which can process roughly 250 TPS.\n\nScalability\n\nBoth Cardano and Ethereum 2.0 are \u201cLayer 1\u201d blockchains, but their designs are different. Ethereum 2.0 uses a single-layer to manage on-chain smart contracts and apps, but Cardano has a dual-layer design that allows for more functionality and scalability. This means, Cardano is more scalable than Ethereum and can handle more transactions. It seems Cardano is capitalizing on things Ethereum is not, and vice versa.\n\nTransaction Fees\n\nEthereum is infamous for its notoriously high gas fees compared to Cardano. The ETH transaction fees are very high with users have to pay 2$ to 6$ for just 1 transaction. In comparison, Cardano gas fees are consistently lower, averaging 0.16 ADA per transaction.\n\nDeFi Ecosystem\n\nThe current boom in the DeFi projects has had a major impact on both Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA). The global decentralized finance market size was valued at $13.61 billion in 2022 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of a staggering 46.0% from 2023 to 2030. This exponential growth has put Ethereum as well as Cardano on the forefront with a number of upcoming upgrades on both the blockchains.\n\nSince Ethereum was the first chain with smart contracts, it dwarfs Cardano\u2019s smart chain ecosystem. To put things into a perspective, Ethereum has more than 3000 dApps running on it, whereas Cardano has a little over 1,000. When looking at total value locked (TVL), Ethereum\u2019s DeFi ecosystem outshines Cardano by a long shot. Subsequently, Cardano comprises only a tiny fraction of Ethereum based on TVL being less than $100 million. In a nutshell, Ethereum has clinched the winning trophy in this category.\n\nMeanwhile, even on the NFT front Ethereum (ETH) manages to put forward a sweeping victory with some of the most popular and lucrative NFT projects including CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yatch Club (BAYC). On the other hand, the Cardano NFT ecosystem is also heating up with the three most popular Cardano NFT collections are Skyweaver, Etheremon, and Spells of Genesis.\n\nCardano\u2019s NFT project, Clay Nation, also revealed an integration with The Sandbox Game, a virtual world where players can build, own, and monetize their gaming experiences. Thus, these developments seem to be providing Cardano with a lot of credibility.\n\nEnter The Sandbox \ud83e\udea8 Clay Nation will become the first @Cardano project to be integrated in @TheSandboxGame \u2013 pushing interoperability even further in #Web3 The experience will be created in collaboration with @smoblerstudios. Stay tuned for more. pic.twitter.com/kzdSsUyKpW \u2014 Clay Nation (@claymates) February 25, 2023\n\nHow are Cardano and Ethereum similar?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, both Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) have several similarities owing to the fact that they share a common heritage with Cardano\u2019s founder, Charles Hoskinson, being one of the original developers of Ethereum. Other similarities can be briefly categorized as both the digital assets are used for peer-to-peer transactions and as a mode of payment for services and processing power on their underlying blockchain networks.\n\nIn addition, both are also commonly used as investment products, with users buying them on exchanges and then holding or trading them in hopes of making a profit. Key similarities also include features such as smart contract functionality, developing dApps, sending financial transactions via the network\u2019s native token and the same Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms for their blockchains\n\nEthereum started operating on the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus, the original mechanism inherited from Bitcoin (BTC). But it changed to a PoS model in September 2022 which is a more environmentally friendly consensus mechanism than the PoW. Meanwhile, Cardano was launched with a specially designed proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain protocol for consensus called \u201cOuroboros\u201d.\n\nIn terms of smart contracts, both the blockchain networks continue to feature these contracts in their operations. It is likely that while both projects are still being actively developed, Ethereum is a tad further along in its rollout compared to Cardano.\n\nStaking: Ethereum vs Cardano. Which is More Profitable?\n\nStaking refers to a popular way to earn rewards, for helping to support network validation of blockchain transactions. The process helps the network to remain decentralized by spreading the consensus to thousands of validators that ensure the transactions.\n\nEthereum (ETH) takes the trophy for the most staked crypto asset following the successful Merge of the Beacon Chain consensus layer with the Ethereum execution layer in 2022. On-chain ETH staking yields are currently around 4% APY. To stake on Ethereum currently, users have to agree to lock away a minimum 32 ETH until after the network upgrades to Shanghai Hardfork.\n\nAlternatively, Cardano has no lockup period, ADA holders can stake at will, while maintaining the freedom to use their tokens to make payments and transfers and even enter into Cardano\u2019s DeFi ecosystem. Currently, ADA staking returns a yield of about 3.5 to 5% APY.\n\nRecap: Comparative Table Ethereum vs Cardano\n\nEthereum (ETH) Cardano (ADA) Launch Date 30 July 2015 27 September 2017 Max. Token Supply Infinite 45 Billion Consensus Mechanism Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) /Ouroboros Transactions Fees $2-$6 (depending on network traffic) 0.16 ADA per transaction. Transactions Per Second 30 transactions 250-270 transactions Programming Language Solidity Haskell Web https://ethereum.org/en/ https://cardano.org/\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile all cryptocurrencies have their own pros and cons, Ethereum is generally considered the safer bet when comaperd with Cardano. It is significantly larger and more widely used than Cardano, which gives it an advantage. As a matter of fact Ethereum is also more established and likely to survive long term due to its larger developer community and ecosystem. Meanwhile Cardano is relatively new and still building out its fundamentals.\n\nHowever, given the methodical approach Cardano could witness a sustainable growth over time, especially since it has a treasury, which runs as a separate entity from these organizations. On the contrary, when it comes to organizational structure, Ethereum is overseen by a single organization, the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nIn conclusion it can be said that both the networks have a fair potential to grow in the future, there isn\u2019t a clear winner as of now. Alternatively, there\u2019s a chance that in the future both Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) will both be winners.\n\nCrypto Economy reviews and comparisons are for informational purposes only and should not be taken as investment advice.
