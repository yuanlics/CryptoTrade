        "title": "Ethereum Co-Founder Thinks The Over $40 Billion Staked ETH Can Be Stolen - NewsBTC",
        "content": "It appears that the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, doesn\u2019t trust the security of infrastructure allowing ETH staking. Consequently, in a recent interview, Buterin stated that he would only stake a limited amount of coins to ensure the network is distributed and remain robust against malicious agents who might try to take over the platform, reversing transactions.\n\nVitalik Buterin Has Doubts On Ethereum Staking\n\nButerin has raised concerns about the potential risks of ETH staking through third-party infrastructure, specifically regarding the exposure of private keys and the danger it poses to his entire stake. He believes that implementing a multi-signature system could provide better protection. However, the current process is more difficult to set up, leading to his increased caution.\n\nIn a multi-sig system, users have their private key to sign transactions. A specific number of signatures must be provided to approve a transaction, which varies based on the Ethereum wallet\u2019s configuration. This setup boosts security and reduces the risk of unauthorized access to funds.\n\nDuring the Bankless Podcast, the co-founder explains:\n\nProbably the biggest reason why I personally am not just staking all of my ETH, that I\u2019m instead staking a fairly small portion, is because if you stake your ETH, it has to be all out, like the keys that access it have to be public on some system that\u2019s online, and for safety, it has to be a multi-sig, and multi-sigs for staking are still fairly difficult to set up, and it gets complicated in a bunch of ways.\n\nETH Prices Stable Below $2,000\n\nHis remarks have generated a lot of discussion. Most critics are concerned about the entire security framework of Ethereum. After shifting from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake system, Ethereum relies on a network of validators who have to stake at least 32 ETH for a chance to approve a block of transactions and earn block rewards and transaction fees. These validators are also needed to secure the network; without them, the blockchain will be susceptible to attacks.\n\nAccording to on-chain data, there are over 643,000 validators spread across the globe who have staked over 20.5 million ETH. On average, each validator has staked 32.17 ETH. Notably, the validator count has steadily risen over the years, and the number of ETH staked has sharply increased despite the recent upgrade permitting stakers to unlock their coins.\n\nCharles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano and one of the original co-founders of Ethereum, said he was \u201clost for words,\u201d clarifying that all their ADA is staked as expected in a \u201cproperly designed proof-of-stake system.\u201d\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH prices remain firm and weren\u2019t affected by Buterin\u2019s comments. However, the coin is yet to breach $2,000 and trends below April 2023 highs in early July 2023.\n\nFeatured image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin stated that he does not stake all of his Ether (ETH) due to multisignature wallets being \u201ccomplicated in a bunch of ways.\u201d\n\nOn the June 29 episode of the Bankless podcast, Buterin revealed the \u201cbiggest reason\u201d why he is only staking a small fraction of his ETH. He explained:\n\n\u201cBecause if you stake your ETH, the keys that access it have to be public on a subsystem that is online. For safety, it has to be a Multisig. Multisig for staking is still fairly difficult to set up; it gets complicated in a bunch of ways.\u201d\n\nButerin speaking on the Bankless podcast on June 29. Source: Bankless\n\nCharles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Ethereum and founder of Cardano, took to Twitter on June 30, stating he is \u201cat a loss for words\u201d after hearing Buterin only stakes a small portion of his Ether.\n\nHoskinson added that \u201call\u201d of his Cardano (ADA) is staked.\n\nI had to listen to this a few times. I'm just at a loss for words. All of our Ada is staked. Guess what that's how it's supposed to be for a properly designed Proof of Stake protocol. https://t.co/ye6va1DH06 \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 29, 2023\n\nButerin also discussed the EigenLayer protocol, which allows Ethereum validators and stakers to \u201cre-stake\u201d their assets onto other emerging networks.\n\nWhile it is only in its testnet phase and not expected to launch until the third quarter of 2023, Buterin said the main challenge is that it creates \u201ccentralization risks,\u201d stating:\n\n\u201cTrustworthy stakers would be valued more by the system than untrustworthy stakers. Trustworthy stakers are much less likely to actually get slashed.\u201d\n\nSreeram Kaanan, the founder of EigenLayer, explained there are \u201ccomplex risks\u201d with restaking, and it is important to take a \u201cconstrained approach in building restaking.\u201c\n\n\u201cConstraints being what is really good for the ecosystem, and having constraints on building what new innovation can be unleashed based on this concept,\u201d he stated.\n\nPanelists on the June 29 Bankless podcast episode.

        "title": "[EXPLAINER] How to Check the Status of an Ethereum Transaction - bitcoinke.io",
        "content": "When it comes to the Ethereum blockchain, a transaction is initiated by an external account owner rather than a contract. To illustrate, consider the scenario where User A sends 1 Ether to User B. This action, involving the debiting of funds from one account and crediting them to another, leads to a modification in the state of the blockchain.\n\nThe change brought about by a transaction occurs within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). When an Ethereum transaction is initiated, it must be broadcasted to the entire network. Any node within the network can send a request for the execution of a transaction on the EVM.\n\nOn the Ethereum network, various types of transactions exist, each serving a specific purpose. Some of the common types of transactions include:\n\nValue Transfer Transactions: These transactions involve the transfer of Ether ($ETH) or other tokens between Ethereum addresses. Users can send or receive digital currency through these transactions\n\nContract Deployment Transactions: When deploying a smart contract onto the Ethereum blockchain, a contract deployment transaction is used. This transaction includes the necessary code and data to create a new smart contract on the network\n\nContract Interaction Transactions: These transactions are used to interact with existing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can execute specific functions within a contract, providing inputs and receiving outputs as per the contract\u2019s defined behavior\n\nToken Transfer Transactions: Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem supports the creation of various tokens using the ERC-20 or ERC-721 token standards. Token transfer transactions enable the exchange or transfer of these tokens between addresses\n\nContract Calls: Contracts can have functions that perform specific tasks. Contract call transactions invoke these functions, allowing users to interact with the contract\u2019s logic and retrieve information or trigger actions\n\nTransaction Batching: Batching involves combining multiple transactions into a single transaction, reducing the number of individual transactions sent to the network. This can optimize gas costs and improve efficiency by executing multiple actions within a single transaction\n\nStep 1: Select an Ethereum Blockchain Explorer\n\nThere are several Ethereum-focused blockchain explorers available, including:\n\nThese explorers are specifically designed to provide detailed information and insights into the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nOn the other hand, there are also blockchain explorers like Blockchain.com and TokenView that support multiple blockchain networks, including Ethereum. These explorers offer a broader scope, allowing users to explore and analyze transactions, addresses, and blocks across different blockchain platforms in addition to Ethereum.\n\nStep 2: Enter the Transaction Hash into the Blockchain Explorer\u2019s Search Field\n\nA transaction identifier, commonly referred to as a TxID, serves as a unique identifier associated with a particular transaction. Each transaction conducted on the blockchain, whether it involves on-chain activities or transfers to and from external addresses, is assigned a distinct TxID.\n\nDepending on the platform or wallet being used, the transaction identifier may also be referred to as a \u2018hash\u2019 or \u2018Txn Hash\u2019 which typically appears as an alphanumeric string consisting of random letters and numbers. For instance, on platforms like MetaMask, users can easily view the TxID by navigating to the \u2018Activity\u2019 tab and selecting the specific transaction of interest.\n\nIn addition to the transaction identifier (TxID or Hash), traders can utilize their public address to access an overview of their wallet activities. A public address is a string of 42 characters that corresponds to their public Ethereum account. This provides them with the ability to independently navigate to specific transactions within their wallet and obtain a comprehensive view of their transactional activities and associated details.\n\nStep 3: Click the Icon for \u2018Search\u2019 or \u2018Enter\u2019 on the Blockchain Explorer\n\nEntering a public address reveals the address\u2019 information, balances, and transfers.\n\nStep 4: Check if the Transaction was Successful or Not\n\nTo determine the success of an Ethereum transaction, you can rely on the information provided by a blockchain explorer. By searching for the transaction\u2019s details on a blockchain explorer, you will find indicators that reflect the state of the transaction.\n\nIf the transaction has been successfully validated and added to the blockchain, it will typically be labeled as \u2018success\u2019 or \u2018successful.\u2019\n\nOn Etherscan, successful transactions are marked with a green button and a check button that says \u2018Success.\u2019\n\nIn the absence of any error messages or indications of issues, it is generally safe to assume that the transaction has been successfully completed. Once a transaction has been validated and confirmed on the Ethereum blockchain, the Ether ($ETH) should be credited to the destination wallet or exchange account within 24hrs.\n\nFollow us on Twitter for the latest posts and updates\n\n_________________________________________\n\n_________________________________________"

        "content": "In the past 24 hours, Solana\u2019s NFT daily sales volume increased, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s for the first time since May 2022.\n\nDuring a 24-hour period from June 30, the Solana (SOL) network produced more NFT sales in volume than Ethereum (ETH). This contrasts with the high-value Ethereum NFT market, which has recently declined in trade volume.\n\nAccording to information provided by CryptoSlam, the sales of Solana NFTs on the secondary market generated close to $24.2 million over the previous day, while sales of Ethereum totaled $21.2 million.\n\nBlockchain sales by NFT volume | Source: CryptoSlam\n\nDespite the slight disparity between the platforms, this is the first time the smaller Solana market has surpassed Ethereum in terms of the dollar amount earned by sales over 24 hours in over one year. According to CryptoSlam, sales of Solana NFTs increased by 166.11% over that previous window\u2019s 24-hour period.\n\nYou might also like: Solana\u2019s Cardinal Protocol shuts down due to economic challenges\n\nLast year, Solana surpassed Ethereum in 24H sales volumes for the first time, reportedly fueled by Trippin\u2019 Ape Tribe.

As a result, it outperformed all other Ethereum and Solana initiatives during that time by a significant amount. Ethereum\u2019s Bored Ape Yacht Club, which generated $3.5 million in sales, came in second.\n\nOpenSea supports Solana NFTs\n\nSoon, these achievements might become more typical. In a recent fundraising round, OpenSea, a major NFT marketplace valued at $13.3 billion, announced that it would now support Solana NFTs. Before Polygon (MATIC) NFTs, OpenSea was only a marketplace for Ethereum NFTs. Shortly after, OpenSea\u2019s rival Rarible swiftly imitated OpenSea\u2019s actions and enabled Solana NFTs on its platform.\n\nEven though Solana is displaying several signs of growth, the Ethereum market continues to be considerably more valuable overall. According to CryptoSlam, Solana NFT trade volume over the past seven days has been close to $41 million, while Ethereum trading volume has been close to $166 million. The difference between Solana and Ethereum after 30 days considerably widen to about $380 million.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Share:\n\nNFT sales on Solana exceeded that on the Ethereum blockchain for the first time in the two altcoin\u2019s history.\n\n24 hour NFT sales on the Solana blockchain exceeded $25.5 million while on the Ethereum blockchain it was capped at $24.5 million.\n\nEthereum creator Vitalik Buterin recently expressed his support for Solana and other ETH competitors.\n\nSolana ranks among the altcoins labeled as \u201csecurities\u201d by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC\u2019s clampdown on cryptocurrencies triggered a steep decline in SOL price and resulted in a delisting of the altcoin across crypto exchanges.\n\nThe total NFT sales on Solana exceeded that on Ethereum for the first time in the two altcoins\u2019 history.\n\nAlso read: Attorney John Deaton says Judge Torres decision on SEC vs. Ripple is important to crypto for this reason\n\nNFT trade on Solana explodes in a 24 hour timeframe\n\nThe total volume of NFT sales on the Solana blockchain crossed $25.5 million, based on data from tracker Sol Bulletin. At the same time, the NFT trade volume on the Ethereum blockchain exceeded $24.5 million, lagging behind Solana by nearly a million.\n\nNFT sales volume by blockchain\n\nFor the first time in the history of the two altcoin blockchains, Solana outperformed Ethereum. This is a key milestone for SOL as the asset is tackling selling pressure from the SEC\u2019s crackdown and series of delisting across crypto exchanges and social trading platforms.\n\nSolana price failed to catch up with the surge in the altcoin\u2019s NFT trade volume. Interestingly, the DeFi protocols building on the Solana ecosystem are no match for Ethereum, therefore the NFT sales volume supported the theory of rising adoption and utility of the SOL blockchain.\n\nDeFi data tracker DeFiLlama pegs the total volume locked (TVL) in the Ethereum blockchain at $26.7 billion, while for Solana it is a meager $265.57 million. If the NFT trade volume on the Solana blockchain continues rising, there is a likelihood of the protocol\u2019s TVL climbing in the long term, fueling SOL price recovery."

Per data from Dune Analytics, 35,932 ENS name registrations were made in June alone.\n\nInterestingly, while monthly. eth name registrations ended Q2 with a rally, primary ENS name registrations experienced a significant decline. A primary ENS name is a unique domain name registered and associated with an Ethereum address on the ENS platform.\n\nFurther, protocol revenue logged a decline, according to Token Terminal. Notably, ENS registered a cumulative $4.8 million as profit between 1 April and 30 June. Inasmuch, its revenue dipped by 21% during this period.\n\nAccording to the data provider, on an annualized basis, ENS\u2019 revenue has fallen by 5.11%.\n\nIncreased purchase of ENS tokens\n\nA look at ENS\u2019 price performance on a daily chart revealed an uptick in ENS accumulation since the middle of June. Since then, the alt\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) indicators have been on an uptrend.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ENS worth today?\n\nIn the same position at press time, they rested at 56.24 and 73.90, respectively. Within the same period, ENS has logged a corresponding 22% growth in value.\n\nWith the alt\u2019s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator posting slightly elongated histogram bars and its MACD line resting above the trend line, a bullish run was underway at press time."

        "content": "In a recent Podcast, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin expressed his concerns about the security of the Ethereum 2.0 network, which is currently in the process of transitioning from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. PoS is supposed to make the network more scalable, energy-efficient and decentralized, but it also introduces new risks and challenges.\n\nOne of the main issues that Buterin highlighted is the possibility of a large-scale theft of the staked ETH, which are the tokens that validators lock up in order to participate in the network and earn rewards. According to Buterin, there are two scenarios in which this could happen: a software bug or a malicious attack.\n\nA software bug could occur if there is a flaw in the code of the Ethereum 2.0 client software, which is responsible for running the nodes and validating the transactions. If such a bug is exploited, it could allow an attacker to steal or manipulate the staked ETH of other validators, or even cause the network to fork or halt. Buterin said that this is a \u201clow-probability but high-impact\u201d event, and that the developers are working hard to ensure that the code is as secure and bug-free as possible.\n\nA malicious attack could occur if a large enough group of validators colludes to take over the network and censor or revert transactions. This is known as a \u201c51% attack\u201d, and it is theoretically possible in any blockchain network. However, Buterin argued that this is more likely to happen in PoS than in PoW, because PoS makes it easier and cheaper for validators to acquire a majority stake in the network. He said that this is a \u201chigh-probability but low-impact\u201d event, and that the network has built-in mechanisms to deter and punish such behavior.\n\nButerin estimated that the total value of the staked ETH on Ethereum 2.0 is currently over $40 billion, making it a very attractive target for hackers and attackers. He said that this is one of the reasons why he is not staking his own ETH on the network, and that he prefers to keep his tokens in cold storage. He also advised other users to be careful and vigilant when staking their ETH, and to use reputable and trustworthy staking services or platforms.\n\nButerin concluded by saying that he is optimistic about the future of Ethereum 2.0, and that he believes that the benefits of PoS outweigh the risks. He said that he expects the network to become more secure, stable and efficient over time, as more validators join and more features are implemented. He also said that he hopes that Ethereum 2.0 will inspire other blockchain projects to adopt PoS and contribute to the innovation and growth of the crypto space.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

        "content": "In a recent community call, the team behind the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) revealed plans to adopt a Layer-2 platform in light of increasing gas fees on the mainnet. In response to this planned move, ENS prices climbed roughly 10%, floating higher with increasing trading volumes, evident in the daily chart.\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service\n\nENS is a decentralized naming system on Ethereum. It provides an easy-to-use and human-readable naming system that allows users to rename mainnet addresses, smart contracts, and other resources. This system permits users to create and employ memorable domain names instead of complicated addresses.\n\nThe team behind the ENS believes their solution makes it easier for everyone to interact with the pioneer smart contracting platform, and is handy, especially in sending and receiving transactions. In this arrangement, the platform maps a user\u2019s domain, the human-readable address, with their original address or deployed smart contract on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nHowever, since ENS maps all addresses on the Ethereum mainnet, transaction fees apply, a concern considering the fluctuating gas fees on Ethereum. In Ethereum, all transactions, including transfers or smart contract deployment, must be paid for. The amount paid depends on the level of demand in the network, and the value tends to be volatile. Over the past few weeks, Ethereum gas fees have been rising.\n\nFluctuating Gas Fees\n\nAccording to YCharts data on June 30, the average gas fee for sending a transaction stood at $34.62, down from $42.77 recorded on June 5. As of May 12, it stood at $77.88. The only time gas fees on Ethereum fell was on June 25, when it was at $16.58. At this level, the gas fee is relatively high compared to other networks. For example, the average transaction fee in Bitcoin was $2.383 on June 30, down from $9.018 on May 12.\n\nMeanwhile, in layer-2 platforms, transaction fees and smart contract deployment costs are relatively lower, according to trackers. As an illustration, gas fees on Optimism, a popular Ethereum layer-2, is $0.03 as of July 2.\n\nConsidering the high gas fees on Ethereum, ENS, via two improvement proposals, ENSIP-10 and EIP-3668, will further expand to a Layer-2 platform as a relief for users sensitive to high gas fees on Ethereum as part enhancing interoperability. During the call, the team said this would scale the platform and open the service to more people.\n\nIn response, ENS prices are up 10% on the last trading day, changing hands at $9.42 at the back of increasing trading volumes. Still, it remains to be seen whether prices will continue edging higher once the platform migrates to a Layer-2 platform. For now, ENS has registered over 2.73 million names owned by more than 697,000 entities.\n\nFeatured image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Furthermore, the network also saw a 25% surge in buyers and a 23% surge in sellers along with the wash volume up by almost 79%.\n\nFurthermore, data from the intelligence platform Santiment depicted that the development activity metric could use some effort from the developer end. This was because, at press time, ETH\u2019s development activity stood at 39.32, which was strikingly lower considering the trend over the last few days.\n\nHowever, ETH\u2019s volume witnessed a spike as of 30 June. A rise in the volume along with a price movement in the positive direction could indicate a sign that investor were accumulating the altcoin. Furthermore, the weighted sentiment towards ETH also showed slow but steady improvement since touching a bottom on 9 June.\n\nWho sides with ETH?\n\nA tweet posted by the Ethereum Fear and Greed Index stated that the investor sentiment in the market was that of greed as the number stood at 55. However, does ETH\u2019s daily chart reflect the same?\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading 4.22% higher than its opening price for the day. Additionally, looking at the position of ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI), it could be stated that there was significant buying pressure in the market. This was because ETH\u2019s RSI stood at 60.25 and was seen moving towards the overbought zone.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today\n\nAdditionally, ETH\u2019s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line (blue) stood above the signal line (red) above the zero line. This indicated a strong bullish movement for ETH. However, despite the bulls supporting ETH as of 30 June, traders should maintain caution.\n\nThis was because ETH\u2019s Awesome Oscillator (AO) flashed red bars above the zero line. A slight dip in the buying pressure may drive changes to the position of the indicators and a price correction for ETH."

        "content": "After a week-long rally, the crypto market is taking a breather. Most cryptocurrencies that were on a surge are seeing minor market corrections. Bitcoin (BTC) is still trading above $30,000, and Ethereum (ETH) is trading above $1800. A price analysis of both suggests another rally is on the way.\n\nHowever, both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have huge market capitalizations. They have already had years of explosive growth. They may still show profits, but they will be minor.\n\nTMS Network (TMSN), on the other hand, is a newly launched small-cap cryptocurrency with a great value proposition. This sets it up for a robust rally. Industry experts forecast a 100-fold increase during the upcoming bull run. This has made the token a hot pick among investors in its ongoing presale.\n\nTMS Network (TMSN) is a newly launched decentralized trading platform with many unique features, including margin trading, social trading, and an integrated derivatives market. This has made it attractive to traders looking for a more seamless and enjoyable trading experience.\n\nRead on as we examine expert projections for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), as well as the potential of TMS Network (TMSN) as a more promising pick.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction\n\nLast week, Bitcoin (BTC) embarked on a remarkable rally, temporarily surpassing the $31,000 mark to signal a comeback. The spike began shortly after BlackRock announced the launch of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). This was quickly followed by similar announcements from Fidelity Digital Assets and Citadel Securities. The resulting excitement caused Bitcoin (BTC) to rise 16.5% in one week, setting a new yearly high.\n\nThe current price of Bitcoin (BTC) is $30,519, with a daily trading volume of $13,551,974,388 and a market cap of $592,467,241,402. Bitcoin (BTC) has gained 1.67% in the last 24 hours and 3.79% in the last week. It is the largest cryptocurrency in the entire ecosystem, with a 50.4% market share.\n\nBitcoin is facing significant resistance at the $30,700 and $30,932 levels. If Bitcoin (BTC) breaks over this level, it will reclaim $31,000, with the next resistance level at $31,190.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Prediction\n\nEthereum (ETH) has managed to maintain a generally bullish year despite all the turmoil. ETH has traded above the crucial support level of $1075 for the better part of 2023.\n\nThe recent buzz surrounding Bitcoin ETFs spilled over to Ethereum (ETH), creating an upward trend that saw the token trade between $1,872.94 and $1,932.53 last week. Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $1,849.58, with a daily trading volume of $6,350,186,741. It is the second largest cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin (BTC), with a market valuation of $222,332,625,253. Ethereum (ETH) holds a market share of 18.9%.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has dropped 1.51% in the last 24 hours and 2.09% in the last seven days.\n\nIn a bullish scenario, Ethereum (ETH) should grow by 0.10% during the next week, reaching $ 1,858.24. ETH faces resistance around $1,868.03, $1,904.49, and the highest resistance at $1,932.53.\n\nTMS Network (TMSN) is more Attractive For Explosive Gains\n\nWhile Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum promise around 10% growth, TMS Network (TMSN) is on course for nearly 500%. TMSN has recently been dominating in presale, hitting one milestone after another. The presale recently surpassed $6.2 million, with more investors continuing to make deposits.\n\nTMS Network (TMSN) not only has the potential for explosive growth, but it also has a strong value proposition. The trading ecosystem is brimming with tools to help traders maximize profits. These include strategy builders, MT4 and MT5 compatibility, and on-chain analytics.\n\nThe platform goes to great lengths to accommodate even novice traders. Anyone can follow and copy the most successful traders on the TMS Network (TMSN) Social Trading Network and profit from their trades. The platform also provides trading classes that instruct users from the most fundamental notions of price analysis up to a pro-level, helping them become better traders.\n\nFinally, TMS Network (TMSN) offers a unique revenue-sharing model that ties everything together. Holders of TMSN tokens earn commissions on trading volumes generated by other traders on the platform. This encourages increased trading activity, which generates more revenue for the platform and token holders.\n\nOverall, TMS Network (TMSN) is an exciting project with the potential to shift the way people trade derivatives and turn token holders into millionaires. The network\u2019s ongoing presale campaign provides a fantastic opportunity to purchase the TMSN token at a discount and enjoy explosive gains once the project launches into the market.\n\nFor more information on TMS Network (TMSN):\n\nPresale: https://presale.tmsnetwork.io/\n\nWebsite: https://tmsnetwork.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/tmsnetworkio\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/tmsnetwork_io\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Solana (SOL) Still Standing: Can It Challenge Ethereum (ETH) in the Long Run? - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "Solana has emerged as a serious contender to Ethereum due to its high speed, low transaction fees, and scalability.\n\nSolana\u2019s key innovations, including Proof-of-History (PoH), Tower Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), and Turbine, enhance its performance and network throughput.\n\nAccording to a report from the Finance Feed on Binance, Ethereum has been a significant player in the blockchain industry, particularly in the realms of decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi). However, its scalability issues and high transaction fees have opened the door for other networks to compete. Solana, a blockchain network, has quickly gained attention for its high speed, low fees, and scalability, positioning itself as a promising alternative to Ethereum.\n\nSolana\u2019s Advantages Over Ethereum\n\nCompared to Ethereum, Solana stands out with its high speed, low transaction fees, and scalability. It has achieved this by building scalability into its Layer 1, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which rely on Layer 2 solutions. Additionally, Solana utilizes a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, offering greater scalability and energy efficiency compared to Bitcoin\u2019s energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism.\n\nKey Innovations Enhancing Solana\u2019s Performance\n\nSolana has introduced key design innovations that enhance its performance. First, the Proof-of-History (PoH) protocol establishes a chronological timeline for transactions, reducing transaction overhead and increasing network throughput. Tower Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) reduces network latency and enhances speed and efficiency. Finally, the Turbine protocol implements data sharding, increasing the network\u2019s capacity to handle large traffic volumes.\n\nChallenges and Concerns\n\nDespite its performance advantages, Solana has faced security concerns and network outages due to excessive transactions. To address these issues, Solana has partnered with Jump Crypto to build a new validator client, aiming to increase the network\u2019s throughput capacity. The successful mitigation of these issues will be crucial for Solana\u2019s long-term success.\n\nThe Quest for Mass Adoption\n\nTo challenge Ethereum and achieve mass adoption, Solana needs to maintain scalability and infrastructure as the user base and number of transactions increase. Interoperability with other blockchains through technologies like the Wormhole bridge will attract users and developers. Additionally, fostering a strong developer community to build diverse dApps will be essential for Solana\u2019s growth.\n\nThe Investor\u2019s Perspective\n\nOne anonymous crypto investor believes Solana still has the potential to challenge Ethereum. The investor questions whether Ethereum\u2019s 40x larger market cap truly reflects its superiority and suggests that Solana could become a strong competitor if it continues to innovate, provide better scalability, lower costs, and attract more dApps.\n\nConclusion\n\nSolana has emerged as a serious competitor to Ethereum, offering high speed, low transaction fees, and scalability. While challenges remain, addressing security concerns, maintaining scalability, fostering interoperability, and building a vibrant developer community will be crucial for Solana\u2019s long-term success. With its promising position in the blockchain industry, Solana has the potential to become a leading Layer 1 blockchain and challenge Ethereum\u2019s dominance.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum naming system developers plan to utilize off-chain resolvers.\n\nENS achieved an impressive milestone of over 2.2 million registered domain names.\n\nDuring a community call on Thursday, ENS Labs, the Ethereum Name Service developer (ENS), announced its plans to integrate Layer 2 interoperability with ENS domains. This decentralized domain name system, built on the Ethereum blockchain, aims to enhance its functionality by enabling seamless communication between Layer 2 solutions and ENS domains.\n\nThe team emphasized the significance of Layer 2 interoperability as a vital upcoming enhancement. Layer 2 solutions, such as Arbitrum and Optimism, improve scalability and reduce costs by facilitating off-chain transaction processing separate from the Layer 1 Ethereum blockchain.\n\nRecognizing the importance of accessibility, the team aims to enable the interaction between Layer 2 solutions and ENS domains. This initiative seeks to broaden the user base by making domain name registrations and transactions more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nENS\u2019s Plans for Layer 2 Interoperability\n\nAs Ethereum gained popularity, the surge in gas prices prompted market participants to seek more economical alternatives. Among these alternatives is the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which had previously expressed its plans to implement Layer 2 interoperability.\n\nThis has been in the works for some time and involves the incorporation of ENSIP-10 for Wildcard Resolution and EIP-3668 for CCIP Read, enabling secure off-chain data retrieval. According to the developers, enabling the interaction between current solutions and ENS domains would enhance accessibility regarding domain name registrations and transactions for a broader range of users.\n\nLooking ahead, the Ethereum naming system developers plan to utilize off-chain resolvers by implementing an ENS off-chain registrar contract and partnerships with various service providers. These providers include cb.id, a project operated by Coinbase, Lens Protocol on the Polygon network and OptiNames on Optimism, among others. By leveraging these resources, the developers aim to facilitate seamless integration and expand the reach of ENS domains.\n\nGasless Import: ENS Roadmap Feature to Lower Barriers and Enhance Web Accessibility\n\nThe ENS team announced the close collaboration between ENS Labs and web-integrated domain name TLDs such as .art and .box. This collaboration aims to establish seamless integration, allowing users to register browser-supported names through the ENS platform. Additionally, it marks a significant milestone as DNS names can be traded as NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain for the first time this year.\n\nDuring the community call, the team discussed a new feature added to the roadmap. This feature entails the option to import DNS, the web naming protocol, into ENS without incurring any transaction costs, making it a \u201cgasless\u201d process. Additionally, this upcoming feature, scheduled for release in the third quarter of the year, has the potential to enhance web accessibility within the ENS ecosystem and reduce barriers for traditional internet users, as highlighted by the team.\n\nEthereum Name Service Domain Registrations\n\nUndeterred by the tumultuous state of the digital asset market in the previous year, ENS achieved an impressive milestone of over 2.2 million registered domain names. Furthermore, this number has consistently increased, reaching a current total of 2.73 million spread across nearly 700,000 unique addresses. To further enhance accessibility and convenience, ENS introduced a new fiat on-ramp for domain registrations in April.\n\nThis innovative feature, facilitated through the Web3 fiat payment gateway MoonPay, allowed Web3 users to register decentralized .eth domains seamlessly. Additionally, this integration enabled users to utilize popular fiat payment options like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and debit and credit cards, expanding the range of choices available for domain registration.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "content": "In a recent exchange with Matt Huang, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Paradigm, a crypto-focused venture capital firm, Ethereum\u2019s creator Vitalik Buterin expressed his concerns over the U.S. policy approach to cryptocurrency. His comments came in the wake of the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, two of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s allegations against Binance and Coinbase include offering unregistered securities to the public. The lawsuits have also cast a shadow over several other tokens, including Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Coti (COTI), Algorand (ALGO), Filecoin (FIL), Cosmos (ATOM), Sandbox (SAND), Axie infinity (AXS), Decentraland (MANA), BNB (BNB), Voyager Token (VGX), Chiliz (CHZ), NEAR protocol (NEAR), Flow (FLOW), Dash (DASH), NEXO (NEXO), and Internet Computer (ICP).\n\nThese allegations have left the status of these tokens in a state of uncertainty, creating risks for markets and participants transacting in these tokens, as well as potentially for their creators. This was highlighted by Jesse Overall and Steve Gatti, attorneys at the UK-based law firm Clifford Chance, in a recent conversation with CoinDesk.\n\nIn this context, Buterin\u2019s comments reflect a sense of solidarity with other blockchain projects, particularly Solana. He expressed regret that Solana and other projects are being targeted in this manner, stating, \u201cThey don\u2019t deserve it, and if Ethereum ends up \u2018winning\u2019 through all other blockchains getting kicked off exchanges, that\u2019s not an honorable way to win, and in the long term probably isn\u2019t even a victory.\u201d\n\nButerin\u2019s comments underscore the fact that the real competition for blockchain projects is not each other but the rapidly expanding centralized world that is imposing itself on the decentralized space. He concluded his remarks by wishing all \u201chonorable projects\u201d a fair outcome in the ongoing situation."

        "title": "June NFT market shake-up: Ethereum reigns, Bitcoin falters | - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "There\u2019s a surprising shift in the ether winds of the non-fungible token (NFT) realm as Ethereum solidifies its dominance while Bitcoin\u2019s momentum ebbs. In this article, we take an illuminating journey into the depths of the NFT market landscape as it stood in June 2023.\n\nEthereum ascends as Bitcoin descends\n\nEthereum-based NFTs made a mark in June, with total sales eclipsing the $452 million milestone, which equates to over 63% of the entire NFT market\u2019s turnover.\n\nThis represented a nearly 8% growth from May\u2019s sales, reinforcing Ethereum\u2019s stronghold over the market, especially as Bitcoin-based NFT transactions fell.\n\nThe king of cryptocurrency saw a staggering fall of 42.36% from May to June, closing the month with a total of $110.3 million, a significant decrease from the previous month.\n\nSolana, however, held a different narrative. It played the part of an unexpected dark horse, showcasing an impressive surge in its NFT sales. Solana\u2019s NFT transactions skyrocketed by a staggering 65%, reaching an astounding $70.42 million.\n\nThis surprising growth story demonstrated the potential of Solana\u2019s infrastructure for NFT enthusiasts and investors.\n\nMythos and Polygon trail behind amid the shift\n\nFurther down the ranks, Mythos and Polygon, despite their emerging platforms, unfortunately experienced a dip in their NFT transactions. Mythos saw a slump of nearly 20%, recording $28,322,124 in NFT sales.\n\nPolygon fared worse, suffering a sharp 45.91% drop to $27,846,781. This shows that not all networks could weather the market fluctuations and compete effectively against the might of Ethereum or ride on the rapid momentum of Solana.\n\nJune marked the meteoric rise of an unsung hero \u2013 Uncategorized Ordinals. The collection outpaced other contenders in the NFT market, boasting sales of a whopping $52.91 million, which marked a modest but crucial 1.44% increase from May.\n\nTrailing behind it was the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), which posted sales of $49.76 million, a robust 28.20% higher than its performance in May. Other noteworthy NFT collections that marked their presence were Azuki, Azuki Elemental, and SMB Barrel Raffle.\n\nNoteworthy NFT sales: The exception to the rule\n\nDespite Bitcoin\u2019s struggle, it had a prominent presence among the highest-priced NFT sales for June. In a fascinating twist, four of the top five most valuable NFT sales were based on Bitcoin, proving that Bitcoin\u2019s appeal still holds sway among some sections of the NFT market.\n\nThe sole exception was the Ethereum-based NFT, Fidenza #545.\n\nJune brought about a shift in the NFT market that underlines the dynamic nature of this digital assets landscape. The surge of Ethereum and the rise of Solana, alongside Bitcoin\u2019s falter, point to a market that is constantly evolving.\n\nThese shifts invite market participants to remain vigilant and adapt to the changes. It will be intriguing to watch how these patterns evolve as we venture further into the world of NFTs."

He stated his views on the Ethereum Project by expressing his thankfulness to work with prominent cryptographers, mathematicians, and economists.\n\nEthereum is popular for its variety of uses, such as staking, DeFi, and investing. Vitalik Buterin holds over 240,000 ETH at his address, which is nearly $400 Million.\n\nJourney of Vitalik Buterin before Inventing Ethereum\n\nVitalik\u2019s father, Dmitry, is a computer scientist. Vitalik lived in Russia till the age of six, and then moved to Canada where he was placed in the class of gifted children in the 3rd standard. He was drawn to mathematics, programming, and economics. He attended high school in Toronto, and learned about Bitcoin at the age of 17 from his father.\n\nAfter completing his schooling, he attended the University of Waterloo where he took advanced courses, and was the research assistant for cryptographer Ian Goldberg, who co-created Off the Record Messaging . In 2012, for Informatics he won a bronze medal in the International Olympiad in Italy.\n\nIn 2013, to share his excitement and knowledge about the code he visited developers in other countries. He returned to Toronto later that year and published a white paper proposing Ethereum. He went to work on Ethereum full time in 2014 after dropping out of the university. On 30 November 2018, Buterin received an honorary doctorate from the faculty of Business and Economics of the University of Basel.\n\nIn 2011, he started writing for a publication, Bitcoin Weekly, where the owner offered five bitcoins to anyone who would write an article for him. He continued writing till the site was closed due to insufficient revenue. Later in the same year, in September, he was hired as a co-founder and writer for Bitcoin Magazine. In 2012, it came to print edition, fully dedicated to cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn 2018, his father suggested that Buterin shift his attention to research. Buterin stated he realized the horrors centralized services can bring and soon decided to quit.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s Association with Other Open Source Projects\n\nVitalik Buterin is the CMO at ERCSwap, Founder and Developer at Tokeneo and Founder and Inventor at Ethereum Foundation. ERCSwap was founded on May 9, 2022. It is an open source trusted peer to peer NFT trading and swap system, and part of the Ethereum Foundation. The Tokeneo community owns 90% of the Ethereum based TEO tokens.\n\nAs a developer, Vitalik has also contributed to open source software projects such as DarkWallet by Dody Wilson, Bitcoin Python libraries and cryptocurrency marketplace site Egora.\n\nIn a recent AMA session, he has described his least favorite aspect of cryptocurrency. Replying to David Hoffman in the session he said he faced disappointment in those who perceive the main innovation of cryptocurrency to be merely tokenization. Buterin also suggested ways to create amity between Ethereum and Bitcoin supporters.\n\nAnother sparkling news is how Elon Musk started following Vitalik Buterin on Twitter, and this forms the base to speculations about potential collaborations. He also tweeted the word Ethereum in April 2019. Buterin then extended an invitation to Musk to attend a conference. Musk responded to the query about potential developments on the Ethereum platform.\n\nEthereum Current Statistics\n\nThe market cap of Ethereum is up by 1.86% and it is currently at $226B. Its volume is up by 19.35% at $7B. It has a circulating supply of 120,220,157.47 ETH.\n\nAs per coinmarketcap chart on July 1, 2022 the number of whales are 26.5M, investors are 21.8M, and retail of 70.5M which has risen to 34.3M whales, 17.0M investors, and 70.7M retail on 28th June 2023.\n\nSource: coinmarketcap\n\nSummary\n\nVitalik Buterin said he wants to expand Ethereum, by undergoing three major changes on Ethereum i.e., better privacy measures, scaling solutions, and secure wallets."

        "content": "Solana Co-Founder envisions Ethereum as a potential layer-2 solution for SOL, highlighting the feasibility of the integration\n\nIntegration would provide SOL asset holders on Ethereum with finality guarantees and secure exit options back to Solana.\n\nIntegration may have implications for DeFi protocols, with potential limitations and challenges for AMMs and non-flash loan borrowing and lending.\n\nAnatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana Labs, has sparked interest by suggesting that Ethereum (ETH) could serve as a layer-2 solution for the Solana (SOL) blockchain. Despite the concept initially appearing ambitious, Yakovenko highlights its feasibility and potential benefits.\n\nIn a recent series of tweets, Yakovenko delved into the intricacies of integrating Ethereum as a layer-2 solution for Solana. He revealed that the technical collaboration between the two platforms is more plausible than commonly perceived.\n\nLayer-2 solutions tackle scalability challenges faced by blockchains such as Ethereum, which often suffer from congestion and high transaction fees during peak activity. Solana, renowned for its exceptional throughput and cost-efficiency, offers an ideal ecosystem for diverse decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nYakovenko emphasized the significance of layer-2 solutions as bridge protocols that provide one-way security. Should Ethereum become a layer-2 for Solana, holders of SOL assets on the Ethereum blockchain would enjoy the assurance of \u201cfinality guarantees.\u201d This means they could confidently transition back to Solana, even in scenarios involving transaction double spends or invalid state transitions.\n\nSuccessful implementation of this arrangement would involve Yakovenko\u2019s proposal to submit all Ethereum transactions to Solana. Additionally, a Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) root would need to be submitted, serving as evidence of consensus among Ethereum validators regarding the network\u2019s state.\n\nTo ensure the integrity of the bridge protocol, a bridge timeout mechanism would be essential in detecting and resolving potential faults. Yakovenko highlights examples of faults such as conflicting SPVs for the root, invalid root computation, and censorship, which must be identified and addressed.\n\nWould it be possible for ethereum to be a @solana L2? Probably more likely than you might think at first glance. L2s are bridge protocols that provide one way security. In this setup, holders of solana assets on ethereum would have finality guarantees that they can exit back\u2026 https://t.co/XE5ETsxGIW \u2014 toly ????????

While holding SOL assets on the Ethereum blockchain is deemed safe, Yakovenko warns against lending or maintaining positions against them.\n\nOne significant risk is the potential occurrence of an Ethereum fault or a contentious social consensus fork within the Ethereum network. In such a scenario, the representation of Solana assets held on Ethereum may become disconnected from the consensus fork, rendering these assets effectively worthless.\n\nYakovenko draws parallels to the experience of holding USDC on Ethereum\u2019s Proof-of-Work (EthPow) chain, where certain tokens may lose value or functionality due to network issues or changes. Lending Solana-based USDC on Ethereum could lead to a situation where borrowers can withdraw real USDC on the Solana network, while lenders on Ethereum receive \u201cjunk tokens.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the integration of Solana assets on Ethereum may have implications for various DeFi protocols. While central limit order books (CLOBs) are expected to remain functional, automated market makers (AMMs) and non-flash loan borrowing and lending protocols could face limitations or challenges. This could potentially result in inefficiencies or constraints in liquidity provision and trading.\n\nIt would be safe to hold solana assets on ethereum, but not safe to lend them or maintain positions against them. This is because once there is an ethereum fault, ethereum state on solana becomes separated from ethereum the social consensus fork. Solana users can get their\u2026 \u2014 toly ???????? (@aeyakovenko) July 2, 2023\n\nAnatoly Yakovenko\u2019s recent proposal aligns with the concerns raised by Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, regarding the regulatory scrutiny faced by various cryptocurrency projects, including Solana. The recent lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against Binance categorized Solana as unregistered securities.\n\nExpressing his disappointment, Buterin took to Twitter last week, stating that such projects do not deserve regulatory crackdowns. He emphasized that if Ethereum were to \u201cwin\u201d by default, due to other blockchains being removed from exchanges, it would not be an honorable victory and might not even be considered a true triumph in the long run.\n\nEnhance Your Crypto Trading Skills With Our Legends Trading Masterclass"

        "content": "Don\u2019t invest unless prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nJoin Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage\n\nA GMX crypto whale that has been on an ETH shorting spree might be facing huge liquidation soon.\n\nPnL data shows that they are in danger of losing 80% of their funds if the Ethereum price touches the $1950 mark.\n\nPopular crypto Twitter influencer Taiki Maeda made his community aware of this situation via his tweet.\n\nLet's track this $ETH shorter on $GMX together On-chain positions create a social element to taking/monitoring positions, versus people just posting PnL after winning CEX trades. Never been a big fan of \"copy-trade\" platforms but might gain more traction If on-chain perps level\u2026 https://t.co/5XNds8jOBx \u2014 Taiki Maeda (@TaikiMaeda2) June 23, 2023\n\nMany crypto influencers on Twitter are asking, \u201cwhy so many shorts\u201d after seeing a chart showing that the GMX whale has shorted ETH 24 times between June 18th to June 22nd alone.\n\nGMX Trader Can\u2019t Stop Shorting\n\nThe GMX whale has implemented this strategy of shorting ETH in a way that no one can explain. Many are saying that he is implementing Delta Hedge. And others are countering that argument by saying that it would not be ideal to use GMX to implement this strategy.\n\nWhat is Delta Hedge? Delta Hedge is an options trading strategy that a trader implements to reduce or hedge the risk related to the price movements of an underlying asset.\n\nThe yellow circles represent the shorting zones\n\nOne user has also stated that it is pretty \u201cinsane\u201d that the whale has conditioned their orders to add all the way to their liquidity.\n\nAs you can see from this data, the liquidity price has been set at $1953. That is the reason many investors are wondering why the whale would take that position.\n\nAnd some investors are being cheeky about it, saying that GMX bears are adding a margin to their already low position.\n\nClick here to check to monitor the whale\u2019s action by yourself.\n\nGMX Price Analysis\n\nWhen it comes to GMX, the price of the asset has been stable above the $53 range since last month. The chart shows that mid-June was the only time that the token dropped in the red zones, crashing past the $45 mark.\n\nBut a quick rebound has allowed it to move past the $52.98 support. The current candle shows red signs. If GMX falls below its current support, it will try to stay above $50.\n\nCurrently, the token\u2019s RSI is around 55 \u2013 keeping it a bit in the oversold zone. But GMX\u2019s current stable trend doesn\u2019t make it seem like it will drop any time soon.\n\nMaybe They Know Something We Don\u2019t \u2013 Twitter\n\nThe whale\u2019s recent actions have started a slew of conspiracy theories, with many saying that the trader knows something that we don\u2019t. While others say that the trader might know too much.\n\nmaybe he knows too much \u2014 zkspy\ud83d\udfe0 (@Krypt0psy) June 25, 2023\n\nGMX is performing similarly to Ethereum (in a stable state). Ethereum\u2019s current price chart on CoinMarketCap doesn\u2019t show any volatility other than a little morning dip. At press time, it is trading around the $1916 mark.\n\nYou can check out our yearly price predictions about Ethereum in our Ethereum price forecast guide.\n\nWhich Other Cryptos Whales Are Buying?\n\nWhile we have highlighted shorter crypto in our article, they are not the only ones making rounds in the market. There are other tokens that users are interested in. Most of them are available as presales.\n\nPresale tokens are favored by those who don\u2019t want to deal with the current volatility of the crypto market. While the recent trends are showing some signs of stability for the tokens we have mentioned, all it would take is one negative news to spread, and the bears might take over.\n\nIn such situations, presales allow users to make gains without being subject to the market\u2019s erratic behavior. This is why some of the best presales that whales are interested in include the following:\n\nWall Street Memes (WSM)\n\nWall Street Memes is a community-centric asset that leverages memes to grow up in value. Inspired by the Reddit Group Wall Street Bets, Wall Street Memes aims to transform memecoins \u2013 a seemingly \u201cuseless\u201d asset into a wealth generator.\n\nThe token\u2019s appeal has grown since the launch of its presale. And it has already raised more than $11.7 million at press time. The community backing this token has a million followers across multiple social media platforms, and even Elon Musk has interacted with the group.\n\nThese factors can fuel it to make it the next 10x crypto of this year.\n\nThug Life (THUG)\n\nAnother token to have been inspired by the memecoin genre and has gained a lot of attention in a short time is Thug Life.\n\nThug Life is a \u201cballer\u2019s\u201d memecoin inspired by the \u201cThug Life\u201d mean, representing stoic individuals who got a perfect comeback for everything. That \u201cgrind\u201d mentality also permeates across Thug Life\u2019s official website, whose content uses \u201cstreet talk\u201d to communicate what the project is about.\n\nThug Life has been able to use this uniqueness to raise more than $180k within three days.\n\nIt is one of the top four crypto assets recommended by our resident crypto expert \u2013 Jacob Crypto Bury.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile GMX\u2019s whale recent move is heading them toward liquidation, there is a bigger picture that many retail investors aren\u2019t seeing. This is why investors must look for alternative investment opportunities, such as Wall Street Memes and Thug Life.\n\nBoth are highly popular memecoin presales that have quickly gained the market\u2019s attention. And if they follow the same trends as other ICOs in the past, early movers might make a 10x return.\n\nRelated\n\nNew Crypto Mining Platform - Bitcoin Minetrix Rating Audited By Coinsult\n\nDecentralized, Secure Cloud Mining\n\nEarn Free Bitcoin Daily\n\nNative Token On Presale Now - BTCMTX\n\nStaking Rewards - Over 50% APY Learn More"
