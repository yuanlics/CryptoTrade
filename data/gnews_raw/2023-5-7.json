        "title": "Ethereum in 2 Charts: Is It Time to Sell? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH -0.01%), the world's second most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, is in a unique position. Since the start of the year it is up more than 50%, and yet it is still down more than 60% from its all-time high of almost $4,900.\n\nBecause of its hot start in 2023, it can be difficult to gauge whether Ethereum is a buy or a sell today. To get an answer to this question we need to do a little digging to find data from Ethereum's network that provides some historical context on its current position in the market.\n\nThe foundation for The Merge\n\nOne of the most important developments to come out of the cryptocurrency industry recently was The Merge, an upgrade that switched Ethereum from the clunky and energy-consuming proof-of-work method of verifying transactions to the more robust and energy-efficient proof-of-stake method.\n\nHowever, although The Merge dominated headlines, there is a lesser-known upgrade that is likely more meaningful for Ethereum's price than it is given credit for.\n\nKnown as the London hard fork, this upgrade was introduced in August 2021 and included a new pricing mechanism with a fixed base fee to be burned, or permanently destroyed. Essentially, the more transactions that occur on the network, the greater the number of ether tokens that could be removed from the supply. Because the fixed base fee is permanently removed from circulation, under some circumstances the total number of ether in circulation can actually decrease.\n\nData by TradingView\n\nBecause of the London hard fork Ethereum has effectively become a deflationary asset, as the chart above shows. It can be a little difficult to see, but around the end of 2022 the line showing the total supply of ether starts to bend. It was around this time that the number of transactions on the network started to increase, causing the burn mechanism to truly start to become evident.\n\nThanks to this new feature, Ethereum's price is now highly correlated to the dynamics of supply and demand. Before the London hard fork, Ethereum had a relatively high inflation rate, but now this has all changed and it could mean great things for Ethereum's price, especially if a bull market is on the horizon.\n\nContinued growth of active users\n\nThere is another metric we can look at to get a better idea of Ethereum's current valuation versus its potential future price. It's relatively simple, but evaluation of the number of active addresses on the Ethereum blockchain can provide a useful glimpse at activity on the network. Active addresses are the number of unique addresses that have either sent or received a transaction on the blockchain during a certain period, and the thinking goes that the greater the number of active addresses, the more demand for the cryptocurrency.\n\nData by TradingView\n\nWhen taking a look at these addresses, it becomes clear that while there has been a downtrend since the market peak in 2021, there has been substantial growth in recent months. It suggests that more people are using the blockchain for various purposes, such as making payments, creating decentralized applications, and executing smart contracts. As the number of users on the Ethereum network increases, so does the amount of ether burned, thus adding more deflationary pressure.\n\nDue to the newness of the burn mechanism and recent trends in active addresses, it's more than likely that Ethereum's price has yet to realize the full potential of this combination. As such, Ethereum seems to be in a position that could benefit users for years to come.\n\nWhen considering Ethereum was able to hit an all-time high of almost $4,900 without any burn mechanism and while still operating on the former proof-of-work methodology, it's difficult to imagine what could be in store for its price as it begins to reap the rewards of its new deflationary features.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "The Ethereum Foundation just sold $30M in Ether \u2014 But will ETH price fall this time? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "On May 6, Ethereum Foundation transferred nearly $30 million in Ether (ETH) to the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange, causing jitters in the market about a potential selloff event.\n\nETH price fell 4.8% to $1,900 on the day, but the decline has been negligible so far amid a wider recovery trend.\n\nETH price holding key support\n\nEther\u2019s price recovered modestly to $1,920 on May 7 after testing its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave) near $1,850 as support a day ago.\n\nMoreover, the price volatility dropped on Kraken in the said period, per the contracting Bollinger Bands width in the chart above. That further shows traders\u2019 calm amid the Ethereum Foundation transfer.\n\nNotably, the 50-day EMA has capped Ether's downside attempts so far in 2023, barring the early March selloff that saw the price briefly falling below the red wave. Meanwhile, testing it as support has prompted the ETH price to pursue a breakout above $2,000.\n\nAs a result of this support, ETH bulls may attempt to take the price above $2,000 again.\n\nConversely, a drop below the 50-day EMA could have traders eye a support confluence comprising a multi-month ascending trendline and the 200-day EMA (the blue wave) near $1,700 as the next downside target, down about 13% from current price levels.\n\nEven with a larger decline, ETH would be maintaining its overall recovery trend when measured from its June 2022 bottom of $880.\n\nEthereum exchange reserves vs. Kraken reserves\n\nA rising exchange balance suggests potential selling pressure rising and vice versa. In Ethereum\u2019s case, the balance remained lower across all the exchanges despite the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s transferring $30 million into Kraken.\n\nFor instance, Kraken's Ether balance increased to 1.84 million ETH on May 6, from 1.83 million one day earlier.\n\nEther Kraken balance vs. exchange balance. Source: Glassnode\n\nNevertheless, the balance across all exchanges actually dropped to 18.15 million ETH from 18.22 million ETH on the day, indicating that any potential sell-pressure from the Ethereum Foundation can easily be absorbed.\n\nNot necessarily a ETH market top\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation\u2019s last big transfer was 20,000 ETH in November 2021, when the price topped around $4,850, declining 80% thereafter. Similarly, the foundation sold 35,053 ETH at the local market top of around $3,500 in May 2021.\n\nRelated: Ethereum up 20% in April while Markets Pro sees 379% gain in one day\n\nMany analysts treated these fractals as a sign of another possible market top formation near $2,000, arguing that the price may fall in the coming sessions.\n\nEthereum Foundation sold another 20,000 Ethereum at the recent local top.\n\n\n\nEvery time the eth foundation / Vitalik / Consensys dumps a massive presale bag it marks the top.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between ripple dumping hundreds of millions on retail vs ETH founders doing it? https://t.co/pw8ukMiR8v \u2014 Brad Mills \u26a1\ufe0f (@bradmillscan) January 28, 2022\n\nBut broader data suggests otherwise. For instance, Ethereum Foundation\u2019s large ETH sales occurred also during the 2020-2021 bull cycle, boosted by growing demand for risk-on assets in a lower interest rate macro environment.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation's large ETH transfers to exchanges since 2018. Source: Wu Blockchain\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s little evidence to suggest that the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s sales have any impact on Ethereum\u2019s price trend. Instead, the cryptocurrency market is currently taking cues from the U.S. banking crisis and whether this will force the Federal Reserve to stop hiking and cut interest rates.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin And Ethereum Foundation Selling ETH \u2013 Will Prices Fall? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum supporters are confident that prices will break the $2,000 level. However, recent moves by its founder, Vitalik Buterin, and the Ethereum Foundation, the team managing the smart contracting platform, raises concerns, especially from coin holders and traders, on whether the coin has what it needs to break above key resistance levels.\n\nETH Transfer Raises Concerns Among Investors\n\nOn May 5, a tracker, LookOnChain, noticed that Vitalik.eth, the domain associated with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, transferred 200 ETH, which is worth about $400,000 at current valuation, to Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nShortly after that, the Ethereum Foundation also made a much larger transfer, moving 15,000 ETH, worth about $30 million, to the same platform.\n\nThis has raised concerns among holders, who are worried that the dumping of such a large amount of ETH could further pressure prices.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that ETH is currently down 13% from its April highs, and sliding.\n\nCoin holders, including those of ETH, typically send tokens from time to time. Even so, any transfer to a centralized exchange is interpreted as bearish. Vitalik Buterin might need funds to cover operating costs or even invest in projects. At this time, it is not known why he sells.\n\nIn the past, Buterin has sold ETH in batches without causing a significant price drop.\n\nDespite this development, some analysts, including Santiment, believe that ETH may be decoupling from Bitcoin, and that it might soon recover, breaking above $2,000.\n\nAccording to data from Santiment, a leading on-chain data company, there has been a significant increase in the amount of Ethereum being moved to crypto exchanges over the past few months.\n\n\ud83d\ude2e #Ethereum's active deposits just hit an 8-month high. As we research the most likely cause, we can currently state that this likely will foreshadow upcoming increased $ETH volatility, similar to the result of spikes during the #merge & #FTX collapse. https://t.co/aBeHQudM52 pic.twitter.com/oHeypfUPvJ \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 5, 2023\n\nEthereum Sees Increased Adoption\n\nDespite these concerns, there are also positive signs, based on on-chain activity.\n\nA record amount of ETH was burned at the end of this week, thanks to the meme coin craze, and specifically, PEPE. The majority of meme coins run on Ethereum and are being actively moved with higher gas fees, providing a great opportunity to burn ETH and decrease the circulating supply.\n\n31.7K $ETH has been burned in the past seven days. To put that in perspective, since the merge (231 days ago), 152K ETH total has been burned. That\u2019s ~21% of the total burn in ~3% of the total days. This is the power of meme coins. pic.twitter.com/iFsZaDH5LU \u2014 K A L E O (@CryptoKaleo) May 5, 2023\n\nIn addition, Ethereum is seeing increased adoption from major companies and institutions, which is driving up demand for the cryptocurrency.\n\nLast week, the European Investment Bank (EIB) announced that it had issued its first-ever digital bond on the Ethereum blockchain, marking a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe increased adoption and burning of ETH due to the meme coin mania could sustain prices above key support levels in the days ahead. Still, it remains to be seen how prices will react in the days ahead.\n\nThe sharp drop on May 6, reversing gains of May 5, could anchor the next leg down, forcing even more liquidations towards the $1,500 support line.\n\n-Featured Image From Canva, Chart From TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) blockchain network is giving traders enormous concerns at this time as the incidence of skyrocketing gas fees appears to be returning. According to a shared insight from crypto analytics service provider WhaleAlert, one trader paid as much as 64 ETH worth approximately $118,600 at the time of writing in fees for a single transaction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 A fee of 64 #ETH (119,121 USD) has just been paid for a single transaction!https://t.co/3w4UD0AZbw \u2014 Whale Alert (@whale_alert) May 8, 2023\n\nThe high gas fee is not a new thing on the Ethereum network; however, it is notably rare since the transition from the proof-of-work (PoW) protocol to proof-of-stake (PoS) through The Merge. While not an immediate dividend, the high gas fee was one of the major considerations for transitioning the protocol to PoS. The rationale is that a different transaction validation method can help in decongesting the network effectively.\n\nWith the high gas fees being recorded at the moment, the opposite appears to be the case. The cause may be linked to the massive meme coin hype that stirred intense network activity, causing a clog during the weekend.\n\nThis network activity reached a peak when Binance exchange listed PEPE tokens as well as Floki Inu for trading on its platform. This congestion, fueled in part by panic selling by whales and the accompanying soaring prices may reduce the gains accrued by these meme coins, especially for retail traders.\n\nPlace of Layer 2 solutions\n\nThe skyrocketing price of gas fees on Ethereum contributed to the birthing of innovative Layer 2 protocols like Polygon zkEVM, Arbitrum and Optimism. While the transaction fees on these protocols are a fraction of what it costs on the main Ethereum chain, users still bypass these L2s to carry out transactions on Ethereum.\n\nThe rationale for this remains unclear, but with innovative or community-focused protocols building on Ethereum mainnet, it generally becomes quite difficult for L2s to serve the purpose for which they are designed, lowering gas fees and championing scalability."

        "content": "Summary:\n\nThe Aave DAO completely voted in support of a proposal to launch the third iteration of its lending service on Metis, an L2 scaling network built atop Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nLaunching on Metis will allow users of the popular DeFi lender to access lower transaction fees and enjoy liquidity incentives offered by Metis.\n\nThe move could bootstrap activity on Metis and drive adoption on the L2 amid growing competition in Ethereum\u2019s scaling protocol landscape.\n\nEthereum L2 scaling network Metis will welcome DeFi lending protocol Aave to its ecosystem after a community voted in support of the move. Indeed, members of the Aave DAO community backed deploying the lenders\u2019 third iteration or version 3 service on Metis.\n\nThe proposal opened for voting on May 2 and concluded last Friday. Not a single voter or community member opposed the move, signaling total support for deploying V3 on Metis.\n\nAave\u2019s launch on the Ethereum L2 network beckons fresh rewards for Metis users who borrow and lend digital assets via the decentralized finance service. The move could also galvanize activity on Metis as the protocol competes with other scaling networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon.\n\nWhile the last bull run propelled Metis to the limelight, the network\u2019s adoption has suffered blows amid market downturns and increased market competition. Metis boasts cheaper gas fees compared to Ethereum, giving users a more cost-effective alternative without giving up transaction security. Providing cheaper transaction costs is usually a common offering from L2 networks.\n\nIn a bid to encourage adoption and leverage Aave\u2019s V3 launch, Metis will offer liquidity incentives to users. Liquidity miners will receive 100,000 METIS coins within a 6-month timeline after deployment. Also, 4,000 METIS tokens will be distributed to token miners as part of a reward program.\n\nAave Fuels Expansion Campaign\n\nThe DeFi lender seems on a mission to expand beyond Ethereum\u2019s base layer with a dearth of governance proposals. In April, the governance DAO voted to launch V3 on BNB Chain, a major liquidity hub for decentralized finance users. The move was announced shortly after leading decentralized exchange Uniswap moved to launch on the Binance blockchain.\n\nAave DAO also voted to remove BUSD from lending markets on Ethereum. The proposal argued that regulatory actions against stablecoin issuer Paxos and the token\u2019s declining supply greatly diminishes BUSD\u2019s utility."

A satoshi is the smallest unit of a bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIn recent days, there has been a spike in the number of minted inscriptions from the Ordinals platform. The deluge has overwhelmed the network, forcing transaction fees high, even causing congestion on May 7.\n\nEven so, ethereum remains a significant player and is a go-to smart contracting platform.\n\nAs the Bitcoin network is inundated by Ordinals inscriptions, the popularity of meme tokens, including pepe coin (PEPE), has also forced ethereum\u2019s gas fees higher after a lull of 2022.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

That said, owning undervalued cryptos with impressive upside is the way to go, for investors with a higher risk appetite. Among the undervalued cryptos I think are worth holding are the following three tokens. These are each projects that have outperformed this year, and have plenty of upside potential over the long-term.\n\nOf course, while these may be undervalued cryptos relative to their previous valuations, they\u2019re also risky. Thus, they\u2019re not for everyone. That said, for those with the stomach for volatility, these are three cryptos I think could continue to outperform over the very long-term.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nArbitrum (ARB-USD)\n\nImage of two glowing blue chains shaking hands. representing sto platforms\n\nSource: LuckyStep/ShutterStock.com\n\nArbitrum (ARB-USD) is a new and popular addition to the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem that aims to transform how transactions are conducted on the network. Using optimistic rollups, a unique method, Arbitrum\u2019s Layer-2 scaling solution promises to enhance the speed, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of Ethereum transactions.\n\nAltLayer has been chosen as the first rollups-as-a-service provider to assist Arbitrum Orbit as the Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution now moves into the Layer 3 space. Arbitrum has gained investors\u2019 attention due to its ability to enhance the efficiency and speed of transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nArbitrum stands out for being a fast and cost-efficient solution that sends all transaction data to the main Ethereum blockchain. With a speed of 40,000 transactions per second, Arbitrum outpaces Ethereum\u2019s 14 TPS. Additionally, while Ethereum\u2019s transactions can cost several dollars, Arbitrum\u2019s transactions cost only about two cents. Arbitrum is shaking up the competition in the Ethereum L2 space, outpacing other competitors.\n\nStory continues\n\nSolana (SOL-USD)\n\nSolana logo on phone screen stock image. SOL-USD, Solana price predictions\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolana (SOL-USD) has emerged as a standout performer of the year, surging 33.58% in the first week after facing a decline of almost 94% in 2022. While this remarkable rebound is impressive, it remains to be seen if Solana can maintain its upward momentum throughout the remainder of 2023.\n\nSolana is currently undervalued in the crypto market and offers multiple use cases as a platform for decentralized finance, NFTs, gaming, and the metaverse. Despite its significant drop in value in 2022, Solana\u2019s potential as a Layer 1 blockchain network makes it difficult to believe that investors consider it worthless.\n\nIn other SOL news, Solana Labs announced that Saga, a crypto-focused smartphone, will be available for public purchase on May 8. The smartphone was created with the understanding that smartphone gadgets will have a significant part in the development of the crypto sector and function as specifically designed wallets for digital currencies. The idea was first teased almost 10 months ago, and Solana hopes that Saga will have a positive impact on its entire ecosystem.\n\nIn my opinion, Solana has a positive outlook, especially with its innovative crypto phone. I have been optimistic about Solana since its initial announcement. While it is logical that mobile devices optimized for crypto will be the future of the industry, the question remains whether the broader public shares the same view.\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD)\n\nConcept graphic of Ethereum Classic (ETC) crypto logo in green techno style\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/BT Side\n\nThe second-largest digital currency, Ethereum (ETH-USD), remains alive for a while and is now facing major shifts. Its price trend is also unstable. However, is it a good time to buy or sell this digital asset?\n\nThe popularity of meme tokens based on Ethereum has led to fluctuations in transaction fees. These price shifts are beneficial for developers and users since the average fees have been decreasing over the last two years. Ethereum\u2019s recent technological upgrades have positioned it well for future success. The switch from PoW to PoS has made it more energy-efficient and scalable. Additionally, upcoming developments such as cheaper transactions, increased security, and improved user experience make for an exciting roadmap ahead.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum appears to be a promising investment choice at present. Its growth potential is gaining attention, and its technological advancements are laying the foundation for long-term success. While investing in the volatile cryptocurrency market is never a certainty, Ethereum\u2019s overall strength makes it a strong contender for generating wealth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald had a position in SOL and ETH.

        "content": "Decentralized liquidity protocol Aave has deployed on Ethereum layer-2 scaling platform Metis, bringing a host of decentralized finance (DeFi) features and products to its ecosystem.\n\nAave\u2019s (AAVE) community recently voted in favor of a proposal deploying on zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) platform zkSync Era, paving the way for the DeFi protocol to tap into powerful performance improvements delivered by the scaling infrastructure.\n\nA number of different zk-proof-powered layer-2 protocols are being developed by Ethereum ecosystem participants, providing developers with a choice of infrastructure to scale their respective platforms.\n\nWhile Aave has yet to deploy on zkSync Era, it has announced its deployment of v3 of its protocol on Optimistic Rollup scaling protocol Metis. The latest version of Aave\u2019s protocol is touted to benefit users across both protocols, with Metis users set to benefit from the provision of DeFi borrowing and lending services.\n\nEthereum.org highlights the main difference between Optimistic Rollups and zk-Rollups. The former processes transactions off-chain before publishing data on-chain, with a timeframe for network participants to challenge the validity of transaction data.\n\nZk-Rollups, meanwhile, execute transactions off-chain and submit large batches on-chain using a single proof-of-validity, with no need for the network to validate the data.\n\nThe team from Metis highlighted a number of ways in which users of its ecosystem can benefit from Aave\u2019s deployment. This includes borrowing assets with less collateral with Aave\u2019s \u201chigh efficiency\u201d mode, improved risk management with supply and borrowing caps, and siloed borrowing to reduce exposure to potential market contagion.\n\nAave\u2019s \u201cisolation\u201d mode also increases the pool of collateral assets, its cross-chain portals provide access to wider DeFi solutions, and its gas optimization also reduces transaction fees.\n\nPodcast: Layer-2 project exec zooms in on the capabilities of Ethereum scaling solutions\n\nAave is renowned in the DeFi space, with over $5.5 billion in total value locked in the protocol. V3 of the DeFi liquidity protocol was deployed on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet in January 2023 following its launch on a number of Ethereum layer-2 protocols, including Avalanche (AVAX), Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP) and Polygon (MATIC).\n\n1inch Network, another prominent DeFi player, also opted for zkSync to deploy its aggregation and limit-order protocols, while Uniswap (UNI) tokenholders voted in favor of deploying on Polygon\u2019s zkEVM roll-up solution in April 2023.\n\nMagazine: ZK-rollups are \u2018the endgame\u2019 for scaling blockchains: Polygon Miden founder"

You get a box, they give you one gigabit for free and it costs less than a dollar per terabyte of egress right now, so bandwidth is ridiculously cheap right now.\u201d\n\nAccording to Yakovenko, even though Solana already has the ability to manage many users, it still lacks the applications to attract larger amounts of people.\n\n\u201cEvery two years there\u2019s a new generation, so from my perspective, I think we can already handle hundreds of millions of users and we have an abundance of capacity. We don\u2019t have the applications to actually attract those users yet.\u201d\n\nYakovenko goes on to name a few possible growth drivers that could bring more people to the Solana network, including Helium (HNT), a network of IoT devices that successfully migrated over to the Solana blockchain earlier this year, and Hivemapper, a decentralized map building tool.\n\n\u201cHelium created close to a million IoT (Internet of Things) hot spots, that\u2019s really cool. Think about virtual tokens moving around between people with cryptography impacting the physical world, there\u2019s literally a close to a million antennas generated from that, and they\u2019re going to attempt to do the same thing with 5G.\n\nHivemapper, on the other hand, is trying to map the entire world like Google Street View and there\u2019s 60 million kilometers in the world. They\u2019re already at [a] 2 million kilometers map, they just crossed that, they\u2019re growing.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $22.06 at time of writing, a 3.4% decrease during the last 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "I asked ChatGPT what it thinks of ETC, the answer did not disappoint - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion\n\nIf you are considering adding proof of work cryptos in your portfolio, chances are you have shortlisted Ethereum Classic (ETC). It is one of the few remaining options in the PoW category, but you may have also noticed that it has been overshadowed, particularly by its counterpart \u2013 Ethereum (ETH).\n\nEthereum Classic\u2019s performance so far this year confirms that it can still attract investor attention. However, the network has been losing popularity from a long-term perspective. Speaking of popularity, artificial intelligence has really taken off this year, with ChatGPT leading this charge.\n\nAssessing fundamental data using the ChatGPT AI\n\nPerhaps we can leverage the power of AI to find out what the future has planned for ETC. I asked ChatGPT about Ethereum Classic and the interaction was rather interesting. The initial plan was to establish the depth of the AI before going deeper into the type of information that I wanted to pursue.\n\nThe first question requested ChatGPT to provide a detailed and concise explanation of Ethereum Classic and its fundamentals. Here\u2019s the response \u2013\n\nHere is the response after switching to dark mode and requesting a shorter version \u2013\n\nThe AI seemed to have a good handle on things based on the information it provided. However, there have been incidents where it generated inaccurate information, hence the need to verify the information. Now that we had a good base, it was time to up the ante a bit. But first, those keeping a close eye on ETC may have noticed that its community has not been very active. Its development has also lagged behind that of Ethereum and other networks.\n\nOur next query focused on establishing why the Ethereum Classic network is less popular than Ethereum. It gave the following reasons \u2013\n\nCommunity Support: After the 2016 DAO hack, the Ethereum community decided to implement a hard fork that created a new blockchain network known as Ethereum, which received support from the majority of the Ethereum community. Ethereum Classic, which remained on the original blockchain, has a smaller community and fewer developers. Lack of Updates: Ethereum Classic has not received as many updates and improvements as Ethereum. This has resulted in slower transaction times and less advanced smart contract capabilities. Perception of Immutability: Ethereum Classic\u2019s commitment to immutability is a key feature for some users. It can also be seen as a liability by others who prefer the flexibility of a blockchain that can be updated if necessary. Limited Use Cases: Ethereum has a wider range of use cases and is more widely adopted by businesses and developers. Ethereum Classic has a smaller ecosystem of decentralized applications and is less widely used in commercial applications.\n\nAI-generated all the above points but they are difficult to argue against. In other words, ChatGPT\u2019s answers were spot on \u2013\n\nEthereum Classic still has some edge over the competition\n\nI was curious to find out what the AI had to say about Ethereum Classic\u2019s advantages over its more popular counterpart. It responded with the following points:\n\nImmutability: Ethereum Classic has a strong commitment to immutability. Transactions cannot be altered or deleted once recorded on the blockchain. This makes ETC a reliable and secure platform for storing and transferring digital assets and may be particularly appealing to users who prioritize security and decentralization over flexibility and upgradability. Proven Technology: Ethereum Classic is based on the original Ethereum blockchain, which has been operating since 2015. This gives it a longer track record than many other blockchain platforms, and may be appealing to users who value stability and reliability. No Hard Forks: Since the split from Ethereum in 2016, Ethereum Classic has not undergone any hard forks or major upgrades that could potentially cause network disruptions or create competing blockchain networks. This could make it a more stable and predictable platform for developers and users.\n\nSo far so good, but the above answers got me thinking about the kind of scenario where Ethereum Classic would achieve mass adoption. These were the brief points that ChatGPT shared \u2013\n\nThe aforementioned points highlighted some of the key advantages of sticking to a proof-of-work system with a heavy focus on decentralization. These characteristics would make the network and its native coin more preferable, especially in case of a harsh regulatory crackdown. Regulators, especially in the United States, have adopted an aggressive position against cryptocurrencies, but not to the extreme, yet.\n\nAttempting to circumvent ETC\u2019s price analysis brick wall\n\nWhile still thinking about Ethereum Classic\u2019s prospects, I decided to explore whether the AI can have insightful predictions regarding ETC\u2019s prospects. More specifically, I wanted to know how soon ETC can reach ETH\u2019s $1,900 press time price. Unfortunately, the language-based AI algorithm could only do so much and predictions were the limit. Here is the answer that it provided \u2013\n\nThat would have been the end of that attempt, but I recently found out about the DAN (do anything now) jailbreak prompt which unlocks some limitations. Moreover, ChatGPT\u2019s algorithm learns and it can also organize raw data into a more useful format. Thus, an idea was born.\n\nWhat if we could somehow get chatGPT to understand the history of ETC\u2019s price action, including previous price patterns? We could potentially get it to give a more concrete answer regarding price predictions. Or so I thought. Unfortunately, none of the prompts including the jailbreak offered a concrete outcome where the AI could read the price charts and identify price patterns.\n\nBack to the basics of Ethereum Classic\u2019s technical analysis\n\nAfter having a \u201cfine, I will do it myself\u201d moment, I embarked on assessing ETC\u2019s latest price action.\n\nOn 13 April, the price of ETC increased as the cryptocurrency\u2019s recent uptrend gathered momentum. The price of the coin increased to a high of $22.47, which is the highest point since March 18 of this year. From this year\u2019s low, the coin has increased by more than 53%.\n\nEthereum Classic\u2019s price has come to the same point as it was at the beginning of the year, $19.4. ETC\u2019s performance should continue to improve but fluctuate in the $30s. According to the token\u2019s price forecast, it will range between $33.24 and $37.27.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s [BTC] value increased by over 80% this year, outperforming Tesla, equities, and gold. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum Classic, are closely related.\n\nSecond, the most recent U.S. consumer inflation statistics released on Wednesday had an impact on the price of Ethereum Classic. According to the data, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for March dropped to 5.0%, the lowest level since 2021.\n\nAdditionally, core inflation declined month over month. As a result, the Federal Reserve may change course shortly. This adjustment would include raising the stalling rates and maintaining them for a while.\n\nEthereum Classic also reacted positively to the recent Shapella Upgrade, whose activation allowed Ethereum Stackers to withdraw their tokens. The amount of Ethereum staked, according to data from Staking Rewards, is over $37 billion.\n\nThe resistance retest suggested that the price may potentially register a pivot. However, ETC\u2019s money flow indicator revealed that liquidity is still flowing into the cryptocurrency.\n\nAn extended rally in the next few months may be on the cards, especially now that ETC is still heavily discounted by as much as around 85%. Long-term predictions still remain within the realm of uncertainty.\n\nIs your portfolio green?

While it does not allow for price predictions, it does offer some valuable information. Contrary to expectations, it is still not able to do everything."

        "title": "Ethereum Reaches Elliott Wave Target Set in September - EWM Interactive",
        "content": "So far, 2023 has been very generous to crypto investors, who\u2019ve been beaten and bruised throughout the entire 2022. Bitcoin, still the biggest cryptocurrency out there, is up by 73% year-to-date. The second biggest, Ethereum, has climbed 57% since the beginning of the year. And while BTC is part of our paid service Elliott Wave PRO, we published a free analysis of ETH in late-September, 2022, predicting a 50%+ rally.\n\nEthereum was trading around $1380 at the time, but its recent Elliott Wave structure suggested that it can reach \u201cinitial bullish targets near $2100.\u201d In other words, \u201ca surge of 50% or more\u201c, we wrote, \u201cis likely to follow soon.\u201d The chart on which this prediction was based on is shown below.\n\nSimilar Elliott Wave setups occur in the Forex, commodity and stock markets, as well. Our Elliott Wave Video Course can teach you how to recognize them yourself!\n\nEthereum \u2018s 4h chart revealed an impulsive recovery between $880 and $2032, labeled 1-2-3-4-5. It was followed by a three-wave correction, marked A-B-C, down to the 61.8% Fibonacci support level. Taken together, these two patterns produced a complete 5-3 Elliott Wave cycle pointing north. So, even if it turned out that the corrective phase of the cycle wasn\u2019t over yet, it made sense to stay bullish as long as $880 was intact. And of course, it did turn out that Ethereum was still in retracement mode.\n\nWhat we thought was a complete correction evolved into a five-wave impulse, marked i-ii-iii-iv-v in wave A. Wave B led to a surge to $1677 in early-November, 2022, before wave C down finally completed the negative phase of the cycle at $1072. Staying bullish throughout these wild gyrations was certainly not easy. However, with a reliable impulse pattern in place and $880 still intact, the odds remained in favor of a rally to $2100.\n\nPocketing the Ethereum Rally Required Patience\n\nLess than seven months later, on April 16th, 2023, the price of Ethereum reached and exceeded our target. It rose to $2141, up 54% since our analysis, before falling back below the $2k mark as of this writing. All it took was an eye for Elliott Wave patterns and the patience and discipline required to take advantage of them.\n\nThis is how Elliott Wave analysis, or any other type of investing for that matter, really works. You identify a pattern or a security you think is reliable and then you leave it enough wiggle room in order to be able to wait it out until it bears fruit. You don\u2019t chase illusions of precision that simply cannot be achieved. When it comes to predicting the future, being approximately right is more than enough. Trying to be more precise than possible and to buy/sell the very bottom/top is only going to lead to more stop-loss hits, therefore more losses for you and more fees for your broker.\n\nNow, the recent drop from $2141 looks like the first two waves \u2013 1/a and 2/b \u2013 of a bigger move. Whether it evolves into a simple a-b-c zigzag or a bigger selloff remains to be seen. In both cases, though, we can expect more weakness towards the support near $1600. Then, the market would have an important decision to make.\n\nIn our Elliott Wave PRO subscriptions we provide analyses of Bitcoin, Gold, Crude Oil, EURUSD, USDCAD, USDJPY and the S&P 500 every Sunday and Wednesday!

        "content": "With memecoins having captured the attention of the wider crypto industry in recent weeks, a viral video has emerged detailing just how easy it is for anyone with an internet connection to create a brand new cryptocurrency from scratch.\n\nA May 6 video from digital artist Johnny Shankman \u2014 who goes by whitelights.eth on Twitter \u2014 shows him completing a \u201cspeedrun\u201d of creating and deploying an entirely new token, humorously dubbed \u201cEASY_MONEY,\u201d in just 27 seconds. The record was then beaten just a day later, clocking in at 22.45 seconds.\n\nThe term \u201cspeed run\u201d originates from the gaming community and is typically used in reference to completing a game, or level in a game, as quickly as possible.\n\nIn the now-viral video, Shankman shows how any user can quickly create a new token by utilizing a program called Contracts Wizard, created by the crypto cybersecurity firm OpenZeppelin. The Contacts Wizard tool generates code for an ERC-20 token with a few quick clicks of a cursor. On the program, users can select a number of potential features for their token.\n\nAfter the code has been created, Shankman then uses an application called Remix, which compiles the token\u2019s smart contract and deploys it on a given blockchain network. In the video, Shankman opts for deploying his EASY_MONEY (EZ) token on the Ethereum testnet.\n\nHe notes in the comments section that the video was \u201cfor educational purposes only\u201d and clarifies that by deploying EASY_MONEY on the Ethereum testnet, it is not a real token to be speculated on.\n\nNotably, Shankman\u2019s video was picked up by a number of large accounts on Crypto Twitter, being reposted by the likes of Loopifyyy, which has now seen the video gain more than 3 million views across a series of different accounts.\n\nThe viral popularity of Shankman\u2019s post comes at a time where \u201cshitcoins'' have gained drastically in popularity throughout the broader crypto ecosystem. The recent memecoin boom has been led in large part by an \u201centirely useless\u201d frog-themed token called Pepe, which has seen its value surge more than 5,000% since its inception on April 14.\n\nIn a follow-up comment, Shankman pointed out that someone had actually created a token with the same name as his explainer but divulged that he \u201cdid not make it\u201d and he would \u201cnot be buying it.\u201d\n\nLess than 24 hours later, a new video emerged from another account on Twitter, that showed the same process being completed in just 22.45 seconds, setting a new unofficial record for the memecoin speedrun.\n\nMagazine: Joe Lubin \u2014 The truth about ETH founders split and \u2018Crypto Google\u2019"

        "title": "Ethereum [ETH] memes unwind: Does Bitcoin\u2019s BRC-20 wield the baton now - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "BRC-20\u2019s support for fungible tokens resulted in the birth of meme tokens.\n\nThe crypto community called for lightning network adoption to solve the Bitcoin network jam.\n\nThe emergence of the BRC-20 token standard may have opened up new possibilities for the Bitcoin [BTC] network. Just a few days ago, traders were confident that Bitcoin\u2019s limitation in allowing fungibility on its network would ensure that the meme token arena would not expand to it.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nBut BRC-20, which only allowed the deployment of non-fungible smart contracts on the Bitcoin network, had changed that notion. At press time, over 14,000 tokens had been created under the token economy.\n\nThe BRC-20 standard, which is still in its early stages, saw incredible growth since supporting the minting of Bitcoin Ordinals and Inscriptions. The experiment, which only began around 8 March, with its first mint phase around 4 April, has now fully added the functionality to create tokens.\n\nMemes scaling the market cap like it\u2019s nothing\n\nSince it was the period for meme tokens to flourish, most of the assets created via the network seemed like duplicates of the cryptocurrencies that have been making waves on Ethereum [ETH].\n\nBut it is noteworthy to point out that the memes created under the Ethereum network might be winding down their dominance. Recently, long positions on some of these assets suffered liquidation. So, could it be Bitcoin\u2019s turn to light up the market?\n\nAccording to BRC-20.io, some of the created tokens include Oshi, xing, ordi, and pepe \u2014 a different token from the hyped-up ERC-20-based Pepe [PEPE]. These assets have performed exceptionally, driving the overall BRC-20 market capitalization above $550 million.\n\nThe hike in market capitalization means that the token developers have ensured supply distribution, coupled with price allocation. Before, the meme mint phase, which surfaced around the last week of April, produced an All-Time High (ATH) in daily inscriptions count.\n\nOver the last week of April, nearly every day saw #Ordinal Inscription counts eclipse previous all-time high daily inscription counts. pic.twitter.com/dIFOhprPA4 \u2014 Messari (@MessariCrypto) May 7, 2023\n\nBitcoin: Backlogs and a possible headway\n\nMeanwhile, Dune Analytics showed that Bitcoin\u2019s network had gained from the progress made by the BRC-20 standard. At press time, the total fees generated by the network had increased to 382.47 BTC. This was a result of the rise in transactions, made possible by the memes, which were as much as 320,673.\n\nLike Ethereum, Bitcoin transactions have experienced a surge in transaction fees lately. But it did not end there. The network has had to deal with a backlog of transactions that have yet to pass confirmation at press time.\n\nThis traffic could, again, be linked to the surge in the thousands of BRC-20 transactions. As it was reported before, Glassnodes\u2019 data showed that the resolve to pass through Taproot had also contributed a part.\n\nTaproot collates batches of transactions and signatures together to make transactions faster on the Bitcoin network. When this happens, it means block sizes would increase, and transaction costs would follow.\n\nAccording to mempool.space, there were over 450,000 unconfirmed transactions. And it would require about 192 blocks to clear the clogging. But with an average block time of 10.5 minutes, it could take more than a day to achieve.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nFollowing the event, many clamored for exchanges and self-custody providers to adopt the Bitcoin lightning network. Although considered highly priced, the feature solves the congestion issues faced by the network.\n\nFor instance, Paolo Ardoino, Chief Technology Officer at Tether [USDT], and Bitfinex encouraged other platforms to take the same step."

        "title": "What you need to know about Dencun \u2013 Ethereum\u2019s next planned upgrade - CNBCTV18",
        "content": "After the successful implementation of 'Shapella,' the Ethereum network is set to undergo another transformation with the upcoming 'Dencun' upgrade.\n\nAccording to Ethereum Foundation community manager Tim Beiko\u2019s May 3 blog post, Ethereum\u2019s core developers are already in \"the final stages of planning\" for Dencun. While earlier upgrades sought to reduce energy consumption, increase scalability, and improve transaction speed, the major goal of the Dencun update is to lower transaction costs connected with the Ethereum network.\n\nWhat is the Dencun upgrade?\n\nThe Dencun upgrade gets its name from a combination of two elements: \"Deneb,\" the first-magnitude star in the constellation Cygnus, and \"Cancun,\" a city in Mexico. This naming convention follows a similar pattern to the Shapella upgrade, which combined the Chinese city Shanghai with \u201cCapella,\u201d the brightest star in the constellation Auriga.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade refers to the deployment of several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), specifically EIP-4844, EIP-6780, EIP-1153, and EIP-6475. A quick reminder here is that these EIPs undergo a thorough review process within the Ethereum community and, if approved, are incorporated into the network's code. The four EIPs mentioned under the Dencun upgrade focus on enhancing Ethereum's execution layer, which is the blockchain that specialises in processing transactions for decentralised applications (dApps).\n\nAlso Read: What will happen to cryptocurrencies if the US economy crumbles\n\nEIP-4844: Proto-Danksharding or The Surge\n\nLet us begin with understanding EIP-4844, also known as Proto-Danksharding. This EIP introduces a new data layer to the Ethereum network, which will serve as an interaction point for both the current consensus layer and the execution layer. In simple terms, proto-Danksharding is another version of sharding, a process that divides data across multiple machines to enhance processing speed and improve network scalability.\n\nWith the introduction of EIP-4844, temporary \"data blobs\" are brought into the picture. These blobs are opaque string-byte strings with a maximum size of 125 KB. Their purpose is to alleviate the network's burden caused by growing block sizes and rising transaction costs.\n\nThe upgrade could have a big impact on layer 2 rollups as well. Layer 2 solutions are expected to leverage these blobs to retrieve data more efficiently, as the smaller size of the blobs allows for quicker data retrieval. Additionally, these blobs are not permanently stored on the blockchain, which in turn could lead to a reduction in gas fees.\n\nEIP-6780: SELFDESTRUCT deactivation\n\nThe Dencun upgrade introduces another change through EIP-6780, which involves the deactivation of the SELFDESTRUCT opcode. This opcode allows for the creation and deletion of contracts within a single transaction while preserving the functionality of SELFDESTRUCT. However, it is important to note that the opcode will not delete the storage or code of the contract in all other cases.\n\nEIP-1153: Transient Storage\n\nEIP-1153 proposes a solution that allows for the discarding of certain data from transactions instead of storing it on the blockchain. This is achieved through the implementation of two new opcodes, TSTORE and TLOAD, which provide temporary storage that is cleared at the completion of each transaction. These introductions could open up new possibilities, such as single-transaction ERC-20 approvals, improving the availability of block space, implementing re-entry locks, and reducing the costs associated with on-chain data storage.\n\nEIP-6475: SSZ Optionals\n\nEIP-6475, also known as Simple Serialize (SSZ) Optionals, works in conjunction with Danksharding to introduce new types of transactions. By utilizing SSZ encoding, the transaction format becomes compatible with future SSZ objects that will be introduced to the Ethereum network. This upgrade enhances the efficiency and compatibility of transactions, paving the way for future developments and improvements within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nConclusion\n\nDencun is still in development, and there is no set schedule for when the improvements will be deployed. Furthermore, the extent to which it could affect the Ethereum network and its users is still unknown. However, if Dencun is carried out effectively, it has the potential to be an important milestone for the Ethereum ecosystem. Users may enjoy a more cost-effective experience if transaction costs are reduced. The same might make Ethereum more accessible and appealing, reinforcing its market position."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) volatility has shrunk further this week, and it is on track to form an inside-bar pattern on the weekly chart. Although the bulls are finding it difficult to clear the overhead hurdle in the $30,000 to $31,000 zone, a positive sign is that they have not ceded ground to the bears.\n\nIt is not only cryptocurrencies; even the S&P 500 Index has been oscillating inside a range for the past few days. This indicates that markets are awaiting a trigger to start the next directional move.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nWhile the short-term price action is uncertain, analysts are getting bullish for the long term. Trader Titan of Crypto highlighted a potential signal on the Bollinger Bands monthly chart, which projects a rally to $63,500 in about a year.\n\nWhile most major cryptocurrencies gave up some ground over the past week, there are still some pockets of strength. Let\u2019s analyze the charts of five cryptocurrencies that may turn up in the short term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin turned down sharply from the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle pattern on May 6, indicating that the bears are not willing to let the bulls through. A minor positive is that the bulls have been buying the dips to the support line of the triangle, as seen from the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe flattish 20-day exponential moving average ($28,819) and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint do not signal a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.\n\nIf the price breaks below the triangle, it will suggest that bears are trying to seize control. The BTC/USDT pair may first fall to $26,942 and then to $25,250.\n\nOn the other hand, a break and close above the triangle will suggest that the bulls have absorbed the supply. That may start a rally to $32,400 where the bears are again expected to mount a strong defense.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBuyers nudged the price above the triangle but the long wick on the candlestick shows that the breakout turned out to be a bull trap in the near term. BTC price turned down sharply and plunged to the support line of the triangle.\n\nThe bounce off this level has reached the moving averages, which is a key short-term level to watch out for. If Bitcoin\u2019s price turns down from the current level, that would raise the chances of a break below the support line.\n\nContrarily, if buyers kick the price above the moving averages, the pair may rise to the resistance line. The bulls will have to drive and sustain the price above this level to start an up-move.\n\nEther price analysis\n\nEther (ETH) faced a strong rejection above the psychological resistance at $2,000 on May 7. This indicates that the bears have not given up and they continue to protect the overhead resistance levels.\n\nETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($1,903) has flattened out and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating that the ETH/USDT pair may remain range-bound in the near term. The boundaries of the range could be between $2,000 and $1,785.\n\nA consolidation just below the local high is a positive sign. It shows that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits, increasing the possibility of a break above $2,200.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price plunges below $1,785, it will suggest that bears have seized control. That could start a fall to $1,619.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears could not build upon the break below the 50-simple moving average. This shows that the selling pressure reduces at lower levels. The bulls are trying to stage a recovery by sustaining the price above the 20-EMA. If they can pull it off, the pair will again try to retest the crucial resistance at $2,000.\n\nOn the contrary, if ETH price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 50-SMA, it will suggest that the bears are in command. That could sink the pair to the support line.\n\nMonero price analysis\n\nMonero (XMR) is trying to stay above the moving averages, indicating that the bulls are attempting a comeback.\n\nXMR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe flattish 20-day EMA ($156) and the RSI just above the midpoint indicate a balance between supply and demand. If buyers thrust XMR price above the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern, the advantage will tilt in their favor.\n\nThe XMR/USDT pair may then start a new up-move. There is a minor resistance at $181 but if that is crossed, the pair may reach $187.\n\nInstead, if the price turns down from the current level or the neckline, it will suggest that the bears remain active at higher levels. The sellers will then try to yank the price below the $149-support, opening the door for a decline to $130.\n\nXMR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the price rebounded off the 50-SMA, but the bulls could not pierce the resistance line. This shows that the bears are selling on rallies. If the price snaps back from the 20-EMA, it will suggest that the sentiment is turning positive and traders are buying on dips.\n\nThe bulls will then make another attempt to clear the overhead hurdle. If they manage to do that, the pair could first rise to $162 and then to $164.\n\nAlternatively, if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-SMA, it will suggest that bears are in control. That will increase the likelihood of a retest of the support line.\n\nRelated: The Ethereum Foundation just sold $30M in Ether \u2014 But will ETH price fall this time?\n\nOKB price analysis\n\nOKB (OKB) is trading inside a large symmetrical triangle pattern. Generally, in this setup, traders buy near the support line and sell near the resistance.\n\nOKB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears are trying to maintain OKB price below the 50-day SMA ($45.57) while the bulls are attempting to reclaim the level. If the price turns up from the current level or rebounds off the support line, it will suggest demand at lower levels.\n\nIf buyers shove the price above the 20-day EMA ($46.87), it will suggest that the OKB/USDT pair may prolong its stay inside the triangle for some more time.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if bears sink the price below the triangle, it will suggest that the setup has behaved as a reversal pattern. That could start a new downtrend that is likely to pull the pair to $37.\n\nOKB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bulls are trying to defend the horizontal support near $44.35, but they have not been able to propel the price above the moving averages. This suggests that every minor relief rally is being sold into. If the price turns down from the current level and plummets below $44.35, the pair may slump to $41.70.\n\nConversely, if the price rises above the moving averages, it will signal accumulation at lower levels. The pair could first rise to $49.50 and thereafter attempt a rally to $53.\n\nRocket Pool price analysis\n\nRocket Pool (RPL) is looking strong as it is trading above the moving averages. This shows that the bulls are buying on dips.\n\nRPL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls will have to propel the price above the overhead resistance at $53.45 to signal that the corrective phase may be over. The RPL/USDT pair may thereafter attempt a rally to $58.\n\nAnother possibility is that RPL price rises from the 20-day EMA ($48.36) but turns down from $53.45. That will indicate a possible range-bound action between the 50-day SMA ($46.13) and $53.45 for some time.\n\nA break and close below the 50-day SMA will be the first indication that the bears are in command. That will open the doors for a potential decline to $37.\n\nRPL/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears are trying to sustain the price below the 20-EMA while the bulls are trying to push the price above it. If buyers succeed, the pair may rise to the downtrend line. This is the key short-term level to watch for. If this resistance is overcome, the pair may rally to $53.45.\n\nContrarily, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 50-SMA, the price risks dropping to the support line. The bulls are likely to defend this level fiercely.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Solana (SOL/USD) price retreated to the lowest point since April 27th as concerns about Bitcoin and Ethereum congestion continued. The coin plunged to a low of $21, which was much lower than the year-to-date high of $27.13.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum congestion\n\nCopy link to section\n\nThe biggest cryptocurrency news story on Monday was that congestion among Bitcoin and Ethereum continued. As a result, Binance announced that it had temporarily paused withdrawals of Bitcoin as the team handled the situation.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s network fees have therefore soared. On-chain data shows that the total fees in Bitcoin surged to 6.13 BTC. Including subsidies, the fees have jumped to 12.38 BTC. It is unclear why this happened. However, data further data from Binance showed that the largest Bitcoin withdrawal on record happened during the weekend.\n\nA BTC holder withdrew 162,000 BTC valued at over $4.5 billion. Meanwhile, data compiled by DeFi Llama shows that Binance had outflows valued at over $293 million in the past 24 hours.\n\nBREAKING: #Binance outflow data confirms largest withdrawal in it's history, over 162,000 $BTC has left the exchange, valued at over $4.6 Billion.

Ad \u2014 WhaleWire (@WhaleWire) May 7, 2023\n\nAll these developments are positive for Solana, a blockchain that is known for its speed and low transaction costs. While Bitcoin has over 400k transactions and Ethereum has over 200k transactions pending, Solana has zero. This could be a positive catalyst for Solana prices as demand rises.\n\nMeanwhile, the total value locked (TVL) in Solana has crawled back in the past few months. It stands at 47 million SOL, the highest point since December. It started the year at 25 million SOL. This happened as the number of active users jumped to over 200k, which was higher than the year-to-date low of about 100k.\n\nSolana price prediction\n\nCopy link to section\n\nSOL chart by TradingView\n\nThe 4H chart shows that the SOL price has lost the momentum it had a few months ago. It has already slipped by more than 20% from the highest point in March. This means it has moved into a bear market. The coin has moved below the 25-day and 50-day exponential moving averages.\n\nNotably, Solana has retested the ascending trendline that connects the lowest levels since March 15. Solana price has also formed a head and shoulders pattern. Therefore, from a technical perspective, the outlook remains a bit bearish, with the next key support to watch being at $20. A move above the right shoulder at $23 will invalidate the bearish view."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum & Big Eyes Coin Are All On Their Way To The Bull Market - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The most important thing to understand about bear markets is that they are incredibly brief compared to bull markets. That could come as an unexpected blow when you look at the investments in your account and feel the declines will never end. However, the average bear market in the stock market from 1929 to 2022 lasted about 9.7 months, as measured by a 20% or more significant drop in the S&P 500 stock index.\n\nA bear market is a 20% loss from the stock market\u2019s recent highs. When the stock market increases by 20% or more over a continuous period, it is said to be in a bull market.\n\nHowever, there were some positive changes in the first quarter of 2023. Bitcoin reached $30,000 after trading at about $16,500 in early January. Meanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s value has nearly doubled from its June 2022 close of $1,071, and Big Eyes Coin (BIG) has raised $35 million in a presale that\u2019s still ongoing.\n\nBear markets may be terrible for investors, but thankfully, the anguish is typically short-lived. It\u2019s natural to be anxious about the possibility of a bear market shortly. However, most investors should not be concerned about a bear market, and you know why? Because the bear market is finally over.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Ends Hibernation\n\nBitcoin has grown for four months, an exceptional occurrence in its history. This pattern has never before resulted in new lows, implying that the Bitcoin bear market may have ended.\n\nSince then, Bitcoin prices have doubled, with the financial crisis that has now moved to Silicon Valley-based First Republic reigniting interest in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and crypto.\n\nYet as the legacy banking system faces significant challenges, future events will reveal if this pattern holds and if the Bitcoin bear market ends.\n\nEthereum\u2019s (ETH) Fortunes Have Reversed Around\n\nETH\u2019s trading volumes have reached $7.54 billion in the past several days, indicating that traders are attempting to book low-priced gains. Given the small increases reported during this period, it is evident that purchasers are generating the vast majority of volumes.\n\nThis may appear to be a bold claim, but Ethereum (ETH) is expected to begin outperforming Bitcoin. Ethereum can generate 5x returns if it reaches $50,000 to $60,000 by the end of the year.\n\nThe first reason to be optimistic is the belief that the Ethereum merging factor is still included in the pricing. During the last bull market, Ethereum reached highs of $4,900.\n\nAn additional cause to be optimistic last year was Vitalik Buterin\u2019s statement that Ethereum production was just 55% complete following the merger. Bitcoin is said to be \u201c80% complete.\u201d The average amount of transactions per second will increase due to sharding.\n\nAccording to market experts, Ethereum might embark on one of cryptocurrency history\u2019s most incredible bull runs. Over the last few days, the price of ether has been consolidating.\n\nBig Eyes Coin: The Only Cat Capable of Beating the Bear\n\n\u200b\u200bThe presale of Big Eyes Coin is another success of the crypto industry. This innovative concept will use fintech advancements to provide a quick and safe transaction platform. As an outcome, the currency will likely pique the curiosity of cryptocurrency investors looking for the next big thing in the industry.\n\nBig Eyes Coin confirmed that the presale would end on June 3rd, offering investors one final chance to acquire this digital asset. That means you still have time to join the presale using the unique promo END300, which will provide you with a 300% bonus from Big Eyes Coin.\n\nBig Eyes Coin, the largest meme currency presale, has already broken records by gathering over $35 million in investment. This achievement demonstrates how popular meme-inspired currencies are growing and suggests that similar projects may attract significant support from the crypto community. The project might contribute to market growth.\n\nThe future of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies remains to be determined owing to the challenges confronting the legacy banking system and the disparities in regulatory approaches adopted by various countries.\n\nAs the global field of finance advances, governments, banks, and investors must constantly track these developments and adjust accordingly to guarantee the cryptocurrency sector\u2019s secure and profitable future.\n\nFor more on Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nOpenSea: https://opensea.io/collection/big-eyes-lootbox-cards\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BigEyesCoin\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The decentralized finance (DeFi) space has been in correction mode, its current TVL of $50 billion representing less than a third of its peak in late 2021. The good news is that the market is preparing for another wave of DeFi adoption, primarily thanks to liquid staking tokens (LSTs), which have become the second-largest DeFi sector after decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\nLSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens \u201cliquid staking derivatives\u201d (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.\n\nHow will ETH\u2019s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?\n\nFollowing the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.\n\nShanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.\n\nWith the Shanghai upgrade already live since mid-April, we can see a gold rush of LST adoption, with the DeFi community embracing LSTs for their ability to be the \u201cinternet bond\u201d and provide a native form of yield. This can lead to DeFi protocols racing to get ahead by integrating LSTs. The sooner that DeFi protocols integrate LSTs, the greater the chance to secure a better place in the upcoming DeFi race, as the Shanghai update is expected to boost demand for staking services that also provide yield opportunities.\n\nThis liquid staking protocol addresses main obstacles in LST space\n\nEven before the impact of the Shapella upgrade becomes evident, liquid staking protocols are popular due to their unique functionality. Nevertheless, many of them deal with a range of pain points that impact user satisfaction. One of the challenges is the complexity of token models, which can create confusion for users who may struggle to understand the mechanics and implications of their investments. This complexity can stem from the varying tokenomics, reward structures, and risk profiles of different protocols, making it difficult for users to navigate the ecosystem and make informed decisions.\n\nAnother major issue is poor user experience, which can be attributed to the lack of user-friendly interfaces, inadequate documentation, and insufficient support services.\n\nHigh fees are also a concern in some liquid staking protocols, as they can significantly eat into staking yields and reduce the overall attractiveness of liquid staking.\n\nOne of the few liquid staking protocols that is working to address these challenges is Swell, which lets users stake ETH and receive swETH to start earning rewards in DeFi. While there are many liquid staking options, Swell aims to fix all the issues and compile the best offerings into a user-friendly experience. Swell focuses on simplicity, enabling ETH stakers to seamlessly dive into the journey of DeFi through its noncustodial decentralized application (DApp).\n\nSource: Swell\n\nBesides an improved user experience, Swell is reducing fees to unlock more rewards for users. As a rule, the fee rate for staking ranges from 10% to 25%, and may go even higher. With Swell, users can expect no protocol fees for a limited period.\n\nSwell is also putting a great emphasis on security, especially as the DeFi market has been plagued by hacking attacks and scams. The protocol is audited by high-profile blockchain security services including Sigma Prime.\n\nSwell can help DeFi projects, including lending protocols, DEXs and yield farming services, attract more users and secure a continual growth of the sector\u2019s TVL. Meanwhile, individual stakers can start earning rewards without any deposit barriers.\n\nWith the DeFi race driven by liquid staking gaining traction, Swell will contribute to the next DeFi transformation by helping DeFi protocols grow their communities while offering stakers the best yield opportunities.\n\nLearn more about Swell"

        "content": "Worldcoin, a cryptocurrency project co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, announced the launch of its cryptocurrency wallet on May 8.\n\nWorldcoin wallet now, token later\n\nThe new wallet, titled \u201cWorld App,\u201d supports a beta version of Worldcoin (WLD) as well as third-party cryptocurrencies such as Wrapped Ethereum (WETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), USD Coin (USDC), and Maker\u2019s DAI stablecoin (DAI).\n\nWorldcoin itself is not currently in circulation but will be launched later this year. Users in eligible countries will be able to claim the token on a weekly or monthly basis. Users in the U.S. are not meant to hold the asset, WorldCoin said.\n\nWorld App and Worldcoin are largely powered by the Ethereum blockchain and related technologies including account abstraction, ENS usernames, and Uniswap. The beta relies on Polygon while the final version will run on Ethereum rollups.\n\nThe project also relies on Ramp and MoonPay for fiat withdrawals and deposits.\n\nWorldcoin focuses on AI, ID\n\nWorldcoin attracted controversy beginning in 2021 due to its reliance on retina-scanning ID technology, which was frequently called \u201cdystopian.\u201d\n\nThe project addressed that concern today as it noted that World App integrates its World ID product, but on an optional basis. It said that the app does not \u201crequire any personal information\u201d and said that users can delete their data instantly. It said that World ID keys are self-custodied, though users can back up those keys on cloud services.\n\nWorldcoin also hinted at its artificial intelligence (AI) plans, noting that it aims to \u201cempower individuals in the Age of AI\u201d by providing \u201cAI-funded UBI.\u201d\n\nWorldcoin is not directly related to OpenAI beyond the fact that Sam Altman has been involved in both firms.

        "title": "VeChain vs. Ethereum: Which One Is More Promising? - Tribune Online",
        "content": "As the world becomes more and more digitized, the importance of cryptocurrencies is becoming more apparent. Two of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the market today are VeChain and Ethereum. Both of these cryptocurrencies have their unique features and capabilities, and are often compared to each other. In this article, we will compare VeChain and Ethereum, and analyze which one is more promising. Like ETH and other crypto investment, you may also want to know about the Importance of Bitcoin\n\nVeChain: A Blockchain Platform for Business\n\nVeChain is a blockchain platform that was created to provide solutions for businesses. VeChain aims to help businesses streamline their operations and improve their supply chain management. VeChain uses a two-token system, VET and VTHO, which work together to facilitate transactions on the platform. VeChain is known for its advanced supply chain management capabilities and has partnerships with various global companies.\n\nEthereum: A Platform for Decentralized Applications\n\nEthereum is a blockchain platform that was created to facilitate the development of decentralized applications (dApps). Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and it is known for its smart contract capabilities. Ethereum uses its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), to facilitate transactions on the platform. Ethereum is widely used in the development of dApps and has a large developer community.\n\nComparison of VeChain and Ethereum\n\nNow, let us compare VeChain and Ethereum based on various factors:\n\nTechnology\n\nBoth VeChain and Ethereum use blockchain technology, but they have different implementations. VeChain uses a Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm, while Ethereum uses a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm. PoA is faster and more efficient than PoW, but it is also more centralized. Ethereum is also planning to move to a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, which will make it more efficient and eco-friendly.\n\nScalability\n\nScalability is a major issue for both VeChain and Ethereum. VeChain can process around 10,000 transactions per second (TPS), while Ethereum can process around 15 TPS. However, both platforms are working on solutions to improve their scalability. VeChain is planning to use a multi-party payment protocol to increase its TPS, while Ethereum is planning to implement sharding and other solutions.\n\nUse Cases\n\nVeChain is primarily focused on providing solutions for businesses, especially in the area of supply chain management. VeChain has partnerships with various global companies, including PwC, BMW, and DNV GL. Ethereum, on the other hand, is focused on facilitating the development of decentralized applications. Ethereum is used in various industries, including finance, gaming, and healthcare.\n\nTokenomics\n\nVeChain uses a two-token system, VET and VTHO. VET is used for transactions and is also staked for network security, while VTHO is used to pay for transaction fees. Ethereum uses Ether (ETH) as its native cryptocurrency, which is used to pay for transaction fees and as a store of value. Both VET and ETH have a limited supply, which makes them deflationary assets.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, VeChain and Ethereum are both promising cryptocurrencies with unique features and use cases. While VeChain is focused on providing solutions for businesses, especially in the area of supply chain management, Ethereum is focused on facilitating the development of decentralized applications. If you are interested in investing in cryptocurrencies, it is important to do your research and understand the technology and use cases of each cryptocurrency before making any investment decisions."

The Ethereum Foundation in particular has been criticised for its governance.\n\nUpdates on ETH stakes on the Beacon chain since the Shanghai update\n\nIn addition to the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s transfer of ETH to Kraken, there is another recent development in the Ethereum ecosystem that has caught the attention of the cryptocurrency community.\n\nThe total amount of ETH deposited into the Ethereum Beacon Chain since the Shanghai update has exceeded the withdrawals made during the same period.\n\nThe Ethereum Beacon Chain is a new blockchain that acts as a bridge between the Ethereum network, also known as Ethereum 1.0, and the Ethereum 2.0 network.\n\nThe Shanghai update, also known as EIP-3675, was a turning point in the development of the Beacon Chain as it allowed ETH to be transferred from the Ethereum 1.0 chain to the Beacon Chain.\n\nPrior to the upgrade, users had to go through a complex and risky migration process that involved depositing ETH in a smart contract and then withdrawing it from the Beacon Chain.\n\nThe upgrade simplified the process by allowing users to transfer their ETH directly to the Beacon Chain via a special contract.\n\nThe success of the Shanghai upgrade and the resulting increase in the amount of ETH directed to the Beacon Chain is significant for several reasons.\n\nFirst, it demonstrates that the Ethereum community is committed to the long-term vision of Ethereum 2.0 and the benefits it promises, such as faster and cheaper transactions, increased dApp and smart contract functionality, and a more sustainable and inclusive ecosystem.\n\nSecond, it shows that users have confidence in the security and reliability of the Beacon Chain and the Ethereum 2.0 roadmap, despite the risks and uncertainties of any new technology.\n\nThird, it suggests that betting on the Beacon Chain can be a profitable and rewarding activity for users, who can earn rewards and participate in governance decisions.\n\nIncreasing the amount of ETH staked on the Beacon Chain also has implications for the ETH price and the cryptocurrency market as a whole.\n\nStaking ETH on the Beacon Chain requires users to commit their ETH for a period of time, ranging from several months to several years, depending on the amount and validator status.\n\nThis reduces the supply of ETH available for trading and can put upward pressure on the price as demand for ETH from investors, traders and dApps increases.\n\nFurthermore, staked ETHs generate rewards in the form of new ETHs issued by the network, which can create a positive feedback loop for price appreciation and network adoption.\n\nHowever, the rise of staked ETH also poses some challenges and risks for the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nIn conclusion, the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s transfer of ETH to Kraken and the rise of ETH stakes on the Beacon Chain are two examples of the dynamic and complex nature of the Ethereum ecosystem and the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBoth developments reflect the interests, motivations and expectations of various stakeholders."

        "content": "Uniswap sees a record number of active users on its platform.\n\nUsers are flocking to Uniswap in search of new meme coins.\n\nUniswap Sets Record for Active Users: 15,000 ETH Burned\n\nUniswap, the decentralized finance platform, has seen a surge in activity on its Ethereum network. According to data from Dune Analytics, which provides data on blockchain and decentralized finance, Uniswap has reached a new record for the number of active users on its platform, surpassing 30 million.\n\nGrowth Rate Remains Below 2021 Record\n\nAlthough the growth rate has increased due to the recent craze for meme coins, it has not yet reached the record set in May 2021. However, the number of users continues to increase.\n\nUniswap\u2019s Airdrop Put it on the Map\n\nUniswap, the largest decentralized finance exchange, gained popularity in September 2020 with its airdrop. At the time, the platform had around 1 million users on the Ethereum network. Since then, Uniswap has expanded to several other networks, but Ethereum remains the most popular. According to Dune Analytics, the number of users on the Ethereum network continues to increase and has now surpassed 30 million.\n\n15,000 ETH Burned in One Week\n\nUniswap\u2019s impact on the Ethereum network is also evident in the number of Ether burned. Since the switch from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake with EIP 1559, Uniswap-linked contracts have burned over 15,000 ETH in the last seven days. This accounts for half of the total net Ether burned in the same period.\n\nUniswap\u2019s Growth Rate\n\nUniswap has been growing steadily in popularity, especially in the past year. However, while the growth rate has increased due to the recent craze for meme coins, it has not yet reached the record set in May 2021.\n\nUniswap\u2019s Impact on Ethereum Network\n\nUniswap\u2019s popularity is having an impact on the Ethereum network, particularly in terms of the amount of Ether being burned. Since the switch to Proof-of-Stake, Uniswap-linked contracts have burned a significant amount of Ether, highlighting the platform\u2019s importance within the broader Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nIn summary, Uniswap\u2019s popularity continues to rise, driven in part by the surge in meme coins. The platform\u2019s impact on the Ethereum network is evident in the number of Ether being burned, and its expansion to other networks has also contributed to its growth.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.
