        "title": "Avalanche DEX favorite Trader Joe is launching on Ethereum - Blockworks",
        "content": "Trader Joe, the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) on proof-of-stake blockchain Avalanche, has launched on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe pseudonymous Fish, co-founder of Trader Joe, told Blockworks that the DEX\u2019s decision to launch on Ethereum now was driven by the opportunity to capture the stablecoin markets on the network amid the upheaval around Curve.\n\nCurve, a well-known stablecoin DEX, suffered an exploit this week that saw over $70 million in various digital assets attacked due to a bug in Vyper, the coding language used by Curve.\n\nThis latest exploit has led many liquidity providers to sell their holdings of CRV, Curve\u2019s native token. At the time of writing, CRV currently has a token liquidity of $6.75 million, a significant dip from $70.42 million before the hacks.\n\n\u201cLPs (liquidity providers) are moving to other pools, so you\u2019re seeing a lot of volume go to other DEXes,\u201d Fish told Blockworks. \u201cWe want to join and put ourselves into that mix.\u201d\n\nCapturing the stablecoin market\n\nFish notes that Trader Joe\u2019s initial plan was to deploy on Ethereum in a month or two, around the beginning of Q4, after working on improving its auto pool technology.\n\n\u201cBut this opportunity came up, and we felt this is the best time to deploy,\u201d he said.\n\nAuto pools are designed to help automate the balance of liquidity for users passively.\n\n\u201cEthereum runs a little bit slower, it is gas intensive, and our AMMs also use a lot of gas,\u201d Fish explained. \u201cIf you\u2019re managing positions in a concentrated liquidity AMM, which requires you to rebalance often, and make a lot of transactions every day, then for the average Joe it\u2019s going to be very uncomfortable for him to market make.\u201d\n\nLuckily, managing positions in a stable stablecoin market is relatively simple, Fish said.\n\n\u201cThe price of USDC and USDT isn\u2019t going to vary that much,\u201d he said. \u201cSo in most cases, people can just deploy in that range and then earn fees from within that range.\u201d\n\nTrader Joe\u2019s initial launch on Ethereum will include stablecoin pools USDC/USDT and USDC/DAI.\n\nHow Trader Joe compares to Uniswap\n\nLike Uniswap v3, Trader Joe is a concentrated liquidity AMM, providing constrained liquidity within a tight range for its users.\n\nCompared to its competitor, its unique edge is that it offers dynamic fee components, Fish noted.\n\nOn Uniswap v3, liquidity providers are offered three fee tiers, ranging from 0.05%, 0.3% and 1%.\n\nBy contrast, on Trader Joe, there is a base fixed fee and a variable component which is dependent on the volatility within the past few seconds to minutes.\n\nTrader Joe is currently deployed on Avalanche, Arbitrum and BNB chains.\n\nAccording to data on DeFiLlama, Trader Joe has a $57.45 million TVL on Avalanche, making it the largest DEX on the network.\n\nOn Arbitrum, however, it sports a TVL of $31.9 million, a significantly less amount compared to Uniswap v3, which currently reports volumes of $261.7 million.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Prospective Funds Would Provide Exposure To Ether Futures\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nCrypto News\n\nAsset management firms are rushing to apply for Ethereum ETFs, with analysts inferring the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is softening its stance toward digital assets.\n\nThe SEC has now received seven applications for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offering exposure to Ether futures from six issuers in the past few days. Volatility Shares, the firm that launched the first 2x leveraged Bitcoin ETF (BITX) in June, led the charge on Friday.\n\nNot to be left behind, Bitwise, Grayscale, VanEck, Roundhill, and Proshares quickly followed suit, with Proshares also applying for a second ETF that would let holders bet against Ether prices.\n\nEric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, tweeted that he thinks the ETFs \u201chave a very good chance of getting approved\u201d following the recent launch of BITX.\n\nEther has rallied more than 50% since the beginning of the year.\n\nPotential SEC Softening\n\nThe new filings come after the SEC appeared to discourage applicants as recently as May.\n\nGrayscale filed for an Ethereum ETF on May 9, prompting BitWise, Direxion, and Roundhill to follow suit. However, Grayscale withdrew its application just one week later, with its rivals doing the same shortly after. A similar scenario played out in August 2021 when VanEck and ProShares withdrew applications for Ethereum futures ETFs just a couple of days after filing them.\n\nETFs track the performance of an underlying asset, allowing investors to access exposure to an asset without having to hold it directly. Shares in ETFs are listed on exchanges, meaning retail traders can purchase the shares.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha?

According to BlackRock, retail investors drove 15% of activity in US-listed ETFs during Q1 2023.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, applied for a spot Bitcoin ETF in June, also suggesting that the SEC\u2019s stance towards crypto may be shifting,\n\nAnalysts Unpack ETF Applications\n\nMarket observers are weighing in with speculation regarding the cause for the sudden flurry of ETF applications.\n\nJames Seyffart, an analyst at Bloomberg, suggested that the SEC could be softening its stance to avoid a potential challenge from hopeful Ethereum ETF issuers.\n\n\u201cIf any of these ETH futures ETF issuers want to\u2026 battle with SEC, SEC defenses would fail to hold up in court why BTC futures ETFs are allowed but ETH futures ETFs aren't,\u201d Seyffart tweeted. \u201cWonder if SEC is now just trying to avoid losses?\u201d\n\nJohn Deaton, managing partner at Deaton Law Firm, believes the filings reflect market sentiment that following BITX, the SEC is likely to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF, improving the chances of Ethereum ETFs alongside it.\n\nHowever, Lark Davis, a popular crypto influencer, disagrees that spot crypto ETFs could be around the corner and criticized the futures contracts underpinning the proposed ETFs.\n\n\u201cMore paper garbage s**t to allow Wall Street manipulation,\u201d Davis tweeted. \u201c Meanwhile, spot ETF approvals are nowhere in sight.\u201d"

        "title": "Everything You Need to Know about The Ethereum ETF - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "Building upon the success of Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum ETFs aim to provide investors with exposure to the second-largest cryptocurrency in a regulated and convenient manner.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the concept of Ethereum ETFs, their potential benefits, challenges. And the impact they may have on the broader crypto market.\n\nWhat is Ethereum\u2019s ETF?\n\nAn Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is an investment fund that trades on stock exchanges, much like a company\u2019s stock. So, ETFs are designed to track the performance of an underlying asset or a basket of assets. In the case of Ethereum ETFs, the fund\u2019s objective is to mirror the price movements of Ethereum (ETH). Enabling investors to gain indirect exposure to the cryptocurrency without owning it directly.\n\nWhether accurate or not, this signals that word on the street is that the #BTC Spot ETF is likely to be granted and these 6 applicants want to be first in line for the #ETH one. It doesn\u2019t mean @GaryGensler will agree to an #ETH ETF but the full court press will start. https://t.co/itfkXF69ZB \u2014 John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) August 2, 2023\n\nEthereum ETFs hold significant appeal for both institutional and retail investors. Firstly, ETFs offer a regulated and secure investment vehicle. Providing an alternative to the complexities of purchasing and storing cryptocurrencies directly. As traditional financial institutions start to enter the crypto space cautiously. ETFs may serve as a bridge, attracting more conservative investors.\n\nAlso, ETFs can be bought and sold on conventional stock exchanges during regular trading hours. Making them highly liquid and convenient investment options. Investors can easily adjust their holdings, exit positions, or diversify their portfolios. With greater ease compared to traditional cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nRegulatory Hurdles about Ethereum\u2019s ETF\n\nThe introduction of Ethereum ETFs is not without challenges, primarily concerning regulatory approval. Various regulatory bodies, such as the SEC, have scrutinized cryptocurrency ETF proposals. Their concerns mainly revolve around investor protection, market manipulation, and the volatility of the underlying asset.\n\nNEWS: Two sources tell Blockworks the SEC is now ready to consider ETH futures ETF applicationshttps://t.co/Nz60UfmgX3 \u2014 Blockworks (@Blockworks_) August 2, 2023\n\nWhile several countries, including Canada and Brazil, have successfully approved and launched Ethereum ETFs. The United States has yet to give the green light to any cryptocurrency ETFs. The regulatory landscape remains uncertain, and the approval process can be lengthy and arduous.\n\nImpact on Ethereum\u2019s Price and Adoption\n\nThe launch of Ethereum ETFs has the potential to influence the price and adoption of the cryptocurrency. As ETFs become more prevalent, they are likely to attract a significant influx of institutional funds, increasing the demand for ETH. This influx of capital could drive Ethereum\u2019s price higher. Benefiting existing investors and further raising awareness and interest in ETH.\n\nAdditionally, ETFs could serve as an on-ramp for new investors who are more comfortable with traditional financial products. This could lead to increased adoption and usage of Ethereum as more people become exposed to the asset and its underlying technology.\n\nLittle inside baseball to part of this. The ETH ETFs from yesterday would go effective on 10/15 but that\u2019s a Sunday so it\u2019ll likely actually be the 16th. This Direxion fund would also theoretically have an effective date of 10/16/23 (if approved). So no delay for being late. pic.twitter.com/geBboZ1HOU \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) August 2, 2023\n\nRisks and Considerations\n\nInvesting in Ethereum ETFs carries certain risks and considerations that investors should be aware of. While ETFs aim to track the price of Ethereum, they may not perfectly mirror the cryptocurrency\u2019s price due to tracking errors, and fees. Furthermore, ETFs are subject to market volatility, and their prices can fluctuate based on demand and supply.\n\nAdditionally, some investors may prefer owning and controlling their cryptocurrencies directly. Rather than relying on a third-party fund manager. In such cases, they may choose to invest in Ethereum through traditional cryptocurrency exchanges or custody solutions.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe introduction of Ethereum ETFs represents a significant milestone in the evolution of the crypto market. As more countries approve and launch these investment vehicles, they could provide a gateway for traditional investors to participate in the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAfter Volatility Shares kicked off the $ETH futures ETF race on July 28, five other entities have filed applications with the @SECGov. By @amitoj.https://t.co/VzFgJQQPir \u2014 CoinDesk (@CoinDesk) August 2, 2023\n\nWhile there are regulatory hurdles and risks to consider, Ethereum ETFs have the potential to drive greater adoption, liquidity, and interest in the Ethereum ecosystem. Ultimately contributing to the growth and maturation of the broader crypto market. As the industry continues to evolve, it will be crucial for investors to stay informed, conduct due diligence, and assess the impact of Ethereum ETFs on their investment strategies."

        "content": "The count of Ethereum and Bitcoin futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) applications has increased to twelve following recent filings by Bitwise, a leading provider of index and beta crypto funds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company filed for two ETFs, with equal weight and market weight versions of their dual Bitcoin and Ethereum futures ETFs.\n\nBitwise's Bitcoin and Ether Market Cap Weight Strategy ETF, the most recent product, aims to offer market capitalization-weighted exposure to Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts, without directly investing in Bitcoin or Ether. Managed by Bitwise Investment Manager and Vident Advisory, the ETF's allocation between Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts is determined by their respective market capitalization and rebalanced monthly.\n\nThe ETF invests mainly in cash-settled, front-month futures contracts, which are contracts with the shortest time to maturity, and may also include back-month, or longer maturity contracts. Both Bitcoin and Ether Futures Contracts are standardized, cash-settled futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\n\nWhen a futures contract is about to expire, the holder, in this case, the ETF, must sell the contract and purchase new ones with a later expiration date, a process known as \"rolling\". The continuous buying and selling could lead to higher portfolio turnover for the ETF.\n\nThis brings the total number of Ether futures ETF filings to a full dozen, with a strong indication that the count will continue to rise.\n\nAs reported by U.Today, ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have revised the probability of a Bitcoin ETF approval to a promising 65%. A few months prior, the odds were pegged near an almost impossible 1%.\n\nThis revised estimate has been influenced by multiple factors, notably including the perceived softening stance of Gary Gensler, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)."

He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThe biggest altcoin, Ethereum, displayed a range-bound price action between $1849 and $1887 for almost a week. However, the recent 1.79% fall in Ethereum prices forms a bearish candle breaking the bottom support to exceed the $1849 mark.\n\nCurrently, the Ethereum price trades at $1833 below the 50-day EMA, with an intraday fall of 0.28%. The bearish range breakout intensifies the dark cloud over Ethereum prices, projecting a potential drop in market value to $1800.\n\nTrading View\n\nWith a closing price of $1820, Ethereum was at its lowest closing level in 36 days. This brings the biggest altcoin closer to a long-term support trendline forming since December 2022. The ascending support trendline has helped ETH prices bounce back five times since December 2022.\n\nThe RSI indicator projects a high possibility of a bullish divergence forming at the coming retracement to the trendline. Meanwhile, the 200-day EMA follows a sideways track and stays close to $1800, ready to provide a cushion.\n\nIn case of a bullish reversal, the Ethereum prices can reclaim the 50-day EMA and challenge the $2000 resistance level before reaching the $2150 mark.\n\nHowever, a prolonged downtrend can challenge the bullish dominance of the $1800 mark."

Vann added:\n\n\u201cThis is a significant step forward for our multichain strategy, as it will enable our token to access the rich and diverse ecosystems on both chains.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the Ethereum and BNB Chain cross-chain bridges will offer users of the two networks a chance to join the emerging WMT ecosystem. BNB Chain and Ethereum are two of the most used smart contract networks, with both networks having more than 200 million unique addresses, respectively.\n\nWMT eyes liquidity\n\nIn addition to its primary objective, the initiative is set to bolster WMT liquidity. Compared to its native Cardano network, Ethereum and BNB Chain currently demonstrate higher levels of liquidity.\n\nNotably, the World Mobile sidechain AyA will see seamless integration with these two prominent networks, further enhancing its potential and accessibility.\n\nWith the creation of the new bridges, WMT now has three cross-chain bridges connecting it to other networks. The third bridge connects World Mobile to Conflux (CFX) blockchain.\n\nDespite a slight drop of 0.93% in the last 24 hours, WMT\u2019s price holds steady at $0.11489, as per the data from CryptoSlate.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Key On-Chain Metric Points to Stagnation, Will Ethereum Ever Break $2,000? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "According to Etherscan data, the number of active ERC-20 addresses has not changed much in 2023. It has stayed between 200,000 and 300,000 while Ethereum prices stagnate below July 2023 highs. As of August 2, there were about 275,000 active ERC-20 addresses, up from 156,000 on June 18. Although activity has been low overall, there was a significant increase on June 11, with over 446,000 active ERC-20 addresses.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price trajectory has been tumultuous in tandem with this activity pattern, looking at the charts. For instance, Ethereum bulls have failed to breach the $2,100 liquidation level posted in the latter stages of H1 2023.\n\nEthereum Prices Volatile, Few Coins Burned\n\nAt the moment, ETH prices hover around the $1,800 range, teetering precariously and likely to drop, looking at candlestick arrangements in the daily chart. Although Ethereum has been bullish in the past two months, bulls have been tamed, and a drop below the $1,800 level may signal a shift from bullish to bearish in the medium term.\n\nWith ETH under pressure, the number of active ERC-20 addresses remains constant and relatively lower than the 2021 peaks. This means there is less demand for ETH, which is used to pay transaction fees. As a result, gas fees are lower because there is less competition for block space. Typically, this would encourage more people to participate and even deploy complex contracts in decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nWith EIP-1559 in the equation, low activity means fewer coins are taken out of circulation. Despite low network activity, the protocol continues to issue 2 ETH after each validated block, watering down deflationary effects enforced by EIP-1559.\n\nDeFi Activities Falling\n\nFalling activity could be attributed to the waning interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities over recent months. As of August 2, the total value locked (TVL) remains below $50 billion, with a significant portion of assets tied in Ethereum. DeFi projects like LidoDAO, Curve, and Uniswap facilitate the trading of ERC-20 tokens.\n\nFurthermore, on-chain data highlights USDT as the most actively transacted token. Given its position as the third-largest coin by market cap, with substantial circulation in Ethereum and Tron networks, such a trend is expected.\n\nLooking back at ERC-20 transactions from June and July, it is evident that transfers stayed constant despite temporary price increases. Ethereum prices rose from $1,630 to $2,000 between mid-June and mid-July 2023, but ETH is now lower.\n\nOn-chain ERC-20 activity has remained stable despite price volatility. It\u2019s unclear whether there will be a change in activity as prices continue to drop. However, lower prices may force token holders to wait and see, leading to less activity.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Especially, ProShares and Bitwise are filing for various types of ETFs tracking both BTC and ETH prices, with Ethereum-related ETFs reaching 12 now.\n\nProShares And Bitwise Files 7 Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF Together\n\nProShares and Bitwise have filed three applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for ETFs focused on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nadvertisement\n\nProShares filed an application for the Bitcoin & Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF. It will track the performance of the Bitcoin & Ether Equal Weight Index. ProShares has filed in total four applications for Ethereum-focused ETFs this week.\n\nIn addition, Bitwise also filed applications for the Bitcoin and Ether Market Cap Weight Strategy ETF and the Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF. Bitwise has filed three Ethereum-based ETFs applications this week.\n\nBloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas noted that the number of Ether futures ETF filings reaching 12 now.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at 12. it\u2019s late but I missed one today. Bitwise actually filed for two ETFs. Equal weight and market weight versions of their dual Bitcoin and Ethereum futures ETFs. We\u2019re up to a full dozen Ether futures ETF filings now. Feel like we will get another tomorrow.\u201d\n\nBloomberg analysts increased the odds of the US SEC approving a spot Bitcoin ETF this year to 65% from 50% a few weeks ago. However, the odds for an Ethereum ETF approval is 75%, but Balchuna believes 95% on Ether futures.\n\nRead More: Bitcoin Price Calm Before The Storm, Selling Now to Buy Later?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum Price To Rally?\n\nBlackRock and other traditional finance firms pushing SEC to approve spot Bitcoin ETF, with Grayscale lawsuit against US SEC becoming a key factor for spot Bitcoin ETF this year.\n\nBTC price jumped 0.5% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $29,183. The 24-hour low and high are $28,959 and $29,375, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume has decreased by 17% in the last 24 hours.\n\nMeanwhile, ETH price trades at $1835, up just 0.35%.

        "title": "Developers seize on cheap Ethereum to drive 12-fold surge in new smart contracts - DLNews",
        "content": "Smart contracts deployed on Ethereum and related blockchains have surged 12-fold over the past year.\n\nThe number of new, user-friendly crypto wallets jumped over 1,200%, or 13-fold, in July.\n\nThat development could augur a boon for user experience in crypto.\n\nCompanion blockchains that have made Ethereum cheaper to use have been a boon for crypto developers, according to a new report.\n\nSmart contracts deployed on Ethereum and a trio of related blockchains grew 1,100%, or 12-fold, year-over-year in the second quarter.\n\nSmart contracts deployed Q2 2023 Ethereum layer 2 blockchains and Polygon have been driving smart contract growth over the past year. (Aleks Gilbert)\n\nThat\u2019s according to new research from Alchemy, a company that builds tools for crypto software developers.\n\nAlchemy growth analyst Blake Tandowsky attributed the boom to layer 2 blockchains built on top of Ethereum, such as Arbitrum and Optimism, having dramatically reduced the cost of using the world\u2019s largest smart contract platform.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nNOW READ: Why Ethereum is so dominant \u2014 and why it\u2019s not going anywhere\n\nIn addition, some of those smart contracts are enabling a more familiar user experience that proponents hope will lower the barrier to use blockchain technology.\n\nIn the same period, there were more than 29,000 active users of new, smart contract-based crypto wallets made possible by an Ethereum upgrade in March, of which 22,000 were active in June.\n\nIn July, there were almost 300,000 active users of those smart contract-based wallets, according to data compiled by pseudonymous data analyst Kofi, a contributor to DefiLlama and Alchemy.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nPolygon, Arbitrum and Optimism drive boom\n\nLayer 2 blockchains allow developers to deploy smart contracts \u201cat a higher rate than ever before,\u201d Tandowsky told DL News. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing on Polygon \u2026 or Optimism and Arbitrum, who are also adopting smart contract wallet concepts.\u201d\n\nThe news comes on the back of a drop in funding, regulatory clashes, and a slow decline in the number of blockchain developers having dwindled by 22% over the past year, according to a recent report from web3-focused venture fund Electric Capital.\n\nWhile there\u2019s been a drop in the number of developers, those that remain are churning out more smart contracts than ever, according to Alchemy.\n\nNOW READ: Blockchain developer ranks fall 22% amid scandals \u2014 but Sui and Aptos are bucking the trend\n\nThe boom has been made possible by Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 blockchains, which batch and compress user transactions before appending them to Ethereum, a process that allows people to use it as a decentralised settlement layer while avoiding its notoriously high transaction fees.\n\n\u2018Dream of the Ethereum developer community\u2019\n\nThat, in turn, has fuelled developers\u2019 work on a relatively new feature called account abstraction, which enables the more flexible, smart contract-based crypto wallets.\n\nAccount abstraction makes it possible to recover an account \u2014 similar to how one might regain access to a social media or email account if they\u2019ve forgotten their password \u2014 along with a host of other features.\n\nTwo years ago, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin wrote that account abstraction had \u201cfor a long time been a dream of the Ethereum developer community.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a nascent transformation within the industry\u2019 \u2014 Blake Tandowsky, growth analyst at Alchemy\n\nBefore the March update, users needed a passcode comprised of at least 12 randomly generated words \u2014 a seed phrase \u2014 in order to access their Ethereum wallets. Forgetting any of those words, means losing access to their crypto \u2014 forever.\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s a nascent transformation within the industry, we did see compounding growth\u201d in the second quarter, Tandowsky said. \u201cDevelopers have started to build products, and there are users using these products \u2014 in a small way, but in a fast growing way.\u201d\n\nAccount abstraction also allows protocols to cover users\u2019 transaction fees, known as gas, which can fluctuate dramatically and occasionally make Ethereum prohibitively expensive to use.\n\n\u201cOne of the complaints we\u2019ve seen from application users is that it\u2019s really hard and annoying to have to go all the way through the transaction flow and pay for gas whether that be on Ethereum or other chains,\u201d Tandowsky said.\n\nCovering user\u2019s transaction fees, he added, \u201chelps to lower the friction to transacting.\u201d"

        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has been recently inundated with applications for Ether (ETH) futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with a grand total of 11 Ether-based filings being submitted in less than a week.\n\nThe latest ProShares ETF application was filed on Aug. 3 and proposes an equal weight Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether ETF. According to the filing, the fund will track \u201cthe performance of holding long positions in the nearest maturing monthly bitcoin and ether futures contracts.\u201d\n\nUPDATE: Another one.... 11 ETFs Filed... Proshares filed for a 4th ETF with Ethereum futures. This one is an equal weight #Bitcoin & #Ethereum ETF just like Bitwise's filing which dropped an hour ago. https://t.co/vB05Wvt33e pic.twitter.com/u3I3LzznGZ \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) August 3, 2023\n\nAccording to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, fund manager ProShares has now lodged a total of four separate filings for Ether-based ETFs within the last few days, including a dual Bitcoin and Ether futures strategy ETF, a short Ether strategy ETF and an Ether strategy ETF.\n\nThe last seven days has seen a total of 11 Ether-related ETF filings, all of which have been for futures ETFs. The wave of Ether-based ETF applications was kicked off by Volatility Shares lodging its filing for the Volatility Shares Ether Strategy ETF on July 28.\n\nFollowing hot on Volatilty\u2019s heels came Bitwise Asset Management, Roundhill Financial, Van Eck, ProShares and Grayscale Investments, which all filed new Ether futures applications on Aug. 1.\n\nWe have 7 #Ethereum Futures ETF filings from 6 Issuers. All of them are behind Volatility Shares. Key aspect here is that they are the same firm that managed to get a 2X #Bitcoin Futures ETF ( $BITX) through this SEC. https://t.co/dVpBkmtWwv pic.twitter.com/m615PS8Ssc \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) August 2, 2023\n\nNotably, the SEC has never approved an ETF that tracks Ether futures contracts. On the other hand, Bitcoin futures ETFs have been around since October 2021.\n\nIf the SEC does not deny any of the applications, the Ether ETFs will launch 75 days from their respective filing dates, with Volatility Shares ETF being the first to launch on Oct. 12.\n\nRelated: Ether ETFs pending \u2014 Grayscale, VanEck and others file SEC applications\n\nThe key difference between futures and spot ETF products is that the former tracks the price of futures contracts while the latter actually involves the issuer purchasing the underlying asset. Spot ETFs are widely viewed as more valid as they involve the fund manager buying and holding the underlying asset.\n\nThe flurry of Ether-focused applications comes in the wake of a frenzy of filings from major asset management firms seeking to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs. The world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, is among those looking to offer what would be the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States.\n\nMagazine: Chinese police vs. Web3, blockchain centralization continues: Asia Express"

        "title": "Could Ethereum help stop museums from hoarding stolen artifacts? These researchers think so - Blockworks",
        "content": "Researchers are developing an Ethereum-based blockchain tool called Salsal to help museums and cultural institutions organize and keep track of valuable historical collections.\n\nMark Altaweel, a professor in the archeology department at the University College of London, has been working on Salsal alongside colleagues at Abu Dhabi University for roughly two years.\n\nAltaweel said putting history on the blockchain would be the first step toward \u201cdecolonizing museums\u201d and taking back the past.\n\n\u201cBlockchain\u2026allows a decentralized way in dealing with and managing heritage. So if I have expertise about something, and you have expertise about something, we can all participate in these networks,\u201d he told Blockworks in an interview.\n\nExpertise is the key thing Salsal needs to achieve wide adoption. Museums and collectors would submit their collections of historical objects to the Salsal blockchain. Experts, such as archaeologists, would then examine each artifact to determine their condition, provenance, and whether they were legally obtained.\n\nExperts on the Salsal network, which will be a partially-private version of Ethereum, will use the Museum Association\u2019s sliding scale rating standard. A rating of one means the collection and/or items were legally and ethically obtained with plenty of documentation. A rating of five means the items \u201chave clear evidence that they were obtained illegally,\u201d according to Salsal\u2019s white paper.\n\nIf a collection is shown to be ethically and legally legitimate with enough documentation to reasonably prove where the items came from, \u201cthe collector can then turn their collection into NFTs.\u201d\n\nThe NFT portion of the Salsal network will be the public aspect of the blockchain, so people will be able to see and purchase them. This has the added benefit of monetarily supporting museums and collectors.\n\n\u201cCultural institutions tend to have struggles with things like fundraising. So giving some carrots for people to be involved is what the NFTs are for,\u201d Altaweel said.\n\nObviously, concerns brewed among Altaweel and his colleagues that illegitimate collections could profit with this incentive in place, so they have removed the option for items that don\u2019t meet experts\u2019 standards to be fashioned into NFTs.\n\nAdditionally, Altaweel wants to show all the collections they receive \u2014 even the ones with a \u2018five\u2019 rating \u2014 on the blockchain for transparency\u2019s sake. It\u2019s also his strategy for holding museums with shady ethical practices accountable in terms of holding items of historical significance that were stolen from other cultures.\n\nMany have accused the British Museum in London of retaining pilfered items, some of which were taken during colonial conquests by the British Empire. Some examples of these include the Benin Bronzes from Nigeria, the Parthenon Marbles from Greece, and the Rosetta Stone from Egypt.\n\nThe governments of Nigeria and Greece have requested these priceless items back at one point or another. A group of prominent Egyptian archaeologists called for the return of the Rosetta Stone in October 2022.\n\nAltaweel wants to discourage situations like this in the future with his tool.\n\nRead more: Sandbox, British Museum shepherding history into \u2018new online era\u2019 with metaverse exhibits\n\nThe other inherent use case for Salsal is to have a running, immutable record of the collections stored in museums around the world.\n\nAltaweel brought up how the Baghdad Museum in Iraq was looted during the US invasion of the city in 2003 as part of the US\u2019 war on terror. Anticipating chaos, museum staff vacated the premises two days before the invasion, which allowed thieves to roam the halls and take whatever they wanted.\n\nIn all, 15,000 objects were stolen from the museum, according to a 2018 analysis by the University of Sydney.\n\n\u201cWhile 7,000 items have been recovered, more than 8,000 remain unaccounted for, including artifacts thousands of years old from some of the earliest sites in the Middle East,\u201d the university wrote.\n\nAltaweel likes to imagine that a tool like Salsal, with enough adoption by museums around the world, could prevent future acts of cultural vandalism.\n\nIf records of all the items in the Baghdad Museum had been in a blockchain, Altaweel argues that \u201cyou would not only know what\u2019s missing, but the community would be involved in looking for these objects.\u201d\n\nHaving a record on chain makes it so attestation of ownership and authenticity can\u2019t be destroyed or lost. On-chain storage also allows anyone with an internet connection to view records, which in this case would decentralize control away from museums and better enable the public to help identify and report stolen items, should they reappear in the future.\n\nAltaweel and his colleagues have been pitching Salsal primarily to museums in Abu Dhabi, including the Louvre located in the emirate. They\u2019re also looking to attract funding, something Altaweel said has been tough during the summer.\n\nSalsal is still in its test version, but the overall goal is to launch it on Ethereum within six months, he said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "As of Aug. 3, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has received a total of 12 Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications.\n\nThe latest additions came from Bitwise, submitting new applications for equal-weight and market-weight versions of its Bitcoin and ETH futures ETFs.\n\nThis continues the flurry of Ethereum-related ETF applications that started on July 28 when Volatility Shares filed its submission. Since then, other asset managers, including Grayscale, Proshares, etc., have submitted new applications, with some having multiple filings.\n\nJames Seyffart, a financial expert with Bloomberg Intelligence, reported that ProShares had filed four Ethereum ETF applications with the SEC. Information on the regulator\u2019s website shows that Bitwise has made three applications, while Grayscale made two.\n\nOthers like Roundhill, VanEck, and Volatility Shares have submitted one application apiece. Meanwhile, a new name in the mix is Direxion, which filed a dual Bitcoin and Ethereum futures ETF on Aug. 2.\n\nWill the SEC approve?\n\nMarket experts have previously argued that the applications are more of a gamble by the asset managers who don\u2019t want to miss out on being the first Ethereum ETF in the U.S. However, the possibility of getting approval is slim as the SEC has never approved an Ethereum futures ETF filing.\n\nAdditionally, chair Gary Gensler consistently declined to answer if the Commission considers Ethereum a security, thereby increasing the regulatory uncertainty surrounding the blockchain network.\n\nSEC still has Bitcoin ETF applications to deal with\n\nMeanwhile, the wave of Ethereum ETF applications is coming on the heels of a deluge of Spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF applications submitted by numerous traditional financial institutions, including BlackRock, the largest asset manager globally, to the SEC.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart opined that there was a 65% chance the financial regulator could approve the Bitcoin ETF applications before it. Seyffart explained that:\n\n\u201cThe lynchpin for this current thesis is a Grayscale victory over the SEC in Federal court. Which COULD set things up for a wave of SEC approvals sometime in the 4th quarter? All depends on how much Gensler wants to fight here.\u201d\n\nMentioned in this article"

According to researcher Alex Stokes from the Ethereum Foundation, October 2023 is a feasible goal date for Cancun's activation.\n\nHere's latest update per Ethereum ACDE call\n\nTim Beiko, an Ethereum developer, provided a quick summary of yesterday's biweekly ACDE call, which focused on testing efforts and preparations for the Deneb upgrade.\n\nAll Core Devs \u2013 Execution (ACDE) call recap by @TimBeiko\n\n\n\nScreenshot from Eth R&D Discord pic.twitter.com/HERlPQDBrQ \u2014 abcoathup.eth \ud83d\udc21 \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@abcoathup) August 3, 2023\n\nDevelopers have decided to use a standard contract rather than a precompile for EIP-4788. Going forward, developers will attempt to come up with a deployment scheme and accept a first contract implementation to utilize.\n\nOnce this is agreed to, an audit /formal verification process will be started. According to Beiko, the devnet 8 launch will be put on hold until implementations for the new 4788 spec are received. Devnet 7 was released in late June to raise the blob limit from two to three and the maximum blob limit from four to six.\n\nBeiko also highlighted that clarifications for EIP 6780 will be merged as well as execution APIs Engine API. At the meeting, two abstraction EIPs, 5806 and 7377, were presented and discussed."

        "content": "A quant has explained how the indicators like taker buy/sell ratio and Coinbase premium index can influence the price of Ethereum.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Relationship With Taker Buy/Sell Ratio & Coinbase Premium Index\n\nIn a new CryptoQuant quicktake post, an analyst has discussed some metrics that could hold relevance for the ETH price. The first indicator of interest here is the \u201ctaker buy/sell ratio,\u201d which tells us about the ratio between the Ethereum buy and sell orders in the market right now.\n\nWhen this metric has a value greater than 1, it means that the taker buy volume is higher than the taker sell volume. Such a trend implies that the majority of the investors are bullish on the asset currently.\n\nOn the other hand, values below the threshold naturally imply the dominance of bearish sentiment, as there are currently more sell orders present on exchanges.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 50-day moving average (MA) Ethereum taker buy/sell ratio over the past few years:\n\nThe potential relationship between these indicators and the value of the cryptocurrency | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nAs you can see in the above graph, the quant has highlighted the pattern that the Ethereum price and the 50-day MA taker buy/sell ratio have possibly followed during the past couple of years.\n\nIt would appear that whenever the value of the asset has rallied, the taker buy/sell ratio has gone down. This would suggest that the sell orders on the market pile up as the ETH price trends up.\n\nThe analyst notes that this is naturally because the investors become more cautious as the price continues to rise since they think a correction may be coming soon.\n\nThe sell orders continue until the cryptocurrency has topped out, and once the decline hits the asset, the buy orders start going up instead.\n\nFrom the chart, it\u2019s visible that significant accumulation periods have generally paved the way for the price to bottom out and begin another rally.\n\nThe quant has also attached data for another metric: the Coinbase Premium Index. This indicator keeps track of the difference in the Ethereum prices listed on Coinbase and Binance.\n\nWhenever this metric has a positive value, it means that the Coinbase platform has BTC listed at a higher price than Binance currently. This implies that buying pressure has been stronger from US-based investors, who usually use the former exchange. Similarly, negative values imply just the opposite.\n\nAccording to the analyst, major fluctuations in the Ethereum price have generally come with strong changes in the Coinbase premium index, a possible sign that activity on the exchange is the driver for these price moves.\n\nCurrently, the 50-day MA taker buy/sell ratio is at relatively low values and is looking to turn around, although this trend shift towards buy order dominance isn\u2019t confirmed just yet.\n\nThe Coinbase Premium Index is at neutral values, implying that there hasn\u2019t been any trading activity happening on the platform that\u2019s different from Binance. Given these trends, it\u2019s possible that Ethereum may not see any big moves in the near future.\n\nETH Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $1,830, up 2% in the last week.\n\nETH has erased its gains from yesterday | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from DrawKit Illustrations on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

According to the report, the number of node operators should be a \u201cpoint of concern for centralization.\u201d\n\nRelated: Liquid staking claims top spot in DeFi: Binance report\n\nThe report notes that centralization in liquid staking can have several harmful effects on the ecosystem, such as reduced competition and increased risk of censorship. According to the report:\n\n\u201cThere is a heightened possibility of censorship with centralized staking players, as they may be subject to incentives or regulatory pressure to censor transactions. This can potentially result in a disruption of the trust within the network.\u201d\n\nIn addition, as it gets further centralized, there are risks of decreased security, as big staking players can make it easier for attackers to carry out 51% attacks. Moreover, there\u2019s also an increased risk of collusion.\n\n\u201cCentralized stakers can collude to carry out actions that go against the decentralization ethos and against the users, such as malevolent MEV extraction and frontrunning,\u201d the report reads.\n\nWhile there are centralization risks, HashKey also recognizes that most protocols are very recent and have made plans to decentralize and add distributed validator technology to their protocols for better decentralization and resiliency.\n\nMagazine: SEC reviews Ripple ruling, US bill seeks control over DeFi, and more: Hodler\u2019s Digest, July 16-22"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is an ever-evolving landscape, with each asset having its own dynamics. Ethereum, the leading altcoin, is currently generating considerable attention, with analysts referring to it as a \"ticking bomb.\" This phrase, intriguing as it is, signals the potential for explosive growth in Ethereum's future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe primary focus here is on the ETH/BTC trading pair, suggesting it might be the right time for investors to shift their investments from Bitcoin to Ethereum. This notion stems from the recent market behavior in which Bitcoin has shown some short-term weakness. On the contrary, Ethereum, despite experiencing a slump below $1,900, is signaling impending bullish momentum.\n\nAt this point, Ethereum is trading between the 50 and 200 EMAs (Exponential Moving Averages), indicating that it is in a phase of consolidation. Both the volume and the RSI (Relative Strength Index), a metric used to assess overbought or oversold conditions, are descending. This could be an early sign of a potential trend reversal.\n\nThe term \"high-beta plays\" refers to investments that are more volatile than the overall market. These assets have a beta greater than one, meaning they are expected to exhibit larger price swings. The advice to avoid high-beta plays suggests that the focus should be on establishing a strong core portfolio of stable investments rather than taking high risks in pursuit of quick gains.\n\nThe general consensus among market analysts is that Ethereum might be on the brink of a \"spectacular run.\" While Bitcoin may enjoy a brief rally, Ethereum's potential for growth appears to be higher. The primary message to investors is to bide their time and focus on building a resilient, diversified portfolio capable of weathering potential storms and taking advantage of the upcoming bull market."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe odds of approval for Ethereum futures ETFs have jumped to 75%, according to a recent note by ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas. This is the same rate they attributed to Bitcoin futures ETFs in September 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of applications for Ethereum and Bitcoin futures ETFs has increased to twelve, thanks in part to recent submissions by Bitwise, a top firm in the field of index and beta cryptocurrency funds.\n\nCryptocurrency futures ETFs provide investors with exposure to cryptocurrency futures contracts rather than offering direct investment in the mercurial asset class.\n\nThe first bitcoin-linked exchange-traded fund (ETF) from ProShares, which tracks the bitcoin futures market made its debut in October 2021. It helped to revive the Bitcoin bull run after marking a significant regulatory milestone for the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nDespite not allowing investors to buy crypto directly, this futures-based ETF could pave the way for the approval of spot ETFs in the future.\n\nIs a Bitcoin spot ETF about to get approved?\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Seyffart and Balchunas have also revised the approval odds for a spot Bitcoin ETF upwards to 65% from 50% a few weeks ago.\n\nThe increased likelihood of Bitcoin ETF approval is influenced by SEC Chairman Gary Gensler's potentially more receptive stance and strategic moves by leading crypto investment firms like Grayscale and BlackRock\n\nThe first leveraged Bitcoin ETF\n\nOn a historic note, the SEC greenlighted the first leveraged Bitcoin ETF last month. This trailblazing product has attracted a tide of over $4 million in trading volume during the first day, with approximately half a million dollars worth of shares being scooped up within the first quarter of an hour."

        "content": "Ethereum price is currently still below $2,000 but this could quickly change if some things were to come to pass. Some of the most notable things that have been going on for the cryptocurrency include the multiple exchange-traded funds (ETFs) filings that have been made to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nWhen Will An Ethereum ETF Be Approved?\n\nThe topic of Ethereum futures ETFs has become hotter especially after Bitcoin futures ETFs received multiple approvals from the SEC since 2021. However, even two years after the first Bitcoin futures ETF was approved, the regulator is still yet to approve an Ethereum futures ETF.\n\nDespite this, investment firms have remained undeterred as they have continued to file for Ethereum futures ETFs. As reported by NewsBTC, there are now a total of six ETH futures ETF filings with the SEC after Grayscale refiled its application with the regulator. In addition to Grayscale, VanEck, ProShares, Volatility Shares, Bitwise, and Roundhill all have pending applications with the commission.\n\nWith so many interested applications, there is now mounting pressure on the SEC to approve the first Ethereum futures ETF to trade in the country. And according to people familiar with the matter, it may not be much longer until the first ETF is approved for trading.\n\nThe reason behind this is the fact that the regulator had previously asked interested parties to halt activities regarding applying for ETH ETFs. However, with the re-filings and new filings, it signals that the SEC may finally be ready to review the applications and consider them.\n\nETH price still holding above $1,800 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nWhat Happens When An ETF Gets Approved?\n\nThe anticipation around a possible approval for an Ethereum futures ETF is mostly the implications of such an occurrence. Like in 2021 when the first Bitcoin futures ETF was approved in October, the price of BTC surged drastically, reaching a new all-time high price just a month later.\n\nETFs are an instrument that helps to bring more volume to an asset and if an ETH ETF gets approved, the price of ETH is expected to rally. This would be the result of a combination of the new volume and interest, as well as the euphoria that comes with it. An ETF approval would likely push the price of ETH above $2,000 and could trigger another bull rally for the coin.\n\nCurrently, all eyes are on October 16, 2023, when one new filing and four re-filings for Ethereum futures ETFs become active.\n\nFollow Best Owie on Twitter for market insights, updates, and the occasional funny tweet\u2026 Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Hidden Bullish Agenda Reveals Rup-Up to $2,400 - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price is leading the volatile stint in altcoins, trading 1.3% down to $1,837. The most prominent smart contracts token, with $222 billion of market capitalization and $6.8 billion in the 24-hour trading volume, briefly dipped below support at $1,830, touched lows of $1,825 before recovering to $1,835 at the time of writing on Thursday.\n\nEthereum Reveals 20% Inverse H&S Pattern Breakout\n\nEthereum price since mid-June is stuck in a narrow range, with movement on the upside barely touching $2,000, while the situation around the critical support at $1,800 seems to get dire for the bulls.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIf a rebound above $1,900 does not follow swiftly, selling pressure will likely increase as more traders evaluate their positions. It is worth pointing out that Ethereum price is now trading below two crucial moving averages, starting with the 50-day EMA (red) and the 100-day EMA (blue).\n\nBased on the prevailing technical picture tapping insights from other technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which has since the beginning of July sustained a downtrend to the oversold region, and the sell signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), a knee-jerk bullish reaction is highly unlikely.\n\nThat said, investors may want to start acclimatizing to Ethereum plunging below $1,800 and possibly revisiting support at the 200-day EMA (purple) at $1,785 before considering a trend reversal to $2,000.\n\nIf push comes to shove, declines may stretch to $1,600 allowing sidelined investors to get a lower-priced exposure to ETH, subsequently building the momentum for a larger trend reversal.\n\nA deeper analysis of the daily chart reveals an inverse head and shoulders (H&S) pattern. It is a bullish reversal pattern that signals the end of a downtrend and the start of an uptrend.\n\nThe H&S consists of three troughs, with the middle one being the lowest and the other two being roughly equal in height. The pattern is confirmed when the price breaks above the neckline, which is a resistance level connecting the highs of the two shoulders at $2,000.\n\nTraders should consider keenly following this pattern to identify a potential change in trend direction and enter long positions when the price confirms the breakout beyond the $2,000 level. The target price is usually calculated by adding the height of the pattern to the neckline, for instance, 19.30% to $2,412.\n\nPropping Ethereum for a rally in the near future is the gradual increase in its DeFi total value locked (TVM), as shown by data from Coinglass. The value of all the crypto assets locked in Ethereum-based smart contracts has since mid-Jun has been rising following a longstanding downtrend from mid-April.\n\nThis increase in the TVL means Ethereum supply on exchanges is shrinking, thus reducing the potential selling pressure\u2014and creating a suitable environment for a rally.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price is bearishly heading into the weekend and could break below the $29,182 support level as volatility wanes.\n\nEthereum price downtrend could continue amid falling momentum and the aura of a bearish BTC.\n\nRipple price eyes further break down as bears capitalize on increasing volatility to seize the market.\n\nBitcoin price is trading with a bearish bias on the 15-minute timeframe, an outlook that has been mimicked by both Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) price as crypto markets slide into the weekend with modesty and calm. Accordingly, experts do not expect any quick movements for the next couple of days, even as triangles form on intraday charts.\n\nAlso Read: Binance approving SHIB as a collateralized asset causes 10 billion in open interest as Shiba Inu price rises.\n\nBitcoin price slides into the weekend with calm\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is testing the lower boundary of a triangle pattern forming on the 15-minute chart, with an overall bearish outlook after flipping the 200-, 100- and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) at $29,224, $29,218, and $9,223 levels respectively from a support to a resistance level.\n\nAs the weekend settles in, Bitcoin price may not record a striking move, as is characteristic of weekend volatility, except for the current bearish pull that continues to force BTC southward. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is heading south as the histograms of the Awesome Oscillators also drop, suggesting falling momentum.\n\nAn increase in selling pressure could see Bitcoin price test the early August lows at around $29,038 to collect liquidity before a possible uptrend.\n\nBTC/USDT 15-min chart\n\nConversely, an increase in buying pressure above current levels could see Bitcoin price bounce north, first shattering past the resistance confluence between the three EMAs before a possible tag of the upper boundary of the technical formation. However, for a confirmed uptrend, Bitcoin price must record a decisive 15-minute candlestick close above $29,359.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price holds above $29,000 after below-expectations US NFP data.\n\nEthereum price mimics BTC\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is following on the heels of BTC, heading south in the 15-minute timeframe with its price action consolidating into a triangle. Noteworthy, such technical formations are often penultimate (second from last) and moving in a trend. In the case of BTC and ET, the overall trend is a bearish correction that began after the July peak.\n\nAs momentum continues to fall, indicated by the southbound RSI and the reducing AO histograms, the bearish grip for Ethereum price could increase, sending the PoS token lower, potentially breaching the $1,836 support. In the dire case, ETH could extend lower to find support at around the $1,831 support level. This would be the most likely turnaround point for ETH.\n\nETH/USDT 15-min chart\n\nConversely, a resurgence by bulls could see Ethereum price bounce from the lower trendline of the triangle and head north to flip the three EMAs back to support. However, the gloomy outlook would only be invalidated upon a strong move above the $1,849 resistance level.\n\nAlso Read: Ether ETF applications flood the SEC as ProShares files the 11th\n\nRipple price volatility increases\n\nRipple (XRP) price is also sliding, with an overall bearish outlook that could extend if bulls continue sitting on their hands. As overhead pressure continues to build, XRP could soon breach the immediate support at $0.657 to collect the liquidity underneath.\n\nThis liquidity could help stabilize the market and give bulls a possible reentry point, but delayed entry could see Ripple price extend further south before finding a turnaround point. Noteworthy, as XRP heads south, it continuously writes off the July 13 gains.\n\nXRP/USDT 15-min chart\n\nIf sidelined and late investors come in, Ripple price could be headed north, with a successful escape from the foothold of the 50-,100-, and 200-day EMA at $0.663, $0.665, and $0.671, respectively, confirming the uptrend.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple plan to re-engage with US market could trigger XRP price recovery."

The price was rejected at the resistance trendline, leading to a 5% drop in the price of ETC over the last five days.\n\nThe falling price of Ethereum Classic warns of a prolonged selling spree if it breaks below the channel pattern.\n\nCurrently, the ETC prices struggle to take second support at the 50% Fibonacci level at $17.83. However, the price action still depicts a bullish flag pattern and maintains the positive reversal theory. The price action also depicts a double bottom forming at $17.83, increasing the reversal chances.\n\nAdditionally, the RSI and MACD indicators fail to display any bullish divergence to support a reversal theory. The RSI line falls trends lower than the halfway line with an uptick. Meanwhile, the MACD indicator shows a remarkable growth in bearish histograms.\n\nCurrently, the ETC price forms a doji candle at the support confluence of the 50% Fibonacci level and the support trendline. This projects a possibility of a morning star pattern formation, leading to a bull cycle within the channel to $18.75.\n\nOn an optimistic side note, the flag breakout rally can pump the ETH prices by 15% to challenge the overhead supply at $20.\n\nOn the flip side, a fall below the 50% Fibonacci level will plunge the ETC prices to $17."

        "title": "Learn why Ethereum Classic and Monero Miners switching to Bitcoin Spark - CoinCodex",
        "content": "A new project fast attracting miners' attention as it demystifies the mining difficulty is now here. Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Monero (XMR) miners are showing an increasing interest in the latest addition to the crypto world, Bitcoin Spark (BTCS). Let\u2019s explore why Bitcoin Spark is an appealing option for Ethereum Classic and Monero miners.\n\nBitcoin Spark (BTCS)\n\nBitcoin Spark is a Bitcoin hard fork providing alternatives to the energy-intensive Bitcoin mining process. This emerging cryptocurrency attracts attention due to its unique features appealing to miners seeking rewarding mining opportunities. Unlike Bitcoin\u2019s Proof-of-work mechanism, Bitcoin Spark uses an all-new blockchain technology called \"Proof-Of-Process\" (PoP). PoP combines PoS and PoW for a streamlined process that moderates entry barriers to mining, allowing anyone to mine. The Bitcoin Spark PoP mechanism strives for equitable distribution of mining rewards irrespective of computational power and application of the proof-of-work system by renting out mining device processing power to various entities. The proprietary proof-of-work/proof-of-stake approach allows processing power to be rented out for different purposes.\n\nA Bitcoin Spark application makes mining accessible to all, regardless of the stake, and computational power, as miners are algorithmically selected. The BTCS team is developing a user-friendly mining program compatible with various devices, ensuring secure virtual access. The app, doubling up as a wallet, is compatible with Linux, Mac OS, iOS, Windows, and Android.\n\nThis platform fosters security and true decentralization, preventing any single entity from dominating the network. Bitcoin Spark mitigates the risk of single miners gaining excessive control and compromising network security by avoiding linear reward computation. Using multiple devices and miners for transaction finality further enhances network security. Mining rewards are distributed through a revenue-based system, ensuring profitability and self-sustainability for a stable network.\n\nBitcoin Spark's ICO phase one is set to kick off in August, offering one BTCS token at $1.50. Early adopters will be rewarded with a 20% bonus. With such affordability, imagine buying Bitcoin when it was only 1$. The enticing opportunity to purchase Bitcoin Spark at such a low price evokes thoughts of its early days. BTCS potentially yields impressive 800% returns when the token launches at $10.\n\nHow to mine Ethereum Classic?\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) is the original Ethereum blockchain that did not undergo a hard fork after the 2016 DAO hack. It supports layer 2 scaling solutions, aiming to make blockchain transactions faster and cheaper. ETC relies on Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining, making it a decentralized and open-source platform. Miners use GPUs and ASIC mining rigs to participate in creating ETC tokens, and mining through a pool is currently profitable. ETC and Ethereum use the same Ethash algorithm, but ETC's lower hash rate allows for faster block generation. Miners play a crucial role in securing the network and preventing double-spending attacks. To mine ETC, one needs an ETC wallet, suitable hardware, mining software, and the choice between solo, cloud mining, or joining a mining pool.\n\nHow to mine Monero?\n\nMonero cryptocurrency uses proof-of-work mining with the RandomX algorithm to achieve distributed consensus. It aims to maintain egalitarian mining, making it ASIC-resistant and allowing everyone to mine using consumer-grade hardware. Miners can choose between solo mining or mining in a pool, with each method having pros and cons. Solo mining increases network security but may take longer to find blocks, while pool mining offers frequent payouts but requires trusting a centralized pool. P2Pool is another option, providing the benefits of both solo and pool mining. Monero can be mined on CPUs and GPUs, and various mining software options are available. However, the Monero Project does not endorse a specific pool, software, or hardware.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin Spark offers a sweet deal for Ethereum Classic and Monero miners to consider. With its unique PoP consensus mechanism, efficient use of processing power, and focus on fair reward distribution, Bitcoin Spark addresses the limitations of other cryptocurrencies.\n\nLearn more on Bitcoin Spark here:\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article.

        "content": "Attorney Rispoli said Bitcoin and XRP are the only large-cap tokens with legal clarity in the US, as the court ruled that Ethereum (ETH) has no protection as non-security.\n\nIn a recent tweet, prominent cryptocurrency lawyer Fred Rispoli said only Bitcoin and XRP are large-cap tokens with legal clarity in the United States.\n\nHodl Law v. SEC\n\nThe pro-XRP lawyer made this known recently while providing an update about Hodl Law PLLC\u2019s lawsuit against the SEC.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn the lawsuit, Hodl Law asked the court to rule that engaging in transactional activities on the Ethereum network does not implicate securities laws.\n\nIn response, the SEC filed a motion in February 2023 to dismiss the lawsuit. On July 27, 2023, the court granted the regulatory agency\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n\nAttorney Rispoli Says ETH Has No Protection As Non-Security\n\nReacting to the development, Attorney Rispoli said that although the court granted the SEC\u2019s motion to dismiss, it confirmed that ETH does not have any protection as a non-security.\n\nBREAKING! The Court in our #ETHDec case granted @SECGov's motion to dismiss but at the same time confirmed there is no protection for #ETH as a non-security. At this point in time in the US, only #BTC and #XRP are large cap tokens that have legal clarity.https://t.co/60g6D9XhRW \u2014 Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) August 1, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nConsequently, the prominent crypto lawyer said BTC and XRP are the only large-cap tokens with legal clarity. In other words, XRP is the only altcoin with legal clarity in the United States.\n\nJudge Torres Declares XRP Non-Security\n\nIt is worth noting that XRP recently received clarity from US District Judge Analisa Torres in the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit. As reported, Judge Torres ruled that XRP is not in and of itself a security.\n\nRipple Labs described the ruling as a resounding win for the company and the entire crypto industry. The blockchain company said the case has always been about getting clarity regarding the regulatory status of XRP.\n\nWhile the SEC labeled XRP as a security, Ripple argued otherwise, thus prompting the judge to comment on the coin\u2019s legal status.\n\nInterestingly, the judge agreed with Ripple that XRP itself is not a security. The judge clarified that selling the coin as part of an investment contract does not automatically make it a security.\n\nAccording to the Chamber of Digital Commerce, the ruling has established a legal precedent for the crypto industry. The crypto advocacy group said the verdict distinguishes between an investment contract and the underlying asset."

The securities regulator is reportedly inclined to consider the Ether Futures ETFs following several applications by TradFi and crypto players over the past week.\n\nConsideration of Ethereum Futures ETF Won\u2019t Guarantee Approval\n\nWhen Grayscale Investments filed an application with the SEC to offer the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF back in May, fellow funds including Bitwise, Roundhill Investments, and Valkyrie followed suit with their own ETH futures-based ETFs. However, the SEC reportedly asked the funds to stop pursuing ETH futures ETFs and withdraw their applications.\n\nOn July 28, Volatility Shares submitted an application for its Ether Strategy ETF. The application was followed by similar filings from VanEck, ProShares, Grayscale, Bitwise, and Roundhill. The funds submitted applications to offer their own versions of Ethereum Futures ETFs.\n\nCiting two sources familiar with the latest ether futures ETF filings, Blockworks reported that the SEC had \u201cindicated its readiness to publicly consider such a product.\u201d The source added that the securities regulator\u2019s consideration of the ETH futures ETFs did not guarantee their approval.\n\nFrom a product perspective, all the ETF issuers are probably thinking it\u2019s worth the cost of filing rather than risk falling behind in case ETH [ETFs] take off, even in futures form,\u201d Henry Jim, Analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence\n\nIf the SEC takes a favorable stance on the latest applications for Ethereum futures-based ETFs, they would go live in 75 days from the date of filing. This would mean that Volatility Shares\u2019 Ether Strategy ETF could launch on October 12, followed by the debut of Grayscale, Bitwise, Roundhill, and ProShares ETFs on October 16."

Based on the SEC\u2019s deadlines, the first in line for approval or denial is Volatility Shares\u2019 Ethereum Strategy ETF, by October 11.\n\n\u201cThe SEC appears to be changing its posture towards crypto, based on reports of its back channel messaging to ETF issuers,\u201d wrote the analysts. \u201cWe believe the SEC would have a hard time in court defending the denial of Ethereum futures ETFs after approving standard and leveraged Bitcoin futures ETFs. \u201c\n\nBitcoin Spot ETF Approval Odds\n\nAs of August 4, there are 9 active Bitcoin spot ETF applications pending review by the SEC, with the latest applicant being from CBOE on behalf of the Global X Bitcoin Trust.\n\nLike all other applications, CBOE\u2019s latest filing selects Coinbase as a surveillance-sharing partner for detecting market manipulation \u2013 a crucial issue for the SEC for which its denied every major spot ETF application so far.\n\nShares for a Bitcoin spot ETF are backed by actual BTC held under custody by the trust and its partners. By contrast, futures ETFs are backed by Bitcoin futures contracts, which may not perfectly track the price of BTC at any particular time.\n\nUnlike competitors, Grayscale is vying to convert its Bitcoin trust into a spot ETF by battling the SEC in court. The company argues that the regulator\u2019s approval of futures ETFs, but not spot ETFs, demonstrates \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d treatment of the latter.\n\nRecently, Bloomberg analysts raised their odds of a Bitcoin spot ETF approval this year to 65%, which they expect will come on the back of a Grayscale court victory."

Since the rejection from $2,000 around mid-July, recovery attempts have been minimal, with the least resistance path mainly downward.\n\nBased on the prevailing technical picture, bears have the upper hand, especially with Ethereum price below all the major moving averages such as the 50-day EMA (red), the 100-day EMA (blue), and the 200-day EMA (purple).\n\nadvertisement\n\nSupport at $1,830 is critical for the resumption of the uptrend, but if declines intensify, the buyer congestion at $1,800 will come in handy.\n\nEthereum Price Final Capitulation\n\nThe crypto winter has lasted well over two years with attribute to many attacks on the blockchain ecosystem, including the Terra crash \u201cthrough which governments are stepping in with a regulatory framework\u2026 to protect investors,\u201d Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, a popular analyst told investors on Friday.\n\nThis push to regulate the market, although understandable, is exerting a lot of pressure to the extent of risking the survival of the crypto ecosystem.\n\nIn addition to the recently resolved matter between Ripple and the SEC, the regulator is suing Coinbase and Binance, and the DoJ has been investigating the latter exchange platform. In all this, proposals for Ethereum and Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have surged in the past couple of months, bringing institutions like Blackrock and Valkyrie into the industry.\n\nEthereum and most other altcoins, according to Poppe, \u201chave been trending downwards for 18-24 months straight.\n\nHowever, one notable fundamental factor is that the supply on exchange continues to shrink to the lowest levels while staking both on the Ethereum protocol and liquid staking platforms like Lido soar to the highest levels since the implementation of the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nThe mundane market structure represents \u201cthe second stage of capitulation, which is time.\u201d Investors will continue to feel like markets are unresponsive, with some shunning crypto for other industry sectors.\n\nAs for investors, perhaps excluding traders, it is wise to keep calm and be patient with the market. Accumulation, according to Poppe the best strategy at the moment, with institutions like Blackrock jumping in.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for Ethereum Price in The Short Term?\n\nThe bearish outlook in both the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and the Money Flow Index (MFI) hints at declines continuing to $1,800 in the short term. In addition to the sell signal, the MACD holds below the mean line (0.00), further reinforcing the bearish grip.\n\nIf bulls manage the arrest the bearish situation at $1,830 traders can prepare to seek fresh exposure to ETH longs after the price steps above the 100-day EMA. The subsequent break above the 50-day EMA at $1,866 would serve as confirmation for a stronger uptrend to be validated by recovery past the descending trendline for gains above $2,000.\n\nRelated Articles"

The application, submitted on August 3, includes a proposal for the Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight ETF, designed to measure \u201cthe performance of holding long positions in the nearest maturing monthly bitcoin and ether futures contracts.\u201d\n\nBitwise filed its application on the same date in a parallel move, seeking approval for an ETF that equally weights exposure to Bitcoin and Ether. The fund aims to track \u201cthe performance of holding long positions in the nearest maturing monthly bitcoin and ether futures contracts.\u201d\n\nProShares Becomes the 11th Company to File for Ethereum ETF\n\nIt is important to note that ProShares and Bitwise have taken different steps in expanding their crypto-related funds. ProShares has already been active in the digital asset space, having previously filed applications for other cryptocurrency-related ETFs, including one focused on the metaverse.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitwise joins the fray with a series of ETF applications for Ethereum. Notably, the SEC has received a total of 11 Ether-related ETF filings in less than a week, all of which are centered on futures ETFs. The wave of applications began with Volatility Shares filing for the Ether Strategy ETF on July 28. ProShares is now adding its own Ether ETF proposals to the mix, making the company the 11th to join the race. The fund manager filed for a total of four Ether-related ETFs within a few days, including a dual Bitcoin and Ether futures strategy ETF, a short Ether strategy ETF and an Ether strategy ETF.\n\nUPDATE: Another one\u2026. 11 ETFs Filed\u2026 Proshares filed for a 4th ETF with Ethereum futures.

Bloomberg\u2019s ETF analyst, James Seyffart, believes that ProShares\u2019 multiple Ether-based ETF applications within a short period may indicate a favorable stance from the SEC. However, he also acknowledged the regulatory challenges related to approving ETFs based on Ether futures contracts, which the SEC has been cautious about in the past.\n\nIn contrast, Lark Davis, a well-known crypto influencer, expressed skepticism about the prospects of spot crypto ETFs. He is critical of futures-based ETFs, citing concerns about potential market manipulation and calling for a focus on spot ETF approvals.\n\nThe recent influx of ETF applications comes amid speculation about the SEC\u2019s stance toward digital assets. Retail investors have shown increasing interest in ETFs, and market observers believe that the approval of ETFs could pave the way for the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAs the SEC reviews these applications, the cryptocurrency community eagerly awaits the regulatory decisions that could shape the future of digital asset investments and broaden the accessibility of virtual assets to retail investors."

        "content": "Welcome to the Future of Finance, where Fortune asks prominent people at major companies about their jobs, how their firm fits into the crypto ecosystem, and what it all means for how we use money.\n\nTezos, an open-source blockchain launched in 2018 as an alternative to Ethereum and other layer-1 blockchains, uses a governance system to enable those who own its tokens to vote on the future of the blockchain. This move, it argues, makes it less susceptible to forks that have affected other protocols like Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nArthur Breitman cofounded Tezos with his wife, Kathleen Breitman, in 2014. Since officially launching its blockchain in 2018, Tezos has become one of the most popular networks in the crypto space.\n\nArthur Breitman spoke to Fortune about the increased presence of traditional financial firms in crypto, the pitfalls of Ethereum and Bitcoin, and the blockchain\u2019s future.\n\n(This interview has been edited for length and clarity.)\n\nCan you tell me about your background?\n\nMy background is in computer science and applied mathematics. I worked for many years in quantitative finance but also a bit in robotics. I got super interested in the solution of new technologies around blockchains, ways to make them better, smart contracts, proof of stake. There lacked a formal governance process in blockchains that would allow them to incorporate those innovations while remaining decentralized. And so that got me into the rabbit hole of thinking about governance on blockchains. Tezos is an incarnation of that: It\u2019s a blockchain that essentially has a governance mechanism that lets participants in the network vote and accept or reject or proposed amendments, which improves the blockchain overall.\n\nWhat do you think has changed the most in crypto over the past 10 years?\n\nThe ecosystem has become a lot less ideological over time. It started by being strongly about world affairs, and ideology, and ideas, and it\u2019s evolved way way out of that. I think we should get back to that because that\u2019s the real value prop. The reason that decentralized blockchains exist is they solve a social problem, they solve an institutional problem. And we\u2019ve seen an explosion of solutions that attempt to solve noninstitutional problems, but I think those are overhyped and will fade over time.\n\nDo you think that the entry of traditional financial firms could be a positive, bringing more people or investments into crypto?\n\nI don\u2019t see it as the primary driver of growth. It\u2019s a driver. Fundamentally, where these systems shine is in providing alternative institutions. I think they are more about disruptive innovation than they are about incremental innovation. If you\u2019re a big institution, and you\u2019re trusted by your customers, you\u2019re well established, you know, yes, I would say blockchains can solve some problems for you. But if you\u2019re not established, and you don\u2019t have the trust of your customers, then being able to create systems that do not rely on that trust is very interesting. So for large financial institutions, I think it boils down sometimes more to efficiency or distribution. But if you really want to see where those networks shine, it\u2019s going to be with players who are not established.\n\nHow did your background in finance influence your work on Tezos?\n\nAs a quant I would say that I have some skills in financial engineering and an understanding of microeconomics. When we look at the systems, you see a lot of people who are ignoring basic financial principles. You can see this with Terra Luna, for example. If you have a background in financial engineering, I think it\u2019s pretty obvious why this thing was going to collapse. But you know, for some reason, we saw even people from traditional finance get fooled by this, and it\u2019s very bizarre.\n\nIt helped me avoid a lot of basic mistakes that people are making in the space because sometimes they don\u2019t have the background to understand how financial systems can work. I\u2019m not talking about existing financial infrastructure. I\u2019m talking about general principles, you know, \u201cWhat is an asset?\u201d \u201cHow do cash flows work?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s an interest rate?\u201d\u2014very basic financial principles. Designing a blockchain is a very multidisciplinary thing. You need to understand cryptography, you need to understand distributed systems, but you also need to understand finance and economics, and a lot of people do not.\n\nIt seems like sort of a recurring issue, this lack of understanding of basic economic principles. Do you do find that\u2019s been the case with some of the disasters that we\u2019ve seen in crypto over the past few years?\n\nI think some people want to turn a blind eye to it, because I remember\u2014you know, the idea behind Terra Luna is not new. The idea started with a project called Basis, and I remember being emailed by a venture fund asking me to do due diligence on the project, and I told them exactly why it would collapse, and they still invested anyway. So, you know, I think there\u2019s also some cynicism in the industry that is unhealthy.\n\nI read an interview recently where you mentioned how Bitcoin was stuck in the past because of technological limitations that Tezos isn\u2019t affected by. You\u2019ve also criticized Ethereum for dragging its feet on proof of stake. Could you tell me a little bit more about how Tezos has an advantage over the two biggest players in crypto?\n\nThe technology on Tezos is superior to the one that is on Ethereum\u2014it\u2019s faster, it\u2019s more scalable, it\u2019s more robust\u2014so there\u2019s many advantages. Obviously, there\u2019s other considerations, and both Bitcoin and Ethereum are much bigger than Tezos in terms of brand perception and market reach, and obviously those things matter. But purely on a technical perspective, Tezos has an existing static advantage over Ethereum, but it\u2019s also a dynamic advantage because there\u2019s a culture of innovation in the Tezos space that\u2019s been bolstered by the governance model. As a result, Tezos has had 14 successful upgrades, each by votes of the community. You might think of governance initially as just something about safety, but it turns into a powerful engine for innovation.\n\nWhy do you think Bitcoin is stuck in the past as you have said in a previous interview?\n\nBitcoin, I think, understood very early on that if you\u2019re willing to fork willy-nilly to implement innovation, you risk being captured\u2014you risk social capture of the protocol. And to avoid that, they created these very strong cultural norms against ever changing Bitcoin. They\u2019ve succeeded at that, they\u2019ve gained a lot of stability from that, and there\u2019s absolutely value in stability and predictability. But the tradeoff that they made is that Bitcoin basically doesn\u2019t move anymore.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of applications that people have found very, very useful on other blockchains, such as having marketplaces for collectibles, that you cannot build on Bitcoin. Bitcoin also doesn\u2019t have a good story for how to preserve its security as the reward dwindles. Bitcoin wants to maintain a 21 million Bitcoin cap. Unfortunately, without a block reward, you don\u2019t really have a good way to incentivize miners, and as the block reward goes down so does the security budget of Bitcoin. So there\u2019s a lot of real issues, and there\u2019s a refusal to tackle them inside the Bitcoin community.\n\nWhy is improving throughput important for Tezos?\n\nNo blockchain has really scaled, and there are use cases which really depend on a very large amount of throughput. We haven\u2019t really been able to see them, because we don\u2019t have the technology, and when I say \u201cwe\u201d I mean the industry in general. There hasn\u2019t been the ability to support these use cases.\n\nThe other thing is, Tezos has had some success having much lower fees than Ethereum, but a question that often comes up is, \u201cWell, if Tezos has a lot of adoption, what will happen to the fees?\u201d And so even if you have low fees, people may be reluctant in using your network because they say, \u201cWell, you may have low fees now, but if and when you have more success then your fees will go up, and as a result I don\u2019t want to deploy my application here. I may as well use an incumbent, which has high fees now, because I can\u2019t avoid the high fees in the long run.\u201d\n\nRight now, it costs pennies to do a transaction on Tezos and actually $2 to do a transaction on Ethereum, so it\u2019s already cheaper by orders of magnitude. So it\u2019s not about being even cheaper. It\u2019s more about being able to say that it\u2019s going to stay cheap.\n\nWhat do you think about the future of finance?\n\nI think we\u2019re very limited in the assets that are traded today on markets. We have public markets for public equities, which are fairly large and liquid for developed countries. And then if say you want to invest in a smaller country today, you look at an ETF of a developing country and inside you\u2019ll find a bank, a big family-owned conglomerate, and a mining company. It doesn\u2019t really reflect the economy. There is a very long tail of businesses that are very hard to invest in. There\u2019s a very long tail of alternative assets that don\u2019t really have liquid markets. And sometimes it\u2019s for good reason. A reason it can be hard to invest in a smaller business sometimes is that for external investors you need to have a certain amount of transparency and adequate overhead that smaller businesses can\u2019t afford.\n\nSometimes it has to do with the financial infrastructure being immature, and to the extent blockchains can improve financial infrastructure I think we can have a wider array of businesses. It\u2019s also possible, for businesses that run more of their operation on a chain, bringing transparency and making it easier for them to have external investors, because all of a sudden their accounting is more transparent, because all of a sudden external investors can see their ledger.\n\nWe\u2019ll also, I think, see a more global financial system, one that\u2019s not necessarily as focused on developed markets. Like I said, there\u2019s a lot of interesting assets outside of developed markets."

        "content": "Mastering the Art of NFT Annihilation: Unraveling the Mystery of How to Burn an NFT\n\n\u200dThe non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace has become a bustling hub of digital art, innovation, and investment.\n\nBut what happens when you want to obliterate an NFT from existence? Enter the intriguing world of NFT burning.\n\nAlso read: Dogecoin Army Buzzing with Anticipation After Elon Musk\u2019s Tweet\n\nThis comprehensive guide will walk you through How to Burn a non-fungible token, including its purpose, steps on various blockchains, and implications for your digital asset\u2019s future.\n\nSource: Information Age\n\nThe Art of NFT Destruction: Can NFTs Be Obliterated?\n\nNon-fungible tokens, once minted on the blockchain, become immutable digital assets.\n\nHowever, you can destroy or \u201cburn\u201d them through a process similar to sending the token into a digital black hole.\n\nThis act, known as \u201cburning,\u201d sends the token to an inaccessible, unspendable address, effectively wiping it from existence.\n\nAlso read: Shiba Inu: $1000 Investment on ShibaSwap Debut, Profit Revealed\n\nBurning an NFT: What Does It Entail?\n\nThe act of burning a non-fungible token is synonymous with completely deleting it. It involves the transfer of a token to an address that remains inaccessible to all.\n\nOnce a non-fungible token is burned, it is impossible to retrieve it. Hence, it is crucial to be sure that burning is your desired course of action.\n\nInterestingly, as the digital asset dissolves, its history and record remain imprinted on the blockchain, providing evidence of its existence and subsequent annihilation.\n\nThe Void Address: Understanding the Token Burn Address\n\nSource: Cointurk\n\nAn NFT burn address is a specialized wallet address that acts as a digital incinerator for tokens. Also known as an \u201caddress eater,\u201d this null address is inaccessible and holds no keys.\n\nIt is the ultimate lock without a key.\n\nOn the Ethereum blockchain, the burn address is often represented as 0x0000000000000000000000000000dEaD.\n\nPolygon\u2019s burn address appears as 0x0000000000000000000000000000, while Solana employs the burn address \u2018 remove.sol.\u2019\n\nDispatching an NFT to these addresses permanently eliminates it from circulation.\n\nThe Price of NFT Annihilation: Does Burning an NFT Cost Anything?\n\nYes, the process of burning an NFT incurs a cost.\n\nThis transaction fee, colloquially referred to as a \u201cgas fee,\u201d is required to process the burning of your non-fungible token.\n\nThe fee can fluctuate based on the current supply and demand on the blockchain.\n\nThe cost of burning an NFT can range anywhere from $0.00025 to $100.\n\nThe Step-by-Step Guide: How to Burn an NFT\n\nThe burning process is straightforward. Below is a step-by-step guide to burning your NFT on popular blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon.\n\nIncinerating an Ethereum NFT\n\nHere\u2019s your guide on How to Burn an NFT on Ethereum:\n\nAccess the wallet or marketplace holding your NFT. Choose the NFT you wish to burn and hit the \u201cTransfer\u201d button. Direct your NFT to Ethereum\u2019s official burn address, which is 0x00000000000000000000000000000000dEaD. Settle the required gas fees to transfer your NFT and click \u201cConfirm.\u201d\n\nWith these steps, your NFT will be permanently dissolved and removed from the marketplace. Remember, gas fees can vary based on supply and demand on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nBurning a Polygon NFT\n\nThe process of burning an NFT on the Polygon blockchain mirrors that of Ethereum, except for the burn address.\n\nHere\u2019s how:\n\nNavigate to the item page for the NFT you wish to burn. Click on the transfer button. Enter the Polygon burn address: 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000. Hit \u201cTransfer,\u201d confirm the transaction with your wallet, pay the gas fees, and you\u2019re done!\n\nObliterating a Solana NFT\n\nBurning an NFT on Solana differs slightly from other NFT blockchains.\n\nThe Phantom Wallet, a popular Solana wallet, has built-in burning features that reward users with SOL for burning certain NFTs.\n\nFor NFTs that aren\u2019t supported by the built-in burning features, use the following steps:\n\nOpen your Solana wallet and locate the NFT you wish to burn. Add the \u2018 remove.sol \u2018 wallet address in the recipient field. Confirm the transaction and pay the associated gas fees.\n\nThe \u2018remove.sol\u2019 address is a graveyard for unwanted NFTs.\n\nOnce you send your NFT there, there\u2019s no turning back; the burning process becomes irreversible.\n\nMonetary Compensation for Burning an NFT: Is It Possible?\n\nMonetary compensation for burning an NFT is platform-dependent.\n\nWhile Ethereum and Polygon offer no return, platforms like the Phantom Wallet provide a unique mechanism that rewards users with SOL for burning certain NFTs.\n\nHence, it\u2019s advisable to check the specifics of the platform used to determine if it offers a reward.\n\nReasons to Burn an NFT: Why Would You Do It?\n\nThe act of burning an NFT serves several purposes.\n\nIt can be a strategic tool to control the value of an asset. Since NFTs appreciate when demand surpasses supply, reducing the supply via burning can potentially increase the price of the remaining tokens.\n\nBurning can also expunge flawed or redundant tokens from circulation, which is particularly useful when an excess number of tokens devalues individual tokens.\n\nMoreover, burning NFTs can help build trust and credibility, especially during the early phases of a token\u2019s lifecycle.\n\nCreators often burn unsold tokens post-launch to demonstrate accountability and safeguard the interests of token buyers, enhancing their credibility.\n\nCertain token collections also incentivize holders to burn their tokens. For instance, Gary Vaynerchuk recently launched Burn Island, a burn-to-redeem program that rewards VeeFriends holders for burning their tokens.\n\nSecurity Measures: Can Someone Else Burn My NFT?\n\nNo one can burn your non-fungible token without your consent.\n\nUnless they have access to your wallet keys, your NFT is safe.\n\nHowever, some smart contracts might incorporate a \u201cburn mechanism,\u201d enabling you to destroy your token.\n\nThis implies that you can design a smart contract to permit burning your non-fungible token or even allow others to do so.\n\nThe Permanence of Burning: Can a Burned, Non-Fungible Token Be Recovered?\n\nThe burning is a permanent process.\n\nOnce you dispatch a unit to an unspendable address, it becomes irretrievable.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s possible to mint a new one with similar properties and attributes, although it won\u2019t be identical to the original one.\n\nThe Aftermath: What Happens to Tokens?\n\nBurning a token doesn\u2019t physically destroy the token. Instead, it sends the NFT to a null address, rendering the token unattainable.\n\nOnce you send your token to a null address, it\u2019s lost to the ether because private keys don\u2019t exist for it.\n\nConclusion\n\nBurning a token might seem counterintuitive at first. However, it\u2019s a strategic tool for managing the value of your tokens and your non-fungible token community.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a creator seeking accountability or a non-fungible token buyer looking to capitalize on increasing values, understanding How to Burn a token can be a game-changer.\n\nOur comprehensive guide equips you to navigate the NFT inferno with confidence.\n\nSo torch those tokens, and let\u2019s see what happens!"

        "content": "Loading... Loading...\n\nBitcoin BTC/USD was trading near flat during Friday's 24-hour trading session, while Ethereum ETH/USD and Dogecoin DOGE/USD were trading in tandem with the apex crypto following jobs data released by the U.S. Labor Department.\n\nNon-farm payrolls showed a gain of 187,000 jobs last month, below the expected 200,000 figure, while the unemployment rate dropped back to 3.5%. The numbers and how they compare to data for August will help the Federal Reserve to decide whether to continue hiking interest rates in September after reinstating its tightening campaign in July.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose at one point on Friday, reacting positively to the data, before bearish pressure came in and dropped the market ETF down under Thursday\u2019s low-of-day. In comparison, the crypto market remained muted, mostly consolidating sideways. The consolidation could continue over the weekend, but if Bitcoin breaks up or down from Wednesday's mother bar, a larger move to the upside or downside could be on the horizon.\n\nIf the general market continues to slide next week, volatility in the stock market is likely to increase.\n\nTraders wishing to trade the potential volatility have multiple options, including the ConvexityShares Daily 1.5x SPIKES Futures ETF SPKY.\n\nSPKY is a 1.5x leveraged fund, which tracks the SPIKES Futures Short-Term Index and measures volatility in broad-based equities in a similar way to the ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures ETF UVXY, which tracks the movement of the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index.\n\nFor every 1% daily movement in the SPIKES Futures Short-Term Index, the SPKY fund seeks to move 1.5%, meaning that it's structured for short-term trades and should not be held for a long period of time.\n\nWant direct analysis?

Traders can watch for the apex cryptos to eventually break up or down from the mother bar on higher-than-average volume to gauge future direction.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are trading in fairly consistent but shallow downtrends, making a series of lower and lower highs. If big bearish volume eventually enters the cryptos and they continue the downward trajectory, each could eventually test support at the 200-day simple moving average (SMA).\n\nIf the cryptos break up from their respective mother bars, the downtrends are likely to be negated and the cryptos could enter into new uptrends.\n\nBitcoin has resistance above at $30,050 and at $31,418 and support below at $28,690 and at $27,133.\n\nEthereum has resistance above at $1,937 and at $2,020 and support below at $1,825 and at $1,717.\n\nLoading... Loading...\n\nThe Dogecoin Chart: On Wednesday, Dogecoin fell through the bottom horizontal trend line of a descending triangle pattern and lost support at the 200-day SMA, which is bearish. On Thursday, Dogecoin fell lower and on Friday, the crypto was consolidating with an inside bar pattern.\n\nIn Dogecoin\u2019s case, the inside bar leans bearish because the crypto has been trading steeply lower, but like with Bitcoin and Ethereum, traders can watch for a break up or down from Thursday's mother bar on higher-than-average volume to determine future direction,\n\nDogecoin has resistance above at $0.075 and $0.083 and support below at $0.07 and $0.065.\n\nRead Next: Revolut Pulls Plug On Crypto Trading In US, Blames \u2018Changing Regulatory Climate\u2019\n\nPhoto: Unsplash"

        "title": "MIT's Project Hamilton for CBDC open sources smart contract research - Ledger Insights",
        "content": "This week MIT\u2019s Digital Currency Initiative (MIT DCI) released the source code of research into smart contracts for central bank digital currency (CBDC) \u2013 PArSEC (Parallelized Architecture for Scalably Executing smart Contracts). Given the solution is designed for central banks, it is a centralized offering and sidesteps using blockchain, although it supports Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nThe work is part of Project Hamilton, an initiative in conjunction with the Boston Federal Reserve and the source code is released under the umbrella of openCBDC.\n\nIt claims to have sufficient scale for most potential central bank applications, although it is very much a research project rather than pilot or production ready.\n\nSupported use cases\n\nThe aim of the research was to explore more advanced use cases for CBDC beyond payments. This might include automated market makers (AMM) that can enable FX transactions 24/7 for cross border payments. BIS Project Mariana is exploring AMMs. MIT mentions the potential for trading bonds, tokenized securities and repurchase agreements (repos) using AMMs.\n\nAnother potential use case is to support cross border interoperability. It\u2019s possible to run separate virtual machines so that central banks and private companies can operate in separate underlying systems. This is not dissimilar to the BIS concept of the Unified Ledger.\n\nPArSEC achieves scalability\n\nMIT claims PArSEC supports a peak throughput of 118,000 transactions per second (TPS) for Ethereum-style ERC-20 transactions with an average transaction time of less than 1.6 seconds. To put that in context, a permissioned Ethereum blockchain processes around 400 TPS.\n\nScalability achieved partly by running operations in parallel and using a database rather than a blockchain.\n\nWe had some questions on the topic of scalability. Conceptually with a token based on an ERC-20 smart contract, that smart contract knows every token holder. Imagine a large country such as India where most of the population have CBDC. We wondered about the scalability of a smart contract with hundreds of millions or billions of account holders, even if it\u2019s using a database.\n\nThe PArSEC project also made some important assumptions. For example, the paper assumes \u201ccorrect smart contract execution does not require execution of smart contracts in a linear order; state must simply reflect an ordered execution, and contracts should not interfere with each other.\u201d\n\nIn the real world explicit ordering can be important, particularly for trading securities or FX, where people compete for the optimal price.\n\nUTXO versus account based\n\nThe other research modules of Project Hamilton adopted variations of Bitcoin\u2019s UTXO model partly for efficiency and also in order to preserve privacy. In contrast PArSEC uses an account-based approach for smart contracts.\n\nUTXO works similarly to cash \u2013 when you hand over a note you get some change, and the coins you receive don\u2019t particularly link you to all your other transactions. This contrasts with an account approach \u2013 if you know the identity of someone\u2019s account, you might be able to see all their transactions, so a central bank could take a look.\n\nReading this paper, one could mistakenly arrive at the conclusion that you cannot have smart contracts using UTXO. In fact R3\u2019s Corda enterprise blockchain uses UTXO and so does DAML\u2019s Canton and both have smart contracts. On the other hand, if you want to support Ethereum smart contracts without altering them, an account-based approach is necessary."

However, Bitcoin remained range-bound, but the pain in altcoin was more intense. Crypto traders awaited the uncertain decision of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the approval of spot bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nBitcoin was back in red on Thursday after a day's short-lived recovery as the largest crypto token dropped as much as 2 per cent but managed to hold 29,000-mark. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, was trading a per cent lower and slipped below $1,850-levels. Altcoins were bleeding in the early trade.\n\nBitcoin surged to $30,000 yesterday after the positive developments from Fitch downgrade of US Treasurys and Microstrategy plan to purchase more bitcoin. However, soon after a news website wrote about Binance could face U.S fraud charges, BTC immediately started to drop, said Edul Patel, CEO & Co-founder at Mudrex.\n\n\"Currently, it is trading above the $29,100 level. On the other hand, institutional investors await the US SEC's decision on the approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF. The second largest crypto, Ethereum, is trading below the $1,850 mark.

        "content": "Embark with us on an informative expedition into the exhilarating world of new cryptocurrencies. Our comprehensive guide assembles the latest analysis of the most interesting new coins of 2023, encompassing Ethereum, ApeMax, Cardano, Solana, Mina Protocol, and Worldcoin among others. Drawing from a wealth of reliable sources and constructed with care, this article showcases some of the top new cryptocurrencies in 2023. By deciphering the complexities of these new coins, we hope to uncover interesting insights on the top new crypto coins.\n\nTop New Crypto Coins in 2023 Definitive List:\n\nEthereum (ETH) ApeMax (APEMAX) Cardano (ADA) Solana (SOL) Mina Protocol (MINA) Worldcoin (WLD) Avalanche (AVAX)\n\nThis list on the top new crypto coins gathers industry leaders and well-established tokens such as Ethereum, and also discusses cutting edge and exciting new contenders such as ApeMax and Worldcoin.\n\nWhat is the best new crypto coin of 2023?\n\nWhile predicting the future of the crypto market involves inherent uncertainties, our extensive analysis leads us to spotlight ApeMax (APEMAX) as one of the top most exciting new contenders. ApeMax amalgamates innovative tokenomics with a fun and lighthearted concept, while it introduces a novel angle to token utility. The ApeMax presale is now open to eligible buyers only for a limited time.\n\nWhat makes a good new crypto coin?\n\nSome believe that a good new crypto coin is defined not only by its novelty but also by unique aspects of tokenomics. Good coins usually also have transparent and verifiable smart contracts. However, what makes a good coin is also highly subjective and depends on the individual tastes and preferences of each individual.\n\nWhat are the key features of Cardano?\n\nCardano distinguishes itself through its use of a research-driven approach to blockchain development, its unique \u201cOuroboros\u201d proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, and its commitment to sustainability. Furthermore, it aims to focus on emerging markets and improve systems efficiency, setting it apart in the crowded crypto field.\n\nIs Solana a viable Ethereum competitor?\n\nYes, Solana has often been touted by some as a viable competitor to Ethereum due to its high scalability and low transaction fees. Solana\u2019s high-throughput blockchain, which can process thousands of transactions per second, makes it a robust platform for decentralized applications and crypto projects. However, preferences regarding Solana to Ethereum or Bitcoin are highly personal and also depend on several other factors.\n\nWhat does Mina Protocol do?\n\nMina Protocol has emerged as the world\u2019s lightest blockchain, with a size that remains constant irrespective of usage. Its unique \u201csuccinct blockchain\u201d design replaces the traditional blockchain with a cryptographic proof, drastically reducing the data each user needs to download. This lightweight design makes it more accessible and scalable, facilitating greater user participation and security.\n\nIt is crucial to recognize that all cryptocurrencies carry significant risks and can experience high volatility. Before getting involved in cryptocurrencies and making any crypto purchases, it is essential to be cautious and conduct independent thorough research. Additionally, individuals from the United States, Canada, sanctioned nations, and other blocked territories are not allowed to participate in ApeMax token purchases.

Ultimately, what\u2019s \u2018best\u2019 often comes down to personal choices and individual preferences.\n\nBefore entering the domain of cryptocurrencies and pondering any decisions or acquisitions involving crypto, it is crucial to adopt a cautious and prudent approach. Conduct thorough and independent research, gain a comprehensive understanding of the potential risks, and seek counsel from unbiased specialists. Recognize the volatility and risks inherent in all cryptocurrencies.

        "content": "Matter Labs has denied allegations of source code plagiarism made by Polygon.\n\nPolygon previously accused Matter Labs of copying part of its open-source code without giving due credit.\n\nIn response, Matter Labs claimed it had sufficiently attributed the copied code to Polygon.\n\nMatter Labs, the crypto firm behind zkSync, has responded to the recent plagiarism allegations made by fellow Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution Polygon. Earlier today, Polygon accused Matter Labs\u2019 developers of copying parts of its open-source code without giving due credit for the plagiarized code. Matter Labs has denied the allegations and argued that it had sufficiently attributed the copied part to Polygon.\n\nMatter Labs: Polygon Is Making \u201cUntrue Claims\u201d\n\nEarlier today, Polygon published a blog post titled \u201cProtect the Open Source Ethos\u201d, which accused Matter Labs of copying a \u201csignificant amount\u201d of source code from the Plonky2 library to its recently unveiled proving system called Boojum. According to Polygon, the code was copied with copyrights or attribution to its original authors.\n\nPolygon also called out Matter Labs\u2019 founder Alex Gluchowski for claiming that Boojum is more efficient than Plony2. Polygon questioned the authenticity of Gluchowski\u2019s claim, given that Boojum\u2019s code concerning performance was directly copied from Plonky2. Polygon further cited Boojum\u2019s introductory post, which failed to mention the layer-2 scaling solution or its developers.\n\nIn response to Polygon\u2019s allegations, Matter Labs clarified that its Boojum proof system derived 5% of its code from Plonky2, which was \u201cprominently attributed\u201d in the first line of its library. In a statement to CoinDesk, a Matter Labs spokesperson said that Polygon\u2019s blog post made untrue claims about Boojum\u2019s code.\n\nCEO Alex Gluchowski followed up with a detailed tweet where he expressed his disappointment with Polygon\u2019s allegations. Gluchowski reiterated that only 5% of the Boojum code was based on the Plonky2 code. He added that Boojum and Plonky2 were both implementations of the Redshift, which he claimed was introduced by Matter Labs 3 years before Polygon published the Plonky2 paper.\n\nEvery decision we make as a team towards building @zksync is driven by our ethos, which is based on integrity and transparency. We have made honest mistakes in the past, but we always did our best to openly acknowledge them and take responsibility. And will always do so in the\u2026 https://t.co/4yjpSCHC2d \u2014 Alex G. \u220e (@gluk64) August 4, 2023\n\nIf the Polygon Zero team wanted additional credit, the easiest way would have been to submit a pull request which we would have happily accepted. Going ahead with public accusations of a complete lack of attribution is anything but the spirit of the Open Source movement.\u201d Alex Gluchowski, Co-founder and CEO of Matter Labs\n\nThe tension between Polygon and Matter Labs comes as both firms rush to deliver the first zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) to offer cheaper and more efficient transactions on the Ethereum network. Earlier this year, Polygon\u2019s Mihailo Bjelic and Matter Labs\u2019 Alex Gluchowski were involved in a heated exchange over the latter\u2019s zkSync Era, particularly its security audits."

        "content": "The Curve Finance team confirmed contact with the Alchemix alETH pool exploiter via on-chain messages.\n\nCurve, Metronome, and Alchemix previously asked the exploiters to return 90% of the drained funds for a 10% bounty in return.\n\nAn address holding assets stolen from JPEGd, another affected DeFi protocol, also returned funds amid recovery efforts from affected projects and white hat hackers.\n\nMeanwhile, founder Michael Egorov has sold 106 million CRV tokens in OTC deal to rebalance debts on DeFi lenders like Aave and Fraxlend.\n\nThe Alchemix/CurveFinance Exploiter returned nearly $9 million in funds drained from the DeFi protocol following on-chain negotiations spotted via Etherscan on Friday.\n\nAlchemix Finance received a blockchain transaction note asking the protocol to confirm its wallet address. The exploiter then transferred 4,820 ether over three transactions to Alchemix\u2019s multi-sig wallet. At current prices, the assets are worth $8.9 million.\n\nFriday\u2019s transaction represents a portion of around $61 million drained from decentralized exchange Curve Finance. The attacker reportedly exploited a code bug in Vyper\u2019s compiler, a smart contract programming language used by Curve across its platform.\n\nThe code bug allowed malicious attackers to drain liquidity pools affecting Metronome, Alchemix, and JPEGd. So far, exploiters have returned some of the looted assets to Alchemix and JPEGd.\n\nCurve, Metronome, and Alchemix previously asked the exploiters to return 90% of the drained funds for a 10% bounty in return. CRV gained 5% in price on Friday following news of Alchemix\u2019s recovery.\n\nCurve Founder Offloads CRV To Balance Debt\n\nCRV, Curve native token and a cryptocurrency widely used across Ethereum\u2019s DeFi lending ecosystem dipped in price following exploits on the exchange\u2019s in-house pools.\n\nThe drop in CRV\u2019s price spelled danger for loans taken by founder Michael Egorov. Egorov deposited million of CRV tokens as collateral on DeFi lending protocols like Aave and Fraxlend. These loans risked liquidation if CRV\u2019s price fell below $0.30.\n\nIn response to the CRV\u2019s declining price amid last weekend\u2019s exploit, Egorov spurred a deluge of over-the-counter (OTC) deals with some 13 investors including Tron founder Justin Sun.\n\nEgorov\u2019s CRV sales from OTC trades total 106 million CRV tokens and he received $42 million USDT in return. This liquidity has seemingly gone into balancing debts on Aave and other lenders amid concerns of a DeFi implosion.\n\nDeFi analyst Ignas opined that a CRV nosedive looked unlikely due to an increase in Curve\u2019s 3Crypto pool featuring crvUSD+ETH+CRV."

        "title": "XRP Army Outraged Over New Hinman Docs, Ethereum's Lubin - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Empower Oversight, a watchdog group, has released a new batch of documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request yesterday, sparking outrage in the XRP community. The documents reveal a deeper involvement of Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin and his company, Consensys, in the controversial June 14, 2018, cryptocurrency speech by former SEC Director of Corporation Finance, William Hinman.\n\nAccording to the documents released on August 3, 2023, \u201cJoseph Lubin and his company, Consensys, played a much more central role than previously known in driving then-SEC Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman\u2019s thinking and goals with his controversial June 14, 2018, cryptocurrency speech.\u201d This speech has been a point of contention in the Ripple case, especially as the SEC has since claimed that other similar cryptocurrencies, including XRP, were unregistered securities.\n\n\ud83e\uddf51. The @SECgov has now turned over 324 pages of new documents in response to our crypto conflicts FOIA requests. https://t.co/Axzz0cFyJF \u2014 Empower Oversight (@EMPOWR_us) August 3, 2023\n\n\n\nThe documents also reveal that \u201cLubin also appears to have been responsible for bringing Hinman and Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin together as the speech drafting advanced.\u201d Furthermore, investors and attorneys closely associated with Ethereum \u201cwere prominent on the list\u201d of a March 28, 2018, meeting on a crypto safe harbor proposal.\n\nThe documents also highlight a meeting between Hinman and Simpson Thacher partner Chris Lin, which was contrary to advice on conflicts of interest rules. The SEC Ethics Office had repeatedly warned Hinman since he was receiving millions of dollars in payments from Simpson Thacher while at the SEC.\n\nEmpower Oversight has been at the forefront of the battle for SEC transparency, filing numerous FOIA requests and lawsuits to compel the SEC to release documents related to its decision-making on cryptocurrency issues.\n\nXRP Army Reacts\n\nThe release of these documents has sparked a strong reaction from the XRP community, also known as the \u201cXRP army\u201d, which has been particularly vocal in their criticism of the SEC\u2019s handling of the situation.\n\nFred Rispoli, a lawyer at HODLaw, lauded Empower Oversight\u2019s efforts, tweeting, \u201cGreat job Empower Oversight. SEC never thought these docs would see the light of day\u2026\u201d\n\nDigital Asset Investor.XRP questioned the apparent double standards, tweeting, \u201cWhy was Bill Hinman doing backflips to accommodate Joseph Lubin and Vitalik Buterin while at the same time giving Brad Garlinghouse the run-around with the help of Jay Clayton and even coming back to the SEC after he left to make sure the Ripple lawsuit went through?\u201d\n\nRenowned XRP community member @Leerzeit went a step further, alleging misconduct at the SEC. \u201cYou are asking what the Inspector General did while he was watching Bill Hinman committing serious misconduct? Committing serious misconduct himself. The SEC is a criminal organization. There is just no way around it.\u201d\n\nCrypto Law founder, attorney John Deaton, highlighted the contradiction in Hinman\u2019s deposition during the Ripple lawsuit, where he claimed he had not communicated with anyone outside the SEC about the content of his speech.\n\nDeaton tweeted, \u201cRecall that Hinman said he never communicated with anyone outside the SEC about the content of the June 14 speech. However, the Hinman doc showed that he met with Buterin a week before his speech on cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nUndoubtedly, these revelations will intensify the ongoing debate about the SEC\u2019s handling of cryptocurrencies and its enforcement decisions. As the battle for transparency continues, the XRP army seemingly remains committed to holding the SEC accountable for its actions.\n\nAt press time, the XRP price was at $0.6577, holding just above the 200 EMA in the 4-hour chart.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TrdingView.com"

        "title": "Analysts expect 4x returns on Bitcoin, 6x returns on Ethereum, and 130x returns on Bitcoin Spark - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "The birth of Bitcoin gave rise to a new class of digital assets that have been attractive to enterprising individuals. Since the inauguration of Bitcoin, investors have shifted their focus to crypto projects to benefit from capital gains as these projects gain massive popularity for solving issues using the blockchain network. On average, Bitcoin offers an edge against inflation by giving \u2018above-average returns to investors. The cryptocurrency also offers a store of value where investors can temporarily keep their funds as they scout for investing opportunities in other financial markets. Analysts predict that Bitcoin will be 4x, Ethereum will be 6x, but Bitcoin Spark will surge 130x.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum Price Predictions\n\nBitcoin has been the largest cryptocurrency project in terms of market cap for the longest time. To date, it remains the most expensive digital currency. Experts predict that Bitcoin\u2019s value will be 4x, giving investors 400% gains. On the other hand, Ethereum is the largest altcoin ever to exist. The project was co-founded by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 after he and his team were inspired by the technology powering Bitcoin. Ethereum developers introduced smart contracts to blockchain technology, allowing other developers to develop decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nBitcoin Spark Promises to Outshine Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum are good investment ideas, more gains are usually revealed on incoming projects, start-ups, and ICOs. Investors have shifted their focus to an emerging Bitcoin hard fork project called Bitcoin Spark. Bitcoin Spark is on the verge of debuting with its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) phase 1 set to commence on the 1st of August, 2023. During this first phase, investors will purchase the token at an affordable price of $1.50 for every BTCS token. Additionally, the team will give a 20% bonus for all purchasing orders completed during this ICO phase to reward participants for early participation.\n\nThe launch price of BTCS after the final ICO phase is $10, representing an 800% gain for any purchase made during the first ICO. Bitcoin Spark, therefore, proves to be a better investment deal than Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Spark aims to solve challenges experienced by participants on the Bitcoin Network. The Bitcoin network has high transaction fees and low speeds. The network can only accommodate seven transactions per second (7 TPS), and gas fees sometimes exceed the transacted amount. The network also needs a smart contract bridge, a deficiency that greatly impairs its scalability. Bitcoin Spark developers are working on a smart contract bridge to allow developers to automate executions on the network.\n\nBitcoin uses a Proof of Work consensus mechanism to approve transactions and verify the addition of new blocks to the network. This model requires high-end computers and huge amounts of electricity. Ethereum uses the proof of stake, which has validators instead of miners.\n\nBitcoin Spark is introducing a new consensus technology called the Proof of Process verification method. This process combines Proof of Work and Proof of Stake. Participants on Bitcoin Spark\u2019s network can stake BTCS tokens, the ecosystem\u2019s native cryptocurrency, as well as mine it using their electronic devices.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Bitcoin Spark has a low entry barrier for miners. The team is developing software platforms compatible with Linux, Mac, iOS, Windows, and Android. Users will immediately start mining BTCS upon installing the software applications on their respective electronic devices. Bitcoin Spark also has revenue streams that will help the ecosystem grow. Since mining requires less processing power, companies and individuals will pay in BTCS to access the valuable processing power.\n\nAdditionally, advertisers will have a slot on the platform\u2019s mobile application and website where they must pay in BTCS to advertise to Bitcoin Spark users. The ads will be voted in or out through a decentralized framework by Bitcoin Spark\u2019s community members.\n\nFor more information:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nThis publication is sponsored.

        "title": "Ethereum is a 'ticking bomb' primed for 'spectacular run', says expert - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "This year, Ethereum (ETH) has been notably underperforming in comparison to Bitcoin (BTC), with its year-to-date gains lagging roughly 20% behind the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nNonetheless, a potential shift in circumstances offers a glimmer of hope. As market dynamics evolve and new developments emerge, Ethereum\u2019s trajectory may be poised for a transformation, according to crypto market experts.\n\nIn fact, ETH is a \u2018ticking bomb,\u2019 Glassnode co-founder known as Negentropic said on Twitter on August 3. The crypto guru acknowledged short-term risks for Ethereum; however, in the medium term, he sees the cryptocurrency as a golden opportunity.\n\nTime to shift from BTC to altcoins\n\nAccording to Negentropic, the ETH/BTC chart signals that better days may be coming for alternative assets, advising traders to make the shift.\n\n\u201cAccording to the ETHBTC trading pair, it\u2019s time to shift from BTC to altcoins.\u201d \u2013 Negentropic wrote.\n\nWhile Bitcoin may show strength in the short run, the expert explained, Ethereum is \u201cgearing up for a spectacular run!\u201d\n\nHis analysis of the ETH/BTC shows that the pair has been inking a series of lower highs since, and currently stands close to a 1-year low. This could serve as a potential reversal signal for Ethereum, and a possible breakout may be on the horizon.\n\nETHBTC chart. Source: Negentropic\n\nThe Ethereum to Bitcoin pair, often denoted as ETH/BTC, represents the exchange rate between ETH and BTC. In other words, it shows how many units of Bitcoin are needed to buy one unit of Ethereum.\n\nWhen ETH/BTC is trading low, it means that Ethereum\u2019s value is relatively weaker compared to Bitcoin, and it takes fewer units of Bitcoin to acquire one unit of Ethereum. This situation might indicate that Ethereum is underperforming or facing weaker demand compared to Bitcoin in the market.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nAt the time of publication on August 4, ETH was changing hands at $1,835, up 0.36% in the past 24 hours.\n\nOn a weekly chart, the crypto token is down more than 1.3% and over 5% on the month, similar to Bitcoin\u2019s 30-day drop.\n\nETH 1-month price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nYear-to-date, Ethereum gained around 53%, while BTC surged 75%.\n\nAnother metric that may suggest a resurgence in ETH is the recent growth in the blockchain network. Notably, the number of Ethereum addresses soared to 450,000 at the end of July, hitting the highest level in 2 years.\n\nThe blockchain witnessed 80,000 new address additions at the end of last month, according to Santiment data.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "12 Ethereum ETF Filings Await SEC's Green Light - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "In what can be seen as a significant trend in the crypto world, a total of 12 applications for Ethereum futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A series of filings from major players in the investment industry, including ProShares, Direxion, VanEck, Grayscale, Roundhill and Bitwise, await regulatory approval, potentially signaling a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency and traditional finance integration.\n\nJames Seyffart, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, is among the industry experts closely monitoring these filings. In a flurry of tweets, he outlined the current state of affairs, \u201cWe\u2019re at 12. Bitwise actually filed for two ETFs. Equal weight and market weight versions of their dual Bitcoin and Ethereum futures ETFs. We\u2019re up to a full dozen Ether futures ETF filings now.\u201d\n\nProShares, in particular, has shown immense interest, with four Ethereum ETF filings, including a Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF. \u201cThis is ProShares\u2019 fourth ETF with Ethereum futures,\u201d Seyffart confirmed. Generally, a weighted Bitcoin and Ethereum futures ETF seems to be a hot trend. Bitwise, Proshares and Direxion LETFs are among yesterday\u2019s filings with a dual BTC and ETH futures ETF.\n\nWill Ethereum ETFs Get The Green Light From The SEC?\n\nDespite the escalating interest and a flood of applications, industry analysts express skepticism about the chances of approval. \u201cMy base case is that these are withdrawn by the end of next week,\u201d Seyffart speculated, suggesting that the firms likely had these applications ready to submit and are prepared to withdraw them if needed.\n\nHe further explained, \u201cThe firms may think that the cost of submitting a filing off the shelf and withdrawing is minuscule, especially when compared to the cost of being days or weeks behind a competitor on a first-of-its-kind launch. I\u2019d say 75% chance these are withdrawn on gut instinct.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the prospective market demand, Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, also expressed reservations, \u201cBTC futures ETFs have < $1.5bil AUM & much of that came in first few days post-launch. Combined BTC + ETH futures ETFs are probably the best path to succeed for now IMO. Ultimately, investors want real deal spot ETFs.\u201d\n\nThe Ethereum futures ETFs filings follow a wave of applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs, which differ significantly in that spot ETFs require the issuer to purchase and hold the actual underlying asset. They are often considered more valid due to this inherent involvement in the cryptocurrency.\n\nElliott Stein, a litigation analyst, mused on a potential shift in the SEC\u2019s stance: \u201cIf the SEC loses its case against Grayscale, as we expect, the path of least resistance would be a wave of simultaneous approvals for all spot Bitcoin ETF applicants \u2013 including Grayscale and the other eight active filings.\u201d\n\nAs the crypto world awaits the SEC\u2019s decision, it\u2019s clear that the outcome could significantly affect the future landscape of crypto investments. With the evolution of financial instruments and increasing interest in digital assets, the approval of these Ethereum futures ETFs could serve as a turning point in the wider acceptance of cryptocurrencies in the traditional finance world.\n\nAt press time, the ETH price stood at $1,835.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "HashKey, a prominent Asian cryptocurrency exchange, will soon be offering its retail customers the option to trade in two of the most dominant digital currencies: Bitcoin and Ethereum, according to a report.\n\nThis move by HashKey comes after securing crucial regulatory clearances, positioning Hong Kong as a frontrunner in adopting and legitimizing cryptocurrency trading for retail investors.\n\nRegulatory Greenlight Spurs Crypto Trading\n\nHashKey has since been making significant strides forward in the crypto space. The journey began on August 3 when the firm, in tandem with OSL, achieved a milestone by receiving an enhanced license status. This advancement paved the way for exploring a broader spectrum of services.\n\nWith this newly acquired privilege to launch Bitcoin and Ethereum retail trading in Hong Kong, starting from August 28, the exchange is set to embark on a fresh chapter, catering to the retail segment of Hong Kong\u2019s investment community.\n\nThis decision helps local investors using HashKey\u2019s platform to diversify their portfolios, allocating up to 30% of their net assets into the world of digital currencies.\n\nThe exchange\u2019s leap into retail trading is supported by two crucial licenses sanctioned by Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).\n\nThe first, the Type 1 license, facilitates HashKey to launch a virtual asset trading platform compliant with Hong Kong\u2019s securities regulations.\n\nAccording to the report, the subsequent Type 7 license further empowers the platform to offer automated trading solutions to a broad audience, encompassing institutional and individual traders.\n\nA Prudent Approach To Retail Crypto Trading\n\nHashKey\u2019s Chief Operating Officer, Livio Weng, provided further insight into the exchange\u2019s strategy. Focused on serving retail investors\u2019 essentials, HashKey will initially offer trading options for Bitcoin and Ethereum only.\n\nWeng\u2019s rationale lies in the volatility associated with altcoins, emphasizing the need to present investors with tokens that are perceived to have relatively lower risks, especially in uncertain market conditions.\n\nTo diversify its reach and enhance accessibility, Weng disclosed that HashKey is collaborating with approximately 5 local Hong Kong brokerages. This partnership seeks to incorporate the exchange\u2019s crypto trading services within these brokerage platforms, attracting millions of existing stock traders in the region.\n\nTo streamline the trading experience, users can link their bank accounts, facilitating deposits in both Hong Kong and U.S. dollars.\n\nHowever, in line with regional policies and the broader crypto stance, HashKey has decided to restrict users from mainland China from accessing its services, aligning with China\u2019s 2021 mandate that banned crypto transactions.\n\nWeng remains optimistic about HashKey\u2019s retail venture. The firm aims to expand its user base from 500,000 to 1 million by the end of the year. According to Weng, if market conditions are favorable, HashKey could cater to 10 million users by 2025.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, Chart from TradingView"

        "content": "On Twitter, a bizarre story is circulating about an Ethereum developer who allegedly \u201caccidentally\u201d blocked 5 ETH (the equivalent of $9,000 at the time of writing) for 100 years in order to create his first TEST token. However, according to some, the story is being made public just to attract attention.\n\nEthereum: a developer accidentally blocks 5 ETH for 100 years\n\nTwitter is buzzing about the bizarre story of the Ethereum developer who allegedly accidentally blocked 5 ETH (or $9,000) for 100 years while working on the creation of his new TEST token.\n\nOn the 4chan forum, in fact, the developer allegedly created a post asking for help in creating his first ERC-20 token and blocking it. From there, then, the actual creation of TEST on the Ethereum mainnet took place.\n\nSoon after, a user would have suggested that the developer use UNCX Network, a protocol for blocking liquidity tokens.\n\nAnd so the developer allegedly decided to add 5 ETH and 1 billion TEST tokens as liquidity on Uniswap\u2019s DEX, receiving 70,700 LP tokens in return. These LP tokens can be redeemed for the underlying liquidity.\n\nAfter that, following the suggestion, the Ethereum developer would have locked his LP tokens, using the UNCX Network protocol, but putting 31 December 2123 as the expiration date.\n\nThis means that for 100 years, the tokens are no longer accessible and cannot be used to redeem the original ETH or the locked TEST tokens on Uniswap.\n\nEthereum: the story of the developer locking 5 ETH for 100 years crafted to attract attention\n\nAfter revealing that he had locked $9,000 in ETH for 100 years by posting related links, other 4chan forum users pointed out that the TEST token was growing.\n\nAnd indeed, TEST soared initially to $0.006, reaching a market cap of $6 million.\n\nSoon after, its price dropped to as low as $0.0014 with a market cap of $1.5 million.\n\nHowever, not all users are convinced of the \u201caccidental mistake\u201d of the developer of TEST. On the contrary, some reportedly questioned the whole affair, claiming that it was a move to attract attention.\n\nFirst among them, on 4chan, is a user who commented \u201cThis is not testnet ser,\u201d probably based on the idea that funds have been locked for too long. Then came the tweets that continued to spread skepticism about the story.\n\nThe price of ETH and its predictions\n\nThe spread of these stories among Ethereum developers, contribute in some way to talk about the smart contract crypto par excellence.\n\nAnd so, taking a look at the price of ETH, the monthly chart, shows that there is a slight bear market of the second largest crypto by market capitalization.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH is worth $1830. Far from the $2,022 touched on 14 July. Despite this slight drop in price, there are those who argue that for this second part of 2023, the situation will be different.\n\nIn fact, Finder recently published its prediction on the price of Ethereum, revealing that in 2023, ETH is expected to peak at $2,700, and then end the year around $2,400."

        "title": "Why Is ETH so Important in Crypto? - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Many cryptocurrencies used in the decentralized financial industry rely on Ethereum as their backbone technology. In addition, Ethereum\u2019s price is no longer strictly following Bitcoin\u2019s but rather is being propelled by its own triggers.\n\nEthereum has been around for 8 years now. However, a lot has transpired in the little period since its debut on July 30, 2015. Ethereum has become one of the most popular blockchain platforms, and its native token, a digital currency called Ethereum, has risen to become the second biggest cryptocurrency by market value and trading volume.\n\nETH and its Smart Contracts\n\nEthereum was created as a network for the execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications using its native currency, ether. Decentralized apps (DApps) like decentralized financial services (DeFi) or non-fungible tokens, or NFTs for short, began to develop and retain value thanks to the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s ability to execute smart contracts that fuel them.\n\nWhat are decentralized apps? Decentralized applications (or DApps) are smart contracts designed for persistent usage. In June of 2021, there were over 3,000 DApps running on Ethereum. That\u2019s more than has been deployed on all other blockchain platforms for mainstream use put together. Industry watchdog DappRadar estimated that by 2020, the biggest 10 DApps would have processed over 90% of all blockchain transactions.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price should surge due to the introduction of DeFi. Many cryptocurrencies used in the field of decentralized financial services are based on Ethereum; hence the term \u201cDeFi\u201d has become synonymous with Ethereum. Over 200k ERC tokens are hosted on Ethereum, including some of the top 100 biggest cryptocurrencies. DeFi is a platform that facilitates the exchange of assets, as well as the borrowing and lending of money, between individuals outside of the traditional banking system.\n\nRelationship ETH \u2013 BTC\n\nBoth the whole cryptocurrency market and ether are heavily influenced by the price of bitcoin. When the value of Bitcoin goes up or down, so does the value of ether. Since most DeFi projects are constructed on the Ethereum blockchain, their prices skyrocketed during the dramatic DeFi bubble that swept the market in the summer of 2020. In the wake of Bitcoin\u2019s late-2020 price surge, investors flipped their holdings from BTC to ETH, seeing the latter as a useful complement to Bitcoin as the former had become too \u201cexpensive.\u201d\n\nEther\u2019s price is no longer closely tracking Bitcoin\u2019s, as it is beginning to be influenced by its own factors.\n\nIs There a Difference Between ETH and Ethereum?\n\nEther may be used as a medium of exchange, an investment, or a store of value in the digital currency market. Ether (ETH) is a cryptocurrency that is stored and traded on the blockchain platform Ethereum. In addition to ETH transactions, this network facilitates a wide range of additional uses, as was previously described. The Ethereum network processes and stores the transaction data.\n\nData storage and distributed applications are two more uses for the Ethereum network. Hosting apps on the Ethereum blockchain is an alternative to using a server owned and controlled by a third party, like Google or Amazon, which would give that firm complete access to all of the data. Since there is no overarching administrator, users are free to share and utilize their data as they see fit inside the app.\n\nMethods to Acquire Ether\n\nChoose a crypto exchange or trading platform where you may buy and sell various cryptocurrencies. This is the simplest option if you just care about buying the most popular currencies, such as Bitcoin and Ether. Expect to pay a charge for processing or exchanging practically wherever you go.\n\nDeposit currency: To buy Ether, you may connect a debit card or bank account to your trading platform or deposit fiat currency like dollars.\n\nWhen you fund your account, you may buy Ether at the market price and invest in other assets. Once the coins have been deposited into your account, you have the option of keeping them, selling them, or exchanging them for other cryptocurrencies. It\u2019s important to remember that selling or trading cryptocurrency may subject you to taxation.\n\nEven while the default digital wallet provided by your trading platform is a convenient place to keep your Ether, doing so might be risky. Your coins are at risk if the exchange is hacked. If you don\u2019t intend to sell or trade your coins anytime soon, you may always move them to a different virtual wallet or an offline wallet that isn\u2019t linked to the internet.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn a nutshell, Ethereum (and ETH) has completely shaken up the cryptocurrency industry with its innovative smart contract framework and its decentralized application platform. Its development and popularity have been spurred, in large part, by its participation in DeFi as well as the huge range of DApps that are hosted on its platform.\n\nThe cryptocurrency ecosystem is constantly expanding, and Ethereum has emerged as a crucial support structure for the development of decentralized financial systems. In addition, the anonymity of transactions and the complete control that users have over their data make Ethereum an excellent and flexible option for the development of digital financial systems."

        "title": "Double Impact: Valkyrie Files To Convert BTF To Bitcoin And Ether ETF | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Asset management firm Valkyrie has moved to convert its Bitcoin Strategy exchange-traded fund (BTF) into a Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF.\n\nAccording to the firm\u2019s website, BTF is an actively managed exchange-traded fund (ETF) available through Nasdaq. BTF, which primarily invests in BTF futures contracts, represents one of Valkyrie\u2019s first endeavors in the Bitcoin derivative product markets.\n\nValkyrie Files 497 For Bitcoin, Ether Futures ETF: Bloomberg Analyst\n\nInvestopedia defines form 497 as a regulatory document that allows investment companies and mutual funds to submit their definitive materials in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC\u2019s) EDGAR (electronic data gathering, analysis, and retrieval) filing system.\n\nOn Friday, August 4, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas disclosed on X (formerly Twitter) that Valkyrie filed a form 497 to convert its BTF to a Bitcoin and Ether Futures ETF on October 3, 2023. This means that BTF \u2013 which was initially a Bitcoin Futures ETF only \u2013 would also include an Ether Futures ETF.\n\nBalchunas tagged the Valkyrie submission as the 14th Ether ETF application so far. He also noted that Valkyrie may be trying to outleap competition, as the firm\u2019s proposed date \u2013 October 3rd \u2013 is two weeks ahead of other applicants\u2019 scheduled launch.\n\nFurthermore, Balchunas likened this application to that of the first pot ETF, MJ, in 2017. At the time, ETF Managers Group (ETFMG) combined a new marijuana ETF with an existing ETF, the Tierra XP Latin America Real Estate ETF (LARE).\n\nAnother Bloomberg intelligence analyst James Seyffart called it a \u201cmassive\u201d move while admitting that it is still unclear how the ETF would work.\n\nIf approved, this would come as another advancement for Valkyrie, especially after the recent positives recorded on its spot Bitcoin ETF application.\n\nIn July, Bitcoinist reported that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission listed the asset management company in the Federal Register as an applicant for a spot Bitcoin ETF alongside seven other firms.\n\nValkyrie Joins 13 Other Ethereum ETF Filings For SEC Approval\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Valkyrie\u2019s latest filing represents the 14th Ether Futures ETF application. More than a dozen applications from major players, like ProShares, VanEck, Grayscale, and Bitwise, have already been submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nProShares specifically has exhibited great interest in the Ethereum Futures ETF, with four filings awaiting the SEC\u2019s approval. Notably, the company filed for an equal weight Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF in its 4th application.\n\nWhile there has been rising interest in Ethereum Futures ETF lately, many crypto analysts are not seeming too optimistic about its chances of being approved by the SEC.\n\n\u201cMy base case is that these are withdrawn by the end of next week. These firms probably had these on the shelf ready to go and just needed to re-submit them,\u201d James Seyffart mentioned in one of his posts.\n\nHowever, he also speculated that the applicants may have received some sort of signal from the SEC, as he believed most firms won\u2019t bother applying if they knew their chances were \u201czero or near zero\u201d.\n\nETHUSDT trading at $1,831.44 | Source: daily ETHUSDT chart from TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Bernard Marr, chart from TradingView"

        "title": "Bitcoin Spark starts at only 1 Dollar, and so did Bitcoin or Ethereum at one point in time - Blockzeit",
        "content": "Bitcoin Spark (BTCS) echoes the remarkable beginnings of some of the most renowned cryptocurrencies in existence today. As it begins the first steps of the crypto journey through its ICO, BTCS mirrors the early days of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin (BTC) began with humble origins and made Bitcoin millionaires, as did Ethereum too.\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin takes credit for pioneering cryptocurrency, and many investors think of BTC whenever there is a mention of cryptocurrency. True to this, many crypto projects revolve around Bitcoin\u2019s infrastructure, including wallets, exchanges, and blockchains. The BTC price was $1 in 2011, and a decade later, in 2021, it attained an ATH of $69,000. Bitcoin caps its maximum supply at 21 million, with the current circulating supply of 19 million, making it deflationary. BTC\u2019s price is currently hovering around $29,000 to $ 30,000.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum, the second largest crypto by market capitalization, started at $1 in 2015. ETH\u2019s price crossed the $10 milestone in March 2016 before achieving its ATH of $4,444 in Nov 2021. As the largest altcoin in existence, its goal is to address the scalability of Bitcoin through dApps and smart contracts. Like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the ETH price suffered a battering in 2022.\n\nBitcoin Spark (BTCS)\n\nWith all the buzz around the highly valuable Bitcoin, what if you could turn back time to when Bitcoin was only 1$? Bitcoin Spark, the revolutionary BTC fork, is giving you this chance by investing in the early stages of its ICO. Bitcoin Spark is a cutting-edge solution to the problems curtailing BTC from achieving the true Satoshi vision. Bitcoin\u2019s mining process is now a reserve of a few, risking detrimental collaborations and breaching decentralization.\n\nBitcoin Spark uses an all-new blockchain technology called \u201cProof-Of-Process\u201d (PoP), a moderated solution to PoS and Bitcoin\u2019s PoW. PoP introduces a combination of PoS and PoW mining power to solve Bitcoin\u2019s energy-intensive process and staking power. The system evenly distributes rewards by considering staked amounts and the mining power rental while considering the platform\u2019s revenue generation aspect. The system eases the barrier to entry, making it possible for anyone to mine.\n\nBTCS deploys a Bitcoin Spark application for computing power rental and reward distribution purposes. The app operates in a virtual environment, allowing users to rent computation power to those in need and earn rewards. The Bitcoin Spark team hopes to introduce software compatible with Android, Linux, Mac, iOs, and Windows devices. In addition, the computational power on the devices is self-adjusting, thereby ensuring security by limiting individual dominance.\n\nPoP\u2019s transaction validation is a four-layered strategy running on the BTCS application but with separate services. The execution layer algorithmically selects validators, ensuring all miners, regardless of transaction size, get an equal chance.\n\nBitcoin Spark launches ICO phase one at $1.50 on Aug 1. The early adopters will enjoy impressive 20% bonuses and an opportunity for 800% gains when BTCS launches at $10.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith a vision for inclusivity and equal growth opportunities, Bitcoin Spark seeks to revolutionize the digital currency concept, offering a promising investment opportunity to seasoned enthusiasts and newcomers. Its one-dollar entry point is a blessing in disguise to the early adopters who understand the hidden crypto gems.\n\nMore on Bitcoin Spark here:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register"

        "title": "Ethereum Founder Shares His Thoughts On Worldcoin's Proof Of Personhood - Blockzeit",
        "content": "The world of cryptocurrency has witnessed a recent grand debut on the OP Mainnet, as the Worldcoin project aims to revolutionize financial accessibility on a global scale. Notably, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has shared his intriguing thoughts on the project\u2019s unique approach to proof of personhood. Let\u2019s dive into his perspective, exploring his vision for a more secure and inclusive system of identity verification.\n\nWhat do I think about biometric proof of personhood?https://t.co/yozo1buW24 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) July 24, 2023\n\nUnderstanding Worldcoin\u2019s Three Pillars\n\nWorldcoin\u2019s ambitious vision revolves around three foundational pillars that fuel its ecosystem. These include:\n\nThe first is World ID, a privacy-preserving digital identity designed to empower individuals without compromising their personal information.\n\nSecond, the Worldcoin token (WLD) serves as a utility token granting users decision-making power over the project\u2019s direction.\n\nFinally, the World App is a platform dedicated to enabling seamless global payments and transfers, bridging gaps across borders.\n\nProof of Personhood: A Paradigm Shift in Identity Verification\n\nThe essay of the Ethereum founder eloquently addresses the pivotal concept of proof of personhood, the core component of Worldcoin\u2019s identity verification framework. In his analysis, he acknowledges that no single approach to proof of personhood is flawless and highlights three distinct paradigms, each with its strengths and weaknesses. These include:\n\nSpecialized-hardware biometrics\n\nGeneral-purpose biometrics\n\nSocial-graph-based systems\n\nEver wondered what \u201cProof of Personhood\u201d really means in the crypto world? ????????\n\n\n\nWe've got you covered with this handy infographic! ???? pic.twitter.com/dkFW6LDQtC \u2014 OKX (@okx) July 26, 2023\n\nBalancing Security and Decentralization\n\nWorldcoin\u2019s choice of specialized-hardware biometrics has drawn attention due to its secure scalability, but critics argue that it may compromise decentralization. To address this concern, Buterin suggests a system of accountability by holding individual Orbs \u2014 the hardware used for verifying unique personhood \u2014 responsible.\n\nWith that, he emphasizes the need for factors such as:\n\nCollaboration\n\nCombining multiple techniques to create the most effective\n\nReliable approach to proof of personhood\n\nPrivacy Matters: Emphasizing Transparency and Checks and Balances\n\nTransparency and privacy take center stage in Buterin\u2019s analysis. He commends the commitment of the teams operating these systems to ensure privacy, surpassing typical government or corporate-run identity solutions.\n\nTo further strengthen the system, Buterin advocates for open-source technology, third-party audits, and robust checks and balances, effectively mitigating potential vulnerabilities.\n\nCombatting Coercion: Safeguarding Against Abuse\n\nAddressing concerns of coercion in biometric proof-of-personhood systems, Buterin identifies various potential forms of coercion. These include the following examples:\n\nGovernment surveillance at border controls\n\nThreats to harm individuals\n\nThe creation of permanent records that follow individuals throughout their lives\n\nTo counter such abuse, he proposes making coercion more difficult to implement and detect. Innovative approaches like the Proof of Humanity method, which requires individuals to speak specific phrases during registration, may deter hidden scanning and blatant coercion.\n\nThe Path Forward: Fostering Inclusivity and Vigilance\n\nButerin remains optimistic about the potential value of proof-of-personhood systems, particularly in making identity verification accessible to those outside the crypto community. To achieve this, he emphasizes the importance of locking out hostile regimes while maintaining honesty in those considered medium-bad.\n\nCombining techniques and vigilance, Worldcoin or similar projects can play a pivotal role in shaping a more inclusive and secure world.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s analysis of Worldcoin\u2019s proof of personhood presents a visionary perspective on transforming identity verification in the cryptocurrency landscape. By embracing collaboration, emphasizing privacy and transparency, and combating coercion, the crypto community can unlock the full potential of proof of personhood, fostering a more inclusive and decentralized financial future."
