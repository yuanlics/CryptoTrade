Discover SCENE\n\n\u201cI think if we want Bitcoin to be more than payments, it needs more scaling solutions,\u201d said Vitalik Buterin, on a Twitter Spaces this week, pointing to several experiments that Ethereum has been trying out over the past years.\n\nBut the main problem, for him, is politics.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has really weird politics,\u201d he said, adding that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t vibe with them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOver 32,000 people tuned in to listen as the Ethereum inventor talked with \"altcoin slayer\" Eric Wall and Bitcoin developer Udi Wertheimer about what Bitcoiners can learn from Ethereum.\n\nThe trio tackled one of the main pain points of the world's biggest cryptocurrency by market cap: Bitcoin's slow transaction throughput, and thus the need for layer two scaling approaches to increase the speed at which people can send and receive the digital asset.\n\nThe majority of the discussion revolved around scaling, which is where Buterin, Wall, and Wertheimer think Bitcoiners could learn the most from the presumed rival chain.\n\n\u201cI think if we want Bitcoin to be more than just payments, it will need scaling options like Plasma or ZK Rollups,\u201d said Buterin, both of which have been tried on Ethereum. Optimism and Arbitrum are two successful examples of \u201crollups\u201d that could serve as case studies for Bitcoin, he said, adding that it would \u201cbe good to have an open mind\u201d with regards to ZK-snark based solutions\u2014indicating a clear preference.\n\nEthereum has been experimenting with a wide variety of scaling solutions over the years, and is in the process of its latest update, EIP-4844, which introduces blob blocks\u2013enabling up to 100,000 transactions per second.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWall pushed the idea that Bitcoin should be studying these trials, fearing that the ecosystem will be left with less secure rollups. Buterin responded that the proposal will likely draw \u201ccontroversy with security hawks.\u201d\n\nWall, who has been taking center stage as of late with the Taproot Wizards, brought up Bitcoin\u2019s security model, and the 21 million hard cap. It\u2019s a question that Buterin said he has grappled with, although he pointed to Ordinals as providing a reasonable fee market to cover the reducing block subsidies as well as subsequent security concerns.\n\nButerin also thinks Ordinals have brought a \u201creturn to builder culture\u201d which in his words \u201cis very good.\u201d He added that he \u201cdefinitely see signs of hope now that we have Ordinals,\u201d calling them a \u201creal pushback to laser eyed maximalism.\u201d\n\nButerin also tried to find ten things that both ecosystems shared. He pointed to claims of immutability by both chains, along with the fact they both have issues with layer-1 privacy. Buterin also mentioned that both Ethereum and Bitcoin have showcased how difficult it is to do things in decentralized consensus models.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder ended on a rather optimistic note, trying possibly to bring together both communities.\n\n\u201cI think a world where there is at least one of these chains is better than one with none,\u201d he concluded."

        "content": "Coin Bureau host Guy Turner is listing two catalysts that could potentially trigger a bullish run for Ethereum (ETH).\n\nIn a new video, Turner tells Coin Bureau\u2019s 2.28 million subscribers that two upcoming milestones could send \u201ccould send ETH\u2019s price higher.\u201d\n\nAccording to Turner, one of the milestones is the proto-danksharding upgrade.\n\n\u201cThe biggest upcoming milestone for Ethereum is the EIP-4844 upgrade which is colloquially referred to as proto-danksharding. The reason why proto-dank sharding is a big deal is because it will basically allow Ethereum to reach a level of scalability that\u2019s comparable with centralized computer systems. This will be achieved by addressing Ethereum\u2019s main bottleneck to scalability which is data availability\u2026\n\nProto-danksharding solves this by making it possible for special blobs of data to exist on the Ethereum blockchain. These blobs make transaction data more readily available which should increase Ethereum scalability, lower its fees and increase transaction speeds on its layer-2s.\u201d\n\nThe Coin Bureau host further says that the second upcoming milestone for Ethereum is an effort to enhance privacy.\n\n\u201cBesides proto-danksharding, Ethereum developers have apparently been hyper-focused on privacy.\n\nBack in January, [Ethereum creator] Vitalik [Buterin] penned a blog post where he referred to privacy as \u2018one of the largest remaining challenges\u2019 in the Ethereum ecosystem and proposed stealth addresses as one solution.\n\nIn April, privacy on Ethereum came into the spotlight again because of supposed privacy concerns related to ETH staking.\n\nJust last month, Vitalik penned another blog post where he noted privacy as being one of the \u2018three transitions that Ethereum must implement or else it will fail.\u2019\n\nThe sudden focus on privacy is not all that surprising when you realize that institutional investors want privacy more than anyone else. And remember that the Shappella upgrade has increased institutional interest in ETH.\u201d\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nIn a recent video, Guy Turner, the host of Coin Bureau, has captivated the attention of Coin Bureau\u2019s 2.28 million subscribers by unveiling two key catalysts that could potentially ignite a powerful bullish run for Ethereum (ETH). These upcoming milestones hold the promise of driving ETH\u2019s price to new heights.\n\nProto-dank sharding upgrade\n\nThe first milestone highlighted by Turner is the eagerly anticipated proto-dank sharding upgrade, officially known as EIP-4844. This groundbreaking upgrade seeks to address Ethereum\u2019s long-standing scalability challenge, allowing the network to achieve a level of scalability comparable to centralized computer systems.\n\nBy tackling Ethereum\u2019s primary bottleneck\u2014data availability\u2014proto-dank sharding introduces special blobs of data that enhance transaction data accessibility. This boost in scalability is expected to result in lower fees, faster transaction speeds on layer-2 solutions, and an overall improvement in Ethereum\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cThe biggest upcoming milestone for Ethereum is the EIP-4844 upgrade\u201d\n\nEnhancing Privacy, Post ETH Staking?\n\nTurner then turns the spotlight to Ethereum\u2019s renewed focus on privacy, marking it as the second significant milestone. Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin has openly acknowledged privacy as one of the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s major challenges. To tackle this issue, Ethereum developers have been diligently exploring solutions, such as the implementation of stealth addresses.\n\nThe recent attention to privacy has been further intensified by the Shappella upgrade, which has sparked increased interest from institutional investors. Recognizing the growing demand for privacy from these investors, Ethereum aims to deliver enhanced privacy features that align with their requirements.\n\nWith these two powerful catalysts on the horizon, Ethereum\u2019s potential for a remarkable price surge is gaining momentum. As Ethereum continues to address critical challenges and push the boundaries of innovation, investors and enthusiasts eagerly anticipate the impact these developments will have on the cryptocurrency\u2019s value."

Since their launch, Ordinals have been creating a stir in the Bitcoin community, setting record numbers of inscriptions on multiple occasions.\n\nApart from Bitcoin's Ordinals and Ethereum's NFTs, several other blockchains have also made significant strides in the NFT market. Solana holds the third spot, showing robust sales growth of 44.61% with total sales of $1.2 million and attracting 31.40% of buyers, a number that surpasses even Ethereum's buyer market share.\n\nPolygon follows closely behind in the fourth position, with a sales increase of 30.75% amounting to $1.3 million.

While this groundbreaking event garnered much attention, there\u2019s another metric steadily ascending in the background, silently shaping the future trajectory of ETH with great potential impact.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nEthereum new addresses surge\n\nAmidst the focus on Ethereum\u2019s staking and price trends, it\u2019s easy to overlook other crucial metrics. However, recent Santiment data sheds light on a quietly surging aspect: the network\u2019s remarkable growth.\n\nThe data indicated a consistent influx of new users joining the network, signaling potential market cap expansion.\n\nA closer examination of the chart revealed that over 580,000 new addresses were created between 1 July and 7 July alone. This remarkable surge further highlighted the underlying strength and promising trajectory of ETH.\n\nETH on exchanges decline\n\nAccording to the latest data from Coin Market Cap, Ethereum held an impressive 19% of the total cryptocurrency market cap. With this, it secured its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency, surpassed only by Bitcoin [BTC], which claimed over 49%. Despite ETH\u2019s market dominance, ETH holders actively withdrew their holdings from exchanges.\n\nSantiment\u2019s chart revealed that the supply of Ethereum on exchanges, relative to the total supply, stood at a mere 9.1%. This suggested that less than 10% of all ETH remained on exchanges, while the majority had been moved to other storage methods.\n\nFurther analysis of the chart revealed that approximately 11.3 million ETH was being held on exchanges at press time, indicating a visible decline. This withdrawal trend underscored the growing preference among Ethereum holders for alternative storage solutions.\n\nAlso, it reflected their confidence in the long-term value of their holdings.\n\nEthereum price declines as TVL dominates\n\nAccording to data from DefiLlama, Ethereum maintained its position as the leading blockchain in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL), compared to other chains. As of this writing, the total TVL across all chains was $44 billion, with Ethereum commanding over $26 billion.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nThis meant that Ethereum held more than half of the entire TVL in the market, showcasing its dominant presence in decentralized finance.\n\nHowever, ETH has experienced a recent decline. Nevertheless, there were signs of a potential recovery as of this writing. Ethereum was trading at approximately $1,864, showing a modest increase of almost 1% from its previous value."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nProto-danksharding is going to completely change Ethereum\u2014and for the better, says core developer Mario Havel.\n\nAt ETH Barcelona over the weekend, Havel told Decrypt that the next big Ethereum upgrade, dubbed \"Dencun,\" is nearing the \"final stages of planning.\" The upgrade will do many things, but one of the major changes is the introduction of the proto-danksharding feature, which will allow the network to scale and handle up to 100,000 transaction per second, devs say.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the focus right now is on the implementation of EIP-4844, also known as proto-danksharding,\u201d Havel explained. According to the core developer, EIP-4844 sets the foundation for data sharding through the introduction of a new transaction type\u2014the oddly named \u201cdata blob.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlob blocks also introduce what\u2019s called a KZG commitment. The name stands for Kate-Zaverucha-Goldberg, the names of the original authors who came up with it.\n\nAccording to Havel, the KZG commitment will point to certain \u201cblobs\u201d of information. That's helpful for layer-2 scaling solutions, like Optimism and Arbitrum, because they batch transactions together in what are known as \"rollups\" and currently have issues accessing data needed to verify those transactions.\n\nThe easier it is for a rollup to access the data it needs, the faster and cheaper the transactions can be verified and reported back to the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nAccording to Carl Beekhuizen and Trent van Epps, two members of the Ethereum Foundation who are working on proto-danksharding, the blobs set the foundation for data sharding.\n\nOn the Epicenter Podcast earlier this year, they clarified the idea, saying that instead of having multiple simultaneous sidechains, there is only one chain but with \u201ccrazy\u201d amounts of information.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe data can then get split up on the one chain, allowing for individual stakers or smaller sized machines to be responsible only for a sliver of that large amount of information. And, says Havel, that data will only be stored for a few weeks at a time.\n\nKZG commitments are at the end of their \u201cKZG summoning ceremony,\u201d or a \u201cmulti party computation ceremony,\u201d said Havel, which calls upon the community to help with the scaling effort.\n\nHavel also explained that blobs will only store data for a limited amount of time, and will never touch the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the environment where all smart contracts live and interact with one another, nor the Ethereum state directly.\n\n\u201cInstead, they will create a KZG commitment, which will allow us to handle data much more efficiently and in a much cheaper way,\u201d he explained, given the fact that blobs are small enough that they make disk use manageable.\n\nHavel explained that blobs will only store data for a limited amount of time, and will never touch the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). \u201cWe will be able to handle data much more efficiently, and in a cheaper way as well,\u201d he concluded.\n\nAdditional reporting by Rodrigo Martinez."

        "title": "Shibarium to Launch in August: What This Means for $SHIB - Ethereum World News",
        "content": "Shiba Inu enthusiasts are eagerly anticipating the upcoming launch of Shibarium. The Layer 2 solution designed for the Shiba Inu ecosystem.\n\nShibarium is anticipated to have a significant impact on reducing gas fees on the Shiba Inu network ultimately making it more accessible and affordable for users. This development has attracted investors who are already showing interest in SHIB prior to the Shibarium launch over recent weeks.\n\nThe price of SHIB has been steadily rising and was trading as high as $0.0000085 according to TradingView. Experts predict that following the Shibarium launch there is a possibility that the price could even reach $0.0000100, if not higher.\n\nThe Shibarium launch is scheduled to take place in August 2023; although an exact date hasn\u2019t been disclosed yet. Developers assure that they remain on track with their schedule.\n\nOnce Launched Shibarium will mark a significant milestone for the Shiba Inu ecosystem by introducing improved scalability and efficiency for better user interaction with the network. Consequently this highly anticipated event is also expected to positively influence SHIBs price and potentially lead to wider token adoption. The following are key benefits associated with Shibarium:\n\n1) Reduced gas fees: By implementing a proof of stake consensus mechanism instead of Ethereums current proof of work mechanism. Shibarium will substantially lower gas fees on the Shiba Inu network.\n\n2) Increased scalability: Compared to Ethereum. Shibarium will be capable of processing a higher number of transactions per second. This enhancement will greatly improve scalability and overall efficiency for the Shiba Inu network.\n\n3) Enhanced user experience: With reduced gas fees and increased scalability provided by Shibarium users will find it more convenient and cost effective to interact within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. The much anticipated launch of Shibarium is undoubtedly poised to be a major catalyst within the Shiba Inu community.\n\nFurther driving growth and development in the ecosystem. The launch of Shibarium is an important development for the Shiba Inu ecosystem. By making the network more scalable, efficient and user friendly it has the potential to increase adoption of the token and raise the price of SHIB. However. It is important to be aware of the risks associated with this project.\n\nThere is a possibility that the project could be delayed or canceled despite the good track record of the Shibarium developers. Additionally, there is always a risk that the project may not meet expectations or could be vulnerable to hacking. If hacking were to occur, it could negatively impact the reputation of the Shiba Inu ecosystem and potentially cause a decline in SHIBs price."

        "title": "Ethereum's price target $2K! Wall Street Memes will hit $14M first! - Augusta Free Press",
        "content": "After a long and difficult period, it seems that Ethereum ($ETH) is finally ready for a recovery. $ETH has finally started to show chances for approaching the long-desired value of $2000, which is fantastic news for all those who have either invested in $ETH or are planning to do so. But the question arises: how long will it take for Ethereum to reach this value?\n\nWill Ethereum reach this value soon or will some other coins manage to reach their milestones faster? And what can we expect first: that $ETH reaches $2000 or, for example, that the much younger Wall Street Memes ($WSM) reaches the $14 million milestone? Let\u2019s see which one of these two cryptos, according to the analysis of the experts, shows chances for faster success!\n\nBuy Wall Street Memes Now!\n\nEthereum ($ETH) is approaching the long-desired value of $2,000!\n\nAfter a long and challenging period that befell the entire crypto world, one of the most famous cryptocurrencies, Ethereum ($ETH), finally started to show an upward trend. Although Ethereum did not \u201csuffer\u201d to the extent that some other cryptos did, it is still a fact that this crypto also faced problems and that in the previous period, it experienced quite a price drop.\n\nBut it seems the summer is bringing Ethereum a noticeable improvement. In mid-June, $ETH started to experience value growth and managed to bring its value to $1,951.71. This jump in value has made investors wonder if and when $ETH could reach the long-desired $2000. Crypto experts believe that $ETH could reach this value at the end of the year, to be more precise, in December. So, for Ethereum to reach $2K, it will take several months.\n\nThe fact that the further development of this crypto will happen slowly, has \u201cforced\u201d investors to look for another crypto which is predicted to achieve success much faster. And just one look at the situation in the crypto world is enough to find such a coin. It is, of course, Wall Street Memes ($WSM), currently the most popular meme coin that will manage not only to raise a fantastic $14 million but also very likely to complete its presale, far before Ethereum manages to reach the aforementioned $2K. So let\u2019s see what makes Wall Street Memes ($WSM) so special!\n\nWall Street Memes ($WSM): An unstoppable meme coin that is set for massive gains!\n\nYou may be wondering what has influenced the lightning success of the Wall Street Memes ($WSM) presale, and the growing demand for $WSM tokens.\n\nFirst of all, the success that the creators of this meme coin achieved in 2021 is \u201cresponsible\u201d for the initial interest of investors during the first days of the Wall Street Memes ($WSM) presale. It could be said that then the Wall Street Memes \u201cbrand\u201d was established. Then, the creators of this meme coin managed to sell out their Wall St Bulls NFT collection in just 32 minutes. Therefore, the initial interest of users is certainly partly based on that.\n\nBut now, it seems that the user\u2019s interest in investing in this meme coin is based on the predictions of experts, who are convinced that $WSM is the next 100X coin! According to their analysis, thanks to the huge Wall Street Memes community (which has more than an incredible million members), $WSM will manage to secure a place in the top-tier crypto exchanges! And that, of course, will leave a positive effect on the further increase in the value of the $WSM tokens.\n\nNot only is it predicted that $WSM will achieve massive gains and thus bring profit to all early investors, but 30% of the token supply will be reserved for rewarding the community, which is an additional plus, and an additional incentive for everyone to join the Wall Street Memes ($WSM) presale as soon as possible!\n\nFrom the first day of the presale, it seemed that the $WSM token was unstoppable, and as the presale goes on, as the interest in this meme coin grows, and as its community becomes bigger and bigger, that seems to be true. So grab this meme coin in time. The earlier you join the presale, the better!\n\nBuy Wall Street Memes Now!\n\nDon\u2019t miss the opportunity to join the Wall Street Memes ($WSM) presale!\n\nAt this moment, Wall Street Memes ($WSM) can boast of more than $13 million raised, which means that it is approaching the next milestone with sure steps. So, it\u2019s a matter of time before 14 million will be raised, but also, if such great interest continues, it\u2019s a matter of the day when the presale will be completed!\n\nThe end of the Wall Street Memes ($WSM) presale can be expected after a bit more than $14.5 million is raised, and as things stand, that is very likely to happen very soon. So, don\u2019t waste your time, use these last moments to join the Wall Street Memes ($WSM) presale!\n\nNow you have a unique opportunity to invest in $WSM at a price of only $0.031! Already during the next presale phase, the price of the $WSM token will jump to $0.0313. So, don\u2019t wait for the price to go up, but grab this coin ASAP!\n\nBuy Wall Street Memes Now\n\nConclusion\n\nThe chances of Ethereum ($ETH) reaching $2000 exist. But, according to crypto experts, we will most likely witness this at the end of the year. On the other hand, much sooner, another crypto will be able to achieve much more significant success, and not only reach the $14 million milestone but certainly complete its presale, get listed on top-tier exchanges and achieve massive gains! So, for now, put Ethereum aside, and turn your attention and your funds to promising Wall Street Memes ($WSM), a meme coin that will shine in full glory for days and months to come!"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTron Founder Justin Sun is in the headlines today after his latest on-chain transaction was brought to life. According to insights shared by crypto sleuth Lookonchain, Justin Sun transferred a total of 23,000 ETH worth approximately $43 million to Poloniex. While the purpose of the transfer remains unknown, there has been growing speculation from crypto Twitter.\n\nPotential reasons for funds movement\n\nJustin Sun owns the Poloniex exchange and, as a crypto founder with many top Web3.0 companies in his portfolio, the recent funds movement, which is not uncommon with him, can mean a lot of things. First, Justin Sun may set his eyes on gradual liquidation to take advantage of the recent bouts of price surges that Ethereum has experienced over the past few months.\n\nAccording to an extensive review of the associated wallet address, it was discovered that Justin Sun is a functional trader in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem, partaking in a series of staking activities from which he earns regular rewards. As a platform that supports staking, part of the reason for moving the funds to Poloniex might be to also stake it there as he has a record of doing this.\n\nAnother plausible reason is to cushion liquidity on the Poloniex exchange. With Justin Sun's direct oversight on the trading platform, ensuring there is enough liquidity to fulfill all customers' orders is essential, and this funds movement can be directed to this purpose.\n\nJustifiable fears?\n\nJustin Sun is undeniably a market whale with large holdings of different digital currencies beyond Ethereum. While the recent moves with respect to the Ethereum transfer have sparked fear of a possible sell-off, the fear of a sell-off might be unjustified.\n\nThis is because the total sum of the funds might not make a dent in the Ethereum market, which boasts a market capitalization of over $224 billion. Should Justin Sun choose to sell off the quoted ETH tokens, the impact on the market may not be as grievous as is being projected."

        "content": "Justin Sun, the renowned crypto entrepreneur and founder of Tron Blockchain, has once again made waves in the cryptocurrency world with a substantial transfer of Ethereum (ETH) tokens. In a recent transaction, reported by Lookonchain, Sun transferred a staggering 23,000 ETH, equivalent to approximately $43 million, to the popular cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex.\n\nJustin Sun ETH Transfer\n\nThe transfer of 23,000 ETH, worth $43 million, adds to Justin Sun\u2018s impressive track record of moving large amounts of Ethereum to Poloniex. Sun\u2019s ETH balance currently stands at 163.35 ETH, held in the wallet address 0x3DdfA8eC3052539b6C9549F12cEA2C295cfF5296.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn addition to the recent transfer of 23,000 ETH to Poloniex, it is worth highlighting some previous notable transfers made by Justin Sun. One significant transaction occurred in December when Sun sent 6,500 ethers to the same exchange. Coincidentally, following this transfer, the price of Ethereum experienced a drop from $1,350 to approximately $1,151 in the subsequent days.\n\nAnother substantial transfer took place on January 25th of this year when Sun moved another 10,000 units of ETH to Poloniex. Over the past year, he has sent a total of 67,500 ETH, amounting to a whopping $126 million, in seven separate transactions.\n\nAlso Read: Liquidity Crunch Hits Crypto, Bitcoin and Ethereum Face Buy-Side Decline\n\nWill it Impact Eth Price?\n\nSun\u2019s transfer may be part of a routine derisking strategy as a long-term holder. Such strategies involve diversifying one\u2019s holdings or reducing exposure to a specific asset. Moreover, it is possible that Sun\u2019s transfer to Poloniex serves a dual purpose, providing liquidity to the exchange while also supporting its operations during a period of decreased liquidity in exchanges.\n\nThis transfer comes on the heels of Justin Sun\u2019s withdrawal of $29.7 million worth of ETH from the liquid staking platform Lido Finance last month. Following the withdrawal, Sun promptly sent the tokens to Huobi, another prominent crypto exchange.\n\nIn addition to his involvement with Ethereum, Sun has recently made headlines with the announcement of Tron\u2019s foray into the Ethereum blockchain through the innovative BitTorrent bridge. At the press time, the price of Ethereum (ETH) is $1,861.62. The 24-hour low and high for Ethereum are $1,854.06 and $1,876.96, respectively."

Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nEchoing last week, the values of market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum remained pretty inert over the past seven days.\n\nNonetheless, market leader Bitcoin (BTC) hit a one-year high after crossing the $31,000 threshold on Monday on news that the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, was refiling its application to the SEC for a Bitcoin spot ETF\u2014a regulated investment vehicle that, if approved, would provide investors with exposure to Bitcoin without the dangers of buying it directly.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe SEC expressed misgivings about BlackRock\u2019s first filing last month, stating broadly that none of the many applicants for a Bitcoin spot ETF have been specific enough about how they'll integrate a \"surveillance-sharing agreement\" to deter fraud and manipulation. Such an agreement would allow applicants to monitor market trading activity and clearing activity and verify customer identity.\n\nBlackRock named Coinbase as its market surveillance partner in its refiling. Two days later, the crypto-focused asset manager Valkyrie also refiled its ETF application and, echoing BlackRock, it named Coinbase as its market surveillance partner.\n\nIn another bullish sign for Bitcoin fans, the crypto ATM operator Bitcoin Depot became the first company of its kind to be publicly listed on the NASDAQ on Monday.\n\nHowever, the headlines weren\u2019t enough to turn Bitcoin\u2019s upward price movement into a sustained rally. The biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization dropped back under $31,000 on Tuesday, then briefly recrossed the threshold early on Thursday before bottoming out at $30,153.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s volatility settled down by the weekend. It currently changes hands at $30,252\u2014about one percent lower than it was this time last week.\n\nEthereum (ETH) holders suffered marginally greater losses. The second biggest cryptocurrency in the world dropped in value 2.8% to enter the weekend at $1,861. It moved in step with Bitcoin, posting intraweek highs of close to $2,000 on Monday and Thursday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe prices of most of the top thirty cryptocurrencies remained flat over the last seven days. The biggest growth was observed in Solana (SOL), which exploded 20% to hit $22.85 by Saturday, up nearly 20% for the week.\n\nRemarkably, Solana thrived in spite of news that popular trading app Revolut is delisting it\u2014along with Polygon (MATIC) and Cardano (ADA)\u2014after they were named as securities by the SEC in its ongoing lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase.\n\nBig losses were felt by holders of Litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). The former dropped 11% to $98, while the latter dropped 12.5% to $19.06.\n\nEthereum forked from Ethereum Classic in 2016 after an infamous DAO smart contract hack enabled thieves to abscond with $55 million in ETH. The Ethereum community voted to have the illicit transactions wiped from the blockchain and continued under the name Ethereum. The original ledger recording these transactions continued as Ethereum Classic.\n\nRegulation in Asia and the UK\n\nOn Monday, Singapore announced two new consumer protection measures as the island nation\u2019s regulators continued to build a regulatory framework for its burgeoning crypto industry.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)\u2014the country\u2019s chief financial regulator\u2014will enforce a ban on lending and staking for retail customers (individual traders, as opposed to institutional clients).\n\nThe MAS now also requires that exchanges move customers\u2019 digital assets into a trust before the end of the year to prevent an FTX-style scenario where their funds are commingled or traded.\n\nCoincidentally, Thailand\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission also announced a ban on \u201cdepository services that offer returns to depositors and lenders,\u201d thus outright banning exchanges from offering both lending and staking services.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn the other side of the globe on Tuesday, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for the United Kingdom announced that companies promoting cryptocurrencies to UK customers must get ready to comply with the regulator\u2019s financial promotion regime before October 8, 2023.\n\nThe rules govern all communications that can be regarded as \u201cfinancial promotion,\u201d including websites, social media posts, mobile apps, and online advertising. Crypto companies will need to register with the FCA to get authorization and, if approved, they\u2019ll also need to pay a fee."

        "title": "Ethereum Node Locations Raise Concerns About US Government Involvement | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Ethereum is currently the largest proof of stake (P0S) network after transitioning from a proof of work (PoW) mechanism late last year. This means that the network now uses validators to carry out transactions as opposed to miners using energy-intensive computers to solve complex mathematical problems to do the same thing \u2013 something that has been applauded as a step in the right direction by many in the space.\n\nHowever, the location of Ethereum nodes worldwide, particularly their concentration in a particular location, has raised concerns among participants after a Twitter user pointed out a disturbing fact.\n\nMore Than 50% Of Ethereum Nodes Are In The United States\n\nOn Sunday, a Twitter user that goes by Hamzah Khan made a post revealing that over 50% of Ethereum\u2019s nodes are being hosted in datacenters in the United States.\n\nThere are currently about 5,500 nodes running Ethereum, and about half are based in the US. Of these, over half are in a single data center in Virginia, 20 minutes away from the white house and the CIA headquarters. FUD Morning \ud83d\ude4f \u2014 Hamzah Khan (@_khanhamzah) July 9, 2023\n\nMore interestingly though was that of this massive share of the node distribution being hosted in the country, more than 50% were being hosted in a single datacenter.\n\nThe location of this particular datacenter was of the most interest. The datacenter which is located in the state of Virginia is reportedly only 20 minutes away from the headquarters of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as well as the White House.\n\nNow, while the location has been pointed out, it shows no participation of the US government in the running of Ethereum. Rather, as the Ether.fi website points out, it shows that Ethereum is not as decentralized as participants would like.\n\nETH price falls below $1,900 support | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nAdditionally, Mike Silagadze, CEO of Ether.fi, also responded to the tweet to clarify that the number of nodes on its website needed to be updated. Compared to the 5,500 on the website, Silagadze said there were now around 6,800 Ethereum nodes running. But as another Twitter user pointed out, it doesn\u2019t change the \u2018distribution\u2019 of the nodes already pointed out above.\n\nThe Rise Of Liquid Staking\n\nBecoming a validator on Ethereum carries a high barrier to entry because valuators are required to have a total of 32 ETH. At current prices, this translates to around $60,000 to run a single validator node. And since a large percentage of users cannot afford this, liquid staking protocols have seen a lot of success for the services they offer.\n\nLiquid staking protocols such as Lido Finance and Rocket Pool allow investors to still become validators even if they don\u2019t have up to 32 ETH. Users are able to pool their ETH together to make a validator. This way, they are able to earn rewards without operating a full node themselves.\n\nLido leads ETH liquid staking | Source: DeFiLlama\n\nOver the last year, protocols such as Lido Finance have seen sharp growth, propelling them to the forefront of ETH staking. Currently, there is over $14 billion staked on the Lido liquid staking protocol, accounting for around 30% of the total staked ETH. In total, liquid staking now accounts for more than 37% of the total staked ETH, and rising.\n\nThis growth was born out of the need for more decentralization in the Ethereum network as nodes become more spread out. However, despite the rise in liquid staking, Ethereum nodes are still highly concentrated, mainly in the United States."

        "title": "How to Take Advantage of Ethereum Flippening Bitcoin in the Next Bullrun - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is filled with excitement and speculation as investors and enthusiasts eagerly await the next bull run. Within this context, the concept of \u201cFlippening\u201d has garnered significant attention. The Flippening refers to the hypothetical event in which Ethereum (ETH) surpasses Bitcoin (BTC) as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin have long been the pillars of the crypto world, capturing the imagination and investments of millions. While Bitcoin has held its dominant position since its inception, Ethereum has been steadily gaining ground, fueled by its unique features and expanding ecosystem.\n\nIn June 2017, Ethereum experienced its highest level of dominance in the crypto market, reaching 25.32%. This period coincided with the golden age of initial coin offerings (ICOs) when numerous projects launched altcoins on the Ethereum protocol.\n\nOn June 12, 2017, the market capitalization of ETH was nearly 84% of that of Bitcoin (BTC), with just $7.16 billion separating the two, as per TradingView data. Currently, that figure stands at approximately 38%, indicating a significant change in the relative market positions of ETH and BTC. A dominance level above 100% suggests a \u201cflippening,\u201d where ETH surpasses BTC in market capitalization.\n\nFlippening Metrics\n\nFlippening metrics refer to indicators used to analyze the potential shift in dominance between Ethereum and Bitcoin, specifically regarding market capitalization and other relevant factors. While market capitalization is the primary metric used to gauge the Flippening, several other metrics provide insights into this phenomenon.\n\nActive addresses\n\nActive addresses represent the unique addresses involved in sending or receiving transactions within a specific period. However, due to differences in address usage patterns between Ethereum and Bitcoin, this metric can disadvantage Ethereum, as users/ contracts frequently reuse their addresses.\n\nAccording to BlockchainCentre, the active address Flipenning is at 52%.\n\nTransaction count\n\nTransaction count is another crucial metric, measuring the total number of on-chain transactions on the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks. If Ethereum surpasses Bitcoin in this metric, it indicates a higher transaction activity. Ethereum has flipenned Bitcoin on the Transaction count metric.\n\nTransactions volume\n\nTransaction volume is the total value of USD transferred over the network, explicitly comparing Ethereum transfers with Bitcoin transfers. It\u2019s important to note that Ethereum\u2019s volume may exceed 100% when considering additional token transfers, as Ethereum supports a broader range of tokens. According to BlockchainCentre, the transaction volume flipenning is at 71%.\n\nTrading volume\n\nTrading volume reflects the adjusted exchange trading volume for Bitcoin and Ethereum, providing insights into the trading activity and liquidity of the cryptocurrencies. According to BlockchainCentre, the trading volume flipenning is 65%.\n\nTotal transaction fees\n\nTotal transaction fees represent the USD value of fees paid for conducting transactions on each network. A higher percentage for Ethereum suggests that it has surpassed Bitcoin regarding transaction fee generation. According to BlockchainCentre, Ethereum has flippened Bitcoin on the value of fees paid to conduct transactions.\n\nGoogle search interest\n\nGoogle search interest measures the relative popularity of \u201cBitcoin\u201d and \u201cEthereum\u201d in search queries on Google, reflecting each cryptocurrency\u2019s public interest and awareness.\n\nAccording to BlockchainCentre, the Google search interest flipenning metric is 13%.\n\nThese metrics collectively offer a comprehensive perspective on the potential Flippening between Ethereum and Bitcoin. However, it\u2019s essential to acknowledge that various factors, including technological advancements, adoption rates, regulatory changes, and investor sentiment, influence market dynamics and cryptocurrency performance.\n\nWhile Ethereum has demonstrated significant growth and dominance in certain areas, the Flippening would indicate Ethereum surpassing Bitcoin in market capitalization, marking a shift in prominence within the cryptocurrency market.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Strengths and Potential Catalysts\n\nEthereum is a formidable contender in the cryptocurrency market, driven by its unique strengths and potential catalysts that could propel it to surpass Bitcoin in the next bull run. Let\u2019s delve into the key strengths of Ethereum and explore the factors that could act as catalysts for its growth.\n\nSmart Contract Functionality and Versatility\n\nOne of Ethereum\u2019s greatest strengths lies in its smart contract functionality. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with predefined conditions written into code, allowing for the automation and facilitation of transactions without intermediaries. This feature has revolutionized various industries, enabling the development of decentralized applications (DApps) and opening doors to new economic models.\n\nThe versatility of Ethereum\u2019s smart contract platform has led to the rapid growth of the DeFi ecosystem. DeFi applications built on Ethereum offer various financial services, including lending, borrowing, yield farming, and decentralized exchanges, providing users greater control over their assets and economic activities.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nEthereum\u2019s ecosystem has become a hotbed for innovation in DeFi and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). DeFi protocols built on Ethereum enable users to access financial services traditionally offered by centralized institutions but in a decentralized and permissionless manner. The exponential growth of the DeFi sector has attracted billions of dollars in value locked in these protocols, indicating the increasing adoption and utility of Ethereum. Liquidity in Ethereum contracts offers great utility/ functions like flash loans.\n\nSimilarly, NFTs have revolutionized digital ownership, allowing artists, creators, and collectors to tokenize and trade unique digital assets, from digital art and virtual real estate to in-game items and collectibles.\n\nWhat could kill Ethereum?\n\nTwo potential factors could pose risks to Ethereum: a core issue and an issue/exploit in an upgrade. Let\u2019s explore each of these factors in more detail:\n\nCore Issue\n\nA core issue is a fundamental problem or limitation within the Ethereum protocol. These issues could undermine the network\u2019s security, functionality, or usability, potentially leading to a loss of user confidence and adoption. Here are a few examples:\n\nSecurity Vulnerabilities: If critical security vulnerabilities are in Ethereum\u2019s core codebase, it could expose the network to attacks or exploits. These vulnerabilities might allow malicious actors to manipulate transactions, compromise user funds, or disrupt the operation of smart contracts.\n\nGovernance Challenges: Ethereum\u2019s governance model, which involves decision-making processes for protocol upgrades, can sometimes be a point of contention. If governance challenges arise and lead to significant conflicts or delays in implementing necessary improvements or upgrades, it could hinder Ethereum\u2019s progress and competitiveness.\n\nRegulatory and Legal Concerns: The evolving regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology can impact Ethereum\u2019s growth and adoption. Adverse regulatory actions or legal uncertainties could create barriers to entry for users and developers, potentially stifling innovation and causing reputational damage.\n\nIssue/Exploit in an Upgrade\n\nEthereum regularly undergoes upgrades to address existing challenges and introduce new features. While these upgrades aim to enhance the network, there is always a risk of issues or vulnerabilities emerging during the implementation process. Here are a few scenarios:\n\nSmart Contract Vulnerabilities: Ethereum\u2019s upgrades often involve changes to the smart contract functionality. A critical vulnerability in a widely used smart contract language or framework could result in the exploitation of contracts and the loss of user funds. Such incidents could erode trust in Ethereum and deter users and developers from utilizing the platform.\n\nNetwork Consensus Issues: Upgrades that involve changes to the consensus mechanism or network validation process carry inherent risks. If an upgrade introduces a flaw or vulnerability in the consensus algorithm, it could lead to network disruptions, consensus failures, or even chain splits. These events can undermine the integrity of the Ethereum network and fragment the community.\n\nIncompatibility or Implementation Errors: Upgrades often involve complex technical changes and require careful implementation. If errors occur during the upgrade process or if an upgrade is incompatible with existing contracts or infrastructure, it could lead to operational issues, service disruptions, or unintended consequences that negatively impact Ethereum\u2019s functionality.\n\nEthereum developers and the broader community employ rigorous testing, auditing, and peer review processes before implementing upgrades to mitigate these risks. Additionally, test networks like Ropsten, Rinkeby, and Goerli allow testing and identifying issues in a controlled environment before deploying upgrades on the Ethereum network.\n\nIt is important to note that while these risks exist, the Ethereum community actively works to address them through ongoing research, security practices, and collaboration. The decentralized nature of Ethereum allows for continuous improvement and adaptability to emerging challenges.\n\nWhat will it take for Ethereum to flip Bitcoin?\n\nFor Ethereum to flip Bitcoin and become the dominant cryptocurrency, Ethereum would need to surpass Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization, which is the total value of all coins in circulation. As of now, Bitcoin holds a significant lead in this metric. However, if Ethereum continues to experience significant growth, adoption, and sustained investor interest, it could close the gap over time.\n\nTo achieve this fete, Ethereum would have to excel in several areas, these include:\n\nNetwork Adoption and Usage: Ethereum\u2019s network must demonstrate higher adoption and usage levels than Bitcoin. This includes factors such as the number of active addresses, transaction count, transaction volume, and trading volume. If Ethereum consistently outperforms Bitcoin in these metrics, it could signal a shift in market preference towards Ethereum.\n\nTechnological Advancements: Ethereum\u2019s technological advancements, such as scalability solutions, improved transaction speeds, and lower fees, would need to provide a competitive edge over Bitcoin. Successful implementation of these upgrades could enhance Ethereum\u2019s attractiveness relative to Bitcoin.\n\nDeFi and Smart Contracts: Ethereum\u2019s position as the leading platform for DeFi and smart contracts provides a unique advantage. Continued growth and innovation in the DeFi space and developing compelling decentralized applications (dApps) and use cases could contribute to Ethereum\u2019s overall value proposition and potentially attract more users and investors.\n\nMarket Perception and Sentiment: Market sentiment plays a crucial role in cryptocurrency adoption and investment. Ethereum must maintain a positive perception among users, developers, investors, and the broader cryptocurrency community. This includes factors such as robust community support, favorable media coverage, regulatory clarity, and overall confidence in Ethereum\u2019s long-term viability.\n\nExternal Factors: It\u2019s important to consider external factors influencing the flippening. These factors include macroeconomic trends, regulatory developments, geopolitical events, technological breakthroughs, and competition from other cryptocurrencies. Ethereum must navigate these external dynamics effectively and demonstrate resilience and adaptability to emerge as the dominant cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum layer-1 competitors\n\nWhen considering layer-1 blockchains that have the potential to flip Bitcoin, it\u2019s important to note that Bitcoin\u2019s position as the leading cryptocurrency is well-established and challenging to surpass. However, several layer-1 blockchains have gained attention and could compete with Ethereum. Here are a few examples:\n\nCardano (ADA): Cardano is a blockchain platform that has gained attention for its scientific approach and commitment to peer-reviewed research. It utilizes a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to provide a secure and scalable infrastructure for developing decentralized applications.\n\nSolana (SOL): Solana is a high-performance blockchain for decentralized applications and crypto-assets. It combines proof-of-stake (PoS) and proof-of-history (PoH) mechanisms to achieve scalability and fast transaction speeds. Solana\u2019s architecture and growing ecosystem have attracted attention and positioned it as a potential challenger to Bitcoin.\n\nBinance Smart Chain (BSC): Binance Smart Chain is a blockchain platform developed by the popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance. It aims to provide a high-performance infrastructure for decentralized applications and token issuance. BSC\u2019s close integration with the Binance ecosystem and lower transaction fees than Ethereum have contributed to its rapid growth and popularity.\n\nPolkadot (DOT): Polkadot is a multi-chain platform enabling interoperability between blockchains. It offers a scalable and secure infrastructure for building decentralized applications and connecting various blockchain networks. With its focus on cross-chain communication and governance, Polkadot presents a unique value proposition and has gained attention as a potential challenger to Bitcoin.\n\nThe Open Network (TON): The Open Network (TON) is a blockchain project initially led by Telegram, aiming to create a decentralized platform for applications and fast transactions. Although Telegram exited the project in 2020, TON has seen subsequent developments and spin-offs, such as Free TON and Toncoin. These community-driven initiatives utilize the original TON codebase to explore the potential of decentralized applications and offer improved features such as encrypted messaging. While TON has undergone changes and separate entities have emerged, its core objective remains to provide a robust blockchain network for decentralized innovation and secure communication.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum\u2019s programmability and smart contract capabilities have made it the preferred platform for dApps and DeFi projects, fueling its impressive growth and adoption. The vibrant Ethereum ecosystem, coupled with constant development and upgrades, positions it as a strong contender to challenge Bitcoin\u2019s dominance.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin still holds a significant advantage in market capitalization, brand recognition, and widespread acceptance as a store of value. Bitcoin\u2019s limited supply and first-mover advantage have contributed to its status as digital gold and a haven asset during uncertain times.\n\nThe crypto market is notoriously volatile and influenced by a myriad of factors. Only time will tell how these two powerhouses will evolve and shape the future of digital finance."

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin's Surprising Ethereum Staking Strategy Explained - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently shared some intriguing insights into his personal staking strategy for Ethereum (ETH).\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, during a June 29 episode of the Bankless podcast, Buterin revealed that he only stakes a \u201csmall portion\u201d of his ETH. The reason? The complexities of multisignature wallets, or multisigs.\n\nUnraveling the Multisig Mystery\n\nMultisigs are a type of digital signature scheme that requires multiple parties to sign off on a transaction before it can be executed. This added layer of security is crucial in the crypto world, but it\u2019s not without its challenges. Buterin explained that staking ETH requires the keys to be public on an online subsystem for safety, and setting up a multisig for this purpose can be quite complicated.\n\nComparing Staking Strategies\n\nButerin\u2019s cautious approach to staking stands in stark contrast to that of Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Ethereum and founder of Cardano. Hoskinson expressed his surprise on Twitter, stating he was \u201cat a loss for words\u201d upon learning that Buterin only stakes a small portion of his Ether. He went on to reveal that he stakes all of his Cardano holdings.\n\nI had to listen to this a few times. I'm just at a loss for words. All of our Ada is staked. Guess what that's how it's supposed to be for a properly designed Proof of Stake protocol. https://t.co/ye6va1DH06 \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 29, 2023\n\nThe Future of Staking: EigenLayer Protocol\n\nButerin also touched on the topic of the EigenLayer protocol during the podcast. This protocol allows Ethereum validators and stakers to \u201cre-stake\u201d their assets onto other emerging networks. While it\u2019s still in its testnet phase and not expected to launch until Q3 2023, Buterin highlighted that it poses \u201ccentralization risks.\u201d He explained that the system would value trustworthy stakers more than untrustworthy ones, and the former are less likely to get slashed.\n\nSreeram Kaanan, the founder of EigenLayer, concurred with Buterin\u2019s concerns, emphasizing the \u201ccomplex risks\u201d associated with restaking. He advocated for a \u201cconstrained approach in building restaking,\u201d focusing on what\u2019s beneficial for the ecosystem and the potential for new innovation.\n\nThe Challenges of Scaling and Smart Contract Wallets\n\nButerin\u2019s comments on staking come on the heels of his June 9 blog post, where he stated that the Ethereum blockchain would \u201cfail\u201d without sufficient scaling infrastructure to make transactions affordable. He also pointed out another potential point of failure related to smart contract wallets. According to Buterin, the move to these wallets has led to complexities in user experience when users manage multiple addresses simultaneously."

        "title": "Bitcoin ($BTC) and Ethereum ($ETH) Could See Massive Gains in Period of 'Absolute Pleasure', Popular Analyst Says - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "The anonymous host of the popular YouTube channel InvestAnswers, who has in the past said he expects Bitcoin\u2019s price to hit $1.5 million by 2030, is forecasting bullish price tracjetories for both Bitcoin ($BTC) and Ethereum ($ETH) in the near future.\n\nIn a recent video shared with the host\u2019s dedicated following of 445,000 subscribers, he disclosed that the anticipatory rise of Bitcoin to $42,000 by April 2024 would not come as a surprise, based on trends observed in the options market.\n\nAccording to InvestAnswers, Bitcoin\u2019s call options have attracted more demand than put options, indicating a decidedly bullish sentiment. Call options, it\u2019s worth noting, are products that grant the holder the right but not the obligation to urcahse an asset at a specified price within a certain timeframe.\n\nConversely, put options allow but don\u2019t oblige the holder to sell an asset under the same conditions. InvestAnswers\u2019 host noted that for late this year there\u2019s a \u201chuge amount of action at the $45,000 level,\u201d and added that the put-call ratio is now at 0.39, which \u201cis very bullish.\u201d He added:\n\nI said many times before I would not be surprised if we saw $42,000 by April 2024 at the time of the halving. According to the [chart below], we could be there by Christmas \u2013 $45,000+. Again if these options actions\u2019 players are correct\n\nSwitching to Ethereum, the anonymous analyst is interpreting the put-call ratio for this second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization as an \u201cextremely bullish\u201d harbinger. Per his words there\u2019s a \u201clot of call demand again at $2,500 for ETH, same date December 29, 2023.\u201d\n\nThe put-call ratio here, he said, is at 0.21, which is \u201cextremely bullish\u201d and \u201cpretty much nobody\u201d is buying puts on Ethereum as the market is expecting the cryptocurrency to surpass $2,000 and go up to $2,500 by Christmas.\n\nThe host added that the timing may be unpredictable, but the next five months promise to be exciting, as will the year after that. Per his words, there will be 18 months of \u201cabsolute pleasure\u201d to come.\n\nAs CryptoGlboe reported, cryptocurrency analyst Willy Woo has recently indicated that he believes the price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin is in the \u201cearly stages of another price squeeze,\u201d suggesting the cryptocurrency\u2019s price could surge in the near future.\n\nWoo\u2019s words come as major financial powerhouses that collectively manage an astounding $27 trillion in assets are making inroads into the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency after a race to list the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States kicked off.\n\nThese financial behemoths, which include BlackRock, Fidelity, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, BNY Mellon, Invesco, and Bank of America are \u201cactively working to provide access to Bitcoin and more,\u201d according to CoinShares\u2019 Chief Strategy Officer Meltem Demirors.\n\nFeatured image via Unsplash."

        "content": "High-profile cryptocurrency founder Justin Sun drew attention today by making a significant transfer of Ethereum (ETH) coins. Data from the on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain reveals that Sun moved a staggering 23,000 ETH, equivalent to approximately $43 million, to Poloniex, a cryptocurrency exchange he owns.\n\nThis kind of substantial funds movement isn\u2019t out of character for Sun. As the founder of Tron and owner of multiple leading Web3.0 firms, he has his fingers in many pies in the crypto space. However, his recent movement of funds has led to speculations about its possible reasons.\n\nThere are speculations that Sun may be preparing to liquidate gradually, hoping to capitalize on Ethereum\u2019s recent price surge. An investigation of his associated wallet address reveals that Sun is an active participant in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem, frequently partaking in staking activities that yield regular rewards. Since Poloniex supports staking, this latest move might be a strategy to stake the funds on his platform.\n\nAn alternate possibility relates to liquidity management at Poloniex. As Sun has direct oversight of the trading platform, ensuring sufficient liquidity to meet all customer orders is a priority. This recent Ethereum transfer could bolster the platform\u2019s liquidity reserves.\n\nFear of sell-off: Is It justified?\n\nDespite these speculations, the fear of a massive sell-off spurred by Sun\u2019s recent move might be unjustified. Indeed, Sun holds a whale\u2019s share of various digital currencies, including Ethereum. However, even if he were to offload the entire 23,000 ETH, it might not significantly impact Ethereum\u2019s market, which boasts a market capitalization of over $224 billion. Consequently, the potential fallout from such a sell-off might not be as severe as some fear.\n\nAs Sun\u2019s significant Ethereum transfer has the crypto world buzzing, questions are being asked about whether it\u2019s a savvy market strategy or an attempt to manage liquidity on his exchange. Only time will tell."
