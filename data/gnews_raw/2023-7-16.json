        "content": "The primary architect of the Celo blockchain, cLabs, plans to \u201creturn home\u201d as an Ethereum layer-2 network using the Optimism stack.\n\ncLabs said the decision had come after months of research and initial discussions with stakeholders, alongside technical development in rollups. The team announced it Saturday during the Ethereum Community Conference in Paris.\n\n\u201cIt has become a viable path by which to allow Celo to align even more closely with Ethereum \u2014 by connecting trustlessly with it and leveraging its economic security,\u201d cLabs said.\n\nIn an optimistic rollup, transactions are first processed off-chain and considered valid even before they\u2019re settled on Ethereum mainnet, a process which happens in batches \u2014 hence the term \u201coptimistic.\u201d\n\ncLabs is also planning to incorporate EigenDA, a data availability layer sourced from re-staking project EigenLayer. The move would aim to reduce network storage expenses.\n\nThe team intends to design a decentralized sequencer for use by Celo\u2019s existing validators. The network\u2019s native token would still be used for governance. CELO, which started out on Ethereum as an ERC-20, has jumped 11% today to a $300 million market cap.\n\nCelo has lost about half of its market cap over the past year\n\nDetailed in the project\u2019s governance forum, Berlin-headquartered cLabs said adopting a rollup model for Celo could help the network grow.\n\nCelo mainnet, which is EVM-compatible, launched on Earth Day in 2020 \u2014 around two and a half years before Ethereum ditched proof of work for the less energy-intensive proof of stake. Celo says it\u2019s carbon negative via an offset program with Wren, a subscription startup for reducing carbon footprints.\n\nThe upgrade will eventually come as a hard fork, the team said. End users shouldn\u2019t notice if everything goes well. Transaction fees should remain consistent with no big changes for existing dApps, mobile-first features or its regenerative finance stack.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Enterprise blockchain: 'Ethereum for Business' explains key use cases - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has encountered its share of ups and downs over the past year, but blockchain technology continues to see impressive growth as businesses seek digital transformation.\n\nRecent findings from the market research platform, MarketsandMarkets, estimated the global blockchain market size to be $7.4 billion in 2022. While notable, the report indicates that the blockchain sector is expected to generate $94 billion in revenue by the end of 2027. If these findings are accurate, this will result in a compound annual growth rate of 66% from 2022 to 2027.\n\nBreaking down \u2018Ethereum for Business\u2019\n\nSpecifically speaking, many enterprises today are using the Ethereum blockchain to improve outdated business processes. Paul Brody, global blockchain leader for Ernst & Young (EY), told Cointelegraph that he believes the Ethereum network will drive the most growth for the enterprise blockchain market going forward.\n\nTo bring this to light, Brody recently published Ethereum for Business. According to Brody, this book intends to help non-technical, C-level executives and company leaders understand how and why Ethereum applies to specific use cases.\n\nBook cover. Source: University of Arkansas Press\n\nTo ease readers into the subject matter, Brody begins part one of the book by explaining how Ethereum works using relatable language. \u201cThere are three foundational concepts that are useful to understand \u2014 the distributed ledger, the programmable ledger, and consensus algorithm,\u201d he writes. Brody then explains that every \u201cfinancial system has a ledger,\u201d but notes that the difference between centralized, traditional systems and Ethereum is that \u201cEthereum\u2019s ledger is public and distributed to all participants.\u201d\n\nThe first chapter also explains the terminology associated with blockchain networks. Brody writes that \u201cbatches of transactions are known as \u2018blocks.\u2019\u201d He ends the chapter by mentioning that the Ethereum network is often attractive to business users because it offers the \u201cconvenience of an integrated digital business\u201d without a centralized market operator.\n\nBefore going in-depth on specific use cases, Brody spends the next few chapters of the book detailing terminology like wallets, tokens and smart contracts. For instance, in chapter four, he writes:\n\n\u201cIn Ethereum, both the money and the stuff can be represented as tokens, while the terms of the exchange between two parties can be captured in a smart contract.\u201d\n\nBrody adds that everything of value is stored in a wallet when using the Ethereum blockchain: \u201cWallets are just a name for a digital account where you can store your keys and the access rights to contacts and assets you control through those keys.\u201d\n\nRecent: AI in healthcare: New tech in diagnosis and patient care\n\nChapter five focuses on oracles; as Brody mentions, \u201centerprise transactions will require extensive use of oracles\u201d since external data sources will be essential for completing smart contracts for business purposes.\n\nThe information presented at the beginning of Brody\u2019s book is extremely useful for readers that may be new to the blockchain sector. The following chapters focus on concepts like privacy, which is a crucial consideration for enterprises leveraging blockchain.\n\nIn chapter six, Brody writes, \u201cThough enterprises require privacy, blockchains do not, by default, offer privacy.\u201d Given this, Brody focuses this section on privacy applications that can be applied to support enterprise transactions. Although Brody mentions at the beginning of the book that the read is not meant to promote EY\u2019s blockchain work, he does detail how Nightfall and Starlight \u2014 two privacy mechanisms created by EY \u2014 are used by businesses to ensure private blockchain transactions.\n\nReal-world enterprise Ethereum use cases\n\nPart two of Brody\u2019s book focuses on use cases and case studies. This section is probably the most interesting because it explains why the technology could be helpful for business processes.\n\nTokenization is heavily discussed in section two, with Brody writing that it is \u201cthe single most important thing enterprises can do in the blockchain space.\u201d He adds that tokenization is often the first decision that firms using blockchain make since this can be used to digitize assets that can be easily tracked and managed.\n\nAlthough Brody explains the difference between ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, he emphasizes that the ERC-1155 standard is gaining traction among enterprises due to its blend of fungible and nonfungible properties. Brody shares that an EY client in the pharmaceutical industry is currently using ERC-1155 tokens to track serialized medicine packages. \u201cUsing the 1155 standard, this firm can mint large volumes of tokens and transfer them in big batches to distributors and others,\u201d he writes.\n\nBrody continues sharing real-world examples of how EY clients apply the Ethereum blockchain. For instance, he explains how Italian beer producer Peroni uses blockchain for traceability, allowing consumers to scan a QR code to understand how the beer was produced.\n\n\u201cThose looking at a beer non-fungible token (NFT) from Peroni on the Polygon PoS chain (an Ethereum side chain), will be able to see Peroni\u2019s final batch token as well as input tokens from the malt house and farms,\u201d writes Brody.\n\nIn addition to these use cases, Brody details how blockchain helps with supply chain management, contract management, carbon emission tracking, payments and more. He emphasizes in this section that \u201cBlockchains will do for business ecosystems what ERP [enterprise resource planning] did inside the single enterprise.\u201d\n\n\u2018Ethereum for Business\u2019 is educational, but blockchain is broad\n\nWhile Ethereum for Business provides an in-depth and clear view of enterprise Ethereum, readers should remember that the blockchain ecosystem is broad. There are a number of different blockchain networks that businesses can use aside from Ethereum.\n\nRecent: Bug bounties can help secure blockchain networks, but have mixed results\n\nYet it\u2019s notable that Brody\u2019s new book gives an in-depth overview of the Ethereum ecosystem, breaking down key concepts while providing real-world use cases. This is extremely important, as education around blockchain technology is still needed to drive mainstream adoption.\n\nThe views, thoughts, and opinions expressed here are the author\u2019s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

        "title": "Will an Upcoming Tech Upgrade Send Ethereum Soaring? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Currently trading at a price of around $1,900, Ethereum (ETH 0.33%) is looking for its next big catalyst. While Ethereum is up by more than 60% year to date, it's still down significantly from the all-time high of $4,891.70 that it hit nearly two years ago. So it has plenty of potential upside.\n\nThat next big catalyst could be a blockchain upgrade that's tentatively scheduled to take place before the end of the year. In mid-2022, The Merge galvanized investors, and the crypto at one point rose 85% from the end of June to mid-August just before the upgrade took place in September. (The gain, of course, didn't last amid the brutal crypto winter.)\n\nCould this pending upgrade have a similarly positive impact?\n\nNot all tech upgrades are created equal\n\nAt the outset, it's important to differentiate between transformational upgrades and incremental upgrades. The Merge, which turned Ethereum from a proof-of-work blockchain into a proof-of-stake blockchain, was monumental. That helps to explain why there was so much investor excitement about The Merge.\n\nThe coming upgrade, known as Dencun (a mashup of \"Cancun\" and \"Deneb\"), will be more incremental. It has two goals: to reduce transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain and to increase the network's throughput. In short, it will help Ethereum to run faster and cheaper, and that's certainly worthwhile. But is it really a big deal?\n\nThe answer will depend on how much of an impact Dencun has on blockchain performance. Right now, Ethereum's transaction fees (known as \"gas fees\") can become exorbitant during peak periods of demand. Thus, any change that brings down these fees significantly is certainly important. Moreover, Dencun is the next big step on Ethereum's path to becoming able to handle 100,000 transactions per second. That's a huge number. To put it into context, the Visa (V 1.20%) credit card network can handle about 65,000 transactions per second.\n\nThe big picture\n\nThe really exciting part, if you're a long-term crypto investor, is how the new upgrade fits into the bigger picture. Ethereum has planned a series of improvements as part of its long-term plan to ensure it remains a best-in-class blockchain. In November, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin released an updated roadmap for development, and Dencun is part of stage one of a five-stage process.\n\nTo put it another way, Ethereum is not resting on its laurels after The Merge. After this stage, which is known as The Surge, there will be The Scourge, The Verge, The Purge, and The Splurge. Even if each of these developmental stages lasts for only six months or so, that's still a solid two to three years more of regular improvements being made to the blockchain.\n\nShould you buy Ethereum?\n\nOn its own, Dencun might not be enough to make Ethereum soar. It's just an incremental change to help the blockchain run faster and smoother. Yes, it will improve scalability and efficiency, and it will introduce a new transaction type, but it's not a transformational change like The Merge.\n\nHowever, if you consider this tech upgrade as one step in a long-term process designed to make Ethereum a best-in-class blockchain, then it's an exciting story. Some crypto traders have even suggested that Ethereum could more than double in value to the $5,000 price level as a result of this upgrade.\n\nPersonally, I think that's expecting too much from this upgrade since the all-time high for Ethereum is just under $5,000, and that was during the peak of a huge bull market for risky assets like cryptocurrencies. But as more details about Dencun get released, and as more people understand how it could put Ethereum on the path to 100,000 transactions per second, then it's not out of the realm of possibility that the token will experience an extended rally heading into 2024. For that reason, I'm bullish on Ethereum's prospects."

        "title": "Proto-Danksharding Is Going to Change Ethereum Completely\u2014And for The Better - Bitrates",
        "content": "A significant improvement to Ethereum is scheduled for later this year: proto-danksharding, the first step on the path to danksharding.\n\nLast year, Ethereum faced a seemingly impossible task \u2013 migrating from the Proof of Work consensus algorithm to the Proof of Stake (PoS) system, which reduced energy consumption by 99.95%. It managed to switch to a completely new design without disrupting the previous blockchain network. In spite of this achievement, there will be more upgrades to the network to improve scalability and ensure evolution. One of the most significant improvements to Ethereum is scheduled for later this year. We're talking about proto-danksharding, the first step on the path to danksharding. Even if rollups can help reduce fees for many Ethereum users, they're inadequate in the long term due to various technical difficulties. Danksharding encourages rollups to use the backspace by lowering the cost.\n\nEIP-4844 Will Benefit Ethereum and Other Layer 2 Rollup Solutions\n\nThe Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844, also referred to as the Cancun upgrade, introduces a new type of transaction containing a considerable amount of data that can't be retrieved during the Ethereum Virtual Machine execution but whose commitment can be accessed. With EIP-4844, Ethereum is progressing unto an architecture called sharding, which involves splitting the blockchain into tinier, livelier blockchains so that it can handle more transactions. The aim is to scale computation without impacting decentralization and security. Therefore, data must be stored efficiently (and be easily retrievable to end users). Attention must be paid to the fact that sharding and danksharding are interrelated, but they're not one and the same thing. Danksharding represents a means to an end: dividing networks in an effort to scale Ethereum.\n\nTo implement the complete sharding roadmap, blob-carrying transactions are used. A blob refers to partitioned data across bytes, from left to right, enabled by a KZG commitment. Making a cryptographic commitment is just like a promise in that you commit to a statement and demonstrate later that you were abiding by it. A constant-sized polynomial commitment scheme was introduced in 2010 \u2013 it goes by the name of KZG. Even opening multiple evaluations requires only a constant amount of communication overhead. Back on topic, the blobs can help alleviate Ethereum's network burden, growing largely enough to accommodate moderate pieces of data. The blobs are coupled with the Beacon Chain, so the data from the new transaction format is downloadable by all consensus nodes.\n\nTransactions Carrying Blobs Allow Layer 2 Solutions to Retrieve the Data in A Manageable Timeframe\n\nBig data applications require high-performance storage, not to mention transaction support. The blob storage system retains essential consistency and high throughput under heavy access. Blob-carrying transactions don't compete with the gas usage of standard transactions, although they function similarly. A blob enables two batches of transactions in Layer 2 networks, so it's critical to Ethereum's future. Indeed, Layer 2 networks have allowed transaction-heavy applications to overcome the Mainnet's gas fees, but additional scaling is required at the network level. To be clear, danksharding isn't meant to reduce the need for Layer 2 scaling Solutions.\n\nThe Dencun Upgrade Is Nearing the Final Stages of Planning\n\nDencun covers two individual upgrades: Cancun, the upgrade to Ethereum's execution Layer, and Deneb, which targets the consensus layer of Ethereum. Besides proto-danksharding, a few minor code changes to the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The other EIPs that made the proposals are:\n\nEIP-1153 - to introduce transient storage opcode that improves efficiency and reduces costs; it enables cleaner smart contracts, saves lots of gas, and simplifies the EVM design\n\n- to introduce transient storage opcode that improves efficiency and reduces costs; it enables cleaner smart contracts, saves lots of gas, and simplifies the EVM design EIP-4788 - to expose data about the Beacon Chain to the execution layer for permissionless access by smart contracts, improving designs for bridges\n\n- to expose data about the Beacon Chain to the execution layer for permissionless access by smart contracts, improving designs for bridges EIP-5656 - to introduce a new EVM instruction for efficient copying of memory areas\n\n- to introduce a new EVM instruction for efficient copying of memory areas EIP-6780 - to recover funds to the caller but not delete the account; basically, it eliminates code that could terminate smart contracts\n\nEthereum developer Mario Havel stated that Dencun is approaching the final stages of planning during the ETH conference in Spain. The upgrade will hand over the responsibility of storing complete information about the blockchain's state to a dedicated \"archival node,\" which will support a more extensive set of full nodes to store less data. The following upgrade will be the Verge, which will include Verkle trees. At any rate, Ethereum developers will soon release an in-depth specs document that includes test vectors for the Dencun upgrade.\n\nBlockchain architecture is complex (and the Ethereum Roadmap even more so)\n\nThe use of blockchain technology in software development helps create more secure and transparent systems. The blockchain is a complex structure with numerous components, but the Ethereum Roadmap is more complicated in nature. With the arrival of the Merge, Ethereum went from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake, opening the door for Ethereum 2.0 and advancing the evolution of cryptocurrency. The Shapella hard fork was an important milestone on the network roadmap. Still, it's just one step towards a fully scalable Ethereum ecosystem. The Dencun hard fork will implement proto-danksharding in the fourth quarter of 2023, allowing rollups to add cheaper data to the blocks and reduce network fees.\n\nThe blobs set the foundation for data sharding. To be more precise, instead of having separate sidechains, there's only one chain with a huge amount of information. Ethereum will leverage KZG commitments as its polynomial commitment scheme. It's called a commitment because the elliptic curve point is sent to a verifier, who can't alter the polynomial they're working with. They can only provide valid proof. The blobs will store data for a limited amount of time, so they won't come in contact with the Ethereum Virtual Machine even if its contents and availability can be verified by it.\n\nIt's expected that the Ethereum Roadmap will change as new information and technology become available. The Merge was the first step in Vitalik Buterin's big-picture thinking, meaning it's not the last. The network will enter a state of progressive improvements, with efforts focused on a certain point: scalability. As Ethereum's founder put it:\n\nIt is really central to the problems that are preventing a lot of the cryptocurrency and blockchain applications that we dream of going mainstream."

The funding round, led by prominent investment firm Dragonfly, demonstrates growing interest in Ethena's cutting-edge stablecoin project.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThus, in response to the challenges faced by previous stablecoin ventures, the start-up has developed a unique approach to ensuring its stablecoin, known as USDe, maintains a stable value relative to the U.S. dollar. By employing Ethereum derivatives and a hedging mechanism, Ethena aims to ensure that the value of USDe remains pegged to the dollar.\n\nThe difference\n\nThe key to this solution lies in the innovative use of collateral from users, allowing the platform to effectively hedge price exposure through shorting Ethereum via perpetual swaps. Through a balanced combination of staked ETH and derivatives, Ethena aims to neutralize any potential gains or losses, safeguarding the stability of USDe.\n\nThe start-up wants to distinguish itself from previous attempts at algorithmic stablecoins, such as the infamous Terra Luna. Moreover, Ethena's approach sets it apart from current stablecoin leaders USDC and USDT, which predominantly rely on traditional fiat-based assets like bills and bonds.\n\nThe success of Ethena's funding round is further amplified by the support it has garnered from prominent players in the cryptocurrency industry. Notable investors include big crypto exchanges and, additionally, Arthur Hayes. The founder of BitMEX and his family office have provided crucial backing to the project. This is especially noteworthy since Hayes himself has advocated for the development of an algorithmic stablecoin backed by Bitcoin derivatives, known as NakaDollar."

Discover SCENE\n\nzkSync is taking yet another step to decentralize.\n\nNamed after a mythical creature found in Lewis Carroll\u2019s poem \u2018The Hunting of the Snark,\u2019 the team behind zkSync has launched the latest upgrade to the speedy layer-2 network.\n\nThe launch is in so-called mainnet shadow mode, per the team, as part of the launch's phased rollout. This mode is a testing zone that runs in parallel to the mainnet.\n\nzkSync is a novel scaling solution for Ethereum and one of the few that use zero-knowledge (zk) rollups to do so. Rollups come in two varieties: zk and optimistic. Both batch transactions off of the mainnet, roll them up into even smaller bundles, then those bundles are compressed into a proof, and settled on Ethereum.\n\nPart of that process involves a prover. This piece of technology is what does the compressing and packing of all those transactions. It's the cryptographic equivalent of a trash compactor, except it's not trash but potentially thousands of dollars in crypto activity.\n\nGiven the high computing power needed to generate those proofs, however, the barrier for users to participate is quite high.\n\nThe latest upgrade will address precisely this.\n\nCalled Boojum, which, per Carroll, is the most dangerous variety of Snark (itself a fictionalized creature), the tech will lower the hardware barrier to help secure zkSync.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe new prover can be operated with as little as 8 gigabytes of hardware, whereas the average prover demands roughly 500 gigabytes on average, said zkSync CEO Alex Gluchowski.\n\n\u201cSo far, we've seen the benchmark competitors indicating something like north of 500 gigabytes of RAM for a prover,\u201d he told Decrypt. \u201cAnd as you can only run it on the cloud, it's not ready for this [wide adoption]. Our prover requires only eight gigabytes of GPU RAM and it can run on GPUs that are compatible with gaming computers.\u201d\n\nAlong with lowering the hardware demands, Boojum is also doing all its transaction compressing for much cheaper, too. Cutting costs here is crucial, even if it's only pennies.\n\n\u201cJust because a single transaction costs $1 to produce, or even 10 cents, or even less than that, getting through hundreds of thousands of transactions per second would mean massive expanding, and you will probably not have enough of the hardware in the vulnerable clusters to produce and sustain this load,\u201d said Gluchowski.\n\nInstead of several large data centers supporting a blockchain network, especially one executing such taxing computations as generating cryptographic proofs, the upgraded prover will make it accessible to anyone.\n\nJust like miners on Bitcoin and validators on Ethereum are paid for securing their networks, so too would provers on zkSync, he said.\n\nThe zkSync CEO even argued that it could be a viable way to repurpose the mining industry.\n\n\u201cI personally don't think the proof of work will be a sustainable source of business,\u201d he told Decrypt. \u201cThey will have to shift to something that actually provides normally redundant value, not like waste kind of work. Actually like doing some useful work.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith this step in the decentralization step executed, Gluchowski said that the next step is to decentralize zkSync\u2019s sequencer. This piece of a blockchain is responsible for ordering transactions in each block.\n\nExecuting this step also suggests a token launch in the future, he told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cWhen you decentralized the sequencer, you will need some way to permissionlessly verify transactions,\u201d said Gluchowski."

        "content": "How to Buy Ethereum with PayPal\n\nBuying Ethereum with PayPal is an attractive option for the buyers facing banking restrictions in their countries of residence. At the same time, this is a viable alternative to banks whose transaction or conversion fees are considered too high\u2026\n\nBuying Ethereum with PayPal is an attractive option for the buyers facing banking restrictions in their countries of residence. At the same time, this is a convenient alternative to banks whose transaction or conversion fees are considered too high for one\u2019s taste or pocket. There are few quick legit ways how to buy Ethereum with PayPal.\n\nSince late 2020, you can buy cryptocurrencies using your PayPal e-wallet. All you need to do is have a funded PayPal account, choose the cryptocurrency you want to buy, and confirm your purchase.\n\nHowever, buying ether on PayPal has its own caveats. For instance, PayPal does not allow you to withdraw your crypto assets into a private self-hosted wallet, meaning that you won\u2019t be able to use it for anything else but selling it back to PayPal once its price goes up or down. The essence of cryptocurrency is the ability to own private digital cash without having to rely on any intermediaries and send or receive them in a censorship-resistant way. At least for now, getting cryptocurrency via PayPal is a safe way to get exposure to the asset class, but it does not let you use it in ways it was made to be used \u2013 as a free and open peer-to-peer (P2P) financial system without trusted intermediaries.\n\nLuckily for you, there actually are three other methods of how you can buy Ethereum with PayPal instantly via other platforms that give you full ownership of your digital assets.\n\nBuying Ethereum With PayPal via LocalEthereum\n\nAnother option is to visit LocalEthereum as an informal exchange platform on which you can find and get in touch with people who sell ether in various areas. Depending on their preferences, they may accept PayPal payment from you.\n\nLocalEthereum operates as a website which connects you with people who want to sell Ethereum in your local area or worldwide. It is like \u201ceBay of Ethereum.\u201d Depending on how thorough you are in your search, sooner or later you will find someone willing to accept PayPal payments. If you want to buy ETH with PayPal in this manner, you should pay attention to any aspect of a transaction in advance, as you alone will bear the risk of dealing with scammers. Some of them may claim that they never received your payment, so go for reputable traders only. Make sure you check their terms of trade and try to learn as much about them as possible before clicking on a payment button.\n\nThese are the most convenient ways to purchase Ethereum with PayPal. If you want to learn more about how to buy other cryptocurrencies, see our \u201cHow to get altcoins\u201d guide."

        "content": "Image: Getty Images\n\nCelo, a blockchain platform, has proposed to return to the Ethereum ecosystem by transitioning from an independent layer-1 blockchain to an Ethereum layer-2 (L2) solution. The move aims to leverage OP Stack as the architecture for Celo's Ethereum L2 blockchain, enabling seamless integration with Ethereum's tooling and libraries.The proposal discussed on Celo's governance forum outlines critical elements of the transition. It includes establishing an off-chain data availability layer operated by Ethereum node operators and secured by restaked Ether (ETH). The existing validators would also be transformed into decentralised sequencers for the L2 solution.Layer-1 and Layer-2 blockchains differ in purpose and design. While layer-1 networks operate independently, layer-2 solutions enhance the performance of layer-1 blockchains. The transition to Ethereum L2 would offer benefits such as increased security and lower gas fees compared to other L2 solutions.The proposal assures end-users would not be affected by the migration, and CELO token holders would retain control over core contracts by voting on governance proposals. Moreover, CELO tokens would be used to pay for gas within the new L2 ecosystem.It is expected to facilitate increased liquidity flow between Celo and other chains. It may introduce additional costs for sequencers, including fees on the data availability layer and gas on Ethereum.The proposal is scheduled for discussion on a governance call on July 21, followed by a \"temperature check\" the following day. If adopted, the transition would enable Celo to benefit from Ethereum's robust tooling and libraries, enhancing compatibility and expanding possibilities for developers.Celo has been actively improving its mobile experience and incorporating features that target developing economies, where demand for technological payment solutions is high. By embracing the Ethereum L2 solution, Celo aims to unlock further potential and strengthen its position within the competitive blockchain landscape.As the governance discussions unfold and the technical details are finalised, the community eagerly awaits the outcome, which could mark a significant milestone in the evolution of Celo's blockchain ecosystem and its integration with the broader Ethereum network."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nRecent data reveals that Ethereum (ETH) whales are significantly selling off their holdings. One such instance involved a transaction where a whale sold 4,549 ETH for approximately $8.78 million, at a price of $1,930 around 14 hours ago. Notably, this particular whale initially spent $6 million to buy 4,549 ETH at a price of $1,319 on Jan. 9, which means they made a profit of approximately $2.78 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis sell-off pattern among ETH whales might have been triggered by a strategic move to reap the benefits of the cryptocurrency's recent surge in value. This market situation largely stems from the positive court decision in favor of Ripple's XRP, which had a ripple effect on several other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.\n\nA whale sold 4,549 $ETH for 8.78M $USDT at a price of $1,930 14 hrs ago.\n\n\n\nThis whale spent $6M to buy 4,549 $ETH at a price of $1,319 on Jan 9, and has earned $2.78M so far.https://t.co/pzSfTqYuPn pic.twitter.com/PEtWS9LXmE \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 16, 2023\n\nThe court's decision seems to have provided a significant boost to the overall cryptocurrency market sentiment, leading to a considerable price appreciation for several tokens, Ethereum included.\n\nSubsequent to the XRP court decision, Ethereum surged to around $2,000. This impressive rally undoubtedly offered an attractive profit-taking opportunity for ETH whales who had acquired their holdings at lower price levels. As such, the current ETH sell-off by whales could be a reflection of these large investors cashing in on their profits, an understandable move considering the crypto market's notorious volatility.\n\nHowever, as whales started selling, the price of Ethereum began to retreat from its $2,000 level, a natural market reaction to a substantial sell-off. This recent activity in the Ethereum market serves as a reminder of the significant influence whales can wield on crypto prices, often leading to sharp price fluctuations."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nIt was a week of altcoin rallies after Ripple\u2019s courtroom victory against the SEC, and details of an upcoming Polygon 2.0 rollout shifted attention away from the two market leaders.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) still gained in value, a modest 3%, and currently changes hands at $30,287, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Monday, reports hit the press that the British multinational bank Standard Chartered predicted that Bitcoin will hit $120,000 before 2025. It wasn\u2019t quite enough to boost the price of the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization this week, though.\n\nEthereum (ETH) fared substantially better, though not in the same league as the altcoins. It rose 6.6% to trade at $2,001 at the start of the weekend\u2014$1,932 as of this writing. On Thursday, Ethereum hit $2,000 for the first time since May.\n\nWhile the latest CPI report, released on Wednesday, indicates that U.S. inflation is going down in line with expectations, it wasn\u2019t quite enough to send investors toward the two most popular cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe first substantial bit of altcoin news broke on Tuesday when Polygon (MATIC) began to surge following an uptick in network growth.\n\nOn Thursday, Polygon published a technical proposal for Polygon 2.0 and proposed the launch of a new native token for the network: POL token\u2014a kind of upgrade to MATIC.\n\nClearly, it was already a good week for Polygon holders, but things got even better on Thursday when a judge presiding over the Ripple vs SEC case ruled in favor of Ripple.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJudge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP \"is not necessarily a security on its face\u201d and programmatic sales of XRP to the public did not break securities laws, but some $728 million worth of institutional sales of XRP did qualify as securities offerings because they were sold to buyers who expected to profit in a common enterprise.\n\nThe news didn\u2019t just boost XRP, it also caused Polygon, Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) to blow up by double digit percentages on Thursday. Crypto\u2019s total market cap surged 6% in the hours following to hit $1.3 trillion on Friday.\n\nAt the start of the weekend, all four altcoins were up by double digit percentages over the last seven days. XRP leads with an eye-popping 66% spike in price and currently trades at $0.72194.\n\nSolana blew up 33% and now trades at $27.44, Polygon rose 24% before settling to $0.8061 and Cardano added 22%, now $0.3299.\n\nOther particularly noteworthy rallies this week include Stellar\u2019s XLM, up 47% and now trades at $0.1316, Chainlink (LINK) added 14% to settle at $6.96, and Lido DAO (LDO) rallied 26% to trade at $2.37 as of this writing.\n\nThere were no major losses among the top thirty cryptocurrencies.\n\nCoinbase, Kraken and Crypto.com all announced they would all be relisting XRP after the momentous court ruling.\n\nFinally, regulators across the world are continuing to grapple with the growing crypto industry.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Monday, two high-level European Union institutions, the European Banking Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority, both released new guidelines in the runup to the implementation of Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), a comprehensive framework for governing the industry across all the bloc\u2019s 27 member states.\n\nMiCA comes into force on 30 June 2024.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, South Korea's Financial Services Commission (FSC) announced the implementation of rules, effective from January 2024, requiring crypto firms to submit detailed crypto disclosures in their financial statements."

        "content": "In brief Gnosis started out in 2015 as a decentralized prediction market on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nEstablished at the end of 2020, GnosisDAO is the collective steward of the Gnosis ecosystem.\n\nThe CoW (Confidence of Wants) protocol is a permissionless decentralized exchange (DEX)\n\nYour Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nOriginally envisioned as a decentralized prediction market, Gnosis is a blockchain project running on top of the Ethereum network.\n\nGnosis started out in 2015 as a decentralized prediction market on the Ethereum blockchain. Originally, the team behind the project intended to develop a platform similar to the once promising betting platform Augur, with the now discontinued Gnosis Olympia becoming the project\u2019s first flagship decentralized application (dApp).\n\n\n\nThe idea of a prediction market is still very much alive though: while Gnosis itself serves as an open framework, prediction markets are realized in third-party dApps built on top the Gnosis Chain, such as Azuro, Omen, and Reality Card. These platforms allow users to bet on the outcome of sport events, cryptocurrency prices, technology developments and politics, among other categories.\n\nWith the realization of a greater need for infrastructure tools to expand the utility of the Ethereum ecosystem, Gnosis also moved to develop products such as a decentralized custody protocol and asset management platform Safe (previously known as Gnosis Safe) and the CoW Protocol (previously known as the xotocol), a permissionless trading protocol, which\u2014somewhat similar to the way Uniswap and 1inch work\u2014 finds the lowest price for trades across exchanges and aggregators.\n\n\n\nOther products developed by Gnosis include Conditional Tokens\u2014 a new asset class designed to facilitate the creation of highly liquid prediction markets, with the value of the assets directly correlated to the outcome of an event, as well as Gnosis Auction and Zodiac.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGnosis Auction helps projects discover a fair price for their token, whereas Zodiac is a collection of tools for composable Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).\n\nIn November 2020, Gnosis announced the creation of GnosisDAO, described as a prediction market-driven collective with the mission to successfully steward the Gnosis ecosystem through futarchy\u2014a form of governance where prediction markets play a crucial role in determining which policies will have the most positive effect.\n\n\n\nNext year, the xDai and GnosisDAO communities voted to merge their ecosystems to create the Gnosis Chain\u2014 an EVM-based Ethereum sidechain for stable transactions that leverages the xDai token.\n\n\n\nSafe, in its turn, announced the launch of its SafeDAO and Safe Token in September 2022.\n\nThe Gnosis ecosystem overview\n\nThe Gnosis ecosystem is powered by a native token called GNO, which is used for staking on the Gnosis Beacon Chain and serves as the governance token for the GnosisDAO.\n\nTo improve the utility of the Ethereum blockchain, the Gnosis ecosystem relies on several components.\n\n\n\nCoW Protocol\n\nThe CoW (Confidence of Wants) protocol is a permissionless decentralized exchange (DEX), enabling users to exchange any ERC-20 token\u2014a token standard that allows developers to create their own tokens on the Ethereum network.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat sets the CoW protocol apart from other DEXs is its unique approach to matching and executing trades. Rather than using an automated market maker system that relies on user-provided liquidity, the CoW Protocol matches buyers and sellers through multi-token batch auctions and executes trades at the most favorable available price.\n\nThe batch auction mechanism functions by consolidating buy and sell orders every five minutes. Other users can then vie to offer the best order settlement for the group of trades, a process referred to as \"solving.\" Individuals who engage in this activity on the protocol are known as \"solvers.\"\n\nBy employing solving, traders on the CoW Protocol are shielded from miner extractable value (MEV), which refers to the process where individuals who create new ETH can further profit by manipulating their control over the network and prioritizing certain users\u2019 transactions.\n\nSafe\n\nSafe is a customizable multisignature wallet infrastructure that operates as a smart contract wallet on the Ethereum network, mandating a predetermined number of approvals before a transaction can be executed.\n\nSafe offers support for ETH, ERC-20 and ERC-721 (NFTs) tokens, as well as the ability to interact with various DeFi platforms.\n\n\n\nSafe is governed by SafeDAO, a decentralized collective of core contributors, backers, users and ecosystem contributors, collectively known as Safe Guardians.\n\nGnosis Chain\n\nThe Gnosis Chain is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) execution-layer chain that utilizes the xDAI stablecoin to enable transactions and cover fees. The network's security is ensured by the Gnosis Beacon Chain (GBC) consensus layer.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe GBC uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, where users lock up a certain amount of GNO tokens to participate in the transaction validation process. By doing so, they can earn additional GNO tokens as a reward for aiding in securing the network.\n\nGnosisDAO\n\nEstablished at the end of 2020, GnosisDAO is the collective steward of the Gnosis ecosystem.\n\nAs a DAO, Gnosis uses the products it creates to guide decisions on the development, support and governance of its ecosystem.\n\nThe GnosisDAO governance process is primarily conducted on the Gnosis Forum, with every successful proposal required to pass three phases before being approved. The governance process is permissionless, meaning there\u2019s no single entity restricting access or controlling participation, with the only requirement that community members hold a minimum of 1 GNO to participate in the GnosisDAO Snapshot poll that makes a ruling on a proposal\u2019s outcome.\n\nToday, the GnosisDAO treasury controls over 150,000 ETH and 8 million GNO, with the GNO tokens vested over eight years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "Arbitrum 101: The Future of Ethereum Scaling is Here! - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nArbitrum is one of the most promising layer-2 scaling solutions for Ethereum. It offers a number of advantages over the Ethereum mainnet, including faster transaction speeds, lower fees, and full compatibility with existing Ethereum applications.\n\nAs the Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow, Arbitrum is poised to play a major role in enabling its scalability and adoption.\n\nWhat will you learn in this article?\n\nWhat is Arbitrum and how does it work?\n\nThe benefits of using Arbitrum\n\nThe risks associated with Arbitrum\n\nThe Arbitrum ecosystem\n\nThe future of Arbitrum\n\nWe know you can\u2019t wait to get started. Dive in!\n\nKey Takeaways Layer 2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum offer faster and cheaper transactions to solve Ethereum\u2019s scaling problems.It uses optimistic rollup to batch transactions and execute them off-chain.It is one of the fastest growing Layer-2 solutions, with over 50% YoY growth in developers.\n\n1. What is Arbitrum?\n\nA layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, Arbitrum is devised to work on the scalability and reduce the high gas fees linked to the Ethereum network. It is operating as a sidechain which runs with Ethereum mainnet and offers faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nIt is compatible with Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts which makes the developers port their existing Ethereum applications to Arbitrum with very minimum modifications.\n\nIt uses an \u201coptimistic rollup\u201d approach which makes sure that most transactions are processed off-chain and validated on-chain, thus reducing the load on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nAs the transactions are processed off-chain, there is much lower gas fees in comparison to Ethereum.\n\nIt relies on Ethereum\u2019s security for dispute resolution.\n\nIt is compatible with Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem.\n\n1.1. Overview\n\nIn 2018, a team of researchers and engineers established Offchain Labs, laying the foundation for what would become Arbitrum. The primary objective was to tackle the scalability and high gas fee issues plaguing Ethereum. In 2019, Offchain Labs introduced the alpha version of Arbitrum, a proof-of-concept showcasing its advanced rollup technology. The most significant milestone came in 2021 with the launch of Arbitrum One, the mainnet version of Arbitrum. This marked a major step towards providing a layer-2 solution for the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n1.2. How Does it Work?\n\nLet us consider Arbitrum as a super-fast and cost-effective express line for the Ethereum network.\n\nWhen someone wants to work with Ethereum, like trading, he can send the transaction to Arbitrum instead of the main Ethereum line.\n\nArbitrum processes the work off-chain, just like a secret shortcut, making things super quick without dealing with heavy traffic.\n\nOnce a transaction is processed on Arbitrum\u2019s express line , one gets a ticket faster. It is verified on Ethereum\u2019s main line which is slower but secure.\n\nArbitrum takes less fees for faster rides as its work is mostly off-chain.\n\nIn case of disputes, Ethereum\u2019s security guards (its decentralised network) step in to rectify everything.\n\nIt makes using Ethereum faster and cheaper by using a very wise shortcut.\n\n1.3. Deciphering Layer 2 Scaling\n\nLayer 2 scaling is akin to adding an extra express highway alongside the main road to reduce traffic congestion. In the cryptocurrency world, it involves creating a secondary layer parallel to the primary blockchain, enabling faster and more cost-effective transaction processing. This secondary layer can manage numerous transactions without overburdening the primary blockchain, enhancing overall system efficiency.\n\n1.4. The Arbitrum Airdrop\n\nAn Airdrop refers to the distribution of tokens to eligible users who actively engage with the Arbitrum Layer 2 scaling solution. Here\u2019s how the Arbitrum Airdrop operates:\n\nTo qualify, users must interact with the Arbitrum network, whether by using DApps or conducting transactions on Arbitrum Layer 2.\n\nThe Airdrop team takes a \u201csnapshot\u201d of the Ethereum blockchain at a specific block height, recording the addresses and balances of users active on Arbitrum up to that point.\n\nAfter the snapshot, tokens are distributed to eligible addresses on a one-to-one basis.\n\nIn some cases, users may need to claim their tokens through a website or transaction.\n\nOnce received, these tokens can be used in various ways.\n\nArbitrum airdrops reward early adopters and promote blockchain technology usage, fostering the growth of the ecosystem. One of the highly anticipated airdrops in 2023 is $ARB, with specific criteria for \u201cactive\u201d user qualification.\n\n1.5. The ARB Token in Focus\n\nARB is the native ERC-20 compatible governance token for the Arbitrum network, serving various functions, including value transfer, investment, and governance voting. The initial supply of $ARB at launch was 10 billion, with a 2% annual inflation rate. In March 2023, approximately 12.75% of the total supply was distributed among eligible users and DAOs, resulting in a circulating supply of around 1.275 billion $ARB.\n\nARB tokens grant users a voice in Arbitrum DAO governance. The DAO plays a pivotal role in decision-making regarding fund allocation, protocol operations, and system investments. These decisions are made transparently on platforms like Snapshot.org, where users can cast their votes. ARB token holders also participate in the election of members for the security council, a 12-member team responsible for managing the treasury wallet.\n\n2. What is the Arbitrum Bridge?\n\nIt is a mechanism which allows a user to move his assets between Ethereum blockchain (Layer 1) and Arbitrum Layer 2 network. It is like a bridge connecting two stations, Ethereum mainnet and Arbitrum Layer 2.\n\nTo use it, first deposit the assets, Ether (ETH) or other tokens, into a smart contract on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nAfter depositing the assets, initiate a transfer through Arbitrum bridge by sending a request or transaction from Ethereum to Arbitrum.\n\nOnce a request is received, it processes it on the Arbitrum layer 2 network. The assets become available on Arbitrum, where they can be used for faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nThe assets can be moved back to Ethereum mainnet by initiating a withdrawal from Arbitrum bridge. The bridge would release the assets on Ethereum, and they become available on Ethereum again.\n\n3. Key Benefits of Arbitrum\n\nArbitrum offers several advantages, making it a compelling choice for Ethereum users and developers:\n\nTransaction Acceleration: Arbitrum significantly accelerates transaction processing, supporting a high number of transactions per second. This enhanced speed results in quicker and more efficient interactions with DApps. Reduced Transaction Fees: Users can enjoy lower transaction fees when compared to the Ethereum mainnet, reducing the overall cost of engaging with the network. Full Ethereum Compatibility: Arbitrum ensures full compatibility with Ethereum, allowing seamless migration of existing Ethereum applications with minimal adjustments.

        "title": "Ethereum prices struggling to pierce $2,100 while TOADS Set For 450% Surge On Launch - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has long held the spotlight as one of the leading digital assets due to its thriving ecosystem. Recent market trends have shown that Ethereum faces an uphill battle. The value of ETH has been struggling to breach the psychological barrier of $2,100, reflecting the current challenges of cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile Ethereum grapples with its resistance, the launch date for a top-performing digital currency called DigiToads (TOADS) has finally been revealed. As crypto enthusiasts eagerly await this upcoming project, experts and analysts predict that upon release on August 21st, 2023, TOADS will experience an astounding 450% surge in value.\n\nThis article will explore Ethereum\u2019s struggle to breach the $2,100 resistance level while forecasting the potential rally from DigiToads\u2019 upcoming launch on decentralized exchanges.\n\nDigiToads (TOADS) Upcoming Launch Will Result In Massive Growth\n\nDigiToads is an innovative meme coin that has been the center of attention lately, owing to its thriving presale phase. It\u2019s been an incredible few months for DigiToads\u2019 early investors, with the presale event going mainstream as the best ICO. This factor has helped DigiToads presale generate over $6 million in funding across 9 out of 10 stages, making it one of the most successful crypto presales in 2023.\n\nTOADS have experienced an astounding 370% surge in value during the presale, soaring from $0.01 to an impressive $0.047 in just nine stages. With the token launch scheduled after this year\u2019s best ICO concludes, the presale is projected to culminate in an outstanding 450% return on investment. Investors and enthusiasts eagerly anticipate the token launch, hoping to capitalize on the potential of TOADS.\n\nThis projection is based on the high demand witnessed during the ongoing presale, the limited supply, and the innovative features offered by the cryptocurrency. DigiToads is not just about hype but also about utility. By leveraging NFTs and DeFi gaming, DigiToads\u2019 potential for widespread adoption must be considered. The chance to participate in the best crypto investment platform like DigiToads, with the possibility of multiplying investments, is the selling point that has drawn investors\u2019 participation in the token.\n\nThe presale is on its way to culminate in a listing on two top decentralized exchanges, Uniswap and BitMart, scheduled for August 21st. Global investors can access the token for buying and trading, while early investors can withdraw their TOADS tokens. This significant milestone for DigiToads has sparked speculation and anticipation among investors.\n\nThe reputable and established exchange listings will bolster the token\u2019s growth and market presence. Analysis experts have predicted that since new DeFi projects possess more potential, once DigiToads hit the market, the value of the TOADS token will experience an astounding surge. Conservative estimation suggests an increase of at least 10x from the launch price of $0.055, making it the best crypto investment this bearish season.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Facing Huge Competition, Leading To Price Struggle\n\nDespite several attempts over the past few weeks, Ethereum has struggled to breach the $2,100 resistance barrier. Investors and traders have closely monitored this crucial level, as it represents a psychological and technical obstacle to the cryptocurrency\u2019s price growth. While ETH has shown resilience and made remarkable gains, the current market sentiment has created an atmosphere of caution and uncertainty.\n\nSeveral external factors have contributed to the recent price struggles of Ethereum. On-chain data and general market sentiment suggest that crypto traders favor BTC over ETH due to the potential growth the Bitcoin ETF could bring. This has contributed to Ethereum consolidating at the $2100 mark and investors migrating to new DeFi projects that show promise.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs Ethereum faces challenges in breaching the $2,100 resistance, DigiToads emerges as a promising digital asset. The upcoming launch of DigiToads is anticipated to bring a remarkable 450% surge in value, attracting investors seeking profitable opportunities. With a successful presale, DigiToads has generated significant funding and mainstream attention. Whether this project lives up to the expectations remains to be seen, but one thing is sure: DigiToads has already made its mark, and it\u2019s a project worth keeping an eye on.\n\nVisit DigiToads Presale\n\nMint DigiToads NFTs Here\n\nBuy DigiToads NFTs on OpenSea\n\nJoin the community\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "This comprehensive guide offers a detailed overview of Ethereum price predictions and also discusses the ongoing legal challenges faced by Ripple in the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit. With insights gathered from multiple sources, this article provides fresh information and analysis for crypto enthusiasts interested in Ethereum\u2019s price outlook and the latest developments in the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. Delve into this guide which discusses Ethereum\u2019s future prospects and the potential impact of the ongoing legal battle.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price History\n\nEthereum\u2019s price history reflects its many fluctuations over the years. In 2021, Ethereum experienced a notable surge in value driven by increased demand that might be attributable to technological advancements, including the introduction of the Berlin update and reduced transaction fees. However, the collapse of FTX in late 2022 had a significant impact on the cryptocurrency\u2019s price. As of July 10, 2023, Ethereum was valued at $1,864.58, a considerable decrease from its peak price of around $4,400 at the end of 2021. The crypto market is known for its volatility, and Ethereum\u2019s price history reflects the dynamic nature of the industry.\n\nWhat is ApeMax?\n\nApeMax has emerged as a highly interesting and innovative new cryptocurrency, garnering growing excitement within the crypto community. This project introduces a decentralized platform that allows holders to stake their tokens and earn rewards in a secure and transparent manner. ApeMax\u2019s could revolutionize the meme coin landscape as it combines entertaining and interactive elements with fun utility and staking functionalities, and all these features are accessible even during the presale period. With its interesting tokenomics, ApeMax is an intriguing contender in the realm of new meme coins, captivating the attention of crypto fans.\n\nWhat is the ApeMax Presale?\n\nThe ApeMax presale is currently open, presenting a limited-time opportunity for eligible buyers to acquire ApeMax tokens presale prices. ApeMax Coin stands out with its innovative tokenomics, enabling token holders to earn rewards by staking their coins on a diverse range of entities, including content creators, Web3 projects, influencers, and philanthropic organizations that align with their interests.\n\nBy participating in the ApeMax presale, eligible buyers can immediately engage in the rewards process of staking. This distinctive feature sets ApeMax apart from other cryptocurrencies, as users can start using the token\u2019s utility and start staking and earning rewards right from the initial stages, even during the presale period.\n\nTiming plays a pivotal role in the cryptocurrency landscape. The presale price of ApeMax undergoes gradual increments every 24 hours during the presale phase. Additionally, early-stage buyers of ApeMax have the exclusive opportunity to acquire Early Birds Loot Boxes, through which they can enjoy discounts of up to 50% on ApeMax tokens.\n\nCan Ethereum reach $100K?\n\nNo, it is unlikely that Ethereum will reach $100,000 per coin anytime soon. While Ethereum has shown strong growth and potential, achieving such a high value would require a significant increase in demand and adoption. Factors such as market dynamics, regulatory challenges, and competition from other cryptocurrencies make it improbable. It\u2019s essential to approach price predictions with caution and conduct thorough independent analysis before making crypto decisions.\n\nHow much will my Ethereum be worth in 2025?\n\nThe exact value of Ethereum in 2025 is uncertain and highly speculative. Predicting future prices of cryptocurrencies is challenging due to various factors that can influence the market. While Ethereum has shown promise and growth in the past, it\u2019s important to consider the volatility and unpredictability of the crypto market. It is advisable to conduct thorough research, analyze market trends, and consult with financial professionals before making any crypto purchases.\n\nWhat will Ethereum be worth in 2030?\n\nThe future value of Ethereum in 2030 is speculative and uncertain. Predicting the long-term price of cryptocurrencies is challenging due to the dynamic nature of the market and various factors that can influence prices. Ethereum has shown past potential for growth and adoption, but it\u2019s important to consider the volatility and unpredictable nature of the crypto market. Conducting thorough research, staying informed about market trends, and seeking advice from unbiased experts is essential prior to making any crypto related decisions.\n\nCan Ethereum crash to zero?\n\nWhile it is somewhat unlikely that Ethereum will crash to zero, it\u2019s important to acknowledge the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrencies, and even though this scenario may seem unlikely, it is possible for Ethereum and any crypto for that matter to crash to zero. Ethereum has established itself as one of the leading blockchain platforms with a wide range of use cases and strong community support. However, like any crypto, there are factors that can impact its value, including market volatility, regulatory changes, technological developments, and consumer sentiment. It\u2019s crucial to stay informed, and understand and assess the risks involved before making any crypto acquisitions.\n\nDoes Ethereum have a future?\n\nYes, according to some analysts, Ethereum could have an interesting future. As one of the leading blockchain platforms, Ethereum has established itself as a fundamental infrastructure for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Its robust developer community and ongoing improvements, such as the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, aim to address scalability and enhance the network\u2019s performance. Ethereum\u2019s versatility and wide range of use cases, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and more, position it for continued innovation. However, as with any cryptocurrency and blockchain, it\u2019s important to conduct thorough research and consider various factors before making any decisions. Like all cryptocurrencies, Etheruem remains highly volatile and risky, and may not be suitable for everyone.\n\nThe purchase of cryptocurrencies is not suitable for all individuals, and it is advised to exercise caution, conduct independent research, and carefully assess the considerable risks involved prior to engaging in any crypto acquisitions. People from the United States, Canada, countries that are under sanctions, and other blocked countries are not permitted to procure ApeMax coins.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA new protocol that lets people create and share digital objects on Ethereum has hit a major setback, according to its creator, who said the Ethscriptions main marketplace had been hacked.\n\nLaunched last month by Tom Lehman, co-founder and former CEO of Genius.com, Ethscriptions is a novel way to create Ethereum assets that leverage transaction \u201ccalldata\u201d to write non-financial data to the network\u2019s blockchain.\n\nThe Ethscriptions\u2019 protocol itself and other applications that tap the technology haven\u2019t been impacted, Lehman said. Yet, a sizable number of Ethscriptions listed on Ethscriptions.com have been stolen, Lehman said on Twitter on Friday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAbout 123 individual addresses lost a total of about 202 ethscriptions in this exploit,\u201d he said. \u201cAny young protocol will have bumpy landings, but this is definitely not what I meant.\u201d\n\nhttps://t.co/ZcR9HKlexS Marketplace Security Incident Update In this Tweet I\u2019m going to walk you through how the exploit happened and what we are doing about it. First, to be clear, this was not a vulnerability in the Ethscriptions Protocol. This was a vulnerability in one\u2026 pic.twitter.com/i5Q0W2PRMQ \u2014 Middlemarch (@dumbnamenumbers) July 12, 2023\n\nIn terms of value, it\u2019s unclear exactly how much was lost in connection with the exploit. But according to data from NFT marketplace OpenSea, some inscriptions have sold for as much as 5 Ethereum or around $9,600 in the past month.\n\nLehman told Decrypt that, regarding the Ethscriptions lost, \u201cit\u2019s all terrible,\u201d but he specifically lamented the theft of Ethscription #56, describing it as \u201cbrutal\u201d and pointing to the rarity often ascribed to earlier artifacts.\n\nThe exploit also has a particular sting, Lehman said, because it was meant to serve as an example that other marketplaces building out support for Ethscriptions could lean on.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the marketplace was basically to help show other people how to create marketplaces and help build an ecosystem,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, we fell on our face in that area.\u201d\n\nLehman claimed responsibility for the failure, explaining the exploit could be traced to a smart contract that he and Indelible Labs co-founder Michael Hirsch created. A snippet of code allowed people to withdraw Ethscriptions that they didn't own from the marketplace.\n\n\u201cPart of the challenge with this new protocol is that you save a bunch of money from limiting the use of smart contract storage, but then you have to be more strategic surrounding how you use contracts in cases like marketplaces,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to figure out a way to either give smart contracts information or make it so smart contracts don\u2019t need that information.\u201d\n\nThe Ethscriptions.com marketplace will be relaunched once necessary changes are made to the protocol itself, according to Lehman, who said he\u2019s been in contact with many of those impacted by the exploit. He praised them on Twitter as \u201cthe earliest adopters\u201d of the Ethscriptions protocol.\n\nEthscriptions are distinct compared to traditional NFTs, stored in transaction-level data as opposed to being tokens issued on Ethereum by smart contracts, like in the case of the ERC-721 token standard. According to a Dune Analytics dashboard, around 474,000 Ethscriptions have been created so far.\n\nThe protocol\u2019s emergence follows Ordinals\u2019 rise in popularity, used for creating NFT-like assets on Bitcoin, which has led to a new wave of experimentation with crypto\u2019s oldest coin.\n\nLehman drew attention to the exploit on July 14. Days later, a disclaimer about the impacted state of the marketplace remains. A warning on Ethscriptions.com reads, \u201cThere is an issue with the marketplace contract! Withdraw your Ethscriptions and do not create new listings!\u201d"

While these cryptocurrencies have delivered impressive returns in the past, some experts believe that their exponential growth may be slowing down.\n\nHowever, amidst this scenario, a new contender is emerging with the potential to outpace Bitcoin and Ethereum: InQubeta and its native QUBE token.

Ethereum, on the other hand, has revolutionized the blockchain industry with its smart contract capabilities and the development of decentralized applications (DApps).

Token holders have governance rights, allowing them to shape the project\u2019s future and direction. This decentralized approach not only strengthens the project\u2019s resilience but also instills a sense of ownership and involvement among investors.\n\nQUBE\u2019s Unique Value Proposition:\n\nQUBE brings several key features to the table that differentiate it from other cryptocurrencies. Its fractionalized NFT approach allows investors to own fractions of AI-driven assets, promoting inclusivity and increasing accessibility. By breaking down barriers to entry, QUBE enables a broader range of investors to participate in AI-driven projects and benefit from their potential growth.\n\nAdditionally, InQubeta leverages blockchain technology to enhance security and transparency.

This focus on security builds trust within the community and sets QUBE apart as a reliable investment opportunity. While Bitcoin and Ethereum may have already reached a level of maturity, QUBE presents an opportunity for exponential growth in the crypto market. Don\u2019t Miss Out On QUBE Presale\n\nInQubeta (QUBE) is currently in its presale which has raised over $1.4 million within a few weeks of launch. The presale has attracted both institutional and retail investors due to its low barrier of entry and multiple payment options. InQubeta has also revealed plans to launch a staking dapp for QUBE holders to stake their assets for rewards, an NFT marketplace and a unique DAO for decentralized governance.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum may continue to play essential roles in the crypto market, QUBE\u2019s innovative features and growth potential make it a compelling option for investors seeking exponential gains in the near future.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Next Big Crypto Coin After Ethereum & Solana \u2013 Could It Be Scorpion Casino Token?\n\nGoing through the journey of discovering the next big crypto coin in the captivating realm of blockchain, it\u2019s clear that Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have emerged as two prominent players. Since their launch, both tokens have experienced remarkable growth, attracting the attention of investors worldwide. Their price fluctuations, ranging from all-time lows (ATL) to its all-time highs (ATH), offer a nuanced perspective on altcoin trajectories.\n\nBy studying these fluctuations, crypto enthusiasts gain insights into market dynamics and can make informed predictions about the future. Among the newcomers, Scorpion Casino Token (SCORP) exhibits tremendous potential in becoming the next big crypto coin set for explosive growth in 2023.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Revolutionising Smart Contracts\n\nIn the realm of cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH) stands out as a pioneering force behind smart contracts. This decentralised platform introduced a revolutionary concept of executing programmable transactions, transforming the blockchain industry. With Ethereum, developers can create and deploy decentralised applications (DApps) and leverage the power of smart contracts, unlocking a world of innovative possibilities.\n\nETH\u2019s vast and active developer community is one of its key strengths. This thriving ecosystem fosters continuous innovation and improvement, solidifying Ethereum\u2019s position as a reliable choice for individuals and enterprises seeking to harness the potential of blockchain technology.\n\nThe price trajectory of Ethereum from its all-time low (ATL) to all-time high (ATH) has been remarkable. Since its launch, ETH has witnessed several price cycles. Starting at a mere $0.43 in 2015, Ethereum reached an astonishing ATH of over $4,000 in 2021, generating substantial returns for early investors and demonstrating its immense growth potential.\n\nSolana (SOL): Empowering High-Performance Applications\n\nSolana (SOL), a relatively newer player in the market, has garnered significant attention to become the next big crypto coin for its exceptional ability to handle high-performance applications with lightning-fast transaction speeds. Its innovative approach to scalability and throughput sets it apart from other cryptocurrencies, positioning SOL as a strong contender for future success.\n\nSOL\u2019s unique architecture, combining Proof of History and Proof of Stake mechanisms, enables unprecedented scalability and efficiency. By overcoming traditional blockchain limitations, Solana empowers developers to build complex applications without compromising on speed or security.\n\nThe price trajectory of Solana has been nothing short of extraordinary. Since its inception, SOL has experienced substantial value surges, particularly in 2021. Starting at an ATL of $0.22, Solana soared to an ATH of over $200, showcasing an exponential increase in price and offering significant returns on investment opportunities.\n\nThe Future Potential of Scorpion Casino Token (SCORP) | Next Big Crypto Coin?\n\nScorpion Casino Token (SCORP) presents an enticing investment opportunity with its burn/deflationary model. This unique mechanism involves the periodic removal of tokens from circulation with each transaction and profit from its platform, Scorpion Casino, used to burn existing tokens. By gradually reducing the total supply over time, this approach creates scarcity and enhances the token\u2019s value, incentivizing long-term holders.\n\nAlthough SCORP is currently in its presale stage, it has already gained substantial attention, thanks to its association with an established platform. The integration of SCORP within an existing ecosystem provides immediate utility and opens up a wide range of potential use cases. This association not only adds credibility to the token but also unlocks numerous growth and adoption opportunities.\n\nIn light of SCORP\u2019s burn/deflationary model, which involves systematically reducing the token supply over time, coupled with its close partnership with an established platform, the potential for SCORP\u2019s future success becomes increasingly evident. Its unique features and promising growth trajectory position SCORP as an attractive investment option for those seeking the next big thing in the crypto market.\n\nExploring the Future of Cryptocurrency\n\nEthereum and Solana stand as two remarkable players in the cryptocurrency industry. Ethereum\u2019s trailblazing role in smart contracts and its robust developer community make it a reliable and established choice. Meanwhile, Solana\u2019s impressive scalability and throughput capabilities position it as a high-performance solution for decentralised applications.\n\nLooking ahead to the future, Scorpion Casino Token (SCORP) emerges as a cryptocurrency with immense potential. Its burn/deflationary model, connection to an established platform, and the substantial adoption it has already witnessed set the stage for significant success. As investors and enthusiasts search for the next cryptocurrency to explode in 2023, SCORP undoubtedly deserves attention.\n\nBy understanding the unique features, price trajectories, and growth potential of Ethereum, Solana, and Scorpion Casino Token (SCORP), investors can make informed decisions about discovering the next big crypto coin and explore the exciting world of cryptocurrency with confidence.\n\nScorpion Casino Token (SCORP):\n\nPresale: https://presale.scorpion.casino/\n\nWebsite: https://scorpion.casino/Casino\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/scorpion.casino\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

While the L2 solution will tap into Optimism\u2019s modular software, it will have some key differentiators.\n\nThese will include a decentralised sequencer powered by Celo blockchain\u2019s existing validator set; off-chain data availability and a design that retains the 1-block finality currently in use.

This means native CELO will remain the governance tool for the ecosystem and holders will control both core contracts and validator set via governance vote, staking and election.\n\nCELO traded at $0.57 on Monday morning, about 10% up in the past 24 hours and 18% in the past week. Year-to-date highs near $0.90 was reached in February. However, the token\u2019s price remains more than 94% from its all-time high of $9.82 reached in August 2021."

        "content": "Celsius, the bankrupt crypto lender, has started selling its non-Bitcoin and non-Ethereum crypto assets, records on July 17 indicate. According to on-chain data from Lookonchain, Celsius has transferred approximately $23.5 million of various cryptocurrencies, including BNB, ZRX, LINK, BONE, and SNX, to FalconX and OKX, respectively.\n\nDifferent amounts of these tokens were transferred by Celsius, a move that, while it could be positive for creditors, may impact the token valuations of those projects.\n\nCelsius Selling Altcoins\n\nLookonchain revealed that Celsius moved $8.5 million worth of LINK, the native currency of Chainlink, a middleware protocol linking on-chain smart contracts to external but verified data. At the same time, it also moved $7.84 million worth of SNX, the native token of Synthetix, a protocol allowing users to trade derivatives called synths, was transferred.\n\nCelsius also went on to move $3 million worth of BNB, the coin behind the sprawling Binance ecosystem, $2.26 million worth of 1INCH, the token aggregator, and $1.9 million worth of ZRX, the token behind one of the first decentralized finance platforms, Ox Protocol.\n\nThe bankrupt lender also moved $709,678 worth of FTT, the token behind the collapsed FTX exchange, to FalconX. In response, FalconX has started depositing these tokens to Binance for selling.\n\nThe only token moved to a different exchange was BONE, where Celsius moved $235,000 of the meme token to the popular cryptocurrency exchange, OKX.\n\nWhile OKX caters to retail and institutional investors, FalconX serves institutional investors, offering diverse services, including liquidity provision and risk management. So far, a large tranche of tokens held by Celsius has moved through FalconX.\n\nIn late June, Judge Martin Glenn of the Southern District of New York allowed Celsius to start converting all their tokens to either Bitcoin or Ethereum, the two currencies that would be allowed to pay back creditors. All conversions were set to begin on July 1.\n\nAltcoins Taking A Hit\n\nThe transfer also comes amid a favorable ruling that saw a US Judge say XRP, one of the major altcoins, is not a security and can be traded like a commodity, just like Bitcoin. However, even though news pumped altcoins, mostly XRP, momentum tapered during the weekend, and most altcoins fell back from last week\u2019s highs.\n\nRelated Reading: XRP Whales Ride The Crypto Surge, As Ripple Token Notches 62% Price Spike\n\nAmong the impacted tokens included BNB, the native currency behind Binance, the world\u2019s largest ecosystem. The coin currently oscillates within a $30 range as bears dominate price action. From the daily chart, BNB has resistance at $260 and is down over 30% from April 2023 highs.\n\nLINK and SNX are seeing similar price actions, both recording losses on the 24-hour chart. LINK is down 2.97% to be trading at $6.63, while SNX is nursing 3.94% losses, bringing its price to $2.64.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethena is a startup that is developing a stablecoin and digital savings bond that will be backed by derivatives.\n\nThe stablecoin will be backed by equal amounts of staked ETH and perpetual swaps shorting Ethereum.\n\nThe project has secured a $6 million seed funding from DragonFly, a venture capital firm founded by Arthur Hayes.\n\nEthena\u2019s stablecoin and savings bond will be built on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring decentralization and transparency.\n\nEthena is not the first project to create a stablecoin backed by derivatives. However, they believe that their approach has the potential to be more successful than previous attempts.\n\nEthena strives to become a pioneer in the crypto industry by developing a stablecoin and digital savings bond. These innovative financial products will be supported by derivatives and will maintain value, in relation to the US dollar without depending on the conventional financial system. Ethena is focusing on creating these offerings for investors outside of the United States.\n\nOne of their products is a stablecoin that has a mechanism to preserve its peg to the US dollar. Additionally they are working on introducing the worlds native savings bond.\n\nFormer BitMex CEO, Arthur Hayes will provide guidance and advice to Ethena. The project secured a $6 million seed funding from DragonFly, a venture capital firm specializing in investments, which was founded by Arthur Hayes himself. Notable participants in this round include crypto derivative exchanges like Deribit, ByBit, OKX, Gemini and Huobi.\n\nThe ultimate objective of Ethena is to establish an alternative to banking systems worldwide. They firmly believe that their stablecoin and savings bond will offer individuals a decentralized and accessible means of preserving and growing wealth.\n\nAccording to Guy Young, the Founder and CEO of Ethena their platform aims to address the immediate need within the crypto space: DeFi endeavors to create a parallel financial system; however stablecoins, which are vital financial instruments in this sector remain completely reliant, on traditional banking infrastructure.\n\n\n\nWe strongly believe that individuals worldwide should have access, to a financial tool, a dollar based savings instrument to securely store their wealth. With our stablecoin we are bringing to life our vision of a native stablecoin that does not rely on traditional banking systems. This enables the creation of an permissionless internet bond.\n\nA breakdown of what Ethena does:\n\n\n\nStablecoin: The Ethena stablecoin will be backed by derivatives holding equal amounts of staked ETH and perpetual swaps shorting Ethereum. This unique approach allows it to maintain its peg to the US dollar without depending on the infrastructure. This improvement addresses some of the limitations found in existing stablecoins which are often susceptible to manipulation and volatility.\n\n\n\nSavings bond: The Ethena savings bond will be a token that function similarly to a US treasury bond. However it distinguishes itself by being permissionless and accessible to individuals around the world. This means that anyone, regardless of their location or financial standing will have the opportunity to invest in the Ethena savings bond.\n\n\n\nDecentralized: Ethenas stablecoin and savings bond will be built on the Ethereum blockchain ensuring decentralization and transparency. This means that there won\u2019t be a single point of failure and people will have control over their funds.\n\nAccessible: Everyone around the world, regardless of their location or financial status, will have access to Ethenas stablecoin and savings bonds. This accessibility is made possible because they will be built on the Ethereum blockchain, a platform that\u2019s source and permissionless.\n\nThis Isn\u2019t The First Time Stablecoins Backed By Derivatives Have Been Created\n\nYou heard it right! In the past there has been attempts to create stablecoins backed by derivatives. One example is Basis Cash, which launched in 2020. Basis Cash tried to maintain its value by relying on a mix of derivatives linked to the US dollar, gold and oil. Unfortunately it failed to maintain its peg and therefore had to shut down in 2021.\n\nAnother failed attempt was IRON Finance, which was launched in 2021. IRON Finance used derivatives tied to the US dollar and Ethereum as its backing. IRON Finance was also shut down in 2021 after it even tually lost $150 million due to a hack.\n\nThe failures of Basis Cash and IRON Finance highlight the challenges in creating a stablecoin backed by derivatives that are both secure and dependable. Ethena presents an approach to leveraging derivatives for stabilizing a coin, which holds the potential, for success.\n\nIn the past there have been challenges, in understanding the complexities of derivatives. This has made it difficult for issuers to effectively manage the risks involved in using derivatives to support a stablecoin.\n\nThe trading costs associated with derivatives can be quite high. This poses a challenge for issuers who need to generate revenue to cover the expenses of maintaining the stablecoins value.\n\nDerivatives are subject to regulations in jurisdictions. This adds another layer of difficulty for issuers as they strive to comply with the rules and regulations.\n\nDespite these obstacles there are advantages in using derivatives as collateral for a stablecoin such as enhanced security, increased reliability and improved efficiency.\n\n\u201cEthena is building the holy grail of stablecoins: a coin that is truly stable, decentralized, and capital-efficient,\u201d said Tom Schmidt, General Partner at Dragonfly. \u201cStablecoins have grown massively in popularity over the past few years by providing access to USD-denominated savings and remittances for people around the world, but they\u2019ve always been handicapped by one of these three issues. Ethena has a breakthrough design that remedies these issues while also benefiting a broad user-base. We\u2019re thrilled to be partnering with them to bring their vision to life.\u201d\n\nEthena plans to utilize the initial investment to get ready for the release of their stablecoin and bond asset in the third quarter of 2023. This includes successfully finishing the testnet phase in Q3 of this year, establishing partnerships with prominent players in the industry and conducting thorough smart contract audits to guarantee the security and efficiency of the protocol."

Boojum is an upgrade that will transition zkSync Era to a STARK-powered proof system, providing world-class performance on consumer-grade hardware.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Learn more:\u2026 pic.twitter.com/1GrwJ5Y07A \u2014 zkSync \u220e (@zksync) July 17, 2023\n\nBoojum to bring enhanced performance and reduced hardware requirements\n\nThe introduction of Boojum brings substantial performance improvements to zkSync Era\u2019s transaction processing capabilities. The new proof system enables faster transaction proofs, allowing the system to prove transactions at an accelerated pace. Moreover, Boojum\u2019s innovative design significantly reduces hardware requirements, making it compatible with consumer-grade GPUs and requiring only 16 GB of GPU RAM. This accessibility enhancement ensures that users with regular hardware can actively participate in the network and contribute to its growth.\n\nBoojum\u2019s upgrade is currently in an experimental phase on the zkSync Era mainnet, generating and verifying \u2018shadow proofs\u2019 using real production data. This comprehensive testing process aims to fine-tune the system, identify potential issues, and mitigate risks before the full migration.\n\nBoojum\u2019s reduced hardware requirements and improved performance are expected to boost zkSync Era and the broader Ethereum ecosystem. The increased accessibility enables a wider range of users to engage with the network, fostering inclusivity and decentralization. By making the proof system compatible with consumer-grade GPUs, Matter Labs is democratizing participation in the network, allowing individuals with regular hardware setups to contribute to the transaction compressing process.\n\nAdditionally, Boojum\u2019s ability to operate with lower hardware specifications opens up cost-effective options for participants. The reduced hardware demands result in more affordable setups, which can positively impact the economics of participating in the zkSync Era network.\n\nThe innovation presented by Matter Labs and zkSync holds the potential to shape the future of Layer 2 scaling solutions, with implications for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and broader blockchain adoption.\n\nThe successful deployment of Boojum on the mainnet in the experimental phase marks a significant milestone for Matter Labs, zkSync, and the entire Ethereum community. As the testing and fine-tuning process progresses, stakeholders eagerly anticipate the full migration and the subsequent impact on scalability, accessibility, and user engagement within the zkSync Era ecosystem."

        "content": "Home \u00bb Journal What Is Ethereum Rainbow Chart & How to Predict ETH Price? Journal What Is Ethereum Rainbow Chart & How to Predict ETH Price? Felix K\u00fcster\n\nMETA DESCRIPTION: The Ethereum Rainbow Chart can be a useful tool for analyzing ETH\u2019s price movements \u2013 learn how it can help you inform your investment decisions.\n\nThe Ethereum Rainbow Chart is a graphical representation of ETH price movements that uses color bands to indicate whether ETH is overvalued or overvalued at any given time. The chart draws data from historical Ethereum price data, presenting it in a logarithmic fashion.\n\nWith Ethereum showing robust bullish activity over the past couple of weeks and the movements in the broader crypto market driven by renewed investor optimism, many investors and Ethereum holders are wondering how ETH might perform in the coming weeks and months.\n\nIn this article, we are going to explain what is the Ethereum Rainbow Chart and how it can be used as a complementary tool to make informed investment decisions.\n\nWhat is the Ethereum Rainbow Chart?\n\nThe Ethereum Rainbow Chart is a graphical representation of Ethereum\u2019s past and potential future price trajectory, offering a streamlined view of the main resistance and support price levels. The chart is modeled using logarithmic regression and uses a color-coded spectrum to represent the different price zones.\n\nThe Ethereum Rainbow Chart allows you to easily analyze historical and future ETH price movements. Image source: CoinCodex\n\nThe colors in the Ethereum Rainbow Chart go from dark red to blue, like in a rainbow, hence the name. The red band is the most expensive, and the blue band is the cheapest. In total, there are nine distinct bands, each showing what a particular price level could mean in a historical context \u2013 if you see that Ethereum is trading in the dark red band, for instance, you can quickly deduce that ETH is heavily overbought and could see a big price correction going forward.\n\nIt is worth pointing out that the Ethereum Rainbow Chart shouldn\u2019t be used as a foolproof prediction tool due to its limitations. It can\u2019t take into account things like current events, software development, investment sentiment, or any other external data points that could have an impact on ETH price. Instead, it relies on historical price movement trends to model future price movements. For this reason, the Rainbow Chart works best as a complementary research tool and shouldn\u2019t be used as an exclusive source of information.\n\nHow to use the Ethereum Rainbow Chart to predict ETH price?\n\nThe idea behind the chart is to help you make better decisions about when to buy or sell Ethereum. For example, if the price of ETH is in the red band, it means that it is very high compared to its historical trend, and it might be a good time to sell some of your ETH and take some profits.\n\nOn the other hand, if the price of Ethereum is in the blue band, it means that it is very low compared to its historical trend, and it might be a good time to buy some Ethereum and hold it for the long term.\n\nEach band on the chart features a self-explanatory description of different ETH price levels. Image source: CoinCodex\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how using the Ethereum Rainbow Chart can come in handy in a real-world setting. Let\u2019s say you might be interested in knowing whether buying ETH at its current price might be worth it based on past price trends. With the price of ETH hovering around $1,850 at the time of writing, we can consult the chart to see how that price compares to historical movements.\n\nIn the image above, we can see that the current price of ETH positions it in the yellow band, which is right in the middle of the pack. This means that Ethereum markets are currently balanced, with no significant overselling or overbuying going on. However, if you are looking to hold ETH for a longer period of time \u2013 for example, till the end of the year \u2013 that same price of $1,850 would position ETH in the \u201cStill cheap\u201d band, signaling that it might be a good price level to enter the position.\n\nIf ETH is trading in one of the higher bands, you should consider selling it and taking profit. Image source. CoinCodex\n\nThese findings can inform your investment decisions and allow you to plan your trades accordingly. As a basic rule of thumb, you should be more willing to sell your ETH when it is in the higher bands and hold onto it or even buy some more when it is in the lower bands.\n\nEthereum Rainbow Chart is a great analytical tool, but make sure to consider its limitations\n\nThe Ethereum Rainbow Chart draws data from nearly 8 years of Ethereum historical price data, providing an easy-to-understand view of ETH\u2019s price movements and its support and resistance levels. Still, the Rainbow Chart relies on historical data exclusively, so it shouldn\u2019t be used as a primary investment resource.\n\nHowever, in combination with a prediction tool like CoinCodex\u2019s Ethereum price prediction algorithm, which takes into account additional technical indicators and the cyclic nature of crypto bull and bear markets, the Rainbow Chart can be a very powerful tool.\n\nGenerally speaking, the price peaks and valleys you can find on the Ethereum Rainbow Chart are largely correlated with Bitcoin\u2019s halving cycle. Usually, the cryptocurrency prices reach their peak about a year into each halving cycle and revisit it every four years. The next BTC halving, the fourth so far, is expected to happen in the spring of 2024. Check the video below to see which cryptocurrencies could be a good investment in light of the next halving event."
