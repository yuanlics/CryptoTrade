        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nGETH, the native asset powering the Ethereum testnet Goerli, is soaring. And that\u2019s a problem.\n\nThe testnet token peaked at $1.60 on Saturday and is now trading, according to CoinGecko, at about $0.31\u2014and the fact that a testnet currency is even listed on price-tracking sites is indicative that something has gone wrong.\n\nMore importantly, though, developers are now turning away from testing their apps on it due to the new costs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum developer \u200b\u200bMarius van der Wijden told Decrypt that the problem isn't new, saying that after almost a year of discussions on how to fix the GETH supply, the easiest solution is to let Goerli \"slowly die.\"\n\n\"That's the intention with all testnets, they should live for a few years,\" van der Wijden said. \"Afterwards it becomes increasingly hard to sync them, so it's not of much use.\"\n\nAccording to him, the plan is to slowly phase out Goerli while moving users to the Sepolia testnet\u2014which is already running but as a permissioned chain and not yet open for anyone to run a validator node.\n\nLaunched in 2019, Goerli is one of several Ethereum testnets that lets developers safely test their code before deploying them on the Ethereum mainnet. To make the testnet environment as real as possible, it also needed a native gas token. That gas token was freely trickled out via so-called faucets and from validators keeping the testnet alive.\n\nTo speed up distribution to developers, crypto project LayerZero enabled trading between mainnet and Goerli to help developers. This move had the side effect of turning GETH into the subject of rampant speculation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs for alternatives, other Ethereum developers, such as Tim Beiko, are proposing a new testnet called Holli, which aims to make it easier for developers to acquire testnet ETH and reduce the need for a secondary market."

        "title": "Ethereum: A Buy Opportunity Is Underway! - Investing Haven",
        "content": "Broad markets and cryptocurrencies are preparing for more volatility, as explained in Leading Indicators Confirming A Pullback Is Underway. The intensity will not be like June nor September of last year, it will be closer to the December pullback. That said, we can clearly see that the next wave of selling will come with a buy opportunity in Ethereum (ETH). This is consistent with our crypto predictions for 2023.\n\nEarlier this month, we predicted that leading indicator Bitcoin was unable to move higher. As explained in Bitcoin: Resolution Comes After Chart Tension Is Cleared:\n\nThat said, what do we see on the Bitcoin chart currently? First, BTC did hit resistance, strong resistance. Any market that is unable to clear resistance will move back to support before it can re-attack resistance. Second, several trendlines coincide in the 19-22k area in the period February & March. This is the \u2018tension\u2019 we were talking about in our introduction. As seen, as of April, there is only one trendline above 22k which suggests that IF Bitcoin is able to get back to 23k in April/May it should be able to clear that resistance level.\n\nWhen both time and price meet resistance, when there is tension on the chart in that time/price combination, there is simply no way that a market can move higher.\n\nIt\u2019s a very simple principle that most investors nor analysts are able to \u2018see\u2019 although it\u2019s there, on the chart, visible, for anyone with an open mind.\n\nThat said, the Ethereum chart is also pretty clear. What we observe is straightforward:\n\nThe 1549-1658 area has lots of resistance. It\u2019s the 3d attempt of Ethereum to clear this area since last summer. We suspect that the 4th attempt will come with a breakout, but only in 4 to 6 weeks from now. Everything will depend on how low ETH will fall. If support at 1336 will hold, in March, we are convinced that ETH will clear 1658 not later than April of this year.\n\nOverall, what we do like most about the Ethereum chart, other than the \u2018details\u2019 outlined above, is that tension is disappearing. The candles are getting smoother, the candles are smaller, the volatility is disappearing. Needless to say, if volatility will pick up (which we expect to happen in the next few weeks) the picture might change but you can clearly see how this current period is getting smoother, certainly when compared to last summer and fall.\n\nIn our crypto research service, we will be tracking relative strength in our watchlist of 30 tokens. We also do expect to hit at least one unicorn (a multi-bagger) before the start of the summer.\n\nReceive our crypto FREE newsletter alerts Download 50 crypto investing tips"

Justin Sun has been actively staking Ethereum on the liquid staking platform Lido Finance ahead of the most-awaited Ethereum Shanghai upgrade in March.\n\nAccording to on-chain data shared by OKLink on February 27, two addresses beginning with 0x176F and 0x611F linked to Tron founder Justin Sun have become the 5th and 6th largest holders of stETH, respectively.\n\nadvertisement\n\nJustin Sun became one of the largest holders as he again staked over 88,000 Ethereum in Lido today through 0x611F. CoinGape earlier reported, Justin Sun staked over 200,000 ETH through 0x176F. His personal staked ETH has exceeded 300K Lido staked ETH (stETH), which is about $500 million.\n\nIt clearly indicates that Justin Sun is bullish on the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade and wants to utilize the opportunity. In fact, Ethereum staking continues to rise as the Shanghai upgrade comes near. Justin Sun has continued to deposit ETH into Lido all through the weekend.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade, Developers Reveal Key Details Ahead Of Sepolia Upgrade\n\nEthereum Staking Rises Ahead of Shanghai\n\nAs per the current on-chain data, over 17.27 million ETH worth $28.67 billion have been deposited into the Beacon Chain. While increasing ETH staking on the Beacon Chain indicates signs of Ethereum security and adoption, Ethereum core developers need to enable withdrawals to maintain a balance on the network.\n\nData from Nansen indicates the number of unique staking depositors stands at roughly 97.2K. Data sourced from BeaconScan shows that the number of active validators has increased to 528,934.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum developers are all prepared for the Shapella (Shanghai/Capella) network upgrade scheduled on the Sepolia testnet at block height 56832, which is expected at 04:04:48 UTC on February 28. It will enable validators to withdraw their Ethereum staked on the Beacon Chain to the execution layer.\n\nEthereum price is currently trading at $1,660, up nearly 4% in the last 24 hours. The 24-hour low and high for the ETH price are $1,599 and $1,661, respectively. Meanwhile, stETH price trades at $1,647, up nearly 3%.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Price Risks Massive Fall As Central Banks Sparks Bearish Sentiment?"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe former head of crypto analysts at ARK Invest, Chris Burniske, shared his outlook on Ethereum's (ETH) price action against Bitcoin (BTC). According to the expert, after two years of consolidation, the market's main altcoin is ready to make a breakout against the market's main cryptocurrency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter almost 2 years of consolidation, $ETHBTC is primed for a monthly breakout. pic.twitter.com/btUzBP9Ew5 \u2014 Chris Burniske (@cburniske) February 27, 2023\n\nThe last time Ethereum had such a price spike was in May 2021. Then, in just over a month, ETH gained more than 150% against BTC, after having been in consolidation for 931 days beforehand.\n\nIf the outbreak Burniske is talking about really does happen, it can be assumed that it will be smaller than last time, considering that the current consolidation lasts a third of the days of the previous one and, therefore, the amount of accumulated \"energy\" is also lower.\n\nEthereum v. Bitcoin\n\nEqually interesting is whether Ethereum will renew its all-time high against Bitcoin in the event of a potential influx of liquidity into it. Currently, that mark is set at 0.1564 BTC per ETH, which is 123% higher than the current altcoin's price.\n\nFinally, a potential price break will answer the question of how close the \"flippening\" is. There has been talk of Ethereum displacing Bitcoin from the throne of the largest cryptocurrency since the very emergence of the market, but at the moment ETH is still only 43% of BTC in terms of capitalization."

With a treasury of around 336,000 ETH, the foundation regularly awards grants to projects that make a significant contribution to the development of the Ethereum ecosystem. In 2021 alone, they allocated $26.9 million to 136 projects! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc40\n\n\n\nConsenSys, a leading software development company, builds decentralized solutions on the Ethereum blockchain.

Additionally, block rewards decreased by nearly 90%, significantly lowering ETH inflation.\n\n\n\nAs of 2022, the number of validators in the Ethereum network has grown by 79%, reaching 495,252. The amount of assets staked has exceeded 15.85 million ETH, with an inflow of around 7 million coins in 2022 alone.\n\n\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is transitioning from a monolithic structure where all transactions are processed at layer 1 to a modular model. More and more decentralized applications are launching on layer 2 networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and others, solving the problem of expensive and slow transfers on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n\n\nMany blockchains like Hedera, Celo, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, and Filecoin, which have been in existence for several years, are betting on compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). According to Hedera's report, \"research shows that EVM is the default starting point for new Web3 developers.\"\n\n\n\nIt is highly likely that the future of blockchain will resemble other operating systems like Windows and Android, with one dominant ecosystem and one or two secondary ones, rather than a fragmented market of many different chains. The older Ethereum becomes, the harder it is to displace from the market.\n\n\n\nIn other news, Ethereum currently has around 122.4 million coins in circulation, with an inflationary model where new coins are emitted daily. Previously, when the network used the PoW consensus algorithm, mining produced around 13,000 ETH per day. Since transitioning to PoS in September 2022, the emission of new coins has been reduced by almost 90% to 1600 ETH per day.\n\n\n\nDespite this, EIP-1559 is still in effect, which means that a portion of ETH coins are burned daily (referring to network fees on Ethereum). If the average gas price in the Ethereum network exceeds 16 gwei per day, more than 1600 ETH will be burned, leading to deflation of the asset.\n\n\n\nEthereum is set to undergo some major changes in 2023. Here's what you need to know:\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Keep up with the daily burning and changing of ETH coins on this resource.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcbb The Shanghai hard fork is expected to take place in March 2023 and will allow for the withdrawal of ETH from staking.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 The implementation of EIP-4844 in 2023 will drastically reduce transaction processing costs in second-layer solutions such as Optimism and Arbitrum by 10-100 times, opening the door to non-financial transactions in gaming, social media, and other industries.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Deflation may be in the cards for Ethereum as the total number of ETH coins in circulation may decrease by 1% in 2023 due to the swift growth of Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 The number of unique addresses in the Ethereum network is growing rapidly year over year.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcbb After the Shanghai hard fork is implemented, staking ETH coins will become more accessible. Currently, only 13% of ETH coins are locked in staking, whereas in other PoS networks, this figure reaches 60%. With the growth of staked coins, the market supply of ETH will decrease.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 2023 will be the first year in which the number of ETH coins in circulation will either remain practically unchanged or decrease (deflation).\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Stay tuned for more information and analysis on these exciting developments!\n\n"

        "content": "A passionate cryptocurrency and blockchain author qualified to cover every event in the crypto space. Researching minute occurrences and bringing new insights lie within the prime focus of my task.\n\nGood morning Asia, Here\u2019s the top crypto news for today:\n\nAfter a quiet weekend, the prices of top cryptocurrencies saw gains on Monday.\n\nBitcoin failed to rise beyond $23,500 and maintained a sluggish trend throughout the weekend. In the meantime, the altcoins also followed the star crypto and maintained a narrow trend. However, the market capitalization slightly raised to $1.07 trillion with a rise of 1.27% but the trading volume remain slashed by 2.63%. Bitcoin dominance is currently 42.19%, with an increase of 0.01% over the day.\n\nWhile Ethereum (ETH) maintained stability within the $1,600 range, other major altcoins such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC) experienced a mix of gains and losses. Among them, NEO token saw the highest increase, with a surge of more than 11 percent in the past 24 hours.\n\nTop Crypto News\n\nSolana network registers the first network outrage for 2023 after recording nearly 8 network halts in 2022\n\nThe network recently faced a slowdown in block production following an upgrade in the validator software, which disrupted the transactions. This further disrupted the transactions and led to the validators downgrading the software. However, the developers restarted the network twice as they had chosen the incorrect point to resume prior.\n\nIMF is in the mood to regulate the Crypto-space instead of an outright ban\n\nIn the wake of the G-20 summit that is to be held in India this year, the IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva said that the agency is in favor of regulating the crypto-space than banning them.\n\nUkraine received more than $70 million in donations in crypto\n\nEver since Russia began its \u2018special military operations\u2019 in Ukraine, the world has imposed multiple sanctions against Russia and donated heavily to Ukraine. Interestingly, Ukraine received $28.9 million in ETH, $22.8 million in BTC, and $11.6 million in Tether."

        "title": "Coinbase Launches Base: New Era for Ethereum Layer-2 Network - This Morning On Chain",
        "content": "Coinbase introduced its own Ethereum layer-2 (L2) network called Base. With ambitions to enable the next million decentralized applications within the next five to ten years, Coinbase obviously thinks it can leverage its over 100M users to take a significant portion of the L2 market. There\u2019s reason to be excited\u2013and skeptical.\n\nWhat Is Base and Why Is It Important for the DeFi Market?\n\nBase is a fork of popular Ethereum L2 Optimism, or as Base puts it: \"a rollup agnostic superchain powered by Optimism\" which processes batches of transactions on a separate chain and pushes information about those transactions to the mainnet, making transactions faster and cheaper than Ethereum. A testnet for Base has been live since the beginning of February, and Coinbase hopes to launch the mainnet in the next few months.\n\nThe L2 market is pretty crowded at this point, but Base is launching without a network token, which is a notable departure from the norm. From being heavy in the DeFi space, I\u2019ve come to believe that having a token is often not a positive for the project. Also, dangling the possibility of an airdrop can help bring on early adopters.\n\nThe Future of Base: Decentralization and Partnerships\n\nCoinbase intends to make the governance of Base fully decentralized, although that won\u2019t be the case initially. Many L1s have launched in a highly centralized space and are still working towards promises of becoming decentralized, and most have made no meaningful progress towards that.\n\nCoinbase is launching Base with dozens of partners committed to building and supporting the ecosystem, including Chainlink, Etherscan, and Aave. I often dismiss \u201cpartnerships,\u201d but it feels a bit more meaningful in this case, since we\u2019re talking about Coinbase.\n\nThe real thing to pay attention to here is how much of the network value add Coinbase is going to be able to capture. If you\u2019re a major company looking to move onto an L2, I\u2019m very confident you\u2019d rather be able to tap into Coinbase\u2019s 100M users who are covered by the industry leader\u2019s KYC and AML protocols than a random L2. My prediction is that Coinbase\u2019s L2 will be the top dog for big industries, assuming the tech is solid, and that means Coinbase would be in a good position to capture a lot more revenue than they already do.\n\nThis is part of an ongoing push by Coinbase to diversify out of a trading volume based revenue model. With the cyclical nature of cryptocurrency trading, that really puts the company in a tough position to predictably plan and grow. Their previous attempt at this was staking services for its customers to bring in \u201csubscription revenue.\u201d Turns out the SEC doesn\u2019t like that model."

        "content": "Liquid staking protocol Lido Finance activated a protocol safety feature called \u201cstaking rate limit\u201d after more than 150,000 Ether (ETH) was staked with the protocol in a single day.\n\nLido is a liquid staking solution for digital assets, allowing users to stake Ether without them needing to have their tokens locked. When a user deposits Ether, Lido issues them a liquid variant of ETH, known as staked Ether (stETH), giving users staking rewards for each day the tokens are held in their wallets.\n\nLido protocol has registered its largest daily stake inflow so far with over 150,000 ETH staked.\n\n\n\nUpon reaching this number, a curious (but important) protocol safety feature called Staking Rate Limit was activated.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s how it works pic.twitter.com/ngBtWz7q18 \u2014 Lido (@LidoFinance) February 25, 2023\n\nAccording to the liquid staking protocol\u2019s Feb. 25 tweet, the \u201cdynamic mechanism\u201d was activated after the daily staking limit of 150,000 Ether was reached.\n\nIn a related guide, Lido explained that the \u201csafety valve\u201d is aimed at limiting the amount of staked Ether that can be minted during high inflows, intended to address any potentially negative effects, such as rewards dilution.\n\n\u201cThis means it is only possible to submit this much Ether to the Lido staking contracts within a 24-hour timeframe,\u201d it explained.\n\nThe mechanism works by limiting the amount that can be minted based on deposits within the last 24 hours, replenishing capacity at 6,200 ETH per hour.\n\n\u201cIt works by decreasing how much total stETH can be minted at any one time based on recent deposits, and then replenishing this capacity on a block-by-block basis,\u201d Lido said.\n\nLido noted the staking rate limit mechanism would affect \u201call parties who may try to mint stETH, regardless of approach.\u201c\n\nEagle eyed on-chain analyst Lookonchain shared a screenshot reportedly showing that the 150,100 ETH may have come from a single user, with three deposits 50,000 each and one of 100.\n\nCaption: An on-chain analyst has discovered that 150,100 ETH may have come from a single user. Source: DeBank\n\nAccording to Lido Finance\u2019s website, as of Feb. 27, more than $8.9 billion in ETH has been staked with the protocol, up significantly from the $5.8 billion reported on Jan. 2.\n\nRelated: SEC\u2019s crypto staking crackdown has uncertain consequences for DeFi: Lido Finance\n\nThe latest development from Lido comes as Ether staking volumes have reportedly continued to rise as the Shanghai upgrade nears. The Ethereum Shanghai upgrade is due in mid-March, leading to speculation about what could happen to the price of Ether.\n\nOne of the five planned upgrades, EIP-4895, is expected to unlock staked ETH and allow withdrawals, potentially leading to increased liquidity in the crypto market.\n\n$25 billion of ETH has been staked since the Beacon Chain was launched and introduced staking to ETH in December 2020."

        "title": "Big Eyes Coin Could Make You A Millionaire, Just Like Bitcoin And Ethereum Did Some Years Ago - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "If you had invested in Bitcoin (BTC) when it launched in 2009, your returns could be in the millions or billions even though your initial capital was $0 because that was the cost of the coin at the time. If you got in a bit later, like when it was 10 cents in late 2010, and invested only $10, you would have been able to buy about 100 bitcoins.\n\nEven at its current low, those 100 bitcoins would be worth more than $2.4 million. Imagine if you had bought more back then.\n\nWe can do a similar calculation with Ethereum (ETH). When it launched in 2015, it first traded at $2.77 but quickly fell in value to $0.81 within 24 hours. Let\u2019s play the \u201cimagine\u201d game again.\n\nSo, if you had spent a mere $100 on day one, you\u2019d have about 36 ETH tokens, or if you bought on day two, you\u2019d have about 123 tokens. At this moment, ETH is valued at $1664.8 per token. Do the math.\n\nWhile the possibility of repeating the success of Bitcoin millionaires is slim, it is not impossible if investors get in early with their investments. Hence, Big Eyes Coin is attracting a lot of interest from smart investors who see the potential for another millionaire-making move.\n\nBig Eyes is already worth over 390%\n\nWe have seen time and again that the earlier investors buy into a cryptocurrency, the greater the profit. For most coins, there is no earlier entry point than their presale journey.\n\nRight now, Big Eyes is making huge waves as a result of how successful its presale has been, which is an indicator of how well the coin can potentially perform when it is launched to the public.\n\nFor a cat-themed meme, BIG has managed to raise $30 million in its 12th stage of the presale and can be bought for a tiny amount of $0.00049. That is still a 390 percent increase from its price of $0.0001 at the first stage. This means that those who bought it at stage 1 will profit by more than 390% of those who buy at stage 12.\n\nThere is still time to take advantage of the opportunity that BIG presents, and getting in now will still be a huge advantage for investors seeing that the presale is typically the lowest amount any coin would be bought for.\n\nBitcoin \u2013 From Zero to thousands\n\nSince its launch in January 2009, the price of bitcoin has been on a roller coaster, but the long-term trajectory has been \u201cup and to the right,\u201d as they say. The advent of Bitcoin marked the beginning of the cryptocurrency era, but it took some time before the general public became aware of it.\n\nNonetheless, it appears that cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin, has emerged as the most intriguing trading opportunity in more than a decade.\n\nThe coin\u2019s value has risen from $0 to $0.40, then to $1 after a few months, and then in 2011, it went to $8 before reaching $30 in the same year. At the time, this was exciting for investors, but even the most optimistic investor had no clue just how big things were going to get. Through a few ups and downs, in April 2013, the coin surpassed $100, and barely eight days later, it was trading at $230.\n\nOver the next few years, BTC flirted with different figures, and by December 2020, BTC was closing the year at $28,949. 2021 was probably the most successful year for Bitcoin investors as the coin rose to an all-time high of $68,789 before the great crash that saw the coin lose value and end at its current price.\n\nEthereum \u2013 another crypto fairytale\n\nAfter Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world. It was introduced in July 2015 and went on sale for $2.77 on August 7. The coin was worth $0.81 the following day. The price stayed below $1 until January 2016.\n\nRemember that the past few years have seen a tremendous increase in the price of digital currencies. In 2021, between January and April, the price of Ethereum increased by about 300%, and the coin surpassed $3000. Yet, even without that jump, you would still be doing well if you had purchased Ethereum at $2.77.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum\u2019s fee market is slowly returning to form amid a recent resurgence in NFT trading activity across the network.\n\nAccording to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the median price for gas powering Ethereum transactions cost roughly 10 to 20 gwei over the past 9 months. This month, that cost had risen to 38 gwei\u2014higher than during key bear market events including FTX\u2019s collapse in November (36 gwei) and Binance\u2019s \u201cbank run\u201d in December (24 gwei).\n\n\u201cThe incremental nature of the gas demand suggests an early resurgence of network activity may be underway,\u201d wrote Glassnode in its weekly newsletter on Monday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGas prices fluctuate with network demand, meaning costs rise as more users seek to include their transactions in the next Ethereum block. In this case, rising activity in Ethereum\u2019s NFT market appears to be a primary source of the newfound demand for gas.\n\nSpecifically, gas used by Ethereum NFT transactions has risen by 97% for two months straight, approaching levels last seen during the \u201cNFT boom\u201d from mid-2021 to mid-2022. Much of that rising activity is thanks to Blur, an NFT marketplace launched in October that\u2019s now overtaken OpenSea in terms of trading volume.\n\n\u201cThe recent attention surrounding Blur has led to a surge in demand for block space, resulting in increased fees for validators, and more ETH being burnt via EIP1559,\u201d explained Glassnode.\n\nOther drivers of NFT activity include all-new projects launched by the industry\u2019s biggest names, including Yuga Labs\u2019 Dookey Dash game and the announcement of Doodles 2 last month.\n\nNevertheless, Ethereum network adoption rate remains low. The number of new addresses being generated is still 40% below what it was 12 months ago. This suggests that the recent revival in NFT activity has been spurred among existing NFT users, rather than new ones.\n\n\n\nNot all corners of the Ethereum ecosystem are seeing rising revenues. In an interview with Decrypt on Friday, Doodle CEO Julian Holguin said that the competition between OpenSea and Blur is constricting cash available to many NFT projects that relied on secondary royalties for revenue.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "The formation of a megaphone pattern in the daily time frame chart shows the Ethereum price is in a state of high volatility and uncertainty among the market participants. Furthermore, the ETH price\u2019s recent reversal from the rising trendline triggered a near-bear cycle /correction phase, which could tumble its price below the $1500 support. Here\u2019s how you may trade this pattern.\n\nKey Points:\n\nA megaphone pattern prolongs a sideways trend in Ethereum price.\n\nUnder the influence of the Megaphone pattern, the Eth price could witness a 9-10 % downfall.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $5.4 billion, indicating a 10% loss.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nadvertisement\n\nAmid the increasing bearishness in the crypto market, the Ethereum price lost 6.75% in six days and tumbled to the current price of $1605. This ongoing bear cycle within the megaphone pattern is likely to cause a downfall below the $1500 support to reach the lower support trendline.\n\nHowever, the lower price rejection candles showcased in the recent price drop indicate that buyers are trying to reclaim the trend control. Thus, if the selling pressure in the market persists, the coin price will rise slightly higher to retest the 20-day EMA or $1660 before continuing the ongoing correction phase.\n\nAlso Read: What Do You Need To Know About Top NFT Discord Servers?\n\nHowever, for the Ethereum price to escape a sideways trend, it must breach the trendlines of the megaphone pattern.\n\nAs the prior trend before the ongoing consolidation was bullish, the Ethereum price is more likely to break the overhead trendline and resume that rally.\n\nThis potential breakout may push the coin price to the $2000 mark.\n\nTechnical Indicator\n\nBollinger Band: The falling Ethereum price plunged below the indicator\u2019s midline, reflecting an additional confirmation for potential downfall.\n\nMACD: a slow but gradual spread between the MACD(Blue) and the signal(orange) line indicates the increasing bearish momentum in the market.\n\nEthereum Coin Price Intraday Levels-\n\nSpot rate: $1600\n\nTrend: Slightly Bullish\n\nVolatility: High\n\nResistance level- $1680 and $1788\n\nSupport level- $1500 and $1420"

        "title": "Why This Polygon Layer-2 Is Huge For Solana Developers - NewsBTC",
        "content": "In what could be a huge relief for developers, the Eclipse Foundation recently announced the launch of the Polygon Sealevel Virtual Machine (SVM).\n\nEclipse To Release The Polygon SVM\n\nThe Polygon SVM is a roll-up platform designed for the Ethereum sidechain but is compatible with Solana. Its creators say Solana is a high throughput, fourth-generation network compatible with Ethereum.\n\nThe Polygon SVM relies on Optimistic roll-ups, a technique that bundles transactions off-chain before confirming later on the mainnet. The objective is to enhance scalability and lower transaction fees, a net positive for developers wishing to deploy smart contracts.\n\nDevelopers believe the release of the Polygon SVM is to encourage Solana developers to bridge over to the Ethereum sidechain. As they do so, they won\u2019t have to build their code to be compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Polygon is an Ethereum sidechain and is, therefore, by default, compatible with Ethereum.\n\nThe roll-up used, in this case, will be launched on Avail, which is Polygon\u2019s general-purpose data availability layer. Avail uses KZG commitments to proof blocks and was released in June 2021. In this arrangement, Polygon will communicate directly with Solana and the Ethereum mainnet through a cross-chain bridge. Consequently, developers will have the flexibility of deploying their dApps on Polygon.\n\nAs a result, developers running Solana dApps can deploy on Polygon because the SVM provides a coding environment that allows the launching of Rust-based solutions on several blockchains, including Polygon.\n\nTo do this, Solana developers will first have to transfer their code to Eclipse, from where it will be run on Polygon. With this provision, it can be settled back on Solana, meaning there will be higher levels of security.\n\nThe Polygon SVM will release its testnet in late Q1 2023, with the mainnet scheduled in H2 2023.\n\nThe Migration From Solana\n\nThis solution comes when Solana has been under extreme pressure following the collapse of FTX, the crypto exchange, and Alameda Research, the trading wing associated with the defunct ramp. Though there was no direct connection between the FTX and Alameda Research, and Solana, the former holds millions worth of SOL, the native currency of Solana.\n\nThe subsequent devaluation of SOL, as investors feared that FTX and Alameda Research would offload their bag, impacted the Solana ecosystem.\n\nSome projects have migrated to Polygon in the past few weeks after receiving incentives.\n\nHere is a screenshot of our latest @y00tsNFT Discord announcement. pic.twitter.com/qWxjBsexv6 \u2014 frankdegods.eth (@frankdegods) January 6, 2023\n\nFor example, early this year, DeLabs, the creator of Y00ts, was awarded a $3 million grant to build on Polygon.\n\nFeature image from Canva, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Testnet Ether on Goerli Skyrocketed By 673%, Devs Propose New Plan - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "The Goerli testnet is a popular cross-client proof-of-authority testing network for Ethereum but is otherwise an entirely separate entity from the Ethereum ledger. It was established in March 2019. Tests are being run on applications before their final deployment on the mainnet.\n\nTraders can also send tokens from other chains to Goerli. The tokens used are the testnet version of the actual ether and are supposed to be free for the developers.\n\nGoerli\u2019s distribution method for native ETH (GoETH) has been a major bone of contention since its distribution is primarily in the hands of a few validator entities. They distribute a small amount of GoETH. The traditional approach uses services called faucets to gain testnet tokens, which is deemed inconvenient by many.\n\nNew Approach\n\nIn response, a cross-chain platform LayerZero designed a way for Goerli\u2019s testnet ether to be traded and swapped between the Ethereum mainnet and the testnet. The focus is to enable devs to purchase testnet ether directly from the decentralized exchange, Uniswap.\n\nThe LayerZero developers launched a cross-chain liquidity pool that allows users to buy GoETH to quell concerns about acquiring the token. But critics have warned against the new approach of monetizing the native currency of a testnet and believe that such a mechanism will end up threatening the free nature of the testnet.\n\nIn fact, the price of the testnet ether shot up to $1.60 on Saturday, increasing by more than 673% since trading at $0.15 around the end of last week. The token has lost much of its value since but is still trading near $0.31.\n\nUniswap founder Hayden Adams called out those buying the token and warned that it will lose support from the testnet in his latest tweet,\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re buying goerli eth, why in the actual hell are you doing that. Y\u2019all know it\u2019s a deprecated and soon to be fully unsupported testnet right? That said, always fun to have weird things happen on uniswap.\u201d\n\nFollowing the development, Polygon\u2019s Chief Information Security Officer, Mudit Gupta, also chimed in and stated,\n\n\u201cGoerli eth is trading for ~$0.69. Not nice. Testnet ether is supposed to be free but is being marked up by speculators. Keyboard warriors will tell you that the developers are buying it but no, they are not. Maybe 0.1% are buying for consumption. This is the start of the end of the Goerli testnet. It served us well.\u201d\n\nPotential Solution\n\nAcquisition of testnet ether has become a major problem. To address this, a solution has now been proposed by Ethereum core dev Tim Beiko to develop a new testnet called Holli. This one, speculated to be released later this year, is expected to improve the testing environment for client and application devs as well as node operators."

        "content": "A mysterious Ethereum (ETH) wallet worth some $400 million has caught the attention of crypto Twitter. Community members now wonder whether the key is lost, or if the owner is just waiting to make a market-shaking move with the massive stack.\n\nThe mystery wallet was created during Ethereum\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) in 2014, and has never made a transaction. By simply \u2018hodling\u2019, the wallet has seen a massive increase in the US dollar value of its ETH tokens, in addition to accumulating more tokens through airdrops.\n\nAmong the airdrops is a large Ethereum Classic (ETC) airdrop that added 250,000 ETC tokens to the owner\u2019s address. The 250k ETC alone are now worth some $5.3 million at the current exchange rate.\n\nEthereum Classic is the original Ethereum chain from before Ethereum underwent a hard fork as a result of a critical hacking incident in 2016, the so-called DAO hack.\u201cOne of the most mysterious addresses\u201d\n\nDetails about the wallet were shared on Twitter this weekend by Conor Grogan, Coinbase\u2019s Product Strategy Director and a former Senior Manager at Ray Dalio\u2019s hedge fund Bridgewater Associates.\n\nGrogan called the wallet \u201cone of the most mysterious addresses in all of crypto.\u201d\n\nThe wallet bought $75k of ETH during the Ethereum ICO (initial coin offering) in 2014, but has since remained \u201ccompletely untouched,\u201d Grogan wrote in his tweet.\n\n\u201cImagine the mental fortitude of holding through multiple bull and bear markets,\u201d he added, but also admitted that \u201ca far more likely outcome\u201d is that the private keys to the wallet are lost.\u201cDead or lost key\u201d\n\nJudging from the majority of commenters on Twitter, it appears Grogan\u2019s explanation is also the consensus view, and that the owner is simply unable to move the funds.\n\n\u201cDead or lost key. Mystery solved,\u201d wrote the popular user @notsofast, while accusing Rogan of using the wallet mystery for \u201cengagement farming.\u201d\n\nOther users agreed, with many suggesting that the owner is dead.\n\n\u201cRIP the owner who forgot to tell his wallet access info before he passed away,\u201d one user wrote.\n\nAnother user suggested that a technical glitch during the Ethereum ICO may have caused an \u201cunspendable error.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know a couple 1 BTC investments that are forever gone with it,\u201d the user suggested, before another jokingly said the wallet has got to be the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s retirement plan\u2026"

        "content": "In the world of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) remain the largest digital assets based on market capitalization and are known to dictate the trajectory of the entire market. However, the distribution of these cryptocurrencies is vastly different, with Ethereum having a significantly higher percentage of its supply held by whales compared to Bitcoin.\n\nIn particular, as of February 26, 2023, around 39% of the total supply of Ethereum is concentrated among large addresses, data by crypto market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock\n\nEthereum concentration by large holders. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nThis is in stark contrast to Bitcoin, where large addresses hold only 11% of the total supply.\n\nBitcoin concentration by large holders. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nIndeed, contraction by holders metric aggregates the share of circulating supply held by whale addresses, accounting for over 1% of the supply and investors or addresses holding between 0.1%-1%. The combination of the two metrics equates to the total concentration by large holders.\n\nEthereum\u2019s onchain activity\n\nEthereum\u2019s large address concentration coincides with the network\u2019s increased development activity. The staking feature remains the main highlight for the decentralized finance ecosystem following the historical Merge upgrade.\n\nAfter months of testing, investors are set to start withdrawing their staked ETH in March after the Shanghai upgrade goes live.\n\nAlthough the high concentration of Ethereum whales has different implications, it could hint at the investors\u2019 future price outlook for the asset. It is worth noting that as Ethereum undergoes significant developments, proponents still bet the asset might flip Bitcoin.\n\nAt the same time, it can be argued that Ethereum is relatively cheap compared to Bitcoin, making it affordable to amass in large amounts.\n\nImplication of whale addresses\n\nThe concentration of crypto wealth in the hands of a few large holders is a controversial topic in digital asset circles. Some argue that it is a natural outcome of the market and that wealthy individuals should be allowed to hold large amounts of digital assets.\n\nOthers, however, argue that this concentration of wealth goes against the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrency and could lead to market manipulation.\n\nRegardless of varied opinions on the matter, the fact remains that Ethereum\u2019s supply is significantly more concentrated in the hands of a few large holders compared to Bitcoin. This could have important implications for the future of the Ethereum ecosystem and its price.\n\nBy press time, Ethereum was trading at $1,645 with daily gains of over 4%, while Bitcoin is trading at $23,657.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
