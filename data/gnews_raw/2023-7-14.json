        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAmerica's largest crypto exchange Coinbase today said in a statement that it stands by staking and that it will fight the service in court\u2014but would stop staking for new customers in California, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Wisconsin.\n\nIn a Friday statement, the San Francisco-based digital asset company that \"Americans in every state deserve access to the same technology and economic opportunities as people everywhere,\" and therefore it would push back against certain states requiring a staking ban.\n\n\n\nBut for now, customers in the four states will be unable to stake additional assets through Coinbase while these actions are pending.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"Due to the actions taken by state regulators in California, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Wisconsin, customers in those states will be unable to stake additional assets through Coinbase while these actions are pending,\" the company said, adding that customers' crypto that was staked before these orders were issued remains unaffected.\n\nThe news comes after U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last month sued Coinbase for allegedly failing to register as an exchange, clearing house, and broker despite providing investors these services.\n\nWall Street's biggest regulator also alleged that Coinbase offered and sold unregistered securities via its staking service.\n\nShortly afterwards, a multi-state task force that includes California, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin along with Alabama filed charges against the company for violating securities laws.\n\nStaking is the process of \"locking-up\" cryptocurrency to keep a blockchain\u2019s network running. Those who hold proof-of-stake assets\u2014such as Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization\u2014pledge it to the network by sending it to a specific blockchain address and can receive rewards for doing so.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut it\u2019s a controversial issue: The SEC in February hit American crypto exchange Kraken with a $30 million fine for allegedly failing to register the offer and sale of its crypto asset staking-as-a-service program.\n\n\n\nEditor's Note: This post was corrected reflect that 10 states are alleging Coinbase has violated securities laws."

        "content": "Welcome to Finance Redefined, your weekly dose of essential decentralized finance (DeFi) insights \u2014 a newsletter crafted to bring you the most significant developments from the past week.\n\nThis week, Finance Redefined looks at the growing popularity of zero-knowledge proof-based scalable solutions. Zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups) technology has gained a lot of traction over the past year thanks to its increased use in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nBug bounties are seen as a great reward system for white hat hackers to weed out bugs in the DeFi ecosystem, which often fall prey to exploits. However, recent analysis suggests these programs have mixed results.\n\nAfter a series of exploits on the Multichain protocol over the past couple of weeks, the founder of Connext proposed a \u201cSovereign Bridged Token\u201d standard to prevent future issues and exploits.\n\nAlgorand\u2019s decentralized lending protocol is set to wind down by year-end as developers claimed building a borrowing and lending protocol is \u201cno longer a viable path\u201d for the protocol.\n\nThe top 100 DeFi tokens had another mixed week in terms of price action, followed by a late surge on July 13, aided by the partial verdict for Ripple in its fight against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), leading to an 84% surge in the XRP (XRP) price.\n\nEthereum scaling protocols drive zero-knowledge proof use in 2023\n\nEthereum scaling protocols dominate the use of ZK-rollups, with major launches, new research and healthy competition among the key highlights in a sector report published by ZKValidator.\n\nThe node infrastructure operator\u2019s \u201cState of ZK Q2\u201d report reflects on significant events across the ZK ecosystem, with notable launches of ZK-powered layer 2\u2019s highlighting the use of the technology for scaling in comparison with other market segments.\n\nContinue reading\n\nAlgorand decentralized lending protocol Algofi to shut down by end of 2023\n\nAlgofi, the borrowing and lending protocol built on the decentralized finance blockchain Algorand, will soon shut down.\n\nAccording to a July 11 announcement, developers\u2019 \u201cbelief in the strength of Algorand\u2019s technology and novel consensus algorithm has not wavered,\u201d however, the Algofi platform will wind down soon.\n\nContinue reading\n\nBug bounties can help secure blockchain networks, but have mixed results\n\nBug bounties are programs organizations offer to incentivize security researchers or ethical or white hat hackers to find and report vulnerabilities in their software, websites or systems. Bug bounties aim to improve overall security by identifying and fixing potential weaknesses before malicious actors can exploit them.\n\nOrganizations that implement bug bounty programs typically establish guidelines and rules outlining the scope of the program, eligible targets and the types of vulnerabilities they are interested in. Depending on the severity and impact of the discovered vulnerability, they may also define the rewards offered for valid bug submissions, ranging from small amounts of money to significant cash prizes.\n\nContinue reading\n\nArbitrum-based Rodeo Finance exploited for the second time, $1.5 million stolen\n\nArbitrum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Rodeo Finance was exploited for $1.53 million on July 11. The DeFi protocol was exploited using a code vulnerability in its Oracle, leading to a loss of over 810 Ether (ETH). Rodeo Finance was earlier exploited on July 5 for around $89,000 due to a vulnerability in its mintProtocolReserves function.\n\nAccording to data shared by blockchain analytic firm PeckShield, the exploiter later bridged the stolen funds from Arbitrum to Ethereum and swapped 285 ETH for unshETH. The exploiter then deposited the ETH on Eth2 staking. Finally, the exploiter routed the stolen ETH using the popular mixer service Tornado Cash, which exploiters often use as an exit route to obscure the transaction\u2019s footprint.\n\nContinue reading\n\nConnext founder proposes \u2018Sovereign Bridged Token\u2019 standard after Multichain incident\n\nA July 7 Ethereum improvement proposal (EIP) seeks to standardize how tokens are bridged between networks. The \u201cSovereign Bridged Token\u201d standard, or EIP-7281, allows token issuers to create canonical bridges across multiple networks.\n\nThe proposal was co-authored by Arjun Bhuptani, founder of the Connext bridging protocol. In a July 7 social media post, Bhuptani claimed the protocol would help prevent issues like the July 6 Multichain incident, which some experts have described as a hack.\n\nContinue reading\n\nDeFi market overview\n\nDeFi\u2019s total market value saw a bullish surge after three bearish weeks. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that DeFi\u2019s top 100 tokens by market capitalization had a bullish week, with most tokens trading in the green.

        "content": "Ethereum price is up over 7% and trading above $2,000 against the US Dollar. ETH gained pace after XRP jumped over 80% and cleared $0.90.\n\nEthereum is up over 7% from the $1,850 support zone.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,980 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a key contracting triangle with resistance near $1,885 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could rise further toward the $2,050 and $2,120 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Aims Higher\n\nEthereum\u2019s price remained well-bid above the $1,850 zone. ETH started a decent increase after XRP surged over 50%. There was a move above the key $1,890 resistance zone. Many altcoins, including MATIC, SOL, BNB, and ADA gained handsomely in the past few hours.\n\nThere was also a break above a key contracting triangle with resistance near $1,885 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair gained over 7% and even surpassed the $2,000 resistance zone. A high is formed near $2,027 and the price is now consolidating gains.\n\nEther is trading above $1,980 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is also well above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,865 swing low to the $2,027 high.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nOn the upside, immediate resistance is near the $2,025 level.

        "content": "Aave, the leading DeFi lending protocol, has launched its long-awaited GHO stablecoin on Ethereum.\n\nAave v3 users on Ethereum can now mint the stablecoin against assets deposited into the protocol. GHO offers a fixed interest rate of 1.5%, with AAVE stakers receiving a 30% discount.\n\nAave DAO\u2019s treasury will receive all fees generated from GHO. Aave v3 users can mint GHO against all collateral assets supplied to the protocol, allowing users to continue earning yield on their assets while accessing dollar-pegged liquidity. The stablecoin\u2019s initial debt ceiling is $100M.\n\n\u201c[GHO] makes borrowing on the Aave Protocol more competitive, provides more optionality for stablecoin users, and generates additional revenue for the Aave DAO by sending 100% of interest payments on GHO borrows to the DAO,\u201d Aave told The Defiant. \u201cThe goal is to create a decentralized and resilient stablecoin with no single points of failure or overexposure to\u2026 centralized or single-set assets.\u201d\n\nThe deployment follows the passing of a governance proposal on July 14 with near-unanimous support. GHO\u2019s code was audited four times before its mainnet launch. The price of AAVE is up nearly 60% in the past month.\n\nAave Launches GHO Stablecoin On Ethereum Mainnet\n\nAave is seeking to capitalize on the demand for a good decentralized option in the stablecoin sector with GHO.\n\nConfidence in incumbent stablecoins was recently rattled, with each of the top four centralized stablecoins briefly depegging this year. The market capitalization of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin and a popular asset among DeFi protocols, also slumped 50% in the past 12 months, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAave said it developed GHO to enable a permissionless web3 financial ecosystem, touting its efficacy for DeFi, cross-border remittances, and micropayments applications.\n\nGovernance and Facilitators\n\nChaos Labs and Gauntlet, Aave DAO Risk Contributors, will take on the role of GHO Risk Steward for the first 60 days after its launch.\n\nPending approval via an accelerated 24-hour governance process, the steward can raise GHO\u2019s debt ceiling by up to 100% or move interest rates up or down by 50 basis points once every five days.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoving forward, the Aave DAO will oversee GHO governance. The DAO can change GHO\u2019s interest rate or debt ceiling, and appoint facilitators \u2014 entities that can trustlessly mint and burn GHO and integrate the stablecoin into other protocols. Prospective facilitators must apply by submitting a governance proposal in Aave DAO\u2019s forum.\n\nAave has already approved three GHO facilitators, starting with Aave v3 on Ethereum. Governance also greenlit the \u201cFlashmint Facilitator,\u201d \u2014 which allows users to take out flash loans, provided borrowing and repayment occur within the same Ethereum block.\n\nAave also said it will soon publish a proposal to launch the GHO Stability Module, which will support GHO\u2019s peg by facilitating one-to-one swaps between it and other stablecoins. Aave said it will also propose a strategy for multi-chain deployment soon.\n\nAave added that it plans to expand the collateral assets supported by GHO to include both \u201cblockchain and non-blockchain assets\u201d in the future.\n\nLens Integration\n\nAave told The Defiant that GHO may also play an important role within the ecosystem of its decentralized social protocol, Lens.\n\n\u201cGHO can be used as a form of payment for various actions that people can take on Lens \u2014 GHO can be unlocked as an asset that can be used for minting, tipping, donating and any other transaction involving payments,\u201d Aave said."

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum\u2019s EIP-4844 upgrade could kickstart a rally in Layer 2 tokens.\n\nThe reduction in gas fees due to the introduction of a new transaction format via this update could significantly help users.\n\nSome altcoins that could potentially rally in anticipation of this upgrade include Optimism, Arbitrum and Polygon.\n\nThe announcement of the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit caused crypto investors to flip bullish after being confused for the last month due to Bitcoin\u2019s rangebound movement. But with Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844 or EIP-4844, things might get interesting for a certain set of altcoins.\n\nRead more: Ethereum Improvement Proposal EIP -4844 turns experts bullish, will ETH price rally?\n\nEthereum gas fees to improve vastly in EIP-4844\n\nEthereum (ETH) has already undergone major hard forks in the last few years, ranging from London Hardfork to the recent Merge upgrade. All of these code changes are aimed at making the Ethereum blockchain more secure and scalable while keeping it decentralized.\n\nThe latest in the line of upgrades is the EIP-4844, aka Shard Blob Transactions update, which is aimed at reducing gas fees by introducing a special transaction type. The official EIP website for Ethereum summarizes the goal of this upgrade as follows.\n\nIntroduce a new transaction format for \u2018blob-carrying transactions\u2019 which contain a large amount of data that cannot be accessed by EVM execution, but whose commitment can be accessed. The format is intended to be fully compatible with the format that will be used in full sharding.\"\n\nThis new transaction formation will be forward-compatible and will be used in future upgrades of sharding.\n\nWhy Layer 2 solutions are in the spotlight?\n\nIn addition to preparing the Ethereum blockchain for full dank sharding, the EIP-4844 will have a huge impact on gas fees. Despite the Merge or London hard fork, the gas fees for Layer 1 (L1) solutions are still high for many users. While Layer 2 (L2) solutions have reduced gas fees by three to eight times than L1 chains, it is still high for many retail investors.\n\nAlthough EIP-4844 is aimed at reducing gas fees for Ethereum\u2019s beacon chain, the benefits of it will inevitably be compounded for Layer 2 scaling solutions. Hence, this update will attract many investors to interact with L2 chains like Optimism (OP), Arbitrum (ARB), Polygon (MATIC/POL) and so on.\n\nWhile this speculative move will improve the fundamentals of L2 chains, it will also attract traders and prospective buyers looking to capitalize, which could trigger a massive rally for these altcoins."

Not only that, but the blockchain\u2019s key network stats also remained stable. While this happened, DOT\u2019s price gained upward momentum, thanks to the bullish market.\n\nRead Polkadot\u2019s [DOT] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nHowever, apart from its network activity and bullish market, quite a few other metrics were also at play that could have served their roles in supporting the uptrend.\n\nPolkadot\u2019s network activity is high\n\nOn 13 July, Polkadot Insider announced that Polkadot had outperformed several cryptos, and was only behind Ethereum in terms of daily active addresses in the last 30 days. While Ethereum had 350,000 daily active addresses, DOT had over 172,000.\n\nArbitrum [ARB], Avalanche [AVAX], and Optimism [OP] completed the top 5 of the list.\n\n\u26cf\ufe0f Let\u2019s explore the Top blockchains by Active Addresses in the past 30 days ?A high Active Addresses indicates a thriving and expanding blockchain ecosystem, highlighting its potential for long-term success and adoption Top 3 include:\n\n? @ethereum: 357,844\n\n? @Polkadot:\u2026 pic.twitter.com/8s2aKFapKa \u2014 Polkadot Insider (@PolkadotInsider) July 13, 2023\n\nIn addition, Token Terminal\u2019s data revealed that the blockchain\u2019s revenue and fees remained stable in the last month. In fact, the graph spiked on 3 July 2023. The blockchain\u2019s network value was also increasing as its TVL rose, as pointed out by DeFiLlama.\n\nWhile these developments happened, Polkadot\u2019s price action turned positive, thanks to the on-going bullish market. As per CoinMarketCap, DOT was up by more than 6% and 9% in the last 24 hours and week, respectively.\n\nAt the time of writing, it was trading at $5.63 with a market capitalization of over $6 billion, making it the 13th largest crypto. A look at DOT\u2019s metrics gave an understanding of what caused this surge.\n\nWhile DOT\u2019s price declined, its Open Interest also went down. Likewise, its price uptrend was accompanied by a hike in volume. Additionally, DOT\u2019s 1-week price volatility was high, supporting the chances of a continued uptrend.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s DOT\u2019s market cap in BTC;s terms\n\nShould DOT investors be cautious?\n\nPolkadot\u2019s uptrend might continue longer as the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Ribbon displayed a bullish crossover. Not only that, but its Relative Strength Index (RSI) was also relatively high, suggesting a continued northbound movement.\n\nNonetheless, though DOT\u2019s Money Flow Index (MFI) was high, it did move down slightly. This can cause trouble and prevent the token\u2019s price from going up further."

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens were going gaga during the trading session on Friday after Ripple's victory with the US SEC in court. Additionally, the upbeat US inflation data stirred the optimism for the global digital assets, which pushed the token to the massive gains.\n\nBitcoin was back in green, posting some big gains. The largest crypto token jumped as much as 4 per cent to hover around $31,500-mark. Its largest peer, Ethereum, outperformed and rose about 8 per cent to top $2,000-levels. However, other altcoins posted robust gains in the last 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin surged to a one-year high above the $31,700 level following a favorable federal court decision for Ripple. BTC has since consolidated and is now trading at the $30,400 level. The month-to-date performance shows a 3 per cent gain, while the year-to-date increase stands at an impressive 89 per cent, said Edul Patel, co-founder and CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\"Soon after this news, XRP reached its highest point in a year within the last 24 hours outperforming the BTC by surging by over 61 per cent. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has also reached a new high by surpassing the $2,000 mark. The current market sentiment appears to be bullish,\" he added.\n\nMajority of the top crypto tokens were trading with masculine gains on Friday with a number of tokens posting double digit gains. XRP rallied 64 per cent, while Solana surged 31 per cent. Cardano gained more than 25 per cent and Polygon advanced 18 per cent. Avalanche and Polkadot added 13 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading sharply higher, surging to $1.26 trillion-mark, as it jumped almost 7 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes zoomed about 121 per cent to $67.66 billion.\n\nThe crypto market has registered massive gains in the last 24 hours. The crypto fear and greed index has jumped 3 points to remain in the greed zone with a score of 60/100. These market gains have been triggered by a US court ruling which is partially in favour of Ripple, said said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures\n\n\"The court has stated that the trading of XRP amongst retail investors can't be dubbed as a 'securities' sale. The SEC continues to hold its stance against the ruling and will likely re-appeal, but overall this has set a strong precedent for the sector and has resulted in a massive rally in prices,\" he added.\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nRipple is currently experiencing a major rally following the victory from SEC v Ripple case, as the Judge ruled Ripple as not a security for retail investors. The asset almost doubled following the news, soaring to as much as $0.94 and is currently trading in the $0.75 range.\n\nFollowing this bullish breakout, after registering short candles for six consecutive days, a pullback can be expected in coming days. The upward shift has propelled the RSI index to the overbought territory and is currently sitting at 78.3.The notable divergence between the 20-day moving average and 100-day moving average suggests bullish momentum over the near term. If the price manages to successfully surpass the $0.85 mark, this could lead to further increase towards the resistance levels of$1.0.\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $0.50, $0.68\n\nResistance: $0.85, $1.0\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

GHO.\n\nAave Companies is moving ahead to launch its new decentralized stablecoin, that will be native to its Aave Protocol, on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nAave said in a release that its new stablecoin (the name is pronounced \u201cgo\u201d) is designed to offer more transparency for users and will be minted through an array of collateral assets held by users across the Aave Protocol. By making use of this mix of assets, Aave says it will offer more flexibility to its users.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRight now, Aave already has pools that users can access for 30 Ethereum-based tokens, including other stablecoins like Tether and USDC. It also offers pools that count real-world assets, like real-estate, that can be tokenized for purchase or held as collateral.\n\nA stablecoin is an entirely digital token that draws its value from its peg to a fiat currency or other asset. For Aave, issuing a stablecoin is meant to improve accessibility for users across its ecosystem at lower cost and improve efficiency within its market.\n\nThe idea of launching GHO first emerged through a proposal to the Aave DAO in June 2022. After receiving the community\u2019s approval to go ahead, it was deployed in February to the Ethereum Testnet, a network used by developers to tinker with their protocols ahead of being deployed.\n\nGHO differs from some of its stablecoin peers, like MakerDAO's DAI, in the way it can be minted through the deposited collateral. Unlike DAI which requires separate vaults for each asset used for minting, different types of GHO collateral can be deposited in one transaction.\n\nTrue to its decentralized nature, Aave\u2019s DAO will be responsible for adjusting interest rates, setting mint caps, and governing who will be allowed to mint GHO based on a set of predetermined conditions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMinting will also be enabled by a set of users Aave calls \u201cfacilitators,\u201d which go through an approval process from the Aave DAO to get this status. Depending on their class, a facilitator will have the ability to mint up to a certain amount of GHO, or offer redemptions between GHO and other assets.\n\nCurrently, the company only intends to launch GHO on Ethereum's mainnet, but the company said it would submit a multi-chain plan to the rest of the community for approval. Specifics weren\u2019t available at the time of writing."

        "content": "CryptoPunks have been back in the news of late. Seedphrase, a DJ who owns the rarest CryptoPunks NFT out there (CryptoPunk #8348), announced this month that he had signed to talent agency WME for a new record release. And in June, Yuga Labs\u2014which acquired CryptoPunks in May 2022\u2014announced that it intended to release a book on the popular NFTs. So what, exactly, is this oddly-named commodity with its pixellated avatars?\n\nYuga Labs Is Writing the Book on CryptoPunks\u2014Literally\n\nThe market for crypto collectibles released as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) exploded in 2021, with $2.5 billion in transaction volume in the first six months as NFTs entered the mainstream.\n\nCryptoPunk DJ Seedphrase Signs to WME, Plans to Release Music\n\nThe boom also saw NFT enthusiasts rediscovering some of the earliest non-fungible tokens, propelling the value of these crypto collectibles to hitherto-unknown highs.\n\nOne of these early NFT projects was CryptoPunks: a set of randomly generated pixel-based avatars. Some of the rarest, most desirable CryptoPunks have sold for millions of dollars. Seriously! By mid-2022, the tokens had seen over $2 billion total sales volume.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about one of the most popular NFT collections around.\n\nWhat are CryptoPunks?\n\nCreated by development studio Larva Labs, CryptoPunks are a series of 10,000 images tokenized as NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. An NFT is effectively a deed of ownership to a digital item, and in this case, holding a CryptoPunks NFT means that you are the sole owner of a one-of-a-kind pixel avatar. As mentioned above, ownership of CryptoPunks changed hands from Larva to Yuga Labs in May 2022. Yuga is the creator of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT.\n\nBeginner's Guide to NFTs: What Are Non-Fungible Tokens?\n\nEach CryptoPunk is randomly generated from a list of dozens of attributes, which means there\u2019s an array of designs: people, zombies, apes, and even aliens. The aliens and zombies are among the most popular avatars that have commanded some of the highest sale prices to date.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhere did CryptoPunks come from?\n\nBelieve it or not, CryptoPunks were released for free back in 2017. Ethereum\u2019s ERC-721 non-fungible token standard wasn\u2019t even a thing at that point, and the two-person team at Larva Labs released them as an experiment. Ethereum wallet owners snatched up the 9,000 CryptoPunks that were released to the public, while Larva Labs held onto the rest.\n\nEthereum NFT CryptoPunks Hit $1 Billion in Total Sales\n\nNFT volume gradually rose over the next three years, but it wasn\u2019t until late 2020 and especially early 2021 that demand skyrocketed for these provably scarce digital collectibles. The secondary market value for CryptoPunks shot through the roof, leading to multi-million-dollar NFT sales, auctions at Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s, and a wealth of CryptoPunks used as Twitter profile pictures.\n\nWhat\u2019s so special about them?\n\nCryptoPunks have some high-profile owners, too, such as rapper Jay-Z, YouTube personality Logan Paul and tennis champion Serena Williams.\n\nOn top of that, there are clear differentiators that make certain CryptoPunks more desirable and valuable to collectors. Alien avatars are the rarest of the randomized images, and as such, alien CryptoPunks are among the most expensive NFTs sold to date. Ape and zombie designs are also in demand.\n\nMost of the CryptoPunks just look like humans with varying features and accessories, however, and the plainer-looking ones are close to the market floor in terms of asking price on NFT marketplaces.\n\nThe future\n\nWhat\u2019s next for CryptoPunks? Well, they will likely continue to change hands on secondary markets, potentially generating huge returns for investors who bought in before the surge.\n\nThere\u2019s no way to tell whether the current level of demand will continue, but the entry-level price for Punks continues to rise. As of July 14, 2023, the average CryptoPunk NFT goes for about 53 ETH (about $2000)\n\nThis story was originally published on January 10, 2022 and was updated on July 14, 2023."

        "title": "Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: BTC bears return with the weekend - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price is likely to record big price changes this weekend because of low trading volume characteristic of weekends. $ 29,872 is critical.\n\nEthereum price could reach $2,120 if whales postponed weekend gratification.\n\nRipple price suffers the brunt of an overbought market, RSI falling below 70 could spell doom for XRP holders.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price remains tightly wound in a range extending from $29,000 to $31,000. Despite the recent uptick in bullishness due to the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit, the pioneer crypto remains the same. Ripple (XRP) bulls seem to be taking a break as the initial hype dissipates, causing altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH), to shed gains.\n\nAlso Read: XRP naysayers miss out on 70% gains after Ripple Labs and SEC share joint victory\n\nBitcoin price faces the weekend\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is entering the weekend at around $31,200 market value. It continues to move horizontally within a range, making the next two days critical in determining the next direction.\n\nWhy?\n\nNormally, BTC performance on weekends is characterized by big price changes and lower volume. Therefore, there are more huge individual orders than small ones, as whales take over during weekends. While retail holders take a break from the market, whales amass or offload in big numbers as they cash in weekend price swings.\n\nAs such, if whales amass into the weekend, the ensuing buying pressure could see Bitcoin price shatter above the $31,500 level and potentially foray toward $35,260.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nConversely, if whales dump, Bitcoin price could break below the critical level at $29,872, opening the drains for a possible dropdown toward the $26,171 range. As BTC eyes a highly volatile two days, bulls must defend the $29,872 level at all costs.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is tipping south, already indicating falling momentum. Lower volume is expected, therefore, as is characteristic of weekends because traditional BTC markets have closed, exposing the market to volatility.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: Can XRP's win take BTC to $40,000?\n\nEthereum price eyes $2,120 if whales let it\n\nEthereum (ETH) price continues to hold above an ascending trendline after breaching a crucial barrier at $1,959 during the Thursday rally that saw ETH ascend 10%. An increase in buying pressure could elevate the PoS token above the $2,000 zone to tag the mid-April highs around $2,120. Such a move would denote an 8% climb from the current level.\n\nThis is plausible, considering momentum indicators favor the upside. The price strength of the RSI above 50 and the positive histograms of the Awesome Oscillators indicate that bulls are leading. While this adds credence to the bullish thesis, a lot depends on how traders play their hand this weekend.\n\nETH/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nOn the flipside, a strong rejection from the psychological $2,012 level could extend the current pullback, causing Ethereum price to flip the newly found support at $1,959 back into resistance. The ensuing seller momentum could see ETH waste all the gains made on Thursday to recollect the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $1,863.\n\nThis would equally denote an 8% downswing from current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Arbitrum unlocks Layer 3 chains as Ethereum Layer 2 wars intensify\n\nRipple price suffers the brunt of an overbought market\n\nRipple (XRP) price is down 5% over the last 24 hours, cutting down on yesterday's gains. Nevertheless, the remittance token has remained at the highest level since April 2022. As profit-taking continues, XRP could soon confirm Welles Wilder's interpretation of an overbought market when the RSI momentum indicator crosses below 70, signaling holders should sell.\n\nThe subsequent selling pressure could see Ripple price drop below the $0.544 support level. A decisive flip of this support back to resistance would invalidate the current bullish outlook.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nOn the other hand, if sidelined investors are looking for an entry point after missing the 70% rally, buying XRP now, could see an influx of upside buying pressure which could revitalize the bulls and hopefully inspire a neck up, hopefully targeting the much-anticipated $1.000.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple price races to $1.0, records the largest crypto asset hourly volume as chatter to list XRP intensify"

        "content": "In brief CryptoPunks is an Ethereum-based NFT project from 2017, making it one of the earliest examples of crypto collectibles.\n\nPrices skyrocketed as the wider NFT market expanded in 2021, leading to numerous sales in excess of $1 million each.\n\nYour Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCryptoPunks have been back in the news of late. Seedphrase, a DJ who owns the rarest CryptoPunks NFT out there (CryptoPunk #8348), announced this month that he had signed to talent agency WME for a new record release. And in June, Yuga Labs\u2014which acquired CryptoPunks in May 2022\u2014announced that it intended to release a book on the popular NFTs. So what, exactly, is this oddly-named commodity with its pixellated avatars?\n\nThe market for crypto collectibles released as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) exploded in 2021, with $2.5 billion in transaction volume in the first six months as NFTs entered the mainstream.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe boom also saw NFT enthusiasts rediscovering some of the earliest non-fungible tokens, propelling the value of these crypto collectibles to hitherto-unknown highs.\n\nOne of these early NFT projects was CryptoPunks: a set of randomly generated pixel-based avatars. Some of the rarest, most desirable CryptoPunks have sold for millions of dollars. Seriously! By mid-2022, the tokens had seen over $2 billion total sales volume.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about one of the most popular NFT collections around.\n\nWhat are CryptoPunks?\n\nCreated by development studio Larva Labs, CryptoPunks are a series of 10,000 images tokenized as NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. An NFT is effectively a deed of ownership to a digital item, and in this case, holding a CryptoPunks NFT means that you are the sole owner of a one-of-a-kind pixel avatar. As mentioned above, ownership of CryptoPunks changed hands from Larva to Yuga Labs in May 2022. Yuga is the creator of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT.\n\nEach CryptoPunk is randomly generated from a list of dozens of attributes, which means there\u2019s an array of designs: people, zombies, apes, and even aliens. The aliens and zombies are among the most popular avatars that have commanded some of the highest sale prices to date.\n\nWhere did CryptoPunks come from?\n\nBelieve it or not, CryptoPunks were released for free back in 2017. Ethereum\u2019s ERC-721 non-fungible token standard wasn\u2019t even a thing at that point, and the two-person team at Larva Labs released them as an experiment. Ethereum wallet owners snatched up the 9,000 CryptoPunks that were released to the public, while Larva Labs held onto the rest.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNFT volume gradually rose over the next three years, but it wasn\u2019t until late 2020 and especially early 2021 that demand skyrocketed for these provably scarce digital collectibles. The secondary market value for CryptoPunks shot through the roof, leading to multi-million-dollar NFT sales, auctions at Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s, and a wealth of CryptoPunks used as Twitter profile pictures.\n\nWhat\u2019s so special about them?\n\nCryptoPunks have some high-profile owners, too, such as rapper Jay-Z, YouTube personality Logan Paul and tennis champion Serena Williams.\n\nOn top of that, there are clear differentiators that make certain CryptoPunks more desirable and valuable to collectors. Alien avatars are the rarest of the randomized images, and as such, alien CryptoPunks are among the most expensive NFTs sold to date. Ape and zombie designs are also in demand.\n\nMost of the CryptoPunks just look like humans with varying features and accessories, however, and the plainer-looking ones are close to the market floor in terms of asking price on NFT marketplaces.\n\nThe future\n\nWhat\u2019s next for CryptoPunks? Well, they will likely continue to change hands on secondary markets, potentially generating huge returns for investors who bought in before the surge.\n\nThere\u2019s no way to tell whether the current level of demand will continue, but the entry-level price for Punks continues to rise. As of July 14, 2023, the average CryptoPunk NFT goes for about 53 ETH (about $2000)\n\nThis story was originally published on January 10, 2022 and was updated on July 14, 2023."

        "content": "This week, we take a closer look at Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, Binance Coin, and Solana.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nThe market turned bullish yesterday, and Ethereum broke above $2,000. This allowed it to book a respectable 7% price increase this week. The momentum is bullish, and continuation seems likely.\n\nThe current resistance is found at $2,120 and represents a local high achieved in April which is also the last time ETH broke above $2,000. A second attempt to break this key level could be successful if buyers manage to sustain and increase the momentum here.\n\nLooking ahead, ETH\u2019s price is expected to at least test the key resistance. If sellers won\u2019t hold down the price there, then it could escape and move towards $2,500 next.\n\nRipple (XRP)\n\nXRP has been the star of the show this week and booked a mind-blowing 72% price increase. We all knew this cryptocurrency was a momentum coin, but this surpassed any expectations. This also makes XRP the best performer this week.\n\nThe reason Ripple exploded is because it won a lawsuit against the SEC whereby the judge declared that the token is not a security so long it was bought or sold on a third-party exchange. This turned the whole market bullish as it means most would likely be treated the same in front of the law.\n\nLooking ahead, XRP faces resistance at 92 cents and has good support at 68 cents. After such a massive pump, a pullback also seems likely. Hopefully, buyers seem likely to manage to hold XRP above the key support.\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nADA is another altcoin that benefited from the XRP\u2019s lawsuit result. It quickly broke the 30 cents resistance and moved much higher, booking a 24% price increase this week.\n\nThe signs were there for Cardano, which formed a large ascending triangle, and a breakout seemed imminent. Now that this was confirmed, the current resistance is at 37 cents, and there is good support at 35 cents.\n\nLooking ahead, ADA should do its best to protect its most recent gains and defend the support at 35 cents. Otherwise, it could enter a deeper correction after such a massive increase in price.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB)\n\nBinance Coin was saved this week from falling below its key support at $230. It made a higher high and, in the process, booked a 9% price increase. This could also lead this cryptocurrency into a sustained rally.\n\nThe current resistance is found at around $250, and buyers may attempt to break this key level in the days to come and reverse some of the losses booked in June when the SEC sued Binance.\n\nLooking ahead, with the market sentiment turning bullish, Binance and BNB might see an influx of interest as market participants return. This should reflect positively on BNB\u2019s price, which hopefully will be able to reclaim the $300 level in the future.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nSolana surprised with its performance after increasing by 40% this week alone. Since June, its price has more than doubled. Yesterday\u2019s pump also took SOL to over $30, but bulls could not maintain the price above this key level.\n\nThe current resistance is found at $33, and the support at $26.5. Considering the massive increase in price, Solana could enter a short correction to allow the market to digest this significant move.\n\nLooking ahead, this cryptocurrency has a good chance to hold above the key support and consolidate above it before it attempts to break above $30 again."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nOndo Finance, an Ethereum-based asset manager, is broadening its market with the help of Polygon Labs in a bid to drive greater adoption of tokenized financial products within DeFi.\n\nBy expanding to Polygon, Ondo is looking to make its first move beyond the Ethereum mainnet since it became the first company to tokenize U.S. Treasuries in February. When the Ethereum base layer reaches capacity, it drives up the cost of transactions, and Ondo says this latest move will bring those costs down.\n\nJustin Schmidt, president and chief operating officer of Ondo Finance, said that the arrangement with Polygon would facilitate more access on-chain to institutional assets. In an interview with Decrypt, Schmidt added that the change comes at a ripe moment when more returns are possible in the DeFi ecosystem than sticking with other assets like stablecoins.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"I think what's happened over the past three years is just the macro environment has shifted in the world, and you actually can earn a pretty material interest rate now on something like Treasuries,\" Schmidt told Decrypt.\n\nFor more than a year, the Federal Reserve and other central banks have been lifting interest rates to tamp down on inflation. This has also raised the yields for Treasuries, with yields on short-term bonds like the 2-year note rising from just 1.9% yield when the rate hikes started in March of last year to almost 5% today.\n\nA tokenized asset is a blockchain-based signature of ownership with the underlying properties like yield remaining the same as the real-world equivalent. In contrast, a stablecoin is an entirely digital token that draws its value from its peg to a fiat currency or commodity to keep its volatility in check.\n\nToday, Ondo has the largest market share of tokenized assets on Ethereum, with nearly $158 million in market capitalization, according to Dune Analytics. In the wider market for tokenized assets, there are other big players like Franklin Templeton, which has just over $294 million in market cap on the Stellar network, according to the RWA.xyz analytics dashboard.\n\nOndo\u2019s move to expand its tokenized financial offerings comes at a time when TradFi behemoths are eying entryways into cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn June 15, BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, filed to register a Bitcoin spot market exchange traded fund. It was followed by other applications, including from big names like Fidelity, Valkyrie, and Invesco among others. Larry Fink, BlackRock\u2019s CEO, recently went so far as to liken Bitcoin to \u201cdigitalizing gold,\u201d a sharp reversal from his previously critical views.\n\nOndo, which invests in BlackRock-managed Treasury ETFs, appears to be going in the opposite direction of this crowd. With a Bitcoin ETF, the companies are taking a new technology like Bitcoin and putting it into a more traditional wrapper familiar that's to the industry. In Ondo\u2019s case, the process is inverted, taking a traditional asset and putting it into the newer tokenized form.\n\nTradFi moving into crypto at the same time as they increasingly adopt its underlying technology for tokenization may be part of an emerging trend in finance. Colin Butler, Polygon Labs' global head of institutional capital, expressed his view that there is a \"tidal wave\" of institutions adopting tokenization, and the proof of that will be seen in the near future.\n\n\"In the next three to six months, I think it's gonna be very, very telling, because a lot of these firms are going to come out and say they've been working on this,\" said Butler.\n\nEditor's Note: This story was updated to clarify that Ondo has the largest tokenized asset fund on Ethereum."

        "content": "Love them or hate them, Azuki NFTs are everywhere. These anime-style Avatars are some of the most recognizable PFPs in the NFT market, second only to Yuga Labs\u2019 Bored Ape Yacht Club.\n\nThe Azuki story is as polarizing as it is compelling. While Azuki NFT collections have boasted astronomic price appreciation and explosive trading volume, the ecosystem has been tarnished by a dark history of failed projects and disappointing new collections.\n\nDespite its flawed reputation, the Azuki NFT ecosystem has been a trendsetter within the cryptocurrency space. The Azuki community has been through multiple baptisms of fire and come out the other side uncharred and unfazed.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll take the Red Bean and go down the Rabbit Hole to explore all the non-fungible tokens and FUD that shape this mysterious and iconic Web3 startup.\n\nWhat Are Azuki NFTs?\n\nInitially, Azuki NFTs were a collection of 10,000 unique digital avatars, each boasting a distinctive Japanese anime-themed design. Launched in January 2022 by a group of artists based in Los Angeles, Azuki\u2019s skyrocketed in popularity, becoming a sensation in the Ethereum (ETH) NFT community.\n\nSince then, the Azuki Ecosystem has expanded, with multiple NFT collections and a tight-knit Web3 community. Ownership of an Azuki avatar grants access to a range of exclusive benefits, including Whitelist opportunities for new NFT drops, collaborations with streetwear brands, and invitations to live events.\n\nThis is all part of the Azuki vision to create a vibrant and interactive community known as The Garden, where artists, builders, and Web3 enthusiasts put their creative heads together to shape the future of the decentralized internet.\n\nThe Azuki Metaverse\n\nIf The Garden represents the beating heart of the Azuki community, Hilumia is the thriving on-chain Metaverse that will host Azuki\u2019s digital experience.\n\nHilumia development is still in its early stages, so it\u2019s still not completely clear what this blockchain-based digital universe will look like. The Azuki Metaverse is divided into ten separate areas, including a Skatepark, Dojo, and Arcade.\n\nWhat\u2019s Growing in The Garden: Azuki Collections\n\nA range of NFT collections have taken root and sprouted with the Azuki Garden. Each collection represents a different aspect of the Azuki universe, offering a diverse range of digital assets for collectors and enthusiasts.\n\nAzuki Main Collection\n\nThe Azuki main collection is the cornerstone of the Azuki universe. Launched in January 2022 through a Dutch Auction, Azukis are 10,000 unique digital avatars, each hand-drawn and boasting an anime-inspired aesthetic. These avatars have quickly gained popularity for their distinctive style and the unique traits they possess.\n\nDuring the initial mint, the Azuki NFT collection sold out in minutes, registering about $30 million USD in sales, trending on NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, and catapulting Azuki into the spotlight of the NFT world.\n\nEach Azuki avatar is a unique piece of digital art, with individual characteristics that set it apart from the rest. From different hairstyles and clothing to unique accessories like swords, skateboards, and boomboxes, the diversity of Azuki avatars mirrors the community\u2019s diversity.\n\nLike Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, an Azuki pfp is one of the most popular digital flexes. Repping an Azuki NFT on social media is a sure way to get noticed within NFT circles.\n\nBeanz\n\nIn a bid to make entrance to The Garden more accessible and reward existing holders, Azuki Beanz sprouted from the dirt. Chiru Labs, the team behind the Azuki ecosystem, describes Beanz as sidekicks that help expand the wider Azuki community.\n\nDuring the Beanz airdrop, Azuki holders were gifted two new NFTs. At their all-time high, Beanz fetched 5 ETH on NFT Marketplaces. The Beanz airdrop was considered a shining success that not only rewarded loyal members of the Azuki community but also added a new layer of intrigue and anticipation around the Beanz collection.\n\nAzuki Elementals\n\nIf you can\u2019t tell the difference between OG Azuki\u2019s and Azuki Elementals, you\u2019re not alone. The release of Chiru Labs new collection was met with both anticipation and controversy. Despite raking in $38 million USD within 15 minutes of its release, the Elementals collection faced overwhelming criticism from community members.\n\nCan you blame them? Azuki Elementals are so similar in appearance to the original collection that many loyal supporters abandoned The Garden, calling Chiru Labs nothing more than grifters and cash-grab artists guilty of extracting millions from the NFT space.\n\nWhile there are slight differences and the occasional Animal avatar, the similarities in design and aesthetic led to a significant backlash, with critics arguing that the Azuki Elementals felt like a cheaper and diluted version of the main collection. In the wake of the controversy, Azuki ecosystem floor prices dumped by over 40%.\n\nIn a desperate bid to stop the flow of criticism from the crypto community, Chiru Labs acknowledged that they\u2019d made a blunder and pledged to improve communication and execution in the future.\n\nGolden Skateboards\n\nAzuki Golden Skateboards are perhaps the most daring and innovative product released by Chiru Labs. In a bold fusion of the physical and digital realms, Azuki made waves by auctioning eight Golden Skateboard NFTs. This creative auction raised a staggering $2.5 million and introduced a new concept to the NFT space: PBTs (Physically-Backed Tokens)\n\nThe Golden Skateboards are not just digital assets; they\u2019re tied to tangible, gold-plated skateboards that can be redeemed by burning the NFT. Weighing in at 45 pounds each, these skateboards are not recommended for riding but would make a statement as a physical piece of luxury art.\n\nThanks to a cryptographic \u2018BEAN chip\u2019 implanted in each board, the physical skateboards can be transferred digitally, separate from the original NFT. This unique blend of the material and digital worlds is a new take on the burgeoning \u201cphygital\u201d collectibles market.\n\nWhether holders of the Golden Skateboards choose to redeem their tokens for the physical skateboard or hold for resale value remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: Azuki\u2019s Golden Skateboards have added a new dimension to the NFT landscape, pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in the intersection of physical and digital collectibles.\n\nA Murky Past: Azuki History\n\nThe journey of Azuki has been a fascinating one, marked by rapid success, ambitious innovation, and a fair share of controversy.\n\nZagabond, the Azuki founder, has a shady past. He\u2019s faced criticism due to his association with previous projects that did not meet expectations. Prior to launching Azuki, Zagabond was involved with projects such as Cryptophunks, Cryptozunks, and Tendies. All of these collections failed to gain traction and ultimately did not succeed, with some being considered downright rugpulls that Zagabond abandoned.\n\nAzuki detractors suggest that these past failures as a cause for concern, questioning whether Azuki could suffer a similar fate. Some members of the NFT community have expressed skepticism about Zagabond\u2019s ability to deliver on the ambitious promises made by the Azuki project, given the track record of his previous ventures.\n\nOf course, supporters of Azuki argue that it\u2019s not all doom and gloom in the Garden. Past failures do not necessarily predict future outcomes. Azuki fans quickly point out Azuki\u2019s rapid success and innovation as evidence of Zagabond\u2019s ability to learn from past mistakes and adapt.\n\nDespite the controversy, Azuki has managed to carve out a significant place for itself in the NFT landscape, demonstrating that it is possible to overcome past setbacks and achieve success in the dynamic and often unpredictable world of NFTs.\n\nWhether they overcome the fallout of the Azuki Elementals debacle remains to be seen.\n\nAzuki Pros and Cons\n\nNFTs are a speculative asset class at best. Azuki comes with its own set of advantages and challenges that are worth considering if you\u2019re interesting in joining The Garden.\n\nPros\n\nIconic Art Style \u2013 Let\u2019s face it, Azuki\u2019s anime-inspired aesthetic is stunning. The distinctive and quality design of the avatars has resonated with a wide audience, contributing to the Azukis rapid success.\n\n\u2013 Let\u2019s face it, Azuki\u2019s anime-inspired aesthetic is stunning.

This led to a significant drop in floor prices and caused many loyal holders to abandon the project. Uncertain Future \u2013 Like many NFT projects, the future of Azuki is uncertain. The fallout from the Elementals release has many collectors losing faith in Azuki\u2019s future.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nAzuki NFTs are an art-driven project. For collectors passionate about digital art and online communities, Azuki NFTs might be just what they\u2019re looking for, as opposed to an investment vehicle.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe Azuki NFT Ecosystem is arguablely the largest outside Yuga Labs. Azuki inspired dozens of similar NFT collections to adopt anime-inspired art or side-facing pfps. Despite Azuki\u2019s criticism, they have proven to set trends for others to follow.\n\nFAQs"

        "content": "Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, which links borrowers and investors directly, has become a well-liked substitute for traditional banking. P2P lending networks enable decentralized lending, in which people can borrow money from other people or institutions directly without the use of intermediaries, such as banks.\n\nBoth borrowers, who can receive loans with flexible terms, and investors, who can earn competitive returns on their investments, can profit from this lending arrangement. This article will look at five decentralized P2P lending services that let lenders and borrowers become involved in this expanding market.\n\nAave\n\nAave is a decentralized lending platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. By using digital assets like cryptocurrencies as collateral in smart contracts, it enables borrowers to receive loans. On the other hand, investors can lend borrowers their assets while still earning interest on their deposits.\n\nFlash loans, which allow borrowers to obtain loans without providing collateral as long as the loan is repaid in the same transaction, are Aave\u2019s distinguishing feature. This creates new opportunities for immediate liquidity and cutting-edge financial applications.\n\nCompound\n\nCompound is another decentralized lending platform operating on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables borrowers to place security and borrow items backed by the platform. Depending on the demand for particular assets, investors might lend their assets to borrowers and earn interest.\n\nTo ensure efficient capital allocation, Compound uses an algorithm that dynamically modifies interest rates based on the availability and demand of assets. By giving users the option to vote on suggestions for platform updates and parameter changes, the platform also lets users take part in governance.\n\nMakerDAO\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain-based decentralized lending platform MakerDAO is well-known for its Dai (DAI) stablecoin. By using their digital assets as collateral, borrowers can create DAI stablecoins, which are tied to the value of the United States dollar. Lending money to borrowers allows investors to receive interest in the form of stability fees.\n\nTokenholders who engage in voting on important choices, such as collateral kinds, stability fees and system upgrades, are a part of MakerDAO\u2019s decentralized governance architecture.\n\nRelated: DAO governance models: A beginner\u2019s guide\n\ndYdX\n\nThe decentralized derivatives trading platform dYdX also provides borrowing and lending features. Borrowers can trade on the site and borrow additional assets using their digital assets as collateral. Investors can lend borrowers their assets while earning interest on their deposits.\n\nUsers have freedom and leverage when trading thanks to dYdX\u2019s lending and borrowing options. The platform, which supports various assets and marketplaces, runs on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nFulcrum\n\nOn the Ethereum blockchain, Fulcrum is a decentralized lending and margin trading platform powered by bZx. Investors can lend their assets and receive interest on their deposits, while borrowers can pledge their assets as security and obtain extra credit.\n\nRelated: Margin trading vs. futures: What are the differences?\n\nUsers can effectively manage their holdings thanks to the seamless integration of Fulcrum\u2019s lending and trading services. Through the use of its native token, which enables users to vote on protocol updates and parameters, the platform also uses decentralized governance.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and readers should conduct their own research when making a decision."

        "title": "Crypto market liquidations hit nearly $500 million as Ripple and XRP hype dissipates over weekend - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nXRP, XLM and other altcoins enjoyed massive gains after Ripple\u2019s partial win against the SEC.\n\nThe weekend, however, looks bleak, with liquidations in the past 48 hours reaching as much as $473 million.\n\nAs the bearish momentum declines, investors on major exchanges turn bearish.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price showed weakness late on July 14, causing it slip below $31,000. This move from the pioneer crypto dampened the bullish momentum that arose on July 13 after the judge ruled partially in favor of Ripple in the long-standing United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) vs. Ripple lawsuit. While Ripple\u2019s XRP more than doubled, its competitor Stellar (XLM) token, shot up 107% in under 24 hours. Other altcoins like Cardano (ADA) also saw massive gains. But as the weekend rears its head, the optimism seems to be dissipating.\n\nMore Ripple/XRP coverage\n\nCrypto markets bleed as bulls disappear\n\nFrom the announcement of Ripple\u2019s partial win against the SEC on July 13 to date, $473 million worth of positions have been liquidated, according to data from CoinGlass. As seen in the chart below, there are massive short and long liquidations on July 13 and 14, respectively. The last time a liquidation event of this magnitude occurred was between June 5 to 10.\n\nTotal Liquidations chart\n\nXRP price, which exploded from $0.469 to $0.938 on July 13, has since dropped 22% and currently trades at $0.726.\n\nRipple\u2019s close competitor, XLM price went from $0.0953 to $0.197 and has since shed a whopping 32% and currently auctions at $0.133.\n\nWhy the sudden shift in market sentiment?\n\nThe stark shift in the mood of investors could be attributed to three reasons:\n\nAn inherently bearish market outlook before the announcement of the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit decision. More commentary on the lawsuit started surfacing after the initial announcement, which allows the SEC to contest the decision in the second circuit court of appeals. Moreover, the decision is partly a win for the commission as well since XRP sold to institutions constitutes security. Mean reversion; markets often revert to mean after the hype or frenzy dissipates, and the ongoing pullback could be just that.\n\nDue to the aforementioned reasons, the crypto markets seem to be returning to the mean, undoing recent gains. A sign of this can be seen as investors on exchanges have flipped their narrative to bearish.\n\nRead more: Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Weekend price swings to kick in"

Specifically, we will compare the potential of Greencoat UK Wind, a prominent renewable energy investment trust, with the opportunities presented by Ethereum (ETH) staking and the unique referral scheme offered by BEASTS Coin (BEASTS).\n\nWindy Profits With Greencoat UK Wind\n\nLooking for a way to generate some passive income in the UK stock market? Look no further than Greencoat UK Wind (LSE: UKW). This FTSE 250 investment trust operates 46 onshore and offshore wind farms across the UK, and it\u2019s expected to pay a dividend of 8.77p per share in 2023.

According to the report, companies like ConsenSys that provide important Ethereum infrastructure largely depend on virtual servers from cloud computing providers. Interestingly, Ethereum also has a large portion of its execution node hosted virtually on cloud servers.\n\nSajida Zouarhi, a product manager at Blocknative, an Ethereum data analytics firm has a strong concern about this.\n\nWhat good is it to have a diversity of people running nodes and a geographically distributed network if, in the end, it\u2019s all running with the same cloud provider?\n\nThe issue is that when too much Ethereum infrastructure is hosted through one provider or one data center, problems including technical issues or power outages can affect a large portion of the network as well as the technology built on top of it offline.\n\nStrategicHash, a pseudonymous blockchain researcher, believes that ETH could do better. It has been observed that these cloud service providers could have the control to hamstring these blockchain networks that are largely dependent on them.\n\nSpeaking on this, StrategicHash referred to the data showing that 2,439 of Ethereum\u2019s 6,810 nodes are hosted via AWS. This is around 35 percent. According to him, it is only ideal for one service provider to hold a maximum of 25 percent. Out of the 2,439 Ethereum nodes hosted via AWS, 1395 of them are found in a single data center in Ashburn, Virginia.\n\nHow Outages Can Affect Ethereum\n\nOn the part of Ethereum, the AWS outage may have a limited impact on its network as other nodes hosted elsewhere would facilitate transactions. Regardless, these outages can still cause a lot of harm according to StrategicHash.\n\nThose who stake ETH through nodes hosted on AWS would be affected by inactivity which could cost them millions of dollars. Outages would also reduce the number of nodes on Ethereum. This would make the network centralized and vulnerable to attack.\n\nPascal Caversaccio, a blockchain security researcher, commented on this.\n\nAn AWS incident can have a vast impact on user-facing applications such as hosted frontends or crypto wallets. I\u2019m not that much afraid of any consensus failures due to cloud hosting but rather of its impact on the user. An AWS incident can have a vast impact on user-facing applications such as hosted frontends or crypto wallets.\n\nHe observed that MetaMask relies on software hosted on AWS to make transactions to Ethereum. Considering that it has over 21 million monthly users, any outage can massively affect its operation. It has also been observed that some DeFi protocols rely on AWS. It can be recalled that the AWS outage in December 2021 made the decentralized exchange dYdX halt transaction processing.\n\nThe situation of Ethereum is not perfect, but better than in 2020 when over 70 percent of its execution nodes were hosted virtually. This has decreased to 60 percent.\n\nStrategicHash believes that there is a solution.\n\nA possible solution is to encourage hosting on bare metal rather than cloud providers. Bare Metal is cheaper, faster, and is unlikely to go down all at once.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum ($ETH) Price Could Rise Nearly 60% to Hit $3000, Crypto Analyst Predicts - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "A popular cryptocurrency analyst has recently revealed he has optimistic predictions for the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization Ethereum ($ETH), pointing to a potential upside of nearly 60%.\n\nIn a series of tweets shared with their nearly 200,000 followers on the microblogging platform analyst Altcoin Sherpa outlined a potential 59% rise for the second-largest cryptocurrency, which would see it get to the $3,000 mark, ahead of an expected pullback.\n\nUtilizing his extensive chart-based analysis, he forecasted that Ethereum might climb above $2,000 in the latter half of 2023\u2019s Q3, peaking above $2,700 in Q4, before retracting to around $1,250.\n\n$ETH: Wouldn't be surprised to see this go as high as near $3000 before a pullback. Still to be determined how far the pullback would go; it's going to depend on the macro economy IMO. Still bullish for now though. #Ethereum pic.twitter.com/fuK96ZG7kV \u2014 Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) July 11, 2023\n\nAltcoin Sherpa also shared his viewpoint on Solana ($SOL), currently the 10th-largest crypto asset by market cap. In his opinion, Solana may face about a 22% dip after hitting a critical resistance level.\n\nHe further suggested that the unfolding bankruptcy proceedings of the now-collapsed crypto exchange FTX, which was a major SOL supporter, could potentially lead to an increased supply of Solana in the market, as FTX\u2019s crypto trading division, Alameda Research, is a significant holder of Solana.\n\nThe analyst anticipated a slight decrease to the $17 mark, but noted he doesn\u2019t know what may happen next for the cryptocurrency although he is still bullish on it in the long run.\n\nAs CryptoGlobe reported, institutional investors are seemingly increasingly turning to cryptocurrencies, as crypto investment products have recently seen a significant influx of funds, with products focusing on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP leading the pack.\n\nEthereum\u2019s net flows year-to-date remain negative, with investors moving $63 million out of these products so far this year. Similarly, products focusing on multiple digital assets have seen $200,000 of inflows last week, but $35 million of outflows throughout this year.\n\nOther notable altcoins, including Solana ($SOL), $XRP, Polygon ($MATIC), Litecoin ($LTC), and Aave ($AAVE), have also seen inflows, albeit to varying degrees. In contrast, Cosmos ($ATOM) and Cardano ($ADA) experienced minor outflows.\n\nNot to be left behind, Blockchain equities \u2013 stocks of companies engaged in the development of blockchain technologies \u2013 have witnessed their largest inflows for the year, totaling $15 million.\n\nFeatured image via Unsplash."

        "title": "Donald Trump's NFT company reveals shockingly low bank balance, but massive Ethereum fortune: Details - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Former President Donald Trump has disclosed new details about CIC Digital LLC, a company that receives licensing fees for using his likeness on non-fungible tokens (NFTs). According to a revised financial filing submitted by Trump on July 13, CIC Digital LLC holds an Ethereum wallet with an estimated value ranging from $250,000 to $500,000, while its US bank account balance is reported to be less than $1,000.\n\nThe disclosure comes as NFT sales of Trump-branded digital assets have experienced a notable increase. Data from OpenSea reveals a surge of 17% in the sale volume of the Trump NFT Trading Cards, with a modest 2% rise in the floor price, which now trades at 4.18 ETH.\n\nIn 2022, the former president earned a six-figure income from NFT sales. His financial disclosure form, released by the watchdog group CREW in April, revealed earnings ranging from $100,001 to $1 million from NFT transactions.\n\nTrump made headlines in December 2022 with the launch of his NFT collection, featuring digital \u201ctrading cards\u201d showcasing cartoon illustrations of himself in heroic poses and outfits. The collection, priced at $99 per card, sold out completely within a day, demonstrating the strong demand among his supporters.\n\nTrump\u2019s NFT sales and financial gains\n\nThe revised financial filing provides specifics on nearly one hundred income sources, totaling over $1.2 billion. These sources include foreign business activities, speaking fees, and earnings from a golf course in Florida. The former First Lady Melania Trump reported earning $1.2 million from her speaking engagements.\n\nTrump\u2019s financial disclosures shed light on his post-presidential finances as he prepares for a potential presidential primary. Democrats have criticized him for failing to separate his business interests from his presidency, while his Republican opponents have largely refrained from questioning the sources of his earnings.\n\nThe disclosure also reveals additional revenue streams for Trump, including royalties and payments for speaking engagements. Notably, his social media company, Trump Media and Technology Group, is valued at $5 million to $25 million, with revenue coming from advertising on the conservative live-streaming site Rumble and the ad platform RevContent. Trump has assigned $2.1 million of his speaking fees as income to the media company.\n\nThe financial filing also discloses Melania Trump\u2019s speaking income, including a $250,000 speech to the Log Cabin Republicans and another $250,000 from Fix California, an election integrity group led by Ric Grenell, Trump\u2019s former acting director of national intelligence.\n\nMoreover, the filing reveals that Trump paid off an additional loan from Deutsche Bank AG, which was not included in his original filing. He retired a mortgage between $25 million and $50 million on his Trump National Doral resort.\n\nAs Trump continues to navigate his post-presidential ventures, the disclosure of his financial details provides a glimpse into his business activities and their intersection with his political career. The NFT market, in particular, has proven to be a lucrative avenue for the former president, with his digital assets attracting significant attention and sales."

        "content": "Even though the past month was filled with fear, uncertainty, and doubt (commonly referred to as FUD) due to regulatory scrutiny from the United States SEC, it appears that the sentiment around the cryptocurrency market is becoming more positive.\n\nIn this line, an anonymous whale shows solid support for Ethereum (ETH) as it seems to be accumulating over $125 million of the digital asset since June 8, according to on-chain data reported by Lookonchain.\n\nSince June 8, 2023, the Ethereum whale\u2019s address \u201c0x882\u202649732\u201d has withdrawn a total of 64,400 ETH ($125M) from exchanges and then staked 36,640 ETH ($71M), accounting for a 57% of the total transaction. Notably, the most recent withdrawal was made this Friday (14), for a 7,300 ETH ($14M).\n\nThe withdrawals took place in the last 44 days, as follows \u2014 according to data from the Ethereum blockchain on etherscan:\n\n20,000 ETH on June 8;\n\n6,500 ETH on June 23;\n\n8,100 ETH on June 27;\n\n15,500 ETH on June 30;\n\n7,000 ETH on July 13;\n\n7,300 ETH on July 14.\n\nWhy it\u2019s important?\n\nThese big transactions are important because a whale is usually known for owning a wallet address with high balances of a specific cryptocurrency, whose actions could directly impact the coin\u2019s price or form general sentiment around the digital asset.\n\nBy staking the majority of such a valuable sequence of withdrawals, this anonymous whale is sending a clear message that, potentially, there are no plans to sell ETH soon, which is a solid sign of support for the Ethereum network as a whole.\n\nNotably, to become a validator and generate yield, the user needs to invest (or stake) a minimum of 32 ETH, which then are locked into a smart contract. Later, validators are monetarily rewarded for their stake and participation.\n\nAs of the time of writing, ETH is being traded for $1,941, according to CoinMarketCap\u2019s price index.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price chart from June 8 to July 15. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nMarket pivots after a tough month\n\nThe first days of the last month (June) were filled with negative sentiments due to the SEC\u2019s lawsuits against two of the biggest crypto exchanges in the United States: Binance and Coinbase.\n\nHowever, the cryptocurrency market pivoted on Thursday (13th) after an apparently calm week start from Monday to Wednesday. A court decision on the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit triggered a sentiment change for all crypto assets.\n\nAs a result, most altcoins surged as Bitcoin Dominance fell below 50% of the entire market\u2019s capitalization after weeks of BTC receiving all the protagonism on price performance versus its competitors."
