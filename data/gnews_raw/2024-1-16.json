        "title": "Ethereum Staking Explained: Is ETH Staking Worth It? - CoinCodex",
        "content": "In September 2022, the Ethereum blockchain received its biggest upgrade to date. The Merge upgrade moved Ethereum from Proof-of-Work over to Proof-of-Stake. The transition to Proof-of-Stake has made the Ethereum much more environmentally friendly and also laid the foundation for future upgrades, which will significantly improve the scalability of the network.\n\nWith the introduction of Proof-of-Stake on Ethereum, ETH holders now have the opportunity to stake their coins and earn staking rewards in the form of additional ETH. In this article, we\u2019ll explain Ethereum staking and present the different options ETH holders have when it comes to earning staking rewards.\n\nKey highlights: The Ethereum network transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism in September of 2021.\n\nThis means that ETH holders can now stake their ETH to provide additional security to the network and earn rewards.\n\nIf you want to run your own validator, you need 32 ETH.\n\nIf you don't have 32 ETH, you can still earn staking rewards. You can use liquid staking protocols such as Lido or stake your ETH with the help of a crypto exchange.\n\nWe explain all the different ways of staking ETH and highlight the benefits and disadvantages of each.\n\nWhat is Ethereum staking?\n\nEthereum now uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, in which validators stake ETH in exchange for participating in the consensus process. Validators are rewarded for adding new blocks to the Ethereum blockchain and for checking that blocks proposed by other validators follow the protocol\u2019s rules.\n\nValidators that are reliable and act in the best interests of the network receive ETH as a reward. At the time of writing, validators on Ethereum are earning an APR (annual percentage rate) of about 4%. If you\u2019re investing in Ethereum and don\u2019t plan to sell in the short term, staking ETH is certainly worth considering to passively grow your ETH holdings.\n\nThe rewards earned by each validator depend on the total number of validators that are active on the Ethereum network, as well as network activity (more activity means more potential income from transaction fees).\n\nThe catch is that validators who are not reliable or are found to be breaking the rules are punished by having a portion or the entirety of their ETH stake taken away.\n\nWho can stake ETH?\n\nIn order to launch your own validator, you need to have 32 ETH. At the time of writing, this translates to about $57,000, so it\u2019s definitely not accessible to everyone from a financial perspective.\n\nHowever, the good news is that there are still ways to earn staking rewards with your ETH even if you don\u2019t have the 32 ETH required to launch your own validator. We\u2019ll discuss the different ways to stake ETH a bit further below in the article.\n\nInitially, staked ETH coins could not be withdrawn. However, this was changed with the Shapella upgrade in April of 2023, which gave users the ability to withdraw their staked coins.\n\nWhere to stake ETH?\n\nThere\u2019s four distinct options for ETH holders that want to stake their ETH and earn staking rewards.\n\nSolo staking\n\nStaking as a service\n\nStaking pools\n\nStaking through crypto exchanges\n\nHowever, solo staking and staking as a service are limited to those that have at least 32 ETH.\n\nDo you have 32 ETH to stake?\n\nIf you have 32 or more ETH to stake, you can access solo staking or staking as a service solutions. Of course, you can also use other ways of staking ETH that are also available to users that have less than 32 ETH to stake.\n\nSolo staking\n\nSolo staking involves launching your own Ethereum validator and maintaining it yourself. Each validator you run requires a stake of 32 ETH.\n\nWhen you\u2019re solo staking, you\u2019re directly participating in the consensus process of the Ethereum blockchain and contribute to the network\u2019s decentralization. In addition, you remain in full control of your private keys and receive full staking rewards directly from the Ethereum protocol. This is why the Ethereum Foundation describes solo staking as the \u201cgold standard\u201d for Ethereum staking.\n\nWhile solo staking certainly has a lot of benefits, it is the least accessible way to stake ETH for the average person. The most obvious barrier to entry is that you need at least 32 ETH, which is simply out of reach for most Ethereum investors. Operating a validator also requires some technical expertise, and you need to ensure that your validator stays online continuously to avoid inactivity penalties.\n\nStaking as a service\n\nThere are various staking as a service providers that offer to manage one or more Ethereum validators on your behalf. When using these services, you\u2019re required to provide ETH (32 ETH per validator). In most cases, you get to keep control of your private keys, which is a plus.\n\nOf course, staking as a service providers need some form of compensation for operating validator nodes on your behalf. So, while your validators will be earning ETH staking rewards directly from the Ethereum protocol, you will have to pay a fee to the service provider to keep your validators up and running.\n\nSo, staking as a service can be a good option if you have the sufficient amount of ETH to have your own validators but don\u2019t want to deal with the technical aspects of setting up a node and keeping it operational.\n\nOverall, your returns will be slightly lower than what you\u2019d get with solo staking as you\u2019ll have to pay a fee to the provider. Some examples of staking as a service providers are BloxStaking and Abyss Finance.\n\nDo you have less than 32 ETH to stake?\n\nIf you don't have 32 ETH to stake, you can't engage in solo staking, but there's other options available to you.\n\nStaking pools\n\nStaking pools take ETH deposits from multiple users and pool them together to launch Ethereum validators. This makes it possible for anyone to stake their ETH, even if they don\u2019t have 32 ETH themselves.\n\nStaking pools are a very popular way of staking Ethereum, and many of them offer liquid staking, which is a very handy feature. Here\u2019s two examples of the top two Ethereum staking pools available today.\n\nLido\n\nLido is a liquid staking solution that supports multiple blockchains, including Ethereum. Lido is the most popular way to stake Ethereum. At the time of writing, over 30% of all staked ETH has been staked through Lido.\n\nAfter staking your ETH through Lido, you will receive an equivalent amount of stETH tokens, which represent your staked ETH and any accrued rewards. These stETH tokens can be used in DeFi protocols or even sold if you need liquidity.\n\nHowever, you should keep in mind that the stETH to ETH exchange rate is usually skewed in favor of ETH, so you will likely receive a bit less than 1 ETH for each stETH you sell. Of course, you are also able to redeem your stETH for staked ETH on a 1:1 basis.\n\nRocket Pool\n\nRocket Pool is also a liquid staking solution that allows users to stake smaller amounts of ETH. The minimum amount of ETH that can be staked through Rocket Pool is 0.01 ETH, which makes the service highly accessible.\n\nWhen you stake ETH through Rocket Pool, your staked coins and accrued rewards are represented with rETH tokens. Similarly to stETH, you can use rETH in any way you please. rETH holders can redeem their tokens for ETH on a 1:1 basis.\n\nOverall, staking pools are a good option for anyone that\u2019s looking to earn Ethereum staking rewards but has less than 32 ETH to stake.\n\nCrypto exchanges\n\nMany cryptocurrency exchanges offer Ethereum staking services to their users. For example, you can stake your Ethereum on Binance, which is a solid option since you will be able to retain liquidity thanks to BETH, a token that represents ETH staked through Binance.\n\nWhen staking through an exchange, you deposit ETH to the exchange. The exchange then pools together ETH from multiple users to deploy Ethereum validators. The rewards earned by these validators are then distributed to the users who staked their ETH, but the exchange will typically take a cut from the rewards as a fee for the service they provide.\n\nStaking through exchanges is probably the most convenient way to earn Ethereum staking rewards, but it also requires the most trust. When you deposit your ETH to a centralized crypto exchange, you have to trust that they will manage your funds responsibly. In addition, there could be a negative impact to the decentralization of Ethereum if exchanges control a large number of validators.\n\nComparison of Ethereum staking methods\n\nNow that we\u2019ve briefly explained each different Ethereum staking method, let\u2019s do a quick comparison of their pros and cons.\n\nMinimum amount Pros Cons Solo staking 32 ETH Full control over staking setup\n\nReceive full rewards\n\nContributes most to decentralization High barrier to entry\n\nRequires technical knowledge Staking as a service 32 ETH Much simpler than solo staking\n\nKeep control of keys required to withdraw or transfer staked ETH Service providers take a fee\n\nHigh barrier to entry Staking pools Small (0.01 ETH or less) You can stake smaller amounts of ETH\n\nMany staking pools offer liquidity tokens\n\nNon-custodial options available Smart contract risks\n\nLiquidity token price fluctuations Crypto exchanges Small (0.01 ETH or less) Very convenient way of staking ETH\n\nMany exchanges offer liquid staking options Requires trust in the exchange\n\nExchange takes a cut of the rewards\n\nCentralization risks\n\nEthereum \"restaking\"\n\nRecently, the concept of Ethereum \"restaking\" has started to gain traction in the crypto community. Through protocols such as EigenLayer, users who own staked ETH can choose to \"restake\" their coins to help provide security to applications that function on top of the Ethereum network. Essentially, this means that staked ETH can be used to validate networks and services other than the Ethereum mainnet, allowing users to earn additional rewards on top of the standard ETH staking yield.\n\nCurrently, the most popular Ethereum restaking protocol is EigenLayer, which supports restaking both for ETH as well as liquid staking tokens such as stETH and rETH. Please keep in mind that restaking is a relatively new concept and doesn't have a long track record in real-world conditions. If you're using a protocol such as EigenLayer to restake your ETH, you could be taking on substantially more risk than if you just kept your coins staked normally.\n\nThe bottom line\u2014ETH staking is a good choice for long-term holders\n\nEthereum staking is worth it if you\u2019re an ETH holder and plan to hold your coins over the long term. This is already the position of many ETH holders, as Ethereum is widely perceived as one of the best cryptocurrencies to hold for the long term. Before deciding whether staking is right for you, make sure to check the current ETH staking rewards to see what kind of APR to expect.\n\nIf you\u2019re also interested in cryptocurrencies other than Ethereum, check out our list of the best cryptocurrencies to buy right now."

        "content": "The long-awaited Dencun upgrade has finally arrived for the Goerli testnet, although low participation resulted in it failing to be finalized in the expected time.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade, which includes a major update known as \u201cproto-danksharding\u201d designed to help reduce layer-2 transaction fees, went live on Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet on Jan. 17, according to Tim Beiko, community manager at Ethereum Foundation.\n\nBeiko acknowledged that the participation among validators for the upgrade was \u201cnot great,\u201d but noted that a similar outcome \u201cwas expected.\u201d It also appears the upgrade resulted in a \u201cchain split\u201d as not all validators synced with each other for the update.\n\nAnd it seems like we have a chain split!

Once Dencun runs smoothly on all three testnets, the Ethereum Foundation plans to roll out the upgrade on the Ethereum mainnet by the end of Q1 2024.\n\nDencun marks the final upgrade for the Goerli testnet. Subsequently, both the client and Ethereum Foundation testing teams will discontinue support for the Goerli testnet after the completion of the Dencun upgrade.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade, known as EIP-4844, aims to increase blockchain space for data blobs and slash layer-2 rollup fees by activating proto-danksharding. This data storage expansion should scale Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, enabling more transaction capacity without hiking gas fees.\n\nRead more: ETH developers voice concern over gas limit hike proposed by Vitalik Buterin\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin by 20%, but how long can ETH hold $2.5K support? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), rallied 20% between Jan. 8 and Jan. 11 but struggled to sustain the $2,600 level. The subsequent 3.5% correction down to $2,560 on Jan. 16 may have disappointed some bulls, but Ether's price has outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) by 19.5% since Jan. 8. Such gaps are quite uncommon and last occurred in October 2022.\n\nEther investors question if the $2,500 level will hold, given that the most obvious drivers are not expected in the short term, namely the Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) and the planned Ethereum network upgrades. From a bullish perspective, these events present an opportunity for Ether to further decouple from the remaining cryptocurrency market, but they also present a risk if it either backfires or is postponed.\n\nEther usually does not outperform Bitcoin by 15%\n\nThe price of Ether outperforming Bitcoin by 15% or higher in a week is not something common, at least in the past two years. Besides the high correlation between the two cryptocurrencies, 2023 was marked by disappointment with Ethereum's declining total value locked (TVL) and persistently high gas fees, paving the way for competing blockchains. Meanwhile, Bitcoin benefited from the anticipation of a spot ETF approval, especially after BlackRock joined the race in June 2023.\n\nIn fact, the latest instance happened 14 months ago as Ether's price rallied from $1,305 to $1,615 in the seven days leading to Oct. 29, 2022. After outperforming Bitcoin by 17%, the gap closed in the following 11 days as ETH crashed below $1,100 on Nov. 9, 2022.\n\nEther/USD (blue) vs. Bitcoin/USD (orange), October 2022. Source: TradingView\n\nA single past instance should not serve as guidance for prices, especially considering November 2022 marked the downfall of the FTX exchange after reports of customer funds mismanagement and a potential $8 billion shortfall. A counter-example includes the 31 days between July 13, 2022, and Aug. 13, 2022, where Ether's price outperformed Bitcoin by 63%.\n\nEther/USD (blue) vs. Bitcoin/USD (orange), August 2022. Source: TradingView\n\nETH rallied from $1,080 to $1,990 during the 31 days ending Aug. 13, 2022, and despite failing to break above $2,000, the gap relative to Bitcoin's price persisted in the following month. In essence, a much different type of price action from the short-lived outperformance in October 2022. More importantly, the gap continued even though the cryptocurrency market capitalization faced a correction, which is opposite from what one typically expects given Bitcoin's dominance.\n\nEthereum network activity signals strength and higher demand for ETH\n\nTo understand whether Ether has what it takes to hold the $2,500 support, one should analyze the Ethereum network activity, including its scaling solutions. Decentralized applications (DApps) are at the core of this smart contract-capable blockchain, thus diminishing use in terms of users and volumes is indicative of less demand for ETH.\n\nRelated: Spot Ethereum ETF not coming 'anytime soon,' says Mark Yusko\n\nTo assess network demand, one needs to analyze metrics related to DApp usage, as some projects including games, decentralized finance (DeFi), and nonfungible token marketplaces are not financially intensive, rendering the total value locked (TVL) metric irrelevant. Over the past 30 days, the top Ethereum decentralized applications (DApps) have seen an average 26% decrease in the number of active addresses.\n\nBlockchains ranked by 30-day DApp volumes. Source: DappRadar\n\nOver the past 30 days, Ethereum DApps experienced a 41% gain in volume fueled by increases in Uniswap, Balancer, ParaSwap, and Aave. Consequently, even if one excludes the activity in Ethereum rollups, the base layer holds a 6 to 1 advantage versus its largest competitor, BNB Chain. That shows how bears' criticism toward Ethereum high fees is exaggerated in terms of dominance in the DeFi industry.\n\nBesides the strong on-chain activity, Ether's price could benefit from the \"Dencun\" hard fork, an upgrade that aims to increase data availability and reduce costs for rollup transactions. The test implementations are expected to initiate on Jan. 17. Furthermore, Bloomberg ETF analysts hold 70% odds of an Ethereum ETF approval by May, reinforcing the bullish momentum and the strength of the $2,500 price support.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Ethereum processed a record high of nearly 2M transactions on Jan. 14\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nEthereum\u2019s throughput surged to a record high as the network\u2019s burn rate pushes the supply of ETH to new post-merge lows.\n\nData from L2beat shows activity on Ethereum jumping to a new all-time high of 22.7 transactions per second (TPS) on Jan. 14 after jumping 62% in a day. Nearly 2M transactions were settled over 24 hours amid the spike in activity.\n\nFor comparison, Ethereum\u2019s throughput has predominantly trended between 11 TPS and 14 TPS since mid-2020, sans a brief spike to 19.9 TPS in May 2021 as the post-DeFi summer boomed peaked.\n\nDespite on-chain activity rocketing to unprecedented levels, throughput on the Ethereum mainnet continues to be overshadowed by the booming Layer 2 ecosystem. Ethereum L2s processed more than 63 TPS on average during Jan. 14, down from an all-time high of more than 152 TPS on Dec. 16 amid surging inscriptions activity.\n\nEthereum mainnet and Layer 2 throughput. Source: L2beat.\n\nETH\u2019s supply hit new local lows\n\nEthereum\u2019s throughput milestone coincides with a persistently high burn-rate pushing the supply of Ether to new post-merge lows. Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade, also known as The Merge, reduced the rate of new Ether issuance by around 90% in September 2022. The upgrade paved the way for Ether to become deflationary as the network\u2019s burn rate appeared poised to off-set new ETH entering supply.\n\nThe supply of ETH steadily fell throughout most of 2023, excluding two months of inflation as activity lulled during September and October, and again amid the New Year holiday week. Ether\u2019s supply has fallen by 5,745.5 ETH over the past seven days to tag a new post-merge low of roughly 120.76M coins, according to Ultra Sound Money.\n\nUniswap was the leading source of burned Ether with 2,054 ETH destroyed over the past seven days, followed by token transfers with 1,480 ETH, and Tether with 1,033.8. Surgeon Layer 2s Arbitrum and ZkSync Era also accounted for a significant share of burned coins through sequencing fees.\n\nEther supply changes over 30 days. Source: Ultra Sound Money.\n\nETH investors are also riding high after Ether held strong as BTC tumbled after the launch of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs manifested as a sell-on-the-news event for the pioneering cryptocurrency.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha?

With several firms filing applications for spot Ether ETFs, including the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, many speculators are tipping ETH will comprise the next crypto asset to underpin a spot exchange-traded fund."

        "title": "Ethereum: What Q1 2024 holds for investors - AMBCrypto English",
        "content": "Ethereum faced some turmoil after recent volatility muted bullish sentiment.\n\nDespite this, the usage and holder sentiment remained strong, which is good news for investors.\n\nEthereum [ETH] saw a drop in its estimated leverage ratio metric over the past month. This downward trend came at a time when prices managed to scale past significant resistance levels.\n\nThe volatility behind Bitcoin [BTC] was one contributing factor. BTC threatened to break out past $44.3k multiple times (and accomplished it twice), only to fall back within the range formation of the past six weeks.\n\nThis has inspired some doubt in the minds of ETH speculators and investors. Additionally, Ethereum has also lagged behind Bitcoin in terms of price appreciation. AMBCrypto looked closer at relevant on-chain metrics and found that investors have reason to be confident.\n\nWhat are the implications of the Estimated Leverage Ratio falling?\n\nWhen the prices of ETH go up but the leverage ratio trends downward, it points toward reduced speculative activity and leverage trading. This could be due to diminished bullish sentiment. Alternatively, it could also be indicative of a rally that is driven by the spot markets and organic demand instead of Open Interest in the futures market.\n\nThe chart showed that the metric saw sharp drops in the past month. The 14-day simple moving average has trended downward. However, the leverage ratio saw a sizeable bounce after 6 January as prices rebounded higher.\n\nThe volatility in the past few weeks also likely forced leveraged traders to close their positions or liquidate them. This also likely led to a falling estimated leverage ratio.\n\nTo understand whether an accumulation of ETH in the spot markets was a significant contributing factor, AMBCrypto analyzed the exchange outflow metric.\n\nThe 7-day EMA of the exchange outflow was used to see if it trended upward noticeably. While there were individual spikes upward, it was not like the steady uptrend of October.\n\nThis suggested that the idea of a market-wide accumulation of ETH in the spot markets was not backed strongly by the outflows.\n\nThus far, the evidence points toward profit-taking and reduced risk-taking tendency in the Futures market. Once again, given the volatility of the past three weeks, the explanation held credibility. Yet, there\u2019s more to the story.\n\nThe reasons why investors could take heart from the recent developments\n\nTo highlight the market sentiment, AMBCrypto took a look at the Open Interest chart of Ethereum. Once again, the 7-day EMA gave a clearer picture of the current trends.\n\nIt showed that since the 9th of December, the OI has oscillated significantly instead of the uptrend it had been on since mid-September.\n\nThe decline in OI came alongside strong price drops, especially during the rejections that ETH faced at $2.4k throughout December.\n\nThe recent price action suggested that ETH has not found its local top. The multiple rejections at $2.4k were followed by a huge surge in prices after the BTC spot ETF approvals came.\n\nThis saw the prices touch the $2.7k mark, breaking the resistance zone at long last.\n\nTo understand if holders are confident of further gains, the MVRV ratio was analyzed, among other metrics. The MVRV ratio nearly reached December\u2019s highs during the rally.\n\nMore importantly, it remained well above zero to show that a large amount of holders were in profit at press time.\n\nThe Weighted Sentiment also saw a strong peak during the price rally, but has fallen since then. The Active Addresses has steadily trended higher in the past two months, which indicated increased engagement and potential demand.\n\nAdditionally, the transaction volume (30-day SMA) has not fallen dramatically either. It has maintained a roughly steady level in the past two months and saw occasional large peaks as activity surged enormously.\n\nOnce again, this was a sign of steady network usage.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nEven though the price volatility hurt futures traders and diminished the bullish sentiment, the on-chain metrics showed that it was business as usual.\n\nThe high MVRV ratio was encouraging, even though the exchange outflows were not particularly convincing. This is why Ethereum\u2019s prices are expected to climb higher in Q1 2024."

        "content": "A highly anticipated trial run of the Ethereum Dencun upgrade deployed successfully on the Goerli test network on Wednesday but then failed to reach finalization as intended. The setback points to potential validation and software shortcomings ahead of deploying major network changes.\n\nBlockchain data shows the testnet upgrade was initiated around 6:32 UTC but did not finalize transactions as projected. Sources told The Block that a lack of nodes upgrading the requisite components to facilitate consensus likely obstructed the completion of the normally irreversible finalization process.\n\nAnd it seems like we have a chain split! Client teams are looking into it, but it's likely to a while to pin down + fix the issues. Keep an eye out for updates! \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) January 17, 2024\n\nDencun on Goerli marks the first phase of testing planned network shifts, enabling expanded data availability.\n\nFailure to finalize transactions suggests issues with validator participation and software preparation.\n\nFurther upgrades are slated for the Sepolia and Kintsugi testnets before any mainnet activation.\n\nRead more: Sam Bankman Fried\u2019s Parents Seek FTX Lawsuit Dismissal\n\nGoerli acts as a testing ground for functionality and security before pushing Ethereum improvements to the live main network. The Dencun dry run specifically involves a data storage technique called \u201cproto-danksharding\u201d to boost network capacity.\n\nEthereum developers aim to diagnose and resolve the issue\n\nActivating the technology requires high node turnout and upgrading consensus mechanisms to guarantee transaction finality. Sources said an apparent shortfall on both fronts disrupted the expected confirmation of Dencun test transactions.\n\nDevelopers now aim to diagnose and resolve the problems in the coming days before initiating further trials. The next Dencun test phases involve the Sepolia and Kintsugi testnets in sequence as deployment moves closer to reality.\n\nRead more: Grayscale Transfers 9,000 BTC To Coinbase Prime As Bitcoin Hits $43,000\n\nAs Ethereum\u2019s most significant change since last year\u2019s Merge, rigorous testing minimizes mainnet disruptions from Dencun\u2019s novel data architecture. Successfully processing transactions via shard chains remains essential to Ethereum\u2019s vision for scalability and reduced gas costs.\n\nHowever, the Goerli hiccup demonstrates challenges still confronting Ethereum\u2019s complex roadmap for future upgrades, like sharding."

        "title": "Here Are The Most Bullish Predictions For ETH Price As Ethereum Dominance Rises Against Bitcoin - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The sentiments around Ethereum look to be very bullish at the moment as the second-largest crypto token by market cap has seen its dominance surge against Bitcoin. Ethereum\u2019s rise against the flagship crypto token is also significant, as crypto analyst Jaydee recently suggested that it could usher in the altcoin season.\n\nBullish Predictions For Ethereum\u2019s Price\n\nCrypto analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted the fact that Ethereum broke out from an ascending triangle on the weekly chart. According to him, the crypto token has its eyes on the $3,400 price level despite the short-term volatility. Backing Ali\u2019s analysis, crypto analyst Mayne shared their belief that $3,400 remains a viable target for ETH\u2019s price.\n\nInterestingly, Mayne hinted that \u201cETH betas\u201d could run alongside ETH when this significant price surge begins to happen. These ETH betas include tokens like the native tokens of Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 networks Optimism and Arbitrum.\n\nCrypto analyst Ash Crypto also offered a bullish prediction for ETH\u2019s price while commenting on the state of the market. He remarked that money was currently flowing from Bitcoin to Ethereum and that it shouldn\u2019t be long before the latter trades above $3,200.\n\nETH trading above the $3,000 price level looks to be the consensus going by these predictions. The CEO and founder of MN Trading, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, had before now suggested that ETH was also going to rise above $3,000 on its way to $3,500. Then, Poppe boldly claimed that this price prediction would materialize in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, crypto analyst ColdBloodedShill stated in a recent X post that ETH is likely planning for higher prices as long as it remains above $2,400. The $2,400 price range looks to be an important support level as ETH looks to break out. Crypto analyst Bluntz Capital also highlighted that price range ($2,495 specifically) as he noted that there will be an eventual breakout as long as ETH holds above that level.\n\nETH bulls struggle at $2,500 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nConviction On Ethereum Getting Stronger\n\nMarket intelligence platform Santiment recently revealed that the number of new ETH addresses is on the rise as Ethereum continues to outperform Bitcoin. 89.4 thousand addresses are said to have been created daily during this stretch. This represents a significant increase from late last year, when 70.4 addresses were created daily in early November.\n\nSantiment also added that ETH\u2019s supply on exchanges had reduced drastically to 8.10%, almost getting close to its all-time low (since the opening week of trading) of 8.05%. Such a development usually suggests that ETH holders are looking to hold for the long term as they move their holdings to self-custody.\n\nFeatured image from TechRadar, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

However, Yusko disagrees.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d probably say less than 50/50,\u201d he told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview.\n\nDespite the recent Bitcoin ETF approval, Yusko argued that the SEC remains broadly hostile toward cryptocurrencies, as was suggested by the agency\u2019s head, Gary Gensler, in his message on the day of the approval.\n\nAnother obstacle, according to Yusko, is that the SEC may still regard Ether as a security \u2014 unlike Bitcoin, which is considered a commodity.\n\nSwitching topics to Bitcoin, Yusko argued that the approval of the spot ETF will dramatically reduce BTC\u2019s volatility and, therefore, its potential returns. Investors should welcome that, according to Yusko, as it\u2019s a sign of the maturation of the asset.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t invented for day trading,\u201d he said about Bitcoin. \u201cIt was invented to allow you and I to exchange value without asking permission.\u201d\n\nTo find out more about the long-term impact of the spot Bitcoin ETF approval, check out the full interview on Cointelegraph\u2019s YouTube channel, and don\u2019t forget to subscribe!"

        "content": "Ethereum Virtual Machine-based (EVM) blockchain networks are the most popular networks for builders, with nearly nine out of 10 multichain developers working on at least one EVM-compatible chain, according to a developer report from Electric Capital.\n\nIn the expansive Jan. 17 report that looked at crypto development activity over the last year, Electric Capital shed fresh light on total developer activity for the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nThe report found that \u201cunsurprisingly,\u201d EVM-compatible chains shared most of their developers with other EVM networks. In total, 87% of multichain developers worked on EVM-compatible chains, with Starket, Polygon, Optimism and Arbitrum seeing the most crossover.\n\nEVM-compatible networks are the most popular for multichain developers. Source: Electric Capital.\n\nEVM-compatible blockchains are a group of networks that can run the Ethereum Virtual Machine and execute smart contracts on Ethereum. These networks include the likes of Starknet, Tron, Binance\u2019s BNB Chain, Arbitrum, Optimism and Polygon.\n\nBNB Chain and Polygon witnessed the most \u201ccross-pollination\u201d from Ethereum\u2019s multichain developers, with 37% of Ethereum multichain developers deploying code on the BNB Chain and 35% deploying code on Polygon.\n\nMaria Shen, a general partner at Electric Capital, told Cointelegraph that one of the most notable findings in the report was the consistent growth of established developers despite a slide in total developers.\n\nWhile the total number of monthly active developers across the entire crypto ecosystem slid 24% from 29,611 to 22,411 in the final quarter, the total number of experienced developers \u2014 meaning those that have worked in crypto for more than a year \u2014 grew by 16% throughout 2023.\n\n\u201cDuring times when prices are appreciating, a lot of people come in, and during times when prices are not appreciating, some people leave. But through all of it, there\u2019s a core group of people who are staying, and in fact, every single time new people flood in, many end up staying,\u201d Shen said.\n\nThe total number of experienced developers grew by 16% in 2023. Source: Electric Capital\n\nNotably, Ethereum leads the pack in attracting new developers, with more than 16,700 newcomers shipping code on the chain in 2023. This is nearly triple the 6,200 new developers on Polygon and almost four times that of Solana\u2019s 4,705.\n\nShen added that the influx of newcomers in 2023 \u2014 despite a prolonged bear market \u2014 showed an underlying strength in the crypto ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fascinating to see this torso of ecosystems that\u2019ve been very successful at bringing in all of these developers. So there are 17 ecosystems total, who have pulled in more than a thousand developers.\u201d\n\nBitcoin witnessed a 19% decline in development activity year-over-year, now commanding just over 1,000 monthly active developers.\n\nWhile total developer numbers decreased for Bitcoin, layer-2 networks and scaling solutions now capture more than 40% of all open-source Bitcoin developers, a more than 400% increase from January 2016.\n\nBitcoin layer 2s and scaling solutions account for 40% of the total development activity on Bitcoin. Source: Electric Capital\n\nRelated: Solana now boasts more than 2,500 monthly active developers\n\nThe report also found that crypto developers have been building out their skills to work across a variety of different chains, with multichain development activity growing by 1,000% since 2015.\n\nAs of the end of December 2023, 30% of all monthly active developers work on at least two blockchains, with that number growing by around 125% since 2018.\n\nMultichain development has increased 10-fold since 2015.

        "title": "Bitcoin Backs Down: Ethereum Steals The Spotlight With Surge In Market Dominance - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Amidst the lull in the realm of Bitcoin, Ethereum emerges as a trailblazer, confidently charting its course. While the crypto king takes a breather following its ETF approval, Ethereum, undeterred, is experiencing a surge in both price and dominance, propelled by an influx of new users and the prevailing trend of self-custody.\n\nRecent data from Santiment vividly illustrates Ethereum\u2019s ascendancy. The platform\u2019s price dominance, reflecting its market share in comparison to all other cryptocurrencies, has witnessed a remarkable surge of 22.4% within a mere week.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Remarkable Surge: Growing Community, Strong On-Chain\n\nThis surge is not merely a passive spectacle; Ethereum is actively attracting an astonishing 89,400 new addresses on a daily basis, with an unprecedented 96,300 joining the Ethereum community in a single day.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nThis momentum is not solely about acquiring new participants; it\u2019s about retention. Ethereum\u2019s exchange supply, representing the quantity readily available for sale, is approaching its historical low of 8.05%. This shift signals a notable move towards self-custody and staking, mitigating the immediate risk of a substantial selloff and fortifying Ethereum\u2019s price floor.\n\nThe on-chain strength witnessed translates into tangible market action. Following a brief dip that tested the $2,500 support, Ethereum not only stabilized but turned this once-resilient level into a launchpad.\n\nEthereum currently trading at $2,556 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nAnalysts are now setting their sights on the $2,700 barrier as the gateway to unlocking a potential price surge, with FOMO (fear of missing out) traders anticipated to join the rally. Beyond this juncture, the horizon appears boundless, with $3,400 emerging as an enticing target.\n\nCaution Amid Excitement: Ethereum\u2019s Unpredictable Trajectory\n\nYet, amid the excitement, an air of caution permeates the volatile crypto landscape. A breach below the \u201chammer\u201d formation that materialized on Monday holds the potential to send Ethereum plummeting towards the 20-Day EMA (exponential moving average) at approximately $2,300.\n\nTraders are poised on tenterhooks, meticulously monitoring these crucial levels to decipher the forthcoming trajectory of Ethereum\u2019s journey.\n\nOne undeniable truth emerges: Ethereum is casting off the shadow of Bitcoin and carving out its unique path. With an increasing dominance, a fervent user base, and a focus on self-custody, Ethereum is laying the groundwork for future expansion.\n\nWhether it attains the envisioned $3,400 pinnacle or steers towards an alternate destiny, one certainty prevails\u2014Ethereum is an influential force, and its narrative is only in its nascent stages.\n\nHistory repeating itself.#Bitcoin dominance peaking before the halving and potentially marking a cycle top. Altcoins are likely to outperform coming period. pic.twitter.com/ox36x2M5NG \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 15, 2024\n\nMeanwhile, in order to bolster Ethereum\u2019s increasing dominance over Bitcoin, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, the founder and CEO of trading company MNTrading, observed that Bitcoin was falling behind Ethereum in terms of the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn a post on X dated January 12, he included the following graphic with the caption, \u201c#Bitcoin dominance peaking before the halving and maybe signifying a cycle top.\u201d It\u2019s conceivable that altcoins will perform better in the near future.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

ETH/USD remains at a risk of more downsides below the $2,420 support zone.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nIn the past few weeks, Ethereum started a decent increase above the $2,320 resistance zone against the US Dollar. ETH price climbed above the $2,400 and $2,500 resistance levels.\n\nFinally, it tested the $2,720 resistance zone. A high was formed near $2,717 before there was a downside correction. There was a move below the $2,600 support zone. The price even traded below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,167 swing low to the $2,717 high.\n\nETH is now trading above $2,450 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). There is also a key declining channel forming with support at $2,420 on the 4-hour chart.\n\nOn the upside, the price is now facing resistance near the $2,550 level. The next major resistance is near the $2,580 level. The next major resistance is near the $2,600 zone. A clear move above the $2,580 and $2,600 resistance levels might call for a fresh move to $2,720.\n\nAny more gains could even send the price toward the $2,850 resistance zone or even $2,920 in the near term. On the downside, initial support is near the $2,440 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,167 swing low to the $2,717 high.\n\nThe next major support is now near the $2,400 level. A break below the $2,400 support could push the price to $2,280. If the bulls fail to protect the $2,280 support, the price might decline toward $2,165.\n\nLooking at the chart, Ethereum price is clearly trading above $2,400 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). Overall, Ether price could continue to move down if it breaks the $2,420 support zone.\n\nTechnical indicators\n\n4 hours MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is now losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\n4 hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nKey Support Levels \u2013 $2,440, followed by the $2,420 zone.\n\nKey Resistance Levels \u2013 $2,560 and $2,600."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nImmutable X is a layer-2 scaling network built on top of Ethereum, the leading blockchain for decentralized applications. Developed by the Web3 firm Immutable via tech created by StarkWare, Immutable X uses the native ERC-20 token IMX and hosts a number of different blockchain games on its network like Gods Unchained, Guild of Guardians, Illuvium, and Ember Sword, to name a few.\n\nWhile Ethereum proponents argue that its mainnet is among the most decentralized and secure of all cryptocurrencies, it\u2019s also historically suffered from high gas fees and long waits to make transactions. This has long caused friction with NFT creators like those behind the CryptoKitties, who once clogged the mainnet with their digital cats and made it virtually unusable.\n\nBecause NFTs\u2014unique blockchain tokens that signify ownership\u2014are currently so essential to blockchain games, it\u2019s unfeasible for most game developers to build on the Ethereum mainnet. That\u2019s where layer-2 solutions like Immutable X come in, plus Immutable is expanding with another new zkEVM scaling network ahead. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the Immutable platform.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat is Immutable X?\n\nImmutable X is a gaming-focused protocol that\u2019s built atop the Ethereum mainnet\u2019s security, but with the speed and lower transaction costs of a layer-2 scaling network. In other words, it provides additional benefits on top of the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nAccording to Immutable X\u2019s whitepaper, the network allows users to make transactions with zero gas fees. This is partly possible due to Immutable X\u2019s use of StarkWare\u2019s ZK rollup technology which bundles transactions and can enable over 9,000 NFT transactions per second.\n\nWho created Immutable X?\n\nImmutable is the main Web3 firm behind the Immutable X protocol. The company is part blockchain developer and part game publisher, as Immutable developed the NFT card-battling game Gods Unchained and is publishing the action role-playing game Guild of Guardians.\n\nPer Crunchbase data, Immutable has raised nearly $280 million in funding from 32 investors as of January 2024, with firms like Tencent, GameStop Digital Ventures, King River Capital, and the now-defunct Alameda Research investing.\n\nHow does Immutable X work?\n\nImmutable X supports all Ethereum wallets, such as MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet. Users can also create an Immutable Passport to transact on the network. Immutable Passport is designed to be a streamlined and more approachable crypto wallet for gamers, plus it provides a unified identity across games.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe protocol itself sits on top of the Ethereum mainnet, allowing for Immutable X to leverage the mainnet\u2019s decentralization and security for finalizing transactions. But because Immutable X uses ZK rollups, its transactions on its layer-2 network are still able to be fast and cost-effective.\n\nImmutable has built multiple REST application programming interfaces (APIs), meaning they are APIs that adhere to a specific set of architectural standards. Immutable\u2019s REST APIs mean that transactions can consist of an API call, which takes less time than engaging with a protocol directly via a smart contract.\n\nWho's using Immutable X?\n\nA number of different NFT marketplaces and game developers have chosen to offer their products and services on ImmutableX. In June 2022, Immutable Ventures established a massive $500 million fund to invest in Web3 gaming projects being built on Immutable X and to also provide various developers with grant-based funding.\n\nRarible, Mintable, NFTrade, TokenTrove, OKX, and Kinguin are NFT marketplaces that use Immutable X. Brick-and-mortar video game retailer GameStop also launched its NFT marketplace on Immutable X in 2022, but has since discontinued its own crypto wallet and has said that it will shut down its marketplace in February 2024.\n\nGames like IMVU, Guild of Guardians, Habbo, Cross the Ages, Undead Blocks, Ember Sword, Planet Quest, Gods Unchained, WAGMI Defense, and Tiny Colony are building their Web3 elements on Immutable X.\n\nAs the world of Web3 gaming heats up, Immutable X faces competition with other blockchains like Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum Nova, Sui, and Solana to offer a fast and seamless gaming experience.\n\nWhat is Immutable zkEVM?\n\nImmutable is developing more than just Immutable X as its Ethereum gaming platform expands. In March 2023, the firm announced that it is working with competitor Polygon to develop a new Immutable zkEVM scaling network that combines Polygon zkEVM technology with Immutable\u2019s gaming platform.\n\nA number of games have already announced that they\u2019ll be using the Immutable zkEVM, from MetalCore to Shardbound and Elemental Knights. According to an Immutable blog post, the zkEVM network provides native compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine smart contracts, potentially making it easier for developers to port over from EVM chains and utilize an array of third-party tools.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs the Immutable platform grows, the IMX token has become the most valuable gaming token as of this writing, with a market cap of nearly $2.7 billion. That makes it the 37th largest overall cryptocurrency by market cap according to data from CoinGecko, as of January 17, 2024.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "Ethereum Classic Maintains 32% Steady Rise \u2013 What\u2019s Driving ETC Up? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The recent approval of the first Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reverberated across the cryptocurrency landscape, triggering a significant surge in various altcoins, with Ethereum Classic (ETC) taking the spotlight.\n\nOften overshadowed by its more well-known sibling, Ethereum, ETC has emerged as the clear winner in the aftermath of the groundbreaking news, experiencing an impressive surge of over 31% in the past seven days.\n\nEthereum Classic Trading Volume Up\n\nSince the SEC\u2019s approval of the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF on January 10th, Ethereum Classic has skyrocketed by a staggering 30%, currently maintaining a trading value around $26. This meteoric rise has been accompanied by a remarkable 270% increase in trading volume, soaring to a substantial $1.8 billion.\n\nSuch robust figures underscore a palpable surge in investor confidence, suggesting the potential for further gains in the near future.\n\nWhile Bitcoin itself witnessed a modest price increase, briefly touching $47,000, Ethereum stole the limelight by breaking a 20-month barrier and surpassing $2,600.\n\nEthereum Classic currently trading at $26.36 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nThis remarkable 10% surge within a mere 24 hours has positioned Ethereum at its highest value since May 2022. Analysts attribute this impressive performance to Ethereum\u2019s robust underlying technology and recent network upgrades, cementing its status as a favorable option for investors after Bitcoin.\n\nThe approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF is not the sole catalyst for this altcoin rally; the much-anticipated Bitcoin halving event, scheduled for later in the year, is also playing a pivotal role in bolstering bullish sentiment.\n\nETC price action in the weekly timeframe. Source: Coingecko\n\nThis event, occurring approximately every four years, involves a reduction in the number of newly minted Bitcoins and has historically coincided with price appreciation in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe confluence of these factors has created a perfect storm for Ethereum Classic, propelling it towards the coveted $30 mark.\n\nETC Strong Performance\n\nIndustry experts anticipate that this milestone may be achieved soon, fueled by Ethereum Classic\u2019s impressive trading volume and market capitalization, which has surged by 34% to cross the $4 billion mark since the ETF news broke.\n\nHowever, amidst the euphoria surrounding this surge, it remains crucial to acknowledge the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. While the approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF and the impending halving event offer promising prospects, unforeseen factors can swiftly alter market dynamics.\n\nThe recent ascent of Ethereum Classic serves as a compelling testament to the interconnectedness of the cryptocurrency market and the substantial impact of major regulatory decisions.\n\nAs the industry continues to evolve, it will be intriguing to observe how other altcoins respond to these developments and whether Ethereum Classic can sustain its lead in this post-ETF era.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Last month, our feature in The Protocol highlighted how the blockchain design principle of \" intents \" was gaining ascendancy among developers on the industry's cutting edge. This week our Sam Kessler is back with a scoop on how the popular crypto wallet MetaMask, from the Ethereum developer Consensys, has quietly deployed a version of an intents-based routing mechanism that could revolutionize how users interact with blockchains.\n\nWe've also got:\n\nA post-mortem on Ethereum's unexpectedly ugly Dencun upgrade on the Goerli test network.\n\nReactions to Vitalik Buterin's proposed \"gas limit\" increase.\n\nJob cuts at NEAR Foundation as new CEO Illia \"Black Dragon\" Polosukhin goes to work.\n\nHighlights from this week's Protocol Village column on blockchain project updates, featuring Taiko, Chainlink, Hedera, Lagrange and Hacken.\n\nNetwork news\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. (CoinDesk)\n\nMOORE IS MORE. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin , the de facto high priest of the world's largest smart-contracts blockchain, tossed out last week on a Reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" that it would be \"reasonable\" to raise the network's \"gas limit\" \u2013 a very technical way of referring to the amount of transactions that can get jammed into each new block . He suggested an increase to \"40M or so,\" implying a 33% increase over the current limit of 30 million gas. (Yes, for the underinitiated, a unit of gas, in this context, is just\u2026 a gas .) The main reason this is now possible, according to Buterin, is Moore's law \u2013 the observation that computing power seems to double every year . That's relevant because of the amount of data that it takes to store Ethereum's \"state\" \u2013 the complete record of the blockchain's history; as computers become more powerful, they should theoretically be able to handle the higher transaction capacity \u2013 potentially helping to reduce fees for end-users. \"There appears to be a constructive willingness to explore this topic further,\" analysts at Coinbase Institutional wrote. But some members of the Ethereum community have raised yellow flags. P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi, an Ethereum developer, tweeted that such an increase could slow the network's \"sync time.\" Galaxy Research's Christine Kim wrote in a weekly newsletter that \"larger blocks would certainly increase block propagation latency and potentially result in a higher number of missed blocks. \" Marius van der Wijden, an Ethereum software developer, estimated that the network's state is currently around 87 gigabytes (GB), and growing at 2 GB per month. That would put it at 111 GB in a year and 207 GB in five years. In an era where a 1 terabyte thumb drive can be bought on Amazon.com for $19.99 , it doesn't sound too terribly daunting. \"The problem here is not the size itself,\" van der Wijden wrote. \"Everyone will be able to store that amount of data. However, accessing and modifying it will become slower and slower.\" One thing there seems to be some agreement on: It's worth waiting a bit to observe the impact of the upcoming \" Dencun \" upgrade on the network, which will introduce a new way of storing data as \"blobs,\" effectively providing a capacity increase .\n\nStory continues\n\nBLACK DRAGON BREATHES FIRE: Just two months after NEAR Protocol co-founder Illia Polosukhin took over as CEO of the supporting NEAR Foundation, he announced drastic cuts last week in the organization's workforce \u2013 impacting 35 colleagues, or a 40% reduction. According to Polosukhin, the decision came after a \"thorough review of the foundation's activities,\" resulting in feedback that \"the foundation has not always been as effective as it could be.\" Polosukhin noted that the financial picture remains sound, with over $285 million in \"fiat\" or government-issued currencies and 305 million NEAR tokens \"worth over $1B,\" along with $70 million of investments and loans. Referred to in the foundation's communications as the \" Black Dragon ,\" Polosukhin may be under pressure to breathe new life into the alternative layer-1 blockchain, which ranks 32nd among networks based on the much-watched metric of total value locked, or TVL, according to DeFi Llama . Notably NEAR is trying some fresh strategies, pivoting last year to serve as a \" data availability \" network and cutting a deal with restaking pioneer EigenLabs to create a \" fast finality layer \" for Ethereum layer-2 networks.\n\nONE BETTER THAN TWO: The Binance-incubated BNB Chain ecosystem has announced a plan called \" Fusion \" that will see the original BNB Beacon Chain decommissioned while reinforcing the primacy of the sister BNB Smart Chain. According to a statement on the open-source software platform GitHub, the proposal will help to \"overcome legacy services and technical debt, enabling faster iteration and development.\" According to the newsletter Wu Blockchain , \"BNB Beacon Chain is set to exit the stage within the next six months.\"\n\nALSO:\n\nImage tweeted early Wednesday by Ethereum's Tim Beiko with the comment,\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade went live on the Goerli test network early Wednesday but failed to finalize in the expected time. Developers expect the apparent issues to be fixed in the coming days. These likely occurred due to low participation and validators not upgrading parts of their software that would have helped with finalization.

Taiko , developing a so-called type-1 zkEVM to help scale the Ethereum blockchain, announced the launch of \"Katla,\" its alpha-6 testnet, according to a message from the team: \"Katla is laying the foundation for Taiko's mainnet launch in 2024.\"2. Parallel Network has officially launched on mainnet and is open to developers, according to the team , claiming to be the first layer-2 network on Arbitrum Orbit to go live. \"It is also the first non-custodial omni-chain margin protocol, which allows liquidity to be pooled across multiple chains and makes it immediately available on the Parallel Network.\"\n\n3. Chainlink\u2019s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) has integrated Circle\u2019s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) to make it easy for users to transfer USDC across chains, according to a press release. Developers can now build cross-chain use cases via CCIP that involve cross-chain transfers of USDC, including payments and other DeFi interactions, the statement said.\n\n4. The Hedera Council announced its newest member, the electronics maker Hitachi America, Ltd. (Hitachi). According to the team: \"Hitachi aims to begin creating proof-of-concepts for end-to-end supply chain and sustainability solutions on Hedera in the next year.\"\n\n5. Lagrange Labs, developer of a blockchain proving system based on zero-knowledge cryptography, has integrated its light client protocol, Lagrange State Committees (LSC), for the Ethereum layer-2 network Mantle, according to the team . LSCs \"are a ZK light client protocol for optimistic rollups (ORUs), designed through combining Lagrange\u2019s ZK MapReduce Coprocessor and EigenLayer restaking. Each state committee borrows security from Ethereum by dual staking, both through EigenLayer restaking and with the rollup\u2019s native token.\"\n\n6. Hacken, a blockchain security auditor, has introduced an open-source Rust library for code coverage generation for WASM-based protocols, according to the team: \"Code Coverage utilities are crucial for automation testing to ascertain the thoroughness of code examination. Without it, some critical components can remain untested. While it is available for Ethereum-based projects, WASM-based protocols don't have it. Wasmcov by Hacken is already integrated into the Radix ecosystem, which enables all Radix-built projects to utilize code coverage measurement. The next protocol to get it will be NEAR. The rest can set it up manually.\"\n\nSee the entire Protocol Village list from this past week here.\n\nMetaMask\u2019s Secret \u2018Intents\u2019 Project Could Radically Change How Users Interact With Blockchains\n\nMetaMask has quietly rolled out a limited version of its new routing tech into the new Smart Swaps feature. (MetaMask, modified by CoinDesk)\n\nMetaMask, the most popular crypto wallet on Ethereum, is testing a new \"transaction routing\" technology that's likely to have major ramifications for how value flows through the second-biggest blockchain network.\n\nCoinDesk learned of the new technology from developers briefed on the plan, and key details were subsequently confirmed by officials with MetaMask's parent company, Consensys.\n\nThe effort capitalizes on a concept known in blockchain circles as \" intents \" that is rapidly gaining momentum, potentially leading to a radical shift in how people interact with blockchains: Rather than specifying how they want to get something done (e.g. \"sell X tokens on Y exchange for Z price\"), blockchain users may only need to specify what they want the outcome to be (e.g. \"I want the best price for my tokens\").\n\nThe \"what\" versus \"how\" distinction might seem subtle, but it's a big departure from how MetaMask and other crypto wallets worked originally \u2013 as neutral, relatively simple pieces of software for connecting users to blockchains. The goal with the new tech is for users to get better execution on their transactions and improved ease of use, but intent-based programs ultimately represent a big shift to where \u2013 and to whom \u2013 value flows on blockchains.\n\nThe new technology is being built by Special Mechanisms Group (SMG), a blockchain infrastructure firm that MetaMask owner Consensys purchased last year.\n\nRead the full story by Sam Kessler here\n\nMoney Center\n\nFundraisings\n\nRenzo , an interface for the liquid restaking protocol EigenLayer , has raised $3.2M, according to the team: \"Maven11 led the Renzo seed round which also saw follow-on investments from Figment Capital, SevenX, IOSG and Paper Ventures.\"\n\nHashKey Group , which operates the Hong Kong-based crypto exchange, has \u201cnearly\u201d met its $100 million fundraising target, the firm said Tuesday. HashKey announced the fundraising round in August, shortly after it won a license from Hong Kong\u2019s security regulator to offer retail crypto trading . The firm did not disclose the investors in the round and now claims a valuation of $1.2 billion post-raise, giving it \u201cunicorn\u201d status.\n\nBitfinity Network , a Web3 infrastructure firm, announced it has successfully secured over $7 million in funding from notable backers, including Polychain Capital and ParaFi Capital, advancing its mission to establish off-chain infrastructure for Bitcoin and Ordinals.\n\nDeals and Grants\n\nPush Protocol , the communication protocol of Web3, recently concluded their Billion Reasons to Build (BRB) developer tour in India, according to the team: \"During the hackathon, Aditya Bisht successfully solved one of its hardest coding challenges belonging to the Ethereum Foundation \u2013 quantum proofing the Ethereum Network. Bisht's creation of an account abstraction smart contract effectively conceals public keys, enhancing the network's defense against quantum decryption.\"\n\nThe Hedera and Algorand ecosystems have joined to Form DeRec Alliance. (DeRec stands for \"decentralized recovery.\") According to the team: \"Entities from across the Hedera and Algorand ecosystems including the HBAR Foundation, Algorand Foundation, Hashgraph Association, Swirlds Labs, and DLT Science Foundation, along with industry partners The Building Blocks and BankSocial, are partnering to develop a new interoperability recovery standard which will simplify the recovery & adoption of crypto and other assets.\"\n\nSui , a layer-1 blockchain, is getting DePIN and DeWi through a groundbreaking partnership with Karrier One, according to the team: \"The deal also includes strategic investment from Sui to fuel the expansion of Karrier One\u2019s global footprint and deployment on Sui. The technical integration will feature DePIN services powered by the Sui blockchain and the launch of a Karrier One Decentralized Wireless (DeWi) network token on Sui.\"\n\nData and Tokens\n\nAmong Major Layer-2 Networks, ZkSync Era Has the Cheapest Average Transactions\n\nWe finally got around to reading Messari analyst Seth Bloomberg's excellent report out a few weeks ago titled, \" The Onchain Economics of ZK Rollups .\" It provides a good snapshot of the competition between major Ethereum layer-2 networks as 2023 closed out. The report reinforced the oft-repeated observation that \"Data publishing (or data availability) generally remains the highest on-chain cost for rollups\" \u2013 thus underscoring the significance of Ethereum's upcoming \"Dencun\" upgrade, which is supposed to lead to drastic reductions in those expenses. But there are different ways to handle the data, of course, and the zkSync Era project stands out in that it \"only posts state diffs to Ethereum,\" while most rollup networks \"publish the full rollup transaction data.\" Per the report: \"In simple terms, publishing state diffs means that if two users send ETH and other tokens to each other multiple times, only the net differences in their account balances need to be published to Ethereum instead of the full transaction history between the two users.\" The upshot? ZkSync Era has the lowest average transaction costs, at 18 cents, seen as a nice bargain compared with Polygon zkEVM's 45 cents.\n\nCalendar"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has reached yet another remarkable achievement, dominating decentralized finances (DeFi) total value locked (TVL) by 80%. Meanwhile, its native token, Ether, aims at the $3,000 price zone, threatening a short squeeze soon.\n\nRemarkably, the total value locked on Ethereum\u2019s first layer surged 231% in the last 24 hours to $100.31 billion. This sums up to recent increases, resulting in 255% and 283% changes in the last seven and 30 days, respectively.\n\nTotal value locked on the top 5 DeFi chains. Source: DefiLlama\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the above data, retrieved by Finbold from DefiLlama, does not include Ethereum\u2019s second layers. For example, Arbitrum (ARB) has its own $2.62 billion in total value locked, ranking fourth among the DeFi chains.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 80% dominance on DeFi by total value locked\n\nInterestingly, Tron (TRX) holds the second place with over 13 times less TVL than Ethereum, with $8.063 billion.\n\nIn this context, Ethereum layer-1 now dominates the DeFi ecosystem with an impressive 80.62% TVL dominance. Tron gets a share of 6.23%, mostly on stablecoins, while BNB Chain (BNB) and Arbitrum have over 2%. Solana (SOL) is the fifth most valuable DeFi chain with a $1.34 billion TVL and a 1.04% dominance.\n\nPie chart: Total value locked in all chains. Source: DefiLlama\n\nEthereum\u2019s total value locked is distributed among 1004 DeFi protocols, contributing to its ecosystem.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, ETH is trading at $2,554 per token by press time, slightly up 2% in the last 24 hours. Ether reached $2,714, its highest price of 2024, so far. On the other hand, $2,140 was the lowest for the first month of the year.\n\nETH/USD 4-hour price chart.

        "title": "US ETF market heats up with Ethereum: what you need to know - crypto.news",
        "content": "The excitement over spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs has calmed, but a fresh wave of enthusiasm is emerging. Could the prospect of an Ethereum (ETH) ETF propel the crypto market to new heights?\n\nIn the United States, competition is unfolding for supremacy in the exchange-traded fund (ETF) market, with a particular emphasis on prominent crypto assets. While the initial funds, both operational and awaiting regulatory approval, were exclusively linked to Bitcoin, a new wave of ETFs has seized the spotlight. These latest offerings enable investors to speculate on the price movements of ETH, the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nWhy does the market need cryptocurrency ETFs?\n\nThe launch of the first ETFs pegged to the price of Ethereum occurred two years following the introduction of the first Bitcoin futures ETF in the United States \u2013 the Bitcoin Strategy ETF from ProShares, with shares traded on exchanges under the ticker BITO. At that time, the launch coincided with the pinnacle of excitement surrounding the crypto market, marked by historical record highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The landscape has evolved somewhat since then: the crypto industry is currently grappling with substantial regulatory scrutiny globally, and the trading volume on crypto exchanges has dwindled to its lowest point in three years.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum ETF becomes most attractive prospect, poll shows\n\nIn the context of the cryptocurrency market, ETFs enable investors to track the price movements of coins without directly owning them. Rather than navigating exchanges and wallets independently, investors can purchase ETF shares through standard brokerage accounts. This investment approach is more prevalent among clients of management companies or pension funds in the United States.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has given the green light to several Bitcoin ETFs, specifically those based on futures contracts. Unlike spot ETFs, futures ETFs do not offer direct ownership of cryptocurrency and do not entail its delivery (i.e., buying it on the market). Instead, they track futures contracts that forecast their price at a future date. Several market players introduced Ethereum futures funds on October 2, 2023.\n\nProShares, Bitwise, and VanEck, among others, debuted their Ethereum funds after receiving regulatory approval to launch them. A few hours before the opening of the American market and the commencement of fund trading, the price of the ETH cryptocurrency surged by almost 5%. However, during the trading session, it started to decline, and within a day, it had dropped even lower, erasing all the previous gains.\n\nSource: CoinMarketCap\n\nDo we need an Ethereum ETF?\n\nInvestor interest in Ethereum could reignite if its prices recover to previous highs, particularly considering that many prefer Ether to Bitcoin due to numerous options for utilizing its blockchain as infrastructure for various projects and financial services.\n\nBack in May 2023, a few months before the launch of their Ethereum-ETF, VanEck analysts published an extensive report in which they shared the results of a study on the technical component of the Ethereum blockchain and its prospects. Based on their calculations and the rationale for the demand for the ETH cryptocurrency as \u201cfuel\u201d for future infrastructure, they predicted a range of future prices for the coin.\n\nSource: VanEck\n\nAccording to their estimates, by 2030, the price of ETH under the \u201cbase\u201d scenario will be $11,848, and under the \u201cbullish\u201d scenario, the coin will exceed $51,000. Moreover, in the worst-case scenario and with a lack of proper demand, the ETH exchange rate, according to their estimates, may drop to almost $300.\n\nSource: VanEck\n\nWho has applied for Ethereum ETFs?\n\nIn August 2023, crypto asset manager Valkyrie announced the conversion of its Bitcoin futures ETF into a fund that invests in Ethereum futures. At the beginning of October, several market players, including ProShares, Bitwise, and VanEck, launched futures ETFs on Ethereum.\n\nIn September 2023, entrepreneur Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest also applied for a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nIn November 2023, the world\u2019s largest investment firm, BlackRock, filed with the SEC to list a spot ETF on Ethereum.\n\nYou might also like: SEC postpones decision on Grayscale\u2019s application for spot Ethereum ETF\n\nWill applications for spot Ethereum ETFs be approved?\n\n\n\nAnalysts believe that spot Ethereum ETFs could also be approved within a year. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said he does not see a scenario in which Bitcoin ETFs will be authorized but Ethereum ETFs will not.\n\nThe expert added that he estimates the likelihood that the SEC will approve spot Ethereum ETFs before May is 70%. Lawyer Joe Carlasar believes the agency will do this before the end of the year, but \u201cthe process will take longer than people expect.\u201d\n\nBloomberg analyst James Seyffart is confident that the SEC will \u201cgive the green light\u201d to spot Ethereum ETFs. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is now expecting the launch of spot ETH ETFs.\n\nHowever, SEC Chair Gary Gensler is exercising caution on Ethereum. While acknowledging the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, he emphasized that this was specific to Bitcoin as a non-security commodity token.\n\nYou might also like: SEC postpones deadline for decision on Invesco Galaxy spot Ethereum ETF\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

Discover SCENE\n\nThe rollout of Ethereum layer-2 scaling network Blast hasn\u2019t been without controversy, but even so, users have pumped the project with more than $1.3 billion in search of yield and airdrop rewards. Blast has now launched its test network, and is attempting to bring app developers into its ecosystem with a similar promise of airdropped tokens.\n\nOn Tuesday, Blast announced that its testnet is now live, and that the project is trying to attract developers to start building with the launch of a \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition.\n\nDevelopers who enter their Blast apps into the competition will have the first chance to earn token rewards in the upcoming airdrop, Blast wrote on Twitter, with the winning apps being \u201cpromoted\u201d to the mainnet when it goes live in late February.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlast founder Tieshun \u201cPacman\u201d Roquerre will judge the contest along with representatives from investors Paradigm and Standard Crypto, among others. Pacman and fellow Blast team members will also offer guidance and mentorship to developers along the way.\n\nThe Blast Testnet is OFFICIALLY LIVE With it, the Blast BIG BANG competition officially begins. Dapps can compete to get in front of 100k users & $1.3B in TVL, connect with top investors, and earn the Blast Airdrop. pic.twitter.com/Cajnmtxtd3 \u2014 Blast (@Blast_L2) January 16, 2024\n\nPacman is also the founder of Blur, the leading NFT marketplace, and Blast\u2019s launch appears to be following much the same strategy as it attempts to leapfrog over existing Ethereum layer-2 networks\u2014that is, by using potentially sizable token incentives.\n\nBlur handed out over $800 million worth of BLUR tokens in 2023 to NFT traders, and the initial round of airdropped tokens in February coincided with the platform topping OpenSea as the most-used marketplace in terms of trading volume.\n\nAccording to a Tuesday tweet thread, blast will hand out half of its total airdrop to users and the other half to developers. On the former front, more than 100,000 total wallets have now locked up over $1.3 billion worth of cryptocurrency to earn \u201cBlast points,\u201d which will eventually convert to airdropped tokens once the Blast mainnet is live.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith the Big Bang competition and beyond, Blast aims to get decentralized app (dapp) creators to start building to earn a share of the other half of the airdrop.\n\nBlast\u2019s surging deposits and user tally comes following pushback to the platform\u2019s November launch. Crypto users and fellow developers complained about Blast\u2019s approach to launching a bridge to take deposits before the Blast network was actually ready and live, as well as blocking users from withdrawing their funds until the mainnet debuts in February.\n\nParadigm, one of the most prominent backers of both Blast and Blur, took the team to task following the initial launch, with Head of Research and General Partner Dan Robinson tweeting that the announcement \u201ccrossed lines in both messaging and execution.\u201d\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "A recent conversation with Vitalik Buterin on X platform sheds light on a few important topics regarding L2 networks \u2013 the main scalability tool for the Ethereum network.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt its core, an L2 solution is a secondary framework or protocol built atop the Ethereum blockchain, designed to increase transaction capacity and speed without compromising the security provided by the main chain, known as layer 1 (L1). This conversation is vital because it helps users understand the types of solutions available and their respective tradeoffs.\n\nYeah I agree with this. I called them \"security-favoring\" vs \"scale-favoring\" here, but we can probably come up with better terms (\"strong L2\" vs \"light L2\" perhaps?)https://t.co/oSPZkB3Xo3 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 16, 2024\n\nButerin participated in a discussion clarifying that \"L2s\" encompass both rollups and validiums. The distinction is important for users to grasp the different security and scalability features. Rollups are \"security-favoring\" solutions that bundle or \"roll up\" transactions into a single proof, which is posted to the main chain.\n\nThis process allows for high security, as the L1 blockchain directly secures them. In contrast, validiums are \"scale-favoring,\" designed to boost capacity by storing data off-chain but with proofs still on-chain, offering slightly less security for much greater scalability.\n\nThe distinction is nuanced but significant. While rollups are more expensive due to the data being posted on-chain, they offer higher security. Validiums, on the other hand, provide a cheaper alternative, with a slight tradeoff in security. Buterin suggests that the terminology should reflect these differences without delegitimizing either option. In the spectrum of L2 solutions, he proposes terms like \"strong L2\" for rollups and \"light L2\" for validiums to help users navigate their choices better.\n\nInterestingly, Buterin also points out that the architecture of L2 solutions is not strictly about security levels. He previously attempted to categorize these layers but recognized that there is a significant \"intermediate space\" between rollups and validiums, further complicating the classification."

        "content": "The widely-anticipated Dencun upgrade for the Ethereum network is live on the Goerli testnet. However, the upgrade is experiencing some issues.\n\nAccording to a livestream on YouTube, Dencun was launched on Goerli at 6:32 UTC on Wednesday, but the chain appears to have split as it failed to finalize when expected.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dencun Upgrade Goes Live\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is Ethereum\u2019s biggest since the Shapella upgrade in April 2023. While Shapella enabled the withdrawal of staked ether (stETH) on the network, the former is expected to significantly reduce transaction costs on layer 2 (L2) networks. They are significant steps in Ethereum\u2019s transition from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) after the Merge.\n\nDencun is expected to enhance Ethereum L2 rollup efficiency through a mechanism called proto-danksharding or ephemeral blobs (EIP-4844). The approach introduces temporary storage space for higher transactional throughput by allowing access to off-chain data to reduce storage demands. This process will slash L2 transaction costs by 10x or more as analysts believe high costs hamper the growth of the protocols.\n\nThe upgrade was initially slated for October 2023 but moved to late Q1 or early Q2 2024. It will be implemented in three phases, with Goerli\u2019s deployment being the first. The subsequent implementation will be on the Sepolia testnet on January 31 and then the Holesky testnet on February 7 before the final release on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nFinality Issues\n\nDencun\u2019s deployment on Goerli failed to reach a consensus and finality. Developers believe this may be because of low participation, roughly 80%, and validators being offline. Pseudonymous X user Terence explained that validators could be offline due to operators not upgrading a piece of software or the presence of a bug.\n\nDue to Goerli having a \u201chighly\u201d diverse set of validators, it could take a while before the issue becomes clear. Regardless, developers intend to conduct a proper non-finality test over the next few hours or days.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I will not base my assessment of Goerli Deneb\u2019s readiness on the immediate finality results. It will take time to accurately evaluate the status. Therefore, before someone claims that the Goerli hard fork failed and Deneb is delayed, we should allow time for a proper analysis,\u201d Terence stated."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Dencun Upgrade Deployed Successfully on Goerli Testnet\n\nEthereum's core developers have taken a significant step towards improving the network's scalability with the deployment of the Dencun upgrade on the Goerli testnet on January 24, 2024, at around 1:35 a.m. ET. However, the upgrade faced issues in the validator clients' ability to sync with each other.\n\nParithosh Jayanthi, DevOps engineer at the Ethereum Foundation, later announced that the fix was patched in and the Dencun fork on Goerli was finalized. In preparation for this transition, the development team has opted for a phased approach, initially implementing the upgrade on various testnets.\n\nThe successful deployment on the Goerli testnet marks the first phase of a gradual rollout, with subsequent implementations planned for the Sepolia and Holesky testnets before the final mainnet release in Q1 2024.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade introduces EIP-4844, a novel transaction mechanism known as ephemeral blobs or proto-danksharding. This approach allows Ethereum nodes to temporarily store and access off-chain data, reducing storage demands and lowering transaction costs. By reducing transaction costs, EIP-4844 will make it more affordable to use Ethereum dApps and Layer 2 solutions.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is a positive development for the Ethereum ecosystem, bringing the network closer to enhanced scalability and lower transaction costs. The phased rollout approach minimizes risks and allows for thorough testing, ensuring a successful transition to the upgraded network.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "There has been a steady fall in active validator count on Ethereum since the 4th of January.\n\nETH accumulation persists among coin traders.\n\nThe Ethereum [ETH] Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network has witnessed a sharp drop in active validators, hitting a year-to-date low on the 12th of January, according to data from Glassnode.\n\nAMBCrypto found that the decline began on the 4th of January, the same day that the total number of validators that exited the network\u2019s validator pool voluntarily climbed to an all-time high of 17,821.\n\nThis trend emerged just a day after Matrixport, a prominent crypto investment services provider, predicted a potential rejection of all Bitcoin ETF applications by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nFollowing the report\u2019s publication, the prices of leading assets plummeted, causing over $500 million in liquidations.\n\nMany feared that Matrixport\u2019s predictions might be accurate and result in a severe market decline, hence the surge in the daily count of validators that left the Ethereum network on the 4th of January.\n\nWhile the daily active validator count on the PoS chain has begun to rise, it still sits at low levels recorded in December.\n\nAs of the 14th of January, the active validator count on Ethereum totaled 897,121. Likewise, with the rise in ETH\u2019s price post-ETF approval, voluntary exits from the chain have reduced.\n\nOn the 14th of January, only 124 validators left the network, data from Glassnode showed.\n\nBullish momentum intensifies\n\nAt press time, ETH exchanged hands at $2,517, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The coin\u2019s price has risen by 15% in the last week.\n\nIts price movements assessed on a weekly chart revealed that bullish pressure persisted. This was gleaned from ETH\u2019s momentum indicators, showing that traders have continued accumulating the altcoin.\n\nFor example, the coin\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) indicators were spotted at 70.37 and 87.02, respectively. These levels suggested that buying pressure exceeded coin sell-offs despite the recent uptick.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nIt is, however, key to note that these RSI and MFI values typically indicate an overheated market. Hence, a minor drawback in ETH\u2019s value should be anticipated.\n\nETH\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) remained in an uptrend and positioned above the zero line at press time. Returning a value of 0.16, ETH\u2019s CMF showed a steady supply of liquidity required to sustain a price rally."

        "content": "Staked Ethereum (ETH) withdrawals hit a record high last week.\n\nThe surge appears to be heavily linked to Celsius\u2019 bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nDespite the mass-staked ETH withdrawals, the network impact is expected to be minimal.\n\nOver the past two weeks, the Ethereum (ETH) network has experienced a spike in validator exits. Capping off this trend last week, this surge in validator exits culminated in the network recording over 650,000 ETH in staked ETH withdrawals, the largest amount of redemption in a single week since withdrawals were enabled with the Shanghai upgrade. The record withdrawal begs the question of what is driving this surge.\n\nCelsius Bankruptcy Proceedings at the Helm?\n\nDisclosing last week\u2019s record-staked ETH outflows on Monday, January 15, 21.co researcher Tom Wan shared Dune Analytics data showing that bankrupt crypto lender Celsius and staking service provider Figment were the largest contributors to the withdrawal spike in the past week. Specifically, withdrawals directly attributed to Celsius and Figment accounted for over 85% of staked ETH withdrawals, with 206.9k ETH and 356.4k ETH, respectively.\n\nChart showing staked ETH withdrawals by entity. Source: Tom Wan\n\nWhile the data on face value suggests Figment clients and not Celsius are the primary drivers of the recent surge in staked ETH withdrawals, Wan has previously suggested that the reverse is more likely the case. Wan had noted that Celsius was also a Figment client with at least 197,000 ETH staked through the platform. As such, the analyst suggested that it was likely that the bulk of the ETH being withdrawn by Figment belongs to Celsius.\n\nThe move follows plans revealed by the bankrupt lender earlier in the month to unstake ETH to offset restructuring costs and settle creditors. At the time of writing, Arkham Intelligence data suggests that Celsius holds over 580,000 ETH worth a staggering $1.4 billion at current rates.\n\nUnderstanding The Impact of Celsius\u2019 Staking Withdrawals on Ethereum\n\nCelsius\u2019s staked ETH withdrawals are unlikely to cause dire consequences for the Ethereum network aside from increasing the unstaking wait time due to Ethereum\u2019s \u201cchurn limit,\u201d which limits the number of validators that can exit or enter the network to 2,925 per day.\n\nDespite technically reducing the validator count and amount of ETH securing the network, the Ethereum staking contract still holds over 36 million ETH, per Etherscan data at the time of writing.\n\nAt the same time, while Celsius\u2019 bankruptcy proceedings place selling pressure on the price of ETH, the firm is unlikely to unload its holdings all at once as it would also impact the value of its holdings.\n\nAmid the looming selling pressure, ETH\u2019s price continues to hold steady. ETH is trading over $2,500 at the time of writing, up over 10% in the past seven days per CoinMarketCap data.\n\nETH/USD 4-hour candle chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe asset has seen increased attention as market participants speculate that the U.S. SEC is set to approve spot Ethereum ETFs after issuing approvals for similar products backed by Bitcoin. Amid the asset\u2019s strong showing, analysts like \u201cIncomeSharks\u201d have tipped ETH to surge above the $3,500 price point.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nDespite last week\u2019s record withdrawal, the Ethereum staking contract still holds over 36 million ETH.\n\nDue to potential adverse price effects, Celsius will unlikely dump all its ETH holdings at once.\n\nCelsius is not the only bankrupt crypto firm putting selling pressure on the price of ETH. FTX and Alameda have also unloaded ETH holdings to settle creditors in the past week.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nWith staked ETH withdrawals reaching record highs, it is necessary to understand what is driving the surge and whether it is a cause for panic.\n\nRead this for more on the recent surge in Ethereum validator exits and its impact on the network:\n\nEthereum Validator Exit Leads to Backlogged Queue on Network\n\n\n\nLearn more about the recent allegations facing the Polygon Foundation:\n\nPolygon Foundation Faces 400M MATIC Misappropriation Claims"

The two blockchain foundations will submit the integration proposal to their respective governance members today to open up the proposal for discussion, and voting will take place from 26 January to 2 February 2024.\u201d\n\nAccording to the announcement, the merger will aim to consolidate blockchains and combine the blockchains\u2019 strengths, all while simultaneously creating Asia\u2019s largest blockchain ecosystem.\n\n\u201cThe proposal aims to create a new industry leader with a technologically superior blockchain that supports both EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and CosmWasm, as well as one of the largest ecosystems of DApps (decentralized applications) and users in Asia. The two foundations will also merge into one organization, combining their technology, services, and business networks which include Kakao, LINE, and many other strategic partners.\u201d\n\nAccording to the proposal, holders of Klaytn and Finschia\u2019s native tokens, KLAY and FNSA, will be able to swap out their old tokens for new native tokens once they are issued.\n\n\u201cDrawing on the combined experience of both foundations, the proposed tokenomics for this new native coin will focus heavily on delivering sustainable value creation. This will be achieved via a lower base inflation rate and a three-layer burning model designed to drive the coin towards deflation as network activity increases.\u201d\n\nThe proposed merger also promises to enhance the blockchain\u2019s level of decentralization, modes of governance, and interoperability with other blockchains.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to be taking the first step toward unlocking the enormous synergy of merging the public blockchains started by Kakao and LINE, which are both leading IT companies in Asia. We will give our best to make this merge an opportunity to innovate and lead the Asian blockchain industry in both technology and adoption.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum ETFs in Focus As Spot Bitcoin Funds Launch - etf.com",
        "content": "Michael Jordan of the championship Chicago Bulls had Scottie Pippen. Warren Buffett had the late, great Charlie Munger. And bitcoin has ethereum.\n\nWhile the two cryptocurrencies are only related through their connection to the blockchain, these best-known crypto stars are getting more attention than ever. That\u2019s saying something, given how investors have flocked to crypto\u2014especially since the pandemic in 2020.\n\nWith the two most notable \u201ccoins,\u201d the main difference is how ethereum takes bitcoin\u2019s role a step further. Both use the digital ledger known as blockchain, which allows for financial transactions outside of the purview of governments and banks. But ethereum, which launched about ten years ago (and roughly five years after bitcoin) consists of a network designed to build decentralized applications, while bitcoin is closer to a \u201cdigital asset.\u201d\n\nBy way of analogy, it\u2019s the difference between a jewelry store selling gold and the gold itself. Ethereum transactions include executable code that serves as a mechanism to arrange digital contracts between parties. Also, each block on the ethereum network takes a fraction of the time to create compared to that same process on the bitcoin network.\n\nSo now that spot bitcoin ETFs have listed on U.S. stock exchanges (11 of them initially on Jan. 11), will ethereum come next? Wall Street is already chattering about this and a recent surge in ethereum\u2019s price was likely based on that assumption. But as with bitcoin, investors do not have to wait until spot \u201cether\u201d is available in ETF form. Existing ETFs get investors most of the way there.\n\nEthereum Futures ETFs Seek Spot Status\n\nThe dominant player in this area currently is the $7.6 billion Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which debuted in December 2017.\n\nLet's be careful because it's a trust traded over-the-counter and not technically an exchange-traded fund. Still, it's seeking to convert to a spot ethereum fund so it bears mentioning.\n\nWith an expense ratio of 2.50%, astronomical for the ETF world, ETHE has \u201cde-fied\u201d (pun intended) the odds. Or has it? ETF investors have been eager to get their hands on anything crypto these past few years. In addition, ETHE currently trades at a discount of 15% compared to the spot price of ethereum, according to YCharts data. This further makes a case where investors would rather own a diluted version of the real thing than nothing at all. Bitcoin presents a similar situation.\n\nOther competitors in the \u201cnot spot ethereum but similar to it\u201d category include the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) and the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH). That trio holds assets of $19.7 million, $18.4 million and $2.6 million respectively, though all have been around just a few months. However, they also have much lower expense ratios.\n\nSince October 2023, ETHE has been a runaway train, having nearly doubled, while the others are \u201conly\u201d up 19% or more. So far in 2024, ETHE is up 9%, about the same as the three much smaller but much less costly peers.\n\nEthereum to Follow Bitcoin?\n\nAll this could prove moot if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission treats ethereum exchange-traded products as it did those related to bitcoin\u2014with skepticism and stonewalling. But don\u2019t rule out a bonanza. While spot Bitcoin ETFs are currently the toast of the financial services industry, the fever could potentially spread to ethereum and many of the less commonly used but emerging crypto asset types.\n\nShould that occur, the only prescription won\u2019t be, as the iconic line from Saturday Night Live sketch goes, \u201cmore cowbell.\u201d It will be\u2014yikes!\u2014more ETF industry employees and regulators."

        "title": "ETH News: Ethereum Price Dominance Over Bitcoin Grows - CoinGape",
        "content": "While the Bitcoin price has been consolidating largely post-ETF approval, Ethereum (ETH) has been making strong upside moves, thereby closing the gap with BTC. At press time, the Ethereum price is trading 1.44% up at a price of $2,564 with a market cap of $308 billion.\n\nThe Ethereum Price Dominance\n\nAccording to insights provided by on-chain data provider Santiment, Ethereum\u2019s price dominance has experienced a notable surge against Bitcoin, marking a +22.4% increase over the past week. This period has witnessed the creation of 89.4K new Ethereum addresses per day, further underscoring the platform\u2019s growing traction. Notably, a staggering 96.3K wallets were created just yesterday.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn addition to these on-chain activities, Santiment\u2019s data reveals a significant trend in Ethereum\u2019s supply on exchanges, nearing its All-Time Low of 8.05%. This movement toward self-custody and staking implies a reduced risk of an imminent selloff, presenting a more favorable scenario compared to concerns arising from a rising supply on exchanges. These on-chain dynamics shed light on Ethereum\u2019s current market strength and its potential implications for future price movements.\n\nETH Price Action Going Ahead\n\nIn the recent trading session on Tuesday, Ethereum price initially experienced a slight pullback, testing the crucial $2,500 level. Notably, this level had previously served as significant resistance but now appears to be providing substantial support for the cryptocurrency. The price action suggests Ethereum\u2019s attempt to enter a consolidation phase.\n\nThe $2,700 level emerges as a key threshold, representing the upper boundary of the short-term trading range. Analysts consider this level crucial, and a breakthrough could set the stage for a potential market surge, with Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) traders likely to join the rally. Beyond $2,700, the Ethereum price could further rally all the way to $3,400.\n\nConversely, a downside scenario could unfold if the second-largest crypto by market cap breaks below the hammer formed during the Monday session. In such a case, the cryptocurrency might see a downward movement toward the 20-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), situated around the $2,300 level. Traders are closely monitoring these critical levels, anticipating potential shifts in Ethereum\u2019s short-term trajectory."

        "title": "Ethereum Trouncing Bitcoin, ETH/BTC Ratio Bouncing Higher: Will This Trend Continue? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Amidst a volatile crypto market, Ethereum (ETH) is gaining momentum, outperforming its long-time rival Bitcoin (BTC). According to Kaiko data, the ETH/BTC ratio has steadily risen, rebounding from multi-year lows.\n\nETH/BTC Ratio Rising, ETH Momentum Building\n\nThe ETH/BTC ratio technically gauges market sentiment towards these two leading crypto. The recent rebound indicates investors are increasingly bullish on Ethereum\u2019s potential relative to Bitcoin.\n\nThis upward trajectory is fueled by growing optimism surrounding the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs and the general confidence that markets will trend higher in 2024. The prospect of this product entering the market has also injected fresh energy into the ETH ecosystem, lifting the second most valuable coin by market cap.\n\nRelated Reading: Institutional Inflows Into XRP Surges 244% Amid ETF Speculation\n\nAfter protracted lower lows, the ETH/BTC ratio began rising immediately after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs last week. This unexpected shift, analysts observe, is primarily because of increasing confidence in the SEC approving a similar product for ETH.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETFs, which would provide direct exposure to the Ethereum market, would make it easier for institutional investors to benefit from the volatility of ETH. So far, the SEC has approved an Ethereum Futures ETF, which, unlike the spot ETF, tracks an index, not the direct price of this asset.\n\nBlackrock is among the leading Wall Street giants interested in issuing a spot Ethereum ETF. Considering its history of success, the decision by one of the world\u2019s leading asset managers to apply for this product is an endorsement of its prospects. Earlier, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, said Ethereum, despite its scaling challenge, might spearhead the tokenization drive in the years ahead.\n\nUS SEC Yet To Clarify Whether Ethereum Is A Commodity Or Security\n\nEven so, the SEC has yet to clarify whether ETH, a coin pre-mined with some assets distributed to the Ethereum Foundation, is a commodity like Bitcoin. Earlier, Gary Gensler, the chairperson of the SEC, was cornered by the United States policymakers to give the agency\u2019s stand on the coin but didn\u2019t.\n\nNonetheless, with the prospect of spotting Ethereum ETFs and the dominance of Ethereum in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), ETH will likely continue outperforming BTC in the coming months. Price action data shows that ETH is already up 20% versus BTC in the past trading week.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Nayms, the leading blockchain-based marketplace for alternative risk transfer and capitalization, has announced its successful launch on Base, a secure and low-cost Ethereum layer-2 solution. This collaboration aims to provide investors with streamlined access to tokenized (re)insurance opportunities, revolutionizing the insurance industry by leveraging blockchain technology.\n\nBuilding on the success of its initial investment offerings, Nayms continues to innovate in reshaping the insurance landscape. The first product launched on Base is an Industry Loss Warranty (ILW) contract, specifically reinsuring against weather-related catastrophic events in Florida. Institutional investors can now earn yield on their capital within a Bermuda-regulated segregated account structure. The target returns range from mid to high teens, paid through (re)insurance premiums by real (re)insureds seeking risk coverage. Early investors can also enjoy an additional reward of NAYM tokens, equivalent to up to 15% of their invested capital.\n\nTokenization emerges as a pivotal element in the evolving insurance sector, providing institutional investors with a unique avenue to diversify their portfolios. Nayms\u2019 tokenized offerings span (re)insurance for property and casualty (P&C) risks, including Cyber, Errors and Omissions, Directors and Officers coverage, crime/specie, and various Industry Loss Warranty products. This level of exposure, traditionally limited to major institutional investors, is now accessible to all qualified investors through tokenization.\n\nKey benefits of tokenized (re)insurance exposure for qualified investors include diversification of returns from the broader crypto market, access to historically challenging private markets now in a tokenized wrapper, high-yield returns with liquidity and low volatility, and the safety and security of the decentralized Ethereum network at a low cost, with faster settlement times through Base Layer 2.\n\nNayms\u2019 Co-Founder and CTO, Ted Georgas, expressed enthusiasm about the Base launch, stating, \u201cWe are excited to be launching on Base, our first Ethereum Layer 2 network. Our deployment was seamless as it is fully EVM compliant, and we look forward to leveraging the reduced fees and easy onramp that Base provides.\u201d\n\nThe ILW market targeted by Nayms is a crucial segment of the global catastrophe reinsurance market, generating over $300 billion in annual renewal premiums. Nayms\u2019 ILW introduces an innovative approach by safeguarding buyers against named windstorms in Florida, requiring two independent storms to each cause damage exceeding $10 billion to trigger indemnification during the 2024 in-force period. The use of USD Coin (USDC) as collateral within an independently audited Ethereum smart contract enhances transparency and operational efficiency.\n\nAbout Nayms\n\nNayms is a fully regulated marketplace for on-chain insurance, pioneering a new digital asset risk market. Regulated brokers and underwriters can connect with digital asset capital providers to share in premiums and liabilities covering digital asset risk. Nayms\u2019 traceable smart contract operates on a trustless system, enabling insurance brokers to place contracts between market participants across various sectors and share in the future value of open trade.\n\nImage by David Jorre from Unsplash\n\nRead other stories: Ask Me Anything\u2026 Part 6\n\nDigiFT and HashKey Capital Forge Strategic Partnership for Regulated Treasury Management and Investments"

        "content": "Ethereum saw a surge in activity due to rising interest in Inscriptions.\n\nA large amount of ETH got unstaked due to Celsius and Figment.\n\nRecently, Ethereum [ETH] experienced a massive uptick in network activity, partly driven by an increasing interest in Inscriptions.\n\nGas usage on the rise\n\nInscriptions constituted 77% of all Ethereum transactions for a brief period. This surge in Inscriptions contributed to a concurrent increase in gas usage on the network.\n\nThe influx of addresses, attracted to the network through Inscriptions, could positively impact Ethereum by enhancing its overall activity and engagement.\n\nInscriptions made up 77% of Ethereum txs for a few hours yesterday, a first for the L1 src: https://t.co/q6ZUx8QT6v pic.twitter.com/vDoflH0ko2 \u2014 hildobby (@hildobby_) January 15, 2024\n\nHowever, amidst this positive development, Ethereum could face a challenge in the form of significant staked ETH redemptions.\n\nAccording to an X (formerly Twitter) post, the start of January saw the largest staked ETH redemption since the Shanghai Upgrade. Notably, a substantial 656,200 ETH was fully withdrawn.\n\nEven though the unstaking was a result of the behavior of bankrupt crypto lender Celsius and staking service provider Figment, this withdrawal could potentially impact Ethereum\u2019s staking ecosystem and affect market dynamics.\n\nLast week was the largest staked ETH redemption (Excl. Rewards) since the Shanghai Upgrade with 656.2k ETH (~$1.6B) being fully withdrawn 85% of the withdrawal is contributed by Figment + Celsius https://t.co/Xr8RWPWBPH pic.twitter.com/8yY4BE3RB3 \u2014 Tom Wan (@tomwanhh) January 15, 2024\n\nProgress on the development front\n\nLooking ahead, Ethereum is gearing up for the Dencun upgrade. In the next 24 hours, the Dencun upgrade will be deployed on the Goerli testnet. This upgrade introduces blobs to the testnet which is also known as \u201cprotodanksharding.\u201d\n\nThis introduction aims to reduce Layer 2 transaction fees, which can help Ethereum in terms of scalability and cost-effectiveness.\n\nGoerli is forking this Wednesday (or Tuesday night, for parts of the world!). If you haven't done so yet, update your node \ud83e\udd16! https://t.co/2MlxBtUo0X \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) January 15, 2024\n\nDespite these advancements, Ethereum\u2019s market performance saw a decline in its price, trading at $2,529.86 at the time of writing. Over the last 24 hours, ETH experienced a decrease of 0.28%.\n\nDespite the price decline, the MVRV ratio continued to grow. This signaled that a significant number of addresses were holding profitable positions.\n\nWhile this might incentivize some addresses to sell their ETH, potentially impacting the price negatively, the Long/Short difference provided a contrasting perspective.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThe growing Long/Short difference suggested a higher number of long-term holders compared to short-term holders.\n\nLong-term holders, being less likely to sell, can contribute to price stability and resilience in the face of short-term market fluctuations."

        "title": "Ethereum Developers Deploy Testnet for Dencun Upgrade - Coinspeaker",
        "content": "Currently, there are plans to deploy Dencun on the Sepolia testnet on January 31, and then on the Holesky testnet on February 7.\n\nAmong the many things that the crypto industry has to look forward to, there is the Dencun upgrade for the Ethereum network. Touted as a way for Ethereum to increase its data processing abilities and scalability, it is largely seen as a game-changer by those in the industry. Now, we are a step closer to this upgrade as Ethereum developers have deployed a testnet of Dencun on the Goerli test network. This took place on January 17, 2024, at 6:32 UTC.\n\nDencun Coming Soon\n\nWhile the Dencun testnet launch was eventually deployed, it did meet some challenges along the way. Most notably, it wasn\u2019t able to reach finality and this is credited with validators not completing software upgrades and this led to low participation rates.\n\n\u201cAnd it seems like we have a chain split! Client teams are looking into it, but it\u2019s likely to take a while to pin down + fix the issues. Keep an eye out for updates!\u201d Tim Beiko, an Ethereum core developer, said.\n\nFinality, in terms of blockchains, refers to the mechanism that makes transactions irreversible. It is one of the most important parts of any blockchain network and has to be gotten right. The developer teams have confirmed that they are looking into these issues and should resolve them in the next few days.\n\nAt the same time, this is one of the purposes of testnet deployment- to make sure that any potential kinks are worked out before the final launch date. And this isn\u2019t the last deployment we will see before Dencun fully goes live.\n\nCurrently, there are plans to deploy Dencun on the Sepolia testnet on January 31, 2024, and then on the Holesky testnet on February 7. All these will lead up to the final Dencun deployment by the end of the first quarter of the year.\n\nWhy the Dencun Upgrade Is Vital\n\nOne thing that the blockchain community knows very well at this point is that a single network upgrade can change the very trajectory of an ecosystem. Ethereum itself experienced this with its last major upgrade that saw the network moving from a proof-of-work consensus to a proof-of-stake one. This move saw the network\u2019s energy use cut by over 95% and made Ethereum much better for the environment.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is also on track to be impactful by introducing proto-danksharding. This is a mechanism that will increase Ethereum\u2019s capacity for data handling and make it cheaper to use. As such, Ethereum will become more scalable once it is implemented and naturally, there has been a lot of anticipation for this. While this testnet launch has seen its hiccups, we can hope that they are sorted and the final Dencun upgrade goes off without a hitch."

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.\n\nThe founder of the decentralised mining network and software development platform Ethereum Vitalik Buterin shared his insights about Ethereum layer 2 of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nVitalik shared pivotal points regarding L2 networks which are considered as main scalability tool for the Ethereum Network.\n\nDebate About L2 Layer\n\nThe L2 layer on the Ethereum blockchain is a collective term for an Ethereum scaling solution that manages transactions off Ethereum layer 1 while still taking benefit of the robust decentralized security of Ethereum layer 1. Layer 2 is a different blockchain that extends Ethereum.\n\nL2 solution is designed to improve transaction capacity and pace without compromising on the security which is facilitated by the main chain layer1. This proves to be beneficial for the users as it helps users to understand the types of solutions available for their respective issues.\n\nVitalik engaged in a debate which was about \u201cL2s\u201d encompassing both rollups and validiums. The users need to understand the different security features where rollups are \u201csecurity-favoring\u201d solutions that bundle or \u201croll up\u201d transactions into a single proof, which is posted to the main chain. This methodology enables high security, as the L1 blockchain instantly secures them.\n\nComparatively, rollups are a bit expensive due to their ability to its data on-chain which provides higher security on the other hand Validiums provide an inexpensive alternate option to rollups. The founder of Ethereum Vitalik has suggested that terminology should reflect these distinctions without delegitimizing either option. In the spectrum of L2 solutions, he suggests terms like \u201cstrong L2\u201d for rollups and \u201clight L2\u201d for validiums to enable users to guide their choices better.\n\nVitalik also cleared that the whole process of L2 solution is not only about security as both rollups and Validiums have \u201cintermediate space\u201d."

        "content": "After the approval of the 11 Spot Bitcoin ETFs, the Bitcoin (BTC) price shot up significantly, nearing $49,000. However, subsequently, the oldest crypto witnessed a bearish turn, now trading at around $43,000. Amid the declines, a crypto analyst sold off a substantial share of his Bitcoin holdings to acquire Ethereum (ETH).\n\nWhy did the crypto analyst sell Bitcoin for Ethereum?\n\nIn a recent video, Crypto Rover, a popular crypto analyst on YouTube and X, stated that he is considering a significant Bitcoin selloff to invest in Ethereum. Additionally, he noted that ETH has a better upside than BTC. He linked this to the upcoming Spot Ethereum ETFs that are expected to launch in four months.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe analyst added that a major Ethereum upgrade is also slated for launch in the next four months. Hence, he expects the coupled impact of both these events to propel the Ethereum price up unprecedentedly. Whilst, he noted that last week, he began selling off Bitcoin when it neared the $49,000 mark.\n\nFurthermore, Rover underscored that Bitcoin has registered over $200 million in short liquidations. He noted that Bitcoin tends to grab the liquidity before significant chart movements. Hence, he expects the BTC price to surge past $43,500 before a notable correction.\n\nMoreover, he added that the surge could be extended to $44,500 prior to the anticipated declines. In addition, the analyst stated that he will place buy orders for BTC when the price falls around $39,750, indicating a massive correction. However, he also noted that if Bitcoin breaks the resistance at $44,500 and sustains over it, a massive surge could follow.\n\nAlso Read: Arthur Hayes Expects Hong Kong To Hinder Bitcoin ETF Adoption In West\n\nBTC Price Today\n\nThe Bitcoin price slumped significantly after attaining a high of $48,969.37 last week. Moreover, it has since experienced significant declines despite attempts to rebound. It retraced the $43,500 mark but faced a rejection.\n\nAt press time, the BTC price witnessed a dip of 0.15% to $42,778.53 on Tuesday, January 16. Whilst, the crypto holds a market cap of 838.70 billion, down by 0.14%. In addition, the 24-hour trade volume dropped by 1.69% to $20.90 billion.\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock CEO Backs Ethereum ETF After Bitcoin Success"

        "content": "David Schwartz, the CTO of Ripple, recently addressed concerns surrounding the missing genesis block on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), citing a similar case with Ethereum.\n\nSchwartz made the latest disclosures while responding to questions raised by community member MetaMan regarding the XRP Ledger\u2019s seemingly unusual start at block 32,569.\n\nMetaMan voiced skepticism and emphasized the importance of transparency for XRP holders. \u201cTell me, is there any blockchain that lost its genesis block,\u201d the XRP community member asked Schwartz on X.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSimilar Case with Ethereum\n\nIn response, the Ripple CTO drew a parallel to Ethereum\u2019s genesis block ambiguity. He highlighted that Ethereum, despite having transactions predating its official start, does not publicly document them.\n\nThe choice of what to consider the genesis block is arbitrary. For example, ETH has lots of transactions before its genesis block that are not in the publicly available record. 1/2 \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 16, 2024\n\nSchwartz pointed to a specific 2,622 ETH transaction on Aug. 3, 2016, moving over $6 million. He questioned, \u201cWhere did that ETH come from? Where\u2019s the transaction that explains it?\u201d\n\nAn XRP community member referenced transactions showing 40,000 ETH transferred during Ethereum\u2019s genesis block.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSchwartz acknowledged this but stressed that the source of those 40,000 ETH was not publicly visible due to deliberate decisions in defining Ethereum\u2019s genesis block.\n\nSchwartz argued that such decisions, including XRPL\u2019s genesis block starting at ledger 32,569, were arbitrary. He contended that similar choices, like those made in Ethereum\u2019s case, aimed to obscure fund sources.\n\nWhen asked if the 40,000 ETH tokens \u201cjust showed up out of thin air,\u201d the Ripple CTO emphasized that, from the public blockchain perspective, they did. However, he stressed that Ethereum insiders possess more information on the matter.\n\nNonetheless, in the case of the XRP Ledger, being one of the original architects, Schwartz confirmed that the genesis ledger of the chain had no transactions. However, according to him, the first 32,570 ledgers contained 534 transactions, which are presumably lost now.\n\nBefore Schwartz\u2019s response to MetaMan\u2019s initial question, Mayukha Vadari, a Senior Software Developer at RippleX, explained the reason behind the loss of genesis block.\n\nShe noted that the initial set of XRPL servers experienced uniform configuration and simultaneous memory depletion, leading to ledger issues.\n\nSustained Concerns Around the XRPL Genesis Block\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the genesis block\u2019s peculiarity has been questioned. Critics, in the past, raised concerns about the distribution scheme of XRP, suggesting hidden motives behind the absence of earlier ledgers. Schwartz has consistently debunked such notions.\n\nAn XRP holder asked a similar question in the Bitcoin Stack Exchange forum in October 2013, a year after the XRP Ledger went live. He sought to know the reason behind starting the network at block 32,570.\n\nSchwartz responded to this query, noting that a bug affected Ripple servers, causing ledger headers to be lost.\n\nDespite efforts to collect data, insufficient information hindered ledger reconstruction. He reassured the user that the missing ledgers (1 \u2013 32,570) held no significance for average XRPL users.\n\nMoreover, in a post from December 2019, Schwartz provided a broader historical perspective, emphasizing the XRP Ledger\u2019s evolution since its live debut in June 2012. According to him, after the ledger went live, it featured bugs which they had to fix.\n\nSchwartz confirmed that, as a result of some of these bugs and reset exercises carried out on the network, data from the XRP Ledger\u2019s first week, stored in ledgers 1 \u2013 32,570, was lost. However, he assured that they did not recreate the initial 100 billion XRP supply upon the resets."

        "content": "Ethereum Completes Dencun Network Upgrade on Goerli Testnet\n\nEthereum has successfully implemented the Dencun network upgrade on the Goerli testnet.\n\nOn Jan. 17, Ethereum\u2019s developers have deployed the previously announced Dencun upgrade, succeeding the Shapella upgrade (also known as the Shanghai upgrade) in 2023.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade prominently features the implementation of EIP-4844, known as proto-danksharding. Proto-danksharding, as the main component, allows for the temporary storage of off-chain data, easing the storage demands on Ethereum nodes.\n\nThis development is anticipated to significantly lower transaction fees for decentralized applications (dApps), particularly benefiting Layer 2 rollup chains.\n\nDencun is Goerli Testnet\u2019s Last Upgrade\n\nAccording to the Ethereum core team, the Dencun upgrade will be the last upgrade for the Goerli testnet, Ethereum\u2019s first multi-client testnet, before the developers stop supporting it.\n\n\u201cEither three months after the Goerli Dencun activation, or one month after the Dencun mainnet activation, whichever comes later, teams will begin exiting their validators,\u201d said the team. \u201cAnyone relying on Goerli as a stable testnet should migrate elsewhere prior to this.\u201d\n\n\u201cApplication and tooling developers are encouraged to use Sepolia to test decentralized applications, smart contracts, and other EVM functionality,\u201d said the team. \u201cStakers and infrastructure providers concerned with protocol-level testing are encouraged to use the newly launched Holesky testnet.\u201d\n\nThe upgrade is named \u201cDencun\u201d as it combines the naming conventions for Ethereum\u2019s consensus and execution layer upgrades. Consensus layer upgrades are typically named after stars, while execution layer upgrades follow the names of Devcon city locations.\n\n\u201cDencun\u201d merges \u201cDeneb,\u201d a first-magnitude star in the Cygnus constellation, with \u201cCancun,\u201d the host city for Devcon 3, reflecting the collaborative nature of the upgrade across both layers of Ethereum\u2019s architecture.\n\nThe upgrade was livestreamed by the developers. If no major issues are found following the Goerli implementation, it will be deployed to Sepolia and Holesky.\n\nButerin Says Validiums are Not Genuine Rollup Solutions\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has recently sparked a debate about the classification of layer 2 scaling solutions, particularly focusing on Ethereum\u2019s validiums. Buterin asserts that validiums, which use off-chain data storage, should not be considered true rollup solutions.\n\nValidiums, while offering scalability through zero-knowledge proofs for off-chain transactions, face challenges in terms of data availability, differing from ZK-rollups which post full transaction data on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe discussion in the Ethereum community regarding the evolution and categorization of its scaling solutions has become increasingly relevant as Ethereum now moves forward with its Dencun upgrade."

However, it was not completed in the allotted amount of time.\n\nDencun appeared to have split after failing to conclude as anticipated, despite being released on Goerli on Wednesday at 6:32 UTC, according to a live stream on YouTube.\n\nThe team waits for time to properly assess the improvement. But even so, one of the engineers had foreseen difficulties before the update.\n\n\u201cIt will take time to accurately evaluate the status. Therefore, before someone claims that the Goerli hard fork failed and Deneb is delayed, we should allow time for a proper analysis,\u201d Terence, an Ethereum engineer, stated.\n\nThe price of Ethereum (ETH) is not significantly affected by the Dencun update. According to the screenshot below, ETH is currently trading at $2,545, up 0.83% over the previous day.\n\nBy the end of January, the team intends to deploy the Dencun update on the Sepolia testnet. It has set February 7 for the upgrade on the Holesky testnet in the interim. The Dencun mainnet upgrade is currently anticipated to be completed by the end of the first quarter."

        "content": "Over the past 30 days, Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, has experienced a notable surge of 17%, outperforming Bitcoin (BTC), which has recorded a surge of 2.5% over the same period.\n\nThis comes as the initial excitement surrounding the approval of the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appears to have waned, with BTC witnessing a 5% drop in the past seven days.\n\nInterestingly, according to crypto trading firm QCP Capital, following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the focus has shifted to the potential launch of an ETH spot ETF, which could be one of the factors for Ethereum outperforming BTC.\n\nEthereum Gains Ground Against BTC\n\nAccording to QCP Capital, the total volumes transacted across all 11 ETFs in the past week have reached $9.8 billion. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) alone accounted for $4.6 billion.\n\nSince converting from a Trust to an ETF, GBTC has experienced outflows of $1.17 billion. This is \u201cunsurprising\u201d for the firm, considering GBTC had been trading at a discount since 2020, offering investors an opportunity to exit at par value.\n\nBTC initially surged to a high of $49,100 upon ETF approval but has since seen a decline, consolidating above the $40,000 support level. Volumes have slowed since the initial launch, and market attention is focused on GBTC outflows.\n\nMeanwhile, ETHBTC, which traded below 0.05, has seen an upward trend to 0.06. According to QCP Capital, Ethereum is anticipated to continue to outperform Bitcoin in the medium term as the narrative shifts towards potential ETH Spot ETF approvals.\n\nBitcoin Forward Contract Yields Decrease\n\nFollowing the launch of the BTC spot ETF, BTC forward contracts have experienced a greater decline compared to ETH forward contracts. BTC 1-month forward fell from 32% annualized to 9% (-23%), while ETH 1-month forward decreased from 28% to 12% (-16%).\n\nAccording to QCP Capital, despite declining yields, ETH forwards still appear attractive, offering 11-13% annualized returns. Additionally, selling ETH 1-month 2200 Puts presents a viable option with yields above 21% annually, and it could be a suitable level to buy in the event of a dip upon potential ETH spot ETF approvals.\n\nUltimately, the crypto firm suggests that the forthcoming BTC halving in mid-April and the potential approval of ETH Spot ETFs from May are anticipated to be significant events for the crypto market.\n\nIn the interim, market movements may also be influenced by macroeconomic events. The January Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, as well as the February Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) reports, are being closely monitored for insights.\n\nThe pace of the balance sheet runoff, discussed briefly in December 2023, is expected to provide further clarity during the January FOMC meeting. The market consensus suggests a slowdown in quantitative tightening (QT), but the timing and extent of these changes remain uncertain.\n\nOverall, the potential launch of an Ethereum spot ETF has sparked speculation and could have a transformative impact on the Ethereum ecosystem. As the market grapples with changing dynamics, attention remains on key events, such as the BTC halving and potential ETH Spot ETF approvals.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "One of the most controversial expectations in the cryptocurrency market is known as \u201cthe flippening.\u201d The flippening is the forecast of Ethereum (ETH) surpassing Bitcoin (BTC) in market capitalization, which is both praised and criticized.\n\nInterestingly, QCP Capital foresees Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin in price appreciation in 2024, according to a January 17 market update. The trading firm specializing in digital assets and cryptocurrencies shared the report on a Telegram group with 11,000 subscribers.\n\nDespite not mentioning a \u2018flippening,\u2019 QCP Capital mentioned the positive results of a previous report on ETH paired against BTC. Moreover, the trading firm forecasts Ethereum to continue outperforming the leading cryptocurrency due to ETH spot ETF expectations.\n\n\u201cWhen ETHBTC traded below 0.05, we mentioned that the cross looked attractive from both a technical perspective and with ETH as a catchup play. ETHBTC has since traded higher to 0.06. We expect ETH to continue outperforming BTC over the medium term as the narrative rotates to potential ETH Spot ETF approvals.\u201d \u2014 QCP Capital Broadcast\n\nQCP Market update \u2013 17 Jan 24. Source: CQP Capital Broadcast\n\nCould an Ethereum spot ETF approval cause the flippening?\n\nThe narrative started boiling after an interview with Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock Inc. (NYSE: BLK), on CNBC. In particular, Fink explained that BlackRock sees value in tokenization and believes the SEC will approve an Ethereum spot ETF.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin has surged by nearly 150% since January 2, 2023, until its current price of $42,418. Rumors and expectations on a Bitcoin spot ETF approval gained traction during this period while the market was pricing it.\n\nBTC/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nA similar price action on Ethereum would put the leading Web3, and dominating DeFi blockchain, at above $6,235. This would drive ETH capitalization to around $750 billion, still nearly $100 billion lower than Bitcoin\u2019s current market cap. Therefore, would not be enough for a \u2018flippening,\u2019 even if BTC kept its $830 billion value by press time.\n\nETH/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nNevertheless, QCP Capital is still optimistic about a medium-term outperformance for the second-largest cryptocurrency over the largest one. According to the trading firm analysis, ETH could offer a better risk-reward for 2024\u2019s investors.\n\nStill, investing in this market is unpredictable, and having caution is crucial while deploying capital for price speculation.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIn the last year, thousands of developers have abandoned crypto\u2014but in several other key metrics, the ecosystem looks as robust as ever.\n\nThat\u2019s according to a new report out Wednesday from crypto venture firm Electric Capital, which says that the number of active, open-source crypto developers has dropped a sharp 24% from the end of 2022 through 2023. As of last month, just over 22,000 developers currently operate in the industry, across myriad blockchains.\n\nThe dropoff was all but certainly thanks to the crypto winter that set in after the $60 billion collapse of cryptocurrencies UST and LUNA in May 2022, and the subsequent collapse of FTX in November of that year, which cratered crypto\u2019s reputation and industry growth.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut there\u2019s a silver lining in that trend: The overwhelming majority of developers who left the industry in 2023 appear to have been fairweather builders, who had hardly spent any prior time in crypto.\n\nOver 52% of new crypto developers\u2014with one year or less of experience\u2014left the space by December 2023. In contrast, developers with one to two years of experience only dipped by a marginal 1%, and developers with over two years of experience actually grew as a category by the year\u2019s end, up a resounding 33%.\n\nThe geographic diversity of those developers has also grown over time. In 2018, United States-based builders represented 40% of all crypto developers worldwide, according to Electric Capital. By 2023, that figure shrunk to 26%. Meanwhile, the share of crypto developers from non-Western countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America has comparably ballooned in the same period, from 18% to 36%.\n\nEurope continues to produce the most crypto developers in the world\u201434% last year.\n\nWhat sorts of blockchains these developers work on has also developed promisingly over the years. As of 2023, 34% of all builders work on multiple chains, a marked increase that speaks to the scope and depth of development across the increasingly multi-chain crypto ecosystem.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum, unsurprisingly, continues to attract the majority of crypto developers; over 8,000 coders consistently contributed to the blockchain last year. But Ethereum scaling network Polygon and rival Solana have also seen a marked uptick in numbers of new contributors.\n\nSlightly below those three networks in new developer activity, but impressive in their own right, are BNB Chain, Cosmos, Arbitrum, Polkadot, NEAR, Avalanche, Optimism, and Internet Computer\u2014each of which attracted between 2,000 and 4,000 new developers in 2023.\n\nThe fastest growing new crypto ecosystem of 2023 was Base: Coinbase\u2019s Ethereum layer-2 network, which took the industry by storm after its launch in August. 999 unique developers contributed to Base over the last three months of 2023.\n\nBitcoin, meanwhile, despite its status as the original blockchain, is no longer the coolest kid at the party. Where once the network could brag, way back in 2015, that it attracted more new developers than any other blockchain\u201417%\u2014by last year that figure shrunk to a measly 2%.\n\nThe Bitcoin ecosystem is now maintained by a core group of just over 1,000 developers. But some of those builders may be busier than others.\n\nAccording to Electric Capital\u2019s report, less than 10% of Bitcoin developers work on Ordinals, digital assets inscribed in tiny denominations of BTC that are akin to NFTs. Despite that relatively low figure, Ordinals, which were a runaway phenomenon in 2023, have routinely accounted for over 50% of transaction traffic on the Bitcoin network.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

Proto-danksharking will allow the network to scale and more cheaply handle over 100,000 transactions per second, according to developers, via Ethereum Layer 2 solutions.\n\nEthereum layer-2 solutions, like Optimism, are where most of Ethereum\u2019s activity takes place, a report by market intelligence firm Messari said in October.\n\nProto-danksharking is the most talked about feature of the upgrade because Ethereum has long struggled with scalability; compared to other blockchains, it is slow and costly to do things on Ethereum, such as minting NFTs or sending ETH.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDevelopers working on the new feature hope to solve this. \u201cDanksharding is how Ethereum becomes a truly scalable blockchain, but there are several protocol upgrades required to get there. Proto-Danksharding is an intermediate step along the way,\u201d developers explain on the Ethereum website.\n\n\u201cBoth aim to make transactions on Layer 2 as cheap as possible for users and should scale Ethereum to >100,000 transactions per second.\u201d\n\nThe Dencun upgrade will be an Ethereum hard fork\u2014when validators on the network have to upgrade to the newest software in order to keep participating. There have been various similar upgrades to the network in the past, most recently 2022\u2019s \u201cmerge\u201d, when the network moved from proof of work to proof of stake."

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nEthereum\u2019s layer-two (L2) blockchain Manta Pacific registered more than $850 million in total value locked (TVL) today, and it is now the 4th largest L2 by TVL, according to data aggregator L2Beat. When compared to the $35 million in TVL on December 15, 2023, this represents more than 2,300% in monthly growth.\n\nThe relevant rise in TVL can be related to Manta\u2019s New Paradigm campaign, which started last year on December 14 and gave rewards to users who bridged Ethereum (ETH) to Manta Pacific. The rewards are \u2018box pieces\u2019 and when a user gets 25 of them, he\u2019s eligible to open a box and get a non-fungible token (NFT). Inviting friends with referral links also boosted the rewards.\n\nManta Pacific is a blockchain ecosystem built by Manta Network on Ethereum. It leverages Polygon\u2019s zkEVM technology and uses Celestia, a modular blockchain, as its data availability layer. This architecture enables Manta Pacific to function as a zero-knowledge rollup (zk rollup) for Ethereum, offering scalability and privacy benefits.\n\nSince the start of the campaign, Manta\u2019s TVL has soared and reached an $870 million peak on January 12. However, this number could sharply decline after January 18, when users will be eligible to claim their rewards after participating in the New Paradigm campaign.\n\nA blog post published by Manta\u2019s team on January 15 reveals that 50 million MANTA tokens will be distributed to New Paradigm\u2019s participants. Another 50 million MANTA will be airdropped to users who interacted with the \u2018Into the Blue\u2019 event, which was similar to New Paradigm\u2019s proposal.\n\nThe value locked growth was not accompanied by a rise in activity and could be seen as a sign that the money flowing into Manta Pacific is coming from investors only interested in the airdrop.\n\nThus, the token distribution could be seen by investors as the end of the period when it\u2019s mandatory to lock ETH in Manta Pacific. Since 2024 is seen as \u2018airdrop season\u2019 by analysts, as Crypto Briefing reported, the money could quickly flow to other protocols where staking crypto is an eligibility requirement."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade has gone live on the Goerli testnet.\n\nDespite preparations, the testnet launch has not gone as many hoped.\n\nThe timeline for when issues would be resolved remains unclear.\n\nThe long-anticipated Ethereum Dencun upgrade is now coming into full view. In line with timelines released in December 2023, developers have launched the upgrade on the Goerli testnet, the soon-to-be-phased-out Ethereum sandbox for staking infrastructure and other protocol-level changes.\n\nDespite months of preparation, however, the upgrade\u2019s first testnet outing faced several roadblocks amid underwhelming participation.\n\nEthereum Dencun Upgrade Off To a Rough Start\n\nThe Dencun upgrade was released on the Goerli testnet around 6:32 UTC on January 17, as promised by developers in December 2023. The upgrade, however, did not get off to the start many would have hoped.\n\nEthereum Foundation protocol support member Tim Beiko reported that the upgrade failed to achieve finality, likely culminating in a chain split. Finality is assurance that crypto transactions cannot be reversed once executed.\n\nDevelopers linked the challenges faced in the upgrade\u2019s first outing to low network participation as more validators failed to upgrade their clients. Ethereum developer Terence Tsao pointed out the lack of sufficient participation ahead of the Goerli fork, predicting that finality could be lost as participation was estimated to be around 80%. For context, finality will likely be lost with 10% of validators offline.\n\nBack to the Drawing Board?\n\nEthereum Foundation\u2019s Beiko has noted that developers are investigating the hurdles faced during the Goerli fork. However, it remains to be seen when these issues will be resolved.\n\n\u201cClient teams are looking into it, but it's likely to a while to pin down + fix the issues. Keep an eye out for updates!,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDevelopers still have to test out the Dencun upgrade on two more testnets, Sepolia and Holesky, before they can launch it on the mainnet. While the initial timeline had indicated that a Q1 launch of the upgrade was likely, it remains to be seen how recent snafus will affect these projections.\n\nThe most anticipated feature of the upgrade is EIP-4844, also known as proto-danksharding, which promises to make fees cheaper on Ethereum Layer 2 chains by reducing the cost of storing data on the network with blobs.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nDevelopers had allocated a minimum of a week to test Dencun on each testnet.\n\nThe upgrade had gone smoothly during the shadow forks of Goerli.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade will be the last upgrade Goerli will see before it is phased out in favor of Holesky.\n\nThe full danksharding vision tipped to address Ethereum\u2019s scalability concerns is still years away.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nRecent hiccups during the Goerli fork may adversely affect Dencun mainnet launch projections.\n\nRead this for more on the Dencun upgrade:\n\nETH Devs Set Tentative Dencun Launch Dates for Key Testnets\n\n\n\nLearn more about Ethereum\u2019s growing dominance against Bitcoin:\n\nStrong Ethereum Fundamentals Fuel 20%+ Surge Against Bitcoin"

We\u2019ll explore what Ethereum is and its potential as an investment in 2024. The guide will then walk you through the practical steps of buying Ethereum, making it a valuable resource for both new and experienced investors in the cryptocurrency realm.\n\nWhat is Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nEthereum, commonly referred to as ETH, is a decentralized, open-source blockchain system. It is known for its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), and its ability to support smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nVitalik Buterin has stepped into the ongoing conversation about rollups, offering a fresh perspective on how they interact with external data chains. This update comes at a time when the Ethereum community is deeply engaged in discussions about the architecture and security of layer-2 solutions.\n\nRollups in new light\n\nAt the heart of Buterin's intervention is the distinction between traditional Ethereum rollups and the \"Validium\" solution.\n\nIn a nuanced take, Buterin explained that when an Ethereum rollup uses an external data chain for data availability (DA), it transitions into a validium. This represents a shift from the earlier understanding, where Ethereum's layer-2 solutions were almost exclusively equated with rollups. Central to Buterin's explanation is the concept of an \"unconditional security guarantee,\" a hallmark of rollups that ensures users' assets are retrievable under any circumstances.\n\nHowever, this level of security may not be as robust when an external DA system is in play. Nonetheless, Buterin sees a place for validiums, suggesting that with robust distributed DA systems, they can offer a significant boost to an application's practical security.\n\nDiverse views from Ethereum community\n\nThe Ethereum community has engaged in a lively debate over the nuances of this new direction. Discussions have revolved around the implications of using various external chains, such as Celestia, as DA layers, and how these choices impact the classification of a project as a layer-2 solution.\n\nSome community members pointed out that the integration of external chains adds complexity to the layer-2 landscape and could potentially overlook the unique attributes of each solution.\n\nThere is also a concern that the security of modular blockchain systems could be compromised if any component, like the DA or execution layer, is weak.\n\nDespite these concerns, others in the community believe that categorizing these solutions as \"layer 2\" remains effective for communication purposes, especially when they use Ethereum's layer 1 for security and settlement."

        "content": "P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi, an Ethereum (ETH) developer, has lauded EIP-1559 and its ETH burning mechanism as \u201cthe great equalizer.\u201d Taking to X on January 16, Szil\u00e1gyi admired EIP-1559\u2019s ability to \u201clevel the playing field between validators and regular users.\u201d\n\nDeveloper: EIP-1559 Is A \u201cGreat Equalizer\u201d\n\nSince the implementation of EIP-1559, Ethereum adjusted how users bid gas fees, introducing the \u201cbase fee,\u201d which was burned or sent to an irretrievable wallet. So far, data from Ultrasound Money shows that over 3.9 million ETH have been destroyed.\n\nIn the last week alone, the Ethereum network automatically sent more than 21,100 ETH out of circulation, \u201cburning\u201d ETH\u2019s supply.\n\nSpecifically, Szil\u00e1gyi mentioned the advantage regular users have with EIP-1559. Through this implementation, validators (previously miners before Ethereum shifted to a proof-of-stake blockchain) no longer have the privilege of arbitrarily adjusting gas limits and transaction fees.\n\nEarlier, that leeway created what the developer described as an \u201cimbalance,\u201d which made it tough for \u201cregular users to compete.\u201d However, following this implementation, everyone must adhere regardless of status as a validator, founder, or user.\n\nWith EIP-1559, the \u201cbase fee\u201d adjustment is set at the protocol level. It is this base fee that the network burns, gradually making ETH deflationary, reading from the number of coins taken out of circulation since EIP-1559 went live in early August 2021. Even so, a sender can \u201ctip\u201d the validator, incentivizing them to prioritize validating a transaction.\n\nStability And Predictability Achieved, Ethereum Upsides Capped At $3,000\n\nSzil\u00e1gyi\u2019s comments reflect a growing consensus among Ethereum supporters regarding the positive impact of EIP-1559. Though a big percentage of EIP-1559 is fixated on the price impact of the proposal, there is more that it achieves.\n\nMost importantly, from a user experience perspective, it is now easier for senders to predict how much they will pay for a transaction. This is crucial, especially when the network is congested. Additionally, though the Ethereum gas fee remains relatively high, EIP-1559, though considered a \u201cbad idea\u201d by Szil\u00e1gyi, has stabilized the network.\n\nETH burning is attributed to reducing inflation in Ethereum, a network whose total supply is not capped like Bitcoin. Over the long term, prices might benefit from this proposal. However, prices are bullish in the short to medium term. Still, upsides are limited to around the $3,000 psychological round number.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "In a recent revelation, David Schwartz, the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Ripple and one of the key architects behind XRP Ledger, disclosed an intriguing insight into the genesis block secrets of Ethereum (ETH). The discussion unfolded when a curious crypto enthusiast probed Schwartz about the peculiar genesis block numbering in XRPL.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe question pointed to a historical mishap that resulted in the loss of ledgers 1 through 32,569 in XRPL, creating an unconventional void in recorded data. Schwartz responded by asserting that the choice of considering a particular block as the genesis block is arbitrary, drawing parallels to Ethereum's own genesis block.\n\nTo illustrate his point, Schwartz shared a link to an August 2016 transaction moving a substantial 2,622.1 ETH, currently valued at $6.68 million. He questioned the origins of the ETH and emphasized that Ethereum's genesis block, much like XRPL's, had undisclosed transactions that determined the allocation of funds.\n\nSomeone decided to define the genesis of the ETH chain to be before that transaction but after the transaction that explained why 40,000 ETH went to that address. So you cannot publicly see the source of that ETH unless you know where to look for it. \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 16, 2024\n\nAs the discussion unfolded, Schwartz delved into the intricacies of Ethereum's genesis block, revealing that certain transactions were deliberately excluded from the public blockchain. He suggested that decisions were made to obscure the source of funds, showcasing the arbitrary nature of defining a blockchain's genesis.\n\nWhat's with XRP?\n\nThe conversation further explored the absence of transactions in XRPL's genesis block, leaving 534 transactions in the first 32,570 ledgers presumed lost. Notably, the breakdown of XRP distribution at ledger 32,570 revealed specific ownership percentages, with individuals like Jed McCaleb, Chris Larssen, Arthur Britto and entities like OpenCoin holding precise and publicly known shares.\n\nEffectively, XRPL has a genesis block with balances in it just as ETH does, but a big difference is that the ownership of all but about .01% of those balances for XRPL is precisely and publicly known:\n\nJed: 9 %\n\nChris: 9 %\n\nArthur: 2 %\n\nOpenCoin: 79.99 %\n\nBeta testers and developers:\u2026 \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 16, 2024\n\nThis revelation not only sheds light on the mysterious genesis blocks of both XRPL and Ethereum but also raises questions about the transparency and decision-making processes within blockchain ecosystems."

This shift in rankings highlights the growing prominence of Manta Pacific in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space. Layer 2 solutions, such as Manta Pacific, are secondary blockchains built atop primary or native blockchains to mitigate congestion issues, enhance speed, and facilitate smoother transactions.\n\nTotal Value Locked (TVL) serves as a crucial metric in gauging the popularity of DeFi protocols. It represents the notional value of tokens deposited within a protocol, reflecting user engagement and the overall health of the platform.\n\nNotably, L2Beat\u2019s TVL methodology considers the dollar value of tokens canonically bridged, externally bridged, and natively minted. In contrast, DeFiLlama, another reputable source, focuses solely on assets actively engaged in decentralized applications. According to DeFiLlama, Manta and Base are in a tight contest for the ninth spot, both boasting a TVL of approximately $420 million.\n\nLast year, Manta Pacific transitioned to a zero-knowledge rollup, leveraging zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic technique that gained prominence in 2023 for its ability to ensure rapid transaction settlement, also known as \u201cfinality.\u201d This technological advancement has contributed to Manta Pacific\u2019s success and its ascent in the scaling solution hierarchy.\n\nAdditionally, Manta Pacific\u2019s paradigm bridging program, launched in December, played a pivotal role in the platform\u2019s accelerated growth. Bridging involves transferring assets from one blockchain to another, and Manta Pacific incentivizes users by offering rewards for bridging Ethereum (ETH) and USD Coin (USDC) to its network. The layer 2 solution adopts a strategy reminiscent of Ethereum layer 2 Blast, as noted by Michael Nadeau, founder of the DeFi report.\n\nUsers bridging ETH and USDC to Manta Pacific enjoy a staking yield ranging from 4% to 5%, with their coins locked for a duration of 69 days. Depositors are also eligible for future airdrops of MANTA tokens. The program further offers NFT box pieces to depositors, and staked ETH can be re-staked on the Eigen Layer protocol.\n\nBinance Embraces Manta\n\nIn a move that solidifies Manta Pacific\u2019s dominance in the industry, Binance recently introduced MANTA as its 44th project on the Launchpool.\n\nThis integration allows Binance users to earn MANTA tokens by staking their BNB and FDUSD tokens. The addition of Manta to the Binance ecosystem introduces a modular Layer 2 solution tailored for Zero-Knowledge (ZK) applications. The Launchpool initiative, which began on Monday spans two days and enables users to farm MANTA tokens.\n\nAs Manta Pacific continues to gain traction and secure its position in the scaling solution landscape, the crypto community eagerly awaits further developments and innovations from this project in the DeFi space."

        "title": "Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Says Validiums are Not Genuine Rollup Solutions - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Says Validiums are Not Genuine Rollup Solutions\n\nVitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum (ETH), has ignited a debate about the classification of various layer 2 scaling solutions.\n\nThe crypto veteran has claimed that Ethereum\u2019s validiums should not be considered genuine rollup solutions.\n\nThe statement came in response to a post by Daniel Wang, the founder of Taiko, an Ethereum rollup solution, who said if an Ethereum rollup relies on an external data chain, such as Celestia\u2019s modular blockchain, then it should be classified as a validium.\n\nButerin concurred with Wang\u2019s comment, stating:\n\n\u201cThis is correct. The core of being a rollup is the unconditional security guarantee: you can get your assets out even if everyone else colludes against you.\u201d\n\nHe emphasized that if data availability depends on an external system, that security guarantee cannot be upheld.\n\nThis is correct. The core of being a rollup is the unconditional security guarantee: you can get your assets out even if everyone else colludes against you. Can't get that if DA is dependent on an external system. But being a validium is a correct choice for many apps, and\u2026 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 16, 2024\n\nWhat is Validium?\n\nValidium is a scaling solution for Ethereum that utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to enable off-chain transactions, while still relying on the Ethereum mainnet for security and verification.\n\nUnlike ZK-rollups, which batch transactions on a layer 2 network and verify them on a layer 1 like Ethereum, validium networks do not post transaction data to layer 1.\n\nInstead, they post cryptographic proofs of transaction validity, aiming to achieve higher scalability by avoiding the need to store full transaction data on-chain.\n\nHowever, compared to rollups, validiums face challenges in terms of data availability, as they rely on operators to honestly post proofs.\n\nNetworks like Celestia employ modular blockchains consisting of data availability layers and validation layers, with validiums facilitating fast and private transactions.\n\nButerin took to the decentralized social media platform Warpcast to share a diagram proposing adjustments to terminologies related to these scaling solutions.\n\nHe suggested replacing terms like \u201csecurity-favoring\u201d and \u201cscale-favoring\u201d with \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201clight\u201d to achieve greater brevity.\n\nSome Argue Validiums Should Be Considered L2 Networks\n\nWhile Buterin\u2019s proposals garnered support, not everyone agreed.\n\nRyan Berckmans, a member of the Ethereum community, argued that validiums should be considered layer 2 networks.\n\n\u201cA layer-2 is a chain that settles on Ethereum. I\u2019ll die on this hill, and I\u2019ll debate anyone who insists the [data availability] has to be on Ethereum for it to be an L2,\u201d he said.\n\nBerckmans believed that the definition of layer 2 should encompass both rollups and validiums.\n\nHowever, a layer 2 industry analytics platform called L2Beat contradicted Berckmans\u2019 perspective, asserting that validiums are not layer 2 solutions.\n\nAccording to L2Beat, validiums and optimiums introduce additional trust assumptions by not publishing data on layer 1.\n\nAs reported, Ethereum-based layer 2 network Arbitrum now has a market share of 49.17% among layer 2 networks, far surpassing number two on the list, Optimism Mainnet, with its 28.85% market share.\n\nThe network has also seen a consistent increase in its TVL at least since October last year, rising about 50% from $1.66 billion in October to the current value of $2.51 billion, data from DeFi tracking site DefiLlama showed.\n\nThe upcoming Ethereum Dencun upgrade, incorporating changes proposed by EIP-4844, is expected to reduce rollup transaction costs, benefiting layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum by lowering gas fees and improving network capacity."

        "title": "Ethereum Dencun Upgrade Unleashes 'Proto-Danksharding' On Goerli Testnet - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum core developers have rolled out the much-anticipated Dencun upgrade on the Goerli test network, marking a pivotal step towards its imminent integration into the mainnet. Meanwhile, the upgrade\u2019s deployment, not without its challenges, brought forth the introduction of EIP-4844, a revolutionary transaction mechanism referred to as \u201cproto-danksharding.\u201d\n\nNotably, this mechanism promises to redefine the landscape of Ethereum transactions, particularly benefiting Layer 2 rollup chains. Let\u2019s delve into the details of this transformative upgrade and its potential implications for the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Dencun Upgrade Unveils Proto-Danksharding On Goerli Testnet\n\nThe heart of the Dencun deployment on Goerli Testnet lies in the implementation of EIP-4844, introducing a novel transaction mechanism called ephemeral blobs, or as it\u2019s colloquially known, \u201cprotodanksharding\u201d. Notably, this ingenious approach allows Ethereum nodes to temporarily store and access off-chain data, effectively mitigating the strain on storage resources, according to their live stream video.\n\nIn other words, the primary aim is to significantly reduce transaction costs for decentralized applications (dApps), with a particular focus on enhancing the efficiency of Layer 2 rollup chains. Notably, Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko offers insights on the X platform, updating on the Goerli testnet fork.\n\nDespite expected low participation, the Ethereum Foundation developer Paritosh is actively monitoring the live developments, noting dozens of blobs on the network, even though most are currently empty, Beiko noted. Notably, the continuous monitoring provides valuable real-time information about the testnet fork\u2019s progress.\n\nMeanwhile, this transparency into the live monitoring process highlights the anticipated challenges, emphasizing the importance of a phased approach to the upgrade. In addition, Beiko acknowledged a potential chain split, stating:\n\n\u201cAnd it seems like we have a chain split! Client teams are looking into it, but it\u2019s likely to take a while to pin down + fix the issues. Keep an eye out for updates!\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest Sells ProShares Strategy ETF (BITO) To Buy ARKB Spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nTesting Waters Before Mainnet Release\n\nRecognizing the complexity of the Dencun upgrade, the development team has wisely chosen a phased approach to ensure a smooth transition. Notably, Goerli serves as the initial testing ground, with subsequent implementations planned on the Sepolia testnet on Jan. 31 and the Holesky testnet on Feb. 7.\n\nMeanwhile, this meticulous testing process aims to identify and resolve any issues before the final mainnet release, expected by the end of Q1 2024. Considering that, it could be said that Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade, marked by the introduction of proto-danksharding on the Goerli testnet, signifies a crucial leap towards a more efficient and cost-effective transaction ecosystem.\n\nWhile challenges persist, the phased deployment strategy demonstrates a commitment to ironing out any wrinkles before the upgrade\u2019s widespread integration. Ethereum enthusiasts and developers alike eagerly await further updates as the platform evolves into a new era of decentralized possibilities.\n\nAlso Read: Binance Launches DOGEUSDC Perpetual Contract With 75x Leverage"

        "title": "The ETF showdown: Bitcoin's store of value vs Ethereum's technological utility - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Over the last few months, the crypto internet has been dominated by the Bitcoin ETF talk. And for a good reason. At a $835.7 billion market cap, the pioneering crypto makes up 49% of the total crypto market, consisting of tens of thousands of tokens.\n\nIn Bitcoin\u2019s 15-year life cycle, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) represents a pivotal divergence, a milestone in legitimacy. Once derided as \u201cfraud\u201d akin to tulip mania, \u201crat poison,\u201d or \u201cindex of money laundering\u201d, Bitcoin\u2019s entry into the ETF arena discards those perception rags and replaces it with a brand new coat.\n\nLong-Term Trickling from a Deep Pool\n\nHaving the blessing of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) means that institutions can start apportioning their capital into a high-yielding asset. Bitcoin fits the bill because, even more so than gold, its supply is affixed, and even though Bitcoin is digital, it is grounded in physicality via the proof-of-work mining network.\n\nAs of October 2023, US ETFs have $5.6 trillion worth of equities. Even in low single-digit percentages, capital trickling into Bitcoin is poised to create a rising tide, a feedback loop owing to Bitcoin\u2019s limited supply. Without the hassle of custodianship, investors get exposure to this tide, represented as ETF shares that track Bitcoin\u2019s spot price.\n\nJust one such Bitcoin ETF applicant is BlackRock. The world\u2019s largest asset manager had already lined up capital to the tune of $2 billion, according to sources.\n\nFollowing the approvals on January 11th, an expected sell-pressure transpired in a classic \u201csell the news event,\u201d bringing the BTC price down -7.4% over the week. Yet, launching a new investment vehicle has been successful, tracking over $1.4 billion in AuM and $3.6 billion in volume in just two days.\n\nBut what of Bitcoin\u2019s long-following shadow, Ethereum? Having transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, the Ethereum project is perceived quite differently from Bitcoin. What are these differences and how would they reflect on their respective ETF investment vehicles?\n\nThe Store of Value: Bitcoin in the Spot ETF Market\n\nFor many years, it was not clear what Bitcoin would become. After all, Bitcoin underwent over 100 hard forks, splintering the original whitepaper vision of a \u201cpurely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash\u201d.\n\nFollowing the resolution of Bitcoin\u2019s contentious block size wars in 2017, the Small Blockers faction won. Instead of increasing block size outright, they opted for soft Bitcoin scaling via the SegWit upgrade. This veered Bitcoin\u2019s fate into a store-of-value asset instead of a low-friction P2P digital cash.\n\nHard limitations make it impossible to have it both ways. If the large block size faction had won, more computing power and bandwidth would have been required to run full mining nodes, leading to network centralization and potential transaction censorship.\n\nOn the other hand, smaller blocks retain decentralization but make it difficult to scale on-chain. As fewer transactions fit inside a block, higher network activity leads to higher transfer fees because waiting lines are formed. And if BTC transfer fees go up, Bitcoin\u2019s daily currency proposition is diminished.\n\nAt least, without using layer 2 scaling solutions like the Lightning Network, harnessed by payment apps like Strike. Such payment systems can utilize Bitcoin as a vehicle to transfer cash and interface with the existing banking system.\n\nI use send globally via strike app to bank all the time. It is near instant cash deposit settlement. Our family in the Philippines are in awe of the power of#Bitcoin \u2014 General Plebian (@GenPlebian) December 23, 2023\n\nIn the end, Bitcoin cemented its position as true sovereign money, peer-to-peer but not inherently low friction. Rather, Bitcoin is the foundation for a financial edifice to be built upon. In the age of continuous fiat currency debasement via central banking, decentralized sovereignty overrides low friction, painting Bitcoin as a monetary escape hatch.\n\nFor people accustomed to fiat money erosion, this is a novel concept. Yet, Bitcoin ETF applicants are now incentivized to bring that concept in the public spotlight.\n\nThis competitive marketing push alone is poised to deepen the capital pool for Bitcoin exposure. And the deeper it gets, the higher the Bitcoin price will likely go, creating a feedback loop of more capital inflows.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Technological Utility: Beyond Mere Investment\n\nWhile Bitcoin pioneered the concept of blockchain-based sovereign money, Ethereum is a work-in-progress infrastructure layer. One that onboards digital assets and supplants traditional financial services.\n\nThis purpose drove Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake transition, as such blockchain networks rely on economic stakes instead of energy-hungry computing power. However, having a negligent energy footprint (compared to Bitcoin) is only the scaling starting point.\n\nDaily operational financial infrastructure necessitates low friction (minimal fees) to be accessible and to truly take on TradFi. Ethereum is yet to achieve low friction, relying instead on many layer 2 scaling solutions.\n\nThis became even clearer in the latest roadmap, emphasizing Ethereum interoperability and security against cyber attacks, instead of L1 scaling for low transaction fees.\n\nBy popular demand, an updated roadmap diagram for 2023! pic.twitter.com/oxo58A2KuG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 30, 2023\n\nThis approach poses two major problems:\n\nBy ditching proof-of-work, the Ethereum blockchain becomes reliant on large stakeholders and cloud computing services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). This reduces Ethereum\u2019s perception as a decentralized network that could be a true TradFi substitute. In turn, Ethereum positioned itself among other PoS network alternatives, with similar centralization issues But those have been built from the ground up for L1 scaling, without the extra L2 scaling complexity for the end user to interface with.\n\nIn this cycle, this dynamic became more evident. Even though ETH is the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, it lagged behind Bitcoin at +64% year-over-year performance. Ethereum lagged greatly behind its direct competitors Avalanche (AVAX) at +118% YoY, and Solana (SOL) at +321% YoY performance.\n\nEthereum\u2019s lackluster performance transpired despite having an even lower inflation rate than Bitcoin. This could indicate that Ethereum\u2019s perception is much more precarious than Bitcoin\u2019s, which has a more coherent and focused \u201csound money\u201d proposition.\n\nThat proposition is not duplicatable due to Bitcoin\u2019s mining network effect. For instance, if Bitcoin code were to be tweaked to become a PoS chain, per the preference of Greenpeace, it would simply be a dead code without the network onboarders.\n\nEthereum\u2019s network effect stems from holding dApp domination among PoS chains. Yet, it is not clear if that domination will not shift to AVAX, SOL or another PoS network. Additionally, while it is clear that Bitcoin is viewed as a commodity by regulatory bodies, Ethereum is still in the fog of regulatory obfuscation.\n\nMarket and Regulatory Dynamics\n\nAs of date, SEC Chair Gary Gensler hasn\u2019t explicitly announced whether ETH is a security or a commodity. By the latest speculation, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart thinks that the SEC is leaning in the commodity designation by already approving Ethereum future ETFs in August.\n\nJames Seyffart at CryptoQuant webinar on January 4th:\n\n\u201cSo again, Gary Gensler will not explicitly say whether Ethereum is a security or a commodity, but in their action, by approving those Ethereum futures ETFs, they\u2019re implicitly accepting those Ethereum futures as commodities futures.\u201d\n\nOther PoS chains like SOL, ADA and AVAX are in the same regulatory uncertainty boat. In last year\u2019s lawsuit against Coinbase, the SEC named them all as \u201ccrypto asset securities.\u201d If Seyffart is correct, and ETH becomes a commodity per the preference of CFTC, this could give Ethereum an edge over its competitors.\n\nPresently, spot-traded Ethereum ETFs are delayed until May 2024, from Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF to Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF. Likewise, the SEC pushed back Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest, 21Shares and VanEck\u2019s Ethereum ETF.\n\nGiven the limited market liquidity, compared to the Fed money supply extravaganza in 2021, Bitcoin is poised to be the greater beneficiary of the first move advantage than Ethereum.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere is a reason why the SEC failed to approve a single spot-traded Bitcoin ETF since the first application by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss in 2013. Not only was Bitcoin less mature, but the banking sector wouldn\u2019t give a leg up to its P2P competition.\n\nSince those days, Bitcoin has overcome its underground, tulip, money laundering detractors. The digital asset is now secured by the world\u2019s most powerful computing network, erecting an ecosystem of mining companies. This further bolstered investor confidence due to Bitcoin\u2019s conservative coding practices.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum is perceived as a more patchworked crypto project yet to entrench itself as a DeFi vanguard to tackle TradFi. Burdened with technical and regulatory uncertainty, conservative Bitcoin is a far likelier candidate to receive sustained retail and institutional attention from the first ETF vehicle."

        "title": "What Are The Best Ethereum Alternatives For Online Gaming? - BSC NEWS",
        "content": "Despite Ethereum's prominence in the crypto sector, this article highlights five alternatives for online gaming.\n\nEthereum is the second-largest asset in the crypto sector and the most popular after Bitcoin. The asset\u2019s popularity stems from several factors, including the network\u2019s flexibility, allowing developers to easily create and launch blockchain projects. Ethereum is also an excellent crypto investment option for people looking to profit off the sector\u2019s speculative nature, as it has gained nearly 89% since January of this year. In addition, Ethereum is the underlying network that powers most of today\u2019s decentralized finance (DeFi) industry.\n\nDespite Ethereum\u2019s success in gaming, the crypto sector is not a monopoly. There are several Ethereum alternatives that are also suitable for online gaming as they are cost-effective and offer the scalability required to handle a teeming gaming community. In addition to a few options listed on Business2Community, the following are 5 of the best Ethereum alternatives for online gaming:\n\nBinance Smart Chain (BNB)\n\nDeveloped by the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, Binance, BNB is a blockchain designed to process transactions at high speed and peak efficiency. The network has a high throughput, which is handy for online gaming apps that require rapid interactions and continuous processing over extended periods. BNB is also a great alternative for Ethereum because of its low transaction fees, making it a good platform for the high volume of microtransactions required during gameplay.\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nCardano is the eighth-largest asset by market cap. Although it started developing its smart contract in 2015, the same year Ethereum launched, the Cardano blockchain did not go live until 2017. Cardano has innovative smart contract abilities that can easily cater to gaming complexities, allowing developers to create diverse and interactive experiences for players. It is also a network committed to scalability and safety, offering the capacity to handle heavy gaming traffic without compromising security. Furthermore, the Cardano blockchain emphasizes security, which could be channeled into better protecting in-game assets and reducing the chance of theft or fraud.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nSolana is a high-performance blockchain built as an Ethereum alternative for high scalability. It has better speed than Ethereum as it can process up to 50,000 transactions per second (TPS), a speed well out of Ethereum\u2019s range. The blockchain uses the Proof of History (PoH) mechanism, a unique consensus mechanism that helps to achieve a high throughput through the cryptographic Verifiable Delay Function (VDF), which creates a timestamp for every block on the network.\n\nLike BNB, Solana\u2019s architecture allows the network to process transactions at really low charges. This way, games can handle multiple simultaneous transactions from players without any delay in processing.\n\nPolkadot (DOT)\n\nPolkadot is an excellent alternative to Ethereum as it is a multi-chain network. The network is designed to support multiple blockchains, connecting and coordinating actions across independent chains. Polkadot has a main chain known as the Relay Chain, which is responsible for coordinating all connected blockchains. The ecosystem also has Parachains, each one a separate blockchain connected to the Relay Chain. Since these standalone blockchains may have their own governance structures, tokens, and consensus mechanisms, Polkadot fosters collaboration within the gaming ecosystem, allowing multiple chains to pool their resources and benefit from their individual strong points.\n\nIn addition, Polkadot offers a shared security model where multiple Parachains can tap into the Relay Chain\u2019s security, ensuring that gamers can enjoy their favorite titles in a safe and secure environment. Furthermore, Polkadot\u2019s interoperability allows it to easily integrate dApps across multiple blockchains.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX)\n\nAvalanche\u2019s developers created the blockchain to fix specific limitations common in traditional blockchains, including scalability, interoperability, and customization. While many blockchains offer impressive levels of throughput and cost-effectiveness, allowance for customization is usually lacking. This limits the blockchain\u2019s ability to cater to specific gaming needs as desired by developers. The Avalanche chain solves this problem by supporting the creation of custom blockchains that developers can easily optimize for specific use.\n\nAvalanche\u2019s speed ensures that all in-game transactions are quickly processed and confirmed, providing players with a seamless gaming experience. Furthermore, Avalanche has features that support interoperability, which allows the easy transfer of assets between blockchains. As blockchain gaming evolves, Avalanche\u2019s basic infrastructure, which underscores innovation, responsiveness, and adaptability for diverse experiences across different titles, can adapt to specific needs and requirements in the online gaming world."

Selling ETH 1m 2200 Puts is also a decent play with yields above 21% ann. and a decent level to buy if there is a dip into the potential ETH spot ETF approvals.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, significant upcoming events include the Bitcoin halving scheduled for mid-April and the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs starting in May. Meanwhile, broader macroeconomic events may influence the direction of the market in the interim.\n\nEther Exchange Supply Near All-Time Low\n\nThe supply of Ether on crypto exchanges has been on a consistent decline. Over the last ten days, Santiment found that the figure has dropped from 8.18% to 8.10%. This supply is currently nearing an all-time low of 8.05%\n\nSuch a trend indicated that Ether holders have increasingly moved their stash from crypto exchanges into long-term storage in anticipation of a price rise."

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nShiba Inu currently displays an ascending triangle pattern on the SHIB/USDT chart. This technical formation is widely recognized and could be a signal to a significant price surge for the meme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn ascending triangle is characterized by a flat upper resistance line and a rising lower support line. This pattern suggests that buyers are gradually gaining ground against sellers, as each dip is bought up at a higher level than the previous one, indicating accumulating pressure for an upward breakout.\n\nSHIB/USDT Chart by TradingView\n\nFor Shiba Inu, which has been lingering in a period of relatively nonexistent activity, this pattern could serve as massive fuel for volatility in the near future. Recent market conditions have seen a decline in interest toward legacy meme coins, with SHIB being no exception. The lack of significant developments within the Shiba Inu network has contributed to the muted activity around this cryptocurrency.\n\nIn contrast, the majority of the action in the meme coin sector has been taking place on the Solana network. This platform has become a hotbed for the deployment of new meme coins, which are exhibiting far greater volatility than those on the Ethereum network, where Shiba Inu resides. The brisk activity on Solana contrasts sharply with the sluggishness observed in Ethereum's meme coin space, drawing in traders and investors looking for quick gains and high excitement.\n\nEthereum's correction is temporary\n\nThe Ethereum market is currently exhibiting a correction, and there are patterns that suggest a rally may not only be on the horizon but could also be in continuation. The asset has recently experienced a sharp downturn, movement that is readily apparent on intraday timeframes. However, such stark movements are often precursors to reversals, signaling that Ethereum could be gearing up for an upswing.\n\nA closer look at the charts shows Ethereum's price action respecting a series of key technical indicators which, together, build a case for potential upward momentum. The asset has been tracing back to touch base with its moving averages, a behavior that is typically followed by a rebound, as these levels can act as dynamic support zones.\n\nThis corrective phase is noteworthy, especially considering the robust rally Ethereum enjoyed in the preceding weeks. Corrections are a natural and healthy part of any asset's price trajectory, allowing for consolidation before the next leg up. For Ethereum, the current pullback could be shaking out weak hands, setting the stage for a stronger rally propelled by a more committed investor base.\n\nBitcoin's dominance not going anywhere\n\nAfter a brief breach below the 50-day EMA \u2014 a critical indicator of medium-term market sentiment \u2014 Bitcoin has clawed its way back above this pivotal level. This move indicates a bullish signal for market observers, suggesting that Bitcoin is not yet ready to relinquish its market dominance.\n\nHowever, the ascent above the 50 EMA has not been met with the kind of vigorous momentum that bulls would hope for. The growth has been moderate, hinting that Bitcoin might encounter selling pressure as it ascends. This is not unusual on the crypto markets, where significant moves often face immediate resistance as traders take profits and skeptics cast doubts.\n\nThe recent price action has been a roller coaster for Bitcoin, which saw its value tumble from highs around $47,000 to lows near $41,000. This downturn briefly shifted the spotlight to altcoins, which seized the moment to stage local rallies. The diversification of gains across the crypto spectrum during Bitcoin's periods of weakness is a trend that has become more pronounced as the overall market matures.\n\nYet Bitcoin's ability to push back above the 50 EMA serves as a reminder of its underlying strength and the confidence investors have placed in it. Despite the opportunity for altcoins to rise, Bitcoin remains the anchor of the crypto market, with its moves often dictating broader market sentiment. This recent rebound above a crucial technical level could be interpreted as Bitcoin's silent assertion that it is not ready to give up the throne just yet."

        "content": "ETH and SOL were up by more than 90% and 917% in 2023, respectively.\n\nBoth tokens\u2019 price charts and metrics looked bullish for 2024.\n\n2023 could be termed as a comeback era for the crypto industry, as almost all coins witnessed a resurgence in the last year. Notably, Bitcoin [BTC] rose exponentially, while altcoins like Ethereum [ETH] and Solana [SOL] showed promise as well.\n\nA look back at 2023\n\nCoinGecko recently posted a report that highlighted how the crypto market rose in the last year. The report mentioned that Ethereum, the king of altcoins, closed 2023 at $2,294, representing a gain of more than 90.5% in the year.\n\nImportantly, there were no notable price changes in April after the Shanghai Upgrade was put into effect and allowed for the withdrawal of staked Ethereum.\n\nCoinGecko also pointed out that Solana climbed 917.3% in 2023, from $10.0 to $101.3. Average daily trading volume also spiked in 2023, averaging $827.0 million in Q1 before spiking to $2.0 billion in Q4.\n\nSpeaking of cryptos, we must also mention the performance of the king of cryptos, Bitcoin. Its price increased significantly by 155.2% in 2023. In 2023 Q4 alone, BTC rose 64.3%, from $26,918 to $42,220.\n\nTaking into consideration the above increases, CoinGecko\u2019s co-founder and COO, Bobby Ong, noted,\n\n\u201c2023 turned out to be a strong year of recovery for the crypto industry, with regulatory concerns addressed and last cycle\u2019s excesses purged.\u201d\n\nAn altcoins summer in 2024?\n\nWhile the year 2023 was more of a recovery, 2024 might be different as the altcoins might begin bull rallies.\n\nOng predicted,\n\n\u201cGoing into 2024, the projects that have been building during the bear market have strengthened crypto\u2019s tech stack and launched new apps, and we\u2019re excited to see what the next developments will be.\u201d\n\nTherefore, to better understand what to expect from top altcoins like ETH and SOL, AMBCrypto checked their metrics. CoinMarketCap\u2019s data revealed that ETH was up by nearly 7% in the last seven days.\n\nAt press time, it was trading at $2,546.84 with a market capitalization of over $306 billion.\n\nWe then checked Ethereum\u2019s liquidation levels to see at what points it might face resistance if it manages to maintain its bull rally. Towards the north, ETH must go above the $2,600 mark to begin a bull rally.\n\nGoing further, the king of altcoins might face high resistance near the $2,750 zone.\n\nLike Ethereum, Solana\u2019s price chart was also green. The token\u2019s value surged by nearly 5% in the last 24 hours alone. At press time, it was trading at $101.57 with a market cap of over $43 billion.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s SOL market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nTo see whether the uptrend would last, we took a look at its daily chart. SOL\u2019s MACD displayed the possibility of a bullish crossover soon.\n\nBoth its Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered upticks, indicating that the chances of a continued price surge were high."

        "content": "In the current DeFi market, three tokens are spearheading a remarkable surge: Pullix (PLX), Sei (SEI), and Ethereum Classic (ETC). While you may be familiar with SEI and ETC, PLX is a new ICO in Stage 6 of its presale. As it has already sold millions of tokens and helped Pullix raise $3.6M, experts hint it could become the next 100x token in 2024. Let\u2019s find out why.\n\nPullix (PLX): Surges by 100%\n\nPullix (PLX) has recently made headlines as it has already provided early investors with a 100% ROI, interest in this DeFi project skyrocketed. Millions of traders are now flooding this presale event to purchase the PLX native token, the backbone of the Pullix platform.\n\nAt its core, Pullix is a hybrid trading platform that will challenge the status quo. It will accomplish this by combining the best DEX and CEX features. As a result, you can expect to find deep liquidity, access to all asset classes (including cryptos) and more on Pullix. This is game-changing as it has never been done before.\n\nThe PLX token is the main currency used for trading on Pullix. However, those who hold it will receive exclusive access to certain assets and reduced trading fees. Moreover, if you stake it \u2013 you obtain a percentage of Pullix\u2019s daily revenue. This feature makes PLX the very first \u201cTrade-to-Earn\u201d crypto.\n\nAll these benefits have made countless investors stockpile this altcoin, which now costs only $0.08. But, as the presale advances, so will its value. Plus, its long-term growth potential is excellent thanks to its ties to the forex market, which Baby Pips claims is the biggest in the world. Market analysts predict a 1,000% jump after it hits exchanges in Q1 of 2024.\n\nSei Price Reaches All-Time High\n\nMeanwhile, Sei (SEI) has reached a new all-time high on January 3 \u2013 $0.87. CoinMarketCap data shows that the Sei crypto value has jumped 200% on the monthly charts.\n\nThe technical analysis for this DeFi project also paints a bullish picture, as 19 technical indicators are flashing green. Additionally, Sei has recorded 17/30 (57%) green trading days over the last month alone. Because of this, market analysts have made a bullish Sei price prediction. They forecast a surge to $0.9456 within Q2 of 2024.\n\nEthereum Classic Pumps After Bitcoin ETF Announcement\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) has surged after the Bitcoin ETF approval as an Ethereum ETF is next up. According to Santiment, this news has made the Ethereum Classic crypto surpass $26 for the first time since October 2022.\n\nThis altcoin has also been on an uptrend this past year. Its value has risen from $22.45 in January 2023 to $27.42 in January 2024. Sentiment for Ethereum Classic is bullish as it trades above its 100 and 200-day EMAs. Thus, experts foresee a $41.84 value for Ethereum Classic within Q2 of 2024.\n\nCan Pullix Compete With Sei and Ethereum Classic?\n\nThese cryptos are altcoins to watch; however, Pullix stands out. It is still early in its development and has a market cap of $16M. Meanwhile, Sei and Ethereum Classic sit at $1.7B and $3.9B, respectively. To clarify, PLX would need only $16M for its current price (and returns) to double \u2013 making it one of the best altcoins to invest in.\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Liquid restaking's 400% surge augurs a DeFi summer \u2014 if it doesn't blow up like Terra - DLNews",
        "content": "Liquid restaking providers are building a '10-lane highway' into EigenLayer.\n\nTheir approach evokes liquid staking, the biggest business in Ethereum.\n\nAlthough they offer investors greater rewards, they also come with greater risks.\n\n'Everybody is worried' about a LUNA-style collapse, says one DeFi builder.\n\nA new kind of token is gathering steam on Ethereum.\n\nIt has the potential to turbocharge the blockchain\u2019s ecosystem or leave behind a smouldering ruin if its developers aren\u2019t careful.\n\nThe market capitalisation of liquid restaking tokens, which track the price of Ether, was just over $400 million Tuesday, according to data compiled by Hashed, a 400% increase since mid-December.\n\nOnly three liquid restaking tokens are live: Ether.Fi\u2019s eETH, KelpDAO\u2019s rsETH, and Renzo\u2019s ezETH. But at least eight more are running on test networks and are expected to launch in the coming months.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\n\u201cThey see \u2018LRT\u2019 and they think it\u2019s the same thing as a liquid staking token,\u201d said Lucas Kozinski, a founding contributor to liquid restaking protocol Renzo, referring to an earlier class of token widely used in DeFi.\n\n\u201cBut they don\u2019t actually understand the economics of it.\u201d\n\nA \u2018new primitive\u2019\n\nLiquid restaking is often compared to liquid staking, the biggest business on Ethereum. Liquid staking protocols hold more than $32 billion in user deposits, according to data from DefiLlama.\n\nTotal investor deposits in liquid staking protocols\n\nStill, the comparison is apt. Both eliminate the opportunity cost that comes with \u201cstaking,\u201d locking away one\u2019s tokens to secure Ethereum in exchange for a modest annual yield.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThat yield is often lower than the return investors can earn elsewhere in DeFi, for example by lending their tokens.\n\nLiquid staking and restaking protocols address the opportunity cost by issuing IOUs for staked tokens.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s why restaking actually makes a lot of sense, because, well, you should let people get further out on the risk curve.\u2019 \u2014 Mike Silagadze, EtherFi\n\nThose IOUs \u2014 known as liquid staking or liquid restaking tokens \u2014 can then be used across DeFi as if they were the staked tokens, a win-win for Ethereum and for users leery of locking away tokens when there are more lucrative ways to use them.\n\nThat\u2019s where the similarity ends.\n\nLiquid staking tokens, such as Lido\u2019s stETH or Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, have relatively few risks \u2014 at least when compared to most other DeFi protocols with complex smart contracts. All told, there are relatively few machines, people or lines of code needed.\n\nA user entrusts their Ether to individuals and organisations called node operators, who, in turn, run so-called validator software to participate in the confirmation of pending transactions on Ethereum.\n\nIf an incompetent or malicious node operator misbehaves, some of the Ether is destroyed in a process called \u201cslashing.\u201d This is rare, however: only 1 Ether has been slashed since the current iteration of Ethereum launched, according to Rated.\n\nRisk curve\n\nSome foresee a future in which all Ether is locked away generating its modest yield, replaced in the marketplace by IOUs in the form of stETH and its competitors.\n\nThe relative safety of staking is reflected in that yield: just under 4% last Friday, a number that will drop as more Ether is staked.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why restaking actually makes a lot of sense, because, well, you should let people get further out on the risk curve,\u201d Mike Silagadze, of liquid restaking provider Ether.Fi, told DL News.\n\n\u201cWhat if you\u2019re okay taking a 1% risk [of slashing] in exchange for much higher rewards?\u201d\n\nLiquid restaking tokens are expected to increase in number this year. They use the EigenLayer protocol to help bootstrap any number of other protocols, each with its own level of security. Investors earn Ethereum staking yields as well as yield from bootstrapping a basket of other protocols that use EigenLayer.\n\nThe next \u2018Luna catastrophe\u2019?\n\nThe safety \u2014 and the outsize yield \u2014 of liquid restaking tokens will be determined by how well liquid restaking providers manage the basket of protocols they validate.\n\n\u201cOn Ethereum mainnet, the marketplace for liquid staking is structurally very different [than for liquid restaking], because there\u2019s only one strategy you could run,\u201d Kozinski said.\n\n\u2018But it\u2019ll end the bull [market] when a Luna catastrophe happens, because no one cares about risk management.\u2019 \u2014 Tze Donn Ng\n\n\u201cBut when you have all the different strategies that you could run [with liquid restaking] \u2026 it\u2019s actually a brand-new DeFi primitive that doesn\u2019t exist, and that\u2019s portfolio management.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is convinced this is a positive development.\n\nRestaking will kickstart the next bull market because of its high APYs and novel technology, Tze Donn Ng, an investment associate at venture capital firm Tioga Capital, told DL News.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019ll end the bull [market] when a Luna catastrophe happens, because no one cares about risk management,\u201d he added.\n\nAttractive, but unsustainable, yields available on the Terra/Luna blockchain drew investors during the 2021 run that saw most major cryptocurrencies hit all-time highs. Terra\u2019s collapse in May 2022 helped plunge the crypto economy into a deep freeze.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s worried about that,\u201d Kozinski said when asked about the Terra analogy.\n\nEigenLayer\n\nWhen EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking.\u201d\n\nRestaking allows users to stake Ether or their staked Ether \u2014 not to secure Ethereum, but to bootstrap protocols that would otherwise have to run on their own networks, such as the bridges that allow users to transfer tokens between blockchains.\n\nTotal investor deposits in EigenLayer\n\nIn exchange, the protocols that use EigenLayer pay restakers, boosting the safe but modest yields people can earn from old-fashioned staking.\n\nSubchains and L2s\n\nProponents say this will dramatically reduce the cost of some protocols, including bridges, other blockchains, oracles, and diverse technologies critical to the crypto ecosystem.\n\n\u201cI believe that in the next two years we are going to see more non-crypto businesses onboard into web3,\u201d Dheeraj Borra, from liquid staking protocol Stader, said in an X Spaces appearance last year.\n\n\u201cRestaking is going to be a great platform for them to create subchains and L2s, with most [liquid staking tokens] becoming active collateral for these chains.\u201d\n\nOthers, like Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, warn it\u2019s a business model that could cause systemic risk if providers aren\u2019t careful.\n\nEither way, liquid restaking providers are trying to usher in this future.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re trying to build a 10-lane highway to make it super convenient and efficient for that capital to flow in and out of EigenLayer,\u201d Kozinski said.\n\nAs the market matures, observers predict liquid restaking tokens will integrate with the broader DeFi ecosystem and be used as collateral to borrow other crypto, mint stablecoins, and more.\n\nRisk management\n\nWhether that happens will depend on risk management.\n\nChunda McCain, founder of Ion Protocol, a lending platform for restaked assets, also likens liquid restaking providers to portfolio managers, or platforms for portfolio managers. Ion, whose test network launched last week, is attempting to develop tools to analyse liquid restaking providers\u2019 risk profiles.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018We\u2019re going to build a lending protocol,\u2019\u201d McCain told DL News. \u201cAnd then I realized, \u2018Wait, in order to build a lending protocol, you need to do all the underwriting.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe returns from restaking will flow from the protocols that use EigenLayer, which EigenLayer calls actively validated services, or AVSs.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re effectively putting all of that trust into whoever\u2019s running the strategy of the LRT provider.\u2019 \u2014 Chunda McCain\n\nLiquid restaking providers will have to become expert at assessing the risk of various AVSs. And the variety of investment strategies is almost endless.\n\nWith three AVSs, restakers are presented with seven possible investment strategies. Fifteen AVSs provide more than 30,000 possible strategies. Liquid restaking providers must price risk appropriately to ensure their users are not left holding the bag if an AVS goes under.\n\n\u201cThe goal of an LRT is to say, \u2018OK, I understand the profit potential of all these different platforms. \u2026 [and] to make sure I can offer the users who want to participate in the restaking ecosystem maximal returns with minimised risk,\u201d McCain said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re effectively putting all of that trust into whoever\u2019s running the strategy of the LRT provider.\u201d\n\nRestaking stack\n\nHe said he worries that an irresponsible liquid restaking provider will offer users massive yields despite poor risk management, attracting so much money it will become a systemic risk.\n\n\u201cSomeone will most likely build this,\u201d he said.\n\nRisk can come from every layer of the liquid restaking stack.\n\nBecause restaking yield comes, in part, from tokens issued by AVSs, restakers can be harmed if an AVS introduces poor tokenomics.\n\n\u2018Leverage on top of leverage\u2019\n\nRisk can come from node operators that get slashed. And it can come from newer DeFi protocols that allow people to lend and borrow or mint stablecoins against LRTs.\n\nAdditionally, risk can come from old-fashioned bugs in liquid restaking protocols\u2019 smart contracts. Earlier this year, liquid restaking protocol Astrid was hacked and has been paused since.\n\nBut providers can learn from DeFi lending protocols, according to Kozinski. Liquid staking and liquid restaking protocols are essentially lending protocols, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is leverage on top of leverage on top of leverage on top of leverage on top of leverage.\u201d\n\nIf they succeed at managing risk, they could become some of the most popular tokens on Ethereum.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think liquid restaking is another category. I think liquid restaking is just going to become table stakes for liquid staking,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to have pure, vanilla liquid staking tokens even, like, two years from now.\u201d\n\nUpdate, Jan 17: This article was updated to correct a comment from Lucas Kozinski regarding lending protocols.\n\nAleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York DeFi correspondent.

        "content": "Share:\n\nCardano price nearly confirmed a bullish reversal pattern about four weeks ago but failed to achieve success owing to broader market bearish cues. Although the altcoin is now back at a monthly low, it still has a shot at reclaiming the target price derived from the pattern, which places the likely rally at 30% above the current price, and it looks like the whales might play a crucial role in this rally.\n\nCardano price trading at $0.53 at the time of writing, is stabilizing itself following a 17.61% decline in the past four weeks. ADA nearly successfully completed a double bottom pattern, also known as a \u201cW\u201d pattern. This bullish reversal pattern suggested a potential 30% rally for the altcoin, which it almost achieved before the decline began.\n\nSBI Holdings is an ally of cross-border payment remittance firm Ripple. The firm unveiled plans to issue Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) assets on the XRPL chain, according to a document from a recent meeting.\n\nXRP price has been in a downward trend that started in November 2023. The altcoin\u2019s recovery is likely to be catalyzed by bullish developments in the ecosystem. EXPO2025 is an upcoming World Expo event that is scheduled to open on April 13, 2025, and close on October 13, 2025, in Osaka, Japan. Ripple\u2019s ally SBI Holdings recently shared its plans to release NFTs on the XRP Ledger and unveil it at the World Expo event.\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, noted a consistent increase in the number of new addresses created per day and a consistent decline in its supply on exchanges. In the past week, data from crypto intelligence tracker Santiment shows nearly 90,000 new addresses were added per day to Ether.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Ethereum/Bitcoin ratio is up nearly 18.00% in the past week. Ethereum\u2019s recent on-chain activity suggests the altcoin could see further gains. In the past few weeks, Ethereum added over 89,400 wallets to its chain on avearge every day, as seen in the Santiment chart below. Data from the on-chain tracker reveals that 96,300 new ETH wallets were created on Tuesday."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has encountered a substantial obstacle following a significant surge last week.\n\nThe market is currently correcting, and traders are wondering whether a reversal is on the horizon.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: The Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily chart, the price has been very bullish over the last quarter of 2023, increasing by more than $1,000. Recently, ETH has experienced an aggressive rally toward the $2,700 resistance zone. However, this level has decisively rejected the price, and a correction toward the $2,400 area has begun.\n\nMeanwhile, the Relative Strength Index still demonstrates values above 50%, indicating that the momentum is still bullish and the price is likely to continue its uptrend after the correction is done.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nLooking at the 4-hour chart, it is clear that ETH\u2019s price has formed a double-top pattern at the $2,700 resistance level. The relative strength index also signaled that the asset is overbought in this timeframe.\n\nCurrently, the price is forming lower highs and lows, potentially targeting the $2,400 level in the short term. Yet, this level seems likely to hold the price and initiate a rebound back toward the $2,700 level afterward, as the overall market structure is still bullish.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum Open Interest\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s price is still continuing its bullish trend, some worrying signs are arising from the derivatives market. It is beneficial to have a closer look to determine whether a bearish reversal can be expected or not.\n\nThis chart depicts the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, one of the most valuable metrics for futures market sentiment evaluation. Values over 1 indicate that the bulls are executing their orders more aggressively, while values below 1 point to the bearish selling pressure.\n\nWhile the Taker Buy Sell Ratio has never recovered above one during the recent uptrend, the price has been rallying higher. However, it is currently dropping rapidly, making a new low. This cannot be interpreted well, and the subsequent aggressive selling pressure by the futures trader can soon cause a considerable decline in price."

        "content": "Decentralized exchange dYdX, which recently migrated from Ethereum to Cosmos, has topped one of Uniswap's markets to become the largest DEX by daily trading volume, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe Cosmos-based v4 version of dYdX just saw $757 million of volume over a 24-hour period, topping Uniswap v3, which had $608 million, the data shows. dYdX's v3 market, which still operates, had $567 million, enough for third place.\n\nAccording to dYdX, the total trade volume so far for its v4 market since launch is $17.8 billion. In 2023, dYdX's v3 saw a total of over $1 trillion in trading volume with several days exceeding $2 billion of trading volume.\n\nThere were concerns when dYdX departed Ethereum that it might struggle to recoup the same level of activity that it experienced in previous iterations because Ethereum, while a more expensive chain, has significantly higher usage than the Cosmos ecosystem. dYdX's high trading volumes, which now surpass that of Uniswap and other Ethereum-based exchanges (including dYdX's own v3 DEX), might serve as a kind of validation of the company's decision to switch ecosystems.\n\ndYdX focuses on facilitating the trading of perpetual futures, which are contracts with no expiration date, thus allowing investors to speculate on the price of an underlying asset while bypassing the physical settlement of goods involved in standard futures trading.\n\nThe platform recently transitioned to v4, which it coined as a \"fully decentralized\" chain, unlike its previous v3 chain, which the company said was not. dYdX said v3 on Ethereum will eventually be closed, but no firm date is set for the closure.\n\nAccording to Pantera Capital's Paul Veradittakit, decentralized finance (DeFi) users seek platforms that offer \"high throughput for rapid, continuous trading.\" Veradittakit added that \" high gas fees further compound the issue, diminishing user profits and platform appeal.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nVeradittakit said that dYdX v4's transition to a standalone blockchain using the Cosmos SDK addresses challenges head-on by \"promising significantly improved trading throughput, reduced transaction costs and customized on-chain logic tailored to sophisticated and high-frequency trading needs.\"\n\ndYdX is backed by the likes of Patnera, Paradigm and Delphi Digital.\n\nSam Kessler contributed to reporting."

Renzo Protocol witnessed a jump of 4.5K ETH, equating to an impressive 55% rise.\n\nCombined, the three protocols attracted around 186.5K ETH in deposits. As per prevailing market prices, this amounted more than $470 million of ETH locked into premier restaking projects.\n\nA relatively young concept, restaking allows ETH stakers to participate in validating new software modules developed on top of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nPut simply, the same ETH staked on the Ethereum network can be repurposed to extend security to other applications. The security, therefore, gets shared across the ecosystem.\n\nNote that apart from staking ETH natively, validators also have an option of staking liquid derivatives (LSDs) from Lido, Rocket Pool, and Coinbase.\n\nMoreover, validators earn extra yield in return as the staked ETH is used for securing additional applications.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nEigenLayer leads the away\n\nEigenLayer, the largest restaking protocol, saw a sharp surge in deposits since its mainnet launch in June last year. However, the growth has been meteoric over the past month. Total value locked (TVL) logged a 6x jump to $1.67 billion.\n\nThe surge followed a raise in the protocol\u2019s restaking limit to 500,000 ETH from the previous 120,000 ETH."

He cited fears that protocol rules might change, making it difficult for him to build on a base protocol at odds with his vision.\n\nFast forward to January 2024, and Wright seized the opportunity to comment on Buterin's past remarks. He argued that Ethereum only exists due to centralized development teams that have the power to alter the protocol.

Instead, validiums post cryptographic proof that transactions are valid, a setup that aims to achieve higher scalability as full transaction data doesn\u2019t need to be stored on-chain.\n\nHowever, validiums rely on operators to honestly post proofs and can have reduced data availability compared to rollups.\n\nNetworks like Celestia use a modular blockchain made up of data availability layers and validation layers \u2014 the latter using validiums to enable fast and private transactions.\n\nIn a Jan. 16 post on the decentralized social media Warpcast, Buterin shared a diagram proposing an adjustment to some of the terminologies, such as \u201csecurity-favoring\u201d and \u201cscale-favoring\u201d to \u201cstrong\u201d vs. \u201clight\u201d to be \u201cmore succinct.\u201d\n\nButerin\u2019s proposed Ethereum scaling classifications.

        "title": "An Introduction to ERC-4337 (Account Abstraction) Standard - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "The new ERC-4337 token standard enables account abstraction for Ethereum users, allowing for the creation of easier-to-use \u201csmart wallets.\u201d\n\nA significant impediment to crypto adoption is the complexity of account management. But that could soon be a thing of the past, thanks to Ethereum\u2019s newest token standard, ERC-4337.\n\nThis guide will explain what ERC-4337 is, how it works, and its significance to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWhat Is the ERC-4337 Token Standard?\n\nERC-4337 is an account abstraction standard for the Ethereum blockchain, seeking to improve user experience and security by introducing smart contract functionality in wallets.\n\nThe standard is Vitalik Buterin\u2019s and other developers\u2019 brainchild, conceptualized in 2021.\n\nWhat Is Account Abstraction?\n\nIn most blockchain systems, users manage their transactions through Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). These accounts require them to own private keys and use them to process each transaction, creating challenges such as security risks, limited functionality, and usage complexity.\n\nTo address these challenges, Ethereum is adopting account abstraction.\n\nThis blockchain concept shifts user transactions away from exclusive dependence on EOAs. Instead, it embeds smart contracts in users\u2019 wallets, allowing them to interact with other contracts and thus complete exchanges automatically.\n\nBesides automating transactions, these \u201csmart wallets\u201d can determine the appropriate gas fees a user should incur in each exchange. They also support advanced security features, as we shall see later.\n\nKey Features of the ERC-4337 Standard\n\nA deep dive into the ERC-4337 standard reveals the following key features:\n\nUser Operations (UserOps) : Imagine it as a list of all the actions you provide your Ethereum account to execute.\n\nBundlers : The nodes that submit UserOps to the network for verification.\n\nEntryPoin t: The smart contract that performs UserOps.\n\nPaymaster : This entity manages the gas payment system.\n\nHow Does ERC-4337 Work?\n\nERC-4337 token standard transactions undergo a four-stage process.\n\nThe first is the initiation of UserOps, which are instructions for the desired actions, for example, sending tokens. The unconfirmed transactions go to an alternative mempool specifically built for ERC-4337 exchanges.\n\nThe bundlers then select several UserOps from the mempool and pack them into a single transaction called the bundle. Gas fees are the primary determinant of which UserOp the bundlers prioritize. From here, they send the bundle to EntryPoint, a global smart contract on the Ethereum Ecosystem.\n\nFor validation, bundlers trigger the \u201chandleOps\u201d call function on the EntryPoint. That allows the smart contract to receive the bundle transactions. Consequently, it requests a \u201cvalidate UserOp\u201d function for every account, enabling authentication of the operation\u2019s signature.\n\nOnce everything checks out, the EntryPoint processes the appropriate gas fees. Every ERC-4337 wallet must then perform another function to complete the transaction sent to them by the EntryPoint contract. Bundlers receive payments for each successful UserOp to incentivize their facilitation of the process.\n\nBenefits and Limitations of ERC-4337\n\nAccording to its proponents, ERC-4337 will fundamentally transform Ethereum for the better. But as with any technology, it also has its downsides. Let\u2019s look at its potential positives and negatives.\n\nPros\n\nEnhanced Security: The token standard removes the complexity of managing private keys and seed phrases, enhancing security with two-factor authentication and biometrics.\n\nCross-chain compatibility: The standard works across multiple blockchains compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nPotential Scalability: ERC-4337 batches transactions akin to rollups, which could increase the Ethereum network\u2019s throughput for the benefit of its users.\n\nSupports multi-party transactions: ERC-4337 supports creating shared dealings with other parties through multi-signature operations and sponsored transactions, enabling a third party, such as a dApp or another wallet, to pay your gas fees.\n\nSocial wallet recovery: With ERC-4337, you can whitelist certain addresses to assist in account recovery if you lose your logins.\n\nCons\n\nIt lacks true account abstraction: Currently, ERC-4337 only provides an off-chain medium for managing your transactions before sending them to the mainnet. Proper account abstraction is more comprehensive, requiring a significant update of Ethereum\u2019s consensus protocol.\n\nIncreased DoS risk: The standard\u2019s complex verification process could heighten exposure to denial-of-service (DoS) exploits.\n\nLimited Transaction Volumes: ERC-4337 accounts can only send one transaction to the mempool at a time.\n\nPotentially Higher Gas Costs: Adopters of ERC-4337 transactions could pay more gas than they would do in regular transactions.\n\nWhat Is the Role of the ERC-4337 Standard to Ethereum Users?\n\nThe ERC-4337 token standard is still developing in the Ethereum network and will likely grow in adoption and function. Adopters can put its features to many uses, including:\n\nCustomizing spending: Users can tailor-make their transactions by setting wallet usage instructions and spending limits. Again, they can activate notifications for certain margins. This way, their smart wallets will act similarly to the regular credit card.\n\nSubscribing to Web3 services: As the standard supports account programming, users can factor in periodic spending in their wallet\u2019s code. Similarly, they can set up other crypto-specific pay-to-use plans.\n\nAutomating DeFi functions: Your smart wallet readily interacts with different decentralized applications critical to the DeFi sector . So you can instruct it to automate certain DeFi functions, like seeking the best liquidity pools for your funds.\n\nMulti-token gas payments: ERC-4337 expands your gas-paying options because its account abstraction feature facilitates fee payment with any ERC-20 token. That eliminates the need to hold or convert your holdings to a particular token for gas payments.\n\nFinal Word\n\nThe deployment of the ERC-4337 token standard on the Ethereum mainnet has stirred the crypto community for good reasons. Chief among them is its ability to streamline the crypto adoption process. That said, it comes with its fair share of challenges necessitating care in its adoption.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s for sure is that it is a groundbreaking technology that has the potential to alter the Web3 user experience."

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nEthereum developers have successfully deployed the Dencun upgrade on the Goerli testnet today, according to a tweet from Ethereum developer Paritosh Jayanthi. After Goerli, Dencun will be deployed on the Sepolia and Holesky testnets. If all is successful, it can be activated on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nGoerli forked and blobs are now enabled on the testnet! We're debugging a client issue right now, we should have more info in a bit. Expect to hear more later today and a deeper dive at ACD tomorrow! https://t.co/BUA74IfLzo \u2014 parithosh | \ud83d\udc3c\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc48\ud83d\udc3c (@parithosh_j) January 17, 2024\n\nThe upgrade initially stumbled, facing difficulties achieving consensus within the expected timeframe. This was due to a low participation rate among Prysm validators, with 80% being online, according to Terence, a maintainer of Prysm, an Ethereum consensus layer client.\n\nPSA: setting expectations for the Goerli hard fork tonight\ud83d\udc47 The participation is low (~80%). Losing finality requires approximately 10% of validators to be offline. Being offline could be due to operators not upgrading a piece of software (and there are multiple)\u2026 \u2014 terence.eth (@terencechain) January 16, 2024\n\nHowever, the situation saw a turnaround as Jayanthi reported that the issue was resolved as validators returned online, allowing the Goerli testnet to finally reach consensus.\n\nThe goerli fork finalized! \ud83d\ude00https://t.co/LIa3d4Ml5H After the fix was patched in, the validators came back online and the chain started finalizing again. The MEV circuitbreaker automatically disables and mev-blocks have started flowing through as well. Yay client diversity! https://t.co/cLz3ZRxnXq \u2014 parithosh | \ud83d\udc3c\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc48\ud83d\udc3c (@parithosh_j) January 17, 2024\n\nThe Dencun upgrade, initially slated for 2023, was postponed to Q1/2024 due to unsuccessful upgrade tests. As one of the major events this year, Dencun is expected to introduce several major changes to Ethereum, most notably the introduction of ephemeral data blobs with EIP-4844, also known as proto-danksharding, which is poised to significantly reduce Layer 2 transaction fees and enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability. Further information about other protocol changes can be found here.\n\nAccording to Tim Beiko, the head of the protocol support team at the Ethereum Foundation, Dencun will be Goerli\u2019s last upgrade. Following its activation on the mainnet, the Ethereum Foundation and its clients will no longer support the Goerli testnet.\n\nBlobs are coming to Goerli .oO On Jan 17, at 6:32 UTC, Dencun will activate on the testnet! It will be the last network upgrade before Goerli shuts down in a few months.
