        "content": "JPMorgan: Ethereum Will \u201cRecapture Market Share\u201d After Protodanksharding Upgrade\n\nJPMorgan analysts have expressed their expectation that Ethereum (ETH) will outperform Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies in 2024, despite maintaining a generally cautious stance on the crypto market for the upcoming year.\n\nIn a note published on Wednesday, analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou stated, \"We believe that next year Ethereum will re-assert itself and recapture market share within the crypto ecosystem.\" They highlighted the EIP-4844 upgrade, also known as Protodanksharding, as the main catalyst for Ethereum's anticipated performance. This upgrade is set to take place during the first half of 2024 and is expected to significantly enhance Ethereum's network activity.\n\nProtodanksharding represents an initial step towards the implementation of Danksharding, a more efficient form of sharding for Ethereum. Unlike the original sharding technique, Danksharding simplifies the process by introducing data blobs, temporary data packets attached to blocks. These data blobs have greater data capacity than blocks, but they are not permanently stored or accessed by the Ethereum virtual machine.\n\nThe JPMorgan analysts emphasized that the upgrade would particularly benefit Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP). It would provide additional temporary data space, improving network throughput and reducing transaction fees for Layer 2 networks on Ethereum. Essentially, data blobs enhance the efficiency of Layer 2 networks without altering the Ethereum block size.\n\nJPMorgan analysts also indicated that factors expected to be bullish for Bitcoin in 2024, such as the possible approval of spot ETFs and the upcoming halving, are already factored into its price. They noted that the ratio of Bitcoin's market price to production cost decreased after the 2020 halving and stated that a similar response could be expected after the 2024 halving.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "SSV -2.26% Network, an Ethereum staking infrastructure provider, has released its permissionless mainnet, becoming the first project to achieve this milestone using \"distributed validator technology\" or DVT.\n\nDVT enables Ethereum validators to share responsibilities with multiple parties, preventing single points of failure and improving overall resilience. With SSV Network's permissionless launch, anyone will be able to stake and contribute to the overall health of Ethereum, the project said.\n\n\"SSV is the first DVT network to go permissionless,\" Alon Muroch, core team founder of SSV Network, told The Block. \"DVT has the potential to make Ethereum much more secure and safe, solving major challenges like decentralization and censorship resistance.\"\n\nThe current Ethereum staking scenario raises centralization concerns, with a few major staking service providers holding substantial control over the process. Lido and Coinbase alone, for instance, control 46% of Ethereum staking market share. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has also expressed concerns about the concentration of Ethereum's staking providers and has listed distributed validators among the blockchain's top priorities since at least 2021.\n\nLido has been in talks with SSV Network to enhance the decentralization of its operations. \"We are in our third testing round with Lido and expect to hit mainnet with Lido in the first quarter of next year,\" Muroch said. When asked if SSV is also in talks with Coinbase and other centralized exchanges such as Binance and Kraken, Muroch said he can't comment on that, but SSV is discussing DVT \"with everyone.\"\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nSSV token rewards\n\nSSV DAO aims to boost the adoption of its DVT network by offering token rewards. The DAO recently approved a year-long incentivization program, allocating 1 million SSV tokens (currently valued at around $24 million) to reward users for registering validators on the network. Users can stake directly on SSV Network or utilize staking services that have integrated SSV's infrastructure. \"This also means that node operators running on other protocols can double up on rewards by also operating on SSV.Network,\" the project said.\n\nIt took three years of development for SSV Network to launch its permissionless mainnet. SSV Network launched its partner mainnet in September, and since then, nearly $160 million worth of ether has been staked through SSV.\n\nOther Ethereum staking infrastructure projects that utilize the DVT approach are Obol and Diva. Earlier this month, Obol launched its mainnet open beta, while Diva released its operator testnet in September."

        "title": "For Ethereum rollups, dealing with data remains a bottleneck - Blockworks",
        "content": "When it comes to scaling Ethereum, rollups are the name of the game. But as rollups increase transaction throughput, they face a challenge in where to store their data.\n\nThe obvious option is on Ethereum itself. Some argue that doing so is even core to the claim that rollups \u201cinherit\u201d Ethereum security. Ethereum\u2019s execution layer nodes store a complete copy of the blockchains ledger and history, allowing clients to independently verify the accuracy of its transaction history.\n\nWhile great for security and resilience, this comes at the cost of scalability. This is one of the main reasons why the Ethereum mainnet maxes out at around 15 transactions per second (TPS), and can be expensive during times of high demand.\n\nRead more: So your layer-2 is \u2018secured by Ethereum\u2019 \u2014 what does that mean?\n\nIncreasingly, blockchain developers are looking at alternatives for \u201cdata availability\u201d to resolve Ethereum\u2019s shortcomings. Some developers are turning towards modular blockchain solutions such as Celestia and Avail.\n\nModular blockchains often refer to networks that disaggregate specific blockchain functionalities. Dedicated data availability layers are designed to increase the efficiency of a blockchain, improve its transaction speeds and minimize costs.\n\nRead More: Why data availability sampling matters for blockchain scaling\n\nCelestia was one of the first data availability layers to launch its mainnet beta. Since October, it has seen over 900,000 transactions and around 278,000 accounts on its network, according to Celenium, Celestia\u2019s block explorer. The explorer does not break down the network\u2019s data volume or number of submissions.\n\nThe network has also been working on integrations with other layer-2 solutions, most recently with the Polygon CDK, enabling interested developers to choose Celestia for data availability alongside other options.\n\nFor developers using Optimism\u2019s OP Stack, Celestia also introduced Ethereum fallbacks \u2014 a backup solution for data availability. That means that if the Celestia network is temporarily unavailable, layer-2s can post their transaction batches back onto Ethereum mainnet. This avoids the risk that end-user funds remain stranded.\n\nAvail recently launched its testnet, dubbed \u201cClash of Nodes,\u201d which uses gamification to incentivize validators and light client operators with points and rewards, Anurag Arjun, Avail\u2019s co-founder, told Blockworks.\n\nAccording to Avail\u2019s blockchain explorer, there are 56,000 accounts on its testnet, which has processed over 1.2 million transactions since it began. Its mainnet is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.\n\nThe two networks serve a similar purpose, but there are some key differences.\n\nFor one, Arjun notes that Avail uses KZG polynomial commitments \u2014 a type of validity proof used to sample random parts of a block to verify it, without needing to access the full data.\n\nThese KZG commitments \u201care ideal for zero-knowledge-based blockchains, where efficiency, privacy and scalability are essential,\u201d Arjun said.\n\nCelestia instead uses secure hash functions, which Arjun notes \u201cintroduces potential delays in ensuring data availability guarantees.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe tradeoff here is that they have to rely on fraud proofs to confirm the accuracy of erasure coding,\u201d Arjun said.\n\nThe choice between these two depends on the specific requirements and priorities of a blockchain system.\n\nRead more: Sovereign rollups carve a path for blockchain scaling\n\nAside from Celestia and Avail, re-staking protocol EigenLayer has also recently revealed its plans to launch EigenDA.\n\nEthereum core developers are also not standing still; the core piece of Ethereum\u2019s next major upgrade Dencun will introduce \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d or EIP-4844, a process where costs of transactions are reduced by storing them in temporary data blobs.\n\nData availability and storage remains a significant cost driver on Ethereum. Solutions under development are still in their early stages. While its roadmap calls for an eventual transition to \u201cstateless\u201d Ethereum, the current data bloat puts the full Ethereum chain at nearly 1.4 terabytes.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

This retracement is crucial for traders, with many keeping a close eye on the potential for a reversal at around the trendline support level on the ETH/USD chart. However, caution is advised, as the likelihood of a dramatic turnaround seems dim. The current market conditions and network challenges pose significant hurdles for Ethereum's immediate prospects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum's price chart illustrates this recent downturn. After a period of consistent gains, ETH has encountered resistance, leading to a pullback that is stoking a mix of apprehension and anticipation among traders. The sharp decline in price from its recent highs has left investors questioning the durability of the bull run and whether Ethereum can muster the strength to pivot back to its former upward trajectory.\n\nA closer look at the price action shows Ethereum has not yet exhibited the full magnitude of a reversal. One of the critical factors influencing Ethereum's performance is the support, or lack thereof, for the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem built on its blockchain.\n\nUnfortunately, the network has been plagued with unstable conditions, manifesting in the form of enormous transaction fees. These issues have dampened enthusiasm for DeFi projects, traditionally one of the primary catalysts for Ethereum's demand and, consequently, its price.\n\nThe market's response to Ethereum's challenges has been tepid. Without robust support for the DeFi sector, Ethereum's potential for a swift recovery seems compromised. The high gas fees have notably deterred smaller investors and projects, which has a knock-on effect on the entire Ethereum-based DeFi landscape. This setback comes at a time when competition from other blockchains with lower fees and faster transactions is intensifying. However, Layer-2 networks on Ethereum might change this in favor of the second-biggest blockchain in the industry."

        "title": "Ethereum burns $2.5B worth of ETH since merge as supply drops to 18 month low - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Analysis of Ethereum\u2019s recent financial data on Ultrasound Money reveals a continued shift in its economic model since the historic merge in Sept. 2022.\n\nThe decline in Ethereum\u2019s supply stands at 309,663 ETH, equivalent to approximately $686.2 million. This reduction reflects a deflationary trend, contrasting the previous inflationary nature where new ETH was consistently created. The cause of this shift can be traced to the burning of 1,195,238 ETH, valued at around $2.65 billion. Permanently removing tokens from circulation plays a crucial role in reducing the total supply and could enhance ETH\u2019s scarcity and value over time. Further, despite the issuance of 885,581 ETH, worth about $1.96 billion, Ethereum\u2019s total supply experienced a net decrease, illustrating that the rate of ETH burning continues to surpass the rate of new issuance.\n\nPresently, the total supply of Ethereum stands at the lowest point since the merge at 120,211,380 ETH, translating to a market capitalization of approximately $266.39 billion, reinforcing its significant standing in the crypto market.\n\nA look at the ETH burning leaderboard presents further insights by analyzing the leading contracts contributing to the burning of ETH. The top contributors to this activity include major dApps and services, notably Uniswap in its various iterations, Tether, and OpenSea. Uniswap\u2019s prominent position suggests a high transaction volume within the DeFi sector, with $543.8 million burned across four contracts in the top 10.\n\nThe presence of Tether indicates substantial stablecoin transactions on Ethereum\u2019s network, while OpenSea\u2019s inclusion highlights the enduring nature of NFT transactions even through the bear market. This diversity, encompassing DeFi platforms, stablecoins, NFT marketplaces, and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum, showcases the multifaceted utilization of Ethereum.\n\nBurned ETH Entity Value (USD) 84,006.46 Uniswap Universal Router $186,158,315.36 75,926.77 Uniswap V2 $168,253,722.32 74,739.31 ETH transfers $165,622,310.96 58,030.71 Uniswap Universal Router 2 $128,596,053.36 53,626.72 Tether $118,836,811.52 27,441.92 Uniswap V3 $60,811,294.72 26,935.76 New contracts $59,689,644.16 23,405.50 OpenSea $51,866,588.00 22,891.92 Arbitrum $50,728,494.72 22,201.66 MetaMask $49,198,878.56\n\nSource: ultrasound.money\n\nThe top 10 contracts total $1,039,762,113.68 worth of ETH burned, just under half of the total burn since the merge.\n\nEthereum\u2019s transition to a deflationary model may continue to attract investors seeking a store of value, especially when contrasted with inflationary fiat currencies. The heightened activity in decentralized exchanges and DeFi applications indicates a robust trend toward decentralized finance.\n\nInterestingly, under its current proof-of-stake (PoS) model, the Ethereum network has burned an average of 1.83 ETH/min since the merge. However, since the burn mechanic was implemented as part of the EIP-1559 upgrade in Aug. 2021, the average burn rate is almost double, 3.09 ETH/min. Yet, due to the drastic reduction in supply issuance since proof-of-work mining was removed, the total supply has steadily declined.\n\nIf Ethereum had retained its PoW mode, the supply would have reached a mammoth 124,941,176 ETH, some 4.7 million ETH more than the current level. Theoretically, at the current price of $2,228, this would have given Ethereum a market cap of $12 billion higher than current $266 billion. Importantly, due to the increased supply, this is merely academic due to the nature of supply/demand market dynamics.\n\nLooking ahead, these dynamics may influence Ethereum\u2019s trajectory in various ways. Continued deflationary tendencies could lead to increased demand and potentially higher ETH prices, assuming steady or rising demand coming out of the bear market. However, it\u2019s essential to consider that market volatility and external factors like regulatory changes or macroeconomic trends can significantly impact these dynamics, especially with continued activity from the SEC in the U.S. toward categorizing PoS tokens as securities.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum\u2019s post-merge statistics signal a notable move towards a deflationary framework, underscored by high network usage, particularly in the DeFi and NFT sectors, and the potential for heightened value due to diminishing supply. However, these trends warrant continued analysis and understanding of macroeconomic factors to comprehend their long-term impact and sustainability fully."

Crypto-savvy investors can buy the stocks directly on Ethereum. And institutional investors and brokers can can access the stock via a CSD, in a similar way to how they usually access stocks and other securities.\n\nBerner Kantonalbank (BEKB) acted as the issuer agent and custodian. Aktionariat was eating its own dog food, given its business is helping companies to tokenize their stocks.\n\n\u201cWith this transaction, the involved players from the traditional finance world are proving that they are open to the integration of assets that were originally issued on an open, permissionless blockchain,\u201d said Nicola Plain, CEO of Aktionariat. \u201cAn important step towards building a bridge between decentralized finance and traditional finance.\u201d\n\nThis particular transaction was more of a pilot. The three companies now plan to explore commercializing the concept.\n\nIt also aligns with SDX\u2019s strategy to engage with private market ecosystem partners and the Swiss SME investor community,\u201d said Alexandre Kech, Head Digital Securities at SDX.\n\nMulti blockchain tokens \u2013 some takeaways\n\nThis sort of solution raises a few questions. If the two records got out of sync, which one would be legally valid? We\u2019re assuming the CSD but it\u2019s a question worth asking.\n\nIt leads to another issue we\u2019ve raised before. Companies generally have one system where they record their capitalization table. So far, most securities issuances have been on a single blockchain. But that is unlikely to be the case in the future. We\u2019re not talking about this example, where in theory the same issuances are mirrored.\n\nConsider stablecoin issuers such as Tether and Circle. They issue stablecoins on several public blockchains. Stock issuers might choose to do likewise. Franklin Templeton has launched its government money market fund on multiple blockchains. The Franklin Templeton case is a little different because the U.S. SEC requires a separate traditional database as the definitive record.\n\nMeanwhile, Korea\u2019s CSD is building a solution to support multiple blockchain security token issuance.\n\nAlso when you start involving the regulatory sector, there\u2019s a good chance that banks could hold the stocks on their balance sheet. That triggers the Basel banking rules. The Basel Committee is not too keen on public blockchain and seems to want to treat tokenized public blockchain securities like crypto. Given in this SDX case there is a CSD, would they be treated as public blockchain? If the CSD is the definitive record, does it matter that they are also issued on a public blockchain?\n\nOver time these sorts of issues will become clearer."

She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has been constantly recording correction in value, indicating a bearish sentiment in the industry. Further, the star altcoin, Ethereum price has lost over 3% in its valuation within the past day, suggesting a cool-off in the crypto space.\n\nThe Ethereum price traded in a narrow space between $1,850 and $1,920 for a brief period. Following multiple attempts, the bulls gained power, and the price jumped over 14%, after which the coin faced rejection. The ETH price traded under a bearish influence for over a week.\n\nDuring this time, the price lost over 10% in value. The bulls held the price strong at the support level of $1,920, resulting in the price displaying significant price volatility and bouncing between the range of $1,920 and $2,069.\n\nTradingView: ETH/USDT\n\nFollowing this, the price traded sideways over the support/resistance level of $2,069 for a while and recorded a loss of over 3%. After multiple attempts, the market displays a strong uptrend, resulting in the leader of altcoin, gaining over 20% in value within a week.\n\nThis resulted in the ETH price recording a new yearly high. The Ethereum price was seen hovering close to its resistance level at $2,400 for a while, after which the coin lost momentum, resulting in a price drop.\n\nThe technical indicator, MACD, displays a rising histogram toward the neutral point, indicating an increasing buying-over-selling pressure in the market. On the other hand, the averages show a constant decline in the chart, suggesting a mixed sentiment in the market for the coin.\n\nWill The ETH Price Rise Again?\n\nIf the bulls hold the price above the support level of $2,136, the ETH price will regain momentum and prepare to test its resistance level of $2,200 soon.\n\nFurther, if the market holds the price at that level, it will continue to gain value and make a run to test its upper resistance level of $2,300.67 by the coming week.\n\nConversely, if the bear overpowers the bulls, the price will lose momentum and prepare to test its support level of $2,069. Moreover, if the bears continue to dominate the market, it will plunge further and test its lower support level of $1,996 in the coming time."

        "content": "JPMorgan expects ether to outperform bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in 2024, although the bank remains generally \"cautious\" about crypto markets in the coming year.\n\n\"We believe that next year Ethereum ETH +0.75% will re-assert itself and recapture market share within the crypto ecosystem,\" JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note on Wednesday. \"The main catalyst is the EIP-4844 upgrade or Protodanksharding, which is expected to take place during the first half of 2024. We believe that this upgrade will likely prove a bigger step towards improving Ethereum network activity, thus helping Ethereum to outperform.\"\n\nProtodanksharding is an initial step toward the full implementation of Danksharding, a more efficient form of sharding for Ethereum. Unlike the originally planned sharding technique, Danksharding avoids the complex process of splitting Ethereum into multiple shard chains. Instead, it introduces data blobs, temporary data packets attached to blocks, capable of holding more data than blocks but not permanently stored or accessed by the Ethereum virtual machine.\n\nThe upgrade is particularly beneficial for Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism, JPMorgan analysts reiterated, as it provides an additional temporary data space to increase network throughput and reduce transaction fees for Layer 2 networks on Ethereum. In essence, data blobs enhance the efficiency of Layer 2 networks without altering the Ethereum block size.\n\nBitcoin halving priced in\n\nJPMorgan analysts say factors that are seen to be bullish for bitcoin next year, including the possible approval of spot ETFs and upcoming halving, are already priced in.\n\nThe analysts mentioned that after the 2020 halving, the ratio of bitcoin's market price to production cost decreased and said a similar move after the 2024 halving would be reasonable.\n\n\"And given the current ratio of the bitcoin price to production cost is around x2.0 at the moment, this would imply that the 2024 bitcoin halving event is largely in the price,\" the analysts concluded.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nDeFi's 'biggest disappointment'\n\nThe \"biggest disappointment\" of decentralized finance continues to be its inability to encroach into the traditional financial system, which is necessary for the crypto ecosystem to transition from crypto native to real world applications, according to JPMorgan analysts.\n\n\"The biggest applications of blockchain to traditional finance, i.e. overnight repo transactions via smart contracts in blockchain platforms hosted by companies such as Broadridge and JPMorgan, take place outside public blockchains,\" the analysts said. In addition, tokenization is evolving \"rather slowly,\" and it remains at a \"largely experimental stage hindered by fragmentation, lack of cooperation and interoperability between platforms, delays in the introduction of central bank digital currencies by the Fed and the ECB and lack of regulations,\" they added.\n\nCrypto VC funding outlook\n\nWhile venture capital funding in the crypto space in the fourth quarter of this year has improved compared to a rather subdued rest of the year, the improvement appears \"rather tentative\" to JPMorgan analysts.\n\n\"That said, to the extent this improvement continues into the first quarter of 2024 that would represent a significant development that would herald in our opinion the end of the crypto winter,\" the analysts said."

Their goal is to introduce a stablecoin to accelerate the widespread adoption of on-chain assets.\n\nThe forward-looking plan seeks to capitalize on an evolving regulatory framework in Europe, but will ultimately hinge on various approvals.\n\nThe proposed stablecoin, named AllUnity, will be fully collateralized and denominated in euros, the company said Wednesday. The entity is planned to be incorporated in Frankfurt. Its next step involves applying for an E-money license from the German financial regulator BaFin. The company\u2019s aim is to launch the stablecoin within 12 to 18 months.\n\nThe stablecoin intends to launch on several public permissionless blockchains, including Ethereum and Solana, a spokesperson told Blockworks.\n\nRead more: SocGen\u2019s crypto unit debuts euro-pegged stablecoin\n\n\u201cDigital currencies are the natural evolution of the world\u2019s payment system, and Europe \u2014 a region at the forefront of the exploration of safe, secure digital money \u2014 is paving the way for this inevitable shift,\u201d Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz said in a statement.\n\nThe firms expect to appoint Alexander H\u00f6ptner as AllUnity\u2019s CEO, according to the Wednesday news release.

This change would enable the Cboe BZX Exchange to list and trade shares of the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF.\n\nAs per the notice, the 45-day period following the publication of the proposed rule change ends on December 23, 2023. The SEC has designated February 6, 2024, as the deadline for either approving or disapproving the rule change, or initiating proceedings to determine disapproval.\n\nThis comes as the SEC recently announced it will delay its decision on Grayscale's proposed Ethereum spot ETF, stating that it will need more time to assess a proposed rule change that would allow NYSE Arca to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust.\n\nNotably, other firms such as BlackRock, Hashdex, ARK 21Shares, VanEck, and Fidelity have also applied for spot crypto ETFs. Recently, representatives from these asset managers have held meetings with SEC officials to discuss their ETF offerings. This has raised speculation that an approval from the SEC is imminent, and that multiple spot ETF applications would be passed simultaneously.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "LOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / December 12, 2023 / DeFi Bitcoin (DBTC) is an emerging decentralized finance (DeFi) project. In the latest development, the company has raised the bar with the introduction of an innovative market cycle structure on the Ethereum blockchain. This development empowers the trading behavior and enhances project stability.\n\nDeFiBitcoin's unique Market Cycle Mastery structure operates on a weekly basis, comprising two distinct phases:\n\nBull Market (4 days): An upward price movement fostering market growth.\n\nBear Market (3 days): A phase characterized by downward price movement, allowing for corrections and adjustments.\n\nA pivotal halving event occurs between these markets, where half of the remaining supply is mined. This not only reduces the total reward pool of 5,250,000 BTC with each cycle but also increases the value of tokens. The tax remains at 0/0 in both market cycles, creating an environment conducive to healthy trading.\n\nWith the new developments, DeFiBitcoin places an emphasis on security, implementing a series of robust measures. To safeguard the integrity of the ecosystem, the developer's functionality is judiciously restricted, limiting actions to essential tasks such as adjusting tax rates, whitelisting wallets, distributing rewards, and minting supply for distribution.\n\nNotably, the supply minted during each halving event is hardcoded to the connected software, reinforcing the predictability and reliability of the platform. Furthermore, it has fortified user's security posture by renouncing the contract, a strategic move that adds an extra layer of protection, ensuring security even without relying on renounce-safe methods. These measures underscore the commitment to fostering a secure and resilient decentralized finance environment for community.\n\nIn tandem with market cycle, DeFiBitcoin has also developed the DeFi Bitcoin Bot - a smart companion specifically crafted for user convenience. Seamlessly integrating with the ecosystem, this intelligent bot aims to enhance the trading experience. Users can effortlessly navigate the DeFi Bitcoin Bot using simple commands like /status and /reward. These commands empower users to swiftly verify their wallet eligibility for rewards and bonuses, whether in the official Telegram group or through direct messaging.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoving forward, the bot goes beyond mere confirmation, providing valuable insights such as eligibility notifications based on trading behavior, token analysis for maintaining reward qualifications, and trade suggestions for optimizing bonuses. Operating in real-time, the bot ensures users stay informed with the latest updates on eligibility status and potential rewards, accessible seamlessly across official Telegram channels and direct messaging. Experience the future of decentralized finance with the DeFi Bitcoin Bot -the intelligent ally in the world of crypto trading.\n\nWith its newly launched market cycle, DeFiBitcoin emerges as a pioneer in decentralized finance on the Ethereum blockchain. The secure contract and thoughtful design underscore the project's commitment to stability, controlled trading behavior, and long-term participant incentives.\n\nAbout the Company - DeFiBitcoin\n\nDeFiBitcoin is a decentralized finance project built on the Ethereum blockchain. With a focus on innovation and security, DeFiBitcoin introduces a unique market cycle structure and reward system to optimize trading behavior, ensure project stability, and reward participants.\n\nFor further details, potential clients visit the following link: https://defibitcointoken.com/\n\nMedia Details:\n\nCompany Name: DeFiBitcoin\n\nCompany's Website: https://defibitcointoken.com/\n\nstaff@defibitcointoken.com\n\nToken listing\n\nhttps://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xdc631bdcb5ad07d86643f6524de0fd8a33a00a9f\n\nSOURCE: DeFiBitcoin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the original press release on accesswire.com\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Rainbow, a crypto wallet accessible via mobile and browser, rolled out a points-based program designed to reward current users and attract new ones.\n\nOn Dec. 11, Rainbow captured a snapshot of user activity on Ethereum, forming the basis for initial eligibility for the program. It has allocated at least 100 points to every Ethereum user as an incentive to explore its platform. Moreover, Rainbow is targeting users of popular web3 wallet MetaMask by providing a points bonus to those who have used MetaMask\u2019s swap service in the last year, with the amount based on their transaction volume.\n\nRainbow\u2019s points program resembles a strategy commonly known as a \u201cvampire attack.\u201d This approach is used by projects to attract users from competitors, usually by providing greater incentives. However, Rainbow stated that \u201cthis isn\u2019t a vampire attack. It\u2019s a fox hunt,\u201d referencing MetaMask\u2019s logo which resembles a fox.\n\nRainbow has also reserved a specific number of points for its current users and those who hold Rainbow NFTs, according to its announcement. Rainbow added that these points can be redeemed after the version 1.9.11 of its wallet application is released.\n\nThere\u2019s ongoing speculation that these Rainbow points might be exchangeable for future native tokens issued by Rainbow or make users eligible for an airdrop.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nIn 2022, Rainbow raised an $18 million Series A led by Seven Seven Six, the VC fund set up by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.\n\nWhat are points?\n\nTypically in the crypto space, points are granted as incentives for activities such as participating in a network or interacting with a platform. These accumulated points can potentially serve as a basis for distributing crypto tokens through airdrops, a strategy that has been employed by several projects recently.\n\nFor example, Jito, a liquid staking protocol on the Solana blockchain, rewarded its users with points for staking SOL which made them eligible for an airdrop. Similarly, the NFT platform Blur distributed tokens to its users based on the number of points they had accumulated through their activities. Other projects that utilize a points system but have not yet announced any token giveaways include FriendTech, MarginFi and Orbiter."

        "title": "Liquid Collective pitches efficiency standards for Ethereum validators - Blockworks",
        "content": "An Ethereum liquid staking protocol for institutions says it\u2019s now holding those who run its network to new standards and hopes others will follow suit \u2014 perhaps boosting yield and attracting more users along the way.\n\nLiquid Collective, developed by Delaware-registered blockchain startup Alluvial Finance and launched earlier this year, introduced the series of service level agreements (SLAs) last week.\n\nThese new standards will require Liquid Collective node operators, which include Coinbase Cloud, Figment and Staked, to perform in the top 50th percentile of ETH staking providers with 100 nodes or more, as ranked by Rated Network\u2019s validator dashboard.\n\nIf they fall out of the top half, those who own the nodes must reimburse Liquid Collective for the revenue they missed due to their inefficiencies \u2014 effectively penalizing them until they maximize their yield.\n\nStaking to earn yield, in Ethereum\u2019s case, is the process of locking crypto in a proof of stake network to participate in consensus. This involves managing software to validate transactions and generally ensuring the blockchain functions well.\n\nStaking rewards are designed to incentivize validators to act honestly. Operate in bad faith, say by pushing erroneous transactions, and face slashing. This removes validators from consensus and results in lost capital, usually 1 ETH ($2,200) per event, although penalties can be higher if misbehavior continues.\n\nOn Ethereum, a solo staker must deposit 32 ETH ($69,600) to join the network as a validator. Ethereum validators who stake directly to the chain can currently earn an annualized yield of 4%, which the network pays out in ETH as block rewards (some additional yield can be gleaned by adopting MEV boost relays).\n\nLikewise, if the machine running the Ethereum node is slow and unreliable, or the internet connection is poor, that node may miss out on chances to participate in consensus and ultimately lose rewards, which can convert to lower overall yield.\n\nLoading Tweet.. Liquid Collective has published an open source methodology showing how it grades validator performance\n\nUsers who don\u2019t want to maintain their own nodes can opt for a staking service, like the ones Coinbase and Kraken offer, which manage Ethereum validators on their behalf and forward rewards minus a cut.\n\nProtocols like Lido, Rocket Pool and Liquid Collective go one step further: users stake ETH in return for a different cryptocurrency, a liquid staking token (LST), as a receipt.\n\nMany liquid staking services allow smaller ETH stakes in return for scaled rewards, with Rocket Pool\u2019s mini-pools accepting stakes of 8 ETH ($17,400), for instance.\n\nParticipants in the liquid staking protocols \u2014 often third-party partners \u2014 then similarly handle the Ethereum nodes instead of the user, and charge fees for the trouble. Coinbase and Kraken also accept partial stakes.\n\nLSTs such as Lido\u2019s, Rocket Pool\u2019s and Liquid Collective\u2019s can then be traded on crypto exchanges, used as collateral for loans and even staked again in liquidity pools across DeFi to earn additional yield. All this turns what would have been an illiquid ETH stake, subject to days-long withdrawal periods, into a more liquid digital asset.\n\nThere\u2019s about $80 million staked in Liquid Collective, per DeFiLlama, much less than industry leader Lido\u2019s $22 billion. All Liquid Collective stakers and operators must pass know-your-customer and anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) checks, and the platform has 69 unique depositors compared to Lido\u2019s 200,000 and Rocket Pool\u2019s 7,900.\n\nThere are now one million Ethereum validators and about 40% are managed by either Lido or Coinbase. The ETH staked with Lido represents one-third of all ether staked and nearly 8% of the entire circulating supply.\n\nThe growing ETH supply within Lido has become a point of contention over centralization of risk and security concerns.\n\nMake validators better and yield will follow\n\nDue to their fees, liquid staking protocols offer slightly lower yield than the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe two biggest liquid staking protocols, Lido and Rocket Pool, at the moment pay annual percentage rates of 3.93% and 3.57%, respectively. Liquid Collective doesn\u2019t yet publish its yield data.\n\nAs for fees, Lido charges 10%, Rocket Pool takes 14% and Liquid Collective 15%.\n\nWith margins so thin, protocols compete to offer the highest yield possible (and the most attractive tokenomics). Part of that means ensuring operators keep their nodes, which typically run on dedicated servers, operating as efficiently as possible \u2014 hence Liquid Collective\u2019s push to contractually obligate its own maintainers to meet certain service level standards.\n\nAfter all, more rewards for validators converts to more rewards for end users. There have been about 400 slashing events in total since Ethereum\u2019s beacon chain went live three years ago. At 1 ETH each, that works out to be nearly $900,000 in crypto lost due to slashing, at current prices.\n\nMore specific to liquid staking, the largest protocol Lido Finance faced a 20 ETH ($43,500) penalty in October after 20 of its nodes, operated by LaunchNodes, were slashed due to \u201cnon-optimal fallback procedures during datacenter connectivity issues.\u201d In other words, its infrastructure wasn\u2019t properly prepared to handle sudden downtime.\n\nLoading Tweet.. Liquid Collective wants to be the liquid staking protocol of choice for entities with strict KYC/AML requirements\n\nIt is important to note that all three node operators on Liquid Collective are either investors in its creator Alluvial, in the case of Figment, or are owned by a company that has invested in Alluvial, as with Staked and Kraken. Coinbase Ventures similarly invested in Alluvial while its sister organization, Coinbase Cloud, runs nodes on Alluvial\u2019s network.\n\nOther backers include Brevan Howard, Variant and enterprise-grade staking provider Kiln, the latter of which led the build of Liquid Collective\u2019s Ethereum platform. Alluvial itself was co-founded by the former CTO of Kiln alongside two former executives from Figment and Index Cooperative\u2019s DAO.\n\nThe scope of the agreement also only applies to the validators those companies run for Liquid Collective. So, Ethereum nodes maintained by Coinbase Cloud, Figment and Staked in other contexts won\u2019t have to stick to the new standards.\n\nLiquid Collective measures node performance with a system developed by Rated, RAVER, which determines and compares validator health by analyzing whether they maximize consensus layer rewards over time.\n\n(At time of writing, the RAVER system rates Lido\u2019s node effectiveness at 97.9% \u2014 which is in the top 45% percentile and above Liquid Collective\u2019s new benchmarks. Rocket Pool, meanwhile, is in the bottom 10th percentile with 94.7% effectiveness. Liquid Collective doesn\u2019t yet have an effectiveness rating.)\n\n\u201cTo perform in the top 50th percentile, staking providers that operate validators must \u2018beat the competition\u2019 by having better-performing infrastructure,\u201d Mara Schmiedt, CEO of Alluvial, told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about being better than average; it\u2019s about guaranteeing node operators meet the high standards that enterprise clients are looking for when joining the space,\u201d she said. The benchmark will be reviewed on a three-month rolling basis by Liquid Collective to make necessary adjustments based on performance analysis and risk metrics.\n\nOther staking protocols can also adopt Liquid Collective\u2019s standards if they so wish. The firm is betting that its open source methodology for ranking nodes might inspire the wider Ethereum ecosystem to set its own standards, which could help bring more of traditional finance over to crypto.\n\n\u201cIn the competitive landscape of securing Ethereum, it\u2019s imperative for stakers to be confident in the proficiency of their chosen service providers,\u201d she said. \u201cEstablishing SLAs is more than just a formality; it presents a guarantee of excellence and reliability for the entire ecosystem.\u201d\n\nSLAs may not minimize risk \u2014 which institutions avoid\n\nThe pseudonymous adcv, a Lido DAO contributor, expressed it was great that research and new ideas are being shared in the liquid staking space. But they remain cautious about the roles SLAs like Liquid Collective\u2019s will play moving forward.\n\n\u201cThe clear main concern for any regulated institution is to shield their customers from risks, and the two major risks in liquid staking are counterparty exposure and liquidity risk,\u201d adcv told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cI believe the fundamental reason institutions have overwhelmingly chosen [Lido\u2019s] stETH \u2014 open source staking middleware \u2014 to be the leading enterprise-grade staking solution is because it deals with both of these issues.\u201d\n\nAdcv warned that centralization in liquid staking protocols could concentrate counterparty exposure, a big no-no in terms of risk and something that SLAs alone may not sufficiently mitigate.\n\n\u201cI am not convinced that SLAs will overcome these basic needs,\u201d they said.\n\nAlluvial\u2019s Schmiedt, on the other hand, said institutions evaluating liquid staking protocols must also consider whether providers meet their quality and compliance needs. That\u2019s part of identifying all risk vectors, which includes centralization of stake in a single protocol.\n\n\u201cWhile existing solutions like stETH are great for crypto-native retail investors, they do not meet the needs of all market participants,\u201d she said, adding that Liquid Collective\u2019s products are tailored to meet the needs of certain customer segments.\n\nDavid Canellis contributed reporting.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "SSV.Network Introduces Permissionless DVT on Ethereum\n\nTel-Aviv, Israel --News Direct-- SSV\n\nEthereum Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) staking infrastructure SSV.Network has announced its permissionless launch. The milestone is a major breakthrough in creating a new standard for ETH staking by delivering greater security for Ethereum validators and strengthening the network by decentralizing its validation layer.\n\nThe permissionless launch is the product of three years of intensive development in making staking more accessible for all staking participants. The achievement unites the entire Ethereum staking ecosystem, which can benefit from the many uses that DVT allows. SSV Network breaks down entry barriers to Ethereum staking, offering a robust and permissionless infrastructure, enabling seamless building, staking, and zero-collateral node operations through one holistic solution.\n\nThe permissionless launch will enable public validators and node operators to join the network and participate in a first-of-its-kind DVT infrastructure. By going permissionless, anyone will be able to stake and contribute to the overall health of the Ethereum network. To celebrate the launch, the SSV Core Team will host an online event for those who want to learn more about the launch and how to join.\n\nTo support DVT adoption, the SSV DAO initiated a year-long incentivization program which has been earmarked for 1 million $SSV (Current market price - $25 million) and will reward users for registering validators to the network. This can be done by staking directly on SSV.Network or via staking services that embed the DVT infrastructure. This also means that node operators running on other protocols can double up on rewards by also operating on ssv.network.\n\nDVT helps decentralize ETH validators - and by extension, Ethereum as a whole - by increasing client diversity, location distribution, and extending infrastructure diversity, resulting in greater uptime and rewards. Its implementation through SSV.Network will strengthen the Ethereum ecosystem and allow seamless staking for diverse staking use cases.\n\nStory continues\n\nSSV.Network commenced gradual rollout in September 2023 with a selection of permissioned node operators. Having ensured network stability and conducting audits, a broader rollout followed, ensuring security and battle testing before becoming fully permissionless with various staking applications built on the infrastructure. From today, SSV\u2019s community-owned open protocol can be used by the entire Ethereum community to stake, build applications, and run an operator node that utilizes its framework.\n\nIn just over two months, more than $160M was staked through SSV.Network by 74 node operators. In addition, over 2,200 validators are now using SSV\u2019s DVT-based infrastructure. The permissionless launch of the SSV.Network mainnet will accelerate diverse node operators and TVL while establishing the protocol as the preeminent solution for Ethereum staking.\n\nAbout SSV.Network\n\nSSV.Network creates easy-to-use and scalable infrastructure for developers. SSV is powered by DVT technology, a pioneering architectural framework designed specifically for Ethereum staking. Thanks to its permissionless design, SSV empowers staking operators and validators to join the network and participate in Ethereum staking.\n\nContact Details\n\nSSV.Network\n\nRobert Drage\n\ninfo@ssv.network\n\nCompany Website\n\nhttps://ssv.network/\n\nView source version on newsdirect.com: https://newsdirect.com/news/ssv-network-launches-permissionless-dvt-powered-ethereum-staking-778265295"

Can ETH Price Still Achieve A New High This Year?\n\nThe Art of Token Elimination\n\nAt the heart of this transformation lies the burning of 1,195,238 ETH, worth around $2.65 billion. This strategic move involves the permanent removal of tokens from circulation, a process that plays a pivotal role in reducing the total supply. What\u2019s intriguing is that, despite the issuance of 885,581 ETH (approximately $1.96 billion), Ethereum\u2019s total supply has experienced a net decrease.\n\nThough Ethereum\u2019s total supply has hit its lowest point since the merger, standing at 120,211,380 ETH, its market capitalization remains robust at approximately $266.39 billion, solidifying Ethereum\u2019s formidable position within the crypto market.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum\u2019s Strategy\n\nAn in-depth analysis of the ETH burning leaderboard unveils the leading contracts fueling this impactful ETH burn. Major decentralized applications (dApps) and services, such as Uniswap, Tether, and OpenSea, emerge as significant contributors to this deflationary strategy.\n\nUniswap, in particular, boasts a soaring transaction volume within the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, torching an impressive $543.8 million across four contracts in the top 10. The cumulative value of ETH burned by these top 10 contracts tallies a staggering $1,039,762,113.68, underscoring the substantial impact of these strategic burns.\n\nBlackRock & Ethereum: The Impact\n\nAmidst Ethereum\u2019s transformative burn, another potential game-changer is on the horizon. Financial behemoth BlackRock, managing an eye-watering $8.5 trillion in assets, is maneuvering to secure approval for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). This strategic move could offer institutional investors an unprecedented gateway into the crypto market, especially Ethereum, renowned for powering applications beyond Bitcoin.\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock Officially Files the S-1 Application for its Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nAlready triggering price surges with its interest in crypto, BlackRock\u2019s proposed ETF approval could inject new dynamics into Ethereum\u2019s current price hovering around $2,190. The financial giant envisions a bullish trajectory for Ethereum, predicting a minimum price of $3,100 in 2024 and a maximum of $8,000 by 2026, adding an extra layer of intrigue to Ethereum\u2019s evolving narrative."

        "content": "An early Ethereum ICO advisor has argued that fees were meant to be low on the network, questioning the lucrative gas fees users must now pay.\n\nThe Ethereum network has become notorious for its high fees during periods of peak user demand. Depending on the kind of transaction a user wants to execute, gas fees may spike as high as hundreds of dollars.\n\nHowever, an early Ethereum Foundation advisor, Steven Nerayoff, has questioned the current fee structure on the network. According to Nerayoff, fees on the network were originally meant to stay between $0.01 and $0.02, with a high bound of $0.5 allowed for only extremely complex transactions such as those involving sophisticated smart contracts.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe above figures appeared in the Ethereum ICO legal advisory documentation but are now far from the network\u2019s reality. Nerayoff argues that the derailment from cheap Ethereum fees is part of early investors\u2019 agenda to benefit \u201ca handful of big players.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that these rewards come in the form of higher ETH prices and rewards from mining (now staking activities), with those big players controlling a significant portion of the coin\u2019s supply. Nerayoff also questioned while fees were low on other blockchain protocols such as Solana, XRP, and Cardano.\n\n?The drive to push Ethereum, as Vitalik himself hints, often circles back to the lucrative 'gas fees'. When fees skyrocket, it's not the average user but a handful of big players who reap the rewards, especially if ownership & mining are as concentrated as suspected.\u2026 https://t.co/aeVq4zbzlk pic.twitter.com/C98gjEpsAH \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) December 12, 2023\n\nEthereum Aims to Scale via L2s\n\nWhile the Ethereum Foundation has revealed plans to improve transaction throughput on its base layer, the leading blockchain network has prioritized scaling through the layer-2 solutions. Over the past few years, several L2 networks, including Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, and zkSync Era, have all launched in a bid to take the transaction load off the Ethereum base layer.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhile it is still early, L2s have not had the desired results, with fees still significantly high on Ethereum. Newer-age networks, including Solana, aim to capitalize on Ethereum\u2019s weakness, with the older network now under pressure to scale faster or lose market share in the coming years."

        "content": "Ethereum price prediction: The crypto market rallied significantly last week amid growing anticipation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US. However, the week culminated in widespread declines led by Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nThe two most prominent cryptos continued with their retreat on Monday with Ethereum price falling by 6% to $2,215 and Bitcoin price sliding by 5% to $41,796.\n\nadvertisement\n\nCumulatively, the market cap is down to $1.63 trillion. Ethereum accounts for 16.3% of the crypto market while Bitcoin dominance holds at 50.1%.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Will Holders Buy The Dip?\n\nEthereum is in danger of falling below the current support at $2,200, especially if the sell-off across the market continues throughout the US session. There\u2019s a chance the 21 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (blue) will reduce the intensity of the downtrend and trigger a buy-the-dip spree.\n\nHowever, this outlook may fail to materialize based on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator and the potential sell signal.\n\nTraders considering shorting ETH price may want to confirm that the blue MACD line is below the red signal line and the indicator is generally sloping downwards.\n\nThe next key support lies at $2,100 but if the selling pressure overwhelms the bulls, traders would be forced to push the nearest support area to $2,000. Trading below this level could cause panic selling as holders rush to protect the gains they have accumulated over the last two months.\n\nInvestors are likely to be sitting on the edge and preparing to buy the dip if Ethereum price upholds support either at $2,100 or $2,000.\n\nEthereum is approaching oversold levels in shorter time frames, as shown by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) applied to the four-hour chart. Two scenarios may play out based on the RSI\u2019s position and available support areas.\n\nIf support at $2,200 holds and Ethereum price begins to rise, the RSI will also start moving up in the neutral area, suggesting the brief correction is over and a recovery is due.\n\nOn the other hand, if the RSI continues with the downward trend into the oversold region, Ethereum price will be forced to lose more ground and possibly touch $2,000 before rebounding.\n\nRecommended for you: Reasons Why Terra Classic Price (LUNC) Could Explode 38% This Week\n\nEthereum DeFi TVL Rally To $28 Billion\n\nThe total value locked (TVL), which measures the amount of Ethereum locked across the Ethereum decentralized finance (DeFi) has increased to $28 billion from $26.7 billion on December 1, according to data by Defi Llama.\n\nAn increasing TVL suggests that holders have a long-term bullish outlook for Ethereum and are not bothered by short-term price movements. It also reduces the circulating supply, which subsequently lowers the potential selling pressure, thus setting up Ethereum price for a rally.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Enterprise-grade blockchain platform Coti is set to transition protocol to become a scalable, privacy-focused layer-2 on Ethereum in 2024.\n\nAn announcement shared with Cointelegraph outlines how Coti will shift from a standalone protocol to an Ethereum layer 2 to bring its privacy features to the broader ecosystem. Coti v2\u2019s features a cryptographic approach called garbled circuits, which allows transactions to be processed without exposing sensitive information and data.\n\nDrawing from the field of multi-party computation (MPC), garbling protocols enable two or more parties to jointly compute a function while keeping both their inputs and intermediate variables private.\n\nRelated: Near taps Nym for metadata privacy, encryption services\n\nThe technique was initially introduced in the 1980s and has become an essential function in privacy-preserving technologies. The technology\u2019s primary advantage is preserving individual input privacy while allowing for multi-party computation.\n\nGarbling protocols are useful in situations that require confidential data to be included in a computation without revealing the information itself. Coti CEO Shahaf Bar-Geffen explains how the protocol prevents sensitive data from being broadcast to competitors, partners and clients transacting on its chain:\n\n\u201cSensitive data transmitted as public information on a blockchain is a bug, not a feature. This isn\u2019t tolerated in legacy business systems, so why should it be tolerated on-chain?\u201d\n\nBar-Geffen added that garbling protocols offer a unique approach in the context of Coti v2 by enabling transactions and smart contract executions where the details remain private between the involved parties:\n\n\u201cThis level of privacy is particularly important in decentralized finance applications where transaction confidentiality can be as critical as transaction integrity.\u201d\n\nThe CEO said that Coti will primarily focus on powering enterprise functions on a blockchain network in complete privacy. He claims that other platforms that focus on anonymity as a means to provide privacy tread the line in terms of regulatory oversight and are not necessarily effective at providing a compliant base for the wider ecosystem.\n\nRelated: Polygon 2.0: 2024 to see unified ZK-powered L2 chains\n\nCoti envisions its protocol catering to use cases requiring advanced privacy provisions in finance and healthcare. Its current protocol is aimed at enterprises and allows for managing blockchain-based products like custom-branded tokens, wallets, website integrations, and fiat on and off-ramps.\n\nCoti v2 is scheduled for a developer net release in the second quarter of 2024. Coti currently provides digital infrastructure for Web3 applications at a layer-1 level. This includes tools for wallets, tokens and payment modules. Its current layer-1 protocol has $31 million in total value locked.\n\nMagazine: Beyond crypto: Zero-knowledge proofs show potential from voting to finance"

Initially, this service will cater specifically to non-US institutional clients.\n\n\u201cOur primary focus at the outset will be to build liquidity and create a robust foundation. In the coming months, we plan to expand the product to include retail users, additional assets, and features that enable new trading strategies and enhance capital efficiency,\u201d Coinbase International added.\n\nEyes further expansion\n\nCoinbase further explained that it remains focused on expanding its services abroad amid the regulatory shakedown in the United States.\n\nCoinbase has been entangled in a significant legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the past year. The regulatory body has accused the exchange of operating an unlawful platform and listing multiple securities tokens. The financial regulator has also filed similar lawsuits against rivals like Binance, Kraken, and others.\n\nHowever, Coinbase has contested these allegations. Instead, it advocated for the SEC to establish specific regulations tailored to the emerging industry.\n\nCoinbase highlights these issues in its statement, noting how this has impacted its relationship with asset issuers and the crypto community. It said:\n\n\u201cWe recognize the hesitancy among some asset issuers and members of the crypto community to engage with US exchanges due to the evolving and uncertain regulatory landscape in the United States.\u201d\n\nDue to this, the platform launched an international arm in May to \u201coffer a trusted and compliant non-US spot market for those participants.\n\nSince its launch, Coinbase International has grown substantially, processing nearly $10 billion in perpetual futures trading volume in Q3 alone and adding over 100 institutional clients to its platform."

        "content": "Ethereum price started a consolidation phase after a sharp decline. ETH must clear the $2,275 resistance to start a fresh increase in the near term.\n\nEthereum recovered losses after testing the $2,000 support zone.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $2,250 and $2,275 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Eyes Fresh Increase\n\nEthereum price started a sharp decline below the $2,300 pivot level, like Bitcoin. ETH declined heavily below the $2,220 and $2,200 levels. Finally, it tested the $2,000 support before the bulls emerged.\n\nA low was formed near $1,980 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave. There was a move above the $2,120 and $2,150 resistance levels. The bulls pushed the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,400 swing high to the $1,980 low.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $2,320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,250 zone. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next key resistance is near the $2,275 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,400 swing high to the $1,980 low. A clear move above the $2,300 zone could send the price toward the $2,400 level. The next resistance sits at $2,450. Any more gains could start a wave toward the $2,500 level.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,275 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,155 level.\n\nThe next key support is $2,120. The main support is now near $2,100. A downside break below $2,100 might start another major decline.

        "content": "Zero-knowledge technology firm =nil; Foundation has developed a new type-1 zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) compiler to address security concerns identified in similar ZK-powered Ethereum scaling solutions.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Cointelegraph, =nil; Foundation CEO and co-founder Misha Komarov says the technology prioritizes security and allows high-level programming code to be compiled automatically into Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARKS) circuits.\n\nThe firm\u2019s zkEVM is designed to be compatible with evmone, which is a C++ version of Ethereum\u2019s base execution environment. The key takeaway is that the code of applications is processed and rolled up as proofs submitted to Ethereum in the same format as its EVM.\n\nRelated: Ethereum L2 Starknet aims to decentralize core components of its scaling network\n\nThe compatibility is touted to ensure better security and quicker implementation, given that the bytecode is the same and removes the need for lengthy and expensive code audits. The approach also provides transactions and smart contracts directly compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\n\nSeveral high-profile zkEVMs have come to market in 2023. These layer-2 protocols aim to help Ethereum process large transaction loads and smart contract functions. Cointelegraph has covered these at length, with companies like Consensys, Polygon, StarkWare and Matter Labs releasing ZK-rollup solutions to provide high throughput, low fee capabilities to decentralized applications, services and network users.\n\nRelated: Matter Labs steps back as zkSync launches ecosystem portal managed by DappRadar\n\nAs Komarov explains, =nil; Foundation\u2019s solution hinges on an automated compiler contrasting the design of other zkEVMs, which manually define circuits. He describes existing approaches as \u201ctime-intensive\u201d and \u201coverly complex,\u201d which also runs the risk of introducing human error.\n\nThese concerns were evident in discovering a soundness bug in the ZK-circuits used in Matter Labs\u2019 zkSync Era mainnet. Security firm ChainLight received a 50,000 USD Coin (USDC) reward from the firm for identifying the vulnerability in Sept. 2023.\n\nRelated: Polygon co-founder: $1B bet on ZK-rollups paying off\n\nThe bug would have allowed an attacker to produce proofs for invalidly executed blocks, which the smart contract verifier on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet would have accepted. Matter Labs deployed a fix and awarded ChainLight a bug bounty, the first claimed for a ZK-circuit bug in the zkSync Era.\n\n\u201cVitalik Buterin started talking about security concerns, like what if a circuit gets broken,\u201d Komarov explains.\n\n\u201cWe started digging into it. The problem became obvious that these circuits are written manually. People spent years building it, but it basically recreates the same logic that EVM does, manually in the circuit representation.\u201d\n\nKomarov adds that this method makes code auditing extremely hard. The zkSync bug is an example of the potential for error involved in manually defined circuits. =Nil; Foundation\u2019s approach is to automate the compiler from Ethereum\u2019s EVM using its circuit compiler developed over the past two years.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s as close as we can get for the circuit to have the same security as Ethereum's original implementation. If that\u2019s broken, then the circuit is broken.\u201d\n\nThe solution is also designed to be adaptable to EVM changes as Ethereum\u2019s roadmap continues, providing a \u201cfuture-proof\u201d zkEVM compiler that does not require significant resources and time to upgrade, given its automated design. This allows the zkEVM to integrate the latest Ethereum Improvement Proposals as they take effect.\n\nThe foundation published its prototype code repository and specifications on Dec. 12.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

This indecisiveness could be triggered by the speculation surrounding the CPI inflation and Fed rate decision. Thus, the ETH price witnessed storing selling pressure which led to a breakdown below key support threats for further fall.\n\nAlso Read: El Salvador Announces Bitcoin Volcano Bonds Issuance Date\n\nadvertisement\n\nShould you Accumulate at $2000?\n\nA failed attempt to break the $2400 set the alarm to the ETH price for a bearish reversal\n\nThe rising price may face intensified supply at $2400.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $12.2 Billion, indicating a gain.\n\nOn December 5th, the Ethereum price recovery gave a bullish breakout from the resistance trendline of a long-coming resistance or wedge pattern. This chart pattern carried a steady and low recovery for over a year, and therefore an upside breakout is needed.to recuperate the exhausted bullish momentum and start a directional trend.\n\nHowever, with the increasing supply pressure, the Ethereum coin price reverted from $2385 and reentered the wedge pattern. This breakdown undermined the last breakout and marked it as a fake breakdown.\n\nBy the press time, the ETH price was trading at $2189 with an intraday loss of 1.56 %. If the selling momentum persists, the bears could attempt a breakdown immediately below $2133.\n\nShould this occur, the selling momentum would accelerate and could tumble the prices 12% to hit $1916.\n\nETH Total Liquidations Chart\n\nAmid the current uncertainty, the Ethereum coin has witnessed a significant surge in long liquidation on December 12th. According to data from Coinglass, the market experienced a substantial amount of long liquidations of $87.74.

Indeed, Ultrasound Money shows that the supply of Ethereum is at an 18-month low, currently standing at 309,663 ETH.\n\nThe development shows a clear contrast to the inflation that Ethereum had previously observed. Indeed, the asset has now shown a deflationary shift due to the 1,195,238 ETH that has been burned. Moreover, that permanent reduction in supply will have a long-term positive impact on the asset\u2019s value.\n\nSource: Investopedia\n\nAlso Read: Will Ethereum Flip Bitcoin in 2024? VanEck Weighs In\n\nEthereum Supply Drops by 1 Million ETH Since Merge\n\nThroughout the entire history of the digital asset sector, Bitcoin has reigned supreme. However, the rising prominence of Ethereum has caused it to be the only true competitor within the space. Moreover, the landmark merge event had been a massive moment in the increased prominence of the asset. Now, the fruits of that development are starting to take shape.\n\nSpecifically, recent observation has shown that Ethereum is $2.5 billion worth of ETH burned since that merge event in 2022. Altogether, the event has caused a net decrease in overall supply. That decrease has still been present despite the issuance of $1.86 billion worth of the digital asset.\n\nSource: Bitcoinist\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Whale Makes $78 Million Profit After Investing $11 Million\n\nCurrently, Ethereum\u2019s total supply is at its lowest point since that Merge event, with 120,211,380 ETH. Moreover, that supply equates to a market cap for the asset that is still north of $266 billion. Subsequently, it further reiterates the place Ethereum holds in the greater digital asset market.\n\nThe effects of that very Merge event are already being felt, but still have longstanding positives to be uncovered down the line. The decrease in supply will have a massive impact on the token\u2019s scarcity. Therefore, it will only grow in value overtime, and potentially ascend to previuoly unkown heights."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin introduced a new concept for the blockchain platform called an \u201censhrined Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (ZK-EVM) in a Dec. 13 blog post.\n\nThe proposal\u2019s main goal is to substantially improve the efficiency and security of Ethereum\u2019s Layer-2 protocols, including optimistic and ZK rollups.\n\nAddressing challenges in Layer-2 protocols\n\nButerin\u2019s proposal arises from a need to streamline the current Layer-2 solutions on Ethereum. These protocols, vital for Ethereum\u2019s scalability, depend heavily on EVM verification, which currently involves relying on a large, potentially vulnerable codebase.\n\nAdditionally, ZK-EVMs, designed to mimic the Layer-1 EVM, face the challenge of keeping up with changes in the main Ethereum protocol, leading to redundant efforts and increased risk of security flaws.\n\nThe solution proposed by Buterin involves embedding a ZK-EVM directly within the Ethereum network. This internal ZK-EVM would undertake the task of verifying Layer-1 Ethereum blocks, thereby offering a more efficient and secure approach.\n\nAs Ethereum advances, particularly with the development of light clients using ZK-SNARKs, the concept of a native ZK-EVM becomes increasingly practical and appealing.\n\nCore aspects of the proposed ZK-EVM\n\nButerin envisions the ZK-EVM to focus mainly on verifying Ethereum blocks by processing inputs like a pre-state root, a block, and a post-state root.\n\nThis would ensure the integrity of the post-state root as a true outcome of block execution. The proposal also aligns with Ethereum\u2019s multi-client philosophy, supporting the use of diverse proving systems and emphasizing the importance of data availability and auditability.\n\nImplementing a ZK-EVM, as described by Buterin, presents several design challenges and trade-offs. Essential properties include:\n\nCompatibility and Adaptability: The system should be flexible enough to support various proving systems, reflecting Ethereum\u2019s commitment to a multi-client environment. Ensuring Data Availability: Vital for enabling verification by different clients. Emphasizing Auditability and Upgradeability: Allowing for easy inspection and quick resolutions to any issues without requiring hard forks. Supporting Innovations in \u2018Almost-EVMs\u2019: Permitting Layer-2 solutions to extend and innovate upon standard EVM functionalities.\n\nA crucial part of Buterin\u2019s discussion revolves around choosing between an open multi-client system, where proofs are verified externally, and a closed system with predetermined proof systems. Buterin advocates for an available system for its flexibility and compatibility with Ethereum\u2019s foundational principles despite its higher complexity.\n\nButerin emphasizes that speed is critical for ZK-EVM implementations. With technological advancements in parallelization and hardware acceleration, the goal is to reduce proof generation time, allowing for near-instantaneous processing."

This launch is distinguished as the first of its kind to employ Distributed Validator Technology (DVT), an innovation aimed at enhancing the security and resilience of Ethereum staking.\n\nTransforming Ethereum\u2019s Staking Paradigm\n\nDVT, the cornerstone of SSV Network\u2019s recent deployment, introduces a method where Ethereum validators can distribute their responsibilities across multiple parties. Consequently, this reduces the risk of a single point of failure and bolsters the network\u2019s overall robustness.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAlon Muroch, a core founder of SSV Network, emphasized that this technology not only escalates security but also addresses critical challenges like decentralization and resistance to censorship.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Decentralization Drive and SSV\u2019s Role\n\nThe current Ethereum staking model has been under scrutiny due to centralization concerns, with dominant entities like Lido and Coinbase commanding a substantial portion of the staking market. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has consistently highlighted the necessity of decentralized validators. SSV Network\u2019s initiative aligns perfectly with this vision, providing an alternative that could dilute the concentration of power in Ethereum\u2019s staking ecosystem.\n\nMoreover, to encourage adoption, the SSV DAO has put forth a year-long incentivization program, committing 1 million SSV tokens, valued at approximately $24 million, to reward participants. This strategy not only incentivizes users to register validators on the SSV Network but also offers node operators from other protocols an opportunity to augment their rewards.\n\nThe journey to SSV Network\u2019s permissionless mainnet spans three years of dedicated development. Since its partner mainnet launch in September, the network has seen nearly $160 million in ether staked through its platform. This milestone underscores the network\u2019s commitment to enhancing the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nRead Also: Montenegro Prolongs Detention of Terraform Labs Co-Founder Do Kwon"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum, a pioneering force in the crypto realm, has orchestrated a calculated reduction in its post-merge supply, marking a substantial decline of $2.58 billion, according to data by Ultrasound Money. This strategic pivot towards supply reduction represents a bold departure from traditional dynamics, prompting a reevaluation of Ethereum\u2019s value proposition and market trajectory.\n\nSource: https://ultrasound.money/\n\nEthereum\u2019s embrace of a deflationary stance is at the core of this transformative shift. Notably, decentralized applications (dApps) like Uniswap have played a pivotal role, actively engaging in burning significant volumes of ETH. This strategic token elimination aims to reshape Ethereum\u2019s supply landscape, triggering discussions about potential scarcity and its impact on ETH\u2019s long-term value.\n\nAmid Ethereum\u2019s deliberate supply manoeuvre, industry experts and enthusiasts are in fervent debate about its immediate and lasting implications on ETH\u2019s price dynamics. The burning question remains: How will this intentional supply reduction resonate within ETH\u2019s market valuation in the near term?\n\nBlackRock\u2019s ETF Potential: A Catalyst for Institutional Inflow?\n\nAdding a compelling layer to Ethereum\u2019s narrative, the prospect of BlackRock\u2019s entry into the Ethereum market via an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) looms large.\n\nShould this materialize, it could usher in institutional interest, potentially injecting fresh capital into Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem and influencing ETH\u2019s valuation dynamics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum Developers Plot Robust 2024 Roadmap: Key Upgrades on Horizon\n\nEthereum\u2019s developer summit marked a pivotal moment as the roadmap for 2024 took shape. Key upgrades, including the imminent \u2018Dencun\u2019 activation, promise to redefine Ethereum\u2019s capabilities.\n\nThe upcoming Dencun upgrade steals the spotlight with innovative \u2018blob-carrying transactions\u2019 aimed at revolutionizing data storage. This promises reduced transaction costs, signalling a fundamental shift in Ethereum\u2019s operational efficiency.\n\nThe roadmap doesn\u2019t stop there. Plans to bolster the Execution Layer and the anticipated Prague/Electra upgrade showcase Ethereum\u2019s commitment to evolution. Proposals like EIP-6110 signal a forward-thinking approach to on-chain validator deposits.\n\nCommunity engagement remains pivotal as Ethereum enthusiasts gear up to play an active role in refining these upgrades. Discussions on forums and GitHub threads will shape the platform\u2019s future trajectory.\n\nPromise of Innovation\n\nThis roadmap echoes Ethereum\u2019s unwavering commitment to innovation and responsiveness to user needs. With teams primed for extensive discussions, Ethereum\u2019s 2024 journey holds immense promise for technological leaps and user-centric enhancements.\n\nThe Ethereum community finds itself at a critical juncture, witnessing a paradigm shift in supply dynamics and contemplating its impact on ETH\u2019s market performance. As the narrative unfolds, Ethereum\u2019s strategic moves hold the potential to reshape the valuation landscape of this digital asset giant."

        "title": "Ethereum's bearish wave 'is already happening,' says expert - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Since October, the crypto market has been enjoying a mostly decisive uptrend, with multiple cryptocurrencies reaching highs not seen since early 2022. Ethereum (ETH), one of the world\u2019s most prominent digital assets, rose above $2,300 during this time.\n\nThings, however, took an unexpected turn in the night between December 10 and 11 when liquidations totaling approximately $300 million sent multiple cryptocurrencies rapidly dropping. Bitcoin (BTC) fell from more than $44,000 to below $42,000, and Ethereum declined from about $2,350 to about $2,250.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, which somewhat stabilized, ETH continued its decline, and crypto trader and analyst AlanSantana posted his assessment and the accompanying chart on TradingView, stating that for Ethereum, \u201cthe bearish wave is only now starting, but it is already happening.\u201d\n\nETH price chart analysis. Source: TradingView and AlanSantana\n\nETH is in a strong downtrend as sell volume surges\n\nIn his breakdown of the current state of Ethereum, AlanSantana stated that during trading on December 12, the cryptocurrency \u201cproduced the strongest bearish session in many months.\u201d The analyst went on to explain that ETH\u2019s selling volume has significantly overtaken the buying volume and that the cryptocurrency, in fact, closed below the 10-day exponential moving average (EMA 10).\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s relative strength index (RSI), amidst the bearish momentum, is \u201cjumping off a cliff.\u201d\n\nWhile warning that ETH is bound for a significant drop, AlanSantana also offered some silver lining to crypto traders, predicting that after the current price correction is over, the cryptocurrency will have a stronger year than 2021. In 2021, Ethereum rose above $4,000 for the first and only time in its history and ended the year strong at more than $3,760.\n\nFinally, in his post, AlanSantana concluded that despite the bearish trend, there is little reason to panic and added that the market always offers opportunities to investors and always offers enough time to act.\n\nThere is always plenty of time to act. The market offers endless opportunities\u2026 And is here to stay.\n\nETH price analysis\n\nEthereum entered the biggest bull run of 2023 in late October after renewed investor enthusiasm and a string of positive news sent the crypto market rallying. This uptrend experienced a sharp stop in the early hours of Monday, December 11, and in the last seven days ETH declined 7.94%.\n\nThe cryptocurrency\u2019s performance in the last 24 hours seemingly confirms AlanSantana\u2019s assessment, as Ethereum declined 2.17% and stood at $ 2,184 at the time of publication.\n\nETH 1-day price chart.\n\nDespite the current price correction, ETH\u2019s overall performance so far in 2023 remains impressive. Between October 18 and December 13, it climbed about $500 from $1,567. Since the beginning of the year, Ethereum is up a total of 80.96%.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice. Investing is speculative.

Discover SCENE\n\nCrypto gaming company Immutable announced Wednesday that it will let players avoid transaction fees on its upcoming Immutable zkEVM network, thanks to a feature that lets game developers \"sponsor\" such gas fees for players.\n\nGames that are built on Immutable zkEVM, a gaming-focused Ethereum scaling network announced in March, will be able to enable the feature. Such a move could make it more affordable for players to try new games, and potentially remove significant barriers to broader blockchain gaming adoption.\n\n\u201cThere are a couple of norms in the blockchain space that mainstream players simply won\u2019t accept\u2014gas fees fall into that category,\u201d said Immutable Product Marketing Lead Michael Powell in a statement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTo truly appeal to all gamers, Web3 games must be able to offer players a familiar and streamlined user experience, making the blockchain components as effortless and native as possible,\u201d Powell added.\n\nPlayers who use the upcoming universal gamer profile system Immutable Passport will be able to avoid gas fees for games sponsored by their developers. Immutable says that it will sponsor gas fees for all games itself for a \"limited time\" when the zkEVM mainnet launches early next year.\n\nTo make their games gas-free, game studios can deposit funds into a special smart contract wallet, so fees from Passport users are automatically paid without showing up for players. Immutable believes the cost to studios will be negligible compared to the benefits.\n\nUltimately, Immutable zkEVM and Passport aim to abstract gas fees from players and push for a monetization model where studios treat gas costs like infrastructure expenses. The company believes that this will lead to smoother onboarding and higher transaction conversion rates.\n\nMore than 200 games have currently committed to building within Immutable's broader ecosystem, with titles like Shardbound, MetalCore, and Space Nation set to launch on the Immutable zkEVM network.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This article was written with the assistance of AI.

        "content": "This post is sponsored and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThe crypto market is poised for another exciting chapter in 2024 as the Web3 space continues to thrill. Crypto enthusiasts are eagerly exploring the landscape for the next wave of coins that will capture the spotlight.\n\nThis comprehensive guide compiles information and insights from market trends and official sources to shed light on the crypto tokens that could make waves in 2024, with a detailed glimpse on the young trendsetter meme coin, ApeMax.\n\nWhat Defines the \u201cNext Big Crypto\u201d?\n\nThe term \u201cnext big crypto\u201d refers to digital currencies with the potential to introduce innovative and distinct features to the crypto landscape. ApeMax exemplifies this concept by being the first \u201cBoost-to-Earn\u201d coin, and Ethereum embodied this by pioneering smart contracts and their use cases.\n\nTop Contenders for the Next Big Crypto in 2024\n\nThis list provides a mix of new entrants alongside industry staples.\n\n1. ApeMax (APEMAX)\n\nApeMax emerges as a revolutionary new coin, boasting a growing presale that is currently open to eligible buyers. Its standout feature allows token holders to earn rewards as they stake or boost entities right from the presale stage, setting it apart from other cryptocurrencies.\n\nRepresenting a fusion of meme culture and practical utility, ApeMax is making waves with its unique features. The ongoing presale for ApeMax is now live for a limited time, including exclusive discount loot boxes for eligible participants.\n\n2. Ethereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum maintains its prominence in the crypto space, leading the charge in the smart contract revolution. The platform\u2019s robust infrastructure continues to empower decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts, with the rise of NFTs and Web3 gaming sustaining Ethereum\u2019s relevance.\n\n3. Cardano (ADA)\n\nCardano, with its layered architecture and Ouroboros Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, remains dedicated to scalability and security for smart contracts and DApps. Founded by Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of Ethereum, Cardano continues to evolve and innovate, with over $19 billion market cap according to CoinMarketCap.\n\n4. Solana (SOL)\n\nSolana, a third-generation blockchain platform, utilizes PoS and PoH mechanisms to deliver smart contract functionality. Market perception has positioned SOL as a smaller potential \u201cEthereum rival,\u201d owing to its high speeds, low costs, and overall efficiency.\n\nWhich New Crypto is Trending?\n\nRight after Ethereum set the stage with its NFT explosion and the Bitcoin community flexed their creative muscles with Ordinals, fresh tokens like ApeMax, Worldcoin, and Pepe Coin are attracting some of the spotlight. Meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are also back in the game with a newfound excitement.\n\nWhat is the Next Crypto Star in 2024?\n\nWhile several tokens, including new coins like ApeMax, are attracting new fans, it\u2019s hard to say which among these coins will be the next star in 2024. The dynamic nature of the crypto ecosystem, influenced by external factors, adds an element of uncertainty to any token\u2019s trajectory.\n\nCan ApeMax Achieve the $1 Milestone?\n\nThe trajectory of ApeMax\u2019s value remains speculative, with factors such as market demand and circulating supply playing pivotal roles. Despite the uncertainty, the ongoing presale momentum and innovative tokenomics position ApeMax a unique new crypto coin.\n\nFinal Considerations\n\n2024 could shape up to be a dynamic year for the crypto market as bullish market sentiment is felt prior to the new year. With Ethereum, Solana, ApeMax and other coins showcasing unique creativity or innovation. However, even if the crypto landscape offers opportunities, enthusiasts should still conduct thorough research prior to engaging with any cryptocurrency.\n\nUnderstanding associated risks and the inherent volatility of crypto is very important. Additionally, it\u2019s also important to note that certain coins, including ApeMax, may have geographical purchase restrictions. Prospective buyers of ApeMax tokens should ensure that they are not from restricted regions and that they comply with all buying prerequisites. Ineligible places are the US, Canada, and other countries. Readers can check the official ApeMax website for up-to-date and thorough information on the subject."

        "content": "Cambridge Study: Ethereum Consumes 28x Less Energy Than American Express\n\nThe world\u2019s second-largest crypto protocol Ethereum network, is reported to consume 28 times less energy than the American Express business, according to a recent report from the University of Cambridge.\n\nThe report compares the annual energy consumption of the smart contract-powered blockchain service to that of several legacy-based financial and corporate businesses.\n\nAccording to the Cambridge Blockchain Network Sustainability Index report, Ethereum\u2019s annual energy consumption of 7 Gigawatts per hour (GWh) is 28 times lower than American Express, which operates on 202.73 GWh.\n\nIt is also 50 times less than the energy consumed by the Deutsche Bank, which uses up 437 GWh.\n\nNEWS: American Express Uses 28x More Energy Than Ethereum Says Cambridge. pic.twitter.com/sFI3ElyluL \u2014 BuzzBeatHQ \ud83d\ude80 (@mely_buzz) December 12, 2023\n\nWhen placed side-by-side in terms of assets under management (AUM), the Deutsche Bank controls more than $820 billion in assets, while Ethereum commands upwards of $350 million both on-chain and in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.\n\nThis shows that the Deutsche Bank uses 25 times more energy per dollar managed than the Ethereum blockchain network.\n\nAdditionally, the Ethereum network proves to be more energy-efficient than the Netflix streaming service, which consumes 123 GWh annually. It is also more than 30 times less energy intensive than the Burj Khalifa, which uses a mammoth 243.4GWh to power its skyscraper edifice.\n\nFurthermore, the Cambridge report reveals that the 7 GWh energy needs of the smart contract network can only power its campus for 19 days. Other household appliances, such as air conditioners, are also considered in the context of energy consumption.\n\nThe report further outlines that the energy needs of the decentralized finance ecosystem are equivalent to the yearly consumption of 676 air conditioners and are capable of meeting the power needs of 1,969 average households.\n\nMoreover, the 7 GWh output would only be exhausted by a Tesla Cybertruck covering a total distance of 17.1 million.\n\nEthereum\u2019s high-efficiency metrics follow its breakaway from the secure yet slow and energy-cumbersome proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm.\n\nFollowing its switch from a PoW to a proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism earlier in the year, the validation of transactions and creation of new Ether assets no longer relies on a distributed network of miners who have to compete to be first.\n\nInstead, the Ethereum network requires validators to lock up a minimum of 32 Ether coins in order to verify transactions on the network.\n\nEach validator is selected and only requires software on their computer to keep the network operating optimally.\n\nSupra Makes the Ethereum Jump\n\n\n\nFunctioning as the central hub for all things DeFi, the Ethereum network is a huge attraction for the 2,000 plus decentralized applications (dApps) that operate in its ecosystem.\n\nSo far, the open-source, decentralized protocol has maintained a 19% market share of the crypto market with huge potential to become a strong contender for the crypto throne in the near future.\n\nThis potential is further strengthened by the recent launch of the decentralized Verifiable Random Function (dVRF) service on the Ethereum mainnet by the SupraOracles dApp.\n\nThe dVRF allows blockchain protocols to securely access real-world information authenticated by a vetted pool of data providers.\n\n\u26a1 @SupraOracles is thrilled to announce that we've successfully launched our decentralized Verifiable Random Function (dVRF) service on the #Ethereum Mainnet \ud83c\udf89 This is a huge step forward for our team \ud83d\udc63 pic.twitter.com/18mipr5pzn \u2014 Supra (@SupraOracles) December 12, 2023\n\nThe SupraOracles network joins a growing pool of decentralized oracle networks (DONs) that help blockchain services stay in the loop of happenings outside of themselves."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s net supply has been shrinking at an annual rate of 0.248%\n\nProjections highlighted interesting observations for Ethereum\u2019s supply\n\nMore than 307,000 Ethereum [ETH] coins have exited circulation since the pivotal \u2018Merge\u2019 event. In fact, this was the lowest volume of ETH in circulation since the network made a historic shift from the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nETH\u2019s supply goes south\n\nAccording to AMBCrypto\u2019s scrutiny of ultra sound money data, the net supply has been shrinking at an annual rate of 0.248%. This might appear inconsequential to some but fathom this \u2013 Had the transition not taken place, ETH\u2019s total supply would have increased by more than 4.71 million with an annual inflation rate of 3.168%.\n\nScarcity is critical to the long-term demand of any financial asset. In the case of cryptocurrencies, the fewer tokens in circulation, the greater the likelihood of price increases, provided demand for the asset remains the same.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum\u2019s current supply stood at 120.21 million. As per long-term projections, the supply has hit its peak, with the same to gradually start declining from next year. By the end of 2025, the total number of ETH in circulation is predicted to shrink to 117.7 million.\n\nA much-needed respite\n\nThis is a welcome development as not too long ago, ETH became inflationary owing to poor participation on the network. For much of September and early October, more coins were getting created than they were burned.\n\nAs examined by AMBCrypto using Glassnode\u2019s data, network fees tumbled to yearly lows during the aforementioned period. This suggested that transactions on the network had declined, leading to fewer ETH getting burned.\n\nNote that a part of the fee charged for validating transactions, called base fee, is burned and removed from circulation. Generally, a bull market with high network usage aids deflation and vice versa.\n\nRead ETH\u2019s Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nMarket still upbeat, despite pullback\n\nAt press time, the second-largest cryptocurrency was exchanging hands at $2.240, having just recorded one of the sharpest corrections since the commencement of the bull rally in October.\n\nHaving said that, the market sentiment remains optimistic. Greed remains uniform across the market, with AMBCrypto using Hyblock Capital\u2019s data to highlight the same. This is a key finding since it is generally assumed that greed drives the asset\u2019s value higher."

        "title": "Cardano (ADA): What It Is, How It Differs From Bitcoin - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is Cardano (ADA)?\n\nCardano (ADA) is a decentralized proof of stake (PoS) blockchain designed to be a more efficient alternative to proof of work (PoW) networks. It is intended to evolve into a system with multiple use cases, governed by those who have staked their cryptocurrency.\n\nCardano\u2019s cryptocurrency is named Ada after Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (1815\u20131852), commonly regarded as the first computer programmer. Ada is used in the blockchain\u2019s PoS consensus mechanism. It is given as a reward for work done for the blockchain or can be purchased on exchanges.\n\nKey Takeaways Cardano is a blockchain platform that was founded in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson. It was launched in 2017.\n\nCardano aims to be a decentralized application (dApp) development platform with a multi-asset ledger and verifiable smart contracts.\n\nCardano runs on the proof-of-stake Ouroboros consensus protocol using its native token, Ada.\n\nHistory of Cardano (ADA)\n\nCharles Hoskinson, an Ethereum co-founder, began developing Cardano in 2015 and launched the platform in 2017. Cardano has positioned itself as an alternative to Ethereum. Both platforms are used for similar applications, such as smart contracts, and aim to build a connected and decentralized system.\n\nCardano considers itself an updated version of Ethereum and has anointed itself a \u201cthird-generation\u201d platform compared with Ethereum\u2019s \u201csecond-generation\u201d credentials. The blockchain platform also has a goal of providing banking services to the world\u2019s unbanked.\n\nCardano vs. Bitcoin\n\nThere are several key differences between Bitcoin and Cardano. Bitcoin was developed to be a peer-to-peer payment system. Cardano is an ecosystem that allows other developers to create tokens, decentralized applications (dApps), or any other uses a scalable blockchain network can host.\n\nThe Cardano platform runs on the Ouroboros consensus protocol. Ouroboros, created by Cardano in its foundation phase, was the first proof of stake (PoS) protocol designed to reduce the energy expenditure required by proof of work (PoW) mining. It does this by eliminating the massive computing resources that the proof of work algorithm uses.\n\nCardano doesn\u2019t reward its cryptocurrency as an incentive in a competitive mining process like Bitcoin. This reduces the energy and waste footprints by not requiring large amounts of electricity to power computers specifically designed for mining. Cardano users can install compatible wallet software on their computers or devices, stake their Ada, and begin earning rewards for participating.\n\n\n\nAda is Cardano\u2019s digital currency, named after Augusta Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century countess and English mathematician recognized as the first computer programmer.\n\nWhat Is Cardano Staking?\n\nIn Cardano\u2019s PoS system, staking determines a node\u2019s capability to open blocks on the blockchain. A node\u2019s stake is equal to the amount of Ada it holds over the long term. A stake is an interest a pool participant holds, secured with Ada that is pledged. Pledged Ada cannot be used or spent by the holder because it is held as collateral for honest validation behavior. Users with pledged Ada are given rewards based on the amount of Ada they have staked.\n\nUsers join or create staking pools\u2014groups of Ada holders who have pledged their coins\u2014and work together to update the ledger, open new blocks, and earn rewards.\n\nHow Do Cardano Staking Pools Work?\n\nCardano uses the PoS consensus mechanism, in which users \u201cstake\u201d a coin for the opportunity to become a validator. Users can participate in the staking and validation process in two ways: You can stake your Ada in a pool or create your own. Stake pools are trusted server nodes that conduct the work of validating transactions. These pools can be either public or private. Public pools distribute rewards to members based on how much Ada they have staked. Private pools, as the name suggests, give rewards to the owner(s).\n\nA stake pool must be run by an operator with the knowledge and skills to maintain the stake pool by renting servers, monitoring the node, holding the pool key, and conducting other pool administration tasks.\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nCardano implemented smart contract support in 2021 with its Alonzo update. This testnet update was the first iteration of bringing the promised scalability and use cases to users. This update allowed users to create smart contracts and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and manage multiple assets. Future releases and forks will bring more capabilities to the mainnet.\n\nWhat Is the Best Place to Stake Cardano?\n\nThere are several staking pools you can choose from to stake your Ada. It\u2019s essential to thoroughly read through a pool\u2019s website, user reviews, complaints, or issues to be sure that you\u2019re joining a reputable pool.\n\nYou can also use the community-built tools ADApools.org, Cardanoscan.io, Pool.pm, Poolstats.org, or Pooltool.io to help you select a pool. You can also use the Yoroi, Exodus, or Binance wallets to stake your Ada. You can also use Daedalus, a full desktop application developed by IOHK that downloads a copy of the blockchain. Daedalus is a full node that acts as a wallet that verifies all transactions in its history and lets you choose a pool to join.\n\n\n\nFuture of Cardano\n\nCardano is designed to be developed in \u201ceras\u201d named after notable figures in poetry and computer science history: Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire. Basho is the era of scaling and optimization, intended to bring more capabilities to Cardano. As of 2023, Cardano is anticipating the transition from Basho to Voltaire.\n\nVoltaire is the final era for Cardano development, intended to bring voting and treasury management of the blockchain and network through previously introduced smart contract functionality and system improvements. When Voltaire is complete, IOHK\u2019s goal is to release the blockchain and network to the community, as it will be fully decentralized and able to be developed, maintained, and kept secure.\n\n\n\nWhere Do I Get Cardano (ADA)? You can buy Cardano (ADA) on cryptocurrency exchanges or by participating in the network.\n\nHow Do I Mine Cardano (ADA)? Cardano cannot be mined in the way that other cryptocurrencies can. Instead, it must be purchased on a cryptocurrency exchange or earned.\n\nWhat Is the Cardano (ADA) Market Cap? Cardano (ADA) had a market capitalization of about $22.2 billion on Dec. 13, 2023.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCardano is a decentralized PoS blockchain founded in 2015 and launched in 2017. It has positioned itself as an alternative to PoW blockchains like Bitcoin because it is more energy-efficient and scalable.\n\nThe plans behind Cardano\u2019s development are ambitious. Its developers see Cardano as eventually becoming fully decentralized when voting and treasury management of blockchain are added to its capabilities in the future.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "content": "In the wake of a remarkable surge that propelled Ethereum to a yearly high of $2.4K, the subsequent encounter with selling pressure resulted in a notable rejection.\n\nPresently, ETH finds itself within a critical price range, and a breakout from this range will likely chart the course for the cryptocurrency\u2019s next moves.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nEthereum has displayed significant bullish signals, with the price exhibiting a robust uptrend that retraced above the pivotal resistance level of $2.1K. Despite a temporary setback, the cryptocurrency maintained its upward trajectory, reaching an annual peak of $2.4K. This PA suggests a revived bullish market, reflecting renewed demand and heightened buying interest among market participants.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to acknowledge that short-term corrections typically follow each bullish surge. As evident from the chart, Ethereum\u2019s upward momentum faced rejection upon hitting the upper boundary of the wedge, resulting in a 10% decline.\n\nThe divergence between the price and the RSI indicator also supports the likelihood of a brief retracement before initiating the next bullish move. In such a scenario, the $2K support zone is anticipated to be Ethereum\u2019s next destination in the daily timeframe.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nA closer examination of the 4-hour chart reveals that Ethereum\u2019s robust upward movement lost momentum upon encountering a pivotal resistance zone, encompassing the $2.4K price range and the upper threshold of the ascending wedge pattern. On the other hand, the expanded bearish divergence between the price and RSI played a crucial role in triggering a substantial rejection.\n\nHowever, Ethereum has already reached a crucial support region, encompassing the price range between 0.5 ($2,211) and 0.618 ($2,166) Fibonacci levels and the static support level of $2K. A breach below these critical support levels may signal a significant downturn in the market.\n\nDespite the prevailing bullish sentiment and apparent control by buyers in the current market dynamics, there exists a notable likelihood of a temporary consolidation correction phase in the short term, accompanied by increased volatility.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has recently surged, reclaiming the $2,1K price range, sparking expectations among market participants of the onset of a new long-term bull market. Accordingly, examining the sentiment in the futures market can offer valuable insights into Ethereum\u2019s overall prospects.\n\nThis chart illustrates Ethereum\u2019s open interest, a measure of the number of open perpetual futures contracts on a daily basis. Typically, higher values indicate increased volatility and potential bearish reversals, while lower values suggest a more sustainable trend. As the chart clearly illustrates, a gradual rise in the Open Interest metric often accompanies bullish market phases. However, if the metric reaches elevated levels, it could signal a potential major market reversal.\n\nThe open interest has been on an upward trajectory but has yet to reach values observed during the all-time highs. Consequently, while corrections are always possible, the futures market is still far from overheating. The current bullish trend, supported by moderate levels of open interest, will likely persist in the coming weeks. Monitoring this metric will be essential to gauge potential shifts in market sentiment and adapt strategies accordingly."

MetaMask said in early 2022 that it plans to launch a token, but nothing has come of it yet.\n\nWhat is an airdrop?\n\nAirdrops refer to free cryptocurrency tokens sent to wallets already holding a cryptocurrency like Ethereum or Solana, or to the wallets of early users or contributors to a new protocol or app.\n\nWho receives an airdrop can vary depending on the stipulations of the groups sending the tokens. Similar to play-to-earn tokens, airdrops from protocols like Blur and Pyth Network reward users who participate in the network.\n\nAirdrops are very popular in the DeFi space; last month, a single user received $8.4 million worth of BLUR in the \u201csecond season\u201d of Blur NFT marketplace airdrops.\n\nLast week, Jito, a DeFi protocol on the Solana network, announced an airdrop of 90 million tokens in anticipation of the JTO token being listed on Coinbase. After the listing on Coinbase, the combined value of the distributed tokens hit $225 million.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Tue 12 Dec 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nAs Ethereum\u2019s price dropped by more than 5% this Monday, some strategic investors see it as a golden opportunity to accumulate more ETH at advantageous costs.\n\nEthereum Whales Accumulate Even More\n\nIn the context of a generalized decline of more than 5% over the last 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH) has undergone a significant correction. Rather than succumbing to panic, investors demonstrate impressive resilience by capitalizing on the lower prices.\n\nAccording to data from Lookonchain, an astute whale just transferred 55 million USDT to Binance, signaling a clear intention to buy more $ETH during this slowdown period.\n\nThis strategic move is not isolated, as the same whale, originally a fan of swing trading on ETH, had sold a significant amount of tokens in November. After a one-month hiatus, this smart whale is returning to the market, suggesting a long-term vision and renewed confidence in Ethereum\u2019s upward trajectory.\n\nThese deliberate actions by institutional investors indicate a careful analysis of the market and optimism about Ethereum\u2019s recovery capacity.\n\nA Temporary Correction That Does Not Undermine Fundamentals\n\nIn another positive note, DWF Labs, a major player in the crypto market, recently revealed its largest ETH accumulation over the past two months.\n\nIn a clear tactical move, DWF Labs transferred no less than 280 ETH ($626,000) from the Bitfinex platform, just a few hours ago, revealing its solid commitment to a long-term holding strategy for the Ethereum token.\n\nThis strategic accumulation emphasizes the continued confidence of major market players in the long-term stability of Ethereum, even during periods of temporary correction.\n\nIn the meantime, several analyses predict that Ethereum, at its current price, remains undervalued relative to its solid fundamentals and the current trend on the crypto market, largely dominated by Bitcoin.\n\nIn conclusion, these positive elements, however, should not make us forget the inherent risks of cryptocurrencies. As the well-known saying goes: \u201cNever invest more than you are willing to lose\u201d.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "In the thrilling world of cryptocurrencies, the spotlight is currently on Ethereum (ETH) as it approaches a critical price level, while Hedera (HBAR) and the new memecoin on the block, Rebel Satoshi (RBLZ), are creating a buzz among investors. This trio of digital assets is demonstrating why they\u2019re considered top cryptos to buy, with Ethereum and Hedera making significant moves in the blockchain space and Rebel Satoshi emerging as a hot new memecoin.\n\nEthereum\u2019s (ETH) Pivotal Moment\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is currently at a make-or-break point. The crypto giant is nearing critical Fibonacci (Fib) levels between $2,400 and $2,600, a phase that could define its market trajectory in the near term. ETH has already impressively surpassed its previous high of around $2,140 and is now eyeing the next Fib levels. However, it could face some bearish resistance, leading to a possible corrective phase before any further upward movement.\n\nThe Ethereum market is buzzing with anticipation. If ETH starts to outperform Bitcoin (BTC), we might see its price shooting up to the $3,400 mark. A lot of this depends on the ETH/BTC pair dynamics, which investors are watching like hawks. The recent bullish signs in Ethereum\u2019s monthly MACD histogram and its neutral RSI are fueling this optimism, making Ethereum a top crypto to buy for those eyeing potential significant gains.\n\nHedera (HBAR): The New Blockchain Champion\n\nHedera (HBAR) is quietly but powerfully making its mark in the crypto universe. Known for its Hashgraph consensus mechanism, Hedera boasts transaction finality in just 3.43 seconds and an average transaction cost of a mere $0.0001. These impressive stats make it one of the fastest and most cost-effective blockchains around, setting it up for potential mass adoption.\n\nHedera\u2019s focus on servicing institutions and companies in the stablecoin and micropayment solution sectors could be a game-changer. This strategic decision is particularly savvy, given the increasing popularity of stablecoins. With over 30 billion network transactions under its belt, Hedera is proving that its strategy is more than just talk. The recent announcement of its partnership with Empowa Pay in Africa further solidifies Hedera\u2019s status as a top altcoin to buy and a formidable force in the crypto space.\n\nRebel Satoshi (RBLZ): The Memecoin Causing a Stir\n\nOn the memecoin front, Rebel Satoshi (RBLZ) is stirring up a frenzy among investors. Drawing inspiration from the legendary Satoshi Nakamoto and the historical figure Guy Fawkes, Rebel Satoshi is not just another memecoin; it\u2019s a movement with a mission.\n\nInnovative Tokenomics and Community Driven\n\nRebel Satoshi\u2019s deflationary token model, which includes a token burning mechanism, is designed to gradually reduce its supply, thereby potentially increasing its value over time. This strategic approach is positioning Rebel Satoshi as a smart investment choice, emerging as one of the best memecoins to buy.\n\nWhat sets Rebel Satoshi apart is its focus on community engagement and empowerment. Holding RBLZ tokens gives investors a say in the platform\u2019s future, creating a sense of ownership and involvement. This aspect is a big draw for those looking for altcoins to buy that offer more than financial returns.\n\nA Diverse Ecosystem: Beyond Just a Meme\n\nRebel Satoshi\u2019s ecosystem is rich and diverse, featuring a staking program and an NFT marketplace, providing both financial opportunities and creative outlets. This multifaceted approach contributes to its appeal as a top crypto to buy.\n\nThe ongoing presale of Rebel Satoshi is generating significant excitement in the crypto community. This presale phase offers investors an early entry into a promising new memecoin, setting the stage for potential high returns as the project gains traction and recognition.\n\nConclusion: A Crypto Landscape Full of Opportunities\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum\u2019s critical price level, Hedera\u2019s innovative blockchain solutions, and Rebel Satoshi\u2019s memecoin buzz create a fascinating landscape for crypto enthusiasts and investors. Each of these platforms, in its unique way, contributes to the broader narrative of digital currencies and blockchain technology.\n\nFor those looking to diversify their crypto portfolio or explore new, promising digital assets, Ethereum, Hedera, and Rebel Satoshi present themselves as compelling options. Their unique features, combined with their potential for growth and innovation, make them some of the top cryptos to buy.\n\nThe world of cryptocurrencies is continuously evolving, and platforms like Ethereum, Hedera, and Rebel Satoshi are at the forefront of this change, offering exciting opportunities and paving the way for the next generation\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored story.

        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has disclosed a postponement in its decision regarding Grayscale\u2019s proposed Ethereum (ETH) spot ETF. The SEC cites the necessity for additional time to evaluate a proposed rule change enabling NYSE Arca to list and trade shares associated with the Grayscale Ethereum Trust. Meanwhile, a surge of excitement within the Reddit community surrounds an emerging AI altcoin, InQubeta (QUBE), heightening interest in the intersection of artificial intelligence and the crypto market.\n\nInQubeta attracts the market with its unique ecosystem that mints opportunities into NFTs. The NFT marketplace has been the center of attraction, propelling it as the best crypto to buy for significant gain. Analysts predict that QUBE holds the potential to multiply investors\u2019 portfolios by ten times by the year 2024.\n\nLet\u2019s explore why the Reddit buzz around InQubeta is intensifying amid Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum ETF hopes being delayed.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE): Igniting the Crypto Space with an Innovative AI Crowdfunding Platform.\n\nInQubeta, a new DeFi crypto, is gaining momentum as it introduces a groundbreaking crypto crowdfunding platform. The Reddit buzz surrounding this emerging AI altcoin has intensified as investors learn more about its offerings. The platform facilitates fractional investments in AI startups using QUBE tokens, a deflationary ERC20 token. The innovative investment protocol involving NFT minting and fractionalization has fueled the hype surrounding the QUBE platform. Through this approach, investors can invest in a way that suits their budget, all while enjoying the benefits of being an early backer.\n\nThe InQubeta NFT marketplace enables AI startups to raise funds through reward and equity-based NFTs. Also, QUBE token holders can seamlessly invest in projects, fostering a symbiotic ecosystem. The deflationary mechanism of InQubeta has further intensified the Reddit excitement surrounding the QUBE token. With a 2% buy and sell tax directed to a burning wallet and a 5% tax contributing to a dedicated reward pool, QUBE holders can stake their tokens, earning rewards and positioning QUBE as the best crypto to buy for those eyeing the potential growth of AI tech startups.\n\nThe governance role of this new DeFi crypto is another feature that is growing Reddit interest in the QUBE token. It empowers holders to engage actively in platform decisions, fostering a democratic approach to development, operations, and future directions. With a surge in demand anticipated due to expanding participation from investors and startups, the value of QUBE is poised to rise. Investors can capitalize on potential price appreciation and earn rewards from the dedicated pool by holding and staking QUBE tokens.\n\nAs the presale progresses through stage six, influential crypto figures have shown keen interest in the QUBE token. With over 626 million tokens already sold at the presale price of $0.01925, the heightened buzz around QUBE continues to grow. This best crypto investment platform has already raised over $6.6 million in presale funding.\n\nSEC Postpones Decision on Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum (ETH) ETF: Evaluation Extended Until 2024.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s Ethereum ETF hopes have been delayed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which declared a postponement in its decision-making process. This extension involves the SEC allocating a prolonged period for evaluating the proposed rule change, with January 25, 2024, designated as the deadline for either its decision or the initiation of proceedings to determine disapproval.\n\nEmphasizing the need for sufficient time to thoroughly assess the Ethereum spot ETF proposal and address concerns raised, the SEC aims for a comprehensive evaluation. Despite previous approvals of investment vehicles tied to crypto futures, the SEC has yet to greenlight a spot Bitcoin (BTC) or ETH ETF on a U.S. exchange. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart speculates that approval of a spot BTC ETF might open the door for simultaneous approvals of funds from multiple firms, potentially reshaping the landscape.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe InQubeta Reddit buzz continues to escalate amidst the delay on Grayscale\u2019s ETH ETF. InQubeta\u2019s NFT marketplace and deflationary mechanism set it at the forefront of AI technology innovation. This best crypto investment platform has been a hub of attention during its presale. Investors who want to participate in this AI revolution can purchase the QUBE token via the website using crypto coins like ETH, BTC, or USDT.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities"

Discover SCENE\n\nUbisoft has announced the Ethereum NFT mint date for its first original blockchain game, Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles, sharing that its \u201cWarlords\u201d will be available on December 18.\n\nChampions Tactics will offer a private mint for those added to its \u201cdarklist\u201d beginning at 6am ET, and will open the mint up to the general public at 2pm ET on Monday.\n\nAn NFT mint is effectively the primary sale for a project\u2014but unlike most NFT launches, Ubisoft is promising that 8,000 Champions Tactics Warlord NFTs will be free to mint.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the game, Warlords are pixel-style heroes with weapons and have been designed like social media profile picture (PFP) NFTs. Collectors will only need to pay Ethereum network gas fees to mint the NFTs, which can then be used as one\u2019s account avatar in-game.\n\nAccording to Ubisoft, holding a Warlord NFT in a crypto wallet will grant access to the game\u2019s next mint for its playable in-game characters. Warlord NFT owners will be able to mint five Champions Tactics characters for free at a later, yet-to-be-announced date.\n\nWhile the Warlords NFTs will be on Ethereum, the Champions Tactics game itself will be deployed on the Ethereum-compatible Oasys chain. A total of 9,999 Warlords NFTs will be minted, with another 1,000 given out to the Oasys community and 999 held back by Ubisoft for future marketing initiatives and giveaways.\n\nNot much has been revealed about Champions Tactics\u2019 strategy and gameplay, but some lore details have been revealed. In the world of Grimoria, there are seven different factions ruled by battle-hungry warlords. Each faction has its own look, as there are zombie-like characters, demonic characters, and medieval knights, to name a few.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Warlords\ud83d\udc51, a collection of 9,999 digital collectibles for Champions Tactics by @Ubisoft \u2666 Timeless badass pixel art on Ethereum\n\n\u2666 Exclusive in-game perks\n\n\u2666 Access to the upcoming Champions mint\n\n\u2666 VVIP status\n\n\u2666 And more\ud83e\udd10 Follow, Like, RT & Comment if you are ready \ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/hxbUSitfjZ \u2014 Champions Tactics (@ChampionsVerse) December 6, 2023\n\nThe player-versus-player tactical RPG has a dark fantasy aesthetic and will offer characters that resemble collectible tabletop game figurines. First announced in June 2023, Champions Tactics is slated to release on PC sometime in early 2024.\n\nUbisoft has also confirmed \"collaborations\" with the NFT gaming projects Pixelmon and CyberKongz in recent days, though the extent of each alliance is unclear.\n\nIn each case, the project tweeted that it would be \"supporting Champions Tactics with its upcoming Warlords mint and launch\" and exploring further opportunities together. Ubisoft's official game account quote-tweeted and shared both announcement tweets.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

This automated approach aims to mitigate potential insecurities arising from the conventional manual circuit definition process adopted by other platforms.\n\nThe zkLLVM rapidly compiles high-level code in languages such as C++ or Rust into efficient zk-SNARK circuits, eliminating the need for time-consuming manual circuit definition and minimizing the risk of human error.\n\nAccording to Misha Komarov, CEO and co-founder of =nil; Foundation, the zkEVM is aims to revolutionize Ethereum\u2019s scalability by directly addressing security and compatibility concerns that have impeded the migration of liquidity to zkRollups.\n\nThe Type-1 zkEVM, compiled through zkLLVM, enhances auditability, streamlines circuit implementation, and reduces the potential for security vulnerabilities.\n\nKey properties of =nil;\u2019s zkEVM include improved auditability, as its automated compilation from mainstream programming languages makes it more accessible and cost-effective for auditing processes. The zkEVM is also touted as highly adaptable to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) changes, ensuring it remains a future-proof scaling solution.\n\nUnlike existing platforms relying on manual circuits, =nil;\u2019s zkEVM accommodates changes in parameters, simplifying and expediting the integration of new Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs).\n\nMoreover, =nil;\u2019s zkEVM stands out for its Type-1 bytecode compatibility, closely aligning with evmone, a C++ version of Ethereum\u2019s base execution environment.\n\nThis compatibility ensures better security and quicker implementation, eliminating the need for auditing different bytecode implementations. In contrast, other zkEVMs with less compatibility require substantial efforts to replicate exact EVM behavior.\n\nThis newly introduced zkEVM powers =nil;\u2019s zkRollup, aiming to scale Ethereum to over 60,000 transactions per second through zkSharding, enabling developers to construct composable applications with transparent access to Ethereum data."

In this section, we will delve into how Bitcoin indirectly contributes to the surge in NFT sales and the unique synergy between these two digital assets.\n\nBitcoin as a Store of Value\n\n1. Bitcoin\u2019s Role:\n\nBitcoin\u2019s primary function as a store of value, often referred to as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d indirectly affects NFT sales in several ways:\n\nInvestment Capital: Many individuals and institutions invest in Bitcoin as a long-term store of value or a hedge against economic uncertainties.

Some of these profits find their way into NFT acquisitions and investments.\n\n2. Investor Confidence:\n\nStability and Growth: Bitcoin\u2019s stability and consistent long-term growth have instilled confidence in cryptocurrency investments.

        "title": "Why Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL)'s Big Fish are Making Waves in Everlodge (ELDG)'s $82B Ocean - Atalayar EN",
        "content": "The crypto big fish are heavily positioned in Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) as they go head-to-head to become the top smart contract platform. But with Everlodge transforming a $82b market, holders of the two assets are moving to the potentially better investment, especially with the ELDG price surging by 170% during the presale event. Let's look at this new entrant and its impact on the market.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG): Digitizing the Global Vacation Rental Market for Huge Returns\n\nEverlodge uses NFTs and blockchain technology to offer fractional ownership of holiday residences. This provides investors with the opportunity to earn passive income and capital gains by owning a piece of property in popular tourist destinations.\n\nWith the global vacation rental market estimated to be worth 82.63 billion in 2022, Everlodge has a huge market to tap into. It's easy to see why some of Ethereum and Solana's earliest investors are now shifting their focus to this new project.\n\nEverlodge is creating a whole ecosystem of features to support the innovative model, and one of the most exciting is the Rewards Club. This exclusive club offers free stays at Everlodge's extensive properties similar to timeshares. Members receive a certain number of free nights each year that can be used or traded on the marketplace.\n\nWe're thrilled to announce that our website just got a makeover! \ud83d\udcbb\n\n\n\nCheck out the fresh look and discover the NEW features we've added. It's all about making your experience even better!\n\n\n\nPlus, remember that our Presale is still ON.\n\n\n\nExplore now: https://t.co/SIYWBylwQD#RWA pic.twitter.com/aTuT8x7z36 \u2014 Everlodge (@EverlodgeHQ) October 23, 2023\n\nThe ELDG sits at the center of the ecosystem by facilitating transactions for booking stays and trading properties on the platform. The token also serves as a governance token, as well as offering passive income returns and discounts to those who stake the token. Such utility makes ELDG a valuable asset to hold for long-term investors.\n\nELDG tokens are available for purchase at $0.027 in the eighth presale phase after a 170% surge since the event started. The price increases with the start of each phase, so early investors have a higher chance of making significant gains.\n\nExperts predict that ELDG will experience a staggering 30-fold surge on launch day. This forecast is based on the current presale momentum, the size of the $82B global vacation property market, and the innovative features of Everlodge.\n\nFor more information about the ongoing Everlodge (ELDG) Presale, please visit their website.\n\nCatalysts for Ethereum (ETH)'s Growth\n\nHundreds of competitors have challenged Ethereum, but it remains the undisputed king of smart contract technology in terms of market cap ($270b) and TVL ($28.50b). The developer community is vast, and the platform has become a go-to for building decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nHowever, Ethereum has been outperformed by Bitcoin this year as the latter looks ready to be accepted into the mainstream. The chart shows Ethereum was priced at 0.077 BTC on January 1st but now is trading at a mere 0.0563 BTC \u2014 the lowest price since July 2022.\n\nHowever, it's not all bad news for Ethereum holders. Blackrock and other institutional players have applied for spot Ethereum ETFs to be accepted by the SEC. This could catalyze ETH to break its all-time high and start a new bull run. There is also the upcoming EIP-4844 update, which introduces danksharding for improved scalability and lower gas fees.\n\nStill, many Ethereum holders are switching to newer projects with a higher reward potential. Breaking the $2,500 resistance could result in a fresh bull run toward the $10,000 level, but a 4x return is not exciting to all investors. With Everlodge predicted to surge by 100x when it hits exchanges, some see it as a more promising investment opportunity.\n\nSolana (SOL) Price Prediction 2024\n\nSolana is on Ethereum's tail as the #1 platform for developers to build decentralized applications and protocols. This is evidenced by 50% more people viewing the SolDev developer courses than just two months ago. Additionally, Solana recently surpassed 50 million daily transactions, with over $200b moved on-chain during November.\n\nSolana holders believe it may become the top layer-one platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Its super-fast transaction speeds that don't rely on layer-2 infrastructure make Solana an obvious choice for developers looking to build scalable and efficient decentralized applications.\n\nBut just how much further can the price of Solana go? The SOL token was valued at just $8 in January but peaked at $77 this month. A 10x increase from the current price of $69.40 would represent a Solana market cap of $290 billion.\n\nWhile such a high market cap is possible if Solana can secure billions in TVL and actually rival Ethereum as the go-to platform for DeFi and NFTs, it is far from guaranteed. Some Solana whales are taking profits from the 862% rally and jumping into the Everlodge presale to ride another wave of growth potentially."

Expert analysts weigh in their takes on the ETH surge, and Bluntz, a pseudonymous analyst, has shared with his followers on X that Ethereum has entered the bull phase, having broken out its year-and-a-half range.\n\nEthereum is predicted to explode with an inevitable rage with its over 92% increase in the past year. The token is taking center stage as BTC slows its bullish trend, causing more investors to acknowledge the number two crypto token. This could be the start of the altcoin season, and ETH investors are eagerly looking forward to and anticipating a positive outcome.\n\nSolana (SOL): Surging With Renewed Enthusiasm On The DeFi Crypto List\n\nSolana has been on the rise in the past few months, with its native token, SOL, surging exceptionally and its ecosystem benefiting from this uptrend.

Solana is outperforming Ethereum in terms of sheer market volume regarding daily transactions.\n\nStep Data Insights analyzed this data, noting that the daily active wallets on Solana surpass 400,000. This indicates an increase in the users flocking to Solana\u2019s ecosystem to leverage its DeFi and NFT offerings, among other protocols. SOL maintains an uptrend as investor confidence grows, pushing the token past 210% in the past three months.\n\nConclusion\n\nInvestors are thrilled at the signs of the altcoin season as the top-performing tokens on the decentralized cryptocurrency list, Ethereum and Solana, continue to surge, chasing Bitcoin\u2019s rally. These projects are on the cusp of success, and the bullish market continues to rage despite volatility. NuggetRush is on a roll, leading the way with its resounding presale success.

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum Classic price breaching $22 would mark a bullish signal for the altcoin, which could push it towards marking fresh year-to-date highs.\n\nThe Ethereum Classic network is set to undergo the \u2018Spiral\u2019 upgrade, a hard fork that will set it at par with Ethereum Shanghai changes.\n\nScheduled for the end of January 2024, ETC will likely witness a bullish momentum by then.\n\nEthereum Classic price took a hit this week, along with the rest of the market, nearly falling by 17.4% in a day. However, as the altcoin recovered slightly, it lost the bullish momentum that had been building up in the week before. This momentum will likely revive in the next year.\n\nEthereum Classic to undergo major upgrade\n\nEthereum Classic network is scheduled for a hard fork on January 31, 2024. The upgrade titled \u2018Spiral\u2019 will be activated at block 19,250,000. This upgrade will be a compatibility upgrade for the Ethereum hard fork chain, which will bring it in line with the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nIn order to be an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible chain, the blockchain would need to meet the EVM standards. Thus, the Spiral Upgrade will bring the ETC Network to parity with upstream EVM standards, facilitating contract development and migration.\n\nThis upgrade will most likely act as a catalyst since, for the large part, the market would already be experiencing bullishness thanks to the broader market cues.\n\nEthereum Classic price rise revival\n\nEthereum Classic price, trading at $19.94 at the time of writing, was down by 2% over the past day, adding to the 8% decline observed this week. While ETC has lost nearly half the gains it noted towards October end, it is yet to witness a bearish momentum in full swing.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still hovering above the neutral line marked at 50.0, and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator has only just marked the bearish crossover. But the chances of a rally will only arrive after ETC has first declined to $19.1.\n\nOnly after bouncing back from this line can the Ethereum Classic price note some recovery, but if the bearish cues heavily weigh the price down, the altcoin could fall to $18.2.\n\nETC/USD 1-day chart\n\nHowever, if broader market cues and investors act bullish to prevent a price decline before the new year begins, ETC might have a shot at early recovery. Breaching the $20.9 resistance level would confirm the same and invalidate the bearish thesis, pushing the Ethereum hard fork toward $22.4."

        "title": "Ethereum dips to crucial demand zone, analysts predict ETH price rally to $3,000 - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price dropped close to the $2,100 level early on Wednesday, entering a crucial demand zone.\n\nOver 5.58 million wallet addresses hold nearly 40 million Ethereum tokens in the demand zone.\n\nAnalysts have predicted an ETH price rally to $3,000 since Ethereum\u2019s breakout past the $2,000 level.\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, declined to $2,148 early on Wednesday. The fall in prices follows a broader sell-off in the crypto market since Monday, likely driven by investors\u2019 de-risking strategy ahead of a macro-packed week, with US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for November and the US Federal Reserve (Fed) last meeting of the year.\n\nEthereum price has entered a critical demand zone, according to on-chain metrics, in which market catalysts could help determine where ETH is headed next.\n\nAlso read: XRP price drop to $0.55 likely amidst Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s final push in US crypto legislation\n\nEthereum price reaches demand zone\n\nBased on data from crypto intelligence tracker IntoTheBlock, Ethereum price has dipped into a demand zone considered crucial for the altcoin. The price range between $1,934 and $2,160 is key for Ethereum price as this is a range where 5.58 million wallet addresses accumulated nearly 40 million ETH tokens.\n\nThis makes the demand zone a critical support for ETH. According to Ali Martinez, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), this makes it an ideal reloading point for traders looking to add more Ethereum to their portfolio before the altcoin\u2019s price rallies.\n\nGlobal In/Out of the Money ETH. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nEthereum price eyes $3,000 target\n\nSeveral crypto analysts on X said Ethereum is primed for a rally. Since ETH price tested and broke out of the psychological barrier at $2,000, these analysts say the altcoin is ready to target the $3,000 level.\n\nCrypto analyst behind the X handle @CryptoJelleNL argues ETH is ready to rally to $3,000 in the ongoing cycle.\n\nETH/USDT 1-week chart. Source: @CryptoJelleNL.\n\nAnother crypto analyst, Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa), agrees with @CryptoJelleNL\u2019s thesis and notes that Ethereum is likely \u201cone of the easiest trades.\u201d Sherpa notes that after ETH consolidated under the $2,000 level for nearly two years, the altcoin is finally out of the range and ready to catch up to the $3,000 mark in the coming months.\n\n$ETH: I still think that #Ethereum is 1 of the easiest trades you can take. It consolidated under the 2kish mark for almost 2 years and finally out of that range.\n\n\n\nThis is going to catch up for sure and I think that ETHUSD goes to $3k in the coming months. pic.twitter.com/ddX8l2s5Ux \u2014 Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) December 12, 2023\n\nIn its predicted run up to the $3,000 mark, Ethereum price is likely to face resistance in the range between $2,160 and $2,247, where 1.04 million wallet addresses bought 5.49 million ETH tokens, according to IntoTheBlock data. A break past $2,247 is key to validating the bullish thesis for ETH.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum price is $2,171.38 on Binance. The altcoin is trading sideways close to the $2,100 level, after yielding nearly 5% weekly losses for holders."

        "title": "Ethereum Price History: Key Events and Their Effects - The Tribune India",
        "content": "Understanding how the Ethereum price has changed can be confusing. This digital currency started at just $0.42 in 2015 and soared to astonishing heights over the years. Our blog will guide you through Ethereum's journey, examining key events that caused its dramatic price shifts.\n\nGet ready for a thrilling ride into the world of Ethereum!\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nEthereum started at $0.42 in 2015 and reached a high of $4,780.73 in 2021, showing huge growth.\n\nEvents like the DAO hack in 2016 and the start of Ethereum 2.0 affected its price a lot.\n\nThe adoption of Ethereum by more people and businesses has helped its price go up over time.\n\nOther digital currencies are competition for Ethereum and can change its price too.\n\nTechnology upgrades to the Ethereum system have also played a big part in how much it's worth.\n\nEthereum Price History\n\nIn the last few years, Ethereum has experienced significant price fluctuations, starting from a low of $0.42 in 2015 to reaching an all-time high of $4,780.73 in 2021. These fluctuations have been influenced by various key events and factors that have shaped the cryptocurrency's price history.\n\n2015: Starting Price of $0.42 and reaching $1.39\n\nEthereum began its journey in 2015 at a modest price of $0.42. This was a time when the idea of using blockchain for more than just digital currency was new. As people learned about Ethereum's potential beyond Bitcoin, excitement grew.\n\nQuickly, this interest pushed the price up to $1.39 by the end of the year.\n\nMany saw Ethereum as an innovation in blockchain technology that could lead to many other uses. These early days were vital because they set the stage for Ethereum's future growth and effect on the cryptocurrency market.\n\nEven with such small numbers compared to later prices, these shifts were key moments in crypto trading history.\n\n2016: First hard fork and price hitting $21.25\n\nFollowing the price range from $0.42 to $1.39 in 2015, Ethereum encountered a significant milestone in 2016 with its first hard fork and a consequent surge in price, reaching $21.25.\n\nThis event marked a crucial moment for Ethereum\u2019s technological development and its impact on market valuation.\n\nThe hard fork, executed to reverse the loss of funds due to the DAO hack, stirred considerable attention within the cryptocurrency community and signaled Ethereum's responsiveness to challenges.\n\n2017: Becoming mainstream and reaching $881.94\n\nFollowing the first hard fork and Ethereum's price hitting $21.25, 2017 marked a significant turning point for Ethereum as it began to gain mainstream attention and adoption. This surge in popularity drove its price to reach a remarkable high of $881.94, reflecting the growing confidence in Ethereum\u2019s potential and its increasing use across various sectors such as finance, technology, and even governance.\n\nThe demand for decentralized applications built on the Ethereum platform contributed to this surge in value, cementing Ethereum's position as one of the leading cryptocurrencies at that time.\n\nThe increased utilization of smart contracts and the expansion of the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) market further propelled its growth during this period.\n\n2018: Breaking $1k barrier with a price of $1,119.37\n\nEthereum made a significant leap in 2018, surpassing the $1k mark with a price of $1,119.37. This milestone marked a substantial increase from its earlier values and showcased the growing interest and investment in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe surge reflected the escalating demand for Ethereum and indicated a turning point in its value trajectory amidst evolving digital currency trends.\n\nThe breakthrough of Ethereum crossing the $1k barrier to reach $1,119.37 highlighted its increasing prominence within the cryptocurrency landscape, underlining shifts in investor sentiment, and signaling heightened potential for digital assets' market valuations.\n\n2019: Uneventful year with prices ranging from $102.93 to $361.40\n\nIn 2019, Ethereum experienced a relatively stable year with prices fluctuating between $102.93 and $361.40. This period lacked significant market-shifting events or major price surges, leading to a sense of stability compared to the volatility of previous years.\n\nThe range showcased a tempered market, lacking extreme fluctuations that had characterized earlier years.\n\nMarket analysis during this time indicated a period of consolidation and relative calm in Ethereum's price movements, setting the stage for developments and potential shifts in the coming years, as the cryptocurrency continued to establish its position within the digital asset market.\n\n2020: The effects of the coronavirus with a price range of $95.18 to $533.00\n\nThe year 2020 brought significant challenges to Ethereum, with the outbreak of the coronavirus leading to a wide price range between $95.18 and $533.00. The pandemic-induced market volatility had a pronounced impact on cryptocurrency prices, including Ethereum, as investor sentiment fluctuated in response to global economic uncertainty and rapidly changing circumstances.\n\nThe effects of the coronavirus underscored the susceptibility of digital currencies to external factors beyond traditional market forces. The resulting price range from $95.18 to $533.00 reflected this heightened volatility and demonstrated the interconnectedness of global events with cryptocurrency markets, highlighting the need for resilience and adaptability in this evolving financial landscape.\n\n2021: Epic bull run with a high of $4,780.73\n\nIn 2021, Ethereum experienced a remarkable surge in its value, reaching an all-time high of $4,780.73. This unprecedented bull run captivated the cryptocurrency market and solidified Ethereum's position as a leading digital asset.\n\nThe substantial price increase was fueled by growing institutional interest, decentralized finance (DeFi) developments, and increased adoption across various industries.\n\nEthereum's extraordinary performance in 2021 reflected the increasing confidence in blockchain technology and decentralized applications like smart contracts and NFTs. This significant milestone marked a pivotal moment for Ethereum and highlighted its potential to revolutionize traditional financial systems while shaping the future of digital currencies.\n\nKey Moments in Ethereum Price History\n\nThe beginning of Ethereum in 2013, The DAO hack in 2016, the bull run of 2017 and challenges and price fluctuations from 2018 to the present have all shaped Ethereum's price history.\n\nTo delve deeper into these key moments and their effects on Ethereum prices, keep reading!\n\nThe beginning of Ethereum in 2013\n\nEthereum, a decentralized platform that enables smart contracts and Distributed Applications (DApps) to be built and operated without any downtime or fraud was proposed by Vitalik Buterin in late 2013.\n\nEthereum's development was crowdfunded in August 2014, with the system going live on July 30, 2015. This event marked a significant milestone in the history of digital currencies as it introduced new capabilities and potential use cases beyond Bitcoin's peer-to-peer electronic cash system.\n\nThe DAO hack in 2016\n\nIn 2016, a significant event shook the Ethereum community: the DAO hack. This incident led to the theft of around $50 million worth of Ether, causing a major crisis and leading to a contentious hard fork that resulted in two separate blockchains \u2013 Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).\n\nThe impact of this hack was felt throughout the cryptocurrency market, raising concerns about security and leading to price fluctuations as investor confidence wavered.\n\nMoving forward from the DAO hack in 2016, the bull run of 2017 brought renewed optimism and increased interest in Ethereum as its price surged significantly.\n\nThe bull run of 2017\n\nIn 2017, Ethereum experienced a remarkable bull run, with its price soaring to an all-time high of $881.94. This surge was largely fueled by the growing popularity of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Ethereum platform, propelling investor demand and optimism in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe surge also reflected a broader trend in the digital asset market as a whole, with Bitcoin reaching new record highs and garnering significant mainstream attention.\n\nThe extraordinary rise in Ethereum's value during this period can be attributed to increased adoption and recognition of its underlying technology within both crypto circles and traditional financial sectors, marking a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry.\n\nChallenges and price fluctuations from 2018 to the present\n\nFollowing the epic bull run of 2017, Ethereum encountered various challenges and price fluctuations from 2018 to the present. The cryptocurrency market witnessed heightened volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and scalability concerns.\n\nAdditionally, intense competition from emerging cryptocurrencies also impacted Ethereum's price movements. These factors led to significant price oscillations, creating a rollercoaster effect on Ethereum's value in the digital currency market.\n\nThe fluctuating prices were further influenced by technological upgrades and developments within the decentralized finance sector, impacting investor sentiment and demand for Ethereum.\n\nFactors Influencing Ethereum Prices\n\nAdoption and mainstream use, investor sentiment and demand, competition from other cryptocurrencies, and technological developments and upgrades all play significant roles in influencing Ethereum prices.\n\nUnderstanding these factors can provide insights into the cryptocurrency market trends and help investors make informed decisions.\n\nAdoption and mainstream use\n\nEthereum's price history has been significantly influenced by its adoption and mainstream use. As more people and businesses began using Ethereum for transactions, the demand for the cryptocurrency increased, resulting in price surges.\n\nThe integration of Ethereum into various industries and the growing acceptance of it as a method of payment have also contributed to its increased mainstream use, further impacting its price movements.\n\nThe widespread adoption of Ethereum within decentralized finance (DeFi) applications has played a crucial role in driving its prices, reflecting how its real-world utility affects market trends.\n\nInvestor sentiment and demand\n\nInvestor sentiment and demand greatly impact Ethereum's price. When investors feel optimistic about the future of Ethereum, they tend to buy more, increasing demand and driving prices up.\n\nOn the other hand, if they become cautious or uncertain, they may sell their holdings, causing a decrease in demand and a drop in prices. These fluctuations in investor sentiment can lead to significant price movements for Ethereum as well as other cryptocurrencies, impacting the overall market trends and digital asset market developments.\n\nCompetition from other cryptocurrencies\n\nAs we consider the influence of other cryptocurrencies, it's important to recognize that Ethereum faces competition from various digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ripple, and Litecoin.\n\nEach cryptocurrency offers unique features and use cases that can impact Ethereum's market share and price. Investors closely monitor developments in these competing cryptocurrencies as they weigh their investment options within the digital asset market trends.\n\nIn the decentralized finance market, a crucial factor affecting Ethereum prices is its ability to stand out amidst the growing number of alternative blockchain projects striving for similar goals.\n\nTechnological developments and upgrades\n\nEthereum's price history has been influenced by technological advancements and upgrades. The implementation of Ethereum 2.0, which includes the shift from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, has been a significant development impacting the price.\n\nAdditionally, upgrades like EIP-1559 have aimed to address issues with transaction fees and supply dynamics, directly affecting Ethereum's market trends and historical price movements.\n\nThese technological developments and upgrades continue to play a pivotal role in shaping Ethereum's future price trajectory and market dynamics. The evolution of these technologies will likely remain an essential factor in analyzing Ethereum's historical data and predicting its future price fluctuations.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, Ethereum's price history reflects significant milestones and events that have shaped its value over the years. From humble beginnings in 2015 to the epic bull run of 2021, Ethereum has experienced dramatic price fluctuations influenced by key moments like the DAO hack and technological developments.\n\nFactors such as mainstream adoption, investor sentiment, and competition from other cryptocurrencies continue to impact Ethereum's price trajectory, making it a dynamic asset in the digital currency landscape.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is part of sponsored content programme.

        "title": "Solana's Ambitious $2,000 Price Target Could Flip Ethereum and Bitcoin - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The crypto market has experienced exciting new developments that have excited investors and traders alike. Key market movers, Bitcoin and Ethereum, have gained about 127% and 70%, respectively, since the start of 2023. However, Solana has made quite an impression, surging over 500% in value, and is currently traded at around $70.\n\nSolana is showing no signs of slowing down as it makes an ambitious move to reach $2,000 in the coming bull run. This will likely excite SOL holders and potentially challenge the crypto giants, Bitcoin and Ethereum. Today\u2019s post will discuss more on Solana\u2019s ambitious price target and how certain new coins, such as Bitcoin ETF token, Bitcoin Minetrix, and others, are poised to revolutionize the crypto market in the coming year. Without further ado, let\u2019s dive in!\n\n>>>Buy the Best Presale Token Now<<<\n\nBitcoin ETF Token: A Revolutionary Crypto Project Tied to Upcoming Bitcoin ETF Approvals\n\nBitcoin ETF token positions itself as a gateway for investors eager to tap into the anticipated spot Bitcoin ETFs. This crypto project incorporates a deflationary mechanism tied to the progress of upcoming spot approvals. At specific milestones, portions of its native token, BTCETF, will be burned, potentially driving its value higher.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin ETF Now<<<\n\nThe project\u2019s roadmap outlines five pivotal milestones, which include:\n\n$100 million in BTCETF trading volume\n\nFirst spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the US\n\nFirst US spot Bitcoin ETF launch\n\n$1 billion in assets under management across Bitcoin ETFs\n\nBitcoin price to reach $100,000\n\nEach milestone triggers a 5% burn, totaling a 25% reduction in the token supply over time, thus boosting the project\u2019s inherent value. BTCETF also introduces a staking system, encouraging users to deposit tokens to enjoy passive earnings of up to 78% APY (Annual Percentage Yield).\n\nNotably, its ongoing presale has created a buzz in the crypto community. With 40% of the total supply allocated to the presale, early investors stand to gain substantial rewards. The presale has gained momentum, which has resulted in over $3.5 million raised so far. It also adopts a tier-based approach, featuring ten stages with progressively higher token prices. Do well to check out this project as soon as possible to enjoy impressive gains during the upcoming bull run.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin ETF Now<<<\n\nBitcoin Minetrix: A World-Class Bitcoin Mining Platform\n\nBitcoin mining has posed barriers to entry for many due to the need for specialized hardware and high power consumption. However, Bitcoin Minetrix aims to change the narrative by providing a cloud-based mining solution, thus allowing anyone to participate using their personal computers or mobile devices.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin Minetrix Now<<<\n\nThe stake-to-mine system introduced by Bitcoin Minetrix involves staking its native token, BTCMTX, to earn mining credits. These credits can be burned to acquire cloud mining power, allowing you to mine Bitcoin effortlessly. You can monitor your mining activity and verify rewards on the blockchain through the platform\u2019s dashboard without intermediaries.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix further distinguishes itself by incorporating a decentralized staking system, allowing you to enjoy passive APY rewards of over 100%. The success of Bitcoin Minetrix is evident in its presale, surpassing $5 million in funding. It underscores the platform\u2019s potential to revolutionize the cloud mining industry, making Bitcoin mining accessible to everyone.\n\nIts ongoing presale offers BTCMTX tokens at $0.0121 per token, presenting a strategic opportunity for investors considering potential price appreciation upon listing. With the upcoming bull run in view, Bitcoin Minetrix invites you to participate in the cloud mining revolutionization by engaging in its presale early on to enjoy premium gains in the coming year.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin Minetrix Now<<<\n\nGreen Bitcoin: A Rewarding Bitcoin Predictive Platform\n\nGreen Bitcoin is a premier crypto project that pioneers a Bitcoin price prediction reward system. By staking Green Bitcoin\u2019s native token, GBTC, participants can predict Bitcoin\u2019s price, and accurate predictions are met with enticing rewards. Though the game is yet to go live, you can secure GBTC tokens at a discounted rate in its ongoing presale.\n\nIts tokenomics allocates 40% to the presale and 27.5% to staking rewards, ensuring over half of the total supply benefits early supporters. As you purchase your GBTC, you can enjoy staking rewards of up to 698% APY, which diminishes as more tokens are staked. Therefore, early participation is key to securing more passive rewards. With the expected bull run, Green Bitcoin offers you a chance to have a share in Bitcoin prediction and exciting investment opportunities.\n\n>>> Buy The Best Coin Now<<<\n\nSolana\u2019s Bold Move To $2,000: What This Could Mean For Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nSolana has emerged as a formidable contender, boldly setting its sights on an ambitious $2,000 price target. This audacious goal presents intriguing implications for industry stalwarts Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nSolana has made quite the show, with its impressive 500+% surge in the past 12 months, positioning itself as the preferred choice for institutional investors seeking Bitcoin alternatives. As a result, there is a significant shift in capital flows away from Ethereum toward Solana. As institutional money aligns with Solana\u2019s bullish performance, there\u2019s a massive upside potential for this project. So, what will this new $2,000 price mean for the crypto market?\n\nA $2,000 price point for Solana could mean over 840 billion market cap. This will place Solana a close second to Bitcoin\u2019s market cap and double that of Ethereum if the two cryptos return to their All-Time High prices of $68,800 and $4,200, respectively. While this ambitious price set by Solana is under speculation, the crypto community is eager to see the long-term price action of this spirited altcoin.\n\n>>> Buy The Best Coin Now<<<\n\nWrapping it Up: Take Advantage of the New Cryptos Poised For Revolutionary Gains\n\nSolana\u2019s ambitious price move can reshape the entire crypto space. However, it is noteworthy that SOL\u2019s $2,000 price target is purely speculative and should be handled cautiously. As the market gears up for a new market year, it is vital to note that the new coins we\u2019ve discussed are still in their nascent stages, armed with impressive use cases and ready to dominate the crypto market. The time has arrived for you to fill your bags with these coins as they offer rewarding potential that\u2019ll skyrocket your portfolio.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) saw a price pump as bulls regained control of the market and initiated a rally in the short run. The breakout above the $2,000 hurdle also provided the crypto with a lot of investor attention, and the price continued the momentum, which was supported by a decent buying volume.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) also saw a significant upswing as it made its way towards Stage 8 of its presale, fueled by interest in its disruptive blockchain technology implementation and AI-driven features. We will explore the opportunity for both cryptos and see how far they can climb.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Breaks Above $2,000 \u2013 To Reach $3,332.19 in Q1, 2024\n\nIn the past year, Ethereum (ETH) saw a total price upswing of 75%. During the previous seven days, ETH moved up in value from $2,201 to $2,384, and this growth occurred following the crypto\u2019s break above the $2,000 price barrier. Currently, the Ethereum market cap is at $266,955,902,567, while its trading volume is at $20,666,358,004.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on November 15 that following the SEC delaying the ETH futures ETF bid, he believes if they do approve the application, it will allow Grayscale to argue for the approval of the spot Ether ETF application. As a result, this pushed interest in the Ethereum crypto further and could lead it to new heights. Based on the Ethereum price prediction, it can reach $3,332.19 by the start of 2024.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) Will Enable Fractional Ownership in Multi-Million Dollar Properties\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) will disrupt the $280 trillion real estate market through the introduction of blockchain elements that will tackle key issues in the industry. Historically, most people had trouble accessing the space due to the high costs of entry, as most properties would cost millions of dollars that needed to be paid upfront.\n\nAs a result, Everlodge will mint each property as an NFT and, afterward, will fractionalize them. This way, if a property is worth $5,000,000, it can get split into 50,000 pieces worth just $100 each. Holders of these fractions retain all of the benefits associated with property ownership, such as passive income from rental properties and value appreciation.\n\nThere will also be an AI tool that can predict future markets in which properties can explode in value, providing users with high ROI opportunities. A Rewards Club will be available where holders of the native crypto can get access to free nightly stays, and a Launchpad will be featured, where property builders can get funding from the community. As a result, anyone will be able to build a vast, diversified portfolio of properties and maximize their opportunities. All of these aspects make it the best new crypto to invest in.\n\nSummary\n\nWhile analysts are bullish on Ethereum\u2019s future, it will take some time for the crypto to reach the projected gains. Currently, the ELDG crypto is undergoing its crypto ICO phase and is at Stage 8, trading at just $0.027. With its recent momentum in mind, at launch, analysts are expecting a price upswing of 2,500%.\n\nFor more information about the ongoing Everlodge (ELDG) Presale, please visit their website."

        "content": "In the dynamic realm of digital finance, cryptocurrency has emerged as a revolutionary force, redefining traditional concepts of currency and investment. Among several cryptocurrencies, Ethereum stands out as innovative, showcasing the transformative potential that this technology brings to the table.\n\nThe Importance of Cryptocurrency:\n\nAt its core, cryptocurrency is not merely a digital form of money but a powerful tool that operates on decentralized blockchain technology. Ethereum, in particular, has distinguished itself by introducing smart contracts, a feature that has far-reaching implications across various industries. These contracts, executed automatically when predefined conditions are met, have the potential to reshape how we conduct transactions, manage supply chains, and even enforce agreements.\n\nEthereum as a Case Study:\n\nEthereum\u2019s decentralized nature fosters a wide array of applications, making it a robust platform beyond just being a digital currency. Its programmable blockchain has laid the foundation for decentralized applications (dApps), enabling developers to create innovative solutions in finance, healthcare, and more.

        "content": "Polygon (MATIC) is a Layer-2 scaling solution that jumped in popularity over the past few years and has seen a massive price increase recently, fueled by the overall market rally. It gathered a reputation due to its zero carbon emission goal, which is the first step towards sustainability.\n\nEthereum (ETH) also experienced a notable upswing, especially after Bloomberg ETF analyst Jaymes Seyffart discussed how Grayscale\u2019s Ether futures ETF application could just be a ploy to corner the SEC to approve its spot Ether ETF. Another crypto that experienced an upswing recently is Everlodge (ELDG), especially as it moved towards Stage 8 of its presale. Today, we will go over the price performance of each crypto to see how far they can climb.\n\nPolygon (MATIC) Broke Past $0.93 \u2013 Is $1.50 Possible?\n\nPolygon (MATIC) started the year with a downward trend, as its value fell from $1.50 to the $0.50 mark. Since then, it has experienced a major upswing, reaching its highest point at $0.93, indicating that Polygon could soon break past its $1 resistance point again in the near future.\n\nThe average price for the Polygon crypto is currently at $0.85, as during the past week, it moved from $0.789701 to $0.930923. Based on recent projections, the MATIC crypto is primed to experience a bull run soon, as according to the Polygon price prediction, it can reach $1.50 by the end of 2024.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Goes Above $2,300 \u2013 Is a Surge to $3,300 Realistic?\n\nEthereum (ETH) was recently in the spotlight, especially after comments on a future ETF. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said in a November 15 X (Twitter) post, following the SEC delaying the ETH futures ETF bid, that he believes if the SEC approves the application, it will enable Grayscale the opportunity to argue for the approval of the spot Ether ETF application.\n\nDuring the past week, the Ethereum crypto moved up in value from $2,201.45 to $2,384.93. In the past year, the total price upswing was by 75%, which means that by the end, Ethereum could double in value from its initial price at the start of the year. Analysts are also bullish on its future, and following the ETF results, the Ethereum price prediction indicates that it can surge as high as $3,332.19 in 2024.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) Will Feature a Rewards Club With Free Nightly Stays\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) is an upcoming real estate marketplace that has captured a lot of attention with its cryptocurrency ICO. The presale momentum has been massive as the project brings blockchain technology into the $280 trillion real estate market. Traditionally, getting access to a luxury property was difficult. Everlodge will combat this by minting each property as an NFT and then fractionalizing it into smaller pieces worth just $100 each.\n\nWe\u2019re thrilled to announce that our website just got a makeover! \ud83d\udcbb\n\nCheck out the fresh look and discover the NEW features we\u2019ve added. It\u2019s all about making your experience even better!\n\nPlus, remember that our Presale is still ON.\n\nExplore now: https://t.co/SIYWBylwQD#RWA pic.twitter.com/aTuT8x7z36 \u2014 Everlodge (@EverlodgeHQ) October 23, 2023\n\nThis way, anyone can become a co-owner of multi-million dollar properties with ease. Anyone can also access the Rewards Club, where holders of the native crypto can gain access to free nightly stays. They can re-sell them for additional capital gains if they are not interested in using them. Each rental property can provide passive income to fractional NFT holders as well.\n\nSummary\n\nPolygon could soon see an upswing, and analysts are expecting Ethereum to see a major upswing if the SEC approves the Ether ETF. For the time being, however, the most significant gains can be made with Everlodge. During Stage 8 of the presale, the cryptocurrency trades at just $0.027. At launch, analysts are predicting a price upswing of 2,800%, making it the best DeFi crypto.\n\nFor more information about the ongoing Everlodge (ELDG) Presale, please visit their website.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Why Does the Ethereum Network Get Congested? - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "What is Ethereum and why do we need it? Ethereum is the leading decentralized global computing network that can get congested, but why? In this guide, we explore why the Ethereum network gets congested.\n\nWhat is Ethereum\n\nEthereum is the leading decentralized global computing network, functioning as a platform for smart contracts and dApps built on blockchain technology. It is one of the most popular blockchain networks, responsible for the unprecedented Dogecoin price rise around a decade ago, and now home to several growing altcoins including USDC, USDT, LINK and, of course, ETH. However, its popularity has resulted in network congestion and scaling difficulties.\n\nEthereum is an open-source, decentralized blockchain-based platform that allows anyone to build and deploy permanent and immutable decentralized applications, known as dApps. It utilizes smart contracts, which are programmable transaction protocols that automatically execute when specific conditions are met. These smart contracts run exactly as programmed and are stored on and executed by the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nEthereum has its own native cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH) which is digital money that can be sent or received anywhere in the world. ETH is the second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. It operates via a global peer-to-peer network that maintains a distributed ledger called the blockchain. The blockchain records all transactions taking place on the network. Developers can build and deploy decentralized applications on Ethereum using programming languages like Solidity and Vyper that compile into bytecode that is executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nEthereum was first proposed in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin and went live in 2015. Since then, it has grown to become the most actively used blockchain, with the largest developer community working on the platform. The goal of Ethereum is to become a \u2018world computer\u2019 that replaces centralized intermediaries and runs decentralized applications, enabling censorship resistance, trust less transactions, and economic innovation on a global scale.\n\nCore Causes\n\nThere are a lot of elements of Ethereum that might be the cause of congestion, such as limitations of Proof-of-Work consensus. The PoW algorithm used does not efficiently scale as transaction volume increases. Block size and block time remains constant at capacity regardless of demand. The consensus algorithm does not scale well. Block size and block time is static regardless of transaction volume.\n\nAnd then there is a lack of native sharding. Unlike later generation blockchains, Ethereum 1.0 has no native sharding or parallelized transaction processing capabilities. This restricts TPS. More users and activity \u2013 As Ethereum has grown, more transactions like token swaps, DEX trades, NFT mints happen, filling blocks.\n\nThe gas auction model is also a factor. The use of gas fees auctioned via first-price auction means users bid up prices during high demand periods, further congesting the network.\n\nAdditionally, popular decentralized apps like CryptoKitties , decentralized exchanges, and DeFi protocols overload the network with transactions far exceeding baseline capacity. Games have clogged the network with transactions. DeFi apps also overload the network. Steadily increasing wallet addresses, daily active users and new dApps bring more total transactions over time as adoption grows.\n\nNFTs have also grown in popularity. In fact, you might say they exploded. This explosive growth of NFTs attached to digital items like profile pictures, artwork, collectibles minting millions of tokens on-chain causes bottlenecks.\n\nFinally, the ICO craze of 2017 congested Ethereum with token transactions, followed by their collapse which left abandoned dApps. The 2017/2018 ICO craze congested Ethereum with token transactions and drawn-out sales.\n\nHowever, these are accidental causes. There is also the purposeful clogging by hackers and spammers. Spammers intentionally clog up transaction capacity through attacks with unnecessary transactions and data. Attacks or abuse of cheap gas fees intentionally clog up bandwidth with unnecessary transactions.\n\nEffects of Congestion\n\nSo, what are the effects of this clogging? Why should we care?\n\nWell, for a start, average transaction confirmation times can go from minutes to hours during peak congestion periods and congestion can lead to significantly higher gas fees. Users are forced to overbid on gas prices to prioritize transactions, pricing out smaller users. Users compete through gas price auctions to get priority, driving up costs significantly.\n\nCongestion combined with gas price uncertainty leads users to set gas too low, causing TX failures. Transactions with lower gas fees may get rejected entirely when capacity limited.\n\nAdditionally, the overall user experience suffers due to delays, costs, and uncertainty during congestion. There are constrained capabilities because congestion limits the ability to scale dApps and overall network functionalities. This also affects scaling, since congestion limits practical use cases and dApp development on Ethereum.\n\nSolutions\n\nThere are a number of solutions that can be deployed to handle this congestion, like:\n\n\u2013 Layer 2 scaling: Solutions like roll ups and side chains move activity off-chain while leveraging Ethereum security.\n\n\u2013 Proof-of-Stake: Consensus upgrade to Proof-of-Stake aims to handle more transactions per second at lower costs. Consensus upgrade planned to increase transaction throughput and efficiency.\n\n\u2013 Sharding: Planned upgrade that parallelizes transaction processing across multiple chains to increase throughput.\n\n\u2013 Limiting blockchain bloat: Restricting certain NFT mints or identifying network spam transactions during congestion.\n\n\u2013 Allowing some failed transactions: This can relieve network capacity pressure during peak congestion.\n\n\u2013 Limiting blockchain bloat: Restricting certain activities like minting NFTs during peak congestion.\n\n\u2013 Higher gas fees: Increasing the minimum gas price helps reduce network abuse.\n\nConclusion\n\nManaging extreme congestion events while scaling Ethereum for the long-term with upgrades like Eth2 is critical to realizing its full potential. Ethereum\u2019s popularity has strained capacity limits. But network upgrades like Eth2 and new L2 solutions will help scale Ethereum to meet growing demand in the future. Careful management of congestion and gas fees is key for stability.\n\n."
