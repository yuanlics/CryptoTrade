        "title": "Dogecoin Proves It's a Serious Blockchain, Flips Ethereum Transaction Count - Blockworks",
        "content": "Dogecoin is undergoing a surge in network spam so dramatic that it\u2019s now processing more transactions than the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nOver the past week, the memecoin network handled more than 7.9 million transactions, up nearly 11% on Ethereum\u2019s 7.2 million and more than double Bitcoin\u2019s count.\n\nNot bad for a chain that has handled only 30,000 daily transactions on average since 2015 \u2014 less than 5% of Ethereum\u2019s.\n\nThe culprit is Bitcoin Ordinals. Or more precisely, opportunistic crypto fans eager to capitalize on the inscriptions hype.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals aren\u2019t exactly the same as the NFTs you might find on Ethereum or Solana. Those non-fungible tokens are minted via smart contract and adhere to their own token standards enforced by wallets, marketplaces and other key infrastructure across Web3.\n\nOrdinals are instead defined by data \u201cinscribed\u201d into individual satoshis (sats for short). Sats are BTC\u2019s smallest denomination: 0.00000001 BTC currently worth $0.00027. A craft developer recently figured out how to forever imbue sats with special properties, such as enough data to render a JPEG or DOOM clone.\n\nBRC-20 tokens \u2014 a play on Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 standard for run-of-the-mill tokens \u2014 quickly followed Ordinals. Hype for Bitcoin-powered altcoins and collectible sats triggered a renaissance for blockspace demand, driving up fees while pushing transaction counts and mempool backlogs to record highs.\n\nIf we consider Ordinals in the same genre of digital asset as Bored Apes, Bitcoin is now the number-two blockchain for NFTs behind Ethereum.\n\nDogecoin\u2019s transaction count exploded past other prominent blockchains over the past few weeks\n\nDoge see, Doge do\n\nDue to similarities between Bitcoin and Dogecoin (a code fork of a code fork of Bitcoin), it didn\u2019t take long for developers to code methods for minting Dogecoin tokens in much the same way as Ordinals and BRC-20s \u2014 except with a \u201cD\u201d instead of a \u201cB.\u201d\n\nBut Bitcoiners have multiple platforms on which traders can swap Ordinals and BRC-20s, including crypto exchange wallets. Dogecoin doesn\u2019t.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s BRC-20s in particular have been helped by an experimental token standard, something akin to Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20s.\n\nThe standard set enough technical parameters so that infrastructure (wallets, marketplaces and the like) can facilitate trading and whatnot without running into headaches, like duplicate listings and overtly broken code.\n\nBRC-20 and Ordinals individually have recently made up more than half of all Bitcoin transactions, and it\u2019s unclear just how many DRC-20-related transactions are flowing through Dogecoin right now. No tools have been built to sort DRC-20 outputs from others, which makes it difficult to quantify exactly how many Dogecoin tokens are being minted every minute.\n\nIn any case, it\u2019s surely an impressive chunk. Multiple DRC-20 token transactions are found in practically every single block right now (which occur every one minute on average). They are easy to spot, as they usually come with a 0.001 DOGE fee attached ($0.000071).\n\nPseudonymous Dogecoin developer inevitable360 told Blockworks that they classify DRC-20 transactions like these as spam because anyone can clone or replicate the exact same token.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, there is no DRC-20 token standard for Dogecoin. So, many tokens are being minted under the same name, making it practically impossible to form a legitimate market around them.\n\nThere\u2019s still legitimate Dogecoin activity alongside speculators minting Dogecoin tokens via the one or two wallets that support them in their current form (which have been caught boosting fees to apparently profit from the hype).\n\nThe median transaction value is nearly 77 DOGE ($5.46). If DRC-20s were truly the overwhelming majority, then that figure would be far lower.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals already have their own marketplaces\n\nIt might be spam, but it\u2019s honest work\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, much of the recent Bitcoin activity has also been labeled spam: effectively worthless transactions with no reason to exist but to exist; abundant purely because creation is cheap and the potential payoff is large.\n\nGranted: Ethereum layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum and Optimism are each processing tons of transactions. More than a million per day for the former, in fact. If we add those in with Ethereum, then the blockchain dominates Dogecoin by far.\n\nEthereum fees are also high right now. High enough to apparently dissuade a portion of useless trade, particularly NFTs. But there\u2019s something to be said for Dogecoin in this instance.\n\nMany deride Dogecoin as a joke carefully crafted to trap crypto newbies into gambling on memecoins during bull runs.\n\nThere may be some element of truth to that. But historically, Dogecoin has served as a lucrative alternative for bitcoin miners at times when mining BTC was simply not profitable. An unsung hero, in those cases.\n\nDogecoin is also merge-minable with Litecoin, allowing miners to share hash rate between the two to provide some element of flexibility in support of a multichain future. It just so happens that right now, there appears to be more activity tied to DRC-20 speculation today than that tied to the use of Ethereum mainnet overall.\n\nAnd Dogecoin still has lower median fees: $0.00096 compared to Ethereum\u2019s $3.13 \u2014 no doubt an uncomfortable fact for many ETH fans.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Bitcoin evangelist Jimmy Song and Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin made a bet in 2018 now worth between $1.5 million and $1.9 million in crypto\n\nBut the details were \u201cnever finalised,\u201d Song tells DL News\n\nFive years ago, Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin and Bitcoin evangelist Jimmy Song made a high stakes bet on the future of Ethereum. The results are in, and it appears Song would have won.\n\nBut \u201cthe bet was never finalised,\u201d Song said.\n\n\u201cWe needed to finalise the arbiter and specific terms,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cI chased him for months on those and I couldn\u2019t pin him down.\u201d\n\nLubin did not respond to requests for comment sent to public relations representatives at his company, ConsenSys.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nIn 2018, the pair shared a stage at Consensus, a crypto conference organised by CoinDesk. Song, a so-called Bitcoin maximalist, said he saw no future for Ethereum. Lubin said he would bet \u201cany amount of Bitcoin\u201d Song was wrong.\n\nNOW READ: Why Ethereum is so dominant \u2014 and why it\u2019s not going anywhere\n\nA year later, they hammered out the details: If Ethereum had five unique decentralised applications, or dApps, with at least 10,000 daily users and 100,000 monthly users during any six months in any calendar year before May 23, 2023, Lubin would win 810.8 ETH. That was worth about $600,000 in 2018, and about $1.5 million today.\n\nIf Ethereum did not have five popular applications, Song would win 69.74 Bitcoin, worth about $600,000 in 2018 and almost $1.9 million Tuesday.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nIt seems as though Song would have won, though technicalities \u2014 are layer 2 blockchains, such as Optimism, dApps? \u2014 could have tipped the bet in Lubin\u2019s favour. It was disagreement over those technicalities that apparently killed the bet.\n\n\u201dHe was trying to include all sorts of stuff into the active user metric, like posting an offer on some centralized server,\u201d Song said. \u201cI disagreed and I never heard back.\u201d\n\nWithout layer 2 blockchains, it appears only Uniswap, the preeminent decentralised exchange, and NFT marketplace OpenSea have regularly hit 10,000 daily users and 100,000 monthly users, according to data from DappRadar.\n\nFrom August 2020 through the end of 2021, more than 20,000 crypto wallets interacted with Uniswap V2 almost every day, according to DappRadar. During the final seven months of 2021, the tail-end of crypto\u2019s bull run, more than 10,000 crypto wallets interacted with a newer version of the Uniswap protocol, Uniswap V3, daily.\n\nInterest in V3 dropped along with crypto hype in 2022, but traders flocked back during a recent memecoin frenzy.\n\nNOW READ: \u2018Sandwich bots\u2019 filch millions off unwitting investors during meme coin rally\n\nBetween July 2021 and April, more than 10,000 crypto addresses interacted with OpenSea daily, according to DappRadar. Over the past month, about 5,000 crypto addresses interacted with OpenSea daily.\n\nThen there\u2019s the issue of measuring an application\u2019s user base. One person can control multiple crypto wallets. And few \u2014 if any \u2014 decentralised applications perform know-your-customer checks, making it difficult to measure how many users they actually have.\n\nHigh stakes bets are popular with industry high-rollers. Last year, pseudonymous crypto trader GCR made a $10 million bet on the future of Terra with Do Kwon, who was recently arrested in Montenegro.\n\nThe money was put in escrow, and GCR officially won in March of this year.\n\nThis story has been updated to include an additional comment from Song.\n\nHave tips?

        "title": "What Is Solidity Programming in Ethereum - Simplilearn",
        "content": "Dapps otherwise referred to as Decentralized Applications are applications built on the open-source, peer-to-peer network of Ethereum Blockchain which uses smart contracts and front-end user interfaces to create decentralized platforms.\n\nDeveloping a Dapp, like any other app, requires programming and executing code on the system. Solidity programming stands apart from the other programming languages and is the programming language of choice in Ethereum.\n\nSolidity is a brand-new programming language developed by Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency market by capitalization.\n\nSo if you are interested in exploring more about Solidity Programming and its concepts, then you are at the right place. In this tutorial on Solidity Programming, you will cover various important components of Solidity Programming.\n\nEnhance your programming prowess with Simplilearn's cutting-edge computer programming courses. Get started today!\n\nWhat is Solidity Programming?\n\nSolidity is an object-oriented programming language created specifically by the Ethereum Network team for constructing and designing smart contracts on Blockchain platforms.\n\nIt's used to create smart contracts that implement business logic and generate a chain of transaction records in the blockchain system.\n\nIt acts as a tool for creating machine-level code and compiling it on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nIt has a lot of similarities with C and C++ and is pretty simple to learn and understand. For example, a \u201cmain\u201d in C is equivalent to a \u201ccontract\u201d in Solidity.\n\nLike other programming languages, Solidity programming also has variables, functions, classes, arithmetic operations, string manipulation, and many other concepts.\n\nEvolution of Solidity Programming Solidity is a relatively new language that is rapidly growing. Solidity is currently the core language on Ethereum and other private blockchains operating on competing platforms, such as Monax and its Hyperledger Burrow blockchain which uses Tendermint for consensus.\n\nSWIFT has created a proof of concept that runs on Burrow and uses Solidity.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program What are EVM and Smart Contracts? EVM or Ethereum Virtual Machine The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) provides a runtime environment for Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nIt is primarily concerned with ensuring the security and execution of untrusted programs through the use of an international network of public nodes.\n\nEVM is specialized in preventing Denial-of-Service attacks and certifies that the programs do not have access to each other's state, as well as establishing communication, with no possible interference. Smart Contracts Smart contracts refer to high-level program codes compiled into EVM before being posted to the Ethereum blockchain for execution.\n\nIt enables you to conduct trustworthy transactions without the involvement of a third party; these transactions are traceable and irreversible.\n\nProgramming languages commonly used to create and write smart contracts are Serpent, Solidity, Mutan, and LLL.\n\nData Types of Solidity Programming It supports all the common data types seen in other OOP languages, such as, Boolean - The Boolean data type returns \u20181' when the condition is true and \u20180' when it is false, depending on the status of the condition.\n\nInteger - You can sign or unsign integer values in Solidity. It also supports runtime exceptions and the \u2018uint8' and \u2018uint256' keywords.\n\nString - Single or double quotes can denote a string.\n\nModifier - Before executing the code for a smart contract, a modifier often verifies that any condition is rational.\n\nArray - The syntax of Solidity programming is like that of other OOP languages, and it supports both single and multidimensional arrays. Apart from that, Solidity programming allows you to \"Map\" data structures with enums, operators, and hash values to return values stored in specific storage places.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program How to Get Started With Solidity Programming? Version Pragma Pragmas are directives to the compiler about how to handle the code. Every line of solidity source code should begin with a \"version pragma,\" which specifies which version of the solidity compiler to use.\n\nThis prevents the code from being incompatible with future compiler versions that may introduce changes. The Contract Keyword The contract keyword declares a contract that encapsulates the code. State/Declare Variables State variables are written on the Ethereum Blockchain and are permanently maintained in contract storage.\n\nThe line uint public var1 declares a state variable of type uint named var1 (unsigned integer of 256 bits), it is very similar to adding a slot in a database. A Function Declaration This is a function named \u201cset\u201d of access modifier type public which takes a variable a and variable b of data type uint as a parameter.\n\nThis was an example of a simple smart contract that updates the value of var1 and var2. Anyone with access to the Ethereum blockchain can use the set function to change the value of var1 and var2.\n\nBy adding the values of the variables var1 and var2, it can calculate the variable sum.\n\nIt will retrieve and print the value of the state variable sum using the \u201cget\u201d function.\n\nHow to Execute the Code You can execute a Solidity Program in two ways - Offline Mode Online Mode Offline Mode To operate a Solidity smart contract in Offline mode, it must meet three conditions and follow four essential actions: Conditions Download and install node.js. Install Truffle globally. Install ganache-cli. Actions Create a truffle project and set up a development network for it. Develop and deploy a smart contract for it. From the Truffle console, interact with the smart contract. Create tests to evaluate Solidity's primary features. Online Mode In the Online Mode, the Remix IDE is typically used to compile and run Solidity smart contracts. Remix IDE\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program Advantages of Solidity Programming Apart from the primary functionality of Solidity Programming, there are many other features provided by Solidity programming that cause it to have an edge over other Ethereum based languages. Apart from fundamental data types, Solidity programming also allows complex data types and member variables.\n\nIt provides an Application Binary Interface (ABI) to enable type safety. If the compiler discovers a data type mismatch for any variable, the ABI generates an error.\n\nIt refers to the \u2018Natural Language Specification,' which is used to turn user-centric specifications into language that machines can understand.

        "title": "What Is Ethereum 2.0? What You Should Know - GOBankingRates",
        "content": "What Is Ethereum 2.0? What You Should Know\n\nCapuski / Getty Images\n\nEthereum 2.0 was the next level of blockchain technology and cryptography. Though Eth2 is no longer the terminology used, Ethereum isn\u2019t sitting idle. Ethereum, however, isn\u2019t sitting idle. It\u2019s altering its state as time goes on.\n\nIs Ethereum 2.0 Ever Coming Out?\n\nEthereum 2.0 \u2014 referred to as the Ethereum upgrades \u2014 consisted of three core steps, two of which were completed. The third step was deemed no longer necessary as other technology was developed faster than expected. While the Ethereum 2.0 upgrades no longer carry the name, the Ethereum ecosystem still has a long-term roadmap in place: Innovations to the ecosystem are making it more scalable, secure and sustainable.\n\nEthereum 2.0 consisted of three core steps, two of which were completed:\n\nLaunch of the Beacon Chain \u2014 complete The Ethereum Merge \u2014 complete Ethereum Sharding \u2014 replaced by layer 2 rollups\n\nStep 1: Ethereum Beacon Chain\n\nThe Beacon Chain was the first stage of migrating Ethereum from a proof-of-work mechanism to proof-of-stake. It was a test to ensure PoS was a sustainable way forward for Ethereum\u2019s blockchain before its introduction to the ecosystem. When the test proved successful, the PoS mechanism worked alongside the previous PoW system as the next phase began developing.\n\nStep 2: Ethereum Merge\n\nThe Ethereum Merge followed the introduction of the Beacon Chain and combined the blockchain data collected since Ethereum\u2019s inception with the data collected on the Beacon Chain, creating one mechanism dedicated to the PoS consensus.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nBefore the Merge, PoS and PoW co-existed, but the purpose of the Merge was to eliminate the need for PoW. The overarching goal is to end energy-intensive mining. Additional benefits include reduced environmental damage, increased scale usability and improved security.\n\nWhile PoW still exists, it has been altered so that it\u2019s no longer profitable for miners to use it. Post-Merge, it\u2019s estimated that the amount of energy used for Ethereum decreased by 99.95%. Using Bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption as a comparison, estimated to be around 150 terawatt-hours per year \u2014 equivalent to the amount of electricity Argentina expends annually \u2014 the Ethereum Merge works as a far more energy-efficient monetary system.\n\nStep 3: Ethereum Sharding \u2014 Layer 2 Rollups\n\nThe last step of the original Ethereum upgrades roadmap, Sharding has been dropped from the roadmap thanks to the quick development of another tool of scalability: layer 2 rollups. While the previous stages focused on security and sustainability, Ethereum Sharding was designed to concentrate on scalability and encourage network participation.\n\nLayer 2 rollups are a different approach to scalability. It refers to taking hundreds of transactions completed on layer 2 \u2014 a secondary blockchain of Ethereum \u2014 and \u201crolling up\u201d or bundling them into one transaction on layer 1, which is Ethereum\u2019s base blockchain. This process has been able to provide scaling without the step of sharding.\n\nWhat Is Sharding? Sharding divides data into smaller subsets, making it easier for a network to handle. This isn\u2019t a new concept \u2014 it\u2019s an ideal frequently shared in the computer science industry and seeks to reduce transaction times and network congestion on the blockchain. The belief is that increasing data availability removes the need for expensive computing hardware. Therefore, anyone with a regular phone or laptop will be able to contribute to securing the network.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nEthereum\u2019s New Roadmap\n\nWhile Ethereum 2.0 is no longer the accepted term, that doesn\u2019t mean Ethereum has stopped developing. ETH now breaks its roadmap into four categories:\n\nCheaper transactions: The current effort to reduce fees is focused on reducing data storage costs through Proto-Danksharding \u2014 moving data from Ethereum to temporary storage. Extra security: Planned improvements to Ethereum\u2019s security include increasing liquidity, protecting users from spam attacks and from failures in the network, hardware and software. Better user experience: Ethereum is aiming to make itself easier to use through protection for lost or stolen wallet keys and making nodes more accessible for the less tech-savvy. Future proofing: To keep itself both relevant and reliable, Ethereum is developing upgrades to protect the network from anticipated future threats.\n\nOther Effects of the Ethereum 2.0 Upgrade\n\nEthereum 2.0, while it was called that, brought up a number of questions beyond the basics outlined in its roadmap.\n\nWill Ethereum 2.0 Be a New Coin?\n\nThere is no new coin or crypto resulting from Ethereum 2.0 upgrades. One of the main reasons developers changed the wording from \u201cEthereum 2.0\u201d to \u201cEthereum upgrades\u201d is to avoid that confusion.\n\nThose holding ethereum, or ETH, do not need to take any action. ETH can still be used in the same manner as always: trading, staking, exchanging and other usual functions.\n\nBinance issued a warning that anyone asking users to buy \u201cETH2\u201d tokens may be a scammer. Any contact suggesting funds need to be sent to an unknown third party should be ignored. Crypto scams are prevalent, and holders of digital assets must remain skeptical of suspicious activity.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nDid Ethereum 2.0 Reduce Gas Fees?\n\nThe Merge was not expected to reduce gas fees in any meaningful way. However, as Ethereum updates continue, lower gas fees \u2014 and quicker transactions \u2014 are expected to follow.\n\nDid Ethereum 2.0 Replace Ethereum?\n\nThe move to Ethereum 2.0 does not affect the ethereum that people currently hold. Each ethereum token is no different from before, and the Ethereum blockchain was upgraded, not replaced.\n\nEthereum 2.0 was simply an upgrade that gave the community of ethereum holders the option to earn yield from the proof-of-stake model. Participants can receive a percentage reward in exchange for using their ethereum to secure the network.\n\nIn fact, some analysts predict that the upgrades will increase ETH\u2019s price in the long term, though that remains to be seen.\n\nInsiders Weigh In on Ethereum 2.0\n\nA key Ethereum researcher, Justin Drake, told Time that Ethereum 2.0 \u201cdramatically increases the security of Ethereum.\u201d In his words, the upgrade will make it far more challenging to make any attacks on the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nCo-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, also made his feelings known following the successful Merge. He took to Twitter in September 2022, proclaiming that the event will cut \u201cworldwide electricity consumption by 0.2%.\u201d\n\nFinal Take\n\nEthereum\u2019s 2.0 upgrades promised to create positive results and appear to be succeeding so far. Decreasing Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption by 99.95% is a significant step toward ensuring cryptocurrency\u2019s place in an environmentally conscious future.\n\nWhile ethereum is still far from its previous peaks, that isn\u2019t necessarily a reflection on the upgrades \u2014 cryptocurrency as a whole remains in a bear market for the time being. Once the market turns, Ethereum could be a focus of interest for investors and crypto technology enthusiasts alike.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nBefore making any investment decisions, remember that the cryptocurrency market is volatile. It may be a good idea to consult with a financial professional before investing in any crypto assets.\n\nFAQ Here are some questions people ask about the Ethereum 2.0 upgrades. Is Ethereum 2.0 the final upgrade? No \u2013 the Ethereum upgrades are a continual process. The major steps of the Beacon Chain and the Ethereum Merge are now complete. More upgrades occurred in April 2023, and further upgrades such as staking withdrawals are expected later this year.\n\nIs ethereum a good investment? As far as cryptocurrency goes, ethereum is one of the better investments because of its continuous development and wider use cases. However, the price ethereum will command in the future is unknown. Finder, a fintech specialist, estimates ethereum will be worth $14,814 by late 2030. For now, while crypto as a whole has not yet left its bear market, recent upward moves may show promising signs for the future.\n\nWhen did the Ethereum Merge happen? The Ethereum Merge was completed on Sept. 15, 2022, solidifying the move to PoS consensus.\n\nIs it better to buy ethereum or ethereum 2.0? There is no way to buy ETH2 because it is the same as ETH. Ethereum's upgrades did not and will not result in a new token. In fact, anyone attempting to sell ETH2 tokens is probably a scammer \u2013 or got scammed themselves.\n\nHere are some questions people ask about the Ethereum 2.0 upgrades.\n\nChris Ozarowski and Amber Barkley contributed to the reporting for this article.\n\nInformation is accurate as of May 26, 2023, and is subject to change."

        "content": "The balance of available Ether (ETH) across crypto exchanges dropped to a five-year low on May 26, bringing the total amount of Ether held on exchanges to 17.86 million. A drastic decline in the exchange supply of ETH like this has not been seen since April 2018.\n\nAccording to Glassnode data, only 14.85% of the total Ether supply is currently held on centralized exchanges, compared with the 25\u201326% of supply held during the 2021 bull run.\n\nThe decline in Ether exchange balances. Source: Glassnode\n\nThe drop in ETH supply began in September 2022, dropping significantly after the FTX crisis in November. Apart from a decline in the exchange balance, Ethereum wallet addresses holding more than 100 ETH have also declined to a six-month low.\n\nTwo significant events could have influenced the decline in ETH balances on centralized exchanges in the recent past. The first is the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange, prompting many to move their crypto assets from exchange wallets to self-custody wallets; the second, and most important, is the Shapella upgrade.\n\nShapella made way for thousands of validators to withdraw their staked ETH. However, contrary to popular belief, a minority of validators decided to unstake, while the majority only withdrew their staking rewards.\n\nThe movement of assets away from exchanges is considered a bullish sign, indicating traders are not looking to sell at the current price. In Ethereum\u2019s case, re-staking ETH is the most apparent reason for the declining exchange supply.\n\nRelated: Ethereum price metrics hint that ETH might not sell off after the Shapella hard fork\n\nMajor crypto exchanges like Binance, Bitfinex, Kraken and others that supported the Shapella upgrade saw a significant outflow of ETH from their exchange wallets, leading to the current balance decline.\n\nETH withdrawal from crypto exchanges. Source: Nansen\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported earlier, in the week after the Shapella upgrade, the amount of ETH being staked surpassed the amount of ETH being withdrawn. Another report from Glassnode estimated that less than 1% of staked ETH was expected to be sold. Thus, a significant chunk of ETH moving away from centralized exchanges returned to staking.\n\nMagazine: 2023 is a make-or-break year for blockchain gaming: Play-to-own"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe United States is barreling toward a date that could have historic consequences for global markets, running the risk of its first-ever debt default. It's a potential black swan event that could have an outsized impact on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the rest of the crypto market.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned weeks ago that the government would soon run out of funds if the debt ceiling isn\u2019t suspended or raised\u2014possibly as early as June 1. If lawmakers remain deadlocked and can\u2019t come to an agreement on spending, Washington won\u2019t be able to pay its bills, she said.\n\nSimilar standoffs over the debt ceiling have rattled markets in the past, like a prolonged disagreement over the debt ceiling that sent the S&P 500 tumbling 16% in 2011, startling investors before a resolution was reached.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis time around, Wall Street has yawned. The S&P 500 is down less than 1% since Yellen issued her sobering remarks on May 1. However, Bitcoin has fallen more than 7% and Ethereum is down nearly 3% during the same period, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAmerica's \u201cX-date\u201d\n\nTypically, debt ceiling debacles create more noise than market-moving news, Amberdata\u2019s Director of Derivatives Greg Magadini told Decrypt\u2014but he acknowledged that a U.S. debt default is far from off the table.\n\n\u201cIt feels like a pretty intense game of chicken right now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd given how crazy things have gone in the past couple of years, I think anything is possible.\u201d\n\nIn the event that the government defaults on its debts, risk assets like stocks and crypto would face short-term pain, Magadini said. He explained that\u2019s because a drop in the quality of government-backed debt would likely raise borrowing costs, counterintuitively increasing its yield and strengthening the dollar compared to other assets.\n\nSimilarly, the dollar could strengthen during a U.S. default as American traders tend to onshore their dollars\u2014swapping foreign currencies and assets for the greenback\u2014during risk-off events, CoinShares\u2019 Head of Research James Butterfill told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTechnically speaking, the dollar should sell off in the event of a default, but it won't because people tend to onshore their dollars in periods of market stress,\u201d he said. \u201cThe dollar might actually strengthen, perversely, because people are getting worried, and that actually won\u2019t be so great for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nButterfill envisions the dollar will strengthen and Bitcoin will slide as the U.S. approaches what the White House has described as America's \u201cX-date,\u201d the official date at which the government can no longer pay its bills.\n\n\u201cThis is a really complicated scenario,\u201d Butterfill said, noting he doesn\u2019t think a default is likely. \u201cIt\u2019s not that obvious what exactly will happen.\u201d\n\nBitcoin May Bounce\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum could react differently in the event of a default, Amberdata\u2019s Magadini said. Bitcoin may bounce alongside gold after an initial slide\u2014as a check on government-issued currency\u2014while Ethereum would likely remain depressed alongside tech stocks, he said.\n\nThe sentiment was echoed by Genesis\u2019 Co-Head of Trading Gordon Grant, who told Decrypt that Bitcoin has more upside than Ethereum if the government can no longer meet its debt obligations, but both coins would face pressure initially.\n\n\u201cMaybe there's an initial wick down, as risk assets get absolutely trounced, because the stock market is going to get decimated,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Bitcoin is probably going higher.\u201d\n\nFor Ethereum, Grant said that the second largest crypto by market cap is often tied to indexes tracking tech stocks like the NASDAQ, making it likely to underperform compared to Bitcoin if a default takes place.\n\n\u201cIt doesn't matter whether I think that that's a fair comparison,\u201d he said, noting that that\u2019s how certain models trade the relationship between things like the NASDAQ and Ethereum. \u201cSo, we would tend to expect underperformance of Ethereum.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSVB and Sausage\n\nAs an example of how crypto has performed during recent risk-off events, Grant pointed to Bitcoin\u2019s outsized gains compared to Ethereum in the wake of several bank collapses in March, including Silicon Valley Bank. However, he noted that there\u2019s zero data to suggest how cryptocurrencies could react if the government defaults for the first time in history.\n\nBoth Grant and Magadini highlighted increased activity in the options market for Bitcoin as a potential default draws closer, saying it suggests that traders\u2014mostly institutional ones\u2014are betting the coin will see increased volatility.\n\nAt the end of the day, Grant said he\u2019s confident that lawmakers will exhaust their differences on Capitol Hill and reach an agreement like they always have. But, pointing to the logic of Bloomberg\u2019s Tom Keene, Grant said the bigger question is whether events like these become more common in an ever-more-polarized political climate, and if they\u2019ll ever go away.\n\n\u201cWe can ruminate and pontificate, but the real story is this phenomenon of the US government, as a debtor nation, bumping up against a debt ceiling,\u201d Grant said, adding it\u2019s become \u201chow the sausage gets made in the 21st century.\u201d"

        "title": "Can You Still Mine Ethereum? - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "The Ultimate Guide to Mining Ethereum in 2021: Can You Still Do It?\n\nCryptocurrency mining has been a popular and lucrative venture for many individuals over the years, and Ethereum (ETH) has been one of the most popular cryptocurrencies to mine.\n\nHowever, with the recent transition to proof of stake, many people wonder if mining Ethereum is still viable.\n\nIn this ultimate guide, we will explore the ins and outs of Ethereum mining, what the transition to proof of stake means for miners, and how to get started with mining Ethereum.\n\nIntroduction to Ethereum Mining\n\nEthereum mining is the process of verifying transactions on the Ethereum network and adding them to the blockchain. Miners are rewarded with a certain amount of Ethereum for each block they add to the blockchain.\n\nIn the early days of Ethereum, mining was done using graphics cards, and it was relatively easy for anyone with a computer to mine Ethereum and earn a profit.\n\nWhat Made Mining Ethereum So Popular?\n\nOne of the main reasons why mining Ethereum became so popular was its profitability. Miners could earn significant money by using their computing power to add blocks to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s use of smart contracts made it an attractive option for many people who were interested in blockchain technology.\n\nThe Transition to Proof of Stake\n\nIn December 2020, Ethereum began transitioning from proof of work to proof of stake. Proof of stake is a different consensus mechanism that requires validators to hold a certain amount of ETH to participate in the network.\n\nThe transition to proof of stake will make it more difficult for miners to earn rewards, as they will no longer receive block rewards for adding blocks to the blockchain.\n\nWhat Does This Mean for Ethereum Miners?\n\nThe transition to proof of stake means that miners can no longer earn rewards by adding blocks to the blockchain.\n\nInstead, they must become validators and hold a certain amount of ETH to participate in the network. This means that mining Ethereum will no longer be profitable for most people.\n\nHow Do I Start Mining Ethereum?\n\nIf you are still interested in mining ETH, there are a few things you will need to do to get started.\n\nFirst, you will need to understand the Ethereum blockchain and consensus mechanism. You will also need to have a certain amount of computing power to be able to mine Ethereum.\n\nYou will also need a private key to access your Ethereum rewards.\n\nUnderstanding the Blockchain and Consensus Mechanism\n\nThe ETH blockchain is a decentralized ledger that is used to record transactions on the Ethereum network. The consensus mechanism used by ETH is changing from proof of work to proof of stake.\n\nProof of work requires miners to use their computing power to solve complex mathematical problems to add blocks to the blockchain.\n\nOn the other hand, proof of stake requires validators to hold a certain amount of ETH to participate in the network.\n\nBlock Rewards and Ethereum 2.0\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nBlock rewards are miners\u2019 rewards for adding blocks to the blockchain. With the transition to proof of stake, block rewards will no longer be given to miners. Instead, validators will be rewarded with transaction fees.\n\nEthereum 2.0 is the new version of ETH that is being developed to support proof of stake. It is expected to launch in 2021 and will significantly change the network.\n\nThe Energy-Intensive Nature of Mining\n\nMining is an energy-intensive process that requires a lot of electricity. In fact, Ethereum mining consumes more energy than the entire country of Iceland. This has led to concerns about the environmental impact of Ethereum mining and has prompted many people to switch to more energy-efficient forms of cryptocurrency mining.\n\nMaximizing Profits: Reducing Electrical Costs and Transaction Fees\n\nIf you are still interested in mining Ethereum, there are a few things you can do to maximize your profits. One way to do this is by reducing your electrical costs. This can be done by using energy-efficient hardware and finding a cheap electricity source.\n\nAdditionally, you can reduce your transaction fees by using a mining pool.\n\nThe Future of ETH Mining: The Merge\n\nThe merge is the process by which they will transition from proof of work to proof of stake. It is expected to happen in 2023 and will significantly change the ETH network. The merge will make it more difficult for miners to earn rewards, as they will no longer receive block rewards for adding blocks to the blockchain.\n\nLong-Term Potential\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nWhile mining may no longer be profitable for most people, there is still long-term potential in investing in mining. As the network grows and evolves, there may be new opportunities for miners to earn rewards. Additionally, investing in mining can be a good way to support the ETH network and contribute to its development.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, mining Ethereum is no longer profitable for most people. The transition to proof of stake means that miners will no longer receive block rewards for adding blocks to the blockchain.\n\nHowever, there is still long-term potential for investing in mining.\n\nAs the network grows and evolves, there may be new opportunities for miners to earn rewards. Additionally, investing in mining can be a good way to support the Ethereum network and contribute to its development.\n\nIf you are interested in getting started with mining Ethereum, be sure to do your research and understand the risks involved. While it may no longer be a profitable venture, there are still opportunities to contribute to the ETH network and support its growth."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nGlobal financial services behemoth VISA recently shared a range of significant milestones in its ongoing pursuit of digital asset payments and seamless crypto onboarding.\n\nIn a blog titled \u201cRethinking Digital Transactions with Account Abstraction\u201d earlier this week, the firm disclosed it is now exploring how gas fees can be redesigned using Account Abstraction on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling secure and automatic payments for self-custodial wallets. It then added that it is deeply engaged in studying Ethereum\u2019s proposal ERC-4337 for digital payments.\n\nRolled out on the Ethereum mainnet in early March, ERC-4337 is a key component of VISA\u2019s exploration, as it adds the ability for smart contracts to transact on behalf of the user.\n\nThe firm also noted that it has successfully deployed two sets of Paymaster contracts on the Ethereum Goerli testnet, a move aimed at showcasing the potential for redesigning gas fees on the blockchain to improve user convenience. Mustafa Bedawala of Visa\u2019s crypto department observed that the firm\u2019s first paymaster contract is focused on investigating whether users can pay transaction fees with alternative tokens, like dollar stablecoins or, potentially, CBDCs apart from ETH.\n\n\u201cTo transact on the Ethereum blockchain today, a user needs to acquire ETH to pay for gas fees; similarly, to transact on Polygon blockchain, a user needs to acquire the native token MATIC. Is there a solution that eliminates the need to accumulate a different range of native blockchain tokens solely for the purpose of paying for gas?\u201d wrote Visa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe other paymaster contract is aimed at completely covering gas fees for user transactions, addressing a major pain point in the crypto space.\n\n\u201cAccount Abstraction offers a solution by allowing users to bypass these costs if a third party, such as a fintech wallet provider, is willing to cover them. In this case, the wallet provider or dApps can act as Paymasters, covering gas fees for users and significantly reducing friction. The ERC-4337 Paymaster concept can be a potential way to incentivize user adoption by making it free for users to transact through their wallet platform,\u201d the firm added.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has previously expressed his longstanding interest in gas fees Account Abstraction, calling it a dream of the Ethereum developer community. Buterin recommends the use of social recovery wallets and multi-signature wallets for crypto investors to achieve self-custody of their assets.\n\nThus, with the imminent implementation of ERC-4337 and the emergence of smart contract wallets, wallet security, as well as payments, are expected to improve significantly for VISA users opening doors to wider adoption of cryptocurrencies."

        "content": "Ethereum has held up better in Bitcoin\u2019s slipstream over the past few weeks than it did at the start of the year. The Ethereum price lost against Bitcoin in the first few weeks of 2023 and was able to keep up with Bitcoin again in the spring. With the Shanghai update, a more important step towards Ethereum 2.0 was recently taken. But how high is the potential for the Ethereum price in the coming years and is the $100,000 mark ever possible?\n\nHow has the Ethereum price moved in the last few weeks?\n\nThe Ethereum price has seen more of a sideways movement in the last few weeks. After strong gains in the first 6 weeks of the year and at the end of March, the Ether token price stabilized at a high level.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price in the last 30 days, source: gocharting.com\n\nWhile the Ethereum price was not able to rise as much as the Bitcoin price, especially in the first quarter of 2023, Ethereum has performed comparatively well in the second quarter so far as Bitcoin. In the last few weeks, the ETH price has mostly moved in the range between 1,800 and 1,850 US dollars.\n\nHow high can the ETH price rise in the coming years and decades?\n\nEthereum has existed since 2015 and has seen extremely strong price increases in the last 8 years . The next step for the Ethereum course would be a five-digit course and thus an increase to $ 10,000. Some analysts already saw this course in the last bull market. But in the coming bull market 2024 / 2025, Ethereum should be able to reach this value.\n\nHowever, it is difficult to predict whether the Ethereum price can continue to rise so strongly in the coming bull markets. For this, Ethereum would have to experience another adaptation. The Bitcoin course also has the Bitcoin Halvings a mathematical way to higher and higher courses. The Ethereum course should be able to keep up with the Bitcoin course in percentage terms or even increase more.\n\nIf Ethereum can continue to keep its promises in the coming years and decades, a price increase for the Ether token is still very likely. With a continuous growth of the network and more and more new applications and adaptations, the Ethereum price could increase as much as the Bitcoin price.\n\nCan Ethereum Price Ever Reach $100,000?\n\nThe question is whether the Ethereum price can actually reach $100,000 one day. The Bitcoin price should very likely be able to reach this value in the next bull market. Theoretically, there is nothing standing in the way of an Ethereum price of $100,000 in the coming bull markets.\n\nIf the Ethereum price ever reaches the $100,000 mark, this should probably not be the case for at least 10 years. This would be the bull market in the early 2030s, the third from now. At the moment it is extremely difficult to predict whether Ethereum can maintain this price development in the next 10 years. But the possibility still exists.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Blockchain"

        "content": "The year 2023 is shaping up to be a defining moment for Bitcoin Ordinals, as the world\u2019s first blockchain solidifies its position in the NFT market. While Ethereum has long held the top spot in terms of market capitalization, Bitcoin is now steadily climbing the ranks, vying to become the leading NFT blockchain. In fact, it has already secured the second position, demonstrating a rapid rise in popularity.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s NFT Sales Surge\n\nBitcoin has made significant strides in the NFT space, as reported by the NFT industry data aggregator CryptoSlam. It has not only secured a spot among the top ten all-time NFT blockchains by sales volume but has also witnessed a remarkable surge in revenue over the past month. During this period, Bitcoin\u2019s NFT sales volume surpassed that of its competitors, including Solana, with an impressive $169 million. Although Ethereum still holds the top spot with around $393 million, Bitcoin\u2019s ascent is undeniable.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s success in the NFT market is not solely attributed to uncategorized Ordinals. Various organized collection efforts have found success on the blockchain, notably Space Pepes and Bitcoin Frogs. These collections alone generated substantial sales volumes of $12 million and $9.6 million, respectively, in the past 30 days. Major brands and historical projects have also found a home on the Bitcoin blockchain, solidifying its position among the top NFT sales leaders.\n\nChallenging Ethereum\u2019s Dominance\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s position as the leading NFT blockchain is formidable, Bitcoin is gradually closing the gap. Ethereum has processed a staggering $390 million worth of on-chain NFT transactions in the last 30 days, while Bitcoin is approaching half that figure. This remarkable progress is a testament to the explosive popularity of Ordinals, which have transformed Bitcoin into a hub for art, movies, collectibles, tickets, and even video games.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin Ordinals and Inscriptions\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Ordinals protocol, developed by Casey Rodamor, assigns serial numbers to individual satoshis, the smallest unit of bitcoin. These serial numbers, similar to speciality serial numbers on dollar bills, have driven tremendous transaction fees to miners. Ordinals have become so influential that NFT traders have co-opted the term, referring to NFTs inscribed on a satoshi as \u201cordinals\u201d or \u201cinscriptions.\u201d Additionally, Bitcoin\u2019s BRC-20 standard enables the creation of tokens attached to Ordinals, opening up possibilities for DeFi, tokenization, and experimentation directly on Bitcoin.\n\nWill the Bitcoin Boom continue?\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s ascent in the NFT market is impressive, surpassing Ethereum will require significant trading activity. Ethereum\u2019s 38 million NFT transactions since inception dwarf Bitcoin\u2019s 320,000. However, with the growing popularity of Ordinals, the number of Bitcoin NFTs continues to spike month after month. The concept of a \u201cflippening,\u201d where Bitcoin overtakes Ethereum as the leading NFT blockchain, might not be as far-fetched as it seems.\n\nBitcoin is emerging as a powerful contender in the NFT market, challenging Ethereum\u2019s dominance. With its Ordinals gaining traction and a diverse range of collections finding success on the blockchain, Bitcoin has become the second-largest NFT blockchain. While Ethereum remains the frontrunner, the rapid rise of Bitcoin in NFT sales volume and its innovative use of Ordinals and inscriptions highlight its potential to reshape the NFT landscape. The future holds exciting possibilities for Bitcoin as it continues to make waves in the NFT space."

        "title": "a16z releases anonymous voting system for Ethereum - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Venture capital fund Andreessen Horowitz, also known as A16z, has released a Solidity library that can be used for anonymous voting on Ethereum. Called \u201cCicada,\u201d the library prevents an individual voter\u2019s choice from being known before polling ends. When combined with zero-knowledge group membership systems like Semaphore, it can also make the identity of the voter permanently unknowable, according to a May 24 blog post from A16z engineer Michael Zhu.\n\nExcited to announce Cicada: a new building block for private on-chain voting. https://t.co/hxE4KL4Se6 \u2014 moodle zoup (@moodlezoup) May 24, 2023\n\nCicada relies on time-lock puzzles, a type of cryptography that allows users to encrypt secret values that can only be decrypted after a specific period of time has passed, Zhu stated.\n\nThese puzzles have been around since 1996. But before 2019, they would have required users to reveal their secret values once the time period had passed. In voting systems, this could have caused problems with users submitting votes and then going offline, preventing all the votes from being countable.\n\nIn 2019, the concept of \u201chomomorphic\u201d time-lock puzzles was proposed by cryptographers Giulio Malavolta and Aravind Thyagarajan. This allowed the puzzles to be added together to produce a final puzzle that was much easier to solve than the sum of the individual puzzles. The solution to the final puzzle reveals only the sum of the individual values without revealing the individual values making up this sum.\n\nAccording to the A16z post, Cicada uses these homomorphic puzzles, allowing votes to be counted even if users go offline.\n\nWhen attempting to transfer Malavolta and Thyagarajan\u2019s system to the blockchain, A16z researchers ran into an obstacle to creating a fair voting system: Each choice needed to be encoded as a boolean value of \u201c1\u201d or \u201c0.\u201d This meant that attackers could try to increase their voting power by incorrectly encoding the vote \u2014 by encoding \u201c100\u201d as their value, for example.\n\nTo solve this problem, Cicada requires voters to submit a zero-knowledge proof of ballot validity along with each ballot, the post said. The proof shows that the vote was encoded correctly, but without revealing the contents of the vote.\n\nRelated: Anchorage Digital opens up DeFi voting for custody clients\n\nCicada only prevents votes from being known while the poll is being conducted. Once the \u201cpoll has closed\u201d or the time-lock period has passed, any person can determine the contents of a vote by brute-forcing the solution to the puzzle. However, A16z suggested that this problem can be solved by combining Cicada with zero-knowledge group membership systems like Semaphore, Semacaulk or zero-knowledge state proofs. In this case, brute forcing the puzzle will only reveal that the vote was cast by an eligible voter but will not reveal the credentials used to prove the voter\u2019s eligibility.\n\nAs an example, Zhu provided a link to a sample contract produced using Cicada that also relies on Semaphore to prove voter eligibility.\n\nVoting systems have long been a component of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), the governing bodies that often manage blockchain apps. But in most cases, DAOs use tokens to represent votes, which means that individual users can have an outsized influence if they hold a large number of tokens. For example, on May 22, an attacker took control of Tornado Cash by casting extra votes on a malicious proposal, using it to drain all of the governance contract\u2019s funds. The attacker later offered to give back control to users.\n\nWaves founder Sasha Ivanov has argued that DAOs must move to a more democratic voting system if governance attacks like these are to be avoided."

The Render Network is a decentralized platform that enables users to contribute their unused GPU power to render motion graphics and VFX.\n\nRNDR has been trending on Twitter this week thanks to its recent partnership with Apple and its integration with Solana.

        "title": "Can Ethereum Overtake Bitcoin? - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "They are the two pillars on which the industry is currently standing. Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) have become two names synonymous with crypto and have risen to prominence as networks that are rivaled by few. Yet, with one clearly in front, could Ethereum ever truly overtake Bitcoin?\n\nFor anyone who has ever embraced blockchain technology or even inquired about it, these are probably the first two names you have heard. Yet, for as prominent as they both are, Bitcoin remains the standard bearer as the highest-priced crypto on the market. However, as Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the top two cryptocurrencies by market cap, could a change of guard ever truly take place?\n\nCould a Flip Ever Happen?\n\nSource: The Street\n\nEthereum is a protocol developed by Vitalik Buterin that has been among the most popular in the industry. Moreover, it has consistently been building on its own infrastructure and ecosystem to develop a highly sought-after blockchain network.\n\nAlternatively, Bitcoin is credited as the first cryptocurrency. Launched in 2009 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, it started it all. Thus, it has a kind of head start on all of its competition. However, Ethereum has consistently been on its tail and could justify a flip at some point.\n\nThe bull run of 2021 saw Bitcoin\u2019s market cap exceed the $1.2 trillion mark. It was a significant moment in history, and it was followed up by 2022\u2019s ravenous crypto winter. Contextually, Ethereum saw a rally to a $500 billion market cap that was equally impressive as BTC. However, the same treacherous 2022 saw it retreat below the $200 billion mark.\n\nMoreover, these kinds of discussions have been taking place for years within the industry. Creating two sides of the aisle: those who believe it could be done and those who do not. However, there is an inherent belief that if it were to be possible, it would require Ethereum to surpass Bitcoin in market cap.\n\nThat prospect seems incredibly far-fetched considering the positions of both, but is it impossible?\n\nCurrently, both assets are still first and second in overall market cap, respectively. Specifically, Ethereum has a market cap of $215 billion, while Bitcoin has a market cap of $509 billion.\n\nSubsequently, the difference is astounding, which makes the premise of a potential flip even more interesting. Ethereum would have to more than double its market cap in order to surpass Bitcoin. Thus, it would need to execute that step to eventually overtake it. Is it possible?\n\nEthereum (ETH) Functionality\n\nSource: Redot.com\n\nThe primary hope that lies in Ethereum\u2019s prospect of overtaking Bitcoin is in its functionality. There were many who thought that the highly publicized Merge event could make ETH some headway. Specifically, its transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism\n\nAlthough the development did not flip the script, it presents the greatest chance that the protocol has. Bitcoin is primarily utilized as a wealth tool for investors, and that is the reason for its catapulting value since its inception. Alternatively, Ethereum is a programmable blockchain, that has become a haven for crypto developers.\n\nThus, as the industry continues to move forward and evolve, Ethereum has positioned itself at the forefront. The Ethereum blockchain has already been the preferred network for advanced decentralized applications and smart contracts which continue to enhance the pool of developers flocking to the platform.\n\nThere have been 3,000 dApps constructed on Ethereum, with statistics showing that the trend is likely to continue upward. Subsequently, as the entire Web3 ecosystem continues to develop and grow, much of that progression is taking place on Ethereum. Therefore, it is important to note that Bitcoin\u2019s age could make it unable to match the utility provided by ETH.\n\nEthereum\u2019s smart contract capabilities are at its core. In 2015, the functionality where added, and more than 3,900 developers joined the ecosystem in 2021. Thus, it had appropriately been perceived as the most active blockchain on the planet. Still, that growth is only continuing, not only with the Merge in 2022 but with the recently integrated Shanghai upgrade.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Current Status\n\nSource: News18\n\nAlthough its functionality is certainly an aspect that it excels at, Ethereum does boast a host of competitors. Moreover, alternatives have emerged to challenge ETH in the avenue of functionality. Leading to protocols like Solana being labeled \u201cEthereum Killers.\u201d\n\nConversely, although utility can breed competition, there is no competitor that can beat Bitcoin at being first. Moreover, the adoption and status that BTC has embraced since its development has granted it something that no other digital asset may ever be able to replicate.\n\nThe headstart it got over every alternative presents a nearly impenetrable lead over the competition. Subsequently, Ethereum potentially overtaking Bitcoin is something that could happen, but certainly not anytime soon.\n\nAdditionally, as fiat currency continues to be threatened by macroeconomic factors, Bitcoin only grows in necessity. The wealthy remain attached to the asset as the US dollar falls, and international tensions over currency mount. Bitcoin is poised to present a relatively safe alternative as an asset fixed in value."

        "content": "One of the biggest selling points of Solana\u2019s ecosystem is its low cost of utility for NFTs, especially when compared to its gas guzzling rival, Ethereum.\n\nBut even on the svelte blockchain platform, development still requires funding.\n\nIn an effort to cover some of these costs, dominant Solana NFT protocol Metaplex introduced a controversial network fee in its \u201cToken Metadata immutability plan,\u201d resulting in angry calls for forks and general discontent among its community.\n\nFollowing the backlash, Metaplex promptly back-pedaled from initial plans, removing some, but not all of the proposed fees. The company stated via Twitter that updates, verifications, freezes and thaws would remain free as costs \u201ccould prohibit important and emergent use cases.\u201d\n\nCo-hosts Garrett Harper and Santiago Santos discussed the fee furor and the possibility that it might draw some developers back to Ethereum in a Blockworks interview on the Empire podcast.\n\nMetaplex as a public good\n\nHarper notes that Metaplex \u201cspun out of Solana Labs,\u201d raising $46 million, which he estimates is the third-largest raise in Solana\u2019s ecosystem from an individual project.\n\n\u201cI think people thought, in general, this was gonna be a public good.\u201d\n\nVirtually all Solana NFTs \u2014 around 99.9% according to a company blog post \u2014 adopted the Metaplex standard, Harper says, \u201cbut the issue is now that they\u2019re adding fees on top of this, people are like, okay, we\u2019re gonna have to fork this.\u201d\n\nProblem being, that\u2019s not really a feasible solution, Harper explains. \u201cThey have a license where it says it\u2019s open source, but you can\u2019t actually fork it\u201d to alleviate the fee problem.\n\nStephen Hess, the CEO of Metaplex, previously told Blockworks that \u201c\u200b\u200bit\u2019s acceptable under the license for anyone to fork Metaplex programs even for a competitive use case, provided the fork isn\u2019t removing, replacing or modifying the fees.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s used by all these NFTs. It\u2019s adopted by the exchanges and also wallets,\u201d Harper says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually a lot of work to build and maintain the code,\u201d he says, suggesting the company needs at least some fees to sustain a viable business model.\n\nIn a follow-up tweet, the company explains that proceeds from creator fees \u201cwill be used to fund dev work on the Token Metadata immutability roadmap as well as the broader suite of Metaplex programs (Candy Machine, Auction House, Compressed NFTs) and dev tools (SDKs, Amman, Umi, Solita).\u201d\n\nWill fees hinder development?\n\nHarper explains that one of the problems for Solana, when compared to Ethereum, is that it lacks protocol standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721. \u201cSo today, the program\u2019s just set by Metaplex and that\u2019s what\u2019s become the standard.\u201d\n\nSantos wonders if the fee introduction might hinder NFT development on the competing platform. Such a move, he says, \u201cdegrades the interest in the broader Solana ecosystem of onboarding users.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut at the same time, public goods need to be funded in some capacity.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re adding the taxation layer on top of it,\u201d Santos says, which \u201cadds another layer of difficulty when you\u2019re trying to tell projects and users that they\u2019re gonna be taxed for something that they\u2019re usually not used to being taxed on in other ecosystems like Ethereum.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt becomes an even greater problem of competition and really low barriers to entry,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re a new NFT project, this actually changes the landscape of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the cool things about Solana,\u201d Santos observes, is that \u201cthey do move so fast, and that\u2019s one of their core advantages. But you can see an issue in scenarios like this where that can actually be a bad thing.\u201d\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s mainnet development moves at a much slower pace than Solana\u2019s, layer-2 developments offer low-cost and rapidly evolving solutions, which \u201callows Ethereum to still innovate in a very quick way without having to do that at the protocol level,\u201d Santos says.\n\n\u201cAnd with that, you\u2019re not gonna have issues with this.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have held steady as billions worth of options contracts expired this morning.\n\nThe leading cryptocurrency rose 1% early Friday morning, while ETH jumped 1.6%.\n\nBitcoin is now trading at $26,509, down 11% over the past 30 days. Over that same period, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has dropped 4.6%.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToday, Bitcoin options on Deribit expired this morning with a notional value of $2.26 billion and $1.25 billion for Ethereum, inducing uncertainty in the market.\n\nNotional value refers to the total number of outstanding option orders in the market that have yet to expire.\n\nThe Bitcoin options market had a put-to-call ratio of 0.44. Similarly, for ETH, every put option had two call open options opened. This suggests that traders mostly held bullish positions, which is likely why the price reacted negatively before the expiry.\n\nAn option call contract is a financial derivative that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy a specific asset\u2014in this case, Bitcoin\u2014at a predetermined price. A put option gives the holder the right to sell.\n\nWhen an investor purchases a call option, they are essentially betting that the price of the underlying asset will rise above the strike price before the option expires. The strike price represents the pre-determined price at which the option is bought.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor instance, a May call option for a strike price of $27,000 would mean that for the buyer to turn a profit, the price must be higher than $27,000 at its expiration.\n\nUsually, the market has a tendency to fluctuate toward maximum pain point close to option expiration. The max pain point for today\u2019s expiration event was $27,000 for Bitcoin and $1,800 for Ethereum, roughly current prices.\n\nThe maximum pain point for Bitcoin May options contract on Deribit. Source: Deribit\n\nThe maximum pain point in the options market refers to the price level when options buyers will incur maximum losses.\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum low liquidity takes hold\n\nIt was expected that the current low-liquidity market conditions would have exacerbated the impact of the options expiration event.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s liquidity dried up in Q2 2023 due to events such as the end of Binance\u2019s zero-fee trading program, the banking crises, and macroeconomic issues like the ongoing debt-ceiling debate in the United States.\n\nCo-founder of crypto research outlet Jarvis Labs Ben Lilly measured the decline in liquidity using the cumulative volume delta (CVD) metric for spot and futures markets. CVD measures the cumulative change in the volume of buy and sell orders as the price moves.\n\nIt\u2019s used to analyze the flow of volume and can provide insights into the strength or weakness of a trend or price movement.\n\nLilly found that the spot CVD has declined dramatically since mid-April, indicating that traders are not showing any interest in driving the prices higher or lower.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAdding to the options expiration event, Lilly added that once May contracts expire, the market\u2019s attention will turn toward June, which are currently showing a maximum pain level of $24,000 for Bitcoin and $1,600 for Ethereum.\n\n\u201cOnce this unwind for May takes place and contracts expire, we\u2019re now looking at June and the structure should be changing, which points to a pullback toward $24,000,\u201d wrote Lilly.\n\nBiyond Capital\u2019s lead trader Nathan Batchelor echoed the above analysis.\n\n\u201cIn low volume, low liquidity trading conditions such as now it is also possible the options actions could drive price volatility,\u201d he told Decrypt. \u201cMost of the high volume puts are seen around $25,250 so be careful of more downside on Friday if $25,850 is breached.\u201d\n\nDeribit analysts agreed with the possibility of a bout of volatility based on the historically low reading of short-term implied volatility, which preceded a market rally in January 2023.\n\nImplied volatility is a measure of the market's expectation of the future volatility or price fluctuations of an underlying asset.\n\nDeribit\u2019s chief commercial officer Luuk Strijers told Decrypt that while the previous instance resulted in an upside, it \u201ccould have been a market crash as well.\u201d\n\nHe expects the short-term volatility to rise and reduce the difference with long-term implied volatility to reinstate the sentiment that \u201clower volatility in Bitcoin is here to stay\u201d before traders can confidently begin long-term accumulation or distribution.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "title": "Ethereum Continues System Stability Upgrades Despite Recent Block Finality Incidents - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe Ethereum protocol recently experienced two incidents in which its Beacon Chain stopped finalizing blocks. This occurred on May 11, 2023, when the network was unable to fully confirm transactions for about 20 minutes and again on May 12, 2023, for over an hour.\n\nGenerally, block finality refers to a state where a supermajority of validators have attested to the final state of the blockchain, guaranteeing that a block and its processed transactions cannot be modified or eliminated from the blockchain.\n\nBlock finality implies that a block of data has been added to a blockchain with some negligible probability of being reversed or altered. Blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum show probabilistic transaction finality in that transactions are not automatically or instantly final, but the probability of being reversed decreases as more blocks are added to the chain.\n\nDuring the two finality incidents, Ethereum end users successfully continued to transact on-chain through the incident. Ethereum Developers released patches to resolve the block finality incidents but said an analysis was underway to determine the root cause of the problem.\n\nIn a May 21, 2023 blog, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin cautioned against overloading Ethereum consensus beyond its core functions of validating blocks and securing the network, as this could bring high systemic risks to the ecosystem. In the same blog, Buterin called for preserving the chain\u2019s minimalism and helping developers find alternate strategies to achieve their security goals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Ethereum protocol has undergone several major upgrades and improvement plans to make it more robust and reliable.\n\nIn September 2022, the Merge upgrade was implemented. In the Merge, the Ethereum protocol moved from its original proof-of-work mechanism to a proof-of-stake mechanism. The merge aimed to make the Ethereum protocol less energy-intensive, more secure, and better suited to implementing new scaling solutions.\n\nIn November 2022, Buterin outlined an updated Ethereum protocol roadmap in line with its vision of enhancing scalability, security, and sustainability. Buterin said that the Ethereum protocol is undergoing several system upgrades and will ultimately enter a state of relative stability that optimizes safety and predictability.\n\nAccording to Buterin, the Ethereum protocol roadmap consists of six parallel running upgrades: the Merge, the Surge, the Scourge, the Verge, the Purge, and the Splurge.\n\nAnother upgrade known as the Ethereum \u2018Shapella\u2019 upgrade was implemented in April 2023. The Shapella upgrade enabled stakers to unstake ETH and validators to withdraw previously staked ETH. The Shapella upgrade was implemented with other Ethereum Improvement Proposals, including reducing gas fees during peak network periods."

        "content": "Bitcoin NFTs Surpass Solana but Ethereum Retains Top Spot\n\nBitcoin NFTs monthly trading volume exceeded Solana this month, despite Ethereum still holding the top spot with an NFT volume of $393 million (double Bitcoin\u2019s 30-day volume starting April 23). Nevertheless, Bitcoin now overrides notable blockchains like Solana, Polygon, ImmutableX and BNB Chain \u2014 a remarkable achievement for these recently launched collectibles.\n\nOver recent months, the NFT market observed a shift in media-based Bitcoin ordinals, otherwise known as Bitcoin NFTs. Following this success, the popular Bitcoin NFT marketplace, Magic Eden, is competing with UniSat\u2019s volume, the world\u2019s first open-source browser extension wallet for Bitcoin NFTs.\n\nThe implementation of #Bitcoin ordinals spurred NFT activity on $BTC. Over the past 30 days #Bitcoin has seen the second most NFT sales volume among all blockchains: h/t @cryptoslamio pic.twitter.com/q8qnHCcLfD \u2014 Osprey Funds (@OspreyFunds) May 23, 2023\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin\n\nOn the flip side, Bitcoin Frogs has been boosting Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume. For example, Bitcoin Frog #2276 sold for 0.2 BTC ($5388.72) on Magic Eden on May 19. Significant sales like this one have led to the \u201ccrypto amphibians\u201d overriding Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), which only recorded $40 million in trading volume from April 23 to May 23. Regardless, the Bitcoin NFT ecosystem continues to lag behind Ethereum.\n\nOne of the critical reasons Ethereum remains at the peak for monthly trading volume includes holding numerous notable NFT projects: BAYC, Azuki, CryptoPunks and Milady Maker. BAYC and Azuki are NFTs associated with popular metaverse projects, whereas CryptoPunks and Miladys are in high demand due to having limited availability and early market entry. In addition, the blockchain network also supports numerous DAOs and integration benefits, stimulating the decentralized finance ecosystem to be worth $27.5 billion.\n\nDespite Milady already having a name for itself in the NFT realm, this month, the NFT collectibles noticed a rapid surge due to Elon Musk tweeting one of the customized PFPs, assisting Ethereum to continue claiming the prime position.\n\nAs the exciting NFT space continues to shift, progressing developments represent the unpredictability and potential of this blockchain-driven creative space.\n\nWant more?

        "content": "The Tornado Cash DAO Hacker has begun to move the stolen Ethereum (ETH) and Torn (TORN) tokens. On Wednesday night, 100 ether (ETH) and 38,000 torn (TORN) tokens were moved by addresses connected to the hacker. According to Etherscan data, the hacker used the Tornado Cash protocol for the movement.\n\nAn unnamed attacker, or attackers, took control of the DAO responsible for the privacy-focused crypto mixer\u2019s operations on Saturday. The hacker also took control of the DAO\u2019s funds and future plans. The attacker continues to have access to potentially all of Tornado Cash\u2019s treasury cash and currently has over 20 ether ($35,684) in their wallet.\n\nA fraudulent proposal was put out by the attacker, hiding a computer function that gave them a fake governance vote. Some components of Tornado Cash, including torn tokens held in the primary governance contract, were accessed using fake votes, and also the stolen Ethereum. The hacker could also withdraw locked torn tokens.\n\nHowever, the Tornado Cash protocol itself is unaffected by the attack. Moreover, this assault did not take advantage of any smart contracts or other Tornado Cash-related technology.\n\nTornado Cash users sue the U.S. Treasure amid haker moving stolen Ethereum\n\nSix Tornado Cash users have sued the U.S. Treasury for sanctioning the platform. As per the users, the sanctions violate the First Amendment. The plaintiffs contend that the Treasury lacks the jurisdiction to impose the mixer\u2019s ban. Additionally, they claim that banning Tornado Cash infringes on the First Amendment\u2019s protection of free expression. The individuals used open-source software to protect their privacy. According to the filing, punishing the crypto mixing platform is against US individuals\u2019 fundamental rights.\n\nAs per the law which banned Tornado Cash, only a property might be blocked. However, the legal definition of a property is something that can be owned. But no one is able to own, manage, or alter the privacy-focused software. Founders, developers, and those who just so happen to have TORN in their wallets cannot alter or control the platform.\n\nLast year, the US Treasury imposed restrictions on Tornado Cash under the pretext that the firm was being used to finance terrorism and enable money laundering."

        "content": "As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Tradecurve have captured the attention of analysts and investors. With Ethereum\u2019s prominence, XRP\u2019s unique features, and Tradecurve\u2019s disruptive potential, confidence in these digital assets is growing.\n\n>>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Prediction\n\nEthereum has long been the second-largest player in the crypto space, pioneering the concept of smart contracts and decentralized applications. Its token, ETH, is intrinsically tied to these operations, powering the transactions and creations on its blockchain.\n\nRecently, Ethereum price action has formed a falling wedge pattern, indicating a potential for breakout. However, the journey towards bullishness seems to be at the mercy of Bitcoin (BTC) due to Ethereum\u2019s correlation with it.\n\nPresently, selling pressure from the 50-day EMA at $1,841 has increased, which could lead the Ethereum price to break below the immediate support confluence between the lower boundary of the downtrend line and the 100-day EMA at $1,768. Subsequently, Ethereum could experience a drop to the 200-day EMA at $1,686. Here, buyer momentum may provoke a rebound.\n\nRecent Developments: XRP\u2019s Resilience and Flexibility\n\nXRP, also known as XRP Ledger, presents a distinct set of characteristics that make it an intriguing digital asset. With a current live price of $0.466627, XRP holds a significant market position, ranking sixth in terms of market capitalization.\n\nThe XRP Ledger, in operation since 2012, has demonstrated reliability in bridging traditional finance with blockchain technology. It offers a low-cost, fast, and scalable blockchain solution, enabling transactions to settle within seconds.\n\nXRP\u2019s resilience and flexibility have been highlighted in recent news. Despite challenges faced by the cryptocurrency market, XRP has maintained its position and showcased its potential for long-term growth. Additionally, XRP\u2019s role in facilitating cross-border transactions and its potential integration with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) further bolstered its appeal.\n\nWith the growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi), XRP\u2019s unique features and scalability make it an attractive option for users seeking efficient and cost-effective transactions.\n\nThe recent developments in the XRP ecosystem highlight its resilience and adaptability in the evolving crypto landscape. Analysts remain optimistic about XRP\u2019s future, predicting sustained growth and continued innovation within the XRP ecosystem.\n\nTradecurve (TCRV): Disrupting the Trading Landscape\n\nLike XRP and Ethereum, Tradecurve is emerging as a disruptive force in the cryptocurrency market. With its innovative approach to decentralized trading, Tradecurve aims to transform the way assets are traded. By leveraging blockchain technology, Tradecurve provides a secure, transparent, and efficient platform for users to engage in trading activities. The decentralized nature of Tradecurve eliminates the need for intermediaries and reduces transaction\n\nOne of the standout features of Tradecurve is its permissionless platform that allows users to connect their wallets, deposit cryptocurrencies, and trade freely without the need for extensive Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements. This enables traders to maintain their privacy while engaging in various trading activities\n\nAlso, as Tradecurve prepares for its launch, it is currently conducting a presale to raise funds and generate support for its vision. With a total fixed supply of 1.8 billion TCRV tokens, the presale offers an opportunity for early adopters to acquire tokens at a discounted price. Moreover, the surge in its presale is 50x, while the launch is 100x.\n\nFinally, tradecurve presents an exciting opportunity for traders and investors looking for a platform that combines the best aspects of centralized and decentralized exchanges. With its unique features, emphasis on privacy, and anticipated price surge during the presale and launch, Tradecurve has garnered significant attention within the crypto community.\n\nFor more information about TCRV presale tokens:\n\nWebsite: https://tradecurve.io/\n\nBuy presale: https://app.tradecurve.io/sign-up\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/tradecurve_official\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nCircle, a well-known stablecoin issuer, has released the Euro Coin on the Avalanche network, marking a huge extension beyond its Ethereum basis, in a bold move intended to increase stablecoin accessibility.\n\nCircle hopes to develop a multi-chain presence for its Euro Coin by utilising the Avalanche blockchain, giving consumers more alternatives and boosting the stablecoin\u2019s acceptance. The selection of Avalanche, a platform renowned for its scalability and low transaction costs, demonstrates Circle\u2019s drive to innovation and its commitment to offering customers a wide variety of options.\n\nThe partnership between Circle and Avalanche is an important point in the evolution of stablecoin ecosystems. The technical team at Circle worked closely with Avalanche to make sure that the Euro Coin was integrated into the new blockchain without any issues. The safe connection between the Avalanche blockchain and the Euro Coin allows for quick transactions while preserving the usefulness and stability of the digital asset.\n\nThe cryptocurrency community has paid close attention to the introduction of the Euro Coin on Avalanche. This action not only solidifies Circle\u2019s position as a market leader in stablecoins but also demonstrates its commitment to going beyond Ethereum.\n\nIn a press release, Joao Reginatto, VP of Product at Circle, stated: \u201cBy launching Euro Coin on Avalanche\u2019s fast and efficient platform, we can help developers and their users experience near-instant, more cost-effective financial transactions and unlock new possibilities for payments, remittances and 24/7 FX.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a result of its expansion onto Avalanche, Circle now has access to the fast-expanding Avalanche ecosystem, enabling strategic alliances with ongoing initiatives and encouraging fresh partnerships. The Euro Coin is widely accepted inside the Avalanche network and is interoperable, positioning it as a reliable medium of trade and piquing interest from both businesses and investors.\n\nOther stablecoin issuers will be inspired to venture beyond their initial blockchain foundations by Circle\u2019s ground-breaking action, which serves as a model for others. The introduction of the Euro Coin on Avalanche highlights the sector\u2019s dedication to innovation and blockchain compatibility.\n\nThe development of the Euro Coin on the Avalanche network sets the path for a more durable and connected future for stablecoins. With more options for users and a drive towards a multi-chain ecosystem, this development pushes the limits of stablecoin acceptance.\n\nWith increasing collaboration, innovation, and more opportunities within the cryptocurrency environment, Circle\u2019s Euro Coin on Avalanche represents a significant development in the stablecoin market. This revelation reverberates as evidence of the persistent pursuit of advancement within the digital asset space, where limitations are persistently pushed to create a more inclusive and stable financial ecosystem."

And all this happens from the security of your own crypto wallet. That\u2019s right. You don\u2019t have to transfer your crypto onto a centralized exchange to trade. Also cool. Decentralized exchanges don\u2019t have withdrawal fees, withdrawal limits, or pesky trading rules that benefit the exchange rather than the traders. You know\u2014by the people, for the people.

This clever protocol matches swaps without using liquidity pools whenever possible. If there isn\u2019t anyone else who wants to swap the same tokens, then CoW Swap becomes a DEX aggregator, helping you find the best deal elsewhere. Nice. CoW Swap also supports limit orders, so you can just wait for the right price.

Bots run around the internet looking for profitable trades that haven\u2019t been validated yet. Then, these diabolical bots duplicate the trade with a higher gas fee, jumping ahead in line. The result: a sub-optimal trade for you \u2014 and profits for the bot. It\u2019s called Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), and CoW prevents this from happening by executing peer-to-peer trades as well as using batch auctions. Who is CoW Swap Good For? Ethereum users: For now, CoW Swap is mostly an Ethereum thing. Gnosis is also supported, but Abritrum, Polygon, and Optimism users have to swap elsewhere. Mooo.\n\nFor now, CoW Swap is mostly an Ethereum thing. Gnosis is also supported, but Abritrum, Polygon, and Optimism users have to swap elsewhere. Mooo.

It looks a lot like Uniswap but pulls swap options from a plethora of DEXs. There\u2019s a reason it\u2019s so popular: In the background, 1inch is actually breaking up your trade (if needed) to prevent price spikes and get you the most tokens in your swap. The bad news: US users are in a \u201crestricted jurisdiction\u201d and can\u2019t use the service.

You\u2019ll still get limit orders for precise trades, but you\u2019ll also get the ability to do cross-blockchain swaps (but you can\u2019t do both at once). CoW Swap: Ethereum peeps will love CoW Swap, the DEX that lets you keep your ETH. Many trades can even be done without using a DEX through CoW Swap\u2019s peer-to-peer trades.\n\nHow Do DEXs Work?\n\nA DEX holds a pool of tokens that traders can swap. Sometimes the pool holds just two types of crypto, like ETH and GMX, or sometimes they hold several types of tokens. If you had ETH and wanted to buy GMX, you could swap your ETH for GMX and vice versa.\n\nWhere do these pool tokens come from? Well, they come from other traders who want to earn a yield by providing liquidity to the pool. Liquidity just means the ability to trade. Without a pool, there\u2019s nothing to trade, and what fun is that? Liquidity providers are key to the system.\n\nSome DEXs take a cut of the swap fees generated by the DEX, with the bulk of earnings going to the liquidity providers. But this doesn\u2019t mean DEX fees are high. Uniswap, the top DEX by volume, charges a 0.3% fee on swaps. That\u2019s less than you\u2019ll pay to trade on Coinbase, and you don\u2019t have to move your tokens onto a third-party platform to trade. Your tokens never leave your comfy crypto wallet until you confirm the swap in your wallet.\n\nAnother benefit: DEXs have hard\u2013to\u2013find tokens that haven\u2019t made it onto major exchanges yet.\n\nHow Do DEXs Make Money?\n\nSome DEXs take a cut of the fees collected on the platform\u2014but not all DEXs. For example, Uniswap doesn\u2019t take a cut of fees. The 0.3% fee collected on Uniswap goes to the liquidity providers.\n\nBy contrast, Alium Finance takes a sliver of the fees for the treasury.\n\nDEXs work on a governance model, meaning that people who hold governance tokens can vote on future changes to the DEX. If the community votes for the DEX to keep a percentage of fees, the developers make it happen.\n\nIn other cases, like limit orders on CoW Swap, the trade executes with a small price buffer. The exchange or treasury keeps the spare change.\n\nIn general, the bulk of earnings typically goes to the liquidity providers, who are just traders like the rest of us. It\u2019s a much different model compared to centralized exchanges, where the exchange keeps 100% of trading fees.\n\nAutomated Market Makers\n\nMost DEXs use a mechanism called automated market makers (AMMs) to calculate the swap exchange rate. The goal of an AMM is to keep the pool balanced. If the trade volume only went one way, the pool would quickly be drained of one of its tokens. For instance, in an ETH/GMX pair, the GMX tokens would go to zero while ETH piles up. No more trades for you. And no reason for liquidity providers to fund pools.\n\nAutomated market makers are designed to always provide liquidity (at any price). They do this by increasing or decreasing the price of swapped tokens based on demand in the pool. Under the hood, there\u2019s a constant product formula at work that calculates the exchange rate for each swap.\n\nLet\u2019s say you have a pool with ETH and MANA, the token for the Decentraland metaverse. Most DEXs require liquidity providers to fund the pool with a 50/50 split. Based on current prices, that would be 1 ETH to 2775.36 MANA.\n\nAs traders swap ETH to load up on MANA, the price of MANA in the pool increases and the price of ETH decreases to keep the pool value balanced. The creeping price of MANA in this example is called price impact, a price variance compared to the starting value. It\u2019s something to watch out for on DEXs. Smaller pools can see a BIG difference in price as you buy more of a token from the pool.\n\nHere\u2019s an example from Uniswap where the swap would have caused a HUGE price impact.\n\nCurrently, ETH is at $1,776, which means the swap should yield about 1,723 USDC (a stablecoin pegged to $1) after the 0.3% fee. Instead, we get only $653 USDC. Why? Because the swap is draining the small supply of USDC \u2014 and the AMM is raising the price of each additional USDC token. Liquidity at any price, remember?\n\nJust like in diving, deeper pools are better\u2014and be careful about (price) impacts.\n\nThis is an extreme example, but the price for swaps can get a bit slushy compared to precise price limit orders on centralized exchanges that use order books.\n\nRemember, others are trading from the same liquidity pool, so prices can change for that reason as well. (The AMM adjusts prices to keep the pool balanced.) Most DEXs let you set the slippage, which helps keep your trade value closer to the DEX price quote when your trade executes. If the slippage value isn\u2019t set, there\u2019s no telling how much you\u2019ll pay. Who likes surprises? But if you set the slippage too low, the transaction might fail \u2014 leaving you with nothing but the tokens you started with and a pile of fees.\n\nSome DEXs use order books instead of AMMs. Let\u2019s have a look.\n\nOrder Book DEXs\n\nFixed prices on a DEX? How does that even work? It\u2019s possible, and here\u2019s how: Buyers and sellers submit orders to the DEX. Essentially, the orders are contracts to buy or sell a fixed quantity of tokens at a fixed price. This creates a book of orders. Sellers on the top, buyers on the bottom. If you\u2019ve traded stocks or traded crypto on an advanced trading platform, it should look pretty familiar.\n\n(Crescent DEX on Cosmos)\n\nWith a book of open orders, traders can trade with more precision. At a glance, you can see the open orders and available quantities.\n\nA market order fills your order from the existing orders on the exchange\u2019s order book.\n\nfills your order from the existing orders on the exchange\u2019s order book. A limit order adds your order to the book.\n\nIf your limit order is within the trading range, there\u2019s a good chance that market order traders will take some or all of your position, Or, your order might be matched up with another limit order on the other side of the trade. Awesome. There\u2019s also a chance it might sit there forever, unmatched, like a shy teen at a high school dance. Yeah, that can happen if the trading range moves.\n\nTrading book DEXs are shiny, new stuff. The largest DEXs still use AMMs to manage swaps, which means you might not find less common tokens on order book DEXs, at least not yet. There just aren\u2019t as many buyers and sellers. But that\u2019s likely to change over time, giving traders the option of using either type of DEX (AMM or Order Book).\n\nYou may not need to use an order book DEX to get a precise trade. ParaSwap, OpenOcean, and CoW Swap are just a few DEXs that offer limit orders so you can set your own price.\n\nDEX Aggregators\n\nRemember when we talked about price impact and the effect AAMs can have on prices? It\u2019d be cool if someone came up with a way to just find the best deal. Cool indeed, and that\u2019s what DEX aggregators do.\n\nHere\u2019s OpenOcean searching for the best deal on RDNT to ETH.\n\nDEX aggregators query the DEXs scattered all over the internet, so you don\u2019t have to try the trade on each one manually. Some DEX aggregators show you a list of options. Others, like OpenOcean and 1inch, just show you the best swap available.\n\nMultichain DEXs/Layer 2 Support\n\nIt\u2019s a big multichain crypto world out there, and DEXs can help you make swaps on multiple blockchains.\n\nLayer 2 Support: Most of the larger DEXs support multiple blockchains, meaning you can make swaps on Ethereum, Polygon, Abitrum, or others. Layer 2 blockchain chains offer faster and cheaper transactions compared to Ethereum. But what if you have tokens on Network A that you want to swap for tokens on Network B? That\u2019s where Cross-chain DEXs come in.\n\nMost of the larger DEXs support multiple blockchains, meaning you can make swaps on Ethereum, Polygon, Abitrum, or others. Layer 2 blockchain chains offer faster and cheaper transactions compared to Ethereum. But what if you have tokens on Network A that you want to swap for tokens on Network B? That\u2019s where Cross-chain DEXs come in. Cross-Chain DEXs: These DEXs can bridge tokens across blockchains and perform swaps at the same time. Be sure to check the exchange rate before you start clicking buttons, though. Cross-chain DEXs make several hops, so it can be a bumpy ride. But some cross-chain swaps work out great.\n\nHere\u2019s a cross-chain swap on OpenOcean, Bridging RDNT on the Abitrum network to USDC on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe cost in this example is cheaper than doing an RDNT to USDC swap on Abitrum and then using a crypto bridge to move the USDC to Ethereum. Faster too.\n\nBenefits Of A DEX\n\nCheap Transactions: DEX swap fees are less costly than trading on most exchanges. Typically, you\u2019ll pay about 0.25% to 0.3% in swap fees. By comparison, Coinbase Advanced charges 0.4% for limit orders and 0.6% for market orders.\n\nDEX swap fees are less costly than trading on most exchanges.

Better Token Selection: DEXs have more tokens than your typical exchange. Also, new tokens typically make their debut on DEXs or through airdrops. If you\u2019re looking for the next 100x, the odds are probably better that you\u2019ll find it trading on DEXs than on centralized exchanges.\n\nDEXs have more tokens than your typical exchange.

You trade directly from your wallet. Nice and secure.\n\nDEX Risks\n\nSlippage/Price Impact: DEXs that use AMMs (most of the DEX world) can lead to paying more than you expected for a swap.

Rug Pulls: Not too long ago, the ArbiSwap DEX enticed users to buy and stake the ARBI token. Then, the developers pulled the liquidity from the ARBI pool. This same type of rug pull can happen with any scammy token.

The rug pullers now have ETH, and buyers have worthless tokens. Boooo.\n\nNot too long ago, the ArbiSwap DEX enticed users to buy and stake the ARBI token.

And they can name it anything they want, including names similar to the token you want to buy.

But too many choices can be overwhelming. Chances are that you\u2019ll choose one or two as your main squeezes \u2014 but you won\u2019t need twenty. Before you start connecting wallets like Tim Taylor rewiring home appliances, there are a few things to consider.\n\nEase Of Use: Uniswap is still the top DEX for three reasons.

Additional Features: If all you\u2019re doing is basic swaps, a well-established DEX like Uniswap or a DEX aggregator like 1inch will do the trick. But if you need limit orders or cross-chain swaps, you might want to consider OpenOcean.\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nCentralized exchanges are a common onramp for crypto buyers, but once you have some crypto, the DEX world is your oyster. DEXs can even be a less costly way to trade, but you\u2019ll want to learn the ropes first. Try some test trades without completing the swap. Like everything in crypto, once you get the hang of it, you\u2019ll wonder why you waited so long.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhich DeFi Exchange Has The Lowest Fees? Some DeFi Exchanges, like CoW Swap, offer free limit orders. Most standard swaps range from 2.5% to 0.3% in swap fees. Fees are only part of the equation, though. Examine how many tokens you receive in exchange for your swap after fees. That\u2019s what really matters. Is There A DeFi Swap App? Mobile wallets like Coinbase Wallet or MetaMask have built-in swaps. But you\u2019ll have more control over the transaction when using a web app like Uniswap or OpenOcean. What Is The Cheapest DeFi Exchange? The real way to measure what\u2019s cheapest is to compare how many tokens you\u2019ll get in exchange when making a swap. Fees play a smaller role in this than you might think. Instead, it often comes down to how many tokens are in the liquidity pool you\u2019re using with the exchange. Apps like Uniswap can use multiple pools to help ensure you get the most value for your swap. Is Binance A Decentralized Exchange? No. Binance is a centralized exchange with a management team making day-to-day decisions for users on the platform. A decentralized exchange runs on the blockchain using programs called smart contracts. Decisions for decentralized exchanges are made by the community through a voting process.\n\nStaff Writer Eric Huffman Eric Huffman is a staff writer for MilkRoad.com.

What does the future look like for Ethereum?\n\nCrypto enthusiasts around the world are looking for a better understanding of what the future may hold for the price of Ethereum. Although no one has a crystal ball which may tell what the future holds, analysts agree that several factors can have a positive or negative impact on the price of Ethereum.\n\nThe first thing that will influence the price of Ethereum is the market demand for the token. Demand usually increases for Ethereum if ETH is needed for the many decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts that make use of the Ethereum blockchain. As a result, a better understanding of Ethereum\u2019s future adoption and day-to-day usage will give a better understanding of the future demand and therefore possible price of Ethereum.\n\nInstitutional adoption, technological advancements, are also other import factors that could affect the price of Ethereum. One often cited grievance that users have with Ethereum is linked to the high gas fees that are needed to do any type of operation on the Ethereum blockchain. If Ethereum is able to resolve this issue in the future, then maybe more widespread use and adoption could be in the cards. Institutional adoption of Ethereum is also hard to predict, especially since users have a greater number of blockchain options and alternatives to opt for instead of Ethereum.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, the Ethereum Rainbow is an interesting albeit not perfect or accurate means of predicting or assessing the future. In fact, it is important to note that predicting the future of Ethereum is no easy task as it is impacted by a great number of factors that analysts and experts may not be able to factor in. One thing is certain however, Ethereum has shown to be a useful and innovative blockchain technology that has had a major influence on the world of crypto.\n\nFor buyers interested in exploring newer and younger coins, examining the potential of ApeMax could present a possibly exciting and appealing adventure.\n\nOfficial ApeMax Website"

        "title": "9 smart contract vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them - TechTarget",
        "content": "Smart contracts execute processes, transactions and other tasks when specific events, conditions and logic are met, depending on how they are programmed. Smart contracts are deployed on a blockchain, such as Ethereum or other distributed ledger infrastructure, where they listen for events and updates from cryptographically secure data feeds called oracles. These contracts often control the flow of large amounts of valuable data and resources, such as transferring money, delivering services and unlocking protected content. This naturally makes them an attractive target to malicious actors.\n\nSecurity must be a top priority when designing and developing a smart contract. Once a smart contract is deployed to a blockchain, it is difficult or impossible to patch; it must be removed, recreated and redeployed. Plus, vulnerabilities in a smart contract will be accessible to anyone once the smart contract is on a blockchain.\n\nWhen deploying a smart contract written in Solidity on the popular smart contract platform Ethereum, development teams need to be especially aware of the following attack vectors and how to eliminate them.\n\n2. Oracle manipulation Smart contracts access and consume external data from outside the blockchain via an oracle. This lets them interact with off-chain systems, such as stock markets. Incorrect or manipulated oracle data can erroneously trigger the execution of smart contracts; this is known as the oracle issue. Many decentralized finance applications have been exploited using this method, the favorite being a flash loan attack. Flash loans are essentially unsecured loans with no limit as to how much can be borrowed so long as the loan is repaid in the same transaction. Attacks use these loans to distort asset prices to generate profits while still abiding by a blockchain's rules. Fix: Using a decentralized oracle, such as Chainlink or Tellor, or even multiple oracles, is the easiest way to ensure a contract receives accurate data. Such oracles make it harder and more expensive for an attacker to interfere with the data.\n\n3. Gas griefing To perform a transaction or execute a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain platform, users must pay a gas fee. It is paid to incentivize validators (miners) to commit the resources needed to verify transactions. The price of gas is determined by supply, demand and network capacity at the time of the transaction. Gas griefing occurs when a user sends the amount of gas required to execute the target smart contract but not enough to execute subcalls -- calls it makes to other contracts. If the contract does not check if the required gas to execute a subcall is available, the subcall will not execute as expected. This can have a significant effect on the application's logic. Fix: No effective technique to prevent gas griefing exists. All a developer can do is code the contract so it sets the amount of gas to be sent, not the user. A rise in gas costs, however, could mean that the transaction fails.\n\n4. Transaction order dependence attacks (frontrunning) Smart contracts are publicly visible from the moment they are submitted to the network as a pending transaction. This enables a miner of a block to select the transaction with the highest gas fees. For example, users can include a priority fee -- a tip -- to incentivize miners to prioritize their transaction ahead of other transactions in the same block. However, this also enables attackers to watch for opportunities where they can front run profitable contracts by submitting an identical contract, but with a higher gas fee, so their contract is processed first. Because these attacks have to be implemented in fractions of a second, they are usually performed by bots or miners themselves. Fix: These attacks are tricky to avoid. One option is to only accept transactions with a gas price below a predetermined threshold. Or use a commit-and-reveal scheme that involves a user first submitting a solution hash instead of the cleartext solution so the solution can't be viewed by potential frontrunners until it is too late. Various smart contract audit tools can detect if code introduces frontrunning vulnerabilities.\n\n5. Force-feeding attacks Force-feeding attacks take advantage of the fact that developers cannot prevent a smart contract from receiving Ether, Ethereum's native cryptocurrency. This makes it easy to transfer Ether to any contract -- force-feeding them -- to change the balance of Ether it holds and thereby manipulate any function logic that solely relies on the expected balance for internal accounting, such as paying out a reward if a balance increases above a certain level. Fix: It is impossible to stop contract balance manipulation in this way. A contract's balance should never be used as a check or guard within a function because the actual Ether balance may be higher than the balance expected by the contract's internal code.\n\n6. Timestamp dependence Timestamp values are generated by the node that executes the smart contract. Due to the distributed nature of the Ethereum platform, it is almost impossible to guarantee that the time on every node is correctly synchronized. A node can then manipulate the timestamp value it uses to craft a logic attack against any contract that relies on the block.timestamp variable to execute time-critical operations. Fix: To avoid this vulnerability, developers should not use the block.timestamp function as a control or logic check, or as a source of randomness.\n\n7. Denial of service Like any online service, smart contracts are vulnerable to DoS attacks. By overloading services, such as authentication, an attacker can block other contracts from executing or generate unexpected contract reverts, for example, where unused gas is returned and all state is reverted to the state before the transaction began to execute. This can result in auction results or values used in financial transactions being manipulated to the attacker's advantage. Fix: Making these attacks costly for attackers is the best way to deter them. Time-lock puzzles and gas fees are just some of the ways of increasing an attacker's costs. Ensuring calls are only made to trusted contracts also reduces the likelihood of a DoS attack causing serious problems.\n\n8. Integer underflows and overflows Integer underflows and overflows occur when the result of an arithmetic operation falls outside the fixed-size range of values: 0 to 255 in the case of integer type uint8. Values higher than 255 overflow and are reset to 0, while values lower than 0 reset to 255. This causes unexpected changes to a contract's state variables and logic and triggers invalid operations. Fix: Since version 0.8.0, the Solidity compiler no longer allows code that could result in integer underflows and overflows. Check any contracts compiled with earlier versions for functions involving arithmetic operations or use a library, such as SafeMath, to check for underflow and overflow issues.\n\n9. Information and function exposure Blockchains are accessible to anyone. Confidential or sensitive information should never be saved to a blockchain unless it is encrypted. Variables and functions within a smart contract can also be visible and accessible to other smart contracts, which leaves them open to possible misuse or abuse. Fix: Developers should always implement proper access controls and use the principle of least privilege by using Solidity's variable and function visibility modifiers to assign the minimum level of visibility as is necessary and no more."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) price is working on its recovery after it dipped to a two-week low on Thursday. While Bitcoin price has failed to make a similar move and head back above $26,500, Ethereum is outpacing Bitcoin and has been able to push above $1,800. One hurdle is in the way now. The green ascending trendline must be overtaken again by bulls before heading to $1,875.\n\nBitcoin price declined in response to April's US core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation data, which came higher than anticipated. The knee-jerk reaction from market participants increased the selling pressure on the asset, pushing it below $26,400. However, Bitcoin price has managed to return to pre-data levels minutes after the release.\n\nPEPE (PEPE) price is entering the very last possible stage before finally determining whether bulls or bears have the winning hand in this poker game showdown. Analyzing the performances of past sessions and taking into account the Relative Strength Index (RSI), it would appear that the bears will win the game. Expect a breakdown soon of the green ascending trendline and price action heading to $0.0010000 if that is indeed the outcome.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

        "content": "Bitcoin rose on Friday, but a few altcoins were down. The crypto traders continued to to track negotiations about the US debt ceiling. US lawmakers reported progress in the discussions, although whether they and the Biden Administration reach an agreement remains uncertain.\n\n\n\nBitcoin was back in green on Friday as the largest crypto token gained more than a per cent but remained below $26,500-mark. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, jumped about 2 per cent to regain the $1,800-levels. Price action in the altcoin was mixed during the early trade.\n\n\n\nCrypto markets have traded sideways in the last 24 hours. The slight increase could be attributed to positive weekly unemployment data in the US.

        "content": "Charles Hoskinson addresses what\u2019s coming to the network this summer.\n\nThe Cardano founder adds that by this summer the chain could surpass Bitcoin, Ethereum, and every other cryptocurrency.\n\nHoskinson also shares how Cardano plans to tackle the ongoing regulatory turmoil.\n\nCardano is emerging as a powerhouse in the crypto industry, cementing itself as a pioneering force to be reckoned with. This year, the Proof-of-Stake chain has exhibited remarkable growth, fueled by the release of new protocols, updates, and proposals that have the crypto community hooked.\n\nAs the network approaches its final development stages with the highly anticipated Voltaire update, Cardano\u2019s founder Charles Hoskinson has shared some exciting news about what lies ahead for the network in the summer.\n\nIn a video update released on Thursday, May 25, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson shed light on the latest developments within the ecosystem. Hoskinson touched on various topics with an optimistic outlook, unveiling the potential of a \u201cCardano Summer\u201d in the next few weeks.\n\nOne of the key highlights of Hoskinson\u2019s address was the CIP-1694 proposal. It is a ground-breaking revision of Cardano\u2019s on-chain governance infrastructure scheduled to be integrated into the upcoming Voltaire update. The proposal can potentially reshape the Cardano ecosystem into a government, allowing any user to submit a governance action.\n\nHoskinson eagerly shared that the development team has been progressing at \u201cblinding speeds\u201d to finalize CIP-1694, which is expected to be released in the next few weeks. In parallel, Cardano is also conducting a series of workshops worldwide, engaging its vibrant community and equipping them with a deeper understanding of the new protocol.\n\nLooking ahead, Hoskinson asserted his firm belief that once CIP-1694 goes live following the community vote and hard fork, the network will become \u201cmore decentralized than all crypto,\u201d including competitors Bitcoin and Ethereum. The founder added that the achievement would serve as a resounding \u201cwake-up call\u201d to Bitcoin maximalists and others who have dismissed Cardano\u2019s research-oriented approach as mere \u201cacademic waste.\u201d\n\nThe Cardano Founder delved into other updates, including the launch of Genesis and Eclipse detection following CIP-1694. Hoskinson added that by summer, Cardano would be a complete end-to-end network that would behave the way he envisioned and intended for it to be used.\n\nBeyond this, Hoskinson also addressed the ongoing regulatory turmoil, sharing how the development team is tackling the issue and laying the foundation for a better regulatory framework.\n\nQuantifying Cardano\u2019s Decentralization\n\nHoskinson introduced the development team\u2019s ongoing effort to measure and quantify decentralization using the Edinburgh Decentralization Index, which plans to leverage metrics such as the Herfindahl-Hirschman, Gini, and Nakamoto coefficients. These metrics would provide valuable insights into Cardano\u2019s level of decentralization, further cementing its position in the crypto industry.\n\nThe Cardano founder also highlighted the potential impact of these metrics on governments and regulatory bodies worldwide. By using these indicators to assess decentralization, policy-makers could formulate informed regulations and differentiate between cryptocurrencies as either commodities or protocols based on their decentralization.\n\nHoskinson emphasized that major regulatory bodies, such as MiCA and those in the United States, could adopt these metrics once they are complete, fostering a more nuanced and optimized regulatory framework.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nCardano is currently the 7th largest network by market cap.\n\nCardano has made an impressive ascent in DeFi TVL rankings, claiming the 17th spot with a total value locked (TVL) of $163.16 million , at press time.\n\n, A report published in December 2022 by Santiment highlighted Cardano as the top protocol in terms of development activity.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nCardano is one of the top cryptocurrencies in the market with a vibrant community. The network has often shown its unwavering commitment to innovation and progress. Summer 2023 could be revolutionary for the crypto community regarding decentralization. Many are eagerly awaiting the realization of Hoskinson\u2019s summer expectation. If it succeeds, it would undoubtedly pave the way for a more inclusive and resilient future in the crypto industry.\n\nFind out what Charles Hoskinson had to say about the Ledger controversy:\n\nCardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Reacts to Ledger Controversy: \u201cDon\u2019t Break Social Contracts\u201d\n\nWill Cardano reach $1?\n\nCardano\u2019s Road to $1: DeFi TVL Tripled, SNEK Soars 200%, and Whale Interest Burgeons"

        "title": "Bitcoin-Based Ordinals NFTs Surge in Sales; Ethereum Retains Top Spot as Digital Collectibles Host - Gadgets 360",
        "content": "Ethereum, for the longest time, has remained the top blockchain of choice for digital artists and NFT creators to host their Web3 content on. The Bitcoin blockchain is now picking pace in competing with Ethereum to make a significant mark on the NFT sector. Over the last month, the sales of NFTs based on Bitcoin marked a significant surge. With this, the Bitcoin blockchain became second on the list naming top blockchains to have emerged in the recent times, with Ethereum leading the list.\n\nBitcoin-backed NFTs managed to garner around $173.28 million (roughly Rs. 1,433 crore) in revenue in the last thirty days, a report by Bitcoin.com said, citing CryptoSlam.IO insights.\n\nAn energy intensive proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain, Bitcoin specially supports the Ordinals category of NFTs. When an NFT is inscribed on one Satoshi unit of the Bitcoin blockchain, it gets classified as an Ordinal NFT. Satoshi, named after Bitcoin's anonymous creator, is the smallest denomination of Bitcoin.\n\nThe Ordinals classification of NFTs is an up-and-coming category of NFTs that exploded in popularity after BAYC parent Yuga Labs announced its own Ordinals NFT collection called TwelveFold in March this year.\n\nBTC miners, who validated Ordinal inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain, managed to collect fees worth BTC 1,495 as of May 24. At a point, when BTC is trading at $26,077 (roughly Rs. 21.5 lakh), the amount that Ordinals validators made comes to $40.2 million (roughly Rs. 332 crore).\n\nNine out of the highest valued NFTs sold in recent weeks were supported by the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nOrdinals NFT collections like Space Pepes, Bitcoin Frogs, and $NALS NFTs reportedly managed to fetch $12.2 million (roughly Rs. 101 crore), $9.8 million (roughly Rs. 81 crore), and $6.8 million (roughly Rs. 563 million), respectively.\n\nWith these staggering revenue collections via Ordinals NFTs, Bitcoin has surpassed usually preferred blockchains like Polygon and Solana in terms of capturing the digital collectibles market share.\n\nAs opposed to Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana \u2014 all of which are eco-friendly and green blockchains, Bitcoin is an energy-intensive blockchain that requires loads of electricity and advanced computers for miners to validate transactions and add newer blocks to the blockchain.\n\nIn recent weeks, NFT marketplaces like Binance NFT and Magic Eden have added support for the trade and sale of Ordinals NFTs. The OKX crypto exchange is also reportedly planning to debut its NFT marketplace that will support Ordinals NFTs.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum continues to be the reigning regent of the NFT kingdom.\n\nEthereum-based NFT sales bagged a whopping $392 million (roughly Rs. 3,245 crore) in the last 30 days.\n\nSolana and Polygon NFTs, on the other hand, managed to pull in $53.7 million (roughly Rs. 444 crore) and $27 million (roughly Rs. 223 crore) in sales over the last month.\n\nGaana, JioSaavn, Google Podcasts, Apple Podcasts,\n\nSamsung Galaxy A34 5G was recently launched by the company in India alongside the more expensive Galaxy A54 5G smartphone.

        "content": "Bitcoin may be the most widely recognized name in crypto, but its chief rival Ethereum has cornered a bigger share of the recent innovation in digital assets, whether it\u2019s nonfungible tokens or decentralized finance apps. That\u2019s because Ethereum\u2019s underlying software is seen as more versatile and better able to handle bursts of activity without getting clogged up and slowing down. Now Bitcoin finds itself playing host to crypto\u2019s latest speculative frenzy, a frog-branded \u201cmemecoin\u201d called Pepe, putting the original crypto network\u2019s technology under strain.\n\nMemecoins are digital tokens depicted with an image \u2014 often an animated character or animal \u2014 that can quickly gain notoriety and soar in value. Although they have little practical use, they can draw an exuberant community of followers who hoard or trade them. (The name takes its cue from so-called meme stocks, such as Gamestop Corp., that were seized upon by retail traders during the pandemic and driven to stratospheric valuations based on social media chatter.) There are hundreds of memecoins, some worth almost nothing, others with market values of $100 million or more. Investors often leap upon a newly minted memecoin when it starts trading on a digital exchange such as Coinbase or Robinhood. Others pile in after them for fear of missing out. One famous memecoin, Dogecoin, ascended to stardom when Elon Musk tweeted memes based on the coin, which inspired a number of dog-themed memecoins such as Shiba Inu."

        "content": "With just one week left of May, crypto investors are trying to optimize their portfolios for the next month. Although much of the market remains turbulent, experts believe Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tradecurve will continue to lead the market, with Tradecurve already selling over 60% of its second presale round.\n\n>>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum Pushes Towards $2k After Late Month Recovery\n\nEthereum\u2019s recent upgrade has made the project more popular than ever. More individuals staked Ethereum at the end of April than the entirety of March, which was a huge milestone for the project. Now one month later Ethereum\u2019s popularity continues to rise, with $6.7 billion worth of Ethereum transactions taking place daily.\n\nEarly in May, Ethereum surged to over $2k before declining to $1,748. However, Ethereum is back on the rise with a 2.18% price increase in the last week. At the time of writing, Ethereum was trading at $1,853, with experts predicting it to hit $2k by the end of the month.\n\nWith the Ethereum ecosystem growing faster than ever, analysts predict that Ethereum could surge above $2k in June, with bullish experts predicting that Ethereum could hit $2.3k by the end of Q2.\n\nBitcoin Up Following Debt Crisis Updates\n\nFollowing news that the Biden administration had solved the debt crisis, Bitcoin increased by 1.54%, with one Bitcoin trading at $27,325 at the time of writing. This increase marks a rise of 1.26% in the last seven days, though Bitcoin remains below the $28k barrier.\n\nDespite the price of Bitcoin remaining stagnant for the past month, Bitcoins daily trading volume remains extremely high, averaging over $13 billion a day. With an influx of new investors and Bitcoin ordinals starting to gain traction, analysts are confident that Bitcoin will begin to rally by the end of May.\n\nWhile price predictions vary, most analysts are confident that Bitcoin will rise above $30k in the next month, which would likely trigger a market wide rally, driving up the value of Ethereum and Tradecurve in the process.\n\nAnalysts Believe Tradecurve Could Be The Next Big Exchange\n\nWhile Ethereum and Bitcoin are expected to increase between 5 to 10%, Tradecurve is expected to increase 50x during its presale, having already risen by 20% after its first presale round sold out.\n\nTradecurve\u2019s development was inspired by recent developments in the crypto market and in particular, growing uncertainty regarding the transparency of centralized exchanges. The development team noticed that while decentralized alternatives are available, these too have flaws with limited assets and a high level of complexity.\n\nTradecurve offers a hybrid exchange that combines the benefits of both decentralized and centralized alternatives while also removing their disadvantages. Using Tradecurve, investors can buy crypto and traditional assets anonymously, without ever needing to pass KYC checks.\n\nInstead, the platform works like decentralized exchanges where investors can connect their external wallets, buy assets and disconnect. Furthermore, Tradecurve also resolves the complexity of decentralized exchanges with its metaverse trading academy where investors can learn how to trade and use the Tradecurve platform.\n\nMore advanced traders will also have the chance to build on their education with AI and automated trading subscriptions as well as a copy trading subscription, where traders can learn directly from the market\u2019s best traders.\n\nTradecurve tokens, which will play an important role in the project\u2019s ecosystem, are currently selling for $0.012 per token during the project\u2019s presale. With less than 40% of its round 2 supply left, TCRV tokens are expected to increase to $0.015 by the end of the month, offering a 50% ROI for bullish investors.\n\nFor more information about TCRV presale tokens:\n\nWebsite: https://tradecurve.io/\n\nBuy presale: https://app.tradecurve.io/sign-up\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/tradecurve_official\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Unlocking the Potential: Best LSD Crypto Tokens to Add to Your Portfolio - The Economic Times",
        "content": "Thanks to the recent Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) have become the latest trend in the decentralized finance space (DeFi), offering stakers unconventional ways to unlock liquidity for their staked crypto assets and earn additional yields.\n\nLiquid staking derivatives are gaining momentum across the Ethereum network and have the potential to dominate other ecosystems, including major layer-1 blockchains like Avalanche and Polygon.\n\nRecent data from DeFiLlama shows that approximately $17.99 billion is currently locked up in LSDs, with Lido (currently the largest liquid staking protocol) dominating the space with approximately $11.95 billion total value locked (TVL).\n\nFollowing the major ethereum upgrade (also known as the Shanghai or Shapella upgrade), there has been a sharp rise in interest in LSDs, which has led to a surge in cash flow in DeFi and made staking more accessible to a lot of people who can now take advantage of both staking rewards and liquidity. The upgrade enables withdrawals from Ethereum staking contracts, significantly reducing the risk of holding staked Ethereum (stETH).\n\nWhat are liquid staking derivatives (LSDs)?\n\nLiquid Staking Derivatives (or Liquid Staking Tokens) are a unique kind of token that allows stakers to earn yield without losing the liquidity of their staked assets. These liquid tokens can be used in various ways; they can be sold, traded or used in Defi applications just like regular ETH.Staking tokens in proof-of-stake blockchains means locking tokens as collateral to secure the network and earn rewards, however, due to the lock-up nature, these tokens become illiquid.\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Revolution\n\nAfter the merge in September 2022, ethereum blockchain successfully swapped from Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism. By moving from PoW to PoS, the Ethereum blockchain now relies on validators instead of miners to run it.\n\nSince the launch of Ethereum's Beacon Chain in December 2020, the first phase of the PoS transition, individuals could stake their ETH and serve as validators to process transactions and secure the network. To become a validator, stakers needed a specialized hardware and at least 32 ETH stake to run nodes themselves and receive rewards in blocks. However, they were unable to unstake their tokens and withdraw their rewards. Thanks to the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, validators can now unstake their staked ETH and withdraw their rewards.\n\nWhy are LSD tokens on the Rise?\n\nThe recent upgrade includes a code referred to as EIP 4895, which allows Beacon Chain staked ETH withdrawals, enabling a 1:1 exchange of staked Ether for Ether. With this development, ETH holders can now stake their tokens through liquid staking pools to generate yields, thus increasing the demand for LSDs and triggering rapid growth in DeFi TVL.\n\nLiquid staking derivatives solve the problem of capital inefficiency by providing users with a liquid and usable token representing their staked asset. They also eliminate the 32 ETH entry barrier, enabling anyone to stake any amount of ETH they can afford in exchange for additional yields.\n\nBest LSD Crypto Tokens In 2023\n\nLSD tokens have quickly become the biggest crypto trend in 2023. As such, an increasing number of DeFi protocols have rolled out to offer a more flexible way to stake and earn by providing LSDs.\n\nCurrently, 18.5 million ETH (~33.40 billion) are being staked in liquid staking pools. The annual percentage rate (APR) for staking ETH currently sits at around 8.98% today.\n\nAs Ethereum staking ratio increases, the use cases for liquid staking protocols and their tokens will also increase. Here are some of the best LSD protocols and their tokens for ETH holders looking to earn yield through staking.\n\n1) Lido ($LDO)\n\nAs a crypto trader, this is one of the best LSD tokens in the market to look out for. Lido is currently the largest liquid staking protocol dominating the space with an estimated $11.95 billion TVL at the time of writing. It has a market cap of about $2 billion, 85% of the total 1 billion LDO tokens are already in circulation.\n\nLido allows users to stake their ETH and earn additional rewards - with no lock ups and daily rewards. It supports Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Terra, Kusama and Polkadot.\n\nLDO \u2013 the native utility token, is used for granting governance rights and managing fee distribution. The token is available for trading on various exchanges, with cryptocurrency and stablecoin pairs currently available.\n\nWith LSDs on the rise, LDO has the potential to offer higher annual yield and market share than other protocols.\n\n2) Rocket Pool ($RPL)\n\nRocket Pool is one of the largest decentralized Ethereum LSD protocols after the Lido protocol. The protocol aims to reduce both the capital and hardware requirements for staking on ETH 2.0, adding to the decentralization and security of Ethereum.\n\nRPL is the ERC-20 utility token of Rocket Pool, and it's used to govern the PDAO and can be staked by node operators.\n\nUsers can run their own nodes with only 16 ETH and 1.6 ETH worth of RPL. Node operators stake RPL as insurance, where users stake Ether and receive rETH, a liquid ERC-20 token, in return. This token automatically accrues staking rewards based on the performance of the entire network of node operators.\n\nOn Rocket Pool, node operatives receive a delegation of 15 per cent, which covers their operational costs and incentivizes them to provide high quality services to their users.\n\nThe current Rocket Pool market capis $958,730,935 with a circulating supply of 19,401,735 RPL. Over the last year, Rocket Pool price has increased by 102.20%. During the last month, the price of RPL has risen by 5.09%.\n\nRPL is available on UniSwap (V3), Hoo, BKEX, XT.COM, Hotbit, and Bvnex.\n\n3) Tenet Protocol ($TENET)\n\nTenet, the first layer-1 blockchain to create a DeFi ecosystem for LSDs. The DeFi ecosystem implants a unique model called Diversified Proof of Stake (DiPoS), which supports staking with any LSD asset from other chains, such as ETH, BNB, ATOM, SOL and ADA. As such, Tenet becomes partially secured by all its supported networks, thus improving security compared to standard single-token Proof of Stake.\n\n$TENET is the native token of TENET. It is used at the base layer of the blockchain to pay for transaction execution as a gas token. TENET can also be staked in a Validator to secure the blockchain through TENET's revolutionary DiPoS--mechanism. When you stake TENET you will receive an LSD of TENET called tTENET. tTenet also needs to be locked up with the corresponding staking provider to receive Validation rewards from securing the blockchain.\n\nBy participating in Tenet validation and earning network transaction fees with LSDs like stETH and cbETH, one can still benefit from the ETH staking yield that these LSDs provide.\n\nThe platform offers a zero management fee, that is, it eliminates the 10% management fee charged by protocols like Lido, as a form of security incentivization.\n\nWith its unique blockchain mechanism and utility, the token is sure to be a promising one with significant use cases.\n\n4) Ankr ($ANKR)\n\nAnkr is a leading blockchain infrastructure provider which offers multi-chain API connections and runs RPC nodes besides staking solutions. The LSD protocol aims to make the adoption of Web3 easier by offering a platform where users can deploy nodes on PoS blockchains, stake their PoS tokens and access decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nANKR, the native utility and governance token of Ankr, has many use cases, including as payment for services within the Ankr ecosystem and as a means of earning passive income by staking. The Ethereum token can be used for on-chain governance and also as an insurance for network participants.\n\nWith a market cap of over $250 million and a maximum supply of 10 billion (100%), Ankr is one of the largest Ethereum staker and go-to staking infrastructure providers for ecosystems like the BNB, Polygon, and more.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade helped to bring back confidence in the Ethereum blockchain and served as fuel for LSD protocols. Issues like capital inefficiency and lock up periods that made stakes illiquid are now being resolved with the emergence of LSD protocols. By providing liquidity and yield opportunities for stakers, these protocols are unlocking the potential of the rapidly growing LSD market.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThis is an advertorial.

        "content": "Here\u2019s the on-chain indicator that may have foreshadowed the recent dip in the price of Ethereum below the $1,800 level.\n\nEthereum Has Plunged After Multi-Collateral Dai Repaid Metric Spikes\n\nAccording to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, 43.4 million Dai was repaid in Wrapped ETH (WETH) during the past day. Multi-Collateral Dai (DAI) is a decentralized stablecoin built on the Ethereum blockchain that\u2019s soft pegged to the US Dollar, meaning that its value remains fixed at $1.\n\nThe coin is called multi-collateral because it is backed by a mix of cryptocurrencies. An earlier version of the coin was Single-Collateral Dai (SAI), and it was only backed by one asset.\n\nWhen Dai is minted (that is, new coins enter into circulation), users have to deposit their collateral into the smart contract vaults. In the context of the current discussion, the stablecoin tokens minted using WETH as collateral are of interest.\n\nThe \u201cMulti-Collateral DAI created\u201d is an indicator that measures the total amount of coins of the stablecoin that are being minted using WETH right now. The counterpart metric of this indicator is the \u201cMulti-Collateral DAI repaid,\u201d which naturally tracks the instances of WETH being returned after the issued tokens are destroyed.\n\nHere is a chart that shows the trend in these two Wrapped Ethereum indicators over the past year:\n\nOne of the metrics seems to have observed a large value in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter\n\nAs you can see in the above graph, Santiment has highlighted an interesting pattern that the Ethereum price has followed in response to spikes in the Multi-Collateral Dai repaid indicator.\n\nIt looks like whenever a large amount of Dai has been destroyed to release WETH, the price of the cryptocurrency has registered either a top or a bottom. In the past year, there have been two instances of this trend.\n\nThe first of them took place almost one year ago, right after the ETH price crashed due to the 3AC bankruptcy. This spike coincided with the bottom formation of the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe other one was earlier in February of this year and unlike the first one, this spike coincided with the asset forming a local top.\n\nRecently, the indicator has once again observed a large spike, meaning that someone has withdrawn a large amount of the wrapped form of Ethereum that was previously being used to back Dai tokens.\n\nIn total, 43.4 million DAI has been destroyed with this latest spike. This is the third largest that the indicator\u2019s value has been during the past 12 months and only the aforementioned instances of the metric registered withdrawals of larger scales.\n\nIf the pattern of the previous spikes holds any weight at all, then the current Dai WETH repayments may also lead to Ethereum observing either a local top or a local bottom.\n\nYesterday, Ethereum plunged below the $1,800 level, so perhaps the decline was due to the indicator\u2019s spike. Today, however, the cryptocurrency has already rebounded back above this level, so it\u2019s hard to say whether the metric\u2019s influence is already done with, or if the real effect is yet to come.\n\nETH Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $1,800, down 1% in the last week.\n\nETH has already recovered today | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net"
