        "title": "Why Ethereum\u2019s price rise is not cause for celebration yet - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price increased by nearly 2% in the last 24 hours.\n\nHowever, market indicators were bearish, suggesting a change in trends.\n\nThe Binance and Coinbase episode with the US Securities Exchange Commission caused havoc in the crypto industry. It caused a decline in the supply of Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] on Binance, suggesting that investors were losing confidence in CEXes.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nEthereum investors\u2019 confidence in Binance declined\n\nGlassnode\u2019s latest tweet revealed that after the SEC incident, investors actively withdrew their ETH and BTC from Binance. As per the tweet, Ethereum\u2019s balance on Binance was around 4.56 million to 4.2 million.\n\nSince the SEC charges, the #Bitcoin and #Ethereum Balance on #Binance has declined by -48K BTC and -360K ETH respectively. ? BTC Balance: 706K BTC to 658K BTC (-48K BTC)\n\n? ETH Balance: 4.56M ETH to 4.2M ETH (-360K ETH) pic.twitter.com/rOKZpfgJwn \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) June 15, 2023\n\nThis indicated that they were losing faith in the CEX. In order to keep their holdings safe, investors were moving their assets to self-custody, or DEXes. This was evident from Dune\u2019s data.\n\nAfter a decline, ETH\u2019s volume on DEXes registered an uptick, as per the chart ETH\u2019s DEX volume has increased on multiple projects such as Curve [CRV], Uniswap [UNI], and more since 11 June.\n\nEthereum\u2019s revenue has plummeted\n\nIt was interesting to see that ETH generated the highest revenue in Q1, driven by its high usage and gas fees. According to Messari\u2019s recent tweet, Ethereum\u2019s revenue was $457 million, almost 2.8 times the combined revenue of all other featured L1s.\n\n.@Ethereum generated the highest revenue in Q1, driven by its high usage and gas fees. Its revenue was $457M, almost 2.8x the combined revenue of all other featured L1s.@Hedera had the most significant revenue growth, up 489% QoQ, driven by its Consensus Service. pic.twitter.com/ybTQJhIq7I \u2014 Messari (@MessariCrypto) June 16, 2023\n\nHowever, things changed in the second quarter of this year. Token Terminal\u2019s data revealed that ETH\u2019s revenue had declined. After spiking on 5 May 2023, Ethereum\u2019s revenue plummeted sharply, which was not good for the blockchain.\n\nETH investors had a good day\n\nThough ETH\u2019s revenue declined, the token\u2019s price moved the other way. According to CoinMarketCap, ETH\u2019s price has increased by nearly 2% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, it was trading at $1,665.31, with a market capitalization of over $200 billion.\n\nAs per CryptoQuant, Ethereum\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was in an oversold position. This might have increased buying pressure and pushed up the token\u2019s price. Ethereum\u2019s exchange reserve was also green, suggesting that the token was not under selling pressure.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nHere is the catch\n\nA look at ETH\u2019s daily chart suggested that the uptrend might continue as the market indicators looked bearish. The MACD displayed a bullish upperhand in the market.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also registered a downtick. Additionally, its Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Ribbon also pointed out that the bears were leading the market, as the 20-day EMA was below the 55-day EMA."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThere is a new protocol that allows users to create and share digital objects on Ethereum. They are called Ethscriptions\u2014an apparent tip of the hat to Inscriptions, a similar project by Ordinals deployed on the Bitcoin network.\n\nDeveloped by Tom Lehman, co-founder and former CEO of Genius.com, the project launched on Saturday and saw explosive interest. Nearly 30,000 Ethscriptions were created in less than 18 hours, according to Lehman, who tweeted that the launch was a \u201chuge success.\u201d\n\nEthscriptions enable non-financial and arbitrary data to be written into the main Ethereum blockchain. Users can inscribe any type of file provided it is under 96 kilobytes in size. According to its creator, however, it currently only allows for images\u2014but that will change in the future.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThese inscriptions leverage what\u2019s known as Ethereum \u201ccalldata,\u201d which refers to the data provided within a call made to a smart contract. According to Lehman, the protocol is cheaper and more decentralized than using contract storage.\n\nThe [protocol] \u201cguarantees global uniqueness of the content of all valid Ethscriptions,\u201d the creator tweeted, saying that \u201cit's skating to where the puck is going in an L2 world.\u201d\n\nLehman, perhaps in a bid for notoriety, called for famed NFT collection Crypto Punks to be \u201cethscribed.\u201d It successfully sparked a frenzy, and copies of the 10,000 images were inscribed in a matter of hours.\n\nThe launch echoes the Ordinals launch on Bitcoin, NFT-style images and other non-financial data included in the main chain\u2019s ledger. The arrival of Ordinals, however, triggered dismay from many in the maximalist community.\n\nThe difference in reception is the Ethereum community\u2019s apparent openness to innovation and experimentation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe exciting thing for me about Ethscriptions, similar to Ordinals, is that developers are playing around again with blockchain technology,\u201d self-proclaimed NFT archaeologist Adam McBride told Decrypt. \u201cIt\u2019s this experimentation that drives innovation and adoption,\u201d\n\nMuch like the Ordinal craze, this weekend has seen significant interest from new protocol users. This led Ethscriptions to suffer several periods of downtime, with Lehman tweeting, \u201cSorry everything is crashing! Too many people.\u201d\n\nAlthough this weekend brought an impressive debut for the protocol, some say it already existed. McBride says this technology has been around for years, with certain artists already using it in their work.\n\nStill, he told Decrypt \u201cthis is the first time it\u2019s gained widespread awareness.\u201d\n\nWhether Ethscriptions are a fly-by-night fad or an exciting new trend will ultimately be determined by the community."

Similar to the Ordinals project on the Bitcoin network, Ethscriptions enable users to inscribe non-financial data under 96 kilobytes in size, particularly images for now, directly into the Ethereum main chain.

While some argue that similar technology has existed for years, the widespread awareness and adoption of Ethscriptions mark a new trend in the Ethereum community's openness to innovation and experimentation.\n\nThe debut of Ethscriptions has drawn parallels to the Ordinals launch on Bitcoin, where NFT-style images and non-financial data were incorporated into the main chain's ledger. However, the Ethereum community has shown greater acceptance and enthusiasm for this form of experimentation. Ethscriptions experienced intermittent periods of downtime due to the overwhelming interest from users, prompting apologies from Lehman for the technical glitches. As the Ethscriptions protocol gains traction, its longevity and impact within the community will be determined by ongoing community engagement and adoption."

        "title": "The 3 Best Ethereum Mining Pool Options - CoinCentral",
        "content": "So, you\u2019ve heard that mining Ethereum can be a profitable business. Maybe you even bought an Ethereum mining rig. You may have even considered joining an Ethereum mining pool\u2013 which is a group of miners working together to mine Ethereum. Joining a pool helps to lower the volatility of your payouts by providing smaller, more frequent payments rather than a lump sum that you only receive when a block is solved.\n\nHowever, since Ethereum moved to Proof-of-Stake, the network is no longer utilizing mining to keep the network moving. In other words, mining has switched off. Now, Ethereum is secured by validators who stake ETH.\n\nThe following article is preserved in its original form, but please be advised it isn\u2019t relevant beyond simply just being a snapshot of Ethereum\u2019s mining days.\n\nChoosing the Best Ethereum Mining Pool\n\nWhen choosing a mining pool, it\u2019s important to join one with low fees that bring reliable returns. You should also consider the server location of the pool when deciding which is best for you. The closer your mining rig is to the server, the more efficiently it can mine.\n\nIn this article, we highlight three of the best Ethereum mining pools so you can confidently decide which one to join:\n\nEthpool/Ethermine\n\nEthpool and Ethermine are operated from two different websites but contribute to the same pool. With ~26.8% of the network hash rate power, this pool is the largest one on the Ethereum network. Ethermine currently has over 125,000 miners using the pool software while Ethpool has a little under 1,100.\n\nBoth Ethpool and Ethermine charge a 1% fee on each reward that you receive \u2013 one of the lowest fees of the pools researched.\n\nEthermine allows you to set the minimum payment threshold needed to receive your rewards. If you want to receive your payments infrequently, you can set the threshold to the maximum of 10 ETH. Set your threshold to the 0.05 ETH minimum to receive payments more often.\n\nNanopool\n\nNanopool is the third largest Ethereum mining pool with ~14.4% of the network hash rate and over 80,000 miners. The pool fee is also less than most competitors at 1%.\n\nThe default minimum payout threshold using Nanopool is 0.2 ETH, but you\u2019re able to lower and raise the minimum in your settings. The interface is straightforward and simple to use if you\u2019re just getting started.\n\nThe platform also has an extensive help and FAQ section to assist you in getting started. It walks you through how to set up your miner, configure the pool settings, and links you to the appropriate mining clients.\n\nBeyond that, the help section also guides you on which type of hardware is best suited for Ethereum mining. Nanopool recommends that you use an AMD GPU driver 15.12. You can mine with a CPU but your rewards will be few and far between, making it not worth the effort.\n\nNanopool also supports mining for Ethereum Classic, Siacoin, ZCash, Monero, Pascal, and Electroneum.\n\nSome miners have reported that their hash rate through Nanopool is significantly less (sometimes up to a 10% difference) than mining in other pools or on their own. The Nanopool team addresses this in their FAQ section. There are two main reasons for these differences:\n\nThe hashrate the Nanopool shows fluctuates because it\u2019s based on the number of submitted shares. You should instead check what the average is over a 24-hour period. If your hashrate drops to zero, it may have been caused by corrupted DAG files on your miner. If so, stop the miner, delete the DAG files, and restart.\n\nOverall, the community seems to trust and like this pool.\n\nDwarfpool\n\nOnce a market leader, Dwarfpool is now smaller with only ~2.4% of the Ethereum network hash rate. Like Ethpool/Ethermine and Nanopool, Dwarfpool charges a 1% fee on block rewards.\n\nYour account balance needs to reach 1.01 Ethereum before payout and the pool pays out 6 times per day. Unless you\u2019re mining with a powerful mining rig or using multiple miners, you may want to join a pool with a lower payout minimum.\n\nDwarfpool also supports the mining of other coins such as Monero, Zcash, Expanse, and Groestlcoin.\n\nConclusion\n\nYou really can\u2019t go wrong joining any of the top mining pools. Most of the largest ones are fairly reliable and have a similar fee structure. In the end, it\u2019s important to choose the one that you\u2019re most comfortable using. Once you\u2019ve started making a consistent profit, you\u2019ll need to find the best way to sell the Ethereum that you\u2019ve mined."

Besides paving the way for new generations of NFTs, it can advance the tooling of existing Apes and Mutants.\n\nERC-6551 blurs lines between NFTs, smart contracts and wallets\n\nPresented only five weeks ago, ERC-6551 opens up a plethora of previously unseen opportunities for the NFT and digital identity space. Such conclusion was made by The Spartan Group's VC arm Spartan Labs.\n\nERC-4337 was one of the biggest developments for the wallet space earlier this year.\n\n\n\nBut ERC-6551 is building on that to revolutionise the NFT space. ERC-6551 will change the way we view NFTs and digital identities.\n\n\n\nHere's how, and why you should care \ud83e\uddf5 pic.twitter.com/dHwmXKDmic \u2014 Spartan Labs (@TheSpartanLabs) June 16, 2023\n\nThis EIP, co-authored by the founders of CryptoKitties, the first-ever commercially successful NFT collection, allows non-fungible tokens to control ERC-4337-enabled cryptocurrency wallets. For instance, NFTs can make transactions, store assets and, therefore, interact with DeFi protocols just like regular non-custodial wallets.\n\nThe scope of possibilities of ERC-6551-powered NFTs looks really endless. The owner of such NFTs can collect POAPs and display them in a transparent and tamper-proof form.\n\nIn decentralized games, such NFTs can be associated with in-game wallets. This, in turn, will make the gaming experience more immersive for various generations of players.\n\nAs of today, the ERC-6551: Non-fungible Token Bound Accounts proposal is labeled with a \"Draft\" status on Ethereum Foundation's portal for EIPs.\n\nWeb3 media, decentralized messaging, reputation management: Plenty of new NFT use cases\n\nSpartan Labs' researchers indicated a number of other interesting use cases for NFT-powered wallets. They might finally make Web3 publishing platforms mainstream thanks to more democratic content monetization models.\n\nThen, decentralized messengers' interfaces might be upgraded with such NFTs. Traders can even share the addresses of their NFTs to demonstrate their PnL and trade history \u2014 and this data cannot be altered, being visible to everyone via explorers.\n\nThis ERC is backward compatible, which means all existing NFTs can be equipped with the full range of ERC-6551 functionalities. This can radically change the narrative in the global NFT ecosystem."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nUniswap\u2019s new upgrade has sparked a new controversy regarding its \u201copen source\u201d description, with developers saying \u201cit is not as advertised.\u201d\n\nThe company released its fourth version on a Business Source License, giving room for critics due to its four-year open-source period.\n\nUniswap has responded to critics explaining that four years is not a long time to balance incentivizing innovation and giving out exclusive rights.\n\nThis week, Uniswap\u2019s developers noted that the new version of the decentralized exchange (DEX) will offer users limitless possibilities; while that may be true, some promises were not.\n\nPrior to the launch of Uniswap\u2019s V4, the management team made several promises from the increased utility of the exchange to its open-source nature which attracted the attention of developers. The promise of it being open-source has been called a \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d by a cross-section of Ethereum\u2019s community.\n\nThe V4 was released as a Business Source License (BSL), which means that its code is open to the public and can be copied, reproduced, and redistributed, but there\u2019s a caveat. All these can only be done after four years when it converts to a General Purpose License (GPL).\n\nLefteris Karapetsas, an Ethereum developer and founder of Rotki, expressed his displeasure stating that \u201cUniswap decided to go with a Business Source License (BSL), continuing what they did with v3. The reason is they don\u2019t understand open source, and they believe their moat is their code which is wrong.\u201d He was the first to call out Uniswap on Twitter and urged them to use the proper terminology as this \u201cis insulting to actual open-source software.\u201d\n\nAnother dev, Scott Lewis, pointed out that Unisawap\u2019s V4 is a four-year proprietary license adding that \u201cIf anyone else misrepresented the truth like this, they would be torn to shreds. That\u2019s the power of being powerful.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUniswap defend their \u201cfalse\u201d claims\n\nHayden Adams the founder of Uniswap alongside his development team addressed the controversy on YouTube. The group noted that the four-year period is not as long time as it appears, and it strikes a healthy balance between \u201cincentivizing innovation and giving exclusive rights to the protocol, which has precedents in \u2018normal\u2019 settings as well.\u201d\n\nGabriel Shapiro describes it as a tax on innovation, explaining further that it would be difficult for young devs to navigate while building from scratch.\n\n\u201cAnyone who\u2019s looked at BSL code even once, and then later codes something similar, is at a risk of catching a copyright claim,\u201d he added.\n\nDespite the criticisms meted out against Uniswap, many have hailed the V4 for rolling out a new smart contract termed \u201chooks\u201d which lets developers expand liquidity pools increasing customizability."

        "content": "The weekend was accompanied by a mild volatility which has seen Ethereum (ETH), the industry\u2019s second largest digital currency pare off some gains with a 0.60% slump to $1,741.24. The current price slip has extended the losses over the past 7 days.\n\nEthereum Profitability Outlook\n\nDespite its short term performance, the digital currency has remained one of the most attractive digital currencies for longer term success in the industry. With a market capitalization of $209.26 billion, Ethereum has maintained a relative profitability with its value jumping by 43.96% in the year to date (YTD) period.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDespite the turmoil the market has experienced over the past few weeks, more Ethereum addresses are still in profit. Per data from IntoTheBlock (ITB), a total of 57.5 million addresses are in profit, accounting for a total of 59.66% of all total active addresses. In the same vein, addresses in loss totals 36.84 million or 38.22% of the total wallets holding Ether.\n\nThis data is reflective of the resilience of the digital currency amid the regulatory turmoil that is threatening exchanges and other tokens including Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) amongst others. While the hurdles being faced by these digital assets are supposed to be a boost for Ethereum, many are skeptical that the cryptocurrency will be safe should there be a regulatory purge to determine what assets are securities or not.\n\nPer the data gleaned from ITB, just about 2.05 million addresses are experiencing neutral profitability without a loss or gain.\n\nOutlook on Ethereum Price\n\nDespite the challenges in the industry at this time, Ethereum is one of the top tokens with a good projection to outrank Bitcoin in the long term.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has continued to double down on their push to turn the blockchain into a completely functional Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with a series of upgrades scheduled for the next few months.\n\nRiding on its outlook and inherent developmental effort, we can expect the price of the ETH to continue on its upward trajectory in the long term."

        "title": "Is Ethereum (ETH) Proof of Stake Earning More Profitable Than Bitcoin (BTC) Mining? Collateral Network Up 28% - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "In the ever-evolving crypto market, Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) continue to dominate headlines. However, a new player, Collateral Network, is making waves with its upcoming COLT presale. This article delves into the recent developments of these three projects, shedding light on their potential profitability and growth.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum (ETH): A New Era of Tokenized Securities\n\nThe crypto giant, Ethereum, is on the news recently due to developments regarding tokenized security. This may give it an advantage over its competitor, Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been a hot topic in the crypto world. Known for its smart contract functionality, Ethereum has been instrumental in the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and the DeFi sector.\n\nRecently, Ethereum made headlines when a subsidiary of the Bank of China launched the first-ever tokenized security on the Ethereum blockchain. This marked a significant milestone for Ethereum, demonstrating its potential to revolutionize the financial sector.\n\nIn the past month, Ethereum developers have also been planning for the next hard fork, dubbed \u2018Dencun.\u2019 This upgrade is expected to bring about significant improvements to the Ethereum network, further solidifying its position in the crypto market.\n\nThe launch of the tokenized security and the upcoming hard fork align with the article\u2019s title, suggesting that Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake could indeed be more profitable than Bitcoin mining.\n\nBitcoin (BTC): Bracing for CPI Volatility\n\nThe largest crypto out there, Bitcoin, is facing news of mining that may affect the profitability of the coin.\n\nBitcoin, the pioneer of cryptocurrencies, has had its fair share of ups and downs. Despite facing its first monthly drop of 2023, Bitcoin remains a strong contender in the crypto market.\n\nRecent developments have seen Bitcoin traders bracing for Consumer Price Index (CPI) volatility. This comes as Bitcoin faces numerous resistance levels. However, this volatility never came, and despite record-low inflation, Bitcoin didn\u2019t budge.\n\nThese developments indicate that Bitcoin mining could face challenges in terms of profitability, especially when compared to Ethereum.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCollateral Network (COLT): A New Dawn in Crypto Lending\n\nCollateral Network, an Ethereum web3 peer-to-peer lending platform, is set to disrupt the lending industry. This innovative project allows users to unlock liquidity against physical assets on the blockchain, such as jewelry, watches, properties, vintage cars, and artwork.\n\nCollateral Network offers a wide range of benefits. For lenders, these include a weekly passive income, tangible assets as collateral, and security in case of loan default. For borrowers, Collateral Network offers fast turnaround, privacy, transparency, low cost, and borderless transactions.\n\nAdditionally, owners of the $COLT token will have access to our exclusive online auctions for distressed assets. These give investors the chance to buy properties below market value when a borrower defaults on a loan. Some of these auctions will also be in the metaverse.\n\nAnalysts predict a significant price surge for the COLT token. With an initial starting price of $0.001, the token will increase by 3500% during the presale, potentially reaching $0.35. Furthermore, the token will surge by 100x when it lists on major exchanges. Currently, the COLT token has increased its price up to $0.168.\n\nThese predictions, coupled with the platform\u2019s innovative approach to lending, suggest that Collateral Network could indeed be a game-changer in the crypto market.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://presale.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

Its infrastructure, supported by an active community of developers and ongoing upgrades, solidify Ethereum\u2019s position as a key player in the cryptocurrency revolution. As the market evolves, projects like InQubeta aim to offer value propositions that complement Ethereum\u2019s presence in the crypto ecosystem, even providing investors opportunities to diversify their portfolios beyond ETH.\n\nVisit InQubeta presale\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have played foundational roles in the ongoing crypto revolution. However, it is noteworthy that projects such as InQubeta demonstrate that there is still space for further innovation and development within the industry.

        "title": "Ethereum takes the NFT stage by storm with Ethscriptions - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum inscriptions launch with 10,000 Ethereum punk inscriptions in 24 hours.\n\nEthereum dominance of the NFT space continues with blue-chip NFTs.\n\nRecent reports suggest Ethereum is treading a similar path to Bitcoin when pioneering the inscription of NFTs on its platform. In line with the concept of Bitcoin inscriptions, a new feature called Ethscriptions has recently been introduced, and it has garnered a favorable response from users.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nEthereum inscriptions\n\nCapsule 21\u2019s co-founder, Middlemarch, made an exciting announcement on June 16. He introduced Ethscriptions, an Ethereum-based inscription system inspired by Bitcoin\u2019s inscriptions.\n\nEthscriptions enable the creation and sharing of digital works through Ethereum transaction calldata. Alongside this remarkable development, Middlemarch also revealed the launch of Ethereum Punks. It is a collection of non-contract punks akin to those found on Bitcoin.\n\nAdditionally, a glimpse at the Ethereum Punks page revealed that all 10,000 inscriptions were swiftly claimed, leaving none available at the time of writing. This overwhelming response reflected the enthusiastic reception of its inaugural inscription venture.\n\nCurrent Ethereum NFT landscape\n\nEthereum\u2019s smart contract capabilities and widespread adoption have paved the way for the emergence of the first set of prestigious NFTs, commonly known as blue-chip NFTs. A glance at the NFT rankings based on volume, sales, and market capitalization on DappRadar revealed that the top five NFTs were on the network.\n\nAs of this writing, Axie Infinity stood at the top of all-time NFT collections. With over 19.3 million in sales and a volume of over 4.2 billion. Following closely behind was Crypto Punks, boasting impressive sales exceeding 28,000, a remarkable volume surpassing 3.5 billion, and a market capitalization approaching $2 billion.\n\nFurthermore, the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) secured third and fourth positions, respectively, showcasing the prominence of these Ethereum-based NFT collections. This data reaffirmed the network\u2019s dominant share in the NFT space, and the recent inscription launch holds the potential to attract even more attention to the platform.\n\nFees could see a spike\n\nIf we consider the impact of Bitcoin inscriptions and Ordinals, Ethereum will likely experience an increase in transaction fees. The popularity of inscriptions could bring about a higher volume of transactions on the network. The increase in transactions could then result in increased fees being generated.\n\nAccording to Crypto Fees, on 16 June, Ethereum recorded the highest fees compared to other platforms, with daily fees surpassing 4.6 million. The average fees over the past seven days were also significant, exceeding 4.3 million.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today\n\nAdditionally, despite the launch of Ethscriptions, there doesn\u2019t appear to be a noticeable impact on the number of active addresses within the last 24 hours. As of this writing, there were approximately 465,000 active addresses within that timeframe."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA pricy Ethereum NFT from one of Web3\u2019s preeminent PFP collections has been permanently removed from circulation and symbolically tied to an Ordinals inscription, as a group of Bitcoiners celebrate the costly, eye-catching endeavor.\n\nCryptoPunk #8611 sold for around 55 Ethereum or $95,000 on Saturday, according to Etherescan. And hours later, the NFT was burned in a way that points to inscription 12,456,749, an NFT-like asset on Bitcoin that bears the same image as its predecessor.\n\nThe decision to effectively destroy CryptoPunk #8611 was a community-led effort conducted by Wolf Capital Developer Nathan Stein on Twitter and holders of Bitcoin Bandits, a Western-themed collection of Ordinals inscriptions, a spokesperson for the project told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe community rallied behind the idea like crazy,\u201d the Bitcoin Bandits spokesperson said, adding that around 150 people contributed to the cause.\n\nWhen a digital asset is burned, it\u2019s locked up for eternity in a digital wallet that nobody controls, and CryptoPunk #8611 has been put to rest in a well-known burn address that also contains $21 million worth of Ethereum.\n\n\u201cWhat a wild night,\u201d an account named Minh on Twitter told Decrypt, who also posted a video documenting the purchase and burning of CryptoPunk #8611. He described the move as \u201cchaotic, yet beautiful.\u201d\n\nOrdinals, a buzzy Bitcoin protocol that launched earlier this year, is used to create NFT-like assets on Bitcoin by \u201cinscribing\u201d data to individual satoshi, the smallest denomination of currency a Bitcoin can be broken down into. That data can include pictures, videos, or even plain text, which people have used to create BRC-20 tokens.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile NFTs could be considered a nascent industry or an emerging frontier for digital art, Ordinals inscriptions are much more new, leading to a wave of hype, bugs, and scams surrounding crypto\u2019s oldest coin.\n\nAs the community surrounding Ordinals continues to take shape, siphoning off pricy NFTs from the Ethereum space and pointing them in the direction of other assets on Bitcoin is becoming a more common move, referred to as teleburning.\n\nSo, if Saturday\u2019s CryptoPunk burn sounds somewhat familiar, that\u2019s because it\u2019s not the first time a pricy NFT has been burned by someone looking to symbolically shift an asset\u2019s underlying chain from Ethereum to Bitcoin.\n\nIn February, an NFT from the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection worth around $169,000 at the time was burned by Jason Williams, who told Decrypt not long after that, essentially, \u201cthrowing a Lamborghini into a trash compactor\u201d is kind of fun.\n\nNotably, Yuga Labs, creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club, told Decrypt that the Ordinals inscription tied to Williams\u2019 BAYC NFT represents an illegitimate ape, explaining only tokens that come from the project's original smart contract are considered valid, granting holders commercial rights and access to events.\n\nHowever, unlike Williams\u2019 maneuver, CryptoPunk #8611 wasn\u2019t burned purely for entertainment, according to Stein.\n\nThe end goal is to create a series of Ordinals inscriptions that correspond to a slice of ownership in CryptoPunk #8611\u2014even though the underlying asset itself can no longer be owned by anyone on its original chain.\n\nThat collection of inscriptions will be created after the one that currently points to CryptoPunk #8611 is ceremonially sent to a digital wallet that belongs to Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, in what is effectively a one-way trip, Stein said in a tweet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPhase #2 1- Send money to escrow\n\n2- Escrow buys Punk for them\n\n3- Escrow burns & inscribes it on BTC\n\n4- Escrow sends the punk to Satoshis wallet Ok! Now we have burned Punk 2 times LMAO Whats next? \u2014 NatanStein (@natan_stein) June 16, 2023\n\nMembers of the Bitcoin Bandits community who pooled funds together to purchase CryptoPunk #8611 have also been entered into a contest related to a separate inscriptions project\u2014but that\u2019s beside the point, the spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cBandits did it more to show the way,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe Bandits Community thinks that CryptoPunks deserve better than ETH.\u201d"

        "content": "As Ethereum faces a market sell-off, investors are eyeing other promising opportunities. Litecoin, with its upcoming halving event, is garnering attention, while the Collateral Network, a rising star in the crypto lending space, is set to disrupt traditional lending norms.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum: A Shift in the Wind\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been a staple in the portfolios of many crypto investors. However, recent market trends have seen a shift in sentiment.\n\nIn recent developments, Ethereum\u2019s price collapse has been a cause for concern among investors. Ethereum\u2019s price has plunged by 7% due to a wave of risk-averse sentiment, sparking a sell-off that has left many investors questioning their holdings.\n\nThis sell-off is a result of a risk-off sentiment that has swept across the market, causing investors to reconsider their positions in Ethereum. Despite this, Ethereum remains a robust project with a solid foundation and a vibrant ecosystem.\n\nThe recent price plunge and the ensuing sell-off are significant in the context of Ethereum\u2019s role in the crypto market. As investors reassess their positions, the potential for other projects to gain traction increases. This is where Litecoin and Collateral Network come into play.\n\nLitecoin: Preparing for the Halving\n\nMiners and investors are preparing for the halving event that\u2019s coming up. As such, Litecoin is expected to have a price rise very soon.\n\nLitecoin, often referred to as the silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold, has seen an 8% price increase in the last month, despite the turbulence in the altcoin markets. This increase is largely attributed to the upcoming halving event, which has miners and investors alike on their toes.\n\nLitecoin was created by Charlie Lee as a lighter, faster version of Bitcoin. It offers quicker transaction confirmation times and a different hashing algorithm. Litecoin has consistently been in the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, making it a popular choice among investors.\n\nRecently, Litecoin has seen an uptick in activity as investors and miners prepare for the upcoming halving event. This event, which halves the reward for mining Litecoin, has historically led to a price increase. The anticipation of this event has likely contributed to the recent price surge.\n\nThe upcoming halving event and the recent price increase tie back to Litecoin\u2019s potential in the crypto market. As Ethereum holders look for other investment opportunities, Litecoin\u2019s recent developments make it a viable contender.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCollateral Network: The Rising Star\n\nCollateral Network, an Ethereum web3 peer-to-peer lending platform, presents a unique opportunity in the crypto market.\n\nCollateral Network allows users to borrow cryptocurrencies against physical assets on the blockchain. It addresses several problems in the lending industry, including difficulties in obtaining loans for non-traditional assets and the outdated pawnbroking industry. The platform offers benefits to both lenders and borrowers, making it an attractive proposition.\n\nLenders receive a fixed passive income, and real physical assets back the loans. Borrowers, on the other hand, can unlock cash from their assets quickly and discreetly, with competitive rates and flexible terms. The platform\u2019s native token, $COLT, offers additional benefits such as discounts on borrowing fees and interest, access to online auctions, and staking rewards.\n\nAlso, access to credit can be difficult for people based in certain countries. As such, with Collateral Network, users can borrow against their assets no matter their location.\n\nAnalysts predict a 3,500% price increase during the presale, with the price potentially reaching $0.35. The token will surge by 100x when listed on major exchanges. These figures, coupled with the platform\u2019s unique proposition, make Collateral Network a promising opportunity for investors looking to diversify their portfolios.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://presale.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ethereum Wading Through Unexplored Trails to Bounce Back - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "To boost the rally, the Ethereum ecosystem is expanding its reach in the Web3 gaming industry and NFT sector, voyaging through uncharted territory. The second biggest blockchain is making strides with significant development in gaming protocols. Also, an increase in gas fees and added interest in Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) could play a major role.\n\nEthereum Voyaging Through Uncharted Waters\n\nIn 2023, ETH price surged nearly 80% from $1,191.00 to $2,147.47 during the time of the Shapella upgrade. But it slides down by 19.47% to its current value of $1,728.11. Despite this volatility, ETH\u2019s comeback could be fueled by the flourishing gaming sector.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) made some announcements that negatively impacted Ether\u2019s price. But a general deviation towards gaming has the potential to instill positive sentiments and help reclaim the previous high price values.\n\nAlso, gaming protocols like Axie Infinity (AXS), and The Sandbox (SAND) along with their project tokens, SAND, CHZ, AXIE, and ENJ are experiencing noticeable growth on the blockchain. It was reported in a tweet earlier.\n\nDespite the market volatility, gaming tokens have seen a significant increase in the number of active addresses over the last 7 days.\n\n\n\nGaming on $ETH saw the largest week-over-week increase, with social project tokens such as $SAND, $ENJ, $CHZ, and $AXIE leading. pic.twitter.com/RIBkQlIBT6 \u2014 Artemis \ud83c\udff9 (@Artemis__xyz) June 15, 2023\n\nThe increase in gaming activity resulted in a subsequent rise in unique active wallets for these decentralized applications (dApps). The eventual result of the surge was a positive impact on transactions and overall network volume. If the scenario continues for some time, the ETH value could rise.\n\nAt press time, Ether is trading at $1,728.11 with a gain of 0.88% in the last 24 hours and a drop of 1.20% in the last 7 days. Its value against Bitcoin suffered by 0.52% to 0.06525 BTC. Market cap corrected by 0.91% to $207 Billion, and trading volume fell by 48.43% to $3.63 Billion. Ranking at number 2, ETH shares a market dominance of 19.44%.\n\nThe surge in gaming activity caused a rise in gas usage on the Ethereum network. An increase in gas usage proves to be beneficial for the blockchain, as it showcases increased network activity along with demand for dApps. In turn, it secures the network\u2019s utility and value proposition.\n\nBlockchain NFT arm is also witnessing a surge in interest, as the number of NFT trades on the network skyrocketed. The driving force for this surge is the newly minted collections. Also, a noticeable decline was reported in the volume of blue-chip NFT collections like MAYC, Azuki, and BAYC.\n\nAlong with these NFT fanatics, the number of validators on the blockchain also increased significantly. Data suggest that the number swelled by 7.09% in the last 30 days. However, the revenue generation expected from these validators suffered a decline of 46.35% in a similar time-lapse.\n\nThe sentiments regarding ETH are broadly negative, as 52.02% of the traders took a short position. It is pointing towards the underlying bearish sentiment among the traders.\n\nSource: TradingView; ETH/TetherUSD\n\nThe current price coincides with EMA, but a weak RSI indicates price correction. If the price falls, before entering the demand zone, it might bounce off immediate support. For a northbound journey, the ETH price would have to first fight immediate resistance before entering the Supply zone.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThe views and opinions stated by the author, or any people named in this article, are for informational purposes only, and they do not establish financial, investment, or other advice.

        "title": "What is Neo? China's Ethereum Rival - Asia Crypto Today",
        "content": "In an era where the digital economy is fast reshaping our understanding of finance and commerce, blockchain technology has surfaced as a pivotal innovator. Among the numerous platforms making strides in this space, NEO stands out, exhibiting a unique combination of technological advancements and forward-thinking economics. This guide delves into the heart of this dynamic platform, exploring its origins, distinctive features, security measures, dual-token system, and a plethora of benefits that make it a noteworthy player in the blockchain sphere.\n\nBackground\n\nEmerging in 2014 under the moniker Antshares, the NEO project aimed to innovate and lay the foundations for the \u201csmart economy\u201d. This innovative vision was spearheaded by Da HongFei and Erik Zhang, who then introduced the initial coin offering for Antshares (ANS). In the duration of the ICO, the founders successfully amassed over 6,000 BTC.\n\nIn 2016, Antshares underwent a significant metamorphosis and reemerged as NEO, in a move that offered ANS token holders the opportunity to transition their assets into the reimagined currency. The term \u201cNEO\u201d, which derives from the Greek language, symbolizes something that is \u201cnew\u201d or \u201cyoung\u201d. This terminology epitomizes the mission of the NEO project \u2013 to usher in a novel, advanced, and more efficient smart economy, boasting an impressive potential transaction processing rate of 10,000 transactions every second.\n\nAnnounced in 2018, the Neo 3.0 protocol update is the next leap forward in the project\u2019s development journey. This much-anticipated update was slated for official release in September 2021, symbolizing another important step towards realizing the project\u2019s ambitious vision.\n\nWhat is Neo?\n\nNEO is a blockchain platform engineered to revolutionize asset and identity management by leveraging the power of smart contracts. The ultimate ambition is the realization of a fully-digitized, smart economy. In this futuristic economic model, digital identities and digital assets play a pivotal role in enhancing life quality for all individuals.\n\nThe unique strength of NEO lies in its aspiration to streamline digital asset management, utilizing the capabilities of smart contracts. Ultimately, it seeks to erect a decentralized, network-driven, smart economy infrastructure facilitated by an ecosystem of decentralized applications. The goal here is not only to digitize but also to automate, making transactions, interactions, and operations far more efficient and secure than ever before.\n\nHow is the Neo Blockchain Secured?\n\nThe NEO blockchain utilizes the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus model alongside a distinctive protocol, delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT). This novel combination empowers NEO to process a vast number of transactions, reaching up to an impressive 10,000 transactions per second, while functioning across centrally endorsed nodes.\n\nThis hybrid of the PoS protocol and dBFT consensus mechanism furnishes NEO with the ability to scale its network effectively. It results in quicker transactions, smoother execution of smart contracts, and ease in the development of decentralized applications (Dapps).\n\nThe network supports two native tokens: NEO and GAS. NEO, which is indivisible, plays a central role in payment settlements on the platform and also has a significant role in network governance. NEO holders can stake their tokens to vote for consensus nodes. On the other hand, GAS, which is divisible up to 0.00000001, is utilized primarily for transaction fees. Consensus nodes, responsible for new block generation, receive rewards in GAS fees.\n\nFurthermore, the protocol offers a unique toolset for developers in the form of NeoContracts. These smart contracts allow for the creation and development of Dapps, directly mirroring real-world products and services. An attractive feature of NeoContracts is their compatibility with widely recognized programming languages such as Java, providing developers an advantage by not requiring them to learn a new language for Dapp development. This unique aspect sets them apart from smart contract protocols used by other Dapp networks.\n\nExploring NEO\u2019s Dual-Token System\n\nA defining feature of NEO is its pioneering dual-token mechanism, making it the first public blockchain platform to separate network usage rights from governance rights. This also facilitates easy acquisition of the required tokens for transaction fees.\n\nNEO\n\nIn the context of network governance, tokenholders are granted the privilege of voting for the Neo Committee. This committee consists of various members and consensus nodes that oversee the governance of the NEO blockchain. They are tasked with a variety of critical functions such as upholding the network\u2019s liveliness and making necessary adjustments to vital blockchain parameters.\n\nOne unique characteristic of NEO tokens is their indivisibility \u2013 the minimum unit of NEO is 1. This indicates that transactions, such as withdrawals from exchanges to wallets, can only occur in whole numbers. As a result, NEO stands out as one of the scarcest public blockchain tokens since it cannot be fragmented into smaller units.\n\nAt the inception of the network, 100 million coins were produced, with roughly half reserved by the Foundation to stimulate the development of the NEO ecosystem.\n\nGAS\n\nGAS, the second token in NEO\u2019s dual-token system, is utilized for operations and storage of tokens and smart contracts within the network. This practice prevents the misuse of node resources. System fees are destroyed, while network fees are redistributed amongst consensus nodes, offering an economic incentive for their contributions to the network.\n\nThe smallest unit of GAS is 0.00000001, and unlike some other networks, NEO doesn\u2019t require staking to claim GAS tokens. The majority of Neo wallets include a claim function, enabling users to gather their GAS at the click of a button. It\u2019s worth noting that some exchanges distribute GAS to users who hold NEO on their platform, while others don\u2019t.\n\nThe lion\u2019s share of GAS is disseminated to voters as a reward for their active involvement in network governance. Thus, NEO holders who wish to partake in this process should ensure they select a wallet that supports the voting function.\n\nAdvantages of Neo\n\nNEO, an open-source blockchain, shares common traits with Ethereum and other platforms that allow developers to craft smart contracts and construct decentralized applications (dApps). With the initiation of a migration to a new version, N3, in 2021, NEO showcased a series of intriguing features, which include:\n\nMultilingual Support: Aiming to be a developer-friendly blockchain, the protocol extends its support to various programming languages. The Neo Blockchain Toolkit, designed for creating blockchain applications, offers compatibility with C#, Python, Go, TypeScript, and Java.\n\nDecentralized Storage: The distributed, decentralized storage network, known as NeoFS, is a unique feature of NEO. This system enables the encryption and secure storage of data.\n\nNative Oracle: NEO boasts its own oracle service, allowing developers to tap into off-chain or external data sources. This unique feature adds a whole new level of versatility to the platform.\n\nSelf-sovereign Identity: The NeoID, a decentralized identity tool, allows for user authentication in blockchain-based applications. This offers users an extra layer of security and control over their digital identities.\n\nInteroperability: As a founding member of Poly Network, an alliance designed to facilitate cross-blockchain transactions, NEO embodies true interoperability. This membership enables transactions across a myriad of networks, including Ethereum and BNB Chain, thus increasing the overall functionality and reach of the platform.\n\nConclusion\n\nNEO serves as a beacon of innovation in the ever-evolving world of blockchain technology. Its commitment to creating a \u201csmart economy\u201d, coupled with its unique dual-token system and various other notable features, solidifies its position in the global blockchain ecosystem. NEO\u2019s mission to support multiple languages, offer decentralized storage, and provide native oracle services is a testament to its inclusive and adaptable nature.\n\nWith the ongoing development and implementation of advanced features, NEO remains poised to usher in the future of digitized assets and identities, carving a path towards a more secure, efficient, and interconnected digital economy. Whether you\u2019re a developer, investor, or a blockchain enthusiast, NEO\u2019s offerings undeniably hold vast potential in the years to come."
