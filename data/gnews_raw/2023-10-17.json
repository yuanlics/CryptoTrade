        "content": "In a recent interactive session, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, shed light on the platform\u2019s technical advances and celebrated emerging decentralized projects within its ecosystem.\n\nIn a recent Ask Me Anything (AMA) session, Ethereum Co-founder Vitalik Buterin touched on several topics that offer a glimpse into the potential trajectory of the Ethereum ecosystem. Drawing insights from a report by Odaily news, the discourse ranged from technical advancements to acknowledgments of decentralized projects, weaving a narrative of Ethereum\u2019s evolving landscape.\n\nForemost, Buterin delved into the intricacies of quantum resistance\u2014a burgeoning concern in the blockchain community given the potential of quantum computing to challenge existing cryptographic systems. He discussed the role of account abstraction, specifically through Ethereum\u2019s proposal ERC-4337.\n\nThis initiative, according to Buterin, can imbue users\u2019 accounts with quantum-resistant properties, fortifying Ethereum against future threats posed by quantum computers. Such a development underscores the proactive approach the Ethereum community is taking to ensure the blockchain\u2019s continued security and relevance.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin calls for privacy and decentralization\n\nBeyond the technical realm, Buterin also spotlighted some decentralized projects that exemplify innovation and impact within the Ethereum ecosystem. Polymarket, a decentralized prediction market platform, garnered Buterin\u2019s praise for its strides in decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nThe platform allows users to speculate on future events, illustrating the versatility of DeFi applications. PoolTogether, a no-loss lottery system built on Ethereum (ETH), similarly caught Buterin\u2019s attention. This unique model lets users pool funds, earn interest and stand a chance to win prizes\u2014a testament to the creative possibilities of blockchain technology.\n\nOn a more personal tangent, Buterin expressed his admiration for several cities around the globe. Singapore, Taipei, Vienna, Toronto and the New York State\u2019s City of Ithaca made the list, each resonating with Buterin for their distinctive mix of technological innovation and cultural vibrancy.\n\nIn wrapping up, the insights from Buterin\u2019s AMA serve as a compelling indicator of Ethereum\u2019s forward momentum, with an emphasis on both technological foresight and the value of innovative decentralized projects.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

In August, the SEC was ordered by a court to vacate its rejection of Grayscale\u2019s application to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. Last week, the SEC decided not to appeal the court\u2019s ruling in the Grayscale case or require Grayscale to refile its application, which could have delayed approval for as much as a year.\n\nAlthough the arrival of ethereum futures ETFs is a welcome step toward the mainstreaming of crypto, there\u2019s no assurance yet that the SEC will act immediately to approve the 10 pending spot bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nThe situation is frustrating for everyone. Everyone except SEC Chair Gary Gensler seems to understand that a spot bitcoin ETF would be in investors\u2019 best interests, and greatly enhance consumer safety and protection against fraud.\n\nETFs are deservedly the most popular investment vehicle in the world; they feature low costs, low account minimums, transparency, liquidity, and ease of portfolio management.\n\nIt\u2019s easy for advisors to engage in portfolio rebalancing, dollar cost averaging and tax loss harvesting.\n\nAccess to virtually every other asset class is available through ETFs \u2014 and there are even inverse, 3x and single-stock ETFs. So why not a bitcoin ETF?\n\nGensler\u2019s refusal has raised everyone\u2019s ire. Four members of Congress \u2014 two Republicans and two Democrats \u2014 wrote to the SEC in late September demanding that it approve these ETFs immediately."

        "title": "Ethereum restaking: Blockchain innovation or dangerous house of cards? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum restaking \u2014 proposed by middleware protocol EigenLayer \u2014 is a controversial innovation over the past year that has some of the brightest minds worried about the potential ramifications.\n\n\n\nRestaking involves reusing staked or locked-up Ether tokens to earn fees and rewards. The restaked tokens can then help secure and validate other protocols.\n\nProponents believe restaking can squeeze additional security and rewards from already staked ETH and grow the crypto ecosystem in a healthier way based on Ethereum\u2019s existing trust mechanisms. Restaking could serve as a security primitive for exporting Ethereum\u2019s trust generated by its validators to other projects.\n\nYet Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and a number of key devs worry that restaking is a house of cards that will inevitably tumble. Some of those Ethereum devs have even proposed a fork to head off restaking platform EigenLayer.\n\nWhy the project\u2019s founders promote \u201ctrust as a service\u201d from Ethereum without the Ethereum founder and others\u2019 willingness to participate is still to play out. Will the whole concept result in an Ethereum fork to protect the network from catastrophic failure?\n\nThe way eth Community turned on EigenLayer should be studied, it\u2019s not for building, just side @BanklessHQ deals with canto n other grifters, we gonna keep forking yall ideas tho on other non zuzalu shit https://t.co/7Erh6qKVSE \u2014 \u27e0yumatrades.eth\u27e0 \u2013 #6585 (\ud83d\ude08,\ud83d\ude07) (@yumatrades) May 22, 2023\n\nStaking and restaking\n\nStaking is a crypto-native concept. On Ethereum, it means putting up a security bond in ETH so that the validator (validators of new transactions who maintain the security of the blockchain) will behave honestly in verifying transactions rather than lose their staked tokens. Stakers are then paid rewards for locking up this ETH.\n\nIn essence, stakers lock up their tokens to commit to producing Ethereum blocks \u2014 an on-chain way of supporting development, regardless of fluctuations in highly volatile token prices.\n\nSo what is restaking?\n\nIn short, restaking works in that already staked Ethereum tokens can be rehypothecated (when a lender re-uses collateral posted from one loan to take out a new loan) to secure a wider variety of applications and accrue additional rewards.\n\nBut restakers also get penalized or slashed for non-performance of their staking tasks. (More on that below).\n\nSo restaking is a crypto primitive for generating economic security from Ethereum\u2019s nine years of concerted developer activity and project track record.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an extension protocol to extend what Ethereum can do, scaling out Ethereum stakers beyond Ethereum to other bridges and oracles that need to be secured,\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan tells Magazine.\n\n\n\nHe says EigenLayer is commoditizing ETH staking to make it more general purpose, as, in crypto parlance, \u201cstaking is the root of trust.\u201d\n\nKannan is an academic on leave from the University of Washington, and EigenLayer began as academic research into \u201cexported trust\u201d as a consensus protocol. Basically, he sought to piggyback the trust generated by Ethereum to other ecosystems.\n\nKannan essentially seeks to export the \u201ctrust\u201d generated by Ethereum for other projects across the ecosystem and other chains. \u201cIn crypto, mechanisms for trust mean that investors need skin in the game. The pseudonymous world needs carrots and sticks whereby validators are distributed.\u201d He calls it \u201cpermissionless innovation.\u201d\n\nThe best each chain has to offer\n\nThe big idea for EigenLayer is to bridge blockchains and create super applications, taking the best each chain has to offer. Kannan says \u201cevery ecosystem is better in some dimension, but not all dimensions,\u201d and EigenLayer enhancing decentralized tech stacks will actually benefit the industry.\n\nKannan said that what can be built with EigenLayer fits roughly into two categories.\n\n\n\nFirstly, EigenLayer allows for the construction of bridges from chain to chain, say Ethereum to Avalanche. EigenLayer acts as a marketplace for \u201cdecentralized trust,\u201d connecting stakers seeking yields, projects built on EigenLayer offering risk-reward structures for yields, and operators acting as bridges between stakers and projects.\n\nSecondly, a set of smart contracts on Ethereum\u2019s chain lets ETH stakers opt to run other software. EigenLayer could, for example, improve Ethereum transaction finality speeds. ETH stakers can now take the layer-1 blockchain Fantom chain (for better transaction finality times) and fork it on EigenLayer, thereby running a layer as a super fast finalization layer with an EigenLayer trust layer.\n\nBut it\u2019s all still theoretical.\n\nThe idea of restaking makes sense theoretically, helping projects build off Ethereum\u2019s security layer \u2014 but the problems worry many.\n\nIn theory, \u201cit\u2019s like the NATO security alliance; each country is still a sovereign country, but their mutual defense pact is secured by the sum of their military power,\u201d Sunny Aggarwal, co-founder of Osmosis Labs and creator of a similar restaking system \u2014 Mesh, on Cosmos\u2019 chain \u2014 told Magazine.\n\nIn practice, EigenLayer provides two ways to restake: whitelisted liquid staking derivatives can be restaked with EigenLayer or an EigenPod (a smart contract can be created to run a validator while restaking). But most restakers won\u2019t run their own validator, so new networks can build projects without their own communities of validators.\n\nEigenLayer isn\u2019t live yet, and it\u2019s impact is still highly speculative, according to Anthony \u201c0xSassal\u201d Sassano, a full-time Ethereuem educator, founder of YouTube channel The Daily Gwei and an early investor in EigenLayer.\n\nTo date, there\u2019s only a smart contract for staked ETH to bootstrap the EigenLayer network, and perhaps given EigenLayer\u2019s hype, people are depositing their ETH into that network, expecting to farm an unconfirmed airdrop of native EigenLayer tokens.\n\nA force for good or evil?\n\nTo be successful, new consensus protocols need a balanced alignment of incentives. Trust is like a scale weighing competing interests. And trying to export Ethereum security layers to different blockchain ecosystems worries some. Many are still trying to understand if it\u2019s a force for good or evil \u2014 or both.\n\n\u201cThere are two camps: those excited by broadening the use case of ETH staking, and then there are those that worry about potential attack vectors on Ethereum and potential negative consequences for Ethereum if something goes wrong with EigenLayer. My view is in the middle; I understand the concerns and the excitement.\u201d Sassano says.\n\n\u201cInherently, all of this is complex; it depends which rabbit hole you want to go down. The simple answer is that Ethereum, as a network, currently has over 25 million ETH at stake \u2014 that\u2019s tens of billions of dollars. So restaking is asking, what if we could harness that economic security for other purposes than just securing the Ethereum chain?\u201d\n\nSassano continues: \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what EigenLayer is trying to do, to generalize the security that Ethereum has with its stakers and expand that to other things like an oracle network or a data availability network. It\u2019s inherently more technical and complex than that, but that\u2019s the gist of it.\u201d\n\nThere are two types of danger that restaking could pose: first for \u201crestakers\u201d and then for Ethereum itself.\n\nRestaking creates too much leverage\n\nRestaking is controversial as it is akin to leveraged investing through borrowing. Some argue that the danger here is that the hunger for \u201creal yields\u201d or actual revenue that emerged in crypto in 2022 leads to unsavory developments, like restaking.\n\nJae Sik Choi, portfolio manager at Greythorn Asset Management, told Magazine that securing networks through restaking could work, but restaking is akin to leverage:\n\n\u201cJust like how Terra\u2019s over-leveraged \u2018safe\u2019 collateralization of Luna was, there would always be a risk of participants over-leveraging into this new concept, and such a risk won\u2019t be quantifiable until we see more data sets throughout the emergence of this new restaking narrative.\u201d\n\nDan Bar, chief investment officer at Bitfwd Capital \u2014 a boutique crypto assets hedge fund \u2014 agreed that restaking amounts to leverage, telling Magazine: \u201cWhile moderate schemes of restaking could be beneficial for capital efficiency purposes, any crypto assets manager and finance professional worth their salt knows too well how easily and quickly leverage can turn into a slew of synthetic toxic financial instruments that bring disasters into even the most healthy of ecosystems.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd maybe that\u2019s the first major problem. Investors will only see restaking as quick, easily leveraged financial products. EigenLayer building an open-source, decentralized network security may fail to convince doubters.\n\nRisks to Ethereum itself\n\nOne fear is that slashing on EigenLayer will affect Ethereum itself.\n\n\n\nEthereum\u2019s proof-of-stake trust system keeps everyone in check with slashing conditions \u2014 essentially non-performance penalties. Programmable slashing means restakers have additional computational responsibilities and face consequences for non-execution.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin fears an overload of the chain\u2019s consensus, basically, computational overloads, if the blockchain\u2019s computational power is suddenly redirected elsewhere.\n\nKannan admits that Vitalik\u2019s concerns are valid. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to shard Ethereum\u2019s trust layer, and we don\u2019t want contagion of nefarious actors leveraging Ethereum\u2019s trust system.\u201d\n\n\n\nSassano also notes that the functionality of Ethereum proof-of-stake was designed to make sure that there won\u2019t be a sudden influx or outflux of validators, which would affect the core properties of Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism.\n\nThe issue is that EigenLayer will decide where to take ETH from, but they can\u2019t slash a validator on Ethereum.\n\n\u201cIn Ethereum, there\u2019s also a queue for validators to enter or exit each day. So let\u2019s say, in an extreme example, 30% of all staked ETH begins staking with EigenLayer and say that all 30% gets \u2018slashed\u2019 by EigenLayer. While it depends on what the slashing condition was, let\u2019s say all this ETH was lost because they tried to do something really bad. Even if all 30% had to be exited, there\u2019s a limit on how much can exit per day. It would take literally years to exit 30% of ETH stake. So I understand people\u2019s concerns, but at the same time, other things built on top cannot dictate what happens on Ethereum.\u201d\n\nSo, restakers should have to play by Ethereum\u2019s rules.\n\nYet Sassano\u2019s biggest concern is around the calculus of ETH staking, which may one day become a question of whether stakers get more from staking on EigenLayer than Ethereum itself. This could erode the Ethereum staking model in time.\n\nHe is confident, though, that Ethereum\u2019s tech offsets those systemic risks: \u201cIt\u2019s not a critical risk to Ethereum if you are slashed on EigenLayer. You are not slashed on Ethereum. EigenLayer cannot cause you to be slashed on Ethereum because Ethereum has its own slashing conditions built into the protocol. And EigenLayer has its own separate slashing conditions built into its protocol as well.\u201d\n\nAnything built on top of Ethereum introduces additional complexity and risk. Juan David Mendieta Villegas, co-founder and chairman at crypto market maker Keyrock, tells Magazine:\n\n\u201cEigenLayer is an interesting development but creates additional attack vectors without providing explicit benefits to the Ethereum ecosystem itself. If we take a step back, it\u2019s important to note that ETH staking has introduced a base benchmark yield for the industry, and that is a good development. You can almost think of it as a \u2018risk-free\u2019 rate. Any additional layers, such as liquid staking derivatives and re-staking mechanisms, of course, can carry more concerns such as concentration risk, security and smart contract.\u201d\n\nBut Villegas wishes EigenLayer well. \u201cOverall, we\u2019re advocates of the innovations that are happening around staking and want to see multiple protocols win as this will assist in the decentralization and democratization of the network.\u201d\n\nIn other words, he wishes for competitors to EigenLayer to create similar products.\n\nGreat conversation. The TLDR is that basically Justin, Vitalik, and Dankrad all agree that restaking is a giant existential threat to Ethereum if it gets big (if it even works at all). These guys are all way too nice, but this was a brutal takedown of Eigenlayer. The takeaway\u2026 https://t.co/kY8gKmzxrF \u2014 the_fett (@themandalore9) June 30, 2023\n\nRestaking could make or break new projects\n\nCosmos\u2019 Aggarwal believes restaking will only benefit those blockchains with existing network effects for those with existing economic alliances or overlapping communities.\n\nHe also sees restaking protocols akin to a venture capital arm for layer 1s that might discourage solo stakers and further centralize networks.\n\nIn the end, competing layer-1 blockchains probably won\u2019t engage in restaking across chains. For that reason, he feels that EigenLayer\u2019s design could be improved.\n\nWhile EigenLayer is designed as a security system importing trust from Ethereum, builders will create their own tokens and revenue models. This has pluses and minuses.\n\nIn some cases, dodgy new tokens may benefit from Ethereum\u2019s trust layer. Choi thinks \u201cthis trust layer benefit could potentially be moot due to the tokenomics that these alt layer 1s would want to try and attain (i.e., the use of their own token \u2014 their own agendas) could be problematic and so any supposed trust exported from Ethereum is lost anyway.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, experimental, well-meaning projects may now have a chance at success thanks to EigenLayer. That\u2019s why Choi thinks the ultimate potential benefit EigenLayer is proposing is that other blockchains that do not want to spin up their own validator and staker sets have a chance at scaling to success.\n\nAggarwal also notes that with appropriate checks, restaking should be set within parameters to control risk. Restaking primitives need cleverly programmed governance, such as discounted voting power to restaked tokens on another chain. For example, one restaker can\u2019t have more than 20% of the vote for another chain.\n\nSo, is restaking a good thing for Ethereum?\n\n\u201cThe purists would say Ethereum should only be securing the Ethereum Beacon Chain and nothing else. [They] shouldn\u2019t be exporting Ethereum security to anything else. But I don\u2019t think that is necessarily a bad thing to get node operators to do other work,\u201d says Sassano.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf it can happen on the Ethereum network, it will happen. If the network can\u2019t resist it and Ethreuem\u2019s chain becomes insecure because of it, and there are adverse effects because of it, then Ethereum as a protocol was not designed correctly and needs to be improved.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll find out soon enough."

ETH is now struggling to clear the $1,605 and $1,620 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum is attempting a recovery wave above the $1,570 level.\n\nThe price is trading just above $1,575 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,572 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could rise further if there is a close above the $1,620 resistance level.\n\nEthereum Price Gains Traction\n\nEthereum started a fresh increase from the $1,520 level. ETH gained traction like Bitcoin and spiked above the $1,600 resistance level. It even climbed above $1,620, but the bears appeared near $1,650.\n\nA high was formed near $1,669 before there was a fresh decline. Ether trimmed gains and settled below the $1,600 level. It tested the $1,575 support and is currently consolidating near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,669 swing high to the $1,574 low.\n\nEthereum is now trading just above $1,575 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,572 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nOn the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $1,605 level. The first major resistance is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,669 swing high to the $1,574 low at $1,620. A close above the $1,620 resistance might start a decent increase.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIn the stated case, Ether could rise and recover toward the $1,665 resistance. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $1,750.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,605 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,575 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThe next key support is $1,550. A downside break below the $1,550 support might send the price further lower. In the stated case, the price could drop toward the $1,520 level. Any more losses may perhaps send Ether toward the $1,440 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,575\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,620\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Discussions about these predictions by Scaramucci could form a riveting part of the narrative as industry experts explore the potential future of cryptocurrencies.\n\nScaramucci postulates a bullish scenario for Bitcoin, attributing his confidence to the post-halving cycle which historically propels a surge in demand, in an interview with Altcoin Daily.\n\nHe states, \u201cI believe six to 12 months after the halving cycle, there\u2019s no reason why Bitcoin couldn\u2019t be at $100,000. Just given what I know about demand and given what I know about the cycle and where the miners are, and so forth, plus, we may get some interest rate relief. That\u2019s a 3x bump.\u201d\n\nHis prediction reflects a tripling in Bitcoin\u2019s value, which he analogizes to the technological advancements that have historically witnessed such price surges.\n\nWhile Scaramucci admits to not being as intimately acquainted with Ethereum, he nonetheless holds a positive stance.\n\nAlso Read: Fed Governor Michelle Bowman Says Creation Of US CBDC 'Could Pose Significant Risks'\n\nHighlighting the technological improvements and the increasing utility that Ethereum offers, he said, \u201cCould Ethereum be $4,500 by then? Why not? You know it\u2019s a great utility. Speeds have improved. The layer-2s have helped it. Why not? Why couldn\u2019t it be $4,500? These things are maturing.\u201d\n\nHis optimism extends to Algorand, albeit with a tempered tone due to its current trading price. Despite the crypto\u2019s present modest trading range of around $0.09 to $0.10, Scaramucci sees potential for growth.\n\nHe envisions a path to $0.30 per token as Algorand continues to develop and garner adoption, especially from corporations enamored by its technology.\n\nHe adds, \u201cI\u2019m bullish. I thought at $1 it could have easily gotten to $5... but could Algorand from here... could it be a $0.30 token as they continue their development and continue the adoption of what they\u2019re doing and bringing in corporations that love the technology? I believe it can.\u201d\n\nRead Next: Binance.US Changes Terms: No More Direct Withdrawals Of US Dollars From Platform\n\nJoin Benzinga's Fintech Deal Day & Awards on Nov. 13 and Future of Digital Assets on Nov. 14 in New York City to stay updated on trends like AI, regulations, SEC actions and institutional adoption in the crypto space.

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst is naming a number of potential bullish catalysts for Ethereum (ETH) competitor Solana (SOL).\n\nIn a new video, the anonymous host of InvestAnswers tells his 447,000 YouTube subscribers that Solana is receiving more mainstream attention amid key program developments.\n\n\u201cI see a number of different tailwinds for Solana. It is still riskier than ETH. ETH is the 800-pound gorilla. Nearly everything runs on Ethereum. And it\u2019s very hard to knock that rider off the horse. But let me talk to you about some of the tailwinds\u2026\n\nThe world is waking up to it now, all the narratives, [the] mainstream media. You got Fidelity talking about ETH and SOL alongside each other. You have that other report coming out from Standard Chartered Bank. They said ETH is going to $8,000 and they also referenced Solana in their research paper that Solana could eat a lot of ETH market share, especially around things like tokenization, which was huge.\u201d\n\nThe analyst lists a number of tailwinds for Solana, including Solana Pay, which recently integrated with Shopify, and the project\u2019s crypto-friendly smartphone Saga.\n\n\u201cBut the tailwinds are Solana Pay, Saga phone, the decentralized app store. They\u2019ve got EVMs (Ethereum virtual machine) and SVMs (Solana virtual machine) built on Solana so now SOL-to-ETH bridging is very capable.\n\nFiredancer and one million transactions per second, that\u2019s coming. They hope to come out of beta at the end of this year and launch sometime in 2024. But that will bring resilience, efficiency, decentralization and security. This whole thing is built on C++, whereas Ethereum is built on Rust\u2026 And if they have both up and running, there is no risk of ever any downtime again.\n\nAlso, cost-efficiency and scalability, the Visa partnership, great tokenomics, gaming, tokenization of the world.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $24.18 at time of writing, up 9.27% in the last 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum or Bitcoin: Which one is a better investment in 2023? - Bitrates",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies are very popular, and many people and sectors have begun to consider and embrace them in their everyday lives.\n\nAlthough digital assets are volatile, some virtual currencies appeal to investors, as they are considered relatively safe investments because they have shown their ability to recover from hard periods. Also, both virtual coins have brought massive gains to investors. This is why, even if joining the crypto world sometimes feels like a rollercoaster ride, investors can benefit if they are willing to take risks.\n\nBut in many cases, people don\u2019t know what to choose between the two alternatives and wonder which one is a better investment. Bitcoin and Ethereum have different characteristics, and this is why they fulfill distinct purposes. It is hard to pick one over the other, as both are good options depending on what you want to achieve with them.\n\nSo, let\u2019s look at the two most important cryptocurrencies and see their characteristics and differences.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin was the first digital coin developed in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. It was created to provide an alternative to fiat money, which is why it is a decentralized and transparent financial system that everyone can easily access. Bitcoin relies on blockchain technology, which means that the transactions can\u2019t be altered as they are recorded on a public ledger, and because of that, they are more resistant to fraud.\n\nBefore Bitcoin, more attempts were made to create cryptocurrencies, but none succeeded. This is why Bitcoin is the pioneer of all the other cryptocurrencies launched in the following years.\n\nThe main advantages of Bitcoin are the following:\n\nIt is the crypto with the most liquidity\n\nIt had a massive growth over the last few years\n\nIt offers faster transaction speed\n\nIt is a safer alternative, as it uses blockchain to prevent fraud or identity theft\n\nIts value is based on supply and demand and not on political interference\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is the second leading cryptocurrency, which brought many innovations in the crypto game. Ethereum was launched in 2015, and since then, it has been a popular open-ended platform where users can develop smart contracts and dApps. Also, Ethereum has more purposes besides trading, as it can be used to buy goods and services. Ethereum\u2019s strengths lie in its utility, bringing many opportunities in the crypto sector.\n\nEthereum was created to overcome the shortcomings of Bitcoin, and it succeeded with that, as Ethereum is not just a blockchain where you can trade digital coins, but the platform also supports NFTs and benefits many sectors, including travel and music.\n\nThese are the main benefits of Ethereum:\n\nThe transactions are processed quickly\n\nIt has many users and a large community\n\nIt uses blockchain technology for its decentralized system\n\nIt enables many functionalities, like decentralized applications and smart contracts\n\nIt is a more sustainable and scalable option\n\nWhat are the differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have significant similarities because they are both decentralized networks, and no third party or central authority controls their operations and transactions. But despite the similarities, some differences set them apart. These are the most visible discrepancies between the two of them.\n\nNetwork utility\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin are very different regarding their network utility. Experts agree that Bitcoin has no utility besides being a value store. On the other hand, Ethereum brings limitless possibilities. For example, Ethereum enables the development of dApps and smart contracts, giving users many advantages.\n\nGas fees\n\nRegarding transaction fees, Ethereum loses out to Bitcoin. And although Ethereum enables quicker transactions than Bitcoin, unfortunately, the gas fees are quite significant. The Ethereum community is slowly taking action towards this aspect, which is why things will probably change.\n\nDifferent energy consumption\n\nA major difference between the two cryptos is how they consume energy. Both Ethereum and Bitcoin initially used the proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism to validate transactions and secure the blockchain. However, as crypto enthusiasts wanted a change, Ethereum switched to a proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, reducing energy consumption. The change was praised, as it decreased energy usage by more than 99%, which was wanted for a long time.\n\nWhich of the two cryptocurrencies is a better investment in 2023?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are both good alternatives to be considered as they have increased their value since they were first launched in the market. However, because they have unique features, it is hard to say which one is a better investment, as it differs depending on everyone\u2019s goals and needs. Bitcoin is a great option for anyone who wants an alternative to fiat money. On the other hand, Ethereum is more than just a digital asset, so it can be a better choice for those who want more features, as this network also allows users to sell or buy goods and develop dApps.\n\nBut cryptos are volatile, so investments in any type of cryptocurrencies involve risks, whether choosing Ethereum or Bitcoin. So, anyone who wants to invest in digital assets must be prepared to navigate through the challenges of this industry. Experts recommend allocating only a small part of the digital assets in their portfolio and opting for more than one alternative, as the more diversified the portfolio, the safer it will be.\n\nIt is good to research before making an impulsive decision and not consider cryptos only because they are popular. The fear of missing out, also known as FOMO, can lead to impulsive buying, which will not be beneficial, as investors could have considerable losses. Instead, anyone wanting to invest in cryptos must adopt a long-term view and focus on creating a strong portfolio. The most successful stories with investing in cryptos come from disciplined investors who didn\u2019t let their emotions influence their decisions. Also, they invest as much as they can afford to lose and never more.\n\nFinal words\n\nAlthough there are many differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin, it is hard to say which one is a better investment, as both represent good alternatives depending on anyone\u2019s needs and desires."

        "content": "Tokenized Real-World Asset Market to Hit $10 Trillion By 2030, 21.co Projects \u2013 Can RWAs Power Ethereum (ETH) to Multi-Trillion Market Cap?\n\nEther Logo / Source: Adobe\n\nThe market capitalization of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) could balloon to as much as $10 trillion by the end of the decade in a bullish scenario, argued digital asset management company 21.co in a recently released report.\n\nEven in a bearish scenario, the market cap of tokenized RWAs will still reach $3.5 trillion before 2030, 21.co projected.\n\nThe market cap of tokenized RWAs was last around $116 billion, with USD-pegged stablecoins accounting for around 97% of this.\n\nAround 60% of all tokenized RWAs currently in existence are issued on the Ethereum blockchain, which remains the most widely used layer-1 protocol in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Token (NFT) and web3 worlds.\n\nThese digital dollars mark the \u201cfirst successful tokenization implementation\u201d, according to 21.co.\n\nUSD-pegged stablecoins like Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC allow crypto users to transfer an asset that almost exactly approximates the real value of an actual US dollar to one another in a permissionless, censorship-resistant, borderless and near-instant manner.\n\nBoth cryptocurrencies are backed 1:1 with real US dollar or liquid-equivalent sat in bank accounts controlled by Tether and Circle.\n\n21.co noted rapid growth in other areas of asset tokenization, pointing to the 450% growth rate seen in the tokenized US government bond market, which has been aided by the fact that US bond yields have risen to multi-decade highs this year.\n\nRWAs \u2013 The Convergence of TradFi and Crypto\n\n\u201cThe convergence between crypto and traditional asset classes, including fiat currencies, equities, government bonds, and real estate, is experiencing an unprecedented growth,\u201d 21.co noted in its report.\n\nAs the crypto sector matures, more and more traditional institutions will build their own products on top of blockchains, the analysts argued.\n\n\u201cThrough this transition, crypto will increasingly integrate with existing financial software and bring RWAs on-chain via tokenization\u201d.\n\nRegulatory barriers and a potential lack of standardized processes are amongst the factors that 21.co thinks could slow the growth and adoption of tokenized RWAs.\n\nTokenized RWAs to Power Ether (ETH) to Multi-Trillion Dollar Market Cap?\n\nAssuming blockchains like Ethereum are able to maintain a dominant position as a place to issue tokenized RWAs, this could substantially bolster the demand for Ether (ETH) in the years ahead.\n\nEther (ETH) is the native token of the Ethereum blockchain and is used to pay gas fees that power transactions and blockchain activity.\n\nEther\u2019s market cap was last around $188 billion, around 3x more than the $60 billion in tokenized assets currently issued directly onto its blockchain.\n\nBut if by 2030, the blockchain hosts 60% of $10 trillion in tokenized RWAs, it wouldn\u2019t be out of the question to see Ether become multi-trillion dollar asset, potentially even rivalling gold\u2019s market cap, which was last around $12.8 trillion.\n\nThat being said, Ether has been performing poorly recently, down over 6% on the month and over 25% lower since this year\u2019s highs.\n\nWeek demand for the recently launched Ether futures ETFs in the US and weak on-chain activity that has seen the Ether supply turn inflationary once again are two factors explaining recent weak performance.\n\nFalling yields on staked ETH (last at around 3.5% APY) at a time when US bond yields are rising (the 10-year is above 4.8%) is another structural headwinds, while still relatively high transaction fees and relatively slow transaction times continue to act as a barrier to adoption.\n\nEther was last trading in the $1,570 area, with bears eyeing a break below a key long-term support in the low $1,500s that could open the door to a drop towards the sub-$1,400 March lows."

        "content": "The team behind the project confirmed the Mainnet launch, although blockchain data shows it has been live since Oct. 8.\n\nLayer 2 scaling solution Scroll, a new zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) compatible protocol, has confirmed its Mainnet launch.\n\nIn a Tuesday update on X, the team behind the project said that the Scroll Mainnet was live, along with an accompanying blog post announcing the development.\n\nScroll was founded by a collective of passionate Ethereum enthusiasts and open-source contributors with the goal of scaling Ethereum through zero-knowledge cryptography. \u2014 Scroll \ud83d\udcdc (@Scroll_ZKP) October 17, 2023\n\nBlockchain data from the Etherscan block explorer shows that Scroll\u2019s smart contracts have actually been live since Oct. 8, meaning the team likely waited on making the launch public until this week.\n\n\u201cAfter three successful testnets spanning over 15 months with extensive testing and rigorous security audits, we are thrilled to announce that Scroll Mainnet has officially launched for everyone to use,\u201d wrote the Scroll team in the blog.\n\nThe security audits for Scroll\u2019s bridge and rollup contracts were audited by OpenZeppelin and Zellic, while its zkEVM circuits were reviewed by Trail of Bits, Zellic, and KALOS.\n\nThrough its sequence of testnets, the team monitored over 450,000 smart contracts that were deployed and over 90 million total transactions. The team also plans to continue using Scroll Sepolia as a testing ground for all upgrades to the Mainnet.\n\nScroll joins a growing list of zkEVM scaling solutions that launched this year, including Polygon\u2019s zkEVM and Matter Labs\u2019 zkSync Era. The scaling solutions essentially provide lower transaction costs at higher throughput by batching transactions together off-chain.\n\nOptimistic rollups, like those offered by Arbitrum and OP Labs, also offer similar functionality to scale Ethereum-based applications but differ from zk rollups in their inherent design.\n\nFor instance, optimistic rollups can run smart contracts on the main blockchain directly, while zk rollups are unable to do so. However, zk rollups don\u2019t require cryptographic validity proofs and hence eliminate the waiting periods during which transaction validity may be challenged on an optimistic rollup.\n\nEthereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin said at an ETH Seoul event that he believes zk rollups will eventually surpass optimistic rollups for this reason, although he acknowledged that the zk technology is still more complicated to build."

        "content": "The crypto market is witnessing high volatility this week as the market participants remain uncertain regarding the updates of Bitcoin spot ETH. As a result, the ETH price recovery from $1530 support has started experiencing notable supply pressure around the $1600 mark. Will the failed excitement lead to further correction in Ethereum?\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum L2 Scroll Mainnet Launch Marks Milestone in Ethereum Scalability\n\nadvertisement\n\nShould you Buy at $1500 Support?\n\nA bullish divergence in the momentum indicator RSI indicates the accelerating buying pressure at the $1500 mark\n\nAn upside breakout from the $1745 resistance would set a new recovery cycle in ETH\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $4.6 Billion, indicating a 17% loss.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nOver the last two months, the Ethereum price has been largely confined to a sideways trend, bounded by $1745 and $1630. Despite the coin making noteworthy price swings within this range, there has been no decisive move in either direction.\n\nThe attempted recovery that began on October 13th, originating from the range support at $1533, faced immediate supply pressure around $1600, stopping the coin\u2019s upward trajectory mid-way. This stalled recovery points towards a likely retest of the $1530 support level and potentially even the lower trendlines of a rising wedge pattern that has been leading ETH\u2019s price movement for the past 16 months.\n\nThus, the ETH price potential retest to the lower trendline could increase the demand pressure needed by buyers to escape the current consolidation. An upside breakout from the overhead resistance of $1745 would give an additional confirmation for traders to go bullish.\n\nIs ETH Price At Risk Of Further Fall?\n\nIn the daily time frame, the ETH price action is governed by the rising wedge formation. As long as the two trendlines defining this setup remain intact, this coin may sustain its upward trajectory, serving as a dynamic support zone for buyers during market corrections. However, if we consider a more pessimistic scenario, a breakdown below this lower boundary could spell the onset of a major correction in the Ethereum coin.\n\nRelative Strength Index. The daily RSI slope rise reflects the buyers\u2019 increasing accumulation at the $1500 mark.\n\nBollinger Band. The flattish upper and lower boundary of the Bollinger Band indicator accentuates the sideways trend in this altcoin."

Discover SCENE\n\nThe queue for adding new staking validators on Ethereum briefly hit zero yesterday.\n\nIt's now risen again to 996 validators, but it's still a far cry from its peak on June 10, when over 96,500 validators faced a waiting period of over 45 days, per Beaconcha.in data.\n\nIn broad strokes, the slowdown suggests a dwindling appetite for staking Ethereum.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nValidators are responsible for proposing and validating new blocks on a proof-of-stake blockchain like Ethereum. In return, they receive a reward for their contribution to the network. An Ethereum validator must stake a minimum of 32 ETH to begin operating.\n\nImportantly, the reward has also dropped from its June peak of 5.2% yield\u2013doled out in ETH\u2013to 3.5% today, per Beaconcha.in.\n\nAmitej Gajjala, the co-founder of liquid staking platform Stader Labs, told Decrypt that the drop could represent \u201ca short-term market slowdown due to continued bearish conditions and lowering Ethereum staking rewards.\u201d\n\nThe Ethereum validator queue hits zero on October 16. Soure: beaconcha.in\n\nA queue forms because there is a limit of 3,600 validators that are allowed to enter or exit the validation process per day.\n\nSeraphim Czecker, a contributor at Lido Finance, told Decrypt, that it\u2019s merely a \u201ctemporary equilibrium\u201d after a \u201ccatalyst-driven staking wave\u201d due to the Shapella upgrade \u201cwas absorbed.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShapella\u2013a combination of two proposals called Shanghai and Capella\u2013enabled withdrawals of staked ETH for the first time since staking on Ethereum was first activated in December 2020, increasing the demand for staking after the upgrade.\n\nKirill Kutakov, the co-founder of liquid staking protocol StakeWise, concurs with a similar analysis, stating that, \u201cwe are merely back to the natural demand for staking that was exhibited before Shanghai, which may sometimes result in low days.\u201d\n\nHe added, \"I would turn bearish only if the deposits began to decrease compared to the pre-Shanghai period.\"\n\nA Dune dashboard by data analyst Hildobby shows just that, however, with Ethereum deposits steadily decreasing since May.\n\nThis decline has brought Ethereum deposits close to the levels mentioned by Kutakov during the pre-Shanghai period.\n\nMonthly deposits to Ethereum staking contract. Source: Dune .\n\nCurrently, 27,779,142 ETH, representing 23.1% of Ethereum\u2019s circulating supply, is staked to the contract across 864,898 validators, per Nansen data.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Ethereum stakers?\n\nLido\u2019s Czecker is now betting that institutional money is going to lead the next wave of deposits in Ethereum staking contracts.\n\nHowever, they said that it may take some time because there is a \u201clack of understanding of what staking is to begin with.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe added that \u201ca more realistic target\u201d for DeFi would be \u201cfamily offices and asset managers with existing ETH balance sheets.\u201d\n\nCzecker also added that since the government bond yields are high right now, staking might not be as attractive.\n\nCurrently, short-term U.S. treasury notes are yielding 5.35%, per Ycharts data.\n\nEdited by Liam Kelly."

At the same time, the whale transactions exceeding $1 million in ETH had their second-highest day in five weeks on October 16, counting around 520 transfers.\n\nEthereum 1M+ wallets and transactions over $1M.

        "content": "Scroll, the latest Ethereum layer-2 network, has launched on mainnet.\n\nAccording to block explorer data, Scroll\u2019s testnet counts more than 900,000 wallet addresses as participants and has seen an estimated seven million transactions since August. Scroll\u2019s launch follows a year of testnet operation that has seen over 55 million transactions, the Scroll team told Blockworks.\n\nScroll is a general-purpose zkEVM roll-up intended to marry Ethereum\u2019s network security with lower fees and latency.\n\nScroll co-founder Sandy Peng told Blockworks in an interview that existing Ethereum projects will be able to directly deploy their projects onto Scroll and utilize its zkEVM technology.\n\n\u201cThe significance of zkEVM to developers lies in its ability to batch proofs in a highly efficient manner, offering faster transaction speeds at reduced costs. A key element in this process is bytecode-level compatibility,\u201d Peng said.\n\nBytecode in computer programming is a language that simplifies complicated machine cryptography so that code can be more easily processed by computer hardware.\n\nDeployed smart contracts will store the bytecode of their transactions on Scroll. These transactions will then be sent to a centralized zkEVM node that will prove that the state of the transaction is accurate without revealing the contents of the transaction.\n\nOnce the transaction is verified, the information will be published to Ethereum, updating the transaction\u2019s state without the transaction being re-executed.\n\n\u201cThanks to this feature, Ethereum devs can leverage all the same tools they are familiar with, ensuring that everything operates seamlessly right from the start,\u201d Peng said.\n\nScroll\u2019s mainnet code has been audited by four major auditing firms including: Zellic, Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin and KALOS, Peng notes.\n\nPath to decentralization\n\nThe Scroll team is currently in its \u201cresearch\u201d phase for its decentralized prover network and decentralized sequencer.\n\n\u201cIn the current instantiation, the protocol will halt if the sequencer goes offline, and no back-up is available,\u201d Peng said.\n\nPeng notes that the team is currently working on a protocol upgrade that will enable \u201cforced batches.\u201d\n\nThis means that the protocol will allow the permissionless publication of batches through the base layer even in the case of a sequencer halt.\n\n\u201cMid-term, the goal is to minimize the probability of a sequencer halt through decentralization,\u201d Peng said.\n\nAlthough in its current state, Scroll is upgradeable via a multi-signature wallet controlled by its core team, there are plans to introduce a Security Council and a delayed upgrade mechanism in the near future.\n\nThis means that the protocol will only be upgradeable if it receives approval from the Security Council, and the multisig team will only have the capability of initiating delayed upgrades, Peng explains.\n\n\u201cWe have been working on an SGX-based second prover with an external team of TEE experts for more than 6 months, which will soon enable us to have a functioning Multi-Prover deployed on Scroll,\u201d she said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

In its X thread, developers claim that a single hacker ran off with 526 ETH worth of users' funds, paying 263.91 in bribes to a validator allegedly managed by Lido Finance, eventually netting a profit of 264.08 ETH. Hope.money said:\n\n\u201cIt is crucial to emphasize that all protocols deployed on http://Hope.money are independent and will not impact the various other products and protocols currently live on the platform, including HopeCard, HopeSwap and $HOPE.

        "content": "NEW YORK & HONG KONG--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Scroll, an open-source, community-first Ethereum scaling solution, today announced the launch of its mainnet, marking a significant milestone in the movement to scale and drive adoption to the world\u2019s largest smart contract platform and first programmable blockchain.\n\nThe launch arrives at the culmination of two years of intensive development and rigorous testing, during which zero knowledge (zk) proofs were employed to compress computation off the primary blockchain. As Ethereum attracts more users and projects, this increased traffic can slow down the network and raise costs. ZK proofs enable an innovative approach that substantially enhances transaction throughput with accelerated transaction speeds and reduced costs, signifying a monumental shift in Ethereum\u2019s scaling capabilities.\n\nScroll\u2019s unique bytecode-level Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible zkEVM offers a virtually identical experience to Ethereum, empowering developers to essentially copy, paste, and deploy their existing Ethereum projects onto Scroll as-is, with no required changes to the codebase. The development is a testament to Scroll\u2019s commitment to scale Ethereum without compromising security or decentralization.\n\n\u201cAt Scroll, we take security extremely seriously,\u201d said Haichen Shen, co-founder of Scroll. \u201cScroll approaches security holistically, maintaining a dedicated internal security team, fully auditing our codebase with numerous audit firms, and remaining open-source, which we have been since day one.\u201d\n\nScroll\u2019s mainnet launch comes after over a year of successful testnets, seeing over 55 million transactions on Alpha and Beta testnets and nearly a million batches finalized to L1. Sepolia, the most recent testnet, in two months saw over 900K wallet addresses and over six million transactions. Over 100 projects have deployed on Scroll testnets to date, spanning from infrastructure to DeFi to gaming and beyond. Scroll\u2019s mainnet operates exactly like its Sepolia testnet, which will continue to operate as a staging environment for developers.\n\nOn the Scroll mainnet, users and developers have the same experience as they would on Ethereum, powered by zero knowledge cryptography. Scroll\u2019s mainnet will first focus on onboarding infrastructure providers, followed by rolling deployments that will empower developers across the globe to start building Web3 products and ultimately drive new users into the Ethereum community.\n\n\u201cWe see a future where the vast majority of value transfer takes place on L2s on Ethereum. What will drive that adoption is improved user and developer experience,\u201d said Sandy Peng, co-founder of Scroll. \u201cWe focus on enabling developers to build blockchain applications that will anchor web3 in real world use cases, attracting new users en masse, and moving everyone forward.\u201d\n\nScroll was established in 2021 with the mission to build an open-source, scalable ecosystem leveraging the native capabilities of a zkEVM, while maintaining Ethereum\u2019s well-known security capabilities and upholding the community\u2019s commitment to decentralization. To advance this commitment, the next milestones on Scroll\u2019s roadmap are a decentralized prover network and decentralized sequencer.\n\nFor the past two and a half years, Scroll has collaborated with the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s Privacy and Scaling Explorations (PSE) group to contribute approximately 50 percent of the upstream PSE zkEVM codebase. From its inception, Scroll has been building an open-source, peer-reviewed, and permissionless project, and the team continuously publishes research to advance understanding of the inner workings of ZK circuits, cryptography, and hardware acceleration.\n\nVisit scroll.io for more information.\n\nAbout Scroll\n\nScroll is a zero knowledge scaling solution for Ethereum with lower costs, faster speeds, and infinite scaling, without sacrificing security or decentralization. With bytecode-level compatibility, building on Scroll is nearly identical to building on Ethereum. Scroll has been community-focused and open-source since day one. With its zkEVM, Scroll unlocks the power of Web3 with the same security as the Ethereum blockchain. To learn more, visit: scroll.io."

        "content": "Some investors are rightfully pensive about employing a buy-and-hold approach when it comes to cryptocurrencies. Even when it comes to the largest members of the asset class, bitcoin and ethereum.\n\nCrypto is a notoriously volatile space. That can be unnerving for market participants who can\u2019t or simply don\u2019t want to actively monitor positions. Despite the turbulence so frequently associated with digital currencies, the best gains are accrued over long holding periods. And that could prove to be true with ethereum \u2013 the second-largest digital currency by market value behind bitcoin.\n\nEthereum, the platform for the cryptocurrency known as ether, could be in for massive long-term upside and that could highlight opportunity with the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE). ETHE, which debuted four and a half years ago, follows the CoinDesk Ether Price Index. And it is structured as an index fund.\n\nEther Excellent Opportunities\n\nAs of midday Tuesday, ether traded around $1,564 per token. It also sported a market value of $188 billion, or more than double that of Tether, the third-largest digital currency. Some crypto market observers believe ether could notch a more than fivefold increase over the next few years before embarking upon an even more exponential upside. This would would likely spell good news for ETHE.\n\nIn a recent report to clients, Standard Chartered cryptocurrency analyst Geoff Kendrick notes ether could ascend to $8,000 by the end of 2026.\n\n\u201cWe think Ethereum\u2019s established dominance in smart contract platforms, along with emerging uses in gaming and tokenization, has the potential to push ETH to the $8,000 level by end-2026,\u201d observed the analyst.\n\nOf note to investors considering ETHE, that forecast is s \u201ca stepping stone to our long-term \u2018structural\u2019 valuation estimate of $26,000-$35,000,\u201d added Kendrick.\n\nAlso important to market participants is that the digital currency\u2019s projected upside is rooted in fundamentals. This includes the expanding usage cases for what\u2019s known as \u201clayer 2\u201d solutions. Layer 2 solutions are rooted in the ethereum platform and are designed to bolster efficiencies. When those efficiencies are realized, more transactions will stay on the ethereum network, potentially boosting ether\u2019s price in the process.\n\n\u201cLayer 2 scaling solutions \u2026 are likely to grow in importance over time. Particularly as architecture upgrades expected in early 2024 sharply lower fees on these platforms. This should help to cement ETH\u2019s dominance in the smart contract space, thereby increasing its P/E ratio (if not its earnings) over the next couple of years,\u201d noted the Standard Chartered analyst."

        "content": "The validator queue on Ethereum has dropped to a record low.\n\nStaking APY has continued to decline in the past few months.\n\nThe Ethereum network [ETH] validator queue has emptied for the first time since the network\u2019s transition to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism in September 2022, according to data from Validator Queues.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nThis development means that there is no longer a waiting period for validators to begin staking their ETH.\n\nThe validator queue tracks the count of validators who have deposited their ETH but are waiting to be assigned to a shard or segment of the Ethereum network. Once assigned to a shard, validators can begin verifying transactions and earning rewards.\n\nThe depletion of the validator queue on the network represents a notable milestone because during the summer, for example, prospective validators had to wait for up to 45 days to join the network.\n\nWith an entry queue value of zero for the first time since Ethereum transitioned, the current demand for staking ETH has been satisfied, with 23% of ETH\u2019s supply being staked and a staking annual percentage yield (APY) of 3.3%.\n\nState of staking on the Ethereum network\n\nEarlier this month, Ethereum\u2019s Churn Limit increased from 12 to 13. In the context of Ethereum, the churn limit refers to the maximum number of validators that can join or leave the network during a single epoch, which is a period of about 6.4 minutes.\n\nThe increase in the activation and exit limits per epoch means that Ethereum can now process new and exiting validators daily.\n\nIn a recent post on X, crypto analyst Tom Wan noted that the increase in Churn Rate \u201cmeans the network can take in 93.6k new ETH deposits per day without requiring new validators to queue for more than > 1 day.\u201d\n\nUpdate on Ethereum Staking 1. The Churn Limit has Increased to 13 per Epoch\n\nThe number of validators on Ethereum reached 854k on 10 Oct. As a result, the activation limit and exit limit per epoch have increased from 12 to 13, which means ~2,925 validators can exit or withdraw\u2026 https://t.co/QuHsocmlBz pic.twitter.com/nxb2iBD3HA \u2014 Tom Wan (@tomwanhh) October 13, 2023\n\nWhile the cleared validation queue means new validators can now begin staking their coins immediately without waiting, it signals weakened demand for Ether staking.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nAccording to data from Glassnode, the daily amount of new ETH staked assessed on a 30-day moving average has declined by 22% in the last three months.\n\nMoreover, staking rewards have also dropped significantly in the past few months. Information retrieved from The Block Data showed that rewards earned by validators for locking up their Ether coins have dropped by 62% since May. At press time, staking APY was 3.3%."

        "title": "What are zk-rollups? Solving Ethereum's scalability issue - crypto.news",
        "content": "Zero-knowledge rollups (zk-rollups), a new scaling solution, can significantly boost a blockchain\u2019s throughput and lower transaction costs. This is achieved by moving computation and data storage off the main blockchain. Learn how zk-rollups work and which projects use them.\n\nZk-rollups are layer-2 protocols built on Ethereum that batch hundreds of transactions off-chain and generate cryptographic proofs that certify the validity of those transactions. Instead of posting transaction data on-chain, zk-rollups submit only these succinct proofs to verify the transactions are correct.\n\nThis allows the blockchain\u2019s capacity to increase exponentially while ensuring users can still benefit from the blockchain\u2019s security. Zk-rollups can process thousands of transactions per second at a fraction of the cost compared to transacting directly on-chain.\n\nYou might also like: Layer 2 projects experiencing a boom after The Merge\n\nHow ZK-rollups work\n\nZk-rollups have an on-chain component that holds funds and tracks account balances. Still, the actual execution of transactions occurs on a separate computational layer.\n\nNodes called operators collect transactions submitted by users, aggregate them into batches, and execute the transactions on an off-chain virtual machine. The operators then generate a cryptographic proof called a validity proof that mathematically guarantees the new state updates result from correctly executing all transactions in the batch.\n\nThese proofs are submitted to a smart contract on-chain along with the latest state of accounts on the zk-rollup. The contract verifies the proof is valid, ensuring the transactions were executed properly off-chain. If valid, the contract updates its state to match the zk-rollup\u2019s.\n\nThis allows transactions in zk-rollups to be finalized instantly once proofs are verified on-chain. Users can also withdraw funds from the rollup anytime without having to wait for security challenges.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum scalability battle heats up with multiple zkEVM projects\n\nThe key benefits of zk-rollups\n\nScalability: Zk-rollups provide orders of magnitude improvements in transaction throughput because validity proofs are much smaller than full transaction data. Thousands of transactions can be compressed into a proof just a few hundred bytes large. This is possible because zero-knowledge proofs do not have to contain the data to prove it.\n\nSecurity: Zk-rollups inherit the native blockchain\u2019s security guarantees and transaction finality. Validity proofs prevent operators from executing invalid state transitions off-chain. Furthermore, data availability on-chain allows anyone to reconstruct the zk-rollup\u2019s state.\n\nLow costs: Withdrawing funds from zk-rollups is seamless and cheap since transactions rely solely on proof verification, not fraud challenges. Users could also benefit from greatly reduced transaction fees thanks to compression efficiency.\n\nNo liveness assumptions: Zk-rollups are immune to denial-of-service attacks that delay transactions since proofs enforce correct state transitions. Users don\u2019t have to monitor the network to protect funds.\n\nDisadvantages of zk-rollups\n\nZk-rollups have higher computational costs than other solutions like Optimistic Rollups because calculating zero-knowledge proofs is computationally intensive. They have complex cryptographic and engineering framework. As a result, they prove to be costlier and more challenging to implement.\n\nZk-rollup projects\n\nWhich cryptos use ZK-rollups? Various teams are pushing forward the development and adoption of ZK-rollup technology across Ethereum layer-2 scaling solutions and decentralized applications. Scaling Ethereum is what most of those projects focus on, despite some arguing that such as system can bring even more to the table when it comes to Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nPolygon (MATIC) has emerged as one of the most popular zk-rollup solutions. It uses recursive SNARK proofs to bundle transactions with low costs. Polygon also offers EVM compatibility, allowing developers to migrate the Solidity smart contracts used on Ethereum and Ethereum-like blockchains with minimal changes. The network\u2019s growing ecosystem now includes over 7,000 dApps.\n\nYou might also like: Polygon to replace MATIC with POL token\n\nPowered by Cairo language and STARK-proof technology from Starkware, several efficient zk-rollup projects, such as dYdX, operate. Starkware, founded by Eli Ben-Sasson and Alessandro Chiesa, facilitates the development of rollups with developer-friendly APIs and services for exchanges and NFT platforms.\n\nZK-Sync, by Matter Labs, extends full EVM and Solidity support to zk-rollups. With SNARK proofs and emphasis on Ethereum interoperability, it forms a smooth link to layer-2. DeFi apps such as Aave, Yearn.Finance, and 1Inch Network are prominent adopters of ZK-Sync.\n\nLoopring (LRC) presents a decentralized exchange protocol designed for high-volume trading. Its architecture reduces slippage and fees. Loopring\u2019s zkRollup exchange played a pioneering role in Ethereum layer-2 adoption, and it currently supports GameStop\u2019s NFT marketplace.\n\nYou might also like: Loopring Quarterly Report Shows Promising Results in Trading Volume and NFTs Minted\n\nMetaMask, a leading wallet provider, is instrumental in facilitating ZK-rollup use by integrating platforms like Polygon and Loopring. It also enables effortless access to dApps across layers 1 and 2. MetaMask\u2019s endorsement could further promote the adoption of ZK-rollup-based transactions.\n\nWhat is ZkEVM and why build it\n\nSeveral teams are developing zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines (zkEVMs), a technology that brings compatibility of smart contracts and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to zk-rollups.\n\nIn simple terms, a zkEVM enables Ethereum transactions and smart contracts to function with cryptographic proof of validity. This innovation could combine the security and features of the EVM with the scalability offered by zk-rollups.\n\nNotable projects working on zkEVM include Applied ZKP, supported by the Ethereum Foundation, Polygon zkEVM, Scroll, Taiko, and ZKSync. Though each has a unique approach, they all aim to create a decentralized zkEVM capable of managing complicated Ethereum transactions using zero-knowledge proofs.\n\nShould a zkEVM layer-2 become fully operational, it would mark a significant step forward for Ethereum scalability. It would allow developers to use existing tools while benefiting from the high transaction speed and low costs associated with zk-rollups. The success of zkEVM initiatives could hasten the uptake of layer-2 solutions in applications based on Ethereum.\n\nZk-rollups vs optimistic rollups\n\nZk-rollups and Optimistic Rollups are two methods designed to enhance Ethereum\u2019s efficiency, but they use different tactics. Zk-rollups bundle many transactions off-chain and use zero-knowledge proofs to verify their validity before submitting them to the blockchain. This process heightens scalability and lowers costs, despite its high computational requirements. Instant transaction finality, a feature of zk-rollups, eliminates the need for fraud proofs.\n\nOptimistic Rollups, on the other hand, presume transactions are correct. They improve scalability by submitting minimal data to the chain and only produce fraud proofs if they spot invalid transactions. However, transaction finality is delayed until the fraud-proof challenge period ends. Despite having lower costs than zk-rollups, Optimistic Rollups do not require validity proofs for every transaction.\n\nWhile Optimistic Rollups may see quicker adoption in the short-term, zk-rollups offer better privacy and security safeguards. Both solutions aim to significantly increase Ethereum\u2019s transaction processing speed, reduce fees, and improve overall performance.\n\nZk-rollups and Optimistic Rollups are key technological advancements that will contribute to Ethereum\u2019s future growth. However, the choice between the two will depend on each application\u2019s specific needs.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade: the next major step in scalability\n\nThe path ahead\n\nZK-rollups require specialized knowledge to operate, so development is still early-stage. But the technology holds promise to help Ethereum reach tens of thousands of transactions per second.\n\nFuture research is focused on making zk-rollups more decentralized and creating Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility. This would allow zk-rollups to seamlessly support Ethereum smart contracts and decentralized applications.\n\nAs zero-knowledge technology and tooling matures, zk-rollups are poised to become a vital component of Ethereum\u2019s long-term scaling roadmap. Widespread adoption could lead to faster, cheaper decentralized finance and web3 services for millions of users worldwide."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has denied selling any Ethereum (ETH) for personal gain since 2018. In a Tuesday statement made on the decentralized social network Warpcast, Buterin addressed concerns about his recent cryptocurrency wallet activities, assuring his followers that the transactions were primarily related to charitable donations and covering expenses rather than personal profit.\n\n\u201cRegular reminder: If you see an article saying \u201cVitalik sends XXX ETH to [exchange]\u201d, it\u2019s not actually me selling, it\u2019s almost always me donating to some charity or nonprofit or other project, and the recipient selling because, well, they have to cover expenses. I haven\u2019t \u201csold\u201d ETH for personal gain since 2018,\u201d said Buterin. advertisement\n\nVitalik\u2019s Wallet Movements\n\nButerin\u2019s statement came as a response to growing speculation and concerns regarding his wallet\u2019s significant activity, which had drawn attention for various large-scale transactions involving ETH. Just recently, Blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain reported that Buterin\u2019s wallet had been involved in a series of transactions throughout September 2023, amounting to over $3.9 million.\n\nAdditional deposits were made to Kraken, Bitstamp, and Paxos during the same period, further raising eyebrows in the crypto community. Spot On Chain also identified a transfer of 2,000 ETH ($4.9 million) from another wallet associated with Buterin to the address conducting these transactions. It\u2019s worth noting that these transactions weren\u2019t isolated incidents. Earlier this month, an address linked to Buterin, transferred 1,000 ETH tokens equivalent to around $1.64 million to Bitstamp, potentially for sale.\n\nThat said, the crypto community has been increasingly concerned about these transactions, fearing they might trigger a market sell-off. Some are worried that Vitalik Buterin\u2019s active selling indicates a lack of confidence in the Ethereum network, potentially undermining its credibility or raising suspicions of a rug pull.\n\nCharity Links\n\nHowever, to support Buterins Tuesday claims, Kanro, a charity affiliated with Buterin, has been actively involved in transferring funds. Kanro, which focuses on researching global solutions to epidemics, received $100 funding from Crypto Relief earlier this year, led by Polygon founder Sandeep, and Vitalik himself.\n\nThis month, Kanro moved a total of 15.43 million USDC to a multi-signature wallet. This included 500,000 USDC transferred to Coinbase on October 14 and a significant 14.93 million USDC sent to Gemini on October 16."

Its zkEVM circuits were reviewed by Trail of Bits, Zellic and Kalos.\n\nAcross its three testnets, over 450,000 smart contracts were deployed, enabling over 90 million transactions across 9 million blocks. 280,000 ZK-proofs were also generated, the firm said.\n\nAbout a month ago, Scroll co-founder Ye Zhang told Cointelegraph Scroll would launch with centralized features but plans to increasingly decentralize over time.\n\n\u201cWe will have a centralized sequencer and the central approver button,\u201d Zhang said.

        "content": "A crypto wallet owned by the Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has seen a series of transactional activities lately, piquing the interest of crypto community members at a time when Ethereum selling pressures are rising.\n\nFollowing this, Buterin has taken the initiative to address the concerns regarding his recent transfer of digital assets to multiple exchanges.\n\nEthereum Co-Founder Discloses Truth Behind Multi-Transfers\n\nIn a recent post on Warp Cast, a decentralized social network, Russian-Canadian computer programmer and founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin publicized the real reason behind the latest ETH transfers made via his wallet address.\n\nButerin explained to the public that the large-scale ETH transactions that were performed using his wallet were not sold by him. He stated that over the years, he has mostly focused on donating large sums of Ethereum funds to charity organizations and other projects. He further solidified his claims saying that he had not sold ETH for personal profits since 2018.\n\n\u201cIf you see an article saying \u2018Vitalik sends XXX ETH to [exchange]\u2019, it\u2019s not actually me selling, it\u2019s almost always me donating to some charity or nonprofit or other projects, and the recipient selling because, well, they have to cover expenses,\u201d Buterin stated.\n\nButerin is well-known for his philanthropic acts toward charity organizations and medical interventions. The Ethereum co-founder made headlines in 2021, after donating $1 billion worth of SHIB tokens to a COVID-19 relief fund in India.\n\nAdditionally, in February 2023, Buterin donated $150,000 to Anka Relief to fund a crypto aid project that would support T\u00fcrkiye after its recent earthquake experiences.\n\nAlthough there have been many proofs of Buterin\u2019s propensity to donate to multiple charities, the crypto community has remained skeptical and vigilant, relentlessly monitoring the Ethereum founder\u2019s cryptocurrency activities, as well as these recent high-value ETH transactions.\n\nETH price settles above $1,570 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nSpokesperson Reveals $15 Million ETH Transfer From Kanro Charity\n\nAccording to data from PeckShield Alert, a blockchain security and auditing firm, Vitalik Buterin recently made a large-scale transaction of $15 million USDC to the Gemini Exchange.\n\nThis transaction in question is among the list of recent transfers associated with the Ethereum founder. These movements have prompted both curiosity and concern in the crypto community, as observers attempt to determine the underlying motive behind Buterin\u2019s transactions.\n\nA report from Cointelegraph said an Ethereum Foundation Spokesperson has clarified the details behind the lofty transaction. According to the Spokesperson, the $15 million USDC transfer was only executed under Buterin\u2019s Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and not from his wallet address.\n\nThe spokesperson also supposedly confirmed that the funds were from a transfer made by a charity multi-sig wallet, Kanro, which is closely linked to Buterin to sponsor a grant.\n\nFeatured image from U.Today, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Is it Too Late to Buy Ethereum? ETH Price Keeps Falling But Eco Friendly Ecoterra Just Hit $4.5 Million \u2013 100x Potential in 2023?\n\nSource / Sam Cooling x ETH\n\nAfter more than a month of consolidatory ranging, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price remains steadfast in a tightly fought range.\n\nCurrently trading at $1,858 (a 24-hour change of -0.79%), Ether appears to have once again been rejected by a tough ceiling of resistance at $1,925.\n\nNow in a minor -3.60% retracement move, markets are on edge as ETH heads for a retest of support at the tricky MA20.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Technical Analysis: Consolidation Continues\u2026\n\nTradingView / ETH USDT\n\nIndeed, the MA20 has formed a critical moving average since April \u2013 suppressing upside price moves for over 35 days.\n\nA breakthrough moment last week could be the last chance at a return to a technical rally structure for Ether on the short-time frame (STF), and a strong bounce from support here could supercharge price action.\n\nBut despite a continuation of the mid-range pattern, Ethereum\u2019s oscillators cloud judgment.\n\nWith an RSI sat at 51, a marginal display of bearish divergence, many are wondering whether the current price level is sustainable.\n\nIndeed, the recent retracement move has failed to flip to an oversold signal on the RSI, and this could demand ETH price pushes lower.\n\nIn contrast, the MACD provides a lot of hope, with an incredibly bullish 8.78 reflecting the newfound support above the MA20.\n\nEthereum On-Chain Analysis: Will Accumulation Window Impact ETH Price?\n\nShifting attention to Ethereum on-chain, there has been a seismic reversal of market behavior worthy of attention.\n\nLooking at Net Transfer Volume from/to Exchanges, there has been a clear change in sentiment towards accumulation behaviour since May 23.\n\nGlassnode / Net Transfer Volume (Ethereum)\n\nNow in the 9th day of net outflow (depicting Ether moving from exchange accounts into cold storage wallets or staking), more than 600,000 ETH has moved off exchanges in recent days (with a value of $1.125bn).\n\nThis accumulation has been characterized by a huge outflow on May 26, which saw a whopping 451,806 ETH (worth $825m) withdrawn in just one day.\n\nOverall, this suggests ETH price is likely to push up as accumulation pressures supply dynamics.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Prediction: Rain or Shine?\n\nWith technical structure fighting to resume, and on-chain signaling suggesting a shift in market sentiment from distribution to accumulation, the ostensible downside slide of Ethereum might not be all it seems.\n\nIf Ethereum bulls can successfully defend the MA20 mark, forming a new support level \u2013 then ETH price is likely to push up to $2,000 (+7.4%).\n\nHowever, the downside risk isn\u2019t insignificant. If the MA20 gives way \u2013 then the ETH price could plummet back down to local support at $1,785 (-4.15%).\n\nTradingView / ETH USDT\n\nThis leaves Ethereum with a Risk: Reward ratio of 1.78 \u2013 a fair entry.\n\nBut despite the attractive risk: reward ratio, returns here are limited by price structure \u2013 if an investor committed $1,000 to an Ethereum long position, they could only expect to make a poxy $74 in the best case.\n\nWhile nothing to be laughed at, these aren\u2019t the lucrative returns that draw people to crypto, and indeed many retail traders are looking to assume more aggressive risk profiles in order to fuel seismic gains.\n\nOne such opportunity, leading the pack with the huge promise of using blockchain to unlock the climate change conundrum, is Ecoterra.\n\nEcoterra: The Best ETH Price Downturn Alternative?\n\nSource / Ecoterra\n\nEthereum\u2019s market is facing turbulence, but an exciting newcomer, Ecoterra ($ECOTERRA), is changing the game.\n\nProviding investors with the opportunity to bank on eco-friendly blockchain platforms, this green crypto coin has already raised a staggering $4.5 million.\n\nEcoterra ingeniously combines blockchain technology\u2019s transformative power with an all-out war on climate change and wasteful resource practices.\n\nEcoterra Innovates with Planet Changing Recycle2Earn Technology\n\nSource / Ecoterra Tokenomics\n\nWith its presale currently at the 7th stage, ecoterra has already raised $4.5 million, bringing it astonishingly close to its $4.775 million target.\n\nThe unique appeal of ecoterra lies in its innovative Recycle-to-Earn (R2E) system, which promises to redefine sustainable recycling.\n\nBy leveraging the decentralized nature of blockchain, ecoterra rewards users for responsible recycling practices, attracting global brands like Coca-Cola, Carlsberg, and Evian.\n\nBut why should you care about Ecoterra?\n\nHere are three compelling reasons:\n\n1. Ecoterra Presale: An Exclusive Chance to Invest and Make a Difference\n\nThe ecoterra presale presents a golden opportunity to buy into a project that\u2019s making waves in the crypto world, following a recent award at the Blockchain Economy Summit in Istanbul.\n\nWith the native $ECOTERRA token available at $0.0085 before its jump to $0.00925 upon hitting the presale target, investors are treated to a prime chance to back a sustainable future while enjoying considerable returns.\n\nAs the token\u2019s price ascends, early presale investors stand to gain from significant ROI, alongside future staking protocols for passive income generation.\n\n2. Pioneering the Green Revolution with Blockchain Technology\n\nEcoterra stands out with its unique blend of environmental conservation and blockchain.\n\nBy creating a transparent record of each user\u2019s environmental impact and incentivizing eco-conscious practices with its cryptocurrency, Ecoterra offers an impressive package of environmental responsibility and economic growth.\n\n3. Becoming a Part of Ecoterra\u2019s Eco-friendly Revolution\n\nThere\u2019s never been a better time to be part of the green revolution in crypto, and ecoterra offers an exclusive chance to get on board, and take the fight back to climate change using the latest and greatest in blockchain technology.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss Out on Final Moments of Ecoterra Presale"

Throughout September, the total amount transferred from Buterin\u2019s wallets exceeded $3.9 million.\n\nOne particular transaction on Sept. 24 drew significant attention, as Buterin sent 400 ETH, equivalent to $600,000 at the time, to Coinbase.

The\u00ad performance and potential of Scroll\u2019s te\u00adstnets have bee\u00adn demonstrated through the de\u00adployment of over 450K smart contracts, processing more\u00ad than 90 million transactions, and generating 280K ZK proofs.\n\nSandy Peng, co-founde\u00adr of Scroll, emphasizes their goal to e\u00adnhance user and deve\u00adloper experie\u00adnces while driving the adoption of layer 2 solutions on Ethe\u00adreum.\n\n\u201cThe significance of zkEVM to developers lies in its ability to batch proofs in a highly efficient manner, offering faster transaction speeds at reduced costs. A key element in this process is bytecode-level compatibility,\u201d said Peng.\n\nSGX-Based Prover for Scroll Upgrade\n\nThe Scroll team is developing an SGX-based se\u00adcond prover to enable a functioning Multi-Prove\u00adr on Scroll.\n\n\u201cWe have been working on an SGX-based second prover with an external team of TEE experts for more than 6 months, which will soon enable us to have a functioning Multi-Prover deployed on Scroll,\u201d said Peng.\n\nThe team is currently in the rese\u00adarch phase for their dece\u00adntralized prover network and se\u00adquencer. They are\u00ad working on an upgrade to the protocol, aiming to enable\u00ad forced batches that ensure\u00ad uninterrupted operation e\u00adven if the seque\u00adncer goes offline.\n\nA Community-Driven Network\n\nScroll is built on the values of community empowerment, inclusivity, and openne\u00adss. Through a range of global develope\u00adr engagement activitie\u00ads, workshops, and ZK research education initiative\u00ads, the network has fostere\u00add connections with individuals worldwide.\n\nOperating across 26 diffe\u00adrent countries, Scroll\u2019s distributed te\u00adam encourages collaboration and interaction within local communities. Re\u00adnowned as one of Ethere\u00adum\u2019s most significant zkEVM networks, Scroll offers a solution that closely re\u00adsembles Ethere\u00adum with enhanced features and benefits.\n\nRead Also: Shibarium: Shiba Inu\u2019s Layer 2 Blockchain On Ethereum\n\nThe\u00ad launch of its mainnet signifies a groundbreaking mile\u00adstone for both Scroll and Ethereum, bringing in a new era of scalability and exciting progress."

        "content": "Just weeks ago, The Protocol reported how Ethereum developers were worried that the number of validators on the blockchain was growing so fast that the resulting sprawl might cause latency issues. That problem may have temporarily resolved itself, thanks to what Coinbase analysts attributed to \u201ca plateau in investor demand for Ethereum staking.\u201d As reported by CoinDesk\u2019s Krisztian Sandor, the once month-long queue of validators waiting to get onto the network has now basically been cleared out. One factor is that staking rewards have dropped significantly, to near 3.5% from 5%-6% earlier this year, due to tepid network activity to generate revenue from fees and the increasing number of stakers. That looks like a pretty paltry return for crypto, especially with traditional money market funds and old-fashioned, one-year U.S. Treasury bills yielding north of 5%."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum gas fees slump to new lows, offering the network a chance to prove its ultrasound money narrative.\n\nGas fees crashed to 7.941 Gwei for the first time since 2020, with analysts pointing to several reasons.\n\nAmid the slump in gas prices, ETH embarked on a small rally to trade above the $1,500 mark.\n\nAfter years of sky-high gas fees, the Ethereum (ETH) network has completed a turnaround after recording its lowest transaction fees for the first time in over three years.\n\nOn Oct. 14, Ethereum\u2019s average gas price stood at 7.941 Gwei, a figure that got the entire community beaming with pride. The last time Ethereum\u2019s gas fees recorded a similar figure was in April 2020, surging by over 100% alongside the rush of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nExactly a year ago, the figure stood at 19.68 Gwei, leaving pundits with dwindling hopes for a reduction in transaction fees. Right off the bat, several contributory factors exist for the plummeting gas fees, including the decline of NFTs and the significant reduction in DeFi activities.\n\nAt the height of their powers, digital collectibles and DeFi yield farming made up a large chunk of transactions that clogged the Ethereum network, sending gas prices to astronomic levels. Speculative trading activity is another reason for the decline in gas fees, given the extended bear market and sideways trading of the asset class.\n\nAnother theory for the dwindling values of gas fees is the adoption of new layer 2 networks designed to improve Ethereum\u2019s scalability. Pundits have described the rise of Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum as relieving a chunk of the pressure from the layer 2 network while mulling the possibilities of even lower gas fees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to on-chain analysts, the new trend may make ETH inflationary, bringing its claim of being ultrasound money under greater scrutiny.\n\n\u201cThe low fee regime represents a major transition for Ethereum, trading off high revenues and deflationary supply for the promise to be able to attract mainstream users through layer 2s,\u201d said Lucas Outumuro, IntoTheBlock\u2019s head of research.\n\nEyes on the $1,700 mark\n\nDespite a choppy start to life that saw ETH fall to $1,500 in October, bulls remain optimistic that the asset can ride the wave of low gas fees to recapture the $1,700 mark. Bulls are hinging their belief on a neutral stance to the bearish sentiment in the markets as they hope for stronger buying pressures at present levels.\n\nIn the last 2 hours, ETH has gained nearly 2% while trading volumes recorded a 5% jump over the last day. In other markets, Bitcoin (BTC) currently trades at $28K, with several altcoins riding the wave of the largest cryptocurrency to record small wins."

The wallet would later transfer $500,000 to Coinbase in two transactions and $14.93 million to Gemini.\n\nMeanwhile, Buterin remains an ETH whale, per Arkham\u2019s intelligence data. He holds nearly 250,000 Ether units worth $390 million in his address."

He clarified that these transfers were primarily charitable donations made to organizations and projects, necessitating liquidation to cover operational expenses.\n\nI haven't \"sold\" ETH for personal gain since 2018 - Vitalik Buterin\n\nThe Ethereum founder's message comes in response to growing confusion within the cryptocurrency community regarding the nature of these transfers. Many perceived them as sell-offs, which led to bearish sentiments on the market.\n\nA notable example emerged recently when Kanro, a charity closely affiliated with Vitalik Buterin, made substantial transfers of approximately 15.43 million USDC. Out of this total, 500,000 USDC found its way to Coinbase on Oct. 14, while a substantial 14.93 million USDC was sent to Gemini on Oct. 16.\n\nButerin had previously introduced Kanro on June 9, 2023, highlighting that it primarily receives funding from Crypto Relief, led by the Polygon founder and Buterin himself. Kanro's mission revolves around researching global solutions for the pandemic and potential future epidemics.\n\nDespite Buterin's attempts to clarify the situation, the enigmatic nature of his recent activities continues to raise eyebrows. While some questions have been answered, a lingering air of mystery surrounds his transactions, leaving many intrigued. As the crypto world speculates about motives, it seems there might be more to this story than meets the eye."

        "content": "A passionate cryptocurrency and blockchain author qualified to cover every event in the crypto space. Researching minute occurrences and bringing new insights lie within the prime focus of my task.\n\nThe global crypto market cap witnessed a notable rise in the past few days, as the levels are now raised beyond $1.09 trillion. Despite a drop in trading volume in the past 24 hours, Bitcoin\u2019s price is able to sustain above $28,000. Besides, the Ethereum price trades above $1500, while the other tokens in the top 10 are trying hard to materialize decent gains.\n\nIn times when market sentiments are closer to making a notable shift from being pessimistic to optimistic, the possibility of a bearish turn-down could hinder the progress of the rally for a while. A popular analyst, anonymously known as Colin Talks Crypto, believes that the BTC price could drop below $24,000 while the ETH/BTC pair could make new lows in the next several months.\n\nReferring to the above chart, Colin Talks Crypto believes the BTC price could complete its head and shoulder pattern. With this, the price could drop to levels between $18,000 and $23,000, which is likely to happen by the end of 2023 or the very beginning of 2024. Moreover, the analyst also believes the Bitcoin spot ETF could get approved sometime after the crash, causing a huge \u2018God Candle\u2019 recording a minimum $10,000 jump.\n\nWhile the BTC price is undergoing some compression, the analyst believes the ETH/BTC could get decimated and drop to new lows somewhere between 0.035 and 0.045. As no Ethereum ETF is getting approved, all the liquidity will FOMO into Bitcoin first, pushing the ETHBTC pair down. However, approval may be expected after the ETH/BTC ratio hits new lows. In the meantime, the other altcoins are also expected to make new lows against Bitcoin. Therefore, the Bitcoin price prediction for 2023 and for the beginning of 2024 appears to be bearish at present."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nShiba Inu's Layer-2 scaling solution Shibarium has been in the spotlight since its inception, and it appears to be moving at a relatively slower speed despite hitting new milestones on a regular basis. One major factor that needs to change in order for Shibarium to change its fortunes in the mid- to long term is its block time which, according to Shibariumscam, is pegged at 5.0 seconds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a blockchain protocol, this block time is impressive, but many caveats present themselves with respect to this particular metric. First is the overall transaction load on the protocol in relation to the other competing chains.\n\nOn-chain data revealed that the average daily transaction on Shibarium is pegged at 11.47K, down from an October peak of 33.05K. For better context, while Shibarium has processed a total of 3,497,383 transactions since it was launched on the mainnet in August, other Ethereum-based protocols like Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP) process an average monthly transaction of 17.68 million and 8.03 million, respectively.\n\nThis figure begs the thesis that should the transaction load on Shibarium grow beyond its current level, the block time might increase in a way that will make transactions clog once again.\n\nGetting ahead of curve\n\nFor a very long time, Shibarium's block time has remained stagnant at 5.0 seconds, without any observable fluctuations. In order to get ahead of the curve, the core team behind Shibarium needs to place more emphasis on improving block time from better to best.\n\nAs a relatively newer player in the L2 arena, Shibarium needs all the competitive edge it can get in order to beat its peers to gain more market share. Though Shibarium continues to hit new records, it needs to work on its block time if it will be able to dominate the L2 ecosystem on Ethereum in the near future."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nOrbs (ORBS), an Ethereum challenger, is on a parabolic run, with its price up by more than 60% in what can be classified as one of its biggest trading days in months. The coin is changing hands at a price of $0.05746 but with a 289% jump in its trading volume with over $648 million traded overnight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe hype around ORBS is centered on the prospects behind the coin's listing on the OKX trading platform. Huobi made the announcement on its X handle, noting that the perpetual swap feature for the ORBS/USDT pair is now live.\n\nThe exchange announced that users can now gain access to 20X leverage, with additional ORBS-focused products, including margin trading and savings, also billed for a later launch. ORBS is one of the hardest-hit tokens in the past crypto winter. The coin is still down by over 84% from its all-time high (ATH) attained about three years ago.\n\nThe current upshot is a testament to the optimism within its ecosystem and the desire to help chart a revival in usage and, in the long run, in the trading price of the ORB.\n\nMid-cap tokens pulling their weight\n\nWhile the most important hype in the market revolves around Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP and Cardano (ADA), to mention a few, many low-cap and mid-cap altcoins are also charting revolutionary trends within their own ecosystem.\n\nWhile Orbs is aiming at driving scalability and usability to rival Ethereum, projects like Bad Idea AI (BAD) are redefining AI-based capabilities within the Shibarium Layer-2 protocol. Other altcoins like Fantom (FTM), Chainlink (LINK) and Optimism (OP) are also arguably helping to drive the overall goal of broadening the acceptability of the broader digital currency and blockchain ecosystems.\n\nWith related support through listings such as OKX, accomplishing this mission becomes easier for these asset classes."

However, the Ethereum whales are making the most of the opportunity. As per on-chain data provider Santiment, Ethereum billionaire wallets have their holdings touch a 7-year high.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhale addresses on the Ethereum network, characterized by holdings of at least 1 million ETH, currently possess 32.3% of the total supply. This marks the first time such a significant concentration has occurred since 2016. Furthermore, transactions exceeding $1 million in value experienced their second-highest daily volume in the past five weeks. These developments are indicative of a historic moment in Ethereum\u2019s trajectory, reported Santiment.\n\nRecently, there\u2019s been a major buzz over Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin sending large amounts of coins to the exchanges. This development has also kept the ETH price under selling pressure for a while However, Buterin recently clarified that all those coins that he has been selling recently have been only for charity and donations and not for his personal gains.\n\nETH Price Action\n\nEthereum\u2019s price, currently at $1,568, recently rebounded from the support level of $1,533, resulting in a slight increase. However, the cryptocurrency encountered resistance at the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), hindering its progress toward reclaiming the $1,686 resistance as a support level.\n\nNonetheless, there\u2019s still potential for Ethereum\u2019s price to recover, as indicated by the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The RSI hovers around the neutral mark at 50.0, within the bearish zone, but a further uptick could flip it into a support level, confirming a bullish signal.\n\nOn the contrary, if the bullish signal doesn\u2019t materialize and the $1,533 support is breached, the Ethereum price may drop below the $1,500 mark, invalidating the bullish outlook"

        "title": "New Bitcoin: Ethereum hybrid set to explode this winter - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "The world of cryptocurrency is once again on the brink of a revolution. This winter, a new hybrid crypto, a lovechild of Bitcoin and Ethereum, promises to change the way we perceive finance. This article will dive deep into the birth of this new financial model, the rethinking of DeFi by this new altcoin, and how this impacts the world of crypto mining.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum gave birth to a new way of finance\n\nThe new hybrid altcoin, known as Bitcoin Spark (BTCS), is the product of combining the best of Bitcoin and Ethereum. This isn\u2019t just a metaphorical blend; it\u2019s a literal fusion of the two most popular cryptos, bringing together the stability and reliability of Bitcoin with the flexibility and potential of Ethereum.\n\nThe idea behind BTCS is simple: to create an altcoin that can act as a stable store of value, like Bitcoin, while also offering smart contract functionality, like Ethereum. This dual nature allows BTCS to serve both as an investment and a tool for building decentralized applications (dApps), making it a versatile addition to any crypto portfolio.\n\nThe birth of BTCS marks a new era in crypto finance. This is an era where the boundaries between different cryptos are blurred, bringing together the best of each world to create something entirely new and full of potential. It\u2019s a testament to the evolving nature of crypto, a world that\u2019s always pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible.\n\nNew Hybrid altcoin rethinks DeFi: Bitcoin Spark\n\nThe world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has been one of the most significant developments in the crypto sphere over the past few years. However, the rise of DeFi has also exposed the limitations of existing cryptos. Bitcoin, for all its value, lacks the functionality to fully embrace DeFi. Ethereum, on the other hand, while offering smart contract capabilities, struggles with scalability and high transaction fees.\n\nThat\u2019s where BTCS comes in. By combining the strengths of Bitcoin and Ethereum, BTCS rethinks DeFi. It brings together the best of both worlds to create a new hybrid model of DeFi. This model leverages the stability and reliability of Bitcoin and the versatility and potential of Ethereum to create a more powerful, efficient, and scalable DeFi platform.\n\nThe introduction of BTCS is not just an exciting development for investors but also for developers. With BTCS, developers can build dApps that take advantage of the security of Bitcoin and the flexibility of Ethereum. This opens up a world of possibilities for DeFi, from more efficient lending platforms to more versatile decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\nA new way of smartphone mining with BTCS\n\nBut BTCS is not just about redefining DeFi. It\u2019s also about making crypto mining more accessible. Traditionally, crypto mining has been a resource-intensive process, requiring specialized hardware and a significant amount of electricity. This has made it difficult for the average person to participate in mining and benefit from it.\n\nBTCS aims to change this. By leveraging the power of smartphones, BTCS allows anyone with a smartphone to participate in crypto mining. This not only democratizes mining but also makes it more environmentally friendly. Instead of relying on large mining farms that consume a lot of electricity, BTCS mining can be done on a device that most people own and use daily.\n\nSmartphone mining has the potential to bring millions of people into the world of crypto, expanding its reach and influence. It\u2019s a step towards a more inclusive and sustainable crypto ecosystem, one where anyone can participate and benefit.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThe launch of BTCS is undoubtedly one of the most exciting developments in the crypto world this winter. It brings together the best of Bitcoin and Ethereum, creating a new hybrid altcoin that redefines DeFi and democratizes crypto mining. As we move into this new era of crypto finance, the potential of BTCS is unlimited.\n\nFor more information:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid post and should not be treated as news/advice."

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens were trading sharply higher on Tuesday in Asia but the gains soon eased early morning. A false report of a spot ETF approval was posted on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. However, the gains were trimmed as the clarity emerged and the report was deleted.\n\n\n\nBitcoin posted sharp gains in the early morning as the last crypto token surged about 4 per cent to once again top 28,000-levels. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, also gained about 2 per cent but remained below $1600-level. Altcoins were also trading with decent gains in the early morning.\n\n\n\nYesterday was a very interesting day to trade. Bitcoin saw a 70-day high in price. This happened alongside a massive $65 million worth of liquidation in close to 15 minutes as a major crypto news publisher CoinTelegraph reported that the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF has been approved by the SEC, said Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager at CoinSwitch Markets Desk.\n\n\n\n\"However, shortly after, Blackrock clarified that their application is still under review,\" he said. \"The series of events makes one thing clear\u2014a real spot Bitcoin ETF approval is highly likely to lead to an unprecedented rally. Currently, Bitcoin still looks bullish in charts,\" he added.\n\n\n\nBarring a few exceptions, the majority of top crypto tokens were trading with big gains on Tuesday. Solana surged about 9 per cent, while Polygon was trading 3 per cent higher. Tron, Litecoin and BNB added 2 per cent each. Among the losers, only Polkadot and USD Coin were seen in red.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly higher, jumping to $1.09 trillion-mark, as it surged as much as three per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes zoomed more than 220 per cent to $62.5billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\nSolana, an open-source project that leverages the unrestricted nature of blockchain technology, offers decentralised finance (DeFi) solutions. Although the project's conception and early development date back to 2017, Solana was formally introduced in March 2020 under the stewardship of the Solana Foundation, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SOL/USDT chart made a single day jump of nearly 7 per cent, reclaiming its position above the $24 level. On the daily time-frame, the SOL/USDT chart has just broken above the triangle pattern with its daily buying volumes almost doubling. The next resistance is expected at 27.5 USDT and an immediate support is expected at 20.2 USDT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "Ethereum is getting more concentrated into the hands of whales, according to the latest data from on-chain analytics provider Santiment.\n\nOn October 18, Santiment reported that billionaire Ethereum investors with more than 1 million ETH hold 32.2% of the available supply for the first time since 2016.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum transactions exceeding $1 million hit their second-highest day in a month.\n\n\ud83d\udc0b #Ethereum\u2018s whale addresses in the #billionaire tier (holding at least 1M $ETH) now hold 32.3% of the available supply for the first time since 2016.

However, Santiment didn\u2019t specify whether these figures included entities such as centralized exchanges or stablecoin issuers that hold a lot of ETH.\n\nWhat has been analyzed, however, is the selling patterns, and whales have been offloading ETH over the past few months.\n\nAccording to data from Glassnode, there is a \u201cstriking difference\u201d in the behavior of major Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings, indicating divergent views among crypto whales.\n\nSince 2020, Ethereum whales, or those that hold over 1,000 ETH in this case, have been progressively lowering their holdings. This has resulted in the sale of about $20 million in ETH.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin whales holding more than 1,000 BTC have primarily maintained their holdings, according to the data shared by CoinMarketCap.\n\nNevertheless, the Ethereum staking narrative has never been stronger, with more of the asset being staked than ever before despite withdrawals opening in April.\n\nThere are currently a record 27.6 million ETH staked valued at around $43.4 billion, according to Beaconcha.in. This represents around 23% of the total supply.\n\nFurthermore, that supply has declined by 260,640 ETH or $409 million since the Merge in September last year, according to Ultrasound.Money.\n\nETH Price Bearish\n\nNone of the bullish staking or deflationary supply fundamentals have been able to beat the Ethereum bears off yet.\n\nETH is down another 1.3% on the day, trading at $1,568 at the time of writing. The asset has lost 4.5% over the past fortnight and continues to decline with the rest of the altcoins.\n\nEthereum is now 68% down from its all-time high, whereas Bitcoin, which has performed better this week, is down 59% from its peak."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRipple Labs Inc. CTO David Schwartz has posed a thought-provoking question to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the security status of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nRhetorical inquiry about Ethereum\n\nTaking to his official X handle, Schwartz responded to a post from the SEC in which the commission instructed the community to always revert to its own channels for news that pertains to its regulatory affairs.\n\nThe SEC's counsel comes after a piece of fake news broke about the commission approving the iShares Bitcoin spot ETF application from BlackRock. In the SEC's words, investors need to be careful what they read on the internet, noting that \"the best source of information about the SEC is the SEC.\"\n\nDrawing on this, the Ripple CTO asked the SEC if it thinks people selling Ethereum on secondary marketplaces are selling securities. This question is highly impractical to answer over social media as it constitutes the core of what the ongoing Ripple v. SEC legal battle as well as other trading platforms is all about.\n\nAwesome. Does the SEC think people selling ETH on exchanges are selling securities? I'd like to hear from the best source. https://t.co/Mvgaa9DgUH \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) October 17, 2023\n\nTo date, only XRP has been certified as an altcoin whose trading on secondary marketplaces does not constitute a security. This clarity was obtained after more than two years of litigation, with the favorable ruling decided by Judge Analisa Torres in July.\n\nBased on the complexity of the question, any answer given by the market regulator will spark another round of curiosity that it obviously cannot afford at this time.\n\nContinuous pressure for SEC\n\nDespite being empowered by the law to regulate the market, the SEC is obviously not finding its role easy, especially as concerns crypto regulatory affairs. Besides being disfavored by a court ruling in the Grayscale-Bitcoin conversion case, the presence of industry giants like BlackRock and Fidelity in the race for a Bitcoin spot ETF has put the SEC on the edge overall."

        "content": "After strong increases in the last few days, the Ethereum price suffered losses again and continues to lag well behind the price movement of Bitcoin. This is causing sentiment among Ethereum investors to plummet. But there is still massive growth potential. Can Bitcoin Halving Trigger an Altcoin Bull Run? Will we see an Ethereum price of $10,000 in 12 months? Let\u2019s take a look at Ethereum price prediction in more detail.\n\nHow has the Ethereum price moved in the last few weeks?\n\nETH/USD Weekly Chart- TradingView\n\nOverall, the Ethereum price has suffered losses in the last few weeks. The price saw a drop from $1,850 to below $1,600 over the last 4 to 5 weeks. This means that the Ether token has lost between 10 and 15 percent of its value during this time.\n\nTwo weeks ago there was a brief rise in the Ethereum price to over $1,700. But this spike was only visible for a short time and in the last 2 weeks the ETH price has fallen back below the $1,600 mark. In the last few days we have seen a slight upward trend again.\n\nEthereum price prediction: Is a massive increase possible in the next 12 months?\n\nAt the moment, the altcoin market is in a massive crisis. The smaller projects such as Solana, Cardano, Polygon or the Memecoins have already seen massive losses in the summer. Ethereum was initially able to hold up better, but has lost heavily against Bitcoin, especially in the last 2 to 3 months. Can this trend be reversed?\n\nThe Ethereum price could see a recovery again in the coming months. We must not forget that the altcoins have always suffered extremely in bear markets and the Bitcoin price has been able to hold up better.\n\nThe Bitcoin Halving could not only bring about a turning point for BTC, but also bring new hype around altcoins. So far this has always been the case in previous cycles. That\u2019s why we are very positive that the Ethereum price should rise massively again, especially after the Bitcoin Halving.\n\nEthereum price prediction: Will the Ethereum price rise to $10,000 in a year?\n\nThe Ethereum price could rise significantly again in the coming months. But is an increase to $10,000 realistic? Actually, this mark was supposed to fall in the last bull market. At the moment we are again massively underestimating the growth potential of Ethereum, precisely because it is the basis of most of the important altcoins.\n\nA rise to $10,000 in 12 months is an extremely optimistic forecast. But we shouldn\u2019t be surprised if the Ethereum price sees a massive increase again in the coming months.\n\nWhere to Buy Ethereum?\n\nPurchasing cryptocurrencies can seem daunting for newcomers, but platforms like Bitpanda have made the process straightforward and user-friendly. Bitpanda is a reputable exchange known for its ease of use and security features. To buy cryptos on Bitpanda, simply follow these steps:\n\nCreate an account on the Bitpanda platform. Verify your identity for security purposes. Deposit funds using your preferred payment method. Search for the desired cryptocurrency. Select the amount you wish to purchase and confirm the transaction.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

        "content": "In a surprising turn of events, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has made significant moves on the crypto market, depositing millions of USDC into major exchanges, sparking speculation about his strategic intentions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLookonchain reports that Buterin's address, vitalik.eth, received a staggering 14.93 million USDC from Kanro merely four days ago, promptly depositing it into Gemini just before the first surge of Bitcoin.\n\nButerin's actions intensified when he deposited an additional 500,000 USDC into Coinbase merely two days ago, adding to the intrigue surrounding his motives. This comes after months of speculation, as Buterin previously deposited his ETH holdings on various exchanges, a move interpreted as a bearish signal by the crypto community.\n\nThe recent actions, however, paint a different picture. It appears that the Ethereum founder has shifted gears, opting to stockpile stablecoins instead of tokens, leading to speculations about his newfound bullish sentiment.\n\nThis twist in Buterin's investment strategy seems particularly astute, as it coincided with a momentous surge in the crypto market. Bitcoin, for instance, shot up by over 13%, while Ethereum witnessed a 5% increase.\n\nNonetheless, the veil of secrecy surrounding Buterin's intentions remains intact, as tracking further fund movements on his exchange accounts remains impossible. Until the enigmatic Ethereum founder unveils his next move, the crypto community is left to ponder: what is his endgame?"

        "content": "Reviewed and fact-checked by Sayantoni Das\n\nOver the past few years, you have consistently heard the term \u2018blockchain technology,\u2019 probably regarding cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin. In fact, you may be asking yourself, \u201cwhat is blockchain technology?\u201d It seems like blockchain is a platitude but in a hypothetical sense, as there is no real meaning that the layman can understand easily. It is imperative to answer \u201cwhat is blockchain technology, \u201cincluding the technology that is used, how it works, and how it\u2019s becoming vital in the digital world.\n\nAs blockchain continues to grow and become more user-friendly, the onus is on you to learn this evolving technology to prepare for the future. If you are new to blockchain, then this is the right platform to gain solid foundational knowledge. In this article, you learn how to answer the question, \u201cwhat is blockchain technology?\u201d You\u2019ll also learn how blockchain works, why it\u2019s important, and how you can use this field to advance your career.\n\nWhat Is Blockchain Technology?\n\nBlockchain is a method of recording information that makes it impossible or difficult for the system to be changed, hacked, or manipulated. A blockchain is a distributed ledger that duplicates and distributes transactions across the network of computers participating in the blockchain.\n\nBlockchain technology is a structure that stores transactional records, also known as the block, of the public in several databases, known as the \u201cchain,\u201d in a network connected through peer-to-peer nodes. Typically, this storage is referred to as a \u2018digital ledger.\u2019\n\nEvery transaction in this ledger is authorized by the digital signature of the owner, which authenticates the transaction and safeguards it from tampering. Hence, the information the digital ledger contains is highly secure.\n\nIn simpler words, the digital ledger is like a Google spreadsheet shared among numerous computers in a network, in which, the transactional records are stored based on actual purchases. The fascinating angle is that anybody can see the data, but they can\u2019t corrupt it.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nDive into the transformative world of blockchain technology with our intensive Cyber security Bootcamp. Uncover the revolutionary potential of blockchain while honing your skills in safeguarding these decentralized systems. From understanding the intricacies of smart contracts to fortifying digital transactions, this bootcamp equips you to navigate the evolving landscape of cybersecurity within the blockchain domain. Don't miss this opportunity to become a proficient cybersecurity professional in the realm of blockchain.\n\nWhy is Blockchain Popular?\n\nSuppose you are transferring money to your family or friends from your bank account. You would log in to online banking and transfer the amount to the other person using their account number. When the transaction is done, your bank updates the transaction records. It seems simple enough, right? There is a potential issue which most of us neglect.\n\nThese types of transactions can be tampered with very quickly. People who are familiar with this truth are often wary of using these types of transactions, hence the evolution of third-party payment applications in recent years. But this vulnerability is essentially why Blockchain technology was created.\n\nTechnologically, Blockchain is a digital ledger that is gaining a lot of attention and traction recently. But why has it become so popular? Well, let\u2019s dig into it to fathom the whole concept.\n\nRecord keeping of data and transactions are a crucial part of the business. Often, this information is handled in house or passed through a third party like brokers, bankers, or lawyers increasing time, cost, or both on the business. Fortunately, Blockchain avoids this long process and facilitates the faster movement of the transaction, thereby saving both time and money.\n\nMost people assume Blockchain and Bitcoin can be used interchangeably, but in reality, that\u2019s not the case. Blockchain is the technology capable of supporting various applications related to multiple industries like finance, supply chain, manufacturing, etc., but Bitcoin is a currency that relies on Blockchain technology to be secure.\n\nBlockchain is an emerging technology with many advantages in an increasingly digital world:\n\nHighly Secure It uses a digital signature feature to conduct fraud-free transactions making it impossible to corrupt or change the data of an individual by the other users without a specific digital signature.\n\nIt uses a digital signature feature to conduct fraud-free transactions making it impossible to corrupt or change the data of an individual by the other users without a specific digital signature. Decentralized System Conventionally, you need the approval of regulatory authorities like a government or bank for transactions; however, with Blockchain, transactions are done with the mutual consensus of users resulting in smoother, safer, and faster transactions.\n\nConventionally, you need the approval of regulatory authorities like a government or bank for transactions; however, with Blockchain, transactions are done with the mutual consensus of users resulting in smoother, safer, and faster transactions. Automation Capability It is programmable and can generate systematic actions, events, and payments automatically when the criteria of the trigger are met.\n\nStructure and Design of Blockchain\n\nA blockchain is a distributed, immutable, and decentralized ledger at its core that consists of a chain of blocks and each block contains a set of data. The blocks are linked together using cryptographic techniques and form a chronological chain of information. The structure of a blockchain is designed to ensure the security of data through its consensus mechanism which has a network of nodes that agree on the validity of transactions before adding them to the blockchain.\n\nBlocks:\n\nA block in a blockchain is a combination of three main components:\n\n1. The header contains metadata such as a timestamp which has a random number used in the mining process and the previous block's hash.\n\n2. The data section contains the main and actual information like transactions and smart contracts which are stored in the block.\n\n3. Lastly, the hash is a unique cryptographic value that works as a representative of the entire block which is used for verification purposes.\n\nBlock Time:\n\nBlock time refers to the time taken to generate a new block in a blockchain. Different blockchains have different block times, which can vary from a few seconds to minutes or may be in hours too. Shorter block times can give faster transaction confirmations but the result has higher chances of conflicts but the longer block times may increase the timing for transaction confirmations but reduce the chances of conflicts.\n\nHard Forks:\n\nA hard fork in a blockchain refers to a permanent divergence in the blockchain's history that results in two separate chains. It can happen due to a fundamental change in the protocol of a blockchain and all nodes do not agree on the update. Hard forks can create new cryptocurrencies or the splitting of existing ones and It requires consensus among the network participants to resolve.\n\nDecentralization:\n\nDecentralization is the key feature of blockchain technology. In a decentralized blockchain, there is no single central authority that can control the network. In decentralization,the decision-making power is distributed among a network of nodes that collectively validate and agree on the transactions to be added to the blockchain. This decentralized nature of blockchain technology helps to promote transparency, trust, and security. It also reduces the risk to rely on a single point of failure and minimizes the risks of data manipulation.\n\nFinality:\n\nFinality refers to the irreversible confirmation of transactions in a blockchain. If and when a transaction is added to a block and the block is confirmed by the network, it becomes immutable and cannot be reversed. This feature ensures the integrity of the data and prevents double spending, providing a high level of security and trust in Blockchain Types & Sustainability\n\nOpenness:\n\nOpenness in blockchain technology makes the blockchain accessible to anyone who intends to participate in the network. This implies that it is open for all and anyone can join the network, validate transactions, and can add new blocks to the blockchain, so long as they know the consensus rules. Openness promotes inclusivity, transparency, and innovation, as it allows for participation from various stakeholders.\n\nPublic Blockchain:\n\nIt is a kind of blockchain which is open for the public and allows everyone to join the network to perform transactions and to participate in the consensus process. Public blockchains are transparent, because all transactions are publicly recorded.\n\nHow Does Blockchain Technology Work?\n\nIn recent years, you may have noticed many businesses around the world integrating Blockchain technology. But how exactly does Blockchain technology work? Is this a significant change or a simple addition? The advancements of Blockchain are still young and have the potential to be revolutionary in the future; so, let\u2019s begin demystifying this technology.\n\nBlockchain is a combination of three leading technologies:\n\nCryptographic keys A peer-to-peer network containing a shared ledger A means of computing, to store the transactions and records of the network\n\nCryptography keys consist of two keys \u2013 Private key and Public key. These keys help in performing successful transactions between two parties. Each individual has these two keys, which they use to produce a secure digital identity reference. This secured identity is the most important aspect of Blockchain technology. In the world of cryptocurrency, this identity is referred to as \u2018digital signature\u2019 and is used for authorizing and controlling transactions.\n\nThe digital signature is merged with the peer-to-peer network; a large number of individuals who act as authorities use the digital signature in order to reach a consensus on transactions, among other issues. When they authorize a deal, it is certified by a mathematical verification, which results in a successful secured transaction between the two network-connected parties. So to sum it up, Blockchain users employ cryptography keys to perform different types of digital interactions over the peer-to-peer network.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nTypes of Blockchain\n\nThere are different types of blockchains. They are as follows:\n\nPrivate Blockchain Networks\n\nPrivate blockchains operate on closed networks, and tend to work well for private businesses and organizations. Companies can use private blockchains to customize their accessibility and authorization preferences, parameters to the network, and other important security options. Only one authority manages a private blockchain network.\n\nPublic Blockchain Networks\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies originated from public blockchains, which also played a role in popularizing distributed ledger technology (DLT). Public blockchains also help to eliminate certain challenges and issues, such as security flaws and centralization. With DLT, data is distributed across a peer-to-peer network, rather than being stored in a single location. A consensus algorithm is used for verifying information authenticity; proof of stake (PoS) and proof of work (PoW) are two frequently used consensus methods.\n\nPermissioned Blockchain Networks\n\nAlso sometimes known as hybrid blockchains, permissioned blockchain networks are private blockchains that allow special access for authorized individuals. Organizations typically set up these types of blockchains to get the best of both worlds, and it enables better structure when assigning who can participate in the network and in what transactions.\n\nConsortium Blockchains\n\nSimilar to permissioned blockchains, consortium blockchains have both public and private components, except multiple organizations will manage a single consortium blockchain network. Although these types of blockchains can initially be more complex to set up, once they are running, they can offer better security. Additionally, consortium blockchains are optimal for collaboration with multiple organizations.\n\nHybrid Blockchains\n\nHybrid blockchains are the combination of both public and private blockchains. In a hybrid blockchain, some parts of the blockchain are public and transparent, while others are private and accessible only to authorized and specific participants. This makes hybrid blockchains ideal for use in those cases where a balance is required between transparency and privacy. For example, in supply chain management multiple parties can access certain information, but sensitive data can be kept private.\n\nSidechains\n\nSidechains are different blockchains that run parallel to the main blockchain, allowing for additional functionality and scalability. Sidechains enable developers to experiment with new features and applications without affecting the main blockchain's integrity. For example, sidechains can be used for creating decentralized applications and to implement specific consensus mechanisms. Sidechains can also be used to handle transactions of the main blockchain to reduce congestion and increase scalability.\n\nBlockchain Layers\n\nBlockchain layers refer to the concept of building multiple layers of blockchains on top of each other. Each layer can have its own consensus mechanism, rules, and functionality which can interact with other layers. This ensures greater scalability, as transactions can be processed in parallel across different layers. For example, the Lightning Network, built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, is a second layer solution that enables faster and cheaper transactions by creating payment channels between users.\n\nThe Process of Transaction\n\nOne of Blockchain technology\u2019s cardinal features is the way it confirms and authorizes transactions. For example, if two individuals wish to perform a transaction with a private and public key, respectively, the first person party would attach the transaction information to the public key of the second party. This total information is gathered together into a block.\n\nThe block contains a digital signature, a timestamp, and other important, relevant information. It should be noted that the block doesn\u2019t include the identities of the individuals involved in the transaction. This block is then transmitted across all of the network's nodes, and when the right individual uses his private key and matches it with the block, the transaction gets completed successfully.\n\nIn addition to conducting financial transactions, the Blockchain can also hold transactional details of properties, vehicles, etc.\n\nHere\u2019s a use case that illustrates how Blockchain works:\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program Hash Encryptions blockchain technology uses hashing and encryption to secure the data, relying mainly on the SHA256 algorithm to secure the information. The address of the sender (public key), the receiver\u2019s address, the transaction, and his/her private key details are transmitted via the SHA256 algorithm. The encrypted information, called hash encryption, is transmitted across the world and added to the blockchain after verification. The SHA256 algorithm makes it almost impossible to hack the hash encryption, which in turn simplifies the sender and receiver\u2019s authentication.\n\nblockchain technology uses hashing and encryption to secure the data, relying mainly on the SHA256 algorithm to secure the information.

The encrypted information, called hash encryption, is transmitted across the world and added to the blockchain after verification. The SHA256 algorithm makes it almost impossible to hack the hash encryption, which in turn simplifies the sender and receiver\u2019s authentication. Proof of Work In a Blockchain, each block consists of 4 main headers. Previous Hash: This hash address locates the previous block. Transaction Details: Details of all the transactions that need to occur. Nonce: An arbitrary number given in cryptography to differentiate the block\u2019s hash address. Hash Address of the Block: All of the above (i.e., preceding hash, transaction details, and nonce) are transmitted through a hashing algorithm. This gives an output containing a 256-bit, 64 character length value, which is called the unique \u2018hash address.\u2019 Consequently, it is referred to as the hash of the block. Numerous people around the world try to figure out the right hash value to meet a pre-determined condition using computational algorithms. The transaction completes when the predetermined condition is met. To put it more plainly, Blockchain miners attempt to solve a mathematical puzzle, which is referred to as a proof of work problem. Whoever solves it first gets a reward.\n\nIn a Blockchain, each block consists of 4 main headers.\n\nMining In Blockchain technology, the process of adding transactional details to the present digital/public ledger is called \u2018mining.\u2019 Though the term is associated with Bitcoin, it is used to refer to other Blockchain technologies as well. Mining involves generating the hash of a block transaction, which is tough to forge, thereby ensuring the safety of the entire Blockchain without needing a central system.\n\nHistory of Blockchain\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto, whose real identity still remains unknown to date, first introduced the concept of blockchains in 2008. The design continued to improve and evolve, with Nakamoto using a Hashcash-like method. It eventually became a primary component of bitcoin, a popular form of cryptocurrency, where it serves as a public ledger for all network transactions. Bitcoin blockchain file sizes, which contained all transactions and records on the network, continued to grow substantially. By August 2014, it had reached 20 gigabytes, and eventually exceeded 200 gigabytes by early 2020.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Blockchain\n\nLike all forms of technology, blockchain has several advantages and disadvantages to consider.\n\nAdvantages\n\nOne major advantage of blockchains is the level of security it can provide, and this also means that blockchains can protect and secure sensitive data from online transactions. For anyone looking for speedy and convenient transactions, blockchain technology offers this as well. In fact, it only takes a few minutes, whereas other transaction methods can take several days to complete. There is also no third-party interference from financial institutions or government organizations, which many users look at as an advantage.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nBlockchain and cryptography involves the use of public and private keys, and reportedly, there have been problems with private keys. If a user loses their private key, they face numerous challenges, making this one disadvantage of blockchains. Another disadvantage is the scalability restrictions, as the number of transactions per node is limited. Because of this, it can take several hours to finish multiple transactions and other tasks. It can also be difficult to change or add information after it is recorded, which is another significant disadvantage of blockchain.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nHow is Blockchain Used?\n\nBlockchains store information on monetary transactions using cryptocurrencies, but they also store other types of information, such as product tracking and other data. For example, food products can be tracked from the moment they are shipped out, all throughout their journey, and up until final delivery. This information can be helpful because if there is a contamination outbreak, the source of the outbreak can be easily traced. This is just one of the many ways that blockchains can store important data for organizations.\n\nHyperledger, Hosted by the Linux Foundation\n\nHyperledger is a global collaboration hosted by The Linux Foundation, including finance, banking, IoT, supply chain, manufacturing, and technology leaders. By creating a cross-industry open standard for distributed ledgers, Hyperledger Fabric allows developers to develop blockchain applications to meet specific needs.\n\nTen Steps to Your First Blockchain Application\n\nUnderstand what Blockchain is and its key components. Understand the purpose of your application. Create a use case for your application. Find out if there's already an existing blockchain for your purpose. Explore the different types of Blockchain platforms available for your application. There are many types of Blockchain, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Choose the right platform for developing your app. Select the consensus algorithm you will use. Learn Solidity - Ethereum's programming language for smart contracts and DApps (decentralized applications). Learn how to use Truffle or Remix - development tools for Ethereum DApps and smart contracts. Get an Ethereum account or wallet and buy some Ether (ETH), the currency of the Ethereum network.\n\nDecentralization\n\nDecentralization is difficult to Understand, but it is vital in the world today; decentralization is distributing or dispersing functions, powers, people, or things away from a central location or authority. Within the business world, decentralization typically refers to delegating authority from senior executives to middle managers and other employees further down the organizational hierarchy. The benefits of devolution are many and varied, but the most commonly cited advantages include improved communication, greater employee empowerment, and increased flexibility and responsiveness.\n\nTransparency\n\nOne of the most critical aspects of decentralization is transparency. All employees have access to information and decision-making processes in a decentralized organization. This transparency fosters a greater sense of trust and cooperation among employees. Furthermore, it allows employees to hold managers accountable for their decisions.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nBitcoin vs. Blockchain\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that was first introduced in 2009 and has been the most popular and successful cryptocurrency to date. Bitcoin's popularity is attributed to its decentralized nature, which means it doesn't have a central authority or bank controlling its supply. This also means that transactions are anonymous, and no transaction fees are involved when using bitcoin.\n\nBlockchain is a database of transactions that have taken place between two parties, with blocks of data containing information about each transaction being added in chronological order to the chain as it happens. The Blockchain is constantly growing as new blocks are added to it, with records becoming more difficult to change over time due to the number of blocks created after them.\n\nBlockchain vs. Banks\n\nBlockchain has the potential to revolutionize the banking industry. Banks need to be faster to adapt to the changing needs of the digital age, and Blockchain provides a way for them to catch up. By using Blockchain, banks can offer their customers a more secure and efficient way to conduct transactions. In addition, Blockchain can help banks to streamline their operations and reduce costs.\n\nWhy is Blockchain Important?\n\nBlockchain is important because it has the potential to revolutionize the banking industry. Banks need to be faster to adapt to the changing needs of the digital age, and Blockchain provides a way for them to catch up. By using Blockchain, banks can offer their customers a more secure and efficient way to conduct transactions. In addition, Blockchain can help banks to streamline their operations and reduce costs.\n\nWhat is a Blockchain Platform?\n\nA blockchain platform is a shared digital ledger that allows users to record transactions and share information securely, tamper-resistant. A distributed network of computers maintains the register, and each transaction is verified by consensus among the network participants.\n\nProof of Work (PoW) vs. Proof of Stake (PoS)\n\nProof of work (PoW) is an algorithm to create blocks and secure the Blockchain. It requires miners to solve a puzzle to create a block and receive the block reward in return.\n\nProof of stake (PoS) is an alternative algorithm for securing the Blockchain, which does not require mining. Instead, users must lock up some of their coins for a certain time to be eligible for rewards.\n\nEnergy Consumption Concerns of Blockchain\n\nThe main concern with blockchain technology is its energy consumption. Traditional blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, use a consensus mechanism called PoW( Proof of Work), which requires computational power and electricity to solve complex mathematical puzzles. This energy-intensive process has raised concerns about the environmental impact of blockchain technology because it produces carbon emissions and consumes a huge amount of electricity.\n\nBlockchain or Scalability Trilemma: Decentralization, Security, and Scalability\n\nBlockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of records called blocks. Blockchain is often said to have the potential to disrupt many industries, including banking, law, and healthcare.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nWhat are the Benefits of Blockchains Over Traditional Finance?\n\nBlockchain offers several potential advantages over traditional finance. One of the most touted advantages is that Blockchain is decentralized, while traditional finance is centralized. This means there is no single point of failure in a blockchain system. Another advantage of Blockchain is that it is more transparent than traditional finance.\n\nPromising Blockchain Use Cases and Killer Applications\n\nPromising Blockchain Use Cases and Killer Applications: Although there are many potential applications for blockchain technology, there are a few that stand out as having the potential to be truly game-changing. These are often referred to as killer applications. Some of the most promising killer applications for blockchain technology include supply chain management, identity management, and data management.\n\nPromising blockchain use cases and killer applications are being developed every day. The Shiba Inu team is committed to finding and developing the most promising applications for the SHIB community. The team has a proven track record in the cryptocurrency space, and they are committed to creating value for the SHIB community.\n\nHow to Invest in Blockchain Technology\n\nBlockchain technology and stocks can be a lucrative investment, and there are several ways to take the next step toward making your first blockchain investment purchase. Bitcoin is typically the first thing that comes to mind when it comes to investing in blockchain technology, and it shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Aside from Bitcoin, there is also the option of investing in cryptocurrency penny stocks, such as Altcoin and Litecoin. There are also certain apps and services that are in the pre-development phase and that are using blockchain technology to raise funding. As an investor, you can buy coins, with the expectation that prices will go up if the service or app becomes popular. Another way to invest in blockchain technology is to invest in startups built on blockchain technology. Finally, there is always the option to invest in pure blockchain technology.\n\nTraditional Finance and Blockchain Investment Strategies\n\nIn traditional finance, there are two main investment strategies: active and passive. Active investing involves picking stocks or other assets, and then holding onto them for a long period of time. Passive investing, on the other hand, involves investing in a basket of assets, and then holding onto them for a long period of time. Both of these strategies have their pros and cons, but there is one major difference between them: active investing is much more risky than passive investing.\n\nHow Do Different Industries Use Blockchain?\n\nBlockchain has the potential to streamline processes across many different industries.\n\nIn the supply chain industry, for example, Blockchain can track the movement of goods and materials as they change hands. This would allow for greater transparency and accountability and reduce the risk of fraud.\n\nIn the healthcare industry, Blockchain can be used to secure patient data and streamline the process of billing and claims.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nWhat are the Features of Blockchain Technology?\n\nBlockchain technology is a distributed ledger that is secure, transparent, and immutable.\n\nBlockchain technology can be used to create a decentralized database that is tamper-proof and has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with the digital world.\n\nBlockchain technology is secure, transparent, and tamper-proof.\n\nWhat are the Key Components of Blockchain Technology?\n\nThere are three key components to blockchain technology:\n\nThe distributed ledger, the consensus mechanism, and the smart contracts.\n\nThe distributed ledger is a database that is spread across a network of computers. The consensus mechanism is what allows the network of computers to agree on the state of the ledger.\n\nThe smart contracts are what allows the blockchain to be used for more than just a database.\n\nWhat are Blockchain Protocols?\n\nThe three most common protocols Bitcoin was the first blockchain protocol and is still the most widely used is:\n\nBitcoin- Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, often referred to as a cryptocurrency. It exists on a decentralized network of computers, often called a blockchain, that keeps track of all transactions made using the currency. Bitcoin uses a proof-of-work algorithm to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to be created and is the most well-known.\n\nRipple- Ripple is a cryptocurrency that is similar to Bitcoin. Ripple uses a decentralized network of computers to keep track of all transactions made using the currency. Ripple uses a proof-of-work algorithm to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. Ripple was created in 2012 and is the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nEthereum- The Ethereum blockchain was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin in 2013. Buterin, a programmer who was born in Russia and raised in Canada, had been involved with bitcoin from its early days. He was excited by the technology, but he thought that bitcoin needed a scripting language for application development. He decided to create a new platform that would be more general than bitcoin.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nWhat is the Difference Between a Database and a Blockchain?\n\nSo what is the difference between a database and a blockchain? A database is centralized, meaning that a single entity controls it. This entity can be a company, government, or individual. On the other hand, a blockchain is decentralized, meaning that any entity does not control it.\n\nHow is Blockchain Different From the Cloud?\n\nBlockchain is a new technology that is different from the cloud in several ways:\n\nBlockchain is decentralized, while the cloud is centralized. This means that Blockchain is distributed across a network of computers, while the cloud is stored on a central server.\n\nBlockchain is immutable, meaning that once data is written to the Blockchain, it cannot be changed.\n\nWhat is Blockchain as a Service?\n\nBlockchain as a Service is a cloud-based offering that allows customers to build, host, and use their blockchain applications, smart contracts, and functions on the Azure cloud platform. Azure offers integrated services that make it easy to develop, deploy, and manage blockchain applications. Customers can use Azure's managed services to create and deploy blockchain applications without having to set up and manage their infrastructure.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nWhat are the Implications of Blockchain Technology?\n\nBlockchain technology has made a great impact on society, including:\n\nBitcoin, Blockchain\u2019s prime application and the whole reason the technology was developed in the first place, has helped many people through financial services such as digital wallets. It has provided microloans and allowed micropayments to people in less than ideal economic circumstances, thereby introducing new life in the world economy.\n\nThe next major impact is in the concept of TRUST, especially within the sphere of international transactions. Previously, lawyers were hired to bridge the trust gap between two different parties, but it consumed extra time and money. But the introduction of Cryptocurrency has radically changed the trust equation. Many organizations are located in areas where resources are scarce, and corruption is widespread. In such cases, Blockchain renders a significant advantage to these affected people and organizations, allowing them to escape the tricks of unreliable third-party intermediaries.\n\nThe new reality of the Internet of Things (IoT) is already teeming with smart devices that \u2014 turn on your washing machines; drive your cars; navigate your ships; organize trash pick-up; manage traffic safety in your community \u2014 you name it! This is where blockchain comes in. In all of these cases (and more), leveraging blockchain technology by creating Smart Contracts will enable any organization to \u2012 both \u2014 improve operations and keep more accurate records.\n\nBlockchain technology enables a decentralized peer-to-peer network for organizations or apps like Airbnb and Uber. It allows people to pay for things like toll fees, parking, etc.\n\nBlockchain technology can be used as a secure platform for the healthcare industry for the purposes of storing sensitive patient data. Health-related organizations can create a centralized database with the technology and share the information with only the appropriately authorized people.\n\nIn the private consumer world, blockchain technology can be employed by two parties who wish to conduct a private transaction. However, these kinds of transactions have details that need to be hammered out before both parties can proceed:\n\nWhat are the terms and conditions (T&C) of the exchange? Are all the terms clear? When does the exchange start? When will it finish? When is it unfair to halt the exchange?\n\nSince blockchain technology employs a shared ledger, distributed ledger on a decentralized network, all parties involved can quickly find answers to these questions by researching \u201cblocks\u201d in the \u201cchain.\u201d Transactions on a blockchain platform can be tracked from departure to the destination by all of the transactions on the chain.\n\nHow Can Features of Blockchain Support Sustainability Efforts\n\nIn spite of huge energy consumption the blockchain technology has features that can support sustainability efforts. For example:\n\nBlockchain can give transparency and traceability in supply chains, allowing consumers to verify the origins and sustainability of products. This can encourage sustainable practices and discourage unethical practices such as deforestation, illegal fishing, or labor exploitation.\n\nDecentralization: Blockchain's decentralized nature helps to eliminate the need for intermediaries and reduce costs and also to increase efficiency. This can enable more direct and transparent transactions, reducing the environmental impact associated with traditional intermediaries.\n\nSmart Contracts: These are self-executing contracts that run on blockchain which eliminates the requirements for intermediaries and automating processes. This can reduce paperwork to minimize the disputes and streamline operations. It can help to lead to greater sustainability by reducing paper waste by increasing resource utilization.\n\nTokenization: Blockchain enables tokenization where assets can be represented as digital tokens. This can enable fractional ownership and make the process easier for people who intend to invest in sustainable assets such as renewable energy projects or carbon credits, promoting green investments and supporting sustainability initiatives.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough we just skimmed the industry-wide potential of blockchain applications in this article, the career potential in this field is growing exponentially. Getting ahead of the game is always a good strategy for any professional. At Simplilearn, our latest and most up-to-date course on this emerging field is the Professional Blockchain Certificate Program in Blockchain.

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price has failed to breach the 50- and 200-day EMAs for about two months.\n\nWhale addresses holding over 1 million ETH now hold 32.3% of the entire circulating supply.\n\nWhales are likely to accumulate as they may see a prospect of a rally.\n\nEthereum price is finding difficulty in achieving a breakthrough for about two months now. However, this has not rubbed off on the investors in any way, who are standing more bullish now than they ever were, especially the big buck holders.\n\nEthereum price downtrend could end soon\n\nEthereum price trading at $1,568 bounced off the support line at $1,533 earlier last week to increase slightly. However, the altcoin failed to breach through the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Had it managed to do so, ETH would have been closer to reclaiming the resistance level marked at $1,686 into a support floor.\n\nNevertheless, Ethereum price still has a shot at recovery, looking at the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The indicator is hovering in the bearish zone around the neutral mark at 50.0, and upon further recovery, this line would be flipped into a support floor. This would then suggest a bullish signal has been confirmed.\n\nETH/USD 1-day chart\n\nBut if the bullish signal is not confirmed and the $1,533 support is lost, the bullish thesis would be invalidated and Ethereum price could fall below the $1,500 mark.\n\nEthereum whales could prevent a decline\n\nThe chances of the Ethereum price falling do exist, but the investors\u2019 behavior would act as a shield protecting the altcoin from a bearish wave. This is evident in the way the whale holders are acting. Even though ETH is not a whale-centric coin, the whales play a major role in the price action since they are the biggest investors.\n\nAccording to data from Santiment, the addresses holding more than 1 million ETH in their wallets have consistently accumulated and now hold about 32.3% of the entire circulating supply. This is the highest concentration of ETH in these addresses since July 2016, marking a seven-year high.\n\nWhat is to be noted here is that this is not random accumulation, as one can note from the chart below that these whales began actively loading ETH right around mid-August when the Ethereum price fell. Since then, the total holdings have risen by more than 1.5% and are still growing.\n\nEthereum whale holdings\n\nThis will have a bullish impact on Ethereum price, which is exactly what is needed at the moment to push the altcoin back above $1,600."

Born from a contentious hard fork, Ethereum Classic (ETC) has managed to carve out its own identity separate from its more famous sibling, Ethereum. While it recently experienced a notable spike, market analysts and traders are keeping a close eye, balancing optimism with caution due to the coin\u2019s historical volatility.\n\nNavigating the price range of $14.90-$17.31, Ethereum Classic (ETC) financial trajectory is a topic of much debate. The moving averages, while indicative of potential trends, also underscore the coin\u2019s unpredictability. Resistance levels, suggesting potential price ceilings, are closely watched, but the looming support levels hint at possible downturns that could be on the horizon.\n\nThe road ahead for Ethereum Classic (ETC) is paved with both opportunities and challenges. While the coin has shown moments of impressive growth and has a dedicated community backing it, the broader crypto market\u2019s volatility means that nothing is guaranteed. Traders and investors are advised to keep a close eye on market trends, regulatory news, and technological advancements related to Ethereum Classic (ETC).\n\nBitcoin SV (BSV): The Bitcoin Successor?\n\nBitcoin SV (BSV), standing for \u201cBitcoin Satoshi Vision,\u201d has always been a topic of discussion since its inception. Positioned as the \u201ctrue vision\u201d of Bitcoin\u2019s mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin SV (BSV) has both its ardent supporters and skeptics. Its recent price movements have further intensified the debates surrounding its potential and future.\n\nWith a trading range of $29.10-$33.41, Bitcoin SV (BSV) financial landscape is as dynamic as its history. The moving averages, while providing some insights, also highlight the coin\u2019s inherent volatility. Resistance levels paint a picture of potential highs, but the support levels serve as a sobering reminder of how quickly tides can turn in the crypto world.\n\nThe future for Bitcoin SV (BSV) is a blend of promise and uncertainty. While its technological vision and commitment to on-chain scaling present opportunities for growth and adoption, the broader crypto market\u2019s fluctuations and the coin\u2019s controversial history mean that its path is far from straightforward. For traders and investors, a keen understanding of BSV\u2019s technological nuances, coupled with a vigilant eye on the market, will be crucial.\n\nPepe (PEPE): The Meme Coin Phenomenon\n\nPepe (PEPE) is not just another coin in the vast crypto universe; it represents the power of internet culture and the unpredictable nature of meme-driven assets. Born from the world of internet memes, Pepe (PEPE) has transitioned from being a simple internet joke to a cryptocurrency that traders are genuinely considering.\n\nPepe (PEPE) 10-Day Moving Average stands at $0.0000006491, slightly below its current lower trading range, suggesting recent upward momentum. The 100-Day Moving Average, at $0.0000009915, indicates a potential long-term bullish sentiment. However, with support levels at $0.0000002906 and $0.0000005167, there\u2019s room for downward movement. Resistance levels at $0.0000009689 and $0.0000011950 provide targets for potential upward breakouts.\n\nWhile Pepe (PEPE) has shown moments of impressive growth, its future, like most meme coins, is uncertain. The crypto landscape is littered with meme coins that have experienced meteoric rises followed by sharp declines.

Considering all of the above, it\u2019s not surprising that the presale numbers are outstanding \u2013 it can surely be a boon to many in the long run.\n\nScapesMania is at the point where previous buyers can already assume they\u2019ve made a great decision and now the time is right for those who haven\u2019t tried the project yet. Get in now to reach potential ROIs of 400-500% or maybe even higher.\n\nEthereum (ETH): The Pioneer\u2019s Plight\n\nEthereum (ETH), previously standing unchallenged in the decentralized sector, is now confronting serious obstacles that undermine its supremacy. A notable decrease in validator participation raises red flags, potentially pointing to latent network deficiencies or a decline in user enthusiasm. With the advent of alternative blockchains boasting attractive capabilities, the solidity of Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) stature is under scrutiny.\n\nIn the current scenario, Ethereum\u2019s valuation swings between $1,570 and $1,732, presenting a critical juncture for the cryptocurrency. The 10-Day Moving Average, positioned at $1,574, leans towards a near-term negative outlook, as per ChatGPT\u2019s analysis. Conversely, the 100-Day Moving Average, at $1,720, hints at an upward trajectory over an extended period, suggesting that not all hope is lost for Ethereum enthusiasts. These contrasting trends depict an intense standoff between market optimists and pessimists.\n\nNavigating a path strewn with challenges, Ethereum (ETH) capitalizes on its foundational ecosystem and a vibrant community of developers. However, the pressure from up-and-coming blockchains and intrinsic adversities may dampen its market allure. ChatGPT underscores the importance of Ethereum (ETH) proactively confronting its prevailing challenges; failure to do so could compromise its future market position. The analytical foresight provided indicates a pivotal phase for Ethereum, where its responses to internal and competitive pressures could be decisive in sculpting its trajectory in the cryptocurrency domain.\n\nSolana (SOL): The Rising Star\u2019s Dilemma\n\nSolana (SOL), once celebrated for its scalability and potential, is encountering burgeoning competition, particularly evidenced by the surge in development activities around competitors like Cardano. This intense rivalry underscores the unpredictable and fickle landscape of the cryptocurrency arena. The faith placed in Solana\u2019s (SOL) potential is undergoing a rigorous examination, with outcomes that don\u2019t particularly tilt in its favor.\n\nThe pricing behavior of Solana (SOL) presents a captivating study. As the value oscillates between $18.55 and $22.99, the crypto asset approaches a critical juncture. The 10-Day Moving Average, clocking in at $22.45, coupled with the 100-Day Moving Average at $22.12, points towards a looming phase of market consolidation, as observed by ChatGPT. Current resistance and support metrics imply an impending breakout, although market speculations are rife regarding the definitive direction.\n\nLooking ahead, a haze of uncertainty engulfs Solana\u2019s (SOL) prospects. Despite its laudable technical attributes, the unforgiving nature of the crypto market spares no one, Solana (SOL) included. It wrestles with a gamut of challenges ranging from stiffening competition, intricate regulatory environments, and volatile investor sentiments. ChatGPT theorizes that amidst these multifaceted pressures, maintaining its present market standing is a herculean task for Solana (SOL), with growth appearing even more challenging. The platform\u2019s resilience in navigating these market turbulences will be a litmus test for its long-term viability and success.\n\nRipple (XRP): Regulatory Resilience Uncertainty\n\nRecent market activities, including speculative buzz around potential nods for iShares Bitcoin spot ETF by industry titan BlackRock, have spurred episodic yet ephemeral upticks in Ripple\u2019s (XRP) financial charts. This erratic pattern highlights the quandary Ripple (XRP) finds itself in, struggling to cement its reputation as a steadfast, dependable player in the tumultuous crypto domain. Despite its bespoke advantages in areas such as international payment corridors, the overarching investor sentiment around Ripple (XRP) vacillates.\n\nCurrently, with value markers swinging between $0.466 and $0.556, there\u2019s a palpable sense of investor trepidation. ChatGPT points out that the 10-Day Moving Average hovers around $0.494, whereas the 100-Day Moving Average is perched slightly higher at $0.572, signaling prevailing market jitters. For Ripple (XRP), the resistance thresholds at $0.597 and $0.688 loom as formidable frontiers to breach, while the support echelons at $0.327 and $0.417 insinuate that additional depreciations could very well be forthcoming.\n\nAmidst its entanglement in legal spats and the murky waters of regulatory scrutiny, a cloud of uncertainty looms over Ripple (XRP). Despite earnest initiatives to vindicate its standing and assert its merit as a bona fide asset within the financial tapestry, opinions amongst the investment fraternity are split. ChatGPT emphasizes that the ramifications of ongoing courtroom tussles are pivotal, wielding the power to make or break Ripple (XRP) esteem and the confidence it commands among investors. The future narrative of Ripple hinges critically on these unfolding events, dictating its trajectory in the competitive crypto race.\n\nCardano (ADA): The Challenger\u2019s Journey\n\nAmidst a whirlwind of speculation and scrutiny within the crypto arena, Cardano (ADA) finds itself grappling with pivotal questions about its future. Despite achieving laudable milestones on the development front, opinions within the digital currency circles are starkly polarized regarding its endurance in the long haul. The uptick in developmental pursuits is noteworthy, yet it beckons inquiry into whether this vigor is a sustainable trajectory or merely a transient gust of progress.\n\nThe financial contours for Cardano (ADA) delineate a trend of instability and circumspection among its backers. With prices in a dance between $0.240 and $0.263, the asset\u2019s 10-Day Moving Average charts a course at $0.249, while the 100-Day Moving Average anchors at a slightly more optimistic $0.274, illustrating the market\u2019s teetering confidence. Resistance strata at $0.272 and $0.294 underscore Cardano (ADA)\u2019s tribulations in clinching loftier valuations, and the support bases at $0.205 and $0.227 loom as harbingers of potential dips, subject to the whims of broader market sentiment.\n\nCardano (ADA) touts a formidable technical scaffold and a bustling sphere of developers \u2013 its cardinal virtues. However, ChatGPT notes that the marketplace harbors reservations concerning its trajectory ahead. The shadows cast by burgeoning rival blockchains, along with Cardano\u2019s intrinsic conundrums, could potentially tether its valuation to lower echelons. It necessitates more than algorithmic artistry to captivate the trading masses; it mandates the cultivation of confidence, the nurturing of strategic alliances, and crucially, the fulfillment of its lofty proclamations. Absent these, its station in the cryptocurrency pecking order wavers on shaky grounds\n\nConclusion:\n\nEthereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA) each present a unique set of challenges and opportunities in the current market. Ethereum, once a dominant force, now faces competition and internal issues. Solana, despite its initial promise, is tested by market dynamics. Ripple\u2019s future is clouded by regulatory battles, and Cardano, with its strong technical foundation, still needs to solidify its market position. Meanwhile, ScapesMania, with its innovative approach and growing traction, shows promising potential to carve out a significant niche for itself in the market.\n\nThe project is sure to attract major interest from savvy traders since it offers impressive discounts and gives you a chance to win your fair share of $150,000.

        "title": "Solana Is Winning The Energy-Efficiency Race But Ethereum \"Is Too Large To Ignore\" - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "One developer, \u201c0xIchigo,\u201d behind Helius, a software company developing infrastructure for users to build on Solana, thinks Solana is winning the energy efficiency race. However, competing platforms, especially Ethereum, are here to stay.\n\nEthereum Is Here To Stay, Solana Is Winning The Energy Efficiency Race\n\nEthereum and Solana aim to serve the same user base, but the former was the first to launch, with the latter being a generation-4 blockchain. It seeks to resolve challenges faced by the original smart contract platform. For this reason, Solana is more performant and has higher throughput, though there have been instances where its reliability has been questioned.\n\nOn energy efficiency, the developer noted that for every transaction confirmed on Bitcoin, the world\u2019s most valuable network using the proof-of-work consensus algorithm, 5 billion Joules of energy is spent. A similar transaction on Ethereum will see 144k Joules of energy expended. Meanwhile, the same on Solana will see 658 Joules of energy consumed, less than what goes into a \u201cGoogle search.\u201d\n\nThe high energy spent on Bitcoin is primarily because of the ledger\u2019s consensus algorithm, which requires miners to spend electricity as they run gear, competing to solve cryptographic problems. Successful miners add the valid block of transactions to the chain in exchange for a 6.25 BTC reward and transaction fees accumulated from the block.\n\nThe proof-of-work consensus algorithm is usually more energy-intensive and consumes more energy than alternative systems used by Solana and Ethereum. Ethereum shifted to a proof-of-stake system in September 2022.\n\nIt depends on validators who don\u2019t have to run expensive gear but stake at least 32 ETH. As of October 18, there were more than 978,000 validators. Meanwhile, over 1,970 validators were securing and validating transactions on Solana.\n\nEthereum Is \u201cToo Large To Ignore\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile energy efficiency is one of the key metrics being considered, especially by protocols launching on smart contract platforms, activity is critical. So far, Ethereum is one of the most active smart contract platforms, looking at, for instance, the total value locked (TVL) by decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Ethereum manages over $20 billion of DeFi assets, while Solana trails at around $324 million.\n\nThis could be why 0xIchigo, though pointing out the advantage of Solana, is adamant that Ethereum and its virtual machine (EVM) are \u201ctoo large to ignore.\u201d Still, in the developer\u2019s assessment, this advantage makes the EVM rigid and hard to scale over time. Transaction fees, which fluctuate, greatly impact the virtual machine, making it a less desirable option for payment companies.\n\nRelated Reading: Bitcoin On The Brink: 50% Drop Possible Ahead Of Halving, Analyst Warns\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"
