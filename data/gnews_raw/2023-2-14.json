The process uses a \u201cprover\u201d that determines if a dataset is true or false \u2014 all while maintaining user privacy.\n\nBlockworks research analyst Sam Martin noted that \u201czkEVM race is well underway, with stiff competition amongst zkSync, Polygon, Scroll, Taiko, and others.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll teams are taking different approaches, but Polygon\u2019s zkEVM has been classified as a Type-3 by Vitalik Buterin given its near EVM equivalence and choice to forgo the use of precompiles,\u201d he said.\n\nType-3 zkEVMs are \u201calmost EVM-equivalent\u201d \u2014 but require a few sacrifices before it meets the golden standard of Type-1, the fully Ethereum equivalent EVM.\n\n\u201cIt is possible that the first zkEVM to launch on mainnet without any limitations could garner significant traction with a first-mover advantage, so keeping a close eye on developments in this space throughout 2023 will be important.\u201d\n\nOver the next couple of weeks, Polygon Labs, the team behind Polygon \u2014 will be revealing more details about the Mainnet Beta.\n\n\u201cSecurity is the highest priority, which is why Polygon zkEVM has been run through a gauntlet of tests and audits,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cUsers and devs can expect full transparency about the security measures that will protect the Ethereum community during Mainnet Beta.\u201d\n\nAt the time of writing, Polygon\u2019s MATIC token is trading at $1.23, up by over 4% over the past 24 hours.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nAfter the U.S. government blacklisted Tornado Cash transactions for U.S. people in August, there was a swift response by validators on the Ethereum blockchain to exclude sanctioned transactions. For many in the crypto industry, such moves were decried as censorship \u2013 directly counter to the vision of a decentralized network free from government interference.\n\nNow, however, the trend is going the other way, and more blocks with Tornado Cash are going through even if they\u2019re not compliant with U.S. Treasury Dept. sanctions.\n\nAccording to an MEV watchdog site, just 49% of blocks that made it onto the Ethereum blockchain over the past 24 hours were OFAC-compliant, meaning the blocks excluded transactions that have been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control.\n\nThis is a significant decrease in censorship from Ethereum\u2019s past. Ethereum hit an all-time high for censorship on Nov. 21, when 79% of blocks relayed on Ethereum excluded OFAC-sanctioned transactions. The last time that Ethereum\u2019s censored blocks were below 50% was Oct.16.\n\nPut another way, that means that more than half of the blocks that made it onto the Ethereum blockchain over the last 24 hours are non-OFAC compliant.\n\nSo what has reversed Ethereum\u2019s censorship course?\n\nPost-Merge OFAC Compliant Blocks (mevwatch.info)\n\nMEV-Boost contributed to Ethereum\u2019s censorship problem\n\nSince Ethereum changed its consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake in September (known as the Merge), most of the blocks that make it onto the blockchain go through a middleware component known as MEV-Boost, which is a software that allows validators to request pre-made blocks from builders.\n\nMEV-Boost came into existence to help validators earn MEV, or Maximal Extractible Value, which are profits derived from including or reordering transactions within a block.\n\nThe software was built by Flashbots, an Ethereum research and development team, in order to democratize MEV among validators and skirt issues of centralization.\n\nStory continues\n\nFlashbots has succeeded in having MEV-Boost used across the ecosystem, as 96% of validators today have relayed blocks via the middleware. The firm also runs its own relayer, which is used by 68% of validators.\n\nBut a new set of issues, mainly censorship, arose with MEV-Boost after OFAC blacklisted Tornado Cash transactions for U.S. people in August.\n\nAs a result of the sanctioning, relayers using MEV-Boost deliver to their connected validators only pre-built blocks without Tornado Cash transactions included. In other words, MEV-Boost was censoring blocks by default.\n\nRead more: Is Ethereum\u2019s Censorship Problem Taking a Turn?\n\nHas the censorship course reversed?\n\nThe push for validators to connect to other relayers that are not Flashbots\u2019 has been at the center of reversing Ethereum\u2019s censorship course.\n\nToday, 68% of blocks relayed have been done via Flashbots. As recently as December, that number was at 74%. Before Flashbots began censoring Tornado Cash transactions following the Merge, it open-sourced the code so that others could develop their own non-censoring relays.\n\nThere are now seven relayers that are noncensoring. Those include two of BloXroute\u2019s relayers (max profit and ethical), Ultrasound, Agnostic Gnosis, Manifold, Relayoor and Aestus.\n\nRelayers and total market share (mevboost.pics)\n\nMartin K\u00f6ppelmann, a censorship-resistance advocate and the co-founder of Gnosis Chain, which also runs a noncensoring relayer, shared in a tweet that the decline in censorship is partially thanks to BloXroute, Ultrasound and Gnosis since they make up most of the uncensored block space.\n\nWhile this is good news this very much depends currently on just 3 entities: @bloXrouteLabs, @ultrasoundmoney, and @GnosisDAO (those 3 relays make up for 47% of uncensored block space)\n\nSo we still need more systemic solutions \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/xo3zTKqiMu \u2014 Martin K\u00f6ppelmann \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 (@koeppelmann) February 14, 2023\n\nK\u00f6ppelmann told CoinDesk that he believes this \u201cis good news and I am happy Gnosis is contributing, but I also believe Ethereum censorship resistance should not depend on so few entities.\u201d\n\nRead more: Is Ethereum\u2019s Censorship Problem Taking a Turn?"

        "content": "This year has been off to a positive start for crypto investors, with many cryptocurrencies surging over the past several weeks.\n\nEthereum (ETH 0.32%) is currently up by more than 26% so far this year, after falling by nearly 68% throughout 2022. This growth is promising for investors, giving hope that perhaps the worst of this crypto winter is behind us.\n\nEthereum was recently priced at just under $1,500 per token. Many investors are optimistic about its potential, though, and there's a chance it could soar past $2,000. Does that mean now is the time to buy?\n\nIs Ethereum still a good investment?\n\nCrypto in general is still largely speculative. Nobody can say for certain what its future looks like, or whether it will even exist a decade or two from now. When you're choosing where to invest, then, it's wise to focus on a cryptocurrency's long-term potential.\n\nAt the moment, Ethereum is one of the strongest investments in the crypto sector. It has a unique set of advantages, including:\n\nA first-mover advantage: Ethereum was launched in 2015, well before competitors like Solana , Cardano , and Avalanche . That first-mover advantage has helped it grow into one of the most widely used blockchains in the crypto industry.\n\nEthereum was launched in 2015, well before competitors like , , and .

It's also an open-source blockchain, meaning developers can create new projects on the network. If any of these projects take off, Ethereum will benefit from it.\n\nEthereum is also the most popular network for decentralized applications (dApps), including DeFi projects, non-fungible token marketplaces, and metaverse uses. It's also an open-source blockchain, meaning developers can create new projects on the network. If any of these projects take off, Ethereum will benefit from it. A home for other cryptos: Ethereum can also host other cryptos on its network, and it's home to several high-profile projects including Shiba Inu, Polygon, The Sandbox, and Decentraland. If any crypto hosted on Ethereum's blockchain succeeds, Ethereum itself will thrive as well.\n\nLike any investment, Ethereum also has its downsides. The network continues to struggle with sluggish transaction speeds and high gas fees, for example, which have been causing frustration among users.\n\nBut developers have been diligently working on upgrades to improve the blockchain. The much-anticipated update of 2022, The Merge, went off without a hitch and successfully transitioned Ethereum from a proof-of-work protocol to proof of stake. And its upcoming upgrade, Shanghai, will help improve the staking process.\n\nEthereum also has future upgrades in the pipeline to increase its efficiency and reduce fees, and the most important of these updates is currently slated for sometime in 2023 or 2024.\n\nShould you invest in Ethereum right now?\n\nWhether or not you choose to invest in Ethereum now will depend on a couple of factors, including your long-term outlook and tolerance for risk.\n\nAgain, all cryptocurrency is still speculative at the moment, so despite all of Ethereum's advantages, there are no guarantees that the sector as a whole will thrive over the long term. But if you believe in Ethereum's potential and are willing to take that risk, now could be a smart time to buy.\n\nBefore you invest, though, double-check your finances and overall portfolio. Crypto is notoriously volatile, and Ethereum is no exception. Don't invest anything you can't afford to lose, be sure you're willing to keep your money invested for at least a few years, and prepare for more volatility in the near term.\n\nAlso, it's wise to ensure that the rest of your portfolio is well diversified. This will help protect your savings in case your crypto investments don't pan out.\n\nEthereum could be a fantastic long-term investment, but there are never any guarantees when it comes to crypto. By assessing your tolerance for risk, it will be easier to decide whether it's the right investment for you."

        "content": "On-chain data from Santiment shows the Ethereum supply on exchanges has dropped by 37% since the Merge in September last year.\n\nEthereum Supply On Exchanges Has Continued To Decline Recently\n\nAs per the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, ETH continuing to leave exchanges can be good news for the cryptocurrency. The \u201csupply on exchanges\u201d is an indicator that measures the total amount of Ethereum that\u2019s currently sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges.\n\nWhen this metric\u2019s value increases, investors transfer a net number of coins to exchanges. Since one of the main reasons holders may deposit their coins to exchanges is for selling purposes, this trend can have bearish implications for the asset\u2019s price.\n\nOn the other hand, the indicator observing a decline suggests that a net amount of supply is leaving these platforms currently. As the exchange supply can be considered a sort of available \u201cselling supply\u201d for ETH, its value decreasing can naturally be bullish for the coin.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum supply on exchanges over the last few months:\n\nThe value of the metric seems to have sharply gone down in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter\n\nAs shown in the above graph, the Ethereum supply on exchanges measured around 19.12 million ETH back on the 14th of September 2022, the date of the much-hyped Merge, which successfully transitioned the network consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) one.\n\nSince then, the indicator has observed a significant decline, leading to the number of exchanges still left today being just 13.36 million ETH. Regarding capital loss, today\u2019s exchange supply is worth about 37% less than it was during the Merge.\n\nAnd in terms of the pure difference in the total number of coins, these platforms today hold about 30% less Ethereum supply than on the date of the PoS upgrade. Santiment thinks this is good news for the Ethereum market, as the available selling supply has continuously shrunk in recent months.\n\nThe chart shows that the most drastic drawdown in the indicator came following the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX. The reason behind that is a known platform like FTX going belly up renewed fear around centralized exchanges among investors, pushing them to take their coins to offsite wallets.\n\nThe price of Ethereum has registered a decline in the past week. Still, as is visible in the graph, the Ethereum supply on exchanges has seen a noticeably sharper decline following this price dip, which may be a sign that investors are accumulating more while ETH is at a \u201cdiscount.\u201d\n\nETH Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $1,500, down 8% in the last week.\n\nIt looks like the value of ETH hasn't moved much in the last few days | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Jievani Weerasinghe on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Since its humble origins back in 2015, there has been a core of people who strongly believe in the potential Ethereum has to change the world. When the value of the network\u2019s native token of Ether surged past $4,600 last year, this group of people only skyrocketed.\n\nEven when the price of Ether subsequently dropped, the number of people keen to get on board only continued to grow. Because, despite the worldwide drop in crypto prices, Ethereum ploughs on and continues to remain the decentralised blockchain network of choice for countless projects, cryptocurrencies and, increasingly, mainstream sectors, businesses, and industries.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the Ethereum blockchain and the many applications and projects hosted upon it have drastically changed our world for the better. Increasingly, it\u2019s being used to great effect to overhaul a range of sectors and businesses, from tourism and aviation to the military and real estate.\n\nEthereum is showing no sign of stopping anytime soon. But today, I want to explore an important topic: Can Ethereum hit that monumental milestone of $100,000 per token? And if so, why?\n\nPlus, if you\u2019re one of the many people keen to get on board with Ethereum and invest in it for the future, I\u2019ll also be showing you how to do so in the safest and most popular method whilst simultaneously helping you to avoid scam platforms.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re short on time and want the short and sweet of this article, here it is!\n\nAccording to many respected crypto experts worldwide, Ethereum can reach a value of $100,000 per token. This is because of the increasing reliance that digital bonds, tokenised real estate and securities, DEFI, and NFTs are showing towards Ethereum, combined with the impending rollout of ETH 2.0, which aims to deal with scalability issues stemming from the flood of people trying to use the network.\n\nWhen? Most people predict that Ethereum could hit the $100,000 mark when Bitcoin hits 1.5 million, which is expected to be sometime within a decade.\n\nHowever, please remember that this article is neither a price prediction nor is it investment advice. It is merely speculation into the future of Ethereum and what it has the potential to achieve. Now, keep reading for the fascinating in-depth answer!\n\nDoes Ethereum Have the Potential to Hit $100K?\n\nTo look into the potential of Ethereum properly, we have to explore some of the blockchain network\u2019s most promising aspects. Firstly is its ability to host decentralised applications (dApps) and allow developers and programmers to build an unlimited array of fascinating projects upon it.\n\nWhen a project, cryptocurrency, or network is built on the Ethereum network, it is then granted the many benefits that come with blockchain technology, such as decentralisation, enhanced security, and better transparency.\n\nFor example, take some current business giants like Twitter or Instagram. The same type of business, albeit centralised and with way better capabilities, can be built upon the Ethereum blockchain. However, Ethereum itself is more closely related to a form of the internet, which is why it\u2019s often referred to as \u201cthe internet 2.0\u201d.\n\nOf course, Ethereum isn\u2019t the only big player in the world of blockchain networks. You also have contenders like Solana and the Binance smart chain. However, when it comes to the first choice of developers and programmers, Ethereum is number one. To prove this point, let\u2019s look at just how much Ethereum has a stronghold in the DeFi and NFT market.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Stronghold in the DeFi and NFT market\n\nRemember when I mentioned Ethereum\u2019s \u201ccompetitors\u201d? Well, some might not even call them competitors at all. Just take the Binance smart chain (Ethereum\u2019s main competition), for example. The former hosts a mere 10% of all DeFi applications on the global DeFi market, whereas Ethereum has an insanely high percentage of 60%. And the number is rapidly rising.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not all. From the birth of the NFT sector, Ethereum has equally had a stronghold in the NFT market, too. However, regarding NFTs, Solana is hot on Ethereum\u2019s heels. But will it last forever?\n\nThe main reason behind Solana\u2019s increasing market share in the NFT market is that it can offer higher speeds, lesser fees, and a better level of scalability than Ethereum. At least, that was the case before the announcement of ETH 2.0., Ethereum\u2019s answer to the scalability issues the network had been facing. As the Ethereum upgrade is successfully rolled out over time, it has the potential to conquer its rivals and remain as the powerhouse of blockchain networks.\n\nAfter all, when ETH 2.0 secures Ethereum\u2019s position as a high-speed, affordable network with a high level of scalability, developers and programmers don\u2019t have much incentive to create decentralised apps or mint NFTs on other networks that are lesser than Ethereum.\n\nEthereum Can Be Used on a State Level\n\nState-level use of decentralised currencies and blockchain technology seemed like a pipedream not too long ago. But these days, it\u2019s a very real reality. Increasingly, governments worldwide are showing intense interest in blockchain technology. In particular, many are interested in writing their national laws on decentralised networks like Ethereum and taking advantage of blockchain technology like many others do.\n\nIn addition, there is an increasing number of governments interested in using blockchains like Ethereum to log data on the ownership of land and property in their country in a more transparent, secure, and interconnected way than the flawed current processes.\n\nWhen it comes to real-world use cases of Ethereum being implemented on a state level by global governments, the list is endless. However, these two examples mentioned above are some which are most commonly seen.\n\nWhere Are People Buying Ethereum & Where Is It Safe to Do So?\n\nAnd now, to answer an important question, and one I\u2019m sure many of you are keen to find out! Where do people buy Ethereum, and how do they do it safely?\n\nSadly, there are many dodgy places and faces in the crypto market, and many of them are lying in wait to take advantage of new investors who are a little green around the gills. However, this can be sidestepped by using a well-liked and popular platform like Binance. Alternatively, you can consider using a marketing tool that will connect you to a suitable crypto broker\n\nEthereum Is Already Being Used by Centralized Banks\n\nRecently, a major piece of news dropped regarding the use of Ethereum by a central bank. It was announced that the EU-owned European Investment Bank (EIB) was planning to issue the institution\u2019s first digital bond created on a public blockchain. And yes, as you\u2019ve probably guessed, it was issued on the Ethereum blockchain!\n\nThat\u2019s seriously big news! A centralised bank backed by multiple EU member states just administered a bond using the Ethereum blockchain. If that\u2019s not bullish, I don\u2019t know what is!\n\nAfter all, the global market for bonds is worth a whopping $100 trillion. Now, imagine if this market sees a significant shift towards using the Ethereum network for issuing bonds. If this happens, it\u2019s almost a given that Ethereum will equally become the go-to network for hosting central bank-issued digital currencies. To say this could cause its price to skyrocket is an understatement.\n\nA good example of this is Norway, where the Scandinavian country\u2019s central bank is currently trialling a CBDC (central bank digital currency) on the Ethereum network. The plan, which a cryptocurrency company is working on with the Norwegian central bank, is to create a digitised version of the Krone, Norway\u2019s national fiat currency. The test phase is underway and is seeing what kind of financial impact the digitised currency will have on the country.\n\nAll of this ties in with the ongoing merge to ETH 2.0, which, with each update being rolled out, is increasingly allowing the Ethereum network to scale enough that it can meet the needs of central banks and governments on a national level, as well as overcome the challenges that come with it.\n\nEthereum and the Real Estate Revolution\n\nTraditionally, the realm of real estate has been seen as a solid investment and one that is often pushed for people to invest their money into. However, getting a foot on the property ladder requires a lot of capital, to begin with. This initial step into the world of real estate can be a major hurdle for many people, but Ethereum has the potential to change this.\n\nLet\u2019s say, for example, that you\u2019re looking to own a property that is 100 square metres in size and worth $100,000. You need money (who doesn\u2019t?), and the property is the bulk of all of your assets. Of course, you could sell, but then you\u2019d be without a house! But, with Ethereum, there is another option at hand. You can tokenise the property.\n\nDoing so is pretty simple. You just need to mint a token on the Ethereum blockchain (one which emanates its worth from the property itself). Let\u2019s say; for example, you create a digital token. For instance; you can create one token per square foot and value them at $100,000/ 100 square metres = $1000 each.\n\nThen? You just need to sell as many tokens to investors as you need while keeping most of them for yourself. Let\u2019s say you sell 20% of tokens for a total of $20,000; you still get to own 80% of your property with a nice profit to spend or reinvest elsewhere.\n\nThis way, you keep 80% of the property while other investors own 20%.\n\nOK, So Just When Will Ether (ETH) Reach $100K?\n\nWell, truth be told, it\u2019s impossible to tell. After all, as I mentioned at the beginning, this article is neither a price prediction nor a piece of investment advice. However, when you look at the opinions of many respected crypto experts worldwide, many have predicted that the Ethereum network\u2019s native currency of Ether (ETH) could potentially hit $100K within the next ten years.\n\nConclusion: Yes, Ethereum Can Reach $100K\n\nTo summarise this article, we\u2019ve looked into several reasons why Ethereum has the potential to one day hit $100,000. The main reasons behind this are the increasing use of Ethereum in the world of digital bonds, real estate, and government and central bank usage of the blockchain network on a state level.\n\nMany experts are eyeing these increasing use cases of Ethereum daily. A growing number of them have all agreed that it\u2019s merely a case of time before Ethereum potentially surges to $100,000 or more."

        "title": "Bored Ape Owner Burns $169K NFT to Move It From Ethereum to Bitcoin - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA valuable digital collectible was permanently removed from circulation over the weekend, as its owner aimed to symbolically shift the asset\u2019s underlying blockchain from Ethereum to Bitcoin.\n\nThe collectible was Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) #1626, an Ape from the most valuable project in the NFT space. Its most recent sale on OpenSea took place last November when it sold for 108 Ethereum\u2014that's nearly $432,000 at the time of the transaction, or around $169,000 at today's prices.\n\nNFTs are digital assets that are provably unique and signify the ownership of an item, often digital art. The ownership of BAYC #1626 is linked to a digital token that is recorded on the Ethereum network, where it could also be traded\u2014that is, up until recently.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDigital tokens can be permanently removed from circulation through a process called burning, which involves sending an asset to a location where it cannot be retrieved. Jason Williams claimed to have burned BAYC #1626 over the weekend, preventing it from being sold ever again, at least on Ethereum\u2019s network.\n\n\u200b\u200b\u201cEssentially throwing a Lamborghini into a trash compactor\u2013It's kind of fun,\u201d Williams told Decrypt. \u201cWhether putting bloated JPEGs on Bitcoin\u2019s base chain is smart or not is a whole 'nother discussion, but I think it's going to be a lot of fun seeing how it plays out.\u201d\n\nWilliams believes his Ape now exists on Bitcoin. That\u2019s because the location to which BAYC #1626 was burned is linked to an Inscription made through Ordinals. Ordinals, created by Casey Rodarmor, is a project that allows content like videos and images to be assigned to individual satoshis\u2014the smallest unit that Bitcoin can be divided into\u2014where they permanently exist on Bitcoin\u2019s network as Inscriptions.\n\nEven though the number of Inscriptions on Bitcoin is approaching 100,000, there are few notable marketplaces for people to trade them, and a significant number of buyers and sellers are linked together currently through Ordinal\u2019s discord server.\n\nThe burn took place using a newly developed feature for Ordinals named Teleburn, which creates a unique location with each new Inscription to which digital assets can be burned. The feature allows users to assign an existing asset from another network to a Bitcoin Inscription while removing it from circulation, effectively transferring the token between chains in the eyes of those who created the new feature.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe idea is that you are one-way, permanently burning an asset on another chain and pointing it to the ordinal that lives on the Bitcoin chain,\u201d said Rob Hamilton, who collaborated with Rodarmor to create the new Ordinals feature.\n\nHamilton approached Rodarmor about developing the Teleburn function last Saturday at Bitcoin Park, a coworking space in Nashville, Tennessee that caters to the Bitcoin community. The two decided to work together after Hamilton pointed out that Williams wanted to burn his Ape, who had responded to one of Rodarmor\u2019s Tweets.\n\nHelp me. \u2014 Jason A. Williams (@GoingParabolic) February 11, 2023\n\n\u201cLet's go write some code right now,\u201d Rodarmor said, according to Hamilton, adding that the prospect of burning an Ape got Rodarmor \u201creally excited.\u201d\n\nRodarmar did not respond to requests for comment from Decrypt. However, the two can be seen developing Ordinal\u2019s Teleburn function in a recent Tweet, according to Hamilton.\n\nBurning BAYC #1626 wasn\u2019t the first time that Ordinal\u2019s Teleburn function was used. Rodarmor first tested the new feature out on an ENS domain he owned, rodarmor.eth. Then the pair oversaw Williams as he burned the ape.\n\nThe term Teleburn was coined by Rodarmor, as a combination of the words teleport and burn, said Hamilton. Rodarmor referenced the function\u2019s hasty development with Hamilton in a recent tweet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHamilton believes the Teleburn function will catch on as a way for people to bridge their digital collectibles, noting that Rodarmor plans to extend Ordinal\u2019s Teleburn support to assets on other chains aside from Ethereum, such as Tezos and Solana.\n\n\u201cThis has now set the standard of representing an asset across the chain,\u201c said Hamilton. \u201cIt's going to be the way to actually have skin in the game,\u201d pointing out that assets burned are permanently gone from circulation.\n\nA chimp off the old block?\n\nAs news of the Bored Ape burn spread on Twitter Monday, Yuga Labs co-founder Greg Solano weighed in on the matter, stating the Inscription linked to BAYC #1626 is an unlicensed reproduction of the original NFT because Williams no longer maintains its possession on Ethereum\u2019s network.\n\n\u201cIf you transfer your ape to an address you no longer control (even if it's the 'burn' address), you have effectively given up your license,\u201d he stated.\n\nSolano also pushed back against the notion that BAYC #1626 is \u201cgone from [Ethereum] forever,\u201d as mentioned in the post\u2019s initial Tweet, because it still exists on-chain, even if people can no longer access it.\n\nIt's not \"gone from ETH forever.\" It's basically the same as any other transfer: If you transfer your ape to an address you no longer control (even if it's the 'burn' address), you have effectively given up your license.\n\nAnd no, before someone asks, that doesn't mean that anyone\u2026 https://t.co/E52b7ZjWbu \u2014 Garga.eth (Greg Solano) (@CryptoGarga) February 13, 2023\n\nA spokesperson from Yuga Labs confirmed to Decrypt the company believes the Inscription of BAYC #1626 is an illegitimate Ape.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"Only NFTs minted from Ethereum contract: 0xBC4CA0EdA7647A8aB7C2061c2E118A18a936f13D are legitimate BAYC NFTs,\" a Yuga spokesperson said, referencing the smart contract that yielded the collection's 10,000 Apes.\n\nWhether the new Ordinals function could supplant Ethereum\u2019s popularity for hosting digital art is doubtful, according to the CEO of Web3 development platform Hiro Alex Miller. Hiro builds tools for Stacks, a network built on top of Bitcoin that aims to bring smart contract functionality to the underlying network.\n\n\u201cAs much as I am very pro-Bitcoin and think there\u2019s going to be a massive ecosystem there, it's not going to replace Ethereum NFTs tomorrow, or probably at all,\u201d Hiro told Decrypt. \u201cI think it's gonna be interesting to see where this goes.\u201d\n\nMiller said the Teleburn function provides a solution for keeping track of a digital art\u2019s provenance\u2014the record of prior ownership\u2014across blockchains, adding that it\u2019s challenging to establish which digital collectible is the real one if it exists in circulation on multiple chains.\n\nThe Hiro CEO also compared how data is stored on Bitcoin using Ordinals versus Ethereum NFTs. While it\u2019s possible to store assets such as images on-chain using Ethereum, most NFTs point to an asset that is stored off-chain, whether that\u2019s also an image or another type of file. With Inscriptions, the data is stored directly and permanently on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\n\nRegardless of whether the Inscription of BAYC #1626 is an unofficial version of its Ethereum-based predecessor, Miller thinks the collectible will \u201ccarry a lot of value\u201d because of its first-of-a-kind nature.\n\n\u201cHe basically turned it into something that is now an ultra-rare [Ape],\u201d Miller said, referencing the categories by which NFTs are often ascribed value based on the rarity of their attributes. \u201cThe market is going to value it as its own unique piece of art.\u201d"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has recently swapped around 210 ETH, worth approximately $325,000, for USDC stablecoin, according to on-chain data. But what motivated this move?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne potential reason is that Buterin simply decided to cash out some of his holdings while the price of ETH is high. As the cryptocurrency market continues to experience price swings, many investors choose to sell their assets during market rallies to lock in profits.\n\nAnother possibility is that Buterin needed funds for a particular purpose, such as investing in a new project or paying for expenses. While the exact reason for the transaction is unclear, it is worth noting that he has previously donated significant amounts of his wealth to charitable causes.\n\nMoreover, some speculate that Buterin is taking a more risk-averse approach to his holdings, which is why he has chosen to convert some of his ETH into a stablecoin like USDC. USDC is pegged to the U.S. dollar, which makes it less volatile than cryptocurrencies, and it can be used to make purchases or trades on various exchanges.\n\nIt is also possible that Buterin is simply rebalancing his portfolio or making room for new investments. As an experienced blockchain user and developer, he is likely to have a diverse portfolio of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, and selling Ethereum for USDC might be a strategic move to make further purchases of different tokens, even those that are not EVM-based.\n\nIt is worth noting that Buterin's recent swap has not had a significant impact on the price of Ethereum, which continues to experience price volatility in response to various factors, such as network activity, market sentiment and regulatory developments."

        "content": "Starlight bridges knowledge and development gap for zero-knowledge applications (zkApps)\n\nDevelopers can now experiment and build privacy-enabled features for solidity smart contracts\n\nThe EY organization contributed to the public domain the functional beta version of zero-knowledge-proof (ZKP) compiler Starlight to enable secure, private business logic on the public Ethereum ecosystem. Starlight supports the needs of complex business agreements where business logic must be shared between parties at the network level but privacy from competitors also remains critical.\n\nPaul Brody, EY Global Blockchain Leader, says:\n\n\u201cStarlight\u2019s beta release is the next step in industrializing blockchain privacy technology. The goal is to help transform how enterprises do business by making B2B integration simple and standardized. With Starlight, developers can migrate complex, B2B business agreements from private portals and point-to-point systems like Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), on to the public Ethereum network all while retaining the privacy and security that enterprises require.\u201d\n\nEY teams first contributed Starlight to the public domain in 2021 as a prototype business logic complier to facilitate the creation of zkApps, or decentralized applications that use ZKP technology. This is not the first time EY teams have contributed to the advancement of ZKP technology. In 2019, EY teams contributed the blockchain privacy-based protocol Nightfall. Then earlier this year, EY teams updated the public domain source code of Nightfall to help enable the development of privacy-focused enterprise blockchain solutions. Nightfall and Starlight were both developed to address concerns around data sovereignty and privacy as enterprises learned how difficult it is to preserve commercial confidentiality on a shared network.1\n\nStarlight is also designed to bridge the knowledge and development gap for zkApps by making it easier for developers to bring and use privacy features in the construction of decentralized applications.\n\nDr. Duncan Westland, EY Global Head of Blockchain Research and Development, says:\n\n\u201czkApps have a steep learning curve, can take weeks or more to build, and require extensive experience with ZKP technology. Using Starlight, developers can easily mark-up standard solidity contracts with the elements and logic that need to be made private and compile them into zero knowledge applications that can be deployed on-chain.\u201d\n\nBrody concludes:\n\n\u201cWith the combination of Starlight and Nightfall, the goal is to make it possible for enterprises to handle both large scale asset, inventory and payment management and multi-party business logic all on the public Ethereum network. Enterprises are still in the early stages of maturing these systems, but the end-state goal is clear: any multi-party business agreement with both shared data and business rules should be manageable on the public Ethereum blockchain, and without the need for a centralized intermediary.\u201d\n\nThe source code for Starlight and supporting tools are in the public domain and are available on GitHub.*\n\n-ends-"

More importantly, on a broader time frame, Ether is down 52.5% in twelve months, which partially explains why derivatives metrics were somewhat neutral after Ether\u2019s failed attempt to break $1,700 on Feb. 8.\n\nCurrently, investors\u2019 biggest concerns are the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s lawsuits and enforcement actions against crypto firms, including Kraken\u2019s tanking its staking-as-a-service program and PayPal reportedly pausing its stablecoin project due to regulatory concerns.\n\nA crackdown by the SEC on crypto staking is expected to have unintended consequences for decentralized finance, according to Jacob Blish, the head of business development at Lido DAO. Blish joined a growing number of people in the crypto industry calling for transparency in crypto sector regulation.\n\nOn the bright side, Ethereum developers announced the pre-launch of the Shanghai upgrade on the Zhejiang testnet. According to a blog post on Feb. 10, the transition is required to enable withdrawals from validators\u2019 staking positions. The Zhejiang test network is the first of three testnets that simulate Shanghai, which is expected to go live in March, although a specific date has not been released.\n\nLet\u2019s look at Ether derivatives data to understand if the $1,700 price rejection has impacted crypto investors' sentiment.\n\nETH futures show slowing demand for leverage longs\n\nRetail traders usually avoid quarterly futures due to their price difference from spot markets. Professional traders prefer these instruments because they prevent the fluctuation of funding rates in a perpetual futures contract.\n\nThe three-month futures annualized premium should trade between 4% to 8% in healthy markets to cover costs and associated risks. However, when futures trade at a discount versus regular spot markets, it shows a lack of confidence from leverage buyers, which is a bearish indicator.\n\nEther 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe above chart shows that derivatives traders are more bearish because the Ether futures premium moved below the 4% threshold. Consequently, bears can celebrate that the indicator failed to display a modest premium even as ETH tested $1,700 on Feb. 8.\n\nThe absence of demand for leverage longs does not necessarily translate to an expectation of adverse price action. Hence, traders should analyze Ether\u2019s options markets to understand how whales and market makers are pricing the odds of future price movements.\n\nA key options risk metric flirted with the bearish sentiment\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign when market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 10%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew metric below -10%, meaning the bearish put options are in less demand.\n\nRelated: US lawmakers and experts debate SEC's role in crypto regulation\n\nEther 30-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas.ch\n\nThe delta skew flirted with the bearish 10% level on Feb. 14, signaling stress from professional traders. That is a stark contrast from late January when the 25% skew index hovered near 2% \u2014 indicating similar upside and downside risks.\n\nUltimately, both options and futures markets point to pro traders moving to a neutral-to-bearish sentiment, displaying moderate discomfort after the $1,700 price rejection.\n\nConsequently, the odds favor Ether bears because the hostile regulatory environment tends to amplify the adverse effects of FUD \u2014 whether or not it directly impacts the Ethereum network\u2019s adoption and use cases.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Bored Ape Owner Burns $169K NFT to Move It From Ethereum to Bitcoin - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "A valuable digital collectible was permanently removed from circulation over the weekend, as its owner aimed to symbolically shift the asset\u2019s underlying blockchain from Ethereum to Bitcoin.\n\nThe collectible was Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) #1626, an Ape from the most valuable project in the NFT space. Its most recent sale on OpenSea took place last November when it sold for 108 Ethereum\u2014that's nearly $432,000 at the time of the transaction, or around $169,000 at today's prices.\n\nNFTs are digital assets that are provably unique and signify the ownership of an item, often digital art. The ownership of BAYC #1626 is linked to a digital token that is recorded on the Ethereum network, where it could also be traded\u2014that is, up until recently.\n\nDigital tokens can be permanently removed from circulation through a process called burning, which involves sending an asset to a location where it cannot be retrieved. Jason Williams claimed to have burned BAYC #1626 over the weekend, preventing it from being sold ever again, at least on Ethereum\u2019s network.\n\n\u200b\u200b\u201cEssentially throwing a Lamborghini into a trash compactor\u2013It's kind of fun,\u201d Williams told Decrypt. \u201cWhether putting bloated JPEGs on Bitcoin\u2019s base chain is smart or not is a whole 'nother discussion, but I think it's going to be a lot of fun seeing how it plays out.\u201d\n\nWilliams believes his Ape now exists on Bitcoin. That\u2019s because the location to which BAYC #1626 was burned is linked to an Inscription made through Ordinals. Ordinals, created by Casey Rodarmor, is a project that allows content like videos and images to be assigned to individual satoshis\u2014the smallest unit that Bitcoin can be divided into\u2014where they permanently exist on Bitcoin\u2019s network as Inscriptions.\n\nEven though the number of Inscriptions on Bitcoin is approaching 100,000, there are few notable marketplaces for people to trade them, and a significant number of buyers and sellers are linked together currently through Ordinal\u2019s discord server.\n\nStory continues\n\nOrdinals Gain Momentum With 76,000 NFTs Minted to Bitcoin\n\nThe burn took place using a newly developed feature for Ordinals named Teleburn, which creates a unique location with each new Inscription to which digital assets can be burned. The feature allows users to assign an existing asset from another network to a Bitcoin Inscription while removing it from circulation, effectively transferring the token between chains in the eyes of those who created the new feature.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that you are one-way, permanently burning an asset on another chain and pointing it to the ordinal that lives on the Bitcoin chain,\u201d said Rob Hamilton, who collaborated with Rodarmor to create the new Ordinals feature.\n\nHamilton approached Rodarmor about developing the Teleburn function last Saturday at Bitcoin Park, a coworking space in Nashville, Tennessee that caters to the Bitcoin community. The two decided to work together after Hamilton pointed out that Williams wanted to burn his Ape, who had responded to one of Rodarmor\u2019s Tweets.\n\nHelp me. \u2014 Jason A. Williams (@GoingParabolic) February 11, 2023\n\n\u201cLet's go write some code right now,\u201d Rodarmor said, according to Hamilton, adding that the prospect of burning an Ape got Rodarmor \u201creally excited.\u201d\n\nRodarmar did not respond to requests for comment from Decrypt. However, the two can be seen developing Ordinal\u2019s Teleburn function in a recent Tweet, according to Hamilton.\n\nBurning BAYC #1626 wasn\u2019t the first time that Ordinal\u2019s Teleburn function was used. Rodarmor first tested the new feature out on an ENS domain he owned, rodarmor.eth. Then the pair oversaw Williams as he burned the ape.\n\nThe term Teleburn was coined by Rodarmor, as a combination of the words teleport and burn, said Hamilton. Rodarmor referenced the function\u2019s hasty development with Hamilton in a recent tweet.\n\nHamilton believes the Teleburn function will catch on as a way for people to bridge their digital collectibles, noting that Rodarmor plans to extend Ordinal\u2019s Teleburn support to assets on other chains aside from Ethereum, such as Tezos and Solana.\n\n\u201cThis has now set the standard of representing an asset across the chain,\u201c said Hamilton. \u201cIt's going to be the way to actually have skin in the game,\u201d pointing out that assets burned are permanently gone from circulation.\n\nA chimp off the old block?\n\nAs news of the Bored Ape burn spread on Twitter Monday, Yuga Labs co-founder Greg Solano weighed in on the matter, stating the Inscription linked to BAYC #1626 is an unlicensed reproduction of the original NFT because Williams no longer maintains its possession on Ethereum\u2019s network.\n\n\u201cIf you transfer your ape to an address you no longer control (even if it's the 'burn' address), you have effectively given up your license,\u201d he stated.\n\nSolano also pushed back against the notion that BAYC #1626 is \u201cgone from [Ethereum] forever,\u201d as mentioned in the post\u2019s initial Tweet, because it still exists on-chain, even if people can no longer access it.\n\nIt's not \"gone from ETH forever.\" It's basically the same as any other transfer: If you transfer your ape to an address you no longer control (even if it's the 'burn' address), you have effectively given up your license.\n\nAnd no, before someone asks, that doesn't mean that anyone\u2026 https://t.co/E52b7ZjWbu \u2014 Garga.eth (Greg Solano) (@CryptoGarga) February 13, 2023\n\nA spokesperson from Yuga Labs confirmed to Decrypt the company believes the Inscription of BAYC #1626 is an illegitimate Ape.\n\n\"Only NFTs minted from Ethereum contract: 0xBC4CA0EdA7647A8aB7C2061c2E118A18a936f13D are legitimate BAYC NFTs,\" a Yuga spokesperson said, referencing the smart contract that yielded the collection's 10,000 Apes.\n\nWhether the new Ordinals function could supplant Ethereum\u2019s popularity for hosting digital art is doubtful, according to the CEO of Web3 development platform Hiro Alex Miller. Hiro builds tools for Stacks, a network built on top of Bitcoin that aims to bring smart contract functionality to the underlying network.\n\n\u201cAs much as I am very pro-Bitcoin and think there\u2019s going to be a massive ecosystem there, it's not going to replace Ethereum NFTs tomorrow, or probably at all,\u201d Hiro told Decrypt. \u201cI think it's gonna be interesting to see where this goes.\u201d\n\nMiller said the Teleburn function provides a solution for keeping track of a digital art\u2019s provenance\u2014the record of prior ownership\u2014across blockchains, adding that it\u2019s challenging to establish which digital collectible is the real one if it exists in circulation on multiple chains.\n\nThe Hiro CEO also compared how data is stored on Bitcoin using Ordinals versus Ethereum NFTs. While it\u2019s possible to store assets such as images on-chain using Ethereum, most NFTs point to an asset that is stored off-chain, whether that\u2019s also an image or another type of file. With Inscriptions, the data is stored directly and permanently on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\n\nRegardless of whether the Inscription of BAYC #1626 is an unofficial version of its Ethereum-based predecessor, Miller thinks the collectible will \u201ccarry a lot of value\u201d because of its first-of-a-kind nature.\n\n\u201cHe basically turned it into something that is now an ultra-rare [Ape],\u201d Miller said, referencing the categories by which NFTs are often ascribed value based on the rarity of their attributes. \u201cThe market is going to value it as its own unique piece of art.\u201d"

        "content": "The decentralized autonomous organization behind Lido \u2014 the largest Ethereum staking pool \u2014 is deliberating whether it should sell or stake the $30 million in Ether (ETH) from its treasury.\n\nA proposal was submitted on Feb. 14 by the DAO\u2019s financial unit, Steakhouse Financial, that considers four choices, one of which contemplates staking part or all of its ETH on Lido in the form of Lido Staked ETH (stETH).\n\nAnother would see LidoDAO selling a part or all of its 20,304 ETH for a stablecoin, with the purpose being to extend the DAO\u2019s runway.\n\nThe four proposals submitted by Steakhouse Financial to the LidoDAO asking how it should manage its treasury. Source: Lido\n\nThe proposal comes as ETH staking withdrawals will soon be enabled through Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai and Capella upgrades, which are expected to take place sometime early this year, according to the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nWhile converting the ETH to Staked ETH may lead to more protocol rewards, the DAO is wary that too much staking may risk it not having enough Ether on hand \u201cin case of need.\u201d\n\nAssets currently held in LidoDAO\u2019s treasury. ETH currently accounts for about 9% of the DAO\u2019s over $350 million treasury holdings. Source: Lido\n\nRegarding operating expenses, Steakhouse Financial said it may be necessary to swap Ether for a stablecoin in order to \u201cpreemptively secure additional runway.\u201d\n\nSteakhouse Financial noted that with LidoDAO\u2019s current inflows at about 1000 stETH per month, the DAO is making approximately $1.3 million to 1.5 million per month with the price of ETH hovering between $1,100 and $1,700 over the past few months.\n\nThe monthly inflow of stETH on Lido has steadily increased since January 2021. Source: Dune Analytics\n\nSteakhouse Financial said those figures alone should be \u201csufficient to cover monthly operating expenses.\u201d\n\nHowever, they\u2019re still deliberating whether it is worth converting excess stETH into a stablecoin to better prepare for any change in market conditions that may lead to increased operating expenses.\n\nA business development representative from LidoDAO said that they\u2019re not particularly thrilled with the current state of the stablecoin market:\n\n\u201cConsidering all the FUD and rumors, both DAI due to USDC collateral and USDC itself pose potential risk if they become frozen. That being said I have issues with the liquidity of LUSD and USDT has yet its own issues.\u201d\n\nIt appears as though most LidoDAO members are in favor of partially selling and staking a portion of the 20,304 ETH locked in its Aragon smart contract.\n\nRelated: Lido overtakes MakerDAO and now has the highest TVL in DeFi\n\nThe proposals come as the total value locked (TVL) of stETH fell 6.66% from Feb. 6 to Feb. 13.\n\nLido Analytics: Feb 06 - 13, 2023\n\n\n\nTLDR:\n\n- Lido TVL is down -6.66%, following a -7.22% fall in the price of ETH.\n\n- Lido led in new stake on Ethereum, with a 27% share in weekly deposits.\n\n- New @AaveAave V3 wstETH: 34,726 (+34.87%).\n\n- Lido on Polygon reaches 2% market share. pic.twitter.com/iWA9YccM6e \u2014 Lido (@LidoFinance) February 13, 2023\n\nThe TVL of Lido is currently $8.13 billion, according to on-chain metrics platform DeFiLlama."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe sudden and explosive rise of Bitcoin NFTs via the new Ordinals project has sparked plenty of creativity from Web3 builders. Chainspace is one of the most vibrant examples to date\u2014an experimental art project that connects Bitcoin and Ethereum through a lo-fi video rendering app that\u2019s tied to both chains.\n\nThe project spans 800 total on-chain apps, each a unique portal that pseudonymous co-creators Timshel and el-ranye describe as a \u201cdigital object that emits infinite art.\u201d Put simply, each web app\u2014which lives entirely in an Ordinals inscription on the Bitcoin blockchain\u2014is like a Snapchat filter that manipulates the image coming from your computer or device camera.\n\nEssentially, it takes your detailed selfie cam footage and renders it like old-school ASCII art, using letters and symbols to depict your real-time video view in a more abstract, stylized manner. Each Chainspace portal gives a different effect, and some are inspired by the look and vibe of notable Web3 projects like Loot and Terraforms.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\na @el__ranye x @TimshelXYZ experimental art project \u2514\u2af8 https://t.co/tpkbsRaFdf \ud835\ude8a \ud835\ude99\ud835\ude98\ud835\ude9b\ud835\ude9d\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude95 \ud835\ude92\ud835\ude97\ud835\ude9d\ud835\ude98 \ud835\ude8c\ud835\ude91\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude92\ud835\ude97\ud835\ude9c\ud835\ude99\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude8c\ud835\ude8e inscribed onchain on BTC on a single satoshi will be minting via @ourzora mega thanks to @isiain who worked w/ me on a cross-chain BTC<>ETH renderer https://t.co/B7bvLw0fFD pic.twitter.com/DAjMKdRai0 \u2014 Timshel {\ud835\ude9d\ud835\ude91\ud835\ude98\ud835\ude9e \ud835\ude96\ud835\ude8a\ud835\udea2\ud835\ude8e\ud835\ude9c\ud835\ude9d} (@TimshelXYZ) February 9, 2023\n\nTimshel, who\u2019s a key figure in the emerging \u201cLootverse\u201d gaming community and involved in on-chain publishing efforts, told Decrypt that Chainspace provides a way for Web3 users to share a bit of their humanity with communities without fully doxxing themselves. Timshel showcased Chainspace-derived screenshots that users shared in the project\u2019s Discord.\n\n\u201cThis is beautiful because this \u2018GM\u2019 is much more essential and resonant and human than [a] random Pepe emoji,\u201d Timshel told Decrypt. \u201cThere's something really cool and special to see how people are using this, sharing their feelings, their selves, and their faces.\u201d\n\nThe NFT or inscription is not an \u201caccess pass\u201d to an experience hosted elsewhere. Because Ordinals can hold a lot more on-chain data than an Ethereum NFT, the complete web app is inscribed onto the Bitcoin blockchain as a digital artifact. Each Chainspace portal exists as its own unique Ordinals inscription that can be transferred between owners.\n\n\u201cThe Ordinals innovation, and the idea of inscribing up to now 4MB of content onto a single Satoshi on Bitcoin\u2014it just immediately clicked to me,\u201d Timshel told Decrypt. \u201cIt opened up a whole blossom of ideas in my head about things you can do that are higher fidelity than what's possible on ETH, but still create a token on ETH that's tradable and ownable.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAcross chains\n\nHis comment hints at the Ethereum component of the Chainspace equation, but there are layers to it. Thursday\u2019s NFT mint will actually take place on Ethereum, with each portal represented by an Ethereum NFT that can be minted through Zora and traded through major marketplaces.\n\nThe Ethereum NFT is connected to the Bitcoin-based Ordinal on-chain through a smart contract\u2014which holds the code that powers decentralized apps (dapps) and NFT projects\u2014developed by Zora software engineer Iain Nash. The Ethereum NFT artwork you see on a marketplace like OpenSea is actually a screenshot generated from the Ordinal inscription.\n\nBut they\u2019re also paired in the sense that the NFT buyers can choose to trade in the Ethereum version and take custody of the Bitcoin Ordinal instead. Right now, that requires a manual process that Timshel and el-ranye can handle, but they aim to make it an easier, automated process as more and more Ordinals infrastructure comes online.\n\nAs such, Timshel describes Chainspace as being \u201c200% on-chains\u201d\u2014yes, plural\u2014since there\u2019s a part of the experience on both Bitcoin and Ethereum, and they\u2019re intertwined.\n\nBut the swap of the Ethereum NFT for custody of the Bitcoin Ordinal is a one-way process; they won\u2019t let users swap back and forth or hold both versions at the same time. He also cautioned that the ability to swap is dependent in part on the status of Ordinals, a fast-evolving space that has proven contentious to some Bitcoin aficionados. It\u2019s all an experiment for now.\n\nChainspace portals are publicly accessible, again reinforcing the idea that NFT owners are not buying an exclusive access pass. Anyone can use one of the portals and capture a still image from the manipulated video feed, and then they can do whatever they want with those\u2014share them through social media, mint them on-chain, generate derivative art, etc.\n\nThey\u2019ll put 620 of the NFTs on sale on Thursday, with an allowlist of active Discord users\u2014people who have already shared their Chainspace screenshots and creations\u2014able to mint one of the Ethereum NFTs for 0.33 ETH (about $550). Another 100 NFTs will be airdropped to Web3 builders who helped or influenced the project, with 60 NFTs reserved for the team.\n\nAnother 20 Chainspace apps, called X-portals, will have no Ethereum NFT counterpart and will live exclusively on Bitcoin. Those will be reserved for future auctions, as well as for the community around Ethereum NFT art project, Terraforms.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u2018Smashed penny\u2019\n\nGiven that they\u2019re publicly accessible, why would someone want to buy and own a Chainspace portal that isn\u2019t exclusively available to them? It doesn\u2019t come with any future promised utility or benefits, for example. A handful of the portals are available to play with via the project\u2019s website, while others can be accessed via each Ordinal\u2019s own page.\n\nTimshel cited the growing buzz around Ordinals and early on-chain inscriptions, and bets that people excited about on-chain media and Web3 experiments will want to own a portal. He likened it to public art installations that are open to all but ultimately still owned by someone, and compared an inscribed Satoshi to a souvenir flattened penny from an amusement park.\n\nI'm having so much fun generating these Chainspace templates aka high-functionality digital objects that bridge you into a higher plane. Experimental/performance art by @TimshelXYZ and @richa891 - in Chainspace, you are the art!\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/9c7AOtje3c \u2014 ozorian89 (@richa891) February 11, 2023\n\n\u201cI think people are really excited about owning the actual Satoshi itself,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want the \u2018smashed penny\u2019 with art on it in their wallet.\u201d\n\nAlready, they\u2019re seeing people turn Chainspace still images into derivative projects, such as Ethereum NFTs of screenshots of hand gestures or AI-assisted generative interpretations. People are free to do what they want with the portals, even if they don\u2019t own them.\n\nBut ultimately, the goal is to explore new frontiers in experimental on-chain art tools while giving each user a totally unique experience. It loops back to the phrase that the co-creators have been using since the project was unveiled last week: \u201cYou are the art.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery portal is public and inscribed on Bitcoin for anybody to render, forever. But every viewing is a private one-of-one,\u201d Timshel explained. \u201cI don't think there ever will be another time where somebody's pixels and Chainspace look exactly like what's on my screen right now. It\u2019d be like finding a grain of sand in the universe.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nLido Finance and Optimism are rolling out a new incentive program to get liquid stakers migrated over to the layer-2 network.\n\nAs part of the LidoOnLayer2 initiative, which seeks to improve liquidity for Lido\u2019s staked Ethereum (stETH) product across all layer-2 solutions, the project has been granted 1 million OP tokens from Optimism.\n\nThese tokens will provide an added OP reward for users who stake their Ethereum with Lido, move that staked Ethereum to Optimism, and provide liquidity for select token pairs. The program kicks off today and ends in six months.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOP is the governance token for Optimism, a layer-2 scaling solution that uses rollups to help scale the Ethereum network by moving activity off of the mainnet, batching it, and then executing this compressed data on the mainnet.\n\nLido Finance is the market\u2019s largest liquid staking platform, letting users deposit a variety of proof-of-stake (PoS) tokens and earn rewards for doing so. Instead of needing 32 ETH, a whopping $49,000 today, to begin staking on Ethereum, users can instead deposit any amount into Lido and begin earning. The service is also available for Polygon, Solana, Polkadot, and Kusama.\n\nHow does the Optimism, Lido program work?\n\nIn exchange for their ETH deposits, Lido users get the stETH token in return, which can then be used elsewhere in DeFi to earn yield or to borrow against.\n\nVia this new arrangement with Optimism, users who choose to move their stETH over to the layer-2 network will now earn additional rewards in the form of Optimism\u2019s native OP token.\n\nImportantly, users won\u2019t be migrating stETH to Optimism. Instead, as per Lido\u2019s expansion to a variety of different layer-2 networks, wrapped stETH (wstETH) will be the available asset. This specific asset is more compatible and easier to integrate with crypto protocols.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe value of wstETH on Optimism is that it further democratizes access to liquid staking for those who do not want to pay or cannot afford to pay mainnet fees,\u201d said Lido\u2019s head of business development and partnerships Jacob Blish. \u201cBy incentivizing great wstETH liquidity on Optimism, furthering adoption and contributing to the security of the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThus, users interested in scooping up this extra OP yield can do so if they turn to what Lido has called \u201cpriority pairs,\u201d namely wstETH-ETH as well as a host of other stablecoin pools.\n\nLido has named Aave, for example, as one project that would benefit from the program. This means that users that deposit their wstETH on the popular DeFi lender via Optimism can earn an additional yield in OP tokens."

        "content": "Ethereum-based investment fund platform, ICONOMI, has set a record by raising the 11th largest crowdsale in history through its Initial Coin Offering (ICO), which was completed last month.\n\nIn September, the Slovenian-based company announced that it had raised more than $8.9 million in operational capital and equity through an ICO, raising $3 million in the last three days. The first funds were presented at Ethereum\u2019s Devcon2 last month in Shanghai.\n\nHowever, this latest news from the company shows that it managed to raise $10,576,227 from nearly 4,000 investors worldwide. This makes it the 11th largest raise in crowdsale history for any category and takes third place as the largest FinTech crowdsale, behind The DAO and Ethereum. Investors can expect to receive their ICN tokens, which function as shares, on October 9.\n\nChanging the Face of Fund Management\n\nThrough the ICONOMI platform, users will have the option to develop their own managed baskets of digital currencies, which can then be invested in by other users around the world.\n\nIt is through this approach that ICONOMI is aiming to change what is currently in place by developing a disintermediated alternative to the multi-billion fund management industry.\n\nDuring the ICO five different currencies were accepted. There were three digital currencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Lisk, and two fiat currencies: U.S. dollars and Euros. In total, just over 6,900 Bitcoins were raised, under 200,000 Ethereum, under four million Lisk, more than $121,500, and less than \u20ac2.4 million were invested.\n\nPlans for the Future\n\nNow that the ICO has closed attention will turn toward how the money will be used in the future.\n\nThe company has announced that they will use the money to increase its development, which will include further hiring, investment in new office space, and the growth of two funds that were revealed during the ICO: ICONOMI.INDEX and ICONOMI.PERFORMANCE.\n\nJani Valijavec, co-founder of ICONOMI, said that the company has a tight timeline to follow as the company focuses on expanding the two funds.\n\nHe said:\n\nICONOMI.INDEX is already up, but we are in the process of transforming the first major index of cryptocurrencies into a formal fund that investors can buy into. To achieve this, the vital functions of the fund management platform must be further developed.\n\nICONOMI\u2019S Funds\n\nWhile ICONOMI.INDEX is a managed fund intended to seek high yields, ICONOMI.PERFORMANCE is focused on looking for the best investments.\n\nTim Mitja Zagar, co-founder of ICONOMI, said that the team behind the fund has extraordinary track records.\n\nHe said:\n\nWe are hard at work conducting thorough research and due diligence on cryptos and have already identified promising investment targets.\n\nThe company is planning on investing all excess ICO proceeds above 10,000 bitcoins into the ICONOMI.PERFORMANCE fund. Through this individual investors will receive weekly dividends from the fund\u2019s management fees.\n\nZagar concluded by saying that ICONOMI\u2019s ICO has attracted more investing interest in cryptocurrency.\n\nHe added:\n\nICONOMI\u2019s ICO has flung open the crowdfunding doors into perhaps the last remaining traditional realm of business: the financial sector. We expect more and more fintech startups to be capitalized by ICO instead of through guidance by banks, VCs and other money representing the old economy. With cryptoassets, we\u2019re reaching a tipping point that will revolutionize everything.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock."

        "title": "\u201cBlockchain is still an incredibly hot technology. We excised some cancers from the body and feel a lot better\u201d - CTech",
        "content": "The blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors have suffered their fair share of blows over the past year. Like every other tech sector, they paid a steep price for the dramatic shift in macroeconomic conditions. But in addition, they also dealt with both the financial and reputational damage caused by a series of extremely hyped collapses, headlined by the debacle at crypto exchange FTX, which is still unwinding in courts these days in bankruptcy hearings and the trial of former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nThe FTX saga came after nearly $2 trillion in value was wiped out from the crypto sector last year and a slump that eliminated key industry players such as Voyager Digital, Three Arrows Capital, and Israeli-founded Celsius Network.\n\nBlockchain and crypto have already been dismissed by many people as a tech fad of the past, but there are those that remain exuberantly positive about its outlook for the future. No one more than Joe Lubin, a co-founder of Ethereum, the decentralized open-source blockchain that dominates the smart contract sector, and the founder of ConsenSys, a Brooklyn-based blockchain technology company that develops decentralized software services and applications that operate on Ethereum.\n\n1 View gallery Joe Lubin. ( Zaza Weissgerber )\n\n\u201cThe internet followed the same trajectory as blockchain. Maybe it wasn't a hot technology in 2001/2002, but that doesn't mean there weren't a huge number of builders, just building out, enabling pieces in enabling layers,\u201d Lubin told CTech last week during his visit to Israel for ETHTLV 2023, a series of events in Tel Aviv aimed at builders in the Ethereum and crypto space. \u201cI think blockchain is an incredibly hot technology. Anybody in the industry thinks the same. I think that we excised some cancers from the body and I think we all feel a lot better about ourselves and a lot lighter. It may not be a hot technology for certain speculators right now, but go to an NFT conference and tell those people that it's not a hot technology.\u201d\n\nA few years ago, when ConsenSys was ConsenSys AG, a software-production studio, it invested in Israeli companies such as StarkWare. In February 2020, ConsenSys AG rebranded to Mesh and announced its plans to spin out ConsenSys Software Inc (now known as ConsenSys). ConsenSys works to build infrastructure, products, and services for the Ethereum ecosystem and other Web3 decentralized technologies. Their two flagship products are MetaMask, a self-custody web3 wallet and Infura, a developer platform. Mesh manages investments, incubated projects, R&D and accelerator activities. The investment in StarkWare has certainly paid off for Mesh to date, with the company that develops scalability and privacy solutions for blockchain technology raising $100 million at a valuation of $8 billion in a Series D round in May 2022.\n\n\u201cI'm not sure I need to point out that Israel is the Startup Nation and is extremely strong technologically,\u201d noted Lubin. \u201cIsrael is a hotbed of cryptographers and so is our ecosystem. The future of our ecosystem is essentially about zero knowledge and other cryptographic techniques.\u201d\n\nLast March, ConsenSys announced that its valuation had more than doubled to over $7 billion after raising $450 million in a funding round that included investments from SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Microsoft. However, macroeconomic changes still resulted in it announcing plans to cut 11% of its workforce, or 96 jobs, last month. Lubin nevertheless remains optimistic.\n\n\u201cIt's been pretty consistent for us most of the way through. There's certainly ups and downs in terms of the volume of interest in transactions, but the company is operating incredibly well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe've been astonished to read lots of things about our ecosystem, but they're related to things that we've been complaining about for a long time. It has really been mainly about macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. There has been a slowing in our ecosystem and we were affected by that. There was a further slowing in our ecosystem caused by a whole bunch of Centralized Finance (CeFi) companies which I now look back on as a self-limiting process. Basically, they did the same thing that so many companies in traditional finance have done in the past. There are some really corrupt projects and there are some bad projects, and then there's some good actors in CeFi. I'm happy to tolerate those as I think they're a valuable onboarding step, a valuable bridge between the legacy economy and our economy. But essentially it's the same old stuff but applied to a new vulnerable space.\u201d\n\nLubin insists that last year\u2019s crash and the fall of FTX will ultimately prove to be a positive for the industry. \u201cWe have the privilege, and the joy, and the difficulty in trying to build a new web and a new decentralized global economy on live monetary rails which has never been done before. That's hard and that makes things vulnerable. And what ended up happening was in my opinion actually really great for our ecosystem,\u201d he said. \u201cSam [Bankman-Fried] and leaders of some other companies did things that weren't intentional, but ultimately ended up having a positive effect on pointing out in very stark contrast the difference between CeFi mechanisms and DeFi mechanisms.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nLubin believes that the untangling of the FTX mess, which is being done on an open database, can be presented to regulators and politicians as an example of the sector\u2019s mechanisms of transparency and decentralization. \u201cIt's incumbent on us to help leaders of government and regulators and corporations to understand the benefits of our technology, and the weaknesses of that technology. I think it's going to be great going forward.\u201d\n\nAs far as the reputational hit suffered by a sector that for many people was already mainly associated with scams, Lubin has little concern. \u201cThere's always been a trust gap because it's such a complicated technology. So I'm not really worried about where we are. I think we're in a great position. We see waves of innovation and the waves of innovation bring in software developers and they bring in speculators and they bring in new kinds of consumers, like those who are interested in NFTs. The software developers, the builders, stay in our ecosystem. The speculators go crazy. There's a blow-off top. They run away for a little while, and that's fine. They'll be back because they're speculators. We just keep building and each new wave of innovation is bigger than the last one.\u201d\n\nMaking parallels between the rise and adoption of the internet compared to blockchain and crypto is not as popular as it once used to be, but Lubin believes it remains as relevant as ever."

        "content": "Monad Labs, the team supporting the Monad blockchain, has raised $19 million in seed funding led by Dragonfly Capital, it exclusively told TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cMonad is an effort to fundamentally optimize smart contract platforms,\u201d Keone Hon, co-founder and CEO of Monad Labs, said to TechCrunch. \u201cWe\u2019re ultimately building a platform to optimize both consensus and execution [\u2026] which ultimately results in a system that can process a billion transactions per day and 10,000 transactions per second.\u201d\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible layer-1 smart contract platform was co-founded by Hon, Eunice Giarta and James Hunsaker in 2022 to expand throughput on the Ethereum blockchain. The team brings more than seven years of experience in building low-latency, high-frequency trading (HFT) systems at Jump Trading.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, we\u2019re building a platform, so our main clients expand across the board. In some ways you can think of us as pseudonymous with iOS and what the iPhone can provide,\u201d Giarta said. \u201cWe\u2019re allowing devs to build applications like the App Store.\u201d\n\nWhile the platform is not publicly available, it will enter a testnet phase in the coming months with a mainnet launch later this year, it said.\n\nThe round included 70 participants, including Placeholder Capital, Lemniscap, Shima Capital and Finality Capital, as well as angel investors like AngelList co-founder Naval Ravikant. \u201cWe found that building a really broad coalition of supporters has helped us a lot in our journey,\u201d Hon said.\n\nThe capital will be used to double the team to about 24 in the next several months, Giarta said.\n\n\u201cUltimately the problem of limited throughput and high fees are acute challenges in the Ethereum ecosystem,\u201d Hon said. \u201cWe found a number of leaders in the space who want to tackle the problem head-on with fundamental improvements to the overall system in order to build the most optimized system possible.\u201d\n\nIn general and in the crypto space, people assume Ethereum can\u2019t be performant, Hunsaker noted. But Monad aims to focus on performance and fix that problem, he added.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have better performance, you can\u2019t scale to everyday users,\u201d Hunsaker said. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking forward. Apps on blockchains so far have been simple, so to build more complex apps and add natural value they\u2019re going to have to be more complex. We have features planned to expand what blockchain can do, but our primary focus right now is performance because without that, you don\u2019t have anything that\u2019s usable on a wide scale.\u201d\n\nOther blockchains that advertise high performance have \u201cabandoned the Ethereum space and existing chains that are EVM compatible didn\u2019t innovate, but mainly just used what was available to build out their blockchain,\u201d Hunsaker added. \u201cSo we\u2019re re-building the EVM for high performance and trying to stay within the Ethereum ecosystem because we think that\u2019s where most of the innovation has happened and will continue to happen.\u201d\n\nEven though the current market for crypto, and tech in general, has been \u201cchallenging,\u201d the team is focused on improving the Ethereum space, Hon shared. \u201cUltimately we want to grow a vibrant ecosystem of app developers and users. From our perspective, the future is bright.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin added NFT support, and now it has a Bored Ape on the network after Bored Ape #1626 was burned on Ethereum and transferred it to Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin recently added NFT support, and now it has a Bored Ape on the network too. The owner of Bored Ape #1626 \"burned\" his NFT on Ethereum and transferred it to the Bitcoin network using a new protocol called Teleburn, which allows NFTs to be burned on one blockchain and inserted into Bitcoin as Ordinals\u2013Bitcoin's new version of an NFT.\n\nThe Bored Ape was originally purchased for 108 ETH (~$430k at the time of purchase) and was worth about $170k when it was burned. Now its value is hard to place, since it's the first Bored Ape NFT on Bitcoin, there's no major exchange for Bitcoin NFTs, and it's not clear if Bitcoin investors even care about NFTs.\n\nThe Teleburn function allows users to send an NFT to an address on a different blockchain by burning it on the original blockchain and minting it on the new blockchain with the same metadata and owner information. But the NFT still technically exists on the old blockchain too, so I don't really see the point.\n\nYou can't \"burn\" an on-chain asset\u2013that's the whole point of the blockchain. Instead, the process of burning is simply sending the NFT to a \"burn\" address that no one controls. You can still see Bored Ape #1626 on Ethereum, but its old owner can't do anything with it anymore.\n\nAs you may remember, Bored Ape holders also hold the intellectual property rights to their Ape's appearance. Seth Green starred in a TV show using his Ape, and other investors have used their Apes to sell merchandise and even fast food. According to Bored Ape parent company Yuga Labs, once you move your ape to a burn address, you lose the rights to the Ape.\n\nSo now Bored Ape #1626 is just... gone? Sure it's on Bitcoin, which has massive liquidity, but there isn't much liquidity for NFTs on Bitcoin yet. Also, Bitcoin is a terrible blockchain for NFTs anyway. Bitcoin is slow, and it's not made to store smart contract data on-chain. Add in that Bitcoin holders are basically gold hoarders with computer skills and there's some serious resistance to mainstream Bitcoin NFT adoption."

        "content": "The long-awaited scaling upgrade from Ethereum layer-2 solution provider Polygon (MATIC) has been announced, with the beta launch of its zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) mainnet slated for March 27.\n\nIn a Feb. 14 blog post, Polygon said that after three and a half months of \u201cbattle testing,\u201d the system will be ready for the mainnet launch next month.\n\nRoses are red\n\nViolets are blue\n\nPoems are hard\n\nMainnet Beta is here\n\n\n\nON MARCH 27, Polygon #zkEVM launches the future of Ethereum scaling\n\n\n\nhttps://t.co/OqSOYTn8Uv pic.twitter.com/kpXavea3ff \u2014 Polygon (@0xPolygon) February 14, 2023\n\nIt's been touted as \u201cseamless scaling for Ethereum,\u201d and was launched as a testnet in December last year.\n\nThe development of the zk-rollup scaling technology has been ongoing for the past three years. During that time, the Polygon zkEVM system has hit several milestones noted by the team.\n\nThese include the deployment of more than 5,000 smart contracts, the generation of over 75,000 zk-proofs, more than 84,000 wallets and two public third-party audits.\n\nA graphic detailing the development so far leading up to the launch. Source: Polygon\n\nThe team noted that security is the highest priority and that\u2019s the reason \u201cwhy Polygon zkEVM has been run through a gauntlet of tests and audits.\u201d\n\nThe technology uses zero-knowledge proofs \u2014 cryptographic confirmations that, in the context of scaling, enable platforms to validate mass amounts of transaction data before bundling and confirming them on Ethereum.\n\nPolygon is not the only team working on a zkEVM solution. Scaling provider zkSync is developing similar EVM technology with its zkPorter \u2014 which puts essential transaction data off-chain.\n\nScroll, another scaling solutions provider, is also building a zkEVM solution in collaboration with the Privacy and Scaling Explorations group, part of the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation is also funding a project called Applied ZKP, which aims to develop an EVM-compatible zk-rollup.\n\nRelated: Polygon tests zero-knowledge rollups, mainnet integration inbound\n\nThe team explained the significance of the technology, stating that true EVM-equivalence means Ethereum can be scaled \u201cwithout resorting to half-measures.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe best way to scale Ethereum is to preserve the existing Ethereum ecosystem: code, tooling, and infrastructure needs to just work. And that\u2019s what Polygon zkEVM is aiming to achieve.\u201d\n\nThe scaling tech also enables significant transaction cost savings. Proof costs for a large batch of hundreds of transactions are down to about $0.06 and less than $0.001 for a simple transfer, the team added.\n\nMatter Labs, the firm behind Polygon, raised $50 million in a Series B round led by Andreessen Horowitz to build EVM-compatible zk-Rollups in November 2021.\n\nPolygon\u2019s native token, MATIC, has reacted positively to the announcement with a 5.3% gain over the past 12 hours or so. As a result, the token was trading for $1.24 at the time of writing, according to Cointelegraph data."

        "content": "Eyebrows Raised as BAYC Owner Ditches Ethereum for Bitcoin\n\nEthereum might be the king when it comes to NFTs, but its reign seems under threat from an unlikely source. A few months ago, NFTs on the Bitcoin network were barely even a thing. However, since the launch of Ordinals, a project that allows individuals to inscribe/mint NFTs directly on Satoshis, things have become very interesting.\n\nLack of smart contracts and growing criticism from Bitcoin maximalists haven\u2019t stopped the Ordinals project from picking up. Three weeks after launch, the number of inscriptions is fast approaching 100,000. One of these is a valuable Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) #1626, which belongs to Jason Williams. It was bought for 108 ETH in November 2021, or $432,000 at the time.\n\nOver the weekend, Williams decided to burn his BAYC NFT and inscribe (mint) it on Bitcoin using TeleBurn. It\u2019s a newly developed feature that allows users to assign an existing asset from another network to Bitcoin while taking it out of circulation, thus transferring it between chains. Williams compares the act to \u201cthrowing a Lamborghini into a trash compactor,\u201d which is \u201ckind of fun.\u201d\n\nBAYC NFT Burn Has Raised Some Eyebrows\n\nHowever, the burn has attracted some criticism within the BAYC community, with some wondering if the NFT has indeed moved from Ethereum to Bitcoin. According to Greg Solano, Yuga Labs cofounder, by choosing to burn the NFT, Williams lost its license, consequently creating an illegitimate ape.\n\nIt\u2019s not \u201cgone from ETH forever.\u201d It\u2019s basically the same as any other transfer: If you transfer your ape to an address you no longer control (even if it\u2019s the \u2018burn\u2019 address), you have effectively given up your license.\n\nAnd no, before someone asks, that doesn\u2019t mean that anyone\u2026 https://t.co/E52b7ZjWbu \u2014 Garga.eth (Greg Solano) (@CryptoGarga) February 13, 2023\n\nIf creating an illegitimate ape devalues the NFT, then others beg to differ. Given that NFTs such as BAYC\u2019s derive value from being unique and rare, this being the first to be minted on Bitcoin places it in a class by itself.\n\nAlex Miller, the CEO of the Web3 development platform, believes this makes the NFT more valuable.\n\n\u201cHe basically turned it into something that is now an ultra-rare [Ape]. The market is going to value it as its own unique piece of art.\u201d\n\nWant more?

        "content": "Japan-based banking giant Nomura, announced today that its digital assets subsidiary, Laser Digital, has made a strategic investment in Infinity, a non-custodial interest rate protocol built on Ethereum.\n\nInfinity\u2019s wholesale exchange, the first of several planned infrastructures, provides inter-exchange clearing, fixed and floating rate markets, as well as enterprise-grade risk management utilizing hybrid on-chain/off-chain infrastructures that deliver transaction efficiency, security, and scalability.\n\nInfinity is a pioneering interest rate protocol that forms the basis for benchmark rates, institutional-grade lending, borrowing, and risk management in DeFi. The money market exchange protocol was founded by ex-Morgan Stanley Head of Structuring, Kevin Lepsoe.\n\n\u201cInfinity is building critical infrastructure for DeFi, and its protocol enabling price discovery and management of risk within DeFi is transformative for institutions, Infinity\u2019s groundwork paves the way for institutional flows on-chain, new levels of rates, and risk innovation, and we are keen to support their advances in the hybrid finance space.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Olivier Dang, Head of Ventures at Laser Digital\n\nLaser Digital was recently unveiled by Nomura to spearhead its digital asset ambitions and is chaired by Steve Ashley, who previously led Nomura\u2019s wholesale division, with Dr. Jez Mohideen as its CEO. Headquartered in Switzerland, Laser Digital\u2019s investments are focused on DeFi, centralized finance (CeFi), web3, and blockchain infrastructure.\n\nThe investment comes as the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) published guidelines for crypto exposures in December 2022, with bank-prescribed risk weightings for tokenized assets to be treated on par 1:1 with their analog counterparts. The guidelines for banks come into effect on 1 January 2025.\n\nWith USD $300 trillion of credit securities outstanding and multiples of that in the loan, derivative, and equity markets, the new guidelines portend a major wave of tokenization across financial and real assets.\n\nPresently in Beta, the Inifinity mainnet is scheduled to launch by the end of Q2 2023."

If the judge rules in Ripple\u2019s favor, they will probably see a massive return on their investment.\n\nAnd while both of these might be good long-term investment options, they are not eligible for any bigger returns in 2023.\n\nIf that\u2019s something that you are looking for, tokens that we will go over next have a much bigger potential of making your wallet fatter.\n\n>>>Get the Best Presale Token Now<<<\n\nMeta Masters Guild (MEMAG)\n\nMeta Masters Guild Is a new gaming crypto project that focuses on building a mobile-only gaming platform to provide users with a fun and immersive P2E experience.\n\nBy doing that, MEMAG is addressing one of the shortcomings of P2E \u2013 boring AAA games.\n\nA couple of games are already in their final stages \u2013 Meta Kart Racer, Meta Masters World, and NFT Raid.

Investors who invest in these projects can easily expect returns of up to 30x as soon as they hit the major exchanges.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "What is Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade? What's IN and Out - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade will enable validators and stakes to remove assets from the beacon chain.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe shanghai upgrade is gunning to bring some dramatic changes in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (POS) consensus mechanism. Apparently, stakers long awaited the upgrade. Besides its effect on staking, it is anticipated that there would be some visible ramifications on ETH\u2019s market demand. Therefore, understanding the upgrades that ETH is preparing for is more crucial than ever.\n\nIn this blog, we will decode Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade, every aspect related to it, and its future effects. So, let\u2019s begin.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nNext month, i.e., March 2023, is when the most awaited Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade will occur. Validators and stakes will be able to remove assets from the beacon chain thanks to the upcoming hard fork. In September of last year, Ethereum saw the most significant change in a decade. In it, Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism proof of work was switched to proof of stake. Users could participate in validation owing to the 2022 hard fork, and the staking limit was increased to 32 ether (ETH). This staking was now feasible without requiring challenging mining machinery challenges.\n\nUsers have yet to be able to withdraw their staked assets since the Merge, which combined the PoS Beacon Chain and the Ethereum mainnet. The Shanghai update (EIP-4895) fixes this problem and adds withdrawal capabilities. The launch date of this upgrade moved from January 05, 2023, to March 2023.\n\nThe users can test the update on a public test network once installed in Shanghai.\n\nFurthermore, the upgrade is subject to huge ramifications because staked Ether represents around 16 million coins or almost a sixth of the token\u2019s total supply. Over $26 billion is currently the market value of all staked Ethereum.\n\nWhat Is Staking in Ethereum?\n\nEthereum\u2019s move to POS enabled users to stake ETH as a part of the consensus mechanism. The energy-intensive PoW mining technique used on a network like Bitcoin has an alternative: PoS. Users can temporarily lock 32 ETH to run creator validator nodes, contributing to network security and transaction validation.\n\nOther validators send new blocks to each validator on the Ethereum network. After examining the transactions and block signature, the validator certifies that a block is valid. Stakeholders will now be able to withdraw their locked ETH thanks to the Shanghai update. Before the Beacon Chain\u2019s introduction in December 2020, this feature wasn\u2019t accessible.\n\nThe potential impact on ETH\u2019s price will be one of the top concerns for traders. According to Staking Rewards, 13.81% of all ETH coins are staked at the time of writing. Withdrawals are now permitted, which increases liquidity significantly and gives holders of staked ETH the ability to sell existing staked holdings. The proportion of tokens staked out of the total supply is something to keep an eye on for many buyers and sellers.\n\nSince the merge, which saw the Ethereum mainnet combine with the PoS Beacon Chain, users have yet to be able to remove their staked funds. The Shanghai update (EIP-4895) resolves the withdrawal functionality issue. As per the latest news, Ethereum developers have agreed to a March 2023 date for the upgradation of the network. Furthermore, the users will now get to test the upgrade with a public test network, most probably by the end of February 2023.\n\nHow will Ethereum Shangai Upgrade benefit the users?\n\nAlong with Ethereum Improvement Proposal-4895, or EIP-4895, the Shanghai upgrade\u2019s most significant change\u2014allows validators to withdraw staked tokens. Around 16 million ETH have been staked by validators to aid the mechanism\u2019s security. Since September 2022, when Merge started switching Ethereum\u2019s consensus method from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, validators have been particularly important to the Ethereum network. Following the Merge, validators can stake 32 ETH in the chain to be eligible to participate in validating blocks. Each ETH staked increases a validator\u2019s chance of obtaining block rewards.\n\nHowever, its increased liquidity makes staking on ETH more appealing to users. The opportunity to stake ETH directly with Ethereum is now available to anyone who wants to refrain from employing liquid staking mechanisms. The better staking circumstances may result in a demand for ETH.\n\nThe price of users\u2019 native tokens held on liquid staking platforms can also change. The justification is that Ethereum eliminates the exceptional functionality that liquid ETH staking provides by allowing withdrawals.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe upgrade has opened an essential feature for Ethereum stakers or those considering staking is enabled by the Shanghai update. With this merger, those anxiously awaiting a fully operational Proof of Stake system can smile. Anyone with access to ETH would benefit from understanding the upgrade and what it offers, even though its possible impacts on the market remain unpredictable."

But data shows that Blur has far fewer active traders and transactions than OpenSea over the past week, despite posting more overall trading volume.\n\nData from analytics platform Dune suggests that about 13% of Blur trades are classified as suspected wash trading, compared to about 2% for OpenSea.\n\nWe\u2019ll see whether Blur\u2019s surging momentum in recent months continues after users stop trading with airdrop incentives in mind. Notable crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Huobi have already announced plans to support the BLUR token once it starts trading today.\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to reflect the changed airdrop timing."

        "title": "Polygon ecosystem development and upcoming zkEVM launch add to MATIC's bullish momentum - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Polygon Labs, the development and growth team for Polygon, announced that the beta version of its zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) would launch on March 27, 2023. It\u2019s possible that Polygon will enjoy a first-mover advantage in this space by launching a public mainnet before zkSync and Scroll.\n\nZk-based roll-up technology is accepted as the gold standard for scaling. The existing optimistic-based rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism have EVM capability but are less secure because they are \u201cfraud-proof.\u201d Malicious transactions on an Optimistic Rollup can stay valid for up to seven days or more before being reversed. Thus, giving an advantage to zk-technology.\n\nMoreover, the Ethereum community\u2019s focus on Liquid Staking Derivatives may shift toward layer-2 networks after the anticipated Shanghai upgrade in March. This is because the update following Shanghai, Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844, will reduce the cost of L2 rollups by 10\u2013100-fold. A working zk-based rollup solution will likely attract new projects to its ecosystem.\n\nPolygon (MATIC) has built a strong bullish narrative in the market with the upcoming zkEVM launch. The team\u2019s efforts in the Web3 space are promising and show signs of increasing activity. The growth in its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem has stalled, which could likely stay this way for more extended periods.\n\nTechnically, the market structure for Polygon looks bullish. However, the recent 78% increase in MATIC\u2019s price since the start of 2023 could see a correction as speculative buying cools down. Such a situation could possibly provide an ideal entry in MATIC for a swing trade.\n\nPolygon\u2019s DeFi sector has stalled, but Web3 activity is on the rise\n\nSince the start of 2023, Polygon has witnessed a spike in its nonfungible token (NFT) activity, especially for low-cost gaming assets. According to data from Dune Analytics, the number of NFT sales on Polygon surpassed Ethereum for two consecutive months in December 2022 and January 2023. While Ethereum still leads in total volumes, Nansen\u2019s NFT activity data shows that the minting and sale volume on Polygon has been picking up since the start of 2023.\n\nThe volume of NFT sales and mints on Polygon. Source: Nansen\n\nMeta also chose Polygon as the base layer for minting digital collectibles on its social media app Instagram. This feature is currently in the limited testing phase but should see traction soon among the 1.28 billion Instagram users.\n\nIn November 2022, Matter Labs appointed the former gaming head of YouTube, Ryan Watt, to lead its gaming venture, Polygon Studios. Watt told Cointelegraph that Polygon\u2019s Web3 strategy takes a holistic approach by incorporating \u201cWeb2 companies, including Starbucks, Adobe, Clinique and Stripe, to integrate Web3 functionality.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the blockchain houses the development of over 60 metaverse projects, including the leaders in The Sandbox, Decentraland and Somnium Space. Lastly, Polygon\u2019s $450-million raise in February 2022 will likely provide the necessary tailwinds to continue development on the Web3 front.\n\nOn the other hand, the Ethereum sidechain\u2019s growth in its DeFi sector has stalled. It could remain stressed due to the ongoing macroeconomic pressure and a regulatory crackdown on stablecoins.\n\nThe total liquidity across DeFi applications on Polygon has stayed below November 2022 levels, suggesting that users are still reluctant to interact with these protocols. Besides security risks, the decreasing yield across the DeFi space is also a prominent reason for the decline in activity.\n\nTotal liquidity across DeFi applications on Polygon. Source: DefiLlama\n\nIn comparison, Arbitrum\u2019s DeFi ecosystem has fared relatively better than most thanks to the anticipation around its token airdrop and active development.\n\nStill, Polygon ranks fifth in total liquidity across DeFi platforms above Avalanche, Solana, Optimism and Fantom, which is encouraging. Favorable liquidity conditions are a crucial necessity for a prospering DeFi ecosystem, and Polygon can benefit from it when focus on DeFi picks up. Moreover, the launch of zkEVM may also attract DeFi development.\n\nInvestors are bullish on MATIC\n\nFutures market data shows traders are bullish on MATIC, with an increase in open interest volume toward 2022 highs and a long-to-short ratio of 1.58. While a bullish outlook is encouraging, the prices may pull back to wipe out overleveraged positions.\n\nOpen interest volume for MATIC futures contracts. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe on-chain balance on exchanges suggests that not many investors moved their coins onto exchanges as the price surged from $0.75 to $1.25. It suggests confidence among buyers, who are unlikely to sell unless the price falls below $0.75 support.\n\nPolygon balance on exchanges. Source: glassnode\n\nRelated: Solana (SOL) price rally could fizzle out due to weak fundamentals\n\nHowever, the price could pull back toward the $1 support level as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) metric begins to tap resistance around the 65 level. The bullish momentum likely requires consolidation around the 50 RSI level before more upside.\n\nMATIC/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe organic development of Polgyon\u2019s NFT trading activity and bullish narrative building around zkEVM will likely continue to push MATIC\u2019s price higher in 2023. Needless to say, a lot will depend on the price action of market leaders in Bitcoin (BTC) and whether Ether (ETH) maintains its uptrend.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Bitcoin NFTs are growing quickly as community sees long-term potential - TechCrunch",
        "content": "Ordinals, an NFT-like project on the Bitcoin blockchain, has gained momentum over the past month, signaling a chance that a new frontier may be on the horizon for the biggest cryptocurrency. But in order to be the biggest, experts say its accessibility and security need to be improved.\n\nOver 90,000 Ordinals have been inscribed \u2014 which is jargon for created (or minted) \u2014 on the Bitcoin blockchain to date, according to Dune Analytics data. Ordinals hit an all-time high on February 9 for the number of mints at over 20,000 that day.\n\n\u201cIt seems foolish to say this won\u2019t be a very impactful revelation,\u201d Nick Hansen, CEO and co-founder of Luxor, told TechCrunch. \u201cI can\u2019t predict the future, but given current trends and hockey stick growth, we\u2019re definitely headed to more Bitcoin NFT inscriptions now than fewer.\u201d\n\nThe Ordinals project isn\u2019t the first to try bringing NFTs onto the Bitcoin blockchain. Counterparty was the first platform to inscribe NFTs on Bitcoin\u2019s network with the Rare Pepe collection in 2014. Although Rare Pepe didn\u2019t do much to boost mass demand, one of its NFTs from 2016 sold for $3.6 million at a Sotheby\u2019s auction about a year ago.\n\nOrdinals stands out as a project for directly inscribing onto satoshis, the smallest denomination of bitcoin (equivalent to 100 millionth of a bitcoin), without needing another chain or token. \u201cThe unique thing about Ordinals is its putting the image literally in the blockchain,\u201d Muneeb Ali, co-founder of Stacks and CEO of Trust Machines, said. \u201cOther NFTs usually link to the images on-chain.\u201d\n\nEven though Ordinals and Bitcoin NFTs in general are exploding, it\u2019s still in very early stages, especially when compared to behemoths like Ethereum and Solana.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clunky because it\u2019s day one,\u201d said Alex Adelman, the co-founder and CEO of Bitcoin rewards platform Lolli. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Wild West, but that\u2019s how NFTs felt back in the day, as well with Ethereum.\u201d\n\nEthereum and Solana now have a huge leg up when it comes to infrastructure, communities, and trading platforms and collections. In the past 30 days, Ethereum, the No. 1 blockchain by NFT sales volume, saw volumes increase 35.5% to $860 million across over 178,000 buyers, according to CryptoSlam data. Solana, the second-largest blockchain by NFT sales volume, fell 15.6% to $114.6 million across over 80,000 buyers during the same time period.\n\n\u201cEthereum has proven there\u2019s a market for this already and is essentially stealing market share based on demand,\u201d Adelman said.\n\nSo, inherently Bitcoin NFTs will compete with other major NFT ecosystems, Hansen said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll most likely see a lot of Ethereum NFT projects building bridges to move to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWhen people build on Bitcoin, it gets a lot more attention, Ali said. \u201cSome people think it\u2019s more valuable than other chains because it\u2019s unclear if those other chains will be around, but bitcoin will likely be around in 10, 20 or 50 years from now.\u201d\n\nBut this expansion won\u2019t happen overnight, and the current infrastructure for Bitcoin NFTs is extremely clunky and still done manually on many fronts. For example, many people are legitimately completing inscriptions manually rather than through a service like an NFT marketplace.\n\n\u201cBuys are happening through Discords and Google Sheets,\u201d Adelman said. \u201cMarketplaces are very much needed; we can\u2019t be buying and selling on Google Sheets for much longer because there\u2019s going to be hacks, people will get pissed off and it won\u2019t be sustainable.\u201d\n\nLast week Gamma, a marketplace for Bitcoin NFTs, launched its Ordinals feature to help people who have a Bitcoin address inscribe their own NFTs. \u201cWe had over 2,000 people submitting inscriptions in the first two hours,\u201d Jamil Dhanani, founder and CEO of Gamma, told TechCrunch. \u201cThis is an indication something is here and we\u2019re not sure it\u2019s going to be the same as Ethereum NFTs, but the value of inscribing data resonates with people.\u201d\n\nAccessibility is the \u201cnorth star for all of this right now,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cHow do we get a wallet and see our JPEGs? Right now there\u2019s no way to get around it, all of it is really difficult, and custodying it has been hard. The bar is incredibly high right now.\u201d\n\nAdelman agreed, noting \u201cit\u2019s not accessible at all.\u201d But in 2017, there weren\u2019t very many experiences that were accessible in the Ethereum ecosystem, either, he said.\n\n\u201cThere will be services to improve all of this and the access,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cAs the products and services come to market, it will become more and more prevalent the amount of inscriptions being minted, inscribed and transacted.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithin a year, we\u2019ll have full ecosystems of plug-and-play NFT projects like on Ethereum would be my guess,\u201d he added\n\nAnd more capital and developers will surely enter the space. \u201cMy inbox is overflowing with developers on Ethereum and Solana who don\u2019t know how to build on Bitcoin. The developer community in Bitcoin is getting real demand now, and people are throwing money at it,\u201d Ali said. \u201cThat\u2019s exciting and a healthy thing [ \u2026 ] people realize bitcoin carries a premium, but a ton of work needs to be done.\u201d\n\nOver time, there will be \u201cmuch more use of bitcoin and a much more robust market,\u201d Dhanani said.\n\n\u201cIf Bitcoin wants to stay the most decentralized, widespread and prolific cryptocurrency, it needs something like [Bitcoin NFTs] to push it forward,\u201d Adelman said."

        "title": "How crypto staking connects to financial censorship - Axios",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has been valorized in the crypto world recently because of its loss to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over the issue of \"staking.\" Why it matters: Who may and may not participate in staking \u2014 the process of checking transactions on various cryptocurrency networks \u2014 will have implications for another point of tension between blockchains and nation-states: international sanctions.\n\nFlashback: Last year, the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) put a sanction on the collection of smart contracts known as Tornado Cash.\n\nTornado Cash makes it hard to connect the sender and recipient of a transaction. It masks them in a large pool of transactions that all pass through one neutral smart contract.\n\nBecause it was frequently used by criminals and hostile nation-states, OFAC forbid anyone in the U.S. and any U.S. citizen from transacting through Tornado Cash.\n\nHow it works: Blockchains use a \"consensus mechanism\" to insure that all transactions on a blockchain are valid. The most popular mechanism is \"proof of stake,\" where validators post valuable cryptoassets as insurance against their own misuse of the network.\n\nProof-of-stake created an opportunity for investors of any size to participate in consensus, by contributing their assets to the stake of validators they trust.\n\nThat way, they could grow their holdings by sharing in rewards, compensation for a faithful validation of transactions.\n\nLast fall, Ethereum became a proof-of-stake blockchain. When it did so, many cryptocurrency exchanges (including Kraken) began creating avenues for their users to participate in proof-of-stake on Ethereum, the world's second biggest blockchain by value.\n\nThe big picture: According to MEVWatch, a site that tracks block censorship on Ethereum, Coinbase and Kraken both readily comply with OFAC sanctions, skipping any blocks that touch Tornado Cash or eyebrow raising Ethereum addresses.\n\nIt would not be feasible for large U.S. companies predicated on connections with the banking system to function without complying with OFAC.\n\nYes, but: Kraken agreed last week to shut its program down, because the SEC said the product was an unregistered security (this follows its own prior run in with sanctions rules). Coinbase has vowed to fight if it's asked to do shut down its own staking offering.\n\nThe intrigue: Other validators, with less surface area for U.S. regulators to grip, do not censor, or do so less.\n\nOther crypto exchanges, such as Binance, Bitmex and OKX also frequently post censored blocks.\n\nWhat they're saying: \"We shouldn\u2019t be too quick to celebrate, as a heavy-handed SEC crackdown could have much bigger consequences for the blockchain sector,\" Lachlan Feeney, Founder and CEO of Labrys, an Australian blockchain consultancy that made MEVWatch, said in a statement via a spokesperson.\n\nBy Labrys' reckoning, Kraken proposes about 4% of Ethereum's daily blocks.\n\nThe other side: \"The censorship concerns are a bit overblown at this point,\" Dragonfly Capital's Tom Schmidt tells Axios. \"OFAC-related transactions can still be mined in less than a minute by other validators.\"\n\nWhat we're watching: The proportion of validators that ignore U.S. sanction guidances as the SEC runs cryptocurrency exchanges and similar companies out of the staking business.\n\nBy the numbers: The proportion of blocks that censor transactions has been dropping, according to MEVWatch, but it remains around 50%.\n\nIt hit 79% in November.\n\nBe smart: Validators aren't ideological. If the most lucrative channel for picking up transactions censors them, they are going to pick up that channel.\n\nAs long as a few validators don't censor, all transactions can still get through. So, OFAC-compliant validators don't actually end up truly censoring the transactions, but it does add friction.\n\nOur thought bubble: Cryptocurrency was created to be borderless money for the internet. Borderless means global, but it also means politically neutral."

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nEthereum Layer-2 scaling solution provider Polygon has picked the 27th of March, 2023, as the date when its zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) beta launch will go live.\n\nWith the launch date set, Polygon has stated that it would release more details about the zkEVM beta network over the next few weeks.\n\nLaunch Date Confirmed\n\nLayer-2 Ethereum scaling solution Polygon has finally announced the launch date of its long-awaited Ethereum Virtual Machine rollup technology. Polygon has stated that the beta launch of its zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) has been set for the 27th of March, 2023. Polygon took to Twitter to announce the launch from its official Twitter handle, stating that after over three months of \u201cbattle testing,\u201d the system is finally ready for its mainnet beta launch.\n\n\u201cRoses are red, Violets are blue, Poems are hard Mainnet Beta is here ON THE 27TH OF MARCH, Polygon #zkEVM launches the future of Ethereum scaling.\u201d\n\nWhile the protocol has not specified what the beta network will include, it did share that the Polygon team will release more details regarding the launch and the zkEVM beta network in the coming few weeks leading up to the launch date. It also added that the security of the network would be given the highest priority. Polygon\u2019a new zkEVM network has been hailed for bringing \u201cseamless scaling for Ethereum\u201d and saw its testnet launch in December.\n\nSecurity The Highest Priority\n\nThe Polygon team stated that it has given security the highest priority, which is why the new Polygon zkEVM has gone through a \u201cgauntlet of tests and audits.\u201d Zero Knowledge technology is widely considered as a significant improvement for blockchains and cryptography, increasing the speed of transactions and greatly reducing their cost. ZKevms are a type of ZK rollups that can process transactions on a separate Layer-2 and then send the transaction data back to the primary mainnet blockchain.\n\nPolygon\u2019s zkEVM testnet, which deploys the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for its ZK rollup, went live in October, enabling developers on Ethereum to move their smart contracts from the main blockchain without any major reprogramming required. Since the launch of the testnet, over 75,000 ZK proofs have been generated, with over 5000 smart contracts already deployed. Mihailo Bjelic, the co-founder of Polygon, also revealed that the team is looking at ways to bring the ZK-technology to the Polygon POS chain. Sandeep Nailwal, Polygon co-founder, stated,\n\n\u201cPolygon zkEVM Mainnet is set to be the first fully EVM equivalent ZK rollup to reach mainnet. This represents a huge step towards scaling Ethereum and bringing Web3 to the masses.\u201d\n\nNot The Only Ones Working On zkEVM\n\nPolygon is far from the only team that is working on creating a viable zkEVM solution. zkSync, a scaling provider, is also working to create and develop a similar EVM technology with zkPorter, which takes transaction data off-chain. Another scaling solution provider, Scroll, is looking to create a zkEVM solution through a collaboration with the Privacy and Scaling Explorations Group, which is a part of the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nFurthermore, the Ethereum Foundation is also funding a project titled Applied ZKP. Applied ZKP is looking to develop an EVM-compatible zk-rollup. Explaining the significance behind the technology, the team stated that true EVM equivalence means Ethereum can successfully be scaled without half measures.\n\n\u201cThe best way to scale Ethereum is to preserve the existing Ethereum ecosystem: code, tooling, and infrastructure needs to just work. And that\u2019s what Polygon zkEVM is aiming to achieve.\u201d\n\nThe technology also helps to enable significant savings when it comes to transaction costs, with proof costs for large batches of transactions being brought down to around $0.06, with simple transactions costing as less as $0.001. Meanwhile, MATIC, Polygon\u2019s native token, had a positive reaction to the news and is currently up by over 5.50%.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "title": "NFT Traders Flex Their Blur Airdrops: Here\u2019s Who Got the Most Tokens - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nRising NFT marketplace Blur held its anticipated BLUR token airdrop this afternoon, and some of the top traders snagged more than $1 million worth of tokens at the current value. In fact, the top trader snagged more than $1.9 million worth of the Ethereum-based governance tokens.\n\nAccording to public blockchain data curated by Dune, the top claimant in the BLUR airdrop took home over 3.2 million BLUR tokens, valued at about $1.93 million based on the current price of about $0.60 per token via CoinGecko.\n\nIt\u2019s not immediately clear who holds the Ethereum wallet that claimed that enormous stash of tokens, but it\u2019s a relatively new wallet created less than three months ago. It has also been incredibly active in the NFT space, trading massive sums of Mutant Ape Yacht Club and Otherside NFTs in recent days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA look at the trading activity from the wallet shows that the holder has been buying and selling loads of the same NFTs over and over again, suggesting wash trading or at least a coordinated effort to game the Blur trading model. The sale prices aren\u2019t high enough to raise suspicion, but the assets are being flipped at such frequency to generate enormous trading volume.\n\nInterestingly, a look at the wallets of the second-highest claimant (2.97M BLUR, or $1.8 million) and third-highest claimant (2.5M BLUR, or $1.5 million) show numerous interactions with the top wallet, including back-and-forth batch sales of various NFTs via Blur.\n\nMoney printer go BLURRRRR. I just received 610658.739770709 $BLUR from @BLUR_io\u2019s Season 1 drop. Season 2 begins NOW. Start listing and bidding on Blur to get a head start on Season 2 rewards. pic.twitter.com/7Y3i6m8MMW \u2014 Keungz (@keung) February 14, 2023\n\nAgain, it points to either wash trading from one person or group across multiple wallets, or a coordinated effort. As with the top wallet, it\u2019s not immediately clear who owns these wallets\u2014but they\u2019re all intertwined in what appears to be a large-scale and successful attempt to manipulate the Blur airdrop, surely driving up Blur\u2019s marketplace trading volume in the process.\n\nOther top claimants in the Blur airdrop include well-known collectors and social media personalities, including the pseudonymous Machi Big Brother (almost 1.85 million BLUR, or $1.1 million worth), Keungz (610K BLUR, or $368,000 worth), and major Bored Ape Yacht Club trader Franklin (540K BLUR, or $326,000 worth).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlur offered up 360 million BLUR tokens through the airdrop, with that circulating supply giving the token a current market cap around $217 million. It\u2019s a relatively small chunk of the overall BLUR supply, however, which will apparently tally 3 billion BLUR once all tokens are released. Nearly 260 million of the airdropped tokens have been claimed so far, or about 72%.\n\nBLUR shot as high as $5.02 per token when it first hit the market today, but fell sharply. It\u2019s currently down 88% from that short-lived peak."

Polygon zkEVM has been passed through a gauntlet of tests and audits to fortify the network and future projects.\n\nAccording to the blog post, the Polygon zkEVM contains the EVM-equivalence standards. It refers to zkEVM which is as powerful as Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to expand the Ethereum ecosystem. This means developers can use the same code as Ethereum to build a project on Polygon zkEVM without any change.\n\nFurthermore, Polygon zkEVM offers cheap and fast operation while maintaining EVM-equivalence performance. Also, it gives an impressive throughput as it can deliver Proof times for a batch of hundreds of transactions in around two minutes.\n\n\u201cSecurity is the highest priority, which is why Polygon zkEVM has been run through a gauntlet of tests and audits,\u201d the company released a statement. \u201cUsers and devs can expect full transparency about the security measures that will protect the Ethereum community during Mainnet Beta.\u201d\n\nIn the upcoming weeks, Polygon Labs, a firm behind the Polygon network, will disclose more information about Mainnet Beta."

        "content": "Brain Armstrong speaks up following rumors that the U.S. SEC is targeting Crypto staking.\n\nCoinbase staking services fails to meet the Howey test elements.\n\nCoinbase exchange is not pleased with the SEC\u2019s rumored plans to go after cryptocurrency staking, and the exchange is making it crystal clear. Coinbase\u2019s head Brian Armstrog is reiterating that \u201cCoinbase\u2019s staking services are not securities. We will happily defend this in court if needed.\u201d\n\nCoinbase's staking services are not securities. We will happily defend this in court if needed.https://t.co/GtTOz77YV3 \u2014 Brian Armstrong \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@brian_armstrong) February 12, 2023\n\nThe exchange\u2019s CEO had told the market that SEC was out to crack down on crypto staking in the country, for retail customers. To him, that path would be a terrible one to take. Coinbase has updated its blog with new content explaining why its exchange\u2019s staking services are not securities.\n\nLong-term crypto companies have been migrating from proof of work to proof of stake, as it is a less energy-intensive protocol.\n\nCrypto users around the globe have been leaning more towards staking and its profits. Debates about proof of stake and how it is received on a regulatory level have been a long-term topic of discussion. If regulation is done wrong as Coinbase observed, it could endanger the PoS technology in the U.S. Coinbase observed in the post:\n\nAt Coinbase, we\u2019ve been committed to providing our users with a secure, compliant platform to access the cryptoeconomy since day one, and our staking products are not securities. But there are a lot of products in the market called staking and many of them work very differently. Today I\u2019ll focus on core staking services (protocol-based, on-chain staking), like the ones Coinbase offers, which are a vital aspect of crypto and blockchain technologies.\u201d\n\nCoinbase is defining its Crypto staking services before the SEC does\n\nCoinbase offers its main staking service through the Coinbase Earn program. With the program, users can stake selected assets for recurring payment from the blockchain protocol. Users are assured of a stake through products like Coinbase Wallet and Coinbase Cloud.\n\nCoinbase is claiming that its staking is not a security and that staking, in general, is not a security. Coinbase refers to the U.S. Securities Act and Howey test that is used by the SEC to determine what investment contract is or isn\u2019t a security.\n\nHowever, staking does not meet the four elements of the Howey test. The first element test is the investment of money and Coinbase maintains that staking does not constitute an investment of money.\n\nIn Coinbase\u2019s words, when customers ask Coinbase to stake their crypto, they don\u2019t give up anything in return. Customers retain their full ownership of their assets and rights to unstake.\n\nCoinbase also fails to meet the second element \u201ccommon enterprise\u201d because assets are staked in a decentralized network, Coinbase observed. Stakers are connected by blockchain and validate transactions through a user community and not a common enterprise.\n\nReasonable expectations of profits and the efforts of others are the last two elements of the howey test. Like the former, Coinbase staking services do not meet the test elements.\n\nCoinbase is trying to communicate that it is important for the SEC to get it right with staking and the regulation surrounding staking.\n\nThe purpose of securities law is to correct for imbalances in information. But there is no imbalance of information in staking, as all participants are connected on the blockchain and are able to validate transactions through a community of users with equal access to the same information..\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "title": "The Present and Future of Layer 2 Rollup - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "An Overview of Layer 2 Roll-ups\n\nOver the past few years, Layer 2 (L2) rollup solutions have come to the forefront as activity on the Ethereum network has grown. Activity and engagement with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has caused a surge in Layer 1 (L1) blockchain activity.\n\nIn turn, the demand for blockspace, represented by gas costs, has increased. And the time for transaction finality has risen due to the increased network load.\n\nWhilst the Ethereum Merge set the groundwork for future gas fee optimisations; it did not directly reduce transaction gas fees.\n\nIn the year between the summer of 2020 and the peak demand in the summer of 2021 gas cost in Gwei on the Ethereum network increased by up to 1300%. The need to make transactions fast and affordable spurred the creation of two primary forms of rollup: Optimistic and Zero-Knowledge (ZK).\n\nRollups help remove the computational demands on the Ethereum network by moving transaction processing off-chain, converting them into a single piece of data and then submitting back on Ethereum as a batch to reduce the associated cost and time.\n\nThe big difference between the two is that Optimistic roll-ups utilise fraud proofs, whereas ZK-rollups rely on zero-knowledge proofs to verify changes to the main chain.\n\nOptimistic and ZK-rollups: Fraud Proofs vs Validity Proofs\n\nFraud proofs bundle transactions off-chain and then repost them to the L1. After a bundle has been submitted on the L1 there is a challenge period, during which anyone can challenge the result of the rollup by computing a fraud proof.\n\nSimilarly, zero-knowledge proofs batch transactions off-chain and submit them as a single transaction. Where they differ is rather than assuming the transactions are correct initially, they use a validity proof to instantly prove whether the transactions are valid. Once the transactions have been confirmed as valid they are then submitted to the L1.\n\nThis is how they derive their respective names \u2013 fraud proofs are where the transactions are checked retrospectively to see if there are any fraudulent transactions, whereas validity proofs are completed before the transactions are submitted to the L1.\n\nWhilst there are prominent projects for both, they each come with their own respective benefits and drawbacks. Optimistic roll-ups have the advantage that fraud proofs are only required when there is an issue.\n\nThis means they require less computational resources and are able to scale well. The trouble lies with the challenge period. A longer challenge period increases the likelihood that any fraudulent transactions are identified, however it also means that users have to wait longer to withdraw their funds.\n\nFor leading optimistic rollup solutions, such as Arbitrum and Optimism, this waiting period can last up to a week. Alternatively, ZK-rollups have the advantage of always reflecting a correct L2 state. Their drawback is that proofs are required for all state transitions, rather than solely when they are contested, which limits scalability. This is further compounded by the complex nature and early stage of the technology.\n\nDespite their respective challenges, ZK-rollups are being heralded as the future for roll-ups. This is primarily due to the automatic generation of validity proofs increasing the security of the protocol, the significantly reduced time to withdraw due to there being no challenge period, and that ZK-rollups boast better data compression.\n\nFor these reasons we will hone in on the current state of the ZK-rollup space, the latest innovations and what lies ahead in the future.\n\nThe ZK-Rollup Space\n\nAs we\u2019ve discussed, ZK-rollups are predominantly in the focal point with players like zkSync, Starknet, Polygon zkEVM, and Scroll all raising large amounts of capital to develop their solutions despite only StarkNet having launched on mainnet ($780MM in total).\n\nEach of these projects have taken their own angle, differing primarily across their rollups data availability strategy and their proving algorithm. The data availability strategy determines where the state data of a roll-up is stored, on-chain storage has increased security but it uses up block space on the Ethereum network which reduces transaction throughput.\n\nThe proving algorithm is the means of generating a validity proof, which can either be STARK or SNARK.\n\nBoth of these algorithms help developers to relocate computation and storage off-chain, in turn increasing scalability. They are also able to verify whether a user has sufficient funds and the correct private key without having to access the information itself, thus improving the security.\n\nYou can read more about the technical differences here. STARKs have the advantage of offering more scalability, security and transparency compared to SNARKs.\n\nBut the drawback STARKS have is a larger proof size, which takes longer to verify, and that SNARKs comparatively only use 24% of the gas. Therein for both SNARKS and STARKS we have the tradeoff between speed and cost vs. scalability, security and transparency.\n\nWhilst many different methods are being explored there is not yet a definitive answer as to the best way to set up a ZK-rollup. Each configuration brings respective benefits and many developers are still exploring the optimal choice or combination for their rollup designs.\n\nThe Hurdles To Overcome\n\nAs we\u2019ve discussed, ZK-rollups are still in development and there are various challenges that need to be overcome before blockchain users are able to reap their full benefits.\n\nLanguage compatibility is one such challenge; translating EVM-friendly programming languages, such as Solidity, into a custom-built language specifically optimised for ZKP can help boost their efficiency, but it brings with it adoption challenges for developers.\n\nFor example, StarkNet is looking to solve this with Warp, a Solidity to Cairo (the language of StarkNet\u2019s ZKP) language compiler that looks to automatically convert Solidity into Cairo. Using Warp removes the need for developers to rewrite their code in Cairo, making it a much smoother process.\n\nOther challenges include the secretive nature of projects, with many going against the open source ethos of crypto due to concerns over first-mover advantage and capturing a sticky userbase. Most ZK-rollups were first launched this year, highlighting the amount of work that is yet to be done in the space.\n\nLastly, whilst rollups (both optimistic and zero-knowledge) have the benefits of improved speed and cost, it tends to be at the expense of decentralisation.\n\nThis is due to the inherent need for sequencers, the actors batching transactions and committing proofs to the L1.\n\nAll rollups currently need a centralised sequencer and use upgradeable smart contracts that are managed by a single entity. Because the space is still so early, a central focal point is typically required for quick fixes to bugs in the code. Add to that the projects aren\u2019t open sourced, creating another hurdle for community members to act as sequencers.\n\nMany projects have indicated that they plan to decentralize their sequencer functions in the future, but this will undoubtedly take additional resources and time.\n\nDecentralization Plans\n\nLaunching a token and open-sourcing code will be the next steps for many of the projects seeking decentralisation. Tokenisation of these services to generate activity and decentralise the product is another area where we expect to see a myriad of different solutions cropping up as projects look to create the most scalable, decentralised and active L2 on the market.\n\nStarkWare and zkSync are both planning to launch a token and Polygon could potentially use MATIC to support Polygon\u2019s zkEVM initiative. Token engineering on ZK-rollups is an even more nascent space than the optimistic rollup technology and finding an effective and sustainable model can differentiate and boost adoption.\n\nThe Future\n\nzkEVMs are still in their very early stages and the race is on to launch on mainnet. StarkNet has the first mover advantage but still has challenges with regards to supporting Solidity features due to the use of Cairo, leaving room for competitors to make improvements.\n\nThe projects that are able to amass significant user bases will attract dapp developers, in turn bringing more dApps to their platform and increasing the feature set. ConsenSys\u2019 zkEVM is currently moving to testnet and are focussing specifically on dapp developers for this reason, leveraging tools like MetaMask, Infura and Truffle so that they can deploy and manage applications as if they were directly using Ethereum.\n\nAnd whilst we have discussed the current players in the zkEVM market, other predominant rollup solutions like Polygon, Optimism and Arbitrum still command a significant market share.\n\nAs zkEVM solutions mature, we may see these projects look to transition to validity proofs or hybrid solutions, leveraging their existing user bases to attract dapp development and maintain their market dominance. In the end, the many rollup solutions (and the increased competition between them) will continue to improve the web3 user experience and introduce platforms for applications to onboard the next generation of users.\n\nGiven these threats, we\u2019re not surprised at the secrecy of projects in the space, but we believe the true winner will be able to leverage the efficiency of ZK-rollups and combine it with a seamless developer and user experience to come out on top."

        "content": "Kava announced the launch of Kava 12, which aims to make its KAVA token deflationary.\n\nNEW DELHI (CoinChapter.com) \u2014 DeFi lending platform Kava underwent its 12th major upgrade on Feb 15, which it deemed as a \u201cgame changer for the Cosmos Ecosystem,\u201d bringing the \u201cdeveloper power of Ethereum\u201d to its blockchain network.\n\nThe much-awaited upgrade went live after being delayed multiple times in January this year. In its announcement, Kava Labs claimed that the upgrade would help DAOs on \u201cany Cosmos chain\u201d exert better control over their expenses.\n\nKava claimed the latest upgrade would be a game-changer.\n\nMoreover, the upgrade would help track Cosmos chain emissions flow. Kava\u2019s announcement shared that the new DAO structure would help channel the emissions into initiatives.\n\nHighlights Of The Kava 12 Upgrade\n\nWith the new upgrade, Kava would introduce a mechanism to hold Cosmos emissions in community pools. Moreover, the Kava DAO community pool would include a portfolio of assets instead of only the native KAVA tokens.\n\nA community pool backed by a portfolio of assets would likely help Kava DAO withstand changing market direction. The reliance on only one or a few particular assets led to the downfall of several crypto firms in 2022, and it seems Kava developers were taking notes.\n\nAdditionally, the crypto market\u2019s downturn in 2022 highlighted the impact of the lack of transparency in the sector. Likely inspired by the FTX collapse and its impact, Kava Labs announced that the new upgrade would increase the transparency of the network.\n\nWith Kava 12, users would have permanent access to a snapshot of the community pool portfolio\u2019s value.\n\nKava outlined changes in its community pool inflation and staking rewards in the latest upgrade.\n\nMeanwhile, Kava 12 will mint tokens for staking rewards and the community pool. In the previous version, the community pool depended on an abstract tax on the staking rewards and fee pool through the Authorization module.\n\nHowever, the latest upgrade would mean the new module would feed the community pool. As a result, the community pool would become a function of inflation and the total token supply. The authorization module would directly send rewards to validators.\n\nIs KAVA Becoming Deflationary?\n\nOne aspect of the latest upgrade that traders are talking about is the Kava developers\u2019 claim of making the KAVA token deflationary.\n\nThe Kava 12 upgrade would cap the total supply per the DAO\u2019s guidelines. Furthermore, the developers claimed that KAVA would become \u201cultimately deflationary.\u201d\n\nIt is very important for a top crypto ecosystem to be deflationary against the revenues it generates from demand of the products built on it. [\u2026] Kava DAO\u2019s new architecture is a big step in the direction of providing tools for all cosmos projects to achieve these goals Scott Stuart, Founder Kava Labs, said\n\nThe upgrade announcement highlighted that the DeFi lending platform could cap the maximum supply of KAVA tokens. This is because deflationary tokens have a limited supply, which means their price increases with demand.\n\nAdditionally, the upgrade would help KAVA staking become independent of token supply. Finally, kava developers claim that improved staking APY would make rewards \u201cmore predictable for the community.\u201c"
