        "content": "As on-chain activity plummets, Ethereum\u2019s blockspace is on track to turn a financial loss for the first time since the Merge, according to Blockworks data.\n\nData from Blockworks Research\u2019s newly-launched Analytics product shows that Ethereum blockspace has consistently turned a profit since the network\u2019s switch to proof-of-stake consensus in September 2022.\n\nThe blockspace profitability metric is calculated by subtracting the total protocol fees paid to validators as well as ether (ETH) reward issuance from total transaction fees.\n\nSource: Blockworks Analytics\n\nFrom October 2022 to present, only in December 2022 did blockspace narrowly turn a loss, generating $3.5 million in losses \u2014 a fraction of the $414 million in gains the protocol has seen so far in 2023.\n\nHowever, as activity on Ethereum falls, September is shaping up to be the protocol\u2019s first month posting significant losses since proof-of-stake was introduced. Throughout September, Ethereum blockspace has posted only a single profitable day, and as of Monday, has accumulated $15.9 million in losses.\n\nThe shift in blockspace profitability coincides with an expansion in ETH\u2019s circulating supply, which is up roughly 8,900 ETH on the month, per data from ultrasound.money.\n\nThe declining profitability for blockspace is attributable to declining user activity and falling volumes across multiple on-chain subsectors. Swaps and transfers of popular stablecoins such as USDT and USDC are down as much as 90% from March 2023 highs, and NFT trading volumes in particular are continuing to dwindle.\n\nSource: Blockworks Analytics\n\nWhile activity on the base layer is shrinking with no clear catalyst to alter the trajectory, a number of Ethereum layer-2 networks are maintaining healthy activity.\n\nArbitrum and Optimism both maintain sequencer profitability, and while each has seen pullbacks in the number of active addresses on the networks, they remain close to yearly highs.\n\nSource: Blockworks Analytics\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum drops to a 14-month low versus Bitcoin.\n\nWhales and Vitalik Buterin send $60 million worth of ETH to exchanges.\n\nThe ETH/BTC ratio has recently decreased, continuing a pattern that started more than a year ago.\n\nNew on-chain study shows that Ether (ETH) is currently trading 27% below its value.\n\nAs major token holders, like Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, shifted their holdings to cryptocurrency exchanges, presumably as a prelude to selling, the Ether-to-Bitcoin ratio fell to a 14-month low.\n\nAccording to TradingView statistics , ETH-BTC fell as close to 0.0602 on Wednesday, its lowest value since July.\n\nThe second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had a recent price movement that continued a trend that started in September 2022 and supported some gloomy analyst predictions.\n\nPopular crypto analyst and founder of IntoTheCryptoverse, Benjamin Cowen, in an X post that there may be a breakdown in the value of ETH relative to BTC.\n\n\u201cA more significant move to the downside\u2026\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udcfahttps://t.co/iuq2iTBFaI pic.twitter.com/J1x7qgYDRJ \u2014 Into The Cryptoverse (@ITC_Crypto) September 19, 2023\n\nEthereum Whales On the Move\n\nThe most recent price drop happened when some well-known investors, or \u201cwhales,\u201d recently deposited a total of $60 million ETH to cryptocurrency exchanges, setting up fears about additional price drops.\n\nMarket watchers closely monitor whale on-chain moves, as they\u2019re seen as informed and influential. Deposits on an exchange signal potential selling, while withdrawals suggest accumulation.\n\nThe most recent move was made by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin who sent 300 ETH, or about $493,000, to Kraken, according to blockchain statistics compiled by security company PeckShield. Despite the deposit\u2019s modest size, it sparked curiosity among cryptocurrency observers due to Buterin\u2019s prominence for Ethereum.\n\nAnother significant investor recently made a total of 30,000 ETH deposits to the cryptocurrency exchanges Binance, OKX, and KuCoin, amounting to around $50 million, according to Lookonchain.\n\nLookonchain also noted that 6,000 ETH, or slightly under $10 million, were deposited to Kraken on Monday by a cryptocurrency wallet that had purchased tokens from Ethereum\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) nine years prior.\n\nEthereum Undervalued at $275 Billion Market Cap\n\nAccording to a recent analysis using a new version of Metcalfe\u2019s Law, the network value of Ethereum is north of $275 billion.\n\nIn its most recent analysis, RxR, a partnership between Re7 Capital and Republic Crypto, estimated that ETH is fairly valued at $275 billion. If some important elements are taken into account holistically, the analysis claims that the network is currently selling 27% below fair value.\n\nThe study used a new Metcalfe-centric model to reach its conclusion and pointed out that current models do not account for scale dynamics. RxR\u2019s models rely on data from the layer 2 networks of Ethereum, unlike conventional models that prioritise the quantity of active users on the network\u2019s mainnet.\n\nMetcalfe\u2019s rule posits that a network\u2019s financial worth precisely equals the square of its connected user count. However, with layer 2 activities incorporated into the model, it yields new findings.\n\nLewis Harland, an RxR analyst, explained that the \u201cEthereum\u2019s network valuation tracks the updated ML index better when the active user base of Ethereum\u2019s scaling networks is factored into the model than when omitted.\u201d\n\nThe research analyst stated that integrating L2 activities made long-term estimates more accurate. The experts emphasized that overlooking L2 and off-chain activity might create a misleading impression of the Ethereum network being overvalued.\n\nWith a market capitalization of $199 billion and a price of $1,655, Ethereum is currently displaying signs of a rally. Contrary to common belief, the market has not yet \u201cpriced in\u201d the levels of network adoption for Ethereum, according to RxR\u2019s blended model.\n\nHarland stated that Ethereum\u2019s user growth as an application platform will likely surpass that of simple value-transfer networks over time, implying higher relative valuations according to Metcalfe\u2019s law.\n\nThe Blooming L2 Ecosystem of Ethereum\n\nThe L2 area of Ethereum has seen a flurry of activity as numerous projects test out creative solutions to the network\u2019s scaling problems. With their innovative products, Arbitrum and Optimism are pushing the limits of Ethereum\u2019s scaling, and Coinbase\u2019s BASE is seeing extremely high adoption rates.\n\nGiven the reliance on rollups and other cutting-edge scaling techniques, aggregate total value locked (TVL) rose over $10 billion with over 30 L2 networks in use. Experts praised the increase in L2 activity for preventing single points of failure and significantly easing congestion."

        "title": "Better Buy: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Despite recent volatility in the crypto markets, Bitcoin (BTC -2.26%) and Ethereum (ETH -0.60%) remain two of the best-performing large-market-cap cryptos. For the year, Bitcoin is now up 65% while Ethereum is up 40%.\n\nBased on recent performance, Bitcoin would seem to be the obvious better buy. But just remember -- past performance is no guarantee of future performance. If you are a long-term investor, you need to keep your eye on future developments as well. With that in mind, there are three key factors that could determine which crypto is the better buy over the long haul.\n\nFlow of institutional money\n\nThe most important factor remains the flow of institutional money into the crypto asset class. Currently, Bitcoin appears to have a massive edge over Ethereum, with many institutional investors viewing it as a \"safe haven\" asset that can protect them from volatility in the broader market. We saw this scenario play itself out earlier this year, when a regional banking crisis in the U.S. immediately led to a flow of new money into Bitcoin, which in turn led to rapid price gains.\n\nMoreover, this entire summer seemed to be dominated by one single topic: the launch of the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF. This led to a mini-rally for Bitcoin in mid-June, as investors recalibrated what it could mean for institutional investor flows into crypto if the SEC finally signs off on a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHere, too, Bitcoin seems to have the edge over Ethereum, since there seems to be much more investor appetite for a spot Bitcoin ETF than a spot Ethereum ETF. As long as that remains the case, there will likely be more institutional money flowing into Bitcoin than Ethereum.\n\nUser adoption rates\n\nThe next major factor to keep in mind is user adoption rates. The big-picture view here is that, as both Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to go mainstream, they will both likely see a massive surge in their built-in user bases. So which blockchain is set to grow at a faster pace in coming years?\n\nFor Bitcoin, some of the best user adoption rate numbers come from Cathie Wood and Ark Invest, which released a research report this year with a set of scenarios to describe how Bitcoin usage will increase between now and the year 2030. In a base-case scenario, for example, Bitcoin could soon account for 3% of the M2 money supply of emerging market nations, 10% of the remittance asset market, and 2.5% of all institutional assets. Over time, these percentages could grow even higher, as Bitcoin increasingly goes mainstream around the world.\n\nIn the case of Ethereum, the best user adoption rate numbers typically come from valuation models based on Metcalfe's Law, which states that the value of any network is directly proportional to the square of the number of users on it. This law has been used to model the valuation of telecom and internet companies, and now it is being used to model the valuation of cryptocurrencies. Thus, it's very possible that Ethereum's future valuation could be quadratic, not linear, in nature as more users are added to its ecosystem.\n\nThe easiest place to see the impact of this growth happening is in the Layer 2 space, which describes all of the blockchains that are building directly on top of the main Ethereum blockchain. By some accounts, Ethereum's total market capitalization should be $250 billion right now, not $200 billion, if you calculate all of the extra user activity that is happening on Layer 2 blockchain networks. In short, Ethereum could be undervalued by as much as 25% right now.\n\nTechnological improvements\n\nIf there's one area where Ethereum has a decided edge, it's in the technology supporting its blockchain. Whereas Bitcoin is built on old, proof-of-work technology that requires expensive, energy-intensive mining, Ethereum recently transitioned to new, proof-of-stake technology that does not require mining at all. As soon as Ethereum pulled off The Merge last year, it immediately became 99.9% more energy-efficient.\n\nAnd Ethereum is hardly resting on its laurels. As founder Vitalik Buterin has pointed out, Ethereum still has at least five new cycles of technological improvement incoming, all of which will finally lead to the creation of a super-fast, super-efficient \"Ethereum 2.0.\" When that happens, Ethereum will become one of the fastest, most secure transaction networks in the world.\n\nAnd the winner is...\n\nCrypto investors for years have been looking forward to \"the flippening\" -- the moment in time when Ethereum finally overtakes (i.e., \"flips\") Bitcoin as the most valuable crypto in the world. For that to happen, Ethereum's future growth needs to outpace Bitcoin's future growth by a significant margin.\n\nBased on the above, it's possible to see such a scenario taking place. But for now, I'm sticking with Bitcoin, which currently accounts for approximately 50% of the total market value of the entire crypto market. As long as Bitcoin remains the clear favorite option of both retail and institutional investors, it's likely to outpace Ethereum as the better buy going forward."

The firm wrote:\n\n\u201cAs such, it is not possible to exercise the rights to acquire and sell the ETHPoW tokens, and on behalf of the record date shareholders, Grayscale is abandoning the rights to these assets.\u201d\n\nGrayscale\u2019s decision to drop the rights for ETHPoW tokens comes more than a year after the Ethereum Merge, an event that marked Ethereum\u2019s full transition from PoW to proof-of-stake (PoS). The Merge occurred on Sept. 15, 2022, forking the Ethereum blockchain into main PoS-based Ethereum and minor PoW-based Ethereum.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Merge, Grayscale was considering whether the company should acquire EthereumPoW and sell ETHW on behalf of the record date shareholders. 180 days after the Merge, the company took another six months to make a decision on whether to acquire those PoW tokens, citing uncertainty regarding the support of ETHW tokens by digital asset custodians and trading venues.\n\nRelated: Ethereum Merge anniversary \u2014 99% energy drop but centralization fears linger\n\nUnlike Grayscale, some cryptocurrency investment firms like ETC Group have attempted to launch dedicated EthereumPoW exchange-traded products (ETPs).

The firm filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Ethereum Futures Trust (ETH) ETF under the New York Stock Exchange Arca Rule 8.200-E on Sept. 19."

        "content": "Ethereum is currently trading at $1,600 levels and is mostly moving sideways this month in September. The world\u2019s second-biggest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap failed to rally this year and generate stellar returns for investors. ETH is cautiously trading in the charts making investors skeptical of a price spurt.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu: What\u2019s Stopping SHIB From Reaching $0.01 and $1? Explained\n\nHowever, if you had invested $100 every week into Ethereum in 2023, how much money do you think you could have made today? In this article, we will highlight if you\u2019d be in profit or loss if you invested $100 into ETH every week in 2023.\n\nEthereum: Investing $100 Each Week in 2023 is Worth This Much Today\n\nSource: CNN\n\n38 weeks have passed in 2023. and if you invested $100 every week in Ethereum, it would cost you $3,800. However, data from CryptoDCA, shows that investing $100 each week in ETH in 2023 would be worth $3,618 today.

ETH barely spiked in price this year leading to investors holding on to their bags for the long term. The markets remain bearish due to macroeconomic factors and an upcoming bull run is nowhere seen on the horizon.\n\nThe cryptocurrency markets might remain bearish for a few more months testing the patience of investors. The bull run of 2021 has come to a screeching halt and several cryptocurrencies have fallen below their 2020 lows. Therefore, a quick recovery might be off the cards as leading cryptocurrencies have a long way to reclaim their previous all-time highs.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu: $1,000 Turns to $53.7 Million, Gains of 5,372,390%\n\nAt press time, Ethereum was trading at $1,625 and is down 1.1% in the 24-hours day trade. ETH is also down close to 67% from its all-time high of $4,878, which it reached in November 2021."

To be interoperable, tokens and smart contracts will basically have to be the same everywhere. Every chain has to be an EVM chain. And while you can have cross-chain development systems that work on a diverse ecosystem, it is not very useful because your tokens and smart contracts become stranded and useless, and the unique and special functions of particular networks never actually get used."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nA major Ethereum whale transferred nearly $10M worth of ETH to Kraken.\n\nThe wallet\u2019s current ETH stash is worth approximately $466 million.\n\nThe whale originally received 254,908 ETH in 2014 during Ethereum\u2019s early days when each coin was valued at $40.\n\nA sizable number of cryptocurrency assets have been transferred to the cryptocurrency trading site Kraken by one of the largest ETH whales.\n\nA whale deposited 6,000 $ETH ($9.96M) into #Kraken 50 minutes ago. This whale is an Ethereum ICO participant, receiving 254,908 $ETH ($422.6M currently), the ETH ICO price is ~$0.31.https://t.co/f0Ob9tqPqc pic.twitter.com/n3aj96tA31 \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 18, 2023\n\nThe whale bought 254,908 ETH at Ethereum\u2019s 2014 initial coin offering (ICO), when the second-largest cryptocurrency asset was only worth $0.31.\n\nSince ETH is currently trading at $1,632, the value of the cache of 6,000 ETH increased by an astounding 531,360% while it was in the whale\u2019s care for nine years.\n\nAccumulating Over $80M in ETH at Cost of $2.80\n\nAccording to blockchain-tracking firm Etherscan , the wealthy investor spent $2.80 to complete the hefty ETH deposit.\n\nAs per Etherscan data , the whale still owns more than 49,070 ETH, which is equivalent to $80.7 million.\n\nThe wallet has repeatedly received tiny amounts of Ethereum over the last nine years, indicating possible dusting attacks. In these attacks, scammers and hackers send small cryptocurrency amounts (known as \u201cdust\u201d) to numerous wallets, aiming to compromise the privacy of the wallet owners.\n\nAccording to the crypto analytics firm Santiment , significant Ethereum holdings behaved bearishly in the second and third quarters of this year.\n\nThe company explained that the price of ETH is currently around one-third of what it was 22 months ago, however, following a sharp decline and the slaughter that was 2022 (in particular).\n\nThe project garnered media attention around a year ago during the highly anticipated merger, which successfully achieved reduced energy consumption and improved scalability.\n\nHowever, due to the asset\u2019s lack of significant price movement, traders have gradually lost interest in it over the past year, in contrast to other major cryptocurrencies.\n\nHope At The End Of the Road\n\nSantiment remains optimistic about the project\u2019s viability despite its current value. However, the metrics show a significant decline in utility for Vitalik Buterin\u2019s initiative, with both on-chain transaction activity and trade volume sharply decreasing since their peak in early November last year.\n\nAccording to the Santiment\u2019s report , all of this is a sign of the audience simply losing interest at a time when many traders are unsure whether the $1,650 price level is overvalued or undervalued, however, it is not necessarily a warning sign for any asset.\n\nIf ETH drops to such a low level, we\u2019ve seen significant psychological support around the $1,500 mark. Therefore, if and when this scenario unfolds, expect a notable increase in trading volume.\n\nMonitoring the behavior of significant players, both whales and the general crowd, is crucial. We\u2019ve seen a supply dump lasting about four months from addresses holding 10 to 10,000 ETH.\n\nThese prominent investors did accumulate significantly towards the end of last year. However, once the price reached a one-year high of around $2,120, they began taking profits rapidly.\n\nThe ongoing decrease in the Ethereum supply held by large investors, such as whales and sharks, is a trend worth watching. While price increases may still occur as these investors cash in, their actions don\u2019t necessarily indicate an immediate return to the $2,000+ range.\n\nLastly, for those concerned about Ethereum\u2019s role in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, it\u2019s important to note that the development activity led by the ETH team remains robust and active, concludes Santiment."

        "content": "Solana (SOL) has captured the attention of former Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal, who recently declared it one of his standout altcoin choices and a potential contender to Ethereum\u2019s dominance.\n\nIn a new interview, Pal highlighted Solana\u2019s unique strengths, emphasizing its unrivaled speed and performance, qualities that have even prompted payments giant Visa to choose it as their platform of choice.\n\nPal unveiled his enthusiasm for SOL, dubbing it one of his foremost altcoin choices and a contender for the most promising project outside of Ethereum. The crypto luminary also shed light on the growing influence of Solana\u2019s co-founder, Anatoly Yakovenko, popularly known as Toly, in the cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nPal\u2019s bullish stance on Solana stems from its speed and exceptional performance, characteristics that have garnered attention even from giants like Visa.\n\nPal said:\n\n\u201cSo, why is Visa using Solana? Because it\u2019s fast. It\u2019s fast, and it does a good job.\u201d\n\nThis sentiment represents the distinctiveness of Solana in comparison to Ethereum and hints at the potential for interconnectivity between these blockchain ecosystems. Visa\u2019s recent announcement of its foray into stablecoin settlement capabilities on Solana further bolsters its credibility in the industry.\n\nSolana: Recent Market Performance And Outlook\n\nDespite Pal\u2019s optimistic outlook, the charts tell a different story for Solana. On August 5th, SOL experienced a bearish market structure as its price plummeted below the crucial $22.73 support level. Subsequently, in mid-August, the cryptocurrency endured a sharp decline, witnessing a staggering 23.8% drop from its recent peak.\n\nSOL market cap currently at $8 billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nPrevailing Bearish Momentum\n\nAs of now, Solana remains in the grip of this downtrend, with its market structure yet to show signs of a reversal. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) lingers below the critical 50-point mark, underscoring the prevailing bearish momentum. A pivotal line of defense for the bulls is the 78.6% retracement level at $16.94.\n\nAccording to analysts, a test of this support level could offer a viable buying opportunity, potentially targeting local highs at $25.5, $29, and an ambitious $32. However, a dip below the $15.5-mark would invalidate any hopes of a bullish reversal at the 78.6% retracement level.\n\nSOL price action in the last week. Source: Coingecko\n\nMarket Statistics\n\nAt the time of reporting, SOL was trading at $19.84 at CoinGecko, reflecting a 3.7% gain in the past 24 hours. Over the course of the previous seven days, SOL had exhibited a commendable rally of 12.5%.\n\nIn contrast, Ether (ETH) was priced at $1,637.25, marking a modest 0.3% increase within the past 24 hours. Over the same seven-day period, ETH had recorded gains of 5.5%.\n\n(This site\u2019s content should not be construed as investment advice. Investing involves risk.

        "content": "Best Place to Stake Ethereum: The Top 5 Best Places to Earn Staking Rewards with Ethereum\n\nCryptocurrency staking has become an increasingly popular way for individuals to earn passive income by holding and locking their tokens in a wallet. With the recent Shanghai upgrade and the introduction of Ethereum 2.0, Ethereum staking has gained significant attention in the crypto space.\n\nIn this guide, we will explore the top 5 places where you can earn staking rewards with Ethereum and become your validator.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a seasoned crypto enthusiast or new to the staking world, this article will provide valuable insights and step-by-step guidance to help you make informed decisions.\n\nAlso read: BRICS Influence in the Oil Sector Grows, Puts US Dollar in Danger\n\nSource: CNN\n\nWhat is cryptocurrency staking?\n\nCryptocurrency staking is when individuals hold and lock a certain amount of cryptocurrency in a wallet for a predetermined period.\n\nBy doing so, they contribute to the network\u2019s stability and security and, in return, earn staking rewards in the form of additional native cryptocurrency.\n\nAlso, staking is particularly popular in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain networks, where staking is used to secure the network rather than rely on miners, as seen in Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains.\n\nFurthermore, the amount of cryptocurrency that can be staked and the staking period vary depending on the specific cryptocurrency and its protocols.\n\nAlso, some protocols allow staking with a few coins, while others require a larger minimum stake. Ethereum, with its recent upgrade to Ethereum 2.0, has introduced staking as a way to validate transactions and earn rewards.\n\nAlso read: BRICS Influence in the Oil Sector Grows, Puts US Dollar in Danger\n\nBenefits of Staking\n\nStaking offers several benefits to cryptocurrency holders, making it an attractive option for earning passive income. These benefits include:\n\nPassive Income: Staking allows individuals to earn passive income by simply holding and locking their crypto coins in a wallet. The additional coins earned through staking can be cashed out or used for other purposes. Increased Network Stability: By keeping their deposits on the blockchain, stakers inject liquidity into the platform, contributing to smoother operations and better network stability. Reduced Supply: Staking can help reduce the circulating supply of a particular cryptocurrency by locking coins in a wallet, which can potentially increase its value. Lower Transaction Fees: Some blockchain networks use staking to process transactions more efficiently, resulting in lower transaction fees for users. Increased Governance and Security: Stakers in certain blockchain networks can participate in the network\u2019s decision-making process, giving them voting rights and contributing to the platform\u2019s governance and security. No Specialized Hardware Required: Unlike mining, staking does not require specialized hardware, making it accessible to a wider range of users.\n\nWhile staking offers numerous benefits, it\u2019s also important to consider the potential disadvantages.\n\nDisadvantages of Staking\n\nStaking also comes with its share of disadvantages, which should be taken into account before engaging in the process:\n\nLocked Funds: Staking locks your funds for a specific period, making them inaccessible. If you require immediate access to your funds, staking may not suit you. Risk of Loss: There is always the risk of losing some or all of the staked funds if the network fails or if there is a hack or attack on the blockchain network. Potential for Lower Returns: Staking returns can vary depending on the cryptocurrency and network performance. Lower demand for the cryptocurrency or network inefficiencies can result in lower stakeholder returns. Centralization: Some protocols and cryptocurrencies may require a higher minimum stake, leading to the centralization of staking power among small individuals or entities. Regulatory Risks: Staking may be subject to regulatory scrutiny in certain jurisdictions, potentially causing legal issues for stakers.\n\nDespite drawbacks, staking can be rewarding, especially with Ethereum.\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nWhy Should You Stake Your ETH?\n\nEthereum, as one of the oldest and most established blockchain networks, offers several compelling reasons why you should consider staking your ETH:\n\nEstablished Network: Ethereum has a large and active community of developers and users, providing stability and security to stakeholders. Large Market Cap: With a significant market capitalization, Ethereum\u2019s popularity and liquidity make it an ideal cryptocurrency for staking and receiving rewards. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Ecosystem: Ethereum has a thriving DeFi ecosystem, allowing for a wide range of financial applications to be built on top of the network. This provides numerous opportunities for stakeholders to earn rewards and participate in the network\u2019s growth.\n\nWith these advantages, staking your ETH can be a strategic move to earn passive income and contribute to the Ethereum network.\n\nHow Can You Stake ETH?\n\nThere are several ways to stake Ethereum and start earning staking rewards. Here are three main methods:\n\nBecome an ETH Validator: This is the most direct method of staking ETH but also the most challenging. To become a validator, you must hold 32 ETH and run a validator node with a 24/7 internet connection. Use a Staking Pool: Staking pools collect resources from different account holders and pool them into nodes.\n\n\n\nYou can stake smaller amounts and earn rewards by joining a staking pool. Staking pools also offer liquidity through intermediary tokens, allowing you to withdraw your funds anytime. Use a Centralized Exchange: Many centralized exchanges now offer staking services for Ethereum. All you need is a wallet for the exchange and a payment method. This method is the easiest way to stake ETH, but it may have some limitations or fees imposed by the exchange.\n\nYou grasp the basics. Ethereum\u2019s appeal is clear. Explore the top 5 places for Ethereum staking rewards.\n\nTop 5 Places to Earn Staking Rewards with Ethereum\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange offers Ethereum staking through its staking platform. Binance allows staking in a pool with as little as 0.1 ETH and offers a \u201cFlexible Lock\u201d option, allowing you to redeem your assets at any time.\n\nWhile Binance mandates the 32 ETH requirement for independent validators, it tokenizes BETH as the proof of staked Ethereum in a 1:1 ratio. Binance does not charge staking fees, making it an attractive option for staking your ETH.\n\n2. Coinbase\n\nThis leading cryptocurrency exchange provides an easy-to-use platform for staking Ethereum.\n\nCoinbase has no staking minimums for ETH, but they charge a 25% commission on staking rewards, which is higher than other options.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that staking ETH on Coinbase may have geographical restrictions, and you may not be able to stake if you live outside the United States.\n\n3. Kraken\n\nSource: Reuters\n\nKraken, a regulated crypto exchange, has expanded into several international markets and offers Ethereum staking.\n\nAdditionally, you can buy and sell a wide range of cryptocurrencies on Kraken, including staking Ethereum. Kraken allows you to join a staking pool with as little as 0.0001 ETH, making it far more affordable for newcomers or users with a small crypto budget.\n\nKraken charges a 15% administrative fee for staking Ethereum, which is withdrawn from your reward earnings.\n\n4. Rocket Pool\n\nRocket Pool is a decentralized staking platform built on top of the Ethereum network. It offers a unique approach to staking that allows for more flexibility and decentralization.\n\nFurthermore, with Rocket Pool, you can stake ETH as an independent node without having to stake the full 32 ETH. You can also choose to stake in an ETH pool.\n\nRunning a node through Rocket Pool can yield a higher rate of APY. The commission fees on the platform are competitive with other staking options.\n\n5. Lido\n\nLido is a decentralized staking platform that provides a user-friendly and secure way to stake Ethereum. It allows users to stake any amount of Ethereum, regardless of the 32 ETH minimum requirement for independent staking.\n\nAdditionally, Lido achieves this by pooling funds from multiple users and staking them together as a single entity. Users can earn staking rewards and receive a tokenized representation of their stake (stETH), which can be traded, used in DeFi applications, or used as collateral.\n\nThis allows users to enjoy the benefits of staking while maintaining liquidity.\n\nGetting Started with Ethereum Staking\n\nTo get started with Ethereum staking, follow these steps:\n\nChoose a platform: Evaluate the features and offerings of different Ethereum staking platforms and select the one that suits your requirements. Create an account. Sign up for an account on the chosen platform and complete the necessary verification processes. Deposit Ethereum: Deposit your Ethereum into the platform\u2019s staking address or wallet. Stake your ETH: Follow the platform\u2019s instructions to stake your ETH. Depending on the platform, you may need to select a staking pool or become an independent validator. Monitor your rewards. Keep track of your staking rewards, which will be automatically added to your account on the platform. Withdraw your rewards: Depending on the platform, you can withdraw your rewards periodically or leave them to compound over time.\n\nRemember to do thorough research and consider the risks and rewards associated with staking before making any decisions. Stay updated on Ethereum. Know network changes. Ensure smooth staking.\n\nConclusion\n\nSource: Crypto News\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum staking offers a unique opportunity for individuals to earn passive income and contribute to the security and stability of the Ethereum network.\n\nBy staking ETH, you can start earning rewards and be part of the exciting world of decentralized finance.\n\nConsider your goals. Do your research. Understand the risks. Choose the right staking platform, be it centralized or decentralized.\n\nStart your journey into Ethereum staking today and unlock the potential of your ETH tokens."

        "content": "On the back of its partial victory against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Grayscale has applied to the Commission for another Ethereum Futures Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).\n\nWhy Another ETH Futures ETF?\n\nAccording to a report by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), Grayscale Investments filed this application on September 20. This development may come as a surprise to many, considering that the asset manager had filed an earlier application to offer this same investment vehicle. As such, this will represent its third application (Grayscale withdrew its first application due to SEC concerns before filing another one in July).\n\nThere is, however, a distinction between both applications, as WSJ noted. The latest application is filed under the Securities Act of 1933, a regulation under which spot Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock\u2019s filed. Meanwhile, the initial application was filed under the Investment Company Act of 1940, a regulation which securities-based ETFs are registered under.\n\nWhile the exact reason for Grayscale\u2019s action remains unknown, it may be a contingency plan in case the SEC denies its initial proposed Ethereum futures ETF, which is expected to launch in October, barring any denial.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s filing under the Securities Act of 1933 isn\u2019t the first, as Brazilian investment firm Hashdex filed its Ethereum ETF application under that Act. Last week, Hashdex applied with the SEC to offer a fund that will hold both Ether futures contracts and a Spot Ethereum ETF (the first of its kind).\n\nThe firm justified this move by stating that a combination of both markets will help mitigate the risk of market manipulation.\n\nHashdex\u2019s application has been singled out for how distinct it is from other applications. The investment firm has proposed to use the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to track the price of Ethereum and also plans to buy the Ether, which the fund will hold from the CME Market\u2019s Exchange for Physical (EFP) transactions.\n\nETH price holding above $1,600 support | source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nEthereum Futures ETF Imminent?\n\nSeveral Ethereum futures ETFs are expected to hit the market in October, barring a denial by the SEC. Rule 485(a) of the SEC Rules allows these ETFs to launch 75 days from their respective filing dates if the SEC doesn\u2019t deny them before then.\n\nIn line with this, the ETFs of fund managers like Volatility Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, ProShares, and Roundhill will be the first to launch if they receive approval from the SEC.\n\nVolatility Shares was the first among them to apply to offer Ethereum futures ETF. As such, it will gain the first-mover advantage, carrying a possible October 12 launch date, with others coming after. However, this is subject to any decision by the SEC.\n\nThe SEC approving an Ethereum ETF will be a historical event that is expected to give the crypto market a much-needed boost as the bear market continues to linger. There are already forecasts that ETH\u2019s price could rise above $2,000 when these funds launch.\n\nFeatured image from Analytics Insight, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "CROWD CONTROL: Ethereum has been so successful in attracting new validators for its proof-of-stake blockchain that the network is now starting to suffer from sprawl. There are nearly 800,000 active validators on the network, up about 41% since April\u2019s \u201cShapella\u201d upgrade, when withdrawals of staked ETH were first allowed, according to a Sept. 14 report by Galaxy Research\u2019s Christine Kim. Based on certain assumptions, the number is on track to hit 1 million by mid-November and 2 million by June 2024. \u201cEthereum is getting close to reaching an unsustainable number of active validators,\u201d Kim wrote. It\u2019s pretty technical, but network \u201clatency\u201d is becoming a key problem, according to the report: There\u2019s been \u201can increasing frequency of block reorgs and missed blocks in the first two slots of an epoch, likely due to increasing latency in attestation aggregation.\u201d Developers have formalized EIP-7514 \u2013 an improvement proposal that would help, at least in the short term, by limiting entries of new validators to 8 per epoch (roughly 12 seconds), down from the current rate of 12. Another major concern from the rapid proliferation of validators, according to the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s Dankrad Feist in a recent post, is that staking is becoming too concentrated in the hands of Lido, the biggest protocol for so-called liquid staking tokens. The plan to reduce the \u201cchurn limit\u201d for new validators could be a stopgap measure for a more \u201celegant\u201d fix down the road, Feist wrote."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price may have been dealt a massive blow as a research report on the Ethereum valuation has revealed that the cryptocurrency giant has been trading below its fair price.\n\nEthereum Trading Value Slips\n\nA new on-chain research report has delved deep into the fair value of the Ethereum cryptocurrency since its inception, segregating the cryptocurrency\u2019s value into sections and utilizing its trading activities and active addresses to evaluate the network\u2019s worth over the past years.\n\nLewis Harland, an RxR analyst, revealed in the research report that Ethereum has been trading below fair value by a 27% discount. The analyst arrived at this conclusion after employing the Metcalfe law-centric valuation model which involves comparing active user base on Ethereum\u2019s robust scaling networks and active user adoption to measure the network\u2019s fair value.\n\nHarland explained that Ethereum\u2019s network valuation can be measured and tracked slightly more accurately when the active user base of the blockchain\u2019s scaling networks is integrated into the model. He stated that if the model excludes active user bases, then Ether\u2019s (ETH) valuation would be trading significantly below its fair value of $275 billion.\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s network valuation tracks the updated ML index better when the active user base of Ethereum\u2019s scaling networks is factored into the model than when omitted,\u201d Harland, stated in the research report.\n\nHe added that \u201cthe updated model, which does factor in these networks, puts ETH\u2019s valuation at $275 billion (current MCAP trading at a 27% discount), assuming no further user growth in perpetuity.\u201d\n\nGoing by Harland\u2019s research, Ethereum should be trading at around $2,300 with a market cap of $275 billion. However, Ethereum\u2019s price is currently sitting at $1,637 with a market capitalization of $197.62 billion.\n\nAnalyst says ETH price is sitting 27% below fair value | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nEthereum\u2019s Worth Revealed Through Value Layers\n\nWhile exploring the decline in Ethereum\u2019s trading value, RxR disclosed its analysis of Ethereum\u2019s supposed value using value layers. The research firm explained that Ethereum\u2019s commodity value layer can be analyzed through the amount of ETH millions of users utilize to facilitate their crypto transactions daily.\n\nIt further stated that the annual run rate of the transaction fees is well over $1.6 billion presently. It also described Ethereum\u2019s equity value, stating that \u201cthe value of ETH is the present-day value of the sum of all of its future cash flows. To date, over 3.5m ETH ($5.8B) has been burned by EIP-1559.\u201d\n\nLastly, the research firm represented Ethereum\u2019s network value layer, and the analysis utilized Metcalfe\u2019s law approach to conclude the recent data that revealed that the Ethereum blockchain network was trading below fair value.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has been dealing with a series of strong declines that may push the growth of the ecosystem back a few years. The tenacity of the cryptocurrency\u2019s native token Ether (ETH) was tested when it fell to a critical support level of $1,530 earlier in September. However, the cryptocurrency later made a slight recovery which pushed it back to a more stable position.\n\nFeatured image from Analytics Insight, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

A recent report shows that the SEC would allow the first ETFs based on Ether futures, inducing hype into the Ethereum market.\n\nGrayscale Advisors \u2013 which manage the ETF . are referred to as the \u201csponsor\u201d in the company\u2019s filing, as the proposal is pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and rule change submitted by NYSE to the SEC.\n\n\u201cThe Sponsor is in the process of becoming registered as a commodity pool operator with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and is in the process of becoming a member of the National Futures Association,\u201d reads Grayscale\u2019s filing.\n\nThe document also mentions that The Grayscale Ethereum Futures Trust will keep its holdings in Ether futures contracts with a \u201croughly constant expiration profile,\u201d and that it will \u201cnever carry futures positions all the way to cash settlement.\u201d\n\nThe trust plans to initiate an open position in futures contracts by depositing an initial margin amount. This margin deposit serves a similar function to a cash performance bond, providing assurance of the trader\u2019s commitment to fulfilling the purchased or sold futures contracts.\n\nGrayscale Tips The Scale\n\nFollowing a partial win gained by Ripple over the case in which the SEC claims the company traded in unregistered securities, Grayscale\u2019s triumph over the commission solidified the belief that the SEC may actually lose in court if it\u2019s truly at fault.\n\nNow, Grayscale is reaping the full extent of its triumph by hedging its bets on both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Grayscale even said it won\u2019t refile its Bitcoin spot ETF application as it sees its current application as sufficient.\n\nAnd, according to an analyst, now is definitely the time to start investing in Ethereum, which is exactly how Grayscale aims to expand its business."

The filing is distinct from Grayscale\u2019s previous attempts at an Ethereum futures ETF, which it submitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal noted that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved a number of Bitcoin futures ETFs under both the 1933 and 1940 Acts. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, none of which have been approved, have been filed under the 1933 Act.\n\nThe fact that the SEC approved certain earlier Bitcoin futures ETFs starting around October 2021 \u2014 combined with more general optimism around cryptocurrency ETFs \u2014 could make Ethereum futures ETFs a viable pursuit for asset managers.\n\nIndeed, multiple asset managers have already jumped on the trend. In recent weeks, Volatility Shares, Bitwise, ProShares, VanEck, Roundhill, and Valkyrie Investments have all applied for Ethereum futures ETFs. The Wall Street Journal identified Hashdex as another applicant; various other firms bring the number of applicants to at least 12.\n\nGrayscale is also pursuing a Bitcoin spot ETF\n\nGrayscale\u2019s attempts to obtain an ETF of any type are especially notable because the firm plans to convert its existing GBTC fund into a spot Bitcoin ETF. Though the SEC initially disapproved Grayscale\u2019s application in 2022, Grayscale gained a partial legal victory in August that will likely force the SEC to review the application.\n\nAs noted by the Wall Street Journal, judges in the D.C. Court of Appeals said that Grayscale\u2019s proposed ETF conversion is \u201cmaterially similar\u201d to other, previously approved Bitcoin futures ETFs \u2014 seemingly a nod in the company\u2019s favor.\n\nBut despite widespread optimism, that ruling will not necessarily require the SEC to approve Grayscale\u2019s proposed ETF. The SEC merely needs to review the application.\n\nOther firms are also pursuing Bitcoin spot ETFs closely modeled on a much-hyped application filed by BlackRock in June. Grayscale\u2019s own spot Bitcoin ETF application precedes and differs from BlackRock\u2019s application as it concerns an existing fund."

        "title": "Investing $100/week into Ethereum in 2023 would be this worth today - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "As Ethereum (ETH) begins to reverse its gains, initiated by the cryptocurrency market recovery earlier this week, data suggests that dollar-cost averaging (DCA) by investing $100 per week in 2023 would not have been a profitable strategy for the second-largest cryptocurrency so far.\n\nSpecifically, DCA is a method that includes spreading out investments by buying at intervals and in roughly equal cash amounts, regardless of the price. It is popular among newcomers as it tries to minimize the impact of volatility and psychology on the overall investment, as opposed to timing the market.\n\nDCA-ing Ethereum\n\nHowever, despite these advantages, DCA has its shortcomings, as it relies on the notion that prices will, ultimately, always rise, but when this is not the case, such a strategy cannot protect the investor from declining market prices, as is evident in the case of Ethereum.\n\nIndeed, using this method on Ethereum in 2023, i.e., purchasing $100 worth of ETH each week since January 1, 2023, the $3,800 investment (38 weeks) would today be worth $3,618.97, or 4.76% less than the amount invested, according to the most recent data retrieved from cryptoDCA on September 20.\n\nEarlier, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen shared his own calculations, albeit for the period leading up to August 3, 2023 (31 weeks), which hailed similar results as above, indicating that the investor using the weekly $100 DCA strategy on Ethereum would be at a loss by 4.67%, as he shared in an X post on September 19.\n\nEthereum weekly $100 dollar-cost averaging in 2023. Source: Benjamin Cowen\n\nOn the other hand, using the same method on Bitcoin (BTC), i.e., spending $3,800 over the course of 38 weeks on it, would have brought the participating investor into profit, providing a 5.69% return on investment as of September 19, with a DCA value of $4,016.30, as Finbold reported earlier.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum was at the time of publication changing hands at the price of $1,627.05, recording a decline of 1.17% in the last 24 hours, a 1.7% gain across the past seven days, and a 2.62% drop during the previous month, as the latest charts suggest.\n\nEthereum 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nOn top of that, earlier data has demonstrated that Ethereum had lost $13 billion in net capital last week, according to the breakdown of the market realized value net capital change for the asset shared by crypto trading expert Ali Martinez on September 15, as Finbold reported at the time.\n\nThat said, global blockchain leader at Ernst & Young (EY), Paul Brody, has recently said that \u201cEthereum is going to eat the entire blockchain sector and everything that is not Ethereum will eventually become an Ethereum Layer 2,\u201d while its surge of specialization among key players could assist in possible price growth in the nearer future.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Gas Consumption Is Down 99.99% Since The Merge - Blockonomi",
        "content": "Ethereum gas consumption has plummeted 99.99% since The Merge, transforming the network into a more environmentally friendly platform.\n\nOne year after the major upgrade, The Merge, which marked the transition from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus, Ethereum has achieved certain improvements, including a record drop in gas consumption.\n\nAccording to data from Glassnode Alerts, Ethereum\u2019s daily energy consumption has been down 99.9% post-Merge.\n\nAdditionally, gas fee pressure on the Ethereum network has eased despite the recent SocialFi hype. In the past, gas fees on the Ethereum network were inclined to explode due to increased network activities. This gas fee optimization could result from Layer-2 scaling solutions\u2019 development, one of the remarkable progresses this year.\n\nHowever, most arguments point to the fact that the poor performance of NFT, and meme trend\u2019s losing steam have decreased the demand for gas usage over the past few weeks. Ethereum consequently turned to deflationary due to the price plunge. With over 300,000 ETH burned, Ethereum has deflated annually at 0.25%.\n\nWhat to Expect on Dencun Upgrade?\n\nFollowing The Merge, the Ethereum community turned its eyes to Dencun, the next major upgrade anticipated by the end of 2023. During the All Core Devs on September 15, a monthly meeting of the Ethereum developers, the team reportedly discussed a number of core areas, including the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) ahead of the Dencun upgrade.\n\nAccording to the meeting minutes, EIP-4844 is among the key points of the next upgrade. EIP-4844 is expected to improve the network\u2019s security and scalability.\n\nCurrently, clients such as Prysm, Besu, and Geth are undergoing Devnet-8. EIP-4844 introduces \u201cblob-transaction,\u201d a new transaction format that facilitates gas fee optimization through the process of blob-carrying transactions between Layer-1 and Layer-2.\n\nWhile The Merge was expected to enable the withdrawal of staked ETH, post-event, in fact, has brought more participants to Ethereum staking. As of August 31, more than $20 billion worth of ETH has been staked, with Lido Finance accounting for 32.4% of all staked Ethereum.\n\nHowever, the dominance of Lido raises the centralization concern. That\u2019s why the Ethereum team discussed the implementation of the EIP-7514. Tim Beiko, Ethereum Protocol Developer, said that the latest conversation was \u201cabout whether to add a constant cap to the validator activation queue. The proposal had since then been formalized as EIP-7514.\u201d\n\nThe EIP-7514 is particularly important to prevent risks when Dencun is launched. This proposal is expected to address the centralization risk revolving around liquid staking by limiting the number of validators added to the network per epoch to 8 validators.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade will overall make Ethereum work more efficiently behind the scenes, getting ready for more improvements in the future, like a new way to organize data called SSZ, which will make Ethereum safer, more efficient, and run even better.\n\nThe FTX Hangover Continues\n\nBefore Dencun can be implemented, there is concern about the upcoming FTX token sale. Last week, Judge John Dorsey approved the bankrupt entity\u2019s proposal to liquidate its crypto assets. FTX plans to sell billions worth of crypto assets without prior notice to the public.\n\nFTX still has loads of assets, and it looks like they are coming to the market.\n\nAs reported, FTX intends to sell billions of dollars in crypto that it owns in order to collect funds to repay creditors. The deadline for that plan to be approved was September 13, 2023. The company has $192 million worth of Ethereum in its holdings, in addition to other Category A cryptocurrencies such as Solana ($1,162 billion) and Bitcoin ($560 million).\n\nFTX also holds about $900 million in Category B tokens, defined as having low liquidity. These include prominent names such as Serum (SRM), Blur (BLUR), Polkastarter (POLS), Maps.me (MAPS), Oxygen (OXY), and Bonfida (FIDA)."

        "title": "Grayscale Makes Another Bid for Ethereum Futures ETF - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nGrayscale recently submitted a new application for an Ethe\u00adreum Futures ETF. Intere\u00adstingly, they submitted it under the Securities Act of 1933, typically used for commoditie\u00ads and Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThis decision marks a shift from their initial application filed under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which primarily gove\u00adrns securities-based ETFs. Many spe\u00adculate about the underlying re\u00adasons behind this strategic move.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s Second Attempt at Ethereum Futures ETF\n\nGrayscale Inve\u00adstments, a prominent cryptocurrency investment sector player, has again entered the world of Ethereum futures ETFs. Yes, you heard it correctly\u2014their determination remains ste\u00adadfast as they make another atte\u00admpt.\n\nGrayscale has chosen a different regulatory path for its latest application. This time, they have submitted the application under the Securities Act of 1933, deviating from their previous approach.\n\nThe Initial Ethe\u00adreum futures ETF application was built on the foundation of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which serve\u00ads as a common framework for securities-base\u00add ETFs. However, the approach has now shifte\u00add towards aligning with the Securities Act of 1933, typically associate\u00add with commodities and Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBitcoin futures ETFs have successfully registere\u00add and obtained approval under both regulatory acts. This suggests that this alternative approach may be an effort to enhance the chance\u00ads of approval.\n\nSpeculation Abounds as SEC Approaches Ethereum Futures ETF Approval\n\nThe Securitie\u00ads and Exchange Commission (SEC) is nearing approval for Ethe\u00adreum futures-based e\u00adxchange-traded funds (ETFs). Source\u00ads familiar with the matter further imply that product approval could occur early in October.\n\nThe Se\u00adcurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently re\u00adviewing six applications for Ethereum future\u00ads-based exchange-trade\u00add funds (ETFs). These applications include the Bitwise Ethereum Strate\u00adgy ETF, Roundhill Ether Strategy ETF, VanEck\u2019s Ethere\u00adum Strategy ETF, ProShares Short Ether Strate\u00adgy ETF, and Grayscale Ethereum Future\u00ads ETF. Approval of these ETFs by the SEC seems imminent.\n\nSources sugge\u00adst that approval may be on the horizon, potentially as early as October, despite the SEC\u2019s silence on the matte\u00adr. The intense competition leaves uncertainty about which firms will secure the first approvals."

        "title": "'We Can't Build Something Like This on Ethereum,' Says DYdX Founder as Mainnet Nears - CoinDesk",
        "content": "Juliano: I do strongly believe that layer 2s will get to a point where the sequencer is a network, rather than just a single operator. And that will make the sequencers much more decentralized, censorship-resistant. But the problem with having a single sequencer on layer 2\u2019s right now is, the single sequencers are not censorship-resistant, right? It's just like, literally a server, and the server can refuse to process your transactions if it wants to. Like, I'm not trying to pick on anyone, like literally all of them are like this, but let's just take like Coinbase or Base as an example. Coinbase is literally running a server that is the sequencer for the Base chain. And if they want to reject your transaction, for whatever reason, they can do that. And, you know, I think they're trying to be as impartial as possible. And that's awesome. But that is not totally decentralized, I may say. And just to prove the point that I kind of understand most of the arguments at least, OK, there's a way to get around the censorship-resistance switches. Effectively, you can go back to layer 1, and send a transaction to layer 1 and be like, Oh, Coinbase, you have to include my transaction now because I went to the layer 1. But that's a terrible product experience, right? Like maybe that works for some edge cases, or if like the less than 1% of the time when, for some random reason somebody's being centralized by a sequencer. But if there's a good amount of opportunity for a sizable amount of the transactions to be censored on a given sequencer, for whatever reason, then this may not be something that you want for your network as much."

If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to identify the cryptocurrencies that have the potential to be game-changers in the industry. Analysts have weighed in, and three cryptocurrencies are generating considerable buzz: Ethereum (ETH), VeChain (VET), and the up-and-coming Kangamoon (KANG).\n\nSummary\n\nEthereum price prediction\n\nVeChain embarks on its smart city journey\n\nKangamoon projected to grow by 35x after major exchange listings\n\nDon\u2019t Miss Out On The Kangamoon (KANG) Presale \u2013 Reserve Your Spot!\n\nEthereum (ETH): Great Growth Potential\n\nEthereum (ETH), often called the king of smart contracts, is not a new player in the crypto world. However, it continues to evolve and adapt, solidifying its position as a game-changing cryptocurrency.\n\nThe year started with a resurgence of on-chain activity, primarily driven by a significant spike in NFT trading volumes. The Blur token airdrop frenzy further fueled this resurgence. Concurrently, the Ethereum price experienced a notable uptick.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum\u2019s burn rate, the reduction of its total supply through network fee burning, accelerated notably. This steady reduction in supply could drive demand up. Due to all these reasons, analysts foresee the Ethereum value soaring to $2,335.71 by the end of 2023.\n\nVeChain (VET): Revolutionizing Supply Chain Management\n\nVeChain (VET) has been making waves in supply chain management. With its unique blend of IoT integration and blockchain technology, VeChain enables transparent and secure tracking of products throughout the supply chain.\n\nIn recent VeChain news, it has embarked on a pioneering journey into smart city systems, marking a significant milestone in the blockchain industry. VeChain is positioning itself at the forefront of innovation by venturing into the realm of smart cities.\n\nAs smart cities continue to evolve and expand, VeChain\u2019s involvement in these systems solidifies its status as a crypto project with a transformative vision for the future. Thus making it a compelling choice for investors looking for game-changing opportunities in 2023. Additionally, experts foresee a rise to $0.023 for the VeChain price within Q4 of 2023.\n\nKangamoon (KANG): The Meme Coin with a Twist\n\nWhile Ethereum and VeChain are established players, Kangamoon (KANG) represents the new wave of cryptocurrencies entering the scene. What sets Kangamoon apart is its playful approach to cryptocurrency, combining meme coin appeal with the emerging Play-2-Earn (P2E) gaming trend.\n\nKangamoon introduces players to a virtual universe where they can take on the role of Kangamoon, a boxing kangaroo. This all-immersive experience not only entertains but also provides the opportunity to monetize gaming time through in-game rewards and the trade of digital assets.\n\nIn addition to the core gameplay, Kangamoon offers collectibles and NFTs, adding an extra layer of excitement for players and collectors. These digital collectibles can become valuable assets within the game and even in the broader world of NFTs.\n\nAt the heart of this game will lie the KANG native token, now worth only $0.005 as it is in Stage 1 of its presale. However, analysts have also noticed that it has a low market cap. When compared to Ethereum and VeChain, KANG may see faster growth. In fact, they forecast that a 35x value increase is in store after it gets listed on significant exchanges.\n\nDiscover the Exciting Opportunities of the Kangamoon (KANG) Presale Today!\n\nWebsite: https://Kangamoon.com/\n\nJoin Our Telegram Community: https://t.me/Kangamoonofficial"

ETH again climbed above the $1,650 resistance but struggled to clear $1,660, unlike Bitcoin.\n\nThe price made two attempts to gain strength above $1,660 but failed. A high was formed near $1,660 and the price started a downside correction. There was a move below the $1,650 level. The price declined below the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $1,627 swing low to the $1,660 high.\n\nEther is now trading above $1,635 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is also holding the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $1,627 swing low to the $1,660 high.\n\nOn the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,650 level. There is also a key contracting triangle forming with resistance near $1,650 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The next resistance is near the $1,660 level. The main resistance is now forming near $1,670.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA close above the $1,670 resistance might send the price toward the $1,750 resistance. The next major hurdle is near the $1,820 level. A close above the $1,820 level might send Ethereum further higher toward $1,950 in the coming days.\n\nDownside Break in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,660 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,635 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThe first key support is close to $1,620. The next key support is $1,600. A clear move below $1,600 might increase selling pressure. In the stated case, the price could even decline toward the $1,540 level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,620\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,660\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Digital currency investment company Grayscale is the latest firm to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a new Ether (ETH) futures exchange-traded fund (ETF)\n\nOn Sept. 19, Grayscale proposed listing and trading shares of the Grayscale Ethereum Futures Trust ETF under the New York Stock Exchange Arca Rule 8.200-E.\n\nThe proposal is pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and rule change submitted by NYSE to the SEC. The ETF is managed by Grayscale Advisors, also referred to as the \u201csponsor\u201d in the filing.\n\n\u201cThe Sponsor is in the process of becoming registered as a commodity pool operator with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and is in the process of becoming a member of the National Futures Association,\u201d the document reads. It also states that Grayscale Advisors has engaged Videnct Advisory as a subadviser to serve as the trust\u2019s commodity trading adviser.\n\nThe Grayscale Ethereum Futures Trust seeks to maintain its holdings in Ether futures contracts with a \u201croughly constant expiration profile,\u201d the filing reads, adding that it will \u201cnever carry futures positions all the way to cash settlement.\u201d\n\nThe nature of the Ether futures contracts in the ETF will not require the trust to use an Ether custodian, the filing reads, adding:\n\n\u201cThe trust will deposit an initial margin amount to initiate an open position in futures contracts. A margin deposit is like a cash performance bond. It helps assure the trader\u2019s performance of the futures contracts that he or she purchases or sells.\u201d\n\nThe news comes a few weeks after the digital asset management firm Valkyrie also filed for an Ether futures ETF with the SEC in mid-August, following several other firms filing for ETH futures ETFs. On Aug. 17, Bloomberg reported that the SEC was set to allow the first ETFs based on Ether futures, spurring much optimism regarding the Ethereum market.\n\nRelated: Grayscale officially abandons post-Merge PoW Ethereum tokens\n\nLast month, Grayscale scored a major, though partial, victory against the SEC in its efforts to convert its over-the-counter Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a listed spot Bitcoin ETF. The SEC had rejected its GBTC application, after which Grayscale sued. The appeals court ordered that Grayscale\u2019s petition for review be granted and the SEC\u2019s order to deny the GBTC listing application be vacated. This victory, despite not guaranteeing the eventual listing of a Grayscale spot Bitcoin ETF, was still greeted with enthusiasm by the community.\n\nMagazine: DeFi Dad, Hall of Flame: Ethereum is \u2018woefully undervalued\u2019 but growing more powerful"

        "content": "The SVM\u2019s enhanced performance has made it Eclipse\u2019s preferred option over the EVM.\n\nEthereum would provide the support for validation on the network.\n\n\u201cBy boosting others, you will boost yourself. A little competition is a good thing, and severe competition is a blessing.\u201d This quote by Jacob Kindleberger seems to be the path that Solana [SOL] wants to follow based on the latest update provided by a new project.\n\nRead Solana\u2019s [SOL] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nSolana for scale, Ethereum for settlement\n\nThe rationale for this conclusion can be found in Eclipse mainnet\u2019s introduction of the Ethereum [ETH] SMV L2. As a modular rollup stack, Eclipse aims to provide settlement, data availability, and high-performance execution for its users.\n\nBecause of this, Solana, which was once dubbed the \u201cEthereum Killer\u201d now has to work in conjunction with Ethereum on Eclipse. According to the Eclipse mainnet disclosure, the SVM, a tag for the Solana Virtual Machine would be the best execution environment for its objective.\n\nIn quick summary, the SVM is the execution infrastructure that enables smart contracts/programs on the network. Unlike the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the SVM provides enhanced performance than EVM, which is the dominant machine standard in the blockchain industry.\n\nSo, Eclipse mainnet concluded that Solana would be very important in enhancing the speed and scale of the project. With respect to fees, the project noted that Solana was the preferred option, explaining that,\n\n\u201cSolana\u2019s amazing work on local fee markets solves this cross-app state contention. In its current implementation, the scheduler prioritizes transactions without conflicts, allowing conflict-free transactions to go through with lower fees.\u201d\n\nTo back up its decision, Eclipse provided the image below, comparing Solana transfers and swaps with others.\n\nSolana wins this round\n\nHowever, the addition of Solana use cases to the Ethereum L2 does not mean that Ethereum would not play any important role in the overall functioning of the project. According to Eclipse, Ethereum\u2019s security and liquidity would be critical to settlement on the network.\n\nFurthermore, the post mentioned that Ethereum would provide the means of validating bridges using the canonical chain. For context, the canonical chain is the authoritative blockchain after a split or hard fork occurs. Eclipse noted that,\n\n\u201cThis allows our users to gain certain security properties from Ethereum. The bridge will validate all Eclipse transactions, preventing the submission of invalid states.\u201d\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the SOL Profit Calculator\n\nAdditionally, Eclipse mentioned that it was not entirely ignoring the EVM. But it also noted that a more performant execution like Solana remains important to the project. While admitting its love for Ethereum innovation, Eclipse also hailed the other, saying,"

        "content": "On Sept. 19, Eclipse announced a new L2 architecture, which will leverage the Solana Virtual Machine while operating on Ethereum, hence bringing the advantage of the former\u2019s speed and scale in transaction settlement.\n\nThe newly promoted L2 architecture aims to redefine the scaling world by touching on areas like Ethereum settlement, execution using SVM, availing data with Celestia, and proving using RISC Zero.\n\nBringing SVM Experience to EVM\n\nAs per the press statement, Eclipse\u2019s new L2 architecture will use the Solana Execution environment, hence optimizing parallel execution implementing local fee markets, resulting in a reduction of chain-wide fee hikes caused by high-demand applications. This feature is afforded through Solana\u2019s parallelized runtime, designed to process conflict-free transactions with lower fees.\n\nAdditionally, Eclipse notes that despite leveraging the SVM, its mainnet will be powered by Neon EVM to bring full EVM support. Neon EVM is a smart contract that can be deployed on any SVM-focused chain to operate the EVM. Eclipse believes this will bring full EVM compatibility into Eclipse Mainnet. The press statement said,\n\n\u201cBecause each Neon EVM instance has its own local fee market, apps can just deploy their own contract to attain the benefits of an app chain without fragmenting UX, security, or liquidity.\u201d\n\nEclipse also mentioned using the Solang compiler to enable the \u201ccompilation of Solidity smart contracts code into SVM bytecode.\u201d\n\nMetamask\u2019s newly launched tech, MetaMask Snaps, will reportedly play a key role in onboarding EVM users to the SVM chain, as they will not need to switch wallets.\n\nFurthermore, Eclipse boasts solutions to some of EVM\u2019s state growth limitations. Unlike EVM, Solana does not need constant Merkle Tree updates for each state update. Every transaction can specify all states needed for execution. Hence, state size will not impact SVM execution.\n\nSeeing that this L2 is designed for Ethereum, the settlement of the Eclipse Mainnet will happen on Ethereum, reinforcing the security properties of Ethereum. Its bridge validates all Eclipse transactions, preventing the submission of invalid states while enhancing censorship resistance.\n\nAssets popular with Ethereum, like DeFi, NFTs, and more, will play a significant role in Eclipse Mainnet.\n\nData Availability and Proving\n\nData in this new system will be available only through Celestia, which extends beyond Ethereum\u2019s current bandwidth. Eclipse believes this will result in a higher TPS.\n\nAnother feature of the new mainnet is Proving similar to Anatoly\u2019s SVM fraud-proof SIMD to avoid reintroducing a Merkle tree into the SVM. The executor will post a list of inputs and outputs for every transaction, confirming that the commitment on Ethereum is correct.\n\nEclipse details more in-depth about the new product, which will bring a whole new meaning to the L2 scaling universe, as per the press statement."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as Grayscale Files For New Ether Futures ETF \u2013 Here\u2019s Where ETH is Headed Next\n\nETH Chart / Source: Adobe\n\nCrypto asset management giant Grayscale just filed paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to create a new Ether (ETH) Futures Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), as per a report by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nGrayscale filed for the ETF under the Securities Act of 1933, having also previously filed for an Ether Futures ETF under the Investment Company Act of 1940.\n\nWhile comparable Bitcoin Futures ETF have been approved by the SEC under both acts, most ETFs are filed under the 1940 act.\n\nReports in the crypto press back in late August suggested there is a strong possibility that the SEC will approve a number of Ether Futures ETFs as soon as October.\n\nThat news made the price of Ether surge at the time amid front-running from traders, because a wider availability of Ether Futures ETFs could indirectly increase demand for the cryptocurrency, assuming institutional investors start buying up Ether Futures ETFs once they go live.\n\nEther was last changing hands around $1,640, just to the north of its 21DMA.\n\nPrice Prediction \u2013 Where Next for Ether (ETH)?\n\nThe fact that Ether looks set to close above its 21DMA following a fairly convincing break above the level in the past two days is a positive for the cryptocurrency\u2019s near-term price outlook.\n\nThe 21DMA had previously been acting as an area of strong resistance for the past more than two-months.\n\nA break above this level sets the stage for a potential rally to the 50DMA just above $1,700 and even the late August highs around $1,740.\n\nAssuming ETH can close above its 21DMA, near-term price predictions are likely to turn modestly more bullish.\n\nBut traders should keep an eye on upcoming macro risk events, such as Wednesday\u2019s rate decision and monetary policy announcement from the US Federal Reserve.\n\nThe central bank isn\u2019t expected to change interest rates, but is expected to signal that more rate hikes remain possible, as well as release a new summary interest rate projections from its policymakers plus new economic forecasts.\n\nThat could impact ETH, depending on how the US bond market and US dollar react \u2013 a dovish meeting (where expectations as to how high interest rates will go/remain fall) would weigh on the yields and US dollar, likely boosting ETH, and vice versa.\n\nEther traders may also remain reluctant to enter big positions in the cryptocurrency as they remain in wait-and-see mode ahead of October\u2019s expected Futures ETF decisions from the SEC.\n\nEther (ETH) Alternative to Consider\n\nOne problem with an Ether Futures ETF is that its buyers won\u2019t be set to benefit from the solid yield they can generate from Ether staking.\n\nTo benefit from Ether staking yields, which are normally in the region of 4%, investors would do better to buy the actual ETH token and set up a staking node, or buy a ETH liquid staking derivative such as stETH.\n\nInvestors interested in a riskier cryptocurrency with a much better staking yield should check out a newly launched token called Bitcoin BSC (BTCBSC).\n\nBitcoin BSC is a BEP-20 token issued on the Binance Smart Chain but with pretty much the exact same tokenomics of Bitcoin, although Bitcoin BSC winds the clock back to 2011, when Bitcoin traded at $1 per token.\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin BSC tokens are currently being sold in presale for $1 each, with over $2 million already raised.\n\nBitcoin BSC holds various advantages over Bitcoin \u2013 it is greener thanks to the Binance Smart Chain\u2019s lower energy consumption and is more readily available for use in the Binance Smart Chain\u2019s growing Decentralized Finance ecosystem.\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin BSC holders can stake their tokens to benefit from BTCBSC issuance according to the same schedule that Bitcoin was on back in 2011.\n\nThat means BTCBSC holders could be looking at double or even triple digit annual yields if they stake their tokens.\n\nA similar project BTC20 \u2013 the exact same concept but issued as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum \u2013 was able to quickly sell out a blockbuster $6 million presale and then post gains of as much as 6x, while BTC20 is still trading above its presale price of $1.\n\nBitcoin BSC is thus an opportunity for those who missed BTC20 to get in early.\n\nBitcoin BSC could do even better than BTC20 given the Binance Smart Chain\u2019s faster transaction speeds and lower fees, making for a better trading and DeFi experience.\n\nInvestors need to move quickly, as the token\u2019s hard cap raise target of just under $4 million will likely soon be reached.\n\nBuy Bitcoin BSC Here\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a significant move reported by PeckShieldAlert, Ethereum creator and blockchain entrepreneur Vitalik Buterin recently executed a substantial transfer of 300 ETH, valued at an impressive $490,000, to the major exchange Kraken. The transaction consisted of two tranches, with 100 ETH and 200 ETH transferred separately. Remarkably, even after this transfer, Buterin's wallet \"0x1Db\" still holds 2,451 ETH, amounting to a staggering $4.04 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis transfer stands out as one of the largest direct transfers from this particular Buterin wallet to an exchange in recent years. Typically, such transfers to exchanges are perceived as potential sell-off events, especially when involving insiders, including Ethereum's founder himself.\n\nWhat is worth noting is the timing of this transfer, which coincides with Ethereum's price demonstrating positive momentum and trading in the green zone. This has led some to wonder if Buterin's decision to move a substantial amount of ETH to an exchange may signal a local peak in Ethereum's price. Crypto enthusiasts have debated whether this move indicates Buterin's intent to cash in on his substantial Ethereum holdings.\n\nETH to USD by CoinMarketCap\n\nButerin's influence in the crypto space is undeniable, and his actions are closely watched by the community. As Ethereum continues to be the market-defining power, every move made by its founder becomes a subject of analysis and speculation. For now, all eyes remain on the Ethereum price chart to see if it reacts to this event."

On Sept. 15, Nethermind, an Ethereum client team, tweeted that an execution layer misconfiguration was the culprit for Holesky\u2019s failed launch.\n\nNethermind said a relaunch would likely take place in one week\u2019s time, suggesting Holesky could go live as early as this Friday. However, Barnabus Busa, a DevOps engineer for the Ethereum Foundation, published a GitHub pull request suggesting the relaunch should occur on September 28.\n\n\u201cIt's extremely likely that we relaunch the network with new genesis files and have the network up ~two weeks from now,\u201d said Paritosh, an Ethereum foundation DevOps engineer.\n\nHolesky is set to replace Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet, which is scheduled to be deprecated next year. Goerli is Ethereum\u2019s longest-running testnet, having launched in 2018. However, since 2022, Goerli has suffered from a shortage of its network token, Goerli ETH (GETH), with developers resorting to purchasing GETH on the open market just to experiment with their code.\n\nGETH is freely distributed in small quantities via faucets, but rocketing demand and network activity gave rise to a market for the testnet token. GETH was changing hands for $0.69 on Feb. 28 and drove more than $1.5M in daily trade volume, drawing criticism from the Ethereum community. GETH last traded for $0.04, according to CoinGecko.\n\nLast month, Ethereum developers decided to mint 1.6B Holesky ETH tokens for the new testnet after determining the network could support 1.4M validators. Holesky is planned to operate until 2028."

        "title": "Injective Unveils inEVM, A Groundbreaking Ethereum Rollup for Hyperscaling Multi VM Development - GlobeNewswire",
        "content": "New York, NY, Sept. 19, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Injective , the blockchain built for finance, today announced the launch of inEVM, the first-ever Ethereum Virtual Machine capable of achieving true composability across Cosmos and Solana. The inEVM network was developed in collaboration with Caldera, a L2 rollup infrastructure platform backed by Sequoia.\n\n\n\nWith inEVM, Ethereum developers gain unprecedented access to Injective's global network and user base, offering a new realm of opportunities to expand the reach of their protocols.\n\n\n\ninEVM is part of Injective\u2019s larger plan to introduce a network of Electro Chains. In essence, this consists of a series of rollups with dedicated VM environments that would cater to the needs of distinct builders while still providing the highest levels of scalability and security. Electro Chains inherit security from Injective while also extending block space available on any one chain which directly contributes to a far more scalable network than what exists in Web3 today.\n\ninEVM touts several major benefits for developers including ultra-fast speeds due to a parallelized structure, instant transaction finality, a modular toolkit, shared liquidity, and composability across the Cosmos IBC universe alongside Solana.\n\nThis latest development follows the recent release of Injective's inSVM (formerly known as \" Cascade \"), the first Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) rollup solution integrated into the larger Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) ecosystem. This innovation has empowered Solana developers to effortlessly migrate their applications to Injective, extending their reach to a broader audience without the need for significant code modifications.\n\ndApps launched on the inEVM layer would be able to compose directly with Cosmos and Solana applications due to Injective\u2019s Electro Chain initiative. As a result, both inter and intra VM interoperability would be achieved by builders on the inEVM layer. This in turn results in a far more seamless development experience devoid of traditional complexities and barriers.\n\nInjective has long been pioneering groundbreaking technology in Web3, and its latest creation, inEVM, is poised to redefine the way Ethereum developers interact with the broader blockchain universe. With inEVM, Ethereum developers can harness the power of solidity to seamlessly deploy their applications into the Injective ecosystem.\n\n\n\nInjective's overarching mission is to democratize the financial future by fostering decentralization across the blockchain landscape. The rise of Layer 1 solutions requires different networks to work together smoothly, and Injective's Electro Chains serve as the conduit that dynamically connects these networks. By enabling developers to swiftly launch their applications on multiple VM environments and simplifying user interaction with Web3, Injective is forging a cohesive, user-centric Web3 environment, where collaboration prevails over competition.\n\n\u201cinEVM will enable Ethereum developers to effortlessly deploy applications across Injective Electro Chains while also tapping into an expansive network of users and liquidity,\u201d said Eric Chen, co-founder and CEO of Injective Labs. \"This marks a significant stride forward for Web3, as we work towards creating a fully integrated ecosystem, where developers and users can maximize the benefits of an optimized infrastructure stack without being hindered by barriers between networks.\u201d\n\nInjective's launch of inEVM underscores its dedication to driving innovation and collaboration in the blockchain space. As the global financial landscape evolves, Injective continues to stand at the forefront, facilitating the growth and development of Web3 finance."

        "title": "Tron edges over Ethereum: What it means for you - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Tron transactions were five times that of Ethereum.\n\nBoth TVLs increased, but Ethereum maintained the top spot.\n\nThe number of transactions on the Tron [TRX] blockchain surpassed that of Ethereum [ETH] five-fold on 17 September, Tron DAO revealed. The DAO, which got its data from Nansen, showed that Tron\u2019s transactions on the said data were 4.5 million.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s TRX\u2019s market cap in ETH terms\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, registered a total of 880,000 transactions. The disparity in transactions meant that there were more people transacting on the Tron blockchain on 20 September, as compared to Ethereum.\n\nTime for a look at data from @nansen_ai. ? ?\ufe0f As of September 17th, daily transactions for TRON and ETH are as follows: TRON: 4.5M daily transactions\n\nETH: 880K daily transactions Lot's of people are using the TRON network! ? For more data, visit: https://t.co/RNkFqeoApH pic.twitter.com/WHRDEuV6Xk \u2014 TRON DAO (@trondao) September 19, 2023\n\n\u201cFast\u201d is the people\u2019s desire\n\nAlthough both blockchains make use of smart contracts, Tron edges out Ethereum with its vital function in gaming and gambling applications. Besides that, the underlying blockchain of Tron allows for faster transactions than Ethereum.\n\nThis capability is a major reason most stablecoin transactions, especially from Tether [USDT], pass through the TRC-20 token standard than Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20.\n\nFor instance, Tron\u2019s block length and transaction cost allow it to process 2,000 transactions per second. Meanwhile, Ethereum is far behind with higher gas fees and transaction speed that does not supersede the pace of Tron.\n\nAnother reason Tron has been able to beat Ethereum to the higher transaction number is its adoption rate in Asia. To back this up, a Chainalysis report in 2020 referred to East Asia as the world\u2019s biggest stablecoins market.\n\nAt that time, Tether, which is the largest stablecoin per market cap, was also the most used stablecoin in the region. While that has not changed, traders in the region also prefer to employ the TRC-20 model of transacting due to its lightning speed.\n\nAgain, Tron trumps Ethereum\n\nApart from leading Ethereum in terms of transactions, Tron has also been the driving force leading the revival of the DeFi TVL. For the uninitiated, DeFi\u2019s overall TVL has not been performing well over the last few weeks.\n\nThis was evident in the notable decrease in most protocols and chains. However, at press time, almost every chain had recorded a significant increase in TVL, with Tron\u2019s 20.74% increase being the highest in the last seven days\n\nThe TVL is a metric used to measure the total value of assets locked to staked in a particular platform. When the TVL increases, it means the project involved has become more trustworthy.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 TRXs worth today?\n\nHowever, a decrease in the TVL implies that market participants perceive the DeFi platform or dApp to be less trustworthy. Hence, this results in a decrease in smart contracts\u2019 liquidity attached to it.\n\nBut in Tron\u2019s case, its TVL rose to 6.66 billion, while Ethereum had a higher TVL of $21.18 billion. However, the latter only registered a 7.41% increase within the same timeframe, Tron increased by double digits."

        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s exchange deposit surge: Uncovering trends, outflows, and price upticks - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Exchange deposits of Ethereum have spiked to a nine-month high\n\nETH saw a slight uptrend in price but was still stuck in a bear trend\n\nEthereum has seen a notable surge in exchange deposits, marking a level of activity not seen in months. However, amidst this surge, which exchange flow has consistently maintained the highest flow in recent days?\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price prediction 2023-24\n\nEthereum deposits spike\n\nAccording to a tweet by Glassnode Alerts, there has been a significant upswing in ETH deposits. In fact, at the time of writing writing, exchange deposits had exceeded 161,000, marking the highest level observed in over nine months.\n\nPrior to this, the highest deposit level recorded on the chart was approximately 98,000, and this was in January.\n\nTo provide some context to the same, it is worth noting that Ethereum typically witnessed an average exchange deposit of around 30,000, excluding occasional spikes. This context emphasizes the significance of the recent spike and prompts questions about its impact on the flow of Ethereum.\n\nAnalyzing the Ethereum exchange flow\n\nDespite the notable increase in exchange deposits, as illustrated by Glassnode\u2019s chart, it appears that more Ethereum has been exiting exchanges. According to the Netflow chart provided by CryptoQuant, over the past few days, Ethereum outflows have been surpassing inflows.\n\nThis is a sign that even though significant volumes of ETH were being deposited into exchanges, an even greater amount was being withdrawn.\n\nThe netflow chart revealed that the last instance of inflows surpassing outflows happened around 15 September. At press time, however, the netflow is -18,223. Here\u2019s the caveat though \u2013 The netflow direction may change by the end of the day, but the dominance of outflows remains apparent.\n\nSpike in volume?\n\nExamining the volume metric via Santiment also revealed fluctuations in Ethereum\u2019s recent trading activity. The chart indicated that Ethereum\u2019s trading volume recorded a decline, dropping to approximately $2.7 billion on 17 September from over $4 billion the day before.\n\nHowever, at the time of writing, the volume had rebounded to surpass $3 billion, signalling a slight hike on the chart.\n\nIt remains uncertain whether the surge in exchange deposits played a role in this volume uptick, but it\u2019s certainly a plausible factor to consider.\n\n\u2013 How much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today\n\nETH\u2019s uptrend not strong enough\n\nFollowing two consecutive days of a slight price decline, Ethereum has appreciated on its daily price chart. At press time, it was trading at approximately $1,633, reflecting a modest hike of less than 1%.\n\nNotably, the short-term Moving Average (yellow line) continued to act as resistance, particularly around the $1,700-price level. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) remained below the neutral line, indicative of its ongoing bearish trend."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s NFT market faced declining trading volumes, leading to concerns about its future vitality.\n\nPFP NFTs witnessed significant price drops, which reflected the changing market preferences.\n\nIn recent times, the NFT market has seen new players like friends.tech invigorate the space, but Ethereum [ETH]\u2019s NFT ecosystem tells a different story.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nDeclining interest in Ethereum NFTs\n\nData from Messari painted a grim picture, with Ethereum NFT trading volumes hitting rock bottom. This decline indicated a significant drop in user engagement and transaction activity.\n\nThe consequences of this dip in interest are far-reaching. Ethereum\u2019s once-thriving PFP (Profile Picture) NFTs, which gained immense popularity, were facing significant price drops.\n\nAdditionally, many of these collections witnessed their floor prices plummet by at least 30%, leaving collectors and investors concerned about the falling value of their holdings.\n\nEven blue-chip NFTs on the Ethereum network weren\u2019t immune to this trend. Interest was waning, and this was mirrored in the falling fees on the network.\n\nThe decline in transaction fees indicates reduced activity and demand for Ethereum NFTs, suggesting that the once-booming market is losing its luster.\n\nWhat does the decline suggest?\n\nAs per Glassnode\u2019s data, total fees paid plummeted to an 8-month low of 85.550 ETH. Reduced activity translates to reduced fees, pointing to a diminished appeal of Ethereum\u2019s NFT offerings.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Total Fees Paid (7d MA) just reached a 8-month low of 85.550 ETH Previous 8-month low of 87.705 ETH was observed on 11 September 2023 View metric:https://t.co/wS0nd9YFUQ pic.twitter.com/ySzKH68ik4 \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) September 18, 2023\n\nThis downturn wasn\u2019t limited to NFTs alone; Ethereum\u2019s price was on a decline over the past month. At present, it was trading at $1651, reflecting a notable drop. This price decrease affected the overall sentiment around Ethereum and its NFT market.\n\nAccompanying this price dip was a concerning trend in retail interest. Glassnode\u2019s data revealed that the number of addresses holding 0.1+ Coins recently hit a 1-month low, signifying a falling retail presence in Ethereum.\n\nFewer retail investors may impact the broader adoption and popularity of the Ethereum network.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nTraders remain cautious\n\nTraders are navigating these uncertain waters, and the put-to-call ratio on most exchanges has experienced a decline. This ratio indicates the balance between options traders who are betting on a price increase (call options) and those betting on a price decrease (put options).\n\nConcurrently, Ethereum\u2019s Implied Volatility (IV) was on the rise at press time. IV measures the market\u2019s expectation of future volatility. An increase in IV suggests that market participants anticipate greater price fluctuations, which can be both an opportunity and a risk for traders."

If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThe crypto market has been rebounding from the crypto winter this year, but it hasn\u2019t been a smooth ride upward for many tokens. Lately, every week of gains seems to be matched by a week of losses.\n\nThat\u2019s been especially true this week for major tokens like Ethereum and Litecoin. Ethereum is down 1.5% in the past 24 hours, eliminating the gains from an otherwise bullish week. Meanwhile, Litecoin is down 4.6%.\n\nThere doesn\u2019t appear to be breaking news or a significant tweet causing the decline in these market dominating tokens. Instead, the root of the slide appears to be a general bearishness about the crypto market over the past day.\n\nSideways Price Movement on the Horizon for Crypto Majors\n\nWhile prices have been hit hard in the past day, the news around crypto majors isn\u2019t all bad. Ethereum is only down 2.50% over the past month and Litecoin is down just 0.3%.\n\nHowever, the horizontal and slightly downward movement shows that a malaise remains that the crypto market is having trouble shaking.\n\nThe industry has been hit hard by rising interest rates, increasing regulatory scrutiny, and continuing fallout from major scandals like the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. Institutional investors remain wary of the crypto market and many firms appear to be sitting on the sidelines, waiting to see what happens next.\n\nThe sideways price trend could remain in place for a while to come. Both Ethereum and Litecoin are sitting in between support and resistance levels, so there isn\u2019t a consolidation happening before a potential breakout.\n\nAs the past month shows, prices are likely to keep oscillating in the absence of a major news event.\n\nBitcoin BSC Bucks Market Trend with $3.6 Million Raised, 92% Sold Out of Presale Soft Cap\n\nAlthough crypto majors are struggling, some emerging crypto tokens are faring better. Bitcoin BSC has raised more than $3.6 million through its ongoing crypto presale and is now 92% sold out of its soft cap.\n\nThe project\u2019s success is thanks in large part to the advantages it delivers over the original Bitcoin. Unlike BTC, which runs on the Bitcoin blockchain, Bitcoin BSC is built on Binance\u2019s BNB Smart Chain.\n\nThe BNB Smart Chain is hundreds of times faster than the Bitcoin blockchain at processing transactions, making it more suitable for DeFi, trading, and more. It\u2019s also far cheaper, enabling investors in Bitcoin BSC to send tokens without paying exorbitant blockchain fees.\n\nThe difference in price could allow Bitcoin BSC to be widely used for everyday peer-to-peer payments\u2014something that Bitcoin has long promised, but never fully achieved.\n\nAnother major benefit to Bitcoin BSC is that investors can stake the $BTCBSC token. This not only helps validate transactions on the network, but also offers stakers a chance to earn additional $BTCBSC.\n\nThe token is designed so that staking rewards are paid out every 10 minutes, on the same schedule as Bitcoin block mining rewards. Nearly 70% of the total token supply is locked for staking rewards, so Bitcoin BSC will pay out rewards until around 2140.\n\nThe amount of $BTCBSC stakers earn is directly proportional to their fraction of tokens in the staking pool. So, early investors can earn huge rewards when the circulating supply of $BTCBSC is still very small.\n\nBitcoin BSC is priced at only $0.99 during the presale, a price Bitcoin last touched in 2011. So, this is a chance to turn back the clock and invest early in a potentially huge cryptocurrency before its price skyrockets.\n\nInvestors have to hurry, though\u2014once Bitcoin BSC reaches its soft cap, the presale could close at any time.\n\nVisit Bitcoin BSC Presale"

Instead, it suggests that whales are probably patient and on the lookout for a better accumulation entry.\n\n? #Bitcoin continues to trade between $26K-$27K, and #Ethereum at $1.6K to 1.65K. #Crypto's top market caps' $100K+ transaction levels are at their lowest levels of 2023 right now. This is a sign of whales likely waiting, and not necessarily disinterest. https://t.co/FKfhB5X3Yh pic.twitter.com/m9990wqlpM \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) September 18, 2023\n\nThis development was further reinforced by the balance of addresses. At the time of writing, Ethereum addresses holding between 10,000 to 10 million coins have their balance shredded. The fall in the balance means that a lot of whales have cashed in on a part of their holdings.\n\nAlso, since the profit-taking, the whales have refrained from accumulating. It was a similar case with the number of whales within the same group. Based on Santiment\u2019s data, the number of addresses holding 10,000 to 10 million ETH has either flatlined or decreased since June.\n\nNo relief in sight?\n\nInterestingly, traders also seem to be on the same page as whales as far as ETH\u2019s next direction is concerned. This conclusion was made based on the funding rate at press time. Funding rates are periodic payments made between longs and shorts.\n\nWhen the funding rate is positive, it means that longs are paying a funding fee to shorts to keep their contracts open. In this case, the average trader sentiment is bullish. However, a negative funding rate means that sentiment is bearish and short positions are dominant in the market.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH\u2019s funding rate had fallen into the negative zone. This means that traders expect ETH to drop below $1,640 in the short term.\n\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s a chance that the percentage of ETH holders in loss may increase if the altcoin\u2019s value decreases. At press time, the daily on-chain\n\ntransaction volume\n\nin profit was 330,000. On the other hand, the daily on-chain transaction volume in loss was 511,000.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nThese two metrics show the aggregate amount of coins/tokens across all transactions on the network that moved in profit or loss for a given asset in an interval.\n\nAs it stands, short-term holders of ETH may have no other option than to wait for a relief period. And to those who can\u2019t tolerate another decline, they could end up with a loss."

However, whales remained uninterested.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nEthereum whales get cold feet\n\nEthereum whales, who had long held their positions, began to offload their holdings recently. Lookonchain\u2019s data highlighted a wallet that had been dormant for four years, suddenly selling off all 2,591 ETH for a substantial $4.18 million in stablecoins.\n\nA wallet that had been dormant for 4 years sold all 2,591 $ETH for $4.18M stablecoins 6 hours ago.https://t.co/et78rXHG5u pic.twitter.com/pJanMLxwA3 \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 20, 2023\n\nThe trend wasn\u2019t limited to isolated sales. Glassnode\u2019s data revealed a significant reduction in whale holdings. The number of addresses holding more than 1,000 ETH hit a five-year low, with just 6,082 such addresses remaining at press time.\n\nThis indicated a shift in strategy for major ETH holders.\n\nThis sudden shift in whale behavior raised questions about its potential impact on ETH\u2019s price. With large holders selling off, it could lead to downward pressure on ETH.\n\nDevelopers forge ahead\n\nMeanwhile, despite the whale-related concerns, Ethereum developers remained committed to improving the network. In a recent developer call, updates on Ethereum\u2019s Devnet-8, a test network centered around Dencun, were shared.\n\nThis testnet, near finalization, had various client teams, including Prysm, Besu, and Nethermind, actively pushing updates for experimentation.\n\nDevelopers also tackled network challenges head-on. They discussed a proposal to limit Ethereum\u2019s validator sets\u2019 growth rate, initially capping the churn limit at 12 validator entries but later adjusting it to eight.\n\nThis adjustment aimed to forestall potential issues arising from Ethereum\u2019s expanding staking system. With broad developer support, the proposal is set to be included in the upcoming Dencun update, with code finalization in progress.\n\nHow is Ethereum doing?\n\nAt the time of reporting, Ethereum\u2019s price was $1,634.14. However, trading volume had dipped by 16% in the preceding 24 hours, reflecting some uncertainty among traders.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nEthereum\u2019s DeFi activity also exhibited signs of a slowdown, particularly in its Total Value Locked (TVL). While Ethereum\u2019s price dynamics and whale activities remained in focus, the DeFi sector witnessed a notable reduction in TVL.\n\nThis indicated changing dynamics in the DeFi landscape that could have negative implications for Ethereum\u2019s role in decentralized finance in the future."

        "content": "Mark Cuban: Do you want to get your Ethereum back from the hacker?\n\nDear Mr. Cuban,\n\nLate last week, I read that you were the victim of a Metamask phishing scam in which hackers stole $870,000 of your Ethereum blockchain assets.\n\nDespite pervasive myths to the contrary, I think it\u2019s important you know that you can recover all of your stolen coins and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). I also think it\u2019s important that someone of your status does so, setting an example to the rest of the industry and sending a clear message to thieves: digital assets can be recovered, so there\u2019s no point in stealing them.\n\nYou once said, \u201cthe whole point of blockchain is that it\u2019s public,\u201d and that\u2019s true. However, blockchain was also designed with digital asset recovery in mind. Did you know that the original Bitcoin had an alert key functionality to allow legal orders to be broadcast across the network, ordering nodes to freeze and reallocate UTXOs?\n\nThe digital asset recovery process can help victims like you recover their property. Allow me to give you a brief overview of how it works.\n\nHow digital asset recovery works\n\nI don\u2019t know if you have heard of Dr. Craig Wright or what your opinions on him are. Regardless, he is currently in the process of exposing one of the biggest blockchain myths: that stolen digital assets can\u2019t be recovered.\n\nLike you, Dr. Wright was the victim of a hack, and while it was different in nature from what happened to you, the result was the same: he lost coins of substantial monetary value.\n\nHowever, rather than accept the theft, Dr. Wright set out to prove a point: property rights apply to digital assets, and coins can be recovered. His case is currently in the U.K. courts, and while it will take some time to play out, I wanted to explain to you how the process works.\n\nStep one is to prove you own certain digital assets. I\u2019m certain your team can easily find the transactions whereby you either bought or received the tokens you lost. This is the evidence required to prove this is your property, and thus your rights apply.\n\nThe second step is to obtain a court order or equivalent instructing nodes to reassign the coins. Despite the false rhetoric about them being anonymous and decentralized, they are legal entities, and they will comply with orders issued by courts in jurisdictions like the United States or the European Union.\n\nAfter this, the mechanism by which the process plays out will differ from blockchain to blockchain, but in the end, the stolen coins and tokens will be reassigned to your wallet, and the blockchain will be appended to reflect this. This is not a transaction reversal; it is a new transaction, and, like all of them, it will appear time-stamped on the immutable public blockchain.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in knowing how this process applies to BSV blockchain and how it might work on other blockchains with a few minor differences, check out this video.\n\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nWhy it is important to recover your digital assets\n\nMr. Cuban, you don\u2019t need me to lecture you on the virtues of capitalism. It\u2019s that great economic system that has allowed you to rise from humble beginnings to billionaire businessman.\n\nI\u2019m also sure you understand that capitalism can not exist without property rights. The concept of private property and the legal system that allows people to protect what\u2019s theirs is the foundation upon which the system of free enterprise rests. This is why it\u2019s so important for one of capitalism\u2019s global icons to defend these rights.\n\nThe digital currency and blockchain industries have awesome potential. New business models can be created, cumbersome administrative processes and the bureaucracy that comes with them can be eliminated, and a more transparent, fair world can become reality. The economy can benefit greatly from this technology.\n\nHowever, none of this is possible if thieves can simply steal people\u2019s money with no possibility of recovery. Businesses and individuals need to have confidence in blockchain technology, and you have a unique opportunity to prove to the world that, far from being a tool for criminals to steal with impunity, blockchain is a tool that can bolster and protect property rights.\n\nWhile the choice is ultimately yours, I urge you to make an example out of the digital bandits that stole your money and set the record straight: blockchains are not tools for criminals, property rights apply to everyone who uses them, and they can be protected.\n\nBest of luck in recovering what is rightfully yours, and if you need further assistance, the CoinGeek team can point you in the right direction.\n\nWatch: Digital Asset Recovery \u2013 Freezing and Seizing Lost and Stolen Assets\n\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens were trading higher on Wednesday ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting due later today, where the US central bank is expected to make no changes in the interest rates. The ether-to-bitcoin ratio dropped to a 14-month low. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, moved coins to crypto exchanges, possibly as a prelude to selling, said experts.\n\n\n\nBitcoin posted strong gains as the largest crypto token surged more than a per cent, regaining $27,000-levels. However, its largest peer Ethereum, inched up maringally, but did not race-past $1,650-mark. Price action in the altcoins remained on the positive side in the early hours.\n\n\n\nBitcoin is currently trading above the $27,000 mark, and this price surge could be because Japan's leading investment bank, Nomura, is making headlines by introducing a Bitcoin-based fund tailored specifically for institutional investors, said Edul Patel, CEO & Co-founder at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"Market sentiments currently range from neutral to bullish as all eyes remain fixed on the forthcoming US Federal Reserve\u2019s FOMC decision regarding federal interest rates. Meanwhile, Ethereum is trading above the $1,600 level. Interestingly, Grayscale recently made an application for a new Ethereum Futures ETF to the US SEC,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring a few exceptions, all top crypto tokens were trading higher on Wednesday. Toncoin surged more than 3 per cent, while XRP and Polygon gained more than 2 per cent each. Among the laggards, Solana and Cardano shed about half-a-per cent each in the early hours.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly higher, rising to $1.08 trillion-mark, as it rose about a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes dropped over 8 per cent to $27.71 billion.\n\n\n\nBitcoin's value has increased by over 1 per cent. Currently, it is trading at its 50-day Simple Moving Average, which has previously acted as a resistance level. It's worth noting that Bitcoin's open interest has also seen a recent increase, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\n\n\"Furthermore, Citi is making significant advancements in its services for institutional clients by embracing blockchain technology. Citi Token Services, introduced on Monday, allows clients to tokenize their deposits for instant global transfers.

        "content": "Wormhole has integrated Circle\u2019s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP), allowing USD Coin (USDC) to be transferred between Ethereum, Avalanche, Arbitrum and Optimism via Wormhole-based bridges, according to a Sept. 20 announcement.\n\nThe new feature is available to end-users via the Portal bridge, and developers can integrate it into their own apps using Wormhole Connect.\n\nPortal USDC bridge. Source: Portal\n\nThe Wormhole team claimed that the new integration will reduce liquidity issues and user confusion. \u201cOn these new and emerging chains, multiple versions of these bridged USDC tokens can exist,\u201d it stated, \u201cwhich can lead to fragmented liquidity, poor pricing, and a confusing experience for users and developers alike.\u201d CCTP will help fix this problem by \u201ccreating a natively cross-chain USDC that can be burned and minted across connected chains,\u201d it stated.\n\nWhen Circle first issued USDC, it was only available on Ethereum. If a user wanted to transfer USDC to another chain, they needed to use a bridge to lock up their native USDC on Ethereum and mint a derivative version on the other chain. However, multiple bridging protocols with various derivative versions of USDC could sometimes cause confusion among end-users.\n\nIn 2021, Circle launched its stablecoin on a second chain, Stellar. It continued to launch on additional chains afterward, bringing the number of compatible networks to 14 as of Sept. 20.\n\nBut for a user to transfer native USDC from one network to another, they still needed to deposit their coins to a Circle partner\u2019s account and then withdraw them to another network using that account. Partially because of this complexity, many users continued to use bridged versions of the coin instead of its native version.\n\nRelated: Stablecoin depegging plagued USDC and DAI more than others: Analysts\n\nOn April 26, Circle launched CCTP, which is a set of smart contracts and an application programming interface (API) that can be used to burn USDC on one chain and have it be re-minted on another chain without the user needing to deposit to a Circle partner account.\n\nAt the time of its launch, CCTP only allowed transfers between Ethereum and Avalanche or vice-versa. Since then, it\u2019s been expanded to support Optimism and Arbitrum networks as well. Circle plans to add additional networks in 2023, according to the protocol\u2019s documents.\n\nThe Sept. 20 announcement states that CCTP has now been integrated into the Wormhole bridge interface, allowing Wormhole users to transfer native USDC between CCTP-supported chains for the first time. These networks currently include Ethereum, Optimism, Avalanche and Arbitrum.\n\nWormhole is not the only bridge that has implemented or intends to integrate with CCTP. Wanchan provides a similar feature, and according to Circle\u2019s April 26 announcement, Celer, Hyperlane, LayerZero and LI.FI have also stated that they intend to implement it soon."

        "title": "ETH Price Bulls Ready To Defend $1,600 Support - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price has steadied its bullish outlook this week despite worrying sentiments over a large transfer of the leading smart contracts token to a major exchange. After bagging 3% in gains over the last week, ETH trades at $1,634 on Wednesday.\n\nThe crypto market, which has surprisingly sustained a positive outlook, with Bitcoin soaring by 5% to trade at $27,156, is awaiting for the decision on the September monetary policy from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin have covered considerable upside ground since the release of the United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) a week ago, which revealed that inflation was still an issue.\n\nAn interest rate hike is the most likely option as the Federal Reserve seeks to curb the skyrocketing inflation mainly caused by a persistent increase in global crude oil prices.\n\nOn the other hand, the crypto market has over the last few months shown commendable resilience against interest rate hikes. Hence, investors are likely to keep a positive outlook regardless of the outcome of the FOMC meeting.\n\nThe Odds Of Ethereum Price Rallying To $3,325\n\nEthereum price bulls face one crucial stumbling block between $1,650 and$1,700. A successful break and hold would confirm the breakout to $1,800 and subsequently trigger a buying spree due to an enhanced market structure for gains past $2,000.\n\nAccording to the weekly chart, ETH now sits on top of one of the bullish market indicators; the 200-weekly Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (purple) at $1,626. Every time Ethereum price breaks above this level, a rally ensues before profit-booking activities dampen the uptrend.\n\nTraders must, however, realize that the 200-weekly EMA is not enough to launch Ethereum price into the anticipated rally. Therefore, it must be a collective effort among the bulls to defend the support at $1,600 and push for the repossession of the 21-weekly EMA (red) and the 100-weekly EMA (blue).\n\nWith all three moving averages serving as support, bulls will have a chance to push for a larger breakout above a forming ascending triangle pattern.\n\nA breakout from this pattern would occur after ETH price pushes above resistance at $2,100. It would be accompanied by a spike in volume, calling for buy orders placed above the resistance.\n\nThe breakout target, 58% to $3,325 is the distance equivalent to the height of the triangle extrapolated above the breakout point.\n\nSome traders may want to confirm the rally with a buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. Such a call manifests with the blue MACD line crossing above the red signal line and the momentum indicator generally slopes upward.\n\nLarge Holders Send ETH To Exchanges\n\nOn-chain transaction trackers have revealed a trend where whales aka large holders are sending large amounts of ETH to exchanges. Ethereum worth roughly $60 million has made it from rather dormant wallets to exchange platforms amid fears of the impact the transfers may have on the price.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is reported to have transferred 300 ETH worth approximately $492,000 to the Kraken exchange on Tuesday. Although this single transaction might not impact ETH price, it has spurred discussions among enthusiasts, considering Buterin\u2019s position in the community.\n\nAnother notable transfer worth around $50 million was deposited to several exchanges including OKX, Binance, and KuCoin over the last five days, according to the blockchain data tracker Lookonchain.\n\nA whale that had been dormant for 2 years woke up 4 days ago and transferred 10K $ETH ($16.5M) out. Then deposited 10K $ETH($16.5M) to #Binance, #OKX and #KuCoin via 3 addresses in the past 4 days. And the whale transferred 10K $ETH ($16.5M) out again just now. pic.twitter.com/YhuIJegPtv \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 19, 2023\n\nThat\u2019s not all, there was another transaction worth $10 million to Kraken by a crypto wallet that participated in the protocol\u2019s ICO 9 years ago.\n\nA whale deposited 6,000 $ETH ($9.96M) into #Kraken 50 minutes ago. This whale is an Ethereum ICO participant, receiving 254,908 $ETH($422.6M currently), the ETH ICO price is ~$0.31.https://t.co/f0Ob9tqPqc pic.twitter.com/n3aj96tA31 \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 18, 2023\n\nTransfers to exchanges often mean that investors are getting ready to sell, which explains the spike in speculation over the recent whale transfers.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Attempts Recovery But the Downside Remains - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $1,638, 0.3% over the last 24 hours and 5.6% on the week. The appearance of a Doji candlestick on the daily chart points to the ongoing battle for control between buyers and sellers. The intensity of this fight is reinforced by the increase in the daily trading volume which is up more than 56% on the day, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nEthereum Faces Stiff Resistance at $1,700\n\nAfter establishing support at the $1,550 demand zone on Sept. 11, Ether began recovering, rising 7.7% to a high of $1,670 reached on Monday. The largest altcoin by market value has been consolidating below the $1,650 supplier zone over the past few days.\n\nThis consolidation is validated by the horizontal price action, the flattening of the moving averages, and the sideways movement of the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The price strength at 47 close to the middle line adds credence to the ongoing fight between the buyers and the sellers.\n\nEthereum\u2019s ranging price action has traders frustrated, and whales are sitting on the sidelines biding their time. If the buyers win the ongoing fight, ETH could rise to confront resistance from the $1,700 resistance level, embraced by the SuperTrend indicator\u2019s red line and the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA).\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nThe $1,700 supply zone appears to be a very tough barrier to overcome. The Ethereum price has been sealed below this level since mid-August. Support from the wider market would be needed to break this barrier.\n\nIf this happens, the 100-day SMA and the 200-day SMA at $1,783 and $1,802, respectively would be the next hurdles to overcome. Shattering these roadblocks would set ETH on a recovery path toward the coveted $2,000 psychological level.\n\nThe SuperTrend indicator was still negative since moving above the price on Aug. 17. Note that as long as this chart overlay indicator continues to close above the price, the overhead pressure will remain, pulling Ether lower and lower.\n\nAs such, a drop below the ascending trendline at $1,620 would suggest the inability of the buyers to sustain the higher levels. The resultant selling pressure could pull Etereum first toward the $1,550 support level and later to $1,500. This would represent an 8.5% drop from the current price.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Grayscale, a leading cryptocurrency investment firm, has revealed its decision to relinquish all rights to the Ethereum tokens known as ETHPoW, which are associated with the post-merge proof-of-work (PoW) protocol. Effective from the record date of September 18, Grayscale permanently forfeited all rights to ETHPoW tokens on behalf of its shareholders.\n\nFollowing a thorough evaluation, Grayscale determined that these tokens lacked sufficient liquidity and lacked support from the custodian of the products. As a result, they stated, \u201cexercising the rights to acquire and sell the ETHPoW tokens was deemed impractical,\u201d and on behalf of the shareholders as of the record date, Grayscale is renouncing these rights to the assets.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s decision to relinquish rights for ETHPoW tokens comes just over a year after the Ethereum Merge, which shook up the Ethereum ecosystem on September 15, 2022. This transformative event marked a clear shift from the traditional proof-of-work (PoW) to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. As a result, the Ethereum blockchain underwent a division, paving the way for the main PoS-based Ether and the secondary PoW-based EthereumPoW (ETHW) tokens.\n\nIn contrast to Grayscale, some cryptocurrency investment firms, like ETC Group, attempted to introduce specialized exchange-traded products (ETPs) based on Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Work (PoW) system. However, ETC Group decided to discontinue its PoW-based ZETW ETP just six weeks after its launch, citing a lack of suitable custody providers as the reason.\n\nThe news of Grayscale\u2019s decision regarding ETHW came a day before they announced their intention to launch a new Ether (ETH) futures exchange-traded fund, with the ticker symbol ETH.\n\nOn September 19, the firm filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to seek approval for listing and trading shares of the Grayscale Ethereum Futures Trust (ETH) ETF on the New York Stock Exchange under Arca Rule 8.200-E.\n\nRead more:\n\nAavegotchi unveils game center: a hub for Gotchi gaming\n\nFTX sues Sam Bankman-fried\u2019s parents for mishandling millions"

        "content": "The long-awaited approval of a Bitcoin ETF in the United States could have far-reaching implications for the cryptocurrency market. While Bitcoin undoubtedly takes center stage, the ripple effect of such approval could extend to other cryptocurrencies. Ethereum (ETH), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and the promising newcomer, Kangamoon (KANG) \u2013 may also experience significant surges.\n\nSummary\n\nShiba Inu positions itself for strong growth\n\nEthereum price prediction\n\nKangamoon projected to dominate the P2E NFT gaming market\n\nDon\u2019t Miss Out On The Kangamoon (KANG) Presale \u2013 Reserve Your Spot!\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB): Strong Growth Potential\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) has made waves with its charismatic branding and an ever-growing community of supporters.\n\nThe approval of a Bitcoin ETF could further legitimize cryptocurrencies in the eyes of institutional investors and the general public. As a result, the broader crypto market, including meme coins like Shiba Inu, might experience increased attention and investment.\n\nThe strong community backing and exciting developments, such as Shibaswap 2.0 and the TREAT reward token, position the Shiba Inu coin for potential growth. Not only that, experts remain bullish for the Shiba Inu coin. In fact, they forecast that the Shiba Inu price will sit between $0.00000946 and $0.00001078 within Q4 of 2023.\n\nEthereum (ETH): A Crypto Giant\n\nEthereum (ETH) has always been pivotal in the crypto ecosystem. If a Bitcoin ETF gains approval, it could set a precedent for further cryptocurrency ETFs, potentially including Ethereum.\n\nEthereum\u2019s significance lies in its smart contract capabilities and vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). An ETF approval could bring fresh investment into the Ethereum network, supporting its ongoing upgrades. Thus driving further Ethereum adoption.\n\nRegarding Ethereum price predictions, market analysts forecast that the value will surge to $2,335.71 by the end of 2023.\n\nKangamoon (KANG): A Meme Coin With a Unique Twist\n\nKangamoon (KANG) will be a newcomer who brings an innovative twist to meme coins. This upcoming project aims to merge gaming and cryptocurrency, offering a unique play-to-earn experience. If a Bitcoin ETF receives the green light, it could surge Kangamoon interest as well.\n\nIt takes its inspiration from the world of memes and infuses it with the adrenaline-pumping world of boxing. At the heart of this crypto sensation is Kangamoon, a spirited kangaroo with an insatiable passion for boxing. Taking on the role of Kangamoon, players embark on an all-immersive journey where they can fight with players from all over the globe.\n\nWhat sets Kangamoon apart is its commitment to the play-to-earn concept. In the Kangamoon gaming universe, players can earn virtual currency and rare in-game items through their skills and dedication. Winning matches and participating in special events are all avenues to accumulating rewards, which can be sold or traded on its marketplace.\n\nIn sum, Kangamoon will be fresh air in the crypto space. Currently, one KANG native token costs only $0.005. Unlike Shiba Inu and Ethereum, KANG taps into the gaming market (seeing $200B in yearly revenue as per Newzoo). Thus, its long-term growth potential is outstanding. As a result, market analysts predict a 22x value growth before its presale finishes.\n\nDiscover the Exciting Opportunities of the Kangamoon (KANG) Presale Today!\n\nWebsite: https://Kangamoon.com/\n\nJoin Our Telegram Community: https://t.me/Kangamoonofficial\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ethereum Co-founder backs Ethereum scaling network Layer N - Tekedia",
        "content": "Layer N, a decentralized network that aims to improve the scalability and performance of Ethereum, has raised $20 million in a Series A funding round led by Founders Fund, the venture capital firm founded by Peter Thiel. The funding round also saw participation from other prominent investors, such as Polychain Capital, Coinbase Ventures, Pantera Capital, and Framework Ventures.\n\nLayer N is based on the concept of sharding, which divides the network into smaller and parallel shards that can process transactions faster and cheaper than the main chain. Layer N also supports cross-shard communication and cross-chain bridges, enabling seamless interaction between different shards and other blockchains.\n\nEthereum 2.0 is the upcoming upgrade of the Ethereum network, which also adopts sharding as a scalability solution. Ethereum 2.0 will consist of a main chain called the Beacon Chain, which coordinates the activity of 64 shards, and a set of execution layers, which run the smart contracts and state transitions. Ethereum 2.0 will also introduce proof-of-stake as a consensus mechanism, replacing the current proof-of-work system.\n\nHow does Layer N compare to Ethereum 2.0? we will explore some of the similarities and differences between the two platforms and discuss their advantages and disadvantages for developers and users.\n\nSimilarities:\n\nBoth Layer N and Ethereum 2.0 use sharding as a way to increase the throughput and scalability of the network. Sharding allows parallel processing of transactions, reducing congestion and fees on the main chain.\n\nBoth Layer N and Ethereum 2.0 support cross-shard and cross-chain communication, enabling interoperability between different shards and other blockchains. This allows for more complex and diverse applications that can leverage the strengths of different platforms.\n\nBoth Layer N and Ethereum 2.0 are compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which means that existing smart contracts and tools can be easily ported to either platform. This lowers the entry barrier for developers and users who want to migrate or experiment with new platforms.\n\nDifferences:\n\nLayer N uses a hybrid consensus model that combines proof-of-work and proof-of-stake, while Ethereum 2.0 uses pure proof-of-stake. Proof-of-work is a more secure but more energy-intensive way of validating transactions, while proof-of-stake is a more efficient but less decentralized way of reaching consensus. Layer N claims that its hybrid model offers the best of both worlds, balancing security and efficiency, while Ethereum 2.0 argues that proof-of-stake is sufficient for ensuring security and decentralization.\n\nLayer N has a fixed number of shards (128), while Ethereum 2.0 has a variable number of shards (64 initially but can change dynamically). Layer N claims that its fixed sharding scheme simplifies the design and implementation of the platform, while Ethereum 2.0 claims that its variable sharding scheme allows for more flexibility and adaptability to changing network conditions.\n\nLayer N has a native token called LYN, which is used for paying fees, staking and governance, while Ethereum 2.0 uses ETH as its native token for the same purposes. LYN is a new token that has to establish its value and utility in the market, while ETH is an established token that has a large and loyal user base.\n\nLayer N is one of the projects that leverages the concept of rollups, a layer 2 solution that bundles multiple transactions into a single one and executes them on a sidechain, before settling them on the main Ethereum chain. This reduces the congestion and fees on the Ethereum network, which has been struggling to cope with the high demand from various applications, especially decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nLayer N claims to offer a unique approach to rollups, by combining zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and optimistic rollups. ZKPs are cryptographic techniques that allow users to prove the validity of their transactions without revealing any details, while optimistic rollups assume that transactions are valid unless someone challenges them. Layer N says that its hybrid solution can achieve higher throughput, lower latency, and better security than other rollup implementations.\n\nLayer N also boasts a strong team of developers and researchers, who have contributed to various projects in the Ethereum ecosystem, such as Optimism, StarkWare, and zkSync. The team says that it plans to use the new funding to expand its team, launch its mainnet, and onboard more partners and users.\n\nFounders Fund partner Brian Singerman said that he was impressed by Layer N\u2019s vision and technology, and that he believes that layer 2 solutions are essential for the future of Ethereum.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to back Layer N as they build a scalable and secure layer 2 network for Ethereum. Layer N\u2019s hybrid approach to rollups is innovative and promising, and we think it will enable more developers and users to benefit from the power of Ethereum,\u201d Singerman said.\n\nLayer N co-founder and CEO Daniel Wang said that he was grateful for the support from Founders Fund and other investors, and that he hopes to make Ethereum more accessible and affordable for everyone.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to have Founders Fund as our lead investor, as they share our vision of creating a more open and decentralized web. Layer N is committed to solving the scalability and usability challenges of Ethereum, and to bring the benefits of blockchain technology to the masses,\u201d Wang said.\n\nLayer N and Ethereum 2.0 are both ambitious projects that aim to bring blockchain technology to the next level. They share some common features, such as sharding and interoperability, but also have some distinct differences, such as consensus mechanism and sharding scheme. Depending on their preferences and needs, developers and users may choose one platform over the other, or use both platforms in conjunction. Ultimately, both platforms will contribute to the innovation and diversity of the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

        "title": "Did You Miss Out on the Crypto Boom? These Cryptos Will Help: Ethereum, Shiba Inu, Everlodge - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "We all know stories of people that became millionaires thanks to buying Bitcoin or other altcoins in the past, but did you know that it\u2019s not too late to make big profits? Read on to find out more about why Ethereum, Shiba Inu and Everlodge have the potential to skyrocket your portfolio.\n\nJoin the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives\n\nEthereum is the Key to Web3\n\nIf Bitcoin is digital gold, then Ethereum is the digital computer. But what does this mean?\n\nWell, as Ethereum has the ability to run smart contracts it means that it is more than just a currency, in fact its in a large part the basis for web3. And web3 is the future of the internet.\n\nWeb3 allows for decentralized applications, financial services, games, social networks, and more that don\u2019t rely on centralized servers and providers.\n\nFor example, musicians could directly sell tickets and music to fans without middlemen taking cuts. And people can have access to financial services that aren\u2019t offered by their banks due to red tape or geographical location.\n\nThe majority of projects either run on Ethereum, or use Ethereum as a base for their Layer 2 blockchain solutions, meaning that Ethereum is vital for web3.\n\nAs one of the biggest and most decentralized projects using blockchain technology, in the next bull run, Ethereum is set to make higher highs than ever before.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Stage 3 Presale Alert!\ud83d\udd25\n\nHeads up, Lodgers!\n\nStage 3 Presale is LIVE and already over 22% filled! \ud83d\ude80\n\nCurrent Price: $ELDG = $0.018.\n\nDon\u2019t miss your chance to be part of our groundbreaking journey!\ud83d\udcb8\n\nJump in before it\u2019s too late!\n\nJoin Now: https://t.co/SIYWBylwQD#Presale pic.twitter.com/Hb2yuEZkH1 \u2014 Everlodge (@EverlodgeHQ) September 18, 2023\n\nThe People\u2019s Crypto Choice is Shiba Inu\n\nFor some, the meme coin Shiba Inu seems like a whimsical project. But for fans of the coin, known as the Shibarmy, Shiba Inu is the currency that we will all be using in the future.\n\nEven if you aren\u2019t a Shiba Inu maxi, the fact is that this is one of the key coins that the general public turn to when crypto enters a bull market. By entering now, holders can seek to profit off the gains created by the new adopters in the next bull run cycle.\n\nAlso Shiba Inu does have real utility, having built a layer 2 blockchain that is based on Ethereum. This means that Ethereum secures the network whilst allowing for scalability and low transaction fees, as opposed to Ethereum\u2019s very high gas fees.\n\nEverlodgewill change property investing for the better\n\nEverlodge is another project built on Ethereum, therefore also benefiting from the security of the network. Everlodge is new and in presale, which means that it has huge potential for growth, due to its newness and low market cap.\n\nEverlodge is part of web3\u2019s financial inclusion. They want to give ordinary investors the opportunity to co-invest in luxury holiday properties around the world, such as a villa in the Caribbean or a hotel chain in upstate New York.\n\nThey will do this by creating a digital asset that represents the property, using NFT technology. They will then offer their community to buy shares or even the entire property, and each buyer will receive an NFT to legally represent their asset. The benefits of this are twofold, firstly, investors can benefit from capital appreciation of their properties, and secondly they can receive a share of rental income.\n\nEverlodge\u2019s token is called ELDG and is currently in the 3rd phase of presale at $0.018. With several stages still to go, now is an excellent time to get into this token, especially since crypto analysts are predicting that it will rise over a dollar once it goes live on a CEX and DEX.\n\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale\n\nWebsite: https://www.everlodge.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/everlodge\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "What are the most famous cryptocurrencies and blockchains? - Premium Times",
        "content": "As the crypto market continues to expand, an array of unique digital assets has emerged, each with its distinct features and applications. This exploration unravels the diverse universe of cryptocurrencies, from Bitcoin to Tether. There is a crypto asset for everyone!\n\nWhat are cryptocurrencies?\n\nAt their core, cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for security.\n\nUnlike traditional money, cryptocurrencies exist purely in digital form. They\u2019re stored in online ledgers, known as blockchains. From Bitcoin to BNB, each cryptocurrency operates on its unique blockchain, a decentralised and immutable ledger that records all transactions made with that cryptocurrency.\n\nMost famous cryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nComprehending Bitcoin as a digital currency may seem straightforward. For instance, you can use your cryptocurrency wallet to make fractional payments with Bitcoin. Its underlying operational intricacies unveil a profound complexity when scrutinised.\n\nThis financial concept is unique. It allows transactions without a central authority. It removes the need for intermediaries in financial dealings. It rewards blockchain miners who validate transactions and are accessible through various exchange platforms.\n\nOne intriguing aspect of Bitcoin is its divisibility. The smallest unit, a \u201csatoshi,\u201d represents one hundred millionths of a single Bitcoin. Bitcoin could be divided into smaller units if needed and agreed upon by miners.\n\nA new kind of money called cryptocurrency started in 2009. An anonymous person has been given the name, Satoshi Nakamoto. Since then, it\u2019s risen to unparalleled fame. Gaining recognition as the most renowned cryptocurrency globally, many other blockchain networks and financial technologies have been created to compete with it.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nThe beauty of Ethereum lies in its accessibility. You can create an Ethereum account anytime and anywhere. The key innovation lies in the absence of reliance on a central authority that could alter the rules or limit your access.\n\nEthereum operates devoid of dominance by any singular entity. The Ethereum blockchain forms when computers follow the Ethereum protocol and run software together. Each of these machines assumes the role of a node, a task open to anyone, with a caveat. Participation in securing the network necessitates staking ETH, Ethereum\u2019s native token. Anyone can achieve this by having 32 ETH without needing prior authorisation.\n\nEthereum is a vast global network comprising computers distributed worldwide. It\u2019s adhering to a predefined rule set, known as the Ethereum protocol. This network is the foundation for communities, applications, entities, and digital assets that people can create and use.\n\nEven the Ethereum source code doesn\u2019t originate from a solitary entity. It\u2019s open to suggestions for protocol modifications and welcomes discussions on enhancements. Diverse implementations of the Ethereum protocol emerge from independent organisations, employing many programming languages. These implementations typically evolve transparently, fostering contributions from the wider community.\n\nTether (USDT)\n\nTether finds its niche within the burgeoning stablecoin category. Tether\u2019s primary goal is stabilising its token\u2019s value by tying it to traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar.\n\nTether extends its influence by issuing tokens linked to the euro, offshore Chinese yuan, the Mexican peso, and even precious gold. However, these alternate pegged tokens pale compared to the widespread market dominance of its USDT tokens, anchored to the U.S. dollar.\n\nLitecoin (LTC)\n\nIn blockchain technology, a block serves as a repository for transaction data. Verifying these blocks occurs via mining software, rendering them accessible to any network participant, termed a miner. The subsequent block in the chain is forged after successful verification, and Litecoin is granted as a reward.\n\nLitecoin started its journey to stop big mining companies from controlling the mining process. It did this by using a different encryption method. Yet, these enterprising miners swiftly adapted their specialised hardware, steadily expanding their mining capabilities.\n\nDespite being unable to stop miners from taking control of Litecoin mining, this digital currency has become a mineable asset. It also functions as a decentralised peer-to-peer payment system.\n\nLitecoin (LTC) emerged as a cryptocurrency from a Bitcoin blockchain fork in 2011. At first, it was made to address worries about Bitcoin being too centralised. It also aimed to prevent big mining companies from having too much power.\n\nRipple (XRP)\n\nXRP, a digital currency, operates atop the XRP Ledger. This\u2019s a blockchain conceived by the minds of Arthur Britto, Jed McCaleb, and David Schwartz. McCaleb and Britto would later establish Ripple, harnessing XRP\u2019s capabilities to streamline transactions within the network.\n\nXRP can serve various purposes:\n\n\u25cf An investment vehicle.\n\n\u25cf A cryptocurrency for exchange with others.\n\n\u25cf A means to facilitate transactions within the Ripple network.\n\nUnlike other networks, Ripple is somewhat centralised and uses a consensus protocol to function. Although anyone can use the validation software, it also offers exclusive node lists.\n\nUsers can pick these lists to verify transactions and choose participants who are least likely to commit fraud.\n\nDistinguishing itself from the conventional cryptocurrency landscape, XRP\u2019s blockchain adopts a unique approach. XRP uses a security mechanism. Ledger holders must reach a consensus for transaction validation.\n\nValidators check their ledgers every three to five seconds to verify new transactions against each other. Any discrepancies trigger investigations to pinpoint the source of the issue. The careful process ensures secure and efficient transaction validation, making XRP different from Bitcoin.\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nCardano, a prominent player in the cryptocurrency market, ranks among the largest by market capitalisation. The Ethereum concept has evolved into something visionary. It now has a blockchain that is flexible, sustainable, and scalable. The blockchain is perfect for smart contracts and opens new possibilities in finance, tokens, and games.\n\nLike Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, ETH, Cardano\u2019s blockchain features ADA as its native digital currency. ADA is available for purchase or sale through platforms like Coinbase. ADA serves multifaceted roles:\n\n\u25cf Value storage\n\n\u25cf Potential inclusion within investment portfolios\n\n\u25cf Making of payments\n\n\u25cf Participation in staking\n\n\u25cf Covering transaction fees within the Cardano network.\n\nEOS (EOS)\n\nEOS enables people and businesses to build blockchain apps, like web apps. EOS provides a range of features like secure access, authentication, permissions, data hosting, and communication channels. These features help the app\u2019s interaction with the internet.\n\nThe EOS project gets help from a web toolkit repository. This helps make creating applications easier.\n\nAt the heart of the EOS ecosystem lie two pivotal components: EOS.IO software and EOS tokens:\n\n\u25cf EOS.IO assumes the role of an operating system analogous to a computer\u2019s OS. The\n\nEOS blockchain network is managed and supervised by it. It uses blockchain\n\narchitecture to help apps scale vertically and horizontally.\n\n\u25cf The EOS token functions as the primary cryptocurrency within the EOS network.\n\nDevelopers can use network resources and create and run dApps with just EOS coins, saving\n\nmoney. Token holders who aren\u2019t actively involved in app deployment can share their bandwidth\n\nwith others.\n\nBNB\n\nOriginally, Binance Coin (BNB) operated on the Ethereum blockchain. It adheres to the ERC-20 standard. Yet, it subsequently transformed into the primary cryptocurrency native to the Binance chain. Its genesis traces back to an initial coin offering (ICO) staged in July 2017, characterised by a fixed upper limit of 200 million BNB tokens.\n\nA substantial portion of the capital amassed through the ICO served multiple purposes. Nearly half was earmarked for fueling Binance\u2019s branding and marketing initiatives, while roughly one-third was allocated to the development and enhancement of the Binance platform, instigating pivotal upgrades to the broader Binance ecosystem.\n\nInitially rooted in the Ethereum network, BNB has since transitioned into the principal currency native to Binance\u2019s proprietary blockchain \u2013 the Binance chain.\n\nCrypto benefits\n\nCentral banks and governments control traditional currencies. Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, are decentralised. This means that no single entity has complete control over them.\n\nTransactions are peer-to-peer. No intermediary, like a bank, is needed.\n\nCryptocurrencies use special codes to keep transactions safe and control making new units.\n\nThis makes fraud and hacking much more challenging. All transactions made with cryptocurrencies are recorded on a public ledger, making them transparent and verifiable.\n\nCryptocurrencies know no borders. They can be sent and received anywhere worldwide, making cross-border transactions faster and cheaper. When you own cryptocurrencies, you have complete control over your funds.\n\nYou\u2019re not reliant on a bank to access your money.\n\nThe wider cryptocurrency landscape\n\nBeyond these popular cryptocurrencies, the crypto landscape is vast and diverse. Thousands of other cryptocurrencies exist, each with unique features and use cases. Some cryptocurrencies focus on privacy, while others emphasise scalability or environmental sustainability.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies: A word of caution Before diving into the world of cryptocurrencies, it\u2019s essential to approach it with caution:\n\nVolatility: Cryptocurrency prices can be highly volatile, leading to significant gains or losses.\n\nResearch: Thoroughly research any cryptocurrency you plan to invest in, including its technology, team, and use cases.\n\nSecurity: Use secure wallets and good security hygiene to protect your investments.\n\nCrypto\u2019s impact on the future\n\nCryptocurrencies are not just a financial asset. They represent a technological and social shift that has the potential to disrupt traditional economic systems. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are emerging as a response to the crypto revolution. They blur the lines between traditional finance and the digital world.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe world of different cryptocurrencies is a fascinating and rapidly evolving ecosystem. Their innovations know no bounds. These digital assets, with their unique characteristics and applications, continue to reshape the landscape of finance and technology.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nWhatsApp\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

        "title": "Raoul Pal's Bullish Outlook on Solana: A Strong Ethereum Competitor - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "In a recent interview with Altcoin Daily, Raoul Pal, the founder of Real Vision and a former Goldman Sachs executive, expressed his bullish stance on Solana (SOL), describing it as one of the most promising projects outside of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nAccording to a report by The Daily Hodl, Pal praised Solana\u2019s co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko and highlighted the blockchain\u2019s growing developer community and public awareness. Pal says Anatoly Yakovenko \u2014 commonly known as Toly \u2014 is emerging as an important thought leader in the cryptocurrency space. Pal appreciates Yakovenko\u2019s open-minded approach, stating that he builds bridges rather than destroying them. Yakovenko\u2019s leadership style, Pal believes, positively represents the Solana ecosystem.\n\nPal is impressed by Solana\u2019s engaged developer community and the passion they have for building the ecosystem and its technology. He also noted that Solana has gained significant public awareness, which is a crucial factor for its growth and adoption.\n\nOn September 5, Visa (NYSE: V) announced that it was \u201cexpanding its stablecoin settlement capabilities to the high-performing Solana blockchain.\u201d\n\nCuy Sheffield, Head of Crypto at Visa, had this to say:\n\n\u201cBy leveraging stablecoins like USDC and global blockchain networks like Solana and Ethereum, we\u2019re helping to improve the speed of cross-border settlement and providing a modern option for our clients to easily send or receive funds from Visa\u2019s treasury. Visa is committed to being on the forefront of digital currency and blockchain innovation and leveraging these new technologies to help improve the way we move money.\u201d\n\nPal said:\n\n\u201cSo, why is Visa using Solana? Because it\u2019s fast. It\u2019s fast, and it does a good job \u2026 It\u2019s not Ethereum. It\u2019s different from Ethereum and even the way Toly has been talking about, \u2018Could SOL be a layer-2 on ETH?,\u2019 or \u2018How do these worlds integrate?\u2019 It just shows that for Visa to make a wrong decision is not that easy because things can be bridged, things can be interoperable \u2026\u201d\n\nPal believes that if digital assets are set for another market expansion in the coming years, Solana could be one of the safest bets. He sees Solana as a blockchain that has not made any significant mistakes for a long time, especially when the crypto space was going through periods of \u201cmaximum fear and hate.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging Ethereum\u2019s position as the \u201cbig daddy\u201d of the crypto space, Pal sees Solana as the next best major story. He suggests that when looking for an altcoin that offers relative security, Solana stands out as a strong contender, making it a less risky choice compared to other options."

        "title": "Positive predictions on the price of Ethereum - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Positive price predictions for Ethereum (ETH) are beginning to circulate.\n\nAlthough ETH, like the entire crypto market, is also affected by Bitcoin\u2019s four-year cycle, historically it has often performed better in terms of price during bull runs.\n\nTypically, during bear-markets ETH suffers more than BTC, and during crypto winters it performs significantly worse than the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency. However, it then recovers during bull-runs.\n\nEthereum: past cycle performance and future price predictions\n\nFor example, during the previous cycle\u2019s bear-market, i.e., that of 2018, Ethereum\u2019s price performance had been close to -95%, compared to a -85% for Bitcoin. And during last year\u2019s bear-market, compared to a -77% of BTC, ETH scored -82%.\n\nAll this despite the fact that in 2022 there was the Ethereum Merge, which is the replacement of Proof-of-Work with Proof-of-Stake that made ETH a deflationary currency.\n\nHowever, if we look at the bull run, in 2021 ETH made +4,000% from the lows of the previous cycle, compared to +1,500% for BTC.\n\nSo it certainly seems that greater declines during bear-markets also mean greater rises during bull runs.\n\n2023\n\nRight now, compared to the beginning of the year, the price of Ethereum is up only 37%, after -82% during the bear-market, while Bitcoin is already +63%.\n\nIn particular, if in January both ETH and BTC prices made a strong rebound, already in March the second rebound of the year was greater for Bitcoin than Ethereum.\n\nApart from the brief interlude in mid-April with the Shapella update, ETH\u2019s 2023 has been underperforming compared to BTC, such that even the third rebound, in June, was much more pronounced for Bitcoin\u2019s price than Ethereum\u2019s.\n\nIn terms of declines, on the other hand, they more or less equaled each other, so if during the bear-market Ethereum\u2019s price fell more, during the rest of the crypto winter it rose somewhat less.\n\nThe state of the Ethereum network and the outlook for its price\n\nOne thing that bodes well for the future, however, is the state of the Ethereum network.\n\nIndeed, as the latest Bitfinex Alpha report points out, Ethereum\u2019s second layers are experiencing a substantial increase in activity, coming to process transactions overall at five times the rate of the main network.\n\nThis should increasingly lead to improvements in network scalability, and especially in the performance of Ethereum-based applications.\n\nThe Total Value Locked (TVL) of the Ethereum blockchain has remained stable at $21.45 billion, in recent times, but the total value of the second layers has more than doubled to $9.56 billion. These are still distant numbers, but getting closer.\n\nThe hypothesis that in the event of a bull run the price performance of ETH could once again outperform that of Bitcoin is based primarily on the increased use, and thus adoption, of Ethereum. To achieve this requires second layers to enable as many people as possible to transact faster and faster, and especially at lower costs.\n\nFor example right now the average cost of a transaction recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain is less than $2, while on the Ethereum blockchain it turns out to be over $3.5. In other words, currently on-chain transactions on the Ethereum network cost almost twice as much as those on the Bitcoin network, and this is despite Ethereum\u2019s move to PoS.\n\nThe future of the network therefore runs precisely through second layers.\n\nThe comment\n\nBitfinex analysts commented on the report saying:\n\n\u201cOver the last week, the Ethereum chain has gained $17.4 million alone. Ethereum has also been deflationary since the beginning of the year and is being perceived as a solid investment. August saw the burning of 72,117 ETH, which equates to a substantial $126.5M."

        "content": "Grayscale Investments, the world\u2019s largest digital currency asset manager, announced its decision to relinquish all rights to Ethereum\u2018s Proof-of-Work (PoW) tokens, known as ETHPoW. The announcement came on September 18, more than a year after Ethereum\u2019s transition from a PoW to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system, an event known as the Ethereum Merge. Grayscale cited the lack of meaningful liquidity and custodial support for ETHPoW tokens as the primary reasons for this move.\n\nThe Ethereum Merge, which took place on September 15, 2022, was a significant milestone in the crypto industry. However, it marked Ethereum\u2019s full transition from a PoW to a PoS system, dividing the Ethereum blockchain into a main PoS-based Ether and a minor PoW-based EthereumPoW. Following this event, Grayscale spent an extended period evaluating whether to acquire EthereumPoW tokens on behalf of its record date shareholders.\n\nAfter a year-long deliberation, the firm decided against it, citing uncertainties regarding the support of these tokens by digital asset custodians and trading platforms.\n\nUnlike Grayscale, some investment firms like ETC Group attempted to launch dedicated EthereumPoW exchange-traded products (ETPs). However, these efforts were short-lived. ETC Group terminated its PoW-based ETP just six weeks after its launch due to the absence of eligible custody providers.\n\nThe future of Grayscale and Ethereum\n\nAccording to a Wall Street Journal report, Grayscale\u2019s decision to abandon ETHPoW comes at a time when the firm is reportedly launching a new Ether futures exchange-traded fund. Grayscale\u2019s move to relinquish rights to ETHPoW tokens could be seen as a strategic decision to focus on more promising and supported aspects of the Ethereum ecosystem. The market cap of the old ETHPoW is currently around $140 million, a figure that pales in comparison to Ethereum\u2019s PoS tokens.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s decision to abandon rights to ETHPoW tokens highlights the challenges and uncertainties that investment firms face in the ever-changing world of digital assets. With Ethereum\u2019s transition to a PoS system, the relevance of its older PoW tokens has diminished, leading major investment firms like Grayscale to reevaluate their strategies."

        "content": "Spiderchain offers full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence atop Bitcoin\u2019s secure layer without altering its base protocol.\n\nThis Layer 2 design is motivated by the rising demand for enhanced decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on Bitcoin.\n\nUnlocking Bitcoin\u2019s Potential: Introducing Spiderchain\n\nWhile Bitcoin remains the benchmark for cryptocurrency, its ecosystem has yet to capitalize fully on the massive growth of decentralized finance applications, predominantly seen on Ethereum. This discrepancy results in the Total Value Locked (TVL) in Bitcoin\u2019s second layers being less than 0.1% of its market cap. Conversely, the value of Bitcoin wrapped for Ethereum exceeds 2%.\n\nBotanix Labs has unveiled a solution: Spiderchain. This innovative Layer 2 protocol aims to amalgamate Bitcoin\u2019s unparalleled decentralization and security with Ethereum\u2019s dynamic ecosystem and smart contract capabilities.\n\nDiving Deep: Spiderchain\u2019s Unique Attributes\n\nA major differentiator for Spiderchain from other proposals, like drivechains or zero-knowledge rollups, is its capability to seamlessly integrate with Bitcoin without necessitating changes to the base layer protocol.\n\nWhy is this Integration Significant?\n\nEthereum\u2019s prominence in DeFi owes largely to its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that facilitates a myriad of applications. Spiderchain aims to tap into this goldmine by offering full EVM equivalence on Bitcoin. This not only introduces Ethereum\u2019s vast capabilities onto Bitcoin but also ensures that Bitcoin remains the secure and decentralized foundation.\n\nUnderstanding the Spiderchain Mechanism\n\nOrchestrators and Multisig Wallets: The Spiderchain protocol functions via a series of multisig wallets steered by Orchestrators. These individuals or entities deposit BTC collateral into these wallets to manage and facilitate the peg-in and peg-out requests. Their role is pivotal to maintaining the network\u2019s integrity by ensuring honest actions and constant activity.\n\nThe Spiderchain protocol functions via a series of multisig wallets steered by Orchestrators. These individuals or entities deposit BTC collateral into these wallets to manage and facilitate the peg-in and peg-out requests. Their role is pivotal to maintaining the network\u2019s integrity by ensuring honest actions and constant activity. Spiderchain Epochs: Spiderchain doesn\u2019t maintain a 1:1 relationship with Bitcoin blocks. Instead, it operates similarly to Ethereum with blocks created every 12 seconds. Whenever a new Bitcoin block emerges, a new epoch is birthed in Spiderchain, establishing finality for preceding transactions.\n\nBalancing Proof of Stake (PoS) with Proof of Work (PoW)\n\nIn the realm of blockchain, PoW is renowned for its security, while PoS offers scalability. Spiderchain, by leveraging Bitcoin\u2019s PoW attributes, aims to balance out the potential vulnerabilities typically associated with PoS, such as centralization or randomized validator selection. It operates on a foundational belief: as long as the honest Orchestrators outnumber adversarial ones by two-thirds or more, the protocol remains secure.\n\nSecurity at Spiderchain\u2019s Core\n\nThe meticulous design of Spiderchain ensures optimal security. For instance, funds are spread across numerous multisig wallets, negating significant losses in the rare event of a security breach. Various factors, such as the stake provided by Orchestrators or the total Bitcoin locked in Spiderchain, dictate its security levels.\n\nHowever, like any system, Spiderchain\u2019s security depends on some assumptions, notably:\n\nNo individual or entity controls over 50% of the staked funds.\n\nNo single multisig in Spiderchain contains a malicious or non-responding quorum exceeding 33%.\n\nAs the crypto world continues to evolve, the integration of Bitcoin\u2018s robustness with Ethereum\u2019s versatility through Spiderchain stands as a testament to the potential of blockchain technology, paving the way for a more integrated and holistic financial future."

        "content": "In a remarkable display of ingenuity and technological prowess, a developer has achieved an unprecedented feat by harnessing the power of ChatGP4 and AI to autonomously launch an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. This groundbreaking endeavor not only pushes the boundaries of what AI can achieve in the world of blockchain technology but also opens up exciting possibilities for the future.\n\nThe integration of AI and blockchain\n\nIn a compelling fusion of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, the developer embarked on a journey to explore the capabilities of ChatGP4 in conjunction with Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts. While it might seem improbable for an AI to directly deploy a token on the Ethereum network, the developer discovered a clever workaround using OpenAI\u2019s API. By integrating ChatGP4 into custom-built applications and connecting them to Ethereum via hardhat, the project gained the direction it needed.\n\nLeveraging the OpenAI API, the developer created a script that instructed ChatGP4 to initiate the creation of an ERC-20 token. This script, seamlessly connected to Ethereum, automated the token deployment process. With several hundred lines of code, the project started to take shape, marking a significant milestone in AI-driven blockchain innovation.\n\nThe core functionality of the script revolves around ChatGP4\u2019s ability to generate an ERC-20 token using Open Zeppelin standards. Parameters such as the token name and other essential details were passed to the script via values provided by ChatGP4 in the code\u2019s constructor. This laid the foundation for a truly AI-driven token creation process.\n\nTo further enhance the AI\u2019s involvement, the script introduced JSON objects named \u201cdataSupply\u201d and \u201cdataName.\u201d These objects initiated conversations with ChatGP4 to determine the desired token supply and name. The name generated by ChatGP4 was stored in a variable called \u201cnameGivenByAI,\u201d which played a pivotal role in the subsequent stages of token creation.\n\nBut the project didn\u2019t stop there. ChatGP4 was tasked with crafting a short description for the token, utilizing the \u201cdescriptionGivenByAI\u201d variable. This is where the involvement of another AI model, DALL-E, came into play. ChatGP4 fed its description to DALL-E, which generated end-to-end images based on the token\u2019s name. The results were promising but required further refinement.\n\nTo enhance ChatGP4\u2019s responses, the developer sought to provide it with a deeper understanding of the cryptocurrency landscape without introducing human bias. The solution came in the form of data, as the developer created a Dune Query to compile data on the top 10,000 traded tokens on Uniswap. A Python script cross-referenced these tokens with their market capitalization data from sources like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. By integrating this data into the AI\u2019s prompts, the quality of responses improved significantly.\n\nWith these adjustments, GPT-4 demonstrated a more profound understanding of crypto culture and offered more creative responses, bringing the project closer to its goal of autonomous ERC-20 token deployment.\n\nAddressing the human elements in autonomous token deployment\n\nWhile the project showcased remarkable progress in AI-driven token creation, it still faced a few lingering human elements. Questions arose regarding ownership of the private keys and contract ownership, which the developer ingeniously addressed with a simple yet effective solution.\n\nUpon deploying the contract, ownership was immediately revoked, ensuring that no human entity retained control over the token. Also, the developer took a bold step by adding 100% of the tokens alongside 2 ETH to liquidity on Uniswap upon creation. This move not only emphasized the project\u2019s commitment to autonomy but also introduced the token to the broader crypto community.\n\nIn total, the script comprised 876 lines of code, showcasing the complexity and sophistication of AI-driven token deployment. With this groundbreaking project, the developer has ushered in a new era where autonomous code and AI can collaborate to create and deploy ERC-20 tokens.\n\nAs the script was executed, it unveiled \u201cAstroPepeX\u201d ($APX), marking a significant milestone in AI-driven token creation.\n\nThe developer\u2019s innovative approach received praise from the crypto community, with one user commenting,\n\n\u201cAwesome read man and a job well done. \ud83e\udd1d We\u2019re only beginning to scratch the surface of what AI can do, and I\u2019m all here for it. Looking forward to the developments of the future and seeing how crypto/blockchain can integrate alongside it.\u201d\n\nThis remarkable project from the developer @CroissantEth highlights the immense potential of AI in the blockchain space. It demonstrates that with the right tools and creative thinking, AI can autonomously create and deploy tokens, pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible at the intersection of AI and blockchain technology. The open-sourcing of the project\u2019s code invites further exploration and innovation in this exciting field."

        "content": "This article will analyze the main competitors competing for supremacy in the decentralized tech universe, BitTorrent Crypto and Ethereum. We will be appraising these networks in terms of characteristics, expansiveness, and capability for innovation. Both structures are open-source and have a considerable following.\n\nTheir distinctiveness generates unparalleled prospects for companies seeking to utilize these potent technologies in new territories or augment current ones. They offer contrasting solutions concerning data security, tokenization, intelligent contracts, and other decisive facets of blockchain technology that must be considered when selecting a platform for conducting business operations.\n\nUltimately, companies must decide whether they prefer non-fungible tokens or native digital assets for their products.\n\nExploring BitTorrent\n\nBitTorrent Crypto (New) is a decentralized, P2P computer network protocol that enables users to exchange digital resources from one user to another. It operates based on blockchain technology; the distributed ledger system catalogs and monitors digital currency transactions with extreme security and precision.\n\nThe BitTorrent Crypto (New) platform facilitates quicker transactions than most popular cryptos, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. This latest development allows Lightning Network micro-transactions, facilitating prompt payments much more minuscule than traditional Bitcoin transfers.\n\nThe service does not require any miner fees or supplementary costs of transaction administration \u2013 thereby nullifying the need for costly mining resources typically demanded of regular cryptocurrency networks like Sterlingcoin or TokenPay Networking Protocols.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum\n\nEthereum 2.0 is an Ethereum blockchain upgrade that claims to increase scalability and performance throughout the whole network significantly.\n\nThe upgrade brought many significant changes, including the move from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus process to a new PoS algorithm dubbed Casper, the introduction of sharding to increase transaction speed, and the implementation of new security features such as data availability checks and cryptographic accumulators.\n\nThese modifications have potentially expanded Ethereum\u2019s capabilities on numerous layers significantly.\n\nBitTorrent V/S Ethereum: The Future Outlook\n\nAccording to professional studies, BTT has bright future potential largely because of its foundation in the most recent decentralized blockchain technology. On January 18, 2022, BTT achieved its greatest value of $0.000003054; on June 20, 2023, it reached its lowest value of $0.0000004568.\n\nBTT\u2019s performance has been largely consistent since the beginning of this year, with a few sporadic drops. For instance, BTT was selling for about $0.0000007708 on February 21. But soon after, it saw a decline and fell to a low of $0.000000466. The present price changes indicate that traders are now balancing optimism and prudence.\n\nAnticipations for 2023 forecast a towering high of BitTorrent at a cost of $0.00000101. BitTorrent coin future for 2025 asserts that the token could hover between $0.00000109 and $0.00000157 with an assumed worth of $0.00000133. Buoyed predictions for the forthcoming years show the value of BitTorrent could capriciously range between $0.00000381 and $0.00000549 by the year 2030.\n\nWhile Ethereum predictions anticipate that the token might close the year 2023 at around $3,904, at the same time, by the year 2025, it might have an average price of $5,561, and in 2030, the ETH token may have reached a maximum value of $20,643.\n\nThe crypto market seems to demonstrate a slight bearishness in sentiment. In the long run, though, projections for both BitTorrent and Ethereum are positive.\n\nPrice Predictions: The Expert Opinion\n\nDoes BitTorrent have a future? Let\u2019s find out what experts have to say:\n\nWallet Investor claims that investing in BTT can be dangerous and would not yield favorable results over a year. Although BitTorrent (New) is currently valued at $0.000000110, there is a chance that your investment will lose value in the future. While their ETH prediction reveals that the token might fall down to $737.47 by 2024.\n\nAccording to Bitnation, BitTorrent (New) may achieve a high price of $0.000001 as the market starts to recover. It is projected to have a minimum value of around $0.000000567 and an average trading price of approximately $0.0000007092. While they anticipate the token to have a maximum value of $6,230.51 by 2025.\n\nMany people hold Justin Sun\u2019s influence responsible for their optimism about the BitTorrent coin future. The BTT price prediction for 2030, according to Price Prediction, indicates that although there could be some short-term effects on the token\u2019s value, bullish momentum will eventually return. This may cause the price to soar to a stunning $0.00003610, causing investors to think about buying more BitTorrent (New).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe confrontation between BitTorrent Crypto and Ethereum will continue in the years ahead as the two platforms vie for supremacy as distributed applications. It is uncertain who will emerge victorious. However, the one that best demonstrates its capabilities regarding cost adequacy, flexibility, protection, and practitioner and user functionality will most likely rule the roost.\n\nAs interoperability attempts advance between these two networks, such as atomic trades, we\u2019ll only observe continuing progress from their conjoint effect on the blockchain domain in the future. Either way, both projects present incredibly optimistic fundamentals for a decentralized future; as a result, financiers must remain aware of which technologies are likely to have the necessary durability or competence they need to select a protocol or token to put money into."

        "content": "Yesterday it was highlighted that an Ethereum whale deposited 6,000 ETH, the equivalent of $9.96 million, on the Kraken crypto-exchange.\n\nThe crypto transfer by a whale to cryptocurrency exchanges often indicates bearish market sentiment. Will this be the case?\n\nEthereum: the deposit of 6,000 ETH on the Kraken crypto-exchange by a whale\n\nEarlier in the day yesterday, an Ethereum whale transferred 6,000 ETH to the Kraken crypto-exchange. Reporting this to the crypto-community was Lookonchain\u2018s onchain analyst.\n\nA whale deposited 6,000 $ETH ($9.96M) into #Kraken 50 minutes ago.\n\n\n\nThis whale is an Ethereum ICO participant, receiving 254,908 $ETH($422.6M currently), the ETH ICO price is ~$0.31.https://t.co/f0Ob9tqPqc pic.twitter.com/n3aj96tA31 \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 18, 2023\n\nBasically, the whale in question would have deposited the equivalent of $9.96 million in ETH on Kraken.\n\nNot only that, Lookonchain identified that this Whale was also a participant in the Ethereum ICO. Moreover, that wallet reportedly received 254,908 ETH (the equivalent of $422.6 million today), from the Ethereum Genesis blockchain, in July 2015.\n\nUsually, when a whale makes such transactions, namely moving its large funds to crypto-exchanges, it is a symptom of bearish market sentiment.\n\nIn this case, however, there is also the fact that the 6,000 ETH deposited on Kraken, is a not-so-high proportion compared to the Ethereum whale\u2019s total funds.\n\nEthereum: the deposit on Kraken and the crypto\u2019s price forecast\n\nHowever, despite the likely bearish market sentiment resulting from Ethereum\u2019s whale move, it appears that there are those who are instead predicting that the crypto\u2019s price may experience a bull run.\n\nAnd indeed, positive predictions have recently been reported regarding the price of ETH, this is partly because a possible bull run of Bitcoin is coming with the halving 2024.\n\nBasically, looking back, Ethereum has managed to perform consistently better in terms of price precisely during crypto bull runs. In contrast, however, even during BTC bear markets, ETH seems to suffer the most.\n\nFrom early 2023 to the present, Ethereum\u2019s price has risen 37%, counting the previous bear market that saw it fall -82%. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is already +63%.\n\nPositive assumptions about ETH\u2019s price performance for the upcoming bull run are also based on the continued increase in blockchain usage and thus ETH adoption.\n\nAt the time of writing, the quintessential crypto for smart contracts, DeFi and NFTs, Ethereum (ETH) is worth $1645.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s response to Vitalik Buterin\n\nStaying on the Ethereum theme, it appears that its co-founder Vitalik Buterin has challenged Hong Kong in terms of crypto regulation.\n\nDuring the Web3 Transition Summit, Buterin reportedly warned crypto projects seeking to move their operations to Hong Kong, also claiming that he does not understand how the country\u2019s laws work.\n\nIn response to these claims, a member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council, Johnny Ng, stepped in.\n\nIn a tweet, Ng reportedly described the pattern of law issuances in the country and explained the interaction between Hong Kong and Mainland China, concluding that crypto friendly regulatory policies in Hong Kong are \u201cvery stable.\u201d"

        "title": "Ethereum: Metis launches crypto incentives for DeFi - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The news is official: Ethereum layer 2 Metis has launched a $5 million crypto incentive program for development on DeFi.\n\nThe Metis Journey has officially started\ud83d\ude80\n\n\n\nA $5,000,000 DeFi Incentive Program in collaboration with blue-chip DeFi dApps, starting off with @AaveAave, on the most scalable and cost-efficient Ethereum Layer 2.https://t.co/RkgrdGjXBU \u2014 Metis\ud83c\udf3f (@MetisDAO) September 19, 2023\n\nThe program is called Metis Journey, and it is designed to enhance new and existing DeFi applications on the Metis network, starting with the blue-chip Aave v3 protocol.\n\nThe Aave Protocol\n\nThe program begins with the strategic allocation of tokens specifically to Aave v3. Specifically, 100,000 METIS tokens will be allocated to incentivize liquidity pools for all assets available to Aave users on Metis, namely ETH, METIS, USDC, USDT, and DAI.\n\nThe goal is to attract a larger user base to the Metis platform, thanks precisely to Aave\u2019s involvement.\n\nAave is currently the third largest DeFi protocol in the world for TVL, with nearly $4.7 billion, enabling it to trail the second largest, Maker, at 4.9.\n\nIts token, AAVE, capitalizes less than $900 million, so only a fraction of the protocol\u2019s total TVL.\n\nAAVE\u2019s market value has risen 16% over the past seven days, but it has not performed particularly well during 2023. Nevertheless, it remains one of the most attractive DeFi tokens.\n\nIn addition to Metis, Aave also uses other Ethereum second layers, such as Polygon, Avalanche, and Optimism.\n\nEthereum: other crypto and DeFi projects in the Metis ecosystem\n\nThe Metis initiative also involves other DeFi projects\n\nFor example involved are Hummus, a combination of single-sided staking pools from Platypus Finance and bespoke pools enabled by Balancer, or Stargate, a cross-chain bridge that facilitates seamless asset transfers to and from the Metis network.\n\nSynapse, a platform offering cross-chain communication and yield farming capabilities, and Unimaia, or an alternative to Uniswap equipped with concentrated liquidity, are also involved.\n\nMetis Journey also extends incentives to regular users who contribute liquidity, engage in trading, and actively participate in the Metis ecosystem.\n\nThe initiative kicks off a series of strategic moves to catalyze exponential growth within the Metis ecosystem and community.\n\nThe MetisDAO token\n\nThe Metis project also has its own MetisDAO token, which, not surprisingly, is now registering +7% in the crypto markets.\n\nActually the bulk of the recent growth started a couple of days ago, so much so that the accumulated gain since Monday has been almost 20%.\n\nHowever compared to 30 days ago it is still down 8%, and the current price of $12 is still 25% lower than it was at the beginning of the year.\n\nThe token was launched in 2021 at the height of the bull run, reaching an all-time high in January 2022 at over $320. Since then it has plummeted to the $10 touched a few days ago, and is now -96% from the highs.\n\nIn such a situation it is more than normal that the project has decided to do something to lift the tokens\u2019 fortunes, and the Metis Journey initiative may have that purpose as well. It is no coincidence that Aave, which is one of the fittest and most widely used DeFi protocols in the world, was chosen as the first beneficiary.\n\nCrypto: the state of DeFi on Ethereum\u2019s L2, Metis\n\nThe bear-market of 2022 did real damage in DeFi, such as the implosion of the Terra/Luna ecosystem in May last year.\n\nIn addition, 2023, unlike the crypto markets, did not see a solid recovery\n\nThe highest ever TVL for the entire DeFi ecosystem was about $175 billion as of November 2021, while 2022 closed at $38 billion.\n\nIn other words, the loss was 78%, which is in line, for example, with the losses cumulated over essentially the same period by the price of Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nCurrently, DeFi\u2019s total TVL is only $39 billion, which is about the same as at the beginning of the year, despite the fact that Bitcoin\u2019s price is at +62% and Ethereum\u2019s at +36% instead.\n\nSo 2023 is not a year of revival, but a year of stagnation, which is still better than last year\u2019s bloodbath."

        "title": "Eclipse unveils its Ethereum SVM L2 mainnet architecture - NameCoinNews",
        "content": "Eclipse has published details about the architectural structure of Ethereum SVM L2, Eclipse Mainnet. Per those details, the general purpose of L2 brings together the best of the modular stack. Ethereum Mainnet has been defined as the faster L2 solution of Ethereum that is powered by SVM.\n\nThe four elements that it brings together are:\n\nSettlement\n\nExecution\n\nData availability\n\nProving\n\nEclipse will use ETH as the gas token while settling Eclipse into Ethereum. This means that Ethereum will host the validating bridge. Execution will be handled by SVM, which is an acronym for Solana Virtual Machine. Eclipse will run the high-performing SVM as the execution environment. Data will be posted by Eclipse to Celestia. This will ensure scalability in data availability. Finally, Eclipse will deploy RISC Zero for zk proofs of fraud.\n\nOverall, three components are involved in the process, namely Eclipse SVM Mainnet, Celestia, and Ethereum.\n\nThe process begins with Eclipse SVM Mainnet L2 after it commences execution. The block is posted to Celestia, with the commitment being simultaneously posted to Ethereum. Celestia locks data availability, which is then rooted in Ethereum, which serves as a validating bridge and settlement section.\n\nEvery section digs deeper. For instance, Execution goes on to cover Optimized Parallel Execution, Local Fee Markets, and State Growth Management, to mention a few.\n\nAll the components come with benefits to the ecosystem. SVM is a highly performant parallelized VM. Similarly, Celestia has the advantage of DA scaling with DAS light node support.\n\nData availability is one specific section exploring Celestia\u2019s bandwidth and verifiability. Eclipse has said that it will leverage the capabilities of Celestia when it comes to data availability. Their partnership goes back to the time when Celestia was its ecosystem partner. Celestia has been chosen to extend the association as Ethereum currently does not support throughput and fees with its bandwidth.\n\nCelestia is expected to launch 2 MB blocks by the end of 2023. Blobspace will respond to this with an additional 8 MB of support shortly after the launch. DAS light nodes are imperative because they enable verification aspects for users and securely contribute to scalability.\n\nProving resembles Anatoly\u2019s SVM Fraud Proofs SIMD. Eclipse experimented with having Sparse Merkle Tree; however, it was constantly affecting the performance of every transaction that was being done. The final decision was made to fulfill the criteria of input commitment, transaction settlement, and substantial proof that executing a transaction again results in a different output.\n\nFaults that Eclipse Mainnet attempts to avoid are Incorrect Output and Incorrect Input.\n\nEthereum has been mainly chosen for its support of innovation. Moving forward, it plans to take on the aspects of delegation, execution, and innovation. Layer2 solutions can leverage Ethereum\u2019s network\u2019s abilities, including effects and settlement. SVM is expected to remain a standard for a while."
