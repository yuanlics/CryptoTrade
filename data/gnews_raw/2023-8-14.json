        "title": "Chainlink Vs. Ethereum \u2013 What's the Difference? - Securities.io",
        "content": "Understanding the differences between Chainlink (LINK) and Ethereum (ETH) is less about evaluating competitors and more about learning how these networks have the potential to leverage each other's technologies. Ethereum has been a pioneering force in the market and has helped to usher in higher adoption. Chainlink is a concept that has the potential to improve Dapps across all networks. Here's everything you need to know about Chainlink and Ethereum.\n\nWhat is Chainlink?\n\nMany traders are surprised to learn that Chainlink has been in the market since 2014. At that time, the protocol went under another name, SmartContract.com. In 2017, the network changed its name to align with its new goals. The team launched an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) that secured $32 million for the project. This maneuver was then followed by a partnership with Google, which further expanded the network's validity and positioning.\n\nChainlink differs from its competitors and Ethereum in many ways. For one, Chainlink is a decentralized network of oracles. Oracles are off-chain sensors that are crucial to the operations of today's Dapps. Oracles can transfer data to and from the blockchain.\n\nFor example, you could have an oracle that transfers the title for a car to an owner automatically when payments are complete. Some oracles monitor the price of cryptocurrencies for DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges) and other Dapps. The possibilities are endless. There are even oracles that monitor the weather.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is one of the most recognized blockchains in the world. The network made a name for itself after entering the market in 2014. The network ushered in upgraded blockchain capabilities via the introduction of smart contract support. This strategy launched a new era in the sector with dapps becoming the primary purpose of many networks since.\n\nEthereum is the decentralized infrastructure that supports the Ether cryptocurrency. Ethereum's early entry into the market helped it to become the juggernaut it is today. The protocol dominates the market as the most popular DeFi and Dapp protocol in operation today.\n\nWhat Problems Was Chainlink Built to Alleviate?\n\nChainlink seeks to eliminate the biggest problem facing oracles today, incorrect data. Oracles have grown to be an integral part of most major Dapps. These off-chain sensors serve a vital role in communicating timely information to protocols. Problems occur when oracles provide false or incorrect data to the blockchain. The immutable nature of these networks means that this information is not removable in many instances.\n\nChainlink created a decentralized network of oracles that can self-check and analyze data to ensure the correctness of the information. This system uses multiple oracles that cross-reference their input. The oracles that provide faulty data are penalized. Too many incorrect entries can lead to an oracle being removed from the network.\n\nInteroperability\n\nAnother major problem that Chainlink helps to solve is interoperability. Blockchain networks work great alone but when they are integrated into legacy systems, they can be a real game changer for businesses and creators. The system provides a reliable oracle infrastructure that is open to anyone to use.\n\nWhat Problems Was Ethereum Built to Alleviate?\n\nEthereum was built to improve blockchains' usability. It wasn't designed to compete against Bitcoin. It was created to provide a way for developers to leverage the security and reliability of the blockchain system. The network also improved on earlier blockchain's scalability. The network supports 15 tps compared to Bitcoin's 7 tps.\n\nEthereum helped to fight the growing centralization in the market. At the time, the Bitcoin mining sector was very centralized with large mining pools controlling the majority of the network's hash rate. Ethereum introduced a new PoW consensus mechanism that did away with the SHA-256 protocol and leveraged Scrypt. This change gave the network better performance and a lower carbon footprint.\n\nETH 2.0\n\nEthereum seeks to improve its sustainability with the ETH 2.0 upgrade. The change would transfer the network to a PoS protocol. This maneuver would eliminate miners. In a PoS network, stakers secure returns by staking their tokens in network wallets or pools. This approach is more inclusive, removes technical barriers, and costs less.\n\nHow Does Chainlink Work?\n\nChainlink leverages a host of proprietary technologies to provide users with a secure oracle experience. The Chainlink Reputation Contract is used to verify the authenticity of oracles. This system ranks each oracle based on its reliability, uptime, and participation level.\n\nThe Chainlink Order-Matching Contract is a critical component of the ecosystem. This protocol sends the Requesting Contract to the nodes. The system automatically includes how many nodes will be required and the type of nodes as part of this report. Next, nodes bid on the requests. Then, the Chainlink Aggregation Contract checks all the data gathered from the oracles. Incorrect information is reconciled and oracles are ranked based on their performance.\n\nLINK\n\nLINK is the main utility token used by the network. The system requires users to use LINK to pay for services and interact with the network. It\u2019s also required to execute smart contracts. There are in total, 1,000,000,000 LINK set for issuance over the total life of the project.\n\nHow Does Ethereum Work?\n\nEthereum leverages a decentralized network of nodes that handle tasks such as transaction validations and smart contract execution. Ethereum miners validate blocks of transactions and add them to the ledger. For their efforts, they receive payment in the form of Ether (ETH).\n\nDevelopers can leverage Ethereum tools to create immersive Dapps. Ethereum has been on the cutting edge of DeFi technology since day one. The protocol was also the first to introduce token standards to the market and DEXs. The ERC-20 token standard is used by hundreds of thousands of projects today.\n\nHow to Buy Chainlink (LINK) and Ethereum (ETH)\n\nCurrently, Chainlink (LINK) and Ethereum (ETH) are each available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nUphold Disclaimer: Terms Apply. Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong..\n\nKraken \u2013 Founded in 2011, Kraken is one of the most trusted names in the industry with over 9,000,000 users, and over $207 billion in quarterly trading volume.\n\nThe Kraken exchange offers trading access to over 190 countries including Australia, Canada, Europe, and is a top exchange for USA residents. (Excluding New York & Washington state).\n\nChainlink Vs. Ethereum \u2013 Legends in the Market\n\nEthereum continues to improve its strategy and remains an innovative force in the market today. In comparison, Chainlink serves a vital niche that could improve the performance of all networks. As such, both of these protocols can work together to improve the entire market. In terms of the best to trade, both are worth considering as long-term holds.\n\nTo learn more, make sure to visit our Investing in Chainlink and Investing in Ethereum guides."

        "content": "Why are Ethereum Network Fees so High?: Learn more in this guide\n\n\u200dIf you have ever found yourself scratching your head, wondering why a minor transaction on the Ethereum blockchain leaves your wallet considerably lighter, then you\u2019re not alone.\n\nWith the ever-increasing traffic on the Ethereum blockchain, transaction fees have skyrocketed, leaving many to ponder whether using the network is worth it.\n\nIn this article, we will address why Ethereum network fees are so high, explore the factors contributing to these high fees, and provide practical tips on reducing and avoiding them.\n\nSo buckle up, because today we will unravel some useful information on Ethereum and its fees!\n\nAlso read: Ethereum Is Turning Deflationary, But Price Remains Stagnant\n\nA Quick Look at Ethereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s debut in cryptocurrency was a turning point for the entire blockchain industry. It was the first blockchain to challenge and match the dominance of the Bitcoin network.\n\nEthereum is a decentralized platform that allows developers to create, publish, and distribute applications and smart contracts.\n\nWith its innovative features and services, and a community-run ecosystem that supports thousands of decentralized applications, it quickly gained popularity among investors and users worldwide.\n\nPerhaps its most notable feature is the ability to deploy smart contracts, which accelerated the development of the crypto industry.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum Investors Await Rally as Addresses in Profits Hit Monthly Low\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum Transaction Fees\n\nTransaction fees, or gas fees, are incurred when executing a transaction on the Ethereum network.\n\nEvery network action, whether sending Ether (ETH) or interacting with a smart contract, requires computational power. Miners, who validate transactions and maintain the network, are compensated with gas fees for their efforts.\n\nGas fees are denominated in Gwei, a tiny fraction of an ETH.\n\nOne Gwei is equivalent to 0.000000001 ETH. When you initiate a transaction, you specify a gas limit, the maximum amount of computational work you are willing to pay for.\n\nAdditionally, you set a gas price, the amount of Gwei you are willing to pay per unit of gas. The total transaction fee is calculated by multiplying the gas limit by the gas price.\n\nFactors Contributing to High Ethereum Fees\n\nSource: CNN\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the high fees on the Ethereum network:\n\n1. Network Congestion\n\nAs the popularity of Ethereum has soared, the number of transactions on the network has increased dramatically. This surge in demand has led to network congestion, causing delays and driving up transaction fees.\n\nDuring peak hours, when the network is crowded with users, gas prices tend to skyrocket as users compete to process their transactions.\n\n2. Gas Limit and Gas Price\n\nThe gas limit and gas price you set for your transactions can significantly impact the fees you pay. You will pay more for your transactions if you set a high gas limit or a high gas price.\n\nFinding a balance and optimizing these parameters to minimize fees while ensuring your transactions are processed promptly is important.\n\n3. Smart Contract Complexity\n\nThe complexity of smart contracts also plays a role in determining transaction fees. More complex smart contracts require more computational resources, resulting in higher gas fees.\n\nAs decentralized applications (dApps) and their functionalities become more intricate, the network experiences increased congestion, leading to higher gas prices.\n\n4. Ethereum Network Upgrades\n\nThe Ethereum network has undergone several upgrades to improve scalability and address the issue of high fees. One such upgrade is EIP-1559, which introduced a base fee mechanism to make gas prices more predictable and reduce fee volatility.\n\nHowever, these upgrades take time to implement and may not immediately alleviate the problem of high fees.\n\nHow to Reduce and Avoid High Ethereum Fees\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nNow that we understand the factors contributing to high Ethereum fees let\u2019s explore some practical tips to reduce and avoid them:\n\n1. Optimize Gas Limit and Gas Price\n\nTo minimize transaction fees, optimizing the gas limit and gas price for each transaction is crucial.\n\nTo decrease fees, you can set a lower gas limit and gas price, but avoid setting them too low to prevent transaction delays.\n\nExperiment with different values and find the optimal cost and transaction speed balance.\n\n2. Use Layer-2 Scaling Solutions\n\nLayer-2 scaling solutions encompass technologies constructed on the Ethereum network to boost transaction throughput and cut fees.\n\nThese solutions, such as Optimistic Rollups and zkSync, process transactions off-chain or more optimally, alleviating the burden on the Ethereum mainnet. By utilizing layer-2 solutions, you can benefit from faster and cheaper transactions.\n\n3. Choose Off-Peak Times\n\nGas fees tend to be lower during off-peak times with less network congestion.\n\nYou can take advantage of lower fees by scheduling your transactions during these periods, such as late at night or on weekends.\n\nMonitoring gas price charts or using tools like Gas Now can help you identify the optimal transaction times.\n\n4. Consider Gas Tokens\n\nGas tokens, such as CHI or GST2, allow you to pre-purchase gas at a lower price and use it to pay transaction fees in the future.\n\nYou can effectively reduce your overall gas costs by acquiring gas tokens when gas prices are low and redeeming them when fees are high.\n\nHowever, remember that gas tokens might have limitations and some wallets and platforms might not support them.\n\n5. Choose the Priority Fee Option\n\nSome wallets and platforms offer a priority fee option that allows you to pay a slightly higher fee to process your transaction faster. If time is of the essence, opting for a priority fee can ensure your transaction is prioritized by miners and confirmed more quickly.\n\nSource: Comparic\n\n6. Explore Alternative Blockchains\n\nIf high Ethereum fees persist or if you require faster and cheaper transactions, consider exploring alternative blockchains.\n\nBlockchains like Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Solana offer lower fees and faster transaction speeds.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that these blockchains may have different functionalities and may not support all Ethereum-based tokens and applications.\n\n7. Stay Informed and Adapt\n\nThe Ethereum network keeps evolving, and developers are actively creating new solutions to tackle high fees.\n\nStay informed about network upgrades, improvements, and emerging technologies that aim to reduce fees. B\n\ny adapting to the changing landscape, you can leverage the latest tools and innovations to minimize your transaction costs.\n\nConclusion\n\nHigh Ethereum network fees can be a barrier for users looking to transact on the blockchain. However, by understanding the factors contributing to these fees and implementing the tips mentioned above, you can reduce and avoid high fees on the Ethereum network.\n\nRemember to optimize your gas limit and gas price, explore layer-2 scaling solutions, transact during off-peak times, consider gas tokens, choose priority fees when necessary, explore alternative blockchains, and stay informed about advancements in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWith these strategies, you can navigate the world of Ethereum transactions more cost-effectively.\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

        "title": "Which project will steal the show from Ethereum, the Layer 1 king? - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Mon 14 Aug 2023 \u25aa 8 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nSince its launch in 2015, Ethereum has enjoyed a remarkable rise. The platform has established itself as the crypto ecosystem\u2019s benchmark for Layer 1 infrastructure. The company\u2019s leadership is nevertheless significantly contested. Indeed, with the increased dynamism of the technology market globally, new Layer 1 projects are regularly emerging. Their ambition is to rival or even dethrone Ethereum in this sector. To achieve this, these initiatives propose technological improvements. They also provide enhanced scaling capabilities. Operational advances that generally translate into lower transaction fees for users. In short, they want to do better than Ethereum. But can they? The truth is, it\u2019s extremely difficult to predict with any certainty which project(s) will be able to supplant Ethereum. Admittedly, many of these crypto initiatives are not lacking in relevance. However, this is without taking into account the vast operational network that Ethereum has built to establish its market dominance. With that in mind, we\u2019ll take a closer look at Layer 1 blockchain technology and the particularities of the one developed by Ethereum. We\u2019ll then compare some of the crypto industry\u2019s most popular Layer 1 projects with Ethereum\u2019s.\n\nA look back at the Layer 1 concept\n\nTo assess whether Ethereum\u2019s Layer 1 could be surpassed by other projects, it\u2019s vital to understand its meaning and role within the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nLayer 1, often abbreviated to L1, is the very foundation of blockchain. It is the main blockchain that functions autonomously, without depending on other systems for its operation. It is this independence that distinguishes it from Layer 2 solutions, which are built on top of Layer 1 to enhance scalability and performance without modifying the underlying blockchain.\n\nLayer 0, on the other hand, is the underlying infrastructure layer that facilitates communication between different blockchains. It is a network of networks that enables Layer 1 blockchains to communicate with each other.\n\nLayer 1 blockchains have their own network of validator nodes responsible for validating transactions and blocks. They also use specific consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS) or Proof of Authority (PoA), to guarantee network security and integrity.\n\nIconic blockchains such as Bitcoin, Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Ethereum all operate as Layer 1, each with its own token, which serves as the fuel for transactions and interactions within its ecosystem.\n\nSo what distinguishes Ethereum\u2019s Layer 1 from other first-layer blockchains?\n\nSingularity of Ethereum Layer 1\n\nEthereum, as a Layer 1 project, occupies a prominent place in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and for good reason. Its platform is distinguished by unique features that have redefined the possibilities offered by blockchain technology.\n\nOne of Ethereum\u2019s major innovations is the introduction of smart contracts. These autonomous programs run automatically as soon as predefined conditions are met, without the need for human intervention.\n\nThanks to smart contracts, Ethereum has facilitated the development of decentralized applications (dApps). This has reduced dependence on traditional intermediaries, broadening the range of services available in the crypto ecosystem. In addition, Ethereum has played a crucial role in promoting interoperability between different blockchain platforms.\n\nWhile remaining true to its principles of decentralization, Ethereum is constantly seeking solutions to scale-up challenges, in order to satisfy a rapidly growing and demanding community.\n\nHowever, despite its leading status, Ethereum faces major challenges, particularly with regard to network scaling and high transaction costs. These challenges underline the importance of constant evolution of the platform. Other Layer 1 projects are emerging with innovative proposals, seeking to fill Ethereum\u2019s gaps while offering new functionalities.\n\nLayer 1 projects competing with Ethereum\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry is full of Layer 1 blockchain projects. Given the multitude of offerings available, it would be tedious to cover them all here. However, by observing current trends in the sector, several of them seem to be gaining credibility and could potentially rival the current leaders.\n\nTake Cardano, founded in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson. He often describes his project as an \u201cenhanced version of Ethereum\u201d. Focused on innovation, Cardano is a decentralized blockchain based on proof-of-stake (PoS). It offers developers the possibility of creating smart contracts, while guaranteeing fast, low-cost transactions. One of Cardano\u2019s notable achievements is the Ouroboros protocol, the first peer-verified blockchain protocol, ensuring decentralization, security and scalability.\n\nRipple (XRP) is a major player in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Although Ripple is not a Layer 1 blockchain per se, its network, RippleNet, was designed to facilitate fast, low-cost international money transfers between banks and other financial institutions. Despite recent legal disputes that could influence the price of XRP, its native asset, Ripple continues to stand out. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, XRP is not mined, but uses a unique distributed consensus mechanism to validate transactions.\n\nSolana is also a major player among Layer 1 projects. As a public, open source blockchain, it encourages the development of smart contracts, NFTs and dApps. Solana stands out for its hybrid consensus model combining proof-of-history (PoH) and a PoS synchronization engine. This combination enables Solana to achieve an impressive transaction rate of 65,000 TPS, well above Ethereum\u2019s 15 TPS. It\u2019s worth noting that technology giants such as Apple, Google and Microsoft are backing the project.\n\nOther Layer 1 projects such as Polkadot, Everscale, Stellar, Avalanche, Algorand, Solar Network, Kadena and Cronos are also gaining in popularity. Each of them has unique features that attract the attention of investors. But can they overtake Ethereum? It\u2019s not impossible. Competition in the crypto industry is fierce. In this context, only continued innovation and sustained adoption will determine the future market leader. For the time being, we have to acknowledge Ethereum\u2019s hegemony. It is supported by a vast ecosystem of developers, users and existing projects.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum, as the pioneer of smart contracts and dApps, has long dominated the Layer 1 blockchain landscape, but the emergence of innovative projects such as Cardano, Solana and others shows that there is real competition for this leadership position. Each of these projects brings unique solutions to today\u2019s blockchain challenges, whether in terms of scalability, security or energy efficiency. So, who will be the next king of the Layer 1 protocol? Only time will tell. What is certain is that competition stimulates innovation, and this can only be good for the entire crypto ecosystem.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "title": "Polkadot Vs. Ethereum (2024 Edition) - Securities.io",
        "content": "Understanding the differences between Polkadot (DOT) vs Ethereum (ETH) is a smart way to improve your overall trading skills. Anyone who has traded crypto for a significant period of time can tell you that Polkadot and Ethereum are two projects with significant followings in the market. Both of these blockchains provide secure smart contract programmability with full support for DeFi (decentralized finance) Dapps.\n\nWhile these networks serve similar roles, they operate in a very different manner. Ethereum was the first blockchain to introduce smart contracts to the market successfully. This network remains a pioneering force in the industry. However, it does lack in terms of scalability and functionality compared to today's latest networks. Here\u2019s some insight into the Polkadot (DOT) vs Ethereum (ETH) debate.\n\nShared History\n\nThe first thing to understand is that Ethereum and Polkadot share a history. If Ethereum never succeeded, it is very likely that Polkadot would have never been an idea. This assumption can be made because Polkadot was founded by Ethereum co-developer, Gavin Wood.\n\nWood, who operated as the CTO and core developer on the protocol is one of the most recognizable and respected developers in the market. He invented the Solidity programming language which remains a core component of Ethereum. In early 2016, Wood decided to leave Ethereum to create a blockchain suited to the direction he saw the market heading. Polkadot was born out of this desire.\n\nWhat is Polkadot?\n\nPolkadot is a flexible decentralized network designed to connect blockchains securely. Developers can connect networks using Polkadot as a secure connectivity layer. The network enables developers to decide how much integration to leverage. This technical structure makes it easier to build Dapps. It introduces some new concepts to the crypto market which enables the network to offer lower fees and easier programmability.\n\nParity Technologies is the official company behind the project. This group originally operated as EthCore. In October 2017, the network hosted an ICO (initial coin offering) that secured $245 million. The ICO made headlines as one of the largest to date.\n\nIn 2018, Polkadot launched its testnet successfully and secured additional funding from the Web3 Foundation to further the network. Later in the year ChainSafe and Soramitsu received grants to implement the Polkadot Runtime Environment in Go and C++. Today, Polkadot encompasses a large ecosystem with new developers and users joining the network daily.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum launched in 2013 as an early comer to the market. Vitalik Buterin is Ethereum\u2019s founder and lead developer. He launched the protocol with the goal to streamline Dapp development and drive blockchain adoption. Like Polkadot, Ethereum hosted one of the largest ICOs of its time. The network raised $18 million from 11,000 international investors. This funding helped the network become what it is today.\n\nEthereum changed the market forever, as it switched the focus of cryptocurrencies from acting as money to supporting Dapps. Decentralized applications are a key component of the blockchain sector. Interestingly, Ethereum is often confused with its utility token ETHER (ETH). Ether is the token that enables smart contracts to run on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nEthereum is the world's largest Dapp ecosystem and the second-largest PoW (Proof-of-Work) in the world. Ethereum has seen considerable growth as the DeFi movement has leveraged its proven security. Today, Ethereum is the largest DeFi network in operation. The protocol remains a top choice for developers. However, there are some technical restrictions the network suffers from.\n\nWhat Problems was Polkadot (DOT) Built to Alleviate?\n\nPolkadot was built to provide an alternative to Ethereum that offered lower fees and more scalability. Polkadot integrates a sharded infrastructure to accomplish this task. Additionally, It enables developers to leverage multiple blockchains securely to build next-gen applications. To achieve this task, the network introduces the concept of parachains and parathreads.\n\nWhat Problems was Ethereum (ETH) Built to Alleviate?\n\nEthereum was built to simplify Dapp development. It was the first protocol to introduce smart contract scripting functionality to decentralized networks. The developers wanted to make it easy for people to enter the ecosystem. As such, they made Ethereum flexible in terms of programming languages. Ethereum developers may use C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and more.\n\nHow Does Polkadot Work?\n\nPolkadots uses parachains and apartheids to improve interoperability in the blockchain sector. Parachains are sovereign blockchains. They may have their own features, services, consensus, and tokens. These networks may also create their own governance systems. Parachains are best suited for specific use case scenarios.\n\nParathreads are networks that are designed to service Dapps that only require minimum blockchain integration. These networks operate on a pay-as-you-go model. This approach lowers the overall cost of integrating blockchain networks into most applications. Polkadot also integrates special bridges to communicate data between private and public networks.\n\nHow Does Ethereum Work?\n\nEthereum is a Proof-of-Work (PoW) network that relies on miners to approve transactions and validate the state of the network. Developers create programs called smart contracts that execute within the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). The cost of executing these programs is called gas. The more complex the smart contract and the higher the gas fees.\n\nEthereum is in the middle of a significant upgrade. The network will shift to Ethereum V2 in the coming months. This switch will include a change to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This maneuver will lower the operating costs and validation costs for the network. Currently, Ethereum has record-high gas fees.\n\nScalability\n\nPolkadot is a high-performance blockchain that can handle over 1000 transactions per second. In comparison, Ethereum supports 13-30 transactions per second in its current state. It\u2019s also far cheaper to send DOT compared to ETH at the moment.\n\nTokens\n\nPolkadot uses the DOT Token as part of its electronic payments system and decentralized smart contract environment. The token is flexible in that it can be staked to secure passive returns. You can also use it to participate in the Polkadot DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). This feature enables users to put forth proposals and upgrades to the network. The community votes on the changes, with approved measures funded from the community chest.\n\nEthereum relies on ETH as its main utility token. This successful coin is one of the most widely accepted cryptos in the world. Users can stake and farm ETH to secure ROIs. ETH token holders can put significant updates to a vote between miners. The protocol will also leverage off-chain communications and support methods to get changes introduced.\n\nHow to Buy Polkadot (DOT) and Ethereum (ETH)\n\nCurrently, Polkadot (DOT) and Ethereum (ETH) are each available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nUphold Disclaimer: Terms Apply. Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong..\n\nKraken \u2013 Founded in 2011, Kraken is one of the most trusted names in the industry with over 9,000,000 users, and over $207 billion in quarterly trading volume.\n\nThe Kraken exchange offers trading access to over 190 countries including Australia, Canada, Europe, and is a top exchange for USA residents. (Excluding New York & Washington state).\n\nPolkadot (DOT) vs Ethereum (ETH)\n\nLike an epic tale of titans in Greek mythology, Polkadot vs Ethereum pits two close relatives against each other. Both of these networks can provide you with the services needed to create powerful Dapps to serve clientele. Additionally, both have proven to be long-term projects to watch. For these reasons, it\u2019s smart to hold both of these tokens in your portfolio.\n\nTo learn more, make sure to visit our Investing in Polkadot (DOT) and Investing in Ethereum (ETH) guides."

        "content": "According to a recently released filing, former U.S. President and 2024 Republican frontrunner Donald Trump holds between $250,000 and $500,000 in Ethereum (ETH). The revelation comes as a surprise to many, as the former president has previously expressed his disdain for digital assets.\n\nThe crypto wallet in question is most likely connected to Trump\u2019s NFT (non-fungible token) collection, which was launched in December 2022. The limited collection has a total of 44,000 Trump-themed trading cards. The entire collection sold out in just one day, netting over $8.9 million in sales. The former president earned about $298,000 in licensing fees. Moreover, the earnings were collected in the same wallet that received the licensing fees.\n\nAlso Read: Donald Trump\u2019s Bitcoin Rejection Followed 155% Profit Opportunity\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s Ethereum holdings are surprising, given that the former U.S. President has previously said that he is \u201cnot a big fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\u201d However, given that the ETH has come from his NFT collection sales, it might not reflect any change in his views about crypto in general. Nonetheless, a former president holding Ethereum (ETH) is still a positive development for the industry.\n\nSource: Britannica\n\nThe U.S. Presidential election is just around the corner. On the Republican front, Francis Suarez, the mayor of Miami, and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy have both been very vocal about their support for crypto. Ron Desantis, the Florida governor, has vowed to end the Biden administration\u2019s \u201cwar on Bitcoin\u201d if elected.\n\nOn the democratic front, candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been very open about his support for cryptocurrencies. He has revealed that he and his family own about 14 Bitcoins (BTC), which are currently worth about $411,432, similar to Donald Trump\u2019s Ethereum value.\n\nAlso Read: X Fined $350,000 For Not Allowing Access to Trump Records\n\nTherefore, it seems that both Democrats and Republicans have crypto on their agendas for the 2025 Presidential elections, which is no surprise considering that Americans are the largest investors in crypto, by number, in the world."

        "title": "Dogecoin Vs. Ethereum \u2013 What's the Difference? - Securities.io",
        "content": "Savvy traders take the time to learn the differences between Dogecoin and Ethereum. These projects are both titans in the market, with each having changed the crypto-sphere considerably since being introduced. Here is everything you need to know about Dogecoin Vs. Ethereum\n\nWhat is Dogecoin?\n\nDogecoin entered the market in 2013 and is widely credited as the first meme coin to gain mainstream popularity. The history of this unique project is filled with twists and turns. Many people are surprised to learn that Dogecoin began as a joke. The token was made by a group of creditors to poke fun at the seriousness of die-hard Bitcoiners.\n\nLike most first-generation cryptocurrencies, the token borrows most of its technical features from Bitcoin. Dogecoin's developers Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus have stated that it only took a couple of hours to make the token. They reportedly started by taking Bitcoin\u2019s coding and switching out all references from Bitcoin to Dogecoin.\n\nChanges\n\nOf course, the project isn't a direct copy. The developers added some interesting upgrades to the consensus mechanism to improve Dogecoin's scalability. This strategy also helped to drive decentralization in the ecosystem. Dogecoin has had an interesting history with celebrities driving more attention to the projects as of late.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum entered the market one year after year after Dogecoin in 2014. Unlike Dogecoin, the network marked a huge upgrade in the capabilities of blockchain networks. The network ushered in the age of smart contract programmability. Ethereum was founded by Vitalik Buterin, Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Anthony Di Iorio, and Joseph Lubin.\n\nSecond Generation Blockchain\n\nEthereum can be regarded as the first second-generation blockchain. Unlike Bitcoin, its primary purpose was not to serve as electronic cash, but rather, as a programmable infrastructure for decentralized applications (dApps). This strategy forever changed the crypto market, with nearly every blockchain today having some form of smart contract programmability.\n\nEthereum is arguably the most innovative cryptocurrency in terms of pioneering market-altering maneuvers. For example, the network is the largest Dapp and DeFi ecosystem in the world. Ethereum deserves recognition for driving the 2017 breakout of crypto with the release of \u2018ERC20' \u2013 a token standard that provides users with an affordable way to create tokens for the first time.\n\nICO Rush\n\nThis development resulted in a rush of new tokens entering the market. For example, there are over 300,000 ERC-20 tokens in circulation today. Ethereum remains the most popular Dapp and DeFi network.\n\nThe protocol is still the reigning king even though it's slower, less capable, and more expensive than newer protocols. The simple fact that Ethereum remains secure and has so much liquidity makes it a smart choice for many applications despite its shortcomings.\n\nWhat Problems Was Dogecoin Built to Alleviate?\n\nDogecoin was designed to tackle a serious issue in the crypto market \u2013 a lack of fun. It's too easy to drown new users out about blockchain assets and their security and efficiency, but that doesn\u2019t spark interest or entertain people. Dogecoin leveraged the adorableness of one of the world's most popular memes to connect with people on a personal level.\n\nDogecoin provided a faster alternative to Bitcoin when it was released. The developers altered the consensus mechanism from the SHA-256 version to a script-based option. This maneuver improved the protocol's speed and responsiveness. It also ensured that miners couldn\u2019t use ASIC miners to mine the network at first, which led to sustained decentralization.\n\nWhat Problems Was Ethereum Built to Alleviate?\n\nEthereum was meant to create more usability within the blockchain sector. The team behind the project wanted to leverage the computing power of blockchains further. They quickly realized that the market needed a reliable and easy-to-use infrastructure. Ethereum provided this to the market and has been the go-to blockchain for developers ever since.\n\nEthereum was made to be more scalable than the competition at the time. The network can handle 15 transactions per second. This tps rate may seem slow compared to today's high-performance networks but it was faster than competitors when it launched. Currently, the network is in the middle of a major conversion from PoW to PoS.\n\nHow Does Dogecoin Work?\n\nDogecoin operates as a layer 1 blockchain. The protocol leverages a network of nodes that secure the network and validate transactions. The system enables users to send value internationally in a permissionless manner.\n\nDOGE is the cryptocurrency for the network. Uniquely, DOGE has seen serious support from some of the most famous people in the world. For example, one of the richest men in the world, Elon Musk, has Tweeted multiple times in support of the token. The token has also seen support from famous musicians including Kiss singer Gene Simmons and rapper Snoop Dogg.\n\nHow Does Ethereum Work?\n\nEthereum currently uses a PoW system that relies on miners to validate the state of the blockchain. Developers can leverage various Ethereum standards and tools to streamline their creative efforts. For example, the ERC-20 tokens standard is the most popular in the world. There are also specific standards for token types such as security tokens, stablecoins, and NFTs (nonfungible tokens).\n\nTrader Confusion\n\nMany people get the crypto Ether (ETH) and its blockchain Ethereum confused. Ethereum is the network that supports the utility token ETH. This confusion is forgivable as it has now become common to refer to Ether as Ethereum for most traders. Interestingly, the planned Ethereum 2.0 update will improve the network's scalability considerably.\n\nThis maneuver is considered necessary by many as Ethereum has high gas fees at the moment. These fees have made it expensive for users to participate in the network. It has also driven developers to seek out lower-cost alternatives in the market.\n\nHow to Buy Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum (ETH)\n\nCurrently, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum (ETH) are each available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nUphold Disclaimer: Terms Apply. Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong..\n\nKraken \u2013 Founded in 2011, Kraken is one of the most trusted names in the industry with over 9,000,000 users, and over $207 billion in quarterly trading volume.\n\nThe Kraken exchange offers trading access to over 190 countries including Australia, Canada, Europe, and is a top exchange for USA residents. (Excluding New York & Washington state).\n\nDogecoin Vs. Ethereum \u2013 Old School Cryptos Keeping it Fresh\n\nNow that you know the differences between Dogecoin (DOGE) vs Ethereum (ETH), you can easily see is how each of these projects fits into your trading strategy. Both tokens have proven to be resilient. As such, there is potential for long-term profitability.\n\nTo learn more, make sure to visit our Investing in Dogecoin and Investing in Ethereum guides."

        "title": "Cosmos Vs. Ethereum - What's the Difference? - Securities.io",
        "content": "After the launch of Bitcoin in 2009, developers from all over the world started getting interested in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. For years, they were trying to make new projects on their own blockchains, sometimes as a fork of Bitcoin\u2019s own chain, and sometimes building a new chain from scratch.\n\nHowever, since these were literally the earliest days of crypto and blockchain, most of those chains were very similar to the original ones. Some were a bit faster than Bitcoin\u2019s, or more scalable, but in the end, the differences were minimal. This changed in 2015 with the launch of Ethereum, which revolutionized the blockchain sector by pointing out its other use cases, such as the ability to store code.\n\nThis led to the creation of smart contracts, and through them, to the creation of numerous new blockchain products, countless projects, and a new era of unique use cases and experimentation with this technology, whose potential suddenly seemed limitless.\n\nOver time, Ethereum\u2019s own network started seeing issues, particularly when it comes to scalability and processing speed, with countless projects and trends launching on top of it, and little to no improvements in its performance. The end result was a rise in fees, as everyone wanted their transaction to be processed first, so they started offering more and more money to the validators in hopes that their transaction will be the most attractive. This led to such high fees that many started leaving Ethereum because they simply couldn\u2019t afford to pay the fees anymore.\n\nOf course, they were still not interested in abandoning the crypto/blockchain industry, which is why they started seeking other, more affordable chains with high functionalities, and Cosmos (ATOM) emerged as an interesting solution. Over time, there have been multiple comparisons of the two chains, which led many to ask whether these are similar blockchains. The simple answer is that they are not. However, to understand the long version, we should first look into what Ethereum and Cosmos are, and how they work.\n\nAbout Ethereum\n\nEthereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain system that runs its own native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH). However, it also works as a platform for countless other cryptocurrencies and projects thanks to the fact that it introduced token models, such as ERC-20. This is a utility token model, and it allowed developers to quickly and easily create their own token without having to build it from scratch, unlike the devs from the early days.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Ethereum pioneered the concept of smart contracts and its platform was the first-ever blockchain smart contract platform. These are self-executed, immutable computer programs that can serve as a way for two or more parties to reach agreements, but their more complex use cases include running decentralized applications, DeFi protocols, and more.\n\nEthereum\u2019s principal innovation lies in its platform\u2019s design, which allows the execution of smart contracts using blockchain technology. There is no need for expensive intermediaries, just a contract with specified terms that is triggered on its own once the terms have been met.\n\nIn addition to smart contracts, Ethereum\u2019s blockchain also hosts other cryptocurrencies, which are called tokens. Each token is a separate protocol, but they all use Ethereum\u2019s network, and they can be tied to other products, such as DeFi protocols, metaverse projects, and more. Apart from the mentioned utility tokens, Ethereum has other token models, such as the ERC-721 model which is used for creating non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nAbout Cosmos\n\nOn the other hand, we have Cosmos (ATOM), which is a project that aims to solve some of the problems that projects like Ethereum and Bitcoin have been facing. Specifically, these involve performance-affecting issues, such as the lack of scalability, low transaction throughput, long waiting periods, high fees, and the eco-harmful impact that these networks have due to their reliance on Proof-Of-Work algorithm, which requires massive amounts of electricity and processing power.\n\nCosmos has a series of goals, but it primarily focuses on making blockchain technology less complex and difficult for developers, and it can achieve this through a modular framework, that demystifies dApps. It also features an Interblockchain Communication protocol, which allows blockchain networks to communicate with each other. At the same time, the Cosmos ecosystem is a rather complex network itself.\n\nThere is a lot going on in its ecosystem, but its advanced technology allows it all to function without hiccups, and its architecture allows for high amounts of activity without burdening the network so much to affect it in the way Ethereum was affected.\n\nThe main question now is how do they compare, and can they be compared in the first place?\n\nCosmos vs Ethereum\n\nThe first thing to understand is that the Cosmos blockchain is not Ethereum\u2019s competitor, unlike other major chains, such as Solana, Avalanche, and Polkadot. Cosmos does not wish to replace Ethereum, nor is its technology designed in a way that would encourage the pursuit of this.\n\nInstead, it provides complimentary blockchain development frameworks that were created for the devs on the network, and they allow the developers to launch their own blockchains. This is a completely different kind of service that the Ethereum blockchain does not offer at this time.\n\nAnother thing to note is that there are blockchains launched in Cosmos\u2019 ecosystem that do aim to replace Ethereum, but that doesn\u2019t mean that Cosmos itself has this goal.\n\nThe best way to explain what they are and what the relationship between the two is like would be the following:\n\nEthereum is a general-use blockchain where the devs can build side chains that use smart contracts to make changes to Ethereum's blockchain. However, the problem with this is that the smart contracts are all general purpose, which makes them limited in functionality. So, more complex projects have to resort to combining multiple basic contracts to achieve the desired functionality for their project.\n\nThis, however, severely increases gas prices, due to the fact that it creates more work for the network, and clogs it, so transaction times get slower. Furthermore, these projects also compete amongst themselves to have their transactions be the next in the first upcoming block, which is why they offer higher fees, which is why the average transaction fee gets extremely high.\n\nThen, there are all other ERC-20 token-based projects that are also governed by Ethereum. Not to mention the proposals that get passed and are expected to make network changes often impact the usage of some other project, which leads to an entire series of other problems. All of this makes Ethereum very slow, very impractical, overly complex, and simply put, it all results in a real mess.\n\nCosmos has invented a different structure for its own projects, which makes things look a lot cleaner, and run a lot smoother.\n\nThe Cosmos Network is an ecosystem that was designed for projects to build their own, native blockchains which are custom-tailored for the project\u2019s needs. The projects also keep the ability to make transactions to other connected blockchains that belong to the Cosmos ecosystem. With all projects running on separate chains that are, generally speaking, almost independent, and still connected, there is a lot less confusion about what is going on, and who will be affected by any potential changes. This also reduces gas costs overall and doesn't throttle transactional throughput.\n\nAs for the matters of governance, each blockchain is free to govern itself with the help of its own community. That way, any proposals that are passed through the voting process will only affect that single blockchain, instead of Cosmos\u2019 entire ecosystem, and potentially disrupt other projects in some way. This also makes it easier and faster to reach a consensus regarding the proposals, as projects don\u2019t have to wait for every other project to get on board and give the green light before the updates are made.\n\nThe Cosmos project itself is completely separate from this concept, and it exists as a blockchain that controls the Cosmos Hub, which is the most widely used structure in the network and connects all of these separate chains into one big network.\n\nHow to Buy Cosmos (ATOM) and Ethereum (ETH)\n\nCurrently, Cosmos (ATOM) and Ethereum (ETH) are each available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nUphold Disclaimer: Terms Apply. Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong..\n\nKraken \u2013 Founded in 2011, Kraken is one of the most trusted names in the industry with over 9,000,000 users, and over $207 billion in quarterly trading volume.\n\nThe Kraken exchange offers trading access to over 190 countries including Australia, Canada, Europe, and is a top exchange for USA residents. (Excluding New York & Washington state).\n\nConclusion\n\nWith everything said and done, we can say that Cosmos and Ethereum are not really comparable in a traditional sense. Cosmos does things in a completely different way and with different goals in mind. It has become an internet of blockchains on a small scale, where multiple blockchain projects exist.\n\nEthereum is a network that relies on sidechains that are still depending on its main blockchain, which is where all this traffic that is clogging its network comes from. In the end, we can say that Cosmos is a more efficient and cleaner solution, although Ethereum could still be effective if it were more scalable. Scalability lies at the heart of most of its problems, and solving that issue would bring the project back to glory.\n\nEthereum has been working hard on achieving that, and for a long time now, too. However, the update that is supposed to make it happen, the so-called Ethereum 2.0, is still being implemented, and it will take time for it to fully arrive and make a difference.\n\nTo learn more, make sure to visit our Investing in Cosmos and Investing in Ethereum guides."

        "title": "Hedera Vs. Ethereum (2024 Edition) - Securities.io",
        "content": "For the last 13 and a half years, since the launch of Bitcoin, blockchain technology has been captivating the minds of developers from all over the world. Even more so after 2015, with the launch of Ethereum. While Bitcoin did introduce the blockchain, for the next six years of its existence, it was only used for recording transactions.\n\nOnly after Ethereum\u2019s launch and the discovery that blockchain can also record code did its development truly start. This led to the creation of smart contracts, and through them \u2014 every other product that blockchain has to offer today, including token models, dApps, DeFi, metaverse, and more.\n\nOf course, this still did not perfect blockchain technology. Instead, some of the most pressing issues remained, such as the lack of scalability. Even Ethereum suffers from this problem. In fact, many would say that Ethereum is the prime example of this problem, with such a busy network and the inability to scale.\n\nHowever, the blockchain industry could not survive with this issue troubling its blockchains, which is why developers started working on finding the solution, which led to the launch of projects such as Hedera Hashgraph. Today, we wanted to see what Hedera has to offer, and to compare it with Ethereum and see just how different the two projects really are.\n\nAbout Ethereum\n\nTo start off, let\u2019s talk about Ethereum first. Launched in 2015 as the crypto industry\u2019s first development platform, rather than a simple digital ledger, Ethereum has introduced smart contracts which led to the creation of the crypto world\u2019s largest ecosystem to date. With the introduction of the ability to build on it, the Ethereum network soon started attracting developers from all corners of the world.\n\nThe developers would use its technology to create new cryptocurrencies, develop decentralized applications, and over time, more complex products emerged. All of this made Ethereum\u2019s network extremely rich, and extremely busy, which is why it definitely deserves to be the world\u2019s largest altcoin, and the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, while Bitcoin is, without a doubt, the slowest blockchain where scalability virtually doesn\u2019t exist due to its 7 TPS, Ethereum is not much better with 15 TPS. In the early days while it only had a handful of users, everything was perfectly fine, as the network could handle their transactions. These days, however, with thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of users from all over the world, Ethereum simply can\u2019t cope with demand.\n\nNow, in the crypto industry, users need to pay a transaction fee when conducting transactions. But, they also get to choose how much they wish to pay. However, as they discovered after a while, the transactions with the largest fees tend to be processed first, so everyone who was in a hurry to have their payment verified would pay a high fee. This led to people increasing the fee that they were paying, so those who were in a hurry had to start paying even more, only for the rest of the community to follow.\n\nThis is how the average fee grew to the levels where it no longer makes sense to pay it, as it often exceeded the value of the transaction itself. In other words, users could no longer afford to even use Ethereum, which is why alternative chains started being created. Among them, we have Hedera Hashgraph.\n\nAbout Hedera Hashgraph\n\nHedera Hashgrapsh was founded through an ICO in mid-2018, emerging as a sustainable, enterprise-grade public network meant to drive the decentralized economy that allows individuals and businesses alike to create powerful decentralized applications.\n\nHowever, seeing the issues on Ethereum and Bitcoin, the project\u2019s developers designed it to be a more efficient system that would eliminate the limitations of these older platforms, including instability and slow performance.\n\nOriginally, Hedera launched open access to its mainnet only a year after its ICO, in September 2019. Meanwhile, its native token, HBAR, is used for powering the network and its services, including smart contracts, file storage, regular transactions, and alike. HBAR is also used for securing the network through staking.\n\nEthereum vs Hedera Hashgraph\n\nSo, how do these two very similar, and yet very different chains compare?\n\nTo start with Ethereum \u2014 this blockchain has been the inception of modern blockchain technology. It emerged as a decentralized public ledger with two main components \u2014 a native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), and its own programming language called Solidity.\n\nEthereum introduced a variety of concepts that did not exist before, which makes it the first of its kind. Meanwhile, the project\u2019s users from all over the world could access it, create, publish, monetize, and use dApps, and in doing so, enrich its entire ecosystem. Before long, Ethereum became a haven for creating and sharing applications, financial services, business, and more. In this sense, Hedera is not much different from Ethereum\u2019s network. However, it does have several basic technical differences that make a huge difference in the long run.\n\nThe first major difference to note is that Hedera Hashgraph operates across the hashgraph consensus algorithm. It functions as a public distributed ledger, with a governing body created to support new and existing dApps at large scale.\n\nAnother major difference between the two projects is the hashgraph consensus algorithm. Hashgraph basically changes the concept of pruning in blockchain, and replaces it with weaving in the DLT sector. It controls the branches of the blocks and puts them back into the ledger\u2019s body, ensuring that everything across the blockchain functions in perfect order.\n\nThis is already a significant improvement over Ethereum\u2019s PoW algorithm that selects one single miner who will choose the next block. Hedera has significantly changed this entire concept with the hashgraph algorithm, as the project believes that the community of nodes needs to agree on which transactions should be allowed.\n\nHow to Buy Hedera (HBAR) and Ethereum (ETH)\n\nCurrently, Hedera (HBAR) and Ethereum (ETH) are each available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nUphold Disclaimer: Terms Apply. Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong..\n\nKraken \u2013 Founded in 2011, Kraken is one of the most trusted names in the industry with over 9,000,000 users, and over $207 billion in quarterly trading volume.\n\nThe Kraken exchange offers trading access to over 190 countries including Australia, Canada, Europe, and is a top exchange for USA residents. (Excluding New York & Washington state).\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum is, without a doubt, the second most important crypto project that was ever invented, immediately after Bitcoin. Bitcoin started the crypto industry, but Ethereum and its products are responsible for the crypto/blockchain world that we have today, with all the different trends and products available to us today.\n\nWithout it, we would simply have a bunch of copies of BTC, and nothing else \u2014 no DeFi, no metaverse, no NFTs, or even dApps. However, even with that said, Ethereum has its flaws, and while it is working towards resolving them, it is still questionable how much success it can have.\n\nHedera and other chains that offer greater scalability have already eliminated all of these issues permanently, and we know for a fact that they have adequate levels of scalability. In other words, while we have a lot to be thankful for when it comes to Ethereum, its role in the future of crypto has yet to be decided."

        "title": "Shiba Inu vs. Ethereum 2.0 - What's the Difference? - Securities.io",
        "content": "The discussion of Shiba Inu vs. Ethereum 2.0 compares the largest DeFi ecosystem against a popular meme coin with DeFi features. Both networks offer scalability and advanced services. Here are the differences between Shiba Inu vs. Ethereum 2.0.\n\nWhat is Shiba Inu?\n\nShiba Inu launched in 2020 to much publicity. The token takes inspiration from the meme coin movements leader Dogecoin and introduces a lot of other features that make it more advanced than its predecessors.\n\nShiba Inu isn't a knockoff of Dogecoin and was launched as a Dogecoin killer. It's a complete DeFi ecosystem that offers users a variety of features like staking. The Shiba Inu project took the unique approach of pricing tokens for fractions of a cent.\n\nThe goal of this approach was to enable anyone to purchase and hold millions of tokens. The goal is that the ecosystem will grow to push the token's value to $1. At that point, all the holders would see significant windfalls.\n\nWhat is Ethereum 2.0?\n\nEthereum 2.0 is the latest upgrade made to the hugely popular Ethereum blockchain. This was the largest upgrade to date. It converted the PoW (Proof-of-Work) consensus mechanism to a PoS (Proof-of-Stake) network.\n\nThe upgrade placed Ethereum in line with fourth-generation competitors by expanding scalability and lowering energy consumption. Ethereum today is the largest DeFi ecosystem and remains a pioneer in the market.\n\nWhat Problems Was Shiba Inu Built to Alleviate?\n\nShiba Inu was designed to solve a couple of main issues in the market. The token takes cues from Dogecoin in that it leverages the popular Shiba Inu meme to help make the project more relatable. Meme coins combine society's moments with humor.\n\nShiba Inu brings DeFi functionality to the meme coin sector. For the longest time, meme coins were only seen as a comical way to conduct crypto transactions. Today's advanced meme coins combine DeFi features to produce ROIs.\n\nWhat Problems Was Ethereum 2.0 Built to Alleviate?\n\nEthereum 2.0 was designed to alleviate the congestion issues of the original Ethereum network. Additionally, it was the first network to introduce smart contract support. However, the network was designed as a PoW network which required a lot of energy to secure.\n\nEthereum 2.0 eliminates high energy consumption. There are no more miners needed to validate the network. Instead, users can stake their tokens which can be more democratic while providing rewards.\n\nHow Does Shiba Inu Work?\n\nShiba Inu is an ERC-20-compliant network built on the Ethereum blockchain. It leverages a non-custodial design, a high-performance DEX, multiple DeFi services, and tokens to provide a unique combination of passive income options.\n\nThe ShibSwap exchange is where users can trade their SHIB for other tokens in the Ethereum ecosystem. This non-custodial exchange provides near real-time transactions and scalability. Users can leverage the platform using an ERC-20 compatible wallet which makes it easy to onboard.\n\nSHIB\n\nSHIB serves multiple roles in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. It's the utility token that is tasked with fees and rewards. The token can be staked to secure passive returns and may be used as a cryptocurrency.\n\nLeash\n\nLEASH is a secondary token that Shiba Inu users can hold to leverage the price of DOGE on the ETH blockchain. The LEASH token operates as a store of value assets with a limited supply. The token re-bases every day at 6:30 AM UTC to 1000/1 the price of DOGE.\n\nHow Does Ethereum 2.0 Work?\n\nEthereum 2.0 adds Sharding technology to the ecosystem. Sharding is a method of storing data that improves performance. Sharded blockchains can scale much faster than non-sharded options.\n\nEthereum 2.0 improves programmability in a variety of ways. The network is now able to be programmed in languages including C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and more. These options improve Dapp creation and enable more developers to participate.\n\nEthereum 2.0 Serenity\n\nThe upgraded version of Ethereum has more sustainability compared to its previous version. Ethereum 2.0 does away with power-hungry miners. These nodes can drive up the energy requirements of the network to new heights. Ethereum 2.0 is all about reducing the carbon footprint.\n\nThe network upgrade increases bandwidth as a way to improve scalability further. This expansion was needed to support the massive amount of new DeFi and GameFi protocols launching on the blockchain.\n\nEthereum Validator Nodes\n\nAnyone can qualify to be a validator node with the new Ethereum setup. They simply need to meet the minimum staking requirements. These requirements are set at 32 ETH at this time. Those who don't have that much ETH can still stake using staking pools.\n\nETH\n\nETH (Ether) is the utility token for the network. This token is required to execute smart contracts and transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. It's common for people to confuse Ethereum the blockchain with Ether the utility token.\n\nETH is one of the top-performing blockchain assets and is the utility token for the most popular DeFi network in the world. Ethereum also leads the world in token launches, NFTs, and a variety of other crucial stats. As such, it remains a staple in the crypto community.\n\nHow to Buy Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ethereum (ETH)\n\nCurrently, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ethereum (ETH) are each available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nKraken \u2013 Founded in 2011, Kraken is one of the most trusted names in the industry with over 9,000,000 users, and over $207 billion in quarterly trading volume.\n\nThe Kraken exchange offers trading access to over 190 countries including Australia, Canada, Europe, and is a top exchange for USA residents. (Excluding New York & Washington state).\n\nUphold Disclaimer: Terms Apply. Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong..\n\nShiba Inu vs. Ethereum 2.0 \u2013 Son vs Father\n\nIt's difficult to compare Shiba Inu to Ethereum as the network is built atop Ethereum. Shiba Inu adds a fun twist to the DeFi movement which helps to bring new users into the fold. On the other hand, the latest version of Ethereum 2.0 can take on the tasks required by advanced DeFi protocols.\n\nWhen comparing the two, Ethereum can be seen as a far better store of value in the long term. However, Shiba Inu's continued network expansion and community growth means that the project is here to stay for the foreseeable future. Additionally, the rise of meme coins again in the market has placed renewed light on the project.\n\nTo learn more, make sure to visit our Investing in Shiba Inu and Investing in Ethereum guides."

        "title": "VeChain Vs. Ethereum 2.0 - Everything You Need to Know - Securities.io",
        "content": "VeChain Vs. Ethereum 2.0 is a popular discussion that crypto traders have when attempting to delve deeper into smart contract-capable blockchains. Both of these networks offer fast performance, passive income staking opportunities, and smart contract programmability.\n\nUnderstanding the differences between Ethereum 2.0 Vs. VeChain can help you to improve your effectiveness in the market.\n\nWhat is Ethereum 2.0?\n\nEthereum began as the first smart contract programmable blockchain. This feature changed the market forever as it enabled decentralized networks to run protocols and systems more effectively. The original structure of the Ethereum network leveraged a PoW (Proof of Work) consensus like Bitcoin.\n\nDuring a massive hack during the Ethereum DAO launch, the network founders decided to hardfork the blockchain to prevent the loss of millions in crypto. The decisions led to the creation of Ethereum Classic and Ethereum. The latter of which recently converted over to a PoS (Proof of Stake) network as a way to reduce congestion and improve efficiency, which we are calling Ethereum 2.0.\n\nWhat is VeChain\n\nVeChain (VET) seeks to function as a valuable bridge between Defi and Cefi networks. This enterprise-grade blockchain was specifically built to help ease some of the pain points of the logistics sector. The protocol integrates advanced sensors and real-time blockchain consensus to create a new level of logical awareness and planning.\n\nVeChain was created by Sunny Lu and launched on the Ethereum blockchain at first. After raising funds, the network launched its blockchain and tokens.\n\nToday, VeChain offers a way for major corporations to save millions in shipping and logistics. It also supports programming and Dapps.\n\nWhat Problems Was Ethereum 2.0 Built to Alleviate?\n\nEthereum 2.0 was a major upgrade that was specifically designed to help reduce network congestion and alter consensus. The original structure of Ethereum was designed with a function that increased network fees alongside congestion. This system worked at first because the added fees reduced spam on the blockchain.\n\nWhen Ethereum released the ERC-20 token standard, everything changed. The network became the clear network pioneer in terms of DeFi and token issuance. This added congestion caused the network to lose capabilities due to lag and high fees. The results were that people began to migrate to other competing networks. The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade was meant to eliminate these issues and bring the network in line with today's most advanced networks.\n\nEthereum 2.0 does away with the high energy demands of PoW networks. The system uses less energy and is faster. Additionally, anyone can stake their tokens and secure returns if they meet the minimum requirements.\n\nWhat Problems Was VeChain Built to Alleviate?\n\nVeChain helps to resolve several issues that have long hurt the logistics sector. The integration of sensors and the capabilities of the network to provide large-scale real-time tracking of these massive systems helps to alleviate the lack of transparency that occurs in the sector.\n\nUnlike centralized networks, decentralized networks become more responsive as more members join. Consequently, these protocols are great for reducing last-mile issues such as data degradation and delays. VeChain removes centralized choke points from the logistics sector which improves efficiency.\n\nOne of the biggest issues with logistics is the fact that the network is so large and expands the entire globe. When you have such a large network, even processing all the data can cause delays. VeChain integrates multiple steps to enable the tracking of a massive amount of data including quality, authenticity, storage temperature, and geo-location.\n\nHow Does Ethereum 2.0 Work?\n\nThe upgraded version of Ethereum relies on network nodes called validators to remain secure. Anyone can become a validator but they must meet certain criteria. You will need to have reliable internet connections. Secondly, you have to meet the deposit requirements of 32 ETH. Those who can't meet this deposit can leverage staking pools to still secure rewards.\n\nUnlike the previous consensus that required miners to consume massive amounts of electricity, the upgraded model is viewed as being more sustainable. Additionally, some perceive it as more democratic because users do not need to purchase a mining rig or learn new technical skills. These upgrades help to improve Ethereum DeFi capabilities by reducing costs.\n\nToken \u2013 ETH\n\nEther (ETH) is the main utility token for the network. This token can be used as a cryptocurrency but its primary purpose is to function as the main token on the Ethereum blockchain. Developers use ETH to pay for smart contract executions. Regular users pay fees using ETH.\n\nNotably, ETH is one of the top cryptocurrencies in the world.\n\nHow Does VeChain Work?\n\nVeChain can provide immense upgrades to the logistic sector thanks to the integration of sensors and RFID technology. The use of smart sensors improves all aspects of the logistics sector when coupled with the monitoring capabilities of blockchain tech. VeChain employs smart chips in the form of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags.\n\nThese sensors can monitor and send vital data regarding shipments. Since the data is broadcast in real time, it enables the logistics firm to improve efficiency. VeChain users can see crucial info on shipments including authenticity and its current condition. The network is one of the largest to support IoT (Internet of Things) tech. There are currently billions of IoT devices in the world.\n\nToken \u2013 VET\n\nVET is the main utility token for the VeChain ecosystem. This token is used to send value internationally in a permissionless manner but its primary purpose is to pay for transactions and smart contract executions on the network. VET is a flexible asset and can be found on multiple top CEXs (centralized exchanges).\n\nHow to Buy VeChain (VET) and Ethereum (ETH)\n\nCurrently, Ethereum (ETH) and VeChain (VET) are each available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nUphold Disclaimer: Terms Apply. Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong..\n\nKuCoin \u2013 This exchange currently offers cryptocurrency trading of over 300 other popular tokens. It is often the first to offer buying opportunities for new tokens. USA Residents are Prohibited.\n\nVeChain Vs. Ethereum 2.0 \u2013 Smart Networks Geared at Different Clientele\n\nWhen you delve deep into the Ethereum 2.0 Vs. VeChain discussion, it becomes obvious that Ethereum is a broad network while Vechain has a niche focus. Both networks can support the Dapp programmability. However, Ethereum has a massive community making it ideal for the average user. In comparison, VeCahain is best suited for enterprise logistic operations.\n\nTo learn more about each of these projects, make sure to visit our Investing in Ethereum 2.0 and Investing in VeChain guides."

        "title": "Bitcoin Vs. Ethereum (2024 Edition) - Securities.io",
        "content": "As an educated crypto investor, it\u2019s crucial you understand the differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum. Both of these coins are titans in the market, albeit for different reasons. Both coins are vital for the market's development at this point. Here's what makes these coins so different but, yet so important in the market.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin was the world's first successful cryptocurrency. Satoshi Nakamoto changed the world when he introduced his revolutionary protocol. His goal was to create a \u201cpeer-to-peer electronic cash system\u201d that was both censorship-resistant and decentralized.\n\nHe succeeded in his mission when he officially launched Bitcoin in 2009. Since that time, Bitcoin has seen tremendous growth both financially and technologically. However, at its core, it still remains accessible to anyone. Bitcoin changed the world forever and inspired a new industry. For these reasons, you can consider Bitcoin the first generation of cryptocurrencies.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin is not stagnant and the protocol continually develops. However, it was built to serve its particular purpose. Consequently, it\u2019s not the best option for features such as smart contracts or other next-gen blockchain functionalities. Notably, the introduction of second-layer protocols such as the Lightning Network expands Bitcoins functionality considerably.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is a distributed, public blockchain. This decentralized network introduced the world to smart contract scripting functionality. These protocols allowed anyone to build decentralized applications and expand the use cases for cryptocurrencies. Today, there are thousands of different cryptos and blockchain projects. However, most utilize some forms of smart contracts to streamline network activities.\n\nNot Exactly A Cryptocurrency\n\nIt\u2019s important you understand that Ethereum isn't a cryptocurrency. Ethereum is the platform that the cryptocurrency Ether functions within. This network functions as a programmable decentralized network for Dapp developers primarily. Additionally, Ether's primary role is to compensate miners for performing EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) computations.\n\nEthereum was the first cryptocurrency network built specifically to support Dapp development. Dapps are applications designed to run on decentralized networks. The first Dapps ran on decentralized networks such as Tor networks. These networks are censorship-resistant due to their decentralized nature.\n\nDapps that run on blockchain networks are at the core of the blockchain revolution. In this way, Ethereum represented a fundamental shift in the development and functionality of cryptocurrencies moving forward. For these reasons, Ethereum is considered a second-generation cryptocurrency\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nTo execute smart contracts, Ethereum introduces a unique protocol known as the EVM \u2013 the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Each full Ethereum node runs an instant of these virtual stacks. The main advantage of EVMs is that they improve the process of building decentralized applications by improving the programmability and efficiency that the network executes contract byte code.\n\nHistory of Ethereum\n\nOne of Bitcoin's early followers was a computer developer by the name of Vitalik Buterin. In 2013, this advantageous individual decided to build a new cryptocurrency. This new project would share many technical characteristics with Bitcoin. For example, both coins utilize a Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm to validate the state of the network.\n\nConsensus\n\nBitcoin utilizes the SHA-256 algorithm. This mathematical equation requires miners to prove their work through advanced calculations. The network automatically adjusts its difficulty to ensure that blocks of transactions only get approved in ten-minute intervals. This approach ensures a predictive monetary issuance strategy until the last Bitcoin gets mined sometime in 2140.\n\nEthereum, like Bitcoin, currently uses a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus protocol. However, Ethereum uses the Ethash algorithm. Buterin decided on this mechanism to help reduce the advantage of specialized ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) mining rigs. ASIC mining rigs are built from the ground up to solve the SHA-256 algorithm Bitcoin uses. Critics of ASIC miners argue that these high-priced rigs cause centralization in the Bitcoin network.\n\nBlock Times\n\nWhen comparing the transaction thru put of the networks, Ethereum comes out far ahead of Bitcoin. Bitcoin approves blocks every 10 minutes. These blocks hold no more than 1MB of data. Consequently, Bitcoin is only capable of around 7 transactions per second. This low data rate was built into Bitcoin's core coding to ensure that anyone could use the network.\n\nThe Ethereum network is capable of approximately 15 transactions per second. These capabilities are set to improve significantly following the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 update. This upgrade would push Ethereum's capabilities closer to 100,000 transactions per second according to developers.\n\nMining Rewards\n\nThere are different mining rewards paid out to nodes on each network. Bitcoin miners receive a reward of 6.5 BTC if they are the node that completes the SHA-256 equation first and adds the next block to the blockchain. Comparingly, Ethereum miners receive a reward of 2 ETH for their participation in validating blocks of transactions.\n\nTotal Supply \u2013 Bitcoin vs Ethereum\n\nBitcoin caps its supply of 21,000,000 coins. This strategy ensures that Bitcoin retains scarcity in the market. Reversely, there is no cap on the amount of Ether (ETH). The network must continue to produce ETH indefinitely to cover gas fees created by developers executing EVMs. Currently, there are 114,467,625.91 ETH in circulation today.\n\nEthereum to go PoS\n\nInterestingly, Ethereum is set to do a major upgrade this year to Ethereum 2.0. This hard fork would place ETH on a new blockchain that runs on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm. PoS networks remove miners and rely on coin holders staking their tokens to validate the network's state.\n\nPoS networks are far more energy-efficient and cheaper to maintain. They also provide faster transaction times compared to PoW networks. Best of all, there is no need to purchase expensive mining equipment because all you need is a network wallet to stake your coins on a PoS system.\n\nThe ETH ICO vs Bitcoin's Launch\n\nBitcoin had a quiet launch that was celebrated by only a select few in the cypherpunk and development community taking any notice of this monumental invention. Interestingly, Bitcoin's journey officially began with the genesis block. This is the first block of Bitcoin's blockchain. While no one knows for sure how many Bitcoins Nakamoto mined, estimates put his rewards at 1 million Bitcoin.\n\nIn comparison, Ethereum entered the market with much more fanfare. The Ethereum ICO (Initial Coin Offering) raised $18 million. Ethereum continued this momentum into the launch of the first DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). This event took place in April 2016. The launch of the DAO boosted Ethereum's status and helped the network to secure $150 million in its public ICO. At the time, the DAO was the largest crowdfunding event to take place in the blockchain industry.\n\nApples vs Oranges\n\nNow that you have a better understanding of the differences between Bitcoin vs Ethereum, it\u2019s easy to see why both projects have longevity in the sector. As such, most crypto investors hold both of these coins in their portfolios.\n\nTo learn more, make sure to visit our Investing in Bitcoin and Investing in Ethereum guides.\n\nHow to Buy Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)\n\nThese are two of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world. The exchanges below enable the purchase of both of these digital assets."

        "title": "Ethereum Vs. Cardano (2024 Edition) - Securities.io",
        "content": "As the blockchain Dapp battle continues to expand, there has been a lot of debate regarding Ethereum (ETH) vs Cardano (ADA). Both of these platforms were built to support the expansion of Dapps by simplifying programming processes. Notably, Ethereum is the pioneer in the sector as it was the world's first successful programable public blockchain.\n\nRecently, this gen-two blockchain has run into scalability issues. These concerns have fueled interest in alternatives in the market. Consequently, a lot of developers have started to migrate from Ethereum to Cardano in an attempt to avoid congestion and high fees.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is a distributed, public blockchain. However, people often use the term to describe Ether, the project's utility token. Ethereum has been pivotal to the overall development of the crypto market in many ways. Aside from introducing the market to smart contract functionalities, it is also the leading network for ICOs, DeFi, and token issuances in the world. Ether is currently the second most popular cryptocurrency according to CoinMarketCap.com.\n\nWhat is Cardano (ADA)?\n\nCardano is a third-generation public blockchain and Dapp development infrastructure. The network was built to rectify some of the limitations and shortcomings of Ethereum. Uniquely, Cardano integrated a number of scientific methodologies to ensure the blockchain was secure and efficient. As such, the network has strong ties to the academic sector. Currently, Cardano's utility token, ADA, is one of the top cryptocurrencies in the world.\n\nScalability\n\nIn terms of scalability, Ethereum lags behind Cardano. Ethereum's blockchain can handle around 15 transactions per second (tps) in its current state. However, the network is in the middle of a major upgrade that would significantly improve these capabilities. The Ethereum 2.0 update would provide users with 100,000 transactions per second according to company documentation.\n\nIn comparison, Cardano can support around 257 tps. While this is much faster than Ethereum, it still lags behind major payment processors like VISA that support +30,000 tps. Recently, the development team behind Cardano released a paper describing the network's next scaling solution. Hydra is a Layer 2 scaling solution that would enable Cardona to process over one million tps.\n\nConsensus\n\nEthereum relies on an early Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus protocol to validate the state of the network. The protocol integrates the Ethash algorithm. At the time of launch, this was a huge deal because it provided more scalability than Bitcoin and reduced the use of ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) mining rigs.\n\nIn the coming months, Ethereum will complete its migration from a PoW network over to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) project. The migration will improve Ethereum's scalability and reduce its carbon footprint. Additionally, it will enable users to stake their ETH and earn rewards.\n\nOuroboros\n\nCardano introduces a new consensus mechanism known as Ouroboros. Ouroboros is a chain-based PoS protocol that provides lightning-fast transactions. To accomplish this task, the system relies on randomly chosen leaders to approve blocks. The network will select these nodes at the start of each epoch.\n\nEpochs function as a snapshot of the blockchain from a previous date. Using Epochs eliminates the need for nodes to search the entire transaction chain when approving the state of the network. The key to this strategy is to ensure that the epoch originates from a block sufficiently deep in the chain of transactions.\n\nMining\n\nAs a PoW network, Ethereum is reliant on miners to validate blocks of transactions and add them to the blockchain. Ethereum miners receive a reward of 2 ETH for their participation in validating blocks of transactions. These rewards are set to half over time like Bitcoin. Additionally, the mining difficulty of the network increases in conjunction with the network's congestion.\n\nAs a PoS, Cardano doesn\u2019t rely on miners to secure the network. PoS networks enable regular users to validate the state of the blockchain by staking their tokens in network wallets. In this way, PoS networks provide a more democratic system to decentralized networks.\n\nProgrammability\n\nEthereum remains the top Dapp development platform for many reasons. One of these reasons is its flexibility in terms of programmability. Ethereum can support smart contracts written in multiple languages. By allowing developers to leverage multiple coding languages, the network enables more participation from the development community. Interestingly, you can program Ethereum smart contracts using C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and more.\n\nCardano improves on Ethereum's development process with the creation of a full-stack programming environment based on Haskell, the leading functional programming language in the market. Developers can code directly in the Plutus Playground interface. This feature is a lightweight, web-based environment for exploratory ADA smart contract development. Notably, both off-chain and on-chain code for Cardano is written in Haskell.\n\nICOs\n\nEthereum entered the market in a different era. In 2013, the concept of an ICO was still in its fledgling state. The firm secured $18 million from thousands of international participants. Ethereum went on to raise $150 million during its DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) ICO. At that time, this was the largest ICO to date.\n\nIn comparison, Cardano's ICO secured $62 million in 2017 during the height of the first crypto craze. The network received immediate attention due to the fact it was developed by Ethereum co-founders and academic professionals. Cardano entered the market officially on September 29, 2017.\n\nEther (ETH)\n\nEther is the main utility token of the Ethereum networks. The token serves multiple roles within the ecosystem. Notably, Ether's primary role is to compensate miners for performing EVM computations. The more complex the equation, the higher the fee. Additionally, Ether can serve as a cryptocurrency. The coin has a circulating supply of 115,951,040.94 ETH. As the coin is vital for Ethereum's functionality and smart contract capabilities, there is no issuance cap on ETH at this time.\n\nADA Token\n\nADA is Cardano's utility token. Interestingly, the ADA token gets its name from the 19th-century mathematician, Ada Lovelace. Lovelace was the world's first computer programmer. Unlike Ethereum, Cardano has capped the issuance of ADA at 45 coins. There are currently 31.95 billion ADA in circulation.\n\nFounders\n\nEthereum was founded by Vitalik Buterin. Buterin revolutionized the crypto sphere when he published the project's whitepaper in 2013. In the document, he explains how the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) would function and provide programmability to the sector. He believed his new crypto would be a game-changer because it enabled the programming and use of smart contracts.\n\nIn comparison, Cardona entered service after the crypto market was in full swing. Specifically, Cardano launched during one of its most memorable bull markets in September 2017. Interestingly, Cardano Founders, Jeremy Wood and Charles Hoskinson were both veterans of the Ethereum project. The two had left the network after disagreements emerged surrounding the overall direction of the project.\n\nAdditionally, the developers wanted to avoid some of the issues that Ethereum developers had started to experience due to congestion and the network's overall structure. To accomplish this task, the pair helped develop a number of innovations in language and VM design. These changes are what drive ADA's popularity within the development community today.\n\nDevelopment Teams\n\nEthereum's development is coordinated and implemented by a group of programmers. Specifically, the Ethereum development community includes the Ethereum Foundation, Hyperledger, Nethermind, OpenEthereum, and EthereumJS. Together, this team succeeded in creating the world's largest and most robust Dapp ecosystem of all time.\n\nCardano also relies on a group of developers to remain stable and introduce improvements to the network. Cardano leverages a decentralized team of developers that all work in tandem on projects. To ensure that all the new developments remain compatible, the groups have agreed to utilize set standards.\n\nNon-Profits\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the Ethereum protocol. The group helps to cultivate more interest and the expansion of the platform. Notably, the Ethereum Foundation doesn\u2019t provide financial assistance to projects directly.\n\nThe Cardano Foundation serves a very similar role within its respective ecosystem. The foundation is tasked with preserving and protecting the technology that powers the platform. As such, the group is responsible for vital tasks such as promoting standardization in the sector to further interoperability.\n\nWhat's a Better Investment?\n\nNow that you have a better understanding of the differences between Ethereum (ETH) vs Cardano (ADA), you are ready to start your crypto adventure. Both of these projects have thriving development communities and are regarded as premier projects in the market. Of course, Ethereum dominates the sector at this time. However, Cardano offers a combination of features and lower fees that have helped it to cut into Ethereum's market share as of late.\n\nMoving forward, both of these projects have potential upside. Ethereum is set to remain a dominant force moving forward, especially following the completion of its Ethereum 2.0 update. Also, Cardano is set to see rapid expansion as more Ethereum developers expand their horizons into other blockchains in an attempt to avoid high fees and congestion issues. As such, it makes sense to hold both of these projects in your portfolio moving forward.\n\nHow to Buy Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA)\n\nThese are two of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world.

        "title": "Polygon Vs. Ethereum - What's the Difference? - Securities.io",
        "content": "Learning the differences when discussing Polygon (MATIC) vs Ethereum (ETH) is a great way to get a better grasp on the market. Interestingly, these protocols aren\u2019t necessarily competition, but options to consider within the same ecosystem. Here's some insight into what makes Polygon and Ethereum both projects to watch in 2022.\n\nWhat is Polygon?\n\nPolygon operates as a layer 2 scaling solution built to provide Ethereum developers with more functionality and lower fees. The developers behind the platform envision the protocol as an internet of blockchains. Part of this strategy is to streamline the creation of new blockchains. Polygon provides multiple options for developers ranging from independent chains to subchains that leverage Ethereum\u2019s security.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is one of the most successful cryptocurrencies of all time. Ethereum is the blockchain that hosts the cryptocurrency Ether (ETH). These items are often confused as the same thing. However, Ether is used to pay nodes for smart contract executions on the blockchain. It can also be used to send value internationally in a frictionless manner.\n\nEthereum was the first second-generation blockchain to hit the market. It changed the game and made smart contract programmability a standard feature on most new blockchains. Today, Ethereum operates as the largest DeFi (decentralized finance) and Dapp ecosystem globally. The protocol supports multiple coding languages, making it easy for developers to enter the market. The network supports the use of C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and more.\n\nWhat Problems was Polygon Built to Alleviate?\n\nPolygon was built in the hindsight of Ethereum. It was designed to help reduce some of the common pain points experienced by Ethereum developers. The protocol specifically tackles developer restrictions and high gas fees brought on by congestion. Polygon offers zero-gas transactions which is a huge plus for developers and users alike.\n\nDeveloper Restrictions\n\nEthereum developers have run into many limitations due to the network's configuration. Ethereum was an early contender in the market which means that it lacks many of today\u2019s most advanced features. Polygon introduces a highly-customizable infrastructure combined with a scalable consensus algorithm to improve interoperability.\n\nLack of Security\n\nDapp developers have suffered from security concerns from day one. Polygon is an open-source network that enables users to create on top of its network. The protocol provides developers access to modular security features to improve their operations. It makes it easy for corporations to upgrade their security using blockchain options.\n\nWhat Problems was Ethereum Built to Alleviate?\n\nLike Polygon, Ethereum was created to improve on its predecessor. In Ethereum's case, this predecessor is Bitcoin. Ethereum added functionality to the blockchain ecosystem and improved Bitcoin\u2019s sustainability and scalability. Bitcoin is capable of around 7 transactions per second. In comparison, Ethereum can handle 15-30 in its current state.\n\nDapp Support\n\nEthereum\u2019s developer Vitalik Buterin wanted to simplify the creation and management of decentralized applications. Dapps are special programs that are designed to operate on decentralized networks. As such, they leverage network nodes to handle the computations and validation of the network. Ethereum is home to thousands of Dapps currently.\n\nHow Does Polygon Work?\n\nPolygon's Architecture is made up of multiple components. There are four layers that operate in tandem to complete the operations of the network. The first layer is the Ethereum layer. This component handles the implementation of EVM instances. This layer is responsible for staking, DeFi, and inter-blockchain communication.\n\nThe security layer is another component that developers can leverage to improve their creations. The security protocols allow users to select the ones that fit their specific network needs. These validation services can be set up to handle management and other vital functionalities.\n\nStand-alone chains are a critical part of the Polygon ecosystem. These networks are designed to service enterprise-grade clientele and businesses. These systems are scalable and secure. As such, they are perfect for startups seeking to leverage blockchain tech.\n\nCommunity Governance\n\nOne of the coolest components of Polygon is its community governance system. MATIC token holders can stake their tokens to gain voting rights in the network's community governance system. Notably, subchains and blockchains built on Polygon can choose to use the community governance option or create their own alternative.\n\nHow Does Ethereum (ETH) Work?\n\nEthereum is a second-generation Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain. This designation means that it relies on community members called miners to remain valid. Miners accept gas payments to execute instances of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). They also secure returns for approving transactions.\n\nEthereum miners don\u2019t use the same SHA-256 algorithm as Bitcoin. Instead, the Etash algorithm is used which requires less energy to keep the network secure. It also helped Ethereum to stave off mining centralization in its early days. However, today, there are high-powered ASIC miners built specifically for the network.\n\nEthereum 2.0 Upgrade\n\nEthereum is in the midst of its largest upgrade to date. The network will convert from a PoW network over to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network. This upgrade will reduce gas costs and provide the network with far more scalability. According to Ethereum reports, this upgrade will push Ethereum\u2019s tps to 1,000 tps.\n\nThe maneuver will also open the door for ETH stakers. Currently, there are ETH staking options already available for users interested in securing the upgraded network. To qualify for an Ethereum staking node, you need to hold 32 ETH. Those who don\u2019t have that many tokens can always join a mining pool to share in the rewards.\n\nHow to Buy Polygon (MATIC) and Ethereum (ETH)\n\nCurrently, both Polygon (MATIC) and Ethereum (ETH) are available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nUphold Disclaimer: Terms Apply. Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong..\n\nKraken \u2013 Founded in 2011, Kraken is one of the most trusted names in the industry with over 9,000,000 users, and over $207 billion in quarterly trading volume.\n\nThe Kraken exchange offers trading access to over 190 countries including Australia, Canada, Europe, and is a top exchange for USA residents. (Excluding New York & Washington state).\n\nDriving Adoption for ETH Users\n\nBoth Ethereum and Polygon are popular projects that can help to improve your portfolio. Ethereum is the reigning champion in the DeFi market but it has seen some competition chip away at its crown due to congestion. Polygon helps to alleviate these issues for Ethereum users which makes the entire ecosystem stronger. As such, there is room for both networks to prosper.\n\nTo learn more, visit our Investing in Polygon and Investing in Ethereum guides."

        "title": "Investing In Ethereum Name Service (ENS) - Everything You Need to Know - Securities.io",
        "content": "The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) provides users with the unique opportunity to create a .eth domain name. The protocol leverages NFT (non-fungible token) technology to create secure credentials on the Ethereum blockchain. The goal of the project is to simplify cryptocurrency payments and drive adoption.\n\nWhat Problem Does Ethereum Name Service Solve?\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service (ENS) seeks to alleviate many of the shortcomings of the Internet's Domain Name Service (DNS). For one, the Ethereum name service provides a more efficient and responsive alternative to centralized web options. The use of blockchain technology improves security as well. All transactions are visible via a blockchain explorer.\n\nLack of Privacy\n\nAnother major concern that Ethereum Name Service users avoid is the current lack of privacy in the blockchain sector. As of late, a flood of tracking services and forensic firms has reduced user privacy to its lowest levels since the crypto market began 11-years ago. The Ethereum Name Service helps to restore some of this lost privacy through the use of its proprietary technologies.\n\nCensorship\n\nEthereum Name Service users also eliminate censorship concerns. The centralized web has become increasingly politicized. As such, there has been a strong push to censor more and more data. This unchecked censorship is billed as a form of consumer protection or as a way to reduce misinformation. The reality is that anyone who speaks out against the tech companies\u2019 narratives can find their accounts on the wrong side of this censorship.\n\nBenefits of Ethereum Name Service\n\nThere's a multitude of benefits that Ethereum Name Service users enjoy. For one, the protocol offers users the ability to launch and host decentralized domain names. These names can be anything that you prefer just like a regular website. This domain is then linked to your crypto wallet address or other information stored on a Web3 infrastructure.\n\nEasier Payments\n\nSince your new domain provides a human-readable crypto address, it makes sending payments a lot easier. For example, you could set up a .eth domain such as Payme.eth. Whenever you request a payment all you need to do is send this address over to the payee. They can place it into their web browser and it will forward their payments directly to your crypto wallet. It\u2019s simple and much faster than attempting to enter a traditional long crypto wallet address.\n\nReduced Errors\n\nAlong the same line of thought, the Ethereum Name Service reduces human error. Anyone who has sent cryptocurrency to the wrong address can attest to the uneasy feeling you get in your gut. For one, there are no refunds on public blockchains. As such, once you send your payment, those funds are gone forever, unless the other party feels kind enough to send your funds back. However, it should be noted that this rarely occurs.\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service helps to prevent human errors and streamlines the entire crypto payment process. You can set up your domain to be your name or company to further improve the recognizability of your wallet. This approach helps to drive new crypto adoption because new users are more likely to feel comfortable making a payment in this way versus using the ETH address feature.\n\nPromotions\n\nThe Ethereum Naming Service has a variety of exciting promotions going on at the moment. The network recently began its airdrop campaign. This portal sends users the network's governance token, ENS, directly to their wallet. Airdrops are one of the most popular ways for developers to provide rewards in an efficient way.\n\nOpen\n\nENS Users enjoy an open and permissionless payment experience when they join the platform. The team behind the project continues to promote and support further third-party development. Developers can find helpful resources, support, and guidance from the community.\n\nHow Does Ethereum Name Service Work\n\nThe Ethereum Naming Service (ENS) leverages the security and programmability of the Ethereum mainnet to bring users a better alternative to the status quo. The network empowers users to buy secure, private, censorship-resistant domains that leverage the full smart contract programmability of the system. Specifically, users can create and issue non-fungible tokens (NFT) that can represent Ethereum addresses as well as web domains.\n\nENS App\n\nThe main way for users to interact with the network is via the ENS App. This Dapp is available as a free download for Smartphone users. Users can pay for an ENS name using the dashboard in seconds. If the name you prefer is already taken, you can buy it on secondary markets like OpenSea. This strategy creates a new .eth domain market for users to profit using.\n\nEthereum Name Service (ENS) Controller\n\nThe ENS Controller is the only person who has the authority to edit an ENS account. The ENS controller can be found in the ENS registry's owner field. As the controller, you gain the ability to transfer ownership, set a resolver or TTL, and reassign subdomains.\n\nENS Token\n\nENS is the main governance token for the system. Users who hold ENS tokens gain voting rights via the network's DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). Additionally, you can use ENS tokens to pay fees and send value. Notably, ENS holders also receive airdrop rewards.\n\nCommunity Governance\n\nOne of the best aspects of the Ethereum Naming Service is its DAO. These systems replace personnel with smart contracts that users interact with to guide the development of a platform. The more ENS tokens a holder holds and the more weight their vote will carry. Community governance systems are very popular in the DeFi realm because they provide a unified way for projects to move forward.\n\nHow to Buy Ethereum Naming Service (ENS)\n\nEthereum Name Service (ENS) is available on the following exchanges:\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nKraken \u2013 Founded in 2011, Kraken is one of the most trusted names in the industry with over 9,000,000 users, and over $207 billion in quarterly trading volume.\n\nThe Kraken exchange offers trading access to over 190 countries including Australia, Canada, Europe, and is a top exchange for USA residents. (Excluding New York & Washington state).\n\nUphold Disclaimer: Terms Apply. Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong..\n\nWazirX \u2013 This exchange is part of the Binance Group, which ensures a high standard of quality. It is the best exchange for residents of India.\n\nThe Ethereum Naming Service (ENS) \u2013 A Better Way to Crypto\n\nProjects like ENS demonstrate innovative ways that developers seek to make cryptocurrency accessible to everyone. The removal of long Ethereum addresses reduces the technical boundaries for these users. As such, more people feel comfortable making crypt payments. In the end, these developers understand that usability is what determines the success of a cryptocurrency. As such, The Ethereum Naming Service (ENS) plays a vital role in the market at this time."

        "title": "Ethereum Vs. Ethereum Classic (2024 Edition) - Securities.io",
        "content": "Understanding the differences between Ethereum and Ethereum classic is a vital step in furthering your crypto investment strategy. Anyone delving deep into the crypto market will soon notice that there are two versions of Ethereum available. What is lesser-known to new traders nowadays is exactly why, and how, the market ended up in this scenario, and what are the main differences between these projects.\n\nThe Birth of Ethereum Classic\n\nThe splitting of Ethereum (ETH) into two different coins was a major controversy that rocked the market in 2016. Unlike some other well-known hard fork debates, The Ethereum vs Ethereum Classic (ETC) saga didn\u2019t revolve around correcting scalability issues or adding new features to the platform. Instead, it was done to prevent the loss of millions of ETH to hackers.\n\nHow the Ethereum vs Ethereum Classic Saga Begins\n\nEthereum Classic entered the market in 2013. At that time it was simply known as Ether. The protocols founder and creator Vitalik Buterin introduced the world to his smart contract programmable blockchain via a whitepaper. This document explained how just such a network could benefit the market considerably and simplify Dapp development in multiple ways.\n\nOn paper, the technical design and capabilities of the Ethereum concept were immediately evident. The project caught the attention of other well-known investors and developers. By 2014, the project's development was well underway. The creation of the project was sped up thanks to a successful ICO and support from the Swiss development firm, GmbH.\n\nThe ETH ICO\n\nThe ETH ICO was a success and the group secured $18 million to further the development of Ethereum's ecosystem. These funds helped to create and expand the first network of ETH miners and shareholders. The funds also helped the firm launch its mainnet in under a year. The first version of Ethereum was known as Frontier.\n\nIn 2016, Ethereum again broke the mold when it proposed the integration of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). DAOs are powerful community governance mechanisms. Their goal is to convert all aspects of a corporation\u2019s management into smart contracts.\n\nBy codifying the rules and decision-making processes of an organization, developers can remove the need for any human intervention. Consequently, DAOs operate as community-led efforts that automate decisions and facilitate cryptocurrency transactions across the network.\n\nEthereum DAO\n\nEthereum's DAO launched on April 30, 2016. The launch was a huge success with the ICO breaking all previous records to become the largest ICO in history at that time. Specifically, the DAO raised +$150M in funds from +11,000 international investors. Everything looked as if the DAO was a significant success for the ETH community. However, the celebration was short-lived.\n\nDOA Hack\n\nWhile Ethereum's developers were celebrating their record-breaking achievement, others in the community were plotting on their funds. Sadly, the team hadn't expected such a robust response to their event. The flood of funding caught the team slightly off guard.\n\nAs a result, they mismanaged the level of security required. Specifically, they had chosen to keep all the ICO funding in a single hot wallet. At the time, the DAO wallet held 15% of the total circulating supply of ETH. This bounty was just too much for hackers to let go untouched.\n\nDAO Hack Details\n\nSoon, hackers were probing the network for attack vectors to exploit. Within days, both hackers and developers identified a potential programming error. Sadly, while the developers were already working on the patch, a hacker struck with great efficiency.\n\nThe shady individual utilized a duplicated DOA system to trick the protocol and slowly drain the funds. The near replica of the DAO included the main protocols initially programmed into the original DAO, making it impossible for the system to detect. However, it also included a withdrawal stipulation that placed a 28-day lock on funds. This revelation provided Ethereum's development team with some time to counterattack.\n\nThe situation was dire as the hacker had successfully tricked the DAO into depositing 3.6 million ETH from the ICO into their wallet address in just days. News of the attack dropped the value of ETH from $20 to just under $13 and sent ripples throughout the market. It also put the spotlight on Ethereum and how they intended to stop the siphoning of these funds.\n\nDAO Hack Response\n\nEthereum's development team worked tirelessly to think of some way to save the approximately $40M in ETH that the hacker had stolen. They knew where the funds were and that the hacker couldn\u2019t access these funds for 28 days. From there, they began to think of ways to prevent the thief from accomplishing his mission.\n\nThe first concept involved doing a soft fork upgrade to ETH. This upgrade would provide developers with the ability to blacklist certain wallets on demand. In essence, this would prevent the hacker from withdrawing these funds forever. The coins founder, Vitalik Buterin, took to social media to get a community response to the concept.\n\nHacker Responds\n\nThe same day, the hacker took to social media and responded to Buterin's suggestion. He told the crypto community that he had done nothing wrong. He said that if one was to have faith in the DAO, one needed to allow smart contracts to validate transactions.\n\nHe went on to explain that the DAO was programmed loosely and that's why the losses occurred. He further lamented the idea of altering any coding on Ethereum's blockchain because it was an error in the DAO and not ETH that caused the issue.\n\nHacker Raises Some Good Points\n\nDespite his shady origins, the hacker did land a couple of solid points during his posts. The entire concept of a DAO was to eliminate the need for human intervention. If developers can just alter the core features of Ethereum as they see fit, is it really an immutable decentralized blockchain?\n\nAs time passed, Buterin and his team began to get desperate to prevent the loss of $40M in ETH. Even worse was the fact that the community lacked the time to vote on the matter. This stress led to a growing call to conduct a Hard Fork. A hard fork differs from a soft fork in that it\u2019s a major protocol upgrade that requires miners to change their blockchain.\n\nRollBack\n\nEthereum's developers now had a new plan. they intended to roll back the blockchain right before the hack. This would prevent losses. However, the strategy was met with fierce opposition for many reasons. Primarily, users and developers felt that it would completely go against the core beliefs of the decentralized economy as blockchains are to be unalterable in nature.\n\nHacker Offers Miners Not to Upgrade\n\nOnce the news of the potential hard fork broke, the ETH community was split. This decision was further exasperated by the fact that the hacker began to offer huge rewards to miners who would switch to the new blockchain. In one instance, he offered 1 million ETH and 100 BTC to each node that refused the update.\n\nEthereum Classic is Here\n\nAs part of the hard fork, a new cryptocurrency would be formed. The new crypto would adopt the ETH name and the original coin would go by Ethereum Classic moving forward. Notably, the new version of the Ethereum mainnet entered the market on July 20, 2016. The upgrade rolled back the DAO theft via an irregular state change.\n\nTech Differences\n\nEthereum Classic maintains the original, unchanged Ethereum blockchain in its original state. Technically speaking, the coin has remained relatively the same since that date. In comparison, the new version of ETH has had the full support of the core development team. As such, it has had some major upgrades occur.\n\nETC Adds Scarcity\n\nNotably, one of the main differences between ETC and ETH is the total coin supply. ETC is hard-capped at 210M coins, whereas, ETH has no limit on its total supply. Specifically, On 11 December 2017, Ethereum Classic was hard capped via the Gotham hard fork upgrade. This upgrade added a Bitcoin-inspired deflationary emission schedule to the network. It\u2019s this difference in scarcity that has helped ETC remain a popular project over the years.\n\nFuture Upgrades\n\nIn the coming months, ETH plans to complete a major technical upgrade. ETH is in the middle of changing its consensus mechanism from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) system over to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS). This upgrade will further drive a wedge between the capabilities and communities of these coins as ETC classic will remain a PoW blockchain.\n\nLong Term Effects\n\nThe decision to hard fork Ethereum was controversial for multiple reasons. For one, it demonstrated that decentralized networks are only as censorship-resistant as their developers allow. It also led to ETH-based platforms being shunned within the security token space as major financial institutions can't risk having settled securities transactions reversed.\n\nHow to Buy Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC)\n\nThese are two of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world. The exchanges below enable the purchase of both of these digital assets.\n\nKraken \u2013 Founded in 2011, Kraken is one of the most trusted names in the industry with over 9,000,000 users, and over $207 billion in quarterly trading volume.\n\nThe Kraken exchange offers trading access to over 190 countries including Australia, Canada, and Europe, and is our most recommended exchange for USA residents. (Excluding New York & Washington state).\n\nKuCoin \u2013 This exchange currently offers cryptocurrency trading of over 300 other popular tokens. It is often the first to offer buying opportunities for new tokens. USA Residents are Prohibited.\n\nEthereum Classic \u2013 A Controversial Coin that Remains Active\n\nThe fact that Ethereum Classic is still a popular project in the market says a lot about investors' feelings on the hard fork. When the hard fork first occurred, Ethereum's prices plummeted. However, the platform has since rebounded and even achieved new all-time highs brought on by the expansion of the DeFi, NFT, and ICO sectors. Today, you can get your ETH exactly how you like it, classic or with extra DeFi."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Burn Rate Plummets Dramatically, No Longer Deflationary? - U.Today",
        "content": "Ethereum's celebrated burn mechanism has recently shown signs of cooling down, prompting some to question if the world's second largest blockchain by market cap is not currently deflationary. Recent data raises eyebrows, illustrating a sharp decline in the Ethereum burn rate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Aug. 12, the single-day burn rate for Ethereum dropped to merely 570.54 ETH. This low figure is not far from the previous bottom recorded on Oct. 2, 2022, when only 498.16 ETH were burned. Such figures can be troubling for investors and Ethereum enthusiasts who look at the burning mechanism as a way to counteract the inflationary tendencies of cryptocurrency, ultimately enhancing ETH's scarcity and value.\n\nA closer look at the data and underlying activity reveals a significant shift from Ethereum's Layer 1 (L1) to Layer 2 (L2) solutions. L2 solutions, like Arbitrum and Base, aim to scale Ethereum by handling transactions off the main chain and then settling them in a condensed form. This migration from L1 to L2 reduces the load on Ethereum's mainnet and, consequently, the number of transactions that contribute to the burn rate.\n\nMoreover, the current decline in activity on Ethereum's mainnet is not solely due to technical shifts. An equally crucial factor is the waning interest of institutional investors in the Ethereum space. Institutions, with their significant purchasing power, play a pivotal role in driving transaction volume and, by extension, the burn rate of Ethereum. Without consistent institutional participation, especially in large-scale transactions, Ethereum's mainnet activity may remain subdued, impacting the burn rate.\n\nAs for institutional investors, the flow of interest from them into the crypto space is not uncommon and can be influenced by a myriad of factors, ranging from global economic conditions to regulatory shifts."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Can ETH Reach $10,000 in 2023? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "You might be aware that any discussion around cryptocurrencies always revolves around the two largest cryptos by market capitalization, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). It is obvious that Bitcoin is a favorite amongst those looking for a peer-to-peer (P2P) electronic payment system and is preferred as a digital store of value, overshadowing Ethereum, but ETH still has a lot to offer.\n\nEthereum advocates usually look at it as more than just a crypto and believe that it has a wide variety of use cases, huge intrinsic value and provides unique earning opportunities to its investors.\n\nAs such, the large altcoin remains bullish in the long term. It is up more than 746% over the last three years and 58% above the January 1 opening. At the time of writing, Ether\u2019s market cap stands at $227.12 billion, reinforcing its 2nd position on the CoinMarketCap ranking with a market dominance of 19%, against Bitcoin\u2019s 49.8%.\n\nOn the other hand, the long-awaited September 15, 2022 Merge event that saw Ethereum transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) crypto to a proof-of-stake (PoS) token turned out to be a non-event as the price did not rally as many expected. Similarly, the Shanghai and Capella upgrade that was successfully completed on April 12, saw Ether\u2019s rise for a few days before turning down again.\n\nCrypto investors, however, still remain hopeful that 2023 will be a bull market for the industry with Ethereum recording a sustained recovery to hit the $10,000 mark before the end of the year. Is this possible? Well, let\u2019s dig in to find out.\n\nEthereum: A Brief Overview\n\nEthereum is the world\u2019s largest altcoin and second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. It was created in 2015 by a number of developers including Vitalik Buterin who initially published a whitepaper explaining the concept of Ethereum in November 2013.\n\nFollowing Buterin\u2019s initial work, other developers jumped on the bandwagon in different capacities to help bring the project to fruition. Vitalik Buterin, Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Amir Chetrit, Anthony Di Iorio, Jeffrey Wilcke, Joseph Lubin and Mihai Alisie are all considered co-founders of the largest Layer 1 blockchain network.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain has since undergone a lengthy development process spanning a number of years to bring it to what is it is today \u2013 a decentralized, open-source, and public service blockchain network that uses smart contracts for decentralized application (dApps) development and cryptocurrency trading without the involvement of a middle men.\n\nMore than just a digital token, Ethereum is more like a network, maintained and updated by validators who earn Ether in exchange for their work and contribution.\n\nThe native currency of the network, Ether (ETH), serves as the blockchain\u2019s cryptocurrency for powering the dApps built on the platform. The blockchain, therefore, provides powerful tools for developers to create and deploy their own interoperable, decentralized assets and services.\n\nA core concept behind Ethereum and its various applications is that there are no central authorities to enforce the network. This means the network users themselves control decisions made for the group.\n\nEthereum has played a major role in expanding the Web3.0 industry, offering blockchain projects, enhanced efficiency, faster transactions, and dApps to industries across the world. As such, it has a number of use cases including in areas of decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and Decentralized apps (dApps).\n\nIn a nutshell, Ethereum is offering utility and creating value in numerous sectors including entertainment, real estate, healthcare, logistics and finance.\n\nTo understand where Ethereum will go next and to gain a better understanding of Ethereum\u2019s forecast, one needs to understand its price history.\n\nEthereum Price History\n\nTo understand Ethereum\u2019s journey, it is important to look at the network\u2019s development timeline and how that has affected its price.\n\nDuring the presale, an initial coin offering (ICO) that took place in 2014 to finance the development of the Ethereum blockchain, Ether\u2019s price was $0.31. In 2015, the year that Ethereum first launched, the price started at around $0.74 and the lowest closing price for ETH was $0.42 while the highest price was $1.24.\n\nEthereum Development Journey\n\nIn 2016 with ETH at $12.24, the DAO attack in which 3.6 million ETH worth $60 million was lost (equivalent to one-third of the funds contributed by would-be DAO participants) led to a controversial revision of the Ethereum blockchain in what was referred to as an \u201c\u201cirregular state change\u201d\u201dresulting in the Ethereum Classic (ETC) hard fork. This was a factor in the ICO boom that started in 2017.\n\nThe 2017 bull market saw Ether\u2019s price rise more than 750% from $8.1 on January 1 recording a series of higher highs to reach a record high of $727 in December that year. This bull run was marked by the Byzantium hard fork in late 2017 reducing the rewards from 5 ETH to 3 ETH.\n\nThe reduction in ETH rewards was in the effort to reduce the inflation of Ether in basic supply and demand economics. The supply and demand forced after that propelled the Ethereum price to another record high of $1,151 in January 2018.\n\nThe price then turned down, dropping as much as 88% to lows of $135 in December that year, marking the 2018 bear market, known as the \u2018Crypto Winter,\u2019 which remains infamous in the industry\u2019s history. This crypto crash was driven by regulatory changes and security incidents, particularly in South Korea and China.\n\nThe downturn which was sustained throughout the year demonstrated the risk associated with market speculation and the effect of regulatory developments on market stability.\n\nETH/USD All-time Chart\n\nThe bear market persisted throughout 2019 with the price rising 110% during the first half of the year from $173 in January to reach a high of $350 in June, before falling back to $128 by the close of the year.\n\nOn the development front, 2019 was marked by two major upgrades, the Constantinople and the Istanbul hard forks. The Constantinople upgrade reduced block reward issuance from 3 to 2 ETH. The Istanbul hard fork which took place in December 2019 included six Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), specific code changes to the ethereum protocol that lowered the gas costs. This increased the bandwidth on the blockchain and fostered zero-knowledge privacy technologies such as zk-SNARKs.\n\nIn 2020, the market began to recover slowly at first and then with rapid momentum in 2020. Powered by the growth of DeFi, institutional interest, and increased retail participation, the crypto market saw a significant bull run. The London hard form which occurred in August 2021 at a time when Ether was going for $2,533, was aimed at making preparations for the transition to Ethereum 2.0 and a shift to the PoS consensus mechanism..\n\nBy the end of 2021, Ethereum had hit new all-time highs close to $5,000, marking a 558% increase during that year.\n\nWhat followed was the 2022 bear market, whose effects are still being felt at the moment. The bear market was characterized by sharp pullbacks, with Ether;s price falling 81.66% from it\u2019s all-time high to a low of $880 in June 2022.\n\nThis bear market was influenced by several factors including environmental and financial stability concerns, while prominent figures such as Elon Musk, put a strain on the market. Simultaneously, the collapse of the Terra ecosystem and the depegging of its stablecoin, Tether (USDT), contributed further to the market\u2019s downturn.\n\nThe Ethereum Beacon Chain upgrade, christened the Merge, which saw the blockchain translation from a PoW to a PoS protocol turned out to be a non-event as investors turned it into a sell-the news occasion. The downturn was accelerated by the collapse of one of the largest crypto exchanges, FTX in November 2022. This frustrated all the efforts the bulls had put in in the run up to The Merge, as Ethereum closed the year at $1,194.\n\n2023 has been fairly bullish for the largest altcoin by market capitalization. The price action has painted six green candlesticks as seen on the all-time chart above, reaching the year\u2019s high at $2,140 on April 14. The year-to-date lows lie at $1,27, reached after traders reacted to the US SEC suedBinance and Coinbase in early June.\n\nThe crypto is 64% above its January opening and has been recording higher lows since the beginning of the year.\n\nThis has left many analysts optimistic that Ethereum will continue the bullish momentum, eventually reaching $10,000 before the year ends.\n\nWhy Ethereum is going to $10,000 very soon\u2026 RT \ud83c\udfb6 pic.twitter.com/P38niJDzVW \u2014 Ivan on Tech \u2013 Moralis Money for altcoin discovery (@IvanOnTech) June 5, 2023\n\nAt the time of writing, Ether is hovering at $1,890.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nAfter turning away from its all-time high around $5,000, Ether declined a whooping 83% to set a swing low at $883 in June 2022. Since then, the price action has recorded a series of higher lows and relatively equal highs around the $2,000 level. This had led to the appearance of an ascending triangle on the weekly chart as shown on the chart below.\n\nBulls are trying to push the price above the triangle\u2019s horizontal line (x-axis) at $2,000. Such a move would confirm a bullish breakout for ETH price with the first barrier emerging from the 100-weekly Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $2,290.\n\nOther levels to watch on the upside include the $2,500 psychological level which the bulls have to flip into support before reaching the technical target of the governing chart pattern at $2,893. This would represent a 54% ascent from the current price.\n\nETH/USD Weekly Chart\n\nThis positive outlook was supported by the position of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) above the midline in the positive region. The price strength at 54 suggests that the bulls are currently controlling the price.\n\nIn addition, ETH currently trades above key support levels including the $1,600 support level, where both the 50 and the 200 SMAs appear to merge. Other areas of support include the $1,500 psychological level and the major support level at $1,200.\n\nAny attempts to pull the price below these levels would be met by immense buying from this cohort of investors who may wish to increase their profits.\n\nConversely, things go awry for the bulls if Ethereum turns down from the current price, breaching the 50 and 200 SMAs at $1,600, dropping below the triangle. Ether\u2019s price may continue trading between this level and the $1,500 for a few weeks, but a breach of the latter would be detrimental for ETH. If this happens, a drop below $1,200 to revisit 2022 lows around the $880 demand zone would be inevitable.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction \u2013 Will ETH Hit $10,000 In 2023?\n\nEthereum holds a promising future because it is more than just a transactional crypto. The altcoin had slowly been establishing itself as a \u201cstore of value\u201d for those entities which are looking to optimize their wealth, positioning itself as the most favorite alternative to Bitcoin\n\nEthereum\u2019s functionality goes very well with NFTs, DApps, DeFi, smart contracts and the list keeps growing each year.\n\nWe have already established that ETH\u2019s price growth largely depends on the milestones recorded on the blockchain\u2019s development. Therefore, as long as the Ethereum network keeps growing stronger and the development team continues to develop innovative features, ETH is likely to continue to grow in value, attracting more and more investors.\n\nNote that several factors have influenced Ethereum\u2019s past price rallies and in the current state, cryptocurrency sector dynamics differ from what was observed during the DeFitoken\u2019s previous skyrocketing periods.\n\nSeveral analysts have mulled over the possibility of Ethereum hitting the coveted $10,000 market before the end of the year. One of these is Patric @Finaconda, a DeFi, Crypto, and Metaverse who said in a May 18 tweet that \u201cETH could print a potential 5x increase to $10,000-$12,000 per coin in the next bull market.\u201d\n\n2/ With the finalization of Ethereum 2.0 on the horizon, investors can expect a faster, environmentally friendly, and efficient network. \ud83d\ude4c\n\nThis makes #Ethereum a promising long-term investment opportunity for the next crypto #BullMarket. \u2014 Patric @Finaconda (@finaconda) May 18, 2023\n\nHe, however, gave a number of conditions that must be met for this to happen, mentioning that \u201cthe finalization of Ethereum 2.0\u201d will make the network \u201cfaster, environmentally friendly, and efficient,\u201d attracting more investors to ETH.\n\nHe also mentioned that Ethereum would need support from the wider market as high Inflation rates, high interest rates, and low confidence in financial markets remain major challenges.\n\nTherefore, there has been continued restoration of investors\u2019 trust in the crypto market, which needs to be widespread to establish a conducive atmosphere for Ethereum\u2019s substantial and sustained growth.\n\nNote that for Ehereum to really touch $10,000, it has climbed close to 430% from the current price. This would mean an 32% increase month-on-month.\n\nBased on this figure, we carried out an analysis using the Binance price prediction calculator to get the short term price prediction for ETH. According to the analysis, the price prediction for July is $2,488, surpassing the 2023 high around $2,140.\n\nMonth Average ETH Price July 2023 2488.2 August 2023 3284.42 September 2023 4335.43 October 2023 5722.78 November 2023 7554.07 December 2023 9971.37\n\nFurther according to our analysis, the crypto is likely to cross the November 2021 high around $5,000 somewhere between September and October.\n\nThe ETH price prediction for December 2023 shows the average price of BTC at $9,971, given that it continues to rise by as much as 32% every month.\n\nHowever, to hit $10,000, Ethereum still has several price levels to clear, with $5,000 as a critical resistance position considering it is close to Ether\u2019s all-time high.\n\nNote that ETH has remained bullish in 2023 as the wider crypto market aims to exit the bear market from last year. In this case, the market rally is led by assets like Bitcoin. Historically, when Bitcoin records gains, it tends to pull the rest of the market along, with Ethereum in line to benefit.\n\nTherefore, there is no doubt that the Ether\u2019s price may touch $10,000, but it remains to be seen when that will be.\n\nEthereum Long-term Price Prediction \u2013 Is ETH at $100K Possible?\n\nAt the moment, there is not enough data to determine whether Ethereum can reach $100,00o and when.\n\nHowever, for Ethereum to rise to $100,00, it is not just the Use Cases but also the economic environment that must be friendly. Ethereum price has been highly influenced by the liquidity and wealth of individual and institutional investors.\n\nFor example, whenever the Fed tightens rates or reduces its balance sheet, Ethereum tends to lose value due to lower demand. But then economic cycles are a part and parcel of human history.\n\nEthereum at $100,000 will have a market cap of $12 Trillion, given the current amount of Ether in circulation. This is possible, in theory.\n\nFor example, if ETH were to rise at 10% per annum, it would take ETH 44 years (2067) to reach the $10,000 level.Note that it took Bitcoin 4 years to rise from $1700 to $50,000. The $12 Trillion market cap for Ethereum may sound quite huge today but more than 40 years down the line, may not be that huge.\n\nAlso, given that Ethereum has become deflationary and also that it may rise faster than 15%, Ethereum is likely to reach $100K much faster than 2067. For example, if Ethereum rises by 30% year-on-year, it will reach the $100,000 level by the year 2038.\n\nYear Average ETH Price 2023 1885.00 2024 2450.50 2025 3185.65 2026 4141.35 2027 5383.75 2028 6998.87 2029 9098.53 2030 11828.10 2031 15376.52 2032 19989.48 2033 25986.33 2034 33782.22 2035 43916.89 2036 57091.96 2037 74219.54 2038 96485.41 2039 125431.03\n\nEthereum is unlikely to rise consistently given economic uncertainties. The above are just hypothetical scenarios.\n\nWhile growth is unlikely to follow these exact patterns, it is not unusual to see a new category grow this way, with high growth in the initial years before easing to lower levels over time.\n\nWill Ethereum ever Outperform Bitcoin?\n\nEthereum\u2019s price is unlikely to overtake Bitcoin ever but it has the potential to overtake BTC in terms of market cap since it has an uncapped supply.\n\nHowever, nothing is impossible in the world of cryptocurrencies. If we take the example of the 2021 bull market, ETH outperformed Bitcoin and gained nearly 400% compared to 66% for Bitcoin.\n\nIn addition, experts believe that due to its unique blockchain and several use cases, Ethereum has a stable future and might even perform better than Bitcoin in future but is unlikely to overtake the price of Bitcoin.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe analysis of Ethereum\u2019s past performance and development milestones since its inception in 2014 and launch in 2015 reveals that the token is here to stay. The network has unprecedented capabilities with solid fundamentals making it grow from time to time.\n\nIts continued growth and constant developmental upgrades makes many analysts and market experts predict that 2023 and the years ahead will be good for the largest smart contracts token. With rising confidence in the technology and blockchain solutions as well as new innovations around DeFi applications, Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and the Metaverse, ETH will surely continue to grow in value and those HODLing the crypto will not waver.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nGaming-centric Ethereum scaling network Immutable zkEVM has launched its testnet, crypto tech firm Immutable announced Monday, letting dozens of blockchain game studios start experimenting with the scaling solution ahead of the eventual mainnet rollout.\n\nIn simple terms, zkEVM networks can increase the number of processed transactions and provide additional privacy and security features compared to the main Ethereum network. The main Ethereum network doesn\u2019t finalize transactions as quickly or cheaply as a zkEVM network, which bundles or \u201crolls up\u201d multiple transactions into one without data being revealed.\n\nUnlike the firm\u2019s current Immutable X network, Immutable zkEVM is built on top of Polygon\u2019s zkEVM technology via a partnership with Polygon Labs. Here\u2019s a look at the biggest games that have announced plans to use the new Immutable zkEVM network.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMetalCore\n\nMetalCore is a sci-fi shooter game that\u2019s part first-person shooter (FPS) and part player-versus-environment (PVE) mech-fighting game, letting players go from being a ground troop to operating a massive robotic mech in seconds. The game is still in development, but will leverage the Immutable zkEVM network for its crypto transactions beginning with its closed beta kickoff event on September 15.\n\nShardbound\n\nImmutable Games and game studio Bazooka Tango are resurrecting the fantasy player-versus-player (PVP) card auto battler title Shardbound as an NFT game. Years ago, Sharbound\u2019s original indie developers at Spiritwalk Games encountered what Bazooka Tango\u2019s CEO Bo Daly previously told Decrypt was \u201ca little bit of a business problem.\u201d\n\nIn March 2023, Immutable and Bazooka Tango announced that Shardbound would be brought back to life as a blockchain game, adding NFTs to an experience in which gamers use cards to strategically place characters on a map with hexagonal tiles. The game is still in development.\n\nMedieval Empires\n\nMedieval Empires is a strategy game whose developers announced earlier this month that the project will use Immutable\u2019s zkEVM network, but have not specified exactly how just yet. The game plans to take a \u201cplay-and-own\u201d approach to NFTs, where players are able to own the in-game items they find as they play.\n\nThe game is currently playable on MacOS and Windows PCs, and the game studio has already released a token called MEE and virtual land Polygon NFTs, with no announcements yet made regarding a potential migration.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFormer President Donald Trump was recently revealed to be the owner of an Ethereum wallet that held about half a million dollars in value. Now, it turns out that he may own much more\u2014putting the high-profile crypto-skeptic in the \u2018whale\u2019 category.\n\nIn a fresh set of financial disclosure documents submitted to the Office of Government Ethics, Trump reports owning just over $2.8 million in cryptocurrency held in an Ethereum wallet. The updated figure was uncovered by the Washington-based ethics watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), and shared on Twitter on Tuesday.\n\nThe disclosures also showed that Trump earned close to $4.9 million in licensing fees from a collection of non-fungible tokens (NFT) that his campaign launched as part of his bid to return to the White House in 2024 after his previous defeat to current-President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSales of the tokens took off in the months following their release last December, including a brief surge after his first indictment by a state court in New York. However, their value sank soon after the candidate launched a second batch in April that crashed the first set\u2019s value.\n\nThe size of Trump\u2019s holdings put him in the category of crypto \u2018whales,\u2019 a term used to describe aholder of a massive amount of a given token. This is an ironic twist for a man who has described cryptocurrency as a \u201cscam\u201d and as a \u201cvery dangerous thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never loved it because I like to have the dollar,\u201d Trump told Fox Business in a December 2021 interview. \u201cI was never a big fan, but it\u2019s building up bigger and bigger and nobody\u2019s doing anything about it. I want our currency called the dollar.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s stances break with those of his fellow Republicans, who have pushed for new legislation in Congress that has been mostly welcomed by the cryptocurrency industry. It also clashes with the pro-crypto positions taken by his GOP rivals in the 2024 primary, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis."

According to an announcement yesterday, the initiative will enable Cardano to be connected to 11 major blockchain networks.\n\nThe supported networks include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Astar Network, Avalanche, BNB Chain, OKT Chain, Optimism, Polygon, Tron, and Wanchain.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNotably, the development comes over a year after Wanchain disclosed plans to deploy cross-chain bridges on Cardano.\n\nUsers Can Now Transfer Value Between Cardano & Other Blockchains\n\nWith the launch of Wanchain\u2019s Cardano Bridges, transferring value between Cardano and selected networks has become easier. Interestingly, users can quickly move and transfer Cardano-based assets to the supported blockchains and vice versa.\n\n\u201cWanchain\u2019s Cardano Bridges advance interoperability, enabling numerous assets including ADA, other native Cardano tokens, all ERC-20 tokens, and several other notable assets to move seamlessly between Cardano, any EVM-based network, and select non-EVM networks,\u201d Wanchain noted in a recent announcement.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIt is worth noting that the recently-launched bridge will only allow users to transfer a handful of assets. The supported assets for each blockchain include the following:\n\nBitcoin (BTC);\n\nEthereum (ADA, BTC, ETH, USDC, USDT);\n\nArbitrum (USDC, USDT);\n\nAstar (USDT);\n\nAvalanche (BTC, USDC, USDT);\n\nBNB Chain (BTC, USDC, USDT);\n\nOKT Network (USDT);\n\nOptimism (USDC, USDT);\n\nPolygon (USDC, USDT);\n\nTron (USDC, USDT);\n\nWanchain (ADA, BTC, ETH, USDC, USDT, WAN).\n\nInterestingly, the above-mentioned assets have been brought to the Cardano network via the Wanchain bridges.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time that fiat-backed stablecoins, in the form of USDT and USDC, are available on the Cardano mainnet,\u201d Wanchain said.\n\nRoles Played by Developers\n\nCommenting on the development, the Wanchain team said the Cardano Bridges project is a milestone initiative it has been working on for years. Wanchain developers implemented a series of technical features to enable interoperability between Cardano and other heterogeneous blockchain networks.\n\nIt added Haskell smart contracts to Cardano- a feature that supports cross-chain transactions. In addition, the Wanchain team also upgraded its bridge nodes, allowing UTXO-type transactions to interact with Cardano smart contracts.\n\nFurthermore, Wanchain enlisted Cardano\u2019s research and development company Input Output Global (IOG), to make the necessary changes to the network. Following the partnership, IOG added native support for a Schnorr signature and Secp256k1 curve on Cardano."

        "content": "Recent revelations by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin have thrown the crypto community into a debate about decentralizing Layer 2 projects like Arbitrum and Optimism. Buterin disclosed that all Layer 2 scaling solutions and rollups have a backdoor on the Ethereum blockchain, casting doubt on the presumed decentralization of these projects.\n\nAll Layer-2 Solutions Have Backdoors- Vitalik\n\nButerin explained that developers and project owners have access to multi-sig wallets, allowing them to make protocol changes. Although these backdoors can be seen as \u201ctraining wheels\u201d for the Ethereum blockchain, they have caused a division in ideology among crypto enthusiasts. Proponents argue for the necessity of the mechanism as a safeguard, while purists demand immutable and 100% decentralized protocols.\n\nLayer 2 protocols face potential regulation\n\nCrypto and DeFi analyst Chris Blec, a long-time critic of Layer 2 projects, supported Buterin\u2019s statement. Blec refers to such projects as \u201cbanking 2.0\u201d and argues that these protocols will likely be subject to regulation.\n\nInterestingly, even the largest stablecoins in the Ethereum ecosystem, USD Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) have central control that allows their teams to freeze assets in response to security threats.\n\nThey can call them temporary all they want but words don\u2019t actually matter. All that matters is that the backdoor is there. \u2014 Chris Blec (@ChrisBlec) August 14, 2023\n\nThe backdoor poses a risk of centralization, a principle that contradicts the essence of blockchain technology. On the other hand, removing the backdoor could introduce new vulnerabilities. As the crypto community grapples with this predicament, the Ethereum landscape faces tough decisions that could shape its future trajectory.\n\nWhile Layer 2 projects promise increased efficiency and lower transaction costs, their decentralization remains in question due to the backdoor access available to developers.\n\nConsequently, the debate continues over the trade-offs between security and centralization in the crypto world. Hence, the road ahead for Ethereum and its Layer 2 scaling solutions may be marked with increased scrutiny and potential regulatory implications."

        "content": "Ethereum although vulnerable to the selling pressure that continues to build up across the crypto market, holds strongly onto levels above $1,800.\n\nThe largest smart contracts token has not flinched in the last 24 hours, trading at $1,847 with $5.2 billion in trading volume coming in and backed by $222 billion in market capitalization.\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH Price Moves Closer to Bullish Pattern Breakout\n\nAn analysis of the Eth price daily chart reveals the formation of an inverse head and shoulders (H&S) pattern. If validated, investors can acclimatize to a bullish outcome, where Ether climbs to $2,424.\n\nThis is a bullish reversal pattern that signals a change in the direction of a downtrend. It consists of three consecutive lows, with the middle one being the lowest and the other two being roughly equal.\n\nTraders can capitalize on this pattern by buying when the price closes above the neckline and setting a stop-loss below the right shoulder. The target price is calculated by adding the height of the pattern to the breakout point, roughly 24% to $2,424.\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ethereum is dealing with low volatility, which according to data from IntoTheBlock, has dropped by 21.2% in a week. This coincided with a massive drop in network fees to $34.8 million, marking a two-month low.\n\nEthereum fees have dropped significantly this week by 21.2%, reaching a two-month low. This decline coincides with a period of stagnating volatility.#ETH pic.twitter.com/jgk23bbv1v \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) August 11, 2023\n\nLow volatility refers to how much Eth price moves up and down in a specified period. Extended periods of low volatility, according to IntoTheBlock, often point to potential volatile fluctuations in the short term.\n\nFrom the technical outlook, Ethereum is calm but a bullish breakout is in the offing, especially if the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator flashes a buy signal.\n\nTraders seeking exposure to new long positions in Ethereum would be required to hold on until the MACD line in blue crosses above the signal line in red.\n\nSuch a signal implores investors to fill their bags, booking their positions ahead of an impending ETH price rally.\n\nThat said, ETH needs to close the day above the immediate resistance highlighted by the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (red) at $1,858 to reinforce the uptrend eyeing the inverse head and shoulders breakout.\n\nIn the event Ethereum abandons the push for gains above $1,960 (neckline), overhead pressure will likely surge, pushing prices lower below support at $1,800. If declines sustain below this support area, it would be difficult to rule out further losses likely to retest the 200-day EMA (purple) at $1,790, June\u2019s low at $1,620, and the lows in May at 1,405.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "London-based asset manager Jacobi listed Europe\u2019s first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund on Euronext Amsterdam.\n\nJacobi initially received approval for this ETF in 2021 but delayed its listing due to crypto crashes in 2022 like the Terra collapse and the Three Arrows crisis.\n\nThe Jacobi FT Wilshere Bitcoin ETF will trade under the ticker BCOIN and features a decarbonization plan.\n\nEurope lists a Bitcoin ETF ahead of the U.S. despite a swathe of applications from issuers like Blackrock and Fidelity.\n\nLondon-based asset manager Jacobi has listed a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Europe two years after the company received approval from regulators.\n\nJacobi was approved to list its Jacobi FT Wilshere Bitcoin ETF in Amsterdam in 2021. However, the firm delayed its debut till 2023 due to crypto crashes like Terra and Three Arrows Capital which happened last year.\n\nThe ETF launched with Flow Traders as a market-making partner while Fidelity Digital Assets is in charge of custody for the fund. Jacobi\u2019s ETF trading under the ticker BCOIN is regulated by Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC).\n\nUnlike other products in the European market which are debt instruments, our fund owns the underlying asset directly. Jacobi is proud to be supported by Tier1 partners at the forefront of this digital asset market evolution whilst also pioneering an innovative, environmentally sound solution for European investors.\u201d \u2013 CEO of Jacobi Asset Management, Martin Bednal\n\nUS Spot Bitcoin ETF Await Approval\n\nJacobi\u2019s launch in Amsterdam means that Europe approved and listed a spot Bitcoin ETF ahead of the U.S. despite clear interest from American issuers.\n\nIndeed, titans like Valkyrie and Fidelity filed for spot Bitcoin ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Blackrock led a swathe of applications after the company submitted its filing in June.\n\nNotably, these filings buoyed by Blackrock\u2019s filing proposed a surveillance-sharing agreement to mitigate market manipulation, a major concern cited by the SEC in past spot Bitcoin ETF rejections.\n\nIf approved, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said the U.S. could account for 99.5% of the world\u2019s trading volume for crypto ETFs."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Bulls In Fear, Will ETH Revisit $900? - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "Ethereum is worrying investors. A major fall will soon be witnessed toward the round mark of $1000, followed by $900. The chart showcases bearishness and double top formation near $2000, and the price is struggling near the lower trendline of the symmetrical triangle pattern. This technical formation indicates that the ETH price is ready for a correction, and sellers are engaging in short buildup activity noted on the charts.\n\nFrom the start of 2023, ETH price showed accumulation, revamped from the support region of $1000, and showed a significant runaway. At now, the technical sentiments are signalling that ETH is looking to cool off the gains and looking for a retracement now. Moreover, the trading volume shows strong seller participation for the last session, and buyers are starting to unwind their positions and are in fear.\n\nThe ETH price failed to break out of $2000, and since then, there has been a steady decline. Furthermore, the ETH price is trading near the 100-day EMA and close to the major trendline, which, if it breaks, will lead to a major correction in the following sessions.\n\nAt press time, ETH price is trading at $1841 with an intraday drop of 0.27% showing selling pressure on the charts. Moreover, the trading volume increased by 1.66% to $4.95 Billion. The pair of ETH/BTC is at 0.0627 BTC, and the market cap is $224.75 Billion. Moreover, analysts\u2019 sell rating suggests a downfall toward $1000, followed by strong support of $900.\n\nETH Signals a Reversal Toward $900 On Daily Charts\n\nSource: ETH Price Chart At TradingView\n\nETH price is hovering in a narrow range on the daily charts, indicating a weak chart structure and signaling a correction in the following sessions. Moreover, the price is near the major trendline and the 200-day EMA, which, if it breaks, would lead to a revisit of the demand zone at $900. Moreover, key indicators initiated a sell signal which paused near the lower bollinger band waiting for a breakdown.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Short Term Chart Shows Negative Outlook\n\nSource: ETH Price Chart At TradingView\n\nOn the 4-hour charts, ETH price suggests a negative outlook with $900 being the likely target.\n\nThe RSI curve stayed near neutrality and showed a bearish divergence indicating a selling signal for the upcoming sessions. Moreover, the charts favour the bears, and buyers are looking in trouble now.\n\nThe MACD indicator showed convergence of moving averages; the MA line stuck with the signal line indicates consolidation. However, it also signals that the ETH price might face a significant correction toward $900 in the upcoming sessions.\n\nConclusion:\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is hovering near the cluster of $1800, close to the 200-day EMA, which sellers are preparing to smash in the upcoming sessions. The technicals are giving a sell signal, as the buyers started laying off the gains, confirming that sellers were looking to win the battle and came into action.\n\nTechnical Levels:\n\nSupport Levels: $1200 and $900\n\nResistance Levels: $2000 and $2200\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views and opinions stated by the author, or any people named in this article, are for informational purposes only and do not establish financial, investment, or other advice.
