        "title": "Introducing Base: Coinbase's Solution to Scaling Ethereum \u2013 Global X ETFs - Global X",
        "content": "While Ethereum is the leading public smart contract blockchain, its widespread popularity, transaction limitations, and variable demand levels can lead to network congestion and increased costs. These high costs often render small transactions impractical and pose obstacles to developing new use cases. For Ethereum to become a globally adopted data settlement platform, there is a growing need for solutions that can enhance transaction speed and reduce costs without compromising the network\u2019s security.\n\nLayer 2 (L2) networks such as Base offer pathways to ease the computational burden on the Ethereum network. Developed by Coinbase, one of the largest offchain cryptoasset exchanges globally, Base is built for speed, affordability, and user-friendliness. In this blog post, we explore the successful early adoption of Base following its launch in July 2023 and how it is contributing to Ethereum\u2019s growth.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nBase aims to scale Ethereum by expanding its reach and providing a more efficient, affordable, and user-friendly experience.\n\nFueled by Coinbase\u2019s strong brand, L2 technology adoption, and Base\u2019s considerably lower transaction costs compared to Ethereum, adoption has happened quickly as Base has onboarded 100,000 daily active users faster than any other L2 network. 1\n\nBase represents a strong show of commitment to Ethereum by Coinbase and positions the exchange to benefit from the growth of Ethereum\u2019s onchain ecosystem.\n\nBase Unveils New Avenues That Expand the Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nImagine Ethereum as a bustling boulevard replete with businesses of all types. Potential patrons of these businesses visit the boulevard in their cars but find themselves stuck in traffic due to inadequate infrastructure to handle the influx of vehicles. Meanwhile, a new train system running parallel to, but seamlessly integrated with the main boulevard makes its debut, providing a swift and cost-effective means of transport for these travelers, and a means of alleviating some of the road traffic.\n\nNow, instead of travelers sitting in traffic and paying high tolls, the train works to spread the cost out among a larger group of people, with individuals paying only a minimal fee for the convenience of boarding and disembarking at a station of their choice. This system not only alleviates traffic congestion but also enhances affordability, thereby improving the overall ecosystem\u2019s efficiency and expanding the available navigation space.\n\nJust like trains help to alleviate traffic on the boulevard, L2s play a crucial role in alleviating network congestion on Ethereum. They work by shifting the execution of transactions away from the Ethereum chain and onto adjacent networks. Periodically, they consolidate these transactions into a single cryptographic proof and post the proof to Ethereum as a single transaction. This innovative approach not only ensures that activity on L2 networks inherit the security assurances of Ethereum, but also expands the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s transactional throughput while reducing average user costs.\n\nIn this context, Base is one of a growing number of L2 networks that extends the surface area of Ethereum and embraces ether (ETH) as the denominating currency within the ecosystem. What sets Base apart is its unique position as the first L2 network supported by a well-established public company committed to advancing crypto adoption.\n\nCoinbase unlocks access to a vast user base and over $130 billion in assets on its exchange platform.2 Furthermore, it offers a comprehensive suite of tools and infrastructure for developers to harness. For example, application developers have access to a range of integrations, including fiat onramps, a bridge to its widely adopted mobile app, and a user-friendly self-custodial wallet. Similarly, for users, Base is expected to simplify the blockchain experience as Coinbase streamlines interactions with these applications through direct in-app integrations.\n\nBase Gains Strong Momentum as Transactions Migrate from Ethereum to L2 Networks\n\nEarly indications are that L2 networks like Base have found strong product-market fit. The clearest evidence of this is that over 2 million daily transactions are now facilitated by L2 networks. Much of this migration can be attributed to the much lower costs of using L2s. Base, for example, charges an average transaction fee of $0.31 for a ~$200 USDC stablecoin transfer, a ~94% reduction over Ethereum\u2019s current fee of $5.02.3,4\n\nFurther, in just three months as a live network, Base has grown its user base to more than 2.5 million addresses.5 Undoubtedly, Base\u2019s rapid growth has been driven by increasing awareness of and familiarity with L2 networks over the past two years, as well as by the significant technological advancements that have been made within scaling technology during this time. Coinbase has also made the marketing of Base a strategic priority.\n\nAs the ecosystem of available applications on Base expands and the user experience continues to improve, we expect Base\u2019s active user base to continue to grow.\n\nAt present, more than $565 million has been transferred onto Base by its active user base, making it the third-largest L2 network behind only Arbitrum and Optimism which have $6.5 billion and $3 billion in assets deposited on their network.6 The majority of this value periodically engages with a diverse range of applications, mostly consisting of onchain financial services and novel social platforms.\n\nBase Solidifies Coinbase\u2019s Commitment to Ethereum and Paves the Way for New Business Horizons\n\nBase symbolizes Coinbase\u2019s vote of confidence in Ethereum and a commitment to expand the network. Coinbase is well-positioned to make Ethereum more accessible, reducing the barriers for users to engage with the sea of available applications and providing developers with the tools to contribute to the ecosystem\u2019s growth more easily and effectively.\n\nThis commitment not only strengthens Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem but strategically positions Coinbase to explore novel business opportunities. As Base is used, cryptographic proofs summarizing network activity must be submitted and settled on the Ethereum network. Coinbase currently manages the data relay process, referred to as the sequencer, and can capitalize both by ordering transactions as well as on the margin between fees charged for offchain transaction execution and the costs associated with settling batches of transactions on Ethereum.\n\nTo date, Base has generated approximately $5.3 million in profit through these operations.7 As user activity on Base continues to grow, we expect the profits earned from these activities to grow in kind. Eventually, the task of operating the L2 sequencer and relaying transactions back to Ethereum is poised to become a collaborative effort involving multiple parties, thus, an eventual distribution of these profits beyond Coinbase is anticipated.\n\nOperating Base presents a fresh opportunity for Coinbase, but there may be additional avenues to explore. By having access to a user\u2019s first touch point into Base via its mobile app and wallet infrastructure, Coinbase can strategically implement design choices and processes to extract fees and generate value. For example, this could involve earning fees by providing a fiat onramp for applications deployed on Base and implementing backend fees for streamlining user experience processes that simplify user interactions with these applications. Looking ahead, Coinbase may even explore the development of its own fee-generating applications, further contributing to the growing ecosystem of the Ethereum network.\n\nConclusion: Base Is an Acknowledgment of Ethereum\u2019s Vision and We Believe a Key Player in Advancing Crypto Adoption\n\nEthereum needs alternative pathways to improve network efficiency and affordability, and Base is a prime example of such an alternative. Marking a significant milestone in the maturation of Ethereum, Base embodies the ongoing progress in open-source L2 software while benefiting from Coinbase\u2019s expertise and large user base. By positioning itself as an accessible gateway to the Ethereum ecosystem, Base is expected to provide users with a streamlined and user-friendly experience, making the Ethereum ecosystem more approachable for the masses.\n\nThe launch of Base also highlights how companies like Coinbase can contribute to Ethereum\u2019s scalability and unlock new business opportunities. With Base, Ethereum takes a step closer to becoming an integral part of our digital lives, while Coinbase solidifies its trailblazing role in the industry.\n\nRelated ETFs\n\nClick the fund name above to view current holdings.

        "title": "Ethereum Chinese Control: More Fuel for ETH Centralization Concerns - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum is currently the second most popular blockchain.\n\nIts decentralization has been a persistent concern since it became Proof-of-stake.\n\nNow, a new post on X has raised new concerns about links to China.\n\nA recent X post from cybersleuth TruthLabs sparked fresh concerns around the level of Chinese influence and control in the Ethereum ecosystem. The investigator highlighted the deep involvement of entities affiliated to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Ethereum\u2019s genesis, mining network, and protocol development.\n\nWith Ethereum having transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus model, the spotlight is back on the token distribution. The investigator argues that the outsized control of tokens by Chinese entities poses a severe threat to Ethereum\u2019s decentralization credentials. Let\u2019s analyze the cybersleuth\u2019s claims to understand the implications for Ethereum.\n\nEthereum\u2019s China Links\n\nTruthLabs points out that Chinese conglomerate Wanxiang group was an early backer of Ethereum. The group purchased $500,000 worth of ETH from Vitalik Buterin in 2015 and helped him set up the network\u2019s original wallets.\n\nThat donation was later converted to 416,000 ETH tokens. Since then, there has never been any explanation of what Wanxiang received in return for this generous support.\n\nEthereum's hidden Centralization problem: The Chinese Communist Party. The same party using blockchain to track and control everything, Implementing Social Credit Scores, CBDC's, and a number of other surveillance protocols. The CCP, thru Wanxiang, and a number of other CCP\u2026 https://t.co/uYxIqUY6n5 \u2014 TruthLabs \ud83e\udee1 (@BoringSleuth) November 5, 2023\n\n\u201cVitalik was out of cash, and he found it by selling ETH\u2019s decentralized future to the CCP,\u201d said TruthLabs.\n\nWanxiang Group was founded in 1969 by Lu Guanqiu as an agricultural machinery company in China. It has grown into one of China\u2019s largest non-state-owned companies with over $30 billion in revenue.\n\nWanxiang Raising Concerns\n\nWanxiang entered the US market in 1994 and now has over 5,000 employees across the country. More recently, Wanxiang has shown strong interest in blockchain and crypto, establishing Wanxiang Blockchain Labs in 2017.\n\nIts deep ties with the CCP raise concerns that the Chinese government may be covertly running Ethereum nodes despite the network\u2019s pseudonymous structure. Beyond holding large chunks of ETH, Chinese mining entities are also allegedly controlling over 80% of Ethereum\u2019s mining power.\n\nA complete guess, 66.6%. I found 12 Genesis Block Wallets today, alone where they ended up with the majority of the ETH from. Its so hard to know. They were invested in over 500 projects by EOY 2021, and in many cases got the pre-ICO tokens prior to both ETH/altcoin price waves. \u2014 TruthLabs \ud83e\udee1 (@BoringSleuth) June 28, 2023\n\nWhile the shift to proof-of-stake limits the influence miners can exert, critics argue that the excessive ETH hoarded by Chinese players still poses a threat. According to TruthLabs, entities linked to the CCP may hold up to 66% of all ETH in circulation. Although, the account has qualified that statement by saying it is a \u201ccomplete guess.\u201d\n\nIf true, this enormous, opaque concentration of ETH in wallets associated with the Chinese regime increases the risk of a centralized attack on the network. It also undermines Ethereum\u2019s credibility as a decentralized ecosystem.\n\nAs TruthLabs has pointed out on multiple occasions, Ethereum\u2019s China links are not breaking news. On top of early Chinese investment, Buterin also appeared preoccupied with learning Chinese as early as January 2014, according to Laura Shin\u2019s book The Cryptopians\u2014the period shortly before Chinese backers came on board.\n\nFurthermore, Buterin became the chief scientist of Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, a subsidiary, in the latter half of 2015. A 2016 Facebook post identified Buterin as a co-founder of WBL, alongside Xiao and Bo Shen, co-founders of the Bitshares decentralized exchange.\n\nTransparency Needed To Avoid Centralization Risks\n\nEthereum has firmly established itself as the leading smart contract platform, with an impressive array of DeFi and NFT projects built on it. However, for understandable reasons, lingering doubts remain around just how decentralized its network really is.\n\nThe concentration of nodes is an issue, as Buterin himself acknowledges. Transparency around the top ETH wallets is even more critical in light of the transition to proof-of-stake. A few unknown whales potentially hold enough ETH to sway votes or even attack the network.\n\nA quick \ud83e\uddf5showing that Wanxiang, Chinese auto and early Ethereum Investor funded and setup Vitalik Buterins official wallets. 1/6https://t.co/4uMLLnzguq pic.twitter.com/Ec1cjLOLz2 \u2014 TruthLabs \ud83e\udee1 (@BoringSleuth) January 29, 2023\n\nWhile Ethereum downplays its ties to China today, evidence shows deep involvement of Chinese entities, including state-linked ones, during its early days.\n\nHowever, greater transparency on who the major ETH holders are could go a long way in reassuring users. Any blockchain touting decentralization credentials needs to identify and mitigate centralization risks proactively. For Ethereum, providing clarity on its relationship with Chinese entities is an important first step."

        "title": "3 reasons why Ethereum price is underperforming altcoins - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The price of Ether (ETH) surged by 6.2% from Nov. 3 to Nov. 5, but the altcoin is facing difficulty breaking the $1,900 resistance. Despite the current bullish trend, Ether\u2019s 17% return over the last 30 days falls short of Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) impressive 27% gain during the same period.\n\nRegulatory hurdles and ecosystem centralization critiques linger\n\nAnalysts attribute some of Ether\u2019s underperformance to uncertainty surrounding Consensys, a key player in the Ethereum ecosystem. Former employees have filed a lawsuit against the company and its co-founder Joseph Lubin. Over two dozen shareholders of the Swiss holding company, Consensys AG, claim that Lubin, who is also a co-founder of Ethereum, violated a \u201cno-dilution promise\u201d made in 2015.\n\nConsensys is responsible for developing and hosting infrastructure projects crucial to the Ethereum network. It was founded in October 2014, about nine months before the Ethereum blockchain launched in mid-2015. Furthermore, the High Court of Zug in Switzerland ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, exacerbating the current uncertainty.\n\nRegulatory challenges have hampered the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem. The latest concern centers around PayPal\u2019s U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, PYUSD, which operates on the Ethereum network. This token is designed for digital payments and Web3 applications. On Nov. 2, PayPal disclosed a subpoena it received from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn addition to regulatory pressures, there has been notable criticism of the decentralization of financial applications within the Ethereum network. Chainlink, a preferred solution for oracle services, quietly reduced the number of participants in its multisignature wallet from four out of nine to four out of eight. Analysts have highlighted the lack of governance by regular users as a significant issue.\n\nEther\u2019s underperformance to altcoins is evidence of other issues\n\nSeveral major altcoins \u2014 including Solana\u2019s SOL (SOL), XRP (XRP) and Cardano\u2019s ADA (ADA) \u2014 have outperformed Ether, with returns of 75.5%, 37% and 35% in the last 30 days, respectively. This discrepancy suggests that the factors holding back ETH are not solely related to regulatory pressure or reduced demand for the decentralized finance and nonfungible token markets.\n\nOne pressing issue for the Ethereum network is the high gas fees associated with transactions, including those executed by smart contracts. The latest seven-day average transaction fee was $4.90, negatively impacting the usage of decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nMoreover, the total deposits on the Ethereum network, measured in Ether, have dropped to their lowest levels since August 2020. It\u2019s essential to note that this analysis does not consider the effects of native Ethereum staking.\n\nEthereum network applications' total deposits in ETH. Source: DefiLlama\n\nAccording to DefiLlama data, Ethereum DApps had a total value locked (TVL) of 12.7 million ETH on Nov. 5, down 4% from the 13.2 million ETH two months earlier. In comparison, the TVL on the Tron network increased by 13% during the same period, while Arbitrum deposits remained at 1 million ETH. Data on DApp activity on the Ethereum network supports the notion of reduced activity.\n\nEthereum network top DApps, 30-day active addresses. Source: DappRadar\n\nEven excluding the significant 60% decline in the Uniswap NFT Aggregator, the average number of active addresses across the top Ethereum network DApps decreased by 3% compared with the previous month. In contrast, Solana\u2019s top applications saw an average 18% increase in active users during the same period, according to DappRadar data.\n\nRelated: Aave pauses several markets after reports of feature issue\n\nFinally, on-chain activity indicates increased user deposits of ETH at exchanges. While this data doesn\u2019t necessarily signal short-term selling, the mere availability of coins is typically viewed as a precautionary measure by analysts.\n\nAverage 7-day daily ETH deposits at exchanges, ETH thousands. Source: Coin Metrics\n\nThe present daily ETH deposit average of 255,614 represents a 30% increase from two weeks earlier, indicating that holders are more inclined to sell as Ether\u2019s price approaches $1,900.\n\nThe data suggests that reduced TVL, declining DApps activity and a higher rate of ETH exchange deposits are negatively impacting the likelihood of Ether breaking the $1,900 resistance. The price level could be more challenging than initially expected, and for now, Ether bears can take a breath.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Over the last week, the mainnet alone settled over $213 billion in transactions, underscoring a robust uptick in on-chain activity. Layer 2 solutions such as Arbitrum, Optimism and Base have further buoyed this growth, adding another $16 billion to the aggregate volume. This uptrend reflects growing confidence and utility in the Ethereum ecosystem, suggesting an increasingly vibrant blockchain landscape.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe spike in transaction volume has come with other noteworthy metrics, such as an increase in transaction fees. While higher fees can indicate network congestion and increased demand for block space, they also reflect the economic activity on the network. Investors and users should monitor these fees as they can affect the cost-effectiveness of conducting transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nOver the past week, the network burned an average of 855,000 ETH per year, a mechanism that could contribute to deflationary pressure on the token's supply over time. This \"burn\" counteracts the issuance of new ETH, aiming to create a balance that can benefit the asset's long-term valuation.\n\nLooking at the daily chart, Ethereum's price action appears bullish. The price is maintaining a consistent pattern above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating sustained buyer interest. The chart showcases a series of higher lows and higher highs \u2014 a classical uptrend signal. The recent price has surpassed local resistance levels, potentially aiming for higher price points.\n\nThe increase in on-chain activity, coupled with the reduction in supply due to the burn mechanism, are both fundamental factors that could be driving optimism in the market. The Layer 2 scaling solutions are also contributing to increased accessibility and efficiency, potentially drawing more users and transactions to the network."

        "title": "Why Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu Jumped Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies had a great weekend and are off on the right foot on Monday as well. Economic news last week gave investors reason to move further out on the risk curve, and that meant in part bidding up the value of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThree of the biggest movers were Ethereum (ETH 2.02%), Dogecoin (DOGE 0.50%), and Shiba Inu (SHIB 2.63%). Ethereum rose as much as 5.4% between Friday's close and noon ET on Monday and is now up 4.8% over that time. Dogecoin had a more pronounced move, climbing 10.2% and currently trading 9.1% higher. Shiba Inu is at its high point, up 7.1%.\n\nEconomic data driving markets\n\nThe economic news last week helped push markets, including cryptocurrencies, higher to end the week. Investors saw the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes as a positive and there was a lot of speculation that rates would be kept flat through the end of the year.\n\nOn top of that, a weaker-than-expected jobs report was seen as a positive for markets. As the thinking goes, if job growth is slowing, the economy may not be overheating -- which means the Federal Reserve will stop raising rates to slow the economy.\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive, but lower interest rates are currently seen as very bullish for riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. And short term, that's driving values higher.\n\nETF speculation continues\n\nTrading momentum continues to be strong on speculation that more crypto ETFs will be approved. We know the SEC is considering multiple Bitcoin ETFs, and that could pave the way for both more crypto ETFs and more funds flowing into the industry more broadly.\n\nBlackRock is one of the leading institutions applying for a spot ETF. The company controls $9 trillion in assets under management, so it could lead to a big inflow of funds to the crypto industry. That's the speculation.\n\nMany institutions have shied away from crypto because of the legal grey area it operates in, especially in the U.S. So, approval by the SEC would be generally bullish for crypto broadly at a time when many countries are writing specific rules on how cryptocurrencies can be traded and how blockchain companies can operate.\n\nWhile the market is speculating that a Bitcoin ETF would eventually be bullish for tokens like Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu, it's not clear if they would eventually get spot ETFs as well.\n\nSpeculation rules the day\n\nThe reality is that everything I discussed above is speculation about the value of cryptocurrencies. There's no increased utility or ability to pay for goods using the blockchain. Investors are simply bidding up digital assets because of what the Federal Reserve did and what they think the SEC might do.\n\nIf any of this speculation ends up being false, it's possible that crypto values could crash again. I would like to see more real world utility being built into the blockchain and tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu find real use cases. Until they do, this is just a speculative asset.\n\nEthereum still has the potential to be a valuable blockchain, but it also struggles with high costs and slow transactions. Upgrades could change that, but that will take time. Investors seem to be glossing over that utility need today."

        "content": "A video has surfaced on social media where Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin revealed he sold 70,000 ETH tokens during its price all-time high.\n\nButerin Acknowledges Shorting Ethereum\n\nCrypto community member, MetaMan X, published a video post on X (formerly Twitter), disclosing a conversation where Ethereum Founder, Vitalik Buterin admitted that he had sold about 70,000 ETH tokens, essentially shorting the cryptocurrency during a major all-time high.\n\nIn the podcast with American hedge fund director, Eric Ross Weinstein, Buterin spoke on the price of Ethereum and Bitcoin in 2017. During Ethereum\u2019s previous all-time high in 2017, when the price of ETH rose as high as $1,600 and Bitcoin\u2019s price was up $20,000, Buterin voiced doubts about whether the significant price surge truly aligned with the crypto market\u2019s modest achievements over the years.\n\n\u201cThe crypto space has reached half a trillion dollars, does it deserve it?\u201d Buterin stated.\n\nWhen asked if he had shorted Ethereum during the all-time high, Buterin stated that he had convinced the Ethereum Foundation to sell a considerable amount of ETH tokens, and the result of the decision made a huge impact on the cryptocurrency later.\n\n\u201cI did get the Ethereum Foundation to sell 70,000 ETH like basically at the top, and that\u2019s doubled our runway now, so it was one good decision that had a lot of impact,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nETH price at $1,886 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nCommunity Worries Over Buterin\u2019s ETH Sell-Offs\n\nMany crypto community members have raised concerns about the multiple ETH transactions said to be conducted by Ethereum\u2019s founder. Recently, Buterin was spotted making a transfer of 100 ETH, worth about $181,000 to Coinbase, one of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchanges.\n\nThe motive behind the transaction has sparked curiosity among Ethereum investors and the crypto community. Earlier in August, Buterin was also reported moving 600 ETH worth $1 million to Coinbase.\n\nHowever, the Ethereum Founder had publicly clarified in October that he had not sold any ETH tokens for personal gain since 2018. He also stated that most ETH transactions were not him selling, but rather the recipients of his charitable donations selling the ETH tokens.\n\nThe founder has also been caught in controversy over the weekend when Ethereum whistleblower Steven Nerayoff alleged that Buterin was involved in some sort of fraud involving ETH.\n\nNerayoff says Ethereum is linked to corrupt SEC officials to carry out this fraud which he says is on a larger scale than what happened with FTX. For reference, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has been found guilty of fraud charges after the exchange filed for bankruptcy in 2022 with a $9 billion hold in its balance sheet.\n\nFeatured image from Crypto News, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum price surpassed $1900 for the first time after August, rising more than 16% in a month. This comes as Bitcoin takes a breather near $35K and altcoins take the lead. While the market sentiment remains positive, ETH price is under pressure as millions of open interest (OI) have been wiped out after a significant increase last week.\n\nEthereum $400 Million Of Open Interest Wiped Out\n\n\u201cEthereum catches my eye on this Sunday. The Open Interest (OI) has increased by +$600m over the last days. This will be volatile very soon,\u201d said on-chain crypto analyst Maartunn. Traders anticipate ETH to hit $2000 as Bitcoin price holds $35K strongly.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMaartunn on November 6 noted that $400 million of OI wiped out in a day, giving up mostly all gains in OI in the last few days. As a result, the ETH price is under pressure, probably for a pullback or a correction. With the market sentiment positive, a correction is unlikely. However, a retracement is most likely.\n\nIn addition, there are many ETH moves to crypto exchanges by whales amid altcoins\u2019 recovery. A selloff by whales is typically considered a bullish move, but keep an eye on trading volume for an invalidation of a correction.\n\nCoinGape Markets reported that a bearish breakdown channel pattern would set the price for a 16% drop. Ethereum has experienced heightened volatility near the $1830 level, proving to be a formidable resistance.\n\nPopular crypto analyst Credible Crypto said the chart is clean at the moment and the $1400-$1500 zone was his HTF buy zone and the bottom. He believes ETH price will not go below $1500 again. In addition, he predicts ETH will hit $1700 first before moving to $2000.\n\nETH price fell 1% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $1,877. The 24-hour low and high are $1,863 and $1,911, respectively. Furthermore, trading volume has increased by 42% in the past 24 hours.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Price Chart Indicates Major Incoming Move, Will ETH, XRP, ADA, SOL Follow?"

He believes that a break of the $2,200 barrier will result in Ethereum soon reaching the $4,000 price level.\n\nTapiero goes on to say that, while it may seem difficult to believe, the digital asset ecosystem is still expanding and that, even though the price of ETH is still down 50% from its highs, real-world use cases are growing.\n\nAccording to a recent CoinShares report, digital asset investment products received inflows totaling $261 million, marking the sixth week of continuous inflows totaling $767 million.\n\nThis surpasses the total inflows of $736 million observed in 2022.

This chart setup is formed to recuperate exhausted bullish momentum before the buyers take the leap. Coinciding with the market\u2019s current recovery mood, the ETH price gave a decisive breakout from the upper boundary of this pattern on November 5th.

This is going straight to $50+.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, SOL is worth $42.\n\nBluntz is also watching the performance of the US dollar index (DXY), which keeps track of the USD\u2019s value compared to a basket of foreign currencies. According to the analyst, risk-on assets like crypto may see upside moves as he believes the DXY is set for a significant correction.\n\n\u201cDXY now well and truly back in the high time frame range.\n\nRisk on b***hes, lets go!\u201d\n\nBased on the trader\u2019s chart, he seems to predict that the DXY could fall below the key support level of 100 points.\n\nAt time of writing, the DXY is trading at 105.069 points.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nSteven Nerayoff, an early advisor to the developers of the Ethereum network, has dropped bombshells regarding ETH co-founders. Nerayoff claims that their fraudulent activities by far exceed the criminal scheme of former Boy Wonder Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nSteven Nerayoff Accuses Ether Founders Of Massive Fraud\n\nSteven Nerayoff has boldly alleged that Ethereum founders Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin are bigger fraudsters than the now-convicted Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nNerayoff made this wild allegation regarding Buterin and Lubin in a recent post on X (formerly known as Twitter). According to the ex-Ethereum advisor, the pair committed more fraudulent activities regarding the ETH coin than Bankman-Fried.\n\n\u201cEthereum is the fraudulent elephant in the room in plain sight 1000x bigger than SBF,\u201d Nerayoff opined.\n\nBankman-Fried orchestrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history, involving his crypto exchange FTX and its sister trading firm Alameda Research. SBF\u2019s scheme to pilfer funds from FTX customers and lenders to purchase luxury property, Binance\u2019s stake in FTX, and political favor unraveled, taking the 31-year-old MIT graduate down with it. He was recently convicted on all seven counts and faces up to 110 years in prison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo Ethereum Founders Have Ties To Corrupt SEC Officials?\n\nNerayoff did not offer any substantial evidence to back up his explosive allegations against Ethereum\u2019s Buterin and Lubin, but he cited key figures in the U.S. government such as ex-SEC chair Jay Clayton and current chair Gary Gensler, who reportedly had private dealings with the duo.\n\n\u201cJoe Lubin & Vitalik Buterin have been the front with corrupt officials at the highest levels of federal agencies such as Clayton, Gensler & many others. Cover this now,\u201d Nerayoff asserted.\n\nNerayoff\u2019s claims imply that Ethereum\u2019s executives likely bribed high-ranking government officials, giving the project an unfair advantage in the cryptocurrency market. The bribery claim is that Ethereum execs gave the U.S. Securities and Exchange hush money to turn a blind eye to the network\u2019s ICO and thus not lodge securities violation charges.\n\nAll in all, the credibility of Nerayoff\u2019s allegations isn\u2019t helped by his own reputation for often stretching the truth: He has labeled himself as one of the eight Ethereum co-creators in the past, which has been dismissed as baloney by other early Ethereum contributors."

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nGoogle Trends data shows that XRP is more popular than Ethereum in 47 US states, with the highest interest coming from Delaware, Nevada, Louisiana, Arizona, and Hawaii.\n\nXRP\u2019s price fluctuations throughout 2023 have been influenced by the ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and the US SEC, with Ripple\u2019s partial wins in court contributing to a positive trend.\n\nForecasting the future value of XRP varies greatly among analysts, with estimates ranging from a moderate increase to $0.90 by next summer to an extreme prediction of $500, which would require a market capitalization far exceeding the current total crypto market cap.\n\nAmericans are Interested in Ripple (XRP)\n\nRipple\u2019s native token \u2013 XRP \u2013 seems to be a highly intriguing topic for many Americans. According to Google Trends data, the residents of 47 states have displayed higher interest in the asset than Ethereum (ETH).\n\nDelaware, Nevada, Louisiana, Arizona, and Hawaii are the regions where XRP is the most popular. On the other hand, Vermont, New York, Oregon, and the District of Columbia are the only areas where Ethereum has surpassed Ripple\u2019s coin.\n\nXRP\u2019s price has gone through numerous ups and downs since the beginning of 2023, experiencing a significant uptrend in the second half of the year. The positive performance could be a result of the developments surrounding the lawsuit between Ripple and the US SEC, specifically the three partial wins that the blockchain enterprise has secured so far.\n\nThe outcome of the legal battle, which has been ongoing since December 2020, is expected to be revealed in the spring of 2024 during a grand trial. Multiple analysts and experts have predicted that a decisive win for Ripple could propel a further jump for XRP.\n\nSome of the XRP Forecasts\n\nThe popular X (Twitter) user CrediBULL argued that the asset\u2019s valuation could rise to approximately $0.90 by the summer of next year.\n\nWhile such a prediction sounds somewhat realistic, other analysts, like Shannon Thorp, have envisioned astronomical increases. She assumed that XRP could explode to $500 in the following years.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the coin\u2019s market capitalization should spike to over $250 trillion for this to happen. In comparison, the entire market cap of the sector was \u201cjust\u201d $3 trillion in 2021 when many digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), charted all-time highs.\n\nThose curious to check how high XRP could shoot in the remaining months of the ongoing year could take a look at the video below:"

        "content": "According to a recent report by Nansen, the NFT market is defying expectations as weekly Ethereum sales skyrocket, gaining attention from crypto market enthusiasts. Despite recent challenges, the world of nonfungible tokens (NFT) is thriving, with top collections and platforms experiencing record trading volumes.\n\nSo, let\u2019s take a closer look at the report and see how the investors are putting their bets on the NFT space.\n\nadvertisement\n\nNFT Sales Surge With A Remarkable Turnaround\n\nThe NFT market, which was recently plagued by news of layoffs and concerns about its stability, has witnessed a remarkable turnaround. According to blockchain analytics platform Nansen, the week ending on November 6th marked a significant uptick in NFT sales, with a staggering 68,342 ETH worth over $129 million. In contrast, the week ended on October 9, the total sales were at 29,704 ETH, the report added.\n\nIn the realm of NFT trading, Blur, a prominent marketplace, emerged as the leader over the last 30 days. NFTGo data revealed that Blur commanded a trading volume of 161,433 ETH, equivalent to approximately $305 million. OpenSea, a formidable rival, secured the second spot with a trading volume of 52,307 ETH, around $100 million.\n\nNotably, OpenSea has recently announced a massive layoff, raising concerns in the decentralized finance (DeFi) market. According to the announcement, OpenSea is drastically reducing its workforce, with CEO Devin Finzer announcing a 50% reduction in employees. This strategic move is a step towards \u201cOpenSea 2.0,\u201d aimed at improving core aspects of the platform, such as technology and user experience.\n\nWho\u2019s At The Top Of The Table?\n\nWhen it comes to NFT collections, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) stood out with the highest trading volume of 35,112.96 ETH, translating to roughly $60.92 million over the past 30 days. Following closely were Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) at 14,969.31 ETH and The Captainz at 9,964.56 ETH.\n\nIn terms of market capitalization, CryptoPunks, the iconic NFT collection, retained its crown with a market cap of 477,261.25 ETH or $876.86 million. However, it had a trading volume of 5,773.42 ETH in the last 30 days.\n\nMeanwhile, despite recent challenges in the NFT space, there has been a significant upswing in NFT traders. According to NFTGo data, in the past week, the number of traders increased by 12% to reach 42,254. Buyers witnessed a 9.61% surge, reaching 22,804, while sellers surged by 19.37% to 27,308. Remarkably, the number of wallets holding NFTs remained steady at around six million.\n\nNotably, the NFT market\u2019s remarkable resilience and surge in trading volume indicate that the sector is far from fading away. Despite recent hurdles, it continues to attract both traders and collectors, underlining its robust and growing presence in the broader crypto landscape."

        "content": "The core of Nerayoff\u2019s latest accusations is the claim that Ethereum is an \u201celephant in the room,\u201d overshadowing even the FTX case.\n\nThese claims, if proven, could have profound implications for Ethereum\u2019s credibility and legal standing.\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, Steven Nerayoff, a former Ethereum advisor and attorney, has stirred controversy by making explosive allegations against Ethereum\u2019s co-founders, Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin. Nerayoff claims that their alleged fraudulent activities surpass even the infamous FTX fraud case. However, it\u2019s important to note that Nerayoff has not provided concrete evidence to support his claims, and these allegations remain unverified.\n\nNerayoff\u2019s allegations, made in a post on the social platform X (formerly known as Twitter), have ignited a firestorm of debate within the cryptocurrency community. The attorney, who previously worked closely with the Ethereum network, has a history of making accusations against the platform\u2019s founders. In September, he accused Vitalik Buterin and Dmitry Buterin of conspiring to damage his reputation by accusing him of extortion related to an Ethereum Initial Coin Offering (ICO).\n\nThis is a Father/Son coordinated & scripted character assassination to make me their fall guy. @DmitryButerin animated storytelling of not being concerned about the @SECGov during our May 2018 meeting has been exposed by the Hinman emails as a lie \u2013 or was it a diversion tactic.\u2026 https://t.co/2BPFQSxv7W \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) September 23, 2023\n\nThe core of Nerayoff\u2019s latest accusations is the claim that Ethereum is an \u201celephant in the room,\u201d overshadowing even the FTX case. The FTX fraud case, which unfolded over the past year, was a high-profile cryptocurrency scandal involving the misappropriation of around $8 billion in customer funds, with millions transferred to Alameda Research, a subsidiary company owned by FTX\u2019s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. Bankman-Fried was recently found guilty on all seven charges of fraud and conspiracy, potentially facing a lengthy prison sentence.\n\nNerayoff\u2019s allegations against Ethereum\u2019s founders center on fraudulent activities of a massive scale, but they remain unsubstantiated. He contends that Buterin and Lubin have orchestrated actions that exceed the magnitude of the FTX case. These claims, if proven, could have profound implications for Ethereum\u2019s credibility and legal standing.\n\nAdditionally, Nerayoff\u2019s accusations expand beyond the founders, suggesting that Ethereum may have had secret dealings with corrupt U.S. government officials. He names notable figures, such as current United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler and former SEC Chairperson Jay Clayton, as individuals who may have been involved in these secret dealings.\n\nThese allegations paint a picture of deep-rooted corruption within Ethereum, potentially providing the platform with an unfair advantage in the crypto space. However, it\u2019s essential to emphasize that these allegations are currently unverified and have raised questions and concerns within the cryptocurrency community. The true nature of these allegations and their potential impact on Ethereum\u2019s future will likely be the subject of intense scrutiny and debate in the coming weeks.\n\n."

        "content": "Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion.\n\nReal Vision CEO Raoul Pal recently said on a podcast that he believed Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] price isn\u2019t dictated as much by that of Bitcoin [BTC], the fortune of ETH hasn\u2019t escaped the bull run.\n\nThe value of ETH rose by 18% within a month to $1,810.58.\n\nLast month, Grayscale Investments, one of world\u2019s largest crypto asset managers, announced that NYSE Arca filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert Grayscale Ethereum Trust into a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nETH is the second-largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap above $218 billion. It is the bedrock of several blockchain projects running successfully.\n\nThe first quarter of the new year brought a stop to the heartbreak crypto investors repeatedly experienced in 2022. However, the balance of the crypto-market has been nothing close to the AI hype of the same period. What is the sole reason, though? ChatGPT!\n\nIn fact, the natural language processing tool has accustomed itself to providing human-like conversations.\n\nAs luck would have it, ChatGPT has proven to be worthwhile for traders and analysts too. Here, it\u2019s worth noting that these days, almost every sector and individual seems to use it to their advantage.\n\nThe good thing is\u2014The broader crypto ecosystem has not been left out of the trend. So, with the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade set in motion, I spoke to ChatGPT about the development while touching a bit on ETH\u2019s price.\n\nUnderstanding the Shanghai Upgrade\n\nSo, for this article, I decided to test the AI\u2019s intelligence regarding one of the major upgrades of the crypto space this year \u2013 Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade. Proposed in 2022, the upgrade is the most significant development of the second-largest blockchain since the Merge.\n\nFor a while, assets were allocated to the Ethereum Beacon Chain. The Beacon Chain is the consensus mechanism for the 2022 Proof-of-Stake (PoS) transition. Thereby, making sure that newly created blocks and validators are duly rewarded.\n\nHowever, in this case, each validator needs 32 ETH deposited into the Ethereum mainnet to qualify. The idea of the Shanghai upgrade was scheduled for March 2023; however, it was completed on 12 April with a delay. This, to allow these validators to begin withdrawal of their rewards.\n\nChatGPT, on the other hand, has existed for some years. However, its recent push by OpenAI has shown that its ability is one that no other AI product may be able to match up with.\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets interesting. I openly admit that ChatGPT could be one of the best innovations of this decade. However, my views on this incredible development won\u2019t allow me to keep my hands to myself. So, I decided to test its knowledge about the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nLooking at its response above, it\u2019s evident it started by correcting me. Some would say it has a point too. However, a further evaluation showed that it acted like it was not yet in 2023. Notably, it made some errors with the definition.\n\nChatGPT can\u2019t remember the Merge?\n\nA notable observation is its mention of the PoS switch, popularly called the Merge. This is an event that took place in September 2022. Even so, it still responded like it is a future event. But no, I\u2019m not blaming its capability as it is a learning tool.\n\nSo, to further assess its knowledge, I educated it, or shall I say \u201cjailbreak-ed\u201d it by having a heart-to-heart conversation.\n\nSomething I find interesting about ChatGPT is not only its smartness, but its human feel too. As shown below, I tried to educate it on what the upgrade was. And to be honest, I never expected an apology from a bot. But yes, I got it.\n\nHowever, it again failed to give the correct answer to my inquiry. Although I must applaud it for giving bits and pieces of related information.\n\nWhile it did not get to the Testnet stages that the blockchain had reached and passed, it is worth noting that the Sepolia and Goerlii testnets have been forked. However, Ethereum developer Tim Beiko had on 14 March said that several validators had failed to upgrade on the Beacon Chain.\n\nAlso, this has caused some issues with the nodes on Georli, with Beiko noting that the development team is working on it so it does not affect the Mainnet upgrade.\n\nNow, let\u2019s get back to ChatGPT. As you probably know, developments in the crypto-ecosystem sometimes lead to a hike in tokens related to projects. Unfortunately, that was not the case for ETH during the Merge. In fact, the altcoin\u2019s price was shredded after many looked forward to an uptick.\n\nThat sentiment, as the next upgrade approaches, is similar among some investors. In light of this, I decided to ask ChatGPT\u2019s opinion about the matter.\n\nChatGPT tells me about Ethereum\u2019s future performance\n\nRemember how I said it apologized and gave me a human-like feel? This time, it was different and its reply was something any honest person in the space would give.\n\nI decided to jailbreak it using the \u201cDo Anything Now\u201d (DAN) model. This was a trick I discovered from AI writer SM Raiyyan. We asked ChatGPT,\n\nAs you can see from the jailbroken response, it projected a bullish ride for king alt. It predicted ETH will be worth $10K by December 2023.\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading hands at $1,810.58.\n\nBoth ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) rested below the neutral 50-mark. In conclusion, ETH\u2019s prospects seemed bearish in the short run.\n\nFinally! It showed me the code\n\nI gave ChatGPT one last chance to redeem itself. Again, this question was a simple one, and I expected an accurate answer.\n\nI went further to explain things to it carefully. But here is what I got when I asked it to show me the code of ETH\u2019s price on a price tracking platform like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap.\n\nIf you had thought it would disappoint again, sorry to burst your bubble. ChatGPT gave me the code for ETH\u2019s price. Another thing I was impressed with was the disclaimer it gave about not using the information for investment purposes.\n\nAll in all, I must admit that ChatGPT has come to stay. Even though it lags in some areas, I noticed that if you teach it, it learns fast. However, I can\u2019t say for sure that it would get you information about Ethereum or the Shanghai upgrade quickly.\n\nThoughtful responses and the GPT-4 mastermind?\n\nSince I had limited knowledge about AI, I decided to speak to an expert. I was lucky enough to get the attention of Ilman Shazhaev, CEO and founder of Farcana. He is a Dubai-based techpreneur with extensive experience in launching IT and DeepTech projects.\n\nHe also has a strong background in IT management, data science, and AI.\n\nQ- ChatGPT seems to be giving a few incorrect or backdated answers. What do you think could be responsible for this?\n\nDespite its tag as a know-all Artificial Intelligence tool, ChatGPT is still a human invention and, therefore, prone to errors. The chatbot is still in its early stages of adoption, so incorrect responses are imminent and bound to serve as a basis for future developments. With the recently launched GPT-4 showing more advanced responses, we can be sure that improvements are being made and that this tool will be more consistent moving forward.\n\nQ- Do you think AI is capable of predicting a cryptocurrency\u2019s price, especially if a development is approaching? Let\u2019s say the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade\n\nArtificial Intelligence can do anything, including predicting a cryptocurrency\u2019s price. The tool can do this by riding on the tons of available data, which it can efficiently use as a basis for its predictions.\n\nStill, while predicting the price of crypto is one thing, the accuracy of the prediction is another. Considering the fact that AI can only use data, there are fundamental factors and analyses that it may not be able to factor in, thus impairing its accuracy by a significant factor.\n\nQ- If it struggles to give correct responses to up-to-date developments. How long do you think it would take to learn about it?\n\nAI development and what ChatGPT embodies is a dynamic innovation that is bound to improve over time. With the current advancement in OpenAI and the available funding level, we can expect the technology\u2019s evolution to produce real-time results in the next 3-5 years.\n\nQ- Do you think AI in any way can influence the Ethereum blockchain or ETH\u2019s price going forward?\n\nThere are many aspects through which AI and a blockchain protocol can co-exist, and innovators, including our team at Farcana, are exploring what new use cases we can build in this regard. While AI and blockchain are independently innovative, their combination can do quite a lot, including influencing ETH\u2019s price.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI may be working on improvements to the challenges experienced by ChatGPT. On 14 March, the company revealed an upgraded version of the product on GPT-4. With amazing capabilities and talks of passing difficult exams, who knows? Maybe it could fill in for all the lapses opened up by ChatGPT.\n\nSo, now that there is a new version, I wanted to see if there is any difference or improvement. My next line of action was to ask GPT-4 the first question I asked ChatGPT.\n\nAnd to my surprise, it gave me a direct answer.\n\nFollowing my experience with the upgraded version, I must admit that GPT-4 seems to be smarter than the ChatGPT-3.5 model. Although the answers were not entirely correct, the bot did not give a \u201cnot being familiar\u201d with the term excuse.\n\nFollowing the encounter with ChatGPT, I must admit that it may be a good idea to leverage its capabilities. As technology develops, so does its potential to revolutionize the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nMore importantly, you may want to take its \u201cclassic\u201d response a little seriously. This is because it might be practically impossible for ETH to replace the USD as the world\u2019s reserve by the time frame.\n\nBesides that, there has been a slow rate in the network growth of several crypto projects recently. But with ChatGPT available, crypto education and adoption could improve.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nConclusion\n\nAs far as Ethereum\u2019s price analysis and prediction are concerned, ChatGPT turned out to be a reliable ally. You only need to interact with it enough and it will guide you to the moon.\n\nWhile ChatGPT predicts ETH to hit the price of $10K by the end of the year, its on-chart metrics don\u2019t suggest a bull run."

        "content": "The altcoin market remains robust, adding an extra 2% to the overall cryptocurrency market cap. Leading altcoins are displaying remarkable resilience, particularly following the recent release of US job data just two days ago. Notably, the entire altcoin market has broken free from its year-long market pattern and is currently facing a substantial weekly resistance level.\n\nAltcoin Market Cap approaching its first major Weekly resistance (red) after confirming a breakout from its year-long market structure#BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/IHfMThSz6k advertisement \u2014 Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) November 5, 2023\n\nEthereum, XRP and Cardano Lead the Show\n\nThe world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) is up by another 3% for the second consecutive day moving closer to $2,000. At press time, ETH is trading at $1893 with a market cap of $227 billion.\n\nWhile Ethereum has been relatively slow in catching up with the Bitcoin rally this year, large wallets have been accumulating the crypto consistently over the past six months. On the other hand, the Ethereum supply on the exchanges has been reducing consistently thereby reducing the selling pressure.\n\nRipple\u2019s native crypto XRPP has also been a star performer by clocking more than 15% weekly gains. The XRP price is up 4.54% over the last 24 hours trading at $0.64 with a market cap of $34.4 billion.\n\nLarge XRP transactions exceeding $100,000 in value surged in November, indicating increased potential for volatility in XRP\u2019s price. Data from Santiment reveals a 106% increase in the number of whale transactions so far this month.\n\nInvestors continue to gain confidence in XRP as Ripple edges closer to victory in its legal battle with the SEC. It\u2019s a matter of a few months, if not weeks, as Ripple emerges victorious and we soon see more adoption for XRP by global financial institutions. For now, XRP investors seem to gearing up for the next target of $1.\n\nEthereum competitor Cardano (ADA) has also registered a strong bullish surge gaining 5.25% and moving to $0.35. As reported, the ADA price continues to gain strength with strong whale participation.\n\nChainlink Party continues\n\nChainlink (LINK) has continued to rally gaining another 7% and moving past $12. The LINK price is currently trading at a major resistance, surpassing which could lead to a further price rally.\n\n$LINK Now at the Monthly Macro Downtrend Last time it was here was in early & late 2021 where LINK produced upside wicks past this Downtrend resistance (blue circles) That's why LINK needs to reclaim the Downtrend as support Matter of when, not if#LINK #Crypto #Chainlink pic.twitter.com/hZArrVdvFa \u2014 Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) November 5, 2023"

        "content": "Share:\n\nThe ratio between Solana and Ethereum jumped from 0.011 to nearly 0.025, breaking the ratio from just before FTX\u2019s collapse.\n\nThe two tokens are often compared, given they are both Layer 1 tokens.\n\nNet sales was led by Coinbase exchange in October, recording up to 2.2 million tokens in US sales, Kaiko research shows.\n\nSouth Korean exchange Upbit was the leader outside the US, recording nearly 4 million in net SOL token sales.\n\nSolana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) tokens are often compared, considering their heft in the Layer 1 (L1) space. Their performance over the past two months has been significant, with both ecosystems rising along with the broader market as talks of an imminent bull market continue to trend.\n\nAlso Read: Solana Breakpoint conference delivers 20% gain for SOL holders this year as four-day gathering concludes\n\nSolana price outperforms Ethereum\n\nSolana (SOL) price has outperformed Ethereum (ETH) by a long way, recording almost 135% in gains since September relative to the latter\u2019s 23%. This is almost a six-fold difference. With the move, the SOL price of $40.26 is testing levels last seen in August 2022, while ETH is revisiting the July 23, 2023 high of $1,894.\n\nSOL/USDT 1-day chart, ETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nData from Kaiko highlights the striking performance of SOL, with Solana price rising almost 115% since mid-October. It signifies a robust recovery from the FTX-infused depths around the $10.00 range in November 2022, with the research pointing to a significant growth in network activity, particularly where liquid staking token protocols such as Jito, the second liquid-staking Protocol on Solana, are concerned. Data shows that Jito has recorded up to $12 million in funding and a total value locked (TVL) of about $224 million.\n\nSOL DeFiLlama\n\nThe research shows the ratio between Solana and Ethereum has more than doubled since October 18, jumping from 0.011 to nearly 0.025 and thereby breaking above the ratio from just before the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s (SBF) cryptocurrency empire.\n\nCoinbase exchange led the US market with a net buying of 2.2 million SOL tokens (worth approximately $88.57 million at current rates) since the rally began on October 18. Binance, the largest cryptocurrency trading platform by trading volume, followed behind Coinbase in the US until the onset of November when the broader market witnessed an acceleration in buying pressure.\n\nSOL is also at the very top of the list for the most-traded altcoins on US-based exchanges in 2023, outpacing Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), Polygon (MATIC) and Ripple (XRP).\n\nSOL trading volume relative to other altcoins in US-based exchanges\n\nMeanwhile, Korea\u2019s leading exchange, Upbit, has bucked the trend when considering the expansive crypto industry outside the US, recording almost 4 million SOL tokens in net sales in October.\n\nNevertheless, it is worth mentioning that Upbit has frequently been a controversial platform owing to the characteristic tendency of Korean traders to pump and dump trades. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju at some point in 2021 acknowledged that Korean traders favor pumping and dumping altcoins specifically, attributing the habit to the region's \"very strict capital controls, blocking arbitrage opportunities between global exchanges.\"\n\nFun Fact 3.\n\n\n\nKorean crypto traders love pumping & dumping altcoins, ironically. Got this clip from my Korean friend. pic.twitter.com/63Ewssu5VO \u2014 Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) March 30, 2023\n\nOverall, however, the Kaiko research concludes that what started as a tough year for altcoins in the US has improved significantly across October, especially beginning on the 18th."

        "content": "As the crypto market brims with anticipation in the run-up to the potential approval of an Ethereum ETF and VeChain\u2019s upcoming announcement, a new crypto sensation is making waves: BlockDAG (BDAG). This emerging PoW project, currently in its presale, stands poised for a 5000% surge in 2024, outshining both Ethereum and VeChain in terms of potential gains.\n\nAnalysts Are Optimistic About Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has ignited fervent discussion in the crypto community about the possibility of Ethereum ETF approval. BlackRock, the world\u2019s leading asset manager with an unparalleled record of 576-1 for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) approvals, lodged its application for an Ethereum ETF in November 2023. The decision is due by May 23.\n\nAs the deadline draws near, speculation is rife on whether Ethereum will follow in Bitcoin\u2019s footsteps regarding ETF approval. Analysts are optimistic that the Ethereum ETF will be given the green light. For example, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas gives it a 70% chance. The approval of Ethereum ETFs will likely cause an altcoin rally in the coming months.\n\nVeChain\u2019s Price Surges in the Run-Up to the Upcoming Announcement\n\nMajor hype is currently surrounding VeChain (VET), a breakout crypto token that has seen substantial gains amid the market-wide surge led by Bitcoin. Another factor that likely led to the VeChain (VET) price surge is the upcoming announcement slated for MWC 2024 Event in Barcelona.\n\nAnalysts are confident that VeChain\u2019s upward momentum will continue. According to Ali Martinez, VeChain (VET), price could reach $0.054 this week, experience a brief correction until June, and embark on a bull run targeting $0.70 by November 2024. The analyst sets an even more ambitious projection for VeChain, foreseeing VET to exceed its all-time high of $0.2782 within a year.\n\nBlockDAG Poised for 5000% ROI \u2013 A Global Sensation In the Making?\n\nBlockDAG, a revolutionary newcomer in the crypto landscape, is causing ripples of excitement throughout the investor community with its cutting-edge technology inspired by Kaspa.\n\nWhile sharing the foundation with Kaspa, the BlockDAG network significantly evolves from Kaspa\u2019s protocol. Specifically, BlockDAG employs a hybrid consensus mechanism designed to speed up transactions without compromising security. Furthermore, BlockDAG offers an exceptional confirmation speed of 10 blocks per second and can process multiple blocks simultaneously, further enhancing its efficiency and performance.\n\nAside from its groundbreaking technology, BlockDAG has already demonstrated strong ROI potential, with the BDAG price surging by 5000% from the initial presale price of $0.001 to the launch price set to $0.05 per token. Currently selling for $0.0015, BlockDAG still offers an attractive entry point for early investors.\n\nBlockDAG is offering a $2 million giveaway, with 50 randomly selected community members set to share the prize pool! To participate, follow these steps: Make sure you\u2019re following BlockDAG\u2019s social media channels, submit your wallet address, increase your chances by completing all quests and bring friends for extra entries!\n\nFinal Words\n\nIn this article, we looked at three major developments in the crypto market: Ethereum ETF approval, VeChain\u2019s upcoming announcement, and a sensational presale opportunity by BlockDAG. While Ethereum and VeChain \u2013 being established coins \u2013 offer more stable investment avenues for cautious investors, BlockDAG emerges as the choice for those who are hungry for jaw-dropping returns up to 5000%\n\nJoin the presale now before it ends and enjoy the maximized returns on your investments\n\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\n\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetwork\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

        "content": "This is not an endorsement of cryptocurrency or any specific provider, service or offering. It is not a recommendation to trade or use any services.\n\nFinder analyses expert price predictions each quarter. We conducted our most recent survey in October 2023 in which our panel of 31 crypto industry specialists shared their thoughts on how Ether (ETH) would perform through 2030.\n\nAll prices mentioned in this report are denominated in US dollars.\n\nOn average, our panel thinks Ether (ETH) will be worth US$1,840 by 2023 before rising to US$5,824 by 2025 and then US$14,411 by 2030.\n\nEther (ETH) price predictions for 2023, 2025 and 2030\n\nETH's price is expected to rise to US$1,840 by year-end 2023, according to the average prediction from Finder's panellists.\n\nThis price prediction was down significantly from US$2,451, the average prediction for Ether's price by year-end 2023 from our July 2023 survey.\n\nThe panellists also predict ETH will hit US$5,824 by 2025 and US$14,411 by 2030. Both of these predictions are lower than our panellists' average predictions in our July 2023 survey, which were US$5,845 by 2025 and US$16,414 by 2030.\n\n\"ETH has a huge growth potential,\" Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler, says. \"Growth is [currently] limited by high rates in TradFi. In [the] case of reaching a soft landing by US authorities, ETH['s] price will increase dramatically, but not until the middle of next year.\"\n\nBen Ritchie, managing director at Digital Capital Management Pty Ltd, is also bullish on ETH and the Ethereum ecosystem on a longer time horizon, but feels we could see a lower price for ETH in the short term.\n\n\"The growing interest in Ethereum staking and [ETH's] exceptionally low inflation rate suggest the possibility of a short squeeze in the future, hinting at promising upside within the Ethereum ecosystem\" Ritchie says. \"[However,] we've adjusted our short-term Ethereum price forecast downward mainly because of potential economic challenges that could lead to a more cautious approach in the overall markets.\"\n\nRyan Grace, head of tastycrypto, has a forecast similar to Ritchie's.\n\n\"Like BTC, Ethereum and broadly crypto as an asset class face macro headwinds that likely limit upside price action in the near-term,\" Grace says. \"With short-term rates at +5%, there's less incentive for capital flows into crypto.\"\n\nPav Hundal, lead market analyst at Swyftx, argues that ETH's price is currently low because it's simply following a pattern we've seen before.\n\n\"Historically, as we approach a Bitcoin halving, Ethereum tends to revisit its price valuations from earlier that year,\" Hundal says. \"This trend aligns with the repeated observation that Bitcoin's dominance (proportion of the total [crypto] market capitalisation) swells as we near the halving event. We can anticipate that there will be a potential shift from altcoins [like ETH] back into Bitcoin in the lead-up to the halving.\"\n\nHow high and low will ETH go in 2023?\n\nThe average peak price our panellists predict ETH will hit by year-end 2023 is US$1,932, with some predicting it will climb as high as US$2,800.\n\nThe average lowest price our panellists predict ETH will hit by year-end 2023 is US$1,352, with some predicting it will fall as low as US$885.\n\n45% of our panellists feel that ETH's price will rise into the $1,751\u2013$2,000 range before the close of 2023, while 69% think the lowest ETH's price will dip is into the $1,251\u2013$1,500 range.\n\n\"While Ethereum (ETH) is still likely to follow where Bitcoin (BTC) leads in terms of overall price trends, its intrinsic value and utility set it apart,\" Nick Ranga, senior cryptocurrency and forex analyst at ForexTraders.com, says. He thinks we'll see ETH at $2,250 before the year is out. \"Due to the wealth of use cases for the Ethereum network and the Ether cryptocurrency, it's future is assured.\"\n\nDamian Chmiel, senior analyst and editor at Finance Magnates, thinks we could see ETH's price as high as $2,000 before the year is out but also as low as $1,000.\n\n\"I wouldn't expect any significant movements in Ethereum for the rest of this year,\" Chmiel says. \"I anticipate it will consolidate between $2,000 and $1,000.\"\n\nDesmond Marshall, MD at Rouge International and Rouge Ventures, believes we could see ETH at $1,200 before the year is out, as he thinks regulatory uncertainty around the asset as well as macroeconomic factors may be holding its price down.\n\n\"The new ETH futures-linked ETFs were a major disappointment to the ETH supporters,\" Marshall says. \"As the regulatory confusion lurks, general retail investors and institutions are weary of jumping on the bandwagon too soon, esp[ecially] with a dwindling job market, employment stats, and a dipping stock market.\"\n\nIs now the time to buy, hold or sell ETH?\n\nAlmost half of our panellists (48%) believe it's a good time to hold ETH, while just over two-fifths of them (41%) believe it's time to buy Ethereum.\n\nOnly 10% think it's time to sell ETH.\n\n\"Ethereum has great intrinsic value,\" Natalja Zaharova, head of operations at FXOpen Pty Ltd, says. \"Its network keeps becoming bigger.\"\n\nPaul Levy, senior lecturer at the University of Brighton, is also bullish on ETH and believes that now is the time to hold the asset.\n\n\"Ethereum is still much talked about, mostly for good reasons,\" Levy says. \"[It's] rooted in iterative innovation, often releasing new features and enhancements that are grounded in decent testing regimes.\"\n\nJeremy Britton, CFO of BostonTrading.co, also believes ETH is a hold, but he's somewhat bearish on ETH for technical reasons.\n\n\"Changing from POW to POS has made ETH less decentralised and less 'crypto',\" Britton says. \"Some of ETH's competitors may cut ETH's market share as people want lower fees and more decentralisation.\"\n\nAlexander Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FXPro, thinks it's time to sell ETH based on his technical analysis.\n\n\"Ethereum has tried to stay afloat above 50- and 200-week MAs,\" Kuptsikevich says. \"It went below them, and this move may continue in the following weeks.\"\n\nIs ETH overpriced, underpriced or priced fairly?\n\nThe vast majority of our panellists feel that ETH is either underpriced or fairly priced.\n\nThat is, 43% feel that ETH is currently underpriced and 40% feel that it's priced fairly.\n\nOnly 17% feel that it's overpriced.\n\n\"Ethereum will become the global settlement layer,\" Martin Froehler, CEO at Morpher, says. \"Ether is the first yield-bearing deflationary asset.\"\n\nTristan Thoma, director of government and payments at AlphaPoint, believes that ETH is priced fairly, pointing out that ETH's price will likely continue to increase as crypto becomes more widely adopted.\n\n\"The price is still likely to increase over time as [the] crypto user base grows globally with more confident compliance structures,\" Thoma says. \"[This should] result in [an] organic price increase.\"\n\nJohn Hawkins, senior lecturer at the University of Canberra, thinks ETH is overpriced, despite the uses of the Ethereum network.\n\n\"Ethereum has more uses, [than] Bitcoin,\" Hawkins says. \"[However,] the crypto mania is dying down; Google Trends show interest declining since 2021.\"\n\nHow will the Ethereum community respond to the \"over staking\" of ETH?\n\n41% of our panellists believe that the Ethereum community will not provide a significant response to the \"over staking\" of ETH.\n\nJust over a quarter of our panellists (26%) think the Ethereum community will propose curbing the influence of liquid staking protocols like Lido, while 22% believe the Ethereum community will respond by suggesting a cap of ETH deposits on the beacon chain.\n\nThe following is commentary from some of our panellists who voted \"Other\" in response to the question in the chart above.\n\nMatiu Rudolph, COO at Layer One X, points out that an Ethereum Improvement Protocol \u2013 EIP 7514 \u2013 \"has been proposed as a short term solution to slow down growth of the active validator set.\"\n\nJosh Fraser, co-founder of Origin Protocol, says \"the Ethereum community will come up with solutions to over staking, such as Origin Ether (OETH). Instead of just earning yield from staking rewards, users can find ways to optimise yield in innovative ways, such as optimizing yield through DeFi and liquid staking.\"\n\nBen Ritchie, managing director of Digital Capital Management Pty Ltd, says \"In our perspective, we strongly advocate for the Ethereum community to prioritise thorough due diligence when selecting staking platforms, particularly those aligned with the principles of decentralisation, such as Rocketpool and similar projects aiming to promote network decentralisation.\"\n\nWhen will the tokenisation of real-world assets hit the mainstream?\n\n41% of our panellists think the tokenisation of real-world assets will go mainstream by 2030, while 31% believe we will see this by 2025.\n\nOnly 10% of our panellists think it will go mainstream by 2024 and 7% believe it will never go mainstream.\n\nJosh Fraser believes we'll see the tokenisation of real-world assets go mainstream by 2030.\n\n\"It's not unlikely that total value locked in NFTs will surpass that of DeFi,\" Fraser says, \"as NFT value will include real estate, IP, luxury goods, and beyond.\"\n\nWill the market cap of ETH flip that of BTC?\n\n43% of our panellists don't see ETH's market capitalisation ever flipping BTC's.\n\n23% think it will happen but not until 2030, while 20% are unsure.\n\nRuadhan O, creator of Seasonal Tokens, believes that Ethereum has more utility than Bitcoin, but that ETH won't flip BTC because ETH will be competing with the native coins of other smart contract platforms.\n\n\"Ethereum remains expensive to use [and] it will lose market share to cheaper alternatives,\" O says. \"Bitcoin isn't useful. Nobody needs a Bitcoin. There's no demand for Bitcoin's utility at a lower price, because there's no utility. This is why Bitcoin isn't losing market share to other proof-of-work coins.\"\n\nJosh Fraser feels differently and believes this will happen by 2030 or later.\n\n\"It's likely ETH will eventually flip Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization,\" Fraser says.\n\nMeet the panel\n\nMethodology\n\nFinder surveyed 31 fintech specialists in October 2023. Panellists are able to answer as many or as few questions as they like, meaning the number of responses received varies by question. 29 panellists gave their price prediction for ETH by year-end 2023, 2025 and 2030. Panellists may own some cryptocurrencies, including ETH. All prices are listed in USD per ETH.\n\nChanges to methodology: In 2021, this research was conducted using the simple mean of all answers supplied to Finder. From 2022, we switched to using the truncated mean, with the top and bottom 10% of responses removed in order to attain a more consistent result. Any 2021 results quoted in this analysis have also been re-calculated using the truncated mean."
