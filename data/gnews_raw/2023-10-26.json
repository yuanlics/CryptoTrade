        "title": "Detection of Ponzi scheme on Ethereum using machine learning algorithms | Scientific Reports - Nature.com",
        "content": "Bernie Madoff perpetrated the largest Ponzi scam, defrauding thousands of investors of billions of dollars4,18,19. The scam\u2019s foundation of the Ponzi scheme is deceit and lies, and it relies on both to deceive innocent investors by encouraging their conviction that they will receive the anticipated rewards20. The operator of the Ponzi scheme makes use of the Ethereum platform to achieve their goal16,21,22. Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that creates a peer-to-peer network for securely executing and verifying application code known as smart contracts. Smart contracts enable participants to transact with one another without the need for a trusted central authority. Nowadays, the speedy growth of blockchain has brought about increasing users to be attracted to the blockchain ecosystem and many implementations have been carried out in different fields, especially in the crypto-currency investment field. Blockchain technology in recent times has shown robust activeness. However, along with the rise in online business, uncountable fraudulent activities, e.g., money laundering, bribery, Ponzi schemes, and others, have been seen as the main threat to online business security23. Hu et al.24 and Wang et al.25, stated that the high rate of communication on social media has prompted many fraudsters to take advantage and send their fraudulent links on social media in order to scam its users.\n\nA Ponzi scheme is an investment scam that involves the payment of unrealistic returns to its early investors from funds invested by new investors (SEC, 2018)26. It is a fraudulent investment activity where the initiator generates returns for older investors through revenue paid by new investors, rather than from legitimate businesses. Ponzi schemes hurt the economy of any country involved and are unacceptable in many countries including Nigeria. This is because in Ponzi schemes, later participants will lose most of their invested money27. He further emphasized that all Ponzi schemes are making large amounts of money off people who want to participate in blockchain technology but do not understand how it operates.\n\nBartoletti et al.5 described Ponzi schemes as financial frauds under the promise of high profits. They stressed that the Federal Government of Nigeria has made an official release, intimating citizens about its non-readiness to support the use of Ethereum and at the same time warning individuals, corporate bodies, and banks not to get involved in Ethereum transactions in which most of the Ponzi schemes operate on. This warning was because of the devastating effects of the various Ponzi schemes in Nigeria which collapsed towards the end of the year 2016 up to the first quarter of 2017 when many Nigerians lost their wealth. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) warns investors to be careful about investment proposals that promise to pay huge amounts of money in a short period of time, which are not backed up by any documentation or quarterly/annual reports28. They equally advised the general public to be careful not to invest based on what they will gain alone, but also consider the loss that might align with it, and not to trust investment offerings posted on social networking sites and chat rooms. They also recommended that investors seek third-party advice, for example, to contact an independent broker or licensed financial adviser before investing.\n\nResearch has shown that some of the common features of fraudulent schemes are mouth-watering returns and no negative impacts1,29. Findings suggest that increased regulatory supervision with tight requirements for compulsory reporting of their activities will help to identify such schemes30. Obamuyi et al.31, emphasized that after the demise of the Mavrodi Mundal Movement (MMM), which crashed in the year 2016/2017 with a total investment loss of 12 billion nairas on participants. She emphasized bitterly the rising cases of Ponzi schemes that are recently experienced by the citizens such as Racksterli introduced by Michael Chidiebere Oti after the Covid-19 pandemic in the year 2020. The platform offers a monthly profit called Racksterli package to its participants.\n\nMany Nigerians fall victim to this scam because they are looking for such an opportunity to make fast money out of hardship after the economic setbacks experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to her findings, the platform claimed that the invested funds would be used to reinvest in businesses like real estate businesses, forex trading, and cryptocurrency businesses, promising them that the realized funds from such businesses would be used to reward them. But the scheme finally collapsed when there were no more new investors, making old investors lose their invested funds. This is an indication that the initiator did not invest the generated funds in any business as promised. But the question is \u201cWhy is Oti Chidiebere the founder of Rocksterli not persecuted\u201d. Perhaps the Oti Chidiebere case is still under investigation and will soon face criminal justice. Another such case is that of the 86fb Ponzi scheme which collapsed in early May 2022. The platform since May 2022 has been having issues paying its participants, deceiving their participants that the problem is from the flutter wave payment gateway. But all these crises experienced in these Ponzi schemes should be a reminder to people who are investing in such unverified Ponzi schemes that promise high returns to investors is very dangerous. Another question is despite the loss and warnings of these Ponzi schemes, why do people still fall victim? The answer is; that Nigerians have shown that they long for high-risk and high-return investments, despite their mode of operation32. Supporting the above answer, Chiluwa et al.1 stated that it is due to a low amount of low-risk savings promised by the initiator of these schemes to its participants to go against inflation. Oyedeji et al.33 stated that many people fall victim to these Schemes because of the following reasons:\n\n1. They prefer investing their money in any investment that will double their invested money within a short period of time than working for it. 2. Due to the problem of poor education and lack of awareness. 3. In order to save long-term wealth in real terms in the financial system.\n\nAccording to him, these Schemes will continue to scam people because of the inability of the monetary policy to deliver real risk-free-return investments, making the risk-return investments strive deeply in society. There is a need for better investor education and an effective detection model for the Security and Exchange Commission to do a better job of monitoring Ponzi schemes1. In line with the above statements, the SEC introduced the whistleblower bounty program.\n\nThe program promised that any citizen who reports fraud to the SEC can get up to 30 percent of the penalties and funds recovered from the fraudster. Again, the law also establishes a single toll-free number as a consumer hotline to report any fraudulent act, such as a Ponzi scheme. It suggests that hedge funds and private equity advisers should register with the SEC, in other to establish greater supervision34. In fact, the rising rate of Ponzi scheme scams is due to the weak attitude of the regulatory body towards identifying and persecuting their perpetrators35. But there is hope as the Ponzi schemes keep increasing; it enforces the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) to press them down. The SEC has announced its readiness to work with the National Orientation Agency (NOA) and other government agencies to stop the operations of Ponzi schemes and other illegal investment platforms in society (SEC, 2022). Unfortunately, just like other crimes such as terrorism and security challenges36, the Ponzi scheme is a rapidly growing crime in society.\n\nMore work achieved on Ponzi scheme detection includes the recent work by Zhang et al.37 utilized machine learning techniques to address the issue of model stealing attacks on a network. Liu et al.38 introduce a unique video self-supervised learning framework called Temporal Contrastive Graph Learning (TCGL), which uses a hybrid graph contrastive learning technique to model both the inter- and intra-snippet temporal dependencies for learning temporal representations. Liu team\u2019s experimental findings show that TCGL outperforms cutting-edge techniques on large-scale action recognition and video retrieval benchmarks in a network. Zhang and Zhou proposed in 2022 that feature pyramid networks (FPN), an essential component of general-purpose object detectors, can greatly improve detection performance for objects of various scales. Bayesian learning is used by Xie et al.39, and Cheng et al.40 in a separate work to permit the evaluation of uncertainty with regard to the made predictions. Due to their exceptional ability to marginalize uncertainty associated with the parameter estimates, they can more effectively utilize relevant prior information and organically add robustness to the model. Furthermore, the training data can be used to learn the hyper-parameters related to the adopted priors.\n\nA dynamic event-triggered security control issue for networked control systems vulnerable to deception attacks was also the subject of certain investigations. To reflect randomly occurring cyber-attacks, Li et al.\u2019s new work41 uses two sets of separate stochastic sequences. The paper by Li et al.42, looked at the H consensus issue for multiagent supply chain systems with changeable topology and ambiguous demand. Zhu et al.43, offer a simple and effective Siamese-oriented Region Proposal Network (Siamese-ORPN) for visual tracking in their paper. The diversity of visual-semantic hierarchies can yield significant benefits in feature extraction and feature fusion. Personal gadgets, which are backed by a variety of smartphone apps, allow consumers to access Internet services in a convenient and ubiquitous manner, according to Li et al.41. The survey summarizes modern technology as well as critical patterns in smartphone app usage behaviors, all of which have major implications for every relevant stakeholder. Li and Sun44 investigated the subject of stock intelligent investment strategies based on the support vector machine parameter optimization technique.\n\nIn the stock market forecast, the evolutionary algorithm parameter optimization under the radial basis kernel function exhibits the best prediction effect, which is the closest to the true value. Cao et al.45 investigated the topic of stock intelligent investing strategy based on the support vector machine parameter optimization technique. The experimental findings suggest that the new method can effectively optimize four model indicators. Yan et al.46 present a new technique to enable the realization of the effect of social co-governance based on the innovative properties of the blockchain such as non-tampering, consensus mechanism, and a smart contract. The consensus outcomes created by credible data uploading, model development, and data derivation via smart contracts can considerably reduce the problem of government administrative oversight involution; and the potential for social co-governance. Blockchain smart contracts have given rise to a slew of intriguing and appealing applications, and they have emerged as a transformative force for the Internet. To ensure network vulnerabilities are detected, the research by Liu et al.47 focuses on Rethinking Smart Contract Fuzzing: Fuzzing with Invocation Ordering and Important Branch Revisiting. In addition to applying blockchain technology to the health care service system, the paper by Li et al.48 concentrates on network vulnerability detection via Efficient Medical Big Data Management with Keyword-Searchable Encryption in the Health chain.\n\nSimilarly, Wang et al.49 focus on Blockchain-Empowered Distributed Multi-Camera Multi-Target Tracking in Edge Computing to ensure the detection of network vulnerabilities. Due to the intricacy and high dynamics of cloud environments, it is difficult to detect anomalies caused by irregular data fluctuations and to create robust models. To address these concerns, Song et al.50, published a paper to identify performance deviations in volatile cloud environments: A robust, explainable, correlative graph neural network-based method for detecting network vulnerabilities. Likewise, a paper by Zenggang et al.51 employs the Social Similarity Routing Algorithm based on Socially Aware Networks in the Big Data Environment to detect network vulnerabilities. Moreover, Han et al.52 use Practical and Robust Federated Learning With Highly Scalable Regression Training to detect network vulnerabilities.\n\nIn addition, Ni et al.53 examined the community partition issue under the IC model in social networks. The goal is to maximize the total influence propagation of a social network by optimizing it within each community in order to detect network vulnerabilities. Li and Liu\u2019s54 focus was on Scheduling uniform machines with restricted assignments in order to detect network vulnerabilities. Again, Li55, proposed efficient algorithms for scheduling tasks of equal length with processing set restrictions on uniform parallel batch machines. Then, Li study\u2019s results extend previous findings for identical machinery. The work of Liu et al.56, introduces Visual Question Answering (VQA), which is an important cross-disciplinary issue in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. It needs a computer to give a natural language answer based on pictures and questions asked about the pictures. So, the study looks at problems related to scams that have to do with network breaches. Current work by Siyu57 investigates how to improve the blending attention mechanism in visual question answering. Therefore, the study addresses network breaches and scam difficulties.\n\nPonzi scheme detection involves the collection of advertisements claiming high returns to participants on social media platforms and capturing their Ethereum addresses for analysis of their transactions for later identification58. Detecting Ponzi schemes on Ethereum is an urgent task, and a big challenge22,59. Previously, many works have been conducted on Ponzi scheme detection60,61. Some of the developed models have a problem with over-fitting, data imbalance, and prediction shift. The paper by Abiodun et al.9 employed feature selection optimization methods for optimal text classification to handle the problem of overfitting. This paper developed a detection model for Ponzi schemes using machine learning algorithms and feature engineering. Feature engineering was used to manipulate the data set in other to solve the problem of an imbalanced dataset, thereby improving the model\u2019s training for better performance and greater accuracy. It uses a large dataset for the models\u2019 training in order to handle prediction shift problems caused by target leakage. This model when deployed will be able to detect Ponzi schemes on time, therefore reducing investors\u2019 risks in Nigeria."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Options Worth $4.5 Billion Set To Expire Today\n\nThe crypto options market is facing a major event today that could lead to increased volatility and shifting prices for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAccording to data from Deribit, over $4.5 billion worth of options contracts in Bitcoin and Ethereum are set to expire at 8:00 UTC on Friday, October 27.\n\nOptions give buyers the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific expiration date. As these options reach their expiration date, holders will have to decide whether to exercise their contracts or let them expire worthless.\n\nThis could lead to a spike in trading volume and volatility around the expiration time as market participants react to whether large options positions are exercised or not. CoinDesk reported the current open interest in contract terms has increased to $20.64, significantly higher than in November 2021 when BTC was around $66,000.\n\nThe impending options expiration comes after a period of positive price movement for top cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin rose from around $26,000 to over $34,000 in recent weeks. This market activity led to increased options trading.\n\nTraders and investors will be closely watching the impact of this historic options expiration as it unfolds today. The $4.5 billion in contracts set to expire represents the scale of the crypto options market today, and how it can drive price action and volatility in underlying assets."

        "title": "Ethereum Faces Critical Test At $1,960 As Massive 33 Million ETH Resistance Emerges - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been making significant strides in recent weeks, riding on the wave of positive developments in the crypto industry.\n\nOver the past seven days, Ether has witnessed a remarkable surge of 16%. However, its primary rival, Bitcoin, has outpaced it with a 20% surge during the same period. Notably, this surge saw Ethereum breaking key resistance at $1,745, sparking optimism among investors and analysts.\n\nDespite these gains, Ethereum\u2019s upward momentum is now at a critical juncture. The crypto community is closely monitoring a formidable resistance level at $1,960, which has raised concerns.\n\nOn Thursday, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez took to Twitter to shed light on this impending challenge, stating, \u201cWhen will Ethereum break out? Well, you may need to wait for $ETH to overcome the huge supply wall at $1,960. Here, 1.14 million addresses bought nearly 33 million ETH, according to data from Into the Block.\u201d\n\nThis said resistance level, often referred to as a \u201cbuy wall,\u201d represents a level where a substantial amount of Ethereum was bought in the past. Investors who bought then may be inclined to sell their Ethereum at this price point, which can act as a significant barrier to further price appreciation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, the close correlation between Ethereum and Bitcoin has been evident, where changes in one frequently impact the other. In another tweet, Martinez pointed out that Bitcoin\u2019s potential 5% correction to $33,000, driven by its formation of an ascending triangle on the hourly chart, a move that could trigger a similar selloff in Ethereum.\n\nAdding to Martinez\u2019s views, crypto analyst \u2018Cryptotony\u2019 also presented a bearish perspective on Ethereum, telling his 346,000 X followers that the cryptocurrency might gain momentum and test the $2,500 resistance zone before entering a distribution phase and possibly decline leading up to the next halving event.\n\nAnother analyst, \u2018Cryptonary,\u2019 emphasized the significance of Ethereum\u2019s ongoing test, stating that it was crucial to determine whether the bulls could break through the resistance at $1,960 or if Ethereum would echo Bitcoin\u2019s overbought signals.\n\nNotably, the pundit\u2019s technical analysis revealed that Ethereum had been oscillating between support at $1,745 and resistance at $1,823-$1,853, with no clear breakout yet. Additionally, he noted that the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) was overbought but not as extended as Bitcoin\u2019s.\n\nThat said, as Ethereum faces a pivotal moment along the $1,960 resistance level, the outcome of this test will determine whether Ethereum can continue its recent bullish trend, plunge or face a period of consolidation.\n\nEther was trading at $1,796 at press time after a 0.32% increase over the past 24 hours."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Surged Higher This Week - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What a week it was for mega-cap cryptocurrencies. Three of the most popular digital assets out there, Bitcoin (BTC 7.29%), Ethereum (ETH 4.41%) and Dogecoin (DOGE 24.05%), each saw impressive gains. As of 12:45 p.m. ET on Friday, these three top-10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization rose 14.7%, 10.4% and 15.4%, respectively, over the past seven days.\n\nIt shouldn't be surprising for many investors to see Bitcoin lead the market higher, as that's par for the course for this space. With roughly half the market cap of the entire crypto sector, the direction Bitcoin moves on a given week typically determines how other digital assets perform.\n\nAccordingly, one might view this week's news that a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) could be hitting the market sooner than thought as the rising tide that's lifting all boats. I certainly think there's something to that.\n\nWith that said, let's dive into what specifically drove these three cryptos higher over the past week and where they may be headed from here.\n\nBitcoin ETF launch dominates the crypto news cycle\n\nIt's been a busy week in the world of crypto, with the Sam Bankman-Fried trial ongoing, various macro-data releases impacting monetary policy decisions released, and a flurry of token-specific news that's been enough to make the heads of many investors in the market spin. Of course, this week's Bitcoin news has dominated the headlines, and for good reason.\n\nEssentially, a number of hints that Blackrock's spot Bitcoin ETF will finally be pushed over the goal line have materialized this week, with this ETF reportedly being listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation database under the ticker IBTC.\n\nThis ticker appears to have been taken down and put back up again, but the fact that we're seeing this ticker listed is apparently enough of a catalyst for crypto bulls to point to. Many believe this could be the moment Bitcoin is officially viewed as 'open for investment' for institutional investors, much in the same way gold ETFs made investing in precious metals much simpler and more attractive for money managers.\n\nOn that note, I've been reading a number of interesting analyses on this topic, with many experts attempting to quantify what a spot Bitcoin ETF could mean for the digital currency in terms of capital inflows into Bitcoin and the broader sector as a whole. Right now, I think most of these reports require a great deal of guesswork, so I'm not sure how much credence to give these. However, I do think it's true that Bitcoin and Ethereum (assuming a spot Ethereum ETF is next, which would be 100% logical) will receive a big boost from a rush of capital into these alternative assets.\n\nOther, more speculative altcoins, such as Dogecoin, may be well positioned to ride a wave of momentum higher. Dogecoin's price action typically takes its cue from the directional forces created by Bitcoin and Ethereum in a given week.\n\nIndeed, the fact that Dogecoin has moved even higher than Bitcoin and Ethereum on broadly bullish market sentiment outlines the value this token provides traders as a higher-beta option in this space. A number of experts continue to point to \"irrational exuberance\" when discussing Dogecoin's price action over the past few days as the key driver of this token. I tend to agree.\n\nWhere are these three tokens headed from here?\n\nIt's clear that there's robust reason for Bitcoin and Ethereum to be up this week. As for the rest of the market, animal spirits appear to remain high, which is a great thing for crypto speculators banking on yet another catalyst-driven bull run over the near term.\n\nThat said, the extent to which this rally can be sustained beyond a few days remains to be seen. Once a spot Bitcoin ETF is launched (and maybe a similar Ethereum option), it's unclear whether the bullish momentum that's driven valuations higher can continue. Indeed, it could be the latest \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" event. We'll see.\n\nIt's my view that now may be a good time to take a cautious view of this space and wait for the dust to settle before stepping in. These three tokens have made nice moves over the past week, for sure. Let's just see whether these gains will be held before jumping in to ride this latest leg higher."

        "content": "Ethereum client developers confirmed on Thursday that the anticipated Dencun upgrade will not be implemented in a network hard fork before the end of 2023.\n\nAlready last month, when the new Hole\u0161ky testnet was successfully launched behind schedule, the consensus was that putting the upgrade through its paces by the time December holidays rolled around was unlikely.\n\nWhen an optimistic scenario was put forward on today\u2019s All Core Developers call, the consensus was evidently with pseudonymous Prysm developer Potuz, who commented, \u201cthere is no way we are forking mainnet in 2023.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to consistent consensus issues arising on the 10 developer networks (devnets) that have been spun up so far to test the upgrade over the past few months, adding that \u201cnot a single one went well.\u201d\n\nRead more: Devnet, testnet, mainnet: Ethereum\u2019s next upgrade progresses \u2014 slowly\n\nEthereum clients are divided into two main camps, one for the execution layer and the other the consensus layer, with the distinction reflected in the name of the upgrade \u2014 consensus teams use cities where Ethereum\u2019s major conference, Devcon, has been held (e.g. Cancun), while execution client developers opt for star names (e.g. Deneb) \u2014 hence \u201cDencun.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to the consensus teams, execution layer client teams reported being in good shape for the upcoming testnets.\n\n\u201cWe are in a pretty good place, a lot of things are also on Master now,\u201d said Geth developer known as Lightclient, referring to the Go Ethereum project\u2019s digital workspace where the code, files, and revision history are stored.\n\nDevnet 10 was launched this week, with plans for the execution clients to transition to a larger test on the Goerli testnet. But Prysm\u2019s Potuz is not on board with that idea.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely not comfortable at all having a full client fork on Goerli,\u201d he said. \u201cI see very large and deep changes still being pushed in the branch,\u201d he added regarding Prysm, the software currently runs 45% of the consensus layer clients.\n\nA smaller Devnet 11 is planned, but it now appears the move to testnets will be put off until after Ethereum\u2019s Devconnect developer conference, which will be held in Istanbul in mid-November.\n\nCelebrating the KZG ceremony\n\nThe Dencun upgrade required a bit of fancy cryptography to ensure the Ethereum scaling improvement, known as Proto-Danksharding, a key feature, remains secure.\n\nThe KZG Ceremony involved multiple participants, each concocting a secret and performing a computation to blend it with preceding contributions. This process results in the formation of a \u201cstructured reference string\u201d (SRS), which is crucial for the KZG Commitments cryptographic scheme, and integral to Proto-Danksharding.\n\nThe final outcome of this chain of contributions is then put into the upgrade. The whole setup remains secure so long as there is at least one honest participant in the ceremony. After months of soliciting contributions, a total of 141,416 makes that all but certain.\n\nCarl Beekhuizen, who coordinated the ceremony for the Ethereum Foundation, invited participants to verify that their contributions are, in fact, included, by visiting ceremony.ethereum.org.\n\nThere, one can input a contributing wallet address, and receive a commemorative POAP NFT.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum developers teased a new timeline for the Dencun mainnet upgrade at the most recent All Core Developers Execution (ACDE) call held on Oct. 26.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the week, precisely on Monday, Oct. 23, developers launched Devnet-10 to test the Cancun/Deneb (Dencun) upgrade. The devnet was set up with 330,000 active validators to force a change in the validator churn limit.\n\nA few bugs were found on the devnet 10 network, one relating to syncing with Prysm and another to deposit handling on Teku, both of which are already being addressed. There were also some issues related to builder-produced blocks.\n\nDuring the most recent ACDE meeting, developers discussed the timing for the introduction of Devnet-11, the Goerli shadow fork, and Dencun activation on Goerli.\n\nDevelopers decided to initiate a shadow fork of the Goerli testnet in addition to Devnet-11. By definition, shadow forks are a kind of developer-focused test network done by forking a live network with a small number of nodes.\n\nFrom all indications, Goerli will not have the Dencun upgrade implemented until late November at the earliest.\n\nGiven that testnet activations for Ethereum updates have typically occurred two weeks apart, following the activation of Dencun on Goerli in late November, two testnet upgrades are projected to take place on Sepolia and Holesky in early and mid-December, respectively.\n\nThis timeline is based on the assumption that no serious issues are discovered between testnet activations. Even the perfect timeline would position Dencun's mainnet activation sometime after the holidays in late December, according to Tim Beiko.\n\nMainnet activation of Dencun likely after holidays: Tim Beiko\n\nIn a tweet, Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko stated, \"Realistically, with Goerli forking late November and testnets usually requiring at least 2 weeks between them (so teams can fix any bugs and put out new releases), mainnet would happen after the holidays.\"\n\nThis means that Goerli would more likely happen in the latter half of November, although no date was agreed to. EL clients felt it would be best to let CL teams set the date given they have more work to do, and so we'll continue that conversation on ACDC next week. \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) October 26, 2023\n\nHe further added: \"Nothing here is set or final, of course, but there's at least a path being drawn towards Mainnet. By next week's ACDC, we'll launch devnet-11 with all clients being setup with mev-boost and try to run a Goerli shadow fork.\""

        "title": "Fireblocks, UniPass Wallet tackle Ethereum ERC-4337 account abstraction vulnerability - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency infrastructure firm Fireblocks has identified and assisted in tackling what it describes as the first account abstraction vulnerability within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAn announcement on Oct. 26 unpacked the discovery of an ERC-4337 account abstraction vulnerability in the smart contract wallet UniPass. The two firms worked together to address the vulnerability, which was reportedly found in hundreds of mainnet wallets during a white hat hacking operation.\n\nAccording to Fireblocks, the vulnerability would allow a potential attacker to carry out a full account takeover of the UniPass Wallet by manipulating Ethereum\u2019s account abstraction process.\n\nAs per Ethereum\u2019s developer documentation on ERC-4337, account abstraction allows for a shift in the way transactions and smart contracts are processed by the blockchain to provide flexibility and efficiency.\n\nRelated: Account abstraction will drive a billion users from Asia to Web3: Consensys exec\n\nConventional Ethereum transactions involve two types of accounts: externally owned accounts (EOAs) and contract accounts. EOAs are controlled by private keys and can initiate transactions, while contract accounts are controlled by the code of a smart contract. When an EOA sends a transaction to a contract account, it triggers the execution of the contract\u2019s code.\n\nAccount abstraction introduces the idea of a meta-transaction or more generalized abstracted accounts. Abstracted accounts are not tied to a specific private key and are able to initiate transactions and interact with smart contracts, just like an EOA.\n\nAs Fireblocks explains, when an ERC-4337-compliant account executes an action, it relies on the Entrypoint contract to ensure that only signed transactions get executed. These accounts typically trust an audited single EntryPoint contract to ensure that it receives permission from the account before executing a command:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that a malicious or buggy entrypoint could, in theory, skip the call to \u201cvalidateUserOp\u201d and just call the execution function directly, as the only restriction it has is that it\u2019s called from the trusted EntryPoint.\u201d\n\nAccording to Fireblocks, the vulnerability allowed an attacker to gain control of UniPass wallets by replacing the trusted EntryPoint of the wallet. Once the account takeover was complete, an attacker would be able to access the wallet and drain its funds.\n\nSeveral hundred users who had the ERC-4337 module activated in their wallets were vulnerable to the attack, which could be performed by any actor on the blockchain. The wallets in question only held small amounts of funds, and the issue has been mitigated at an early stage.\n\nHaving ascertained that the vulnerability could be exploited, Fireblocks\u2019 research team managed to carry out a white hat operation to patch the existing vulnerabilities. This involved actually exploiting the vulnerability:\n\n\u201cWe shared this idea with the UniPass team, who took it upon themselves to implement and run the whitehat operation.\u201d\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin previously outlined challenges in expediting the proliferation of account abstraction functionality, which includes the need for an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) to upgrade EOAs into smart contracts and ensure the protocol works on layer-2 solutions.\n\nMagazine: Ethereum restaking: Blockchain innovation or dangerous house of cards?"

        "content": "Ethereum price found support near $1,750 against the US dollar. ETH is again rising and attempting an upside break above the $1,850 resistance.\n\nEthereum remained well-bid above the $1,750 support zone.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,780 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,795 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could continue to move up if it clears the $1,825 and $1,850 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Could Restart Rally\n\nEthereum started a downside correction below the $1,800 level. ETH tested the $1,750 support where the bulls emerged. A low was formed near $1,756 and the price started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a move above the $1,780 and $1,785 resistance levels. The price was able to climb above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downside correction from the $1,849 swing high to the $1,756 low. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,795 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $1,780 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $1,825 level. It is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downside correction from the $1,849 swing high to the $1,756 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe first major resistance is near the $1,850 zone. A close above the $1,850 resistance could spark another rally. The next key resistance is near $1,880, above which the price could accelerate higher. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $1,950 level. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $2,000.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,825 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,800 level and the trend line region.\n\nThe next key support is $1,750 and the last swing low. The main support is now forming near the $1,740 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. A downside break below the $1,740 support might send the price further lower. In the stated case, Ether could drop toward the $1,700 level. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,660 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,750\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,850\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "On the heels of a tremendous week for the digital asset, more than $4.5 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) options are set to expire today. Indeed, the former has noted an impressive surge in price. Specifically due to the hype surrounding the potential arrival of a Spot Bitcoin ETF in the coming months.\n\nConversely, both assets slipped lower today, with Bitcoin falling below the $34,000 mark and Ethereum falling below $1,800. Still, today, both BTC and ETH options contracts worth billions expire, which may lead to a volatile response from the market overall.\n\nJUST IN: $4,550,000,000 worth of #Bitcoin & Ethereum options expire today. October 27, 2023\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Reaches All-Time High Against the Argentine Peso, Naira, and Lira\n\n$4.5B Worth of BTC and ETH Options Contracts to Expire Today\n\nThe year thus far has certainly been up and down for the digital asset sector. Still, the prevalence of Bitcoin has seemingly increased over the past few months, culminating in a rally that saw the asset surpass $35,000 amid ETF approval hype. Now, an important date regarding both BTC and ETH is fast approaching.\n\nSpecifically, more than $4.5 billion worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum options contracts are set to expire today. Indeed, the expiring contract arrives amid a boom in the options contract market for both assets. CoinDesk reported that national open interest in active Bitcoin and Ethereum options contracts has increased to $20.64, higher than open interest noted in November 2021 when Bitcoin was trading above $66,000.\n\nSource: The Street\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Whale Moves $55 Million ETH to Binance, Will it Sell?\n\nOptions are contracts that allow the purchaser the chance to either buy or sell an asset at a prespecified price before an expiration date. Subsequently, the billions worth of both digital asset contracts are approaching their expiration date today, at 08:00 UTC.\n\nSubsequently, leading exchange Deribit is set to settle the monthly options contracts for both assets. Conversely, how the price responds to the outcome of the expiration will be important to observe. The ETF\u2019s development will also continue to play a critical role in Bitcoin\u2019s price movement."

        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nTill now, in October, Ethereum has seen a surge of more than 20%, revealing the bullish momentum of \u2018Uptober.\u2019 Nonetheless, as traders seek to cash in near the peak of $1,860, ETH\u2019s price faces challenges in climbing higher. Yet, the sentiment seems favorable as various on-chain metrics turn bullish, indicating that ETH is poised for another surge, potentially exceeding a 30% rise by the month\u2019s conclusion.\n\nConfidence Skyrockets Among 61% Profitable Holders\n\nAmid the hype surrounding ETF, a wave of FOMO led many to invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, these investors are now eyeing profitable exit points close to market peaks. This sentiment has put a pause on Ethereum\u2019s surge, particularly near the $1,860 high. Yet, the shift towards favorable on-chain metrics suggests a promising scenario, potentially fading bearish expectations for ETH\u2019s value.\n\nIntoTheBlock\u2019s data indicates that the recent rise in ETH price beyond $1,730 has positioned over 61% of holders in a profitable state. Consequently, the market maintains a healthy sentiment devoid of any substantial sell-off activities from these holders. Additionally, Open Interest is rising, suggesting traders\u2019 willingness to ride the increased volatility. This metric has experienced a $400 million surge in just a few hours, with the current standing at $5.7 billion.\n\nNonetheless, any unfavorable news could trigger a significant long-liquidation as whales recently lost interest following ETH\u2019s inability to break past the $1,860 mark. Indicators point to a $2.5 billion reduction in whale transfers as of yesterday. Furthermore, since the 23rd, the exchange netflow has shifted positively as there\u2019s been a notable surge in deposits onto exchanges compared to withdrawals.\n\nPresently, with a Netflow recorded at 33.2K ETH, it appears exchange reserves are on the rise as holders show a preference for liquidation. This trend could potentially trigger a price pullback under the current unstable conditions.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nEther\u2019s price is currently attempting to meet buyers\u2019 demand as it heads toward breaking above $1,860. However, increasing bearish pressure is creating multiple rejections for the altcoin. As of writing, ETH price trades at $1,784, declining over 1.2% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nAttempts were made to send the rally below $1,760, but a pronounced long wick on the day\u2019s candlestick indicates substantial buying pressure at lower prices. Now, all eyes are on the $1,860 mark, a critical resistance level. If the bulls successfully surpass this level, there\u2019s a chance for the ETH price to jump beyond $2,000.\n\nHowever, the bears might not stand idly by. They\u2019re likely plotting to pull the value down below the $1,760 threshold, aiming to trap overconfident bulls. Should this happen, the price could retreat to the 50-day EMA at $1,705. A move like this would imply a longer consolidation period for the price."

        "content": "On Thursday, October 26, Ethereum client developers confirmed that they won\u2019t be implementing the Dencun upgrade before the year-end. This is because the developer clients for the consensus layer and the execution layer are at odds among themselves. The delay in the developments might put further pressure on the Ethereum price.\n\nDevelopers Cite Consensus Issues\n\nLast month, the Ethereum developers launched the new Hole\u0161ky testnet behind schedule. Also, the general consensus was that thoroughly testing the upgrade by the time the December holidays arrived was highly unlikely.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDuring yesterday\u2019s All Core Developers call the consensus seemed to align with the viewpoint of the pseudonymous Prysm developer, Potuz. He asserted, \u201cThere is no way we are implementing a mainnet fork in 2023.\u201d\n\nHe highlighted the persistent consensus issues that had emerged on the ten developer networks (devnets) established to test the upgrade over the past few months, emphasizing that \u201cnot a single one of them has gone smoothly.\u201d\n\nEthereum clients are divided into two primary categories: those responsible for the execution layer and those managing the consensus layer.\n\nIn contrast to the consensus teams, the execution layer client teams reported that they are well-prepared for the upcoming testnets.\n\n\u201cWe are in a pretty good place, a lot of things are also on Master now,\u201d stated Lightclient, a Geth developer, referring to the main digital workspace for the Go Ethereum project, where code, files, and revision history are stored.\n\nThis week marked the launch of Devnet 10, with plans for the execution clients to transition to a broader test on the Goerli testnet. However, Prysm\u2019s Potuz expressed his reservations about this idea.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely not comfortable at all having a full client fork on Goerli,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI see very significant and profound changes still being implemented in the branch,\u201d he added, referring to Prysm, the software that currently powers 45% of the consensus layer clients.\n\nAbout the Ethereum Dencun Upgrade\n\nTo ensure the security of the Ethereum scaling improvement called Proto-Danksharding, the Dencun upgrade utilizes advanced cryptography techniques.\n\nThe KZG Ceremony involved multiple participants, each contributing a secret and performing computations to merge it with previous inputs. This process leads to the creation of a \u201cstructured reference string\u201d (SRS), a critical component for the KZG Commitments cryptographic scheme, which is integral to Proto-Danksharding.\n\nThe final result of this collaborative effort is integrated into the upgrade. As long as at least one honest participant is involved in the ceremony, the entire setup remains secure. After months of gathering contributions, a total of 141,416 participants ensured a high level of security.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum scaling project Scroll has been doing well and recently clocked more than $15 million in DeFi TVL."

        "content": "In brief Lido Finance is one of the largest staking projects in the industry.\n\nInstead of having to cough up 32 ETH, anyone can start staking with any amount.\n\nUnlike other stakers, Lido keeps users liquid by offering them a Staked ETH token.\n\nYour Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIf you\u2019ve been following Ethereum for the last three years, you\u2019ve also likely heard of Lido Finance.\n\nThe massive liquid staking protocol, which launched shortly after Ethereum began its transition to a proof-of-stake blockchain, now commands the lion\u2019s share of the staking market.\n\nPer an oft-cited Dune dashboard from Hildobby, there are more than 27.8 million\u2013or nearly $50 billion\u2013Ethereum staked total across various cryptocurrency exchanges, individual validators, and decentralized protocols like Lido.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOf that sum, more than 31% is staked with Lido Finance, making it far and away the most popular staking solution on the market.\n\nSource: Hildobby , October 2023.\n\nBut what is liquid staking, Lido Finance, and how does it all work?\n\nKeep reading to find out.\n\nWhat is Lido Finance?\n\nLido Finance goes hand in hand with Ethereum\u2019s full transition to proof-of-stake.\n\nOne of Lido DAO\u2019s business development contributors Marin Tvrdi\u0107 told Decrypt at ETH CC Paris that when Lido launched, it had a perfect market fit.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen Ethereum finally launched its so-called Beacon Chain in December 2020, effectively creating a parallel proof-of-stake network to the proof-of-work version, it also launched the staking feature.\n\nUsers with with 32 Ethereum ready to lock into the protocol were quick to start earning those staking rewards too.\n\nBut these early stakers enjoyed two advantages. The first, of course, being that they had an idle 32 ETH laying around, which at that time ran folks a cool $18,700.\n\nThe second advantage was that they were mad enough to believe that they\u2019d eventually see that money back at some point.\n\nThat\u2019s right. When staking first launched, there was no way to withdraw your holdings until developers executed another upgrade called Shanghai in April 2023.\n\nFor more about Shanghai and what this was such an important upgrade, read our Learn piece on it. In sum, it lets stakers finally withdraw any of their holdings.\n\nPrior to Shanghai, though, Lido Finance emerged to effectively solve both of these problems prior to Shanghai. It let users with less than 32 Ethereum enjoy the benefits of staking Ethereum and it also helped them stay liquid, hence the term liquid staking.\n\nBefore Lido, staking on Ethereum meant you locked up your holdings and that was it, you sat on your hands, raked in the yield.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter Lido launched, though, you could stake your Ethereum with the protocol and then receive something called a liquid staking derivative (LSD), also sometimes called a liquid staking token (LST).\n\nThis token, which in Lido\u2019s case is called Staked Ethereum (stETH), held a 1-to-1 price peg with Ethereum.\n\nAnd as other DeFi projects began to adopt this token as collateral, it meant that stakers could put that stETH back to work elsewhere on Maker to mint more of its decentralized stablecoin DAI or even continue earning extra yield over on lending heavyweight Aave.\n\nHow does Lido Finance work?\n\nThat\u2019s all fine and good, and has played a huge role in Lido\u2019s ballooning market share of late, but how exactly does staking with Lido Finance work under the hood?\n\nImagine Lido as simply another layer between users and the Ethereum blockchain. Instead of users needing to maintain the technical overhead of running a validator, Lido takes care of all of this for users.\n\nThe protocol vets and onboards node operators that take care of all of this for them.\n\nPer Rated, a node-explorer platform, Lido currently has 36 node operators operating more than 273,000 nodes on Ethereum. The operators are relatively well-known and include brands like BridgeTower, ChainSafe, and Figment.\n\nBecoming an operator means following a rather rigorous onboarding process, which tests a validator's technical wit, key management practices, and even their location in the world among other requirements. This added friction is essentially meant to ensure that validators on Lido are high quality.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s because if they get slashed\u2013a type of monetary penalty\u2013due to validator downtime or attempted malicious behavior from the validators, the protocol and its users could also face some losses. This is also in part why Lido has implemented an insurance fund that takes a slice of protocol fees to protect users from hefty slashing penalties.\n\nAnd that's it (in rather broad strokes).\n\nLido Finance lets everyday users participate in Ethereum's staking process, no matter how much ETH they hold."

        "content": "This article was originally published on ETFTrends.com.\n\nThe cryptocurrency universe is growing increasingly enthusiastic regarding the possibility that the SEC will soon approve a spot bitcoin ETF. But market participants shouldn\u2019t take their eyes off ethereum.\n\nEthereum is the digital platform for transactions conducted in ether, the second-largest digital currency behind bitcoin. Alone, that status makes ethereum worth watching, if not investing in. Regarding the latter point, a slew of recently launched U.S.-listed ETFs make that process easier. That group includes the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT).\n\nThe actively listed EFUT \"offers exposure to ether-linked investments through an accessible exchange traded vehicle. The Fund does not invest in ether or other digital assets directly,\u201d according to VanEck. Some interesting signs are pointing to near-term upside for ethereum, potentially signaling that EFUT is a new ETF for risk-tolerant investors to consider.\n\nEthereum Whale Watching\n\nA favorite pastime of some experienced crypto investors is monitoring \u201cwhale\u201d activity in some of the more broadly tracked, liquid digital currencies; namely, bitcoin and ether. In simple terms, whales are sizable owners of these cryptocurrenices, and their buy and sell orders can affect pricing.\n\nEFUT could receive a spark from ether whales because data indicates that cohort of market participants has recently been active.\n\n\u201cIndeed, Ethereum whale transactions, specifically those above $100,000, have skyrocketed to a six-month high, while the supply of ETH on exchanges has hit a record low since its genesis in 2015, according to the data shared by blockchain analytics platform Santiment on October 25,\u201d reported Ana Zirojevic for Finbold.\n\nIncreased activity among large traders could very well be one reason ether is higher by more than 14% over the past week. As Finbold noted, there were nearly 6,050 ethereum trades worth at least $100,000 on Tuesday, representing the biggest day by that metric in six months.\n\nStory continues\n\nPotentially adding to the case for EFUT is that point that the recent uptick in sizable activity in ethereum isn\u2019t a one-off contained to this digital currency. Rather, it\u2019s occurring across other major cryptocurrencies as well.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, Bitcoin (BTC), Cardano (ADA), and Dai (DAI) are witnessing massive increases in whale activity themselves, with Bitcoin recording 14,833 of $100,000+ transactions on October 24, the most since June\u2019s news of the multiple filings for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to the blockchain platform\u2019s analysis,\u201d observed Finbold.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Beyond Basic Beta Channel.\n\nPOPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COM\n\n\n\nREAD MORE AT ETFTRENDS.COM >"

However, for the long-term trend to be considered bullish, one obstacle still needs to be overcome.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Edris\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily timeframe, the price has been steadily ascending since rebounding from the $1,550 support level and the lower boundary of the substantial descending channel.

While the price has managed to break and subsequently retest the $1,750 support level, it is encountering challenges in advancing further.\n\nGiven the current choppiness in PA and the overbought signal indicated by the relative strength index, the possibility of a retracement back to the $1,750 level or even lower cannot be discounted.

Discover SCENE\n\nChainlink\u2019s native token, LINK, has jumped 6% in the past day while Bitcoin and Ethereum prices hold steady.\n\nThe LINK token is changing hands at $11.01 at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko, having recently settled at a market capitalization of $6.1 billion. The token has roughly doubled its market capitalization since June this year. But it\u2019s still a far way off its all-time high of $22 billion\u2014last seen in May 2021.\n\nChainlink has been particularly buoyant since debuting its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) in July, which is aimed at simplifying cross-chain transactions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIts early adopters include Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon, as well as DeFi lending protocols Aave and Synthetix. And in September, Chainlink integrated CCIP into the Coinbase-incubated Ethereum layer-2 network Base.\n\nAt the time of writing, the world\u2019s oldest and largest crypto asset Bitcoin was trading at $33,654.77 and sitting at a market capitalization of $657 billion. Although it\u2019s down 4% from its high of $35,000 on Wednesday and down 1.5% in the past day, the coin is still up 14% from where it was a week ago.\n\nThe main cause of Bitcoin\u2019s soaring price: Mounting hype and certainty among investors that the SEC will soon approve a spot Bitcoin ETF for trading. An exchange-traded fund is publicly traded, like a stock, but tracks the performance of an underlying asset or index rather than just one company.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum is sitting 1.6% below what it was yesterday, trading at $1,757.70 at the time of writing. Goldman Sachs analysts recently said they were optimistic about the network\u2019s Dencun upgrade, even if it is expected to be delayed until 2024.\n\n\u201cDencun's primary impact will be to increase its data availability for layer-2 rollups via proto-danksharding, resulting in a reduction of rollup transaction costs which will be passed on to end users,\u201d the bank wrote in an analysts note this week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLayer-2 rollups allow unprocessed transactions to be batched, sent to another blockchain, like Optimism or Arbitrum, for settlement. Then receipts for the transactions are sent back to Ethereum mainnet. It\u2019s meant to improve the overall scalability of the Ethereum network, which has in the past been prone to congestion and high transaction costs."

Here, according to the analyst's X post, 1.14 million wallets purchased a massive Ethereum amount of almost 33 million coins, according to the screenshot.\n\nWen #Ethereum break out?\n\n\n\nWell, you may need to wait for $ETH to overcome the huge supply wall at $1,960. Here, 1.14 million addresses bought nearly 33 million #ETH, according to @intotheblock. pic.twitter.com/B2noPQbJPc \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) October 26, 2023\n\nNew whales breaking their necks to buy ETH\n\nEarlier this week, several brand new wallets were spotted that acquired a terrific amount of Ethereum. Four new blockchain addresses grabbed 56,070 ETH, paying a cumulative $98.06 million in fiat for it.\n\nAt the start of the week, the Ethereum price pleased the crypto community with a mighty jump of 10.57% to reach the $1,846 level per coin. On the same day, the global flagship crypto, Bitcoin, soared by 11.73%, breaking above the $34,000 level and leading the way up for the rest of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nEthereum price performance\n\nUnlike other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin has so far managed to hold onto that level, supported by the growing hype about the SEC being likely to greenlight the Bitcoin spot ETF pretty soon. Actually, many large figures in the world of finance expect this positive decision to be made this year \u2014 among them founder of SkyBridge Capital Anthony Scaramucci and chief of Galaxy Digital Mike Novogratz.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum shed a bit of its Monday gains and for a few days traded within the $1,780 range. Then, after a 4.29% rise today, the second biggest coin has dropped back to the $1,821 level, where it is changing hands at the time of this writing.\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin ETFs\n\nMeanwhile, it is not only Bitcoin ETFs that have been making news recently. Several Ethereum futures ETFs were also launched in October (\"Uptober\" as the crypto community loves to call it for bullish prospects). However, the trading volume of those products surprisingly was not as high as it was expected to be.\n\nThe funds were launched by such companies as ProShares, VanEck, Bitwise, Valkyrie, Kelly and VolShares on CBOE. Their trading volumes only managed to reach a combined $1.7 million in trading volume during the first several hours of their trading debut.\n\nWhen a Bitcoin futures ETF was launched by ProShares in 2021, its volume surged above $200 million just within the first quarter of an hour since trading began.\n\nNow, several Ethereum spot ETFs are pending as the SEC is considering them, along with Bitcoin spot ETFs. Grayscale filed for the former."

With Bitcoin\u2019s peak in 2017 reaching about $20,000, this marked a 20x gain.\n\nHowever, in the subsequent cycle, where the key zone was around $10,000 and the top was $70,000 in 2021, the gain was 7x.\n\n\u201cThis suggests that BTC has diminishing returns over time, which makes sense considering that this is what happens to every asset as it matures,\u201d Turner said.\n\nBased on this pattern, Turner forecasted a potential 3x gain from Bitcoin\u2019s current key zone to its next peak.\n\nA fresh analysis of the trajectory of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) by a well-known crypto analyst highlighted a trend of diminishing returns for the apex cryptocurrencies.

With Ethereum\u2019s previous cycle support zone at $250 and a 2021 top of around $5,000, there was a 20x gain.\n\nProjecting forward, Turner predicted a 7x gain from Ethereum\u2019s current zone of around $2,500, hinting at a possible price of $15,000, which aligned with several other market predictions.\n\nProduced in association with Benzinga"

        "content": "Goldman Sachs Analysis: Ethereum\u2019s Path to Scalability\n\nEthereum (ETH)\u2018s upcoming Dencun upgrade, expected in the first quarter of 2024, will play a crucial role in the blockchain\u2019s journey towards scalability as a settlement layer.\n\nIn a recent note, Goldman Sachs highlighted the primary impact of the Dencun upgrade, which is increasing data availability for layer-2 rollups through proto-danksharding.\n\nThe bank claimed that this enhancement will result in reduced transaction costs for rollups, ultimately benefiting end users.\n\n\u201cDencun\u2019s primary impact will be to increase its data availability for layer-2 rollups via proto-danksharding, resulting in a reduction of rollup transaction costs which will be passed on to end users.\u201d\n\nIn the context of blockchain technology, a layer 1 network serves as the foundation or underlying infrastructure.\n\nLayer 2 refers to off-chain systems or separate blockchains built on top of layer 1s.\n\nRollups, which are part of layer 2, process transactions on a faster blockchain and then transfer the data back to the parent blockchain at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe proto-danksharding feature of the Dencun upgrade will not only improve data availability for layer-2 rollups but also lay the groundwork for future scalability upgrades, including danksharding.\n\nDanksharding is a methodology that aims to enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability by dividing the network into shards, expanding data storage capacity rather than solely increasing transaction throughput.\n\nDencun to Improve Ethereum\u2019s Scalability\n\n\n\nAccording to the Goldman Sachs report, Dencun will enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability through the implementation of rollups.\n\nAdditionally, it will optimize gas fees, improve network security, and introduce several housekeeping updates aimed at overall network improvement.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has recently admitted that centralization of nodes is one of the network\u2019s biggest challenges, given the fact that the majority of the 5,901 active Ethereum full nodes are run on centralized platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nThe Ethereum mastermind said that he hopes in the future fully verified Ethereum nodes can \u201cliterally\u201d run on a phone.\n\nHe claimed that solving the issue with centralization of full nodes is a \u201cbig piece of the puzzle\u201d to making Ethereum more decentralized.\n\nAs reported, in an effort to maintain the decentralized nature of the ETH network, several prominent liquid staking providers have implemented or are in the process of implementing a self-limit rule.\n\nThe rule ensures that these providers will not own more than 22% of the Ethereum staking market, which could help address concerns over the growing centralization of Ethereum staking.\n\nRocket Pool, StakeWise, Stader Labs, Diva Staking, and Puffer Finance are some of the staking platforms that have already committed to the self-limit, Ethereum core developer Superphiz said in a recent tweet."

        "content": "After months of development and weeks after testnet deployment, the POL upgrade is now live on the Ethereum mainnet. According to an update on October 25, Polygon Labs, the team behind the Ethereum sidechain, Polygon, said the move is a milestone for the project. The team claims the release of POL \u201cpaves the way for the next series of milestones in the Polygon 2.0 roadmap.\u201d\n\nPolygon 2.0 Taking Shape: What\u2019s In Store?\n\nThe Ethereum sidechain continues to build. Despite challenges in the last bear run, which saw MATIC, the platform\u2019s native currency, drop below $1 before crashing to spot levels, the team announced the start of Polygon 2.0, reviving developer activity.\n\nThe primary objective of the upgrade is to make the network more scalable, secure, and user-friendly. To achieve this, Polygon will leverage a new consensus mechanism, proof-of-stake liquidity (POSL), which the developer claims is more efficient.\n\nNotably, the team is developing key differences between this consensus system for Polygon 2.0. For instance, validators must stake their native tokens and liquidity to participate in the network.\n\nThe liquidity provided by participating validators will then be channeled to boost the liquidity of its decentralized exchanges (DEXes). Subsequently, once Polygon 2.0 goes live, exchanges running on the sidechain will be more liquid, meaning users can easily swap tokens in a low-fee, highly scalable environment.\n\nWill MATIC Bulls Break $1?\n\nMoreover, POL will be critical for Polygon 2.0. With the token now being initiated on the Ethereum mainnet, Polygon Labs is jump-starting the process, setting the ball rolling for POL, which the team said will \u201cpower a vast ecosystem of ZK-based layer-2 chains.\u201d\n\nThe team claims POL is a \u201chyperproductive token\u201d primarily designed to power a multichain ecosystem. Besides, the token will be used to settle fees, and holders will participate in governance. At the same time, those who choose to stake it will be paid in the token.\n\nStill, it is not clear whether this update will support MATIC prices in the long run. At present, the $1 psychological level remains elusive.\n\nLooking at price charts, MATIC is already up 30% from October 2023 lows and continues to unwind losses. Moreover, bulls have reversed the dump of October 17 and continue to power higher.\n\nFrom the daily chart, bull bars are banding along the upper BB, a volatility indicator. This suggests that the underlying momentum is building up, favoring optimistic buyers.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

However, the pause in the digital asset market was on the cards after a sizable rally in the last few days. However, analysts see the buying interest to remain in the digital asset market in the next few days.\n\n\n\nBitcoin saw some profit booking as the largest crypto token declined over a per cent but somehow managed to hold about 34,000-levels. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, was also seen in red, marginally lower, and remained below $1,800-level. Majority of the altcoins were trading with cuts.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market seems to be cooling off from its seven-day streak of rally. The crypto fear and greed index is also well within the greed zone with a score of 70/100, signalling bullish sentiments among crypto investors. The broader crypto market has reacted in sync and seems to be cooling off after the rally, said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch Ventures.\n\n\n\n\"In other news, Deutsche Bank and Standard Chartered's SC Ventures are testing UDPN, a system that enables blockchain, stablecoins, and CBDCs to interact like SWIFT in traditional banking. UDPN bridges blockchains, incorporates digital identity standards and facilitates regulated transactions,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring a few exceptions, the majority of top crypto tokens were trading lower on Friday. Polkadot tumbled over 3 per cent, while Toncoin, Polygon, and Chainlink were down 2 per cent each. Among the gainers, Solana and BNB added about a per cent each, while Dogecoin was marginally up.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly lower, falling down to $1.26 trillion-mark, as it declined more than a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes dropped about 7 per cent to $46.88 billion.\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nEthereum (ETH) is currently attempting a rebound after failing to breach the $1,900 resistance yesterday. The asset is witnessing ascending momentum in mid-term due to positive sentiments across the wider market. It may continue to consolidate at $1,800 levels in the short term before testing the upper boundary.\n\n\n\nImage: Chart-ETH\n\n\n\nETH is currently trading well above its 100-day moving average of $1,700 which acts as an immediate support level. Its RSI reading is at 71, cruising in overbought territory. If ETH successfully breaks and holds through the $1,835 barrier, it may retest the $1,900 levels. This may depend on Bitcoin continuing to do well.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $1,700, $1,650\n\nResistance: $1,835, $1,900\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

Ferrari, a name synonymous with sophistication and excellence, has ventured into digital currencies, ratifying Bitcoin and Ethereum as acceptable forms of payment. The Ferrari crypto move signifies a growing acknowledgment of the role of cryptocurrencies in the global economy and raises the question of which digital assets might be next. As Bitcoin Spark continues to gain momentum and acceptance, it might soon find its place on the list of accepted payment methods.\n\nFerrari Crypto\n\nFerrari\u2019s decision is a compelling example of the ongoing evolution of cryptocurrencies, paving the way for future integrations and advancements in the financial landscape. Ferrari, the luxury car manufacturer, will let US customers use cryptocurrency to pay for their cars, with plans to expand this to the Europe clientele. Ferrari crypto news pinpoints that some customers are wealthy crypto investors, and others want to diversify their payment options. They\u2019ll be using BitPay to handle the crypto transactions. Such a rare move reflects Elon Musk\u2019s decision to accept Bitcoins as a means of payment in Tesla. Although Ferrari won\u2019t hold the cryptocurrencies themselves, it is a move signifying widespread crypto adoption.\n\nBitcoin Spark (BTCS)\n\nBitcoin Spark is a project that combines innovation, inclusivity, and sustainability. Its Proof of Process (PoP) mechanism addresses the energy and resource consumption issues often associated with traditional blockchain technologies. Bitcoin Spark aims to distribute ownership across devices by encouraging power renting. This approach enhances network security and resilience against potential attacks while ensuring diversified participation and benefits.\n\nBTCS strives to open the doors to a broader mining audience by offering a user-friendly mining application.

It provides investors with the chance to acquire BTCS tokens at a discounted rate of $3.25 with a 6% bonus and a lucrative return on investment of 326% when the platform fully launches in November. The launch price is expected to be $10. BTCS smart contract audit is good news for investors as its findings depict a stable, secure, transparent, and compliant infrastructure.\n\nBTCS will integrate a smart contract layer into its network, allowing for the expansion of its functionality without transaction congestion. This multi-layer approach sets the stage for the development of diverse applications using different programming languages. This versatility could make BTCS a versatile and dynamic platform in the evolving blockchain landscape.\n\nBTC Price\n\nBitcoin (BTC), despite its famous price volatility, has been the best-performing asset class over the last decade. Launched in 2009, it pioneered the crypto ecosystem. Despite incredible BTC price increases over the years, Bitcoin remains a subject of debate, particularly regarding its environmental impact due to its energy-intensive mining process. Nevertheless, it has gained widespread acceptance as a store of value and investment asset, and its market continues to evolve.\n\nThe current price of Bitcoin is $28,349.58, which represents a decrease of -0.61% in the last 24 hours.

        "content": "Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion.\n\nETH extended its bullish rally past the $1,800 price level.\n\nSupply on exchanges continued to dip, highlighting strong buying pressure.\n\nEthereum [ETH] followed Bitcoin [BTC] in registering significant gains over the past week. ETH\u2019s bullish rally from the $1,550 support level extended its gains to 20% with price trading above the critical $1,800 price level.\n\nRead Ethereum [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThis surpassed the $1,700 target AMBCrypto had predicted on 23 October, based on ETH whales\u2019 accumulation. With the $1,800 price level flipped to support, bulls could be looking to hit another price milestone at $1,900.\n\nETH bulls overwhelmed sellers at multiple price hurdles\n\nAfter bulls rallied from the $1,550 support and flipped the $1,619 resistance, key price hurdles were identified for the bullish rally at $1,680 and $1,745 respectively.\n\nHowever, bulls took out both price hurdles with a single bullish candle on the 12H timeframe. This highlighted the strong buying pressure, as seen by the RSI\u2019s (Relative Strength Index) reading of 74.\n\nFurthermore, the uptick in the OBV (On Balance Volume) accelerated the bullish move past a strong bearish price zone at $1,800. Despite the pullback at the level on 24 October, bulls successfully flipped the level to support with a candle close above it over the past 12 hours.\n\nAs such, bulls can target further gains with the $1,900 price level achievable in the long term, especially if BTC extends its bullish run past $35k.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nSupply on exchanges dipped with long-term holders in profit\n\nA look at the 90d Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio showed that long-term ETH holders (3 months+) were sitting on 9.2% of unrealized profits at the current price. With the potential for more profits, investors could be encouraged to hold their positions.\n\nIn addition, the supply on exchanges continued to decline which hinted at waning selling pressure. This could be an added advantage for bulls in the push for $1,900."

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum has long held a prominent position. However, recent data indicates that Solana (SOL) is increasingly becoming a preferred choice in various global markets, with India being a noteworthy example.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeveral compelling factors underpin Solana's escalating fame on the Indian subcontinent. For one, the cost-effectiveness of Solana transactions stands out. In a nation where value-driven decisions often determine market choices, the frugality associated with Solana is hard to overlook. The relatively low transaction fees offer a refreshing alternative, especially in contrast to the sometimes excessive fees on the Ethereum network.\n\nFurther cementing its position in the Indian ecosystem is Solana's strategic marketing, tailored specifically to resonate with Indian developers. By recognizing the vast talent pool and the potential of Indian developers, Solana has effectively broadened its user base and fostered a sense of community. It is a smart move, considering India's rich IT sector and its knack for innovation in the tech arena.\n\nMoreover, during bullish market cycles, Ethereum's gas fees tend to skyrocket, positioning Solana as an economical alternative. The price point, combined with its robust technical foundation, lends credence to the argument that Solana is not just a fleeting trend but a sustainable force in the crypto realm.\n\nThe accompanying chart reinforces this narrative. From the latter part of 2023, there is a noticeable uptick in Solana's trajectory. The sharp ascent, particularly in the last quarter, indicates not just increased interest but also growing trust in its stability and potential return on investment. While past performance is not always indicative of future results, this consistent growth trajectory suggests that Solana is on a path that many seasoned investors are keen to watch."

        "content": "Considerable declines have rocked the crypto market for the first time since the October rally started, led by Bitcoin price drop from $35,000 resistance, down 2.2% to $33,977. Ethereum price was not spared, as it encountered headwinds, sliding below support/resistance at $1,800 to trade 1.3% lower on the day to $1,773.\n\nThe total market value suffered a 2.1% dip to $1.29 trillion due to altcoins taking a major hit. For instance, Solana is down 6.4% to $31, Chainlink is down 5.2% to $10.53 while Bitcoin Cash dodders at $243 after its market value fell 5.1% in 24 hours.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAre Ethereum Price Dips Profitable?\n\nThe first major dip since the uptrend started early last week has many analysts and investors wondering if dips could turn profitable. Analysts like Rekt Capital believe that dips offer investors opportunities to fill their bags as the bull run continues. Altcoins in particular are expected to have bursts of bullish moments and considerable corrections.\n\nAltcoin Sherpa, a renowned trader and analyst shared a similar sentiment earlier today asking investors \u201cto be cognizant about what the start of a really strong rally looks like.\u201d\n\nAlthough I always try to preach patience, you also need to be cognizant about what the start of a really strong rally looks like. I'm not saying this is anything close to 2021 but it's still good to note what this spark looks like Check $LUNA $AVAX: no pullbacks, just big moves pic.twitter.com/ay5he7KQac \u2014 Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) October 26, 2023\n\nHe added in another post on Twitter (now X) that there was the likelihood of altcoins correcting by between 10-20%. \u201cI think that is still possible and valid,\u201d he added.\n\nI'm still waiting for alts to pull back 10-20%, I think that is still possible and valid. And before anyone says I'm sidelined, I'm always fucking max long and have the majority of my networth in crypto. It's been that way since I went full time and I don't expect it to change. \u2014 Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) October 26, 2023\n\nETH Price Prediction: Is $2,000 Next?\n\nEthereum started the rally by capitalizing on a double-bottom pattern with support roughly at $1,545. Subsequent steps above key moving averages like the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (red), the 100-EMA (blue), and 200-EMA (purple).\n\nThe breakout from the double-bottom pattern targeted a 12.25% move to $1,958 but the pullback on Thursday saw Ethereum price abandon the uptrend at $1,868.\n\nIf support at the double-bottom pattern neckline holds, Ether would be in a position to make a stronger move, possibly above the coveted $2,000 blockade.\n\nThe position of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the overbought region despite Ethereum\u2019s correction from October highs, affirms the bullish outlook. In other words, bulls are likely to resume the uptrend as opposed to bears taking over and pushing for lower prices below $1,700.\n\nAll three moving averages, starting with the 200-day EMA at $1,711, the 100-day EMA at $1,648, and the 21-day EMA at $1,658 would be in line to absorb the selling pressure to give bulls a chance to push for another rebound.\n\nRelated Articles"

The talk majorly centered around the potential approval of Bitcoin spot exchange funds (ETFs), prompted by tale-tale signs of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) warming up to the idea.\n\nThe second-largest cryptocurrency broke out in tandem with BTC, seemingly ending the longstanding downtrend. For the first time since August, Ether traded above $1,800, although it had corrected to trade at $1,781 on Friday from highs around $1,864.

        "content": "Polygon Labs called the launch of the Polygon token a major milestone on the Polygon 2.0 journey toward building the Value Layer of the Internet.\n\nIn an announcement on Wednesday, October 25, Polygon Labs announced the launch of its new Polygon Token, POL, on the Ethereum blockchain network. The POL token\u2019s purpose is to succeed the MATIC token as the next-generation, highly efficient ecosystem for Polygon. This ecosystem encompasses the primary Polygon blockchain, the Polygon zkEVM network, and several supernets.\n\nIn its press release, Polygon Labs said that this is a major milestone in its journey for Polygon 2.0. \u201cToday marks a major milestone on the Polygon 2.0 journey toward building the Value Layer of the Internet. The upgrade to POL has been initiated on the Ethereum mainnet, after months of development, community consultation and a successful testnet launch,\u201d said Polygon Labs.\n\nThe POL token upgrade is now live on Ethereum mainnet. Polygon 2.0, released this summer, is a roadmap for scaling Ethereum to build the Value Layer of the Internet. POL unlocks that future. POL is a next-generation token that can power a vast ecosystem of ZK-based L2 chains.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/gmrsu0ZqLz \u2014 Polygon (Labs) (@0xPolygonLabs) October 25, 2023\n\nBased on blockchain records, the creation of the new token occurred on October 25 at 9:06 am UTC. The official name of the token is the \u201cPolygon Ecosystem Token.\u201d In their announcement, the Polygon team stated that POL will energize an extensive ecosystem of Layer 2 chains based on zero-knowledge technology. This shall happen through the implementation of a \u201cre-staking protocol\u201d that enables token holders to stake POL on multiple chains, facilitating various functions simultaneously.\n\nPolygon Labs\u2019 Push for POL Token\n\nBack in September, Polygon commenced the transition from MATIC to the POL token, initiating this process with the introduction of three Polygon Improvement Proposals (PIPs). PIP-18, in its Phase 0, laid the foundation for an extensive network of interconnected Layer 2 chains driven by zero-knowledge technology, with the aim of scaling Ethereum to the magnitude of the Internet.\n\nThe POL upgrade also looks towards facilitating the forthcoming milestones outlined in the Polygon 2.0 roadmap. This further includes the launch of a new staking layer designed to empower Polygon L2, the upgrade of Polygon PoS to zkRollup. Additionally, it includes the implementation of advanced interoperability and shared liquidity protocol, all harnessed by zero-knowledge technology.\n\nThe team has underscored that, as of now, the POL token is not in use within any Polygon network systems. Stakeholders continue to engage in staking activities through the traditional MATIC token on both Polygon PoS and Polygon zkEVM. Also, the settlement of gas fees on the PoS network shall happen using MATIC. Therefore, there is currently no requirement for users, validators, or application developers to convert their MATIC holdings into POL."

There will also be outreach to ecosystem apps to make the same change in their app UI and documentation,\u201d Arbitrum Foundation said.\n\nClose cooperation with ecosystem apps\n\nAccording to the entity, the team behind Arbitrum will be closely collaborating with ecosystem apps in a bid to ensure \u201ca smooth transition of liquidity from bridged USDC to native USDC over time. There will be no immediate changes to the Arbitrum Bridge, and it will continue to operate normally for bridging USDC to and from Ethereum.\u201d\n\nIn addition to this, as part of the latest project, Circle plans to bring the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol to Arbitrum following the scheduled launch of the native USDC.\n\n\u201cUpon integration into the Arbitrum Bridge, this will enable USDC to move natively to-and-from Ethereum (and other supported chains) in minutes \u2014 no more withdrawal delays,\u201d according to the foundation.\n\nOn March 16, the foundation said in a statement that the day marked \u201cthe launch of The Arbitrum Foundation and DAO Governance for the Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova networks. Arbitrum has become the first EVM rollup technology to achieve the second stage of decentralization.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Arbitrum token will put governance power in the hands of the DAO. 12.75% of the $ARB token supply will be airdropped on March 23,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Bitcoin has surged 14 per cent in the last seven days amid optimism around Bitcoin Exchange-Traded-Fund (ETF). On Tuesday, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap had touched its highest level since May 2022. On Friday, it was trading at $34,134, down from a peak of nearly $35,000, data from CoinMarketCap showed.\n\n\"The ETF anticipation is driving FOMO among investors who are flocking to Bitcoin as its market dominance grows to 2021 levels,\" said Rajagopal Menon, vice president at WazirX. Bitcoin's dominance was 53 per cent on Friday.\n\nSeveral investment firms, including BlackRock and Fidelity Investments, have pending applications for bitcoin ETFs in the US, and speculation on their likely approval was fuelled by BlacRock's iShares ETF listing on the website.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF is expected to make buying and selling Bitcoin easier through the stock market.\n\nA US federal appeals court on Monday also formalised a victory for Grayscale Investments LLC in its bid to create a spot Bitcoin ETF over objections from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. This led to market optimism.\n\n\"Remarkably, crypto as an asset class has been decoupling from other 'risk on' assets like equities, which corrected sharply due to the rising macro and geo-political instability,\" added Parth Chaturvedi, investments lead at CoinSwitch Venture.\n\nOn Friday, the market saw a sell-off but it was majorly due to profit booking. \"The crypto market is showing signs of cooling off after the mega rally in the past few days,\" said Shivam Thukral, chief executive officer (CEO) of BuyUcoin.\n\nWhat to expect?\n\n\"Bitcoin is moving up by taking support from the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA-D). However, it's still facing a challenge at the $35,000 level. If it successfully breaks through, it could reach the $39,000 to $40,000 range, with potential support around $31,000 to $32,000. For Ethereum, the $1,740 level may act as a support, and crossing $1,860 could push it toward $2,000,\" the crypto exchange CoinDCX research team said."

        "content": "The Ethereum Mainnet\u2019s Dencun Upgrade will move the blockchain in the direction of scalable settlement according to a report by Goldman Sachs, cited by CoinDesk.\n\nEnhanced security and lower gas fees\n\nThe Dencun upgrade will enhance the Ethereum Mainnet\u2019s scalability using rollups, improve network security, and optimize gas fees. It is expected to take place in the first quarter of next year.\n\nGoldman Sachs wrote that Dencun\u2019s main impact would be raising data availability for layer-2 rollups via proto-danksharding. This would lead to lower rollup transaction costs, which end users can benefit from.\n\nWhat are rollups?\n\nLayer 1 blockchains are like base layers, or the blockchain\u2019s underlying infrastructure. Layer 2 blockchains, on the other hand, are a set of separate chains or off-chain systems running on top of Layer 1s. The Ethereum Mainnet is the most-used Layer 1 blockchain.\n\nRollups process transactions on a Layer 2 chain, then port the data back to the L1 at a minimal cost.\n\nProto what?\n\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 report adds that proto-danksharding would be used to set the infrastructure for future scalability upgrades as part of the Mainnet\u2019s \u2018Surge\u2019 roadmap, including danksharding.\n\nThe Surge isthe second phase of Ethereum's developmental roadmap following the Merge, during which the Mainnet transitioned to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. During the Surge, it will scale using rollups.\n\nSharding put to good use\n\nDanksharding will enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability. It divides the network into shards, but uses them to make more space for group data instead of increasing throughput. Each shard is a separate chain with its own set of transactions and smart contracts. These shards can be processed in parallel, which can significantly increase a network's capacity and throughput.\n\nThe report emphasizes that Dencun would enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability via rollups, improve network security, optimize gas fees, and execute important housekeeping updates."

In a seed funding round that raised $6 million, the specialist in anonymous transactions received support from several notable entities, such as Robot Ventures, Bankless Ventures, and more. To the surprise of many, Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, reached into his pocket to support the project.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s Affection for Private Accounts\n\nExpanding Ethereum by all means, that\u2019s always been Vitalik Buterin\u2019s approach. He doesn\u2019t hesitate to discuss the potential integration of various features into the blockchain. The idea of providing the benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Ethereum users also appeals to him.\n\nVitalik Buterin invests in Nocturne Labs, which aims to bring private accounts to Ethereum https://t.co/1S58bKiG3Y \u2014 The Block (@TheBlock__) October 25, 2023 Vitalik Buterin doesn\u2019t hesitate to spend millions of dollars for Ethereum development\n\nThe article from The Block addressing this topic mentions a seed funding round that began early in the year, back in January. It took Nocturne Labs seven months to see their efforts rewarded. This resulted in the $6 million fund, with contributions from Bain Capital Crypto, Bankless Ventures, Robot Ventures, Polychain Capital, and Vitalik Buterin.\n\nLuke Tchang, co-founder and CEO of Nocturne, clarified that this funding round included token subscription rights.\n\nWhat Does Nocturne Labs Really Want?\n\nNocturne Labs is an American startup with the ambition to develop a protocol that supports anonymous crypto transactions on Ethereum. With this initiative, Luke Tchang\u2019s team will provide access to \u2018internal\u2019 accounts supported by Nocturne.\n\nHere is an exhaustive list of the advantages provided by Nocturne:\n\nReceive/deposit crypto funds into an anonymous Nocturne account.\n\nZero-knowledge proof (ZK) of the existence of funds.\n\nUse crypto assets to pay, trade, stake, and more.\n\nIn other words, Nocturne will make cryptocurrency asset ownership confidential. Users who are attracted to its services will no longer need to worry about potential data disclosure regarding their cryptocurrency assets, whether they are receiving payments, making purchases, or storing bitcoins (BTC) or ethers (ETH) on the blockchain.\n\nNow we understand why Vitalik Buterin supports Nocturne Labs\u2019 initiative. He, who has caused panic through unexplained transfers of ETH, may be able to conceal his transfer activities by November, when Nocturne\u2019s protocol is set to deploy on the mainnet.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Early Ethereum ($ETH) advisor Steven Nerayoff, who is also a popular member of the $XRP community has recently said that he believes the price of XRP has \u201cno ceiling\u201d and agreed it could surpass the $100 mark.\n\nIn a post shared on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Nerayoff responded to a user asking whether he believes XRP has a \u201cbright future\u201d and could see its price \u201cget above $10 possibly upto $100.,\u201d noting he believes that XRP\u2019s price \u201chas no ceiling if they achieve their objectives.\u201d\n\nPer Nerayoff the question is complex, but he believes that usually a lower XRP price \u201cwould make their offering more attractive,\u201d while fintech firm Ripple \u2013 a major player in the XRP space \u2013 is \u201cclearly the odds on favorite to win in a \u201cnetwork effects\u201d model.\u201d\n\nOnce Ripple achieves that objective, he said, XRP must be used, at which point the cryptocurrency\u2019s price won\u2019t have a ceiling.\n\nI believe XRP has no ceiling if they achieve their objectives. It\u2019s not a simple response but I\u2019ll give a high level take. Usually a lower XRP price would make their offering more attractive. However, @Ripple is clearly the odds on favorite to win in a \u201cnetwork effects\u201d model.\u2026 \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) October 27, 2023\n\nNerayoff went on to add that the US dollar has networks effects and is the global reserve currency, which means there is \u201cclearly no ceiling on the price of the dollar as it gets massively depreciated but the price becomes irrelevant, overshadowed by its required necessity.\u201d\n\nHe added that XRP could take the role of global reserve currency \u201cin part of whole,\u201d and suggested that Ripple may be being \u201cviciously & unfairly targeted\u201d because of its potential.\n\nRecently, a popular cryptocurrency analyst has recently made a daring $XRP price prediction suggesting that the native token of the XRP Ledger could soon see its price surge to a whopping $220, based on a historical pattern that would lead to that level if it was repeated.\n\nFeatured image via Pixabay."

        "content": "While most of the altcoin are seen in green light, Ethereum has not climbed the ladder yet. Last week, while products catering to institutional investors channeled over $55 million in fresh capital into Bitcoin (BTC), bearish products attracted $1.6 million. Meanwhile, altcoins like Binance Coin (BNB) and Cardano (ADA) witnessed more modest inflows, amounting to $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively. However, Ethereum (ETH) products reported outflows of $7.4 million. Persistent concerns revolving around Ethereum prompted a further withdrawal of $7.4 million, making Ethereum the sole altcoin experiencing outflows last week."

        "content": "Ethereum Code Review 2023: Is it Legit, or a Scam? Please note that we are not authorised to provide any investment advice. The content on this page is for information purposes only.\n\nThe value of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate significantly from day to day, or even from hour to hour. If you want to get the most out of your investment, you should buy bitcoin when the price is low and sell it when the price is high. The reality is that this is easier said than done. To forecast the optimal timing to buy or sell cryptocurrencies to optimize your profits can be difficult. A cryptocurrency trading software program can help you with this. These applications make use of algorithms to evaluate the cryptocurrency market and determine the most advantageous time to purchase, sell, or trade cryptocurrencies. Then they take care of the rest, completing the transactions for their customers.\n\nThe Ethereum Code is one of the trading bots that are now on the rise. This robot is designed to help cryptocurrency investors develop precise and informed trading methods. It is also recognized as one of the greatest and most trustworthy trading software on Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-famous cryptocurrency. Traders can use the software to make investments in Ethereum and other legal crypto assets. This Ethereum Code review examines the software\u2019s decentralized trading system as well as its open-source technology in order to gain a better grasp of how it operates. Multiple features of the Ethereum Code platform have been reviewed in this review of the platform. This Ethereum Code review looks into the legitimacy of the robot, as well as providing answers to some often asked issues about Ethereum Code and its implementation.\n\nEthereum Code at a Glance\n\nType Bitcoin Robot Minimum Deposit $250 Win Rate 95% Withdrawal Duration 24 Hours Mobile App No Supported Cryptocurrencies BTC, ETH, LTE, XRP\n\nEthereum Code Review: What is Ethereum Code?\n\nThe Ethereum Code trading platform is one-of-a-kind and technologically advanced software that assists customers with their cryptocurrency investments. It primarily serves the Ethereum trading community, but it also facilitates the trading of other cryptocurrencies with significant market capitalization. Ethereum Code, when used in conjunction with cryptocurrency trading, allows users to get better returns on their investments in Ether, Bitcoin, and other altcoins. It offers several advantages over a traditional cryptocurrency exchange, particularly as a result of its automated trading mechanism.\n\nThis robot offers short-selling of Ethereum equities, which allows you to profit from transactions by selling at a high price and buying at a low price, as opposed to long-selling. When the price of Ethereum falls, the Ethereum Code trading system may allow a trader to profit from the decline in value of the cryptocurrency. It can also result in profits for investors if the market\u2019s values rise and then fall again. Even though it may appear to be a fraud, this feature of the Ethereum Code trading system is actually a legitimate practice among cryptocurrency investors. It directs your investments at a dropping price index to purchase more digital money assets at reduced prices as the price index declines.\n\nIts trading mechanism is built around leveraged auto trading, which is a key component of the Ethereum Code program. It enables brokers or traders to get into the trading business with a small initial investment. Trading Ethereum tokens and expanding your place in the global crypto-investors circle can be accomplished with a small initial investment. Multiple trades can be executed concurrently, and the potential gains of each trade are magnified by the software. It also debunks every investment fraud that may or may not come your way while you\u2019re making a decision.\n\nEthereum Code: Legit or a Scam?\n\nOne of the greatest fear of users when using this robot is its legitimacy. Some have tried to prove that the Ethereum Code trading software is not legit. However, they do not have evidence to back up their allegations. According to our research, this robot seems to be a legit one. One of the factors proving its legitimacy is the features and services rendered by this robot. The Ethereum Code platform indeed analyzes market trends and notifies traders of trading signals, which helps investors to make profitable trades.\n\nAfter digging through tons of reviews online, we found a lot of users on online review platforms such as Trustpedia, dropping feedbacks on how they have benefitted from the platform. Although there are reviews on the Ethereum Code official websites, they seem to be exaggerated as the profits mentioned by users on the external sites are not as much as the ones mentioned on the platforms. So traders should not base their judgment on the reviews found on the site.\n\nEthereum Code Features\n\nRegistration\n\nThe registration process for the Ethereum code is relatively straightforward. Simply input your contact information and create a password is all that is required of you. The process of getting started with bitcoin trading only takes a few minutes.\n\nDeposit\n\nMany trading programs require a huge initial deposit. This is particularly perilous for newcomers who have never previously engaged in bitcoin trading. The minimum deposit for the Ethereum code is a token of $250, which is a minimal amount for any sort of investment.\n\nWithdrawal Feature\n\nWithdrawal requests from some bitcoin trading bots can take up to a week to be processed. To be forced to wait so long for funds to arrive in your bank account may be extremely stressful and upsetting, especially when you\u2019re dealing with a substantial sum of money. We\u2019ve discovered that the withdrawal process for the Ethereum Code is exceptionally fast. After requesting a withdrawal, many consumers see their gains in their bank accounts within 24 hours of submitting their request.\n\nFees\n\nThe charging of registration fees is a typical method for trading bots to collect money from their users. There are no registration fees, broker fees, or any other hidden fees associated with Ethereum Code. The application retains only 1% of the revenues generated by its users in order to meet its operating costs.\n\nRisk level control Feature\n\nThe implications of this are that traders can choose the risk level that is most comfortable for them when trading in the bitcoin market, depending on their experience and competence. Traders should be aware of the amount of money they have available to invest.\n\nReverse trading feature\n\nThis cryptocurrency trading platform assists traders in reducing risk while also maximizing their returns through the use of algorithms. Apart from that, when a trade is on the losing side, this capability can be engaged, allowing the trader to change losing trades into winning trades by utilizing the functionality of reverse trading.\n\nAdvanced Technology\n\nModern technology and a complex algorithm are employed by this cryptocurrency trading bot to ensure that it is efficient in its trading operations. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are used in the analysis of market trends and the transmission of signals. This enables it to process vast amounts of market data at a much faster rate than a human being could ever hope to achieve.\n\nHow to Create Ethereum Code Account\n\nStep 1: Registration\n\nTo begin trading on this platform, the user must first open an account with the company. To open an account, the trader should go to the Ethereum Code trading app\u2019s website and fill out the necessary information. They must enter their personal information, such as their name and email address. Additionally, the app will request additional information from the traders. After submitting all of the required information, which includes the trader\u2019s name, email address, phone number, password, and country, a verification link will be issued to the trader\u2019s mobile phone and email address to confirm their identity. The account will be opened as soon as the confirmation is received, and the trader will be granted access to the members\u2019 area.\n\nStep 2: Demo trading\n\nAfter registering on the Ethereum Code cryptocurrency trading platform, customers are given the option to practice trading with virtual funds. This account has been credited with $1500 in virtual funds, which can be used by traders. Using live bitcoin market conditions can be used to simulate trading without putting one\u2019s money in danger. If a trader wishes to use automated trading robots, they must first select the auto-trading feature from the drop-down menu. The auto trading robots will begin trading cryptocurrency automatically within a few seconds of being programmed.\n\nStep 3: Deposit funds\n\nImmediately upon registration on this trading system, the trader\u2019s account must be funded with a minimum deposit of at least $250. Credit cards, debit cards, bank transfers, cryptocurrency wallets, and other payment methods are all accepted as methods of making the minimum deposit on the site. The traders will be able to participate in live trading on the app when they have deposited their monies. It is necessary for the trader to carefully read and follow the instructions provided on the website before proceeding.\n\nStep 4: Live trading\n\nTo begin using the live trading account, the trader must first make a deposit of at least $250 into the auto trading platform\u2019s bank account. As soon as the money is credited to the trader\u2019s account, the robot will begin trading on their behalf. Within a few seconds, the robot will begin live trading on the market on its own. Furthermore, because the trader is dealing with real money, the trader should keep a close eye on the performance of the bitcoin trading application.\n\nEthereum Code Features\n\nDemo Trading Account\n\nThis bitcoin trading platform provides its customers with the option of practising their trading skills. There is nothing complicated about this account, and it simulates the live trading that takes place on the live platform with real money. It is the most effective method for the trader to become acquainted with the trading platform and its various functionalities. It also assists traders in becoming more familiar with live trading.\n\nAccurate trade signals\n\nThis trading platform gives its customers access to a large number of accurate trading signals, which they can utilize to make informed decisions. Furthermore, according to the user reviews posted on their website, the trading signals generated by the platform have a greater accuracy rate.\n\nFast Withdrawals\n\nWithdrawals are processed quickly, according to our review, and this auto trading platform has an uncomplicated withdrawal method. It is possible to have withdrawals credited to the trader\u2019s bank account.\n\nReportedly High Success Rate\n\nAccording to our Ethereum Code review, it has a respectable success rate when it comes to generating revenue. Multiple individuals who have utilized this trading strategy for internet trading have stated that it has a success record of 95% based on their experience. Other auto trading platforms appear to have a lower success rate than AutoTrader.com. Traders that engage in this type of trading can generate passive revenue.\n\nPros Cons Interface is user-friendly Website interface looks like a copy of others Registration is fast and straightforward Unverified success claims No commission charges or hidden fees No mobile app is available Demo account\n\nWhich Countries is Ethereum Code in?\n\nUK: Ethereum Code is available to traders in the United Kingdom. Sometimes there are certain bonuses and discounts available for traders from the UK\n\nAustralia: Australian citizens are also entitled to the services provided by Ethereum Code. Ethereum Code Australia features easy registration and platform usage.\n\nCanada: Almost all reputable bitcoin robots have their services running in Canada. This is not different with Ethereum Code too. You can easily register on the platform\u2019s official website to get started.\n\nUnited States: Ethereum Code also offers its services to investors from the US, providing them with an excellent user interface, and easy-to-use platform.\n\nHow Much Money Can I Make Using Ethereum Code\n\nAccording to the company, Ethereum Code can yield daily revenues of up to $1500 daily, on average. We are unable to guarantee a certain return because performance is dependent on the amount of capital invested, current market conditions, and risk criteria.\n\nWhen Should I Use a Bitcoin Robot?\n\nTrade-in addition to your full-time job\n\nMany engagements may not enable traders to trade on top of their full-time jobs due to the duties of their full-time occupations. Bots will automate all of the mundane tasks, freeing up people\u2019s time and focus for more vital tasks.\n\nKeeping your emotions in check\n\nTraders are prone to being overly emotional when making trading decisions. They may choose to stay in the market for a longer period than they should, rather than withdrawing promptly in the hopes of generating a profit. This has the potential to cause significant damage to your portfolio, which is why an automated trader is utilized to avoid it. After you\u2019ve chosen your trade techniques, the software will execute them on your behalf with ruthless accuracy.\n\nSimplifying complicated techniques\n\nSome trade skills are difficult to put into practice because they take a long time to develop or are too complicated for the typical individual to comprehend. Even if these trading methods are profitable, implementing them necessitates the use of advanced technologies. Such transactions can be carried out by automated trading algorithms in order to maximize earnings.\n\nIs Ethereum Code Right for me?\n\nYou may make use of speed and automation as one of the most beneficial Ethereum Code features. Ethereum Code is the tool to use if you want to trade with more precision.\n\nWorthy Tips for Beginners to Make Positive Returns Using Bitcoin Robots\n\nBegin with a small budget\n\nStarting with a small amount of money and working your way up is the best advice. Begin with the bare minimum ($250) and gradually increase your investment. Even if you have prior trading experience, it is recommended that you avoid investing large quantities of money immediately soon. It is impossible to predict the future of the markets, and you will never be able to control them no matter who you are or what you do. As a result, start small and gradually increase your dedication over time; there\u2019s no need to rush into anything.\n\nProfits should be set aside for a rainy day\n\nYou should set aside a percentage of your earnings once you start earning money for future usage or investment. You should try to recoup as much of your initial investment as possible while keeping your account cash flow positive at all times. Because every cent in your account is profit, you will eventually reach a position of perfect security with no risk.\n\nLet go of your Ego\n\nMake a point of remaining humble and accepting the fact that no matter what you do, you will never be a successful trader; in fact, no one will ever be a successful trader. Even the most successful traders, regardless of their level of success, make catastrophic mistakes regularly. This rule applies to traders as well. They can only keep their position by winning a few games. Likewise, keep in mind that you are no better than anyone else, and that, in the end, the market selects what is best.\n\nAlways seek to Learn\n\nYou should continue to seek out fresh information and expertise whenever and wherever you get the chance if you have the opportunity. If you want to excel at Bitcoin trading, find many well-known brokers and follow their advice. You can also participate in online communities and forums where you can discuss trade and financial theory with other individuals. Others, such as successful traders who post videos on YouTube and others who tweet daily advice and even describe the trades they made that day, are available to listen to and learn from. Always remember that you should continue to learn new things.\n\nWhy are Bitcoin Robots Profitable?\n\nTrading at any time of day or night\n\nBots can trade at any hour of the day or night. Because the bitcoin market is active 24 hours a day, you may be able to make money even while you sleep. Trading manually can be time-consuming; however, employing an auto-trader reduces this burden by continuously performing all of the heavy liftings.\n\nAccuracy\n\nThis functionality allows it to receive data and process it in order to generate predictions, which users can then choose to act on if they so wish. The user, on his or her part, must supply the appropriate commands and tactics for the bots to follow.\n\nEfficiency\n\nBitcoin robots are profitable because they are incredibly efficient at leveraging exchange tools and methods, such as trailing stops and buying and selling based on crypto signals.\n\nMarket access is available 24/7\n\nAnother element that contributes to trading bots\u2019 profitability is the ability to have access to the cryptocurrency market at any time of day or night, as well as a consistent stream of profits. This is impossible to achieve if you trade cryptocurrency manually.\n\nMarket access is available around the clock\n\nYou can program your bot to perform even more difficult tasks for you, such as arbitrage and accumulation if you have a solid technological background.\n\nPossible Risks when Trading with Ethereum Code\n\nVolatility\n\nPeople who do not put in enough effort to understand how the system works are one of the numerous reasons why they fail at trading. As a result, they make a big number of investments and lose a lot of money, which is just one of the numerous reasons why people fail at trading. Keep in mind that the Bitcoin market is extremely unpredictable and that investing a substantial sum of money without fully understanding the risks entails taking a significant chance of losing your money.\n\nLesser Autonomy\n\nWhen you convert to automated trading, you effectively give up the ability to trade on your own time, at your discretion, and with your judgment. Because of the current status of the bitcoin market, your cryptocurrency charts may respond unexpectedly. As a result, you won\u2019t be able to control your need to enter or exit the market based on current market analysis until at least the middle of the trade. As a result, it\u2019s even more important to ensure that your initial analysis is accurate in light of these new events.\n\nDoes Ethereum Code Have an App?\n\nYes, Ethereum Code has a desktop program that allows you to keep track of your trades and register them. For now, you cannot download a mobile application for Android or iOS devices. But you can access it through browsers on your smartphone.\n\nHas Ethereum Code Been Featured on the Media or Endorsed by a Celebrity?\n\nEthereum Code Reddit Ethereum Code has allegedly been featured on multiple television shows, according to numerous public discussions on Reddit. Because Ethereum Code has not made any such information publicly available, there is no proof to back up their claims. The shows mentioned above are well-known television shows that would have acquired global notice instantly if they had utilized the Ethereum Code platform.\n\nEthereum Code Trustpilot Trustpilot has a huge number of Ethereum Code reviews in a variety of languages. The Ethereum Code App has received a lot of positive feedback on Trustpilot. This is one of the strongest proof of the site\u2019s legitimacy.\n\nEthereum Code Elon Musk Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla Inc. and SpaceX has allegedly endorsed the Ethereum Code software. This, however, is not true. One of the things that blow people away when they hear this false claim is because Elon Musk has invested in cryptocurrency. This is true, but he has never endorsed or invested in any crypto system such as Ethereum Code.\n\nEthereum Code Martin Lewis Martin Lewis of Money Saving Expert has previously sued Facebook for advertisements claiming he has made a fortune from bitcoin investments made through the Ethereum Code exchange. Martin voiced his annoyance with his name and photograph being used without his consent \u201cI don\u2019t do advertisements or anything like that. Any advertisement that uses my image or name is done without my permission.\u201d\n\nEthereum Code Dragons Den Some have peddled rumours about Ethereum Code being featured in the Dragons Den episodes. Truly there were episodes about cryptocurrency, but there was never an episode about any Bitcoin robot especially Ethereum Code.\n\nEthereum Code Review: Our Conclusion\n\nWhen using this platform, the crypto trading algorithm automatically monitors the crypto market, performs technical analysis, and places price quotations and trade orders more quickly than a human trader would. Furthermore, the Ethereum Code trading bot is simple to use and extremely user friendly, allowing the trader to set up the trading session by incorporating their trading strategy and other trading parameters within minutes of downloading and installing the bot. However, we recommend traders be careful in trading with the Ethereum Code app as crypto trading carries risk.\n\nTop 3 Alternative Bitcoin Robots:\n\nALSO READ:\n\n\u2013 Ekrona Cryptocurrency Review\n\n\u2013 Profit Secret App\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin Code Platform\n\nFAQs"
