        "title": "SEC\u2019s Gensler seen telling hedge funds that Ethereum and Litecoin are \u2018not securities\u2019 in 2018 video - Fortune",
        "content": "A new video has surfaced showing future Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gensler telling an audience of institutional investors that four cryptocurrencies are not securities, and that 75% of the overall crypto market at the time was outside that legal category.\n\nThe video is from a crypto-themed institutional investor event hosted by Bloomberg and Fidelity in 2018, and it shows Gensler expressing sentiments that appear to contradict his more recent suggestions that all cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin are securities. You can watch the relevant excerpt above.\n\n\u201cOver 70% of the crypto market is Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash. Why did I name those four? They\u2019re not securities,\u201d Gensler tells the audience. \u201cThree quarters of this [digital asset] market are not securities.\u201d\n\nThe remarks came at a time when crypto was in the midst of a bull market, and precede Gensler\u2019s appointment as SEC chair by a little over two years. For the Bloomberg event, Gensler is identified as a senior MIT lecturer and a former chair of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission.\n\nOther videos have surfaced from Gensler\u2019s time at MIT that show him stating Ethereum is not a security. This video is arguably more significant since it shows the now-chair of the SEC providing guidance to hedge funds and other investors about the legal status of the crypto market.\n\nCrypto lawyer Preston Byrne has previously noted that Gensler\u2019s 2018 comments came in a personal capacity and not as a government official, and so are not material when it comes to the SEC\u2019s current legal position. Nonetheless, the comments likely will anger the crypto industry and many cryptocurrency owners, who claim Gensler failed to provide guidance about the legality of specific tokens before embarking on what many have called a \u201cregulation by enforcement strategy.\u201d\n\nThe most recent phase of Gensler\u2019s crackdown came last week when the SEC sued top crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase for violating securities laws. In its legal complaints, the agency for the first time identified 13 cryptocurrencies\u2014including major ones like Solana, Cardano, and Polygon\u2014as securities for the first time.\n\nWhile Gensler has recently refused to say that Ethereum is not a security, the SEC has so far been silent about the other non-Bitcoin currencies cited in the Bloomberg speech. One of them, Litecoin, is an early competitor to Bitcoin that launched in 2011, while Bitcoin Cash was a so-called fork of the original cryptocurrency that garnered flash-in-the-pan success upon launching in 2017 but has since declined in relevance.\n\nGensler\u2019s comments about the four cryptocurrencies not being securities came as part of a much broader speech during which he described crypto market dynamics and warned that many recently launched blockchain projects were outright scams. The now-SEC chair was introduced at the event as \u201cmy friend Gary Gensler\u201d by Mike Novogratz, a hedge fund billionaire who runs the crypto fund Galaxy.\n\nIn a separate portion of the video (shown here), Gensler appears to endorse crypto lending, comparing the practice to the more familiar one of lending shares.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten comfortable with [stock lending] since someone else got comfortable with it decades in the past,\u201d says Gensler. \u201cBut if you run a hedge fund and want to do what I\u2019ll call crypto sec lending, how does that work? I think firms like Mike\u2019s are going to figure this out.\u201d\n\nGensler\u2019s positions on crypto lending appears to have changed since his tenure at the SEC, where he has recently declared crypto lending to be illegal.\n\nThe SEC declined to comment on the record about any potential conflicts between Gensler\u2019s 2018 remarks and the agency\u2019s current legal stance."

        "content": "Ethereum price is moving lower from the $1,780 resistance against the US Dollar. ETH could decline heavily if there is a clear move below the $1,720 support.\n\nEthereum is struggling to clear the $1,780 and $1,800 resistance levels.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,800 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,760 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could decline heavily if there is a close below $1,720.\n\nEthereum Price Remains At Risk\n\nEthereum\u2019s price attempted a fresh increase above the $1,775 and $1,780 resistance levels. ETH failed to gain bullish momentum above the $1,780 resistance, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nEarlier, the price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $1,854 swing high to the $1,718 low. The price is now back below $1,750 and showing bearish signs. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,760 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEther is clearly struggling to clear $1,800 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Immediate resistance is near the $1,755 zone and the trend line. The next major resistance is near the $1,780 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $1,854 swing high to the $1,718 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA proper move above the $1,775 and $1,780 resistance levels might send Ether toward $1,850. The next resistance sits near $1,880, above which Ethereum could rise toward the key barrier at $1,920. Any more gains above the $1,920 resistance zone might send the price toward the $2,000 resistance.\n\nMore Downsides in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,755 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,720 level.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,700 level. If there is a break and close below the $1,700 support, the price could decline toward the $1,640 support. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,600 level or even $1,550 in the coming sessions.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,720\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,780\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin: Ethereum 'fails' without these 3 important 'transitions' - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin believes the success of Ethereum will come down to three major technical \u201ctransitions\u201d that need to happen almost simultaneously \u2014 layer-2 scaling, wallet security and privacy-preserving features.\n\nIn a June 9 post via his personal blog, Buterin explained that the Ethereum blockchain outright \u201cfails\u201d without sufficient scaling infrastructure to make transactions cheap.\n\n\u201cEthereum fails because each transaction costs $3.75 ($82.48 if we have another bull run), and every product aiming for the mass market inevitably forgets about the chain and adopts centralized workarounds for everything,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother point of failure, according to Buterin, relates to smart contract wallets.\n\nHe explained that a move to smart contract wallets has caused some issues, because of complexities from the user experience side of things when users take control of multiple addresses at once.\n\nEthereum needs to improve its layer-2 scalability, wallet security and privacy features, according to Buterin. Source: Vitalik Buterin\u2019s website\n\nIn addition to wallets securing crypto assets, Buterin explained that wallets would need to secure data in order to truly transition into an on-chain world with zero-knowledge rollups:\n\n\u201cIn a ZK world, however, this is no longer true: the wallet is not just protecting authentication credentials, it's also holding your data.\u201d\n\nThe last of Buterin\u2019s three transitions \u2014 privacy \u2014 will need to come in the form of improved identity, reputation and social recovery systems.\n\n\u201cWithout the third, Ethereum fails because having all transactions (and POAPs, etc) available publicly for literally anyone to see is far too high a privacy sacrifice for many users, and everyone moves onto centralized solutions that at least somewhat hide your data,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder suggested that stealth addresses could be implemented to resolve this issue.\n\nRelated: Vitalik Buterin reveals 3 \u2018huge\u2019 opportunities for crypto in 2023\n\nButerin said that achieving all three will be \u201cchallenging\u201d because of the \u201cintense coordination\u201d involved between them.\n\nHe admitted that each of the three transitions \u201cweaken\u201d the \u201cone user \u2014 one address\u201d model, which, in turn, may complicate the way transactions are executed.\n\n\u201cIf you want to pay someone, how will you get the information on how to pay them?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf users have many assets stored in different places across different chains, how do they do key changes and social recovery?\" he added.\n\nButerin concluded by stressing the need to build infrastructure that ultimately improvers user experience:\n\n\u201cDespite the challenges, achieving scalability, wallet security, and privacy for regular users is crucial for Ethereum's future. It is not just about technical feasibility but about actual accessibility for regular users. We need to rise to meet this challenge.\u201d\n\nMagazine: ZK-rollups are \u2018the endgame\u2019 for scaling blockchains, Polygon Miden founder"

Hence such third parties ask to proceed with a chain swap.\"\n\nChain swap refers to the process of transferring tokens from one blockchain network to another. The process allows users to bridge assets across multiple chains.\n\nAfter the publication of this story, Binance tweeted that it will swap 750 million USDT on Tron for USDT on Ethereum directly with Tether later today \u201cto ensure stablecoin liquidity across all chains for our users.\u201d In a separate tweet, Tether confirmed the upcoming chain swap with a third party without naming Binance, but Ardoino confirmed the party is Binance.\n\nTether's second billion-dollar USDT mint in recent weeks\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThis is Tether's second billion-dollar USDT mint in less than two months.

        "content": "Mon 12 Jun 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by La R\u00e9daction C.\n\nFollowing the success of Shapella, Vitalik Buterin has announced the arrival of other projects that will complement The Merge. After several months of behind-the-scenes work, the co-founder of one of the world\u2019s most popular blockchains is unveiling a new roadmap in which he outlines three major technical transitions. Details in this article.\n\nChanges on the horizon for Ethereum\n\nConcerned about the future of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin recently warned against excessive use of layer 1. Now that the alert has been made known to the public, the network\u2019s strongman has announced major technical changes via his blog.\n\nOpening words from Vitalik Buterin. \u2013 Source: https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/06/09/three_transitions.html\n\n\u201cAs Ethereum transitions from a young experimental technology into a mature tech stack that is capable of actually bringing an open, global and permissionless experience to average users, there are three major technical transitions that the stack needs to undergo, roughly simultaneously:\n\nThe L2 scaling transition \u2013 everyone moving to rollups\n\n\u2013 everyone moving to rollups The wallet security transition \u2013 everyone moving to smart contract wallets\n\n\u2013 everyone moving to smart contract wallets The privacy transition \u2013 making sure privacy-preserving funds transfers are available, and making sure all of the other gadgets that are being developed (social recovery, identity, reputation) are privacy-preserving\u201d\n\nLayer 2 scaling\n\nThis would notably allow for a reduction in transaction fees during bullish cycles, according to V. Buterin. We want to emphasize that Ethereum is increasingly being overlooked by users due to its astronomical gas fees.\n\n\u201cWithout the first, Ethereum fails because each transaction costs $3.75 ($82.48 if we have another bull run), and every product aiming for the mass market inevitably forgets about the chain and adopts centralized workarounds for everything,\u201d he points out.\n\nWallet security\n\nWith a significant increase in cryptocurrency platform attacks, including a recent incident with the Atomic wallet, security has become a priority for developers like Buterin. Thus, in his opinion, Ethereum will need to design secure wallets to attract many users.\n\nThe best alternative for Vitalik Buterin lies in smart contract wallets. These would be able to support complex functions such as social recovery.\n\nPrivacy protection\n\nVitalik Buterin wants to make privacy protection the third necessary technical transition for Ethereum. As such, he has proposed the implementation of stealth address protocols. This will allow users to have more convenience.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that Coinbase faced a lawsuit last May, alleging a violation of privacy laws by a user.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has recently broken below the 100-day moving average, resulting in a decline toward the significant support region of around $1.7K.\n\nIt is crucial to closely monitor the price action in this important area as it may provide a clear indication of the next movement of ETH\u2019s price.\n\nEthereum Price Technical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nEthereum had been struggling to breach the 100-day moving average for a prolonged period but has finally broken below it on June 10th, indicating a bearish outlook for the mid term.\n\nHowever, the ETH price has reached the substantial support region at $1.7K, where the bearish momentum has halted, leading to a stable price action at this level. If selling pressure persists and causes a further decline below this support region, the bears\u2019 next target would be the 200-day moving average at $1625.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, the price has finally dropped below the lower trendline of the channel and reached the major support zone at $1.7K. It holds significant psychological value as it has been supporting the price since March 2023.\n\nConsidering that the RSI indicator is currently around the oversold section, there is a possibility of a price retracement towards the lower trendline of the channel before initiating the next move. However, if the $1.7K level successfully prevents further decline and triggers a bullish rally, the next target for Ethereum would be the $2K resistance region.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThis graph illustrates the Ethereum Exchange Reserves metric for Binance and Coinbase exchanges in relation to Ethereum\u2019s price. Recently, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against both Binance and Coinbase, which has generated significant fear within the market.\n\nIn response to this development, investors have withdrawn approximately $1.43 billion from the Binance crypto exchange and its U.S. affiliate following the regulatory actions. Binance experienced net outflows of $1.34 billion worth of crypto tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, while its U.S. affiliate, Binance.US, recorded net outflows of $70.8 million. Coinbase has also witnessed substantial outflows due to the prevailing uncertainty among market participants.\n\nConsequently, the ETH Exchange Reserve metric has undergone a notable decrease for both exchanges, underscoring the fear and uncertainty triggered by the conflict involving the SEC, Binance, and Coinbase."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is witnessing an uptick in adoption rate despite the latest market-wide slump. Its non-zero addresses recently hit an all-time high value amid a 7-day decline of 8.25% in the asset\u2019s price.\n\nThe number of non-zero addresses holding ETH climbed to 100.82 million today, marking the highest value ever witnessed.\n\nInformation from the Glassnode chart reveals a consistent upward trajectory in non-zero ETH addresses, with only a minor decline observed in late 2021. This sustained growth persisted through the market challenges experienced in 2022, especially the turmoil caused by the Terra and FTX implosions.\n\nConsequently, non-zero addresses have recently surged to their highest value. This metric underscores the growing interest in ethereum and crypto assets, as more market participants enter the scene despite the occasional turbulence.\n\nYou might also like: Bitcoin wallets holding at least 1 BTC reach 1m mark\n\nNon-zero ETH addresses are addresses holding a positive balance of ETH. In other words, they have a value of the asset greater than zero. This metric is often used to measure the level of activity and engagement within the Ethereum network, as it indicates the number of addresses currently holding some form of value.\n\nAn increase may indicate growing interest from individuals or businesses, more widespread token ownership, growing decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contract usage, or the accumulation of assets by long-term holders. All these factors contribute to the overall health and vitality of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAs reported by crypto.news last week, the cumulative balance of the ten largest ethereum addresses recently hit an all-time high of 31.8 million ETH valued at $59.47 billion at the time of the report. This was due to an impressive accumulation campaign observed among these addresses, Santiment revealed.\n\nThe increase in these metrics coincides with a period of decline for ETH, prompted by the downturn in the market. Notably, on June 10, ETH experienced a decrease of 4.83% following the SEC\u2019s complaints against Binance and Coinbase. This decline represented the most significant intra-day loss for the asset in over a month.\n\nETH price \u2013 June 12 | Source: Trading View\n\nETH registered a meager 0.07% gain on June 11 to invalidate what would have been a 3-day losing streak. However, the asset started today on a bearish note. ETH is 0.59% down today, currently changing hands at $1,742 at the time of writing.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has identified three key technical \u201ctransitions\u201d that he believes are essential for Ethereum\u2019s success. In a recent blog post, Buterin emphasized the importance of layer-2 scaling, Smart contract wallet security, and privacy-preserving features.\n\nButerin pointed out that without sufficient scaling infrastructure, the Ethereum blockchain faces significant challenges. He highlighted the high transaction costs, which currently stand at $3.75 per transaction, potentially reaching $82.48 during a bull run. To avoid centralized workarounds, Buterin stressed the need for affordable transactions to enable mass adoption.\n\nSmart contract wallets are a point of concern for Buterin, as user experience complexities arise when users manage multiple addresses simultaneously. This aspect needs improvement to ensure a seamless and user-friendly on-chain experience.\n\nFurthermore, Buterin emphasized the need for enhanced wallet security and privacy features. He argued that in an on-chain world leveraging zero-knowledge rollups, wallets must not only protect authentication credentials but also safeguard user data. Enhancing identity, reputation, and social recovery systems is crucial to address privacy concerns.\n\nTo address privacy issues, Buterin suggested the implementation of stealth addresses, offering a potential solution for protecting user data.\n\nHowever, Buterin acknowledged the challenges in coordinating these three transitions, as they potentially weaken the traditional \u201cone user \u2014 one address\u201d model and may complicate transaction execution. Questions arise regarding how users will obtain payment information or manage different assets stored across various chains.\n\nButerin concluded by emphasizing the importance of building infrastructure that improves the overall user experience. Achieving scalability, wallet security, and privacy for regular users is vital for Ethereum\u2019s future success. Meeting this challenge goes beyond technical feasibility; it is about ensuring accessibility and usability for a broader user base."

US regulators are on a warpath, going after major crypto exchanges and declaring a handful of major altcoins securities \u2013 a scarlet letter in crypto terms.\n\n\n\nBitcoin continued to remain under pressure as the largest crypto token was mildly up after the weekend jitters and traded below the $26,000 mark. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, was down in red and dropped another per cent to remain below $1,750 levels. Action in the altcoin was majorly mixed.\n\n\n\nCrypto markets observed brisk selling pressure over the weekend amid the ongoing lawsuits by the SEC against Binance and Coinbase, which has led to a mass exodus of deposits in these exchanges, said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures.\n\n\n\n\"Amidst regulatory challenges and liquidity issues in the market, Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown some resilience. Bitcoin is trading around $25,700, continuing to hold its $25,000 psychological support as its dominance is nearing the 50 per cent mark for the first time since April 2021,\" he said.\n\n\n\nTop crypto tokens were trading mixed on Monday, but the move was majorly seen on the downside. Shiba Inu and BNB were down 5 per cent, each, while Solana declined more than 4 per cent. Avalanche shed 3 per cent. Among the gainers, Polygon gained 3 per cent, while Cardano and XRP were up over a per cent, each, after weekend dents.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading lower, falling to the $1.05 trillion mark as it shed less than half-a-per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes almost halved, falling more than 49 per cent to $26.6 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nDogecoin (DOGE)is currently stressed after dropping below the $0.07 resistance level. It has declined by 15% on the weekly and is now trading near $0.06. DOGE has to break the 14-day moving average at $0.068, which could be a good sign for its mid-term trend and could signal a potential trend reversal.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, the 14-day RSI (28.8 per cent) indicates an oversold sentiment. These values suggest a potential consolidation in the near term if the price continues to hold the $0.055 support level. If DOGE is unable to break through the $0.07 barrier, the price may continue to fall. Especially if altcoins continue to bleed post-US SEC action.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $0.055, $0.050\n\nResistance: $0.070, $0.080\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "What Is ERC721-C?\n\nEthereum Request for Comment 721-C (ERC721-C) is an augmentation of the ERC721 non-fungible token (NFT) standard on Ethereum. It aims to give NFT creators increased control and customizability over their NFT collections and how royalties are treated for them.\n\nERC721-C is opt-in. If a new or existing NFT collection decides to implement it, individual NFT holders can decide whether or not to adopt it. Details on how the opt-in process works can be found here.\n\nHow To Buy ERC721-C Tokens?\n\nLimit Break, the organization spearheading ERC721-C development, has whitelisted the addresses of several NFT marketplaces (e.g., OpenSea, X2Y2, Rarible), which could theoretically support ERC721-C tokens.\n\nOther marketplaces whose addresses have also been whitelisted can be found here. The curated whitelist is maintained solely by Limit Break and is controlled by a company multi-sig wallet.\n\nAccording to Limit Break, NFT marketplaces will need to explicitly integrate the new token standard in order for the new royalty features to go live. So, while ERC721-C tokens are currently supported on certain NFT marketplaces, it will likely be some time before new royalty capabilities are added.\n\nThe Limit Break team has stated that if top marketplaces do not support the new token standard, it will launch its own NFT marketplace that does.\n\nloading 1658115962258829316\n\nWhat Blockchains Support ERC721-C Tokens?\n\nLimit Break\u2019s official \u201cCreator Token Transfer\u201d library, which houses all documentation, is currently live on Ethereum and Polygon. It is also supported on Ethereum\u2019s Sepolia Testnet and Polygon\u2019s Mumbai Testnet.\n\nWhat Are NFT Royalties?\n\nNFT Royalties are fees paid by NFT purchases to creators when subsequent trades (i.e., all trades of NFTs after they are minted) of NFTs occur. In other words, royalties allow NFT creators to generate recurring revenue following their launch of an NFT collection. The more valuable an NFT creator\u2019s collection becomes and the more the collection is traded, the more royalty revenue the creator generates.\n\nIn their current state under ERC721, royalties are not fully enforceable on-chain for Ethereum NFTs. Accordingly, NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea and Blur wield significant influence over enforcing royalty payments.\n\nAn Example\n\nFor example, while NFT creators can request different levels of royalties, Blur currently only enforces a 0.5% minimum creator royalty on its platform. These low royalties encourage trading activity on the platform by driving down costs for users.\n\nHowever, these low royalties are detrimental to NFT creators as they reduce their earnings and could be a net-negative for the NFT ecosystem as they reduce incentives for creators to remain engaged in their projects over the long term.\n\nBlur is also using its control over royalties on its platform to compete with rival NFT marketplace OpenSea. So long as NFT creators on Blur block the trading of their NFT collections on OpenSea, they will receive any royalty fee they request \u2013 not just the 0.5% minimum.\n\nWhat Are Programmable Royalties?\n\nWith ERC721-C, royalty logic can be directly incorporated into Ethereum smart contract code. This gives NFT creators direct control over royalty settings and could reduce the influence that marketplaces currently wield over them.\n\nExamples of how NFT creators can experiment with the programmability of ERC721-C include:\n\nShared Royalties: Rather than NFT creators earning all NFT royalties, they could be split between NFT creators and holders to reward early adopters.\n\nRather than NFT creators earning all NFT royalties, they could be split between NFT creators and holders to reward early adopters. Minter-Only Royalties: NFT minters could be the sole earners of royalties \u2013 not creators.\n\nNFT minters could be the sole earners of royalties \u2013 not creators. Contingent Royalties : Different criteria could be applied to determine whether or not royalties would be paid out on certain NFT trades. For example, one could configure an ERC721-C contract such that royalties would only be paid out on trades where the secondary sale price is higher than the original mint price.\n\n: Different criteria could be applied to determine whether or not royalties would be paid out on certain NFT trades. For example, one could configure an ERC721-C contract such that royalties would only be paid out on trades where the secondary sale price is higher than the original mint price. Transferrable Royalties: NFT creators could issue their holders a separate NFT, which grants holders the rights to royalty income. For example, when one mints \u201cNFT X,\u201d they would also be issued \u201cNFT Y,\u201d which is entitled to all of the royalties generated by \u201cNFT X.\u201d\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow Is ERC721 Different From ERC721-C? With ERC721 NFTs, creator royalties exist as a \u201csocial contract\u201d rather than being enforceable on-chain. With ERC721-C, creators will have increased control over their NFT design and can make royalties enforceable on-chain. Who Created ERC721-C? Limit Break, a free-to-play gaming development studio, introduced the concept of Creator Tokens in January 2021. Version 1.1 of the ERC721-C standard, which operationalized many of the concepts of Creator Tokens, went live in May 2023.\n\nData Analyst Andrew Cahill Andrew previously was a Research Director at The Block; a crypto media and research company.

        "content": "Despite the carnage and chaos all across the crypto market due to recent US SEC-related enforcement actions, Ethereum has just given a bullish buy signal.\n\nOn weekly timeframes, ETHUSD has formed a golden cross, but will it be enough to give the asset class a glimmer of hope amidst such darkness? Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nEthereum Price Golden Cross Buy Signal Forms On Weekly Chart\n\nEthereum prices are down roughly 20% off 2023 highs, but still down more than 60% from the record peak back in 2021. Hope for a recovery across the crypto market dwindled last week, when the United States SEC launched enforcement actions against an already weakened industry.\n\nOther coins have plummeted by 50% or more in just days, while Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown resilience as the two top cryptocurrencies by market cap. ETHUSD has done so well in the recently bearish environment, in fact, is has formed a golden cross of the 50-week moving average and the 200-week moving average.\n\nThe golden cross comes almost immediately after a death cross, nullifying a long-term sell signal with a buy signal. When using a two-moving average system, a buy signal occurs when the shorter timeframe crosses the longer timeframe span. This is called a golden cross, while the opposite crossover is called a death cross.\n\nA golden cross appears | ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nWill The Moving Averages Save Crypto From Further Collapse?\n\nWhen using moving averages as a trading signal, in addition to crossovers, price making it above or below the averages is another signal a trend is strengthening. ETHUSD is also well above both the 50- and 200-week MAs.\n\nFinally, the slope of the moving averages can be used similarly to a trend line. The 200-week moving average is still pointed in an upward trajectory. Meanwhile, the 50-week is just starting to turn direction upward.\n\nThe last time the golden cross appeared, Ethereum climbed another 680% before its peak. In contrast, the last time ETHUSD pushed above both moving averages in 2020, Ether rallied by more than 1,700%. Current price action has only brought Ethereum under 5% from the moment it made it above the two averages.\n\nPast performance is not a guarantee of future results. Plus, considering the macro and regulatory pressure on altcoins, another death cross could follow any day now. However, of ETHUSD can remain above the two averages, another impressive price increase could be around the corner.\n\nWith all the noise in the market right now, everyone has entirely missed the fact #Ethereum has formed a weekly golden cross pic.twitter.com/ylNwp3DEUI \u2014 Tony \u201cThe Bull\u201d (@tonythebullBTC) June 12, 2023\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The final weeks of 2022 were characterized by volatility and uncertainty in the crypto market. According to forecasts, the first quarter of 2023 was expected to be weak, potentially leading to further losses. However, contrary to expectations, the first three months of 2023 saw crypto assets recover.\n\nDuring this period, bitcoin dominated, surpassing the $22,000 resistance level in January and recording a 36% increase. However, it is essential to note that Bitcoin still faces notable challenges that require attention. Despite initial expectations, Bitcoin has yet to transform into a widespread global payment system as anticipated.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has merits, alternatives like Ethereum and DigiToads are worth considering.\n\nEthereum, renowned for its smart contract capabilities and diverse ecosystem, has experienced an upward trajectory this year. For investors contemplating how to enter the crypto market, Ethereum can present an enticing option due to its distinct features and potential.\n\nOn the other hand, DigiToads, a meme coin project with utility, has disrupted the world of digital collectibles with immersive gaming experiences. For individuals interested in purchasing altcoins that offer the possibility of significant upsides, DigiToads can be an alternative worth considering.\n\nInvestors can explore how they can maximize returns by examining alternatives that Ethereum and DigiToads may offer. As they analyze, investors take account of these projects\u2019 attributes and potential.\n\nDigiToads has a mechanism for collecting crypto\n\nDigiToads, despite being categorized as a meme coin, presents a framework for investors seeking passive income opportunities. This decentralized finance (DeFi) cryptocurrency has been designed as a web3 game but incorporates various earning mechanisms for traders and investors.\n\nYou might also like: Unpacking the growing appeal of meme coins: analyzing DigiToads and Shiba Inu\n\nIn DigiToads, users can accumulate tokens by actively participating in the platform\u2019s game. Players raise and improve DigiToads characters, participate in battles, and earn TOADS tokens through an exchange. Investors do not need to actively collect cryptocurrency at the end of each season. Regardless of their performance in the game, 10% of the collected funds are airdropped to token holders.\n\nFurthermore, a staking mechanism is available to generate passive income. Participants must purchase and stake non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to receive rewards.\n\nThe DigiToads token is also deflationary. Long-term investors may find it appealing that the system incorporates built-in token-burning mechanisms. As the supply decreases, the value of the tokens could increase.\n\nInvestors and gamers are supporting the project. DigiToads has already raised over $4.7 million in its ongoing presale, with the token price rising from $0.01 to $0.036. However, it is essential to note that any investment decision should be made after careful analysis, considering one\u2019s financial circumstances and risk tolerance.\n\n>> Buy DigiToads now <<\n\nEthereum powers dapps\n\nETH, the native token of Ethereum, a blockchain platform, may recover and rally in 2023. As a decentralized blockchain network, Ethereum facilitates the creation of diverse decentralized applications (dapps).

The latest billion-dollar mint for the stablecoin issuer comes within two months of its last mint on April 21.\n\nTether\u2019s chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino took to Twitter to clarify that the latest USDT mint is part of what the firm calls an \u201cinventory replenish\u201d on the Ethereum network. The latest issuance, however, won\u2019t impact the overall market cap of USDT since the latest minting is an \u201cauthorized but not issued transaction.\u201d According to Ardoino, the latest minted amount will be used as inventory for the next period of issuance requests and chain swaps.\n\nPSA: 1B USDt inventory replenish on Ethereum Network.

This procedure allows traders to access other supporting blockchains for the cryptocurrency they hold, letting them utilize their digital assets on multiple blockchains.\n\n\u201cExchanges often find themselves in a situation where a majority of their Tether USDT tokens are held on one particular chain. Consequently, these third-party entities approach us to facilitate a chain swap, ensuring smooth and efficient operations,\" Ardoino told Cointelegraph.\n\nArdoino explained that Tether periodically works with different crypto platforms to help them rebalance the USDT liquidity across various blockchains. For example, if a crypto exchange has a surplus of USDT liquidity on the Ethereum blockchain and a deficit on the Tron blockchain, where it needs to process withdrawals, the exchange will chain-swap its Ethereum-based USDT to the Tron blockchain.\n\nRelated: Tether CTO on USDC depeg: \u2018Bitcoin maxis were right all along\u2019 | PBW 2023\n\nTether has minted over $16 billion of new USDT in 2023, with its current market capitalization at more than $83 billion.

        "content": "A further drop in ETH\u2019s price could send the DeFi market into another round of liquidation.\n\nThe DeFi TVL across all chains submerged.\n\nEthereum [ETH] and assets linked to the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector are experiencing a wave of uncertainty in the market. Although ETH\u2019s dominance in the smart contract space has been unwavering, liquidation in the crypto market arm reached $11 million.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nAccording to Parsec Finance\u2019s data, this liquidation was the highest recorded since 12 May. However, market participants might need to exercise more caution as DefiLlama data shed light on potential threats.\n\nDeFi: Wary of the possibilities\n\nAt the time of writing, the multi-chain DeFi aggregator showed that the total liquidatable assets amounted to $1.7 billion. This metric describes the overall worth of DeFi assets with open futures or contract positions which could suffer losses depending on the market direction.\n\nBased on DefiLlamas\u2019 data, most of the liquidation in the last 24 hours occurred via the MakerDAO [MKR] protocol. However, there were several open staked Ether [stETH] and Wrapped Bitcoin [WBTC] positions at risk of suffering the same fate.\n\nSo, this could prompt market participants to carefully evaluate the risks involved with their sentiment.\n\nOver the last 24 hours, it has not been rosy for the broader crypto market. For instance, ETH\u2019s value decreased by 5.93%. DeFi tokens like Arbitrum [ARB] and Lido Finance [LDO] lost 12.49% and 18.16% respectively.\n\nWith the falling prices, DefiLlama revealed that another 20% aggregate decrease in value could take another $161 million out of the market.\n\nAlthough 20% might seem like a lot, the press time market state does not take away the possibility. This is because more than half of the cryptocurrencies in the top 50 by market capitalization have experienced double-digit decreases in the last 24 hours.\n\nTVL in the drain\n\nInterestingly, the Total Value Locked (TVL) has not been exempt from the widespread gloomy picture of the market. Out of almost 200 chains in the sector, only one\u2014zkSync Era\u2014recorded growth in the last 24 hours.\n\nAs an indicator of whether a DeFi asset is undervalued or overvalued, the TVL measures the worth of tokens temporarily deposited into a protocol.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s MKR\u2019s market cap in LDO\u2019s terms\n\nEthereum, which has the highest TVL of $25.28 billion, lost 4.36% of smart contract deposits within the said period. Thus, the decrease implies that liquidity has been hoarded and flown out of the ecosystem by investors. So, Ethereum might not be performing at its highest capacity.\n\nUnder the Ethereum blockchain, Lido Finance continues to lead the pact with a TVL of $12.65 billion. Other projects, including MakerDAO, Curve Finance [CRV], and Aave [AAVE], trailed behind."

        "title": "What Is MEV? Examples & Risks - Milk Road",
        "content": "What Is MEV In Crypto?\n\nMaximum Extractable Value (MEV) refers to the incremental revenue that blockchain validators can earn by including, excluding, or reordering transactions before finalizing them.\n\nSimilar to transaction fees, MEV is a cost borne by users that transact on public blockchains. Given that many users are not aware of MEV, it\u2019s sometimes referred to as an \u201cinvisible tax.\u201d\n\nHow Much MEV Has Been Extracted?\n\nWhile the concept of MEV has been around since as early as 2014, it was not until 2020 that it really started being extracted.\n\nAs of May 2023, ~625K ETH of cumulative MEV has been extracted on Ethereum. At an ETH price of $1,850 that translates to ~$1.2B.\n\nApproximately 70% (440K ETH) of this MEV was extracted before \u201cThe Merge,\u201d which occurred in September 2022. The remaining 30% (180K ETH) has been extracted after \u201cThe Merge.\u201d\n\nOn certain days, Ethereum validators and block builders have earned more ETH through MEV than they have earned in transaction fee revenue.\n\nFor example, on March 11th, 2023, ~5,100 ETH (~$9.4M at $1,850 per ETH) worth of MEV was extracted on Ethereum. That same day only ~2,600 ETH (~$4.8M at $1,850 ETH) in revenue was generated by transaction fees.\n\nHow Can Users Protect Themselves From MEV?\n\nLet\u2019s call a spade a spade. MEV is not good for users. But it is not all doom and gloom.\n\nFirst off, users can protect themselves by using RPCS (e.g., Flashbots Protect RPC, MEV Blocker RPC), which will prevent trades from being front-run. For those familiar with the MetaMask wallet browser extension, setup is easy. Check out our article on how to use Flashbots for a full rundown.\n\nSecondly, Ethereum users can claw back some of this MEV that is (potentially) being extracted from them by staking their ETH. With the advent of liquid staking solutions, such as Lido, users can stake any amount of ETH and earn staking rewards. The majority of validators (including Lido) run Flashbots MEV-Boost software and re-distribute the MEV they earn to stakers.\n\nHow Do MEV Bots Make Money?\n\nMEV bots monitor the pending transaction queue to identify opportunities to generate MEV revenue. In instances where they successfully identify an opportunity, they are programmed to automatically submit transactions on behalf of their operators to capture MEV rewards.\n\nWhat Is An Example Of MEV?\n\nTop examples of MEV include sandwich attacks, decentralized exchange (DEX) arbitrage, and liquidation attacks:\n\nSandwich attacks: A block builder or validator spots a large buy (or sell) order for one asset. They then place their own order ahead of the large buy order and capitalize on the price appreciation that this large order causes.\n\nA block builder or validator spots a large buy (or sell) order for one asset. They then place their own order ahead of the large buy order and capitalize on the price appreciation that this large order causes. DEX arbitrage: A blockchain user runs software (i.e., deploys bots) to identify price differentials between the same asset on different DEXes. Once the software identifies material price differentials, it buys an asset on one DEX and sells it on another at a higher price (typically all within one single transaction).\n\nA blockchain user runs software (i.e., deploys bots) to identify price differentials between the same asset on different DEXes. Once the software identifies material price differentials, it buys an asset on one DEX and sells it on another at a higher price (typically all within one single transaction). Liquidations: Liquidations typically entail a transaction sender capitalizing on an oracle price update to be the first to liquidate a loan\u2019s collateral to earn a profit.\n\nAs displayed in the chart below, sandwich attacks have emerged as one of the leading sources of MEV.\n\nThe Sandwich Attack\n\nThe average Ethereum user can\u2019t see other users\u2019 pending transactions. But an Ethereum validator can. When it comes to MEV, this visibility is what allows validators to extract profit. They can spot large incoming buy (and sell) orders on DEXes and position themselves to profit at the expense of users.\n\nThe typical steps of a sandwich attack go something like this:\n\nBob is an Ethereum validator (or block builder). In the mempool, he spots a trade submitted by Alice to make a large swap of USDC for ETH on the Uniswap DEX. Bob copies Alice\u2019s trade and also submits an ETH buy order. But because Bob is a validator, he can place his buy order ahead of the order placed by Alice (who is not a validator and cannot see Bob\u2019s transactions and cannot order transactions). Bob\u2019s ETH buy gets filled first. Alice\u2019s ETH buy then gets filled and pushes up the market price of ETH. Bob then sells his ETH at the higher market price and pockets the difference.\n\nFrom the perspective of, Bob, that is a nice trade. Sure, there is a degree of risk involved with what he did \u2013 ETH\u2019s price could have actually declined for a number of reasons and eliminated his profit opportunity. But if Alice\u2019s order is sufficiently large, chances are that it will result in a price increase of ETH and a profitable trade for Bob.\n\nFrom the perspective of Alice, this is clearly a suboptimal outcome. Bob\u2019s initial ETH buy resulted in her trade being executed at a worse price. Had Bob not front-run her, she would have gotten more ETH in return for the same amount of USDC.\n\nBob\u2019s subsequent sale could also put sell pressure on ETH and could have decreased its price. Had Alice wanted to sell her ETH after she bought it, she would have gotten less USDC in return, as Bob\u2019s ETH sale pushed down the price of ETH.\n\nIf you are a Uniswap user and this is the first time you\u2019re hearing about this, sorry. You could very well have been sandwich attacked without even knowing about it. But as mentioned above, the Flashbots Protect RPC is a good alternative that offers protection against these types of attacks.\n\nOther Examples Of MEV Attacks\n\nWhile the sandwich attack, DEX arbitrage, and liquidation attacks are the most prominent examples of MEV extraction, it can be extracted through a variety of methods. Some of these include:\n\nBack-running occurs when a validator places their transaction to be finalized directly after another transaction. Back-running typically occurs in conjunction with token listings on DEXEs. For example, immediately after someone begins providing liquidity for an asset on a DEX, MEV bots would buy large quantities of said asset. The bot would then wait for the price to go up and sell the tokens at a higher price.\n\noccurs when a validator places their transaction to be finalized directly after another transaction.

For example, immediately after someone begins providing liquidity for an asset on a DEX, MEV bots would buy large quantities of said asset. The bot would then wait for the price to go up and sell the tokens at a higher price. Front running, which is sometimes referred to as \u201csniping,\u201d occurs when a validator detects a potentially profitable transaction(s) in the mempool. The validator then copies the user\u2019s transaction and pays a higher fee for their transaction to be executed first \u2013 thus stealing the victim\u2019s alpha and gains.\n\nwhich is sometimes referred to as \u201csniping,\u201d occurs when a validator detects a potentially profitable transaction(s) in the mempool.

If block rewards are small enough compared to MEV, it can be economically rational for validators to destabilize a network\u2019s consensus process and attempt to reverse previously finalized transactions to extract MEV.\n\nare attacks where validators \u201crewrite\u201d a blockchain\u2019s transaction history to steal funds allocated by smart contracts in the past. If block rewards are small enough compared to MEV, it can be economically rational for validators to destabilize a network\u2019s consensus process and attempt to reverse previously finalized transactions to extract MEV. Uncle-bandit attacks refer to attacks in which validators notice transactions in rejected blocks (uncles) that are not confirmed and selectively bring one or few of them back into the main blockchain to profit from them.\n\nMEV And Network Congestion\n\nHave you ever seen a chart of Ethereum transaction fees and wondered, \u201cWhy would anyone pay $30+ for a single Ethereum transaction?\u201d\n\nMedian transaction fee on Ethereum\n\nSure, fear of missing out (FOMO) could be one cause of these high fees. When NFTs or meme coins are in a state of mania, one could (rightly or wrongly) justify paying $30, or even hundreds of dollars, to get their hands on them.\n\nBut knowing what we know about MEV, all signs point to MEV playing a big role in clogging up blockchain networks and increasing transaction fees for real users.\n\nTake the \u201cDEX Arbitrage\u201d example from before. Consider a situation where ETH is trading on one DEX at $1,750 and on another DEX at $1,850. Even if an MEV bot needs to pay $99 in transaction fees to capture this $100 spread, it would still be rational for the bot to pay the fees. After all, one dollar of risk-free profits is still one dollar \u2013 even if it costs $99 to generate it.\n\nOn-chain data confirms this suspicion. One of the most notorious \u201csandwich attacker\u201d MEV bots, jaredfromsubway.eth, has paid upwards of $30M in transaction fees to extract MEV on Ethereum.\n\nWhat Are The Risks Of MEV?\n\nWhile MEV has direct negative impacts on users, it also poses risks to blockchain network stability.\n\nIf the MEV available in a block significantly exceeds the standard block reward, validators may be incentivized to reorganize previously finalized blocks and capture the MEV for themselves. Blockchain re-organizations create network instability and could reduce users\u2019 confidence in interacting with the network.\n\nAdditionally, MEV has the potential to emerge as a major cause of centralization. Identifying and extracting MEV requires significant technical expertise and resources. Solo-stakers who are running their own validators are less equipped to extract MEV and could be incentivized to delegate their stake to validators with more expertise \u2013 thus centralizing control over the network.\n\nFinally, extracting MEV requires deploying new software, which could be subject to bugs and vulnerabilities. For example, ~90% of Ethereum blocks are currently sourced via the Flashbots MEV-Boost middleware. The system is dependent on a system of relays which could potentially go offline and cause network liveness failures.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat Is Miner Extractable Value? Miner extractable value is synonymous with maximum extractable value. Following Ethereum\u2019s merge, proof-of-work miners were replaced by proof-of-stake validators in Ethereum consensus. Hence, miner extractable value was deprecated as a term and replaced by maximum extractable value. What Is Flashbots? Flashbots is a research and development organization aimed at making the MEV market more efficient, distributed, and democratic. It is a for-profit company that provides Ethereum software products to users and infrastructure providers in the MEV ecosystem. Why Is MEV Bad? Certain types of MEV are bad because they increase the cost for real users to transact on blockchains. Extracting MEV can induce network congestion which increases the explicit costs for real users that want to transact on blockchains. Does MEV Exist In Bitcoin? Yes, some MEV does exist on Bitcoin. Historically, Bitcoin was primarily used for simple transactions (e.g., transferring BTC from one address to another). But new innovations such as Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens are expanding the use cases of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain and creating new opportunities for MEV extraction.\n\nData Analyst Andrew Cahill Andrew previously was a Research Director at The Block; a crypto media and research company.

The prediction is based on Ethereum (ETH) becoming accepted across various industry sectors, such as finance, healthcare, and insurance.\n\nIt is becoming increasingly believed that Ethereum (ETH) could evolve into the leading open-source settlement network worldwide. If this scenario unfolds, Ethereum (ETH) would essentially become a digital stage for a significant chunk of business operations across different industries.\n\nConversely, if Ethereum (ETH) fails to achieve prime dominance or becomes a smart contract platform with less than 15% dominance, it would signify a bear market, potentially pulling Ethereum (ETH)\u2019s price down to less than $350 in the coming seven years.\n\nVanEck also points out that if circumstances favor Ethereum (ETH), it could possibly secure a base case price of more than $11,000 \u2014 offering a substantial return for long-term traders.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is currently trading at $1856 after starting the year at just $1200.\n\nThis means that Ethereum (ETH) has already seen a gain of more than 50% since the start of 2023, and if VanEck\u2019s prediction proves accurate it could mean an incredible return for those who invest now.\n\nFor more information about $TCRV presale tokens:\n\nClick Here For Website\n\nClick Here To Buy TCRV Presale Tokens\n\nFollow Us Twitter\n\nJoin Our Community on Telegram\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "ChatGPT price prediction for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tradecurve - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "ChatGPT has seen an exponential level of growth ever since it was released, with millions of users using it on a daily basis, it has been proven to be super effective at researching data and giving predictions.\n\nWe asked ChatGPT about Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tradecurve to see how far it thinks their price can climb. While the data received from ChatGPT is not always 100% accurate, the prediction it makes can give investors a higher perspective as to the potential future of a specific cryptocurrency.\n\n>>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW<<\n\nChatGPT Predicts The Future of Bitcoin\n\nFirst, we asked ChatGPT to predict the future value of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. On June 7, 2023, Bitcoin traded at $26,883.32. The results given by ChatGPT were split into bullish and bearish. For the bullish predictions, ChatGPT estimated that Bitcoin could reach between $60,000 to $100,000 by the end of 2023. However, it also listed bearish predictions, where Bitcoin could dip to $20,000 or even $10,000.\n\nChatGPT noted that it is impossible to say for sure what the price of Bitcoin will be by the end of the year. However, it did notice that it is a volatile cryptocurrency and suggested that investors need to carefully consider the risks and potential rewards before investing.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Outlook According to ChatGPT\n\nSecond, we asked ChatGPT to predict the future of Ethereum. As of June 7, 2023, Ethereum traded at $1,870.29. The AI chatbot noted how experts believe that the price of Ethereum could reach new all-time highs in 2023. However, it also showcased that Ethereum could decrease in value due to the increased regulation of cryptocurrencies by governments around the world.\n\nGoing over the bullish predictions for Ethereum, ChatGPT predicts a value between $16,391 to $18,213 by the end of the year. However, it also showcased bearish outlooks, where Ethereum could dip to $2,000 or even $1,000 by the end of the year. It\u2019s clear that ChatGPT did not give a definitive answer to either Bitcoin or Ethereum\u2019s future value, but the numbers do shed some light on the potential momentum of the coins in either direction.\n\nTradecurve and Its Potential to 100x In Value ACcording to ChatGPT\n\nThird, we asked ChatGPT to predict what Tradecurve\u2019s value will look like in the future. The AI chatbot noted that this is a new cryptocurrency that is still in its presale stage and that a lot of factors can affect its growth moving forward. Some of them included the increased adoption of cryptocurrencies by institutional investors, the increased demand for crypto by retail investors, and the success of the platform.\n\nEstimates made by ChatGPT suggest that Tradecurve can climb 100x in value to $1.5 by the end of 2023. As of June 7, TCRV is at Stage 3 of its presale, trading at $0.015. The platform offers access to crypto and derivatives without KYC and will implement Proof of Reserves (PoR) while also offering high leverage and algorithmic trading.\n\nTraders and investors will want to jump into the TCRV presale early in order to get the highest return of investments when the project explodes in value at launch, according to the predictions made by ChatGPT.\n\nAccess more data surrounding Tradecurve below:\n\nClick Here For Website\n\nClick Here To Buy TCRV Presale Tokens\n\nFollow Us Twitter\n\nJoin Our Community on Telegram\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "How to Launch a DAO - Decrypt",
        "content": "In brief A decentralized autonomous organization is an organizational structure where control is spread out rather than hierarchical.\n\nDAOs use smart contracts on a blockchain, with participants using governance tokens to vote on proposed actions.\n\nIt's not difficult to spin up a new DAO; the hard part is getting people to join, and retaining them.\n\nYour Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe term DAO (short for \"decentralized autonomous organization\") became a crypto buzzword in 2021, but the concept has real value. As of June 2022, the DAO ecosystem has a combined treasury value of $8.7 billion, according to the analytics site DeepDAO.\n\nDAOs continue to grow as a community organizing model, a means of quickly raising and distributing money for social causes, or decentralizing blockchain-based protocols.\n\nHere are the basics on how to start one. (This explainer is not financial or legal advice.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat is a DAO?\n\nDecentralized autonomous organizations use a shared treasury, smart contracts (programs that execute once criteria are met), and tokens for voting.\n\nThe first DAO, called \"The DAO,\" launched on Ethereum in 2016. While it is possible to establish a DAO on any blockchain that supports smart contracts, most of them run on Ethereum.\n\nSetting up a DAO\n\nForming a DAO requires several steps:\n\nName the DAO\n\nCreate a mission statement\n\nSpin up a Discord server\n\nSet up a Twitter account\n\nInvite people to join\n\nLaunch a governance token\n\nCreate a funding mechanism\n\nSet up Snapshot or other tools for voting and logging member contributions\n\nTo summarize a Minimum Viable DAO in 5 steps: 1. Establish a mission 2. Build a community on @discord or @telegram 3. Create a shared treasury with @gnosisPM 4. Construct a governance framework with @SnapshotLabs 5. Distribute ownership with @viamirror or @CoinviseCo \u2014 Lucas \ud83d\udd25_\ud83d\udd25 (@0x_Lucas) December 21, 2021\n\nEvery DAO needs a name that encapsulates its mission, such as ConstitutionDAO, FreeRossDAO, Ukraine DAO, and AssangeDAO.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor this lesson, let's imagine that we want to launch an explorer's club DAO. Decrypt has gone ahead and set it up.\n\nName: Exploration DAO\n\nDAO Type: Education/Club\n\nMission Statement: To finance and facilitate exploration of unknown places and preserve historical items, works, and sites. Exploration DAO is dedicated to funding people and organizations working to explore and preserve history. The DAO will donate all funds raised outside operating costs to charities, schools, museums, and global organizations.\n\nNext, we want to set up where the DAO will live for member engagement, community building, and announcement. The most commonly used platforms are:\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ExplorationDAO Discord: https://discord.gg/U3f89V2kZN Telegram: https://t.me/+kuf4cw16ZsgyNDUx\n\nTwitter: Love it or hate it, Twitter is the public square. DAOs use Twitter to announce their plans to the broader world.\n\nDiscord: If any Web2 app has stuck around in Web3, it's Discord, which built its base with gamers but has now also become the home of DAOs. DAO leaders like Discord for its ability to organize thousands of people into different roles and working groups.\n\nTelegram: DAOs may also use Telegram to create groups and gather members, perhaps before forming a Discord.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat tools are available for launching a DAO?\n\nHere are some popular sites for launching a DAO:\n\nDAOhaus\n\nDAOhaus is a DAO protocol for joining existing DAOs and creating a new DAO based on the Moloch framework. DAOs can be launched by setting a few parameters: 1. The type of DAO being launched: Guild (works collectively to offer services); Clubs (little to no financial decisions); Ventures (for large financial decisions; Grants (distribute wealth); and Products (govern a product or protocol); 2. The addresses of the members; 3. Filling in the DAO's metadata like its name, social media, and website link.\n\nCollab.Land\n\nNot specifically a tool for launching a DAO, Collab.Land is a popular tool used by DAOs to moderate membership. It does this by verifying that each member currently holds the DAO's token, allowing access to the DAO's various Discord channels, and kicks out members who no longer hold the token.\n\nAragon\n\nAragon is an open-source platform for launching and maintaining a DAO on the Ethereum blockchain. Aragon offers two main products: Aragon Client, a toolkit for developers to create online organizations that aim for more transparency and customizability, and Aragon Govern, a framework for DAO governance with on-chain execution and plug-in dispute resolution.\n\nTreasury management tools\n\nEventually, a DAO will need a treasury to store its funds and manage its tokens. Deciding which tool to use depends on the group's needs and treasury size. The DAO will need a compatible wallet like MetaMask, WalletConnect, or Portis.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGnosis Safe\n\nGnosis Safe is an Ethereum wallet that requires a minimum number of people to approve a transaction before it can occur. When a DAO wants to pursue a course of action, it's voted on by the members of the DAO (see Snapshot below) and then executed by a core group of signers, known as a multi-sig (multi-signature). With Gnosis Safe, users can define a list of signer accounts and the required number of signers so no single DAO member can move funds independently.\n\nSyndicate Web3 Investment Clubs\n\nTo start a Web3 investment club on Syndicate, founders will need to connect a wallet like Metamask to the Syndicate network. Deposits are collected in that wallet, and any existing assets in the wallet will be visible to all club members. After the investment club founder chooses a name, the platform will assign a club token symbol. Syndicate investment clubs can then become the treasury of a DAO built around it.\n\nVoting tools\n\nAfter setting up a treasury, a DAO will need a way for members to vote on proposals. Snapshot is by far the most popular tool. It is a decentralized voting system that allows users to create proposals and vote off-chain, meaning votes are cast\u2014no cryptocurrency is exchanged\u2014using ERC-20 tokens or even NFTs to show voting power.\n\nFundraising tools\n\nJuicebox\n\nThink of Juicebox as a Web3 version of Kickstarter. Projects use Juicebox to raise funding from their communities via smart contracts on Ethereum. Projects can design a fundraising page and funding structure and define how funds and rewards will be distributed.\n\nMirror\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMirror is best known as a blogging platform built on blockchain technology. But in addition to publishing articles, DAOs can also use Mirror for crowdfunding projects that use Ethereum smart contracts, and to turn posts into NFTs.\n\nDid you know? DAOs come in various flavors, from fashion DAOs like Digitalax to DAOs formed around buying sports franchises to DAOs like Maker that act as DeFi central banks.\n\nThe future of DAOs: What's Next?\n\nAs DAOs become more mainstream, more tools will become available to offer more one-stop solutions tools like Superdao and DAOhaus, where with a few clicks, a new DAO is spun up. But while the number of tools available to launch a DAO continues to grow, the most crucial piece of the puzzle is the ability to organize and motivate DAO members to act and work toward the DAO's mission and goal."

        "title": "See where six crypto whales\u2019 wallets are putting their assets - TechCrunch",
        "content": "The crypto market continues to waver as we transition toward the second half of the year amid a regulatory crackdown in the U.S. But as trading volume continues to dwindle across centralized exchanges, some big crypto whales are still trading.\n\nWe decided to take a look at what six major crypto whales\u2019 wallets \u2014 a \u201cwhale\u201d in investing or gambling denotes a player with a lot of capital in play \u2014 are doing: where they park funds and how their activity signals movement in the market, according to on-chain portfolio data from Nansen.\n\nThe wallets are worth a total of $493.6 million, with almost 98% of their wallets\u2019 allocated on the Ethereum blockchain, the data showed. The wallets and their data were selected by Nansen to detail a series of active wallets; we will continue to explore other whale wallets over time to expand our sample set.\n\nA majority of the wallets include \u201cwrapped\u201d crypto assets, which is a tokenized version of the original coin that holds the same value. For example, there\u2019s bitcoin (BTC) and wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) and an investor would own the latter if they wanted to use bitcoin on the Ethereum network, which it doesn\u2019t operate on. It can, though, through the wrapped version.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at six crypto whale\u2019s wallets ranging from \u201csmallest\u201d to largest:\n\nCrypto wallet 1 with $18.25 million net worth:\n\nChain allocation: 98.31% on the Ethereum chain.\n\nBiggest token allocations: 85.55% is staked Ethereum (stETH) at $25.8 million. 6.44% is wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) at $1.94 million. About 5%, or $1.6 million, across ENS, UNI and MATIC. Roughly $27,000 in stablecoin USDT.\n\nProtocol allocation 94% held on Aave (lending protocol). About 6% held in wallet.\n\nPortfolio performance down 6.75% on the week\n\nCrypto wallet 2 with $21.88 million net worth:\n\nChain allocation: 99.44% on the Ethereum chain.\n\nBiggest token allocations: 71.39% is staked Ethereum (stETH) at $40.6 million. 22% is in stablecoin DAI at $12.5 million. About 5%, or $2.9 million, across CUNI, UNI, CRV, wETH, CVX, MKR.\n\nProtocol allocation 64% held on Aave. 25% on Compound. 5.59% held in crypto wallet.\n\nPortfolio performance down 5.5% on the week\n\nCrypto wallet 3 with $27.83 million net worth:\n\nChain allocation: 100% on the Ethereum chain.\n\nBiggest token allocations: 99.99% is staked Ethereum (stETH) at $55.72 million. Less than $4,000 is ether (ETH). Less than $100 in stablecoins DAI and USDT.\n\nProtocol allocation 99.99% held on Aave. Less than 0.01% in crypto wallet.\n\nPortfolio performance down 6% on the week\n\nCrypto wallet 4 with $97.27 million net worth:\n\nChain allocation: 100% on the Ethereum chain.\n\nBiggest token allocations: 57.2% is ether (ETH) at $55.6 million. 42.75% is wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) at $41.58 million. Less than .1% is held in stablecoin USDT.\n\nProtocol allocation 100% held in crypto wallet.\n\nPortfolio performance down 1.25% on the week\n\nCrypto wallet 5 with $121.77 million net worth:\n\nChain allocation: 100% on the Ethereum chain.\n\nBiggest token allocations: 38.5% is ether (ETH) at $46.91 million. 32.27% is Rocket Pool (RPL) at $39.29 million. 28.21% is wrapped ether (wETH) at $34.35 million. Less than 1%, or $860,695, is held in USDC.\n\nProtocol allocation 99.91% held in crypto wallet.\n\nPortfolio performance down 4.1% on the week\n\nCrypto wallet 6 with $206.86 million net worth:\n\nChain allocation: 94.2% on the Ethereum chain. 3.9% on Arbitrum chain.\n\nBiggest token allocations: 61.57% in wrapped ether (wETH) at about $127.32 million. 14.55% in MKR at $30 million. 12.87%, about $26.64 million, held in stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI.\n\nBiggest protocol allocations 37.37%, or $77.3 million, held on lending pool Morpho. 26.6%, or $55 million, held in crypto wallet. 22.1%, or $45.72 million, held on Uniswap.\n\nPortfolio performance down 3% on the week\n\nThe takeaway\n\nAll the portfolios are down on the week, which makes sense given the crypto market\u2019s shaky nature, and almost all are solely allocated on Ethereum\u2019s chain, making it the dominant place by a landslide for investors.\n\nAcross the six wallets, 97.55% were allocated to the Ethereum chain, with less than 3% on Arbitrum and Optimism chains. So it makes sense that the biggest token allocations all pertained to Ethereum with wrapped ether, staked ether and ether making up 69% of the six wallets\u2019 $493.6 million total. After Ethereum, wrapped bitcoin composed 7.66% of the total allocation across the wallets.\n\nOverall, this means the whales are generally risk-off, given the majority are holding liquid staking tokens, stablecoins and wrapped bitcoin and ether, signaling a conservative mindset.\n\nWhat was surprising, though, were the six wallets\u2019 lack of stablecoin allocations. Only crypto wallet 2 and 6 had a notable amount held in stablecoins, at 22% and 12.87%, respectively. This shows that these whales have a stronger appetite and are actively investing in the market, even if they\u2019re defaulting to staking, opposed to watching from the sidelines with their money held in a (supposed to be) stable way.\n\nWallet 4 and 5 hold the majority of their funds in their crypto wallets, while others preferred to hold their tokens on protocols to (hopefully) gain passive income. Half of the wallets are also staking a majority of their portfolios, which is a common activity across whales. Crypto staking can provide returns, but if the asset being staked drops in value, then the rewards will also drop; there is no guarantee that rewards will offset any potential declines in value of the staked asset. So the mass amount that these three crypto wallets are staking signals that they might believe that these investments are going to be in the green long term.\n\nIt also makes sense that the wallets that are staking their assets through a protocol like Aave, which provides users noncustodial liquidity markets that can earn interest (currently around 6% APR). While there\u2019s a number of liquidity protocols out there, Aave seems to be leading the ranks here for the whales. The comparison I make to this is: I shop at Target and Walmart, but I prefer one over the other, even though they provide similar experiences.\n\nIn general, digital asset investment products saw outflows of $88 million, marking eight consecutive weeks of outflows worth a total of $417 million, according to CoinShares\u2019 weekly report. \u201cWe believe that this is monetary policy related, with currently no clear end in sight to interest rate rises, leaving investors cautious,\u201d the report stated. This week, Ethereum, had outflows of $36 million, which is the largest seven-day outflow since the Merge in September.\n\nTypically, the crypto market is looked at holistically by tracking volume, trading activity and other metrics. But by looking at a handful of wallets, we can see what some whales are doing, which matters given how much capital they control compared to the average retail trader. Regardless of how each of these wallets initially got its net worth, their current activity points to a more conservative approach, something traders tend to do when in a bear market as tokens become less predictable and there are fewer opportunities to get rich quick.\n\nGiven that we only looked at six crypto whale portfolios, it\u2019s important to note that this is a small part of the market and should not be used as financial advice. This was done to look at where whales are moving capital and what they\u2019re doing amid the bear market \u2014 and how it\u2019s paying off for them. As always, you should do your own research."

        "content": "Crypto Forensic Tools \u2013 A Necessity\n\nEthereum, a notable digital asset, has gained considerable momentum and is now a favored option for decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. Nonetheless, the swift expansion of the cryptocurrency market has also spawned a surge of crypto scams aimed at naive investors.\n\nThe need for advanced forensic tools capable of tracking and analyzing suspicious activities on the Ethereum blockchain has become increasingly apparent in response to this growing threat. Crypto forensic tools are essential in the fight against crypto fraud, as they can help identify and trace the movement of funds associated with illicit activities.

        "content": "You can find dozens of Elon Musk videos on YouTube that appear to be Bitcoin price predictions or his viewpoint on various cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. But the reality is that all such YouTube videos are fake! There is a whole network of cybercriminals who have uploaded fake Elon Musk videos on YouTube to scam viewers. And what's more shocking is that the scammers made $243,000 in just over a week! A report by BBC confirmed as many as 23 transfers of Bitcoin and 18 transfers of Ethereum. So, how is this Elon Musk scam being powered on YouTube?\n\nFraudsters are hacking YouTube accounts and promoting fraudulent cryptocurrency giveaways with fake videos. Thousands of people watched these bogus videos this month, according to BBC. For months, a number of individuals have been duped into transferring cryptocurrencies to criminals via these video live stream on YouTube for months. According to the BBC, the hackers alter the names and images of dozens of YouTube channels to imitate official Tesla channels, of which Musk is the CEO.\n\nA BBC report mentioned that Elon Musk said on Tuesday that YouTube was not tackling \"scam ads\" properly. While YouTube says it removes all those channels that are reported. There is one of the most common videos on YouTube that claims that people can double their money by sending Bitcoin or Ethereum to a digital wallet. Shockingly, Chilean musician Aisack has also been a victim of this fake video-streaming of Elon Musk videos on YouTube. Two weeks ago, cybercriminals hijacked the musician's YouTube channel.\n\n\"My followers on other social networks started asking me what is going on with the name of my channel and were very confused about why I was streaming Tesla content,\" BBC report quoted Chilean urban-music artist Aisack as saying. He further adds, \"I feel completely violated and insecure. YouTube is not doing enough on security issues to prevent hacker attacks, since many users are in the same situation as me.\u201d\n\nYouTube says that it had removed one of the reported channels while adding, \"We have strict Community Guidelines prohibiting scams, including Impersonation and hacking.\" Surprisingly, Whale Alert founder Frank van Weert mentioned that, scammers are having less success than the previous year - but still, there are plenty of victims falling for it."

        "title": "Is Ethereum 2.0 Staking Profitable After The Merge Event? - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Ethereum has been at the forefront of innovation and change in the ever-evolving crypto sphere. The Ethereum network, known for its smart contract functionality and the birthplace of decentralized applications (dApps), has recently undergone a transformative event known as the \u2018Ethereum Merge.\u2019 This event marks a significant shift in Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism, transitioning from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS), thereby completely eliminating the role of miners and replacing it with staking work.\n\nThe Ethereum Merge is a milestone in the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, a long-awaited event that has been in the works for several years. This transition is not just a technical upgrade; it represents a paradigm shift in the way Ethereum operates. PoW, the original consensus mechanism of Ethereum, involved miners solving complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new blocks, known as Ethereum mining. This process, while secure, was energy-intensive and faced criticism for its environmental impact.\n\nThe shift to PoS changes the game entirely. Instead of miners, we now have validators who are chosen to create new blocks based on the amount of Ethereum they hold and are willing to \u2018stake\u2019 as collateral. This method is not only more energy-efficient but also democratizes the Ethereum network by allowing more participants to engage in the validation process.\n\nThe Ethereum Merge is a bold step towards a more sustainable and inclusive blockchain ecosystem. In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the fascinating realm of Ethereum 2.0 staking, a revolutionary development that has taken the cryptocurrency world by storm. This article is designed to be a comprehensive resource for both newcomers and seasoned investors in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWhether you\u2019re considering staking services as a potential investment or simply curious about the latest developments in the Ethereum network, this guide will provide you with the knowledge and tools you need to navigate the world of Ethereum 2.0 staking.\n\nWhat is Ethereum 2.0?\n\nEthereum 2.0, also known as ETH2, represents a significant evolution in the world of blockchain technology. It is a multi-phased upgrade designed to enhance the scalability and security of the Ethereum network through a series of infrastructure modifications. The most notable of these changes is the shift from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nIn January 2022, the Ethereum Foundation rebranded Ethereum 2.0 as the \u201cconsensus layer,\u201d emphasizing that this upgrade is not about building a new network from scratch but rather enhancing the existing one. The original Ethereum network, now referred to as the \u201cexecution layer,\u201d continues to be the domain where network and smart contract rules reside.\n\nThis rebranding reflects the seamless integration of the two layers, with the consensus layer handling the network\u2019s security and the execution layer managing the computation and storage. The full upgrade, which is expected to be completed by 2023, will result in a more robust, efficient, and scalable Ethereum network ready to meet the growing demands of the global blockchain ecosystem.\n\nWhat is ETH 2.0 staking?\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) network, once plagued by high transaction costs and scalability issues, has undergone a significant transformation with the launch of Ethereum 2.0. Previously, the success of DeFi projects led to an overburdened network, with transaction costs skyrocketing to levels that were prohibitively expensive for many use cases. Non-finance DApps (decentralized applications developed on top of Ethereum) found it particularly challenging to operate due to these high gas fees.\n\nHowever, the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s network upgrade, now known as Ethereum 2.0, has addressed these issues, enhancing the security, speed, efficiency, and scalability of the Ethereum network. This upgrade has allowed Ethereum to process more transactions, alleviate bottlenecks, and accommodate a broader range of use cases, extending beyond the realm of finance.\n\nA key component of this upgrade is the shift from a mining model to a staking model. In a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, staking is the process of actively participating in transaction validation, similar to mining in the previous model. Anyone with the minimum required balance of cryptocurrency can become a validator, validate transactions and earn staking rewards. Ethereum can be staked on various cryptocurrency exchange platforms, including Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, and more.\n\nBefore the upgrade, Ethereum could handle around 15 transactions per second, a rate that was relatively slow for financial transactions. However, with the implementation of PoS, Ethereum 2.0 is expected to enable the processing of up to 100,000 transactions per second. This significant increase in capacity considerably expands the range of projects and applications that can be built on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nHow Does Ethereum Staking Work?\n\nIn the realm of blockchain technology, the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system, unlike its Proof-of-Work (PoW) counterpart, operates by bundling 32 blocks of transactions into a single validation cycle, which averages around 6.4 minutes.\n\nThese bundled blocks are known as \u201cepochs.\u201d An epoch reaches a state of finality, meaning it becomes unalterable, once two subsequent epochs have been appended to the blockchain.\n\nThe Beacon Chain, a key component of the PoS system, forms \u2018committees\u2019 of 128 stakers and assigns them randomly to a specific shard block. Each committee is allocated a \u2018slot,\u2019 a fixed period to propose a new block and authenticate the transactions it contains. With 32 slots in each epoch, a total of 32 committees are required to finalize the validation cycle.\n\nIn each committee, a single member is chosen at random to propose a new transaction block, while the remaining 127 members cast their votes on the proposal and confirm the authenticity of the transactions.\n\nThe Beacon Chain is instrumental in ensuring network synchronization. It collects state data from shards and disseminates it to other shards. It also manages validators, from registering their stake contributions to distributing rewards and penalties.\n\nSharding is a technique that segments the Ethereum network into multiple \u2018shards,\u2019 each maintaining its own state, which includes a unique set of account balances and smart contracts.\n\nWhen a new block receives attestation from the majority of the committee, it is appended to the blockchain, and a \u201ccross-link\u201d is created to confirm its inclusion. The staker selected to propose the new block is rewarded only after this process.\n\nThe states of individual shards are harmonized with the main chain, the Beacon Chain, through cross-linking. This ensures that the final state of each shard is mirrored on the Beacon Chain.\n\nIn a distributed network, a transaction achieves \u201cfinality\u201d when it is included in a block that is immutable. The Casper finality protocol in PoS accomplishes this by securing agreement from validators on the state of a block at designated checkpoints.\n\nThe finalization of a block occurs when it receives agreement from two-thirds of the validators. If validators later attempt to overturn this with a 51% attack, they stand to forfeit their entire stake.\n\nIndeed, Ethereum validators have been engaged in staking for quite some time. The Beacon Chain, an upgraded proof-of-stake network, successfully merged to become the primary Ethereum network on September 15, 2022, following its initial launch on December 1, 2020.\n\nSince the initial launch of the Beacon Chain, investors have had the opportunity to stake in this network. Their Ethereum, once staked, was securely locked until the successful completion of the merge, marking the beginning of a new era for the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe Shanghai/Capella upgrade was successfully implemented on April 12, 2023. This upgrade facilitated the staking withdrawals of rewards, thereby addressing the issue of staking liquidity.\n\nHow to stake Ethereum?\n\nFor those considering staking on the Ethereum network, a minimum of 32 ETH is required, which will be locked for a certain period. Additionally, setting up a staking node involves running an Ethereum client, a type of software that facilitates node interaction with the Ethereum network.\n\nThere are several compatible software clients for setting up staking nodes, including:\n\nPrysm: A variant of the Ethereum software developed using the Go language.\n\nTeku: An enterprise-oriented software client developed in Java.\n\nLighthouse: A software client developed using the Rust programming language.\n\nLodestar: A software client developed by Chaincode Labs using JavaScript/Typescript.\n\nTo run these clients, a computer with sufficient memory to download the Ethereum blockchain is necessary.\n\nValidators are required to maintain a constant connection to the blockchain, implying that a reliable internet connection is essential. Once the validator software is installed on your computer, the next step involves committing a minimum of 32 ETH to the designated Ethereum staking contract address.\n\nStaking via Crypto Exchange\n\nNumerous opportunities exist for users interested in staking Ethereum, with options spanning from solo staking to staking-as-a-service and collective staking. These alternatives cater to a diverse user base, and each has its unique characteristics.\n\nThey differ in aspects such as risk levels, potential rewards, and trust requirements. Some are more decentralized, have undergone more rigorous testing, or carry higher risks than others. For those who prefer not to manage their own keys, there are solutions that handle the technical aspects while still allowing users to earn native block rewards.\n\nCoinbase, a leading exchange, provides an Ethereum staking program for users who prefer not to operate their own node. When it comes to wallets, Ledger stands out as a prime choice for staking ETH.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step guide to staking Ethereum via a cryptocurrency exchange like Binance:\n\nStep 1: Register for an account. This usually involves providing personal details, verifying your identity, and setting up a payment method for buying ETH. Step 2: Buy ETH. After setting up your account, you\u2019ll need to acquire Ethereum. This can typically be done using various payment methods offered by the exchange, such as bank transfers, credit cards, or debit cards. Step 3: Move ETH to the exchange\u2019s staking program. Once you have ETH in your exchange wallet, you should be able to locate an option to stake ETH within the wallet interface. The exact steps may differ based on the exchange, but generally, you\u2019ll need to go to the wallet\u2019s staking section and follow the instructions to stake your ETH. Step 4: Select your staking preferences. This involves choosing parameters like the amount of ETH you wish to stake and the duration for which you want to stake it. Step 5: Begin staking and earning rewards. Rewards are usually credited to your account at regular intervals, depending on the specific staking program and its payout schedule.\n\nExchange APY (for Flexible Term Staking of ETH) Huobi 5% BitForex 3% PrimeXBT 1.99% KuCoin 1.66% Bybit 1.2% Binance 0.92% MEXC 0.5% Phemex 0.3% Crypto.com 0.2%\n\nStaking Through a Wallet\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step guide to staking Ethereum using a cryptocurrency wallet, such as Guarda:\n\nStep 1: Select a suitable wallet. Opt for a wallet that supports Ethereum staking. Some well-known choices include Ledger, Trezor, and MetaMask. Step 2: Move ETH to your wallet. After choosing a wallet, you\u2019ll need to transfer ETH into it from an exchange or another wallet. Step 3: Go to the staking area. Once your wallet has ETH, find the staking area within the wallet\u2019s interface. This might involve clicking on a specific button or tab. Step 4: Stake following the provided instructions. After finding the staking area, adhere to the instructions given by the wallet to stake your ETH.\n\nImmediate Method: Staking ETH via a staking pool\n\nEthereum requires a minimum of 32 ETH for individual staking, a sum many crypto holders don\u2019t possess. To address this, solutions like centralized exchanges and staking pools have emerged. Staking pools allow ETH holders to combine their funds to reach the 32 ETH staking threshold, with rewards distributed proportionally.\n\nStaking pools can be non-liquid or liquid. Non-liquid pools allow ETH holders to earn rewards without a tradable derivative token, making it a non-taxable event. They typically offer an APY of 4% to 6% and don\u2019t require the 32 ETH threshold.\n\nLiquid staking pools, on the other hand, offer a derivative token that can be traded or used in other DeFi protocols. This makes it a taxable event but also provides higher yield potential, with returns of up to 10% when combined with loans or liquidity mining.\n\nRequirements To Begin Ethereum Staking\n\nStaking Ethereum (ETH) not only provides you with the opportunity to earn rewards for contributing to the network, but it also enhances the network\u2019s security and sustainability. If you choose to stake solo, you can do so by establishing your own staking node and operating the software on your personal hardware. This method does not necessarily require you to provide personal information to a third-party service provider.\n\nOn the other hand, staking-as-a-service (SAAS) and pooled staking are alternative methods where you entrust your staking rights to a third-party service provider. This provider then oversees the staking process for you. In this scenario, you will typically need to set up an account with the service provider, which may necessitate the submission of personal data or maintaining a minimum balance.\n\nMinimum Deposit\n\nFor individual staking, you need a minimum deposit of 32 ETH, which is the requisite amount to operate a validator node on the Ethereum network. However, when it comes to pooled staking or staking through a staking-as-a-service platform, the minimum deposit requirement may not be fixed, as it depends on the specific exchange or wallet service you\u2019re using. Some of these services do not have a minimum deposit requirement, while others may necessitate a deposit ranging from as little as 0.1 ETH to 5 ETH worth of cryptocurrency.\n\nHow Profitable Is Ethereum 2.0 Staking?\n\nThe reward given to stakers is contingent on the total amount of ETH staked and the number of validators in the network. When the staked ETH pool decreases, the annual interest rate escalates. For instance, with only about 500,000 ETH staked, the annual interest rate (APR) was slightly above 20%.\n\nHowever, by August 2021, with over 6,800,000 ETH staked, the APR fell to approximately 6.0%. The interest rate diminishes once the staking pool is sufficiently large to foster a decentralized environment.\n\nFurthermore, staking Ethereum is advantageous as it simplifies node operation. It doesn\u2019t require substantial hardware or energy investments, and you can participate in staking pools if you lack sufficient ETH.\n\nStaking promotes decentralization and encourages broader participation. Unlike mining, adding more nodes doesn\u2019t increase profit percentages. Staking also facilitates secure sharding, which allows Ethereum to create multiple blocks simultaneously, speeding up transaction processing. In a proof-of-work system, sharding would decrease the power needed to compromise a network segment.\n\nConsiderations when selecting a Staking method\n\nWhen staking, several considerations, such as security, fees, and wallet quality, are paramount, as you\u2019ll be entrusting and immobilizing a significant amount of cryptocurrency, which could be a lure for hackers. Here\u2019s a breakdown of these considerations:\n\nSecurity: Staking entails the long-term lock-up of a substantial cryptocurrency amount, making it essential to opt for a platform with stringent security measures to avert potential losses.\n\nFees: The fees associated with staking can vary greatly across different wallets and exchanges, and they can considerably affect your staking profits. Thus, it\u2019s important to scrutinize the fees and choose a provider with reasonable rates.\n\nWallet Quality and Safety: Opting for a trustworthy wallet with a history of safety can provide an added layer of security and assurance when staking a large quantity of ETH.\n\nCustomer Service: Having access to timely and efficient customer service can facilitate a smoother and less daunting staking process, particularly if you face any challenges or have inquiries.\n\nValidator Uptime/Reliability: Validators, who are tasked with transaction processing and blockchain maintenance, should be dependable with a solid record of uptime and performance, as any downtime could result in forfeited rewards or financial losses.\n\nSpeed: Certain staking methods might be sluggish or have lengthy waiting periods before rewards are distributed. It\u2019s crucial to identify an efficient validator that ensures swift distribution of rewards to optimize returns and reduce waiting periods. If you can\u2019t locate one, you can operate your own node if you\u2019re well-versed in ETH staking.\n\nIs Staking Ethereum a Good Idea?\n\nIf you\u2019re considering a long-term investment in Ethereum, staking could be a beneficial strategy. The additional yield you gain can increase your total Ethereum holdings.\n\nHowever, staking may not always be the best option. It requires you to forfeit liquidity, as your Ethereum will be locked for several months.\n\nEven though protocols like Lido can provide some assistance, there\u2019s no assurance that market sentiments won\u2019t abruptly shift, potentially altering the stETH/ETH rate from its usual 1-to-1 ratio. The stablecoin market crash in May 2022 serves as a stark reminder of this risk.\n\nYour decision should primarily be based on your investment timeline and your readiness to retain Ethereum.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to remember that Ethereum, like all cryptocurrencies, is a highly volatile and risky investment that can rapidly change course. Therefore, before investing in Ethereum or any other cryptocurrency, it\u2019s essential to conduct thorough research and be prepared for the inherent volatility of such investments.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum 2.0 staking, post-merge, is a significant leap forward in the world of blockchain technology. It\u2019s a testament to Ethereum\u2019s commitment to innovation, scalability, and sustainability.\n\nThis transformative upgrade allows Ethereum holders to actively contribute to the network\u2019s security while earning rewards, fostering a more inclusive and participatory ecosystem.\n\nAs we move forward into this new era of Ethereum, the opportunities for growth and advancement are immense. The full implementation of Ethereum 2.0, with its staking feature, marks the beginning of a new chapter in the Ethereum journey, one that is sure to reshape the landscape of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. It\u2019s indeed an exciting time to be part of the Ethereum community as we stand on the brink of a new frontier in decentralized finance."

        "title": "Crypto news: Solana, Ethereum and Ripple - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Among the most popular and innovative crypto assets, Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) stand out for their technology and applications.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the latest news and prices of these three cryptocurrencies so as to understand the market trends that are affecting them.\n\nWe will analyze the unique characteristics of each cryptocurrency and assess the factors that may have contributed to the recent price movements.\n\nPrices and crypto market statistics of Solana, Ethereum, and Ripple\n\nLet\u2019s start with an analysis of the first asset, namely Solana, among the three is the one that has suffered the most from this momentary crisis, losing 27.7% of its value in just 7 days.\n\nAs of today, its current price is $15.58.\n\nCurrently, it has a market capitalization of about $6.2 billion, indicating its position among prominent cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe trading volume in the past 24 hours is $445.8 million, while Solana\u2019s circulating supply is about 398.8 million SOL, with an average holding time of 71 days.\n\nIn terms of popularity, Solana ranks seventh among the most well-known and widely used cryptocurrencies.\n\nSimilarly, Ethereum has suffered losses due to market conditions, leaving behind -6% of its value in one week. Its current price is $1,755.13.\n\nAs for market statistics, the capitalization is $210.7 billion, with a trading volume (in the last 24 hours) of $5.5 billion.\n\nThe token\u2019s circulating supply is 120.2 million ETH with an average holding time of 51 days.\n\nLast but not least is the XRP token, which despite a minimal decline of 3% in the last 7 days, is coming from a month of great growth, also dictated by the terms of the ongoing lawsuit with the SEC.\n\nThe current price is $0.52, with a market capitalization of $27 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $1.1 billion.\n\nRipple\u2019s circulating supply is currently 52 billion XRP.\n\nBut let\u2019s turn to the most recent news affecting the markets for these crypto assets.\n\nWhales go against the market and hold the Ethereum crypto\n\nEthereum (ETH) whales have defied market uncertainty by showing increased appetite for the cryptocurrency. In a surprising move amid price volatility, these large ETH holders have accumulated more tokens, signaling their confidence in the long-term potential of the Ethereum network.\n\nA notable example of this trend is a whale of a wallet that recently withdrew a significant amount of ETH from the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency trading platform, Binance.\n\nIn the past month, this wallet has moved nearly 39,300 tokens, a significant demonstration of their belief in Ethereum\u2019s future prospects.\n\nThis interesting development becomes even more noteworthy when one considers the context of significant price declines in the market.\n\nWhile many investors may have been discouraged by the recent volatility and uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies, Ethereum whales have chosen to view this situation as an opportunity rather than a setback.\n\nThe motivations of the whales with regard to Ethereum\n\nOne possible interpretation of this behavior is that these whales, with their extensive holdings and knowledge of the market, have a deeper understanding of the underlying factors affecting Ethereum\u2019s value.\n\nThey may have recognized that short-term price fluctuations do not necessarily reflect the long-term potential and value of the Ethereum network.\n\nIn addition, Ethereum\u2019s continued developments and upgrades, such as the implementation of Ethereum 2.0 and the growing adoption of decentralized finance applications (DeFi), have likely contributed to whale confidence.\n\nThese advances have the potential to further improve Ethereum\u2019s scalability, security, and utility, making it an attractive investment option for both private and institutional investors.\n\nIn addition, Ethereum\u2019s established position as the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, behind only Bitcoin, provides it with a solid foundation and broad recognition in the industry.\n\nThis, coupled with growing interest from institutional investors and mainstream adoption, has likely bolstered whales\u2019 confidence in the long-term value of ETH.\n\nThe Solana Foundation takes a determined stand against the SEC\n\nThe Solana Foundation responded to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a recent tweet, expressing its disagreement with the classification of its native cryptocurrency, SOL, as a security.\n\nThis announcement had a significant impact on SOL\u2019s value, dropping its price to $15.\n\nIn its response, the Solana Foundation made it clear that it firmly believes that SOL should not be considered a security.\n\nIt stressed that its blockchain and ecosystem are designed to enable decentralized applications and provide a solid infrastructure for developers, rather than serve as traditional security.\n\nIn addition, the foundation expressed a willingness to work with policymakers to establish legal clarity in the rapidly evolving realm of digital assets. It recognizes the importance of a regulatory framework that protects investors while promoting innovation and growth in the blockchain industry.\n\nThe disagreement between the Solana Foundation and the SEC highlights the ongoing debate over the classification of cryptocurrencies and their regulatory oversight.\n\nDifferent jurisdictions and regulatory bodies have different interpretations on how cryptocurrencies should be classified and regulated, leading to a complex and fragmented landscape.\n\nAlthough the SEC\u2019s classification may have initially caused a decline in SOL\u2019s value, it is important to note that regulatory actions and decisions can have both short-term and long-term impacts on cryptocurrencies.\n\nClear guidelines and favorable regulatory environments are key to instilling investor confidence and promoting wider adoption of digital assets."

        "title": "Chinese Bank BOCI Makes History with First Tokenized Security on Ethereum Blockchain - Inside Bitcoins",
        "content": "Don\u2019t invest unless prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nJoin Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage\n\nBOCI sent ripples across the digital asset community when it issued CNH 200 million worth of fully structured digital notes. This made the Chinese-owned investment bank the first institution to tokenize securities in Hong Kong.\n\nSupporting BOCI during this launch was the Switzerland-based financial advisory company UBS. UBS has a track record for digitizing securities after it issued and tokenized $50 million in December 2022.\n\nFollowing the major announcement, Deputy CEO at BOCI, Ms Ying Wang, explained, \u201cBOCI is very pleased to be at the forefront of innovation in technology finance and digital finance. \u201c\n\nWorking together with UBS, we are driving the simplification of digital asset markets and products, for customers in Asia Pacific through the development of blockchain-based digital structured products, designed specifically for customers in Asia Pacific. We are encouraged by the evolution of Hong Kong\u2019s digital economy and are committed to promoting the digital transformation and innovative development of Hong Kong\u2019s financial industry.\u201d\n\nWhy is BOCI\u2019s Investment Such a Big Deal?\n\nThe partnership between BOCI and UBS has opened doors for the adoption of more securities into digitally structured notes. But what benefit does this advancement have for the local investor or the layman?\n\nDigitized structured securities will improve financial innovation by a long shot. These new-age digital legal tenders are a perfect blend of fiat benefits wrapped around the power of blockchain systems. They will give retail investors easy access to derivatives and non-traditional payoffs.\n\nIn particular, BOCI\u2019s move has secured a digital CHN equivalent for the Asian Pacific region through the Ethereum blockchain. This means regional investors can enjoy a less-limiting and more enhanced monetary system with remarkably customized risk returns.\n\nConsequently, the Global Head of MTN Trading, Aurelian Troendle, commended the partnership\u2019s efforts, saying, \u201cHigh-frequency issuance activity can benefit from vast efficiency gains through blockchain technology, which will ultimately bring advantages to investors. UBS is excited to work with issuers like BOCI to broaden our client offering through our tokenization capabilities.\u201d\n\nFinancial Fact or Overhyped Fiction?\n\nDespite this promising outlook, crypto enthusiasts on Twitter seem rather uncertain that the BOCI has rolled out the tokens as they claim. Crypto fans are asking for Etherscan links and details of the individuals or entities that bought the notes.\n\nshow me the etherscan link or it didn\u2019t happen \u2014 PSY (@PSYTWEAK) June 12, 2023\n\nBOCI is yet to respond to these requests or provide digital proof of the process. However, this doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all made up. If anything, the drive to harness the power of blockchain systems is high, and a lot that was previously unimaginable is now possible.\n\nAbout BOCI and UBS\n\nBOCI Investment Bank is a full entity of the Bank of China. The firm offers overseas clients a range of investment banking services like financial advisory, corporate finance, private banking, mergers and acquisitions, securities, and sales.\n\nUBS is a Switzerland-based financial advisory company. The firm is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the SIX Swiss Exchange. It offers a range of solutions to individuals, institutions, and corporations on a global scale.\n\nSpecifically, UBS focuses on wealth management and capital efficiency for sustained structural growth and has a global footprint in over 50 regions across America, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.\n\nRelated News\n\nNew Crypto Mining Platform - Bitcoin Minetrix Rating Audited By Coinsult\n\nDecentralized, Secure Cloud Mining\n\nEarn Free Bitcoin Daily\n\nNative Token On Presale Now - BTCMTX\n\nStaking Rewards - Over 50% APY Learn More"
