        "title": "SEC Delays BlackRock's Spot Ethereum ETF Decision - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "SEC Delays BlackRock\u2019s Spot Ethereum ETF Decision\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed its decision on BlackRock's proposed spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF), citing the need for more time to review the proposed rule change. The delay, announced one day ahead of the January 25 deadline, marks the first of several delays the SEC can exercise across a 240-day period. This first deadline comes nearly 45 days after BlackRock filed for an iShares Ethereum Trust through Nasdaq on December 11.\n\nBlackRock's spot Ethereum ETF has a final deadline decision date of August 7, 2024. However, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes that a final decision will be made on all pending spot Ether ETFs in May, with the analyst giving a 70% chance of approval. May 23 is the earliest final deadline of all applicants, similar to the SEC's decision on 10 pending spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10. Other spot Ether ETF applications have final decision deadlines ranging from May 23 to August 3.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart expects to see more spot Ether ETF delays \"sporadically\" over the next few months. He also further emphasized the importance of May as the crucial decision date for Ether ETFs applications. The SEC's decision-making process for spot Ether ETFs is being closely watched by the cryptocurrency industry and investors alike. The approval of spot Ether ETFs would provide a more accessible and regulated way to invest in Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nHowever, the SEC's delay in deciding on BlackRock's spot Ether ETF proposal suggests that the Commission is taking a cautious approach to approving these products. The SEC's decision will likely depend on its assessment of the risks and benefits of spot Ether ETFs, as well as the adequacy of the proposed rule changes."

ETH is struggling to recover and might continue to move down toward the $2,000 support zone.\n\nEthereum started a fresh decline below the $2,350 and $2,250 levels.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair attempt a fresh increase if it clears the $2,240 and $2,280 levels.\n\nEthereum Price Extends Losses\n\nEthereum price remained in a bearish zone below the $2,400 pivot level. ETH extended its decline and traded below the $2,250 support level, like Bitcoin.\n\nIt even spiked below the $2,000 level. A new weekly low was formed near $2,165 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the $2,220 level. The price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,480 swing high to the $2,165 low.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,240 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nThe next hurdle could be $2,280, above which the price could aim for a decent recovery. The next major resistance is now near $2,360 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,480 swing high to the $2,165 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA clear move above the $2,360 level might start a decent increase.

        "content": "Image source: https://unsplash.com/photos/a-close-up-of-a-gold-coin-with-the-word-ether-on-it-gWoL3zunCZE\n\nEthereum had a tough time in 2023, dealing with considerable external pressures from regulatory authorities, as well as the collapse of exchanges and crypto-friendly banks that rocked the digital money environment to its core. Binance data shows that the coin has regained much of its former strength over the past couple of months, but a lot of work remains to be done. As Ethereum continues to recover bit by bit, here are some of the most critical changes in the system that could mean prices will continue to change.\n\nCensorship\n\nThe cryptocurrency world is best known for being a fully decentralized environment. That means that no single person or company owns all the data; instead, it is distributed across the different nodes in the system. In light of the recent talks about imposing stricter regulations on blockchains, many investors have discussed the possibility that this is the beginning of the end for the decentralized ledger. Many traders believe that the only reason regulations would ever be enforced is to keep the system under control and switch it to a more centralized model.\n\nSome are concerned that these shifts have already begun to happen for Ethereum. The US government recently sanctioned an Ethereum blockchain program allowing investors to perform transactions without leaving a trace. The OFAC claimed that the program was used by entities prohibited by the United States, including military organizations. Many investors criticized the motion while also saying that the Ethereum blockchain will likely remain immune due to its decentralized nature.\n\nHowever, it seems now that they weren\u2019t exactly correct, and at the moment, over 70% of data blocks are considered censored. That\u2019s an almost 30% increase compared to November 2022, when Ethereum was going through one of its lowest periods. Block builders generally have complete authority over the order of transactions and how they are arranged in blocks, meaning they decide on the blockchain content by default. Right now, Titan Builder is the only one claiming not to censor transactions, but if it did, that means Ethereum could reach 90% in censorship.\n\nRelayers\n\nThe relayers are third parties who operate software that moves transactions from the builders to the validators. Back in November 2022, the numbers showed that over 75% of them had ceased passing along transactions that official authorities had sanctioned. However, this is also due, at least partially, to the fact that there wasn\u2019t a large number of relayers at the time, and the ones in charge of the larger volumes were removing these transactions from the central system.\n\nAccording to the latest definitions, only 30% of relayed blocks remain censored as of December 2023. Five builders directly contribute to over 90% of the blocks on the Ethereum blockchain, of which four have chosen to edit transactions. Several operators have chosen to be more cautious, especially if they are US-based. Refusing to comply with the regulations could attract significant trouble for both the individuals and their businesses.\n\nSolana\n\nThe phrase \u201cEthereum killer\u201d has been used for a while now to designate the coins and blockchains that have the potential to remove Ethereum from its throne. While ETH was never able to withstand the sheer force of Bitcoin and surpass it, it is nonetheless the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum isn\u2019t known just as a coin but also for the functionalities its blockchain introduced. The system pioneered the discovery and introduction of decentralized finance and apps, as well as non-fungible tokens and the play-to-earn concept.\n\nThis has made it very popular among tech lovers who follow the latest developments religiously. So, who are the supposed Ethereum killers that could replace it? The truth is that different investors and analysts will say different things, with each of them betting on a different coin and platform. However, Solana is probably the most widely discussed of all of them, mainly because it is much more visible and stable than the others.\n\nOne of its co-founders, Anatoly Yakovenko, recently dismissed these claims, saying that the dynamic between the two coins isn\u2019t what it has been made out to be and that it is essential to continue incorporating efficient technologies. Many in the crypto community believe that a multi-chain future is inevitable. Rather than seeing competition as something negative, the outlook instead is to see it as part of the more extensive evolution parameters of the blockchains.\n\nIn fact, some have already begun discussing the existence and emergence of a Solana killer. It\u2019s good for blockchains to collaborate and co-exist, as it shows the system\u2019s potential to continue growing and evolving, as well as expanding to cover different business areas and niches apart from crypto trading.\n\nPrice predictions\n\n2024 is just around the corner, and investors are debating which outcome is the most likely when it comes to the coins they\u2019re trading. There are several price prospects for Ethereum, and whether they\u2019ll occur and when is bound to change due to the different influences that affect the crypto environment. The market trends point towards a bullish upswing set to occur sooner rather than later, and many investors have already started buying more to consolidate their portfolios and see more considerable gains when the prices rise.\n\nHowever, the economic factors and regulatory issues can act as setbacks. The price has been affected by macro factors, especially inflation and interest rates. Even if they didn\u2019t directly cause prices to collapse, they nonetheless caused market stagnation, which affected holdings and caused considerable apprehension among investors. There\u2019s also the possibility that Ethereum could surpass Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization, but that will largely depend on the network updates, as well as whether adoption rates continue to increase or not.\n\nTo sum up, many variables could influence how Ethereum will develop in the next year. That makes it impossible to predict the movements accurately. However, this has always been the case for blockchain currencies, and the investors who have been involved in the market for a few years are already familiar with these shifts. Make sure to carefully weigh your options before buying or selling to ensure you see gains and minimize losses."

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) extended the decision period on BlackRock\u2019s planned spot Ethereum ETF on Jan. 24.\n\nThat notice concerns a proposed rule change allowing Nasdaq to list and trade shares of the BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust.\n\nPreviously, the SEC was required to approve, reject, or institute proceedings to approve or reject BlackRock\u2019s proposal by Jan. 25, 2024. However, securities laws permit the agency to extend the decision period to March 10, 2024.\n\nThe SEC noted Nasdaq initially filed the proposed rule change on Nov. 21, 2023 and that the proposal was published for comment in the Federal Register on Dec. 11, 2023. The date of publication determines the deadlines described above.\n\nThe SEC added that it has not received any comments on BlackRock\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF proposal. By contrast, BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF proposal received about 15 comments within two months of its June 2023 filing.\n\nSEC still expected to make decision in May\n\nThe delay around BlackRock is not expected to affect broader Ethereum ETF proceedings. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said today:\n\n\u201cSpot Ethereum ETF Delays will continue to happen sporadically over the next few months. [The] next date that matters is May 23rd.\u201d\n\nMay 23 is relevant as the SEC must approve or deny VanEck\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF by that date without any possibility of further delays. The securities regulator will likely decide on other similar applications with different deadlines, including BlackRock\u2019s, alongside VanEck\u2019s application at that time.\n\nThe SEC similarly delayed proceedings around Fidelity\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF this month. Once again, this will not impact the May decision deadline.\n\nThough it is required to make a decision by May 23, it is unclear whether the SEC will opt to approve the funds. FOX Business\u2019 Eleanor Terrett has reported internal resistance at the SEC while suggesting that some ETF issuers are optimistic.\n\nPolymarket odds currently suggest a 54% chance of approval by May 31. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas predicts a 70% chance of approval."

As Ethereum has grown, the limit for validator entries and exits has also increased. Looking ahead, Galaxy says Ethereum developers may need to \u201cweigh drastic changes\u201d to staking dynamics and monetary policy in 2024 if the network experiences a surge in usage, resulting in increased transactions and staking demand.\n\nRead more: Coinbase to address Ethereum client diversity woes\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

Kohn\u2019s research points to a significant increase of over 20% in Ethereum\u2019s value compared to Bitcoin, a trend that aligns with a renewed surge in the Ethereum derivatives market.\n\nETH Resurgence Fuels ETF Speculation, SOL Defies Odds\n\nThe recent resurgence in Ethereum\u2019s market performance, as highlighted in Glassnode\u2019s report, suggests a potential shift in capital flows within the crypto market, sparking increased speculation about the possible introduction of a spot-based Ethereum ETF.\n\nDespite these positive developments, Ethereum still lags behind the broader altcoin market, underperforming by 17%. In contrast, Solana (SOL) has followed a distinct trajectory. According to the same Glassnode report , Solana experienced remarkable price growth last year, overcoming challenges related to its association with the troubled FTX. This divergence in the paths of Ethereum and Solana illustrates the varied dynamics at play in the altcoin market.\n\n@Solana 's December month-over-month NFT volume growth outpaced other ecosystems significantly: pic.twitter.com/wBr2n3itNU \u2014 Syndica \u26c5\ufe0f (@Syndica_io) January 22, 2024\n\nIn striking contrast to Ethereum, Solana (SOL) has shown remarkable performance, with the SOL/BTC ratio soaring by 290% since October 2023. This divergence is particularly noteworthy as Solana\u2019s price did not undergo a significant revaluation following the Bitcoin ETF approvals, unlike Ethereum, according to Kohn.\n\nOverall, the altcoin market has experienced substantial growth, witnessing a nearly 69% increase in market capitalization since the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF filing, highlighting a general uptrend in the altcoin sector, with Solana leading the way.\n\nAltcoin Season in Full Swing as Top 50 Coins Outperform BTC\n\nRecently, Altcoin Season Index signaled the start of an \u2018altseason\u2019. This trend continues with the top 50 altcoins surpassing Bitcoin\u2019s performance over the last 90 days, as per the index.\n\nKohn pointed out that this uptrend is largely fueled by tokens associated with Ethereum scaling solutions like Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon. Additionally, the early part of 2023 saw tokens in staking and GameFi sectors also exceeding Bitcoin\u2019s performance, highlighting a diverse risk preference among investors in various altcoin categories.\n\nKohn\u2019s latest research underscored the significant impact of recent market events:\n\n\u201cThe approval of new Bitcoin ETFs has morphed into a classic \u2018sell-the-news\u2019 occurrence, stirring a volatile period in the crypto market.\u201d\n\nGlassnode\u2019s analysis reveals that Ethereum has come out on top in the short term, with investors achieving a multi-year peak in net realized profits. This trend indicates an increasing propensity among investors to participate in speculative activities, especially related to the potential launch of an ETH ETF and the rotation of capital.\n\nSolana\u2019s Explosive Price Growth: A Sign of Ethereum\u2019s Challenger?\n\nIn addition to a significant increase in its total value locked (TVL), Solana has also witnessed a staggering 800% surge in its price on a year-to-date basis. When compared to Ethereum, Solana has shown superior price growth; Ethereum\u2019s year-to-date growth stands at just 94% . This contrast is also mirrored in the TVL charts, where Solana\u2019s growth, although substantial, still falls behind Ethereum\u2019s, which remains the world\u2019s premier altcoin in terms of TVL. However, it\u2019s important to note that relying solely on TVL as a metric can be misleading, as it may offer a false sense of accuracy and can be easily manipulated.\n\nIn the ring of blockchain, it's #Ethereum vs #Solana ! \ud83e\udd4a \ud83c\udf52 #ETH : King of #DeFi & #NFTs \ud83c\udff0\n\n\ud83c\udf52 #SOL : Speed demon with lower fees \ud83d\ude80 Which blockchain has your vote for the future of crypto?

It is often viewed as a faster, more cost-effective alternative to Ethereum, with an added advantage of superior user interface and experience. The extent of actual development and building on the blockchain is a key factor in increasing TVL, potentially propelling Solana to greater prominence in the crypto world."

Consequently, the \u2018Ethereum bearish\u2018 message is suddenly found everywhere which is in contrast to the sentiment and messaging two weeks ago.\n\nWhile some \u2018pundits\u2019 may come out to call for the end of Bitcoin\u2019s bull market, similarly the end of Ethereum\u2019s bull market, we have a different view.\n\nPreviously, we outlined why Ethereum could still reach $10,000 by 2025, though will probably reach the $3,000 \u2013 $4,000 region in 2024. We stand by this view.\n\nSome commentators have a different opinion, indicating that Ethereum could be a bearish asset in 2024, though such claims are largely unsubstantiated.\n\nThe problems with poor quality chart analysis\n\nThe issue with low-quality chart analysis is mainly with the timeframe. In the chart below, there are no structured price patterns and the content is short-term orientated. It\u2019s basically impossible to make a reasoned analysis by looking at a single chart \u2013 especially an intraday one!\n\nYet the fallacies contained within the analysis are not apparent to viewers when reading the content. It\u2019s also possible to take a different view on the same chart and draw an entirely different conclusion. Ideally, a lot of factors will converge to create a powerful signal (bullish or bearish).\n\nPractically all of the content regarding Ethereum on this Trading View blog is erroneous, indicating a drop to $700 for Ethereum. We find that highly unlikely and the charts simply don\u2019t back it up, even amidst a declining overall market.\n\nDespite the majority of false claims, there is some sound analysis. This Ethereum technical prediction outlines that despite a bearish outlook in the near term, Ethereum has a strong potential for a bullish reversal in 2024.\n\nEthereum is not bearish in 2024\n\nThe fact of the matter is that Ethereum is not bearish at all in 2024, and that\u2019s in spite of the Bitcoin retracement which we predicted in this altcoin season article. Our exact words were:\n\nArguably, before alt season 2024 will kick off, it might come with a drop in BTC. In a way, it makes sense that an explosive run starts with a drop. The market loves to mislead bulls, particularly at the start and end of bull markets\n\nWe predict an ETH price rise to $10,000 by 2025, and that\u2019s based on sound chart analysis. Take a look at the daily chart.\n\nThe price to hit for this to occur is $3,525. After this, it would be a 3x to $10k. The weekly price chart indicates a similar price rise for ETH, with a rounded reversal bullish pattern.\n\nDon\u2019t believe the headlines! Ethereum is unlikely to go to $700. And it\u2019s likely to end 2024 at a high, possibly even an all-time high. After all, as we keep repeating, 2024 is a hidden crypto bull market in disguise, with a fake drop to fool investors.\n\nTo truly understand what the market is doing, we have a unique crypto investment newsletter dedicated to finding the best coins at the most optimal entry points.

Next date that matters is May 23rd,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart said.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThe decision comes just weeks after the SEC approved nearly a dozen spot bitcoin ETFs. Three commissioners \u2014 Hester Peirce, Mark Uyeda and Chair Gary Gensler \u2014 voted in favor of the ETFs.\n\nFollowing Grayscale\u2019s legal victory in August, the SEC was compelled to reevaluate its application for a spot bitcoin ETF conversion. Despite this progress, the status of ether ETFs continues to be unclear.\n\nIn an interview on Tuesday, Peirce said that the SEC would \u201capply precedent\u201d to any decisions on spot ether ETFs. She further noted that the agency doesn\u2019t plan to repeat history and face another court case in order to approve such funds.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not holding my breath,\u201d Lara Crigger, editor-in-chief at VettaFi previously told Blockworks about ether ETF approval.\n\nHowever, Seyffart previously said that he was more bullish about the future of ether ETFs.\n\n\u201cIf [Gensler] goes after ETH, it\u2019s not just going to be a lot of these industry players; it will also be the CFTC that he has to contend with, and it\u2019s just not worth it,\u201d he told On the Margin podcast.The delay was largely expected after the SEC also delayed Fidelity\u2019s proposal\n\nIn his press release following bitcoin ETF approvals, Gensler noted that the decision \u201cshould in no way signal the Commission\u2019s willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Ethereum execution client Geth has seen its market share fall after community members raised concerns over the network\u2019s diversity, fearing Geth\u2019s concentration could lead to a \u201cblack swan event.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 23, Geth\u2019s market share of the Ethereum network execution clients fell 5.2% to 78.8% after reaching 84% the day prior.\n\nGeth is critical in handling transactions and executing smart contracts on Ethereum, but its preference among Ethereum validators has led to an imbalance in execution client diversity on Ethereum, sparking centralization concerns.\n\nPercentage share of Ethereum network execution clients. Source: Clientdiversity.org\n\nEthereum decentralization advocates, including the founding member of the ETHStaker community, known as \u201cSuperphiz,\u201d stressed in a Jan. 24 post on X (formerly Twitter) that a bug in Geth could lead to a more than 80% wipeout of Ether (ETH) staked on the network.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to convince you that every execution client is as robust or as mature as Geth. I\u2019m just telling you that it\u2019s a good idea to use less robust clients to prevent a black swan event,\u201d he explained in another post.\n\nLachlan Feeney, founder and CEO of Ethereum infrastructure firm Labrys, suggested in a Jan. 23 blog post that Ethereum validators could risk losing everything.\n\n\u201cStaked ETH is not risk-free yield. Would you invest a minimum of $75,000 USD into an instrument where the maximum potential gain is 3.5% p.a. but the potential for loss is 100%?\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably not, but this is what 84% of the Ethereum stakers are doing today,\u201d Feeney added.\n\nAs Geth\u2019s current share exceeds 2/3rds (or 66%), Feeney said a critical bug would \u201cinstantly stop the chain from finalizing.\u201d\n\nIn that scenario, Geth validators that go offline would be subject to an \u201cinactivity leak,\u201d which results in the burning of their staked Ether until the execution recalibrates to a 1/3rd (or 33.3%) share of the network.\n\nFeeney said 90% of a validator\u2019s staked Ether could be wiped within roughly 40 days.\n\n\u201cComparatively, a validator taken offline due to a minority client bug that does not stop the chain from finalizing would lose just 0.4% of its stake in 40 days.\u201d\n\nHowever, Feeney told Cointelegraph there would be a \u201cvery small window\u201d for validators to exit and limit their losses, as there is a rate-limited queue for how many validators can exit per epoch.\n\nRelated: Ethereum devs expect 10x lower rollup costs as Dencun upgrade hits testnets\n\nNethermind, the second-largest execution client, increased its share from around 8% to 14% on Jan. 23.\n\nNethermind\u2019s increased uptake came despite it identifying and fixing a critical bug in several versions of its execution client that caused users to fail to process blocks on Ethereum two days earlier.\n\nCoinbase, one of the largest Ethereum validators running on Geth, announced its plan to transition to a multi-client infrastructure in the coming months.\n\nThe exchange explained Geth was the only Ethereum execution client that met its technical requirements since it started Ethereum staking in 2020.\n\n\u201cHowever, the tide is turning,\u201d said Coinbase.\n\nMagazine: Ethereum restaking: Blockchain innovation or dangerous house of cards?"

Despite SEC Chair Gensler\u2019s assertion that the Bitcoin ETF approval does not signify the embrace of crypto assets, investors are optimistic about the approval setting a precedent substantial enough to impact its consideration of spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nAs the industry anticipates the potential outcome, \u201ccrypto mom\u201d Hester Peirce, renowned for her liberty-focused approach to the industry, has offered insights into the commission\u2019s decision-making process.\n\nEthereum ETF Won\u2019t Get \u2018Circus-Like\u2019 Approach\n\nSEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has expressed optimism about a balanced decision-making process for Ethereum ETF, asserting that the regulatory commission is unlikely to adhere strictly to its traditional stringent approach.\n\nPeirce emphasized that the \u201ccircus-like\u201d consideration process witnessed for Bitcoin ETFs, characterized by legal battles, extensive delays, and security breaches, will not reoccur in the case of Ethereum ETFs.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t need a court to tell us that our approach is arbitrary and capricious in order for us to get it right,\u201d she stated in an interview with Zack Guzman.\n\nReflecting on her past frustrations with the delays in approving Bitcoin ETFs, Peirce underscored the importance of providing choices to investors in the spirit of liberty and asserted the need for clear thinking and consideration in enforcing regulations on the industry.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of things that we can draw on, and I hope that we draw in more than just our general skepticism of anything that touches on crypto, which seems to be how we've approached a lot of these problems in the past,\u201d she emphasized.\n\nHester Peirce\u2019s sentiments align with industry predictions on the likelihood of an approval.\n\nEthereum ETF: Approval or Not?\n\nBusiness journalist Eleanor Terrett has shared varying perspectives on whether the SEC will approve Ethereum ETFs and when the regulatory decision is expected.\n\nTerret stated that there is prevailing optimism among issuers and analysts, forecasting the approval and launch of Bitcoin ETFs to influence the SEC\u2019s decision-making process regarding Ethereum ETFs positively.\n\nReporting on the timeline for a potential $ETH ETF approval has turned up a plethora of different takes from ETF issuers, investment management firms and sources close to the @SECGov.\n\n\n\n\u2728One $BTC Spot ETF issuer with an ETH Spot ETF application says they\u2019re confident the\u2026 \u2014 Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 23, 2024\n\nContrasting opinions, however, challenge the optimism. Other predictions suggest a \u201chard no\u201d within the regulatory commission, indicating internal resistance to endorsing the ETFs.\n\nETF analyst James Seyffart anticipates a 5-month consideration process for the SEC and has predicted May as a plausible timeframe for the commission\u2019s verdict.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nWhile Hester Peirce\u2019s comments express optimism for Ethereum ETFs, they do not guarantee the SEC\u2019s approval.\n\nThe SEC recently extended its decision deadline for Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum ETF application by 45 days.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink is bullish on the potential of Ethereum, further fueling expectations for an imminent ETF approval.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nDespite varying forecasts on the fate of Ethereum ETFs, the final decision lies with the SEC.

This pales in comparison to Polygon's meteoric rise \u2013 it onboarded over 15 million new users last year, almost rivaling Ethereum's growth.\n\nEthereum still led overall with 15.4 million new users in 2023. But Polygon followed closely behind with 15.2 million, despite being a layer-2 network built on Ethereum.\n\nIn contrast, Base saw an initial spike of enthusiasm fizzle out into sluggish adoption. On the bright side, it now faces competition from alternative layer-2s with more mature ecosystems like Arbitrum (7.3 million 2023 users).\n\nAs one of Ethereum's most prominent scaling solutions, Polygon's explosive user growth demonstrates the immense potential of layer-2 technology. By delivering faster and cheaper transactions, it serves as a blueprint for how Base could also take advantage of Ethereum's mainstream adoption.\n\nBut Polygon had a multi-year head start in building its developer ecosystem compared to the Base network."

        "content": "The price of Ether (ETH) rallied 77% in the lead-up to the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, setting a year-to-date high at $2,715. But in the weeks since, ETH price has turned soft alongside the rest of the market.\n\nThe latest data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode shows that despite the current downturn, Ether has outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) in multiple areas.\n\nETH eclipses BTC\n\nGlassnode\u2019s latest \u201cThe Week Onchain\u201d report highlights ETH\u2019s outperformance of Bitcoin \u201con a quarterly, monthly, and weekly basis.\u201d\n\nAnalyst Alice Kohn points to a significant surge of over 20% in Ether\u2019s value against Bitcoin, a trend that aligns with similar activity in the ETH derivatives market.\n\nETH/BTC ratio price performance. Source: Glassnode\n\nGlassnode notes that this performance coincides with a rebound in ETH\u2019s market dominance. According to the chart below, ETH has gained 2.9% in market cap dominance compared with Bitcoin since the spot BTC ETF approval.\n\nETH vs. BTC market cap dominance. Source: Glassnode\n\nPositive market sentiment reflected in ETH\u2019s net unrealized profit/loss metric\n\nEther may be trading 14% lower over the last week, but market sentiment around the cryptocurrency remains positive. This is evidenced by the volume of net profits locked in by ETH investors, which has reached a new multiyear high, signaling significant changes in investor profitability.\n\nKohn said:\n\n\u201cWhile profits taking has increased since mid-October, the peak on 13-Jan reached over $900M/day, aligned with investors capitalising on the \u2018sell-the-news\u2019 momentum.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most significant indicator supporting Ether\u2019s positive sentiment is the net unrealized profit/loss (NUPL) metric for short-term tokenholders.\n\nNUPL gauges the potential profit or loss of investors holding an asset based on the price at which they acquired their coins.\n\nThis metric has crossed above 0.25 for the first time since the November 2021 all-time high, indicating increasing optimism among holders.\n\nEthereum short-term holder NUPL.

A closer look at derivatives data reveals that Bitcoin\u2019s perpetual swaps accounted for 55% of open interest in January 2022, which has since risen to 66.2%.\n\nIn comparison, \u201cETH open interest dominance decreased from 45% to 33.8% between 2022 and 2024,\u201d according to Glassnode.\n\nBTC vs. ETH perpetual open interest dominance.

        "content": "The SEC has postponed its decision on BlackRock's proposed Ethereum ETF to March 10, 2024. This reflects the regulator's cautious approach toward crypto-based investment products and highlights the need for clearer regulatory frameworks in the digital assets space.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its decision on BlackRock's proposed spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF), a move that echoes the regulator's cautious approach toward cryptocurrency-based investment products. This decision, announced just a day before the initial deadline of January 25, 2024, marks a significant moment in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency regulation and investment.\n\nThe application for the iShares Ethereum Trust was filed by Nasdaq on behalf of BlackRock on November 21, 2023, and was published for comment in the Federal Register on December 11, 2023\u200b\u200b. The SEC, under Section 19(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act, had a 45-day window to make a decision, which could be extended up to 90 days if deemed necessary\u200b\u200b. The Commission has now designated March 10, 2024, as the new deadline to either approve, disapprove, or initiate proceedings to ascertain the appropriateness of the proposed rule change\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nThis delay is part of a broader trend of postponements by the SEC concerning cryptocurrency ETFs. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart noted that such delays are expected to continue sporadically over the coming months, with significant attention focused on May 23rd as a key date for further decisions on spot Ether ETF applications\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe SEC's cautious stance is indicative of the broader regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies. While some industry insiders like Mathew McDermott, Global Head of Digital Assets at Goldman Sachs, remain optimistic about eventual approval, others like Morgan Creek Capital CEO Mark Yusko express skepticism, citing the SEC's generally hostile attitude toward the crypto industry\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe implications of these delays are far-reaching. Investors and market watchers are keenly observing the SEC's moves, as they could set precedents for future cryptocurrency-related financial products. The decision-making process also highlights the ongoing debate about the classification and regulation of cryptocurrencies as securities, a topic that has been at the forefront of discussions in the crypto and financial sectors.\n\nIn conclusion, the SEC's postponement of its decision on BlackRock's Ethereum ETF reflects the regulator's careful approach in dealing with crypto-based investment products. This move, while causing a stir in the cryptocurrency community, underscores the need for clearer regulatory frameworks and guidelines to navigate the complex and evolving world of digital assets.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Bitcoin ETF\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed ruling on spot Ethereum ETF applications by Grayscale Investments and BlackRock Inc., the agency said in regulatory filings on successive days.\n\nThe agency said Thursday it would need more time to decide on Grayscale\u2019s proposal to convert its Ethereum Trust product into an ETF. The filing followed a similar announcement by the regulator on Wednesday to extend its deliberations on a BlackRock Ethereum ETF product by 45 days.\n\nThe Commission is instituting proceedings to allow for additional analysis,\u201d the SEC said in its Grayscale filing, noting that its decision was consistent with securities law \"\u2018designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices'\" and \"'to protect investors and the public interest.\u2019\u201d\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF products are based primarily on the price of ether, the world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization behind bitcoin. Grayscale and BlackRock filed their Ethereum applications last fall amid rising investor optimism that the SEC was looking more favorably at spot crypto products. On Jan. 10, the regulator approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBlackRock, Grayscale Ethereum ETFs\n\nAs the SEC neared a decision on those applications, it met frequently with issuers and exchanges on which the products would be traded to address concerns about investor safety. How far the regulator\u2019s thinking has progressed at this point was unclear from the filings, although it seemed to encourage public input in its Grayscale filing.\n\n\u201cWhat are commenters\u2019 views on whether the proposed Trust and Shares would be susceptible to manipulation?,\u201d the SEC said. \u201cWhat are commenters\u2019 views generally on whether the Exchange\u2019s proposal is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices? What are commenters\u2019 views generally with respect to the liquidity and transparency of the ETH markets and the ETH markets\u2019 susceptibility to manipulation?\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum is a smart contracts blockchain platform used by software developers to build their projects, while bitcoin is primarily used as currency.\n\nEther and bitcoin were both trading flat over the past 24 hours, with ETH perched at about $2,220 and BTC at around $39,900. Major cryptocurrencies have struggled since the spot bitcoin approvals.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com. All rights reserved"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nHester Peirce believes that spot Ether ETFs will not require legal action to be approved.\n\nSeveral major players are vying for SEC approval for their spot Ether ETF applications.\n\nThere are mixed expectations for spot Ether ETF approval, with some experts optimistic and others cautious.\n\nAccording to SEC Commissioner Hester \u201cCrypto Mom\u201d Peirce, legal action won\u2019t be necessary to persuade the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to greenlight applications for spot Ether ETFs.\n\nShe emphasized that the regulator has taken lessons from its past errors, suggesting that the introduction of these products might proceed more seamlessly.\n\nPeirce Notes Nuances In Judging Each Ether ETF Application\n\nPeirce referenced the Grayscale court ruling, which set a precedent for the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., stating:\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t need a court to tell us that our approach is \u2018arbitrary and capricious\u2019 in order for us to get it right.\u201d\n\nHester Peirce, often referred to as \u201cCrypto Mom\u201d due to her relatively favorable view towards cryptocurrencies, mentioned that the SEC is likely to use the same precedent set by the Grayscale case in future considerations.\n\nHowever, she recognized that the specifics and context can differ greatly with each ETF application, indicating a nuanced approach to each case.\n\nShe commented :\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work that goes into getting an exchange-traded product ready for market, including making sure that the disclosures are lining up with how the product actually works. Having heard from a court that the approach we were taking was wrong [\u2026] I think that kind of a lesson will certainly stick with us.\u201d\n\nBlackRock, VanEck, ARK 21Shares, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, Grayscale, and Hashdex are among the key players seeking SEC approval for their spot Ether ETF applications. Eric Balchunas, a Senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, recently estimated a 70% chance of approval for a spot Ether ETF by May.\n\nEthereum ETFs: Anticipation Builds As Deadlines Approach\n\nThe SEC has specific deadlines for deciding on these applications. VanEck\u2019s application is due by May 23, followed by ARK 21Shares on May 24, Hashdex by May 30, Grayscale by June 18, and Invesco\u2019s decision is due by July 5. Meanwhile, the applications from Fidelity and BlackRock are slated for decisions by August 3 and August 7, respectively.\n\nNew deadline to obsess over just dropped May 23rd is the final deadline for decision on VanEck\u2019s spot ETH ETF pic.twitter.com/dgi5EVbPeQ \u2014 Will (@WClementeIII) January 10, 2024\n\nBalchunas expressed a strong likelihood of Ether ETFs receiving approval, especially in the wake of spot Bitcoin ETFs being approved. He finds it hard to envision a scenario where Ether ETFs wouldn\u2019t be approved given the precedent set by Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nHe stated :\n\n\u201cThe Ether spot is tied to the hip of Bitcoin spot for sure. It\u2019s gonna go wherever it goes. It\u2019s basically like on a 15-foot rope following it.\u201d\n\nExperts Divided on SEC\u2019s Spot Ether ETF Outlook\n\nDespite the optimistic outlook from some, not all industry experts share the same sentiment regarding the approval of spot Ether ETFs. Mark Yusko, the CEO of Morgan Creek Capital, is less hopeful , estimating the chances of approval at below 50%. He commented that the SEC maintains a generally adversarial stance towards the crypto industry, which could impact the approval process.\n\nAnd how likely is the approval of a Spot Ethereum ETF by year's end? \ud83e\udd14 Find out in our latest interview with Mark Yusko, Founder, CEO & CIO of Morgan Creek Capital. \ud83d\udcac\n\nClick the link below and dive into the game-changing world of Spot Bitcoin ETF approval \u2013 from market dynamics\u2026 pic.twitter.com/yjPnrVLKl9 \u2014 Cindy (@Natasha1s2K4) January 17, 2024\n\nThis perspective is somewhat echoed by SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who emphasized in a letter dated January 11 that the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF should not be interpreted as a blanket endorsement for other cryptocurrency ETF applications.\n\nGensler specifically stated :\n\n\u201c[The spot Bitcoin ETF approval] should in no way signal the Commission\u2019s willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities.\u201d\n\nThis comment suggests a cautious and case-by-case approach to the approval of cryptocurrency-related products by the SEC.\n\nHe commented :\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve said in the past, and without prejudging any one crypto asset, the vast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts and thus subject to the federal securities laws.\u201d\n\nBitcoin ETF Approval Opens Doors for Ethereum\u2019s Spot ETF Bid\n\nThe fact is, while BTC is primarily seen as a store of value, ETH serves as a functional currency, facilitating transactions on its highly composable chain. Despite their operational differences, ETH\u2019s spot ETF approval remains a possibility. The growing liquidity crunch in global markets is being addressed by institutional demand for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which is moving into wallets.\n\nThe debate over ETH\u2019s security status becomes irrelevant once it transforms into an ETF, similar to many existing commodity ETFs. With BTC\u2019s ETF approval, cryptocurrency has entered TradFi and is poised for institutional integration, paving the way for broader acceptance and potential approval of a spot ETH ETF."

However, the agency has now opted to use its authority to extend the review period. The process began with Nasdaq\u2019s initial filing of the proposed rule change on November 21, 2023, followed by the proposal\u2019s publication for public comment in the Federal Register on December 11, 2023.\n\nJUST IN: \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 SEC delays BlackRock's Spot Ethereum ETF. \u2014 Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) January 24, 2024\n\nInterestingly, the SEC pointed out that it has not received any public comments on the BlackRock Ethereum ETF proposal. This contrasts with the response to BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF proposal, which garnered about 15 comments within two months of its filing in June 2023. This delay in the decision highlights the \u2018been there \u2013 done that\u2019 situation that includes ongoing scrutiny and regulatory considerations surrounding cryptocurrency ETFs in the U.S. market.\n\nSEC\u2019s Decision on Ethereum ETFs Expected by May, Despite Delays\n\nThe SEC\u2019s recent delay concerning BlackRock\u2019s application is not anticipated to impact the overall timeline for Ethereum ETF decisions. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart remarked that we can expect sporadic delays in spot Ethereum ETF decisions over the next few months, but the key date is May 23rd.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF Delays will continue to happen sporadically over the next few months. Next date that matters is May 23rd https://t.co/2zBBvHkrVk \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 24, 2024\n\nThis date is crucial as it is the deadline for the SEC to approve or reject VanEck\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF application. Around this time, the SEC is also likely to make decisions on other similar applications, including BlackRock\u2019s.\n\nThe SEC has also postponed proceedings on Fidelity\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF earlier this month. However, these delays will not affect the critical May deadline for a decision. Despite the requirement to reach a verdict by May 23, there is still uncertainty about the SEC\u2019s stance on approving these funds.\n\nFOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett recently highlighted internal resistance within the SEC but noted optimism among some ETF issuers.\n\nReporting on the timeline for a potential $ETH ETF approval has turned up a plethora of different takes from ETF issuers, investment management firms and sources close to the @SECGov . \u2728One $BTC Spot ETF issuer with an ETH Spot ETF application says they\u2019re confident the\u2026 \u2014 Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 23, 2024\n\nCurrent odds from Polymarket indicate a 54% likelihood of approval by May 31.

Ethereum\u2019s distinctive characteristics, which do not align neatly with traditional investment categories, add complexity to the approval process.\n\nThis skepticism is shared by analysts at JPMorgan, who point out the uncertainty in how the SEC will categorize Ethereum \u2013 whether as a standard commodity or otherwise \u2013 in its upcoming May decision.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 The delay could affect the other spot #Ethereum ETF applications that have deadlines from May 23 to August 3, 2024 pic.twitter.com/hJ86Yeeff1 \u2014 Budhil Vyas (@BudhilVyas) January 25, 2024\n\nEthereum ETF As a Sign of Growing Crypto Adoption\n\nThe concept behind the proposed investment vehicle is to offer investors exposure to Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. In a recent CNBC interview, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink expressed his support for an Ethereum ETF. He stated that he sees \u201cvalue in having an Ethereum ETF\u201d and views the approval of such funds as \u201cjust stepping stones towards tokenization\u201d.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF received approval on January 10 and commenced trading the following day. Among the 10 ETFs now trading, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, managed by BlackRock, has been particularly successful. It boasts $1.7 billion in assets under management, underscoring the growing interest and trust in cryptocurrency-based investment products."

        "content": "Ethereum, the linchpin of the decentralized application ecosystem, finds itself navigating a precarious path this week. The cryptocurrency\u2019s value, having breached the pivotal $2,250 support level, now teeters on the edge of a decisive crossroads, caught between the prospect of a resurgence and the looming threat of a more pronounced downturn.\n\nAnalyzing the technical landscape reveals a cautious narrative, as ominous bearish trendlines emerge on the hourly charts of the Kraken exchange, while a resilient resistance at $2,240 presents a formidable obstacle.\n\nEthereum: Uphill Battle And Key Levels To Watch\n\nThe journey to reclaim lost ground demands a Herculean effort from Ethereum, necessitating the conquering of the initial hurdle at $2,240 and then engaging in a formidable battle against the $2,280 resistance. The digital asset\u2019s fate hangs in the balance, with the outcome likely to shape its trajectory in the coming days.\n\nETH price action in the last week. Source: Coingecko\n\nHowever, should Ethereum stumble in this uphill climb, a safety net awaits at $2,200, providing a temporary buffer against a further decline to $2,000.\n\nBut amidst the technical turmoil, a ray of sunshine pierces through the clouds. Market sentiment around Ethereum remains surprisingly upbeat. Despite the price dip, the volume of net profits locked in by ETH investors has hit a multi-year high, suggesting a shift in focus from short-term gains to long-term holding.\n\nEthereum\u2019s High-Wire Act: Key Metrics\n\nThis newfound patience is further corroborated by the skyrocketing net unrealized profit/loss (NUPL) metric for short-term token-holders. This figure, reflecting the potential profitability of investors based on their purchase price, has for the first time since the November 2021 all-time high, surpassed 0.25, signifying a surge in confidence among those who recently acquired ETH.\n\nEthereum currently trading at $2,220 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nThe current scenario resembles a high-wire act, except the stakes are considerably higher. Technical charts flash cautionary signals, but market sentiment whispers sweet nothings of optimism. Whether Ethereum finds its footing and ascends, or takes a misstep and plummets, remains to be seen.\n\nAt A Glance\n\nEthereum faces near-term technical challenges with resistance points at $2,240 and $2,280.\n\nSupport lies at $2,200 and $2,165, with a breach below $2,000 a possibility.\n\nDespite the price dip, market sentiment around Ethereum remains positive.\n\nRecord-high net profits locked in and rising NUPL for short-term holders suggest long-term optimism.\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s path forward remains shrouded in uncertainty, the technical picture paints a potentially bleak outlook. With resistance levels looming large and support thin on the ground, a slide towards the psychologically significant $2,000 mark cannot be ruled out. However, the resilient optimism amongst investors, evidenced by locked-in profits and rising NUPL, suggests a hidden strength that could fuel an unexpected comeback.\n\nFeatured image from Pixabay, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nThe SEC has delayed ETH ETF decision until May 23.\n\nETH\u2019s price has stabilized at $2,200, but another low looks likely.\n\nChart analysis points at a larger downtrend to $1,800.\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed its decision on BlackRock\u2019s application for a spot Ethereum ETF, extending the timeline for wider investor access to Ethereum. A similar delay occurred with Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum ETF, with a decision now expected in early March.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF Delays will continue to happen sporadically over the next few months. Next date that matters is May 23rd https://t.co/2zBBvHkrVk \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 24, 2024\n\nThis pattern mirrors delays with Bitcoin ETFs. Analysts anticipate sporadic postponements until late May, expecting a conclusive decision by May 23. The SEC\u2019s cautious stance on crypto is notable, but optimism about Ethereum\u2019s ETF approval remains.\n\nMeanwhile, the price of Ethereum has stabilized around $2,200 after its 20% downfall. It reverted to its previous low, which could indicate the start of a new downtrend. Can this stabilization lead to a recovery, or are we in for another low?\n\nETH Price Analysis\n\nOn January 12, ETH reached a high of $2,710. This continued the coin\u2019s uptrend from a low of $1,513 on October 19. This uptrend was the ending wave of a much larger uptrend that started in June 2022.\n\nEthereum formed a rising channel, with the price interacting with resistance with on a recent high. This interaction resulted in a hard rejection. Today, January 25, ETH is trading at $2,200, near the last low from which this recent high was made.\n\nIn this way, the price action hints at a potential reversal as it whips out the gain previously made, indicating that sellers are taking control. If we saw a leading uptrend in a new bull cycle for Ethereum, now we could see its first bull market correction.\n\nThe last downtrend doesn\u2019t have much more room to go, but another minor low of $2,100 in the coming days looks likely. After a minor correction to the upside that will establish the first lower high for wave B, another, more significant downturn should take place at wave C.\n\nProjecting with the Fibonacci retracement tool at the 0.618 level, we come up with a target of $1,840 to complete this correction. After this correction ends and we see the first macro higher low, another lasting uptrend would be expected, ultimately bringing Ethereum\u2019s price to a new all-time high.\n\nDisclaimers\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "content": "The cryptosphere is like an intricate chessboard; understanding the moves beneath the surface is key. Take the recent tumble of giants Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) \u2013 a cautionary tale for investors blinded by hype and not fundamentals. Beneath the fad, attention is turning to Kelexo (KLXO), a DeFi upstart that\u2019s got analysts buzzing about 50x to 100x returns in its ongoing presale.\n\nKelexo (KLXO) Transforms Peer-to-Peer Lending, ICO Sees Wave of Signups\n\nOne thing about crypto: The noises are fads, but the blue-chip gems are the low-cap and ICO coins. As Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) fall, Kelexo (KLXO) has taken the spotlight, getting all the recognition it deserves for its novel peer-to-peer lending and borrowing protocol.\n\nThe project\u2019s mission to help the unbanked, revolutionize the lending process and provide passive income makes it a much-needed innovation. At its core, Kelexo (KLXO) will provide an enabling platform that connects borrowers with intending lenders with no strings attached. In other words, there will be no KYC, credit checks, or overwhelming paperwork.\n\nAs a result, smart investors are already cutting their losses and have aped into Kelexo\u2019s (KLXO) newly launched presale. The presale has seen tremendous growth already, trading at $0.022 with over 2,500 signups within 48 hours.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Faces Significant Selling Pressure\n\nThe ETF hype was a fad, and Ethereum (ETH) is still reeling in the aftermath of this reality. Ethereum (ETH)\u2019s robust smart contract compatibility has been one of its strongest strengths. However, a lack of ecosystem development and growing baseless hype have severely affected Ethereum (ETH)\u2019s value.\n\nOver the last week, Ethereum (ETH) traders realized nearly $33M in losses, the worst since October 13, 2023. Ethereum (ETH) price has declined by 14%, dropping to a psychological support level of $2,235 today. Sentiment is worsening, and analysts are pessimistic about Ethereum (ETH)\u2019s performance in the coming months.\n\nIs Bitcoin (BTC) ETF Another Sell-The-News?\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has also followed Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) suit. Bitcoin (BTC)\u2019s decline surprised the general crypto market, especially with the positive outlook surrounding its spot ETF approval. Unfortunately, Bitcoin (BTC) has been in free fall, slumping under $39k and carving out all gains it accrued in the ETF, Ordinals, and pre-halving frenzy.\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\u2019s value continues to nosedive. It was last seen at $39,600, about 20% from $49,000 earlier this month. The ETF craze blinded many investors. However, the smart ones were quick to realize that the innovative feature that Kelexo (KLXO) aims to provide far supersedes Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC)\u2019s empty hype.\n\nConclusion\n\nNot all that glitters is gold! We\u2019ve seen that with Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC)\u2019s surprising drop despite their fleeting buzz. However, Kelexo (KLXO) is poised to make a big splash in DeFi this year. It is definitely an ICO token to watch out for as big cryptos see outflow.\n\nFind out more about the Kelexo (KLXO) presale by visiting the website here\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Even as developers are observing Dencun in trials, they have also begun evaluating and prioritizing Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) for Electra, the next upgrade on the consensus layer.\n\nEthereum developers deliberated Thursday about the next consensus layer upgrade after the 2024 Dencun network hard fork.\n\nEven as developers are observing Dencun on a testing network, they have also begun evaluating and prioritizing Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) for Electra, the following upgrade on the consensus layer.\n\nDuring a live-streamed meeting that takes place every two weeks, developers touched on a range of topics that included potentially increasing the maximum number of ETH a validator can stake, addressing censorship in Ethereum\u2019s block production and scaling up data availability.\n\nDebating EIPs\n\nCurrently, the staking balance of a single Ethereum validator is 32 ETH, but Mike Neuder, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, is trying to create a range that would raise the limit on validators. His EIP-7251 aims to increase a validator\u2019s maximum balance 64 times to 2,048 ETH from 32 ETH.\n\n\u201cThe high-level reason for doing this EIP is to allow some consolidation of the total number of validators we have,\u201d Neuder said in today\u2019s consensus layer meeting, \u201cWe\u2019re currently at around 900,000.\u201d\n\nEthereum developers also discussed EIP-7594. It concerns peer-data availability sampling, which is a method to progress from EIP-4844 levels of scale \u201cwhere everyone\u2019s downloading blobs\u201d of data, to a level beyond that: \u201cCall it full danksharding,\u201d said Ethereum Foundation researcher Danny Ryan, who chairs the biweekly consensus meetings. (EIP-4844 is nicknamed \u201cProto-Danksharding\u201d after its two main authors.)\n\nDevelopers have not decided whether to prioritize EIP-7251 and EIP-7594 in Electra.\n\nAnother proposal, EIP-7547, was removed from consideration in the Electra upgrade. EIP-7547 aims to make Ethereum more censorship-resistant. Neuder, one of its authors, highlighted an Ethereum dashboard that showed the censorship of different operators in the block production pipeline. According to community resource website censorship.pics, builders censored about 67% of data blocks by excluding transactions from sanctioned crypto addresses.\n\nEIP-7547 entails a forced transaction inclusion mechanism that specifies what transactions must be included in blocks to be considered valid. \u201cThis is a relatively newer EIP, but I think the ideas are very well established and important for one of the core properties on Ethereum, which is censorship resistance,\u201d noted Neuter.\n\nGajinder Singh, maintainer of Ethereum clients Lodestar and EthereumJS, replied, \u201cWe support the EIP, but we don\u2019t feel strongly about it, because we feel that not all options have been exhausted.\u201d Ryan didn\u2019t get any volunteers when he asked if anyone wanted to make the case for EIP-7547\u2019s prioritization in Electra.\n\nDevelopers did agree to prioritize EIP-7002, which allows validators to trigger exits through their execution layer withdrawal credentials, according to the EIP\u2019s resource page. Ryan noted that EIP-7002 \u201cis relatively straightforward\u201d on both the consensus layer and execution layer. \u201cIt is a new operation type, but [it] triggers very well-known exit code paths,\u201d which refer to the different ways a validator can exit from its role in securing the Ethereum network.\n\nWhen Ryan asked in Monday\u2019s meeting whether anyone was against the inclusion of EIP-7002 in Electra, no one objected to it."

Discover SCENE\n\nYou never know when a huge pile of meme coins can turn into serious cash. Early Dogecoin (DOGE) investors know this well, as do Solana developers who received an airdrop of BONK. And the latest beneficiary of a meme coin glow-up is\u2026 former U.S. president Donald Trump?\n\nAn Ethereum wallet that blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence previously tied to Trump, which holds a share of royalties from sales of the official Trump NFT collections, also holds over 579,000 MAGA (TRUMP) tokens. And a recent surge in price for the meme coins means that Trump\u2019s holdings are valued at about $1.1 million as of this writing, as first reported by CoinDesk.\n\nThe TRUMP token has jumped 222% this week alone, per data from CoinGecko, and 689% over the past 14 days. Meme coins are famously volatile and can be driven by social media sentiment and real-world events, and Trump has racked up a pair of 2024 presidential primary wins in recent days as he attempts to win a second term in office.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s wallet isn\u2019t associated with the creation of the TRUMP token, and in many cases, meme coins inspired by celebrities and public figures aren\u2019t created by the person in question. Instead, they\u2019re often created anonymously in an effort to ride the wave of hype and FOMO.\n\nIn this case, Trump\u2019s wallet was sent the sizable allotment of TRUMP tokens across multiple transactions in August and October 2023, per public blockchain data tracked by Etherscan. At the time of the largest transfer, on August 19, the 469,901 tokens received on that date were collectively worth approximately $5,670, per data from DexScreener.\n\nNow his stash of TRUMP tokens is valued at $1.1 million, making up the largest single holding in the Trump-affiliated wallet. Overall, it holds nearly $2.6 million worth of cryptocurrency as of this writing, including about $755,000 worth of Ethereum (ETH) and $731,000 worth of Wrapped Ethereum (WETH).\n\nIn December, the wallet dumped $2.4 million worth of ETH across a period of three weeks, following the launch of his third collection of NFTs minted on Ethereum scaling network Polygon. Only about half of the latest NFT collection has been minted so far, after the two previous collections both sold out.\n\nThe wallet was tied to Trump by Arkham last year following a financial disclosure notice from the former president, as the wallet receives royalties from the sale of his officially licensed NFTs.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

Beiko further adds that, assuming both of these go smoothly, Ethereum Dencun will be scheduled on the Ethereum mainnet next.\n\nMore testnet blobs on the way .oO\n\n\n\nDencun will activate on Sepolia Jan 30, and on Holesky Feb 7. If running a node on either network, now's the time to update it!\n\n\n\nAssuming both of these go smoothly, mainnet is next \u2705https://t.co/QbEUACix2S \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) January 25, 2024\n\nGoerli blobs were recently launched as Dencun went live on the Goerli testnet at 6:32 a.m. UTC on Jan. 17, 2024. The Sepolia and Holesky testnets will upgrade subsequently over the next two weeks. Dencun will activate on Sepolia at epoch 132608 on Jan. 30 at 10:51 p.m. UTC and on Holesky at epoch 29696 on Feb. 7 at 11:35 a.m. UTC.\n\nThe eagerly anticipated Dencun update follows last year's Shapella upgrade and includes changes to both Ethereum's consensus and execution layers.\n\nThe upgrade features several changes, the most notable of which is the implementation of ephemeral data blobs with EIP-4844, often known as \"protodanksharding,\" which will help cut L2 transaction fees.\n\nEthereum momentum to pick up in weeks\n\nMichael Van de Poppe, a crypto analyst, predicts that momentum for ETH might likely emerge in the coming weeks. He presents three arguments: Bitcoin's bottoming out could be a catalyst for altcoins to resume their upward trend. The second reason is the buzz around the Ethereum Spot ETF. Third, Ethereum plans to implement new upgrades that are anticipated to lower transaction fees by 90%.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, BTC perpetual swaps accounted for 55% of open interest in January 2022 and have subsequently increased to 66.2%. ETH's open interest dominance, however, fell from 45% to 33.8% between 2022 and 2024.\n\nBut following the ETF approval, ETH regained some market share, with its dominance increasing to more than 40% by this metric."

As previously mentioned, alongside our regularly scheduled news bits, I\u2019ll be adding some fresh recurring segments and features \u2014 so if you do (or don\u2019t) like what you see, let me know at jacquelyn@techcrunch.com.\n\nThankfully, the crypto world wasn\u2019t too chaotic this week \u2014 but let\u2019s get into the biggest headlines.\n\nThis week in web3\n\nCrunching numbers\n\nThis week the crypto market saw red as the two biggest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Bitcoin and Ether, dropped 7% and 13.5%, respectively, on the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. Even with that said, the global crypto market cap was relatively unchanged on the week around $1.55 trillion.\n\nIn the NFT world, sales volume declined 16.4% over a seven-day period to $248 million, but the number of buyers \u2014 and sellers \u2014 increased around 50%, according to CryptoSlam data. The top three collections by sales volume were CryptoPunks at $19.33 million, CryptoUndeads at $12.36 million and Ordinals at $8 million, during the same period.\n\nOur favorite \u2018Crypto Twitter\u2019 post\n\nBinance went to court on Monday to dismiss the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission June lawsuit against them \u2014 and the judge wasn\u2019t entertaining some of their arguments, as Fortune reporter Leo Schwartz, highlighted below.\n\nIn today\u2019s hearing for Binance\u2019s motion to dismiss the SEC\u2019s lawsuit, Binance\u2019s lawyers are echoing Coinbase from last week that Howey needs a contract. This time, the judge is pushing back. \u201cYou\u2019re being a little too cute,\u201d she says, arguing its language is broader. \u2014 Leo Schwartz (@leomschwartz) January 22, 2024\n\nThe latest pod\n\n\n\nFor this week\u2019s episode, I interviewed Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana Labs, the technology company that aims to help grow the ecosystem for the layer-1 blockchain Solana.\n\nThe conversation focused on Solana Mobile and its flagship web3 Android smartphone, Saga, which sold out in mid-December, as well as its new phone, Chapter 2 \u2014 which was announced last week.\n\nWithin its first 30 hours, Chapter 2 had over 30,000 preorders \u2014 signaling a lot of demand for the next-generation Android-based phone. At the time of recording, Anatoly shared there were over 40,000 preorders.\n\nAnatoly and Jacquelyn discussed the long road to selling out Saga, how important rewards and developers are and the nitty-gritty details for Chapter 2. They also dove into the company\u2019s strategy and long-term mission of going up against Google and Apple app stores and how long it may take for Solana Mobile to break even.\n\nIf you need a refresher on Solana Mobile\u2019s Saga phone, we\u2019ve got you covered:\n\nSubscribe to Chain Reaction on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or your favorite pod platform to keep up with the latest episodes, and please leave us a review if you like what you hear!\n\nFollow the money\n\nPolymer Labs raises $23M to build out the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s interoperability Avalanche-based Masa raised $5.4M to build a \u201cpersonal data network\u201d Scene Infrastructure Company raised $3M from a16z to expand FWB token\u2019s utility Web3 gaming startup Arcade2Earn raised $4.8M in private token round Ingonyama raised $21 million to improve zero-knowledge technology\n\nThis list was compiled with information from Messari as well as TechCrunch\u2019s own reporting.\n\nWhat else we\u2019re writing\n\nWant to branch out from the world of web3?

        "content": "Mustafa has been writing about Blockchain and crypto since many years. He has previous trading experience and has been working in the Fintech industry since 2017.\n\nStory Highlights The SEC is considering approving a spot Ethereum ETF, but there are some challenges.\n\nSome experts are optimistic about the approval, while others are more cautious.\n\nThe SEC is expected to make a decision in May, but it could take longer.\n\nIn the wake of the recent green signal for 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, all eyes are now on the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF. The burning question on everyone\u2019s minds is whether Ethereum will follow suit.\n\nThe journey towards approval, however, is riddled with challenges, primarily stemming from the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) unclear stance on how to classify Ethereum. The SEC is yet to make a definitive decision on whether Ethereum (ETH) falls within the purview of a security, creating a regulatory gray area that complicates the ETF approval process.\n\nStaying Optimistic Regardless\n\nDespite these regulatory hurdles, some optimists find solace in recent victories. Grayscale\u2019s Court of Appeals triumph and the green light for the Ethereum Futures ETF are seen as positive indicators. Optimists believe that an Ethereum ETF approval is imminent.\n\nIn the event of a potential SEC rejection in May, there is an anticipation of an appeal, with hopes that the SEC might reconsider to avoid complications.\n\nRead More: BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF: March 10th Deadline Could Be Make-or-Break!\n\nSo, What are the Odds of Approval?\n\nMarket experts offer varied perspectives on the likelihood of an Ethereum ETF approval. Brett Tejpaul, Coinbase Institutional\u2019s head, acknowledges growing interest but points out the SEC\u2019s reluctance to definitively label Ethereum as a security as a potential roadblock.\n\nEric Balchunas remains optimistic, assigning a 70% chance for approval, while James Seyffart adopts a more cautious estimate of 60-65%. Both experts weigh the positive and negative aspects, expressing relatively better odds for Ethereum compared to other cryptocurrencies.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said he expects a 70% chance of an Ethereum spot ETF being approved in May. The SEC needs to make approval decisions on multiple Ethereum spot ETF applications by the end of May, including VanEck, Ark 21Shares and Hashdex. Digital asset lawyer\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 11, 2024\n\nBitwise\u2019s Confidence\n\nBitwise, a company entrenched in Bitcoin ETFs, shares optimism about an Ethereum ETF. They highlight the necessary ingredients, including a robust market for Ethereum futures. However, the acknowledgment of Ethereum\u2019s complexity compared to Bitcoin introduces an element of uncertainty regarding the approval timeline.\n\nStaying Cautious is Key!\n\nSkeptics argue that the SEC\u2019s historical delays in approving cryptocurrency matters cast doubt on a swift approval for an Ethereum ETF. Given Ethereum\u2019s unique position, not fitting the traditional investment mold, gaining approval becomes a challenging feat.\n\nAlso Read: JP Morgan Says Spot Ethereum ETFs Approval Is Next \u2013 With 50% Chances\n\nJPMorgan analysts echo this skepticism, emphasizing the uncertainty surrounding the SEC\u2019s treatment of Ethereum as a regular commodity for the upcoming May approval. Adding a note of caution, investment bank TD Cowen suggests that the SEC might prefer observing the performance of Bitcoin ETFs before making decisions on other cryptocurrencies."

        "content": "Investors were initially curious about Spot Ethereum ETH/USD Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). However, after the approval of Bitcoin BTC/USD ETFs, these have now captured their full attention.\n\nBenzinga gathered exclusive commentary from several experts to gauge the prospects for a spot Ethereum ETF approval this summer.\n\nWhat Is The Current Status Of Spot Ethereum ETFs?\n\nTom Staudt, president and COO of ARK Invest, recently expressed confidence in the progression of Ethereum ETFs.\n\nHe cited the maturing dialogue with regulators and the sophistication of conversations surrounding the ETF, saying, \"This is not the same place where we were on the timeline with Bitcoin at this stage.\"\n\nStaudt notes that potential issuers now possess greater legal, operational, and philosophical expertise, partly due to the successful approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBut skeptics warn of regulatory roadblocks and lingering doubts about Ethereum's classification as a security. At the heart of the debate lies, once again, the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nWill The SEC Play Ball?\n\nAnndy Lian, an intergovernmental blockchain advisor, tells Benzinga that the SEC should act in the \"best interest of the public and the crypto industry\" by making a \"timely and positive decision\" on Spot ETH ETFs.\n\nHis comments highlight the widespread anticipation surrounding the potential ETF's arrival, with both retail investors and institutional giants eager to gain exposure to the world's second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nBut the SEC had to be \"dragged kicking and screaming\" to approve one spot cryptocurrency ETF, he adds, and there is no guarantee a second one would be any easier.\n\nRead Also: Russia, India Collaborate On Building Joint Digital Economy: BRICS Currency Soon?\n\nEthereum ETFs Could Spur \"Full-Scale, Global Adoption\"\n\nThe case for Ethereum is simple, according to Stijn Paumen, the founder of Helio.\n\nHe paints a vivid picture of a future transformed by Ethereum's mainstream adoption. The ETF approval would be a catalyst for \"full-scale, global adoption of cryptocurrency.\"\n\nEveryday purchases, from your morning coffee to online shopping sprees, could be made with a simple tap of your crypto wallet.\n\nHis infectious enthusiasm captures the transformative potential of blockchain technology and its ability to disrupt traditional financial systems.\n\nEven Bitcoiners Think It's Coming\n\nTerrence Yang, managing director at Swan Bitcoin, acknowledges the inevitability of an ETH ETF, albeit somewhat grudgingly.\n\nHe concedes that legal precedents and the SEC's recent Bitcoin approvals have tilted the scales in favor of Ethereum.\n\nIndeed, as Decrypt reported, analysts agree that Bitcoin's approval has set a precedent: Grayscale argued in court - and won - that the SEC could not approve a futures ETF and reject a spot ETF. Since futures Ethereum ETFs have already been approved, logic holds that a spot ETF would have to follow - as it did for Bitcoin.\n\nSo...When Ethereum ETF?\n\nChris Martin, head of research at Amberdata, a crypto data analytics firm, says an Ethereum ETF should come sooner rather than later.\n\nIssuers will face two major challenges at the SEC:\n\nThe SEC doesn't have the public pressure it did for the Bitcoin ETF which means, they can take their time and don't have to worry about passing all of the issuers at once The SEC is still pushing the security vs commodity stance without any clarity.\n\n\"Approving an Ethereum ETF may impact their current cases against Coinbase Inc COIN and Binance BNB/USD, and may push them closer to defining their stance on cryptocurrencies,\" he says.\n\nPrediction markets agree, with Polymarket rating the probability of an approval by May 31 only at 54%.\n\nShould the SEC grant its blessing, the implications for the financial landscape could be profound. Mass adoption may come a step closer after all.\n\nRead Next: Crypto Trader Loses $250,000 In January, Swears Off Leverage: I'm A 'Changed Man Now'\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock"

        "title": "Danksharding and proto-danksharding, explained - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Danksharding vs. proto-danksharding Danksharding and proto-danksharding are critical components in upgrading the Ethereum consensus layer. These technologies aim to enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability and efficiency, particularly in the context of layer-2 rollup solutions. Danksharding is a layer-2 scaling solution designed to empower the world\u2019s second most popular blockchain, Ethereum, to achieve its full potential. Proto-danksharding is an intermediate step in the danksharding roadmap. Proto-danksharding, approved as part of EIP-4844, has been officially incorporated into Ethereum improvement proposals within the Ethereum Cancun-Deneb upgrade. The upgrade was activated on the Goerli testnet on Jan. 17. As per Dencun\u2019s testing schedule, the next significant phase is scheduled for Jan. 30, with the implementation on the Sepolia testnet. The Holesky testnet is set to follow on Feb 7. However, the Ethereum development team has not yet disclosed the mainnet implementation date for the upgrade. Danksharding Ethereum aims to make Ethereum layer-2 solutions, particularly rollups, as cost-effective and as fast as possible as the blockchain becomes more congested with users. Danksharding and proto-danksharding are core to the future of Ethereum scaling. Danksharding is one of Danksharding is one of the final stages of various long-term Ethereum network upgrades to maximize the network\u2019s capacity. So far, core elements of this process have included major network shifts, including the staggered transition from proof-of-work consensus to proof-of-stake\n\nHow layer-2 solutions enhance blockchain efficiency and scalability Layer 2s boost and enhance the capabilities of base layer blockchains like Ethereum. For Ethereum, rollups have emerged as a viable and effective layer-2 solution. Layer-2 solutions refer to any secondary framework or protocol built on top of an existing blockchain that adds features that improve the scaling capabilities of the base chain. Layer 2 operates as separate off-chain networks from layer 1 base chains, where transactions are processed and then verified periodically on-chain. While base Ethereum can only process about 15 transactions per second, layer 2s can process thousands of transactions at low costs because of design choices within the periphery network that optimize the transaction processing capabilities of layer-2 solutions. Security and decentralization are still maintained because there is a process where the larger, decentralized base chain still validates transactions from the off-chain layer 2. Blockchain users can interact with a layer-2 front-end like Arbitrum, which processes transactions much more quickly and cheaply than Ethereum. Rollups are a form of layer-2 solution alongside channels, plasma, sidechains and validium. Rollup-based layer 2s like Arbitrum and Optimism dominate transactions among Ethereum layer 2s. Rollups execute transactions on a layer 2 before batching (rolling up) together the information they contain and sending this to the mainchain periodically for verification. This method enables the spread of fixed costs across multiple transactions, reducing costs arising from gas price volatility.\n\nEthereum scalability and the evolution of rollups In the pursuit of enhancing Ethereum\u2019s scalability, a primary solution has emerged: Rollups. Rollups powered with technology like danksharding represent a robust effort to enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability, reduce transaction costs and maintain the network\u2019s foundational principles of decentralization and security. Optimistic rollups and zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups) are the two primary forms of rollups available. Optimistic rollups are currently the most popular form of Ethereum scalability solutions. They operate alongside the Ethereum blockchain and are composable, which is a critical advantage. Optimistic rollups are called \u201coptimistic\u201d because they assume the transactions they shift off-chain are valid. There is no on-chain proof of validity, and the ability to challenge transactions is built into optimistic rollups to maintain security. The challenge period of an optimistic rollup is the window when users may dispute a transaction they view as invalid. Within the window, they can challenge the validity of a transaction by submitting a fraud proof, which is a mechanism for demonstrating the invalidity of a particular transaction or batch of transactions. Both the sequencer \u2014 similar to a validator in layer 1s, which submits and orders a block of translation \u2014 and the disputer are required to post a bond. If a transaction is found to be invalid, the sequencer\u2019s bond is slashed. If the fraud proof is found to be invalid and the transaction is valid, then the disputer\u2019s bond will be forfeited. The other primary form of rollup is the ZK-rollup. Zero-knowledge rollups publish cryptographic proofs-of-validity for off-chain transactions. Operators of ZK-rollup chains submit validity proofs to the main chain that demonstrate with cryptographic certainty that the proposed changes to Ethereum\u2019s state are due to a batch of valid transactions that were processed off-chain. Optimistic rollups are more popular than ZK-rollups because they can execute smart contracts. ZK-rollups, however, are mostly limited to simple transactions. Rollups execute transactions outside of Ethereum but, currently, inefficiently post transaction data to the mainnet as calldata. This process is set to be optimized by proto-danksharding and danksharding. Rollups execute transactions outside of Ethereum but, currently, inefficiently post transaction data to the mainnet as calldata. This process is set to be optimized by proto-danksharding and danksharding.\n\nDanksharding and proto-danksharding introduce data blobs to Ethereum The optimization of Ethereum\u2019s rollup solutions relies on specific components of danksharding and proto-danksharding, such as data blobs and the KZG polynomial commitment scheme. These technological elements serve as the foundation for enhancing Ethereum\u2019s rollup capabilities. Core to the layer-2 scaling danksharding implementation is the introduction of blobs. Blobs refer to large units of data that are designed to be part of Ethereum\u2019s transactional structure. Rollups currently use calldata to store transaction data. Calldata is imperfect for rollups because data stored in it needs to be processed by all Ethereum nodes, and it is left on the blockchain permanently. This permanence is not always necessary for rollups since they typically only require the data for a limited time to validate and execute transactions. Proto-danksharding will introduce data blobs that can be attached to transaction blocks and will automatically delete in one to three months. Blobs are transactions carrying a 125-kilobyte \u201cblob\u201d payload stored on the Ethereum consensus layer, not the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) like calldata. This method helps reduce the storage overhead and allows the data in rollup transactions to be sent more cheaply, enabling savings for end users (i.e., less gas fees). Proto-danksharding utilizes the KZG polynomial commitment scheme, which is named after the scheme\u2019s three original authors (Kate, Zaverucha and Goldberg). KZG compresses data blobs into small cryptographic commitments. KZG uses a cryptographic technique that allows data stored within blobs to be validated without needing to process the entire blob directly and without revealing the full contents of the blob. This is compatible with the zero-knowledge design used by some layer-2 protocols, which will be used across Ethereum scaling at some stage. That said, danksharding is the full realization of rollups. While proto-danksharding allows rollup transactions to attach one blob to a block, danksharding will expand this to 64 blobs. Danksharding is set to create a huge amount of space for optimistic rollups to dump their compressed transaction data. Danksharding hopes to support an expanding rollup ecosystem and allow thousands of transactions per second.\n\nDanksharding and proto-danksharding challenge the blockchain trilemma For a blockchain, achieving a balance between scalability, decentralization and security is almost impossible. Optimized layer 2s help overcome this trilemma. The blockchain trilemma concept posits that it is extremely challenging for a blockchain network to achieve scalability, decentralization and security simultaneously. The term was coined by Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, and in his view, blockchain platforms can only achieve two of these three goals effectively. Blockchains often need to find out-of-the-box ways to scale effectively and maintain blockchain transaction throughput without sacrificing security and decentralization. Unlike traditional financial networks, blockchains do not rely on third parties like banks to maintain a record and verify transaction ledgers. In a blockchain, this process is conducted by a decentralized network of independent computers called nodes. A more decentralized network with a larger group of nodes also contributes to security. The more nodes a blockchain has, the more theoretically secure it becomes. A potential attacker would need to invest more computational power to take over a larger network and conduct a 51% attack or network takeover. Security powered by higher decentralization directly affects the scalability of a network, as every transaction needs to be validated across a large number of nodes. This means that as the network becomes larger, more information needs to be processed by more participants. These issues have often emerged with larger blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, where transactions for end users become expensive and slow during periods of network congestion because blockchain security models mandate a process that cannot be overridden. Ethereum protocol development has prioritized scaling to address these issues, especially given the substantial growth of the network.\n\nOptimized layer-2 solutions empower blockchains against centralized payment giants While blockchain systems may inherently struggle to match the transaction processing efficiency of centralized giants like Visa, layer-2 solutions, such as rollups, optimized by technology like danksharding, level the playing field. Centralized payment systems like Visa can process transactions at scale much more quickly because these networks are closed and don\u2019t require shared consensus. Solutions like danksharding and proto-danksharding are designed to challenge the blockchain trilemma by sharding the blockchain. Layer-2-based off-chain transaction processing is built to enable an increase in Ethereum network capacity, and danksharding helps to optimize one of Ethereum\u2019s core layer-2 solutions: rollups. While both danksharding and proto-danksharding contain the word sharding, neither follows the traditional blockchain sharding technology model, which aims to split up a blockchain into multiple parts. Ethereum shard chains are no longer part of the blockchain\u2019s roadmap. Instead, danksharding uses distributed data sampling across blobs to scale Ethereum. This is much simpler to implement than the more advanced blockchain sharding techniques. This model has sometimes been referred to as \u201cdata-sharding.\u201d Instead, danksharding uses distributed data sampling across blobs to scale Ethereum.

        "title": "Ethereum Set For Further Decline As MVRV Signals Bearish Momentum! Here\u2019s The Expected ETH Price Dip - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nEthereum has seen a considerable decline in recent hours, following Bitcoin\u2019s struggle to keep its momentum within the $38K-$40K mark. This situation has plunged Ethereum\u2019s market dominance, as it finds difficulty in attracting buyers around its support levels. Currently, the market behavior hints at a further decline as a crucial on-chain metric shows selling opportunities. As a result, there\u2019s a bearish threat for ETH price as it could record another dip in the coming hours.\n\nProfitable Addresses Look For Selling Opportunities\n\nRecently, Ethereum (ETH) witnessed a notable price fall from its peak of $2,400, now targeting the $2,100 level. This shift resulted in a wave of long position closures. According to Coinglass, Ethereum faced total liquidations over $77 million, with bullish traders contributing to approximately $70 million in liquidations, contrasted with about $7 million from bearish traders. This trend has established a stronger resistance near the $2,400 level due to continuous bearish pressure.\n\nYet, the potential for an even greater decline in ETH\u2019s price looms, as a key on-chain metric suggests a correction. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, an important indicator, points to a significant sell-off opportunity for Ethereum, particularly with its recent drop toward $2,100.\n\nCurrently, the MVRV ratio is at 1.49, suggesting that Ethereum\u2019s market value significantly surpasses its realized value, or the value at the last transaction. This gap may lure traders to realize profits by selling their Ethereum holdings.\n\nAlso Read: Will Bitcoin Price Crash Again? Grayscale\u2019s $335M Coinbase Transfer Sparks Concern\n\nThe ETH price tends to stabilize around a MVRV of 1.1, which could indicate a potential further decrease in its value. Meanwhile, the long/short ratio is showing signs of activity, trading at 1.1993, with 54.5% of positions anticipating a price increase and 45.5% predicting a drop.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nEfforts by bulls to push Ethereum past the $2,400 resistance were met with resistance, evident from a significant decline in the price chart. This led to a sharp crash in Ethereum\u2019s price, falling below its moving averages and is now aiming to drop below $2,100. Currently, ETH is trading at $2,209, a 6.7% decrease from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price faces a significant test at $2,100 as it recently dropped below the ascending support line. However, buyers continue to defend the price and have quickly triggered a rebound above $2,200. Holding below this could strengthen bearish control, potentially bringing ETH down to the $2,000-$2,100 support area. However, a notable accumulation might be expected near that level.\n\nThe recent price behavior suggests ETH might fluctuate between $2,100 and $2,400 for quite some time. However, a break below $2,100 might send the price below the psychological level of $2K. On the other hand, a rebound and close above the EMA20 trend line might send the price toward $2,400 and then to $2,700."

        "content": "The SEC has delayed its decision timeline for BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF proposal.\n\nThe commission previously delayed Fidelity Investment\u2019s proposal.\n\nInvestor optimism is fueled by the growing support for Ethereum from industry giants.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has been abuzz with anticipation as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues its evaluation of over six Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) proposals. Issuers include investment management giants BlackRock, Ark Invest, Fidelity, and VanEck, hoping the commission will follow the precedent it set with Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nYet, the SEC appears to be proceeding cautiously, consistently extending its decision deadlines. Following its pushback on Fidelity\u2019s application just a week ago, the SEC has extended the same fate to the next hopeful contender.\n\nSEC Delays BlackRock Ethereum ETF\n\nOn Wednesday, January 24, SEC Assistant Secretary Sherry Haywood announced the commission\u2019s decision to postpone BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF application deadline.\n\nThe proposal, filed on November 21, 2023, requests approval to list and trade BlackRock\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust on the Nasdaq stock market.\n\nA 45-day timeframe has extended BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF deadline. The newly-scheduled date is March 10, 2024, by which the commission will either approve, reject, or institute additional proceedings to assess the proposal.\n\nCommenting on the delay, ETF Analyst James Seyffart asserted that the delays on ETF proposals will likely continue over the next months.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF Delays will continue to happen sporadically over the next few months. Next date that matters is May 23rd https://t.co/2zBBvHkrVk \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 24, 2024\n\nThe speculation hinges on May 23, 2024, as the plausible date for the commission to roll out its verdict. Despite the speculation, the SEC has until August 7, 2024, to reach a final verdict on BlackRock\u2019s application.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision to delay the approval process has increased the growing anticipation for the regulator\u2019s stance on spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nExperts Bet on Ethereum ETF\n\nDespite predictions that Ethereum ETF delays are expected to continue, the open support by investors has charted an optimistic course for the potential approval of the financial instrument.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink\u2019s bullish endorsement of Ethereum as a \u201cstore\u201d of value has significantly boosted investor confidence in the asset\u2019s potential. Fellow spot Bitcoin ETF provider Valkyrie Investments has expressed interest in the Ethereum ecosystem, further solidifying the asset\u2019s hype.\n\nThe Ethereum ETF anticipation is not fueled by market sentiment alone, however. In a recent interview, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce voiced optimism about a balanced decision-making process for all proposals, which will adopt an \u201cinvestor-liberty\u201d approach.\n\nOther industry predictions affirm that the SEC will likely grant simultaneous approvals in May, similar to its approach with Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nEthereum experienced a significant price boost upon the approval of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBefore approving Bitcoin ETFs, the SEC expressed concerns about potential market manipulation, which may influence its current evaluation of Ethereum ETFs.\n\nThe approval of Ethereum ETFs will signal improved regulatory standards within the United States.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe SEC clarified that approving Bitcoin ETFs is not the endorsement of crypto assets, and the commission\u2019s decision to extend the evaluation period of proposals reflects its commitment to thorough consideration. While the unpredictable nature of the SEC makes predicting a verdict challenging, the final decision on Ethereum ETFs could be influenced by its current regulatory stance.\n\n\u200bRead more on the impressive performance of Ethereum this year:\n\nStrong Ethereum Fundamentals Fuel 20%+ Surge Against Bitcoin\n\n\n\nAre insider hacks becoming a thing among investors?

        "content": "Ethereum price managed to hold the $2,200 support as the crypto market downturn intensified this week, on-chain signals highlight rising whale demand.\n\nOn Jan. 22, the crypto market suffered significant bearish headwinds as Bitcoin (BTC) prices wobbled below $40,000 for the first time in 50 days. At press time on Jan. 25, the global crypto market capitalization has shrunk 7%, with $108.5 billion in valuation wiped out within the weekly timeframe.\n\nEthereum (ETH) vs. Crypto Market Cap Performance | Source: TradingView\n\nLosing 5% in Ethereum (ETH) price has maintained a relatively more resilient performance than the industry average between Jan. 22 and Jan. 24.\n\nEthereum whale activity remains high despite downtrend\n\nEthereum price has managed to keep losses below the 5% threshold this week, while Bitcoin and the global crypto market cap shrunk by up to 7%, respectively, before making a mild rebound. On-chain data trends suggest that the rising level of whale trading activity recorded on the Ethereum network this week has been pivotal to ETH\u2019s resilient price performance.\n\nSantiment\u2019s Whale transaction count metric tracks the daily number of transactions involving a particular cryptocurrency that exceeds $100,000.\n\nOn Jan. 23, the Ethereum Whale Transaction Count surged above 1,190. A closer look at the chart below shows this was the highest recorded since the ETH price raced to a 20-month peak of $2,690 on Jan. 11.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price vs. Whale Transaction Count | Source: Santiment\n\nCorporate entities accumulate ETH at significantly high volumes despite the broader market retreat. This could be attributed to investors and fund sponsors looking to acquire Ethereum ahead of a looming ETH spot ETF verdict.\n\nDuring market downtrends, an increase in whale transactions impacts the price of a crypto asset positively in two major ways. Firstly, it provides market liquidity, enabling bearish panic sellers to execute their trades at favorable prices. It also reinforces confidence among small-scale retail traders.\n\nThese factors have played a vital role as ETH battles to hold above the $2,200 support level amid market-wide sell-offs this week.\n\nEthereum investors opt for long-term storage\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum has also recorded a steady decline in exchange reserves this week, which could be linked to the rise in whale activity.\n\nCorporate entities and whales are known to be value investors who tend to hold for longer periods. Unsurprisingly, the rising volumes of whale transactions on the Ethereum network in recent months have coincided with a rapid decline in supply deposited on exchanges.\n\nAt the start of the week on Jan. 22, Ethereum supply on exchanges stood at 10.5 million ETH. But interestingly, that figure has dropped sharply to 10.4 ETH by Jan. 25.\n\nEffectively, this means that investors have shifted 150,000 ETH worth approximately $330 million from exchanges and trading platforms into long-term storage or staking contracts.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Supply on Exchanges vs. Price | Source: Santiment\n\nDespite bearish headwinds, Ethereum Supply on Exchanges dropped by 150,000 ETH in the last four days, signaling a dominant preference for long-term holding and passive income staking among current holders.\n\nNotably, Ethereum exchange supply has been in a downtrend since the Proof of Stake (PoS) transition in May 2023, a move that has coincided with an extended period of price uptrend.\n\nETH price prediction: Can Ethereum Price Stay Above $2,000?\n\nAs the downward trend in exchange supply persists, fewer ETH coins are readily available to be traded in spot markets. This appears to have decelerated the selling pressure on Ethereum this week relative to the broader altcoins market. Combined with the steady rise in whale transactions, Ethereum price is in a prime position to defend the $2,000 territory.\n\nIntoTheBlock\u2019s in/out of the money around price data, which groups all existing ETH holders by their entry prices, also affirms this stance.\n\nIt shows that 8.3 million addresses, the largest cluster of ETH holders, had acquired 46.5 million ETH at the maximum price of $2,078. If Ethereum price slides toward $2,100, many of these holders could make frantic covering purchases to defend their positions to avoid slipping into net-loss positions. This could effectively trigger an instant Ethereum price rebound.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Forecast, Jan 2024 | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nOn the upside, Ethereum bulls could overturn the bearish pressure if it reclaims the $2,500 territory. But this looks unlikely within the current market dynamics. As seen above, a significant cluster of 3.7 million addresses had acquired 7.1 million ETH at an average price of $2,400.\n\nIf they engage in mild profit-taking as prices hit their break-even point, Ethereum could slide into another correction phase.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett reported a wide range of expectations regarding spot Ethereum ETF approvals on Jan. 23.\n\nNotably, Terrett suggested that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is opposed to approving a spot Ethereum ETF. She said:\n\n\u201cAnother source tells me the line at the SEC at this very moment is a \u2018hard no\u2019 and there\u2019s currently \u2018some internal resistance\u2019 to the idea.\u201d\n\nTerrett did not state whether that source is a member of the SEC itself or a member of an asset manager seeking approval from the SEC.\n\nTerrett also noted that SEC commissioner Hester Peirce, known for her pro-cryptocurrency stances, has advocated for a more straightforward decision process. The SEC in part approved spot Bitcoin ETFs because one applicant, Grayscale, obtained a legal victory, as SEC chair Gary Gensler explained in a statement. Peirce criticized that approach in an interview with crypto news platform Coinage today, as she said that ETF approvals should involve \u201cregular way consideration\u201d rather than court cases compelling action.\n\nTerrett concluded that further indications of the SEC\u2019s stance will emerge in the coming months as it becomes clear whether it engages with S-1 registration statements. The SEC typically posts notices of meetings with asset managers and exchanges on each ETF\u2019s page as they occur.\n\nAsset managers appear to be optimistic\n\nDespite resistance within the SEC, Terrett suggested that the asset managers responsible for issuing each fund are optimistic about approval.\n\nAccording to Terrett:\n\n\u201c[One] issuer with an ETH Spot ETF application says they\u2019re confident the approval and smooth launch of the Bitcoin spots will compel the [SEC] to approve ETH spot ETFs.\u201d\n\nAnother unnamed issuer said that they expect a spot Ethereum ETF to launch by the end of the summer because of the SEC\u2019s earlier approval of Ethereum futures ETFs, and because of BlackRock\u2019s strong ETF approval record.\n\nThat source also cited the CFTC comments suggesting Ethereum is a commodity, as well as Ripple\u2019s partial legal victory against the SEC, as factors that could more broadly prevent the SEC from labeling crypto assets as securities. However, it is not clear that those developments will directly impact spot Ethereum ETF approvals in the coming months.\n\nPublic expectations around approval vary. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas posits a 70% chance that an spot Ethereum ETF will be approved in May, while JP Morgan executive Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou has predicted a 50% chance of approval. Polymarket odds suggest a 53% chance of approval."

In the blockchain tech context, \"client diversity\" refers to the goal of having multiple software programs \u2013 known as \"clients\" \u2013 available for node operators and validators to access networks; as the thinking goes, if one of these clients goes down, due to a bug or some other mishap, there are plenty of other clients that would remain largely unaffected, preserving the blockchain's uptime. Ethereum's problem , based on a debate that erupted on the social-media platform X over the past few days, is that it's heavily reliant on the client software Geth, which powers around 85% of the blockchain's validators . As our Sam Kessler reported this week , a bug on the \"minority\" client software Nethermind, which powers around 8% of the validators that operate Ethereum, knocked out a chunk of those operators on Sunday. Since the share was relatively small, the blockchain kept running as designed. But some experts took the opportunity to point out how bad things could have gotten if Geth had gone out. Cygaar, a crypto educator, noted in an X post that \"Ethereum has terrible client diversity,\" adding that, \"A critical issue in Geth can lead to potentially millions of ETH being destroyed from validators running Geth.\" DCinvestor, a pseudonymous crypto investor with a large social media following, claimed in an X post that they were pulling their staked funds from Coinbase until the company switches its validator operations to a system that relies less on the Geth client: \"I can't ignore the risks.\" Per the website, ClientDiversity.org , which billboards the mantra, \"Diversify Now,\" the goal is for no individual client software to have more than a 33% market share."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Falls Another 4% But Bitcoin Minetrix ICO Nears $10 Million Milestone - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has seen another leg down over the past 24 hours, shedding 4% of its value as the bears maintain control of the market.\n\nETH now trades around $2,230 \u2013 17% below its local high of $2,710 set on January 12.\n\nHowever, while Ethereum struggles, the Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) presale continues gaining momentum and has now raised a staggering $9.1 million in funding.\n\nEthereum Extends Losses as Selling Pressure Mounts\n\nETH has closed in the red for four straight days, dropping below the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) in that time frame.\n\nThe token is now trading at the same level it was during the first week of January, right before its 25% surge.\n\nWhile ETH\u2019s price has been dropping, trading volumes have increased by 26%, hitting $16.6 million in the past day.\n\nThis suggests that crypto traders are actively selling ETH at current levels, prompting additional downside momentum.\n\nThe next potential support for ETH is located around $2,150, which held firm throughout most of December.\n\nHowever, if ETH were to break this level, it could result in a further 10% drop to the next support region at $1,900.\n\nWith the Crypto Fear & Greed Index dropping to a value of 48, there\u2019s a growing belief among traders that a decline like this could be on the cards \u2013 especially given the bearish pressure seen throughout the rest of the crypto market.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF Hopes Face Regulatory Resistance from the SEC\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s price woes have dampened sentiment recently, there is a potential catalyst on the horizon that could give ETH a significant boost.\n\nNumerous companies have filed applications with the SEC for a spot ETH ETF in the US, and approval would allow mainstream investors easy access to Ethereum exposure for the first time.\n\nHowever, the prospects of such an ETF being launched remain uncertain, with SEC Chair Gary Gensler remaining tight-lipped.\n\nMoreover, while spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved earlier this year, Gensler stated this does not indicate a willingness to green-light other crypto funds.\n\nThe first decision deadlines fall in May 2024, with additional rulings on other applications expected over the summer.\n\nIf a spot ETH ETF was approved, analysts predict it could have a massive impact on the token\u2019s value.\n\nNevertheless, with clarity on the matter still months away, Ethereum holders may have to brace for further downside in the interim.\n\nRevolutionary Bitcoin Minetrix Defies Bear Trend with Stake-to-Mine Innovation\n\nWhile the markets wait to see if Ethereum can bounce back or gain momentum from a potential ETF approval, some crypto projects are powering forward despite the bearish sentiment.\n\nOne example is Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), an innovative platform offering a \u201cStake-to-Mine\u201d mechanism for earning Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix allows users to stake its native token to earn mining credits.\n\nThese credits provide access to the project\u2019s cloud mining operation, enabling stakers to generate BTC payouts without purchasing or maintaining hardware.\n\nIn addition, BTCMTX offers staking rewards of 72% per year for simply holding the token.\n\nThis provides compounding passive income, allowing users to accumulate more BTCMTX to boost their mining earnings.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this dual-reward mechanism has driven significant interest in the ongoing BTCMTX presale event and helped the project\u2019s Twitter account reach 18,800 followers.\n\nBTCMTX has even been referenced by high-profile YouTubers like Austin Hilton, who endorsed the token to his 244,000 followers.\n\nWhile macro conditions weigh on major cryptos like Ethereum, Bitcoin Minetrix demonstrates projects with innovative use cases can still thrive.\n\nEarly investors can buy BTCMTX tokens through the presale for just $0.013 \u2013 although this price is only available for two more days before increasing.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a move that is sending shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community, Celsius Network, currently navigating through bankruptcy proceedings, has executed substantial Ethereum (ETH) transactions worth $40 million on Coinbase. This latest development comes as part of Celsius' ongoing efforts to meet its financial obligations and settle with creditors, even as it holds a considerable Ethereum reserve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a recent tweet from Lookonchain, a prominent blockchain analytics firm, the Celsius wallet deposited 18,000 ETH ($40 million) to Coinbase just 12 hours ago. This follows a pattern of consistent Ethereum deposits by Celsius, totaling a staggering $280,760 ETH ($621 million) to various platforms including Coinbase, FalconX and OKX since Nov. 13.\n\nThe accumulated Ethereum holding for Celsius currently stands at an impressive 540,029 ETH, equivalent to a valuation of around $1.2 billion. Arkham Intelligence, another blockchain analytics provider, revealed that Celsius engaged in Ethereum sales amounting to more than $125 million between Jan. 8 and Jan. 12. These sales are part of a strategic plan to satisfy outstanding debts and fulfill the requirements of the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nEthereum price movements\n\nThe current market price of Ethereum stands at $2,259, reflecting a 1.42% increase over the last 24 hours. However, the coin has experienced an 11.33% decrease in the past seven days. The trading volume for ETH is also down by 1.81% in the last 24 hours, with a total value of $14,257,423,116.\n\nMarket analysts and enthusiasts are closely monitoring how these substantial Ethereum transactions by Celsius will impact overall market sentiment. With the cryptocurrency community already grappling with volatility, this move by Celsius adds another layer of uncertainty."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH) faced a turbulent start to the week, witnessing a further 3% decline in its value by Monday noon.\n\nNotably, the second-largest cryptocurrency has been on a downward spiral since mid-January, closely tied to the lacklustre response to the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETF applications, which has also caused a significant dip in Bitcoin\u2019s value by over 10%. Even the optimism surrounding a potential spot Ethereum ETF approval has failed to reverse the trend, particularly in light of the US SEC\u2019s recent decision to delay its verdict on the Fidelity Spot Ethereum ETF application.\n\nAs the crypto market experiences these fluctuations, analysts are closely examining Ethereum\u2019s potential moves, with the current price hovering around crucial make-or-break levels.\n\nIn a Monday Tweet, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that Ethereum is currently situated in a key demand zone, spanning from $2,388 to $2,460, where approximately 1.02 million addresses previously purchased $4.82 million ETH ($11.6 Billion).\n\nHe further noted that the strength of this support zone could pave the way for minimal resistance, presenting a potential pathway for upward movement. However, the pundit warned of a potential pullback if Ethereum fails to sustain this level, suggesting the next significant support area lies around $2,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElsewhere, popular crypto analyst and YouTuber \u201cAlan\u201d also shared insights with his 54,000 followers on Ethereum\u2019s current state, pointing out that Ethereum has touched its old resistance, which could turn into support if the price holds. Richard outlined two scenarios: a bullish pullback towards $3,000 or a potential re-entry into a range with a downward trend, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, not all analysts share the same optimism. \u201cCrypto H\u201d expressed a more bearish outlook, indicating that Ether\u2019s fair value gap has been filled, and there is no compelling reason for the price to move higher. According to him, Ether\u2019s chart suggests a potential downside with targets below the $2,400 support level.\n\n\u201cI am way more confident with taking short positions on ETH as there is little to no barrier for price to move lower and eventually make new lows $1500 and $1000 are the next targets I will be looking for.\u201d Wrote the pundit.\n\nThat said, despite Ether\u2019s price woes, the imminent deadline for the Spot Ethereum ETF, just four months away, is seen by some as a potential game-changer for mainstream adoption and institutional investment in ETH. Expectations for a bullish trend in 2024 are high, especially after Ethereum\u2019s recent outperformance compared to Bitcoin. Notably, despite a 15% drop in Bitcoin following its spot ETF approval, the ETH/BTC pair surged by 26% and has been holding firm.\n\nETH was trading at $2,221 at press time after a 2.98% drop over the past 24 hours."

It is the first of several delays the SEC can exercise across a 240-day period. This first deadline comes nearly 45 days after Nasdaq filed for an iShares Ethereum Trust (on BlackRock\u2019s behalf) on Dec. 11.\n\nWhile the SEC must make a final decision on BlackRock\u2019s spot Ether ETF decision by Aug. 7, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has predicted a final decision will be made on all pending spot Ether ETFs in May \u2014 similar to the way the SEC decided on 10 pending spot Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 10.\n\nVanEck and Ark 21Shares\u2019 Ether ETF applications have a final decision deadline of May 23 and May 24, respectively, while the other three applicants \u2014 Grayscale Investments, Invesco Galaxy and Fidelity \u2014 Investments have final deadlines on June 18, July 5 and Aug. 3, respectively.\n\n\u201cNext date that matters is May 23rd,\u201d said fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart on Jan. 24, adding that he expects to see more spot Ether ETF delays \u201csporadically\u201d over the next few months.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF Delays will continue to happen sporadically over the next few months. Next date that matters is May 23rd https://t.co/2zBBvHkrVk \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 24, 2024\n\nEarlier this month, Balchunas pegged the chances of a spot Ether ETF approval at 70% by May.\n\nRelated: SEC solicits comments on Fidelity\u2019s spot Ether ETF application\n\nOne of the SEC\u2019s commissioners, Hester \u201cCrypto Mom\u201d Peirce, recently assured applicants that a court battle won\u2019t be necessary to convince the SEC to approve the spot Ether ETFs.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t need a court to tell us that our approach is \u2018arbitrary and capricious\u2019 in order for us to get it right.\u201d\n\nHowever, other industry pundits are less optimistic.\n\nMorgan Creek Capital CEO Mark Yusko predicts a less than 50% chance of an approved spot Ether ETF, making the case that the SEC remains hostile toward the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nMagazine: Magazine: How to protect your crypto in a volatile market \u2014 Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in"

Per the regulator, the proposed rule change which was published for comment in the Federal Register has received no feedback from the public to date.\n\nThe SEC noted that it needed additional time to deliberate on the application in order to make the right decision.\n\n\u201cThe Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,\u201d the SEC wrote in the filing adding that in pursuant to its extant statutes, it now \u201cdesignates March 10, 2024, as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change.\u201d\n\nThis delay to BlackRock\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF follows a related postponement of the application from rival Fidelity Investments.

The prominent institutions that spearheaded spot BTC ETFs are now leading the way for spot ETH ETFs, with one having received a recent response from the SEC.\n\nBlackrock\u2019s Ethereum spot ETF approval extended\n\nBlackRock was one of the major institutions that recently secured approval for its spot Bitcoin ETF. The company is actively pursuing approval for a spot Ethereum ETF, as evidenced by its submitted documentation to the SEC.\n\nSome weeks ago, the CEO of BlackRock spoke positively about the value of a spot ETH ETF in an interview.\n\nUnfortunately, the SEC has deferred the realization of a spot ETH ETF.\n\nA document released by the SEC on the 24th of January showed that the regulatory body has opted for a decision extension. According to the document, the decision was delayed by an additional 45 days.\n\nMajor Ethereum spot ETF decisions not to come till May\n\nThe SEC\u2019s extension of the decision for BlackRock\u2019s application is not an isolated case; Fidelity recently received a similar response.\n\nThe SEC, mirroring its action with BlackRock, has extended its decision on Fidelity\u2019s proposal for a spot Ethereum ETF. This trend suggests that other applications may encounter a similar response from the SEC.\n\nAccording to James Seyffart, an analyst at Bloomberg, the delays are expected to be \u201csporadic\u201d in the upcoming months.

It seems that the ETH price can correct an additional 10% to take support at $2,000.\n\nThe Spot Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nEleanor Terrett from Fox Business sheds light on the varied opinions and perspectives surrounding the potential approval timeline for an Ethereum ($ETH) Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). Discussions involve insights from ETF issuers, investment management firms, and sources close to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOne issuer of a Bitcoin ($BTC) Spot ETF, concurrently awaiting approval for an ETH Spot ETF, expresses confidence that the successful approval and seamless launch of Bitcoin spots may influence the SEC to greenlight ETH spot ETFs.\n\nConversely, another source presents a contrasting viewpoint, stating that the current sentiment at the SEC is a \u201chard no,\u201d with some internal resistance to the idea.\n\nAnother source believes that the approval path for ETH spot ETFs could be smoother, pointing to the listing of ETH futures ETFs and BlackRock\u2019s track record in obtaining ETF approvals. They anticipate a potential launch by the end of the summer. Addressing SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s ambiguous stance on Ethereum\u2019s status as a potential security, the source notes the CFTC\u2019s classification of ETH as a commodity and Ripple\u2019s partial victory with $XRP not being deemed a security during secondary market transactions. This leads them to believe Gensler may find it challenging to assert that most digital assets are securities.\n\nSEC Commissioner Hester Peirce emphasizes the need to avoid repeating past delays with ETH ETFs, emphasizing the importance of applying \u2018regular way\u2019 consideration to these products, similar to other comparable offerings.\n\nTerrett concludes that the SEC holds the key to the fate of Ethereum ETFs, with upcoming months expected to provide clues on the depth of SEC staff engagement with S-1 filings, akin to their scrutiny of Bitcoin spot ETFs.\n\nThe ETH Price Action\n\nEthereum experienced a significant decline in the recent trading session, particularly falling below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The analysis suggests that Ethereum might target the $2,100 level. A crucial factor to watch is whether the price breaks below $2,100 and then swiftly rebounds above it, potentially indicating a bullish move.\n\nThe 200-day EMA is positioned around the $1,950 level, and its upward trajectory aligns with this zone. The interaction between Ethereum\u2019s price and the rising 200-day EMA presents an intriguing scenario, warranting close observation to discern the potential market dynamics."

        "content": "While Bitcoin has struggled since the much-anticipated spot ETFs have gone live, Ethereum has emerged as a winner in the sector.\n\nEthereum Has Done Better Against Both Bitcoin And Altcoins Recently\n\nIn its latest weekly report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed how Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the altcoins have performed against each other recently.\n\nThe cryptocurrency sector as a whole has enjoyed a net rise since BlackRock first filed for its exchange-traded fund (ETF) last year.\n\nThe trend in the market caps of the three asset classes over the past few months | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 4, 2024\n\nThis period was filled with speculation about whether the various spot ETFs would go through. Still, starting mid-October, the assets rose as confidence that approval would be achieved went up.\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s market cap has increased by +68.8% since BlackRock first filed for their ETF, and the aggregate Altcoin Market Cap followed suit, rising by +68.9%,\u201d reads the report. \u201cHowever, Ethereum has seen more sluggish relative momentum, underperforming the wider altcoin space by -17%.\u201d\n\nNext, Glassnode has talked about the \u201cmarket cap dominance\u201d of these asset classes, which measures the percentage share they occupy in the total valuation of the cryptocurrency sector.\n\nThe trend in the market cap dominances of these assets over the last few years | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 4, 2024\n\nSince the FTX collapse in November 2022, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap dominance has notably risen. However, BTC hasn\u2019t taken a share of Ethereum as the second-largest coin\u2019s dominance has moved mostly sideways in this period. Instead, the altcoins and stablecoins are the ones who have lost dominance to Bitcoin.\n\nThe BTC spot ETFs finally gained approval earlier this month, but the event turned out to be a sell-the-news one for the asset. In this post-ETF era, though, a new narrative has appeared in the sector in the form of the ETH spot ETFs.\n\n\u201cShortly after the approval of the Bitcoin ETF, several issuers have filed or suggested a willingness to advocate for a spot ETF for Ethereum,\u201d notes Glassnode. \u201cAlthough obtaining approval for an ETH-based ETF might be more challenging due to the SEC possibly considering Ether as more of an investment contract, the markets appeared to express optimism.\u201d\n\nAs the chart below shows, Ethereum\u2019s dominance against Bitcoin has gone up.\n\nThe value of the metric seems to have gone up for ETH recently | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 4, 2024\n\nAs the graph shows, ETH\u2019s market cap dominance versus BTC has increased by about 2.9% since the latter\u2019s spot ETFs gained approval from the US SEC.\n\nThe altcoin side of the sector has seen a net rise in this period as well, but the alts haven\u2019t been able to keep up with ETH, as the latter has generally outperformed them.\n\nETH has gained market-share against the altcoins | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 4, 2024\n\nIn total, Ethereum has earned 4.2% in global dominance. \u201cThis makes ETH the biggest winner in the post-ETF approval market movements,\u201d explains the analytics firm.\n\nETH Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $2,230, up 1% in the last 24 hours.\n\nETH has plunged over the last couple of days | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Bastian Riccardi on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Glassnode.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Prediction as BTC Traders Target $30,000 Level and ETH Bounces From Support\n\nIn the ever-dynamic world of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) continue to navigate through turbulent waters. As of recent developments, Bitcoin, the pioneer and most valued cryptocurrency, experienced a significant downturn, breaching the $40,000 mark and stirring market uncertainty.\n\nThis decline in Bitcoin\u2019s value, partly attributed to the sales associated with the Grayscale GBTC Bitcoin ETF, has sparked concerns among traders about a possible further drop to the $38,000 level.\n\nConcurrently, the global crypto market cap witnessed a 2.32% fall within 24 hours, settling at $1.54 trillion, underscoring the broader impact of Bitcoin\u2019s fluctuation.\n\nBitcoin $BTC is back under $39K and now officially 20% off its recent high \ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/Aqtlj7QzbT \u2014 Evan (@StockMKTNewz) January 23, 2024\n\nIn a similar vein, Ethereum, renowned as the second-largest cryptocurrency, wasn\u2019t spared from the bearish trend. It saw a nearly 3% decline, dropping to $2,347, a movement seemingly influenced by Bitcoin\u2019s 20% fall following the launch of ETFs by major financial players like BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\nAmidst these market dynamics, Google Bard\u2019s AI projections suggest a potential further decrease in Bitcoin\u2019s value to $35,000, considering various economic factors such as inflation, interest rates, and regulatory changes.\n\nNavigating the Uncertainties: Key Factors Influencing Bitcoin and Ethereum in the Current Market Landscape\n\n\n\nThe current state of the cryptocurrency market, particularly concerning Bitcoin and Ethereum, is influenced by a complex web of factors, leading to considerable uncertainty. Analysts at QCP Capital have their eyes set on the potential for Ethereum to climb, especially with the prospects of spot ETF approvals.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding Ethereum ETF approvals in 2024 has become a focal point, with analysts speculating that patterns in SEC approval may provide valuable insights.\n\nWhen Will the SEC Approve Ethereum ETFs, What Are the Possible Dates? When Will the Expected Rise Start? QCP Capital Analysts Answered!https://t.co/dLYMppdZW5 \u2014 Bitcoin Sistemi EN (@btcsistemiEN) January 24, 2024\n\nThe recent dip in Bitcoin\u2019s value is attributed partly to outflows from Grayscale and the unfolding Mt. Gox news, which have sparked a flurry of questions in the market.\n\nWith Grayscale managing an impressive $21 billion in assets under management (AUM), its movements could significantly impact Bitcoin\u2019s supply dynamics.\n\nAnalysts are closely monitoring the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Quarterly Refunding Announcement (QRA).\n\nThey anticipate that a strategy leaning towards short-term debt issuance could lead to market rallies. However, an increase in long-term debt could result in higher bond yields and potentially trigger sell-offs in the stock market.\n\nUnder these circumstances, a scenario favoring short-term debt would be more conducive to gains in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn light of these developments, there remains a cloud of uncertainty over Ethereum (ETH), albeit with a silver lining that spot ETH approvals could have a positive impact.\n\nThe trajectory of ETH will likely hinge on a range of factors, including the outcome of ETF approvals, the influence of Grayscale\u2019s market maneuvers, and broader macroeconomic events. This complex interplay of variables contributes to a cautious sentiment prevailing in the market.\n\nArthur Hayes\u2019 Market Insights\n\n\n\nArthur Hayes, co-founder, and former CEO of BitMEX, recently shared thoughts on Bitcoin. He predicts a 30% drop from the recent high, expecting Bitcoin to go down to $30,000-$35,000. Hayes mentions buying \u201cPut Options\u201d at $35,000, expecting a 10-15% decline.\n\nBitMex Founder Arthur Hayes Predicts Bitcoin to Find Support Between $30,000 to $35,000 Before Hitting New All-Time High \u2014 Coinvestors \ud83c\udf10 (@CoinvestorsNews) January 24, 2024\n\nDespite challenges, he believes the Federal Reserve could provide relief, highlighting cryptocurrencies as important for inflation protection. He sold Solana (SOL) and BONK but trusts Dogwifhat (WIF) if Bitcoin goes below $35,000, sticking to his recovery outlook for the market.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction"

This is a necessary prerequisite for the launch of the EVM sidechain, and validators have currently cast 7 of the 28 votes required.\n\nRegarding the work done thus far, Peersyst stated that the sidechain is more advanced than ever before; after the audit with Bishop Fox, a second one has been carried out, whose details will be published soon.\n\nThe latest upgrades are being deployed, and the Cosmos SDK has gotten a blockchain update. Validators will soon be able to vote on the upgrade, which will incorporate Cosmos version 0.47 and Ethereum's EIP3855.\n\nIn addition, a new version of the bridge is on its way, allowing users to automatically and dynamically bridge any existing token on the EVM sidechain to the XRP Ledger. This would enable the EVM sidechain to serve as a gateway and connection to the rest of the EVMs, facilitating transactions and the use of all XRP Ledger Mainnet functionalities for all of these assets.\n\nA new UI has also been implemented to improve usability and allow for dynamic bridging between any sidechain, wallet and token. Meanwhile, a bridge SDK has been implemented to help developers create applications that leverage the bridge to access both networks.\n\nAlso, the latest version of the Blockscout Explorer is being developed. In addition to an improved UX/UI and other additional functions for verifying and executing smart contracts, the explorer would also provide a new dynamic display of dApps.\n\nEarlier in January, XRP Ledger developers announced the release of rippled 2.0, which includes two major feature enhancements: XLS-38 Cross-Chain Bridge and XLS-40 Decentralized Identity.\n\nThe Cross-Chain Bridge would allow XRP and fungible tokens issued on the XRPL to move seamlessly between the XRPL Mainnet and XRPL sidechains, as well as between the XRPL Mainnet and the upcoming EVM sidechain."

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nStory Highlights Only Bitcoin got ETF approval, dashing hopes for immediate Ethereum ETFs.\n\nSEC facing lawsuits from Binance, Coinbase, and Ripple while staying silent on the court cases.\n\nGarlinghouse criticizes the court-ordered path for Bitcoin ETFs, urging easier approval for future crypto ETFs.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair, gary gensler gary gensler chairman at US Securities and Exchange Commision Gary Gensler is an enthusiastic leader and the current chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He has the extreme experience that spans wall street, government regulation, and an angel teaching about cryptocurrencies and blockchain at MIT. He announced several initiatives to enhance investor protections in the $2 trillion cryptocurrency market. He previously led the Biden-Harris transition\u2019s federal reserve, Banking, and securities regulation agency review team. He was awarded Treasury's highest honor, the Alexander Hamilton Award, and also was a recipient of the 2014 Frankel Fiduciary Prize. He was born on October 18, 1957, into a Jewish family, in Baltimore, Maryland. Graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, earning a Master's degree in Business Administration. Additionally, he is also a professor at the MIT Sloan School of management. He has served in various governmental roles since the 1990s, such as the treasury department, Sarbanes-Oxley, CFTC, Swaps, Enforcement, Libor investigation, Maryland Financial Consumer Protection Commission, Securities, and Exchange Commission. Gary Gensler will probably keep on filling in as seat of the SEC until 2026, accepting his renunciation. He has expressed his desires to present crypto-related approach changes later on that include token commitments, decentralized finance, stablecoins, guardianship, exchange-traded resources, and advancing stages. A few officials as well as his kindred SEC magistrates have scrutinized Gensler for not giving adequate administrative direction on crypto, possibly prompting a standoff between Congress and the association. The SEC, CFTC, and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network handle advanced resource guidelines in the U.S., however, each with various jurisdictional cases, bringing about an interwoven methodology that crypto firms should explore to work legitimately. Whether 2022 will see a more clear way for organizations in the crypto space is questionable, yet the cosmetics of the SEC's initiative will fundamentally change following the takeoff of chief Elad Roisman in the first month of the year. Chief Allison Lee's term is likewise set to terminate in June 2022. Chairman , recently clarified that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs is limited to Bitcoin alone. Following the Bitcoin ETF approval, wild anticipations have arisen in hopes of spotting Ethereum ETFs. However, Gensler emphasized that the current focus is only on Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nNaturally, this has caused an uproar. Let\u2019s dive in.\n\nGensler\u2019s Highlights\n\nGary Gensler emphasized that the approval of Bitcoin ETFs doesn\u2019t extend to the approval of other cryptocurrency ETFs like Ethereum. He affirmed that the improved disclosure and competition in the Bitcoin ETF market had benefited investors with lower fees.\n\n\u201cAs I said two weeks ago, what we did about bitcoin exchange-traded products is cabined to this one commodity non-security and shouldn\u2019t be read to be anything other than that.\u201d \u2026 \u201cYou\u2019ve seen some competition in which investors benefited from lower fees.\u201d\n\nAmidst the celebrations, the SEC finds itself entangled in legal battles with major crypto players like Binance, Coinbase, and Ripple. Gensler, maintaining a strategic silence, refrains from commenting on the ongoing court hearings involving these industry giants.\n\nTimeline Extended\n\nFollowing the media disclosure of Gensler, a court filing from the SEC on Wednesday announced the delay of its decision timeline on BlackRock\u2019s proposal for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund to March.\n\nThe filing revealed that the Nasdaq Stock Market filed a proposed rule change to list and trade shares of the iShares Ethereum Trust. For such a proposed rule change, the SEC is authorized to take 45-90 days to announce its decision.\n\nHence, because of this need for sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and related issues, the SEC has decided to extend the decision deadline to March 10, 2024.\n\nRead More About This: BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF: March 10th Deadline Could Be Make-or-Break!\n\nRipple CEO Speaks Out\n\nQuoting Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, the approval of a Bitcoin ETF comes with a mix of emotions, driven by the SEC\u2019s need for a court intervention. Garlinghouse warns against a repetitive journey for every ETF, highlighting the potential challenges.\n\n\u201cThe sad part of that reality is we have a Bitcoin ETF only because a US court said to the SEC \u201cYou\u2019re being arbitrary and capricious in your apply of your application of the law\u201d\u2026 What would be sad is if every ETF had to go through that same journey.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock Decides to Stay Away from XRP ETFs; Here\u2019s Why"

        "title": "Ethereum 2.0 is Here: Bitcoin Minetrix and Chainlink are the Ethereum-Based Altcoins on Early Investors Watch List - TechCabal",
        "content": "Ethereum is now paving the way for sustainable altcoins after its recent upgrade. Ethereum\u2019s blockchain has proven to be one of the most reliable platforms for building decentralised applications and smart contracts. This reputation has prompted numerous developers to leverage the Ethereum platform, crafting their own distinctive cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\nIn Ethereum\u2019s thriving altcoin ecosystem, two projects stand out: Chainlink, with its decentralised oracle network and Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), with its novel mining protocol. Both leverage Ethereum\u2019s strengths, but which boasts stronger investor appeal for the future?\n\nEthereum Leading the Way for Environmentally Friendly Altcoins\n\nEthereum has become a go-to platform for various blockchain applications and smart contracts. Offering developers a robust toolkit, it serves as a versatile space for creating and launching diverse blockchain-based projects.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade to version 2.0 on March 12, 2023, was the next phase for Ethereum. This upgrade not only made the network eco-friendly but also set it apart from other widely used cryptocurrencies that consume substantial energy for mining.\n\nThe latest iteration, Ethereum 2.0, is geared towards making the platform even more scalable, faster and environmentally sustainable.\n\nChainlink: A New-and-Improved Ethereum Platform?\n\nChainlink functions as a decentralised oracle network embedded within the Ethereum blockchain. Its main purpose is to facilitate connections between smart contracts and real-world data, bridging the gap to external APIs.\n\nWith a market capitalisation surpassing $8 billion, Chainlink has gained recognition in the cryptocurrency community, currently holding the 12th position on CoinMarketCap.\n\nKnown for its technological advancements, Chainlink plays a crucial role in supporting decentralised finance (DeFi) applications. By providing secure and reliable data feeds, the platform empowers developers to create DeFi applications without constraints from on-chain data sources. Additionally, Chainlink boasts an active community of developers dedicated to ongoing improvements and innovations on the platform.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix: A Community-centric Crypto with the Technical Power of Ethereum?\n\nBitcoin Minetrix is quickly gaining attention for its innovative \u201cStake-to-Mine\u201d approach to Bitcoin (BTC) mining. Developed on the Ethereum blockchain, this project presents a user-friendly method for individuals to earn Bitcoin passively, eliminating the need for technical expertise.\n\nThe platform is tailored to make Bitcoin mining more accessible to a broader audience, removing the requirements for expensive hardware and specialised skills. By staking their BTCMTX tokens, users gain access to cloud computing resources, simplifying the entire mining process.\n\nThe project has built a solid reputation rooted in security and transparency. Through Ethereum-compatible wallets like MetaMask, users can easily acquire and stake BTCMTX tokens within the ecosystem.\n\nThe onboarding process involves buying tokens, opting for \u201cbuy-and-stake,\u201d and collecting rewards in Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s native token, $BTCMTX, is based on the ERC-20 standard, within the Ethereum blockchain. With a total supply limit of 4 billion tokens, the project demonstrates a thoughtful distribution strategy, allocating portions to the presale, marketing activities, staking and community-related projects.\n\nA major benefit of Bitcoin Minetrix is its ability to address typical challenges associated with Bitcoin mining, such as complexity and high entry costs. The token-based system offers a higher level of decentralisation and security compared to standard cloud mining services, reducing barriers for regular crypto enthusiasts.\n\nWhen users stake their tokens, they not only receive \u201cmining credits\u201d for cloud mining power but also enjoy two streams of income: potential staking rewards of up to 87% annually and a share of the mining profits. This dual-revenue model is a significant draw for those interested in both mining and staking in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nWhat Future Users of Web 3.0 Want for DeFi Currency\n\nAs the crypto market continues evolving, users seek sustainable and reliable DeFi currencies. Ethereum\u2019s blockchain platform has proven to be one of the most reliable and eco-friendly platforms for building decentralised applications and smart contracts. Chainlink and Bitcoin Minetrix are two cryptocurrencies that have used Ethereum\u2019s platform to create unique and reliable DeFi currencies.\n\nChainlink\u2019s decentralised oracle network has proven to be a valuable asset for the DeFi ecosystem. Its secure and reliable data feeds allow developers to create DeFi applications not limited by on-chain data sources. Bitcoin Minetrix, on the other hand, offers a unique community-led approach that has proven to be popular among users.\n\nIn conclusion, Chainlink and Bitcoin Minetrix are two of the most promising Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies currently on the market. While Chainlink has an advantage in its focus on decentralisation, Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s unique features, such as its stake-to-mine feature and strong community governance, make it an attractive investment opportunity for those looking for the next big project.\n\nFor investors seeking dramatic growth, turning attention to presale tokens like Bitcoin Minetrix is a strategic move. The $BTCMTX token holds the promise of potentially soaring 50x \u2013 100x, and with its final presale stage underway, early investors have a prime opportunity to get involved and potentially see significant profits in the coming weeks.\n\nShare this article"

        "content": "Axiom, an emerging Ethereum data protocol, has secured $20 million in Series A funding for zero-knowledge proofs.\n\nA key technological underpinning of Axiom is its utilization of zero-knowledge proofs (ZK proofs). These cryptographic tools verify transactions without disclosing their specific details. They are instrumental in enabling Axiom\u2019s method of accessing and processing Ethereum\u2019s historical data.\n\nAt the core of Axiom\u2019s innovation is its ability to grant smart contract developers the capacity to retrieve historical Ethereum data. The data is then processed externally, off the main blockchain network. This approach enhances efficiency and addresses some of the inherent limitations of Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts, specifically their inability to access older blockchain data directly.\n\nWe're excited to announce we've raised $20 million led by @paradigm and @standardcrypto, with participation from @robotventures and @etherealvc\n\n\n\nWe are building infrastructure to give smart contract developers access to more data on-chain. pic.twitter.com/M8q61KMid3 \u2014 Axiom (@axiom_xyz) January 25, 2024\n\nYou might also like: Trezor comments on phishing emails sent to community\n\nEthereum\u2019s smart contracts have historically faced challenges in accessing old data, with solutions like oracles emerging to bridge this gap. However, these oracles have drawbacks, including high costs and computational constraints.\n\nAxiom\u2019s approach, which involves running an off-chain coprocessor that processes data and then syncs it back to the Ethereum blockchain with the validation of ZK proofs, presents a novel solution to these challenges \u2014 positioning Axiom as a pivotal player in the evolving landscape of blockchain data processing and access.\n\nThe funding round was primarily led by Paradigm and Standard Crypto, two notable entities in the crypto-investment space.

        "content": "For Ethereum ETFs, SEC commissioner Hester Peirce strongly believes that the securities regulator would not repeat the same mistakes it made in the run-up to spot Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nEthereum ETF Approval Might Come Without Hassle\n\nAward-winning Web3.0 host Zac Guzm\u00e1n interviewed Peirce to discuss the regulation of cryptocurrency. During their discussion, he asked the commissioner if Ethereum ETF filers would need to go to court before receiving approval from the SEC just as Grayscale had done. Peirce responded that the SEC would not need to \u201crepeat same mistake\u201d as it did before.\n\nadvertisement\n\nPopularly known as the \u2018Crypto mom\u2019, the commissioner went on to state that the agency would not need a court to explain that its approach is arbitrary and capricious before it gets things right this time around. In her opinion, the SEC has learned its lessons and they will stick to it as applications for Ethereum ETF kept coming in.\n\nBefore approving spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this month, the SEC had constantly rejected applications from several interested parties including Grayscale. Notably, Grayscale took the rejection of its GBTC conversion application a step further by going to court. After several months of legal tussle, a US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit handed Grayscale a win against the SEC.\n\nThis was pivotal for the crypto industry, especially as the court further mandated the regulator to reconsider its decision over Grayscale\u2019s application. There had been several postponement of a spot Bitcoin ETF decision from the United States SEC but in less than six months of receiving this mandate from the court, the SEC greenlighted eleven spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nEthereum Spot ETF Impact\n\nNow the race is for Ethereum ETFs and the SEC seems to be taking its time to reach a decision. Based on a 45-day extension granted earlier, the regulator\u2019s decision on Grayscale Ethereum Trust\u2019s ETF is expected within the next two days. Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF, which aims to incorporate spot Ethereum and futures contracts into its portfolio has had its decision postponed earlier.\n\nSimilarly, the SEC has announced a 45-day extension for Fidelity Spot Ethereum ETF, pushing the decision on the product to March 5, 2024. As the broad market awaits the decision of the regulator, there are certain forecasts that ETH will reach as high as $4,800 when an approval is eventually given.\n\nConsidering how Bitcoin has reacted to the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, there is no guarantee that it would be any different for Ethereum but the prospects remains high for approval for now."

        "content": "A recent announcement from Ethereum core developers suggests that the Dencun upgrade is still on schedule.\n\nThe stance comes despite challenges experienced in the network\u2019s first outing on Goerli.\n\nThe disclosure strengthens expectations of a Q1 2024 Dencun mainnet release.\n\nFor members of the Ethereum community, 2024 promises to be an exciting year. One of the reasons for this excitement is the expected rollout of the long-anticipated Dencun upgrade, which would introduce proto-danksharding, also known as EIP-4844, marking the first step in a multi-year vision to address Ethereum\u2019s scaling challenges.\n\nOn January 17, the Dencun upgrade finally made it to an Ethereum testnet after nearly a year of anticipation, with developers and enthusiasts hoping for a Q1 2024 mainnet release. However, bugs and challenges experienced during this testnet release had sparked concerns of further delays. These concerns have now been put to rest by a recent Ethereum Protocol Support team announcement.\n\nEthereum Dencun Still on Track\n\nIn December 2023, Ethereum core developers rolled out tentative dates for the Dencun upgrade to launch on Ethereum\u2019s testnets. In line with this schedule, developers rolled out the Dencun upgrade on Goerli, Ethereum\u2019s soon-to-be deprecated testnet for staking infrastructure and protocol level changes, on January 17. But amid a launch marred by bugs and challenges, there had been questions about how the schedule could be impacted.\n\nIn a Wednesday, January 24 announcement, however, developers have suggested that there would be no change to the Dencun upgrade schedule. The announcement confirmed that upgrades on Sepolia, Ethereum\u2019s sandbox for testing DApps, smart contract, and EVM functionality, and Holesky, Goerli\u2019s planned replacement, would occur as scheduled on January 30 and February 7, respectively.\n\nMore testnet blobs on the way .oO\n\n\n\nDencun will activate on Sepolia Jan 30, and on Holesky Feb 7. If running a node on either network, now's the time to update it!\n\n\n\nAssuming both of these go smoothly, mainnet is next \u2705https://t.co/QbEUACix2S \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) January 25, 2024\n\nTo this end, developers have urged validators to upgrade to Dencun-supported clients on Sepolia and Holesky to ensure a smooth upgrade experience. Developers also highlighted the risks of choosing majority clients amid recent client centralization debates within the Ethereum community. The discussion has sparked fear of a single bug, causing users to lose their stake through a chain split.\n\nDencun\u2019s Rocky Start on Goerli\n\nMultiple issues plagued Dencun\u2019s first testnet outing, including a failure to achieve finality and a chain split. Developers attributed the former to low network participation from validators, while the latter was attributed to a bug in Prysm nodes. These issues were, however, resolved in a few hours as developers confirmed that the network was finalizing again.\n\nFinality is the guarantee that crypto transactions cannot be reversed once they are executed.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nUnforeseen challenges on Sepolia and Holesky could still impact the Dencun launch timeline.\n\nEthereum Layer 2 chains will benefit the most from proto-danksharding, which promises to cut fees for end users by shaving the cost of data storage on the mainnet.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is a long-anticipated upgrade that promises to bring Ethereum one step closer to solving scaling concerns. The recent announcement from developers suggests that the upgrade is still on track to launch in Q1 2024.\n\nRead this for more on Dencun\u2019s first outing woes:\n\nEthereum Dencun Upgrade Hits Snags in First Testnet Outing\n\n\n\nPolygon\u2019s interoperability layer is coming.

        "content": "The SEC chair said that the Bitcoin ETF approval stays limited to one commodity, hinting that the agency isn\u2019t thinking of approving an Ethereum ETF. Also, the agency delayed its decision on BlackRock\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nDuring a media briefing on Wednesday, January 24, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this month remains limited to this single cryptocurrency and one shouldn\u2019t interpret it to have any broader implications beyond it. Gensler\u2019s comments come at a time when top financial players including BlackRock and Fidelity have been pushing for a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nIn his briefing yesterday, the SEC chair said:\n\n\u201cAs I said two weeks ago, that which we did with regard to bitcoin exchange traded products is cabined to this one commodity non-security and shouldn\u2019t be read to be anything other than that.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, crypto experts remain confident that a spot Ethereum ETF could be coming this year. Previously, some analysts have stated that the approval could come by May 2024.\n\nAdditionally, on Wednesday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission delayed the decision for BlackRock\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF proposal, pushing the deadline to March 10. Until then, the regulatory body has time to make a decision. The SEC can either approve, disapprove, or initiate further proceedings on the proposed fund. The filing from the SEC reads:\n\n\u201cThe Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.\u201d\n\nBlackRock submitted the proposal for its spot Ethereum ETF last year in November 2023. Additionally, Fidelity\u2019s application for the spot Ethereum ETF is also facing delays, as filed by the SEC last week.\n\nSEC\u2019s Legal Battles\n\nThe US SEC remains embroiled in legal battles with multiple crypto firms including top names like Binance, Coinbase, and Ripple.\n\nIn June, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Binance Holdings and its former CEO Changpeng Zhao, alleging deceptive practices towards customers, failure to restrict US investors, channeling funds to investment funds owned by Zhao, and unregistered exchange operations. The SEC also identified 12 tokens, including BNB and BUSD, as securities.\n\nSimilarly, Coinbase faced an SEC lawsuit in June, accused of operating as an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency. When questioned about recent court hearings, SEC Chair Gensler deferred to the agency\u2019s enforcement staff and litigators for specific details.\n\n\u201cBut stepping back from any one case, I just think that the investing public, if they\u2019re interested in investing in crypto securities, they should be aware and careful that these crypto security tokens are not necessarily giving them the appropriate disclosures and they\u2019re not getting those disclosures from these non-compliant token operators,\u201d said Gensler."

        "content": "SEC Chair Gensler Tempers Enthusiasm Over Ethereum ETF Applications\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler has downplayed the possibility of Ethereum ETF applications being approved in the near future.\n\nIn a media briefing on January 24th, Gensler clarified that the recent approval Bitcoin ETFs by the agency was exclusive to Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nThis clarification comes amid expectations from some quarters that spot Ethereum ETFs might be the next in line for approval.\n\n\u201cAs I said two weeks ago, that which we did with regard to bitcoin exchange traded products is cabined to this one commodity non-security and shouldn\u2019t be read to be anything other than that,\u201d Gensler said during the briefing when asked about ether ETFs.\n\nGensler noted that there is now \u201cbetter disclosure\u201d for investors who plan to buy Bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn that light, there\u2019s also better disclosure,\u201d Gensler said. \u201cThey\u2019re listed on stock exchanges now rather than trading in over the counter markets. There were 10 or 11 that went live at the same time that brought a certain amount of competition. You\u2019ve seen some competition that investors benefited from lower fees.\u201d\n\nThere are varying levels of confidence among crypto experts regarding the approval of spot ether ETFs, with some speculating that an approval could come sometime in May. Shortly after Gensler\u2019s comments, the SEC revealed that it had delayed its decision on BlackRock\u2019s spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) application to March.\n\nSeveral prominent firms, including Fidelity and BlackRock, have already submitted applications for a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\n\n\nOn January 10, the agency greenlit the approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, a move that followed a D.C. court\u2019s decision by three judges. However, the court ruled that the SEC needed to re-examine a bid related to Grayscale\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s Legal Disputes\n\n\n\nThe SEC is currently entangled in legal battles with crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase.\n\n\n\nGensler, when asked about his thoughts on the current cases, reiterated that noncompliant crypto companies were not \u201cnecessarily\u201d providing appropriate disclosures.\n\n\u201cBut stepping back from any one case, I just think that the investing public, if they\u2019re interested in investing in crypto securities, they should be aware and careful that these crypto security tokens are not necessarily giving them the appropriate disclosures and they\u2019re not getting those disclosures from these non compliant token operators,\u201d Gensler said."

        "content": "Fox News reporter Eleanor Terrett has revealed differing opinions among stakeholders regarding the potential approval of a spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).\n\nWhile certain issuers are optimistic, suggesting that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs might compel the SEC to greenlight Ethereum-based products, possibly in the late summer, others argue that the agency\u2019s stance on ETH is leaning towards rejection due to substantial internal resistance within the SEC.\n\nConflicting Views on SEC\u2019s Approval\n\nAccording to Terrett, one issuer who has already obtained approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF expresses confidence that the successful launch will influence the SEC to greenlight Ethereum ETFs.\n\nHowever, another source paints a more pessimistic picture, stating that there is a \u201chard no\u201d at the SEC, with internal resistance to the idea.\n\nReporting on the timeline for a potential $ETH ETF approval has turned up a plethora of different takes from ETF issuers, investment management firms and sources close to the @SECGov. \u2728One $BTC Spot ETF issuer with an ETH Spot ETF application says they\u2019re confident the\u2026 \u2014 Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 23, 2024\n\nA third source speculates that the approval of Ethereum futures ETFs and BlackRock\u2019s track record in getting ETFs approved could pave the way for spot ETH ETFs to launch by the end of the summer.\n\nWhen questioned about SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s stance on Ethereum as a potential security, the source suggests that given the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s (CFTC) classification of Ethereum as a commodity and recent legal developments with Ripple\u2019s XRP, it may be challenging for Gensler to assert that most digital assets are securities.\n\nSEC Commissioner Hester Peirce emphasized the importance of avoiding delays in the approval process for spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nShe stated, \u201cWe need to be applying \u2018regular way\u2019 consideration to these products, the same kind of consideration we apply to similar products.\u201d\n\nJP Morgan Analysts Skeptical\n\nMeanwhile, JP Morgan analysts led by Managing Director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou expressed reservations through a note to clients sent on Jan.18 about the likelihood of SEC approval for spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nCiting regulatory and judicial concerns, the analysts predicted a less than 50% chance of approval. They also noted skepticism about the SEC classifying Ethereum as a commodity as early as May.\n\nAs the SEC continues to deliberate on spot Ethereum ETFs, market participants eagerly await clues from the regulatory body in the coming months.\n\nAccording to Terrett, the SEC\u2019s handling of S-1 filings will likely provide insights into the agency\u2019s stance. The ball remains firmly in the SEC\u2019s court, and the crypto community keenly watches how things unfold."

The Dencun upgrade, named after Deneb, a star in the Cygnus constellation, and Cancun, the city location for Devcon 3, is expected to scale the Ethereum blockchain by implementing EIP-4844, also known as \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d which introduces a new transaction type called a blob-carrying transaction.\n\n\u201cA blob-carrying transaction is like a regular transaction, except it also carries an extra piece of data called a blob,\u201d wrote Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin on the community resource website eip4844.com. \u201cBlobs are extremely large (~125 kB), and can be much cheaper than similar amounts of calldata.\u201d Ethereum developers expect the data space in these blobs to be used by rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism, which facilitate high-throughput transactions.\n\nAs a result, Dencun is expected to lower the cost of transacting on Ethereum by allowing rollups, blockchain networks built atop Ethereum\u2019s base layer, to add cheaper data to blocks.\n\n\u201cAssuming the Sepolia and Holesky upgrades go well, Dencun will be scheduled on the Ethereum mainnet next,\u201d the Ethereum Foundation said in its announcement."

Just days ago, the commission delayed Fidelity\u2019s Spot Ethereum ETF application.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the SEC is not a fan of cryptocurrency. In fact, chair Gary Gensler implied shortly after approval that it was seemingly pushed to approve the Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Immediately, cryptocurrency enthusiasts went to social media to blast the commission, signaling a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Following the initial filing, the SEC had 45 days to decide on the ETFs or delay it, and the commission\u2019s deadline was Jan 25, a day after the decision to delay.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin: Cramer\u2019s Doubts vs. Hayes\u2019 Bottom Fishing \u2013 What Lies Ahead?\n\nHence, it is likely that the SEC is looking to prolong the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs, including BlackRock\u2019s.

        "content": "Strike founder Jack Mallers recently expressed his firm belief in Bitcoin\u2019s potential to solve what he describes as \u201cthe biggest financial problem ever\u201d \u2014 central banking and the global debt crisis.\n\nMallers made the statement during an interview with Yahoo Finance on Jan. 24, where he highlighted Bitcoin in relation to government debt by focusing on the significant issue of global financial instability, primarily driven by excessive government debt.\n\nBitcoin is a hedge.\n\nMallers said that the staggering global debt-to-GDP ratio, which currently stands at an alarming 360%, represents a critical problem where governments have accumulated debt to such an extent that there seems to be no feasible way to pay it back. He added:\n\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s run up a $37 trillion bill at the bar, so who\u2019s paying for that?\u201d\n\nMallers argued that the holders of government-issued currencies will ultimately bear this massive debt burden. He reasoned that governments might address their debt by debasing their currencies by printing more money. This currency debasement process erodes the currency\u2019s value, leading to potential inflation and financial instability for those holding these currencies.\n\nAdditionally, Mallers pointed out the current state of the traditional financial markets, particularly the bond market, which he notes as being in its worst condition ever. Combined with the underperformance of conventional investment strategies like the 60/40 portfolio, this paints a bleak picture of the financial landscape, further underscoring Bitcoin\u2019s relevance as an alternative investment.\n\nAccording to Mallers, Bitcoin is \u201cthe only innovation\u201d to solve the \u201ccentral banking problem\u201d and serve as a global reserve currency.\n\nEthereum is a \u201ctech-play\u201d\n\nMallers further stated that other cryptocurrencies like \u201cEthereum, Solana, and Dogecoin\u201d should not be grouped together because they do not address the fundamental financial issues that Bitcoin can solve.\n\nHe referred to Ethereum as a \u201ctech play,\u201d suggesting that its value and utility are more aligned with technological innovation and adoption rather than serving as a stable financial instrument. He said Ethereum is more akin to a speculative investment, dependent on its technological success and acceptance in broader applications, such as finance and tech industries.\n\nMallers likened Ethereum to equities, comparing investing in it to investing in stocks like Tesla. He suggested that people might invest in Ethereum, hoping it will soar in value like high-performing stocks, based on technological advancements and leadership rather than its potential as a stable currency or store of value.\n\nHe also implied that Ethereum\u2019s success and adoption depend on the acceptance and use of major financial players, like banks and institutional investors. This dependence on external factors contrasts sharply with his view of Bitcoin, which he sees as more autonomous and independent of mainstream financial systems.\n\nHis skepticism towards Ethereum stems from its history. He recalled a significant hack and instances where the Ethereum Foundation intervened in transaction processes.\n\nIn his view, these events cast doubt on Ethereum\u2019s reliability and integrity as a financial instrument. He criticized the Ethereum Foundation for cherry-picking transactions in response to issues, which, according to Maller, undermines the predictability and trustworthiness essential in a financial system."

In a highly ambitious case, XRP could extend the gains to the $0.5784 level. Beyond this, the next logical target for the XRP price could be the $0.6000 psychological level, standing around 16% above current levels.\n\n\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flip side, if the XRP price extends the fall below the midline of the FVG at $0.5029, the load-shedding exercise could extend with Ripple price likely to revisit the $0.4746 support, around 8% below current levels.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price could gain nearly 12% as on-chain metrics signal recovery"

Between hopes and uncertainties, the crypto world is holding its breath.\n\nA Spot Ethereum ETF in March, really?\n\nFollowing the dance of Bitcoin Spot ETFs, BlackRock now wants to take Ethereum spot trading for a spin. Larry Fink, the maestro at BlackRock, firmly believes in his ETH Spot ETF, already approved on January 10 alongside a myriad of other products. A vivid wish that, according to him, will rocket ETH into the stars of institutional finance.\n\nBut the SEC is not ready to be easily swept away by these ETH Spot ETFs.\n\nThe U.S. SEC has pushed back the timetable for a decision on BlackRock\u2019s proposed spot Ethereum ETF until March.

The next important date to watch is May 23,\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 25, 2024\n\n\u201cThe US SEC has postponed the timeline for the decision on BlackRock\u2019s proposed Spot Ethereum ETF to March. The SEC now has until March 10 to approve, reject, or initiate further proceedings against the proposed fund. The next important date to watch is May 23, according to James Seyffart, an analyst at Bloomberg.\u201c\n\nAccording to The Block, the SEC has announced that it will not make any decisions on these spot Ethereum ETFs before March. March 10th could be the day when the SEC, with its regulatory broom, will sweep through the approval requests from BlackRock, ARK 21 Shares, VanEck, and Fidelity.\n\nAs usual, Bloomberg\u2019s keen financial analyst, James Seyffart, has looked into his crystal ball regarding the Ethereum ETFs. Predicting their validation in May, he left this gem on his account X:\n\n\u201cThe delays of the Spot Ethereum ETFs will continue to occur sporadically over the coming months. The next date that counts is May 23\u201c\n\nGary Gensler, the SEC\u2019s dance master, has his say!\n\nSpot Ethereum ETFs are stirring up passions among analysts: between those who already see the SEC saying \u201cyes\u201d to an ETH waltz and the skeptics who rather hear a resounding \u201cno.\u201d\n\nGary Gensler, the current conductor of the SEC, has already suggested that for spot trackers linked to assets other than Bitcoin, the music might not play in their favor.\n\n\u201cAs I mentioned two weeks ago, our playbook for exchange-traded products linked to Bitcoin is confined to this product in particular. There\u2019s no need to read anything more into it\u201c, he stated on Wednesday.\n\nFor the record, BlackRock\u2019s application for a Spot Ethereum ETF was filed in November 2023.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Users restaking Ethereum will get points that they can exchange for Clay tokens when the native tokens officially launch.\n\nCrypto staking platform ClayStack has announced it will support Ethereum (ETH) restaking via ETH native protocol EigenLayer. The platform has also announced it will give users rewards comprising Clay points and EigenLayer points.\n\nClayStack Restaking Ethereum\n\nAs part of the new offering, ClayStack will change its ETH liquid staking token known as csETH, to a liquid restaking asset. At the moment, users can only use ETH for direct restaking on EigenLayer. However, ClayStack CEO and founder Mohak Agarwal said the plan is to provide support for Rocket Pool Ether (rETH) and Lido staked Ether (stETH) very soon.\n\nEigenLayer launched in June 2023 and has significantly driven Ethereum staking since then. By November, the protocol had processed 170,000 ETH in staking. As of Tuesday, the total value locked (TVL) on EigenLayer is $1.7 billion.\n\nRestaking is a process that uses liquid staking tokens and staked Ether to improve earnings across multiple platforms. It combines traditional staking, which locks tokens to generate rewards, and liquid staking, which also creates rewards but by using liquid tokens as representations of locked assets.\n\nClayStack started liquid staking for the MATIC token in 2022. It then launched ETH liquid staking in September 2023, and is now focusing on ETH staking. On moving on from Polygon, CEO Agarwal said:\n\n\u201cDue to shrinking yield and the limited DeFi ecosystem on Polygon outside major ones like Compound and Aave (which delisted the majority of the less traded or volatile assets), it became very difficult to build more utility on Polygon liquid staking.\u201d\n\nReward Points\n\nClayStack has plans to launch its network token and is offering early users of its ETH staking service the opportunity to earn. According to the platform, restakers who earn clay points can redeem them 1:1 for clay tokens. Agarwal pointed out that \u201cthere is no other points system currently that offers 1:1 redemption. You can own 1 million points in other programs and you could end up getting 100 tokens.\u201d\n\nThe plan is to allocate 20 clay points per ETH each week. While the rate may change weekly, users have no minimum or maximum points to maintain. Nonetheless, ClayStack will maintain a cap on points that all users can get. This cap will refresh weekly.\n\nIn addition to Clay points, users will also get EigenLayer restaked points. Agarwal said:\n\n\u201cWhen ClayStack natively restakes the ETH on \u00c9igenLayer, ClayStack\u2019s smart contract ends up accruing those points. We don\u2019t know what they will be redeemable to; we will just pass along those points to csETH holders, considering so much excitement amongst users for EigenLayer points.\u201d\n\nLast November, non-custodial staking services provider Stakin announced a partnership with ClayStack. The collaboration between both providers offers users a new staking experience without compromising security and resilience. Users will also enjoy more control over their staked assets.\n\nIn 2021, ClayStack received $5.2 million in seed funds from several investors, including Solana Foundation and Coinbase Ventures. ParaFi Capital and CoinFund led the seed round."

On September 7, 2023, Ark Invest became the first to file for a spot Ether ETF in the United States. The fund was initially aimed at expanding its portfolio of crypto products, at a time when the market was increasingly becoming confident of a Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nSpeaking to Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, the ARK Invest COO said the discussions with the SEC gives confidence of the possibility of an ETH ETF approval, both from legal principle and implementation standpoint. Compared to the timeline in the lead up to the spot Bitcoin ETF approval, the case for Ethereum ETF approval has changed philosophically, operationally and also legally, he explained.\n\nAccumulation Continues\n\nMeanwhile, ARK Invest chief executive officer Cathie Wood said a majority of the investment community are underestimating Bitcoin, in the context of the top cryptocurrency dropping below the $40,000 mark. Showing confidence in a potential turnaround in the prospects of crypto market, the Cathie Wood firm increased its holdings in Ark 21Shares spot Bitcoin ETF, offloading ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO).\n\nAlso Read: Terra Classic L1TF Core Security Upgrade Proposal Up For Vote, LUNC Price Soars 8%"

        "content": "Wed 24 Jan 2024 \u25aa 6 min of reading \u25aa by Family Trading \u25aa\n\nThe price of Ethereum has entered a correction phase since reaching $2,700. Let\u2019s examine the future outlook for ETH together.\n\nSituation of Ethereum (ETH)\n\nAs noted in the analysis of January 11, Ethereum marked a new high. It reached $2,700 before starting a downward movement. Ethereum plunged below the 38.2 % Fibonacci retracement level (taken from the ATH) before dropping just above its daily support at $2,150. Ethereum\u2019s medium and long-term trend remains bullish. However, the breach of this support could jeopardize the short-term trend of the token. At the time of writing, one Ether is trading around $2,200. These recent bearish movements have brought its price below the 50-day moving average. This development suggests the possibility of a trend reversal, thereby calling for increased vigilance from investors.\n\nRegarding the oscillators, they are currently below the midline, which could suggest that Ethereum is currently in an oversold state. From an optimistic angle, this could indicate that it is undervalued. However, adopting a more pessimistic view, it could be interpreted as a sign that the cryptocurrency\u2019s momentum is turning bearish. Note that the existence of a divergence between the price of Ethereum and its oscillators could reinforce this assumption.\n\nDaily ETH/USD Chart\n\nThe current technical analysis was carried out in collaboration with Elie FT, an investor and trader passionate about the cryptocurrency market. Now a trainer at Family Trading, a community of thousands of proprietary traders active since 2017. Here you will find Live sessions, educational content, and peer assistance around financial markets in a professional and warm atmosphere.\n\nFocus on Derivatives (ETHUSDT)\n\nThe open interest for Ethereum has experienced a notable decline of nearly 15% since Monday, January 22. This decrease represents a withdrawal of over $700 million in ETH/USDT perpetual contracts. Out of these withdrawals, more than $60 million were executed forcibly. Although these amounts may seem significant, their impact on the market requires a more nuanced analysis. When compared to the price evolution of ETH relative to its open interest, it becomes apparent that the latter maintains relative stability compared to the ETH price itself. This observation could indicate that entry and exit of traders in the market are not particularly high, or that new traders are entering the market at the same rate as others leave. Thus, this situation opens the door to various interpretations, such as a period of indecision in the market, possible accumulation of orders, etc.\n\nETHUSD Open Interest\n\nThe Ethereum liquidations heat map shows that the cryptocurrency has recently reached an important liquidation zone, situated between $2,200 and $2,150. At present, the price appears to be stabilizing in this area, indicating a period of uncertainty among investors. If the price cannot maintain itself above this last level, the next significant liquidation zone below its price is around $2,000. Above the current price, the $2,500 zone is also worth monitoring. The approach of the price towards these levels could lead to a massive triggering of orders, thus increasing the possibility of a period of heightened volatility on Ethereum. These zones are therefore crucial points of interest for investors.\n\nETH/USDT Liquidation Heatmap (3 months)\n\nHypotheses for Ethereum\u2019s Price (ETH)\n\nIf the price of Ethereum maintains above the $2,200 \u2013 $2,100 levels, we could anticipate a bullish continuation up to the $2,400 level. The next resistance to consider, should the bullish movement continue, would be the last peak, namely $2,700 and higher if this level is breached. At this stage, that would represent an increase of over +25%.\n\nIf the price of Ethereum fails to maintain itself above the $2,200 \u2013 $2,100 levels, we might expect a return to $2,000. The next support to consider, should the bearish movement continue, would be around the levels of $1,900. At this stage, that would represent a drop of nearly -13%.\n\nConclusion\n\nAfter marking a new high, Ethereum has initiated a correctional phase, leading it towards its former daily resistance. Could this decline be due to the delay in the decision on the Ethereum spot ETFs? What is certain is that it will be crucial to closely observe the price\u2019s reaction to the various key levels to confirm or refute the current hypotheses. It is also important to remain vigilant of potential \u201cfake outs\u201d and market \u201csqueezes\u201d in each scenario. Finally, remember that these analyses are based solely on technical criteria and that the price of cryptocurrencies can also quickly evolve based on other, more fundamental factors.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "In anticipation of the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF, Hester Peirce, a Commissioner with the US SEC, reiterated that the regulator has learned from its past mistakes, signaling the products\u2019 emergence may be smoother.\n\nEarlier this month, the SEC approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs to trade in the US. Behind this celebrated milestone was more than ten years of pursuit of the investment product, with the regulator notably rejecting several applications from many asset managers.\n\nRiding on this history, many in the industry are now speculating on whether Ethereum spot ETF might suffer the same fate as Bitcoin.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nPer Hester Peirce\u2019s position, the delays recorded in the approval process for crypto ETFs are long gone, and the commission will approach Ethereum ETFs with a different strategy.\n\nSEC Has Learned from Its Mistake\n\nOne of the major turning points for the market regulator in granting approvals for the spot Bitcoin ETF product was the defeat in the Court case against Grayscale Investments.\n\nThe asset manager sued the regulator when it initially denied its request to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) product into a full-fledged spot ETF.\n\nThe court ruled in favor of Grayscale and ordered the commission to review the applications. When asked by Coinage media\u2019s Zac Guzman whether a court case might be required before the commission approves a spot Ethereum ETF, Hester Peirce responded:\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how we\u2019re going to do our approvals \u2026 We shouldn\u2019t need a court to tell us that our approach is \u2018arbitrary and capricious\u2019 in order for us to get it right.\u201d\n\nWith Bitcoin ETF approval setting a precedent, it might only be a matter of time before Ethereum and even XRP ETF start trading in US markets.\n\nDissenting Views on Potential Ethereum ETF\n\nDespite the filings for several spot Ethereum ETF products, with the US SEC in the queue for decision, there is a diverse opinion on whether the product will be approved or not.\n\nFox Business Journalist Eleanor Terrett highlighted these discrepancies, clearly pointing out how a spot Bitcoin ETF issuer expressed confidence that spot Ethereum ETF will see the light of day.\n\nShe also noted that sources at the SEC confirmed that based on the current disposition of the regulator, Ethereum ETFs are a \u201chard no\u201d based on internal resistance to the idea for now.\n\nHowever, with the presence of BlackRock in the race once again and the firm\u2019s track record of securing approvals, Ethereum ETFs might also be close to being approved."

        "content": "Celsius has sent more Ethereum (ETH) to Coinbase.\n\nThe bankrupt crypto lender may not sell all its exchange deposits despite fears.\n\nThe moves come as Celsius is expected to launch asset distribution to customers and creditors soon.\n\nDespite the recent crypto market recovery recorded in 2023, the unwinding of assets tied to crypto firms that went under in the 2022 bear market has continued to loom large over the market.\n\nIn November 2023, Celsius, one of the bankrupt firms, gained approval to proceed with restructuring plans that required a $75 million wind-down budget and about $225 million in fiat to capitalize a new creditor-owned mining firm. Following the plan\u2019s approval, crypto market participants braced for the selling pressure, anticipating massive sell-offs in Ethereum (ETH), the firm\u2019s most significant holding, amid efforts to raise the capital.\n\nBeyond the $300 million mark, however, the firm\u2019s ETH exchange deposits have not slowed down, sparking further concern about a continued sell-off.\n\nCelsius Strikes Again?\n\nIn the past 24 hours, Celsius has moved another 18,000 ETH worth approximately $40 million to Coinbase, bringing its total ETH transfer to exchanges, including FalconX and OKX, since the approval of its restructuring plan near 281,000 ETH (about $621 million), twice the selling volume most market participants anticipated.\n\nWith the firm holding at least 550,000 ETH worth over $1.2 billion at current rates, according to Arkham Intelligence data at the time of writing, market participants are understandably concerned.\n\nIs Celsius Network Selling All Its Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nDespite the concerns, Celsius is unlikely to sell all its ETH as some fear. Per the firm\u2019s recently approved restructuring plan, it is committed to settling most creditor claims, including an estimated $2.1 billion allocation to retail customers, with a mix of liquid crypto assets like Bitcoin (BTC), ETH, and Tether (USDT).\n\nContrary to the broad market perception, in line with this plan, Celsius may not be selling all of its exchange deposits, particularly its Coinbase deposits, since January 5.

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has extended its review period for considering a proposed rule change to list the iShares Ethereum Trust spot ETF, designating March 10, 2024 as the new deadline for taking action, according to today\u2019s filing.\n\nOriginally filed by The Nasdaq Stock Market on November 21, 2023, the proposal aims to provide direct exposure to Ethereum\u2019s price movements under Nasdaq Rule 5711(d) for Commodity-Based Trust Shares.\n\nThe SEC extended the original 45-day review period, which would have ended on January 25, 2024, stating it required more time to thoroughly consider the proposal and related issues around a spot Ethereum ETF product.\n\nOriginally published for comment on December 11, 2023, the proposed rule change has received no public comments so far. Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the longer review period indicates a cautious approach by the SEC towards crypto-based ETFs amid an evolving regulatory landscape.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, has been at the forefront of integrating digital assets into traditional investment vehicles. However, the SEC\u2019s hesitancy reflects ongoing concerns over the volatility, security, and regulatory compliance of crypto products.\n\nInvestors and industry experts are closely watching the SEC\u2019s moves, as approval of such an ETF would mark a significant milestone in the mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. The extended review period suggests that the SEC is taking a thorough approach to ensure that any potential risks associated with the iShares Ethereum Trust are mitigated."

        "content": "Ethereum Dencun Upgrade Timelines Shared For Sepolia and Holesky Testnets \u2013 Mainnet Next?\n\nThe highly anticipated Ethereum hard fork Dencun is gearing up for its testnet debut on Sepolia and Holesky in the upcoming weeks.\n\nConfirming this development in a recent blog post, the Ethereum Protocol Support Team stated that the latest upgrade to the smart contract network is scheduled for January 30 and February 7.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade, a part of the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) series, will introduce the \u2018proto-danksharding\u2019 feature, which runs on data blobs. It is duly denoted with the EIP-7569 tag, and the \u2018proto-danksharding\u2019 feature is only one of the offerings.\n\nOnce they hit the public Ethereum blockchain, data blobs are expected to be more storage efficient and radically reduce layer-2 (L2) scaling solutions\u2019 rollup costs and transaction fees.\n\nCurrently, the Dencun hard fork is being battle-tested on the Goerli testnet after making its official launch on January 17.\n\nOn January 30, it would migrate to the Sepolia testnet and make its final stand on Holesky on February 7. If the testing phase proceeds without significant issues, the Dencun upgrade is slated to transition to the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nMore testnet blobs on the way .oO Dencun will activate on Sepolia Jan 30, and on Holesky Feb 7. If running a node on either network, now's the time to update it! Assuming both of these go smoothly, mainnet is next \u2705https://t.co/QbEUACix2S \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) January 25, 2024\n\nDelving into the details, the Ethereum Protocol Support Team stated that the Sepolia testnet series for Dencun will activate at 22:51:12 UTC at the epoch height of 132608. The first epoch confirming its slot succession will kick in at 4243456.\n\nOn the other hand, Holesky\u2019s launch is scheduled for 11:34:24 at the epoch height of 29696, with its first epoch slot going online at 950272.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade follows in the footsteps of the Shapella upgrade, which activated staking on the Beacon Chain after the Ethereum blockchain switched to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm.\n\nSimilar to Shapella, Dencun introduces nine features, including transient storage opcodes (EIP-1153), Beacon block root in the EVM (EIP-4788), shard blob transactions (EIP-4844), and six others.\n\nEthereum Spot ETF Approval Delayed\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum network is the second most valuable blockchain-based protocol after the Bitcoin network.\n\nControlling as much as 19% of the emerging industry, Ethereum is home to everything powered by smart contracts, including decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Metaverse, and decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nWith so many use cases, the protocol has garnered comparable or even lesser recognition than the Bitcoin network, with several legacy-backed asset management firms looking to offer exchange-traded fund (ETF) products underlying the network.\n\nOne such entity is Grayscale Asset Management, which has recently encountered a delay from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding its spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nAnd another one \u2026 @SECGov delays @Grayscale Spot Ethereum ETF application. IMO: All Ethereum ETFs will be delayed pending a conclusion to the Coinbase and Binance SEC hearings. The president to approve this ETF applies to all Proof Of Stake projects and will be delayed until\u2026 \u2014 MartyParty (@martypartymusic) January 25, 2024\n\nAlthough the Grayscale spot Ethereum ETF, like others, faces a temporary setback, many anticipate its eventual approval. The product is designed to track the Ethereum network\u2019s performance and provide users with tokenized securities underlying the digital asset."
