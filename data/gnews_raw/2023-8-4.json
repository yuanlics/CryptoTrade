        "title": "Avalanche DEX favorite Trader Joe is launching on Ethereum - Blockworks",
        "content": "Trader Joe, the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) on proof-of-stake blockchain Avalanche, has launched on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe pseudonymous Fish, co-founder of Trader Joe, told Blockworks that the DEX\u2019s decision to launch on Ethereum now was driven by the opportunity to capture the stablecoin markets on the network amid the upheaval around Curve.\n\nCurve, a well-known stablecoin DEX, suffered an exploit this week that saw over $70 million in various digital assets attacked due to a bug in Vyper, the coding language used by Curve.\n\nThis latest exploit has led many liquidity providers to sell their holdings of CRV, Curve\u2019s native token. At the time of writing, CRV currently has a token liquidity of $6.75 million, a significant dip from $70.42 million before the hacks.\n\n\u201cLPs (liquidity providers) are moving to other pools, so you\u2019re seeing a lot of volume go to other DEXes,\u201d Fish told Blockworks. \u201cWe want to join and put ourselves into that mix.\u201d\n\nCapturing the stablecoin market\n\nFish notes that Trader Joe\u2019s initial plan was to deploy on Ethereum in a month or two, around the beginning of Q4, after working on improving its auto pool technology.\n\n\u201cBut this opportunity came up, and we felt this is the best time to deploy,\u201d he said.\n\nAuto pools are designed to help automate the balance of liquidity for users passively.\n\n\u201cEthereum runs a little bit slower, it is gas intensive, and our AMMs also use a lot of gas,\u201d Fish explained. \u201cIf you\u2019re managing positions in a concentrated liquidity AMM, which requires you to rebalance often, and make a lot of transactions every day, then for the average Joe it\u2019s going to be very uncomfortable for him to market make.\u201d\n\nLuckily, managing positions in a stable stablecoin market is relatively simple, Fish said.\n\n\u201cThe price of USDC and USDT isn\u2019t going to vary that much,\u201d he said. \u201cSo in most cases, people can just deploy in that range and then earn fees from within that range.\u201d\n\nTrader Joe\u2019s initial launch on Ethereum will include stablecoin pools USDC/USDT and USDC/DAI.\n\nHow Trader Joe compares to Uniswap\n\nLike Uniswap v3, Trader Joe is a concentrated liquidity AMM, providing constrained liquidity within a tight range for its users.\n\nCompared to its competitor, its unique edge is that it offers dynamic fee components, Fish noted.\n\nOn Uniswap v3, liquidity providers are offered three fee tiers, ranging from 0.05%, 0.3% and 1%.\n\nBy contrast, on Trader Joe, there is a base fixed fee and a variable component which is dependent on the volatility within the past few seconds to minutes.\n\nTrader Joe is currently deployed on Avalanche, Arbitrum and BNB chains.\n\nAccording to data on DeFiLlama, Trader Joe has a $57.45 million TVL on Avalanche, making it the largest DEX on the network.\n\nOn Arbitrum, however, it sports a TVL of $31.9 million, a significantly less amount compared to Uniswap v3, which currently reports volumes of $261.7 million.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The count of Ethereum and Bitcoin futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) applications has increased to twelve following recent filings by Bitwise, a leading provider of index and beta crypto funds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company filed for two ETFs, with equal weight and market weight versions of their dual Bitcoin and Ethereum futures ETFs.\n\nBitwise's Bitcoin and Ether Market Cap Weight Strategy ETF, the most recent product, aims to offer market capitalization-weighted exposure to Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts, without directly investing in Bitcoin or Ether. Managed by Bitwise Investment Manager and Vident Advisory, the ETF's allocation between Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts is determined by their respective market capitalization and rebalanced monthly.\n\nThe ETF invests mainly in cash-settled, front-month futures contracts, which are contracts with the shortest time to maturity, and may also include back-month, or longer maturity contracts. Both Bitcoin and Ether Futures Contracts are standardized, cash-settled futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\n\nWhen a futures contract is about to expire, the holder, in this case, the ETF, must sell the contract and purchase new ones with a later expiration date, a process known as \"rolling\". The continuous buying and selling could lead to higher portfolio turnover for the ETF.\n\nThis brings the total number of Ether futures ETF filings to a full dozen, with a strong indication that the count will continue to rise.\n\nAs reported by U.Today, ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have revised the probability of a Bitcoin ETF approval to a promising 65%. A few months prior, the odds were pegged near an almost impossible 1%.\n\nThis revised estimate has been influenced by multiple factors, notably including the perceived softening stance of Gary Gensler, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)."

        "title": "Ethereum ETF Race Gets Hotter As SEC Receives 11 Filings In One Week - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been flooded with many applications for Ethereum (ETH) Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in just one week. The applications currently stand at 12, with the latest addition coming from ProShares, a popular fund manager.\n\nThe platform filed four applications for Ether-based ETFs, including a dual Ether and Bitcoin futures strategy ETF, an Ether Strategy ETF, and a short Ether Strategy ETF.\n\nWill The SEC Approve An Ethereum Futures ETF?\n\nThe recent surge in applications started on the 28th of July this year after Volatility Shares filed its application. Ever since, other asset management companies, including ProShares, Roundhill Financial, Bitwise, Van Eck, and Grayscale Investment, have filled submissions, with some bringing multiple applications.\n\nThe most recent application, filed on August 3 by ProShares, proposes an equal-weight Bitcoin and Ether ETF to measure the performance of holding long positions in the nearest maturing monthly Ether and Bitcoin contracts.\n\nAccording to renowned Financial Expert at Bloomberg Intelligence, James Seyffart, ProShare filed four separate applications with the SEC. Bitwise also submitted three applications, while Grayscale Investments filed two applications.\n\nHowever, despite the growing optimism, it remains to be seen if the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve these filings. The SEC has never approved an ETF that tracks Ether Futures contracts, unlike Bitcoin Futures ETFs that have been around since October 2021.\n\nMany market experts have argued that these applications are a mere gamble by these asset management companies, who do not want to miss out on being the first Ethereum ETF in the United States.\n\nETH price holds steady above $1,830 amid ETF race | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nThe likelihood of receiving the SEC\u2019s approval remains slim as the regulatory body has never approved an Ethereum futures ETF filing. Add to the mix the consistent refusal of SEC\u2019s Chair, Gary Gensler, consistent refusal to answer if the agency considers ETH a security. This has further compounded regulatory uncertainty around the network.\n\nIf none of the applications before the SEC get denied, the Ether ETFs will launch 75 days from their respective filing dates. Analysts expect the Volatility Shares ETF to lead the charge on 12th October.\n\nUnderstanding The Difference Between Futures And Spot ETF Products\n\nThe primary difference between futures and spot ETF products lies in the fact that while the former tracks the price of futures contracts, the latter requires the issuers to purchase the underlying assets. Spot ETFs are generally considered more valid since they require the fund manager to purchase and hold underlying assets.\n\nThe current spike in Ether-based applications comes amidst a wave of filings from leading asset management companies, including BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, among others. These companies are looking to offer the first spot in Bitcoin ETF in the US.\n\nInvestors and members of the crypto community remain expectant of the outcome of the SEC\u2019s consideration of the applications lying before it. Whatever decision the agency takes is likely to affect the attractiveness and accessibility of crypto investments, especially for larger institutional investors.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Since then, other asset managers, including Grayscale, Proshares, etc., have submitted new applications, with some having multiple filings.\n\nJames Seyffart, a financial expert with Bloomberg Intelligence, reported that ProShares had filed four Ethereum ETF applications with the SEC. Information on the regulator\u2019s website shows that Bitwise has made three applications, while Grayscale made two.\n\nOthers like Roundhill, VanEck, and Volatility Shares have submitted one application apiece. Meanwhile, a new name in the mix is Direxion, which filed a dual Bitcoin and Ethereum futures ETF on Aug. 2.\n\nWill the SEC approve?\n\nMarket experts have previously argued that the applications are more of a gamble by the asset managers who don\u2019t want to miss out on being the first Ethereum ETF in the U.S. However, the possibility of getting approval is slim as the SEC has never approved an Ethereum futures ETF filing.\n\nAdditionally, chair Gary Gensler consistently declined to answer if the Commission considers Ethereum a security, thereby increasing the regulatory uncertainty surrounding the blockchain network.\n\nSEC still has Bitcoin ETF applications to deal with\n\nMeanwhile, the wave of Ethereum ETF applications is coming on the heels of a deluge of Spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF applications submitted by numerous traditional financial institutions, including BlackRock, the largest asset manager globally, to the SEC.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart opined that there was a 65% chance the financial regulator could approve the Bitcoin ETF applications before it. Seyffart explained that:\n\n\u201cThe lynchpin for this current thesis is a Grayscale victory over the SEC in Federal court. Which COULD set things up for a wave of SEC approvals sometime in the 4th quarter? All depends on how much Gensler wants to fight here.\u201d\n\nMentioned in this article"

Also, we believe the SEC would have a hard time in court defending the denial of Ethereum futures ETFs after approving standard and leveraged Bitcoin futures ETFs.\u201d\n\nBalchunas predicts the SEC will approve an Ethereum futures ETF in October, two years after the approval of the first Bitcoin (BTC) futures ETF.\n\nNo US Bitcoin spot ETF applications have been greenlit thus far, though the crypto world eagerly awaits the SEC\u2019s decision on a June application from BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF would give investors exposure to the crypto asset through a brokerage firm, much like commodities such as gold.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Penultimate moves for BTC, ETH as volatility grows for XRP - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price is bearishly heading into the weekend and could break below the $29,182 support level as volatility wanes.\n\nEthereum price downtrend could continue amid falling momentum and the aura of a bearish BTC.\n\nRipple price eyes further break down as bears capitalize on increasing volatility to seize the market.\n\nBitcoin price is trading with a bearish bias on the 15-minute timeframe, an outlook that has been mimicked by both Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) price as crypto markets slide into the weekend with modesty and calm. Accordingly, experts do not expect any quick movements for the next couple of days, even as triangles form on intraday charts.\n\nAlso Read: Binance approving SHIB as a collateralized asset causes 10 billion in open interest as Shiba Inu price rises.\n\nBitcoin price slides into the weekend with calm\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is testing the lower boundary of a triangle pattern forming on the 15-minute chart, with an overall bearish outlook after flipping the 200-, 100- and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) at $29,224, $29,218, and $9,223 levels respectively from a support to a resistance level.\n\nAs the weekend settles in, Bitcoin price may not record a striking move, as is characteristic of weekend volatility, except for the current bearish pull that continues to force BTC southward. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is heading south as the histograms of the Awesome Oscillators also drop, suggesting falling momentum.\n\nAn increase in selling pressure could see Bitcoin price test the early August lows at around $29,038 to collect liquidity before a possible uptrend.\n\nBTC/USDT 15-min chart\n\nConversely, an increase in buying pressure above current levels could see Bitcoin price bounce north, first shattering past the resistance confluence between the three EMAs before a possible tag of the upper boundary of the technical formation. However, for a confirmed uptrend, Bitcoin price must record a decisive 15-minute candlestick close above $29,359.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price holds above $29,000 after below-expectations US NFP data.\n\nEthereum price mimics BTC\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is following on the heels of BTC, heading south in the 15-minute timeframe with its price action consolidating into a triangle. Noteworthy, such technical formations are often penultimate (second from last) and moving in a trend. In the case of BTC and ET, the overall trend is a bearish correction that began after the July peak.\n\nAs momentum continues to fall, indicated by the southbound RSI and the reducing AO histograms, the bearish grip for Ethereum price could increase, sending the PoS token lower, potentially breaching the $1,836 support. In the dire case, ETH could extend lower to find support at around the $1,831 support level. This would be the most likely turnaround point for ETH.\n\nETH/USDT 15-min chart\n\nConversely, a resurgence by bulls could see Ethereum price bounce from the lower trendline of the triangle and head north to flip the three EMAs back to support. However, the gloomy outlook would only be invalidated upon a strong move above the $1,849 resistance level.\n\nAlso Read: Ether ETF applications flood the SEC as ProShares files the 11th\n\nRipple price volatility increases\n\nRipple (XRP) price is also sliding, with an overall bearish outlook that could extend if bulls continue sitting on their hands. As overhead pressure continues to build, XRP could soon breach the immediate support at $0.657 to collect the liquidity underneath.\n\nThis liquidity could help stabilize the market and give bulls a possible reentry point, but delayed entry could see Ripple price extend further south before finding a turnaround point. Noteworthy, as XRP heads south, it continuously writes off the July 13 gains.\n\nXRP/USDT 15-min chart\n\nIf sidelined and late investors come in, Ripple price could be headed north, with a successful escape from the foothold of the 50-,100-, and 200-day EMA at $0.663, $0.665, and $0.671, respectively, confirming the uptrend.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple plan to re-engage with US market could trigger XRP price recovery."

The price was rejected at the resistance trendline, leading to a 5% drop in the price of ETC over the last five days.\n\nThe falling price of Ethereum Classic warns of a prolonged selling spree if it breaks below the channel pattern.\n\nCurrently, the ETC prices struggle to take second support at the 50% Fibonacci level at $17.83. However, the price action still depicts a bullish flag pattern and maintains the positive reversal theory. The price action also depicts a double bottom forming at $17.83, increasing the reversal chances.\n\nAdditionally, the RSI and MACD indicators fail to display any bullish divergence to support a reversal theory. The RSI line falls trends lower than the halfway line with an uptick. Meanwhile, the MACD indicator shows a remarkable growth in bearish histograms.\n\nCurrently, the ETC price forms a doji candle at the support confluence of the 50% Fibonacci level and the support trendline. This projects a possibility of a morning star pattern formation, leading to a bull cycle within the channel to $18.75.\n\nOn an optimistic side note, the flag breakout rally can pump the ETH prices by 15% to challenge the overhead supply at $20.\n\nOn the flip side, a fall below the 50% Fibonacci level will plunge the ETC prices to $17."

        "title": "Learn why Ethereum Classic and Monero Miners switching to Bitcoin Spark - CoinCodex",
        "content": "A new project fast attracting miners' attention as it demystifies the mining difficulty is now here. Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Monero (XMR) miners are showing an increasing interest in the latest addition to the crypto world, Bitcoin Spark (BTCS). Let\u2019s explore why Bitcoin Spark is an appealing option for Ethereum Classic and Monero miners.\n\nBitcoin Spark (BTCS)\n\nBitcoin Spark is a Bitcoin hard fork providing alternatives to the energy-intensive Bitcoin mining process. This emerging cryptocurrency attracts attention due to its unique features appealing to miners seeking rewarding mining opportunities. Unlike Bitcoin\u2019s Proof-of-work mechanism, Bitcoin Spark uses an all-new blockchain technology called \"Proof-Of-Process\" (PoP). PoP combines PoS and PoW for a streamlined process that moderates entry barriers to mining, allowing anyone to mine. The Bitcoin Spark PoP mechanism strives for equitable distribution of mining rewards irrespective of computational power and application of the proof-of-work system by renting out mining device processing power to various entities. The proprietary proof-of-work/proof-of-stake approach allows processing power to be rented out for different purposes.\n\nA Bitcoin Spark application makes mining accessible to all, regardless of the stake, and computational power, as miners are algorithmically selected. The BTCS team is developing a user-friendly mining program compatible with various devices, ensuring secure virtual access. The app, doubling up as a wallet, is compatible with Linux, Mac OS, iOS, Windows, and Android.\n\nThis platform fosters security and true decentralization, preventing any single entity from dominating the network. Bitcoin Spark mitigates the risk of single miners gaining excessive control and compromising network security by avoiding linear reward computation. Using multiple devices and miners for transaction finality further enhances network security. Mining rewards are distributed through a revenue-based system, ensuring profitability and self-sustainability for a stable network.\n\nBitcoin Spark's ICO phase one is set to kick off in August, offering one BTCS token at $1.50. Early adopters will be rewarded with a 20% bonus. With such affordability, imagine buying Bitcoin when it was only 1$. The enticing opportunity to purchase Bitcoin Spark at such a low price evokes thoughts of its early days. BTCS potentially yields impressive 800% returns when the token launches at $10.\n\nHow to mine Ethereum Classic?\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) is the original Ethereum blockchain that did not undergo a hard fork after the 2016 DAO hack. It supports layer 2 scaling solutions, aiming to make blockchain transactions faster and cheaper. ETC relies on Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining, making it a decentralized and open-source platform. Miners use GPUs and ASIC mining rigs to participate in creating ETC tokens, and mining through a pool is currently profitable. ETC and Ethereum use the same Ethash algorithm, but ETC's lower hash rate allows for faster block generation. Miners play a crucial role in securing the network and preventing double-spending attacks. To mine ETC, one needs an ETC wallet, suitable hardware, mining software, and the choice between solo, cloud mining, or joining a mining pool.\n\nHow to mine Monero?\n\nMonero cryptocurrency uses proof-of-work mining with the RandomX algorithm to achieve distributed consensus. It aims to maintain egalitarian mining, making it ASIC-resistant and allowing everyone to mine using consumer-grade hardware. Miners can choose between solo mining or mining in a pool, with each method having pros and cons. Solo mining increases network security but may take longer to find blocks, while pool mining offers frequent payouts but requires trusting a centralized pool. P2Pool is another option, providing the benefits of both solo and pool mining. Monero can be mined on CPUs and GPUs, and various mining software options are available. However, the Monero Project does not endorse a specific pool, software, or hardware.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin Spark offers a sweet deal for Ethereum Classic and Monero miners to consider. With its unique PoP consensus mechanism, efficient use of processing power, and focus on fair reward distribution, Bitcoin Spark addresses the limitations of other cryptocurrencies.\n\nLearn more on Bitcoin Spark here:\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article.

        "title": "Could Ethereum help stop museums from hoarding stolen artifacts? These researchers think so - Blockworks",
        "content": "Researchers are developing an Ethereum-based blockchain tool called Salsal to help museums and cultural institutions organize and keep track of valuable historical collections.\n\nMark Altaweel, a professor in the archeology department at the University College of London, has been working on Salsal alongside colleagues at Abu Dhabi University for roughly two years.\n\nAltaweel said putting history on the blockchain would be the first step toward \u201cdecolonizing museums\u201d and taking back the past.\n\n\u201cBlockchain\u2026allows a decentralized way in dealing with and managing heritage. So if I have expertise about something, and you have expertise about something, we can all participate in these networks,\u201d he told Blockworks in an interview.\n\nExpertise is the key thing Salsal needs to achieve wide adoption. Museums and collectors would submit their collections of historical objects to the Salsal blockchain. Experts, such as archaeologists, would then examine each artifact to determine their condition, provenance, and whether they were legally obtained.\n\nExperts on the Salsal network, which will be a partially-private version of Ethereum, will use the Museum Association\u2019s sliding scale rating standard. A rating of one means the collection and/or items were legally and ethically obtained with plenty of documentation. A rating of five means the items \u201chave clear evidence that they were obtained illegally,\u201d according to Salsal\u2019s white paper.\n\nIf a collection is shown to be ethically and legally legitimate with enough documentation to reasonably prove where the items came from, \u201cthe collector can then turn their collection into NFTs.\u201d\n\nThe NFT portion of the Salsal network will be the public aspect of the blockchain, so people will be able to see and purchase them. This has the added benefit of monetarily supporting museums and collectors.\n\n\u201cCultural institutions tend to have struggles with things like fundraising. So giving some carrots for people to be involved is what the NFTs are for,\u201d Altaweel said.\n\nObviously, concerns brewed among Altaweel and his colleagues that illegitimate collections could profit with this incentive in place, so they have removed the option for items that don\u2019t meet experts\u2019 standards to be fashioned into NFTs.\n\nAdditionally, Altaweel wants to show all the collections they receive \u2014 even the ones with a \u2018five\u2019 rating \u2014 on the blockchain for transparency\u2019s sake. It\u2019s also his strategy for holding museums with shady ethical practices accountable in terms of holding items of historical significance that were stolen from other cultures.\n\nMany have accused the British Museum in London of retaining pilfered items, some of which were taken during colonial conquests by the British Empire. Some examples of these include the Benin Bronzes from Nigeria, the Parthenon Marbles from Greece, and the Rosetta Stone from Egypt.\n\nThe governments of Nigeria and Greece have requested these priceless items back at one point or another. A group of prominent Egyptian archaeologists called for the return of the Rosetta Stone in October 2022.\n\nAltaweel wants to discourage situations like this in the future with his tool.\n\nRead more: Sandbox, British Museum shepherding history into \u2018new online era\u2019 with metaverse exhibits\n\nThe other inherent use case for Salsal is to have a running, immutable record of the collections stored in museums around the world.\n\nAltaweel brought up how the Baghdad Museum in Iraq was looted during the US invasion of the city in 2003 as part of the US\u2019 war on terror. Anticipating chaos, museum staff vacated the premises two days before the invasion, which allowed thieves to roam the halls and take whatever they wanted.\n\nIn all, 15,000 objects were stolen from the museum, according to a 2018 analysis by the University of Sydney.\n\n\u201cWhile 7,000 items have been recovered, more than 8,000 remain unaccounted for, including artifacts thousands of years old from some of the earliest sites in the Middle East,\u201d the university wrote.\n\nAltaweel likes to imagine that a tool like Salsal, with enough adoption by museums around the world, could prevent future acts of cultural vandalism.\n\nIf records of all the items in the Baghdad Museum had been in a blockchain, Altaweel argues that \u201cyou would not only know what\u2019s missing, but the community would be involved in looking for these objects.\u201d\n\nHaving a record on chain makes it so attestation of ownership and authenticity can\u2019t be destroyed or lost. On-chain storage also allows anyone with an internet connection to view records, which in this case would decentralize control away from museums and better enable the public to help identify and report stolen items, should they reappear in the future.\n\nAltaweel and his colleagues have been pitching Salsal primarily to museums in Abu Dhabi, including the Louvre located in the emirate. They\u2019re also looking to attract funding, something Altaweel said has been tough during the summer.\n\nSalsal is still in its test version, but the overall goal is to launch it on Ethereum within six months, he said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

According to researcher Alex Stokes from the Ethereum Foundation, October 2023 is a feasible goal date for Cancun's activation.\n\nHere's latest update per Ethereum ACDE call\n\nTim Beiko, an Ethereum developer, provided a quick summary of yesterday's biweekly ACDE call, which focused on testing efforts and preparations for the Deneb upgrade.\n\nAll Core Devs \u2013 Execution (ACDE) call recap by @TimBeiko\n\n\n\nScreenshot from Eth R&D Discord pic.twitter.com/HERlPQDBrQ \u2014 abcoathup.eth \ud83d\udc21 \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@abcoathup) August 3, 2023\n\nDevelopers have decided to use a standard contract rather than a precompile for EIP-4788. Going forward, developers will attempt to come up with a deployment scheme and accept a first contract implementation to utilize.\n\nOnce this is agreed to, an audit /formal verification process will be started. According to Beiko, the devnet 8 launch will be put on hold until implementations for the new 4788 spec are received. Devnet 7 was released in late June to raise the blob limit from two to three and the maximum blob limit from four to six.\n\nBeiko also highlighted that clarifications for EIP 6780 will be merged as well as execution APIs Engine API. At the meeting, two abstraction EIPs, 5806 and 7377, were presented and discussed."

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is an ever-evolving landscape, with each asset having its own dynamics. Ethereum, the leading altcoin, is currently generating considerable attention, with analysts referring to it as a \"ticking bomb.\" This phrase, intriguing as it is, signals the potential for explosive growth in Ethereum's future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe primary focus here is on the ETH/BTC trading pair, suggesting it might be the right time for investors to shift their investments from Bitcoin to Ethereum. This notion stems from the recent market behavior in which Bitcoin has shown some short-term weakness. On the contrary, Ethereum, despite experiencing a slump below $1,900, is signaling impending bullish momentum.\n\nAt this point, Ethereum is trading between the 50 and 200 EMAs (Exponential Moving Averages), indicating that it is in a phase of consolidation. Both the volume and the RSI (Relative Strength Index), a metric used to assess overbought or oversold conditions, are descending. This could be an early sign of a potential trend reversal.\n\nThe term \"high-beta plays\" refers to investments that are more volatile than the overall market. These assets have a beta greater than one, meaning they are expected to exhibit larger price swings. The advice to avoid high-beta plays suggests that the focus should be on establishing a strong core portfolio of stable investments rather than taking high risks in pursuit of quick gains.\n\nThe general consensus among market analysts is that Ethereum might be on the brink of a \"spectacular run.\" While Bitcoin may enjoy a brief rally, Ethereum's potential for growth appears to be higher. The primary message to investors is to bide their time and focus on building a resilient, diversified portfolio capable of weathering potential storms and taking advantage of the upcoming bull market."

        "title": "Here's Why Arbitrum Became #1 Ethereum L2 Scaler: Opinion - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAmid aggressive competition in the Ethereum (ETH) L2s segment, it remains pretty concentrated. Almost 90% of its aggregated total value locked (TVL) is controlled by three networks. Here's how Arbitrum (ARB) keeps its supremacy in this field.\n\nArbitrum succeeds since it remains \"credibly neutral,\" Patrick McCorry says\n\nCryptocurrency researcher Patrick McCorry, former assistant professor at King's College London, is sure that \"credible neutrality\" is one of the reasons behind Arbitrum (ARB), Ethereum-based network's success. Its team has never launched \"official\" decentralized applications on Arbitrum (ARB), leaving space for open competition.\n\nIn my opinion as an observer, one of the reasons why Arbitrum has been successful to date is that the ecosystem did not pick a favourite and remained credibly neutral.\n\n\n\nWithout favourites, it allows anyone to feel like they can deploy on the chain and compete as an equal. https://t.co/fcM5IMVQ55 \u2014 Patrick McCorry (\ud83d\udc99,\ud83e\udde1) (@stonecoldpat0) August 5, 2023\n\nWith no \"favorite\" applications officially supported by Arbitrum DAO and Offchain Labs, any team can come to the blockchain and start deploying \"like an equal.\"\n\nMcCorry's position echoes that of the Arbitrum (ARB) community head, who slammed the L1s and L2s that created their own applications on corresponding blockchain networks:\n\nThe worst thing a chain team can do is start creating their own native dApps or products on top of it. You just end up being in direct competition with teams building on your chain within that vertical\n\nArbitrum (ARB) has never endorsed any applications as its \"native\": All crucial protocols using it as a technical basis are created by third-party teams.\n\nAs covered by U.Today, there is strong evidence that Arbitrum's (ARB) growth is fueled by real usage in DeFi: Airdrop hunters are only responsible for 5-6% of its transactions.\n\nArbitrum vs Optimism rivalry gains traction\n\nBy press time, Arbitrum (ARB) remains the largest Ethereum-based network by TVL: It has accumulated $5.93 billion in liquidity across all of its verified protocols. This is equal to 56.16% of the whole Ethereum L2s ecosystem. Its closest competitor Optimism (OP) is responsible for $2.95 billion, or 27.8% of liquidity.\n\nHowever, in the past week, Optimism (OP) has surpassed its rival in a number of crucial metrics, starting from the number of daily on-chain transactions.\n\nIt was also closer to surpassing Arbitrum (ARB) in the net number of daily active addresses. However, both metrics might only be rallying due to the hype around Worldcoin (WDC), a controversial eye-scanning project by OpenAI's Sam Altman.\n\nThat is why analysts are sure that nothing poses a threat to Arbitrum's (ARB) dominance in the L2s segment it has kept for a couple of months."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe odds of approval for Ethereum futures ETFs have jumped to 75%, according to a recent note by ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas. This is the same rate they attributed to Bitcoin futures ETFs in September 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of applications for Ethereum and Bitcoin futures ETFs has increased to twelve, thanks in part to recent submissions by Bitwise, a top firm in the field of index and beta cryptocurrency funds.\n\nCryptocurrency futures ETFs provide investors with exposure to cryptocurrency futures contracts rather than offering direct investment in the mercurial asset class.\n\nThe first bitcoin-linked exchange-traded fund (ETF) from ProShares, which tracks the bitcoin futures market made its debut in October 2021. It helped to revive the Bitcoin bull run after marking a significant regulatory milestone for the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nDespite not allowing investors to buy crypto directly, this futures-based ETF could pave the way for the approval of spot ETFs in the future.\n\nIs a Bitcoin spot ETF about to get approved?\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Seyffart and Balchunas have also revised the approval odds for a spot Bitcoin ETF upwards to 65% from 50% a few weeks ago.\n\nThe increased likelihood of Bitcoin ETF approval is influenced by SEC Chairman Gary Gensler's potentially more receptive stance and strategic moves by leading crypto investment firms like Grayscale and BlackRock\n\nThe first leveraged Bitcoin ETF\n\nOn a historic note, the SEC greenlighted the first leveraged Bitcoin ETF last month. This trailblazing product has attracted a tide of over $4 million in trading volume during the first day, with approximately half a million dollars worth of shares being scooped up within the first quarter of an hour."

Based on the SEC\u2019s deadlines, the first in line for approval or denial is Volatility Shares\u2019 Ethereum Strategy ETF, by October 11.\n\n\u201cThe SEC appears to be changing its posture towards crypto, based on reports of its back channel messaging to ETF issuers,\u201d wrote the analysts. \u201cWe believe the SEC would have a hard time in court defending the denial of Ethereum futures ETFs after approving standard and leveraged Bitcoin futures ETFs. \u201c\n\nBitcoin Spot ETF Approval Odds\n\nAs of August 4, there are 9 active Bitcoin spot ETF applications pending review by the SEC, with the latest applicant being from CBOE on behalf of the Global X Bitcoin Trust.\n\nLike all other applications, CBOE\u2019s latest filing selects Coinbase as a surveillance-sharing partner for detecting market manipulation \u2013 a crucial issue for the SEC for which its denied every major spot ETF application so far.\n\nShares for a Bitcoin spot ETF are backed by actual BTC held under custody by the trust and its partners. By contrast, futures ETFs are backed by Bitcoin futures contracts, which may not perfectly track the price of BTC at any particular time.\n\nUnlike competitors, Grayscale is vying to convert its Bitcoin trust into a spot ETF by battling the SEC in court. The company argues that the regulator\u2019s approval of futures ETFs, but not spot ETFs, demonstrates \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d treatment of the latter.\n\nRecently, Bloomberg analysts raised their odds of a Bitcoin spot ETF approval this year to 65%, which they expect will come on the back of a Grayscale court victory."

        "content": "Ethereum price is struggling to keep support at $1,830 intact, while the entire crypto market continues with its longstanding lull. Since the rejection from $2,000 around mid-July, recovery attempts have been minimal, with the least resistance path mainly downward.\n\nBased on the prevailing technical picture, bears have the upper hand, especially with Ethereum price below all the major moving averages such as the 50-day EMA (red), the 100-day EMA (blue), and the 200-day EMA (purple).\n\nadvertisement\n\nSupport at $1,830 is critical for the resumption of the uptrend, but if declines intensify, the buyer congestion at $1,800 will come in handy.\n\nEthereum Price Final Capitulation\n\nThe crypto winter has lasted well over two years with attribute to many attacks on the blockchain ecosystem, including the Terra crash \u201cthrough which governments are stepping in with a regulatory framework\u2026 to protect investors,\u201d Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, a popular analyst told investors on Friday.\n\nThis push to regulate the market, although understandable, is exerting a lot of pressure to the extent of risking the survival of the crypto ecosystem.\n\nIn addition to the recently resolved matter between Ripple and the SEC, the regulator is suing Coinbase and Binance, and the DoJ has been investigating the latter exchange platform. In all this, proposals for Ethereum and Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have surged in the past couple of months, bringing institutions like Blackrock and Valkyrie into the industry.\n\nEthereum and most other altcoins, according to Poppe, \u201chave been trending downwards for 18-24 months straight.\n\nHowever, one notable fundamental factor is that the supply on exchange continues to shrink to the lowest levels while staking both on the Ethereum protocol and liquid staking platforms like Lido soar to the highest levels since the implementation of the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nThe mundane market structure represents \u201cthe second stage of capitulation, which is time.\u201d Investors will continue to feel like markets are unresponsive, with some shunning crypto for other industry sectors.\n\nAs for investors, perhaps excluding traders, it is wise to keep calm and be patient with the market. Accumulation, according to Poppe the best strategy at the moment, with institutions like Blackrock jumping in.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for Ethereum Price in The Short Term?\n\nThe bearish outlook in both the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and the Money Flow Index (MFI) hints at declines continuing to $1,800 in the short term. In addition to the sell signal, the MACD holds below the mean line (0.00), further reinforcing the bearish grip.\n\nIf bulls manage the arrest the bearish situation at $1,830 traders can prepare to seek fresh exposure to ETH longs after the price steps above the 100-day EMA. The subsequent break above the 50-day EMA at $1,866 would serve as confirmation for a stronger uptrend to be validated by recovery past the descending trendline for gains above $2,000.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Cardano\u2019s development activity was substantially higher compared to Ethereum.\n\nADA\u2019s price dropped by 6% last week, but there was a possibility of a trend reversal.\n\nCardano [ADA] has outperformed the king of altcoins, Ethereum [ETH], by a huge margin in terms of development activity. In fact, data suggested that ADA\u2019s development activity consistently remained three times higher than Ethereum.\n\nRead Cardano\u2019s [ADA] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThis metric has been reflected in the blockchain\u2019s efforts to push out new updates over the last few months, the latest being the Mithril mainnet upgrade.\n\nCardano\u2019s development activity remains high\n\nIt was interesting to note that Cardano\u2019s development activity rose substantially over the last month. Its development activity contributor count also remained high.\n\nA major reason for this uptrend can be attributed to the recent Mithril mainnet launch, which aimed to reduce the time required for nodes to sync with the blockchain.\n\nAfter the mainnet update was pushed, Cardano\u2019s multiple teams continued to work on other projects, which were highlighted in the blockchain\u2019s latest edition of its weekly development report.\n\nAs per the report, Mithril mainnet has been consistently producing new certificates and snapshots. The Mithril team also worked on upgrading the Cardano node to v.8.1.2, fixing the release-preprod network that stopped producing certificates.\n\nThis week\u2019s #Cardano development update is live on #EssentialCardano! Read the report to learn about the latest on core technology, wallets and services, smart contracts, scaling, governance, #ProjectCatalyst, and #Cardano education. https://t.co/6DOQ2DXVMQ pic.twitter.com/P2MUJNmOMi \u2014 Input Output (@InputOutputHK) August 4, 2023\n\nApart from the BASHO team, the Plutus core team worked on adding decentralized governance support, as defined in CIP-1694, to Plutus v3. The Lace team continued the implementation of Posthog analytics and dedicated efforts to add Trezor support and implement the multi-delegation feature.\n\nThe report also mentioned updated statistics of the Cardano blockchain. The blockchain\u2019s total transactions reached 72.7 million, while its native tokens exceeded 8.6 million.\n\nMoreover, the number of projects building on ADA reached 1,271, while the number of projects launched touched 136.\n\nADA investors aren\u2019t content\n\nWhile development activity remained high, the native token\u2019s price action turned bearish. As per CoinMarketCap, ADA\u2019s price declined by more than 6% over the last week. At press time, it was trading at $0.2915 with a market capitalization of over $10 billion.\n\nThe price drop caused its MVRV Ratio to plummet. Additionally, negative sentiment around Cardano also remained relatively high. However, the whales continued to show interest in ADA, as evident from its high whale transaction count.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Cardano Profit Calculator\n\nThe good news was that the bearish price trend might come to an end in the coming days. This possibility was pointed out by Coinglass. According to the chart, Cardano\u2019s Open Interest was declining.\n\nA drop in the metric usually means that the on-going market trend might change, giving hope for a price uptick."

        "content": "Bloomberg\u2019s ETF analyst believes that ProShares\u2019 multiple Ether-based ETF applications within a short period may indicate a favorable stance from the SEC.\n\nThe race for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is heating up, as ProShares, a leading global asset manager, recently filed applications with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focusing on bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). The application, submitted on August 3, includes a proposal for the Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight ETF, designed to measure \u201cthe performance of holding long positions in the nearest maturing monthly bitcoin and ether futures contracts.\u201d\n\nBitwise filed its application on the same date in a parallel move, seeking approval for an ETF that equally weights exposure to Bitcoin and Ether. The fund aims to track \u201cthe performance of holding long positions in the nearest maturing monthly bitcoin and ether futures contracts.\u201d\n\nProShares Becomes the 11th Company to File for Ethereum ETF\n\nIt is important to note that ProShares and Bitwise have taken different steps in expanding their crypto-related funds. ProShares has already been active in the digital asset space, having previously filed applications for other cryptocurrency-related ETFs, including one focused on the metaverse.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitwise joins the fray with a series of ETF applications for Ethereum. Notably, the SEC has received a total of 11 Ether-related ETF filings in less than a week, all of which are centered on futures ETFs. The wave of applications began with Volatility Shares filing for the Ether Strategy ETF on July 28. ProShares is now adding its own Ether ETF proposals to the mix, making the company the 11th to join the race. The fund manager filed for a total of four Ether-related ETFs within a few days, including a dual Bitcoin and Ether futures strategy ETF, a short Ether strategy ETF and an Ether strategy ETF.\n\nUPDATE: Another one\u2026. 11 ETFs Filed\u2026 Proshares filed for a 4th ETF with Ethereum futures. This one is an equal weight #Bitcoin & #Ethereum ETF just like Bitwise's filing which dropped an hour ago. https://t.co/vB05Wvt33e pic.twitter.com/u3I3LzznGZ \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) August 3, 2023\n\nWhile Bitcoin futures ETFs have been available since October 2021, the SEC has yet to approve any ETF that tracks Ether futures contracts, making these applications a focal point of market attention.\n\nA Favorable Stance from the SEC\n\nMarket analysts and experts hold varying opinions on the potential outcomes of these filings. Bloomberg\u2019s ETF analyst, James Seyffart, believes that ProShares\u2019 multiple Ether-based ETF applications within a short period may indicate a favorable stance from the SEC. However, he also acknowledged the regulatory challenges related to approving ETFs based on Ether futures contracts, which the SEC has been cautious about in the past.\n\nIn contrast, Lark Davis, a well-known crypto influencer, expressed skepticism about the prospects of spot crypto ETFs. He is critical of futures-based ETFs, citing concerns about potential market manipulation and calling for a focus on spot ETF approvals.\n\nThe recent influx of ETF applications comes amid speculation about the SEC\u2019s stance toward digital assets. Retail investors have shown increasing interest in ETFs, and market observers believe that the approval of ETFs could pave the way for the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAs the SEC reviews these applications, the cryptocurrency community eagerly awaits the regulatory decisions that could shape the future of digital asset investments and broaden the accessibility of virtual assets to retail investors."

        "content": "Mastering the Art of NFT Annihilation: Unraveling the Mystery of How to Burn an NFT\n\n\u200dThe non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace has become a bustling hub of digital art, innovation, and investment.\n\nBut what happens when you want to obliterate an NFT from existence? Enter the intriguing world of NFT burning.\n\nAlso read: Dogecoin Army Buzzing with Anticipation After Elon Musk\u2019s Tweet\n\nThis comprehensive guide will walk you through How to Burn a non-fungible token, including its purpose, steps on various blockchains, and implications for your digital asset\u2019s future.\n\nSource: Information Age\n\nThe Art of NFT Destruction: Can NFTs Be Obliterated?\n\nNon-fungible tokens, once minted on the blockchain, become immutable digital assets.\n\nHowever, you can destroy or \u201cburn\u201d them through a process similar to sending the token into a digital black hole.\n\nThis act, known as \u201cburning,\u201d sends the token to an inaccessible, unspendable address, effectively wiping it from existence.\n\nAlso read: Shiba Inu: $1000 Investment on ShibaSwap Debut, Profit Revealed\n\nBurning an NFT: What Does It Entail?\n\nThe act of burning a non-fungible token is synonymous with completely deleting it. It involves the transfer of a token to an address that remains inaccessible to all.\n\nOnce a non-fungible token is burned, it is impossible to retrieve it. Hence, it is crucial to be sure that burning is your desired course of action.\n\nInterestingly, as the digital asset dissolves, its history and record remain imprinted on the blockchain, providing evidence of its existence and subsequent annihilation.\n\nThe Void Address: Understanding the Token Burn Address\n\nSource: Cointurk\n\nAn NFT burn address is a specialized wallet address that acts as a digital incinerator for tokens. Also known as an \u201caddress eater,\u201d this null address is inaccessible and holds no keys.\n\nIt is the ultimate lock without a key.\n\nOn the Ethereum blockchain, the burn address is often represented as 0x0000000000000000000000000000dEaD.\n\nPolygon\u2019s burn address appears as 0x0000000000000000000000000000, while Solana employs the burn address \u2018 remove.sol.\u2019\n\nDispatching an NFT to these addresses permanently eliminates it from circulation.\n\nThe Price of NFT Annihilation: Does Burning an NFT Cost Anything?\n\nYes, the process of burning an NFT incurs a cost.\n\nThis transaction fee, colloquially referred to as a \u201cgas fee,\u201d is required to process the burning of your non-fungible token.\n\nThe fee can fluctuate based on the current supply and demand on the blockchain.\n\nThe cost of burning an NFT can range anywhere from $0.00025 to $100.\n\nThe Step-by-Step Guide: How to Burn an NFT\n\nThe burning process is straightforward. Below is a step-by-step guide to burning your NFT on popular blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon.\n\nIncinerating an Ethereum NFT\n\nHere\u2019s your guide on How to Burn an NFT on Ethereum:\n\nAccess the wallet or marketplace holding your NFT. Choose the NFT you wish to burn and hit the \u201cTransfer\u201d button. Direct your NFT to Ethereum\u2019s official burn address, which is 0x00000000000000000000000000000000dEaD. Settle the required gas fees to transfer your NFT and click \u201cConfirm.\u201d\n\nWith these steps, your NFT will be permanently dissolved and removed from the marketplace. Remember, gas fees can vary based on supply and demand on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nBurning a Polygon NFT\n\nThe process of burning an NFT on the Polygon blockchain mirrors that of Ethereum, except for the burn address.\n\nHere\u2019s how:\n\nNavigate to the item page for the NFT you wish to burn. Click on the transfer button. Enter the Polygon burn address: 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000. Hit \u201cTransfer,\u201d confirm the transaction with your wallet, pay the gas fees, and you\u2019re done!\n\nObliterating a Solana NFT\n\nBurning an NFT on Solana differs slightly from other NFT blockchains.\n\nThe Phantom Wallet, a popular Solana wallet, has built-in burning features that reward users with SOL for burning certain NFTs.\n\nFor NFTs that aren\u2019t supported by the built-in burning features, use the following steps:\n\nOpen your Solana wallet and locate the NFT you wish to burn. Add the \u2018 remove.sol \u2018 wallet address in the recipient field. Confirm the transaction and pay the associated gas fees.\n\nThe \u2018remove.sol\u2019 address is a graveyard for unwanted NFTs.\n\nOnce you send your NFT there, there\u2019s no turning back; the burning process becomes irreversible.\n\nMonetary Compensation for Burning an NFT: Is It Possible?\n\nMonetary compensation for burning an NFT is platform-dependent.\n\nWhile Ethereum and Polygon offer no return, platforms like the Phantom Wallet provide a unique mechanism that rewards users with SOL for burning certain NFTs.\n\nHence, it\u2019s advisable to check the specifics of the platform used to determine if it offers a reward.\n\nReasons to Burn an NFT: Why Would You Do It?\n\nThe act of burning an NFT serves several purposes.\n\nIt can be a strategic tool to control the value of an asset. Since NFTs appreciate when demand surpasses supply, reducing the supply via burning can potentially increase the price of the remaining tokens.\n\nBurning can also expunge flawed or redundant tokens from circulation, which is particularly useful when an excess number of tokens devalues individual tokens.\n\nMoreover, burning NFTs can help build trust and credibility, especially during the early phases of a token\u2019s lifecycle.\n\nCreators often burn unsold tokens post-launch to demonstrate accountability and safeguard the interests of token buyers, enhancing their credibility.\n\nCertain token collections also incentivize holders to burn their tokens. For instance, Gary Vaynerchuk recently launched Burn Island, a burn-to-redeem program that rewards VeeFriends holders for burning their tokens.\n\nSecurity Measures: Can Someone Else Burn My NFT?\n\nNo one can burn your non-fungible token without your consent.\n\nUnless they have access to your wallet keys, your NFT is safe.\n\nHowever, some smart contracts might incorporate a \u201cburn mechanism,\u201d enabling you to destroy your token.\n\nThis implies that you can design a smart contract to permit burning your non-fungible token or even allow others to do so.\n\nThe Permanence of Burning: Can a Burned, Non-Fungible Token Be Recovered?\n\nThe burning is a permanent process.\n\nOnce you dispatch a unit to an unspendable address, it becomes irretrievable.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s possible to mint a new one with similar properties and attributes, although it won\u2019t be identical to the original one.\n\nThe Aftermath: What Happens to Tokens?\n\nBurning a token doesn\u2019t physically destroy the token. Instead, it sends the NFT to a null address, rendering the token unattainable.\n\nOnce you send your token to a null address, it\u2019s lost to the ether because private keys don\u2019t exist for it.\n\nConclusion\n\nBurning a token might seem counterintuitive at first. However, it\u2019s a strategic tool for managing the value of your tokens and your non-fungible token community.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a creator seeking accountability or a non-fungible token buyer looking to capitalize on increasing values, understanding How to Burn a token can be a game-changer.\n\nOur comprehensive guide equips you to navigate the NFT inferno with confidence.\n\nSo torch those tokens, and let\u2019s see what happens!"

        "content": "Loading... Loading...\n\nBitcoin BTC/USD was trading near flat during Friday's 24-hour trading session, while Ethereum ETH/USD and Dogecoin DOGE/USD were trading in tandem with the apex crypto following jobs data released by the U.S. Labor Department.\n\nNon-farm payrolls showed a gain of 187,000 jobs last month, below the expected 200,000 figure, while the unemployment rate dropped back to 3.5%. The numbers and how they compare to data for August will help the Federal Reserve to decide whether to continue hiking interest rates in September after reinstating its tightening campaign in July.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose at one point on Friday, reacting positively to the data, before bearish pressure came in and dropped the market ETF down under Thursday\u2019s low-of-day. In comparison, the crypto market remained muted, mostly consolidating sideways. The consolidation could continue over the weekend, but if Bitcoin breaks up or down from Wednesday's mother bar, a larger move to the upside or downside could be on the horizon.\n\nIf the general market continues to slide next week, volatility in the stock market is likely to increase.\n\nTraders wishing to trade the potential volatility have multiple options, including the ConvexityShares Daily 1.5x SPIKES Futures ETF SPKY.\n\nSPKY is a 1.5x leveraged fund, which tracks the SPIKES Futures Short-Term Index and measures volatility in broad-based equities in a similar way to the ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures ETF UVXY, which tracks the movement of the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index.\n\nFor every 1% daily movement in the SPIKES Futures Short-Term Index, the SPKY fund seeks to move 1.5%, meaning that it's structured for short-term trades and should not be held for a long period of time.\n\nWant direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial.\n\nThe Bitcoin and Ethereum Charts: Bitcoin and Ethereum have settled into double inside bar patterns on the daily chart, with all of Thursday's and Friday's price action taking place within Wednesday's trading range. Traders can watch for the apex cryptos to eventually break up or down from the mother bar on higher-than-average volume to gauge future direction.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are trading in fairly consistent but shallow downtrends, making a series of lower and lower highs. If big bearish volume eventually enters the cryptos and they continue the downward trajectory, each could eventually test support at the 200-day simple moving average (SMA).\n\nIf the cryptos break up from their respective mother bars, the downtrends are likely to be negated and the cryptos could enter into new uptrends.\n\nBitcoin has resistance above at $30,050 and at $31,418 and support below at $28,690 and at $27,133.\n\nEthereum has resistance above at $1,937 and at $2,020 and support below at $1,825 and at $1,717.\n\nLoading... Loading...\n\nThe Dogecoin Chart: On Wednesday, Dogecoin fell through the bottom horizontal trend line of a descending triangle pattern and lost support at the 200-day SMA, which is bearish. On Thursday, Dogecoin fell lower and on Friday, the crypto was consolidating with an inside bar pattern.\n\nIn Dogecoin\u2019s case, the inside bar leans bearish because the crypto has been trading steeply lower, but like with Bitcoin and Ethereum, traders can watch for a break up or down from Thursday's mother bar on higher-than-average volume to determine future direction,\n\nDogecoin has resistance above at $0.075 and $0.083 and support below at $0.07 and $0.065.\n\nRead Next: Revolut Pulls Plug On Crypto Trading In US, Blames \u2018Changing Regulatory Climate\u2019\n\nPhoto: Unsplash"

        "content": "Matter Labs has denied allegations of source code plagiarism made by Polygon.\n\nPolygon previously accused Matter Labs of copying part of its open-source code without giving due credit.\n\nIn response, Matter Labs claimed it had sufficiently attributed the copied code to Polygon.\n\nMatter Labs, the crypto firm behind zkSync, has responded to the recent plagiarism allegations made by fellow Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution Polygon. Earlier today, Polygon accused Matter Labs\u2019 developers of copying parts of its open-source code without giving due credit for the plagiarized code. Matter Labs has denied the allegations and argued that it had sufficiently attributed the copied part to Polygon.\n\nMatter Labs: Polygon Is Making \u201cUntrue Claims\u201d\n\nEarlier today, Polygon published a blog post titled \u201cProtect the Open Source Ethos\u201d, which accused Matter Labs of copying a \u201csignificant amount\u201d of source code from the Plonky2 library to its recently unveiled proving system called Boojum. According to Polygon, the code was copied with copyrights or attribution to its original authors.\n\nPolygon also called out Matter Labs\u2019 founder Alex Gluchowski for claiming that Boojum is more efficient than Plony2. Polygon questioned the authenticity of Gluchowski\u2019s claim, given that Boojum\u2019s code concerning performance was directly copied from Plonky2. Polygon further cited Boojum\u2019s introductory post, which failed to mention the layer-2 scaling solution or its developers.\n\nIn response to Polygon\u2019s allegations, Matter Labs clarified that its Boojum proof system derived 5% of its code from Plonky2, which was \u201cprominently attributed\u201d in the first line of its library. In a statement to CoinDesk, a Matter Labs spokesperson said that Polygon\u2019s blog post made untrue claims about Boojum\u2019s code.\n\nCEO Alex Gluchowski followed up with a detailed tweet where he expressed his disappointment with Polygon\u2019s allegations. Gluchowski reiterated that only 5% of the Boojum code was based on the Plonky2 code. He added that Boojum and Plonky2 were both implementations of the Redshift, which he claimed was introduced by Matter Labs 3 years before Polygon published the Plonky2 paper.\n\nEvery decision we make as a team towards building @zksync is driven by our ethos, which is based on integrity and transparency. We have made honest mistakes in the past, but we always did our best to openly acknowledge them and take responsibility. And will always do so in the\u2026 https://t.co/4yjpSCHC2d \u2014 Alex G. \u220e (@gluk64) August 4, 2023\n\nIf the Polygon Zero team wanted additional credit, the easiest way would have been to submit a pull request which we would have happily accepted. Going ahead with public accusations of a complete lack of attribution is anything but the spirit of the Open Source movement.\u201d Alex Gluchowski, Co-founder and CEO of Matter Labs\n\nThe tension between Polygon and Matter Labs comes as both firms rush to deliver the first zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) to offer cheaper and more efficient transactions on the Ethereum network. Earlier this year, Polygon\u2019s Mihailo Bjelic and Matter Labs\u2019 Alex Gluchowski were involved in a heated exchange over the latter\u2019s zkSync Era, particularly its security audits."

The exploiter then transferred 4,820 ether over three transactions to Alchemix\u2019s multi-sig wallet. At current prices, the assets are worth $8.9 million.\n\nFriday\u2019s transaction represents a portion of around $61 million drained from decentralized exchange Curve Finance. The attacker reportedly exploited a code bug in Vyper\u2019s compiler, a smart contract programming language used by Curve across its platform.\n\nThe code bug allowed malicious attackers to drain liquidity pools affecting Metronome, Alchemix, and JPEGd. So far, exploiters have returned some of the looted assets to Alchemix and JPEGd.\n\nCurve, Metronome, and Alchemix previously asked the exploiters to return 90% of the drained funds for a 10% bounty in return.

Egorov deposited million of CRV tokens as collateral on DeFi lending protocols like Aave and Fraxlend. These loans risked liquidation if CRV\u2019s price fell below $0.30.\n\nIn response to the CRV\u2019s declining price amid last weekend\u2019s exploit, Egorov spurred a deluge of over-the-counter (OTC) deals with some 13 investors including Tron founder Justin Sun.\n\nEgorov\u2019s CRV sales from OTC trades total 106 million CRV tokens and he received $42 million USDT in return. This liquidity has seemingly gone into balancing debts on Aave and other lenders amid concerns of a DeFi implosion.\n\nDeFi analyst Ignas opined that a CRV nosedive looked unlikely due to an increase in Curve\u2019s 3Crypto pool featuring crvUSD+ETH+CRV."

        "content": "Great investments bear more fruits when investors chip in early. When investing in financial markets, timing is critical to making significant gains. This is why investors look for incoming ICO projects that are yet to hit mainstream adoption and massive popularity. Although Ethereum has been around for some time, and great potential for the network\u2019s digital asset ETH to surge exists, upcoming ICO projects like Bitcoin Spark have more potential to reward investors.\n\nThe Rise Of Bitcoin Cash\n\nBitcoin Cash is classified among the crypto assets that offer an alternative platform to the Bitcoin network, hence the name Bitcoin Alternatives. The project was developed as a significant Bitcoin hard fork upgrade in 2017 to address the challenges and limitations of the first-generation blockchain. Unlike Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash can host a larger volume of transactions in an isolated block while reducing transaction fees concurrently.\n\nIs Ethereum a good investment?\n\nEthereum has progressed immensely since its inauguration. The platform pioneered smart contracts, a technology that has reshaped the decentralized finance industry by deploying decentralized applications. The network capitalizes on the proof of stake consensus mechanism to promote decentralization and growth of the ecosystem.\n\nBitcoin Spark is a Once in a Lifetime opportunity\n\nFinding crypto gems that have the potential to give massive returns on investment is relatively tricky. Bitcoin Spark is the top Bitcoin hard fork ICO that has great utility. The project intends to solve the shortcomings associated with Bitcoin network functionalities. These challenges include high transaction fees, slow transactions, and centralization in the mining process.\n\nBitcoin mining is quite profitable. However, it has a massive entry barrier involving sophisticated mining equipment, large volumes of electricity, and high expenses. Bitcoin Spark utilizes the proof of process consensus mechanism that blends Proof of Work and Proof of Stake methodologies. This means that the network has both miners and validators. Bitcoin Spark\u2019s mining is not as complicated as that of Bitcoin. Bitcoin Spark\u2019s team is working on software mining applications to support mining BTCS tokens on handheld electronic devices such as mobile phones, laptops, and tablets.\n\nThe project is on the verge of beginning its presale. Bitcoin Spark\u2018s ICO phase 1 is scheduled to start on 1st August 2023, where investors will purchase BTCS tokens at a discounted price of $1.50. These early adopters will also get a 20% bonus on purchases from 1st August to 11th August.\n\nBitcoin Spark is also unique because participants will earn passive income, unlike the case of Bitcoin and Ethereum, where investors rely solemnly on staking/mining and capital gains. The Bitcoin Spark team is setting up two revenue streams. First, participants will be lent processing power to individuals or companies. This processing power is vital in virtual high-end activities such as video rendering. Miners will earn 97% from this income stream, while the remaining 3% will be allocated to the development team.\n\nSecondly, the platform\u2019s website and mobile applications will have an advertisement slot governed by community members. Advertisers will pay for the service in BTCS tokens. 50% of the income generated from this stream will be directed to the team behind the project\u2019s development. The remaining 50% will be distributed to the network\u2019s participants.\n\nFor more information:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "This year, Ethereum (ETH) has been notably underperforming in comparison to Bitcoin (BTC), with its year-to-date gains lagging roughly 20% behind the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nNonetheless, a potential shift in circumstances offers a glimmer of hope. As market dynamics evolve and new developments emerge, Ethereum\u2019s trajectory may be poised for a transformation, according to crypto market experts.\n\nIn fact, ETH is a \u2018ticking bomb,\u2019 Glassnode co-founder known as Negentropic said on Twitter on August 3. The crypto guru acknowledged short-term risks for Ethereum; however, in the medium term, he sees the cryptocurrency as a golden opportunity.\n\nTime to shift from BTC to altcoins\n\nAccording to Negentropic, the ETH/BTC chart signals that better days may be coming for alternative assets, advising traders to make the shift.\n\n\u201cAccording to the ETHBTC trading pair, it\u2019s time to shift from BTC to altcoins.\u201d \u2013 Negentropic wrote.\n\nWhile Bitcoin may show strength in the short run, the expert explained, Ethereum is \u201cgearing up for a spectacular run!\u201d\n\nHis analysis of the ETH/BTC shows that the pair has been inking a series of lower highs since, and currently stands close to a 1-year low. This could serve as a potential reversal signal for Ethereum, and a possible breakout may be on the horizon.\n\nETHBTC chart. Source: Negentropic\n\nThe Ethereum to Bitcoin pair, often denoted as ETH/BTC, represents the exchange rate between ETH and BTC. In other words, it shows how many units of Bitcoin are needed to buy one unit of Ethereum.\n\nWhen ETH/BTC is trading low, it means that Ethereum\u2019s value is relatively weaker compared to Bitcoin, and it takes fewer units of Bitcoin to acquire one unit of Ethereum. This situation might indicate that Ethereum is underperforming or facing weaker demand compared to Bitcoin in the market.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nAt the time of publication on August 4, ETH was changing hands at $1,835, up 0.36% in the past 24 hours.\n\nOn a weekly chart, the crypto token is down more than 1.3% and over 5% on the month, similar to Bitcoin\u2019s 30-day drop.\n\nETH 1-month price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nYear-to-date, Ethereum gained around 53%, while BTC surged 75%.\n\nAnother metric that may suggest a resurgence in ETH is the recent growth in the blockchain network. Notably, the number of Ethereum addresses soared to 450,000 at the end of July, hitting the highest level in 2 years.\n\nThe blockchain witnessed 80,000 new address additions at the end of last month, according to Santiment data.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Could See 50% Drop Against Bitcoin: Crypto Analyst Benjamin Cowen's Forecast - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "Prominent crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen has recently suggested that a single event could trigger a significant drop in Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) value relative to Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nAccording to a report by The Daily Hodl published earlier today, in a recent discussion with Crypto Banter host Ran Neuner, Cowen speculated that the ETH/BTC pair could experience a drop of over 50% from its current value of 0.063 BTC, equivalent to $1,828.\n\nCowen\u2019s prediction is based on his observation that the ETH/BTC pair appears to form a bearish double-top pattern on the monthly chart. This pattern suggests that investors will likely trade their ETH for BTC during any rally. Cowen described the current situation as a \u201cmassive distribution phase,\u201d similar to patterns observed in previous cycles.\n\nCowen notes that historically the ETH/BTC pair has shown a tendency to decline from June through December. Cowen anticipates a potential drop to as low as 0.03 BTC ($871):\n\n\u201cSo what I would think is going to happen is that Ether/Bitcoin could plummet to around that 0.03 (BTC) to 0.04 (BTC) level and once the Ethereum/Bitcoin valuation gets there, I think that it could mark the end of the altcoin reckoning.\u201c\n\nAccording to Cowen, the catalyst for this significant ETH/BTC decline could be a retracement in the stock market. He drew parallels with the late 2017 scenario when the ETH/BTC pair dropped to .022 BTC. A second drop to this level in 2018 marked the end of many altcoins\u2019 reckoning. Cowen suggests that a similar pattern could be unfolding now, with a secondary drop to the level of 0.049 BTC potentially on the horizon.\n\nHowever, Cowen also cautioned that even after reaching this level, the ETH/BTC pair could experience further drops before finding a bottom. He believes that a potential seasonal correction in the S&P 500 could be the trigger for this scenario.\n\nFeatured Image Credit: Photo / illustration by vjkombajn via Pixabay"

        "content": "Base, the Ethereum L2 (layer 2) scaling layer backed by Coinbase, has revealed an important milestone in its mission to bring more users and builders onchain. Also, Base declared that it has opened bridging for selected Ethereum assets and will launch its mainnet on August 9, offering unrestricted access for developers to deploy their applications on the platform.\n\nThis launch will include bridging of Ethereum, Coinbase staked Ethereum, dai, and USDC to Base, with withdrawals of the same assets to Ethereum also enabled. While initially limited to these options, there are indications that more may be added in the future. Since opening the Ethereum bridge, Base\u2019s total value locked (TVL) reached its peak value, registering more than $92 million.\n\nAccording to L2beat, a protocol aggregator, Base ranks within the top ten scaling solutions based on value locked. The recent initiation of Ethereum bridging escalated Base to its apex value, documenting over $92 million in total value locked (TVL). An intriguing spike in TVL was observed with the issue of the meme token bald on June 30. The token\u2019s valuation skyrocketed by 40,000% within a mere 48 hours, although it did retrace to its inception levels soon after.\n\n\u2018Onchain Summer\u2019 and grants for builders\n\nCommemorating the momentous occasion of its L2 chain launch, Base is championing \u201cOnchain Summer.\u201d As detailed by Base, this initiative is a month-long onchain festival orchestrated by a diverse ensemble of 50 illustrious builders, brands, products, artists, and creators. The festivity aims to offer many on-chain activities spotlighting art, music, gaming, advocacy, and more. The entire roster of collaborators for this event remains under wraps, slated for revelation on August 9. However, teasers include notable names such as Coca-Cola, Atari, Opensea, Pixelmon, and Optimism.\n\nTo catalyze innovation on its platform, Base is earmarking 100 ETH to disburse as grants to prospective builders and creators. These grants are being facilitated in collaboration with Prop House, a pioneering infrastructure platform capacitating capital allocation to creators. The grants are tailored to stimulate a spectrum of Base-related endeavors, from creating art and advanced applications to spearheading crypto advocacy and championing sensible legislation.\n\nThe upcoming Base initiatives, including the \u2018Onchain Summer\u2019 and grants for developers, mark a pivotal chapter in the L2 solution\u2019s journey. With its mainnet launch imminent, Base is poised to become a formidable player in the Ethereum ecosystem, ushering in a new era of onchain innovation."

        "content": "On Twitter, a bizarre story is circulating about an Ethereum developer who allegedly \u201caccidentally\u201d blocked 5 ETH (the equivalent of $9,000 at the time of writing) for 100 years in order to create his first TEST token. However, according to some, the story is being made public just to attract attention.\n\nEthereum: a developer accidentally blocks 5 ETH for 100 years\n\nTwitter is buzzing about the bizarre story of the Ethereum developer who allegedly accidentally blocked 5 ETH (or $9,000) for 100 years while working on the creation of his new TEST token.\n\nOn the 4chan forum, in fact, the developer allegedly created a post asking for help in creating his first ERC-20 token and blocking it. From there, then, the actual creation of TEST on the Ethereum mainnet took place.\n\nSoon after, a user would have suggested that the developer use UNCX Network, a protocol for blocking liquidity tokens.\n\nAnd so the developer allegedly decided to add 5 ETH and 1 billion TEST tokens as liquidity on Uniswap\u2019s DEX, receiving 70,700 LP tokens in return. These LP tokens can be redeemed for the underlying liquidity.\n\nAfter that, following the suggestion, the Ethereum developer would have locked his LP tokens, using the UNCX Network protocol, but putting 31 December 2123 as the expiration date.\n\nThis means that for 100 years, the tokens are no longer accessible and cannot be used to redeem the original ETH or the locked TEST tokens on Uniswap.\n\nEthereum: the story of the developer locking 5 ETH for 100 years crafted to attract attention\n\nAfter revealing that he had locked $9,000 in ETH for 100 years by posting related links, other 4chan forum users pointed out that the TEST token was growing.\n\nAnd indeed, TEST soared initially to $0.006, reaching a market cap of $6 million.\n\nSoon after, its price dropped to as low as $0.0014 with a market cap of $1.5 million.\n\nHowever, not all users are convinced of the \u201caccidental mistake\u201d of the developer of TEST. On the contrary, some reportedly questioned the whole affair, claiming that it was a move to attract attention.\n\nFirst among them, on 4chan, is a user who commented \u201cThis is not testnet ser,\u201d probably based on the idea that funds have been locked for too long. Then came the tweets that continued to spread skepticism about the story.\n\nThe price of ETH and its predictions\n\nThe spread of these stories among Ethereum developers, contribute in some way to talk about the smart contract crypto par excellence.\n\nAnd so, taking a look at the price of ETH, the monthly chart, shows that there is a slight bear market of the second largest crypto by market capitalization.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH is worth $1830. Far from the $2,022 touched on 14 July. Despite this slight drop in price, there are those who argue that for this second part of 2023, the situation will be different.\n\nIn fact, Finder recently published its prediction on the price of Ethereum, revealing that in 2023, ETH is expected to peak at $2,700, and then end the year around $2,400."

        "content": "Asset management firm Valkyrie has moved to convert its Bitcoin Strategy exchange-traded fund (BTF) into a Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF.\n\nAccording to the firm\u2019s website, BTF is an actively managed exchange-traded fund (ETF) available through Nasdaq. BTF, which primarily invests in BTF futures contracts, represents one of Valkyrie\u2019s first endeavors in the Bitcoin derivative product markets.\n\nValkyrie Files 497 For Bitcoin, Ether Futures ETF: Bloomberg Analyst\n\nInvestopedia defines form 497 as a regulatory document that allows investment companies and mutual funds to submit their definitive materials in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC\u2019s) EDGAR (electronic data gathering, analysis, and retrieval) filing system.\n\nOn Friday, August 4, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas disclosed on X (formerly Twitter) that Valkyrie filed a form 497 to convert its BTF to a Bitcoin and Ether Futures ETF on October 3, 2023. This means that BTF \u2013 which was initially a Bitcoin Futures ETF only \u2013 would also include an Ether Futures ETF.\n\nBalchunas tagged the Valkyrie submission as the 14th Ether ETF application so far. He also noted that Valkyrie may be trying to outleap competition, as the firm\u2019s proposed date \u2013 October 3rd \u2013 is two weeks ahead of other applicants\u2019 scheduled launch.\n\nFurthermore, Balchunas likened this application to that of the first pot ETF, MJ, in 2017. At the time, ETF Managers Group (ETFMG) combined a new marijuana ETF with an existing ETF, the Tierra XP Latin America Real Estate ETF (LARE).\n\nAnother Bloomberg intelligence analyst James Seyffart called it a \u201cmassive\u201d move while admitting that it is still unclear how the ETF would work.\n\nIf approved, this would come as another advancement for Valkyrie, especially after the recent positives recorded on its spot Bitcoin ETF application.\n\nIn July, Bitcoinist reported that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission listed the asset management company in the Federal Register as an applicant for a spot Bitcoin ETF alongside seven other firms.\n\nValkyrie Joins 13 Other Ethereum ETF Filings For SEC Approval\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Valkyrie\u2019s latest filing represents the 14th Ether Futures ETF application. More than a dozen applications from major players, like ProShares, VanEck, Grayscale, and Bitwise, have already been submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nProShares specifically has exhibited great interest in the Ethereum Futures ETF, with four filings awaiting the SEC\u2019s approval. Notably, the company filed for an equal weight Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF in its 4th application.\n\nWhile there has been rising interest in Ethereum Futures ETF lately, many crypto analysts are not seeming too optimistic about its chances of being approved by the SEC.\n\n\u201cMy base case is that these are withdrawn by the end of next week. These firms probably had these on the shelf ready to go and just needed to re-submit them,\u201d James Seyffart mentioned in one of his posts.\n\nHowever, he also speculated that the applicants may have received some sort of signal from the SEC, as he believed most firms won\u2019t bother applying if they knew their chances were \u201czero or near zero\u201d.\n\nETHUSDT trading at $1,831.44 | Source: daily ETHUSDT chart from TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Bernard Marr, chart from TradingView"

        "content": "Newly released documents show Joseph Lubin brought William Hinam and Vitalik Buterin together before the SEC director\u2019s speech in 2018.\n\nOutrage sparked within the XRP community with some stating that the Hinman speech was actually \u201cThe Ether Speech\u201d.\n\nIn the latest controversial revelation, oversight watchdog group Empower Oversight released a new batch of documents for a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. The documents highlight the deeper involvement of Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin and his blockchain firm ConsenSys in the crypto speech by former SEC Director of Corporation Finance, William Hinman, on June 14, 2018.\n\nThis speech has been a source of disagreement in the Ripple case, particularly because the SEC has stated that other cryptocurrencies, like XRP, were also considered unregistered securities. Ripple attorneys stressed much on the Hinman speech of 2018 during its fight with the SEC, as it noted that assets like Ethereum aren\u2019t securities. However, the latest details of Lubin\u2019s involvement have sparked major outrage in the XRP community.\n\nThe documents released by the watchdog group reveal that \u201cLubin also appears to have been responsible for bringing Hinman and Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin together as the speech drafting advanced\u201d. Moreover, investors and lawyers closely linked to Ethereum were notably present at a meeting on March 28, 2018, regarding a proposal for a crypto safe harbor.\n\n4. Lubin also apparently brought Hinman and Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin together as the speech was drafted.https://t.co/e1l1q4posg \u2014 Empower Oversight (@EMPOWR_us) August 3, 2023\n\nThe documents also show that Hinman had a meeting with Chris Lin, a partner at Simpson Thacher, which goes against advice on conflicts of interest rules. The SEC Ethics Office had warned Hinman multiple times because he was receiving millions of dollars from Simpson Thacher while working at the SEC.\n\nEmpower Oversight has been leading the fight for more transparency at the SEC. They have filed many requests and lawsuits under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to make the SEC release documents related to their decisions about cryptocurrency matters.\n\nOutraged XRP Community Reacts\n\nThe news has sparked reactions among XRP supporters. In a tweet yesterday, Crypto-Law.US pointed out that the newly disclosed emails show how Lubin influenced Hinman\u2019s decision to title his speech \u201cThe Ether Speech.\u201d\n\nJUST ADDED to our Document Library:\n\n\u2705The Hinman-Lubin Emails, detailing how @ethereumJoseph and @Consensys initiated contact with Hinman & his staff, and drove Hinman's thinking on what he would later call \"the Ether speech\" \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/DJRcWUZb41 \u2014 CryptoLaw (@CryptoLawUS) August 3, 2023\n\nAs a response, Attorney John Deaton, the founder of Crypto-Law.US, shared how Hinman lied during his deposition in the Ripple lawsuit. Hinman had claimed that he never discussed the content of his speech with anyone outside the SEC before June 14. However, the Hinman documents revealed that he had a meeting with Buterin a week before his speech on cryptocurrencies.\n\nFred Rispoli, a lawyer at HODLaw, praised the efforts of Empower Oversight, tweeting, \u201cGreat job Empower Oversight. SEC never expected these documents to be made public\u2026\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Digital Asset Investor.XRP also questioned the double standards noting: \u201cWhy was Bill Hinman doing backflips to accommodate Joseph Lubin and Vitalik Buterin while at the same time giving Brad Garlinghouse the run-around with the help of Jay Clayton and even coming back to the SEC after he left to make sure the Ripple lawsuit went through?\u201d\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.
