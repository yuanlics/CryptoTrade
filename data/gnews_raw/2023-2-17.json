        "title": "Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, explained - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "What is the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade? The Ethereum blockchain went through an upgrade termed \u201cthe Merge\u201d in September 2022 that changed the consensus mechanism of the chain. Another upgrade to the chain termed the \u201cShanghai\u201d is expected around mid-March and may have economic implications across the board. The Ethereum Shanghai upgrade is also called the \u201cEthereum Shanghai fork.\u201d As part of this upgrade, there are five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that are expected to be rolled out. EIP-4895 is perhaps going to be the one grabbing all the headlines, as it will unlock staked Ether (ETH) and allow withdrawals. Through the Merge that happened in September 2022, the consensus mechanism of the blockchain moved from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). In doing so, the governance of the chain moved away from a resource-intensive mechanism and became more environmentally, socially and governance (ESG) friendly. While PoS might be more environmentally friendly, it relies on a staking process. ETH holders had to stake at least 32 ETH to participate in the consensus mechanism. They earn a staking yield that is currently just over 5%. As 32 ETH is around $52,000 at present, it is unfeasible for smaller investors to participate. However, platforms such as Lido and Coinbase offer staking facilities to users even for smaller Ether holdings and charge them a fee on their staking income. The staked Ether has been locked for about two years or since the staking market emerged. The Ethereum Shanghai upgrade allows users to withdraw their staked Ethereum. As a result, the Ethereum community is eagerly waiting to unlock their Ethereum post-upgrade.\n\nWhat does the Shanghai fork mean for Ethereum stakeholders? The Ethereum blockchain went live on July 30, 2015, and only had the Bitcoin blockchain to draw inspiration from. As a result, it still suffers from several suboptimal features from which subsequent blockchains have learned and implemented better. Can the upgrade help with addressing these pain points? Historically, Ethereum has suffered from slow transactions and high transaction fees. This has especially been noticeable since the decentralized finance (DeFi) boom increased the transaction value locked (TVL) on the chain. The rise of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and the craze to mint NFTs through 2021 and early 2022 has added to bad user experiences and high gas fees. Apart from EIP-4895, which is largely focused on Ethereum stakers, EIP-3855 and EIP-3860 are expected to be shipped as part of the upgrade. EIP-3855 should help with transaction speeds, and EIP-3860 hopes to reduce transaction costs. These improvements should help improve network usage across DeFi and NFTs, as some of these ecosystems were affected by high gas fees and slow transactions. Projects had moved to other chains, such as Solana or Ethereum layer-2 scaling solutions like Polygon, due to these issues. These projects and newer ones consider Ethereum more favorably with these upgrades. More flexible staking, better performance and a rise in ecosystem stakeholders could amplify the resulting network effect and help the chain in the long run.\n\nHow will the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade affect ETH traders? Most blockchain upgrades have an impact on price action. The Ethereum Shanghai upgrade would be no different. Ether supplies on exchanges have already started to plunge as investors choose to move their assets to self-custody. The previous Ethereum upgrade created good volatility in the market, which traders tapped into. ETH prices skyrocketed from around $1,000 in July 2022 to over $2,000 in August and reached about $1,800 just around the time of the Merge. With exchange supplies of Ether plummeting fast, traders may see yet another spike in price leading to the Shanghai upgrade. However, short-term traders might want to note the fall in Ether\u2019s price since the Merge was pushed in 2022. This upgrade may not be too different. The other factor to keep in mind is that Ethereum users who haven\u2019t been able to withdraw their staked Ether for over two years will have access to do so right after the Shanghai upgrade. With over 16.4 million ETH staked, if some of that hits the market, it could increase the supply of Ether and bring prices down right after the Shanghai upgrade is complete. This relationship between supply and demand is a fundamental principle of economics and is a key factor in determining the price of any asset, including cryptocurrencies, stocks, bonds and commodities. It\u2019s also worth noting that, although downside risks for price action exist after the Shanghai update due to staking withdrawals, ETH withdrawals will only be available in small chunks. For instance, traders who want to withdraw their Ether after the upgrade will only be able to do so in stages over time. This might mitigate downside risks to Ether prices. But the fear of increased supply is something that could hurt market sentiment in the short term.\n\nHow will the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade affect ETH users? Ethereum has long suffered from poor user experiences due to transaction inefficiencies and high costs. Some of these user experiences should improve with the Shanghai upgrade. As several Ethereum use cases have emerged since the 2018 bear market, the TVLs and usage of the chain have increased exponentially, resulting in network effects. The chain wasn\u2019t engineered for this explosive growth and has struggled with high gas fees and slow transactions. As a result, Ethereum has often been tagged as the \u201crich people\u2019s chain.\u201d The minting of Yuga labs\u2019 \u201cThe Otherside\u201d was one such event when gas fees as high as 2.5 ETH were paid to get the NFTs. Such expensive affairs are non-existent in next-generation blockchains, such as Solana, where the user experience and low transaction fees have helped draw a large user base. Ethereum could be the chain of choice for all users if it solved the gas fee issue. Many gaming projects had moved off of Ethereum onto Solana, Polygon and Immutable X, as gaming had to support micro-transactions. Ethereum must become more efficient, fast and scalable to attract these kinds of projects. Sharding is one feature that Ethereum has in its pipeline, which is similar to parallel processing in traditional computing terms. The Shanghai upgrade is a stepping stone toward achieving sharding later in 2023. As transaction speeds increase and costs lower in due course, Ethereum will have more exciting applications for its user base and will be able to accommodate more than just wealthy users.\n\nWhat does the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade mean for investors? Investors generally tend to take a longer-term view of an asset than traders. As a result, they focus more on fundamentals than short-term price action and technical indicators. On that note, the Shanghai upgrade improves the fundamentals of the chain and should be viewed favorably by investors. Ethereum has the ability to lead the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. The Merge was the first step in that direction, as checking the ESG box could bring in more institutional capital onto Ethereum and, eventually, into the broader crypto ecosystem. Also, the ability for institutional investors to participate in staking and earn a yield resembles fixed financial instruments \u2014 e.g., bonds \u2014 in capital markets. As Ether becomes the blue-chip asset of the cryptocurrency market, the staking yields from Ether could be synonymous with the risk-free rate that traditional capital markets often use to price their assets. As a result, staking rewards from other chains and DeFi applications native to Ethereum must at least match \u2014 but, ideally, exceed \u2014 Ethereum staking yields. Therefore, the Ethereum upgrade is likely going to have economic model implications as other chains and applications design their product and service offerings. With the fundamentals of Ethereum improving through the Merge, the Shanghai upgrade and the introduction of sharding in 2023, retail and institutional investors will want to be part of the Ethereum ecosystem growth story."

        "content": "While the crypto market is still in an uptrend despite the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) increase in regulatory actions, projects have been seen taking advantage of the so-called \u2018mini bull run\u2019 with new launches. NFT marketplace Blur is one of them.\n\nOn Valentine\u2019s day, February 14, Blur airdropped its native token under the ticker BLUR. The digital asset was launched on the Ethereum blockchain to users who have actively traded NFTs on the marketplace over the past six months.\n\nFollowing the project\u2019s token airdrop, network activity on the Ethereum blockchain has soared, spiking the network\u2019s gas prices and the amount of ETH burned in a day. This network\u2019s spike in activity can be linked to Blur users claiming their respective airdropped tokens and to the transactions on the marketplace.\n\nBLUR Token Surges Ethereum Network Activity\n\nAccording to data from Ultra Sound Money, a total amount of 2,469 ETH worth roughly $4 million has been burned in the last seven days, removing a portion of ETH from circulation permanently, which has had a positive effect on ETH\u2019s price.\n\nOver the past weeks, Ethereum network activity has been trending to the upside, mirroring ETH\u2019s surge in price. Two weeks ago, NewsBTC reported that the amount of Ethereum burned recorded a new high exceeding the 3,000 ETH mark.\n\nThis metric seems relatively low to the ETH burned due to the BLUR token airdrop, which hasn\u2019t been the only new high Ethereum has recorded in the past month. In January, the Ethereum staked on the Beacon chain, the proof-of-stake blockchain, reached an all-time high of over 16.16 million ETH, which holds more than 13.28% of the total ETH supply.\n\nEntering The Spotlight\n\nWhile the token has boosted Ethereum\u2019s activity, the marketplace is beginning to seize the spotlight with massive recognition. According to the data provider, Dune analytics, the Blur NFT marketplace has gained traction, obtaining a larger share of the NFT market ecosystem.\n\nBlur controlled 64.6% of NFT market trading volume in the past week as opposed to OpenSea\u2019s 24.4% and X2Y2\u2019s relatively low trading volume of 5.1%. Though OpenSea has the most recognition, Blur\u2019s recent airdrop has increased its popularity.\n\nBlur is an NFT marketplace and market aggregator that offers services such as advanced analytics, excellent portfolio management capabilities, and the ability to compare NFTs on multiple marketplaces.\n\nUnlike Opensea\u2019s royalty fee, Blur takes a distinct approach of enforcing royalty fees only when requested by creators. The platform currently does not enforce full royalties. Instead, it enables the enforcement of only a 0.5% minimum creator royalty, allowing users to pay more when purchasing an NFT item on the marketplace.\n\nWhile the marketplace has begun to gain needed traction, its native token BLUR hasn\u2019t been left out of the equation. Amid the increase in activity, BLUR went as high as $5 before suffering a massive retracement bringing its price to as low as $0.90.\n\nOver the past three days, BLUR has plummeted by over 80% and trades below $1 for $0.93. BLUR still ranks #131 on CoinGecko with a market cap above $350 million.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Since September 2022, traders have started withdrawing ETH from exchanges.\n\nSince the completion of the Merge network upgrade six months ago, the quantity of ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market value, has been steadily decreasing across exchanges. In September 2022, the Ethereum network went through a significant upgrade that consisted of switching from a proof-of-work (PoW) network to a proof-of-stake (PoS) network during an event that was referred to as the Merge.\n\nThe quantity of accessible ETH that is now languishing on exchanges continues to decrease, as shown by on-chain data that was published by the cryptocurrency analytics company Santiment. Since the Merge, the amount of ETH available on exchanges has decreased by 37%. It is a positive indicator when there is a consistent decrease in supply on exchanges. This is because there is less ETH accessible on the market for buying and selling.\n\nBefore the Merge, there were a total of 19.12 million ETH worth $31.3 billion trading hands on exchanges in the month of September. As of the second week of February, the number had dropped to 13.36 million ETH, which corresponds to a value of $19.7 billion.\n\nA significant portion of the Ethereum supply is now being shifted into self-custody, while the Shanghai upgrade is drawing near and many traders choose staking as an investment strategy instead. The next version for Ethereum, known as Shanghai, is expected to release in the month of March. Stakeholders and validators will be able to remove their holdings from the Beacon Chain after the Shanghai hard fork, which will combine more upgrade suggestions for network advancements and enable for this functionality.\n\nAt the now, 14% of the entire supply, or 16 million ETH, is staked on the Beacon Chain. This amounts to nearly $25 billion at the prices that are currently in effect, and it is a significant quantity that will gradually become liquid following the Shanghai hard fork.\n\nSince it became deflationary after the London upgrade, the total quantity of ETH on the market as a whole has also decreased, in addition to the ongoing decrease in the amount of ETH stored on exchanges. The fee-burning mechanism that was first implemented as part of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-1559 is where the deflationary model can be found.\n\nSince the London upgrade in August 2021, a total of 2.9 million ETH has been burnt, which would have had an equivalent value of around $4.5 billion in today's currency."

        "title": "What Are Consensus Mechanisms in Blockchain and Cryptocurrency? - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is a Consensus Mechanism?\n\nA consensus mechanism is a program used in blockchain systems to achieve distributed agreement about the ledger's state. Generally, it is implemented in a network with many processes and users. Cryptocurrencies, blockchains, and distributed ledgers benefit from their use because the consensus mechanism replaces much slower human verifiers and auditing.\n\nFor instance, the Bitcoin blockchain uses a mechanism called Proof-of-Work (PoW), which requires computational power to solve an encrypted puzzle, called the hash. After the hash is solved by one miner (or a group working together), Bitcoin's PoW requires that every node on the network verifies the data that has been changed by checking:\n\nThe data structure\n\nThe block header hash\n\nThe block timestamp\n\nThe block size\n\nThe first transaction\n\nIt then completes a long transaction verification checklist. This verification takes much less time than the process of solving the hash, which is called mining, and is orders of magnitude less time-consuming than human verification.\n\nKey Takeaways A consensus mechanism is any method used to achieve agreement, trust, and security across a decentralized computer network.\n\nIn the context of blockchains and cryptocurrencies, proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) are two of the most prevalent consensus mechanisms.\n\nConsensus mechanisms play an essential part of securing information by encrypting it and using automated group verification.\n\nHistory of Consensus Mechanisms\n\nWhen computers and networks began gaining popularity in the 1980s and 90s, shared databases were created so that multiple users could access the information they stored. Most had a centralized database with permissions that users accessed from different stations. This setup evolved into centralized networks with administrators who granted user rights and maintained the integrity of the data.\n\nThese shared databases became known as distributed ledgers because they recorded information and were networked for many users in different locations to access. One of the most significant issues that needed addressing was that of preventing data tampering and unauthorized access, whether it was malicious or not. A method to automate distributed database management was required to ensure data was not changed.\n\nThis need led to the creation of distributed autonomous consensus, where programs on a network agreed on a database's state using cryptographic techniques. Agreement was designed to be reached using encryption algorithms to create long strings of alphanumeric numbers\u2014called a hash\u2014which were then verified by programs running on the network. A hash only changes if the information input into the hashing algorithm is changed, so the programs were designed to compare hashes to ensure they matched.\n\nWhen each program running on the network created a matching alphanumeric string, the data was said to be agreed upon by consensus of the network. Thus, consensus mechanisms were made, with credit generally given to Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous Bitcoin creator. However, many people worked on consensus mechanisms for years before Nakamoto released the whitepaper that made Bitcoin famous.\n\nData and computer scientists such as Moni Naor, Cynthia Dwork, Adam Beck, Nick Szabo, and many others worked on and contributed to developing networked consensus mechanisms.\n\nTypes of Consensus Mechanisms\n\nThere are different kinds of consensus mechanism algorithms, each of which works on different principles.\n\nThe proof of work (PoW) is a common consensus algorithm used by the most popular cryptocurrency networks like Bitcoin and Litecoin. It requires a participant node to prove that the work done and submitted by them qualifies them to receive the right to add new transactions to the blockchain. However, the bitcoin mining mechanism requires high energy consumption and long processing times.\n\nThe proof of stake (PoS) is another common consensus algorithm that evolved as a low-cost, low-energy consuming alternative to the PoW algorithm. It involves allocating responsibility in maintaining the public ledger to a participant node in proportion to the number of virtual currency tokens held. However, this has the drawback that it incentivizes hoarding instead of spending.\n\nProof of History (PoH) was developed by the Solana Project. It is similar to Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET), which encodes the passage of time itself cryptographically to achieve consensus without expending many resources.\n\nWhile PoW and PoS are by far the most prevalent in the blockchain space, there are other consensus algorithms like Proof of Capacity (PoC) which allow sharing of memory space of the contributing nodes on the blockchain network. The more memory or hard disk space a node has, the more rights it is granted for maintaining the public ledger. Proof of Activity (PoA), used on the Decred blockchain, is a hybrid that makes use of aspects of both PoW and PoS. Proof of Burn (PoB) requires transactors to send small amounts of cryptocurrency to inaccessible wallet addresses, in effect \"burning\" them out of existence.\n\nFuture of Consensus Mechanisms\n\nWhile used by all cryptocurrencies, consensus mechanisms are just as important in distributed ledger networks used by enterprises. Platforms have been created for business and government use, allowing each entity to choose from modules created for their needs, backed by consensus mechanisms. Hyperledger Fabric, one of the more well-known distributed ledger platforms, provides different consensus mechanisms. For example, one entity might not need proof-of-work, considered byzantine fault tolerant, whereas another might not need that level of consensus.\n\nCryptocurrency's future may be unknown and volatile, but consensus mechanisms remain an essential part of emerging technology. They ensure data safety and integrity and keep those with nefarious intentions locked out of distributed ledgers.\n\nWhich Consensus Mechanism Is Best? The best consensus mechanism is one that fits the needs of the users. Proof of work is thought to be best for Bitcoin, while proof of stake was adopted by Ethereum and is believed to be best by its community. Other mechanisms might work better for enterprises, businesses, or personal uses.\n\nWhat Is an Example of a Consensus Mechanism? Proof of stake is one example. In this mechanism, users \"stake\" their tokens to be given the privilege of conducting work on the blockchain for rewards like transaction fees.\n\nWhat Are the Types of Consensus Mechanisms? Several have been created, but only a few have been implemented. Some types besides proof of work and proof of stake are delegated proof of stake, proof of importance, proof of elapsed time, proof of authority, and proof of capacity. Each uses different concepts to validate data changes.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nConsensus mechanisms have become an essential aspect of distributed ledgers, databases, and blockchains because much of the world is becoming more digital. Ownership of physical assets is being tokenized on ledgers and blockchains, people without access to financial services have access through blockchains, and businesses need data security more than ever.\n\nConsensus mechanisms verify data inputs and outputs, which translates to automatically auditing the digital transactions that are common today\u2014without human oversight or intervention. They create an environment where you don't need to trust that the other party in a transaction is honest because they ensure the information is unalterable and secure.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (\u201cICOs\u201d) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

        "content": "The VOLT token is rapidly gaining popularity and has already achieved remarkable success on both Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

Now, with a new expansion on the horizon, the cryptocurrency is set to make waves again. Volt Inu (VOLT) has recently announced its decision to launch on Polygon, a move that could transform the platform and bring about new possibilities for users and investors alike.\n\nVOLT Inu ($VOLT) is making a splash in the crypto community thanks to two key elements: true deflationary techniques and additional revenue generation. VOLT was initially launched on the Ethereum blockchain. Shortly, it was also launched on the Binance Smart Chain \u201cBSC\u201d, adding more exposure and enabling people who don\u2019t want to pay hefty ETH fees to get involved. This brought overwhelming success; there are twice as many VOLT holders on the BSC than on Ethereum!\n\nFollowing user demand, the team has decided to list VOLT on Polygon. 25% of VOLT\u2019s liquidity will be shifted to Polygon. For users, this will introduce a new alternative for holding VOLT in a decentralized manner with minimal gas fees while targeting a new user base. Polygon is a popular layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that offers fast, cheap, and efficient transactions. Its significance in the crypto space lies in its ability to address Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues and improve user experience, making it a promising solution for developers and users.\n\nBridge liquidity burn\n\nIn 2022, attacks and hacks have targeted cross-chain bridges exploiting billions of dollars worth of tokens. Seeing this as a threat, VOLT decided to reduce the liquidity (amount of tokens) locked in their bridge contract to reduce its impact. Not only does this secures the ecosystem, but it also increases the deflationary mechanism by VOLT\u2019s burn addresses.\n\nA total of 44.85 trillion VOLT tokens (worth $74.5M) will be burnt over five days.\n\nThe first burn amounting to $14.9M was completed on Feb 13th. In the third burn, 8.97 trillion VOLT tokens (worth $14.9M) were burned.\n\nIn the 4th burn that concluded today (Feb 17th), another 8.97T #VOLT tokens (worth $14.9M) have been burned.\n\nMoreover, 89 projects added the voltichange widget in their first month, thus making each of them deflationary and also increasing the VOLT burn rate.\n\n89 projects added the #VOLTICHANGE widget to their website in its first month \u26a1\ufe0f Every new project means more burns, more exposure, more adoption \ud83d\udd25#VOLT $VOLT #VOLTINU #VOLTARMY pic.twitter.com/smueRn2Xx3 \u2014 Volt Inu \u26a1\ufe0f (@VoltInuOfficial) February 13, 2023\n\nVolt Inu ($VOLT) is tackling DeFi from multiple angles with its \u2018one-stop shop\u2019 ecosystem, aiming to bring profits back to the native token and supporting its deflationary purpose. Volt Inu offers a permissionless Decentralized Exchange which allows projects to get listed for free alongside an NFT collection with exclusive access to events, meetups and rights within the VOLT ecosystem, such as P2E games."

        "title": "Everything you need to know about filing crypto taxes \u2014 especially if your exchange went bankrupt - CNBC",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency is classified as property by the IRS. That means crypto income and capital gains are taxable and crypto losses may be tax deductible. Last year, many cryptocurrencies lost more than half their value and major crypto exchanges \u2014 like FTX \u2014 collapsed. The silver lining is you may be able to reduce your 2022 tax burden if you lost money in crypto. CNBC Select talked with Shehan Chandrasekera, head of tax strategy at CoinTracker, a crypto tax software company, about how cryptocurrency is taxed and what you need to know if your crypto exchange declared bankruptcy.\n\nHow cryptocurrency is taxed\n\nMany of cryptocurrency's most passionate advocates emphasize the decentralization of the blockchain, but it's important to remember that the federal government is keeping tabs on who is earning how much when it comes to crypto and taxes. \"The biggest misconception in this space in general is that people think that crypto is invisible to the regulators. But that's not the case,\" says Chandrasekera. There's a permanent record of all your activity on the blockchain and many crypto exchanges report to the IRS. For the most part, the IRS treats crypto as an asset subject to its rules on capital gains and losses, similar to stocks. When you buy cryptocurrency or stocks, the original purchase price of the asset becomes its cost basis. When you sell that asset, you're taxed based on the difference between the cost basis and the sale price. Capital gains and capital losses are based on the net total of all transactions that year. If you sold five different assets for a total gain of $10,000 and three other assets at a total loss of $15,000, then you have $5,000 in capital losses. You can deduct up to $3,000 a year in capital losses from your taxable income and can carry over losses exceeding that annual limit to future years. For example, if you had $5,000 in capital losses in 2022, you can reduce your taxable income by $3,000 in 2022 and apply the remaining $2,000 in losses to 2023. Capital gains are taxed differently based on how long you hold an asset before selling. Short-term capital gains taxes apply to assets you've held for one year or less and long-term capital gains taxes are assessed when you sell an asset after owning it for more than one year. Your exact capital gains rate depends on several factors, but long-term capital gains are typically taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains. And you may not have to pay any capital gains tax at all, depending on your filing status and taxable income. If you use digital currency for daily transactions, you may want to enlist the help of a tax professional.

However, there are instances where cryptocurrency is taxed as income, in which case it's subject to a marginal tax rate of up to 37% depending on your income level and filing status. Below we examine how each type of crypto transaction is classified for tax purposes: 1. Selling cryptocurrency (capital gains) Anytime you sell cryptocurrency the gain or loss in value has tax implications. This type of transaction tends to be straightforward, especially if you aren't frequently buying and selling crypto, and is classified under capital gains. 2. Exchanging one cryptocurrency for another (capital gains) A crypto swap is when you directly trade one cryptocurrency for another without exchanging your crypto for cash. Chandrasekera points out that many people mistakenly overlook this type of transaction when it comes to taxes because no cash was realized. But if you exchange Bitcoin for Litecoin or Ethereum for Bitcoin, it's a taxable event. 3. Spending crypto for goods or services (capital gains) Using crypto to buy goods or services has the same tax implications as selling it. \"It could be as little as you're going to Starbucks and spending a fraction of a Bitcoin to buy something and that could result in a taxable gain,\" Chandrasekera says. When you're buying anything with crypto, the taxable gain or loss is based on what you paid for the cryptocurrency and its value at the time of the transaction. 4. When you earn cryptocurrency (income) When you earn cryptocurrency it is considered taxable income based on the value of the coins at the time of receipt. This includes crypto earned from activities such as: Mining cryptocurrencies\n\nCrypto staking income\n\nYields on crypto accounts\n\nCrypto earned as regular pay or bonuses 5. Anytime you receive free coins (income) There are instances where you may receive free crypto and the value of the digital coins you receive is considered income. Two common scenarios where you may receive free crypto are airdrops and hard forks. An airdrop is when cryptocurrencies are given away for free and it's typically used as a marketing tool for new cryptocurrencies. A hard fork is a bit more complicated but to simplify it, it's essentially when a cryptocurrency splits into two types of tokens or coins. When this happens, you'll have your original coin and a new coin, with a separate value. The value of the cryptocurrency you receive from a hard fork is taxable income.\n\nWhat to do if your crypto exchange went bankrupt in 2022\n\nLast year, a crash in the crypto markets led to a string of crypto firms declaring bankruptcy \u2014 most notably FTX, which at its peak was valued at $32 billion. If you had crypto assets tied up in a company that's filed for bankruptcy, unfortunately, there isn't anything you can do for the 2022 tax year. \"When those bankruptcies get finalized in 2023, we will have more clarity on the amount of loss, the type of deduction you can get depending on the findings of the bankruptcies,\" Chandrasekera says. The bankruptcies could be the result of fraud or simply bad business decisions and, \"all those things affect the amount of the deduction, the type of the deduction and even when you can take the deduction,\" Chandrasekera says. It's also possible that you may get (some of) your money back, he says.\n\nSubscribe to the Select Newsletter! Our best selections directly into your inbox.

Any time you sell or exchange crypto, it's a taxable event. This includes using crypto used to pay for goods or services. In most cases, the IRS taxes cryptocurrencies as an asset and subjects them to long-term or short-term capital gains taxes. However, sometimes cryptocurrency is treated as income.

        "title": "Ethereum on-chain data suggests ETH sell pressure could be a non-event after the Shanghai upgrade - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The upcoming Ethereum Shanghai hard fork is slated to occur in March 2023, and the upgrade will cap off the network\u2019s move to proof-of-stake (PoS), which started during the Merge on Sept. 15, 2022. Once Shanghai is implemented, previously locked Ether (ETH) will gradually become liquid for the first time since December 2020.\n\nAccording to on-chain Etherscan data, over 16.6 million ETH is currently locked in the PoS staking protocol, which was valued at $28 billion on Feb. 16, 2023. Ethereum\u2019s move from proof-of-work (PoW) to PoS has started to achieve the original goal, which was to make Ether\u2019s supply deflationary. In the 154 days since the Merge, over 24,800 ETH has been burned to make the token 0.05% deflationary on a yearly basis.\n\nKey Ether stats since the Merge. Source: Ultra sound money\n\nOn. Feb. 16, the total Ether supply sits at 120 million, meaning that a little over 10% of the supply will be unlocked, with yield rewards starting with the Shanghai update.\n\nLet\u2019s explore what on-chain metrics can help identify what may happen during the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nA portion of locked ETH is liquid thanks to liquid staking derivatives\n\nIn order to benefit from yield rewards before the Shanghai update, investors had to lock their ETH and run a reliable node. The minimum staking requirement of 32 locked ETH is entirely illiquid, meaning traders had limited utility options for these coins.\n\nLiquid staking derivatives (LSD) allow users to benefit from staked Ether while retaining the ability to sell the derivative token received on the secondary market. The LSD protocols took a fee and locked the native Ether, giving users another token that represents a stake in the pool.\n\nLiquid staking derivatives did not gain prominence until Lido and other protocols began to see a rush of cash flow after the Merge. Since Ether staking began, liquid staking has surpassed illiquid staking. As of Feb. 13, 57% of staked Ether is liquid versus 43% illiquid.\n\nLiquid vs. illiquid staking. Source: Binance\n\nSince a majority of the locked Ether is through LSD, investors currently have access to liquidity, which could reduce sell pressure post-Shanghai.\n\nVery few stakers are in profit\n\nBack in December 2020 when Ether staking opened, the price of Ether ranged from $400 to $700. Conversely, many investors began staking when Ether was near its all-time high of $4,200. According to Binance:\n\n\u201cWe note a sizable amount of ETH (around 2M) was staked at prices in the US $400\u2013700 range \u2014 this represents the earliest stakers in Dec 2020 \u2014 a group that is likely illiquid given that liquid staking was far less known at the time.\u201d\n\nBecause of Ether\u2019s 69% correction since hitting an all-time high, many of the investors who staked their Ether are currently at an unrealized loss.\n\nPrice when staking occurred. Source: Binance\n\nThe minority of stakers who are in profit are likely to be strong believers in the Ethereum network since the date for liquidity was still unknown at this time. With a large number of stakers at a loss and those who are profitable likely to be long-term investors, Ether\u2019s price may not see a massive dump when the tokens are able to be unstaked.\n\nLido overtakes solo stakers\n\nOn Jan. 2, 2023, Lido officially overtook MakerDAO as the highest total value locked in decentralized finance. As of Feb. 13, Lido is also the largest staking entity in Ether. With over 5 billion ETH staked in Lido, the protocol represents 29.2% of all entities. Notably, almost 30% of all stakers have the option for current liquidity through Lido.\n\nSolo stakers who run nodes took a risk to run nodes from home or with a small group. Solo stakers likely believe that Ether is a long-term currency since nodes carry cost and risk. Solo stakers currently make up 24.9% of all stakers.\n\nStaked Ether by entity. Source: Binance\n\nWith nearly 55% of all staked Ether being held by either solo stakers or Lido, the risk of an Ether price dump may be reduced.\n\nWhile the on-chain data surrounding the Shanghai fork may be bullish for the Ethereum network, some analysts are still predicting the potential for a sharp downside in Ether\u2019s price.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Get your daily, bite-sized digest of cryptoasset and blockchain-related news \u2013 investigating the stories flying under the radar of today\u2019s crypto news.__________Regulation news\n\nThere is \u201ca fundamental clash between traditional banking regulatory approaches and the crypto world,\u201d argued Tobias Adrian, the Financial Counsellor and Director of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He explained that, while institutions must be able to ensure that what is happening is legal, that is \u201cvery difficult to do in a world where transactions are fundamentally anonymous.\u201d What regulators want and need to do, he opined, is fundamentally at odds with the design of crypto.\n\nEthereum news\n\nMarius VanDerWijden, a core developer on Ethereum (ETH)\u2019s upcoming Shanghai-Capella upgrade, reported on Thursday a bug on the Zhejiang testnet, saying that it was fixed. He wrote: \u201cThe last 4 and a half stressful hours of debugging culminated in this amazing bug fix. We got reports that geth nodes wouldn't sync the Zhejiang devnet correctly. The issue was that if a block body was empty (no tx, no withdrawals) we wouldn't initialize it correctly.\u201d Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko added that \u201ceveryone felt confident they could patch it quickly.\u201d\n\nCBDC news\n\nThe Bank of Japan announced plans to roll out a new pilot for its central bank digital currency (CBDC) program in April. There will not be real transactions taking place among participating users, only \u201csimulated transactions,\u201d Japan's central bank explained. \u201cThe aim of the pilot program is twofold: first, to test the technical feasibility not fully covered by the PoCs [Proof of Concept], and second, to utilize the skills and insights of private businesses in terms of technology and operation for designing a CBDC ecosystem in the possible event of social implementation,\u201d it said.\n\nStablecoin news\n\nUSDT issuer Tether said that \u201cin light of recent regulatory headwinds which have caused issues for BUSD and to a lesser degree USDC, USDT currently represents roughly half of the overall stablecoin market.\u201d The announcement added that Tether settled more value in 2022 than ever before and that total settlement for Tether crossed $18.2 trillion \u201cwhich was more than either Mastercard or Visa,\u201c it claimed. USDT is now backed in excess of 81% by cash and cash equivalents without any exposure to commercial paper, which includes over $39 billion in direct exposure to US Treasuries with the remainder constituted by money market funds, reverse repo agreements, and cash and bank deposits, it said.\n\nDeFi news\n\nEthereum scaling solution zkSync Era announced its Fair Onboarding Alpha, saying that \u201cthe first zkEVM on Ethereum is finally lifting the gates to let registered projects deploy on mainnet.\u201d The team also announced that zkSync Era is now full open source with the freedom to view, modify and fork the code, as well as that zkSync 2.0 has been renamed to zkSync Era, and zkSync 1.0 is now zkSync Lite. The team will be updating the protocol roadmap and publishing an overview of the next milestones soon.\n\nInvestment news\n\nThe Cornell SC Johnson College of Business announced the US-based startup Ripple as the newest sponsor of the Fintech at Cornell initiative. Per the press release, Fintech at Cornell prepares students for the digital age by engaging them with faculty members, thought leaders, entrepreneurs, industry leaders, and policymakers in discussion and debate on the socioeconomic implications and applications of AI, big data, blockchain, digital assets, digitization, and more.\n\nWeb3 security company Stelo announced a $6 million seed round of funding led by a16z crypto with participation by First Round Capital, Opensea Ventures, Chainforest, BoxGroup, Pear, Homebrew, Louis Beryl, Sabrina Hahn, Dylan Field, Dan Romero, Gokul Rajaram, Lenny Rachitsky, and others. Stelo aims to expand the reach of its tools to make transacting on the blockchain simple and safe, it said. Stelo also announced the Stelo v2 extension, the developer API to empower dapps and wallets to use the Stelo Transaction Engine, and approvals.xyz, an approval experience for users to understand their wallet health and keep it safe, it added.\n\nMining news\n\nBitcoin miner CleanSpark announced a purchase of 20,000 brand new Antminer S19j Pro+ units for $43.6 million. After coupons, the company expects to pay $32.3 million, for a discount of 25% or a total price per terrahash of approximately $13.25. The Pro+ is more power-efficient and 22% more productive than the Antminer S19j Pro model and will be shipped in batches, with deliveries starting as early as next month, lasting until the end of May, the company said. CleanSpark plans to deploy the fleet of new machines at its wholly-owned bitcoin mining locations in the USA.\n\nCareer news"

        "title": "4 Low-Risk Cryptocurrencies to Buy Right Now: Big Eyes Coin, Ethereum, Polygon, and Apecoin - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency is known for its high volatility and the risk attached to assets. However, the ultimate nugget for most investors and traders is to often go for low-risk investment, which usually involves assessing the circumstances around the crypto asset. High risk comes with high rewards, but if you can conveniently stay patient with low-risk plays, you\u2019ll find your rhythm. High-risk plays are too dangerous because you burn down your bankroll or capital faster, which is not how you want to navigate the crypto market. You must protect your liquidity, and you give yourself multiple chances to try again and find the right trades or investments. Here are four low-risk cryptocurrencies to buy in the market right now: Apecoin (APE), Polygon (MATIC), Ethereum (ETH), and last but not least, Big Eyes Coin (BIG).\n\nNote that cryptocurrencies are still quite volatile, but this list was made in relative comparison to the larger market.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Safety In Size\n\nEthereum (ETH) is the second largest asset in the cryptocurrency market, and with huge market capitalization comes less volatility. Going by this logic, Bitcoin is the least volatile asset in the market, closely followed by Ethereum. Ethereum is also the most valuable network in the landscape owing to the massive value built on top of the chain. The network is a huge contributor to the growth of the landscape, so it\u2019s one of the low-risk ways to invest in the crypto market. Ethereum has undergone several upgrades in the past few days to ensure that it becomes fully scalable. The upcoming Shanghai launch will enable the ETH tokens staked by validators to become withdrawable, with other intricacies.\n\nPolygon (MATIC): Layer-2 Ethereum Solution\n\nPolygon (MATIC) is a layer-2 Ethereum solution or side chain, as some prefer to call it. The network was created to improve, connect, and grow Ethereum and other Ethereum-compatible networks. Polygon is a highly-efficient network with impressive scalability; the network processes several transactions at a very low cost. This network has proven helpful in reducing DeFi and NFT landscape costs. NFT transactions on Polygon cost zero gas. Polygon has been impressive in the past weeks and has secured partnerships with top web2 corporations like Reddit, Starbucks, Meta, etc. What makes it relatively low-risk is its prospect for the future of blockchain and its contribution to blockchain adoption so far.\n\nApecoin (APE): Gaming Fun Meets Cryptocurrency\n\nApecoin (APE) is a gaming token created by Yuga Labs and is purported to power a game announced to launch in a few months. Yuga Labs is a mother brand to some of the most valuable NFT collections in the market. This value translates to their influence on the market, which contributed to the success of Apecoin when it launched. Apecoin launched as an airdrop to core community members and had an impressive start in 2022. Moreso, what makes this particular crypto asset relatively low-risk is the mid-term prospects it has to help holders make money.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG): New Cat On The Ethereum Block\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is a new meme coin project launching on the Ethereum blockchain and has enormous prospects of being one the largest meme coin projects. The cat-themed meme coin is on presale and offers an opportunity for early investors to get some tokens at a below-market price. The meme coin project aims to help its investors create wealth with innovative DeFi features, NFTs, gaming, and the metaverse. The project will be looking to push community events, campaigns, contests, etc., in a bid to grow the community and promote a culture that would help the project become bigger. Big Eyes (BIG) presale has already raised over $27 million and could potentially be big enough to help investors make a profit. Join the Big Eyes Coin (BIG) presale here now. And when doing so, make sure to use code LAUNCHBIGEYES200 to get a 200% bonus on any BIG purchase!\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "After facing a bit of selling pressure on the Fed rhetoric, the crypto market is showing signs of recovery again. The Ethereum price (ETH) is up by 3% in the last 24 hours shooting past $1,700 levels for the first time in five months.\n\nInterestingly, the Ethereum price is currently at the highest level since the merge event in mid-September 2022. As per on-chain data provider Santiment both \u2013 shark and whales \u2013 have been holding their ETH supplies strongly. It notes: \u201cshark & whale addresses holding 100-100K $ETH still hold nearly 47% of the supply\u201d. The same cohort of investors has also accumulated nearly 2 million ETH since November 5th.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Volatility Ahead of Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghai upgrade scheduled for the next month of March will introduce withdrawals for more than 16.5 million ether (ETH) staked in the blockchain. The Shanghai upgrade is likely to change the ETH supply and demand dynamics in the market and thus traders are expecting Ethereum price volatility going ahead.\n\nWith the Shanghai upgrade, $25 billion worth of ETH will be available for withdrawals as well as sale in the open market. Besides, the staking yields for ETH are also likely to decrease after the upgrade. Thus, there\u2019s a possibility that traders would unstake their coins and instead move the capital to other coins that offer better yields.\n\nIn his recent podcast interview, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also shared further developments in the Ethereum roadmap. According to him, the main thing to focus on currently is sharding.\n\nWith sharding, Ethereum will build a system that supports more transactions than a single node can verify. Thus, it would improve the scalability of the Ethereum blockchain considerably.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s roll-ups centric roadmap seeks to focus on making the Ethereum blockchain friendly to people willing to build Layer 2 scaling solutions that could easily plug into Ethereum for security.\n\nIntern Notes on The Network State Podcast #1 ft @balajis & @VitalikButerin \u2013 How the $200B idea was born \ud83d\udca1\n\n\u2013 Rising issues of censorship & privacy\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\ud83d\udea8\n\n\u2013 Vitalik's secrets to leveling up his game (you dont want to miss this) Here're 6 takeaways from the 117 mins podcast pic.twitter.com/FLTMoRbakl \u2014 Whospay Intern (@whospay_intern) February 16, 2023"

        "title": "SEC vs. Kraken: A one-off or opening salvo in an assault on crypto? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "In a year of crypto upheavals, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s settlement with crypto exchange Kraken, announced on Feb. 9, set off yet another tremor. Agency chief Gary Gensler took to mainstream media last week to explain the agency\u2019s action, which seemed to be an attack on crypto staking \u2014 part of the validation mechanism used by a number of blockchain platforms, including Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest network.\n\nThe immediate issue, in the agency\u2019s view, was that Kraken had been selling unregistered investment products. Indeed, it was advertising big returns on staking crypto \u2014 up to 21%, Gensler told CNBC.com.\n\n\u201cThe problem was they were not disclosing to the investing public the risks that the investing public were entering into,\u201d Gensler said. Moreover, the SEC's action, which required Kraken to shell out $30 million and shut down its staking operation, could have been easily avoided, he seemed to imply:\n\n\u201cKraken knew how to register, others know how to register. It's just a form on our website. They can come in, talk to our talented people on disclosure review teams. And if they want to offer staking, we're neutral. Come in and register, because investors need that disclosure.\u201d\n\nNot all in the crypto industry were totally satisfied with this response, however. \u201cI find the SEC\u2019s \u2018all crypto projects have to do is come in and register\u2019 line unbelievably insulting,\u201d tweeted Morrison Cohen LLP attorney Jason Gottlieb. \u201cThere is simply no path to registration for many crypto products.\u201d\n\nI find the SEC\u2019s \u201call crypto projects have to do is come in and register\u201d line unbelievably insulting.\n\n\n\nIt assumes there\u2019s this vast quantity of sophisticated securities lawyers advising clients, \u201cnah man, screw the SEC, yolo baby, do whatever you want.\u201d 1/6 \u2014 Jason Gottlieb (@ohaiom) February 11, 2023\n\n\u201cThe registration of staking program securities is not as simple as filing a form on the SEC\u2019s website,\u201d Michael Selig, an attorney with Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, told Cointelegraph. \u201cPublic offerings of securities are heavily regulated and expensive to conduct.\u201d\n\nOthers view the agency\u2019s decision to charge Kraken as the first salvo in a general assault on crypto by U.S. regulators. \u201cIf approved by a court, the settlement marks a potential turning point for cryptocurrency regulation and the SEC\u2019s broader efforts to bring the industry under its jurisdiction,\u201d reported CNN. \u201cThe move could lead to a wider clampdown,\u201d speculated The New York Times, including possibly banning staking for retail U.S. investors.\n\nBut maybe the industry was over-reacting. That is, staking as practiced by Ethereum and other blockchains as a way to reward network validators may not be on the SEC\u2019s radar screen at all. The agency could be motivated by consumer protection concerns primarily and, in this instance, it wanted to make an example of Kraken, especially in light of FTX\u2019s November collapse and the bankruptcy of assorted crypto lending firms.\n\n\u201cYes, I am sure they [the SEC] wanted to make an example of Kraken, especially because it promoted the opportunity to make returns of up to 21%,\u201d Carol Goforth, university professor and Clayton N. Little professor of law at the University of Arkansas, told Cointelegraph.\n\nRecent: Binance banking problems highlight a divide between crypto firms and banks\n\n\u201cKraken set the returns for amounts staked, not the underlying blockchain protocols. [...] Honestly, the way that Kraken operated its program looks like an investment contract under Howey,\u201d she said. The SEC uses the Howey Test to determine whether a transaction qualifies as an investment contract, which then requires SEC registration.\n\nBill Hughes, senior counsel and director of global regulatory matters at ConsenSys, told Cointelegraph, \u201cIt\u2019s a one-off action that is intended to not just resolve Kraken\u2019s offering but, importantly, to send signals across the space about what features of staking-as-a-service the SEC believes are problematic.\u201d If another staking service fails to pay attention to these signals, they too can expect the SEC to take action, said Hughes, adding:\n\n\u201cI think the SEC hopes the market gets the message and adjusts accordingly \u2014 as they\u2019d probably prefer to move on to other issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Kraken case is primarily about sanctioning its [Kraken\u2019s] blatant and non-transparent behavior vis-\u00e0-vis their retail customers, and not for just offering a staking-as-a-service per se,\u201d Markus Hammer, an attorney and principal at the Switzerland-based Hammer Execution consulting firm, told Cointelegraph.\n\nIs Ethereum at risk?\n\nThe market didn\u2019t necessarily see this as a one-off action on the part of the agency, however. Ether (ETH) plummeted around 6.5% on the day of the settlement announcement, its largest one-day decline since mid-December. As widely reported, Ethereum moved last year from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Dubbed \u201cthe Merge,\u201d this technical makeover was hailed by many for radically reducing the network\u2019s prodigious energy usage and carbon footprint. But some, at least, feared Ethereum was now in the sights of U.S. regulators because of its new staking protocols.\n\nEquating Kraken and Ethereum could be a mistake, though. As Matthew Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cThe SEC's enforcement action against Kraken is not an enforcement action against Ethereum for using a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. It was an enforcement action against Kraken for offering a staking service. Those are different things.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Ethereum could continue to function securely as a PoS network even if the SEC were to ban all staking services in the U.S., said Hougan, though he doesn\u2019t expect that to happen. \u201cActivity would simply migrate offshore or be done directly by individuals,\u201d he said. More than enough ETH could still be staked to ensure network integrity. \u201cThe main result would be that U.S. investors would lose out on both the opportunity and the risk of staking. The world, however, would go on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe action is not against staking platforms but against staking service providers that organize and operate pools,\u201d Goforth said. \u201cIf the organizer controls the pools and the rates of return\u201d \u2014 as with Kraken \u2014 \u201cthen this action does suggest that the SEC will treat the program as involving the distribution of investment contracts.\u201d\n\nBy comparison, she said, \u201cif the blockchain protocol allows others to set up pools,\u201d as with Ethereum, \u201cthat is not necessarily within the rationale of this order.\u201d\n\nHughes agreed. There is nothing in the SEC\u2019s complaint that implies that staking itself is problematic. \u201cSEC\u2019s action focuses squarely on the Kraken custodial staking program, which promised a specific yield, pool funds and did not disclose risks or fees. It says nothing about ETH staking or any other chain\u2019s consensus mechanism,\u201d he said.\n\nEthereum also hosts many use cases that have nothing to do with investing (e.g., elections). Just because the network has moved to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism doesn\u2019t by itself mean that its native coin, Ether, should now automatically be classified as a security. One has to look at \u201cthe nature of the underlying multi-purpose blockchain and respective ecosystem,\u201d said Hammer. Moreover, these will need to be assessed blockchain by blockchain, he added.\n\nAn opening volley?\n\nAll this may be well and true, but could this really be an opening fusillade as part of a broader post-FTX attack on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology \u2014 and not just \u201cinvestment solutions\u201d offered by a few centralized service providers?\n\n\u201cThe SEC tends to act in an incremental way, bringing new enforcement actions that build upon prior enforcement actions,\u201d Selig told Cointelegraph. \u201cThe crypto industry is sensibly concerned that the SEC is focused on custodial staking programs today but will set its sights on staking more broadly in the future.\u201d\n\nHughes tends toward the more limited view, mainly \u201cbecause that is what this complaint is on its face. Whether the SEC gets more aggressive and goes after core blockchain functionality is to be seen.\u201d\n\nBlockdaemon CEO and founder Konstantin Richter appeared to agree. \u201cWith the complaint, staking itself does not appear to be the issue,\u201d Richter told Cointelegraph. \u201cThis indicates that institutional investors that have the ability to stake can continue without using a centralized custodial exchange.\u201d\n\nHougan, for his part, isn\u2019t quite so confident that a clampdown isn\u2019t coming, telling Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cCrypto is facing a coordinated regulatory crackdown in the U.S. You are seeing that crackdown in the SEC's recent statements and actions, and in recent efforts by the FDIC, OCC and Federal Reserve to restrict the crypto industry's access to the traditional banking system.\u201d\n\nThese actions are worrisome but not surprising, continued Hougan. The numerous failures over the past year like FTX, Celsius, Genesis, BlockFi, Voyager and Terra have \u201cpointed to some significant risks in the crypto ecosystem and the need \u2014 in certain cases \u2014 for better regulation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is far from the first salvo in a U.S. assault on crypto,\u201d said Goforth. \u201cThe SEC has been relatively hostile to crypto assets for years; this seems to be a continuation of that approach [...] as it continues to devote resources to case-by-case enforcement rather than offering a genuinely helpful roadmap for compliance, such as by drafting exemptions based on tailored disclosures.\u201d\n\n\u2018First inning of a nine inning game\u2019\n\nGensler may have been disingenuous when he invited exchanges like Kraken to just fill out a form on the SEC\u2019s website. SEC registration is an involved undertaking. \u201cIt is an incredibly difficult process, often costing a million dollars or more \u2014 in legal, accounting, and investment advisor fees \u2014 the first time an issuer seeks to register a conventional security,\u201d noted Goforth. It also can take a long time to get approved.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t necessarily follow, however, that Gensler will go after Ethereum and other PoS platforms. The agency chief, it might be remembered, once taught a course on blockchain technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and he knows a good bit about decentralized networks and their purposes. He probably understands that the technology offers all sorts of non-investment use cases, even PoS platforms with validators that have \u201cskin in the game\u201d as they work to ensure network integrity.\n\nRecent: Multichain DEXs are on the rise with new protocols enabling them\n\nIndeed, the Kraken settlement might have only confirmed that \u201cthat the SEC still is not clear about when consumer protection regulations apply to the crypto world,\u201d Hammer opined. Before the Merge, both the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission regarded Ether as a commodity rather than a security.\n\nOverall, the jury could still be out as to whether the SEC is engaged here in a limited regulatory action or is instead discharging the opening volley in a wider war on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Most favor the former interpretation, but as Hougan concluded:\n\n\u201cWhether the current regulatory crackdown is going to strangle crypto or ultimately unleash its full potential \u2014 I think it's too early to say. The right kind of regulatory progress could be incredibly positive for crypto, but overly restrictive or punitive regulation would be crippling. [...] We're in the first inning of a nine-inning game.\u201d"

        "title": "Can Ethereum reach $10000? Here's how this could be possible - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-ranked crypto by market capitalization, has recorded enormous gains in recent years both from a price level and development activity. The decentralized nature of the ecosystem has seen a section of the market align Ethereum with flipping Bitcoin (BTC) in the future.\n\nWith the asset also viewed as an investment vehicle, proponents have placed several growth targets that can be achieved as the crypto space matures. Indeed, one of Ethereum\u2019s most monitored metrics is the price action that has corrected over the last year in line with the overall crypto market downturn. One of the most watched price positions is the $10,000 spot.\n\nIs $10k possible for Ethereum?\n\nThere is no doubt that the price of Ethereum may touch $10,000, but the main question remains when? It is worth pointing out that several factors have influenced Ethereum\u2019s past price rallies. In the current state, cryptocurrency sector dynamics differ from what was observed during the decentralized finance (DeFi) token\u2019s previous skyrocketing periods.\n\nHowever, there are necessary conditions for Ethereum to reach a value of $10,000. One crucial factor would be the continued restoration of investors\u2019 trust in the crypto market, which needs to be widespread to establish a conducive atmosphere for Ethereum\u2019s substantial and sustained growth.\n\nEthereum has rallied in 2023, aiming to exit the bear market from last year. In this case, the market rally is led by assets like Bitcoin. Historically, when Bitcoin records gains, it tends to pull the rest of the market along, with Ethereum in line to benefit.\n\nImpact of network development activity\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s ongoing blockchain upgrades that peaked with the shift to the proof-of-stake (PoS) will remain influential in the asset\u2019s prospects. Analysts have also opined that the impact of the Merge upgrade will be felt in the future, with the asset reducing energy consumption while attempting to entice institutional investors.\n\nBased on this aspect, market participants believe that once investors start accessing their staked Ethereum, it might have a bullish sentiment for ETH. Notably, accessing staked ETH is slated for 2023 Q1 after the Shanghai upgrade goes live.\n\nRegarding network upgrades, the asset might also benefit from sharding, which is set to improve scalability and reduce transaction fees. However, delays in the estimated 2023-2024 upgrade could hinder Ethereum\u2019s progress, while an on-time upgrade could be a significant catalyst for the cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum competition\n\nElsewhere, Ethereum also faces the threat of not realizing its full operation, considering the number of competitors joining the market. Networks such as Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) are also emerging as possible \u2018Ethereum killers.\u2019\n\nEthereum is, however, commanding the lead mainly due to the size of the network, as evidenced by the number of active smart contracts, decentralized apps (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and support for non-fungible tokens (NFT).\n\nAdditionally, investors need to keep an eye on the regulatory aspect of how Ethereum might be impacted in the future. In this line, the United States regulator has recently launched a crackdown on staking, factors that could affect Ethereum.\n\nOverall, the ability to hit $10,000 is backed by several projections. For instance, the text-based artificial intelligence (AI) platform ChatGPT stated that Ethereum will likely trade in the $5,000 \u2013 $20,000 by 2030.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nTo hit $10,000, Ethereum still has several price levels to clear, with $5,000 as a critical resistance position considering ETH had hit a record high of about $4,800 over a year ago.\n\nIn the meantime, Ethereum has been attempting to hold above $1,600 as the asset targets reclaiming $1,800. By press time, Ethereum was trading at 1,666.\n\nETH seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nFrom a technical analysis perspective, ETH\u2019s one-day gauges on TradingView are dominated by mixed signals. A summary is for neutrality at 8, while moving averages recommend buying at 8. Oscillators are for \u2018sell\u2019 at 2.\n\nEthereum technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nGenerally, like the rest of the crypto market, Ethereum\u2019s prospects remain uncertain.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Major cryptocurrencies\u2019 price, including Ethereum (ETH/USD) and Bitcoin, were affected by macro data released by the United States.\n\nThe middle week of February brought with it important news for traditional financial markets.\n\nIn particular, the release of US macro data, including the consumer price index (CPI) and producer prices (PPI), was much higher than expected.\n\nThis could have a significant impact on the program of the Fed, the US central bank, which may be forced to change its monetary policy again.\n\nSome bankers on the Fed board have become hawkish again, that is, in favor of raising interest rates. Specifically, there is talk of a 50 basis point increase during the upcoming March and June meetings, rather than the 25 basis points as was thought until a few days ago. This would bring the range of rates between 5% and 5.25 % over the course of the year.\n\nThe nervous reaction of the markets, as predicted in the article earlier this week, was not long in coming, with bond indices falling followed by equity indices. The Standard&Poor 500 is set to close its second consecutive week below par.\n\nHowever, digital assets have fared decidedly differently. Cryptocurrency prices rallied again, recording new highs since the beginning of the year. In particular, Bitcoin was up 10% on a weekly basis, followed by Ethereum and all other major cryptocurrencies, with weekly rises close to double digits.\n\nAmong the big names, the token of Polygon (MATIC) firmly held its place on the top step of the podium of rises since the beginning of the year (+90% YTD), continuing to reap rises week after week and heading to close its sixth consecutive week up, with a streak that has never happened in its history.\n\nIn recent hours, MATIC\u2019s price has surpassed $12.7 per token, recovering its highest level in 12 months. Should Sunday night\u2019s closing week confirm current prices, or higher, it would end the week with a gain greater than 18% for the third time since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market held other surprises, with some digital assets posting double-digit weekly gains. Among the 50 largest capitalized ones, Filecoin (FIL) and Internet Computer (ICP) stand out.\n\nFilecoin, the governance token of the first decentralized InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) data storage network, has hit a 40% rise from last Friday\u2019s levels, pushing above $6.5 per token for the first time since last August. It currently ranks 27th with a market capitalization of $924 million.\n\nInternet Computer (ICP) has also seen significant growth in its weekly price, rising 30% and pushing above $6.6 for the first time since September. ICP\u2019s Blockchain was developed in 2016 by the Zurich, Switzerland-based Dfinity Foundation with the goal of enabling developers to create decentralized firewall-protected systems and services managed by smart contracts, as well as tokenized cloud computing apps and services.\n\nBoth projects are based on blockchain technology and offer innovative solutions for data management and storage. In particular, Filecoin (FIL) is designed to offer a decentralized storage solution that allows data to be securely and reliably saved without relying on a single central server.\n\nInternet Computer (ICP), on the other hand, aims to revolutionize the way cloud services are delivered by offering a platform that can manage applications more efficiently and securely. Using blockchain technology, data is protected from cyber attacks and provides greater privacy and security.\n\nFollowing the rally in recent weeks of other artificial intelligence-related projects, the positive performance of Filecoin and Internet Computer shows that the artificial intelligence-related cryptocurrency sector is attracting the interest of savvy users and the possibility of seeing innovative and reliable projects emerge by gaining adoption by enterprising investors.\n\nPrice analysis of Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nThe strong performance at the beginning of the week (+9.2%) confirms the restart of the new monthly cycle, as hypothesized in the last update written on these pages at the beginning of the week.\n\nIn fact, the lows recorded between Friday and Monday of last week confirmed the market\u2019s rebound, taking prices above the highs of the previous cycle, with the $24,000 being exceeded.\n\nDespite the upward jump on Wednesday 15 February, which recorded the second best performance in the past 3 months, the red close of the next daily candle yesterday, Thursday 16 February, with prices at the lowest levels of the day that recorded the highest highs of the past six months, drew a dangerous \u2018shooting star\u2019 on the chart.\n\nIn addition, yesterday\u2019s day recorded the highest trading volume in the last quarter, raising fears of a massive prevalence of profit-taking concomitant with the break of medium-term resistance.\n\nFor this reason, it becomes important to follow the market\u2019s trend in the coming days, monitoring daily closes above $23,750, which represents daily resistance from the beginning of the month, or below $23,520, the closing level of yesterday\u2019s candle that becomes crucial support of the fledgling monthly cycle.\n\nIn summary, Bitcoin\u2018s positive trend suffered a setback yesterday, but the situation remains positive, also confirmed by the Fear & Greed Index at its highest levels since November 2021.\n\nPrice analysis of Ethereum (ETH/USD)\n\nThe technical structure of Ethereum is similar to that of Bitcoin.\n\nIn the week just passed, the price rise took Ethereum above $1,720, touching a height not seen since early September last year.\n\nHowever, yesterday\u2019s bearish \u2018shooting star\u2019 candle on Thursday, 16 February, slowed the celebration of new annual highs, warning investors against new buying.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, today\u2019s close, as well as that of the next two days of the weekend, should not record closes below $1,635, a level that coincides with yesterday\u2019s lows and close, so as not to jeopardize the start of the new monthly cycle that ignited the uptrend of the past few days.\n\nIn addition, holding support at $1,635 will be a good clue to propel prices into the $1,800 area in the coming days, which is September\u2019s resistance.\n\nOtherwise, the break of support would announce a change of trend in the early part of the cycle increasing the chances of seeing $1,480 again soon."

        "content": "Shiba Inu has dropped 4% in value during the past 24 hours, but Ethereum whales have shown signs that they are buying this dip.\n\nLarge Ethereum Whales Are Currently Scooping Up Shiba Inu\n\nAfter building up some upwards momentum during the preceding couple of days, SHIB, much like the wider cryptocurrency market, has seen some pullback in the past day.\n\nAt the time of writing, SHIB is trading around $0.00001315, down 4% in the last 24 hours. The below chart shows the trend in the price of the meme coin over the past week.\n\nLooks like the value of the asset has gone down during the last day or so | Source: SHIBUSD on TradingView\n\nAs you can see in the above graph, while Shiba Inu has seen some decline during the last day, the coin is still in the green for the past week. At its about 7% gains in this period, the asset edges out the rival coin Dogecoin\u2018s 5% profits.\n\nOver the past month as well, SHIB is still in very comfortable gains of about 24%, a performance that also happens to be much better than DOGE\u2019s as the original meme coin only managed a 6% uplift in this period.\n\nDespite the drawdown today, it looks like the Ethereum whales are still unfazed, as data from the whale tracker service WhaleStats shows 500 of the largest investors in the market have rather been buying more of the cryptocurrency in the past 24 hours.\n\nThis suggests that these humongous holders see the current dip as a buying opportunity, showing that they continue to hold bullish convictions about the meme coin.\n\nThough, it\u2019s also true that the degree of their purchases hasn\u2019t been too strong today, as SHIB is only in their top 10 purchased coins right now. Nonetheless, the sign should still be positive for the investors of the cryptocurrency.\n\nAs per data from the same tracker released yesterday, Shiba Inu is also still by far the largest holding of the 2,000 largest Ethereum whales, further showing how optimistic the big players are about the coin\u2019s future right now.\n\nSHIB Gets Flipped By Litecoin (LTC) In Market Cap\n\nAs a result of the price drop observed today, Shiba Inu has conceded its place as the 13th largest coin in the sector to Litecoin. Here is a table that shows where SHIB stands among the wider cryptocurrency market in terms of the market cap right now:\n\nSHIB seems to have a market cap of about $7.2 billion at the moment | Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nShiba Inu may have dropped to 14th on the market cap list, but the gap between LTC and the meme coin is still minuscule. This means that unless one of these assets shows significant strength relative to the other, the change may not be permanent and they are likely to continue to flip each other in the coming days.\n\nFeatured image from R\u00e9mi Boudousqui\u00e9 on Unsplash.com, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "So, what exactly is GAS? Think of it as the fuel that powers the NEO network. Every time a transaction is processed on the blockchain, a small fee is paid in GAS. This fee is then distributed to those who hold NEO in their wallets. The more NEO you hold, the more GAS you earn. But that's not all. NEO also offers a number of other features that make it an attractive investment opportunity. For one, the project has a strong development team and a well-established ecosystem of developers who are constantly working to improve the platform. This means that NEO will likely remain relevant and useful for years."
