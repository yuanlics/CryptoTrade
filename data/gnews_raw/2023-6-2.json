        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Might Finally Surpass Bitcoin (BTC) by Market Cap, Analyst Displays Four Scenarios - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nIndependent cryptocurrency analyst shared the charts of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) \"domination,\" i.e., the percentage of net crypto segment market cap. He indicated two trend lines that may display the timeline of \"flippening\" much-anticipated by the Ethereum (ETH) community.\n\nEthereum (ETH) might flip Bitcoin (BTC) in 2025-2026, here's how\n\nMorgan Bennett tracked the dynamics of the share of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) market capitalization compared to the entire cryptocurrencies segment. Although he cannot call himself a \"fan\" of technical analysis, he is sure that two trends are obvious: Bitcoin's (BTC) domination shrinks while the Ethereum (ETH) one grows.\n\nNot a fan of technical analysis but it's hard to argue against long-term trends.\n\n\n\nIf the trend continues, $ETH will flip $BTC within the next 2-3 years. pic.twitter.com/CSFtnjwgnF \u2014 Mo (@MorganTBennett) June 2, 2023\n\nShould both trend lines be valid, the \"flippening\" might happen in the next two or three years. On the chart by Bennett, it takes place in Q4, 2026. Thanks to the growing size of the altcoin market, both cryptocurrencies will be responsible for 23-24% by the moment of \"flippening.\"\n\nEthereum (ETH) can surpass Bitcoin (BTC) \"gently,\" \"gradually,\" \"suddenly\" or both cryptocurrencies can fall victim to the \"Digital Gold\" narrative disappearing.\n\nBy press time, Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency, is in charge of over 46.2% of cryptocurrency market capitalization, while Ethereum's (ETH) share exceeds 19.5%. The third largest cryptocurrency, the U.S. Dollar Tether (USDT) stablecoin, totals 7.36% of net crypto market cap.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), two largest cryptocurrencies, were at the closest point to \"flippening\" six years ago, in mid-June 2017. Bitcoin (BTC) was in charge of 37% of the market, and Ethereum's (ETH) capitalization comprised 32%.\n\nBy contrast, in September 2019, Bitcoin's (BTC) market cap was 10x larger than that of Ethereum (ETH) since the latter was much more affected by the Crypto Winter of 2018-2020.\n\n\"Flippening could happen, but line is ridiculous,\" crypto veteran Chris Blec says\n\nThe followers of Bennett agreed with his calculations. However, some of them stressed that they are tired of \"flippening\" narratives that have been discussed here and there since the launch of Ethereum (ETH) in June 2015.\n\nProminent DeFi analyst and influencer Chris Blec, author of the Blec Report project, says that in general, Bitcoin (BTC) has all chances of being surpassed by Ethereum (ETH), but the accuracy of the aforementioned model should not be overestimated:\n\nI don't disagree that the flippening could happen but that line is really ridiculous.. you just completely ignored all of the data points between 2016 and today\n\nBennett agreed with this point of view, but added that it is impossible to find a function that does not predict the flippening even if Ethereum's (ETH) dominance at the start was considered 0."

        "title": "3 Cryptos That Are Better Buys Than Bitcoin or Ethereum - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Many crypto investors will likely assert that no cryptos are better buys than Bitcoin (BTC-USD) or Ethereum (ETH-USD). To some extent, when measuring for risk-adjusted returns over the long-term, that argument holds water, as there are several high potential cryptos better than Bitcoin worth considering.\n\nHowever, not all investors are looking at crypto with the same investing time horizon or frame of reference. Over the near-term, a number of other top tokens have performed very well, and may outperform these top two cryptos over time.\n\nAmidst the backdrop of a domestic banking crisis and looming concerns over a U.S. debt default, investors are increasingly considering cryptocurrencies as potential safe haven assets to navigate the economic challenges ahead. This shift in thinking marks a significant departure from just six months ago when the prevailing belief was that the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d would persist well into 2023.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut, the question arises: Are there any genuinely secure cryptocurrencies to invest in at present? If so, which ones should investors consider adding to their portfolios this month? Here are three cryptos on the top of my list of projects that could potentially outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum over the next 2-3 years.\n\nSymbol Cryptocurrency Price XMR-USD Monero $145.68 AVAX-USD Avalanche $14.44 SOL-USD Solana $20.50\n\nMonero (XMR-USD)\n\nA concept coin for Monero (XMR) has a sparkly gold background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIntroduced in 2014, Monero (XMR-USD) is a decentralized cryptocurrency and blockchain network that prioritizes privacy. With its advanced features like stealth addresses and ring signatures, Monero ensures user anonymity. Nonetheless, this commitment to privacy has also attracted heightened regulatory attention globally. This makes it one of those high potential cryptos better than Bitcoin.\n\nMonero is a leading privacy coin, offering complete anonymity and untraceability for its blockchain transactions. By employing advanced technology, Monero conceals the sender, recipient, and transaction amount, providing a high level of privacy. Encapsulating its ethos, with its motto \u201csecure, private, untraceable,\u201d Monero has garnered global user appeal. The rising demand for privacy coins has propelled XMR\u2019s price up by 16% over the past six months.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother key point is that despite regulatory and legislative scrutiny due to its potential involvement in illicit activities like international money laundering, Monero remains popular among users who are undeterred by such criticisms. The usage and value of XMR have consistently increased, with a remarkable 76% rise since 2017. Crypto enthusiasts believe that the ongoing regulation of cryptocurrencies will further drive users toward the privacy provided by Monero, indicating promising prospects for continued growth.\n\nMonero relies on Proof-of-Work for decentralized consensus and offers private, secure, and untraceable transactions through an opaque blockchain. With a default privacy setting, Monero utilizes ring confidential transactions, ring signatures, and stealth addresses. As a fungible and secure digital currency, Monero prioritizes user privacy, leading to a promising future ahead.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX-USD)\n\nGraphic of various cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum resting on a United Kingdom Union Jack flag\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/rawf8\n\nAvalanche (AVAX-USD) started May 2023 on a bullish note, trading at $16.66. Despite the bears maintaining a price of $14 since May 18, Avalanche is now edging toward the $15 mark, aiming to regain its positive price trend. The surge in trading volume indicates increased activity on the network.\n\nRecently, Avalanche has established significant support at the $14.29 price level, acting as a pivotal point for the asset. Currently, it is trading above this immediate resistance level. However, the presence of bearish market forces persists, aiming to prevent AVAX from surpassing the next resistance level at $15.21. Despite its bearish nature in the short-term, it\u2019s still one of those high potential cryptos better than Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the integration of the Ethereum Virtual Machine sets Avalanche apart as a favored platform. Developers can now create decentralized applications on a broader scale while leveraging the advantages of a faster and more economical blockchain. The Avalanche Bridge further enhances convenience and accessibility by facilitating seamless asset transfers across multiple blockchains.\n\nThe bottom line is that Avalanche stands out as a superior choice in terms of security compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Its unique feature of subnets allows the creation of both private and public blockchains, adding versatility to its network. With practical applications in the real world, Avalanche exhibits immense potential for value and growth. Despite facing a significant downturn in the 2022 bear market, Avalanche has made a remarkable recovery in 2023, positioning itself as a compelling contender in the realm of decentralized finance.\n\nSolana (SOL-USD)\n\nSolana logo on phone screen stock image. Solana price predictions.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolana (SOL-USD) empowers the development of decentralized applications (DApps) through its distinctive hybrid consensus model. By merging proof-of-history (PoH) with underlying proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus, Solana achieves exceptionally fast transaction processing. Furthermore, this speed makes it appealing to individual traders as well as institutional investors seeking efficient blockchain solutions.\n\nSolana, launched by the Solana Foundation in March 2020, stands out as an unconventional cryptocurrency project. It prioritizes functionality and operates on an open-source framework, utilizing blockchain technology to drive decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. Notably, Solana excels in both transaction speed and cost-efficiency, ensuring scalability and rapid processing. However, the network has faced intermittent outages, impacting its value and ambitions. Some critics also raise concerns about its tokenomics favoring venture capital investors. Nonetheless, Solana remains a significant player in the cryptocurrency realm.\n\nIn summary, Solana has seen a remarkable 100% surge this year, solidifying its position as an innovation powerhouse. In addition to this, their latest breakthrough, the Saga crypto phone, has the potential to revolutionize the crypto landscape. The Saga is an Android-powered mobile device designed to simplify and enhance crypto activities. With its pioneering Seed Vault technology, it streamlines the process of using your phone as a crypto wallet, eliminating common challenges faced by conventional phones. Experience a new level of convenience and efficiency in managing your crypto assets with the Saga crypto phone.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a position in ETH, SOL.

        "content": "Ether\u2019s (ETH) decentralized finance (DeFi) activity has declined in the bear market, and the sector faces further competition from Ethereum\u2019s annual staking reward of 4%, according to Glassnode analysts. However, a DeFi narrative is building around liquid staking derivative (LSD) tokens, which could revive Ethereum\u2019s network activity.\n\nThe percentage of gas consumed by DeFi protocols has dropped from 34% in 2020 to between 8% and 16% presently, with nonfungible tokens (NFTs) commanding the maximum share of 25\u201330%, according to a recent report from Glassnode.\n\nEthereum gas usage by transaction type. Source: Glassnode\n\nGlassnode\u2019s supply-weighted price index for DeFi, priced in United States dollars and ETH, recorded a 90% loss since early 2021.\n\nThe so-called DeFi \u201cblue chips,\u201d which represent a basket of governance tokens from well-known DeFi protocols like Uniswap (UNI), MakerDAO (MKR), Aave (AAVE), Compound (COMP), Balancer (BAL) and SushiSwap (SUSHI), have lost 88% of their market capitalization from all-time highs of $45 billion in May 2021.\n\nETH vs. DeFi tokens price performance. Source: Glassnode\n\nDeFi blue chip tokens have underperformed against ETH during bullish market rallies and experienced a more severe drop than ETH \u201con the downside during the bear.\u201d The analysts predict that since the staking of ETH now yields 4%, it will act as a \u201cnew hurdle rate over which token returns must jump.\u201d This yield represents the benchmark rate for Ether investors.\n\nLeading lending protocols like Aave and Compound offer between 2\u20133% yields on lending stablecoins and Ether. Moreover, DeFi protocols also come with smart contract risk, which is eliminated with proof-of-stake validators.\n\nStaking has become popular among Ethereum investors, especially after the Shapella upgrade in April 2023, which enabled redemptions from the staking contract.\n\nBy the end of May, Ethereum users staked 21.63 million ETH worth $40.021 billion, representing 18% of Ethereum\u2019s total supply.\n\nLSD platforms like Lido and Rocket Pool account for one-third of this massive market. These applications offer a tokenized representation of staked ETH, allowing investors access to the staking yields without compromising liquidity.\n\nA growing trend among Ethereum investors is interacting with LSD financialization (LSDfi), which aims to put the liquidity offered by the LSD tokens to use in DeFi applications.\n\nRelated: LSD for DeFi: Tenet, LayerZero partner to drive cross-chain liquid staking adoption\n\nIs LSDfi the solution?\n\nLSDfi leverages the liquidity of LSD tokens into DeFi-like lending protocols and liquidity on exchanges for higher yields. Given that a considerable amount of ETH is staked with the LSD platforms, LSDfi has the potential to revive DeFi activity.\n\nA Dune analytics dashboard by data analyst Defimochi shows the total value locked (TVL) in LSDfi protocols has touched $411 million, rising exponentially since mid-May. Some of the popular names in the sector are Pendle Finance, Lybra Finance, Curve Finance and Alchemix Protocol.\n\nLSDfi total value locked. Source: Dune\n\nThe liquidity of LSD tokens on Curve Finance \u2014 the largest stablecoin exchange in the market \u2014 has surpassed $1.5 billion. Curve also enabled the minting of its overcollateralized stablecoin crvUSD (CRVUSD) using Frax Protocol\u2019s staked Frax Ether (SFRXETH) as collateral.\n\nNew protocols like Lybra Finance and Pendle Finance, which are looking to leverage the liquidity provided by LSD tokens, have also become popular.\n\nAs has happened before with DeFi, newer applications will likely tap the liquidity of LSD tokens by facilitating liquidity mining of their governance tokens for early depositors.\n\nWhile these can bring decent gains for some users, these protocols could carry smart contract risks and the chance of getting rug pulled, introducing the risks that come with the higher gains that LSDfi provides.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem finds itself in the throes of a controversy surrounding the outsized footprint one of its staking pools, Lido Finance (LDO), has on the overall network.\n\n\u201cCentralization concerns around LSD\u2019s are well-founded\u201d began a tweet by founder of The Daily Gwei and independent Ethereum educator, Anthony Sassano. He added: \u201cIf my fellow Ethereans want Lido dominance to go down, then they need to create and promote better liquid staking protocols.\u201d\n\nMany of my fellow Ethereans are going to hate me for this tweet, but it needs to be tweeted. Centralization concerns around LSD's are well-founded and I agree with a lot of them but the solutions presented often leave a lot to be desired (particularly putting too much emphasis\u2026 \u2014 sassal.eth \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@sassal0x) June 1, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe current controversy surrounding the Ethereum ecosystem refers to liquid staking derivatives, or LSDs, particularly with Lido Finance.\n\nLiquid staking refers to depositing Ethereum in a protocol that then pools it with other user deposits and stakes the ETH on their behalf. In return, users get another token representing their staked position which accumulates its own rewards. In Lido\u2019s case, users receive Staked Ethereum, or stETH.\n\nThe threat at hand is the current market dominance of Lido, which currently accounts for 74% of all LSDs according to DeFi Llama. The pool contains more than 7 million ETH, worth approximately $13 billion dollars\u2014and it has grown by 12% over the past thirty days.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that centralization is easy\u201d, pseudonymous Ethereum Beacon Chain community manager Superphiz told Decrypt. He added that the current situation with Lido is risky because although [a staking provider] \u201ccan not halt the chain or prevent transactions, it is still a critical threat to the social decentralization of the chain.\u201d\n\nAnother concern are the aforementioned LSDs, derivatives which are created on top of the staked ETH. Derivatives, in finance, refer to an instrument that derives its value from another asset. They are used to further speculate on any given asset, in this case ETH.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCall to action on this likely to be when LIDO or big competitor faces gov action and starts censoring to avoid criminal charges. I\u2019ll be very impressed if ethereum community can mitigate the centralizing before that happens. \u2014 Ari Paul \u26d3\ufe0f (@AriDavidPaul) June 1, 2023\n\nAri Paul, founder of BlockTower Capital, said on Twitter the main problem with this degree of centralization is \u201cwhen Lido faces government action and starts censoring to avoid criminal charges.\u201d\n\nHis concerns echo discussion around centralization last year, before the Ethereum merge. At the time, the worry was that centralized entities would block certain transactions, like wallets that had interacted with US-sanctioned Ethereum mixer Tornado Cash.\n\nPaul added that he would be \u201cvery impressed\u201d if the Ethereum community can mitigate this centralization.\n\nBut there are further concerns, written by none other than the Ethereum Foundation itself. In a blog post, The Risks of LSD, the foundation writes that if LSD exceed consensus thresholds, they could create \u201cblock space cartels.\u201d These cartels can achieve outsized profits thanks to their coordinated maximal extractable value (MEV) extraction, block timing manipulation, and censorship.\n\nPut plainly: The bigger any one pooled staking \"cartel\" becomes, the more rewards it earns, and the greater the incentive for users to pool their funds with that provider.\n\nUnfortunately, not staking through a pool carries huge disincentives, according to Ethereum core developer and co-author of EIP-1559, Eric Conner. \"Solo staking experience is a nightmare\u201d he said, adding he doesn\u2019t blame anyone for going straight to LSDs.\n\nEveryone being champions for LSD and client diversity. I\u2019m going to be the champion that bluntly tells everyone solo staking experience is a nightmare and I don\u2019t blame anyone for just saying fuck it and going to LSDs. We have to fix the UX of solo staking! \u2014 eric.eth (@econoar) June 1, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSolo staking can be a daunting task, which is why many use platforms like Lido.\n\nIt requires 32 ETH, or approximately $60,500 dollars, plus a fair amount of technical knowledge. Maintaining a validator node requires certain pieces of hardware, an understanding of key management, and mitigating the risks of going offline because downtime could mean paying penalties.\n\nHe added that Ethereum needs to fix the UX of solo staking, thanking Dappnode for making it \u201cas easy as 1 click.\u201d The company sells \"no technical knowledge required\" hardware that people can use to set up Ethereum or Bitcoin nodes at home and maintains free open source software for a more DIY approach.\n\nConner singled them out as \u201cthe only one doing something about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to see action\u201d was Sassano\u2019s ending note on Twitter. He added that \u201ceveryone who is building an LSD or part of an LSD community this is a call to action for you - it's time to kick it into high gear and eat Lido's breakfast, lunch, and dinner (and second dinner).\u201d"

        "content": "This year, Ethereum\u2019s network officially transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm, leaving Proof-of-Work forever behind.\n\nOne of the multiple implications The Merge has had on the protocol is that there are no longer Ethereum miners. Validators secure the network now, and the path to becoming one is supposed to be tremendously simplified \u2013 deposit 32 ETH to the staking contract and run the appropriate software.\n\nBut it turns out that there\u2019s quite a queue for validators lined up, and becoming one might take some time.\n\n45 Days to Become an Ethereum Validator\n\nYou read that right \u2013 if you have ETH to spare and you want to invest in securing the network and earn rewards for this important task, you\u2019d have to wait\u2026 a lot.\n\nIt appears that becoming a validator is something so sought after that the queue keeps on increasing.\n\nData from WenMerge shows that there are 92,536 validators currently waiting to enter the network. This will take approximately 45 days to clean up.\n\nThe competition is so high, and it appears that practically nobody wants to exit. The exit queue currently consists of only 4 validators.\n\nCelsius Enters the Queue\n\nThe embattled cryptocurrency lender is part of the reason why the queue is stretched out.\n\nThroughout the past couple of days, Celsius Network has moved some $600 million worth of ETH into the staking contract and this rate shows no signs of slowing down, according to Arkham Intelligence.\n\nCelsius is making moves to stake all the ETH they currently hold, representing movements totalling almost $1B in on-chain flows. Over the past 24 hours, they have staked over $600M of ETH, with their rate of deposits showing no sign of slowing. \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/8bW3xB15UH \u2014 Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) June 2, 2023\n\nAt current prices, the above is made up of around 316K ETH added to the validator enter queue.\n\nRecall that back in April, CryptoPotato reported that leading US-based cryptocurrency exchanges \u2013 Coinbase and Gemini \u2013 joined the bid for the lender\u2019s assets."

        "content": "Tron\u2019s TRX is available on Ethereum (ETH) after leveraging BitTorrent (BTT) Bridge to gain access to the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem in the industry.\n\nIn a May 2 tweet, Tron Network founder Justin Sun said TRX was \u201cfully accessible within the Ethereum ecosystem\u201d and included the contract address for the token.\n\nTRX is Tron\u2019s Network native token and, according to CryptoSlate data, ranks among the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market cap\n\nThe BitTorrent Bridge enables fast and easy movement of assets between Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\u2013compatible blockchains and Tron.\n\nThe move will further boost TRX\u2019s liquidity and increase its use within DeFi protocols. Ethereum is the largest DeFi ecosystem, with the total value of assets locked in over 800 protocols at over $80 billion, according to DeFillama data.\n\nMeanwhile, Tron has the second-highest TVL among blockchain networks, with $5.61 billion locked on 22 protocols.\n\nCryptoSlate data shows that TRX is up 1.77% in the last 24 hours, trading at $0.07628 as of press time.\n\nTron\u2019s daily transaction hits new high\n\nOn June 1, Sun tweeted that the Tron blockchain hit a new record high amount of daily transactions as it processed nearly 11 million transactions on May 31.\n\nSun said the milestone indicated the network\u2019s growing popularity and widespread usage by the community. The crypto entrepreneur added that his team had set a new target of doubling this volume within the following year.\n\nSun said:\n\n\u201cThis increase isn\u2019t just a measure of quantity, but also a testament to the quality and efficiency of our network. The growth in transactions is expected to bolster protocol revenue, proving that TRON\u2018s fundamentals remain strong even in a challenging market.\u201d\n\nTron has been involved in several activities to increase its usage since the beginning of the year. On May 7, the network urged meme coin developers to use its ecosystems to develop their tokens while offering up to $1 million in reimbursements for trading gas fees.\n\nEarlier, the blockchain launched a $100 AI development million fund to encourage developers to create applications on its network using tools like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network has made an $800 million ether (ETH) staking move that has caused significant delays in the Ethereum validator queue. The company deposited $745 million of ETH into staking contracts in just two days, adding to the already long waiting time to deploy new validators on the Ethereum network.\n\nCelsius Ethereum Staking\n\nCelsius is reshuffling its staked ETH holdings after Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade allowed withdrawals from staking contracts. This strategic shake-up has caused the queue to stretch to 44 days, with Celsius potentially adding nearly a week of delay, according to Tom Wan of 21Shares.\n\nadvertisement\n\nPreviously, Celsius held 460,000 ETH ($870 million) staked with Lido Finance and deployed 160,000 tokens ($300 million) in their own staking pool.\n\nCoinGape reported that it has reportedly withdrawn 428,000 staked Ethereum (stETH) valued at $780 million.\n\nBankrupt Crypto Lender Case\n\nThe reshuffling of staked assets coincides with Celsius\u2019 ongoing efforts to restructure following a bankruptcy protection filing in July. The company faced liquidity issues due to plummeting cryptocurrency prices and a surge in user withdrawals.\n\nRecently, the U.S. bankruptcy court auctioned off Celsius to Fahrenheit, an investment group backed by Arrington Capital, which will take over the lender\u2019s assets, including institutional loan portfolio, staked cryptocurrencies, and crypto mining units.\n\nRead Former Celsius CEO\u2019s 1B Plan\u2026\n\nCelsius Network on May 25 announced the completion of the auction process to transfer the assets to crypto consortium Fahrenheit LLC.\n\nEven after these transfers, Celsius\u2019 wallets still hold around $109 million worth of ETH, according to data from Arkham. However, this influx of staking activity has further strained the Ethereum validator queue, which was already burdened with increased demand since the activation of the Shanghai upgrade on April 12.\n\nDeposits have exceeded withdrawals by nearly $5.5 billion, leaving new participants with a month-long wait to set up validators, according to blockchain intelligence firm Nansen."

        "title": "Ethereum gas fees explained - OKX",
        "content": "As the world moves to decentralized finance (DeFi), more people are utilizing the Ethereum network, making Ethereum's gas fees a topic of discussion in the WEB 3 space. The utility of Ethereum's ecosystem has resulted in higher gas fees and increased congestion on the network.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum gas fees\n\nGas is the measuring unit for the computational effort required to execute specific operations on the Ethereum network. In the Ethereum ecosystem, stakers are incentivized to maintain the network with tasks such as validating transactions.\n\nThe rewards for participating and contributing to the Ethereum network are paid in gas fees. To avoid accidental loops or other computational waste, the Ethereum network has set a limit of steps of code execution. This fundamental unit of computation is referred to as \u00a8gas\u00a8.\n\nSince cryptocurrency transactions require computational resources, every transaction requires a fee. Since there are only a limited number of participants, the network can approve a limited amount of transactions. Transactors bid with higher gas limits to prioritize their transactions.\n\nAs a result, it provides a higher incentive to validators. Gas fees also act as a security mechanism for the network. It prevents congestion caused by malicious actors or spam network transactions. They're required to maintain the quality of transactions on the network.\n\nThe importance of gas limits\n\nGas limits are hard caps on user fees applied to approve Ethereum based functions like sending Ether from one wallet to another or executing smart contracts. It refers to the maximum capacity a wallet allows to charge for fees on the network. As a security layer, it prevents transactions from overcharging due to congestion or anomalies.\n\nImportant terms to understand before setting gas limits\n\nBase fees\n\nEthereum transactions are applied to blocks to verify them. Every block has a base fee, which is the minimum cost of submitting transactions. The gas fees added to a transaction must at least equal the base fee for it to get included in the block.\n\nTip/Priority fees\n\nIn addition to base fees, a tip or a priority fee for validators can be added to the gas fees. These fees are non-mandatory extra costs added by users to fasten the verification process. Tips encourage miners to prioritize transactions on the block faster.\n\nMax fees\n\nMax fees refer to Max-Fee-Per-Gas, which are optional perimeters for gas limits. Max fees are the maximum limit users are willing to spend on gas fees. The max fee should exceed the total base fee and priority fee. The difference between the both gets refunded to the user.\n\nCalculating fees\n\nApplications running Ethereum transactions can upgrade to automate transaction fees. The suggested fees include the base fee and tips predicted by the system. This makes it easier for users to execute transactions without the complexity of calculating the required fees.\n\nGas Prices\n\nEthereum gas prices have fluctuated with its utility and the innovation of dApps (decentralized applications) building on top of the network. There are multiple factors thyat affect gas fees:\n\nFunction complexity:\n\nThe complexity of the function submitted on the Ethereum network affects the validation time. The amount of effort contributed by validators to execute the task on the network determines the initial fee charge. Multiple functionalities increase complication, requiring more computational power and higher gas fees.\n\nTransaction Urgency:\n\nThe increased utility of Ethereum-based dApps has created an urgency for validation. Layer - 2 solutions on the network help to resolve this. Nevertheless, the Ethereum blockchain still settles the transaction.\n\nNetwork status:\n\nThe Ethereum network has limited validators, and low TPS (transactions-per-second) makes it prone to congestion during busy periods. The system is maintained by gas fees, which settle urgent transactions with higher priority fees first. The network status determines gas prices, as a congested network repeatedly settles bids with higher tips before picking up transactions with base fees or no tips.\n\nHow is Ethereum gas fees calculated?\n\nGas fees are made up of two components: the gas price and the gas limit. When a user initiates a transaction on the Ethereum network, they specify the amount of gas they are willing to pay for its execution. The maximum amount the user is willing to spend is the gas limit, and the base fee rate is how much it'll cost per unit of gas.\n\nThe total gas fees can be calculated using the below formula.\n\nGas fees = Gas limit x (Base fee + Tip).\n\nThe total gas fee for a transaction can be calculated by multiplying the gas limit by the sum of the base fee and tip fee (if applied). It considers the minimum fee cost, i.e., the base fee and the priority fee or tips added to the transaction to make it faster.\n\ne.g., if a transaction has a gas limit of 100,000 and a gas price of 50 Gwei (0.000000050 ETH), the total gas fee would be 0.005 ETH (100,000 * 0.000000050).\n\nEven with correct calculations, the final gas fee can vary. The base fee fluctuates, and the price can change depending on the demand of the network. If the network is congested, transactions with higher gas fees will be prioritized. To execute urgent transactions, users increase the gas price to prioritize their transaction.\n\nWays to reduce Ethereum gas fees\n\nEthereum's current limitations on speed have been the core reason for network congestion. The upcoming scalability upgrades will eventually address the high gas fee issues; meanwhile, there are a few ways to reduce it.\n\nMonitoring demand and network congestions\n\nUsers can monitor the Ethereum network to understand its status. When demand is high, the network gets congested. One can check pending confirmed transactions on Etherscan or mempools before carrying out transactions.\n\nSync timings\n\nEthereum gas prices fluctuate aligned with the volatility of its underlying asset Ethereum. One can study Ethereum's price action and events to estimate when gas fees will be their lowest.\n\nExplore dApps\n\nUtilize the benefits of dApps built on Ethereum that provide offers on transacting and participating in their ecosystem. These decentralized applications offer lower entry barriers for newer traders by eliminating high gas fees and providing rebate offers.\n\nGas tokens\n\nUsers can earn ETH and create gas tokens by removing storage variables on the blockchain. When gas fees are low, one can mine gas tokens and utilize them later to pay gas fees or exchange them for Ethereum.\n\nLayer-2 solutions\n\nLayer-2 solutions on the Ethereum network are alternate solutions to deal with high gas fees. These complementary platforms enable users to scale up their transactions, zk-roll ups, and side chains, which results in lower gas fees and faster transaction settlement times.\n\nFuture of ETH gas fees\n\nHigh gas fees occur during high levels of congestion on the Ethereum blockchain. Executing functions on Ethereum's network consumes computational power and requires gas fees to incentive validators to carry out the task.\n\nThe fees are used to pay for calculations, storing or manipulating data, or transferring tokens; each consumes different amounts of \"gas\" units. With the growing complexity of dApp functionalities, a smart contract's operations also increase as each transaction consumes more space in a limited-sized block.\n\nUpgrades to introduce improvements and advancement in Ethereum's infrastructure may address rising ETH gas prices and congestion on the network.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow do I choose my ETH gas limit?\n\nUsers can calculate the appropriate required gas limit by monitoring the base fee on Etherscan's gas tracker.\n\nWhy is the ETH gas limit so high?\n\nDue to increased network activity, ETH gas limits are set high. Users can set gas limits as per requirements. Non-utilized gas fees are refunded via EVM.\n\nHow much is one gwei?\n\n1 Gwei equals 0.000000001 ETH, which is one-billionth of an Ethereum.\n\nHow can I avoid high ETH gas fees?\n\nUsers can monitor network congestion and transaction timings before placing execution orders. Exploring offers on dApps, and using Layer-2 solutions can also help avoid high ETH gas fees.\n\nHow is the gas fee calculated?\n\nThe total gas fee for a transaction can be calculated by multiplying the gas limit by the sum of the base fee and tip fee (if applied). The total gas fees can be calculated using the formula: Gas fees = Gas limit x (Base fee + tip)."

The news is a big deal for Tron, whose ecosystem had been relatively close since its inception.\n\nThe bridge to Ethereum implies that TRX can now find direct applications on several Ethereum-based DeFi platforms and dApps. The Ethereum protocol is arguably the biggest and more robust hub for DeFi innovations, with many protocols developing compatibility through the Ethereum Virtual Machine Engine (EVM).\n\nThough Tron is bridging to Ethereum using an entirely different route, the underlying purpose will be to tap into the deep liquidity of the latter blockchain protocol. This move has a huge upside for TRX, whose price has largely lagged behind its peers over the past few years.\n\nAt the time of writing, Tron was changing hands at a price of $0.07647, up by 2.22% over the past 24 hours.\n\nHigh affinity for Ethereum\n\nWhile Justin Sun is not making much fuss about the new interoperability Tron has just achieved with Ethereum, other protocols saw it as a very big deal.\n\nSince the start of the year, protocols like Filecoin and EOS have launched their EVM compatible outfits, as both aimed at capitalizing on the robust ecosystem of Ethereum, to the benefits of their users.\n\nThere are multiple benefits in developing EVM compatibility with Ethereum as the connecting blockchain can also access additional protocols beyond just Ethereum with similar compatibility."

        "title": "Web3 adds semantic layer to Ethereum for a decentralized society - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Focusing too much on the tokenization of assets instead of encoding social relationships of trust was a key complaint regarding the current state of Web3 that found a clear voice in a mid-2022 paper published by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin along with E. Glen Weyl and Puja Ohlhaver. Titled \u201cDecentralized Society: Finding Web3's Soul,\u201d the paper explores soulbound tokens (SBTs), a unique form of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) that represent the credentials of a user.\n\nNontransferable by design, SBTs have the potential to play a key role in building a decentralized society, according to the authors. However, while an SBT verifies an individual\u2019s credentials, affiliations and commitments, it lacks the social context required for a decentralized society \u2014 representing only half the answer by itself.\n\nDecentralized social graphs act as a bridge between SBTs and society by representing each user\u2019s interconnected web of relationships across social networks. Combined with publicly verifiable SBTs, decentralized social graphs present an opportunity to empower users with greater control over their online identities while addressing privacy, security and ownership concerns widespread by centralized social networks.\n\nDecentralized Web3 society\n\nSocial media became a major use case for the internet during the 2010s, with the user base reaching 4.7 billion around the globe, according to reports from 2022. Onboarding even a fraction of the Web2 user base to Web3 would expand the blockchain and crypto ecosystem by a significant margin.\n\nSocial networks can benefit from the openness and decentralization of blockchain technology to give control and sovereignty back to users. However, while it\u2019s relatively easy to integrate blockchain into one social network, people rarely use just one social media platform. In fact, according to research, users spend time on over six different social networks on average. Since blockchain is yet to have something like the HTTP protocol of the web or OAuth for social networks, interoperability comes forth as a major challenge.\n\nWeb3 startups are now racing to find the ideal balance between interoperability, privacy and user-centric data ownership to onboard the next billion people to a decentralized society. To enable users to create an online identity with a social context, Relation Labs, a Hong Kong-based Web3 company backed by the digital asset financial services group HashKey, developed Semantic SBTs, also known as EIP-6239, on Ethereum.\n\nThe \u201csemantic layer\u201d on SBTs enables machines to understand complex actions in a subject/predicate/object manner. When a person follows another on Twitter, the machine can grasp this by defining the follower as the subject, the act of following as the predicate, and the user who gets followed as the object. Coupled with the social connections between people, semantics make it possible for machines or algorithms to map the interconnected relation map of society.\n\nSimilarly, Semantic SBT captures the social information including connections, endorsements or network contributions linked to a person\u2019s wallet address either with or without a profile name to represent an individual\u2019s identity with a social context as an asset. These social assets utilize the core principles of blockchain \u2014 decentralization, immutability and transparency \u2014 to give Web3 users control over their social data and interactions.\n\nHow a decentralized social graph operates across Web3. Source: Relation Labs\n\nUsing the RDF data standard of the World Wide Web Consortium for better interoperability, Relation Labs enable seamless encoding and decoding of social data with other decentralized applications (DApps) and platforms. This helps users interact with their social graph and decentralized identity across different services. The high level of interoperability enables Web3 users to leverage their social connections and identity seamlessly across different applications, with the key to access in the user\u2019s hands.\n\nAI meets decentralized identity\n\nAs a decentralized social graph protocol, Relation Labs lays the foundation of social DApps and communities with a relation-based account system and decentralized data layer. Using the customizable privacy and interoperability features of the Relation protocol as a basis, the Web3 ecosystem can build complex and linked data structures.\n\nTo demonstrate how the integration of decentralized social graphs and social identity would benefit the Web3 space, developers launched Relation ONE, a Web3-native chat plugin. Users can chat with each other in NFT marketplaces, DAOs or communities by only sharing their wallet address, thus making pseudonymous chatting over an NFT for buyers and sellers possible. Relation ONE works with multiple wallets, including Metamask, Binance Wallet and WalletConnect, showcasing the interoperability of the protocol.\n\nRelation leverages artificial intelligence (AI) on top of social graphs and identity data to more efficiently analyze user preferences, behaviors and social connections. AI makes it possible to create more personalized user experiences by utilizing the data from decentralized identities. With smart and automated privacy controls that take a cue from user behavior, AI also enhances data privacy and control. Transactional data also helps AI to patterns and detect potentially fraudulent activity. Using Relation Labs\u2019 AI tools, DApps can build tailored user interfaces, identify reputable users and automate content moderation processes.\n\n\u201cIntegrating the power of social identity, structured social data and AI, we\u2019re revolutionizing the ecosystem,\u201d said Jessica Chang, founder of Relation Labs. \u201cUsers can discover a personalized world where trust is nurtured, content is moderated with precision and recommendations bring serendipitous connections,\u201d she added, calling all Web3 users to join a future \u201cwhere social experiences are intelligent, secure and tailored for each user.\u201d\n\nBy combining social graphs, decentralized identity and AI, Relation attracted over 300,000 registered users, mainly from Asia countries, the United States and Russia, with 40,000 average daily active users. The decentralized social graph protocol supports 17 wallets and over 150 Web3 and NFT communities. Aside from Chang, who is a researcher at the National University of Singapore and Imperial College London, majoring in graph research, Relation Labs has former Amazon architect Yann Ren as chief technology officer.\n\nBy adding a semantic layer to soulbound tokens, Relation Labs aims to shift the paradigm from tokenization to a trust-based, socially-interconnected web of relationships for Web3. Enhanced with AI capabilities, the decentralized social graphs would provide a better understanding of real-life human relations by machines and algorithms, resulting in a pathway forward to the decentrealized society envisioned by Vitalik Buterin and co. in their original SBT paper. The Relation Labs team will continue to develop its social graph protocol to help users authenticate their online presence and engage in social interactions with increased security and privacy.\n\nLearn more about Relation Labs"

According to one of his May tweets, he believes these two digital platforms to be \"the ultimate crypto power play.\" On May 10, he tweeted that he had been buying more Cardano and building on Bitcoin.\n\nCardano ecosystem has been expanding recently, as more and more assets (cryptocurrencies, NFTs, dApps) have been launched on this proof-of-stake blockchain created by an Ethereum co-founder, mathematician Charles Hoskinson.\n\nCardano also already has meme coins, which is a recent trend started thanks to Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin. The most popular of them is Snek, which has been listed on several major exchanges recently and has seen major price surges.\n\nTransaction fees on Cardano are also much lower than those on Ethereum. Even though recently Cardano fees reached a new high of $1.76 million in total, marking a rise in its network activity, fees on Ethereum surged even higher \u2014 to $9.16 million.\n\nBesides, Cardano's staking mechanism is very much different to that of Ethereum and allows the withdrawal of funds at any time. Actually, ADA gets staked without even leaving holders' wallets. When Ethereum introduced staking on Beacon Chain a few years ago, those Ethers were locked until early April this year when another update Shapella was introduced (a combination of two upgrades, Shanghai and Capella)."

The $10,000 mark, which some analysts saw as early as 2021, should be just around the corner. But how high could the Ethereum price rise at the top of the bear market? Let\u2019s analyze in this Ethereum price prediction article!\n\nHow did Ethereum Perform in the last few weeks?\n\nThe Ethereum price has seen more of a sideways movement in the last few weeks. The year 2023 started with a strong increase. At the turn of the year, the ETH rate was still below $1,200. After the rise of the first weeks of the new year, the ETH price rose by almost 50% to $1,700.\n\nAfter a brief crash at the beginning of March, the Ethereum price rose sharply again and saw the breakthrough above the $2,000 mark in April. After peaking at $2,100, the price has fallen back below $2,000 in recent weeks. The ETH price recently moved between 1,800 and 1,900 dollars.\n\nHow much can the ETH price rise in the bull market?\n\nThe Ethereum price was able to see a significant increase again in 2023. However, the price is still well below the all-time high of $4,800 from 2021. But after the Bitcoin Halving in April next year, the new bull market should start, in which the Ethereum price could also rise massively again.\n\nIn the last bull market, the ETH price was also able to rise extremely sharply. At the lowest point of the previous bear market, the Ethereum price was still 80 dollars. From there, the price was able to rally to $4,800, a 60-fold increase.\n\nIn bull markets, altcoins such as Ethereum usually see larger percentage increases than the Bitcoin price. However, the price increases of Bitcoin and Ethereum have also converged in recent years.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Can Ethereum reach $20,000?\n\nBased on this experience, the Ethereum price can still rise very sharply in the coming months until the bull market. The low of the last few months was slightly below the $1,000 mark. Therefore, a rise by a factor of 10 to $10,000 in the coming bull market should be feasible.\n\nAn increase by a factor of 60 will very likely not happen again. But a 20x rally from the bear market lows to the next all-time bull market high definitely seems possible. An Ethereum price of $20,000 in the next bull market therefore seems quite likely.\n\nDo you want to trade Ethereum?

        "content": "Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain, has announced that the Tron network\u2019s native asset, TRX, can now be fully accessed on Ethereum (ETH), the largest altcoin network in the cryptocurrency industry. This has been made possible through the BitTorrent Bridge, which allows for seamless interoperability between the two blockchains.\n\nBitTorrent Bridge Paves The Way To Ethereum Integration\n\nInteroperability in the context of blockchain refers to the ability of different blockchains to communicate and exchange information with each other seamlessly. In this case, the BitTorrent Bridge enables Tron\u2019s native asset, TRX, to be transferred and accessed on the Ethereum network, and vice versa.\n\nRelated Reading: Litecoin Breaks $95 As Whale Transactions Spike\n\nThis means that TRX holders can now access the larger Decentralized Finance (DeFi) market and decentralized applications (dapps) available on Ethereum, while Ethereum users can now access TRX and its associated dApps on the Tron network. The BitTorrent Bridge acts as an intermediary between the two blockchains, facilitating the transfer of assets and data in a secure and decentralized manner.\n\nThe move is a significant development for the Tron ecosystem, which is currently the second-largest DeFi ecosystem with over $5.6 billion in total value locked and more than 2.9 million active users, according to DeFiLlama data.\n\nJustin Sun\u2019s tweet regarding the Ethereum expansion via BitTorrent Bridge has already had a positive impact on TRX\u2019s price, with the asset jumping by 2% following the announcement. This further demonstrates the potential for Tron to expand its reach and appeal to a wider audience in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nWith Tron\u2019s expansion to Ethereum, the cryptocurrency industry continues to see the growing importance of interoperability between different blockchains. As more projects explore the potential of cross-chain functionality, the industry is likely to see further development and innovation in the coming years.\n\nTRON Sets New Daily Transaction Record\n\nDespite the challenges faced by the cryptocurrency industry in recent months, TRON has continued to perform strongly, defying expectations and posting impressive growth. According to a Twitter thread by Justin Sun, the network hit a new record high in daily transactions, processing over 10 million transactions in a single day.\n\nFurthermore, Sun notes that the robust performance of the TRON network is a result of its quality and efficiency, as well as its ability to continuously improve and deliver concrete results.\n\nLooking ahead, TRON has set an ambitious target for the year, aiming to double its transaction volume. Sun emphasizes that this increase is not just a measure of quantity, but also a reflection of the network\u2019s ability to maintain its strong fundamentals and generate revenue even in a challenging market.\n\nMoreover, the growth in TRON\u2019s transaction volume is expected to further bolster protocol revenue and demonstrate the strength of the TRON ecosystem. As the cryptocurrency industry continues to evolve and face new challenges, TRON is positioning itself as a leader in the space by focusing on innovation, efficiency, and delivering results.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum staking increased significantly after the Shanghai upgrade on April 12, with deposits outpacing withdrawals. According to Etherscan, ETH staking deposits on the Beacon Chain reached another all-time high, with 24.17 million ETH worth $46.03 billion at a price of $1903 as of June 3.\n\nMoreover, total ETH deposits post-Shanghai upgrade is 6 million ETH, while total withdrawals accounts for only 3 million, as per Nansen deposit contract data.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMoreover, Ethereum (ETH) balance on the crypto exchanges has reached a new five-year low. CryptoQuant data indicates that the total amount of ETH held in crypto exchanges dropped to critical levels. ETH on exchanges now stands at almost 16 million, reaching levels not recorded since July 2018. In fact, it has declined 50% since the all-time high.\n\nInterestingly, Nansen data indicates ETH locked has also reached an all-time high of 22.4 million. ETH locked means all ETH that is out of circulation, it includes ETH staked on the Beacon Chain, ETH deposited to the Beacon contract but not validating yet, and rewards on the Beacon chain.\n\nTypically, an increase in the amount of ETH locked and staking led to a decrease in the overall supply of Ethereum tokens available in the market. The decrease in ETH will cause prices to rally higher.\n\nAlso Read: Celsius $800M ETH Staking Extends Ethereum Queue\n\nEthereum Realized Price At 6-Month High\n\nAs a result of low ETH supply in the market, Ethereum realized price has hit a 6-month high of $1470. It can be interpreted as the on-chain support for ETH price. The price has now less probability of falling below the level, making institutional investors more inclined to Ethereum than Bitcoin.\n\nAs per CoinGape Markets, ETH price can hit $2500 due to the bullish morning star candlestick pattern formed after ETH breakout above the 2-month resistance trendline. In addition, a bullish breakout from the wedge pattern has set the Ethereum price on a recovery track.\n\nETH price currently trades above $1900, up 5% upside in a week. It indicates that investors are buying on dips in anticipation of a major upcoming rally.\n\nAlso Read: Terra Classic Officially Releases Its Biggest v2.1.0 Parity Upgrade Proposal"

This remarkable shift can be attributed to the U.S. Congress\u2019s decision on 1 June, wherein they opted to suspend the country\u2019s debt ceiling.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum below traditional stocks\n\nThe United States Congress has successfully endorsed an agreement that increases the government\u2019s borrowing limit to avert the potential calamity of defaulting on debt repayments. The Senate passed the deal on 1 June, and the House of Representatives approved it the day before.\n\nOnce signed into law by President Joe Biden, this agreement will enable the federal government to borrow funds until after the next presidential election in November 2024.\n\nThe trend of cryptos and equities\n\nFascinating insights from Santiment revealed that the decision to raise the debt ceiling profoundly impacted the price movements of various assets.\n\nTraditional stocks, as exemplified by the S&P 500, witnessed a remarkable surge, reaching their highest level since August. Moreover, the price of gold also experienced an upward lift, as indicated by the chart.\n\nAs of this writing, the S&P 500 price had surpassed the $4000 mark, while gold exceeded $1,900.\n\nOn the other hand, the chart demonstrated that cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, were trailing behind equities. They were experiencing a comparatively lower performance than traditional stocks, showing a weak correlation.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum price trend\n\nBitcoin has recently witnessed a series of fluctuations, oscillating between highs and lows but consistently remaining below the $30,000 price threshold. As of this writing, Bitcoin was trading at approximately $27,160, showcasing a modest gain of over 1%.\n\nIt was exhibiting a bearish trend at press time, as indicated by its Relative Strength Index (RSI) on a daily timeframe. Nevertheless, there was a noticeable uptrend in its RSI line, thanks to a price increase.\n\nIs your portfolio green?

        "title": "MetaMask Wallet Review: Is MetaMask A Good Wallet? - Milk Road",
        "content": "Expert Review: MetaMask Wallet In Transactions\n\nCrypto wallets are serious business, but MetaMask makes it fun. When you first install the extension, the fox icon follows your cursor movements. The well-known fox icon represents an anonymous identity. Your wallet becomes your sign-in for web3 apps rather than a username and password.\n\nI tested the MetaMask extension as well as the mobile app, looking for undiscovered features and evaluating everyday usability.\n\nMetaMask Wallet Chrome Extension Review\n\nWallet\n\nSending crypto on MetaMask is intuitive. To receive crypto, you\u2019ll need to copy the wallet address to the clipboard or click on the three-dot menu to get a scannable QR code from the account details screen.\n\nWhen sending crypto using the extension, I was offered the option to change the gas fee. Higher fees typically provide faster transfers. Lower-fee transactions can get stuck for a while if the network is busy.\n\nI did encounter one problem with the wallet: A token I sent to the wallet wasn\u2019t detected. I had to add the token manually, which can be done from the home screen (import tokens).\n\nBuying Crypto\n\nMetaMask lets you buy crypto through several providers:\n\nCoinbase Pay (not available on Polygon)\n\nMoonPay\n\nTransak\n\nCoinbase Pay connects your Coinbase account and some (but not all) payment methods you have saved in Coinbase. You can send ETH from your Coinbase exchange wallet or buy ETH with your bank account or cash you have on the exchange. I didn\u2019t find an option to send other tokens, just ETH.\n\nMoonPay, another crypto provider, offers six tokens, including ETH and three stablecoins. The minimum purchase is $30 with a $3.99 minimum fee.\n\nSwaps\n\nMetaMask provides a swap feature, which works like an aggregator and compares exchange rates from liquidity pools, including:\n\nUniswap\n\n1inch\n\nParaSwap\n\nand others\n\nSwap fees are 0.875% and help fund MetaMask\u2019s development.\n\ndApp Connections\n\nMetaMask\u2019s Chrome extension doesn\u2019t include an app browser, but it runs in a browser \u2013 so everything is just a new tab away.\n\nSupport\n\nMetaMask offers support through two channels: a chatbot and a community support forum.\n\nThe chatbot was able to point me in the right direction but didn\u2019t answer the question directly. The linked article I selected from the suggested list didn\u2019t answer the question directly either but was helpful in that it discussed using trusted bridges.\n\nIf the chatbot can\u2019t help, you\u2019ll be able to speak with an agent. In my case, I spoke with Danny, who was very helpful and did answer my question: To bridge tokens from one block to another, you can connect your MetaMask wallet to the portfolio site dApp linked on the main page of the extension.\n\nPortfolio Site\n\nAn easily overlooked link on the main page of MetaMask\u2019s extension points to the portfolio site dApp, from which you can see an overview of your assets on all blockchains you added to MetaMask. (Assets locked in smart contracts won\u2019t show, however.)\n\nFrom the dApp, you can also make swaps or use a bridge to move assets from one blockchain to another. A watchlist lets you track token prices.\n\nI used the bridge, still marked as Beta, to move MATIC from the Ethereum blockchain to Polygon.\n\nThe actual cost of the transaction was $1.33 compared to the quoted fee of $8.53. Thanks, MetaMask!\n\nMetaMask Wallet Mobile App Review\n\nMetaMask ran poorly at startup on my octa-core Android phone. Once up and running, the app worked smoothly.\n\nThe mobile app supports fingerprint authentication or password authentication for login, protecting your crypto from phone thieves and snooping phone fiddlers.\n\nI synced the mobile wallet with the Chrome extension using the 12-word recovery phrase to explore its features.\n\nWallet\n\nSending and receiving worked as expected on mobile. However, I didn\u2019t find a setting to enable adjustable gas fees like on the extension.\n\nSwitching networks just takes a click but can only be done from the network listing on the wallet home screen. This is something to keep in mind if you wander off to explore dApps on a network not supported by the dApp (like I did).\n\nBuying Crypto\n\nMetaMask mobile offered fewer options for buying compared to the extension. Notably, Coinbase Pay was missing in my region.\n\nOther options include:\n\nMoonPay\n\nTransak\n\ndApp Browser\n\nConnecting blockchain apps with crypto wallets can be a challenge on mobile devices, so MetaMask includes a dApp browser. Coinbase wallet offers a similar feature.\n\nApps are sorted by category, including decentralized finance, decentralized exchanges, collectibles, etc.\n\nPopular dApp Browser Apps:\n\nUsing the MetaMask app browser, I stopped by Uniswap to check on my liquidity pool. Uniswap didn\u2019t see my MetaMask Polygon wallet, instead suggesting I connect with my Coinbase wallet.\n\nI\u2019ll stick to the MetaMask browser extension for dApps, but the mobile app is great for sending and receiving on the go.\n\nWhat Is MetaMask Wallet?\n\nMetaMask is a DeFi cryptocurrency wallet initially built by ConsenSys for the Ethereum network. Since its inception in 2016, support for additional networks has been added, including Polygon, BNB Smart Chain, Avalanche C-Chain, and many others \u2013 all just a click away.\n\nThe growth of decentralized applications (dApps) helps fuel MetaMask\u2019s popularity; ETH-compatible dApps commonly offer MetaMask as the top option to connect a wallet.\n\nWith decentralized apps, MetaMask acts as both a wallet and a signing key to approve smart contracts. When an app needs permission to perform actions, the app passes a request over to your wallet. MetaMask then shows you the details, prompting you to accept or reject the request.\n\nAbove, the decentralized exchange Uniswap is asking MetaMask\u2019s Chrome extension to sign a smart contract I initiated. MetaMask also provides a mobile app for Android and iOS.\n\nHow Does MetaMask Wallet Work?\n\nMetaMask is a hot wallet, meaning it\u2019s connected to the internet, and the private keys are generated on an online device. Most wallets use two keys: a public key and a private key. The latter is what lets you spend or transfer crypto and approve transactions.\n\nNothing leaves your MetaMask wallet unless the transaction is signed with the private key generated when you set up your wallet for the first time.\n\nThe private key is a long string of numbers and letters that\u2019s nearly impossible to memorize, so most wallets use a recovery phrase of 12 to 24 words that lets your wallet re-generate the private key if needed. MetaMask uses 12 words. You\u2019ll also secure your wallet with a (required) password.\n\nMetaMask uses Ethereum as the default network, but the wallet supports multiple Ethereum-compatible networks, such as Polygon and Optimism. While visible in the same wallet app, assets on each blockchain remain separate. You\u2019ll have to switch networks to access the assets on each chain.\n\nMetaMask lets you connect to popular dApps like Uniswap, the leading decentralized exchange, or games and metaverse projects like Axie Infinity or Decentraland.\n\nThe alternative to hot wallets like MetaMask is cold wallets, typically hardware wallets \u2013 devices that store your private keys offline and can connect to a computer or phone when needed. MetaMask can pair with hardware wallets like Ledger, adding an extra permission layer if an app wants to access your wallet. This step can help protect against scams and allows you to confirm each transaction on your hardware device.\n\nMetaMask provides a near-perfect solution if you\u2019re exploring the ETH-based world of crypto. But if you need to store Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Cardano, you\u2019ll need a separate wallet.\n\nMetaMask Wallet Notable Features\n\nFeature Explanation Enhanced token detection MetaMask can automatically detect new tokens added to your wallet. You can also add support for new tokens manually. Support for hardware wallets Pair MetaMask with Ledger or Trezor devices. Your hardware wallet provides a second signature for transactions. Multiple blockchain support Easily add support for Polygon or other lower-cost ETH-compatible networks. Adjustable gas fees Adjust transaction costs with a slider to match the transaction\u2019s priority. Swaps Use MetaMask\u2019s smart transactions to reduce costs when swapping tokens within the wallet app.\n\nMetaMask starts out with a simple feature set, but you can add more functionality in the settings. Enhanced token detection, additional blockchains, and a gas fee UI based on EIP-1559 are just a few clicks away.\n\nMulti-Asset Support\n\nMetaMask supports ERC-20 tokens, including the tokens listed below, as well as ERC-721 NFTs.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nTether (USDT)\n\nBinance (BNB)\n\nUniswap (UNI)\n\nAave (AAVE)\n\nChainlink (LINK)\n\nWrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)\n\nMatic (MATIC)\n\nAnd many more.\n\nMetaMask\u2019s token detection attempts to identify new tokens you add to your wallet. Most of the time, it works. You can add the token manually in the rare case where MetaMask misses one.\n\nSecurity\n\nMetaMask asks you to set up a password as a first step. After that, the wallet generates a private key and provides you with a 12-word recovery phrase so you can restore your wallet if needed. This is standard fare for hot wallets. The 12-word passphrase can also be used with other wallets, such as Coinbase wallet or Brave wallet, so guard it carefully. Anyone who finds your recovery phrase won\u2019t need MetaMask to access your wallet.\n\nI connected my MetaMask wallet to my Ledger hardware wallet, a simple process that creates up to five new accounts in your MetaMask wallet.\n\nFunds in these new accounts can only be accessed with the hardware wallet but other accounts in MetaMask won\u2019t require your hardware device.\n\nHow To Set Up Your MetaMask Wallet\n\nMetaMask offers a Chrome extension and mobile app. Here\u2019s how to set up the Chrome extension.\n\nStep 1: Download And Install MetaMask.\n\nGo to MetaMask to get the official download link for the extension. MetaMask is open-source software, so it\u2019s easy to make a copy of the app modified for nefarious purposes. Get the real thing.\n\nStep 2: Open MetaMask And Agree To The Terms.\n\nThe Chrome extension should open automatically after it\u2019s installed. You can also find the extension in the extension manager at the top right of Chrome or Chromium-based browsers.\n\nAgree to the terms to get started\n\nStep 3: Create A New Wallet.\n\nIf you\u2019re new to MetaMask, choose the option on the right to create a new wallet. You can use the (recovery phrase) option on the left to add your wallet to additional devices later.\n\nAs a first step, MetaMask will ask you to create a password (write it down). The next screen provides a helpful video explaining how MetaMask works and the role of your secret (recovery) phrase.\n\nStep 4: Write Down Your Secret Recovery Phrase.\n\nMetaMask automatically generates a 12-word recovery phrase. You\u2019ll need this phrase to use your wallet on another device or if you need to restore your wallet. Keep your recovery phrase somewhere safe. If someone finds it, they can access the funds in your wallet.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to verify the 12-word phrase in the extension.\n\nStep 5: Add Networks (If Needed) And Add Funds.\n\nMetaMask defaults to the Ethereum network. You can add networks by clicking on the Ethereum Mainnet dropdown menu.\n\nAfter adding the networks you want, you can transfer ETH-compatible tokens from another wallet or from an exchange like Coinbase. Be sure to use the correct network when making transfers and only transfer compatible tokens.\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nMetaMask offers powerful functionality in a fun-to-use browser extension with plenty of customization options available in settings. The mobile app may be better suited to simple transactions, like sending some crypto to a friend when you\u2019re splitting the cost of a pizza.\n\nHot wallets bring risks, such as bugs or hacks, that can expose your private key. But Ledger integration can make MetaMask a safer choice.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIs MetaMask Wallet Safe? MetaMask is a hot wallet, which can expose your private key due to exploits or coding bugs. However, you can pair MetaMask with a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor to add another layer of security. Is MetaMask Better Than Coinbase Wallet? Each wallet has its advantages and disadvantages. Coinbase\u2019s mobile wallet can hold Bitcoin as well as ETH tokens, whereas MetaMask is easier to use. Many people use both wallets. Does MetaMask Charge Monthly Fees? MetaMask is free to use, but some activities within the wallet come at a cost. Sending crypto or signing smart contracts both cost fees. Additionally, buying or swapping crypto in the wallet comes with fees. Why Is MetaMask So Popular? MetaMask was started in 2016, so the wallet has had a lot of time to gain acceptance and refine features. It\u2019s also easy to use, supports several ETH-compatible networks, and automatically detects new tokens in your wallet. Can I Link My Bank Account To MetaMask? When buying crypto through MetaMask, you can use your bank account in some cases. But there is no way to withdraw crypto or USD from MetaMask to your bank account.\n\nStaff Writer Eric Huffman Eric Huffman is a staff writer for MilkRoad.com.

        "content": "Jun 03, 2023 at 13:10 // Price\n\nCoin Idol Author\n\nEthereum price (ETH) is in the bullish trend zone as it moves three times closer to the resistance level of $1,920.\n\nLong-term analysis of the Ethereum price: bullish\n\nSince the price cut on May 11, the Ether price has only fluctuated between $1,750 and $1,920. The rising movement was stopped by the moving average lines. On May 28, the price of Ether rose above the moving average lines again. Before it was rejected, Ether reached a high of $1,925. After the price collapse on May 11, this was the first time the uptrend was restricted. The coin has already been rejected two other times. The largest altcoin is now sold at $1,902. If the bears fall below the moving average lines, the selling pressure on Ether will increase again. The price of Ether will fall to the lower range if it rises above the support level of $1,750. Currently, Ether is trading above the moving average lines but below the resistance level.\n\nEthereum indicator analysis\n\nEther will start to rise again when the Relative Strength Index for period 14 reaches 56. It is unlikely that Ether will climb upwards as the market is overbought. If the bears break below the moving average lines, the selling pressure on Ether will increase again. The risk associated with Ether has decreased as the stochastic on the daily chart is currently above the 80 level. Sellers are expected to emerge in the overbought zone and lower prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Indicators:\n\nKey resistance levels - $2,000 and $2,500\n\nKey support levels - $1,800 and $1,300\n\nWhat is the next direction for Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is expected to continue its movement between $1,750 and $1,920 as it faces rejection from the recent high. The largest altcoin would have continued its uptrend if it had broken the resistance level. Ether would have fallen back to the psychological ceiling of $2,000. For the time being, the largest altcoin will maintain its trend within the range.\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer.

        "title": "Lido Finance Review 2024: ETH & SOL Crypto Staking Rates - Milk Road",
        "content": "Investors have become increasingly interested in staking crypto assets as a way to generate passive income in recent months. And right now, staking as a service is so popular that the crypto-verse views it as a separate sector of the economy. Additionally, a rapid increase in this sector is widely anticipated.\n\nAccording to a JP Morgan report, the staking industry currently generates $9 billion in revenue annually on Ethereum\u2019s current proof-of-work consensus. However, after Ethereum\u2019s update to proof-of-stake protocol, that revenue is projected to increase to $40 billion by 2025.\n\nHere\u2019s where DeFi staking protocols like Lido Finance come in, allowing users to stake their tokens while still maintaining custody and liquidity. Lido Finance \u2014 a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that allows you to stake your crypto assets in a non-custodial, decentralized manner that is safe, dependable, and would typically give you better staking rewards.\n\nLido Finance Pros And Cons\n\nLido Pros\n\nHere are a few of the reasons why Lido has become the go-to staking platform for hundreds of thousands of ETH stakers.\n\nUser-Friendly\n\nLido Finance uses a simple, sleek interface for ETH holders to stake their crypto. With a few clicks, you can have your ETH staked and stETH in your wallet. Furthermore, the fee structure and transaction costs are transparent before you even connect your wallet, making it easy to choose whether or not you want to stake with Lido.\n\nLiquid stETH\n\nWhile your ether is staked and earning passive rewards on Lido, you have the equivalent in stETH (staked ETH) for use across the DeFi ecosystem. With stETH, you can provide liquidity to exchange pools on Lido or other platforms or lend it out on certain platforms.\n\nDecentralized Structure\n\nLido actively uses the DAO governance structure for its operations. Crypto enthusiasts and believers in Lido can use the LDO token to vote on proposed updates to the platform and steer the overall direction of the organization.\n\nLido Cons\n\nLido naturally has some drawbacks that you should know of if you\u2019re someone interested in generating the best returns with your staking. They include:\n\nSemi-custodial Service\n\nWe would call Lido\u2019s staking pool service at least semi-custodial since it is distributing users\u2019 ether across its validator nodes. However, stETH acts as a placeholder for a user\u2019s staked ETH, so they can exchange at any time.\n\nFees\n\nWhile staking rewards fees aren\u2019t uncommon in staking services, Lido charges 10% of staking rewards on whatever you earn. This 10% fee is split between the node operators and the protocol\u2019s treasury.\n\nTaxes\n\nDepending on your personal situation and location, the ether rewards from staking with Lido may be taxable. While tax regulations aren\u2019t Lido\u2019s fault, its decentralized finance nature means you probably won\u2019t get the tax forms needed to easily report income from staking ETH.\n\nWho Is Lido Finance Best For?\n\nLido Finance is a great option for many people who have been eyeing ETH as a way to potentially earn in crypto. Instead of buying and holding ETH in hopes that the price increases, you can stake as much or as little as you want while still using a derivative token elsewhere.\n\nCrypto investors who are new to staking and want a user-friendly platform where they can stake their ETH.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts who want to learn more about the potential of the staking-as-a-service model.\n\nInvestors who feel confident staking and who want to be able to freely move their staked ETH across different DeFi protocols.\n\nKey Features Of Lido\n\nLido has become one of the go-to choices for stakers and investors due to its industry-leading features. Some of them include:\n\nEasy Staking. By staking their assets, Lido users can earn daily staking rewards. The smallest number of tokens that users can stake is unrestricted.\n\nBy staking their assets, Lido users can earn daily staking rewards.

Although Lido doesn\u2019t have its own wallet, it does let users use some of the most well-liked ones on the market, including DeFi wallets like TrustWallet and MetaMask.\n\nCryptos Listed On Lido\n\nYou can stake more than just ether on Lido. Chains that work with Lido include the following:\n\nSolana (SOL) can be staked for stSOL . APR is around 5.5%. Your staked SOL is still functional throughout the Solana ecosystem in the interim.\n\n. Your staked SOL is still functional throughout the Solana ecosystem in the interim. Kusama (KSM) can be staked for stKSM. The APR is 21.1%. Take advantage of the daily stake rewards from your KSM. Your stKSM works in DeFi on the ecosystems of the Kusama and Moonriver.\n\nTake advantage of the daily stake rewards from your KSM. Your stKSM works in DeFi on the ecosystems of the Kusama and Moonriver. Polkadot (DOT) can be staked for stDOT. 16.5% is the average APR. Get DOT staking rewards every day. Let the Polkadot and Moonbeam ecosystems receive DeFi work from your stDOT.\n\nGet DOT staking rewards every day. Let the Polkadot and Moonbeam ecosystems receive DeFi work from your stDOT. Polygon (MATIC) can be staked for stMATIC. APR stands at 8.7%.\n\nFees For Using Lido\n\nThe DAO, node operators, and an insurance fund all receive a portion of the staking rewards, which are subject to a 10% fee by the system. After a successful vote, the DAO may alter the fee. With this fee structure, Lido staking should be more profitable than what is provided by the majority of exchange staking alternatives.\n\nFurthermore, Lido still operates on the Ethereum blockchain, so gas fees do apply, and can vary based on network traffic volume. Lido does not collect Ethereum gas fees.\n\nAlternatives To Consider\n\nLido is one of the most trusted staking-as-a-service platforms for both traders and investors. But in case you feel it\u2019s not right for you or you\u2019re looking for more centralized options, consider the following alternatives:\n\nByBit: Good For Crypto Traders Who Want To Maximize APYs\n\nByBit offers flexible staking, DeFi mining, and APYs reaching as high as 400%.\n\nKuCoin: Good For Centralized Staking\n\nKuCoin is a centralized exchange that supports dozens of cryptocurrencies, multi-staking options, high interest, and even crypto lending.\n\nNexo: Good For Long-Term Stakers\n\nNexo supports over 35 cryptocurrencies, offers compounding interest for long-term investors, and provides up to 16% in annual interest.\n\nIs Lido Right For You?\n\nWith solid fundamentals, a robust ecosystem, and a trusted community, Lido is becoming one of the go-to ETH staking platforms for traders and investors alike. If you\u2019re looking for a user-friendly platform where you can stake your ETH, earn daily rewards, and do it all while having the freedom to move your staked ETH across different DeFi protocols, Lido might be exactly what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nFinal Thoughts On Lido\n\nThe road to ETH 2.0 is merged together with DeFi by Lido, calmly situated in Ethereum\u2019s sweet spot. Lido offers users a novel way to stake ETH on Ethereum\u2019s new beacon chain while maintaining access to their ETH\u2019s value.\n\nBut even though Lido has been raising eyebrows around the DeFi world, it\u2019s one project everyone in crypto should have their eyes on. With its friendly interface, ease of use, sustainable APYs, and community of loyal supporters, it\u2019s safe to say Lido raises the stakes and is here to stay.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nCan Anyone Stake On Lido? For anyone wishing to take part, Lido has made the process of staking ETH as simple as possible. It only takes a few clicks or taps on your phone, whether you\u2019re using a desktop or a supported mobile wallet. Can I Unstake My ETH On Lido? No, any ETH that is staked on any staking service, Lido or otherwise, cannot be unstaked until the Ethereum merge, expected in late 2022. You can, however, currently exchange your stETH balance back for standard ETH. Is My Crypto Safe When Using Lido? As with any smart contract, there is a chance that Lido has a smart contract flaw or vulnerability. That being said, the Lido code is open-sourced, reviewed, and subject to a thorough bug bounty program. Throughout hundreds of user reviews, it\u2019s generally ranked as very safe. Do I Have To Pay Taxes On Crypto With Lido? Depending on your local jurisdiction, the conversion of ETH to StETH might be considered a taxable event. It\u2019s best to consult with a tax professional to understand how staking ETH on Lido may affect your taxes. Does Lido Report To The IRS? No, there\u2019s nothing to indicate that Lido reports transaction data to the IRS. Yet, any staking income you make from the platform is taxable, and you should self-report it to the IRS.\n\nContributor Vesselin Malev Vesselin Malev is a crypto blogger, agency owner, and content writer for some of the top companies in the blockchain space.

        "title": "Here's how developers aim to store crypto inside NFTs - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Developers have recently published an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) introducing a new way to use nonfungible tokens (NFTs). With this system, all NFTs can have a smart contract account, allowing them to store other NFTs or crypto tokens.\n\nCointelegraph spoke with Future Primitive\u2019s Jayden Windle and Benny Giang, the authors of EIP-6551, to explain the use cases of the proposal and its implications for the crypto space.\n\nJayden Windle and Benny Giang explain ERC-6551. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nAccording to Windle, while there are a lot of complicated workings behind the feature, the simplest way to explain it is that they are giving NFTs their own crypto wallets. He explained:\n\n\u201cThe real simple idea behind the ERC-6551 is that every NFT has a wallet. So, your NFT has a full wallet that your NFT owns. That means your NFT can own any asset on-chain, and your NFT can do anything on-chain. By giving NFTs wallets, NFTs now become users on Ethereum.\u201d\n\nWhen asked how the idea came to life, the Future Primitive developer explained that the team went down what he described as a \u201crabbit hole of experimental oddities.\u201d He shared that they were working on an NFT project where they wanted to add equipping as a mechanism. The project lets NFTs wear clothes and other accessories, which are also NFTs.\n\n\u201cWhat we realized was nothing really sets the use case that we really wanted to achieve. We really wanted to have NFTs own their own items in kind of a self-sovereign way. We really wanted to be able to do that in a way that would just work with all the existing tooling,\u201d he explained.\n\nMoreover, Windle also shared that they wanted other projects to be able to also take advantage of this new mechanism and build something that could apply to NFTs in general.\n\nPotential use cases for ERC-6551\n\nIn terms of use cases, the developer said that this could be applied to blockchain gaming and take the form of an inventory system. Furthermore, it can be used in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), where instead of the history of a DAO member being separated by an NFT and a wallet, it can be placed into the NFT itself. Airdropping assets into NFTs can also potentially increase the value of the assets.\n\nRelated: Nike NFTs to make their way into EA Sports games and its millions of fans\n\nAs the new mechanism seemingly has many possibilities, Cointelegraph asked Giang what this could mean for the crypto space. The NFT veteran said that apart from asset ownership, this can also bring social identity to NFTs, adding new functionality to buying, selling or trading NFTs. He explained:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to introduce three new actions you can pursue with the NFT. It\u2019s become, interact and use. You can become your NFT, you can interact with it, and you can use your NFT.\u201d\n\nGiang believes this will make NFTs entirely different from jpegs, becoming new internet identities. Furthermore, the Future Primitive executive explained that if artificial intelligence (AI) is employed, it can turn NFTs into fully on-chain network playable characters in blockchain-based games.\n\nGiang highlighted that ERC-6551 is already live on the Ethereum mainnet. \u201cIt\u2019s not a conceptual idea. It\u2019s not like a testnet thing. It\u2019s real,\u201d he explained, adding that it has already been applied to an NFT collection called Sapienz.\n\nNFT inception: NFTs that own NFTs inside NFTs\n\nCointelegraph asked the developers if there is a limit to how far putting NFTs inside NFTs can go. According to the duo, this can \u201cget crazy really quickly\u201d and go on infinitely. They demonstrated a family tree of NFTs within NFTs.\n\nDemonstration of an NFT family tree with NFTs being used as wallets.

        "title": "Tron debuts on Ethereum, hits 1-year high: What next? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum is the largest network for DeFi and dApps, with a TVL of $27.04 billion.\n\nThe news of the bridging pumped TRX to its highest value since May 2022.\n\nJustin Sun, founder of the TRON [TRX] blockchain, announced that the network\u2019s native token, TRX, will be fully accessible on the largest altcoin network, Ethereum [ETH].\n\nAccording to Sun, this was made possible by using the BitTorrent Bridge, a cross-chain transfer solution which facilitates movement of assets and data between blockchains.\n\nThe news of the bridging pumped TRX to its highest value since May 2022. At the time of writing, it had surged by 9.59% in the 24-hour period to be valued at $0.08356, data from CoinMarketCap revealed.\n\n#TRON (#TRX) has now expanded its reach by going live on the #Ethereum blockchain by leveraging the #BitTorrent bridge . With the contract address 0x50327c6c5a14dcade707abad2e27eb517df87ab5, #TRX is now fully accessible within the Ethereum ecosystem. \u2014 H.E. Justin Sun \u5b59\u5b87\u6668 (@justinsuntron) June 2, 2023\n\nTRX enters a new universe\n\nThe move has the potential to boost TRX\u2019s liquidity like never before. It can help TRX holders to access the wide array of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols functioning on the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nSimilarly, Ethereum users will be able to utilize the bridged TRX token to access applications on the Tron network. This addresses one of the major issues with blockchains \u2013 lack of interoperability.\n\nRecall that, Ethereum is the largest network for DeFi and dApps, with a total value locked (TVL) of a staggering $27.04 billion at press time, according to data from Artemis. On the other hand, Tron, which comes second-best in the list, held assets worth $5.55 billion.\n\nTron gets busier\n\nThe Tron network has been on a tear lately, witnessing a massive spike in network traffic. The chain hit a new record high in daily transactions, processing 11.47 million transactions on 2 June, as per Tronscan.\n\nIn the last 30 days, the average daily transaction on TRON was 8.78 million.\n\nOverall, the total number of transactions increased by 1.6% in the last month, reflecting growing demand for the proof-of-stake network.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 TRXs worth today?\n\nDeflationary trend continues\n\nWith the intention of long-term market value growth, TRON continued to apply deflationary pressure on TRX. The network removed about 17.21 million tokens out of circulation on 2 June.\n\nAs the number of new tokens produced on the network stayed mostly unchanged, the net issuance rate, or inflation rate, decreased further to -15.43 million, extending TRX\u2019s deflationary streak.\n\nWith the spike in burn activity, TRX\u2019s circulating supply contracted considerably in 2023. At the time of writing, about 90.2 billion tokens were in public hands, having shrunk nearly 2% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis."

        "title": "ChatGPT price prediction for June Tradecurve, Ethereum, and Solana - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "As the cryptocurrency market continues to captivate investors and traders worldwide, June holds promises of exciting developments for various cryptocurrencies. We turned to the innovative AI chatbot, ChatGPT as we explore the price predictions for Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), two prominent crypto tokens, as well as discuss the potential rise of Tradecurve (TCRV), which is an upcoming revolutionary trading platform currently in its presale phase. Let\u2019s begin.\n\nSummary\n\nEthereum (ETH) could see future price increases\n\nSolana (SOL) price analysis\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) may experience a faster price surge\n\n>>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum (ETH) remains a leader with its potential for growth\n\nEthereum (ETH) has been making headlines with its innovative smart contract capabilities and vast ecosystem of decentralized applications. In recent times, Ethereum has been experiencing upward price momentum, and many analysts believe this trend may continue into June.\n\nEthereum\u2019s future looks bright, given that Ethereum recently almost surpassed Visa in terms of transaction volume as it reached $3.01 trillion in transactions, while Visa sits at $3.08 trillion.\n\nAt the moment, Ethereum is trading hands at $1,904.93 with a market cap of $229B, a rise of 0.48% in the last day alone. Not only that, but the technical analysis for Ethereum also shows a bullish picture, with all moving averages and technical indicators showing strong buy signals. Although ChatGPT cannot provide precise price predictions, it stated that Ethereum could see green charts due to increased institutional interest in the token.\n\nSolana (SOL) to trade in the green\n\nSolana (SOL), another major blockchain platform, has gained attention for its high throughput and low transaction fees. With its focus on scalability and speed, Solana has positioned itself as a potential competitor to Ethereum.\n\nSolana co-founder Raj Gokal recently stated that this project is the \u201cApple of crypto.\u201d Gokal\u2019s comparison of Solana to Apple is based on the notion that similar to how Apple\u2019s ecosystem mixes many software and hardware, Solana might develop an ecosystem that smoothly integrates various apps and services.\n\nSolana has a value of $21.01 with a market cap of $8.3B, a jump of 1.74% in the past 24 hours. The trading volume of Solana has also increased by 30.57% in that same time and now sits at $340,451,357. With all technical indicators and moving averages for Solana also showing green, this token could see future price hikes when June rolls around.\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) emerges as a potential contender\n\nWhile Ethereum and Solana seem to rule the conversation due to their popularity and past success, Tradecurve (TCRV) is an emerging player in the market that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. This project, currently in Stage 3 of its presale, brings something new to the table, and as most experienced investors already know, buying in early on these projects is the best way of generating long-term gains.\n\nTradecurve will be a borderless, decentralized trading platform built on the Ethereum blockchain that will allow users from all over the globe to utilize cryptocurrency as collateral and access forex, stocks, commodities, and cryptocurrencies as trading options. The difference between Tradecurve and its peers is that it will not require any sign-up KYC checks, ensuring an utterly private trading environment where users will remain anonymous.\n\nTradecurve will cater to experienced and beginner traders, implementing features such as high leverage (500:1), subscriptions to automated & AI trading bots, a metaverse trading academy, negative balance protection, and more. These features will be powered by the platform\u2019s utility token, TCRV, which has a current resale value of just $0.015.\n\nHowever, the critical factor separating Tradecurve from Solana and Ethereum is its low market cap, which now sits at $27M as the token supply is 1.8B. Compared to the before-mentioned tokens\u2019 market cap, which numbers in the billions, Tradecurve could see substantial price growth way easier as not many new funds are needed.\n\nBecause of this, we can now understand why various market experts forecast a 50x increase for TCRV as the presale advances and a 100x surge when the token gets launched and listed on Uniswap or another major CEX.\n\nWhile its price movement in June is uncertain, Tradecurve\u2019s unique approach could position it as a noteworthy contender in the market, so sign up for its presale below.\n\nFor more information about the Tradecurve presale:\n\nClick Here For Website\n\nClick Here To Buy TCRV Presale Tokens\n\nFollow Us Twitter\n\nJoin Our Community on Telegram\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ethereum transaction volume challenges visa Tradecurve to overtake both - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has witnessed tremendous growth, with Ethereum (ETH) leading the way as one of the most widely adopted blockchain platforms. Ethereum\u2019s transaction volume has been surging, reaching new heights, and even challenging traditional payment giants like Visa.\n\nMeanwhile, emerging platforms like Tradecurve (TCRV), which is now in its presale run, are positioning themselves to overtake the titans mentioned above regarding transaction volume. Let\u2019s take a close look and find out why.\n\n>>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum (ETH) and its surging transaction volume\n\nEthereum (ETH), known for its smart contract capabilities, has become a hub for decentralized applications, NFTs, and finance projects. As the adoption of Ethereum-based applications grows, so does its transaction volume.\n\nAccording to recent figures from Coingraph, Ethereum, for instance, processed $3.01 trillion in transactions, compared to $3.08 trillion for Visa. Additionally, another report stated that in 2021, Ethereum handled 4.5 times as many transactions as Visa. This is a stunning development when we consider that Ethereum and the crypto market, in general, have been in a bear market since mid-2022.\n\nWith this knowledge, Ethereum demonstrates how blockchain technology has advanced to the point where it can compete with established competitors in the payments technology industry. Another benefit over conventional financial layers is that it has developed into a rich and diverse ecosystem with lots of space for future expansion. At the moment, Ethereum is trading hands at $1,906.19 with a market cap of $229B, a rise of 0.27% in the last day alone.\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) shows ambitions to outperform both\n\nIn this dynamic landscape, emerging platforms like Tradecurve (TCRV) aim to carve out their own space and potentially overtake Ethereum and Visa in terms of transaction volume. Tradecurve, which will be a unique, hybrid trading platform has gained attention for its unique features.\n\nTradecurve\u2019s main focus is on privacy, decentralization, and advanced technologies. Unlike traditional platforms such as Robinhood and Kraken, which require a sign-up KYC check, the decentralized platform Tradecurve will not.\n\nThis will provide a fully private trading environment where users may trade stocks, forex, cryptocurrencies, and commodities while utilizing cryptocurrency as collateral. This is a positive development because few popular trading platforms can meet the demands of people concerned about their privacy.\n\nFor those just starting their trading journey, Tradecurve will also establish a metaverse trading academy where individuals can enroll in and connect with trading professionals and learn new strategies. Those who do not have the time to learn may just copy trades from established traders by subscribing to them or even subscribe to automated & AI trading bots which will significantly improve profitability.\n\nThe key to acquiring price cuts on these subscriptions will be holding the platform\u2019s utility token, TCRV, which is now in Stage 3 of its presale and costs only $0.015. Analysts have taken notice of Tradecurve as it will capitalize off many financial markets, including the foreign exchange market, which saw a daily turnover of $7.5T per day in April 2022, according to a Bank for International Settlements report.\n\nBecause of this booming industry backing it and the fact that 40% of the 1.8B token supply is currently available, analysts forecast a 50x increase as the presale advances. At the same time, a 100x surge can be expected after its launch and a Tier-1 CEX listing.\n\nWhile the goal of overtaking Ethereum and Visa is ambitious, Tradecurve\u2019s unique approach and innovative features have the potential to resonate with crypto enthusiasts and traders alike. So follow the links below and become an early investor in what some experts believe could be a top 3 global exchange, leaving players such as Robinhood and OKX in the dust.\n\nFor more information about the Tradecurve presale:\n\nClick Here For Website\n\nClick Here To Buy TCRV Presale Tokens\n\nFollow Us Twitter\n\nJoin Our Community on Telegram\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "In the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, recent events have left investors and enthusiasts on edge. Elon Musk, the influential entrepreneur and CEO of companies like Tesla and SpaceX, issued a stark warning about the crypto market after a significant crash in the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two leading cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis article aims to examine and analyze the similarities and differences between these cryptocurrencies, with a particular focus on Dogetti, a meme coin that operates similarly to a presale, providing insights for readers looking for the next big crypto investment. Our informative and fun approach will provide news, education, and updates on the crypto market.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum \u2013 Pioneers of the Crypto World\n\nBitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, was introduced in 2009. It operates on a decentralized blockchain network and serves as a digital store of value and medium of exchange. Ethereum, launched in 2015, expanded on Bitcoin\u2019s capabilities by introducing smart contracts and enabling developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on its blockchain.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s market dominance and limited supply make it a popular choice for investors seeking a digital alternative to traditional assets. On the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s focus on programmability has led to its adoption as a platform for various decentralized applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nThe Impact of Elon Musk\u2019s Warning\n\nElon Musk\u2019s influence in the crypto market cannot be overstated. As a prominent figure with a large following, his tweets and public statements have the power to sway market sentiments. Recently, Musk expressed concerns about the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, which relies on energy-intensive processes. His tweet about Tesla suspending Bitcoin payments caused a significant price drop, highlighting the influence of external factors on cryptocurrency valuations.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced significant price declines following Musk\u2019s warning, the impact on Dogetti, a meme coin inspired by Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, was relatively limited. Dogetti, branded as \u201cThe Family,\u201d aims to create a strong and united community of holders who are rewarded through a reflection protocol. Despite its association with meme coins, Dogetti distinguishes itself by focusing on the concept of a family, fostering a unique sense of togetherness among its users and buyers.\n\nExploring Dogetti\u2019s Utility and Potential\n\nDogetti aims to help every member of its community increase their overall net worth through various forms of utility. While meme coins often lack real-world applications, Dogetti sets itself apart by emphasizing its utility functions. These functions could include features such as staking, governance rights, and partnerships with external platforms, ultimately providing value and benefits to the Dogetti family.\n\nThe recent crypto market crash led by Elon Musk\u2019s warning has emphasized the importance of careful consideration when choosing cryptocurrencies. Amidst the fluctuations, Dogetti has proven its resilience whereas Ethereum and Bitcoin faced significant fluctuations.\n\nWith a focus on utility and tangible benefits like staking and governance rights, Dogetti offers long-term growth potential. As investors, it\u2019s crucial to evaluate projects based on their own merits rather than relying solely on external influencers like Elon Musk.\n\nTo explore promising opportunities in the crypto market and join the vibrant Dogetti family, visit our website.\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

This article will explore and compare the involvement of three prominent players in the NFT space: Dogetti, Ethereum, and Solana.\n\nWith a particular focus on Dogetti\u2019s innovative NFT collection, we will examine the similarities and differences between these companies and their impact on the growing popularity and adoption of NFTs.

The main goal of the Dogetti project is to increase the net worth of every member of the family, ensuring shared success.\n\nOne of the core aspects of Dogetti\u2019s project lies in its utility through NFTs. These unique digital assets allow buyers to mint their very own Dogetti pet or companion, creating a connection and personalization within the community. Additionally, Dogetti has plans for regular NFT drops, providing opportunities for buyers to collect, trade, and sell these digital assets. This innovative approach has captivated investors looking for the next big crypto investment with utility.\n\nEthereum \u2013 The Foundation of the NFT Market\n\nWhen it comes to NFTs, Ethereum has been at the forefront of this emerging market. As the world\u2019s leading smart contract platform, Ethereum offers a robust infrastructure for creating and trading NFTs. Its extensive network of developers and users has contributed to the platform\u2019s dominance in the NFT space.\n\nEthereum\u2019s success in the NFT market can be attributed to its versatility and flexibility. It allows creators to mint and sell NFTs easily, offering a wide range of possibilities for artists, musicians, and content creators. Ethereum\u2019s compatibility with various wallets and marketplaces has further boosted its popularity, providing a seamless user experience for NFT enthusiasts.\n\nSolana \u2013 Scaling New Heights in the NFT Landscape\n\nSolana, a high-performance blockchain platform, has emerged as a strong contender in the NFT realm. Built for scalability and speed, Solana addresses some of the challenges faced by Ethereum, such as high transaction fees and network congestion. This has attracted artists and collectors who seek a more efficient and cost-effective solution for minting and trading NFTs.\n\nSolana\u2019s commitment to scalability has positioned it as a formidable competitor in the NFT market. Its fast transaction processing and low fees offer a seamless experience for NFT enthusiasts, attracting attention from both creators and investors. As Solana continues to gain momentum, it presents itself as a viable alternative to Ethereum in the realm of NFTs.\n\nIn the world of NFTs, Dogetti, Ethereum, and Solana have each made their mark in unique ways. Dogetti\u2019s innovative NFT collection, coupled with its meme coin identity and strong community, has captured the attention of investors looking for utility and a sense of belonging. Ethereum, as the pioneer in the NFT space, provides a robust and versatile platform for creators and collectors alike. Finally, Solana\u2019s focus on scalability and efficiency offers a compelling alternative to Ethereum\u2019s network limitations.\n\nAs the popularity and adoption of NFTs continue to soar, each brings its own strengths and opportunities to the table.
