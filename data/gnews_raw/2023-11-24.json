        "title": "Ethereum stakers 'terrified' of slashing. Company coalition looks to make it nearly impossible - DLNews",
        "content": "Slashing is a constant concern for Ethereum staking providers.\n\nCompany Cubist wants to use abstraction to prevent accidental slashing.\n\nDoing so skirts a fine line between keeping blockchains secure and making sure stakers are not unfairly punished.\n\nBitcoin Suisse, a company that provides staking services for institutional clients, encountered a serious problem earlier this month \u2014 a problem that unsettles other Ethereum stakers as well.\n\nIts newly deployed Ethereum validators \u2014 software that helps process transactions and secure the network in return for newly minted Ether \u2014 began getting \u201cslashed,\u201d a term that refers to taking some Ether from validators who don\u2019t publish the correct data to the Ethereum network.\n\nOver the course of almost two hours, nearly 100 of the firm\u2019s validators were knocked offline and fined one Ether each \u2014 an almost $200,000 loss at current prices \u2014 for trying to publish incorrect data.\n\nBitcoin Suisse did not immediately return DL News\u2019 request for comment.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nWhile slashing exists to punish people who try to attack or cheat Ethereum\u2019s validation system, it more commonly happens because of code bugs or human error.\n\nSince Ethereum started allowing users to stake in 2020, validators on the network have been slashed 400 times, per beaconcha.in data.\n\nWhile the financial damage caused by slashing on Ethereum has historically been much smaller than the losses from hacks or DeFi protocol bugs, many crypto security researchers worry that an event where thousands of validators are simultaneously slashed is a serious risk.\n\nAnd as the Ether staking market swelled to over $57 billion this year, that risk has only become more troubling.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBitcoin Suisse is not the only Ethereum staking provider to suffer from slashing recently. In October, 20 Ethereum validators controlled by Lido, the biggest liquid staking protocol with over $18.5 billion of deposits, were slashed, resulting in a $30,000 hit. That incident was not the first time Lido\u2019s validators were slashed this year.\n\nLido's deposits climbed higher over the past year as Ethereum staking popularity soared\n\n\u201cEven very sophisticated experienced validator operators are still getting slashed,\u201d Ann Stefan, co-founder and COO of Cubist, a blockchain key management platform, told DL News in an interview.\n\n\u201cHaving best practices in place can really help prevent the incidence of these types of things from happening,\u201d Stefan said.\n\nBecause slashing can occur so easily, the fear of it happening is palpable among staking providers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all terrified of this,\u201d Fraser Brown, co-founder and CTO of Cubist, told DL News. \u201cThe way people get slashed in practice most of the time is they just make mistakes with their infrastructure.\u201d\n\nCubist has teamed up with 16 other crypto firms and protocols including Redacted, Swell, and EigenLayer to form the Secure Staking Alliance, a cross-industry partnership with the goal of making crypto staking more secure.\n\nWithin the alliance, Cubist is trying to solve the problem of slashing once and for all by making it almost impossible for stakers to be slashed accidentally.\n\nBut doing so skirts a fine line between keeping blockchains secure and making sure stakers are not unfairly punished.\n\nSlashing serves an important purpose by protecting Ethereum from attack. But the stringent security comes with a downside \u2014 it\u2019s easy for honest stakers to be slashed if they make a mistake.\n\n\u201cWe ended up with this tension where the fundamental security mechanism of Ethereum is actually the fundamental insecurity mechanism for validator node operators,\u201d Brown said.\n\nSolving slashing\n\nCubist\u2019s solution to accidental slashing is to create a layer of abstraction that validators must go through to sign off on the data they send to the Ethereum network.\n\nBlockchains like Ethereum are very similar to databases where the current state must follow on from the previous state. If a validator tries to publish an incorrect state it gets slashed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a database. The problem is databases are actually kind of hard,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIf you\u2019re running a whole bunch of validators, you have to have a global scalable database for every validator key. That\u2019s something you can get wrong.\u201d\n\nWhat Cubist proposes is that all validator clients must send messages to another piece of software \u2014 which Brown refers to as a \u201csky key\u201d \u2014 that is better equipped to make sure the validator\u2019s messages contain the correct data.\n\nAccording to Brown, as long as the sky key has serious slashing protection, the validators that rely on it will also be safe.\n\n\u201cYou just have to get all the hard database stuff right once and then all requests just go through that key,\u201d Brown said.\n\nTo make sure multiple validators aren\u2019t relying on the same abstracted key, Cubist deploys a separate instance for each validator. \u201cIf you have 100 validators there are 100 keys in the sky. One for each,\u201d Brown said.\n\nBeyond Ethereum staking\n\nWhile Cubist\u2019s slashing solution is most relevant to Ethereum, the most popular proof of stake blockchain, it is also relevant to other areas of staking.\n\nOne area which has previously drawn concern from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is restaking \u2014 an upcoming blockchain feature that will allow users to double-stake their Ether on other protocols and blockchains.\n\nCubist has signed partnerships with both EigenLayer and Babylon \u2014 two restaking protocols \u2014 specifically to focus on protecting their ecosystems from slashing.\n\nAccording to Stefan, protocols like these all have unique slashing conditions, which presents an additional layer of complexity. \u201cIt\u2019s even more important to have anti-slashers in place on these risk taking protocols,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd while Stefan and Brown say they are confident in Cubist\u2019s anti-slashing standards, they are also mindful of the risk of having all stakers rely on only their specific implementations.\n\n\u201cThe standards are not saying, \u2018You must use this setup, you must use this hardware,\u2019\u201d Stefan said. The message is, she added, here\u2019s how to set up your infrastructure if you want to have the best chance of not messing up.\n\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

        "title": "Ethereum vs Cosmos: Understanding the Differences - Blockgeeks",
        "content": "Imagine a world where you could seamlessly transfer digital assets across different blockchains using a smart contract platform, without any friction or limitations. With this smart contract development, cryptocurrencies can be easily transferred between different platforms. It sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie, but this article discusses the high security impact of a project. Well, that\u2019s exactly what Ethereum vs Cosmos are striving to achieve in the realm of specific blockchains and crypto. They are focused on improving transaction speed with the help of tendermint.\n\nBoth Ethereum and Cosmos have their own unique approaches to scalability, interoperability, governance, and the sovereign blockchain project. The Ethereum blockchain network focuses on scalability and interoperability, while the Cosmos blockchain network emphasizes governance and the crypto project. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the ethereum network, crypto, and tendermint is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology and maximize their rewards.\n\nSo whether you\u2019re an investor seeking promising crypto opportunities or simply curious about the future of decentralized networks, join us as we explore the clash of these crypto titans \u2013 Ethereum vs Cosmos. Discover the potential of tendermint, atom, and rollups.\n\nOrigins of Ethereum and Cosmos\n\nEthereum: Revolutionizing the Blockchain Game\n\nEthereum burst onto the scene in 2015, introducing a groundbreaking concept to the world of blockchain technology. The Ethereum network operates through the use of atoms, which are the fundamental units of the blockchain. Additionally, Ethereum has paved the way for the development of cosmos chains and rollups, revolutionizing the scalability and efficiency of blockchain transactions.

The Ethereum network operates through the use of atoms, which are the fundamental units of the blockchain. Additionally, Ethereum has paved the way for the development of cosmos chains and rollups, revolutionizing the scalability and efficiency of blockchain transactions. Created by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum aimed to go beyond Bitcoin\u2018s capabilities as a mere digital currency in the cosmos blockchain. It sought to provide a platform for developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) and execute smart contracts on the ethereum network, including ethereum l2s and cosmos chains, using the atom token.\n\nWith its native cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH) and the innovative use of the atom, Ethereum quickly gained popularity among developers and investors alike. The ethereum network, with its robust infrastructure, enabled the creation of innovative projects, including decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Ethereum L2s and atoms have also contributed to this ecosystem. Ethereum, the atom of innovation and disruption, became synonymous with the blockchain space.\n\nCosmos: Bridging Blockchains Together\n\nWhile Ethereum and Atom were making waves, another project was quietly brewing in the background. Enter Cosmos, an ambitious endeavor founded by Jae Kwon. The goal? To create an interconnected network of blockchains that could communicate and share information seamlessly, we can utilize the power of atom.\n\nCosmos introduced a novel concept known as \u201cinteroperability,\u201d which essentially means enabling different blockchains, including the atom, to interact with one another. This approach aimed to address one of the biggest challenges facing blockchain technology: siloed networks that operate independently without any means of collaboration. The solution involved implementing an atom, which allowed for seamless communication and collaboration between these independent networks. The solution involved implementing an atom, which allowed for seamless communication and collaboration between these independent networks. The solution involved implementing an atom, which allowed for seamless communication and collaboration between these independent networks.\n\nBy utilizing its native cryptocurrency called ATOM, Cosmos set out to build an ecosystem where multiple blockchains could coexist and exchange data securely and efficiently. This vision of connecting existing blockchain platforms together while preserving their autonomy attracted attention from developers looking for ways to bridge them using the atom.\n\nThe Clash: Ethereum vs. Cosmos\n\nNow that we have a glimpse into the origins of both Ethereum and Cosmos, let\u2019s dive into how they differ from each other. One key difference is that Ethereum focuses on smart contracts, while Cosmos is built on the concept of an atom. One key difference is that Ethereum focuses on smart contracts, while Cosmos is built on the concept of an atom. One key difference is that Ethereum focuses on smart contracts, while Cosmos is built on the concept of an atom.\n\nEthereum focuses on providing a comprehensive platform for building dApps and executing smart contracts within its own ecosystem. It has established itself as the go-to choice for developers looking to leverage blockchain technology for various use cases. With its vast array of tools, libraries, and community support, Ethereum has become the foundation for numerous successful projects.\n\nOn the other hand, Cosmos takes a different approach by prioritizing interoperability. It aims to create an interconnected network of blockchains that can communicate seamlessly with one another. This allows developers to leverage the unique features and capabilities of different blockchains while still benefiting from a shared ecosystem.\n\nWhile Ethereum remains the dominant force in terms of adoption and market capitalization, Cosmos presents an intriguing alternative for those seeking to bridge multiple blockchain platforms together. Its focus on interoperability opens up new possibilities for collaboration and innovation across various blockchain networks.\n\nExamination of Scalability and Performance\n\nScalability: A Key Factor in Blockchain Networks\n\nScalability is a crucial aspect when evaluating the potential of blockchain networks. It refers to the ability of a network to handle an increasing number of transactions efficiently without compromising its performance. In this regard, both Ethereum and Cosmos have implemented different approaches.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Approach to Scalability\n\nEthereum, being one of the pioneering blockchain platforms, has faced scalability challenges due to its design. Its current consensus mechanism, known as Proof of Work (PoW), requires extensive computational power and time-consuming processes for transaction validation. As a result, Ethereum has experienced issues with network congestion and high transaction fees during periods of increased activity.\n\nTo address these concerns, Ethereum is transitioning towards Ethereum 2.0, which introduces a new consensus mechanism called Proof of Stake (PoS). This upgrade aims to enhance scalability by allowing validators to create new blocks based on their stake in the network rather than relying solely on computational power. By doing so, Ethereum hopes to increase its transaction throughput significantly and reduce fees.\n\nCosmos\u2019 Approach to Scalability\n\nCosmos takes a different approach to scalability through its innovative architecture known as the Cosmos Network. Rather than focusing on scaling a single blockchain like Ethereum does, Cosmos enables the creation of multiple interconnected blockchains called \u201czones.\u201d These zones can operate independently while still being able to communicate with each other through the central hub called the \u201cCosmos Hub.\n\nThis modular design allows for horizontal scalability since each zone can process transactions independently and in parallel. Moreover, Cosmos utilizes a consensus algorithm called Tendermint BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance), which provides fast finality for transactions while maintaining security.\n\nPerformance: Speed and Efficiency Comparison\n\nSpeed and efficiency play vital roles in determining the usability and practicality of blockchain networks.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Performance Metrics\n\nEthereum\u2018s current architecture faces challenges in terms of transaction speed and efficiency. The PoW consensus mechanism, as mentioned earlier, requires significant computational resources and time for block validation. As a result, Ethereum\u2018s average block time is around 15 seconds, which can lead to delays in transaction confirmations during periods of high network congestion.\n\nHowever, with the upcoming transition to Ethereum 2.0 and the implementation of PoS, the network aims to achieve faster block times and improved efficiency. This upgrade could potentially reduce transaction confirmation times significantly and enhance overall performance.\n\nCosmos\u2019 Performance Metrics\n\nCosmos boasts impressive performance metrics due to its unique design and consensus algorithm. Tendermint BFT allows for fast finality, enabling transactions to be confirmed quickly with a high level of security.\n\nInteroperability Across Networks\n\nInteroperability, a fancy word that basically means the ability of different computer systems or networks to work together smoothly. In the world of blockchain, it refers to the capability of different blockchains to communicate and share information with each other. Now, let\u2019s dive into how Ethereum and Cosmos stack up.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Approach\n\nEthereum, one of the most well-known blockchain platforms out there, has been primarily focused on its own ecosystem. It has built a strong network of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. However,Ethereum has faced some challenges.\n\nOne solution that Ethereum has come up with is the concept of \u201cbridges.\u201d These bridges act as connectors between Ethereum and other blockchains, allowing for the transfer of assets and information. For example, projects like Polkadot and Chainlink have developed bridge technologies that enable cross-chain communication with Ethereum.\n\nCosmos\u2019 Solution\n\nOn the other hand, Cosmos takes a different approach to interoperability. Cosmos aims to create an interconnected network of independent blockchains called \u201czones\u201d that can communicate seamlessly with each other through a central hub called the \u201cCosmos Hub.\u201d\n\nThe Cosmos Hub acts as a relay chain that facilitates communication between various zones within the Cosmos ecosystem. This hub utilizes a technology called Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC), which allows for secure and efficient transfer of assets and data across different chains.\n\nComparing the Approaches\n\nWhen comparing Ethereum\u2018s bridge-based approach with Cosmos\u2019 IBC technology, there are some notable differences. While bridges provide a way for Ethereum to connect with external chains, they often require custom development for each specific connection. This can be time-consuming and may lead to compatibility issues.\n\nOn the other hand, Cosmos\u2019 IBC offers a more standardized approach to interoperability by providing a universal protocol for communication between chains. This means that any blockchain built on the Cosmos SDK can easily connect and communicate with other chains within the Cosmos ecosystem.\n\nThe Benefits of Interoperability\n\nHaving interoperability across networks brings several benefits to the blockchain space. First and foremost, it allows for the seamless transfer of assets between different blockchains. This opens up new possibilities for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, as users can easily move their assets from one chain to another.\n\nInteroperability also promotes collaboration and innovation by enabling developers to leverage functionalities from multiple blockchains. For example, a developer could build a dApp that utilizes smart contracts from Ethereum while leveraging the scalability features of another blockchain like Cosmos.\n\nSmart Contract Capabilities Compared\n\nEthereum: The Pioneer of Smart Contracts\n\nEthereum, often hailed as the pioneer of smart contracts, revolutionized the blockchain industry with its ability to execute self-executing contracts without intermediaries. With Ethereum, developers can create decentralized applications (DApps) and deploy smart contracts that automatically execute predefined conditions.\n\nSmart contracts on Ethereum are written in Solidity, a programming language specifically designed for this purpose. These contracts are executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a runtime environment that ensures their secure and reliable execution.\n\nOne of the key advantages of Ethereum\u2018s smart contract capabilities is its vast ecosystem. It has gained widespread adoption and support from developers worldwide, resulting in a rich collection of DApps and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects built on the platform. This extensive ecosystem offers users a wide range of options for interacting with different services and applications.\n\nCosmos: Enabling Interoperability\n\nWhile Ethereum paved the way for smart contracts, Cosmos takes it a step further by focusing on interoperability between different blockchains. It introduces the concept of \u201cinter-blockchain communication\u201d (IBC), which enables seamless transfer of assets and data across multiple chains within the Cosmos network.\n\nCosmos provides developers with an SDK called \u201cCosmos SDK,\u201d which allows them to build their own customized blockchains known as \u201czones.\u201d These zones can then connect to the Cosmos Hub, forming an interconnected network where transactions can be routed between different chains.\n\nWith Cosmos\u2019 smart contract capabilities, developers can create custom modules using programming languages like Golang or Rust. These modules enable specific functionalities within their zones while still benefiting from cross-chain communication facilitated by IBC.\n\nComparing Smart Contract Capabilities\n\nWhen comparing Ethereum and Cosmos in terms of smart contract capabilities, it\u2019s important to consider their respective strengths:\n\nFunctionality : Ethereum offers a more mature ecosystem for developing complex DApps and executing sophisticated smart contracts. Its extensive tooling and libraries provide developers with a wide range of options for building decentralized applications.\n\nInteroperability : While Ethereum focuses primarily on its own network, Cosmos prioritizes interoperability between different blockchains. This allows for the seamless transfer of assets and data across multiple chains within the Cosmos ecosystem, enabling greater flexibility and scalability.\n\nProgramming Languages: Ethereum uses Solidity as its primary programming language, which has gained significant popularity among developers. On the other hand, Cosmos supports various programming languages like Golang and Rust, providing developers with more flexibility in choosing their preferred language.\n\nConsensus Mechanisms Unveiled\n\nProof of Stake (PoS) vs. Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)\n\nConsensus mechanisms play a crucial role in the functioning of blockchain networks like Ethereum and Cosmos. Ethereum primarily relies on the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, while Cosmos utilizes the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus mechanism.\n\nProof of Stake (PoS)\n\nIn the world of Ethereum, PoS is the name of the game. This consensus mechanism allows participants to validate transactions and create new blocks based on their stake or ownership of cryptocurrency tokens. In simpler terms, the more tokens you hold, the more power you have in validating transactions and securing the network.\n\nWith PoS, there\u2019s no need for energy-intensive mining rigs like in Bitcoin\u2018s Proof of Work (PoW). Instead, validators are chosen randomly to create new blocks and validate transactions based on their token holdings. The idea behind PoS is that it incentivizes participants to act honestly since they have something at stake \u2014 their own tokens.\n\nByzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)\n\nOn the other hand, Cosmos takes a different approach with its BFT consensus mechanism. BFT is designed to address potential issues related to malicious actors or nodes within a network. It ensures that even if some nodes behave dishonestly or experience failures, overall network security and reliability remain intact.\n\nThe BFT consensus algorithm relies on a voting process where validators reach agreement before adding new blocks to the chain. Validators propose blocks and vote on whether they should be added or not. To achieve consensus, a certain threshold of votes is required.\n\nScalability: Sharding vs. Interoperability\n\nAnother important aspect when comparing Ethereum and Cosmos is scalability \u2013 how well these networks can handle an increasing number of users and transactions.\n\nSharding\n\nEthereum aims to tackle scalability challenges through sharding \u2013 breaking down its network into smaller, more manageable pieces called shards. Each shard can process its own transactions and smart contracts independently, which allows for parallel processing and increased throughput.\n\nThe idea behind sharding is to divide the workload among different shards, reducing congestion and improving overall network performance. This approach has the potential to significantly increase Ethereum\u2018s scalability and accommodate a larger user base.\n\nInteroperability\n\nCosmos takes a different approach to scalability by prioritizing interoperability between different blockchains. It aims to create an \u201cInternet of Blockchains\u201d where various chains can communicate and interact seamlessly.\n\nBy enabling cross-chain communication, Cosmos allows developers to build applications that can leverage the capabilities of multiple blockchains simultaneously. This interoperability not only enhances scalability but also promotes collaboration and innovation in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nDiverse Use Cases Explored\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nEthereum and Cosmos are both platforms that have seen significant adoption in the realm of decentralized finance (DeFi). Ethereum, with its smart contract capabilities, has been the go-to platform for developers looking to build DeFi applications. It has paved the way for innovations such as decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, and yield farming protocols. However, Ethereum\u2018s scalability limitations have become apparent as network congestion and high gas fees plague its ecosystem.\n\nCosmos, on the other hand, offers a solution to this scalability challenge through its inter-blockchain communication protocol (IBC). This allows different blockchains within the Cosmos ecosystem to communicate and share assets seamlessly. With its focus on scalability and interoperability, Cosmos provides an alternative platform for DeFi developers to explore.\n\nCross-Chain Interoperability\n\nOne of the key differentiators between Ethereum and Cosmos is their approach to cross-chain interoperability. While Ethereum primarily operates as a single blockchain network, Cosmos takes a more modular approach by enabling multiple independent blockchains to connect with each other through its IBC protocol.\n\nThis cross-chain interoperability opens up new possibilities for developers and users alike. It allows assets to be transferred across different blockchains without relying on centralized exchanges or custodians. For example, users can transfer their ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum to Cosmos-based chains or vice versa seamlessly. This interoperability also enables developers to leverage functionalities from different blockchains and create innovative applications that were not possible before.\n\nScalability Solutions\n\nScalability has long been a challenge for blockchain networks like Ethereum. As more users join the network and demand increases, congestion occurs, leading to slower transaction times and higher fees. To address this issue, both Ethereum and Cosmos have implemented various scalability solutions.\n\nEthereum is currently undergoing a transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism through the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. This shift aims to improve scalability by introducing shard chains, which will allow the network to process transactions in parallel.\n\nCosmos, on the other hand, tackles scalability through its hub-and-zone architecture. The Cosmos Hub acts as a central hub that connects different zones or blockchains within the ecosystem. Each zone can operate independently and handle its own transactions, significantly increasing scalability.\n\nNiche Applications\n\nWhile Ethereum has gained widespread adoption and is often associated with DeFi applications, Cosmos has found its niche in specific industries and use cases. For instance, Cosmos has seen success in gaming and non-fungible token (NFT) markets.\n\nEthereum and Cosmos in the Blockchain Trilemma\n\nDiverse Use Cases Explored\n\nIn the previous section, we delved into the diverse use cases of both Ethereum and Cosmos. Now let\u2019s explore how these two blockchain platforms address the challenges posed by the Blockchain Trilemma.\n\nScalability: Tackling the Need for Speed\n\nScalability is a crucial factor in determining a blockchain platform\u2019s success. Ethereum, with its proof-of-work consensus mechanism, has faced scalability issues due to its limited transaction processing capacity. As more users join the network and demand increases, congestion occurs, resulting in higher fees and slower transactions.\n\nOn the other hand, Cosmos takes a different approach to scalability. It utilizes a modular architecture that allows for multiple interconnected blockchains known as \u201czones.\u201d These zones can process transactions independently, reducing congestion and increasing overall scalability. By enabling interoperability between different chains through its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, Cosmos aims to create an internet of blockchains where data can flow seamlessly between different networks.\n\nSecurity: Safeguarding Assets and Transactions\n\nSecurity is paramount in any blockchain ecosystem. Ethereum has established itself as a secure platform over time but still faces occasional vulnerabilities due to its complex smart contract system. While efforts are being made to enhance security through upgrades like Ethereum 2.0 and layer-two solutions such as Optimism and Arbitrum, it remains an ongoing challenge.\n\nCosmos addresses security concerns by implementing a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithm called Tendermint Core. This consensus mechanism ensures that all nodes within the network agree on the state of transactions, providing robust security against malicious actors or potential attacks.\n\nDecentralization: Empowering Network Participants\n\nDecentralization lies at the heart of blockchain technology, ensuring that power is distributed among network participants rather than concentrated in a single entity\u2019s hands. Ethereum initially achieved significant decentralization but has faced challenges as large mining pools and powerful stakeholders have emerged, potentially impacting the network\u2019s overall governance.\n\nCosmos embraces decentralization by allowing independent blockchains to operate within its ecosystem. Each zone in Cosmos can have its own governance model, enabling participants to have a say in the decision-making process. By fostering a more inclusive and decentralized environment, Cosmos aims to empower users and prevent centralization concerns from arising.\n\nBridging the Gap: Interoperability and Cross-Chain Communication\n\nOne of the key differentiators between Ethereum and Cosmos is their approach to interoperability. Ethereum primarily focuses on building applications within its ecosystem, while Cosmos emphasizes cross-chain communication through its IBC protocol.\n\nGovernance Models and Community Influence\n\nGovernance models play a crucial role in the functioning of blockchain networks like Ethereum and Cosmos. These models determine how decisions are made, rules are enforced, and upgrades are implemented within the respective ecosystems. Community influence is an essential aspect that shapes the direction and growth of these networks.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Governance Model\n\nEthereum follows a decentralized governance model where decisions are made through a process called on-chain governance. This means that stakeholders can participate in decision-making by voting on proposals using their tokens. The Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) system allows anyone to submit proposals for changes or upgrades to the network.\n\nThe community\u2019s influence on Ethereum is significant, as it relies heavily on active participation from developers, miners, token holders, and other stakeholders. This decentralized approach ensures that decisions are made collectively and reflects the will of the majority.\n\nCosmos\u2019 Governance Model\n\nIn contrast to Ethereum, Cosmos employs an innovative governance model known as Tendermint Core-based Proof-of-Stake (PoS). It combines elements of both off-chain and on-chain governance. Validators in the network propose and vote on changes through an off-chain process. If a proposal receives enough votes from validators, it moves to an on-chain voting phase where token holders can cast their votes.\n\nCosmos\u2019 governance model emphasizes community involvement while maintaining efficiency by separating off-chain deliberation from on-chain execution. This approach enables faster decision-making without compromising security or scalability.\n\nCommunity Influence\n\nBoth Ethereum and Cosmos place great importance on community influence. The communities surrounding these networks actively participate in discussions, debates, and voting processes to express their preferences for upgrades or changes.\n\nIn Ethereum\u2018s case, its large user base contributes to a diverse range of opinions regarding proposed improvements or protocol changes. This diversity fosters innovation but can also lead to heated debates within the community before reaching consensus.\n\nSimilarly, Cosmos encourages active participation from its community through the governance process. Validators and token holders have the opportunity to voice their opinions and vote on proposals, ensuring a democratic decision-making system.\n\nThe influence of the community is crucial in maintaining the decentralization and security of these networks. It ensures that decisions are not solely made by a centralized authority but reflect the collective interests of stakeholders.\n\nTo summarize, Ethereum and Cosmos employ different governance models that prioritize community involvement in decision-making processes. Ethereum relies on on-chain governance, where stakeholders vote on proposals, while Cosmos combines off-chain and on-chain processes through its Tendermint Core-based PoS model. Community influence plays a vital role in shaping the direction and growth of both networks, ensuring decentralized decision-making and reflecting the will of the majority.\n\nAdvantages of Ethereum and Cosmos\n\nScalability and Interoperability\n\nEthereum and Cosmos offer distinct advantages.\n\nScalability: Ethereum has been the go-to platform for decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts, but its scalability has been a concern. However, with the introduction of Ethereum 2.0, also known as ETH2 or Serenity, the network aims to address this issue by implementing a new consensus algorithm called Proof-of-Stake (PoS). This upgrade is expected to significantly improve scalability by increasing transaction throughput.\n\nOn the other hand, Cosmos takes a different approach to achieve scalability through its unique architecture. It employs a hub-and-spoke model where multiple independent blockchains, known as zones, are connected to a central blockchain called the Cosmos Hub. This design allows for horizontal scaling as each zone can process transactions independently while still being able to communicate with other zones on the network.\n\nInteroperability: One of the key advantages of Cosmos is its focus on interoperability. The Cosmos Network enables seamless communication between different blockchains by utilizing the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. This means that applications built on one blockchain within the Cosmos ecosystem can easily interact with those on other blockchains in a secure and efficient manner.\n\nEthereum also recognizes the importance of interoperability and has made efforts towards achieving it through projects like Polkadot and Chainlink. These collaborations aim to connect different blockchains together and enable cross-chain functionality.\n\nDeveloper Ecosystem\n\nBoth Ethereum and Cosmos boast vibrant developer ecosystems that contribute to their growth and innovation.\n\nEthereum: As one of the first platforms to introduce smart contracts, Ethereum has attracted a large community of developers who have built an extensive range of DApps across various industries such as finance, gaming, decentralized finance (DeFi), and more. The availability of Solidity as a programming language and the extensive documentation provided by Ethereum make it easier for developers to get started and build on the platform.\n\nCosmos: While Cosmos is relatively newer compared to Ethereum, it has quickly gained traction among developers due to its unique architecture and focus on interoperability. The Cosmos SDK provides a comprehensive framework for building custom blockchains and DApps within the Cosmos ecosystem. This flexibility allows developers to tailor their applications to specific use cases while benefiting from the security and scalability offered by the Cosmos Hub.\n\nUse Cases\n\nBoth Ethereum and Cosmos have demonstrated their versatility through a wide range of real-world use cases.\n\nEthereum\n\nConclusion and Final Thoughts\n\nWe delved into their origins, scalability, interoperability, smart contract capabilities, consensus mechanisms, use cases, governance models, and advantages. Through this examination, we discovered that while Ethereum has established itself as a dominant force in the blockchain space, Cosmos offers unique solutions to address some of its limitations.\n\nBoth Ethereum and Cosmos have their strengths and weaknesses, catering to different needs within the blockchain ecosystem. Ethereum\u2018s robust smart contract capabilities and vast developer community make it an ideal choice for decentralized applications. On the other hand, Cosmos provides a scalable and interoperable framework for building interconnected blockchains.\n\nAs you consider which platform aligns with your goals and requirements, it\u2019s important to weigh the trade-offs and understand the specific use cases each platform excels at. Whether you choose Ethereum or Cosmos, both platforms contribute significantly to the advancement of blockchain technology. So dive deeper into their ecosystems, explore their communities, and embark on your journey toward building innovative decentralized solutions.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the difference between Ethereum and Cosmos?\n\nEthereum is a blockchain platform that enables developers to build decentralized applications, while Cosmos is an ecosystem of interconnected blockchains. Ethereum focuses on smart contracts and has its own native cryptocurrency (Ether), whereas Cosmos aims to facilitate communication between different blockchains.\n\nWhich blockchain offers better scalability, Ethereum or Cosmos?\n\nCosmos has a unique architecture that allows for horizontal scalability by connecting multiple blockchains through its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. On the other hand, Ethereum is currently transitioning from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to improve scalability. Both projects are actively working on enhancing their scalability solutions.\n\nCan I use Ethereum-based tokens on the Cosmos network?\n\nNo, you cannot directly use Ethereum-based tokens on the Cosmos network. However, there are bridge technologies being developed that aim to enable interoperability between different blockchains, including Ethereum and Cosmos. These bridges would allow for cross-chain token transfers and interactions.\n\nWhich blockchain has a larger developer community, Ethereum or Cosmos?\n\nCurrently, Ethereum has a larger developer community due to its longer history and widespread adoption. It has a vast ecosystem of developers building applications and contributing to its open-source projects. However, as Cosmos continues to grow in popularity and attract more developers, its community is also expanding rapidly.\n\nIs it possible for Ethereum and Cosmos to collaborate or work together?\n\nYes, collaboration between Ethereum and Cosmos is indeed possible. In fact, there have been discussions around potential integration between the two ecosystems. As both projects aim to solve similar challenges in the blockchain space, cooperation could lead to innovative solutions that benefit both communities."

        "title": "Why Ethereum\u2019s time to shine may be here - AMBCrypto English",
        "content": "ETH may hit $2,100 if buying pressure continues.\n\nMany transactions ended in profit in the last 24 hours.\n\nUnlike other altcoins, Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] price action failed to break out for a while. During that time, as recently as the 18th of November, ETH was swinging between $1,915 and $2,000. But in a swift move on the 22nd of November, the coin tapped $,2,083.\n\nHowever, technical indications revealed that ETH could be ready for more upside. JA Maartunn, an author at CryptoQuant, looked at ETH\u2019s price action and observed that there has been some Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) buying in the derivative market.\n\nSomeone(s) are TWAP-buying on Ethereum futures This linear growth in open interest indicates systematic buying over a certain period. There is $700 million added so far. pic.twitter.com/GCXK8u5yLL \u2014 Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) November 22, 2023\n\nLittle by little, ETH moons\n\nFrom the post above, Maartunn noted that over $700 million had entered the Ethereum market through TWAP. The TWAP strategy is used to minimize the impact of a large order on a cryptocurrency\u2019s value.\n\nSo, to reduce the impact, the order is broken down into smaller quantities. So, it is likely that some buy orders played a part in ETH\u2019s resurgence.\n\nAnother indicator AMBCrypto considered while assessing ETH\u2019s potential is the Open Interest. The Open Interest shows the number of outstanding futures contracts at the end of a trading day.\n\nAccording to data derived by AMBCrypto via Coinglass, ETH\u2019s Open Interest had increased. When this indicator increases at a time when the price is also increasing, it means there is a strong case for a further hike.\n\nMore gains on the way for holders?\n\nShould Open Interest resist a decline, ETH could be on its way to reclaiming $2,100. In the interim, holders of the altcoin seem satisfied with its recent performance.\n\nThis was shown by the daily on-chain transaction in profit, and compared with those in the red.\n\nAt the time of writing, the daily on-chain transaction volume in profit on the Ethereum network was 602,000. Those transactions in losses were 322,000.\n\nThis difference is a sign that most market players have received gains.\n\nThe Exponential Moving Average (EMA) backed the notion that ETH\u2019s upward momentum was alive. At press time, the 20 EMA (blue) had crossed over the 50 EMA (yellow). This crossover indicates that the trend is bullish.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nSo, traders may be looking to long/buy Ethereum for the intermediate term. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also supported the bullish bias. This was because the MACD had a positive value of 6.74.\n\nThis value can be used to signal an increasing upward moment. Therefore, traders looking to short ETH should take a break or watch the price action till the movement changes."

It is here, the analyst explains, that nearly 1.7 million wallets had grabbed a staggering 38.7 million Ethereum worth $81,492,525,000 at the time of this writing. Martinez used a chart provided by IntoTheBlock.\n\nNow that Ethereum has massive support beneath it and little resistance to go through ahead of it, if ETH succeeds in holding in the area where it is now, this could \"pave the way for ETH to reach new yearly highs,\" Martinez expects.\n\n#Ethereum overcame a key resistance zone between $1,982 and $2,044. Here, 1.67 million wallets acquired 38.7 million $ETH.\n\n\n\nWith minimal resistance ahead and solid support below, remaining above this demand area could pave the way for #ETH to reach new yearly highs. pic.twitter.com/mrSKls9N4M \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) November 24, 2023\n\nEthereum jumps by 10% within two days\n\nOver the past two days, ETH has made an astonishing jump of slightly over 10% from $1,933 to the local high of $2,127. This astounding increase was mostly due to Ethereum's price surge between Wednesday and Thursday, when it added 8.08% to its value and reached the $2,088 price tag.\n\nAt the time of writing this article, the second biggest crypto is changing hands at $2,106 after a tiny decline.\n\nThis price spike of Ethereum basically followed the growth of the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin, which suddenly jumped by more than 8% within the same period of two days. BTC is now trading at $37,909 after topping the $38,000 level earlier today.\n\nBitcoin surged on the news of a successful election of a pro-Bitcoin president in Argentina, far-right libertarian Javier Milei."

        "content": "Key Takeaways Investing in Ethereum or Cardano depends on your investment preferences and risk appetite.\n\nTransaction fees and transaction speed must be considered before investing in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has grown tremendously in terms of user penetration and revenue generation. Revenues are projected to reach US $37.9B in 2023, although these digital currencies are often associated with volatility and uncertainty. Multiple blockchain platforms are there in the crypto market offering different currencies. However, the two cryptocurrencies that have gained the limelight over the years are Ethereum and Cardano. Both of them rank among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This is not the only reason to invest in cryptos. This article will discuss similarities and key differences between Ethereum and Cardano\u2013 the two major cryptocurrencies, so you can make an informed investment decision.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum and Cardano Ethereum in Brief Ethereum is a network of computers across the globe that follows the Ethereum protocol. It is a community-run technology that operates on blockchain to enable smart contracts and crypto trading. It is one of the best altcoins to invest your money in. Ethereum\u2019s History and Vision Ethereum was created by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 but gained public awareness in 2014 after the Bitcoin Conference in Miami, Florida. It promotes itself as a peer-to-peer network that can be used by anyone interested in coordinating globally, creating organizations, building apps, and sharing values. Ethereum cryptocurrency, Ether, can be used for digital global payments. Cardano in Brief Cardano defines itself as the first blockchain platform to be developed through peer-reviewed research. It offers unparalleled security to its users and helps them ease transactions and exchanges & provides a system for organizations to grow. It works on the famous Proof-of-stake model (PoS), with a distinctive two-layer structure. Cardano\u2019s History and Vision Cardano was developed by Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood in 2017. Charles was one of the co-founders of Ethereum. During its launch, this highly valued cryptocurrency created 31 billion tokens. It also raised $60M+ during the initial coin offering in 2017. Cardano\u2019s core vision is to disrupt the way blockchains reach consensus so they utilize a proof-of-stake called Ouroboros to be the most environmentally sustainable blockchain platform.\n\nEthereum vs Cardano: Key Parameters for Comparison The key differences between Ethereum and Cardano blockchain platforms lie in their credibility, ability to process high-volume transactions, and other parameters. Here is a comparative analysis between the two. Points of Difference Cardano Ethereum Token The supply of Cardano cannot exceed the maximum cap set at 45 billion coins. Ethereum has not set any upper restrictions on token supply. In contrast, its supply is set to increase at a fixed rate of 4.5% annually. Transaction Speed Cardano provides a transaction speed of approximately 250 per second. The transaction speed lies between 15 seconds to 5 minutes for Ethereum. Transaction Fees The transaction fee stands at 0.16 USD. The average transaction fee is approximately 1.164 USD. Nodes Cardano also operates on three nodes that take care of crypto transactions, help participate in blockchain governance, and send information between mCore nodes and the public internet. Ethereum works on three popular nodes to run its operations smoothly. These nodes include light, full, and archive nodes. Each node has its function ranging from ensuring accuracy to containing transaction data and history from previous blocks. Scalability Cardano is more flexible than Ethereum and can handle more transaction volumes. Ethereum cannot handle more transactions and the system faces a lag when more investors use the platform at the same time.\n\nFuture Outlook: Which Altcoin is a Better Investment? Whether to invest your money in Ethereum vs Cardano depends on your investment preferences and risk appetite. However, crypto experts believe that investing in Ethereum is more beneficial because of the support it gets from its developer community and large ecosystem. In contrast, investment in Cardano can go high for long-term acquisitions as it is growing in emerging markets. The popularity of this crypto depends on the support it is getting in from its growing user base. However, you need to wait a while to see how it will impact the growth and prices of Cardano.\n\nConclusion Investment in cryptocurrencies might be risky because of market volatility. However, having proper knowledge of different currencies might help you make a better decision. If you are looking to park your funds in the top cryptos, understanding the Ethereum vs Cardano differences helps you learn which crypto is suitable for your investment."

        "title": "Ethereum \u2013 An Epic Breakout Test Is Ongoing, And Why Dec 1st Marks A Deadline - Investing Haven",
        "content": "The price of Ethereum is testing an epic breakout point. Today, in overnight trading, the third test of 2121 USD in a period of 7 months took place. To break out or not to break out, is the million dollar question top of mind of crypto investors. Here is a simple trick that can bring some peace of mind: December 1st is a breakout milestone, here is why.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s review the Ethereum chart.\n\nThe daily chart is a beauty. It\u2019s not the most beautiful crypto chart. In order to find the most beautiful ones, we suggest you check out our latest premium post (available for existing and new subscribers) 30 cryptocurrencies in 7 segments combined with Strength In AI-Tokens, DeFi and Other Segments Taking A Break.\n\nThat said, anyone who can read a chart will see a bullish reversal. What is interesting is that the reversal is perfectly respected. We can see this by price behavior around the 50% retracement level (fine purple line). The specific price point is 2121 USD. In 2023, this specific level was tested twice, overnight a third time, and that very specific price point was rejected in each of the 3 occurrences.\n\nThe point is this \u2013 the rejection occurred at a very, very specific price point which coincides with the most important retracement level (50%). This implies that the reversal is very reliable and dominant.\n\nNow, back to the original question, how to know whether the breakout will finally occur?\n\nThat\u2019s where we have to switch to the x-axis of the chart, the most underexposed part of the chart.\n\nAs seen, the previous attempt, back in April, was rejected after 5 days. That\u2019s a number in the Fibonacci sequence. The current attempt is ongoing for 15 days, not a Fibonacci numbers.\n\nWhat we do know from experience is that breakouts attempts tend to fail after a number of days that coincide with a Fibonacci number. In the current setup, as 15 days is not a number from the Fibonacci series, the next days in the series, being 21, coincides with December 1st, 2023.\n\nThat\u2019s why, Dec 1st (+/- 1day) is the milestone for the ongoing breakout attempt. Adding price info to this, results in this statement:\n\nEthereum has an unique opportunity to clear 2121 USD and stage a secular breakout;\n\nif it does so before Dec 1st it will be a high probability confirmed breakout;\n\nhowever if price is rejected until then and moves lower on Dec 1st or Dec 2nd, it will not likely break out for at least a month or two.\n\nThat\u2019s how we combine price and timeline readings, and more detail across various altcoins is shared in our weekly alerts in our premium crypto research service >>\n\nReceive our crypto FREE newsletter alerts Download 50 crypto investing tips"

        "title": "Ethereum To $36,800? Token Terminal Predicts When This Will Happen - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Blockchain analytics platform Token Terminal has provided insight into the future trajectory of the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum (ETH). Interestingly, they predict that the crypto token could rise as high as $36,800.\n\nWhen Ethereum Will Hit $36,800\n\nIn the research paper released by the platform, Ethereum is billed to hit the $36,800 mark by 2030. However, this prediction is made in the best-case scenario of 2030 being a bull market season. One of the ways in which they analyzed ETH\u2019s future value was with the total Addressable Market analysis.\n\nThey looked at the industries already adopting blockchains while forecasting how much of them will move on-chain by 2030. In line with this, they considered the role Ethereum could play in this in terms of tokenization. Token Terminal believes that all assets could be tokenized on the network, playing an integral role in the finance industry.\n\nThe finance industry apparently does over $28 trillion in annual revenues at the moment and is growing at a compound annual rate of 7.5%. With this in mind, Token Terminal foresees that the finance industry and Ethereum could form a mutually beneficial relationship. For one, a majority of the liquidity in the industry could become consolidated on the Ethereum network.\n\nSource: Token Terminal\n\nAlongside the prediction of $36,800 in 2030, the blockchain analytics platform projects that Ethereum could also enjoy an 80% market share among Layer 1 networks. The network could reach a monthly revenue of $109,668 in the best-case scenario (dependent on 2030 being a bull year).\n\nEthereum\u2019s Price In The Next Bull Cycle\n\nMeanwhile, Token Terminal also gave an insight into what Ethereum\u2019s price could look like in the next bull run. According to the platform, the crypto token could rise to as high as $13,000 at the peak of the bull market. From their projection, the Bitcoin Halving is seen as a catalyst that could spark the next cycle.\n\nSource: Token Terminal\n\nThe next Bitcoin Halving is expected to take place on April 4, 2024. Based on Token Terminal\u2019s analysis, Ethereum\u2019s price could rise to $2,300 by then. From that moment, ETH is projected to see an increase of over 469% as it surges to over $13,000 at the peak of the next bull cycle.\n\nThe future of Ethereum looks really promising based on these forecasts. Above all, Token Terminal expects the network to continue to dominate its competitors in terms of the economic opportunity on it. They predict that new use cases on Ethereum will spur it to \u201cgrow exponentially larger\u201d in the coming years.\n\nETH price reclaims $2,100 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from The Conversation, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Top crypto analyst Bluntz says that the recent correction in Solana (SOL) is over and that rallies are set to continue for the leading Ethereum (ETH) rival.\n\nIn a new strategy session, the pseudonymous analyst tells his YouTube subscribers that SOL has completed an ABC correction, priming itself for another impulse to the upside.\n\nBluntz uses Elliott Wave theory, which attempts to forecast price movements based on crowd psychology which tends to manifest in waves. Traditionally, the Elliott Wave theory suggests that price impulses happen in five waves after three-wave \u201cABC\u201d corrections.\n\nAccording to Bluntz, SOL\u2019s correction is over.\n\n\u201cThis is definitely looking impulsive to me on the lower timeframes. We\u2019ve had a five-wave rise here\u2026 [And a] very minor ABC pullback and now we\u2019re going again, so I do think the SOL dip is over.\u201d\n\nThe trader says that Solana is likely destined to be the \u201cfastest horse\u201d moving into the next crypto market cycle, and says its Bitcoin pair (SOL/BTC) is suggesting more strength to come in the near future.\n\nBluntz says that for the time being, he\u2019s targeting somewhere above $80 for Solana until it appears that SOL has fully completed a five-wave move to the upside. However, based on his chart, the trader suggests that SOL is likely destined for much higher prices than $80.\n\nSays Bluntz,\n\n\u201cI do think we\u2019re going to continue making new highs and continue making three-wave pullbacks and continue higher. And then, once this structure looks complete and it looks like five of five [waves] has completed, marking from this very first wave down here, that\u2019s when I might start to get worried.\n\nBut at least for now, looking at this on the daily, I think this still has plenty of juice left in the tank, and I think we\u2019re probably hitting $80+ in this next leg and we\u2019ll reassess when we get there.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, SOL is trading for $57.39.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "The 7 Best Ethereum Wallets to Know About for 2024 - Simplilearn",
        "content": "It\u2019s time to talk about wallets. No, not that thing made of imitation leather that you fold up and put in your back pocket. But, of course, everything else is already digitized today, so why not wallets?\n\nHowever, we're talking about an electronic wallet that fits a particular function. Specifically, we\u2019re talking about the world of cryptocurrency. That\u2019s why today we\u2019re exploring Ethereum wallets, what they are, and which ones are the best Ethereum wallets that 2024 has to offer.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nWhat Is Ethereum, Anyway? According to Investopedia, Ethereum is defined as \u201c\u2026a platform powered by blockchain technology that is best known for its native cryptocurrency, called ether, or ETH, or simply ethereum. The distributed nature of blockchain technology is what makes the Ethereum platform secure, and that security enables ETH to accrue value.\u201d The Ethereum platform, launched in 2015, supports not only ether, but also a network of decentralized apps known as dApps. Smart contracts, self-executing contracts with its terms of agreement written directly into the code, got their start on the Ethereum platform. Whereas the Bitcoin blockchain exists solely to support the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, Ethereum wants to be more. Ethereum is angling to become an electronic, programmable network that supports numerous applications beyond cryptocurrency. As of January 2022, the Ethereum cryptocurrency\u2019s market value is second only to Bitcoin. That\u2019s a healthy position to be in when it comes to the world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nSo, What Is an Ethereum Wallet? The short answer: Ethereum wallets are applications that allow users to interact with their Ethereum accounts. The slightly longer answer: Many banks and other financial institutions have apps that customers can use to conduct banking transactions with their mobile devices. Consider Ethereum wallets as the cryptocurrency counterpart of those banking apps. However, mobile banking apps are optional. You can get along fine without them and still access your account through more traditional mundane methods (but why would you want to?). Furthermore, the nature of Ethereum requires a wallet for you to move funds and manage your ETH. Wallets come in four forms: Physical Hardware: These are highly secure wallets that let you keep your cryptocurrency offline.\n\nMobile Applications: These resources let you access your funds from anywhere.\n\nWeb Wallets: As the name implies, web wallets allow you access to your crypto account through a web browser.\n\nDesktop Applications: You can access your accounts and manage your funds via Windows, macOS, or Linux if you have a desktop system. You can swap wallet providers whenever you like, and many of them let you manage several Ethereum applications at once from one application. And speaking of the Ethereum wallets, let\u2019s look at the best offerings for this year. Basics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nWhat Are the Best Ethereum Wallets for 2024? Trezor Model T Let\u2019s begin our list with the oldest Bitcoin hardware wallet, arguably considered the best Ethereum wallet available. Main Highlight: It\u2019s all about security. The PIN never leaves the wallet, and this extra layer of protection makes it more difficult for hackers to access your funds.\n\nAdditional Features: Trezor is a hardware wallet that stores your funds on a USB flash drive. It supports over one thousand cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Dash, and Ethereum Classic. But it doesn\u2019t support Ripple, Monero, Cardano, or Tezos. Trezor is compatible with Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux.\n\nDrawbacks: However, Trezor isn\u2019t ideal for quick trading due to its enhanced security. CryptoWallet CryptoWallet was designed to address the problems presented by other wallets. It includes banking services such as a debit card and an IBAN. Main Highlight: CryptoWallet is a free mobile wallet that\u2019s easy to use.\n\nAdditional Features: CryptoWallet lets users buy real goods and services with their cryptocurrency via the wallet\u2019s debit card. It can also support multiple tokens in one secure wallet.\n\nDrawbacks: On the downside, users can\u2019t control their keys in CryptoWallet. MetaMask This wallet is is one of the best Ethereum wallets for network newbies. This browser extension lets you access Ethereum's blockchain via Google Chrome, Brave, Vivaldi, and Mozilla Firefox. Main Highlight: This is a free web wallet that lets you access your wallet via your browser.\n\nAdditional Features: The wallet is linked to the Coinbase and ShapeShift exchange.\n\nDrawbacks: Although MetaMask is convenient once it\u2019s running, it\u2019s a little tough to set up. Ledger Nano X The Ledger Nano X is an advanced Ethereum wallet that offers security usually only found in custodial cryptocurrency wallets. The Nano X are devices you plug into your computer, like a USB flash drive. After you install the software, you can use it to store cryptocurrency. Main Highlight: Security is the main sell here, like the Trezor Model T. Hackers can't crack these wallets unless they have their backup password, known as the seed phrase.\n\nAdditional Features: This wallet is a hardware wallet, and it supports a variety of cryptocurrencies including Ethereum.\n\nDrawbacks: Users may find the setup and usage a bit tricky. It also takes time to move funds from the wallets to the cryptocurrency exchanges, so forget about rapid trading. Also, the user has no backup if they lose the seed phrase, and if they lose the wallet or it gets ruined, the funds are gone. Basics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program Exodus Here\u2019s another one of the best Ethereum wallets that\u2019s great for beginners. It\u2019s a relatively new entry into the Ethereum wallet field but has numerous features that help increase its visibility in the market. In addition, this wallet is easy to set up and use. Main Highlight: Exodus is a free desktop app that comes with a mobile application as well. It\u2019s compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\nAdditional Features: The wallet supports many cryptocurrencies and offers customer support and crypto exchange via the built-in Shapeshift exchange. Exodus can also synch with your Trezor portfolio.\n\nDrawbacks: But Exodus is a bit light on the security side, as it has no 2FA security measures in place. The app also doesn\u2019t support fiat currencies such as pounds or euros. Mist Mist the official Ethereum wallet, built by the cryptocurrency\u2019s creators. Unsurprisingly, it\u2019s considered one of the best Ethereum wallets available today. Main Highlight: This desktop wallet is open-source, and considering it\u2019s been developed by Ethereum\u2019s creators and recognized as one of the better wallets out there, that\u2019s quite a bargain.\n\nAdditional Features: Mist\u2019s creators have integrated it with ShapeShift, and you can use the wallet to buy ETH with BTC or fiat currency with no hassles.\n\nDrawbacks: However, you must install Ethereum\u2019s full node before using Mist, which means putting over 1TB into your device. Since it synchs with the Ethereum blockchain, it takes longer to load. Also, it only supports ETH and ERC20. MyEtherWallet We finish off our list of the best Ethereum wallets with MyEtherWallet, another Ethereum wallet that\u2019s been around for a while. MyEtherWallet offers support for hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor. In addition, your funds are stored on your computer instead of on a server. Main Highlight: MyEtherWallet is an open-source product that\u2019s easy to use, well-supported, and comes as a mobile and desktop application.\n\nAdditional Features: Since your funds are stored on your computer instead of off-site on a server, MyEtherWallet offers a more secure non-custodial solution.\n\nDrawbacks: MyEtherWallet is for ether and ERC20 tokens only. It doesn\u2019t support other coins. Unfortunately, this wallet also has no customer support if you lose your funds. That means users must be careful with their recovery passwords! So, which of the wallets on this list is best? That hinges on how much you want to spend, what you want to use it for, and how technical-minded or experienced with cryptocurrency you are. If you want something easy to use, minimal cost (as in, free!), and you don\u2019t need bells and whistles, consider CryptoWallet or MetaMask. However, if you want to spend money, go for the Trezor Model T or the Ledger Nano X. It comes down to personal taste, but this article at least narrows down the field considerably, making a choice easier.

        "content": "Bullish sentiment has pushed ETH above $2000.\n\nThe coin\u2019s MVRV ratio shows that many investors still hold at a profit.\n\nFollowing a few weeks of trading within a narrow price range, Ethereum [ETH] has reclaimed the $2000 price level.\n\nThe rally above this key price level came amid a surge in new demand for the leading altcoin during the trading session on 23rd November, data from Santiment showed.\n\nAccording to the data provider, the daily count of new addresses trading ETH began to trend upward on the 21st of November and had increased by 17% by 23rd November. At press time, ETH exchanged hands at $2,068.\n\nThe bears are under attack\n\nETH\u2019s rally above $2000 coincided with the comeback of green histogram bars on its Awesome Oscillator indicator.\n\nAMBCrypto found that while ETH lingered in a tight price range, it\u2019s Awesome Oscillator returned only red upward-facing bars. This highlighted the state of indecision and low trading activity in the market.\n\nHowever, with the uptick in new demand recorded in the past few days, the green upward-facing bars of ETH\u2019s Awesome Oscillator signaled that the alt\u2019s price is likely to continue to see growth.\n\nGreen upward-facing bars in the Awesome Oscillator are typically seen after a period of consolidation or a pullback. They indicate that the buyers are taking control of the market and that the price rally might continue.\n\nAlso confirming the re-emergence of bullish sentiment, the MACD line of ETH\u2019s Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator was poised to cross above its trend line at press time.\n\nWhen the MACD line of an asset\u2019s MACD indicator is geared to cross above the trend line, it is considered a bullish signal. This means that the momentum of the price is shifting from negative to positive and that the price rally is likely to continue.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nETH holders continue to turn a profit\n\nWhile its price consolidated within a tight range, its Market Value To Realized Value ratio (MVRV) remained positive. This meant that investors who sold did so above their cost basis, seeing profit.\n\nAt press time, ETH\u2019s MVRV ratio was 35.02%. This indicated that, given its present value, coin holders would see a minimum of 35% return on their investments if they chose to sell now."

Dougie DeLuca, Investor at Figment Capital mentioned the fact that DeFi protocols are becoming MEV conscious, which could be a huge thing and make the whole system way more profitable. Anne-Grace Kleczewski, Co-Founder and Chief Legal Officer at Keom Protocol shared her opinion about why zero-knowledge proofs and account abstraction technologies have great potential in DeFi. Luca (Moss) Mossini, BD at Avantgarde and Enzyme Finance, emphasized the importance of having more traditional finance (TradFi) players integrating on-chain solutions because some could continue to be the last-mile access for users.\n\nThey also talked about the rise of liquid staking derivatives and whether the current state of Ethereum staking had a concentration issue. Other topics covered include real-world assets, growing awareness of DeFi, restaking solutions, and the ongoing battle to reach the masses.\n\nThe panel discussion was moderated by Daria Krasnova, Managing Editor at BeInCrypto and participated by Dougie DeLuca, Investor at Figment Capital, Luca (Moss) Mossini, BD at Avantgarde & Enzyme Finance, Anne-Grace Kleczewski, Co-Founder and Chief Legal Officer at Keom Protocol, Mete (Ali) Ba\u015fkaya, Blockchain & Crypto Lecturer and Seraphim Czecker, Head of Growth at Ethena Labs.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI-powered Builder Identification\n\nJack He, Co-founder of Aspecta shared how they are leveraging AI technologies like large language models (LLM) and image recognition to build an identity solution for builders to consolidate their behavior data across different platforms.\n\nAspecta enables builders to create LinkedIn-like identity pages and credentials to showcase their skills, experience, and impact, which the team believes fills an important gap and helps to facilitate growth and collaboration among different developer ecosystems.\n\nCollaboration among Security Solution Providers Needed\n\nIn a panel discussion on Web3 security, security experts from MetaMask Snaps, Matter Labs, Certik, DTS Project, and MetaTrust Labs shared their observations as to the current state of Web3 security and some of the emerging threats.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, they also shared some cutting-edge solutions designed to safeguard the Web3 ecosystem and the lessons learned from the high-profile hacks in the last year.\n\nAn\u0131l \u00d6z, Chief Technology Officer at DATS Project emphasized that he thought every cyber security service provider should collaborate and share their knowledge to build a safer and more secure Web3 future.\n\nLastly, they talked about how individuals can effectively guard against personal losses by using tools such as browser extensions and Metamask\u2019s Blockaid security alerts, an experimental function to be standardized in Q1 2024.\n\nThe panel discussion was moderated by Sima Baktas, Web3 Attorney at GlobalB Law and Co-Founder of CryptoFemale, Anton Astafiev, VP of Security at Matter Labs, Christian Montoya, Senior Product Owner at MetaMask Snaps, Connie Lam, Head of Solution Architect at CertiK, An\u0131l \u00d6z, Chief Technology Officer at DATS Project and TY Shao, Chief Business Officer at MetaTrust Labs.\n\nCrypto Entrepreneurs Gaining Valuable Experience during the Bear Market\n\nIn a panel discussion on crypto entrepreneurship, global and local project leaders shared their firsthand experience of building cryptocurrency businesses. While they highlighted challenges such as user education, lack of service providers, lack of prior examples to draw upon as well as legal and regulatory uncertainties, they shared an opinion that building products that solve real-world problems, focusing on user experiences, and finding creative ways to collaborate with other players are critical strategies founders should prioritize to navigate through these challenges.\n\nCommenting on the phenomenon that many crypto entrepreneurs are pivoting to AI to capture venture capital\u2019s interest, Bertu\u011f Oymak, Co-Founder and CEO of Utilify noted that entrepreneurs should build products for their customers instead of investors. He advised startups to \u201cride the hype\u201d when necessary but always build the war chest for survival as founders will eventually have to face a bear market.\n\nArif Kalem, Brand Ambassador of Turkey at BingX added to underline that marketing and communications is a non-stop process and should not be undervalued in bear markets.\n\nCommenting on Turkey\u2019s crypto landscape, Erkan G\u00fcl, Founder of Moseiki App mentioned that the number of trader communities is too high compared to builder communities, but the transformation is underway.\n\nThe panel discussion was moderated by \u00d6zge ERDEM\u0130R, Web3 Advisor, Business Developer, and participated by Bertu\u011f Oymak, Co-Founder and CEO of Utilify, Erkan G\u00fcl, Founder of Moseiki App, Victor Yu, Co-Founder of Carv and Arif Kalem, Brand Ambassador of Turkey at BingX.\n\nA New Paradigm to Secure Protocols and LP Assets on Ethereum\n\nYajin (Andy) Zhou, CEO of Blocksec launched Phalcon Block, an automated attack-blockchain system, at the conference. Phalcon Block offers an integrated solution that combines protocol monitoring, attack blocking, and incident response, ensuring secure operations of protocols after they go live.

Lido Finance LDO], the leading protocol on the chain, has recorded a 21% TVL uptick within the period under consideration.\n\nETH turns deflationary\n\nDue to the growth in on-chain activity and gas fees on the Ethereum network, its native token, which had earlier seen its supply multiply due to low activity, has now turned deflationary.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nA surge in Ethereum\u2019s network activity is a crucial driver of deflation as increased usage leads to greater ETH burn rates. This causes a reduction in the coin\u2019s supply, which is good for its price.\n\nAccording to data from Ultrasound.money, ETH\u2019s supply has fallen by over 22,000 ETH in the last month alone."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nInterest in upcoming Ethereum layer-2 network Blast is bringing lots of cash with it. According to DeFi Llama, total value locked (TVL) in the project now stands at over $405 million just days after the project was announced\u2014and it\u2019s growing fast.\n\nBlast is a new Ethereum scaling network announced on Tuesday. In the crowded market of layer-2 networks (like Arbitrum and Optimism), developers come up with ideas to make it quicker, easier, and cheaper for people to do things on Ethereum\u2019s sometimes slow and costly blockchain.\n\nThis particular project is led in part by Tieshun \u201cPacman\u201d Roquerre, who co-founded Blur, the largest NFT marketplace in the space. Blur is known for giving traders ample rewards for using and remaining loyal to the marketplace, and Blast apparently aims to do much the same.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe idea of Blast is that users deposit crypto\u2014mainly staked Ethereum (ETH) and stablecoins\u2014to earn returns. And people are depositing their funds fast. One crypto wallet this week deposited 10,000 ETH to the project. That\u2019s nearly $21 million in crypto.\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch: Blast isn't actually live yet.\n\nBlast said that it will keep users funds until its bridge goes live in February, and the sudden rise of the network and questions about the model have people talking about whether it\u2019s safe to invest or not. Blast itself claims an even higher figure of $443 million total value locked, as of this writing, with nearly 53,000 users so far.\n\nSome degen deposited 10,000 ETH into BLAST. \ud83d\ude33 pic.twitter.com/GODo20RDTp \u2014 Farokh (@farokh) November 22, 2023\n\nSome traders are concerned it may be a Ponzi scheme, as those who refer other users can receive \u201cBlast points\u201d for a May airdrop. The project is also promising sizable, \u201crisk-free\u201d yields of 4% in ETH and 5% on stablecoins to its users.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOthers\u2014including pseudonymous NFT developer Phygital and Polygon Labs engineer Jarrod Watts\u2014have claimed that requiring three out of five anonymous keys to sign and execute transactions is potentially dangerous. Watts in particular said that Blast \"is not an L2,\" at least not in its current incarnation.\n\nBy sending money to the Blast contract, you're basically trusting 3-5 strangers to stake your funds for you. You won't be able to withdraw that money at any point in time unless those 3-5 people decide to do the right thing in the future. Again, there's no bridge here. (14/24) \u2014 Jarrod Watts (@jarrodWattsDev) November 23, 2023\n\n\u201cInvesting funds into Blast is like trusting 3-5 strangers to stake your crypto,\u201d Watts wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \u201cAnd you won\u2019t be able to withdraw it unless 3 signers decide it. To me, it sounds risky.\u201d\n\nPacman wrote Friday on Twitter that the project promises big rewards because the yield is coming from major decentralized finance projects Lido and MakerDAO.\n\n1/ There's a meme going around that Blast is a ponzi. The yield that Blast provides users can feel too good to be true, so this meme is understandable. But to put it simply, the yield Blast provides comes (initially) from Lido and MakerDAO. Lido yield comes from ETH staking\u2026 \u2014 Pacman | Blur + Blast (@PacmanBlur) November 24, 2023\n\n\u201cThe reason the yield feels too good to be true in Blast is because Blast makes this yield the default for everyone,\u201d he said, adding that the project is \u201cdemocratizing higher yield.\u201d\n\nBlast has also said that one of the types of yields is the risk-free interest rate ETH staking. But members of Lido, including one who goes by the name of Sacha on X, have pointed out that no form of staking is entirely \u201crisk-free.\u201d\n\nimportant to clarify that this statement is false. while i am of the opinion that staking needs to be made as close to risk-free as possible, we are not there today. there are governance, contract, and operator risks involved. anyone using Blast needs to keep these in mind https://t.co/8z9dVJhr6J \u2014 sacha\ud83d\udca7 (@sachayve) November 21, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDecrypt reached out to Blast for additional comment about the concerns, but did not immediately hear back.\n\nRisk-free or not, investors continue plugging large sums of crypto into the project at breakneck speed\u2014and it\u2019s an investment that won\u2019t budge for months. They\u2019ll have to hope Blast lives up to its promises.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "How Far Ethereum Upgrades Have Come? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. It is the pioneering blockchain that applied blockchain technology to several traditional industries. After facing network congestion issues and high Ethereum gas fees, the developers behind the blockchain started implementing a series of upgrades.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum upgrades take place when they are proposed with the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). The ongoing series of Ethereum upgrades are supposed to make the network sustainable, scalable, secure, and efficient. But, are they succeeding? How far Ethereum upgrades have come? Let us find out in this article.\n\nOverview of Ethereum\n\nEthereum holds a special place in the crypto industry being a pioneer of decentralized applications. It was developed by Vitalik Buterin, Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, and others with an initial vision of creating a \u201cone global computer for the entire planet\u201d.\n\nEthereum introduced smart contract technology to the tech world. It brought remarkable applications like non-fungible tokens, decentralized finance (DeFi), metaverse, GameFi, and more.\n\nInitially, it failed to address the scalability issues and skyrocketing gas prices on the blockchain network. Adding to that the environmental concerns of the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism are added to the list of Ethereum issues.\n\nIn the meanwhile, blockchain networks such as Cardano, Polkadot, and Solana emerged claiming to be \u201cEthereum Killers\u201d. The strong developer team behind the Ethereum decided to address all these challenges with a series of upgrades on the network. Let us now discuss the upgrades that were successfully implemented till now.\n\nRecap of Ethereum Upgrades\n\nEven though the Ethereum network has undergone numerous upgrades, the actual Ethereum 2.0 upgrade started with the Beacon Chain Genesis in December, 2020. Beacon Chain implementation was the first step in transforming Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Following several small improvements such as Muir Glacier, Beacon Chain\u2019s functionality was improved.\n\nEthereum London Upgrade\n\nEthereum London Upgrade marks an important milestone in reforming the gas fees on the Ethereum network. It brought changes to the gas fees with the help of Ethereum Improvement proposal 1559 (EIP \u2013 1559). Ethereum London Upgrade went live in August, 2021 and introduced a new gas fee system.\n\nThe Merge\n\nAfter the London upgrade, multiple improvements like the Berlin upgrade, Arrow Glacier, and Altair took place on Ethereum. Bellatrix upgrade was implemented in September, 2022 to prepare the blockchain for the most-awaited \u201cThe Merge\u201d event. It played a critical role in transitioning the last block of PoW mechanism to the first block of the PoS chain.\n\nFinally, the groundbreaking \u201cEthereum Merge\u201d or the Paris upgrade was implemented in September 2022. With this, Ethereum created history in the blockchain industry. It achieved an impossible feat of transitioning from PoW consensus mechanism to PoS. This is an important milestone in making Ethereum a sustainable blockchain.\n\nShapella Upgrade\n\nThe latest Ethereum upgrade, Shapella, took place on April 12, 2023. Shapella upgrade is actually a combination of two upgrades \u2013 Capella and Shanghai. This upgrade implemented EIP-4895 and enabled validators to withdraw their staked ETH funds. As a result, liquidity of Ether was improved, by making staking rewards accessible. The successful implementation of Shapella upgrade led to Ethereum price rally and regained its $1,900 position in the market.\n\nEthereum Upgrades: What\u2019s Next?\n\nSo far, Ethereum reformed its gas fees and became a sustainable blockchain. The next set of upgrades primarily focus on scaling.\n\nDanksharding is the next significant Ethereum upgrade that uses distributed data sampling to make Ethereum more scalable. This plays an important role in improving scalability. Additionally, it also makes making the network more decentralized by managing vast sets of data generated by layer2 rollups.\n\nProto-danksharding, which is EIP-4844, will be implemented before full danksharding. It introduces temporary data blobs and ensure that they can be seamlessly transmitted. Full danksharding is expected to be completed by early 2024.\n\nApart from this, Vitalik Buterin introduced a 5 phase Ethereum roadmap \u2013 The Surge, The scourge, The Verge, The Purge, and The Splurge. Each phase includes each upgrade of the Ethereum network as follows.\n\nThe Surge relates to the scalability\n\nThe Scourge relates to censorship resistance\n\nThe Verge relates to the verification of blocks\n\nThe Purge relates to reducing the computational costs\n\nThe Splurge includes remaining improvements\n\nNo matter the terminology used by the community, the vision behind these upgrades is the same \u2013 to develop a sustainable, scalable, and secure Ethereum blockchain network!\n\nConclusion\n\nSo far, Ethereum\u2019s journey through its upgrades is nothing short of remarkable. The development team has already achieved a big milestone when they successfully implemented \u201cThe Merge\u201d event. The Ethereum developer team\u2019s commitment to become a more decentralized, scalable, secure, sustainable, and efficient platform is driving its evolution. The network\u2019s ability to transform as per the improvements is its strength. When all the Ethereum upgrades will get implemented, we will see if it becomes a global super computer for the entire planet!\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat are Ethereum upgrades?\n\nThe Ethereum development team is implementing a series of improvements on the network to make the network more efficient and scalable. These improvements are called Ethereum upgrades.\n\nHow long will the Ethereum upgrade take?"

        "content": "Cryptocurrency analyst and trader Ali Martinez is saying that a leading Ethereum (ETH)-based decentralized exchange could be on the cusp of making a significant upside move.\n\nMartinez tells his 33,200 followers on the social media platform X that Uniswap (UNI) \u201cappears to be breaking out\u201d on the weekly chart after invalidating a descending triangle.\n\nA descending triangle is typically considered a bearish continuation pattern.\n\nAccording to Martinez, if Uniswap prints a \u201csustained close\u201d above the price of $5.70, UNI could soar toward $10, a gain of around 62% from the current price.\n\nUniswap is trading at $6.18 at time of writing.\n\nTurning to Polygon (MATIC), Martinez says that the Ethereum scaling solution could witness a sell-off if it fails to break above a crucial price level.\n\n\u201cMATIC has slipped below a crucial supply zone, spanning $0.84 to $0.86. In this range, 14,240 addresses hold over 4.13 billion MATIC.\n\nThe longer the Polygon price remains below this zone, the higher the likelihood that these holders might start selling to avoid incurring significant losses.\u201d\n\nMATIC is trading at $0.772 at time of writing, well below Martinez\u2019s supply area.\n\nNext up is the blockchain oracle Chainlink (LINK). The crypto analyst and trader says that Chainlink could revisit and surpass the 2023 high of $16.62.\n\n\u201cChainlink is in a key demand zone, ranging between $13.80 and $14.20. Here, 11,470 wallets hold a substantial 23.5 million LINK.\n\nWith minimal resistance ahead and solid support below, remaining above this zone could pave the way for LINK to climb to new yearly highs.\u201d\n\nChainlink is trading at $14.34 at time of writing.\n\nTurning to XRP, Martinez says that the fifth-largest crypto asset by market cap could rally between $0.65 and $0.66 as it seems to be breaking out from the range midpoint of a descending parallel channel.\n\nIn technical analysis, descending parallel channels are typically considered bearish, but an asset may still rally to the top of the structure\u2019s range as Martinez\u2019s chart suggests.\n\nXRP is trading at $0.612 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum ICO participant, dormant for over three years, has recently transferred 20,000 ETH (valued at approximately $42.4 million) to various destinations, including a 10 ETH deposit to the Kraken exchange. This awakening of a crypto giant correlates with movements in the Ethereum market that could have broader implications.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis \"whale,\" a term affectionately given to large-scale holders of cryptocurrency, originally acquired 100,000 ETH at the nascent stage of Ethereum's life, during the initial coin offering (ICO). With the ICO price around $0.31, the cost basis of this investment was a mere $31,000, a sum that pales in comparison to the current valuation of these assets.\n\nThe timing of such a move is critical. The Ethereum price chart shows the currency testing a resistance point, attempting to sustain its momentum above the $2,000 mark. The emergence of such a significant player, particularly one initiating transactions of this magnitude, could signal to the market a shift in sentiment or liquidity that may catalyze further price action.\n\nWhile the transfer of 20,000 ETH is substantial, the current Ethereum market cap is vast enough that such a transaction alone is unlikely to cause disruptive market waves. However, it does bring attention to the potential for large holders to move markets. Should this whale decide to liquidate a significant portion of their holdings, it could introduce a substantial amount of Ethereum into the market, potentially putting downward pressure on the price.\n\nConversely, if this whale were to lock in their holdings or disperse them in a way that suggests a long-term hold strategy, market confidence could be reinforced, possibly driving prices upward. The deposit to Kraken might be an initial step toward liquidity, but it does not necessarily predict a major sell-off."

Source: Finbold\n\nIndeed, the digital asset has managed to grow its price well beyond the average of $2,012.38 at which the above-mentioned addresses acquired the amount of ETH reported by Martinez and is not facing any difficult demand walls after its current price point, so his predictions may well come true.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum has powered through key psychological and technical levels, showing an uptick in volatility and attracting fresh interest from investors. The ETH/USD pairing on Kraken has seen a notable upward break, crossing the significant $2,000 mark and challenging the resistance at $2,136, setting the stage for possible future price action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObserving Ethereum's daily chart, one can see a strong bullish trend that has seized the attention of those in the crypto arena. Ethereum has successfully broken past the $2,000 mark, causing a notable surge in market volatility. This is visible in the larger candlestick sizes and increased trading volume, indicating an intense tug-of-war for control between buyers and sellers.\n\nThe $2,136 resistance level adds a layer of fascination, as it has been a point where Ethereum's upward trajectory has been halted in the past. Yet, the current strength of the market, as evidenced by overcoming nearby resistance levels, suggests we may soon see another attempt to breach this resistance. A stable position above this price could herald a new era of price exploration for Ethereum.\n\nThe moving averages on the chart are converging in a manner that traders often interpret as bullish; the 50-day moving average is crossing over the 100-day line. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching levels considered overbought, which could imply an impending pullback as investors potentially begin to lock in gains.\n\nAlso noteworthy is the development of what appears to be a bullish pennant formation, a pattern that suggests a continuation of the recent upward price trend following a period of consolidation. If Ethereum breaks out from this pattern convincingly, it could be setting its sights on previously uncharted territory.\n\nTraders understand that a resistance level like $2,136 is more than just a figure \u2014 it is a zone where multiple trading strategies and orders intersect, thus serving as a critical barometer for market mood. As Ethereum approaches this pivotal level, it will be a true test of whether the market can sustain its bullish enthusiasm.\n\nXRP remains solid\n\nXRP is trading close to a local resistance point, as demonstrated by recent high prices near $0.65. This level is pivotal as it has repeatedly served as a barrier to upward price movements, highlighting areas where the selling pressure has surpassed buying activity. It is crucial for investors to monitor this price point closely; surpassing it could indicate an impending upward surge, reflecting significant buy-side interest and a positive market outlook.\n\nSupport levels hold comparable weight, with XRP's notable support found at approximately $0.55. This price has traditionally acted as a foundation, where an increase in purchasing has helped avert a further decline in value. Investors need to watch this support level carefully, as falling below it may suggest a downward trend is at hand, heightening the liquidation risk for those with leveraged stakes.\n\nAdditionally, the chart includes Moving Average (MA) lines, where a recent \"Golden Cross\" is observed as the 50-day MA (in light blue) ascends past the 200-day MA (in black), traditionally seen as a bullish sign. Nevertheless, with the 100-day MA (in dark blue) still trailing below the 200-day MA, a degree of caution is advised.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is positioned around the middle, not indicating an immediate reversal, as it is neither in overbought nor oversold conditions. However, traders should be wary of any sudden shifts toward the high or low ends of the scale, as such movements could signal an upcoming price change in either direction."

This accumulation represents roughly 1.5% of the total staked Ether volume.\n\nDebank\u2019s data further shows that the protocol\u2019s multi-sig wallet currently holds assets worth more than $335 million, comprising Lido\u2019s staked Ether and MakerDAO\u2019s stablecoin DAI.\n\nControversy Surrounds Blast\u2019s Pyramid-Like System\n\nHowever, the rapid growth of Blast over the past three days has triggered strong criticism within the crypto community due to its pyramid-like Blast points system, which rewards early users based on the number of users they refer.\n\nDetails on the project\u2019s website outline that users receive an additional 16% of points when their referrals bring in more participants and an extra 8% if the subsequent level brings in additional users.\n\nAn intriguing aspect is that the inflows into the protocol remain one-directional, with no option for withdrawal until its slated launch in February next year.\n\nSimon Dedic, the CEO and managing partner of crypto investment firm MoonRock Capital, stated that Blast\u2019s unique selling point is its \u201cPonzi airdrop farming.\u201d He added:\n\n\u201c[To be honest] Blast_L2 is the perfect illustration of why non-crypto people hate Web3. [It is not]a technical advancement to any of the other L2s, nor does it offer any exciting applications to use on top of it. While disabling withdrawals.\u201d\n\nBesides its Ponzi-like structure, attention has been drawn to Blast\u2019s multi-sig wallet.\n\nPolygon engineer Jarrod Watts believes the protocol needs 3 out of 5 signatories to authorize suspicious actions. Watts highlighted that the addresses associated are new and have unknown identities.\n\nHowever, despite the inherent risks, Watts doubts the possibility of fund theft.\n\nSimilarly, Cos, the founder of SlowMist, noted that Blast operates as an upgradeable contract with a 3/5 multi-signature setup and lacks a time lock."

Once the upgrade is done, the only hard work to be done is setting the parameters and attributes.\n\nButerin also argued that they could also employ a voting system so there would be no need for hard forks in the future. The Dencun upgrade will be live early in 2024.\n\nAlso Read: CME Bitcoin Futures Turns Mega Bullish, Rally To $45,000 In Play?\n\nCardano Supporters Mocked Buterin Over His UTxO Statement\n\nAs soon as Buterin mentioned UTxO, Cardano advocates mocked him on the microblogging site X hilariously. Taking a dig at Buterin, Cardano\u2019s founder Charles Hoskinson said that \u201cEthereum 3 will solve it all\u201d satirically.\n\nEthereum uses an account-based model while, UTxO (Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO)-based blockchain) is used by Bitcoin and Cardano. While Buterin praised the UTxO approach, the Cardano army couldn\u2019t stop themselves and taunted why Cardano was doing things correctly.\n\nIn response to a comment, Hoskinson mentioned that Cardano would never be lauded as one of the greatest scientific achievements by Vitalik or the Ethereum team. Furthermore, he stated that Vitalik is rediscovering what Cardano has been working on for a decade and that they are never recognized.\n\nAlso Read: Binance\u2019s Ex-CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao Fights For UAE Return Post Guilty Plea"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price breached $2,100 earlier today, continuing its strong rally that began last month.\n\nMany analysts attribute this latest move to increasing institutional interest and growing confidence in Ethereum\u2019s long-term prospects as it continues to cement itself as the world\u2019s largest smart contract-enabled blockchain.\n\nWith exciting new projects like Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF) launching their presales and gathering momentum, the broader crypto market could have an eventful few weeks ahead.\n\nEthereum Rallies Above $2,000 as Network Growth Accelerates\n\nAfter a dip to $1,900 last week, ETH\u2019s price has rebounded strongly, currently trading 10% higher than its recent low.\n\nEthereum\u2019s uptrend can be attributed to several key factors, including a surge in network activity.\n\nDaily active addresses, transaction fees, and total value locked (TVL) in DeFi have all notched gains, indicating a healthy and growing ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum maintains its dominance in the NFT market, with data indicating an 84% share of the NFT sales volume in Q2 2023.\n\nFinally, there are signs of increasing institutional investment in Ethereum, with prominent mutual fund managers like BlackRock and Fidelity expressing their interest in launching spot ETH ETFs.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s recent lawsuit against Kraken, which did not allege that ETH was a security, has also boosted investor confidence.\n\nWhile regulatory issues remain in the background, Ethereum\u2019s technical strengths and network growth appear resilient as the ETH price rises.\n\nETH Price Outlook Remains Bullish Despite Lingering Competition\n\nWith Ethereum now trading above $2,000, the big question is whether this rally has legs or if it\u2019s becoming overextended.\n\nOn the bullish side, Ethereum\u2019s growing network and development roadmap suggest substantial room for growth.\n\nPlanned upgrades, such as \u201cdanksharding,\u201d have the potential to significantly enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability and efficiency.\n\nOn the flip side, Ethereum faces stiff competition from lower-cost Layer-1 blockchains like Solana and Avalanche.\n\nRecently, SOL and AVAX have shown strong performance, suggesting that investors might consider these tokens as viable alternatives to Ethereum.\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s brand recognition is unmatched, and based on daily trading volume, it remains the world\u2019s third-largest cryptocurrency, behind only Bitcoin and Tether.\n\nIf Ethereum can maintain its standing, a price target of $2,500 before the end of 2023 seems achievable.\n\nAlthough there may be some volatility in the crypto market, especially given the recent fiasco surrounding Binance and its former CEO, the fundamental strength of the Ethereum blockchain can\u2019t be overlooked.\n\nBTCETF Presale Offers Exposure to Highly-Anticipated Crypto Market Milestone\n\nAs Ethereum charges higher, an intriguing new crypto project called Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF) has been gaining traction in its presale phase.\n\nBTCETF is an ERC-20 token that aims to capitalize on the anticipation surrounding the approval of the first spot BTC ETF in the US.\n\nAccording to Bitcoin ETF Token\u2019s whitepaper, the token\u2019s maximum supply is 2.1 million, and 25% will be burned via five milestones related to the launch and growth of these ETFs.\n\nFor example, 5% of the supply gets burned if the SEC approves an application, and another 5% is destroyed once the ETFs reach $1 billion in assets under management (AUM).\n\nBTCETF also imposes a 5% tax on transactions, which will decrease over time and eventually be phased out once Bitcoin\u2019s value hits $100,000.\n\nSo far, the community response to Bitcoin ETF Token\u2019s presale has been very promising.\n\nThe presale has raised almost $1.6 million in under three weeks, leading to coverage from major crypto publications like Cointelegraph and BeInCrypto.\n\nThe presale price is still $0.0058 but climbs higher with each phase, offering investors a chance to get in early on a high-potential project.\n\nIf the first spot BTC ETF does get approved in the coming weeks, BTCETF\u2019s innovative tokenomics and real-world use cases could drive substantial upside, according to analysis from YouTuber Austin Hilton.\n\nFor crypto enthusiasts, this presale could be worth watching closely as it provides exposure to a potentially momentous event in the market\u2019s history.\n\nVisit Bitcoin ETF Token Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nFounder of IOG and Cardano, billionaire Charles Hoskinson, who took part in the creation of Ethereum together with Vitalik Buterin, Joe Lubin and several other individuals, has commented on Buterin's recent ideas about how to improve the centralized Ethereum staking. Cardano founder's comment about Buterin's ideas was pretty sarcastic, though.\n\nButerin wants to redesign Ethereum staking, Hoskinson reacts\n\nIn a recent interview of Vitalik Buterin in Turkey, where he answered questions from the local community, he talked about the Ethereum road map. In particular, Buterin touched on the topic of Ethereum staking as he said that \"there is something to be done about staking centralization.\"\n\nIn particular, he mentioned current issues with multiple staking pools and \"solo staking being hard,\" summarizing that these issues and others about it are \"not really healthy.\" Buterin is considering introducing a redesign to the staking system on his blockchain. As one of the possible solutions here, the Ethereum frontman is considering the UTxO approach, which is based on unspent transactions.\n\nCharles Hoskinson's sarcastic reaction to that was, \"No worries, Ethereum 3 will have it all sorted.\"\n\nNo worries, Ethereum 3 will have it all sorted! https://t.co/Td0Hm58eic \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) November 24, 2023\n\nThis is not the first time that Buterin has spoken about the need to redesign the staking system of Ethereum. Earlier this year, Hoskinson and the Cardano army have several times criticized him for admitting certain inconveniences that the staking system adopted by Ethereum bears and slammed Buterin for considering introducing features that Cardano had implemented already to make ADA staking easier for its users.\n\nWhales stocking up on ETH in big way\n\nAccording to prominent whale transactions tracking platform Whale Alert, over the past 30 hours, several massive chunks of Ethereum have been withdrawn from three major crypto exchanges: Bitfinex, Binance and Coincheck.\n\nAnonymous whales have removed 50,000 ETH, 15,000 and 33,330 ETH from these platforms to their cold wallets, respectively. These lumps of Ethereum are evaluated at a massive $105,740,324, $31,138,359 and $68,795,390.\n\nBesides, another anonymous wallet withdrew 1,498 ETH worth $3.13 million earlier today from Binance, while ETH traded at $2,089. Per @OnchainDataNerd blockchain sleuth account, within the past couple of days, this whale has accumulated 4,770 ETH in total, paying $2,079 per coin on average.\n\nCrypto analyst Ali Martinez believes that currently, whales are going on a big Ethereum buying spree. He shared a chart showing that within the last nine days, big ETH holders have been accumulating large amounts of ETH for the first time in the past nine months. He considers this to be a bullish signal for the second-largest crypto."

        "content": "Blast, a new Layer 2 (L2) solution on Ethereum, has rapidly gained traction in decentralized finance (DeFi). Since its launch earlier this week, it has achieved a Total Value Locked (TVL) exceeding $300 million, per DefiLlama\u2019s data. The platform, created by Tieshun Roquerre, known as \u2018Pacman\u2019 and founder of the NFT marketplace Blur, introduces a unique yield generation model for ether and stablecoins, attracting significant investor attention.\n\nThis development marks a significant step in the Ethereum ecosystem, showcasing the growing interest in Layer 2 solutions. Blast\u2019s approach, focusing on native yield generation, is a fresh concept in the space and has been met with enthusiasm by both investors and users. The platform\u2019s ability to accumulate substantial assets quickly underscores its appeal in the market.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBlast\u2019s Obscure Governance Raises Transparency Issues\n\nDespite its impressive growth, Blast faces critical challenges and concerns. One of the primary issues is the platform\u2019s current restriction on withdrawals. Users cannot withdraw their funds until February 24 next year, raising questions about liquidity and asset control. This limitation could potentially impact user confidence, especially regarding the accessibility of their funds.\n\nThe governance structure of Blast further complicates its situation. Control over the platform is vested in a multisig contract managed by five signers with undisclosed identities. This lack of transparency raises concerns about accountability and trust, particularly in a market where user confidence is paramount. The absence of features such as a testnet, transaction capabilities, bridges, rollbacks, and sending transaction data to Ethereum further adds to these concerns.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Blast\u2019s architecture has been scrutinized for potential security vulnerabilities. Jarrod Watts, an engineer at Polygon, highlighted potential risks in the platform\u2019s \u201cenable transition\u201d function and the \u201cmainnetBridge\u201d contract. These vulnerabilities could, in theory, allow unrestricted access to all staked ETH and DAI, posing a significant threat to investors\u2019 assets.\n\nLegal experts have also discussed the regulatory aspect of Blast and similar projects. The inconsistent application of securities laws within crypto has been a longstanding issue. Legal figures like Gabriel Shapiro and Wassielawyer have expressed concerns over the disparity in the treatment of various crypto projects. While not directly referencing Blast, they pointed out the challenges in navigating the regulatory landscape, especially for projects that might be perceived as publicly marketing securities, including in the U.S.\n\nBlast Impacts Crypto, Raises Market Questions\n\nDespite these concerns, Blast\u2019s introduction of a native yield model and its achievement in TVL signify a notable advancement in the Layer 2 arena. The project, which has received a $20 million investment from entities like Paradigm and Standard Crypto, now ranks sixth among Layer 2 solutions by TVL, according to L2BEAT.\n\nMarc Zeller from Aave commented on the situation, noting the significant amount of TVL in Blast\u2019s multisig compared to other ecosystems. This observation underscores the impact of Blast on the broader crypto market, though it also hints at potential issues in the space.\n\nRead Also: Changpeng Zhao X Account Temporarily Suspended, Then Restored"

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Targets $2,500 As Exchange Outflows Hit $1 Billion In 3 Weeks - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price has been bullish since the pullback to $1,900 earlier this week which had been triggered by the saga surrounding the ouster of the founder and the CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao. Most cryptos rolled back as investors reacted to the developments at the largest crypto exchange by volume.\n\nBitcoin price has since recovered from the dip to $35,650 and is trading at $37,843 at the time of writing. The second-largest crypto Ethereum, up 2% in the last 24 hours is trading at $2,104 considering the cumulative 7.1% increase in one week.\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH Price On The Bullish Offensive Bolstered By Whales On A Buying Spree\n\nEthereum price was able to uphold support at $1,930 backed by immense interest in the leading smart contracts token from whales. According to crypto analyst @ali_charts who shared the IOMAP chart from IntoTheBlock, \u201cEthereum overcame key resistance zone between $1,982 and $2,044.\u201d Approximately 1.67 million addresses purchased 38.7 million ETH.\n\nThe up leg will likely extend toward $2,500 due to the reducing resistance and a strong support zone between $1,982 and $2,044. Holding above this demand area could propel Ethereum price to rally to new yearly highs.\n\n#Ethereum overcame a key resistance zone between $1,982 and $2,044. Here, 1.67 million wallets acquired 38.7 million $ETH. With minimal resistance ahead and solid support below, remaining above this demand area could pave the way for #ETH to reach new yearly highs. pic.twitter.com/mrSKls9N4M \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) November 24, 2023\n\nData from the same blockchain analytics platform IntoTheBlock and shared on X (formerly Twitter) by @C_thumbs revealed that more than 500k ETH has been transferred from exchanges to non-custodial wallets in 30 days. This marked the highest level in three months, bringing total outflows in dollar value to $1 billion in only three weeks.\n\n\u201cOn November 22nd alone, $ETH had a netflow of -148.5k ETH at an average price of $2011. The last time a large netflow like this occurred was on October 30th, after which the price increased 19%,\u201d data by IntoTheBlock paints a bullish picture.\n\nEthereum has crossed the $2000 mark with a significant volume backing its movement. Data from @IntoTheBlock shows that over 500k ETH has left exchanges for non-custodial wallets this month, which is the highest amount in 3 months. This brings the total outflows to $1 billion in\u2026 pic.twitter.com/nUY52QnM5m \u2014 C_THUMBS || \u20bf || (@C__thumbs) November 23, 2023\n\nThe support Ethereum price is receiving shows that it is profitable for investors and traders to take advantage of the dips, which are proving to be highly profitable.\n\nSantiment, another leading blockchain data platform, reported on November 22 that approximately 200 largest Ethereum wallets currently hold a combined 62.76 million ETH with a dollar value of around $124.1 billion, with a third of these tokens accumulated in the last year since November 21. This cohort of holders accounts for at least 52% of Ethereum\u2019s available supply.\n\n\ud83d\udc0b Ethereum Whales on a buying spree! \ud83d\udcb8@santimentfeed reports that the 200 largest Ethereum wallets now hold a combined 62.76M $ETH, currently worth $124.1B! They have accumulated 30.3% more coins since November 21, 2022 and now command 52% of Ethereum's circulating supply! \ud83d\udcca \u2014 OneArt (Crypto & NFT Wallet) (@art_wallet) November 22, 2023\n\nEthereum Price At A Crossroads\n\nThe four-hour chart shines a light on the current technical situation, where Ethereum price is facing resistance from a likely double-top pattern. Therefore, higher support, as established from the fundamental aspect of the market, is paramount for the continuation of the uptrend to $2,500.\n\nIf Ethereum price bows to selling pressure due to the double-top pattern a swing low could follow to sweep liquidity possibly as far as $1,900 ahead of the next breakout.\n\nHowever, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals that buyers have the upper hand. With a strength of 66 and still trending north, a return to the overbought region is plausible and could invalidate the bearish theory for a quick rebound above $2,500.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD pumped higher during Friday\u2019s 24-hour trading session, attempting to break up from an inside bar pattern, while the SPDR S&P 500 consolidated flat.\n\nLike Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin DOGE/USD broke up from its inside bar pattern and was showing comparative strength, holding well above the top of Wednesday\u2019s range.\n\nAn inside bar pattern indicates a period of consolidation and is usually followed by a continuation move in the direction of the current trend.\n\nAn inside bar pattern has more validity on larger time frames (four-hour charts or larger). The pattern has a minimum of two candlesticks and consists of a mother bar (the first candlestick in the pattern) followed by one or more subsequent candles. The subsequent candle(s) must be completely inside the range of the mother bar, and each is called an \"inside bar.\"\n\nA double, or triple inside bar can be more powerful than a single inside bar. After the break of an inside bar pattern, traders want to watch for high volume for confirmation the pattern was recognized.\n\nWant direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial.\n\nThe Bitcoin and Ethereum Charts: Bitcoin and Ethereum created an inside bar pattern on Wednesday and Thursday, and on Friday the cryptos were attempting to break up from the patterns but were rejecting heavy resistance above. A lack of volume was contributing to weakness in the move, which may indicate further consolidation is needed, at least on smaller timeframes.\n\nThe consolidation on Bitcoin and Ethereum, which has taken place since Nov. 10, has helped to drop their relative strength index (RSI) down from overbought territory to under the 70% level. This indicates that Bitcoin and Ethereum could eventually rally further north if bullish volume continues to power the cryptos.\n\nBullish traders want to see big bullish volume come in and break Bitcoin and Ethereum up above Friday\u2019s new high-of-day, which could accelerate upside momentum. Bearish traders want to see big bearish volume come in and drop Bitcoin and Ethereum down under the eight-day exponential moving average (EMA), which would negate the current upward trend.\n\nBitcoin has resistance above at $38,105 and at $39,600 and support below at $35,593 and at $31,862.\n\nIf Dogecoin closes Friday\u2019s 24-hour trading session near its high-of-day price, the crypto will form a bullish Marubozu candlestick, which could indicate higher prices will come again on Saturday. When the crypto eventually prints a reversal candlestick, such as a doji or shooting star candlestick, it could indicate the local top has occurred.\n\nBearish traders want to see Dogecoin fall under the eight-day EMA, which could indicate the downtrend will continue and the local top has formed.\n\nDogecoin has resistance above at $0.083 and at 9 cents and support below at $0.075 and at the 7-cent mark.\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock"

ETH whales have contributed to this rebound, some analysts believe.\n\nEthereum climbs back above $2,000 once again\n\nThe latest ether analysis highlights a new ascent for the world\u2019s second most valuable cryptocurrency. This is partly due to the request for BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum Spot ETF.\n\nETH Rallies Back Above $2,000\n\n\n\nAfter a brief dip below $2,000, Ethereum (ETH) has rebounded and is now trading at $2,075.\n\n\n\nThis rally is being driven by whale accumulation, as large investors have been buying up ETH.\n\n\n\nIs this the start of a new bull run for ETH?#crypto #eth pic.twitter.com/HWdhgq9BqW \u2014 Emily.Eth (@DarrinPayn62301) November 23, 2023 The role of whales in Ethereum\u2019s new performances\n\nIn a recent post, CoinTurk News underscored other factors contributing to these new performances of ether. First and foremost, there are the whales. Santiment, an on-chain data expert, revealed that they have been loading up on ETH lately, more specifically, since November 21st.\n\nIndeed, ETH whales (or institutional investors) have increased their ether holdings by 30% over the past two days. This means that the top 200 Ethereum wallets currently represent a treasure of 62,760 ETH. That\u2019s $129 billion, considering the current price of the leading cryptocurrency: $2,060 per unit at the time this article was written.\n\nAdditionally, the growth in the number of ETH crypto wallets has also been a factor. Indeed, 94,700 new wallets have been created since July.\n\nHeading for $3,000?\n\n$4,878.26 was the price of an ETH during its all-time high (ATH) on November 10, 2021. There\u2019s still a long way to go before reaching this level for Ethereum\u2019s native crypto.\n\nIt must first aim for the $3,000 mark. Some analysts remain optimistic, particularly with an increase in demand for ether derivative products.\n\nMaarten Regterschot from CryptoQuant is among them. According to him, the conditions for an ETH bull run are currently aligned to dream of an ether breakout. He, for instance, noticed a significant influx of money into the derivatives market. An additional $700 million allocated around these Ethereum derivative products can only foster a positive sentiment regarding this altcoin.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that huge quantities of ETH have recently left centralized crypto exchanges (CEXs). Santiment estimates they represent about 20% of the ether supply. And this is not without benefits: reducing selling pressure and confirming an Ethereum bull run.

        "content": "Explore Ethereum's rise, BNB's dominance in the bull market, and the unique community-driven spirit of GameStop Memes in decentralised finance.\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrency, three coins have captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike: Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and the newcomer making waves, GameStop Memes ($GSM). In this article, we will delve into the intricacies of Ethereum mining, explore the bullish trends in the crypto market, and uncover the unique features of GameStop Memes in the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape.\n\nEthereum: The Leading Crypto Ecosystem\n\nEthereum, the pioneer of smart contracts, has long been a frontrunner in the crypto sphere. Its revolutionary blockchain technology has opened the doors to many decentralized applications (DApps) and the world of decentralized finance. Ethereum mining, driven by its proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, continues to be a focal point for crypto enthusiasts seeking to contribute to the network and earn rewards. The demand for Ethereum mining hardware has surged alongside the bull market, reflecting the growing interest in cryptocurrency. Miners seek efficient and powerful hardware to optimize their mining operations, contributing to the robustness of the Ethereum network.\n\nAs the crypto market gains momentum, Ethereum's value has soared, solidifying its position as a powerhouse in the crypto space. The decentralized nature of Ethereum aligns with the ethos of GameStop Memes, a token that champions the spirit of resistance and unity within the crypto community. Positioned as the successor to Wall Street Memes, GameStop Memes carries the torch forward by embodying the disruptive spirit witnessed during the GameStop saga. Its commitment to decentralization aligns with Ethereum's ethos, providing users with a platform that empowers and unites; a 100x possibility.\n\nBinance Coin Surges Ahead\n\nAmid the bull market, Binance Coin has emerged as a powerhouse, backed by the success of the Binance exchange. With innovative features and a robust ecosystem, BNB has become a go-to choice for traders and investors navigating the crypto landscape.\n\nAs Ethereum mining gains traction, BNB's utility in the decentralized exchange (DEX) space adds another layer to the crypto narrative. The bull market has fueled BNB's rise, and its influence on the market dynamics cannot be ignored. GameStop Memes, while acknowledging the dominance of BNB in the crypto market, bring a unique narrative to the forefront. Its focus on community-driven initiatives and homage to the GameStop movement sets it apart, providing enthusiasts with a token that goes beyond market trends.\n\nGameStop Memes Sets Sailing\n\nAs we navigate the exciting landscape of Ethereum mining, ride the waves of the bull market, and explore the intricacies of crypto hardware, GameStop Memes emerges as a beacon of innovation in decentralized finance. Its protocols, driven by a passionate community, stand as a testament to the transformative power of unity and defiance in the crypto world.\n\nIn the crypto landscape, GameStop Memes introduces a fresh perspective. Beyond the mining hardware and market dynamics, it emphasises the community's role in shaping the future of finance. By aligning with Ethereum's commitment to decentralization, GameStop Memes aims to create a platform where every participant plays a crucial role. In the realm of Ethereum mining hardware, GameStop Memes introduces a human-centric approach; opening a door for 100x potential. It's not just about the technology; it's about empowering individuals to be active contributors to the decentralized financial ecosystem.\n\nThe Bottom Line For DeFi In 2024\n\nIn the grand tapestry of crypto, Ethereum, BNB, and GameStop Memes each play a distinctive role in this bull market. While Ethereum and BNB pave the way, GameStop Memes adds a layer of community-driven revolution, reshaping the decentralized finance landscape. As we embrace the future of crypto, GameStop Memes invites enthusiasts to be not just investors but active participants in a movement that challenges norms and celebrates the spirit of decentralized finance. Join the GameStop Memes 100x potential as it is here to stay.\n\n\n\nStay Engaged With What\u2019s Latest About GameStop Memes\n\nWebsite: https://gamestmemes.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GameStopMemes\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/GameStopMemes"

        "content": "The crypto market has been going up for the last 2 months, making it an exciting time to get involved. But finding the best ones through the plethora of altcoins can be a bit tricky. But fear not, this article outlines lucrative cryptos predicted to explode by the end of 2023, highlighting promising options like Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF), Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), Meme Kombat ($MK), and TG Casino ($TGC). So, let\u2019s begin.\n\n1. Bitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF) \u2013 Taking Advantage of Bitcoin ETF Approval Excitement\n\nBitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF) is a new groundbreaking crypto project positioning itself to reap rewards from an impending Bitcoin spot ETF approval. BTCETF features deflationary tokenomics in which 5% of the supply will be burned when major ETF approval milestones are reached. Plus, it also has a sell tax of 5% that discourages selling. Over time, the decreasing supply of BTCETF will increase value for remaining token holders as demand rises.\n\nProminent crypto influencers predict big gains based on the asymmetric risk-reward ratio. This unique deflationary tokenomics explains why analysts are forecasting 10x potential for this brand-new token.\n\nThe BTCETF presale has multiple stages, with token prices going up after each stage. It already got strong traction, with over $1.3 million raised so far. The current stage will end soon, so get in now to get the best price.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin ETF Now<<<\n\n2. Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) \u2013 Revolutionizing Bitcoin Mining with Stake-to-Mine Innovation\n\nBitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) is another promising project that offers a unique Stake-to-Mine model that lets you mine actual Bitcoin through cloud mining power without buying an expensive mining rig. This fits with crypto\u2019s decentralization and accessibility ethos. On top of that, Bitcoin Minetrix also has a stake protocol that enables you to earn substantial returns.\n\nWith Bitcoin\u2019s halving approaching, which could reduce block rewards and profitability, the Bitcoin Minetrix innovative feature might come in handy. Analyzing the prospects, many famous influencers have already gotten excited and indicated strong potential demand.\n\nBTCMTX\u2019s presale has already achieved phenomenal success. Nearly $4.3 million has already been raised, and it\u2019s going up fast. Similar to BTCETF, the presale for BTCMTX is divided into stages, and the current stage will end soon, so be sure to get in early.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin Minetrix Now<<<\n\n3. Meme Kombat ($MK) \u2013 The Ultimate Fusion of Meme and Crypto Gaming\n\nMeme Kombat ($MK) is a new dynamic addition to the meme coin space that fuses gaming and crypto. With an innovative platform, MK allows you to wager on AI-powered meme battles featuring iconic characters such as Pepe the Frog and Wojak.\n\nBeyond battles, the project also has an attractive staking protocol that offers substantial yields. The team plans to unveil Battle Arena post-presale, followed by $MK debut on big exchanges, bringing leaderboards and special events to the first season. As the major meme coins struggle, Meme Kombat has emerged as a promising and exciting option.\n\nCurrently raising close to $2 million in its presale, MK plans to reach a hard cap of $10 million to launch the platform. The price of $MK tokens right now is crazy cheap, so join the presale and get in on the fun!\n\n>>> Buy Meme Kombat Now<<<\n\n4. TG Casino ($TGC) \u2013 Transforming Crypto Gambling with Cutting Edge Features\n\nTG Casino ($TGC) is another rising star in the crypto scene that\u2019s getting a lot of attention right now. This innovative casino comes with a bunch of cool features like an anonymous Telegram-based interface, KYC-free access, and cutting-edge tokenomics. You can experience seamless gambling, all powered by the $TGC token, with incredible perks like free rewards, 25% cashback on losses, and massive staking APY.\n\nBacked by social media popularity and endorsements from influential figures, TG Casino\u2019s unique advantages and deflationary token model make it one of the most effective crypto casinos today.\n\nWith half of the presale sold out already and an impressive $2.5 million raised in just over a month, TG Casino is sure to sell out in no time. So get your share of $TGC tokens now and take your gambling to the next level.\n\n>>> Buy TG Casino Now<<<\n\n5. Ethereum (ETH) \u2013 Community Buzz on the Rise Amid Price Swings\n\nEthereum (ETH) currently hovers below the $2,000 mark, with a 24-hour volume of over $14 billion, reflecting a nearly 15% increase. Recent data from blockchain analytics firm Santiment reveals a notable uptick in Ethereum address activity, signalling positive community engagement. However, technical analysis by Cryptonary suggests a critical juncture for ETH, with a local uptrend line break and resistance at $2,120. While the indicators are showing potential for price movement, caution is advised, with the risk of slipping below $1,935 and testing the $1,800 support level.\n\n>>> Buy The Best Coin Now<<<\n\n6. Solana (SOL) \u2013 Ecosystem Strengthens Amid Price Flux\n\nSolana (SOL) is a high-performance blockchain network that lets you do fast, cheap transactions. Despite a slight drop in SOL prices recently, Solana\u2019s decentralized exchanges, like Orca and Raydium, saw record trading volumes of over $3 billion last week. While SOL is currently trading below $60, its strong ecosystem is growing, and adoption is increasing, indicating more price gains by the end of 2023. However, prices are likely to remain volatile in line with broader market sentiment.\n\n>>> Buy The Best Coin Now<<<\n\n7. Litecoin (LTC) \u2013 Investor Interest and Network Activity Soar\n\nLitecoin (LTC) is a popular digital currency and payment network capable of speedy transactions. After surpassing $74 recently, LTC has fallen below $70 but exhibited resilience in the last four months, gaining 37%. Driven by heightened network activity and investor interest, Litecoin seems to be on its way up. However, LTC must firmly break through the $78 mark before more bullish momentum can begin.

        "content": "In recent developments, Ethereum, a leading cryptocurrency, has witnessed a substantial rise in its market value, surpassing the $2,000 mark and briefly outperforming Bitcoin. However, a growing legal controversy involving Steven Nerayoff, a former Ethereum advisor, has overshadowed this financial surge. Nerayoff has stirred the waters by claiming that Ethereum received preferential treatment from regulators, which he calls \u201cETHGate.\u201d This controversy has emerged alongside Ethereum\u2019s notable resistance levels at $2,080 and $2,090.\n\nLegal turmoil surrounding Ethereum\n\nSteven Nerayoff, who played a pivotal role in Ethereum\u2019s early days, has recently been acquitted of extortion charges. Following his acquittal, he is now turning the tables, announcing a series of lawsuits against the US government and certain key figures associated with Ethereum. His attorney, Michael Scotto, has indicated that these legal actions aim to bring to light substantial evidence concerning regulatory authorities\u2019 alleged preferential treatment of Ethereum.\n\nNerayoff\u2019s legal team is preparing to challenge the allegations of wrongful charges and unresolved financial agreements. They hint at potential whistleblower revelations tied to ETHGate. These lawsuits aim to clear Nerayoff\u2019s name and challenge the narrative surrounding his involvement with Ethereum. While he claims no animosity towards Ethereum, Nerayoff is critical of specific aspects of its evolution and the conduct of some of its leaders.\n\nThe lawsuits are expected to cover claims of malicious prosecution and breach of contract, potentially involving hundreds of millions in unresolved deals. These cases could shed light on incidents involving Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in 2015, along with allegations of fraud.\n\nImplications for Ethereum and Its Leadership\n\nThis legal challenge is crucial for Ethereum as its market value grows. The silence from Ethereum leaders in response to these accusations has only added to the controversy. The crypto community is closely monitoring the potential impact of these developments on Ethereum\u2019s market value and Buterin\u2019s leadership.\n\nSteven Nerayoff has expressed dissatisfaction with the media\u2019s response to his exoneration, and plans to use blockchain technology to release recordings that present his side of the story. This strategy could escalate the crisis for Ethereum, drawing more attention to the platform\u2019s origins and leadership.\n\nIn early 2015, discussions within Ethereum\u2019s leadership, including Nerayoff, centered around a \u201cRescue and Restructuring Plan,\u201d which covered various aspects such as relocation, staff review, compliance, department restructuring, and marketing overhaul. If Nerayoff\u2019s allegations hold, Ethereum might face a significant crisis.\n\nThe Ethereum community finds itself at a crossroads, grappling with potential repercussions on Ether\u2019s prices and growing concerns about its inception and leadership. The outcome of these legal battles and the revelations they might bring could significantly influence the future of Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market."

        "content": "Blast, a Layer 2 solution on Ethereum, achieves a staggering $300 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) amidst rising popularity in decentralized finance.\n\nConcerns over security and regulatory challenges persist, raising questions about the sustainability of such rapid growth in the crypto market.\n\nReflecting on the rapid evolution witnessed in Cointelegraph\u2019s updates on Ethereum\u2019s price surge past $2K, the launch of Blast in Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 sector marks a pivotal point. This new development is a clear testament to the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency, especially within the realm of Ethereum\u2019s network.\n\nIts swift ascension to over $300 million in TVL not only mirrors the initial excitement seen when it attracted $30M in record time, as reported in previous CNF updates, but also signifies the burgeoning interest in decentralized finance. This significant milestone in TVL underscores the growing confidence and enthusiasm among investors and users alike towards innovative solutions within the DeFi sector.\n\nNavigating a Complex Landscape\n\nLuke Broyles\u2019 tweet poignantly encapsulates the prevailing sentiment in the crypto world:\n\nAnyone that claims to know which snowflake will cause the avalanche is naieve. However\u2026 The #Binance $4.3 BILLION fine is a really big snowflake atop a really big pile of snow. Act accordingly.\n\nSelf custody now.#Bitcoin \u2014 Luke Broyles (@luke_broyles) November 23, 2023\n\nHis emphasis on self-custody and caution reflects the broader uncertainties in the market, particularly relevant in the context of Ethereum\u2019s rapid advancements and regulatory shifts.\n\nRapid Growth Amid Innovation\n\nThe remarkable growth of Blast in Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 space is a double-edged sword. Its innovative yield generation model has captivated a wide audience, yet issues such as opaque governance, restricted withdrawals, and potential security risks loom large. These, alongside the broader regulatory challenges that the crypto sector faces, position Blast in a precarious situation.\n\nHowever, Blast faces significant challenges, including opaque governance and restrictions on withdrawals, which raise concerns about transparency and liquidity. Additionally, potential security vulnerabilities and the uncertain regulatory landscape in the crypto sector further add to the complexity, casting doubts on Blast\u2019s long-term viability in the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nMy advice to readers, in the context of Blast\u2019s record-breaking TVL and the concerns it raises, is to maintain a balance between enthusiasm and caution. The platform\u2019s rapid ascent is indicative of its potential, but the accompanying security and regulatory issues underscore the importance of vigilance in this fast-evolving landscape. Investors and enthusiasts alike should be mindful of these factors as they navigate through the ever-changing realm of cryptocurrency.\n\n."
