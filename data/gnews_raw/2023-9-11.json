        "content": "Ethereum Staking: How To Stake ETH Securely\n\nBy Emily\n\nRead 13 min Beginner\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: \u2014 Crypto staking is a key aspect of how Proof-of-Stake blockchains like Ethereum stay secure: To validate transactions, users must lock up 32ETH which acts as collateral if they behave badly, but they also receive rewards as an incentive to behave honorably.\n\n\n\n\u2014 All methods of staking ETH involve earning crypto rewards, but some ETH staking methods offer higher rewards than others.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Whichever staking method you choose, it\u2019s important to DYOR, as staking can involve centralization risks, smart contract risks and more.\n\nDid you know your cryptocurrency can do more than just rest in your digital wallet?\n\nWelcome to the realm of crypto staking, where you can generate passive income on your crypto funds.\n\nYou might be thinking \u201cGreat! Free ETH! What\u2019s the catch?\u201d and, while there isn\u2019t exactly a catch, it\u2019s not as simple as meets the eye. For starters, crypto staking isn\u2019t just for passive income, it\u2019s for actively contributing to the security and operations of a proof of stake blockchain network.\n\nStaking provides the security model for Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks like Ethereum. Put simply, participants lock up a certain amount of their cryptocurrency holdings, known as a \u201cstake\u201d. Then these funds act as collateral allowing them to validate transactions. If they behave well, they receive rewards and if they behave badly, their stake is slashed. This keeps the network safe and secure. But there\u2019s a bit more to it than that.\n\nBefore you dive into staking all your ETH, it\u2019s essential to unravel the mechanics that power it. In this article, Ledger Academy will take you through exactly how staking on Ethereum works, the benefits and risks, and how to stake ETH securely.\n\nEthereum Staking: What Is it About?\n\nEthereum is the second most popular blockchain today. In fact, since its transition, it\u2019s the most popular network using a Proof-of-Stake consensus. Plus, since the network is so popular and it supports smart contracts, it\u2019s perfect for \u2013 not just native staking \u2013 but all sorts of staking apps and platforms. As such, Ethereum\u2019s staking ecosystem is huge and multifaceted.\n\nThe Ethereum Proof-of-Stake system works like many others on the surface. To become a validator, you must stake 32ETH and the funds act as collateral. If you attempt to undermine the system or fail to validate accurately and reliably, you risk losing their staked ETH investment. The staking requirement encourages validators to act in the network\u2019s best interests.\n\nThe reason so many people stake ETH is to earn a passive income. To explain, becoming a validator, or even just funding one, doesn\u2019t require high-performance hardware. So you can start earning rewards with ease.\n\nBut before we get into the technicalities, let\u2019s go back to the beginning and explore the origins of Ethereum staking.\n\nHistory of Staking on Ethereum\n\nStaking on Ethereum was not always possible. At its inception, Ethereum relied on a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, similar to how Bitcoin functions. However, in September 2022, it transitioned to its current mechanism; Proof-of-Stake.\n\nThis was no easy feat. To make the transition, it relied on the creation of a new chain; the Beacon chain. This new Proof-of-Stake chain started out by accepting blockchain transactions from the original proof-of-work Ethereum network. However, to achieve enough decentralization to support the entire network securely, it needed more validators. So, while the beacon chain amassed these new validators, it only allowed the validators to stake and not withdraw. This guaranteed an increase in validators.\n\nBy September 2022, the Proof-of-Stake chain had gathered enough validators to support the whole Ethereum network in a decentralized manner. So the existing Ethereum clients deactivated their mining, block propagation, and consensus logic and these tasks henceforth became the responsibility of the Beacon Chain. Meanwhile, this PoS chain joined together with the rest of the original Ethereum network in an event known as the Merge.\n\nWhile Ethereum used the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism from that point onwards, the transition was only finalized in April 2023 with the Shanghai upgrade. This important network event finally allowed validators to withdraw their staked ETH and cash out on the rewards.\n\nToday Ethereum works as a fully-fledged Proof-of-Stake chain, meaning you can stake and unstake ETH as you\u2019d like.\n\nHow Does Staking Work On Ethereum?\n\nThere are a few key stages of staking on Ethereum: Staking, validating transactions, receiving rewards or punishments, and then unstaking your ETH. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\nStaking Your ETH\n\nStaking on Ethereum involves participating in a process that helps secure the network and validate transactions. For starters, any user who wants to become a validator must generate a key pair, a private and public key. These are known as their \u201cvalidator keys\u201d and they are responsible for identifying the validator and handling reward collection. It\u2019s these keys that any validator will need to sign messages and participate in consensus activities.\n\nFrom there, the user must lock up a minimum of 32ETH in a special smart contract called a \u201cdeposit contract\u201d. This initiates the validator\u2019s participation in the staking process.\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets a little technical. Earning Ethereum staking rewards involves validating transactions. So how does that work exactly?\n\nValidating Transactions\n\nOn the Ethereum network, time is measured in Epochs, which typically last 6.4 minutes. Each epoch has its own validator set, determined by which validators stake the most ETH. Each of these epochs consists of smaller time increments called slots, which typically last around 12 seconds.\n\nWithin these 12-second periods (or slots) validators take turns in proposing blocks. When it\u2019s a specific validator\u2019s turn, they gather transactions under a new block header, then sign them with their validator key. If there are no blocks proposed within a specific slot, the validators attest to the validity of blocks proposed by other validators. To do so, they use their validator keys to sign their support for the block\u2019s validity\u2014just like they would propose a block.\n\nAt the end of each epoch, the validators receive their rewards (or punishments) and the active set rotates. This means new validators with enough stake get their chance to propose blocks and receive rewards, while poorly performing validators are removed from the set. This encourages decentralization, as it ensures no single validator has too much power.\n\nETH Staking Rewards and Punishments\n\nThe amount of ETH staking rewards isn\u2019t fixed and can vary depending on the number of validators participating at any given time. When there are fewer validators, the protocol increases rewards to encourage more people to stake.\n\nThen slashing, on the other hand, is a severe penalty aiming to punish ineffective validators. To explain, if a validator\u2019s stake is slashed, it means they lose a portion of their staked funds, and could even lose their role as a validator. These penalties are awarded to validators who propose and sign two different blocks for the same slot, attest to a block surrounding another one, or if they \u201cdouble vote\u201d two different candidates for the same block. In these instances, 1/32 of a validator\u2019s staked Ether is immediately burned, and a 36-day removal period begins, during which their stake gradually reduces.\n\nUnstaking ETH\n\nSo, now you\u2019ve been validating transactions and earning rewards, but what about withdrawing your staked ETH and rewards? If you want to actually use your rewards, you\u2019ll have to withdraw your stake. So how does that work?\n\nWell, firstly, you must give the system an address to send your stake, and your rewards to. While some validators set this up when staking in the first place, others didn\u2019t, so this is a key step if you actually want to reap those rewards.\n\nNext, you have to initiate the unstaking process, because unfortunately, you can\u2019t just withdraw your stake then and there. A validator who would like to withdraw their stake on Ethereum, must first submit a withdrawal request to the network. Then, they must wait out the \u201cwithdrawal period\u201d, consisting of a minimum of four epochs. After enduring this withdrawal period, validators may move into the exit queue, but this may take some time, as only 16 validators may exit within each epoch. That means if lots of validators want to withdraw their stake at once, they may wait a while in the exit queue.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that once you initiate this process, you will no longer have the power to process or validate transactions and you will stop receiving rewards. That said, once the process is complete, you\u2019ll receive your stake back along with all of your rewards.\n\nWays to Stake ETH\n\nSo now you know all about how staking works on Ethereum, how about staking ETH yourself? Well, there are actually a few different ways to stake ETH and not all of them require a 32ETH investment either. If you want to earn passive income by securing the second most popular blockchain network of all time, there are a few different ways to do so.\n\nSolo Staking\n\nTaking part in solo staking (also known as native staking) means becoming a validator yourself. Essentially, it is a way to participate by helping to validate transactions and secure the network. Instead of relying on others to do this job, you take on the responsibility yourself, and earn all of the rewards that come with it.\n\nTo become a solo staker, you need to invest a minimum of 32 ETH. This acts like collateral to make sure you validate transactions effectively. But that\u2019s not all you will need. You\u2019ll also need a computer that is connected to the internet all the time. This computer must run the Ethereum client, which is essentially the software containing the whole blockchain\u2019s information. If the computer you use doesn\u2019t perform correctly, your stake could be slashed. This means solo staking comes with the burden of responsibility, plus, the barrier to entry is quite high.\n\nThat said, Solo staking on Ethereum represents the gold standard for staking. While it comes with more responsibilities than other methods, it also comes with much bigger rewards. Taking on the staking job yourself means you don\u2019t have to share those precious rewards with any other participants.\n\nHowever, if ongoing responsibility sounds too much for you, it\u2019s not your only option.\n\nStaking as a Service\n\nStaking as a Service allows you to delegate the staking process to a third-party provider, meaning you can earn rewards without managing your own validator node. This is also known as \u201cfunding a validator\u201d and it allows you to leave the more technical aspects of staking to someone else, while enjoying the benefits of native block rewards. With this type of staking, you will still need to set up your validator credentials, generate your keys, and deposit your 32 ETH. However, from there, the service will validate transactions on your behalf.\n\nWhile it offers convenience, this type of staking also involves trusting a validator with your funds. If they behave badly, your rewards will be slashed too.\n\nOf course, fees are another aspect to take into account. To explain, the entity offering this service is doing so to make money themselves. Like any business, they will be using your funds to make a profit. This means you might not be getting proportional rewards to your stake.\n\nThat said, there are countless trusted staking as a service providers that help non-crypto natives earn passive income on their investments, and some are known to be rather lucrative. Rewards with these services are much better than using staking pools.\n\nWhile this method is much more hands-off than native (solo) staking, it still has a big barrier to entry, as not everyone has 32ETH to fund a validator with.\n\nSo what about methods of staking that don\u2019t require as big an investment?\n\nPooled Staking\n\nLike funding a validator, pooled staking allows individuals to earn staking rewards without the need for extensive technical knowledge or running their own validator node. However, it also doesn\u2019t require a 32ETH investment.\n\nInstead of staking alone, you can also team up with other individuals. With this method, the participants can contribute any amount of cryptocurrency to a staking pool. Then the pool\u2019s operator uses the shared funds to participate in native staking. When the operator receives the rewards, it then distributes them to the staking pool participants relative to their initial stake.\n\nUnder the pooled staking umbrella comes another interesting sub-category; liquid staking. To explain, some pooled staking platforms offer users tokens in return for their investment. These ERC-20 tokens are known as liquid staking tokens (LSTs) and they are pegged to the value of the initial asset, meaning stakers can still use their locked-up funds in DeFi platforms and blockchain apps. This is a key benefit as most other types of staking require you to lock up funds in a way you can\u2019t use them.\n\nWhichever pooled staking method you use, it\u2019s important to consider the disadvantages. For example, pooled staking requires stakers to trust the pool\u2019s operator. If the operator doesn\u2019t validate transactions correctly, it impacts all of the participant\u2019s rewards. Another aspect to consider is the pool\u2019s trustworthiness. Many staking pools use smart contracts to pool users\u2019 funds, however this poses a risk. If there is a bug in the contract, bad actors could exploit the weakness and potentially access the pool\u2019s funds.\n\nCentralized Exchange Staking\n\nCentralized exchange staking involves the practice of depositing your cryptocurrency assets on a centralized exchange platform to participate in staking activities and earn rewards. This approach offers a convenient alternative to pooled staking, but it also comes with its own risks.\n\nOn centralized exchanges, you\u2019re generally forced to use the platform\u2019s custodial wallets. This means they retain ownership of the private keys attributed to your account, and therefore custody over your assets. This can cause a problem if the exchange shuts down or closes their staking operations. In this case, you\u2019re trusting the platform to pay out your rewards and give you access to your funds\u2014which may not always happen.\n\nBenefits of Staking Ether\n\nSo now you know all of the different methods of Staking on Ethereum, but what about the benefits?\n\nPotential for Passive Income\n\nThe primary advantage of staking Ether is the opportunity to earn passive income. When you stake Ether on the network, you contribute to the validation and security of transactions, and in return, you receive rewards. These rewards are an incentive for participants to actively support the Ethereum network, making staking a means of generating ongoing income without actively trading or investing in other assets.\n\nRelative Network Stability\n\nStaking Ether is also less risky than staking other crypto assets, as its popularity means it\u2019s less volatile than some other cryptocurrencies. As the second most popular network, Ethereum boasts stability, global adoption, and robust security that sets it apart.\n\nRisks of Staking Ether\n\nStaking Ether comes with its fair share of considerations.\n\nFluctuation Is Inevitable\n\nEven the most stable cryptocurrencies still face market fluctuation, which can significantly impact your staking rewards. For example, if you decide to stake ETH and the price falls, the rewards you receive for staking might not cover the loss from the volatility.\n\nLimited Control of Your Crypto\n\nNext, as long as you\u2019re not participating in liquid staking specifically, your liquidity is essentially locked-up for a period of time, meaning that you won\u2019t have immediate access to those funds. This can be less than ideal when dealing with volatility or market uncertainty.\n\nTrust in Your Staking Platform\n\nFinally, the biggest risk of staking ETH is the platform you choose. Native (solo) staking on Ethereum is generally considered safe\u2014its protocol is well and truly battle-tested. However, other methods of staking come with their own risks. As mentioned, centralized exchanges are controlled by a single entity and retain custody of your funds. Then more decentralized options, like pooled staking use smart contracts, which could potentially be exploited should they have a bug. As a result, it\u2019s crucial to thoroughly research and choose reputable platforms that prioritize the features that align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.\n\nHow to Stake ETH\n\nStarting Your Ethereum Staking Journey\n\nBefore you start staking, one of the most important parts of the journey lies with research and analytics. It\u2019s good practice to keep a record of how profitable your staking experience is, if at all. Remember\u2014cryptocurrencies are volatile assets, and Ether is no exception.\n\nWhen taking so many variables into account, you might find a staking reward calculator handy. This valuable tool can give you insightful projections of the rewards you might accrue. All you have to do is input the numbers and these calculators will analyze the financial benefits associated with different staking scenarios.\n\nAfter that, all that\u2019s left is choosing the method for you, so let\u2019s explain how to stake ETH:\n\nHow to Solo Stake ETH\n\nGetting started with solo staking within the Ethereum network involves several key steps to ensure a smooth and secure process.\n\nFirst, you\u2019ll need to buy some hardware. It is possible to run a validator node on a normal computer, but for peak performance, it\u2019s recommended to dedicate one piece of hardware to validating transactions. From there you\u2019ll have to install the Ethereum \u201cclient\u201d, which is essentially the software that runs the Ethereum blockchain. If you have command line knowledge, you can set it up for yourself. Otherwise, you can use Dappnode to set it up for you.\n\nNext you need to sync both a consensus layer client (concerned with maintaining agreement on the state of the blockchain) and an execution layer client (one that deals with smart contract and app transactions on Ethereum Virtual Machine). This means your computer has to update to the most recent copy of the Ethereum blockchain. From there you\u2019ll need to generate your validator keys and deposit 32 ETH to the deposit contract address. This activates your node, which you can monitor and control using your validator keys. For more information, make sure you check out the Ethereum.org docs on how to run a node.\n\nIf that seems a little complicated for you\u2014fear not. It\u2019s much easier to stake ETH directly through the Ledger Ecosystem.\n\nHow to Stake ETH with Ledger\n\nThe Ledger ecosystem offers several staking options for you to choose from. So, no matter if you have a lot of ETH or just a little, there\u2019s an easy staking solution for you. Plus, when staking through the Ledger ecosystem you also get to keep custody of your keys, which is not currently possible via centralized staking platforms.\n\nWith Ledger Live, you have a few options to begin earning ETH rewards passively.\n\nYour first option is securely and effortlessly fund a validator Kiln. To get started, launch the Ledger Live app, connect your Ledger device, and head to the discover tab. You\u2019ll be able to choose the amount of ETH you want to stake (just remember it needs to be a multiple of 32). Plus, Kiln will take you through all the necessary steps, including setting up your validator credentials and uploading your signing keys.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have 32ETH to spare, you can also access a staking pool via the Ledger ecosystem. Through Lido, you can participate in liquid staking, meaning you can stake whatever you can spare and receive stETH, an LST, in return. This ERC-20 token is pegged to the price of ETH, but is also available for use in other protocols, DeFi apps or blockchain apps. Using this method, you can accrue rewards while using these tokens to continue exploring web3!\n\nBasically, whichever option you choose, staking ETH is completely secure within the ecosystem.\n\nYour ETH Staking Journey\n\nAlthough staking is exciting, it\u2019s important to remember to DYOR. Doing this helps you make smart choices and avoid potentially expensive mistakes. Staking comes in many shapes and forms, and each of them have different requirements, risks and rewards. Choosing which method aligns with your strategy is imperative if you want to navigate the ETH staking space securely.\n\nOf course, if you\u2019re accruing ETH rewards, keeping those safe is of the utmost importance too. Luckily, staking ETH through the Ledger ecosystem means you can benefit from the security of your Ledger device while knowing you can access staking apps directly from Ledger Live. This secure connection and the trusted display on your device allows you to check the validity of any staking transaction before you dive in. Plus, you can rest easy knowing that the keys that control your account will stay safe and offline within the Secure Element chip.\n\nEthereum staking opens up exciting opportunities and rewards, but only you have the power to control how you accrue them. Only you have the power to stake ETH however you see fit; because that\u2019s what true self-custody is about."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nToday, the cryptocurrency market witnessed noteworthy activity as significant amounts of Ethereum's native token, ETH, flowed into major exchanges. According to WhaleAlert reports, a total of 21,938 ETH, valued at approximately $34.78 million, landed in Coinbase's wallets. Shortly thereafter, another 32,500 ETH, equivalent to around $51.3 million, was deposited into OKX, another prominent crypto exchange.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch substantial transfers have historically been interpreted as bearish signals in the crypto space. This common perspective suggests that large holders send their assets to exchanges with the intent to sell, which can exert downward pressure on prices.\n\nIt is crucial to recognize that this interpretation is not absolute and can be subject to market complexities and nuances.\n\nCautious optimism\n\nMeanwhile, Santiment, a notable analytics firm, has provided valuable insights through on-chain analysis. According to Santiment analysis, Ethereum has experienced a shift in the movement of older coins, coinciding with a dip in Ethereum's price to $1,540, its lowest point since March 12. During this period, substantial amounts of previously inactive ETH have begun moving from their long-held wallets.\n\nSantiment's analysis suggests that this shift could signify capitulation, potentially foreshadowing market reversals. This observation adds an interesting perspective to Ethereum's current situation, hinting at a possible price rebound in the future.\n\nWhile the cryptocurrency market remains unpredictable, the influx of ETH into OKX and Coinbase, combined with Santiment's analysis, leaves room for cautious optimism among investors and enthusiasts. In the days ahead, further developments will shed more light on Ethereum's price trajectory and the motives driving these significant transfers."

        "content": "A Matrixport analyst envisions a scenario, where Ethereum price can \u201cmaterially drop lower\u201d by the end of the year.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price can go down to the $1,000 mark should the cryptocurrency decline below $1,500 amid a possible sell-off initiated by FTX creditors. A Matrixport analyst said in a recent research report that FTX creditors could trigger an \u201coverhang for altcoins for the rest of the year\u201d if they get a green light from a US court.\n\n\u201cA decline below $1,500 could bring back the idea that Ether could decline to $1,000 \u2014 a level that would appear justified based on the revenue projection from the Ethereum ecosystem.\u201d Matrixport analyst\n\nThe analyst notes ETH at current prices is below the 50d MA, which is a bearish sign. Besides, Ethereum is underperforming Bitcoin as the trend (20d) MA shows ETH/BTC ratio is decreasing, the analyst added. As of press time, ETH is trading at $1,611, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nSolana funding rate | Source: Matrixport\n\nHowever, ETH is not the only crypto vulnerable to adverse movements in anticipation of FTX sales. Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency SOL is facing a negative funding rate (-14% annualized) and could decline even further, which makes the analyst put significant target levels at $15 and $10. Currently, SOL is trading at $18,4.\n\nYou might also like: FTX looks to claw back millions paid to Shaq\n\nThe FTX drama can even affect Bitcoin (BTC) price. The largest by market capitalization cryptocurrency might squeeze if the August Consumer Price Index (CPI) rises further and the collapsed crypto firm FTX gets approval for liquidation.\n\nAccording to CrypNuevo, the market analyst on X (formerly Twitter), there might be a market-wide \u201cbloodbath\u201d if both events, set for Sept. 13, happen together. Yet, Santiment data indicates investor sentiment is still optimistic for Bitcoin as the ratio of BTC transactions in profit to loss is still positive.\n\nAs crypto.news earlier reported, FTX bankruptcy estate manages a $3.6 billion portfolio in crypto, including around $1.16 billion in SOL and $560 million in BTC.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Ethereum price failed to settle above $1,650 and trimmed gains against the US Dollar. ETH is now trading in a bearish zone and could decline heavily.\n\nEthereum peaked near $1,670 and started a fresh decline.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,620 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could gain bearish momentum if there is a close below $1,600 and $1,580.\n\nEthereum Price Turns Red\n\nEthereum\u2019s price attempted a fresh increase above the $1,620 pivot level. ETH even broke the $1,650 resistance but the bears were active near the $1,670 level.\n\nAs a result, the price failed to continue higher and started a fresh decline below $1,650, like Bitcoin. There was a downside break below the $1,620 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The price even retested the $1,600 support zone.\n\nA low is formed near $1,600 and the price is now consolidating losses. Ether is now trading below $1,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,620 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The trend line is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,669 swing high to the $1,600 low.\n\nOn the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,620 level and the trend line. The next resistance is near the $1,635 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,669 swing high to the $1,600 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe first major resistance is near $1,650, above which the price could rise toward the $1,670 level. The next major hurdle is near the $1,700 level. A close above the $1,700 level might send Ethereum further higher toward $1,750.\n\nDownside Break in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,620 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,600 level.\n\nThe first key support is close to $1,580. The next key support is $1,540. A downside break below $1,540 might start a major decline toward $1,450. If there is a downside break below $1,450, the price could test the $1,320 support level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is slowly gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,600\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,650\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nInstitutions have fallen out of love with Ethereum in 2023, selling upwards of nine digits of the asset in the year to date.\n\nAccording to the latest analysis by CoinShares, the number two cryptocurrency saw $4.8 million in outflows this past week, reaching $108 million in sales this year. That places it as the most sold digital asset by large entities, wrote James Butterfill, head of research for CoinShares.\n\nThe analyst labeled it the \u201cleast loved digital asset\u201d for exchange-traded product (ETP) investors, trouncing its second-place holder, Tron, by more than $50 million.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, all that could change soon after Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest applied for the first spot Ethereum ETF last week\u2014the first of its kind in the United States. And that news comes after the network turned inflationary and on-chain activity plummeted as the grueling bear market carries on.\n\nWhat Ethereum has felt this year is broadly based among digital assets, per CoinShares.\n\nSentiment regarding institutions purchasing crypto remains poor, according to their weekly report published this morning. It showed a fourth consecutive week of selling, with outflows totaling $59 million over the past seven days.\n\nThe current run of outflows, wrote James Butterfill, reaches $294 million, representing 0.9% of total assets under management (AUM).\n\nSelling came primarily from North America, with Canada and the United States offloading $17.6 million and $12.3 million in the past seven days. Germany led the way across the Atlantic and into Europe, with $20 million worth of selling.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nButterfill told Decrypt that the main reason behind the rampant selling is the U.S. dollar. It has shown strength as of late, driven by the \u201cmarket\u2019s belief we are in a soft landing scenario,\u201d posting eight straight weeks of green candles.\n\nEven so, he reckons that as the year ends, it will \u201cincreasingly be seen that this isn\u2019t the case,\u201d especially if high-interest rates kick in.\n\nAlthough the previous report by CoinShares highlighted a bunch of under-the-surface trading, with volumes skyrocketing by 90% to $2.8 billion, this week's trading activity plummeted.\n\nVolumes \u201care super low,\u201d revealed Butterfill, averaging \u201cjust\u201d $2.3 billion daily over the past month, compared to the yearly average of $7 billion. The last seven days were an even further cry from these numbers, dropping by 73% to $743 million.\n\nThis suggests, the analyst told Decrypt, an \u201capathetic investor\u201d\u2014clarifying, however, that the market saw a very similar scenario prior to the last two Bitcoin halvings.\n\nBitcoin was the most damaged crypto asset last week, with large entities offloading a whopping $69 million worth of the asset despite being in the green the week prior.\n\nAdding to the bearishness, Bitcoin short products saw the largest weekly inflows since March, with $15 million pouring into these instruments. \u201cTiming wise this is interesting as the inflows in March also came at a time of heightened regulatory uncertainty,\u201d said Butterfill.\n\nWhat\u2019s to come? Butterfill suspects that many investors are waiting to see what the Fed will do this month with interest rates, with any potential weakness in the dollar \u201clikely to be supportive for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe analyst concluded, however, that CPI could come in above expectations due to the swift surge in gasoline prices. He also pointed to FTX, telling Decrypt, \"There are the FTX asset sales \u2018stock overhangs\u2019 potentially to deal with too.\u201d"

It could go lower. It could go to $600 or $500 or $400, but that is in the cards for Ethereum.\u201d\n\nCowen also says that a move toward his downside targets would mark 2023 as the year when both ETH bulls and bears got \u201csufficiently wrecked.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could have a move where it sort of just slowly fades with some occasional pumps back up to the upside just to get everyone excited, and then down into the end of the year and then pop back up, right.\n\nIt could do something like that \u2013 where it puts in a low, it puts in a high it then sweeps the high, and then sweeps the low. That way, by the end of the pre-halving year, both the bulls and the bears are sufficiently wrecked.\n\nThen you went through the whole year and both sides thought they were right for the whole year, but they were really right for only half the year and the other side was right for the other half of the year, but by the end of the year, everyone\u2019s wrecked.\u201d\n\nThe crypto strategist goes on to say that for the rest of 2023, he expects Ethereum to post lower highs and lower lows.\n\nEthereum is trading for $1,609 at time of writing, a 1.2% decrease during the last 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "According to the blockchain intelligence platform Glassnode, the percentage of Ethereum addresses currently in profit has dropped to approximately 53.5%.\n\nThe downtrend is attributed to Ether\u2019s market performance, whose price has fallen by approximately 13% in the past 30 days.\n\nGlassnode estimated that the last time Ethereum addresses in profit dipped below 54% was on January 12, 2023. The percentage was even less towards the end of 2022 and the first few days of the ongoing year.\n\nOn the other hand, the figure spiked above 70% in May when ETH was inching closer to the $2,000 price tag and in July when the second-biggest digital asset by market capitalization hit that milestone.\n\nMost recently, Ether\u2019s valuation has consolidated at around $1,600 and, similar to many other cryptocurrencies, seems to await a major development to show signs of revival.\n\nHalting the Fed\u2019s aggressive interest rate policy, a decisive win for Ripple in its lawsuit against the US SEC, or the official approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in America are some events that could cause a bull rally in the entire market.\n\nAssuming this happens in the near future, the overall percentage of ETH addresses in profit could spike well above the 70% level.\n\nHowever, the ongoing bearish trend might stay a bit more or even intensify, meaning the Ethereum addresses sitting on paper losses could rise."

From its mid-August peak at $1,850, Ethereum\u2019s price has been on a consistent downward trajectory.\n\nToday, on September 12, the digital asset reached its lowest point in half a year, raising concerns and questions about the factors driving this extended slump.\n\nSpecifically, ETH tumbled to as low as $1,540 at one point in the past 24 hours, marking the first time the cryptocurrency crashed to this price since March 12.\n\nETH\u2019s price drop coinciding with a drop in the coin age. Source: Santiment\n\nAccording to the behavior analytics platform Santiment, Ethereum\u2019s latest dip \u201ccoincided with large quantities of stagnant ETH moving away from old wallets.\u201d\n\n\u201cA continued dip in mean [coin] age while prices drop is a capitulation sign, which foreshadows reversals.\u201d \u2013 Santiment concluded.\n\nWhy is ETH down today?\n\nPer Santiment, \u2018mean coin age\u2019 refers to the average age of all coins or tokens on a blockchain.

        "title": "Pundit Predicts A Significant Price Correction For Ethereum If This Happens - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum continued to trade in a tight consolidation Tuesday, with increasing manifestations of weakness. Last Thursday, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization witnessed a flash crash that dropped its price by about 14% to $1,550 in under 24 hours.\n\nThe decline, primarily triggered by Bitcoin, occurred amidst speculation that SpaceX, helmed by Elon Musk, might have liquidated its entire BTC portfolio. This speculation arose following reports that SpaceX had marked down the value of its Bitcoin holdings by $373 million the previous year. Furthermore, the market sentiment was dampened by news that the SEC had postponed its decision on Bitcoin ETF approvals until 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, following Ether\u2019s unexpected drop, market participants have been trying to speculate about the future of its price, with some predicting the worst is yet to come. On Sunday, prominent cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez raised apprehensions regarding Ethereum\u2019s future direction. Through a tweet, Martinez shed light on Ethereum\u2019s fundamental network aspects, which he claimed exhibited bearish tendencies.\n\n\u201cEthereum network fundamentals are still lagging, signaling a bearish trend!\u201d, he said.\n\nNotably, he singled out a crucial metric\u2014the monthly average of active Ethereum addresses. Martinez\u2019s observation unveiled that this metric fell short of its yearly counterpart, indicating a marked absence of on-chain activity. In Martinez\u2019s analysis, this occurrence bore the classic traits of signalling a frail network state and limited utilization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a subsequent tweet today, the pundit pinpointed a specific price range that he believed could trigger a significant downturn for Ethereum. According to him, \u201cEthereum slipping beneath the $1,600 \u2013 $1,550 bracket for $ETH might set the stage for a significant 37% \u2013 45% correction, targeting $1,000.\u201d\n\nThis projection implied that Ethereum might experience a considerable decline in value, possibly reaching levels last seen in October 2022.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that Ethereum\u2019s technical indicators remain solid, as evidenced by its ability to establish higher highs on the daily timeframe consistently. According to an X user and crypto chartist called Haituando, price is likely to bounce off of the support trendline (black), bouncing back higher.\n\n\u201cTechnical indicators suggest a bullish trend on the horizon. With key resistance levels broken and a series of higher lows, ETH appears poised for an upward trajectory. Keep an eye on developments like EIP-1559 and ETH 2.0 as potential catalysts,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nEther traded at $1,587 at press time after a 2.17% increase in the past 24 hours. On the other hand, its rival, Bitcoin, traded at $25,948, up 3.41% over the same period."

        "content": "If there's a truth about the crypto market that rookie and experienced investors can agree upon, it's confusing to grasp and full of surprises.\n\nWith external factors such as market sentiment and interest rates influencing how cryptocurrencies' trajectories evolve, more is needed than price predictions and a basic understanding of the area to make better-informed decisions.\n\nBull runs have always been long-debated, with camps being split into two categories. Some attest that bull runs are inevitable, always following bear markets. On the other hand, other investors are put off by remarkable price declines, shifting their focus towards other alternatives when cryptocurrency values drop. While the market was marked by falling prices last year and saw investors rush to get rid of their crypto holdings, the same can't be said about the current times.\n\nCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum got off to a strong start in 2023, and many are struggling to re-break psychological marks already reached since the beginning of the year.\n\nExperts consider the last year to be the worst bear market so far. While it may be difficult to believe that the next bull run will be the most explosive one so far, considering the market's poor performance last year, some signs and upcoming events may prove the opposite.\n\nMany experts believe the anticipated bull run will surpass the ones witnessed throughout history. Bitcoin halvings are generally connected to bull runs, while the launch of Ethereum 2.0 is poised to have a transformative impact on the market. Here's what one should anticipate and the insights underpinning this brave prediction.\n\nBitcoin halving\n\nGenerally, Bitcoin halvings have a history of preceding bull runs. They happened a year before remarkable bull markets emerged and tended to display different trends, with certain sectors overtaking others. So far, all three Bitcoin halvings, namely those in 2020, 2016, and 2012 have preceded bear markets in the following years, namely 2013, 2017, and 2021. If the pattern continues, we could expect another growth market by the end of 2024 and well into 2025, pushing investors and traders to accumulate cryptocurrencies and take a different approach than the one that's been reticent and negative towards the cryptocurrency market. This increase may bring the cryptocurrencies' values to staggering heights, improving market sentiment and rewarding those who have bought the dip in hopes of a market recovery.\n\nBear markets don't emerge out of the blue, and it's impossible to predict with complete accuracy whether they will retake place or when they may happen. Generally, they are a consequence of the fact that Bitcoin rewards are cut in half, which limits the selling pressure from miners and leads to supply scarcity. This may boost demand if investors think the minimized supply will bring prices up in the future. Additionally, halving events create a lot of buzz and are embraced by plenty of media coverage, which boosts the audience's interest in digital currencies.\n\nAre halvings vital for bull runs?\n\nWhile past bull markets are historically associated with the three Bitcoin halvings that have occurred so far, which have played a critical role in triggering significant price surges, these phenomena aren't imperative for bullish momentum. The four-year cycle theory may be widely recognized as a catalyst for bull runs. Still, it's critical to understand that more external factors regarding the market's progress are coming into play.\n\nThe market is nowadays abounding with different tokens and coins, each with distinctive features, use cases, and cycles that work regardless of how Bitcoin is doing. Such wide variety has paved the way for profits and growth beyond the leading coin and its four-year cycles, with different subcategories like NFTs and DeFi yield farming.\n\nSome cryptocurrencies may explode at the same time that others stagnate, so a bull run isn't guaranteed to cover every asset. For instance, the meme coin Pepe has witnessed impressive, bullish momentum while most other cryptocurrencies stood still. This example outlines how market dynamics move, enabling different projects to evolve independently of Bitcoin's evolution.\n\nTherefore, it's essential to stay up-to-date with changing regulatory landscapes, media coverage, investor sentiment, and other elements that impact how price trajectories are moving, as well as monitor the market and take advantage of the tools the DeFi world provides for better decision-making.\n\nEthereum 2.0\n\nWhile Ethereum 2.0 was projected to debut sometime now, the final technicalities are yet to be completed, postponing its launch to a later date expected in 2024 or by the end of 2023 in the best-case scenario. After sharding, Ethereum is expected to improve energy efficiency, security, and scalability significantly. Its roadmap includes adjustments and changes that will transform and make the network better performing and more accessible. On the contrary, despite all the enhancements, it is not anticipated that the transition will address the network's high gas fees right away. Some upgrades' effects are seen after a while, taking time to show results.\n\nAnalysts and pundits believe Ethereum 2.0 may kickstart a bull run and boost the coin's appeal as the existent supply will be cut, and it will adopt a \"net-deflationary\" nature. The debut of Ethereum 2.0 may attract the attention of more investors and traders, including financial institutions and large Ethereum holders (whales). Large amounts may be accumulated in the pre-launch period, boosting demand and fueling prices.\n\nThe upcoming network improvements will likely draw in more users, developers, and investors, positively impacting the coin's performance and the whole crypto market. Predictions are that Ethereum 2.0 may fuel a bull run similar to Bitcoin's halving and that the two poster coins will pave the way for what's expected to be the most remarkable bull runs in history.\n\nFinal words\n\nEthereum 2.0 represents a highly anticipated and transformative network upgrade aimed at solving long-standing scalability challenges while sending Ethereum into a new era of growth. Bitcoin's halvings, on the other hand, have to date been linked to bull markets, validating the principles of the four-year cycle theory.\n\nThe two top-performing cryptocurrencies are set to undergo significant transformations that may potentially enhance the overall market's dynamics, so keep an eye on the trends to better understand their performance."

        "title": "ETH Price Can Tank to $1,400 As Ethereum Enters Capitulation - CoinGape",
        "content": "The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum has once again come under major selling pressure with the ETH price tanking over 2% and dropping all the way to $1,540 levels. While the Ethereum bulls tried to put up a major fight above the $1,600 level, they failed to regain the lost ground.\n\nOn-chain data provider Santiment reported: \u201cEthereum experienced a drop to $1,540, a price level not seen since March 12th. During this period, a significant amount of dormant ETH moved from older wallets. This decrease in the average age of ETH holdings while prices are declining is indicative of capitulation, often signaling potential reversals in the market\u201d.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOn the downside, the major support levels for ETH to watch for are $1,550 and $1,370. These are the key support levels where the probabilities of bounce back are higher.\n\nAs of press time, the ETH price did bounce back from the first support zone and is trading at $1,579 with a market cap of $189 billion. On the other hand, if the BTC price continues to fall, the Ethereum price can fall further to $1,407.\n\nOn the flip side, should Bitcoin\u2019s price experience a rebound, it could exert an upward pressure on Ethereum\u2019s price, potentially turning the $1,575 resistance level back into a solid support zone. This could pave the way for Ethereum to surpass the $1,800 mark and reach the significant psychological milestone of $2,000.\n\nEthereum Weighted Sentiment Drops\n\nSantiment\u2019s data indicated an increase in the age consumed metric earlier this month, but it has remained relatively stable since then. This lack of significant selling activity from long-term holders in recent days has been notable.\n\nThe overall market sentiment appeared pessimistic, and there was a decline in the mean coin age. These factors collectively underscored the bearish sentiment in the market and suggested that ETH was likely not in an accumulation phase.\n\nOn August 23rd, there was a substantial outflow of ETH from exchanges, although there haven\u2019t been many noteworthy outflows since that time."

        "title": "Ethereum Layer 2: A Simplified Overview - Blockchain.News - Blockchain.News",
        "content": "Ethereum Layer 2 projects, such as Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync, aim to increase transaction throughput and reduce costs while maintaining security and decentralization properties. L2 solutions operate atop the existing blockchain, allowing for off-chain processing and a more scalable approach. They offer lower transaction costs, improved transaction capacity, and maintained security. Types of L2 solutions include rollups, state channels, and plasma. Projects like Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync are pioneering the L2 space, aiming to improve Ethereum's efficiency and scalability.\n\nCommon Ethereum Layer 2 projects include Optimism, Arbitrum and zkSync. Tokens from some of these projects, such as ARB (Arbitrum) and OP (Optimism), have been available for trading. This article aims to explain the concept of Layer 2 in straightforward terms.\n\nAs blockchain technology continues to evolve, Ethereum has established itself as a leader in smart contracts and decentralized applications . However, its growing popularity has brought about challenges, particularly in terms of scalability and transaction costs. To address these issues, Layer 2 (L2) solutions were introduced, designed specifically to navigate these hurdles.\n\nWhat is Layer 2 (L2)?\n\nLayer 2, often abbreviated as L2, refers to a secondary framework or protocol built atop the existing blockchain (Layer 1 or L1). The primary objective of L2 solutions is to increase transaction throughput and reduce associated costs, all while maintaining the security and decentralization properties of the main chain.\n\nThe Basics: Layer 1 vs. Layer 2\n\nLayer 1 (L1) is the foundational blockchain layer. Think of Ethereum or Bitcoin; these are L1 blockchains. They form the bedrock upon which L2 solutions are constructed. L1 handles the core consensus, maintains the network's security, and records all transactions.\n\nLayer 2 (L2), on the other hand, operates atop L1 and can process transactions off-chain or in a more scalable manner. The results are then settled back onto the main chain, ensuring the security and immutability of the primary blockchain.\n\nThe Promise of Layer 2\n\nLowered Transaction Costs: L2 solutions, by handling numerous transactions off-chain and consolidating them into one L1 transaction, can markedly decrease the expense of each transaction.\n\nImproved Transaction Capacity: Compared to conventional L1 blockchains, L2 solutions are capable of processing a greater volume of transactions every second (TPS), tackling a primary concern in the world of cryptocurrency.\n\nMaintained Security: Even though transactions might be processed off-chain, they eventually settle on the main chain, inheriting the security properties of L1.\n\nDiving Deeper: Types of Layer 2 Solutions\n\n1. Rollups: These are a popular L2 solution where transactions are processed off-chain and then bundled or \"rolled up\" into a single transaction that's recorded on L1. There are two main types of rollups:\n\nOptimistic Rollups: Transactions are assumed to be valid unless proven otherwise. If a transaction appears suspicious, it can be challenged and verified.\n\nZero-Knowledge Rollups (ZK-Rollups): These use cryptographic proofs to validate transactions off-chain. Only the proof, which is much smaller in size, is submitted to L1.\n\n2. State Channels: These are off-chain corridors where multiple transactions can occur between participants. Once the series of transactions is complete, the final state is settled on the main chain.\n\n3. Plasma: A framework that allows for the creation of child chains branching from the main chain. These child chains can operate independently and report back to the parent chain periodically.\n\nLayer 2 in Action\n\nSeveral projects are pioneering the L2 space:\n\nArbitrum: An Optimistic Rollup solution aiming to make Ethereum transactions more cost-effective.\n\nOptimism: Another Optimistic Rollup, focusing on scaling Ethereum and enhancing its overall efficiency.\n\nzkSync: A ZK-Rollup platform that offers a scalable, low-cost solution for Ethereum transactions.\n\nConclusion\n\nLayer 2 solutions represent a promising step forward in addressing the scalability and cost issues associated with current blockchain networks. As these solutions continue to evolve and mature, they could pave the way for broader adoption of blockchain technologies and a more efficient decentralized future.\n\nDisclaimer & Copyright Notice: The content of this article is for informational purposes only and is not intended as financial advice.

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Becomes Inflationary Again, Here's Why - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAfter the activation of EIP 1559 (periodic burn of Ethereum (ETH) fees based on network activity dynamics), Ethereum (ETH) became deflationary, as the number of tokens issued is lower than number of ETH burned. However, the dramatically low on-chain activity puts an end to this status of second largest cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum (ETH) becomes inflationary thanks to market exhaustion\n\nIn the last 30 days, Ethereum (ETH) registered a net increase in the number of coins in its supply. A total of 63,490 Ethers (ETH) were burned, while 65,548 Ethers (ETH) were issued. As such, 2,058 \"new\" coins were added to Ethereum's (ETH) circulating supply, per statistics tracked by Ultrasound Money analytical dashboard.\n\nImage by Ultrasound Money\n\nAfter the activation of Ethereum's EIP 1559 mechanism, such periods of \"inflationary\" status occur periodically. The ongoing \"dip,\" though, is a special one: the Ethereum (ETH) burn rate declines faster, so the delta between the \"ETH issued\" and \"ETH burned\" numbers increases aggressively.\n\nIn the past year, the Ethereum (ETH) supply has fallen by over 300,000 ETH thanks to the activation of EIP 1559. The ongoing anomaly should be attributed to super-low activity of Ethereum (ETH) accounts.\n\nAccording to multiple trackers, ETH gas metrics are close to 2023 lows or have even dropped below them. For instance, CoinMetrics sees a mean ETH fee below $2.5, which is the lowest level since January 2023.\n\nOne OpenSea sale can therefore be confirmed for as low as $3, while on-chain swaps via Uniswap (UNI) will be charged with $7.6.\n\nMEV bot became top Ethereum (ETH) gas spender\n\nAmid the apathetic performance of on-chain actors, MEV bot becomes the most productive spender of Ethereum (ETH) gas. As covered by U.Today previously, Jared From Subway, the operator of the most effective MEV bots, paid over $70 million in gas since being launched in February 2023.\n\nThe bot made over 1.1 million transactions but paid more in gas fees than the wallets of exchanges that used Ethereum (ETH) 10 times more frequently.\n\nPer the statistics, during periods of pale market performance, Ethereum (ETH) MEV bots \u2014 mechanisms for frontrunning transactions by paying extra gas fees \u2014 might be responsible for 80-90% of top DEXes' trading volumes."

        "title": "Ethereum Futures ETF approval could be a game-changer for Polygon, Uniswap, and Everlodge - crypto.news",
        "content": "There is excitement about the potential approval of an Ethereum Futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), possibly as soon as October. This decision could have a significant impact on crypto. Several tokens, including Polygon (MATIC), Uniswap (UNI), and Everlodge (ELDG), may have their growth potential but will likely respond positively to this development.\n\nPolygon addresses scalability on Ethereum\n\nPolygon, known for its solutions to improve Ethereum\u2019s scalability, is crucial in addressing the network\u2019s scalability challenges.\n\nIf Ethereum Futures ETFs are approved, it could underscore the importance of such scaling solutions, potentially benefiting MATIC.\n\nYou might also like: Shiba Inu\u2019s Shibarium reemerges after initial setbacks\n\nRecently, Mihailo Bjelic, one of Polygon\u2019s co-founders, suggested that Shiba Inu consider using its zkEVM to enhance the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nWhile Shibarium\u2019s functionality has been restored, the co-founder recommended that mainnet applications consider transitioning to layer-2.\n\nWith more investors considering Ethereum thanks to ETF accessibility, Polygon\u2019s infrastructure might find more adoption. As a result, analysts hold a positive outlook for MATIC, projecting prices to reach $0.87 by December 2023.\n\nUniswap could benefit\n\nUniswap, a popular decentralized exchange (DEX) on Ethereum, stands to gain from the potential Ethereum Futures ETF approval.\n\nAs more traders adopt Ethereum, Uniswap\u2019s role in offering liquidity for these assets could become more critical. This could increase trading activity and boost UNI prices.\n\nYou might also like: Uniswap v4 code now available on GitHub\n\nUniswap has recently announced the development of Uniswap V4, which will soon be deployed. With this update, the DEX will introduce features like configurable liquidity, providing users with greater flexibility.\n\nAs Uniswap continues to improve its infrastructure, UNI holders can expect more utility and potential growth.\n\nConsequently, experts predict UNI to range between $7.69 and $8.44 by the end of 2023.\n\nEverlodge is digitizing real estate\n\nEverlodge, a player in the real estate market, has an interesting take on the potential impact of the Ethereum ETF approval.\n\nWhile not directly tied to Ethereum, the broader adoption of blockchain could spark greater interest in digital real estate assets. As a result, Everlodge\u2019s property marketplace could attract more users.\n\nPresently, Everlodge is creating a property marketplace to solve real estate challenges. One significant issue in the real estate market is the high entry barrier for small investors.\n\nEverlodge addresses this by fractionalizing property-backed non-fungible tokens (NFTs), allowing anyone to own a share for just $100.\n\nYou might also like: Crypto insiders focusing on Monero, Aave, and Everlodge\n\nEverlodge also introduces liquidity to the traditionally illiquid real estate market. They digitize, tokenize, and fractionalize properties like villas and hotels into NFTs. This enables users to trade or sell their ownership shares at any time on the Everlodge secondary marketplace, providing increased liquidity and flexibility.\n\nAccess to benefits like free nightly stays, staking rewards, and discounts is granted to those holding ELDG, the native token of Everlodge.\n\nEverlodge is currently in stage 2 of its presale, priced at $0.016. With strong connections to the $280 trillion real estate market, ELDG has the potential for rapid growth, possibly outpacing Polygon and Uniswap.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on ELDG, expecting the token to rally on launch day and when it lists on tier-1 centralized exchanges.\n\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale\n\nWebsite: https://www.everlodge.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/everlodge\n\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Predicted to Drop to $1K Due to FTX Creditors\u2019 Sales - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "In its latest prediction, Matrixport, a financial services network, released a report forecasting a dramatic dip in Ethereum\u2019s prices, potentially to $1K, catalyzed by FTX creditor liquidation.\n\nPer Matrixport, ETH revenues have been disappointing, as the coin broke below the $1,650 and $1,600 supports. Matrixport cautioned of possible decline towards and below $1,500, potentially heralding a nosedive to $1,000, based on the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s revenue projections.\n\nThe network mentioned FTX creditor\u2019s altcoin sales among the primary drivers of Ether\u2019s price dip to $1K.\n\nEthereum Supply Shock to Drive Plunges\n\nFTX holds at least $90 million worth of Ethereum, translating into over 56K ETH. The injection of these myriads of ETH in the market will cause a supply shock, possibly driving the asset to $1K.\n\nPer the report, Ethereum saw an issuance of 15K ETH last week, more than the number of tokens burned 11K. The data implies an increase in the total number of circulating ETH last week. In the last 30 days, the number of issued and burned ETH was 799K and 783K, respectively, suggesting a 0.01% growth in supply.\n\nThrowing the FTX ETH sales into the mix alongside the already surging supply could add fuel to the fire, tipping the scales towards a forecasted price plunge.\n\nDespite holding $3.4 billion in crypto assets, reports indicate that FTX will liquidate about $200 million weekly. This means not all the 56K ETH will be released in the market in a single shot.\n\nAs Matrixport hints of looming price declines, Ethereum has been rallying today, gaining 1.3% in the past 24 hours. ETH is currently trading at $1,613, having touched a 24-hour low of $1,539. The $1,600 mark has turned from support to resistance.\n\nIn light of Matrixport\u2019s forecast, the more likely scenario once FTX begins to liquidate is a nosedive, thrusting ETH below the support points at $1504 and $1400 and effectively sending Ethereum towards the $1K mark.\n\nIncoming Altcoin Crash?\n\nAside from Ethereum, Matrixport\u2019s outlook predicted that other altcoins could suffer major plunges. For instance, Solana, which recently broke below the $19 support level, shows signs of further strains.\n\nFTX currently holds approximately $685 million in Solana. Significant sell-offs have the potential to push the coin\u2019s value below $15 and towards $10.\n\nThe firm has also expressed concern about the upcoming ApeCoin (APE) unlocks, allowing insiders to sell another 11% of the tokens this week."

        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nWhile thousands of cryptocurrencies are available, a select few stand out as potential leaders poised to dominate the market in 2023. Among them are Ethereum (ETH), PancakeSwap (CAKE), and Everlodge (ELDG). Each of them now offers unique features and solutions to address the evolving needs of the crypto ecosystem.\n\nSummary\n\nEthereum price prediction\n\nPancakeSwap gains attention after its Base launch\n\nEverlodge to soar by 118% soon\n\nJoin the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives\n\nEthereum (ETH): A Crypto Giant\n\nEthereum (ETH), often called the \u201cking of smart contracts,\u201d remains at the forefront of cryptocurrency.\n\nMoreover, recent developments like Greyscale Bitcoin Trust\u2019s victory in a lawsuit against the SEC signal growing regulatory clarity for the broader crypto market. As a result, this could benefit the Ethereum blockchain and its ecosystem.\n\nThese factors and Ethereum\u2019s continuous innovation solidify its position as a top choice for long-term crypto investors. Due to all these reasons, market analysts remain bullish for Ethereum. In fact, they predict that the Ethereum price may reach $2,335.71 within Q4 of 2023.\n\nPancakeSwap (CAKE): To Continue Ruling the DeFi Space\n\nPancakeSwap (CAKE) has established itself as a decentralized finance (DeFi) sector leader. Operating on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), the PancakeSwap exchange offers fast and low-cost transactions compared to Ethereum. Its automated market maker (AMM) platform enables users to swap, stake, and farm various cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn recent PancakeSwap news, it announced it had launched v3 on the Base L2 blockchain. With the most recent network launch, DeFi users can access PancakeSwap\u2019s numerous features and competitively low swap costs.\n\nAs a result, experts are confident PancakeSwap could see sustained growth down the line. Some even forecast that its price could be between $1.73 and $1.96 by December 2023.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG): A Hidden Crypto Gem\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) is poised to disrupt the real estate market in 2023. This innovative property marketplace will digitize and mint high-end villas and hotels into NFTs. Not only that, Everlodge will then fractionalize these NFTs. As a result, it enables anyone to fractionally own a property on the blockchain for prices as low as $100.\n\nAlso, real estate transactions are notorious for lacking transparency, complex processes, and vulnerability to fraud. Everlodge employs blockchain\u2019s inherent transparency and immutability to create a secure and trustworthy environment for property transactions. Also, it stores all titles, deeds, and ownership details in the metadata of the smart contract.\n\nAnother exciting aspect of Everlodge is its Rewards Club, which allows you to earn free nightly stays across all its properties. Depending on your tier within the club, you can access a fixed number of free nights each year. Furthermore, anyone can resell the nights they do not mean to use for a passive income stream.\n\nHowever, only ELDG native token holders gain access to this club. For this reason, countless individuals are flooding the Everlodge presale, which is now in Stage 2. One ELDG token costs just $0.016 \u2013 a 60% rise from its beginning price. Additionally, market analysts are confident that Everlodge could surge by 118% and reach $0.035 before the presale ends.\n\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale\n\nWebsite: https://www.everlodge.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/everlodge"

The move aims to develop a version 2.0 omnichain DEX, integrating centralized finance and decentralized finance sectors. WOOFi Pro will offer a mobile-friendly interface, gasless orderbook trading, and integration with Orderly Network's order books. The platform is set to launch with 10 crypto trading pairs in October.\n\nWOOFi, a leading decentralized exchange platform owned by Woo Network, has announced its strategic shift from the NEAR Protocol to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible networks. This transition is aimed at the development of its version 2.0 omnichain DEX.\n\nWOOFi's decision to transition was unveiled at TOKEN 2049. Jack Tan, WOO's Founder and CEO, emphasized that this move is indicative of a more robust offering in both centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) sectors. Tan envisions a seamless integration between the two crypto exchange realms in the upcoming bull run. WOOFi's objective is to amalgamate major chains, centralize liquidity, and foster a cooperative ecosystem. This will enable WOOFi Pro users to trade across their preferred applications and blockchain networks. For instance, a trader on Arbitrum can execute trades against counterparts on chains like Polygon or Optimism without exiting Arbitrum.\n\nWOOFi Pro's design leverages the platform's extensive experience in developing trading products. It promises a mobile-friendly interface, allowing traders to conduct transactions seamlessly. WOO X, WOOFi's centralized exchange counterpart, boasts a daily trading volume ranging between $150 million to $500 million. It has been at the forefront of several industry innovations, including the introduction of a live transparency dashboard. This initiative is geared towards preserving the trust of its expanding community of professional traders. One of the standout features of WOOFi Pro is its gasless orderbook trading, which eradicates transaction fees. This not only enhances accessibility for users but also negates the requirement for Know Your Customer (KYC) verification. Furthermore, users maintain complete autonomy over their funds, eliminating dependence on external custodians.\n\nAnother noteworthy integration is with Orderly Network's institutional-grade order books. This ensures that users have consistent access to a substantial liquidity pool. Orderly Network, a decentralized liquidity network, has garnered support from notable backers such as Pantera, Dragonfly Capital, and Sequoia Capital China.\n\nTan highlighted the synergy between WOO X and WOOFi, stating, \"The combination of WOO X and WOOFi provides users with a fully-featured off-chain or on-chain orderbook trading system.\" He further observed an uptick in traders seeking both traditional and cryptocurrency trading avenues. This trend has been particularly evident in the recent cycle, with a pronounced inclination towards Real World Assets (RWAs).\n\nWOOFi Pro is set to debut with 10 crypto trading pairs in its October mainnet launch. However, there are plans to diversify its asset offerings, potentially including cryptocurrencies, stocks, commodities, and forex. To date, WOOFi has successfully facilitated over 2.9 million cross-chain swaps. With the platform's user-friendly interface, it is anticipated that this number will surge as users can effortlessly navigate the ecosystem and diversify their asset portfolio with a single click.\n\nDisclaimer & Copyright Notice: The content of this article is for informational purposes only and is not intended as financial advice.

Ameline oversees investor relations and general DAC operations for Metis, an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution. On Twitter, the project was hijacked and used to send fraudulent links that allowed some followers\u2019 wallets to be stolen.\n\nCyber Threats Lurking at Every Turn\n\nThe use of this attack vector by T-Mobile has occurred previously. The telecom corporation was sued in 2020 for allegedly allowing a series of SIM-swap hacks that resulted in the theft of $8.7 million worth of cryptocurrency.\n\nIn February 2021, a client who had suffered a second SIM-swap attack and lost $450,000 in Bitcoin sued T-Mobile again and in July, T-Mobile was again being sued over claims that it did not take adequate precautions to prevent a SIM switch scam that cost one client $55,000 in lost Bitcoin.\n\nSIM-swap attacks increased in 2022, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigations . Over $72 million in losses were caused by this attack vector, an increase of $4 million from the previous year. The heart of the hack attack is when a perpetrator fools cellular service representatives, obtains crucial personal information and then redirects a victim\u2019s mobile number to their device.\n\nFeds Want $5.2 Million in Bitcoin Stolen in Sim Swap\n\nLast week, a federal judge approved an order, requiring Ahmad Wagaafe Hared to hand over $5.2 million in Bitcoin that he stole back in 2016. Hared and two accomplices devised a SIM-swapping operation between 2016 and 2018 that resulted in the theft of the automobile and the Bitcoin.\n\nMillions of dollars\u2019 worth of Bitcoin that were taken from crypto industry executives four years ago by a teen hacker are now being seized by the U.S. Department of Justice. The sports automobile he purchased with the stolen Bitcoin is also being sought after by the prosecution.\n\nIn 2016, Harred, who was 18 at the time and was a resident of Tucson, Arizona, collaborated with Nevada-based co-conspirator Matthew Gene Ditman to deceive customer service agents of cell phone companies into divulging information about the SIM cards linked to the accounts of cryptocurrency executives in northern California.\n\n2019 saw the end of the scam after the FBI tracked down Harred and Ditman and apprehended them. The two have not yet received sentences.\n\nCrypto Executive Faces $6.3 Million Loss in Audacious SIM-Swap Attack\n\nBart Stephens, a pioneer in the cryptocurrency sector and managing partner of Blockchain Capital, filed a lawsuit against an unnamed bad guy last month. Stephens claimed he was the victim of a SIM-swap attack that resulted in a $6.3 million cryptocurrency hack.\n\nThis lawsuit served as yet another somber reminder of the ongoing cyber risks that prominent crypto advocates must deal with.\n\nIn the official complaint, the hacker, who goes by the alias Jane Doe, planned a complex SIM-swap attack against Stephens on May 14.\n\nThe criminal was able to bypass security measures with Stephens\u2019 cell service provider by using data obtained from the dark web and other online sources. Finally, Stephens\u2019 cell phone number was forwarded to a new device by the hacker.\n\nAfter the successful SIM switch, the hacker wasted no time in moving on.\n\nBy using Stephens\u2019 mobile number as a backdoor, they were able to reset the passwords for numerous crypto wallets by getting over two-factor authentication restrictions. The hacker boldly transferred $6.3 million in digital assets from these to individual cryptocurrency vaults.\n\nCryptocurrency owners and the general public must exercise caution in a climate where cyber heists, particularly SIM-swap assaults, are on the rise.\n\nOne can combat such malevolent activities by adhering to FBI suggestions , such as avoiding oversharing financial details online and using strong multi-factor authentication techniques."

        "title": "Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Outlines Way for Blockchain 'Privacy Pools' to Weed Out Criminals - CoinDesk",
        "content": "Let's talk about a new evolution on the privacy front that begs the question, can Blockchain protocols distinguish between honest folks and criminals? A recently published paper authored by the co-founder of Vital Bitter and four others say that they can by using a new technological feature called privacy Pools. Joining us now is one of the authors of the paper called Blockchain privacy and regulatory compliance towards a practical equilibrium analysis. Chief scientist Yacob Ilo, welcome to the show, Yacob. Thank you and thanks for having me. Thanks for being here with us. Now we're talking about this paper, it studies privacy pools which is a smart contract based privacy enhancing protocol that separates, like I said in my intro, honest users, good actors from bad actors explain to us like we're five years old, how this works. So the main idea here is to how do we achieve some sort of financial privacy on the Blockchain, right? The the Blockchain or many blockchains anyway are inherently um transparent. Um And there's been attempts for that uh for trying to achieve that if you have something like tornado cash, right? But um what happened with tornado cash was that it all of a sudden started allegedly being used for large amounts of money laundering, right? And so you have all these users that are using this to achieve some level of privacy and now they have no way of saying, hey, I'm not these actors that are sending funds to launder money through this protocol. And so what privacy pools can do is that it can actually allow you when you are pulling funds out of this smart contract, you can dissociate from any kind of activity that you want. So you can actually pick and choose and say, hey, I'm pulling out funds and I'm doing it with some degree of um anonymity and privacy, but I am not what some of these funds over here. And that's the main uh innovation that's here. So the, the part that I I I'm trying to grapple here is of course that we've always been told that crypto the whole thing is it's not anonymous, it's synonymous. Um So why would one need to have all of this? Uh you know, is it, what's the necessity, isn't, isn't there enough privacy already built in that? We don't need this extra layer? I think, I don't think so. I think, you know, it's, it's kind of like if you want to interact with your web banking, you also use encryption on the network, right? You're not just sending all your details when you're interacting with your bank so anybody can read what you, um, what you're doing and it's similar on the Blockchain, right? Even though we have the pseudonym, pseudonym that we have on the Blockchain. Um, like, let's say that you go, I'll take an example, like we use in the paper. Like, let's say you go to a restaurant and you decide to, to pay for some food. Right? You might take a picture of what you are eating. People can see kind of what that meals cost. And so if you already know the address of the restaurant on the Blockchain, you can actually go and do some kind of analysis and figure out well, what, what likely wallet did actually pay for your meal. And now all of a sudden somebody has access to all the financial transactions that you have ever done. And I don't think that that's a good space to be. I don't think that's what we are. Uh that's what we want. So we want some, some way of achieving some level of like privacy while you're, you know, uh shielding your financial transactions. Note to self, don't take photos of food and restaurants. Lawrence. Lawrence has a secret food blog somewhere that we'll, we'll find at some point. All right, before you do. Yes. Yeah, I, I want to talk about the, how this actually works because when we read the paper, it sounds like you need large sets of users who actually care about preserving their privacy for this to work. So how like is how do you are those people out there already? Are there people who care enough about this to participate in the pools to provide that anonymity for the group? I I believe so. I think that, you know, you can see there were a lot of users if you look at the activity of tornado cash ever since it got placed on the O A sanctions list, like the activity has gone down tremendously. I think there's a lot of people that wanted uh some kind of privacy but are now shying away from that kind of technology and are looking for alternatives. And so I do think that those users are there and I think that if there is some kind of technology that that gives you that way you can still dissociate from activity that you don't want to be associated with, then I think more people will pick it up. And that's mainly the goal is to try to bring forward technologies that can bring more people into the Blockchain space. Um So can you can you kind of walk us through exactly what, what, how this is implemented or how it will be implemented the time frames? Uh you know, how far along are people when it comes to this? And you know, what, what kind of timeline are we expecting? But I think first off, what exactly is it, how does it work? Yeah. So the technology is already around the technology relies on zero knowledge proof, which is like instrumental in many Blockchain technologies to try to achieve some level of privacy. So what that means is that basically in, in, in ordinary English, a zero knowledge proof means that you can prove something that everybody can verify is correct without actually revealing the information for people to know how, how you how you could make that proof. So basically what you are saying is that you're withdrawing funds, you are depositing funds into a protocol that everybody can see the funds flowing in. Now, when you pull out funds, you can prove in zero knowledge that you have access to pull some funds out of this pool, but you don't have to reveal exactly which funds the the s knowledge proof just says my funds are actually in the pool and I can pull them out legitimately. And now what we add on with private pools is that you can not just say I have funds in the pool, but you can say I have funds in the pool and they are part of this set. We call them an as an association set. So they are part of this association set or they are dissociated from these deposits over here. Um So all Zero knowledge technology, you know, you run up to it. I'm sorry, in terms of, in terms of uh time to implement like, you know, what, what's the process for, for people who aren't familiar with, with how things get done on Ethereum. Uh What's the, what's the timeline here and how would it work? Like there are already some people that are trying to build at least the technological foundation for then? I mean, who is one of the co-founders is already trying to build out some of this? Um So this, this is technology that could be implemented uh very on a very short time scale. The only thing that we argue in the paper that's required is that some people need to supply these association sets, right? We're not all Blockchain uh forensics experts, right? So we don't know who else is putting funds into these pools where they're coming from. Uh what's the source of those funds? So you need to partner with some either organizations or companies that have access to that kind of information that can build out these sets and say, hey, all these funds that are flowing into this privacy pool here are coming from say these five exchanges or something like that, right? Like, so that's now when you, when you are pulling funds out, you would be associating yourself with, say, hey, my funds did come from one of these five exchanges, but there's no one who can tell who uh which of the five is actually mine. And um so you need, you need to have some kind of collaboration. So that's, that's part of what's going to impact the timeline for rolling this out, this part partnership needs to be established. Um But I think the first point is just to build out the technology like I AM is doing and then, um you know, we can take it from there. You brought up tornado cash. It's also mentioned in the paper, the limitations associated with it are are unpacked. But when we talk about tornado cash, I think we, we think of, of course about the sanctions. We think of course about the subsequent lawsuits. Um, our privacy pools are there any concerns you have when it comes to regulatory compliance across various different jurisdictions? So, yeah. Well, I'm a technologist. I'm not a policy maker, right? So what this is, is a proposal from a technological perspective of things that we think can solve some of the issues that are out there now, whether it actually has these properties that we, we believe they could have is up to the policy maker. So I'll leave that to the experts that are, that know that matter to decide. Like, does this actually have, you know, does this, could this live up to certain regulatory requirements in different, in certain jurisdictions or if not, how do we need to change this technology? Maybe what kind of features do we need to add or remove in order to, to get there? So this is our offer to put something into that conversation. And what's different about this proposal is that we're coming, we're we're a bunch of people coming from different aspects of the Blockchain space to have this conversation, right? We're not people coming from individual silos trying to argue why it should be one way or another. We're trying to have a conversation and say, look, we understand that there are issues. If we want to bring more many people into the Blockchain space, it needs to be safe to operate in there. People need to know that if they use a privacy technology, they can pull out their funds and safely spend them. That's what it's gonna take to take Blockchain to the next level. And so we're saying here's a technology, let the policymakers look at this and assess whether this is something that can uh that can be used. Um at the end of the day. That's, yeah, that's not up to me. So yeah, it sounds like this is more about preserving privacy for the everyday user rather than separating out bad actors. You know, of course, cha analysis works with several different entities, identifying bad actors. We've seen your company do that very well. So is is this actually about finding bad actors or is it about preserving uh privacy for the larger um set of people who are interacting on blockchains? Uh For me, it's all about privacy preservation. I believe that people, individual users that want to use Blockchain safely should have access to do that in some way. And we need technologies to protect that. Just like how I was suggesting before, like if you go to a restaurant and everybody will then know everything about you. Like, nobody wants to live in that world. And I think as if that is the world, I don't think that Blockchain is gonna achieve the kind of adoption that I would like to see. I would like to see uh Blockchain being in the hands of everybody. And I like to say, I, I particularly wanted, I want to see the day where my dad is using Blockchain. Uh Maybe he knows it or maybe he doesn't, but he'll, it'll be part of his everyday life and we're not there. And I think privacy protection is one of those elements that have to be there and we need to keep finding ways of achieving that level of privacy. And that's what this is. Thank you very much for joining the show this morning and unpacking the paper for us. Absolutely. Thanks for having me. That was analysis chief scientist Jacob. I"

Vitalik Buterin, the inventor of Ethereum, was apparently the subject of a hack that targeted his Twitter account and promoted a less-than-authentic scheme to drain people\u2019s crypto wallets.\n\nEven Twitter Can\u2019t Kill Twitter | Letter From the Editor CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish view video Even Twitter Can\u2019t Kill Twitter | Letter From the Editor\n\n\u201cTo celebrate the Proto-Darksharding coming to Ethereum, @Consensys is marking the moment with a commemorative NFT. \u2018Proto honors the work of the devs who made this possible. The collection is free for the next 24 hours,\u201d the alleged hackers posted on Buterin\u2019s account, followed by a link to a webpage where users were encouraged to claim the NFT.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe hack was reported by Web 3 Is Going Great, a blog dedicated to chronicling all the ways that the future of tech is imploding. Buterin\u2019s account was hacked, and the tweet was posted and subsequently removed all over the course of 20 minutes. A limited edition NFT was seemingly too good to pass up for crypto bros across the internet, and according to Web 3 Is Going Great, the attached link would actually take you to a wallet drainer, effectively offering the hackers the chance to crypto-bankrupt you. The outlet says that the scheme actually worked, and roughly $650,000 worth of NFTs were stolen from unsuspecting victims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProto-danksharding is an upcoming update to Ethereum\u2019s digital infrastructure, which developer Mario Havel told Decrypt was in its last stages of development before release, seemingly in the next few months. The new update will use so-called \u201cdata blobs,\u201d allowing the Ethereum network to expand and handle up to 100,000 daily transactions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nButerin\u2019s hack is par for the course in the digital-only currency world. A report last fall found that hackers stole the equivalent of $718 million in crypto from January to October 2022. This past June, the Department of Justice announced that it identified the two hackers that targeted the Mt. Gox crypto exchange in 2011, making off with around 647,000 bitcoins along the way."

        "title": "Where to Stake Ethereum in 2024? (15 Best Places) - AMBCrypto Blog",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), an open-source, decentralized blockchain, is fast becoming one of the most popular tokens. Transforming from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, Ethereum has opened a gateway to earning passive income through staking.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering where to stake Ethereum for the best returns, this article will guide you through the top 15 platforms for Ethereum staking in 2024.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum staking\n\nEthereum staking is a process where you lock up or deposit your ETH in a wallet to participate in the network\u2019s consensus mechanism. This is part of the Ethereum network\u2019s shift post The Merge, known as Ethereum 2.0 or ETH2.\n\nStaking in Ethereum involves becoming a validator in the network. Validators are chosen at random to create blocks, and the probability of being chosen relates to the amount of Ether they hold and have staked. Moreover, validators need to run software connecting them to the network, propose and check new blocks, and store data.\n\nThe benefits of staking include earning passive income through staking rewards, contributing to the network\u2019s security, and participating in the network\u2019s governance by voting on proposals.\n\nWhile you\u2019re here, read more about Ethereum 2.0 development and expand your horizons.\n\nTop 15 platforms for staking Ethereum in 2024\n\nNow that we\u2019ve covered the basics of Ethereum staking, let\u2019s explore the best platforms for staking ETH in 2024:\n\n1. Binance\n\nBinance is one of the leading crypto exchanges, known for its generous number of tokens and user-friendly platform. The platform introduced ETH2.0 staking to enable investors with less than 32 ETH to stake their tokens.\n\nBinance provides two types of staking terms, Fixed and Flexible, offering an annual percentage yield (APY) of up to 5.2% on ETH. Binance also distributes 100% of all on-chain rewards to customers, incentivizing them to stake their Ethereum. However, it\u2019s worth noting that Ethereum staking is currently not supported on Binance.US.\n\n2. Coinbase\n\nCoinbase revolutionized the digital currency environment by offering a simple platform to buy, trade, store, and sell digital assets. The platform offers Ethereum 2.0 staking, allowing users to earn up to 3.16% APY while holding ETH in a Coinbase wallet. The platform has no minimum staking amount for ETH, but it does charge a 25% commission fee on staking profits.\n\n3. Kraken\n\nKraken is a well-known digital asset exchange that offers staking services for several digital assets, including Ethereum. The platform imposes an administration fee of 15% on all rewards earned, reflected in the estimated 4-7% APY staking return. However, Kraken\u2019s staking service is not available in the United States or Canada.\n\n4. Lido\n\nLido democratizes Ethereum staking by eliminating the typical 32 ETH minimum requirement, making it accessible for investors with smaller holdings. By aggregating funds from various users into a single staking pool, Lido offers a simplified, secure, and user-friendly approach. This enables individuals to earn staking rewards without the high entry barrier or the need for significant upfront investment in Ethereum. 5. eToro eToro stands out as a highly secure platform for staking Ethereum, thanks to its global operations and stringent regulatory compliance. This makes it especially appealing for newcomers and those cautious about venturing into the unregulated world of decentralized finance (DeFi). The platform currently supports staking for Ethereum, Cardano, and Tron, with plans for further expansion. One of eToro\u2019s standout features is its automatic staking process. Simply holding eligible cryptocurrencies in your account is enough to start earning rewards, eliminating the need for a lock-in period and making it perfect for passive investors. Depending on your membership tier, you can earn between 75-90% of the total rewards generated by the staking pool. Save your digital currencies safely with these top 15 crypto-saving accounts.\n\n6. Ledger Wallet\n\nLedger Wallet provides a high-security solution for storing and staking Ethereum, thanks to its hardware-based approach. By keeping your ETH offline and in a physical device, Ledger offers robust protection against online threats.\n\nThe APY for staking rewards varies depending on the decentralized app (dApp) you use. For example, Kiln offers around 7% APY, while Lido provides about 4% APY.\n\n7. Rocket Pool\n\nRocket Pool revolutionizes Ethereum staking by providing a decentralized platform built directly on the Ethereum network. Unlike traditional options requiring 32 ETH to stake independently, Rocket Pool lowers the entry barrier by allowing staking with just 16 ETH.\n\nIt offers dual staking methods, either as an individual node or by contributing to a pooled stake. Competitive commission fees make it a cost-effective choice. For those interested in higher APY, running a node via Rocket Pool is an enticing option that maximizes returns.\n\n8. Nexo\n\nNexo sets itself apart as an all-in-one crypto exchange with a focus on flexibility and profitability in Ethereum staking. Offering customizable yields ranging from 4% to a remarkable 12%, coupled with instant withdrawals, Nexo has quickly risen as a preferred platform for ETH staking. Staking ETH on Nexo rewards users with synthetic NETH, which can be used as collateral for crypto loans at a 50% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. It offers innovative avenues to maximize staked assets. In addition to a high ETH yield, Nexo provides impressive APYs of up to 16% on other cryptocurrencies. This is achieved by combining staking rewards with Miner Extractable Value (MEV) and Ethereum network fees. Operating in over 200 jurisdictions and supporting staking for more than 35 crypto assets, Nexo also maintains industry-leading security measures backed by institutional-grade insurance to safeguard against potential losses.\n\n9. ByBit\n\nByBit is a low-cap cryptocurrency exchange offering modest but reliable APYs for Ethereum staking. It provides the flexibility for investors to choose between two staking options: a flexible term with a 1.2% APY or fixed-term staking, offering 1% to 1.8% APY for 30 or 60-day lock-ins.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that ByBit is one of the few platforms not supporting ETH 2.0 staking. This means that the platform\u2019s staking rewards are off-chain, and returns are not compounded. For long-term staking, investors need to manually delegate new tokens to continue earning APY rewards on those assets. This approach might suit traders looking for non-compounded, straightforward staking returns.\n\n10. Bitfinex\n\nBitfinex offers a compelling staking option with as much as 3.5% APY in staking rewards for ETH. This platform stands out for its absence of a minimum ETH requirement and zero staking fees, making it accessible for investors with various portfolio sizes.\n\nEquipped with advanced trading tools and innovative technology, Bitfinex caters to a global audience. However, it\u2019s important to note that the service is not available to residents of the United States or Canada. This could be a suitable choice for those outside these jurisdictions looking for high yields and low entry barriers.\n\n11. Huobi\n\nHuobi offers a user-friendly staking experience with its Huobi Earn feature, allowing both flexible and fixed lock-up terms to earn interest on Ethereum. With a low minimum deposit of just 0.1 ETH, Huobi presents an accessible option for small investors and beginners who may not have the 32 ETH typically required to become a validator. The platform currently offers up to 6.71% APY, with a 7-day average APY of 4.42%.\n\nLike Binance, Huobi users convert their ETH to BETH, representing staked ETH on a 1:1 ratio, and can trade BETH against USDT and ETH pairs. Additionally, Huobi offers an HPT airdrop bonus as part of the staking rewards, distributed the day after the BETH holdings snapshot. The platform does not appear to charge any staking fees, making it an attractive and cost-effective choice for Ethereum staking.\n\n12. StakeWise\n\nStakeWise offers a decentralized, non-custodial Ethereum staking solution through a unique dual-token system: staking ETH (sETH2) and reward ETH (rETH2), both backed 1:1 by ETH. Its standout feature is Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs), enabling users to participate in DeFi while earning staking rewards.\n\nDistributed daily, these rewards come with a 10% commission fee. The platform operates as a dApp and is supported by reputable validators, making it a secure and innovative choice for Ethereum staking.\n\n13. OKX\n\nOKX, the sixth-largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, offers both centralized and decentralized trading options, expanding its reach globally. However, its ETH 2.0 staking feature is limited to countries where OKX is licensed to operate.\n\nWith a competitive 4.15% annual percentage rate (APR) and a low minimum staking requirement of 0.1 ETH, the platform is quite accessible. Like Binance, OKX employs a 1:1 staking ratio, meaning 1 ETH staked will yield 1 BETH, issued daily as staking proof.\n\nInvestors can convert their BETH back to ETH once the Shanghai upgrade is released, expected in the second half of 2023. The platform offers a straightforward staking experience, although its geographic limitations may be a drawback for some.\n\n14. Atomic Wallet\n\nAtomic Wallet offers a software-based, non-custodial solution for those interested in staking Ethereum. Being decentralized, it puts asset security in the hands of users. The wallet enables earnings of up to 5.5% APY on staked ETH. Similar to Ledger Wallet, staking with Atomic Wallet is simplified; users simply deposit their crypto and select a validator.\n\nThe platform also provides an earnings estimator on its official website, giving users a snapshot of potential returns. Atomic Wallet is an ideal choice for those who wish to actively participate in the Ethereum ecosystem without incurring the initial costs associated with hardware wallets.\n\n15. Allnodes\n\nFounded in 2017, Allnodes offers a seamless, one-click solution for staking and node hosting through its non-custodial cloud platform. Supporting over 33,000 nodes across more than 60 protocols, the platform manages assets valued at over $2 billion. Notably, Allnodes hosts thousands of Ethereum nodes valued at roughly $800 million.\n\nThe platform shines in its user experience, providing a simple interface to monitor nodes and staking products. Staking with Allnodes is hassle-free; you only need a wallet address, and your coins remain securely in your wallet.\n\nFor Ethereum 2.0, validators can anticipate about a 4% APR. Allnodes charges a modest $5 monthly fee with no upfront setup costs, making it a cost-effective and user-friendly choice for staking services.\n\nBottom line\n\nStaking Ethereum has emerged as a lucrative opportunity for investors to earn passive income while contributing to the security and stability of the Ethereum network. Whether you\u2019re an experienced investor or a beginner, the platforms discussed above offer an array of options to suit your needs and preferences.\n\nMake sure to assess each platform\u2019s features, security measures, and staking rewards to make an informed decision. Always remember, the world of crypto staking carries its own risks, and it\u2019s crucial to stake responsibly."

        "content": "The Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) has recorded significant gains since Cathie Wood\u2019s asset management firm ARK Invest and investment manager VanEck filed applications with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nAccording to a tweet by blockchain intelligence firm IntoTheBlock, the ETHE discount to net asset value (NAV) narrowed to 26% despite a drop in ETH price within the same period.\n\nFollowing Ark\u2019s spot ETH ETF filing, Grayscale\u2019s ETH fund is close to its yearly highs, even while Ether itself is down over 20%.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s going on\ud83d\udc47 \u27a1\ufe0f ETHE has increased by over 140% in 2023, significantly narrowing its discount to the underlying Ether it holds\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f The\u2026 pic.twitter.com/PIROEgYVuT \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) September 8, 2023\n\nGrayscale\u2019s ETHE Discount Narrows\n\nOn September 6, ARK Invest moved towards launching the first spot Ether ETF in the United States. In an S-1 filed with the SEC, the asset management firm said the ARK21Shares Ethereum ETF would track the performance of ETH.\n\nLeading American crypto exchange Coinbase would be the custodian of the product to hold all of the fund\u2019s ETH, while crypto exchange-traded products issuer 21Shares is the trust\u2019s sponsor. ARK Invest will serve as the sub-adviser of the ETF and handle the marketing of its shares.\n\nAlong with VanEck\u2019s filing, the news caused an uproar in the crypto market, with bitcoin (BTC) and ETH recording a brief ascent before falling back to their pre-announcement levels. While the crypto assets experienced a short glee, ETHE continued to progress.\n\nIntoTheBlock said ETHE had narrowed the discount to its underlying ETH by a fair margin, recording a more than 140% increase in 2023. The discount started decreasing in June when the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, led several traditional finance giants to file for a spot Bitcoin ETF. The discount first moved from -56% to -36% that month and then dropped to -26% this month, reaching a level seen since October 2022.\n\nThe blockchain intelligence firm said the trend suggests that the crypto market is weighing the odds that Grayscale may convert ETHE into an ETF due to the push from other companies in the industry.\n\nLaunching the First U.S. Spot Ether ETF\n\nThe race to launch the first spot Ether ETF comes as the crypto community awaits the SEC\u2019s approval of the set of applications seeking to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nWhile the regulator\u2019s next move remains unclear, Grayscale\u2019s recent victory in the legal battle with the agency over its continued rejection of a spot Bitcoin ETF could influence the regulator\u2019s decision.\n\nAnalysts have set May 23, 2024, as the estimated deadline for the SEC to approve the filings for a spot Ether ETF."

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price breaks down, exposing BTC to the risk of sliding below the key $24,500 June lows.\n\nEthereum price could fall 10% to the $1,400 range if BTC price shows weakness below $25,586.\n\nRipple price eyes continued downtrend as XRP tests the descending parallel channel at $0.4600.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price indicates signs of an impending slump after losing a critical support level. The gloom has extended to Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices, as the broader market downtrend becomes clearer now more than ever before.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price recovery bound to be delayed as Texas power crisis threatens miner reserves.\n\nBitcoin price faces risks of a downtrend\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is down almost 3% over the last day, against a 99% increase in 24-hour trading volume. However, the odds favor the downside, with momentum indicators showing that buying pressure continues to reduce.\n\nFurthermore, a death cross hangs over Bitcoin price, indicated by the 50-day Moving Average (MA) almost crossing below the 200-day MA. A death cross pattern occurs when the short-term moving average of an asset crosses below its long-term moving average.\n\nWith the above, Bitcoin price could fall toward $24,500. This level is of particular significance as it marks the June 2023 lows and the last lowest high. Therefore, a solid break below it could extend the downtrend, possibly sending BTC to tag the $23,600 range, levels last tested on May 13. In a dire case, the downtrend could continue to $21,300, levels last seen in March. Such a move would constitute a 15% downswing from current levels.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if the $24,500 support level holds, Bitcoin price could have a chance at a recovery. Increased buying pressure above this level could change the narrative for Bitcoin, sending BTC north to reclaim the $25,586 support level.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, the king of crypto could extend to breach the resistance confluence between the 50- and 200-MA at around $27,616 before a neck higher possible toward the $28,838 hurdle.\n\nIn highly ambitious cases, Bitcoin price could shatter past the $30,000 psychological level before a test of the range highs above $31,804.\n\nThe bullish convergence between Bitcoin price and two momentum indicators, RSI and MACD, adds weight to prospects of a recovery. This is indicated by BTC price recording lower lows which are not mirrored by either RSI or MACD.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: BTC could revisit $21,000 as sell signals multiply ahead of US CPI.\n\nEthereum price risks 10% fall\n\nEthereum price (ETH) is $1,575 at press time, sliding south with a forecasted 10% slump to $1,407 if Bitcoin price tags $24,500.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, a recovery in Bitcoin price, would influence Ethereum price to correct north, possibly converting the $1,575 resistance level back to a support floor before breaching past $1,800 to tag the psychological $2,000 level.\n\nAlso Read: Grayscale Ethereum Trust discount shrinks to lowest level in a year, traders await spot ETH ETF approval.\n\nRipple price to fall back to the confines of a bearish pattern\n\nRipple (XRP) price tests the upper boundary of a descending parallel channel, with momentum indicators (RSI and AO) showing a possible breakdown back into the foothold of this bearish technical formation.\n\nA decisive flip of the $0.4600 support level back into a resistance would increase the odds for a downtrend, confirmed once XRP tests the midline of the descending parallel channel at $0.4191. In the dire case, the payments token could extend lower to the channel\u2019s base at $0.3562, levels last seen in March.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nA hold at the upper channel line and resurgence by the bulls, however, could reverse the trend for Ripple price, with a likely breach of the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) hurdle at $0.5224 before XRP can confront the resistance confluence between the 50- and 100-day EMA at around the $0.5505 and $0.5510 range. This would indicate a 15% ascent above current levels.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price reverses all gains since Judge Torres ruling as Ripple holders sentiment turns negative."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market soared in late 2021 with many coins hitting all-time highs. Ethereum ETH/USD and Bitcoin BTC/USD were among the cryptocurrencies that hit all-time highs in November 2021.\n\nOne of the top company executives in the world shared a bullish take on cryptocurrency in 2021. Unfortunately, it coincided with the near peak of valuations, which could have been an inopportune moment for investors to place their bets.\n\nWhat Happened: Several companies added Bitcoin to their balance sheets in 2021, which was among the catalysts that helped propel the price forward. One company that was often rumored to get more friendly with cryptocurrency was Apple Inc AAPL.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook revealed that he personally owned cryptocurrency, without specifying which cryptocurrencies he owned or how much.\n\n\u201cI do, yeah, I think it\u2019s reasonable to own it as part of a diversified portfolio,\u201d Cook told Andrew Ross Sorkin at the DealBook Conference when asked if he owned Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been interested in it for a while,\" he added.\n\nCook said he had been researching cryptocurrency for a while, but shut down a notion that Apple would be adding crypto to its balance sheet.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go invest in crypto, not because I wouldn\u2019t in my own money, but because I don\u2019t think people buy Apple stock to get exposure to crypto.\u201d\n\nAside from investing in crypto, Sorkin asked Cook about the possibility of accepting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for products like Apple Pay.\n\n\"It's something that we are looking at,\" he said, however, \"it's not something we have immediate plans to do.\"\n\nRelated Link: 5 Things You Might Not Know About Apple CEO Tim Cook\n\nInvesting $1,000 in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Apple Stock: Many cryptocurrency investors and fans of the sector buy based on specific events and catalysts. Hearing that the CEO of the biggest company in the world was bullish on cryptocurrency and owned Bitcoin or Ethereum was a catalyst that could send the price higher.\n\nUnfortunately, Cook\u2019s comments came almost to the day of the all-time high prices for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAn investor could have bought 0.0149 Bitcoin with $1,000 on Nov. 9, 2021. The Bitcoin would be worth $390.52 today, down 60.9% from the original purchase price.\n\nAn investor could have bought 0.2119 Ethereum with $1,000 on Nov. 9, 2021. The Ethereum would be worth $340.32 today, down 65.0% from the original purchase price.\n\nFor comparison, an investor could have purchased 6.6979 shares of Apple stock with $1,000 at the same time. The investment in Apple stock would be worth $1,193.03 today. This represents a positive return of 19.3% over the last nearly two years.\n\nAn investor who put the same $1,000 in the SPDR S&P 500 Global ETF Trust SPY, which tracks the S&P 500 Index, would have an investment worth $981.85 today, down 1.8% over the last nearly two years.\n\nBitcoin hit its all-time high of $68,789.63 on Nov. 10, 2021, one day after Cook\u2019s comments.\n\nEthereum hit its all-time high of $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021, shortly after Cook\u2019s comments.\n\nRead Next: If You Invested $1,000 In Apple Stock When Tim Cook Became The CEO, Here's How Much You'd Have Today\n\nImage: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Ethereum price extended the down leg below the previous support at $1,600 \u2013 a move that saw declines sweep through levels seen last in March. The leading smart contracts token traded new weekly lows of $1,540 before launching an ongoing rebound seeking to reclaim the ground above $1,600.\n\nDormant ETH Finally On The Move\n\nThe sell-off on Monday also coincided with a spike in the movement of previously dormant tokens away from old wallets. According to the Age Consumed on-chain metric by Santiment, there was a noticeable increase in the most dormant ETH over three months.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cA continued dip in mean $ age while prices drop is a capitulation sign, which foreshadows reversals.\u201d\n\nThe rollback to March price levels could attract more long traders, who by taking advantage of the dips, are targeting short-term profits as ETH price rebounds to close the gap to $2,000. This uptake of Ethereum means fresh momentum is brewing for the next rally, first above $1,600 then to $1,800, and later to $2,000.\n\nA sustained break past $2,000 could signal the start of a much-awaited bull market in 2024 going into 2025.\n\nThis current bullish outlook cannot be depended on until ETH price clocks highs above the lower ascending trendline or closes the day beyond the pivotal $1,600 level.\n\nUpholding support at $1,600 could help ease the potential selling pressure likely to follow the confirmation of a death cross pattern. This bearish chart formation occurs with a short-term moving average such as the 50-day EMA (red) crosses below a long-term one like the 200-day EMA (purple).\n\nThe death cross adds credence to the bearish outlook, implying that sellers have the upper hand and the ongoing downtrend is far from over.\n\nUnless investors put the fear of uncertainty aside and rally behind Ethereum, the Money Flow Index (MFI) will drop into the oversold region, which will validate another sell-off to $1,450.\n\nWill ETH Price Drop To $1,000 Before The Bull Market?\n\nAnalysts at Matrixport in their latest report on the performance of altcoins, said that \u201cwith Ether being close to the psychologically important $1,600 level, a break could carry prices lower, especially as revenue growth disappoints.\u201d\n\nThe longer the price stays below the $1,600 level, the higher will increase the chances of another sell-off trimming gains and forcing investors to capitulate. Matrixport believes it is too early to rule out a potential drop to $1,000 \u2013 \u201ca level that would appear justified based on the revenue projection from the Ethereum ecosystem.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles"

        "title": "Assessing the effect of Bitcoin\u2019s pre- halving on Ethereum - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "ETH may form lower highs for the rest of the year, an analyst explained.\n\nThe short-term sentiment around the altcoin has moved from hope into capitulation.\n\nAnalyst Benjamin Cowen told his 778,000 YouTube subscribers that Ethereum [ETH] may be negatively affected by Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] pre-halving second leg. According to Cowen, the said season has hardly been favorable for ETH previously and he explained how this cycle may not be any different.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nIn the 29-minute-long session, Cowen highlighted that prior to the 2020 halving, ETH found itself in deplorable condition. He also mentioned that the altcoin only recovered much later after the four-year event had been completed at that time.\n\nLowering highs into capitulation\n\nAlthough he admitted that there was some upside for ETH at intervals, most were short-lived. As a result, ETH\u2019s likely movement would be to form lower highs for the rest of the year, and possibly the first quarter of 2024.\n\nFor context, a lower high occurs If the price of an asset closes at a high price, but that high is lower than the high at the close of the previous trading day. Cowen said that,\n\n\u201cThat does not mean that Ethereum cannot at all move back up. It probably will at various phases. But the general direction should be down.\u201d\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH\u2019s price was $1,614, denoting a 12.61% decrease in the last 30 days. Regardless of the price action, several indicators suggest that the altcoin could be undervalued.\n\nHowever, Cowen\u2019s projection meant that ETH may remain undervalued till year-end. But what is the short-term holder view of Ethereum?\n\nOne metric that answers this question is the Short-Term Holder-Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (STH-NUPL). As an indicator to assess the behavior of short-term investors, the STH-NUPL considers the UTXOs younger than 155 days.\n\nA UTXO refers to Unspent Transaction Output, and it reflects where each transaction starts and finishes. At press time, the STH-NUPL had slid from hope (orange) to capitulation (red). This transition implies that market players also share the view that ETH\u2019s price would decrease further.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nFind an entry when ETH falls\n\nMeanwhile, pseudonymous trader Daan Crypto opined that ETH\u2019s performance against BTC has been impressive this cycle. According to his post on X (formerly Twitter), Ethereum has been much more stable when compared to other altcoins despite its low volatility.\n\nBut like the general sentiment, Daan expects Ethereum to keep losing its dominance to Bitcoin. As of this writing, ETH\u2019s value against BTC was 0.063. To buttress his point, Daan mentioned that the coin could drop 0.055. However, he also considered the said value as a good entry price."

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens were struggling on Tuesday morning as traders got spooked by the potential selling pressure from bankrupt exchange FTX. The downward action happened as market participants were digesting the possibility of FTX securing approval from bankruptcy court to sell assets from its $3.4 billion of cryptocurrency holdings.\n\n\n\nA joint policy paper on crypto published by the IMF and FSB warned jurisdictions against implementing blanket bans to mitigate risks associated with the sector, and recommended targeted restrictions and sound monetary policy instead. Targeted restrictions might come in handy for emerging economies in particular, it said.\n\n\n\nBitcoin was struggling to hold gains as the largest crypto token inched up marginally but remained below $26,000-levels. Its largest peer, Ethereum, dropped about 2 per cent to fall below $1,600-mark. Price action in the altcoins remained on the negative side in the morning.\n\n\n\nIn the last 24 hours, Bitcoin briefly lost its crucial support at $25,000 for the first time in almost three months. Ethereum too, slid past its support at $1,600 and is currently trading around $1,550, said Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager at CoinSwitch Markets Desk\n\n\n\n\"While a major catalyst for Soalana's sell-off still remains the Wednesday expectation of FTX unlocking, it is already down around 50 per cent from its recent high in July. A few events that investors are expected to closely monitor include the US CPI Data slated for tomorrow, alongside the US Producer Price Index (PPI) data and US retail sales data a day later,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring a few exceptions, all top crypto tokens were trading lower on Tuesday. XRP dropped more than 3 per cent, while Polkadot declined over 2 per cent. Polygon, Litecoin, Shiba Inu and BNB were among the other key laggards. Among the gainers, Dogecoin added about a per cent.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly lower, falling to $1.03 trillion-mark, as it dropped almost a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes surged as much as 65 per cent to $35.17 billion.\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\nMetal Dao (MTL) serves as a utility token, presently overseeing the stablecoin known as Metal Dollar (XMD). Moreover, it offers graduated trading discounts to MTL holders when they utilise the Metal Pay cash and cryptocurrency application.\n\n\n\nImage: Chart-MetalDAO\n\n\n\nThe MTL/USDT trend has been on an uptrend since the start of this month while forming a distinctive cup pattern on the 4-hourly time-frame. The MTL trading volumes have seen a huge surge during this period. The next resistance is expected at 1.46 USDT and an immediate support is expected at 1.19 USDT.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $1,625,$1,585\n\nResistance: $1,670, $1,700, $1,735\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nThe prices of major cryptocurrencies dipped on September 11.\n\nBetween 10:20 and 10:30 UTC, Bitcoin, Ether, BNB, XRP and others all dropped sharply.\n\nInvestors are currently nervous ahead of the anticipated unlocking of a cache of crypto from FTX.\n\nThe failed exchange was preparing to request approval for liquidating $3.4B worth of cryptocurrencies on Wednesday, September 13.\n\nThe prices of major cryptocurrencies simultaneously took a dive shortly after 10:00 am (UTC) on Monday, September 11.\n\nWith BTC, BNB, ETH, and XRP all down, what caused the latest market slide? Fears over the impact of an expected multibillion-dollar liquidation of FTX assets could be behind the sudden price drop.\n\nMajor Cryptos Slide on Monday Morning\n\nBetween 10:20 and 10:30, the price of Bitcoin fell from $25,790 to $25,680. In the same ten minutes, Ether dropped more substantially from $1606 to 1590.\n\nOf course, a decline of around 1% is far from the most dramatic crash in the history of crypto. But markets are spooked nonetheless.\n\nThe global crypto market cap has declined 1.23% over the course of the past day. More worrying still, every one of the top fifty cryptocurrencies has clocked a loss in the previous 24 hours.\n\nFTX Prepares to Liquidate $3.4B Worth of Cryptocurrencies\n\nOne potential reason behind Monday\u2019s market dip is the anticipated liquidation of cryptocurrencies locked up during FTX\u2019s insolvency proceedings.\n\nLawyers for the company are set to appear in Delaware Bankruptcy Court on Wednesday, September 13, to request approval for liquidating $3.4B worth of cryptocurrencies.\n\nOnce approved, the assets have the potential to create downward price pressure as freshly liquidated cryptocurrency floods the market.\n\nBig selling pressure is potentially coming next week\ud83d\udea8 FTX will likely get approval to liquidate its assets on Sept. 13. FTX had $3.4B in crypto in April. The proposed plan is to sell assets worth up to $200M per week. pic.twitter.com/4aHnhOVKP1 \u2014 The DeFi Investor \ud83d\udd0e (@TheDeFinvestor) September 9, 2023\n\nAnd while that might hardly dent Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization, lower market-cap altcoins could respond negatively to the increased supply.\n\nFor example, FTX holds Solana (SOL), valued at around $685 million.\n\nSuggesting a correlation between the volume of assets held by FTX and the respective tokens\u2019 price performance, SOL has lost nearly 10% of its market value in the past week.\n\nThe silver lining for Solana investors is that the bulk of the SOL tokens held by FTX debtors can\u2019t be sold immediately.\n\nOne thing that's worth noting about FTX's $SOL holdings: While FTX holds a very large % of $SOL supply, most of it is still locked and will be fully vested in 2028. SOL price can still be impacted in the short term. But not as bad as everyone expects. https://t.co/WZX4hL0UGx pic.twitter.com/NiDVns2qoT \u2014 The DeFi Investor \ud83d\udd0e (@TheDeFinvestor) September 10, 2023\n\nWhile FTX does hold a large percentage of the total SOL supply, most of it is still locked and will be fully vested in 2028."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, a computer programmer who co-founded the popular cryptocurrency Ethereum, is clearing the air after his account on Twitter (now known as X) was hacked this weekend. The hack involved a post touting a commemorative NFT that was actually a cryptocurrency wallet drainer.\n\nThe Biggest Crypto Heists of 2022\u2026So Far CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish view video The Biggest Crypto Heists of 2022\u2026So Far\n\n\u201cFinally got back my T-mobile account (yes, it was a sim swap, meaning that someone socially-engineered T-mobile itself to take over my phone number),\u201d Buterin wrote. \u201cMain learning re twitter was: > A phone number is sufficient to password reset a Twitter account even if not used as 2FA. Can completely remove phone from Twitter.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nButerin revealed that a SIM swap attack was the method for the hack in a post on the decentralized social media platform Farcast, as reported by Decrypt. The outlet says that the swap allowed the hackers to take over Buterin\u2019s Twitter account by manually resetting his password using his phone as well as using the number to bypass the platform\u2019s two-factor authentication. The Ethereum co-founder boasts a big 4.9 million followers on the platform, and the hack resulted in an estimated $650,000 worth of NFTs being stolen from unsuspecting victims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis weekend, the hackers took control of Buterin\u2019s account to post a phony link to a limited edition NFT, which was advertised to commemorate the release of proto-danksharding for Ethereum. Proto-danksharding is an upcoming update to the cryptocurrency\u2019s digital infrastructure, which developer Mario Havel told Decrypt was in its last stages of development before release, seemingly in the next few months. The new update will use so-called \u201cdata blobs,\u201d allowing the Ethereum network to expand and handle up to 100,000 daily transactions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTo celebrate the Proto-Darksharding coming to Ethereum, @Consensys is marking the moment with a commemorative NFT. \u2018Proto honors the work of the devs who made this possible. The collection is free for the next 24 hours, \u201d the alleged hackers posted on Buterin\u2019s account, followed by a link to a webpage where users were encouraged to claim the NFT. The tweet was posted and subsequently removed over the course of 20 minutes."

Prior to Buterin's explanation, it was speculated that the hackers exploited a SIM swap vulnerability to gain access to his account.\n\nSIM swaps and cyber traps\n\nButerin has since regained control of his T-Mobile account and clarified the situation via his X account. He confirmed that the hacking was due to a SIM swap attack, stating that someone \"socially engineered\" T-Mobile itself to gain access to his phone number.\n\nButerin also shared a cautionary note on the vulnerability of phone numbers as an authentication method. He mentioned that even if a phone number is not used for two-factor authentication (2FA), it can still be exploited for password resetting on X. In hindsight, Buterin acknowledged that he had been advised against using phone numbers for authentication but did not heed the warning until this incident.\n\nThe hack has prompted Buterin to transition to \"farcaster,\" a platform where account recovery is tied to Ethereum addresses, thus offering enhanced security.\n\nButerin has moved to a more secure platform, but the incident serves as a cautionary tale for both public figures and average users in the crypto community."

        "content": "Crypto Casino Lucky Block Opens LBLOCK V2 Token Ethereum Bridge, Launches Lucky Block Telegram Casino and Sportsbook\n\nHolders of the LBLOCK native crypto casino token of the fast-growing Lucky Block Casino and Sportsbook will be able to fully convert to its Ethereum variant from September 11.\n\nFollowing the April 2023 integration of the LBLOCK token into the Casino, this is the next major step on the roadmap to re-energize LBLOCK as the world\u2019s premier native token of the gambling industry.\n\nIn a series of two staged openings, on 11-17 September and 25 September to 1 October, holders of the original LBLOCK V1 BNB Smart Chain (BEP-20) version of the token will be able to convert it to the LBLOCK V2 Ethereum-compliant (ERC-20) version.\n\nThe bridge opens at 3pm UTC and can be accessed by visiting https://www.luckyblock.com/en/how-to-buy-lucky-block .\n\nBridging cryptocurrencies is a complicated technological process that requires rigorous security testing. This is why the Bridge is not kept open outside of the two one-week windows.\n\nHowever, for users of the bridge, this complexity is hidden. Users will simply need to connect their wallet to the official bridging website to swap their tokens.\n\nThe team has released on Twitter and Discord a step-by-step LBLOCK bridging guide on how to use the bridge and comprehensive frequently asked questions (FAQs) to address all aspects of the bridging process.\n\nLucky Block\u2019s LBLOCK V2 token is currently priced at $0.00009085.\n\nA new Lucky Block whitepaper pulling together roadmap changes and the way forward for the ecosystem will be published during the 60-day vesting period that applies to bridged assets.\n\nAdvantages of LBLOCK on Ethereum; Lucky Block crypto casino launches on Telegram\n\nLucky Block crypto casino is widely publicizing the opening of the bridge in order to make sure that the whole community is aware.\n\nConverting to Ethereum has many advantages for token holders, chief among them being the higher price of the ERC-20 token compared to the V1 BEP-20 token.\n\nHowever, the Ethereum blockchain is also the largest and most important network for hosting and running decentralized applications, so the migration opens up LBLOCK to a world of greater business development and interoperability.\n\nBridging involves making transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, which incurs costs. Because of this, the 12% transaction tax on LBLOCK V1 tokens will not apply.\n\nIn other related news \u2013 and a further boon for the community \u2013 this week, the Lucky Block Telegram Casino and Sportsbook bot launched on the Telegram app.\n\nCommunity manager Damian Jacobs: \u201cExciting and profitable time ahead\u201d\n\nCommenting on the bridging and Telegram news, Damian Jacobs, community manager at Lucky Block, said: \u201cAfter the delay that unfortunately followed our previous bridge announcement, I am extremely pleased to be able to confirm the bridge opening on September 11.\n\n\u201cLong-term holders of the first version of the LBLOCK token can now rest assured that the value of their tokens has been safeguarded for the future. In fact, the growth plans we have for the token will place its holders at the cutting edge of our booming industry.\n\n\u201cFrom the Platinum Rollers Club NFTs to the expanding utility of the LBLOCK Ethereum-based token, we can together look forward to an exciting and profitable time ahead.\n\n\u201cAnd this week, we launched the Lucky Block Telegram Casino and Sportsbook bot. We are among the first fully regulated betting firms to set up shop on Telegram. Game on!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no tax when you bridge to LBLOCK V2 and vesting will dampen price volatility\n\nBecause of the price volatility inherent in swapping from one actively traded asset to another and the arbitrage opportunity it will attract, a 60-day vesting period will apply for all newly bridged tokens.\n\nAcross the 60-day period, 16.65% will be unlocked every 10 days, based on the principal bridged amount. By the end of the 60-day vesting period, 100% of the vested tokens will have been released.\n\nThe impact of the vesting period will be to reduce price volatility and provide a foundational basis for the price of the Ethereum-based token to appreciate.\n\nLBLOCK\u2019s new improved value proposition: new tournaments, special jackpots Platinum Rollers Club NFT VIP Program, CEX listings\u2026 and much more to come\n\nLucky Block\u2019s development team is currently working on bringing new utility features to the LBLOCK token, thereby enhancing its value proposition for token holders.\n\nDuring the vesting period, holders of the bridged assets will see the introduction of a variety of gamification and crypto-related features.\n\nAmong the new services will be revaps of existing products. So, for example, the owners of the Platinum Rollers Club NFTs will see the long-awaited implementation of the VIP Program. It will include preferential and exclusive entry to a range of product offerings in the Lucky Block Casino.\n\nThere will also be a special tier of the Lucky Block Loyalty Program for LBLOCK.\n\nOther products being planned include tournaments and special jackpots in which the LBLOCK token will unlock exclusive access and prize features.\n\n\n\nAs dual-coin confusion ends, plans for more LBLOCK CEX listings take shape\n\nCrucially, as part of the team\u2019s commitment to the future success of the LBLOCK token, more centralized exchange listings will be sought. LBLOCK V2 token is already listed on a number of top centralized exchanges, including Gate.io , MEXC and LBank .\n\nThe end to the confusion surrounding the two versions of the coin will make it easier for the team to get LBLOCK listed on more centralized exchanges.\n\nPrior to the launch of the Lucky Block Casino and Sportsbook in November 2022, the main product of the platform was prize draws and lotteries.\n\nThe team has confirmed that the lottery feature will return in a different form, with a version specially designed for Lucky Block token holders.\n\nLucky Block is not limiting its LBLOCK V2 token to be just the native token of Lucky Block, as important as that is. The business development team is looking at the possibility of introducing the token to more casinos.\n\nThe list of coins customers can use on Lucky Block Casino and Sportsbook includes LBLOCK, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Tether (USDT), Cronos, Monero, Dash, Zcash, Solana, Avalanche, Dai, Chainlink, Polygon, USD Coin, Polkadot, Uniswap, Shiba Inu and Wrapped Bitcoin.\n\nAs LBLOCK gains traction within and beyond the Lucky Block Casino and Sportsbook, it aims to grow its reputation and visibility as the leading gambling and gaming-focused cryptocurrency in the booming sector.\n\nAccording to data supplied by crypto analytics and information site CoinGecko, LBLOCK V2 is the 11th-ranked coin in the crypto gambling sector, with a fully diluted market capitalization value (FDV) of $9,489,804.\n\n\n\nGambling is a huge market opportunity for Lucky Block, plus Lucky Block Telegram Casino and Sportsbook launched this week\n\nProblems at Stake.com aside, online betting is a booming industry, last valued at $63.5 billion in 2022 , and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11.7% between 2023 and 2030.\n\nWithin that space, crypto is the fastest growing segment, and it is innovators like Lucky Block who are sure to be the major beneficiaries.\n\nSpeaking of innovation, as mentioned earlier, Lucky Block recently stealth-launched its casino on the Telegram messaging app, laying down the gauntlet to the competition.\n\nThe Lucky Block Telegram Casino and Sportsbook allows users to quickly get up and running because it leverages the KYC of Telegram to make onboarding a breeze.\n\n\n\nTelegram bots make it super easy to use, providing access to Lucky Block\u2019s fully featured service that includes all the online casino favorites such as slots, poker, live casino, and table games, including roulette and blackjack.\n\nLBLOCK is the must-have crypto casino asset to unlock the world of gaming \u2013 overnight, it turns token holders into VIP patrons with a front-row seat in the most exciting growth sector in crypto."

Trading volumes also dropped significantly, by 73% in comparison to the prior week to just US$754 million for the week.\u201d\n\nLast week also brought an end to Solana\u2019s (SOL) recent run.

        "content": "Hackers reportedly gained control of the X, formerly Twitter, account of Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and stole more than $691,000 from unsuspecting victims.\n\nThe attack was carried out through a phishing link that provided unauthorized access to people\u2019s wallets, with a significant portion of the value that was taken from the individuals\u2019 wallets being in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), CoinDesk reported Monday (Sept. 11), citing blockchain analyst ZachXBT.\n\nThe attack was initiated through a tweet containing the malicious link, which has since been deleted, according to the report.\n\nThe exact method used by the hackers remains unclear, as ZachXBT refrained from speculating on whether Buterin fell victim to a \u201cSIM swap\u201d attack, the report said. SIM swapping, a method where control of a person\u2019s phone number is taken to bypass two-factor authentication on websites like crypto exchanges and social media platforms, is one potential avenue through which the attack could have been executed.\n\nThis incident adds to the growing list of cryptocurrency-related security breaches, per the report. Earlier this year, it was reported that crypto investors lost $54 million in a single month due to rug pulls, scams and hacks.\n\nIn a similar vein, the official website of the Terra blockchain was recently compromised by hackers who posted a series of malicious links, according to the report. The extent of the stolen funds remains unclear.\n\nPYMNTS Intelligence found that nearly half of all organizations reported being targeted by fraud in 2022, with the fraud stemming from a wide variety of sources and aimed at a range of targets.\n\nBad actors are constantly developing new techniques and technologies to steal hard-earned revenue and data, according to \u201cFraud Technology Trends 2022,\u201d a PYMNTS and DataVisor collaboration.\n\nOne study found that 97% of eCommerce fraud prevention decision-makers around the world had experienced some sort of fraud at their organizations within the past 24 months.\n\nIn an August hack, crypto lender Exactly Protocol lost as much as $12 million when targeted in a bridge exploit. The hacker used an exploiter contract on Ethereum to move deposits to Optimism and then bridged the stolen funds back to Ethereum.\n\nFor all PYMNTS crypto coverage, subscribe to the daily Crypto Newsletter."

The platform offers a software development kit and ZK library that are touted to provide plug-and-play functionality for developers.\n\nBeing EVM-native means that apps deployed on Ethereum can be deployed on Manta Pacific and vice versa, while being ZK-enabled provides low gas fees and scalability. Users can also bridge Ethereum to Manta to begin exploring its development environment.\n\nRelated: Manta Network developer raises $25M in Series A, launches layer 2 for ZK apps\n\nWith industry peers, including the likes of Consensys\u2019 Linea zkEVM, Polygon zkEVM, Starknet, Coinbase\u2019s Base and zkSync Era, there are a number of ZK-proof L2 solution options available to Web3 developers.\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph following the mainnet launch, Manta Network core contributor Kenny Li said that the different ZK-rollup L2s offer different value propositions that aim to solve significant problems faced by developers.\n\n\u201cWe think that, in the mid- to long term, the market will converge to a small number of available solutions that are focused on making it as easy as possible for developers to build and deploy ZK-enabled applications.\u201d\n\nLi added that the Web2 world of technology followed a similar evolution with the success of software-as-a-service models where a plug-and-play approach was taken:\n\n\u201cThis is crucial when zero-knowledge is involved, whereby developers do not have to worry about the infrastructure, as the complexity of cryptography can be abstracted away.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Manta Network core contributor, Manta Pacific has been in development for nine months, while its testnet launch in July 2023 has seen the creation of 150,000 wallets and over 3.5 million transactions.\n\nManta raised $25 million from investors in July 2023, aimed at scaling the project\u2019s network and use cases with an eye on driving adoption in the Asian market.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

        "content": "The crypto space has always been inundated with several hacks, breaches and exploits, but now one of the most prominent personalities in the industry, Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum co-founder has become a victim.\n\nAccording to reports over the weekend, Vitalik\u2019s X (Twitter) account was targeted by a hacker, who managed to steal almost $700,000 from unsuspecting users after sharing malicious links through the hacked account.\n\nHow it happened\n\nOn Saturday, in a now-deleted post, the hacker who gained access to Vitalik Buterin\u2019s account made an announcement about the launch of a new set of commemorative NFTs from software provider, Consensys.\n\nRead also:\n\nCrypto exchange founder sentenced to 11,196 years in prison for fraud\n\nThe link, which was visible to Vitalik Buterin\u2019s 4.9 million followers on X, urged users to connect their wallets and mint the NFTs. Unbeknownst to the victims, it was a malicious link to entice them to connect their wallets before ultimately stealing all their funds.\n\nIn an X (Twitter) post on Sunday, Dmitry Buterin, the father of Vitalik Buterin, announced that his son\u2019s account had been compromised:\n\n\u201cDisregard this post, apparently Vitalik has been hacked. He is working on restoring access.\u201d\n\nBut unfortunately, the deed had already been done.\n\nAccording to prominent blockchain investigator, ZachXBT, the incident led to victims collectively losing over $691,000 after clicking on the malicious link. Ethereum developer Bok Khoo, also known as Bokky Poobah on X, claims that he has suffered losses in his CryptoPunk NFT collection. At press time, the floor price for a CryptoPunk NFT stands at 46.99 ETH which is around $76,000.\n\nZachXBT later on Sunday shared that the most valuable NFT stolen so far is CryptoPunk #3983, worth 153.62 ETH (around $250,000).\n\nAlthough Vitalik Buterin hasn\u2019t commented on the issue yet, speculators insist that his account must have been compromised because he might not have implemented sufficient security measures.\n\nIncessant hacks in the crypto space\n\nThis latest incident adds to an ever-increasing list of social media hacks that have resulted in the loss of millions of tokens. According to a report by Immunefi, Web3 platforms have lost over $1 billion in hacks and rug pulls in 2023 so far. The report highlighted 211 separate incidents and concluded that crypto investors lost a total of $54 million in a single month.\n\nRecall that in August, the Terra blockchain\u2019s official website was taken over by hackers who posted a series of malicious links. This series of attacks has brought X (Twitter)\u2019s security into question, with Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao stating that the platform\u2019s security is not well designed compared to traditional financial accounts and platforms.\n\n\u201cIt needs quite a bit more features: 2FA, login ID should be different from handle or email, etc. In the past, I have had my Twitter account locked a few times due to hackers trying to brute-force it (trying different passwords repeatedly). This was before the \u2018Elon era.\u2019\u201d \u2013 Changpeng Zhao, Binance CEO said.\n\nTwo-factor authentication is one of the most widely accepted and recommended defences against hackers. Users are required to set two sets of information that verify their identity before letting them access an account. Twitter supports two-factor authentication, but only for paid users.\n\nVitalik Buterin\n\nRead also: Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin banned for one year in Kenya\n\nOn the flip side, some X (Twitter) users speculate that Vitalik Buterin\u2019s account was compromised through a SIM swap attack. SIM swapping involves taking control of someone\u2019s phone number in order to overcome some two-factor security measures on websites like crypto exchanges or social media sites.\n\nIt is however not certain yet as Buterin\u2019s high profile makes him susceptible to various forms of hacking attempts. It is however important to be wary of clicking links, especially random ones on social media."

This buzz is largely due to its presale boom, which is providing a unique opportunity for early adopters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupporters of Everlodge (ELDG) can take part in pre-sale and buy tokens here .\n\nEverlodge (ELDG): Breathing Fresh Air into Crypto-Real Estate\n\nInvesting in vacation properties has never been easier, thanks to Everlodge . The company has introduced a new co-ownership model that uses blockchain technology to simplify the process of investing in vacation homes. Here, properties are tokenized to enable fractional ownership and facilitate easy trading of the tokens between investors.\n\nGet started in just a few taps: create your account, link your DeFi wallet with Everlodge, and immerse yourself in a kaleidoscope of listings spanning upscale villas, boutique hotels, and serene vacation spots across the globe. With an enticing entry threshold of just $100, you can stake your claim on a slice of paradise and watch your returns flourish.\n\nBeyond mere ownership, the act of staking ELDG tokens unfurls a medley of rewards. Token bearers not only stand to reap a consistent passive revenue but are also privy to a slew of perks, including transactional discounts and exclusive in-network deals.\n\nThe current presale rate of $0.012 for the ELDG token has set the crypto community abuzz with excitement. With a tiered pricing approach, each presale stage is poised to elevate the token's market value as demand increases.\n\nEthereum (ETH) reaches crucial price level\n\nThe evolution of Ethereum has been nothing short of fascinating. As the pioneering force behind smart contracts, Ethereum has firmly established its reign since its inception in 2014. Some even believe that Ethereum might touch the lofty $10,000 mark by 2025.\n\nHowever, the journey to such heights isn't devoid of challenges. Ethereum's scalability issues, long a thorn in its side, threaten to bottleneck its growth. The 50% drop in TVL since April shows that the lingering issue is starting to take its toll.\n\nTechnically speaking, the $2,000 resistance looms large for the Ethereum price. Should it manage to pierce this resistance, Ethereum could quickly ascend toward $2,500, before a larger move to $10,000.\n\nLitecoin (LTC) Completes Halving Event\n\nSimilar to Ethereum, Litecoin has managed to remain a top-tier asset to date. The world's first 'silver' cryptocurrency has held its own against the likes of Bitcoin Cash and Ripple over the years.\n\nHowever, interest in Litecoin is dropping to record-low levels in 2023. This was showcased during the most recent Litecoin halving event, which saw the Litecoin price pump from $65 to $114 in months, only for it to crash just as quickly. Litecoin now trades at $62.91.\n\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale\n\nWebsite: https://www.everlodge.io/"

She revealed that a developer within the Milady ecosystem had successfully diverted approximately $1 million in generated fees away from Remilia Corporation.\n\nI am heartbroken that there were people within this brilliant, loving community with so much wealth and enrichment for everyone involved that would scheme from within for short term profit at the expense of everything we have built together.

        "content": "Not a single fraud proof has been submitted on Arbitrum since it first launched its mainnet with the built-in security feature in August 2021, according to Ed Felten, co-founder and chief scientist of the Arbitrum-building Offchain Labs.\n\nOperating as an Ethereum layer-2, Arbitrum\u2019s interactive, multi-round fraud proofs work by allowing a layer-1 verifier contract to decide whether the challenger\u2019s fraud-proof submission is valid. If so, the fraudulent validator\u2019s stake is slashed.\n\nFraud proofs are submitted by challenging validators when they considers another validator to have fraudulently or otherwise incorrectly assembled an incoming batch of transactions into the next block.\n\nHowever, Arbitrum\u2019s mainnet is yet to see a fraud-proof attempt let alone a successful challenge, Felten told Cointelegraph at Korean Blockchain Week on Sept. 4:\n\n\u201cNot on mainnet. We did have one or two on Ethereum proof-of-work (PoW). After the Merge, [...] there was a version of Arbitrum running on the Ethereum PoW fork, and somebody did try to steal all the data, and there was a successful challenge which defeated that.\u201d\n\nfraud-proofFelten said few fraud proof attempts had been made because malicious-intended validators risk losing their entire stake.\n\n\u201cIf any one person notices it and disputes your claim then you will surely lose your stake, so there\u2019s a stronger disincentive to try,\u201d Felten added.\n\nBoth Arbitrum and Optimism operate as optimistic rollups!\n\n\n\nHowever, Optimism and Arbitrum differ in their approaches to fraud-proof mechanisms.\n\n\n\nArbitrum: multi-round \u2192 longer confirmation times, more secure\n\nOptimism: single-round \u2192 faster\n\n\n\n4/ pic.twitter.com/mp0Nj86Fxz \u2014 The Smart Ape (@the_smart_ape) September 1, 2023\n\nFelten said there\u2019s currently a permissioned set of validators \u2014 roughly 12 \u2014 that participate in the fraud-proof game.\n\nHe also added that Arbitrum is rolling out a new iteration of the fraud proofs called \u201cBOLD\u201d protocol \u2014 (Bounded Liquidity Delay) \u2014 which he says gives Arbitrum a faster guarantee for challenges.\n\n\u201cIn the current version [...] an adversary who\u2019s willing to sacrifice multiple stakes can arrange to cause \u2018N\u2019 weeks of delay if they\u2019re willing to sacrifice \u2018N' stakes [...] But the BOLD protocol says no matter how many stakes they sacrifice, they\u2019ll be defeated in about eight days.\u201d\n\nRelated: Arbitrum founder says Stylus is a game changer for EVMs\n\nArbitrum\u2019s BOLD protocol was rolled out by Offchain Labs on Aug. 4.\n\nAfter months in dev, we\u2019re announcing BOLD (Bounded Liquidity Delay), a new dispute protocol that enables permissionless validation for Arbitrum chains, potentially removing the need for permissioned validation, dramatically improving decentralization. https://t.co/SHegVRGqXf \u2014 Offchain Labs (@OffchainLabs) August 3, 2023\n\nFelten said Arbitrum\u2019s fraud proof feature will soon be permissionless, allowing anyone to push towards ensuring the correctness of the chain when challenges are made.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: DeFi Dad, Hall of Flame: Ethereum is \u2018woefully undervalued\u2019 but growing more powerful"

        "title": "Today the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum is decreasing slightly - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Today the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum is down slightly.\n\nThese are actually minimal movements, but probably indirectly related to what is happening in traditional financial markets.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin and Ethereum today\n\nToday the price of BTC fell below $25,600, but only for a few moments. What matters is that it fell below $25,700.\n\nIn fact, it had not fallen significantly below that threshold since 7 September.\n\nTaking the last few days as a reference, that was precisely the support that seemed to have always held, except for a few rare moments. However, today it did not hold.\n\nOn 7 September it had also fallen below $25,600 as well, but without going below $25,500. Today it seems to be doing much the same thing.\n\nBy contrast, on 1 September it had fallen as low as $25,300, so today\u2019s slight drop for now turns out to be perfectly in line with what happened in September.\n\nThen again, this month up to now has seen very low volatility, because against a low at $25,300 the high was only $26,400, and eleven consecutive days within such a compressed range is not at all common.\n\nThe days of July seem to be back, after a slightly more eventful August, with volatility at lows for an asset that is usually quite volatile.\n\nThe price of ETH\n\nA slightly different matter is the price of ETH.\n\nIn fact, it fell as low as below $1,580 today, albeit only for a brief moment, and is still well below $1,600.\n\nTo find such low levels one has to go back to the sharp drop on 18 August, when within three days it lost nearly 14%.\n\nIn fact, it had previously remained consistently above $1,600 until 13 March, and that of today is a similar level to that of 12 January.\n\nIt is enough to say that compared to the beginning of the year BTC is still at +54%, while for ETH the gain has shrunk to 32%. In this respect it is also doing worse than XRP and TRX (Tron), but it is generally normal for Ethereum to perform worse than Bitcoin during crypto winters.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s price lateralization before today\n\nIndeed, it is in fact continuing the lateralization triggered in mid-March.\n\nIn January and February, prices had risen again, only to fall in early March. In the second half of March they went up again, but only to begin a long lateralization that is still ongoing.\n\nFor example, Bitcoin\u2018s price exceeded $25,000 on 17 March, and it has almost always remained above this threshold since then, except for a couple of days in mid-June.\n\nIt has also never exceeded $31,800, which is currently the main resistance, the breaking of which could mean the end of the long period of lateralization.\n\nThe markets\u2019 expectation\n\nMoreover, these days the markets are in frantic anticipation of the August US inflation data to be released on Wednesday.\n\nFor instance, today the price of Bitcoin had fallen just before the opening of the Asian exchanges, fearing a drop that subsequently occurred.\n\nHowever, the decline in the Asian exchanges, and Hong Kong\u2019s in particular, stopped, and with the Dollar Index down slightly Bitcoin had recovered somewhat.\n\nSubsequently, the Dollar Index\u2019s trend reversed, with DXY rising back above 104.7 points, and Bitcoin\u2019s price went back down.\n\nIt is worth noting that markets are betting on the Fed ending its rate hike, so much so that they believe the figure released on Wednesday could be positive.\n\nIn reality the forecast is for a rise in overall inflation (from 3.2% to 3.6%), but for a net decline in core inflation (from 4.7% to 4.3%), and since it is mainly the latter that matters to the Fed it is assumed that at least in September rates will not be raised again.\n\nHowever, while markets\u2019 forecasts of inflation data have often been quite correct lately, it is not certain that the actual data released on Wednesday will be in line with expectations. If they are significantly different, markets could react sharply, and even suddenly.\n\nAt times of such expectation, it is more than fair to expect markets to be stagnant, or nearly so, since the Fed\u2019s monetary policy remains at this time the main single factor that can profoundly influence them."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin disclosed that he had fallen victim to a SIM swap attack. This startling admission unfolded during a conversation on Farcaster, a decentralized social media network, where Buterin candidly shared the details of his ordeal and the key lessons learned.\n\nThe malicious attacker exploited a SIM-swap vulnerability, leading to the compromise of his Twitter account, Buterin recounted, as he successfully regained control of his T-Mobile account in the aftermath. He highlighted the inherent risk of using a phone number for password recovery on Twitter, even when it is employed for two-factor authentication [2FA].\n\nHe therefore urged users to \u201ccompletely remove [their] phone from Twitter,\u201d offering an additional layer of protection against such exploits. On September 9, hackers illegally took over Buterin\u2019s Twitter account and posted a fraudulent NFT giveaway. Gullible users who clicked on the malicious link collectively suffered losses exceeding $691,000.\n\nThe following day, Ethereum developer Tim Beiko also called for the removal of phone numbers from Twitter accounts and the implementation of 2FA as a default security protocol. \u201cIf you have a phone number linked to your account, even with other 2FA, it can be used to reset your PW. You need to specifically disable it and remove the phone.\u201d\n\nIn a SIM-swap attack, scammers seized control of a victim\u2019s mobile phone number, which they used to exploit 2FA to infiltrate social media platforms, banking systems, and cryptocurrency accounts. T-Mobile, the mobile carrier affiliated with Buterin\u2019s SIM card, has faced scrutiny for its role in similar attacks in the past.\n\nEthereum Hit Hard By FTX Dumping\n\nThe Ethereum founder\u2019s latest ordeal serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities associated with phone numbers in the realm of online security. The crypto community was further jolted when a substantial 2,000 ETH, equivalent to approximately $3.12 million, were illicitly transferred from Buterin\u2019s wallet to another, magnifying the urgency of bolstering security measures within the crypto sphere.\n\nIn the midst of these developments, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has not remained immune to the broader market downturn. This decline comes as the financially troubled cryptocurrency exchange FTX aims to offload its crypto assets. Presently, Ethereum is changing hands at $1,543, marking its lowest price point in half a year."

        "content": "In a recent YouTube video, Benjamin Cowen, a well-known crypto analyst, shared his thoughts on the future price movements of Ethereum. Cowen suggested that the cryptocurrency might not only experience a lower low but could potentially see its price fall below $800. He mentioned that while the decline might not be drastic, Ethereum could even touch price points as low as $600, $500, or $400.\n\nExpanding on Ethereum\u2019s possible price trajectory, Cowen described a scenario where the cryptocurrency could undergo a series of fluctuations. According to him, Ethereum might witness periods of slow decline, punctuated by brief spikes in price, and this pattern could continue until the end of the pre-halving year, leaving both bullish and bearish investors in a state of financial disarray. Cowen explained that each faction might feel they were correct for a portion of the year, only to find out that their predictions were accurate for just half the time, resulting in financial setbacks for all involved by the year\u2019s end.\n\nIn a separate video released late last month, Cowen shifted his focus to Cardano (ADA), another leading cryptocurrency. He warned that Cardano might be entering a \u201cdepression\u201d phase, which could substantially decrease its price. Drawing parallels with the Nasdaq\u2019s 50% drop, Cowen stated that a similar decline for Cardano, calculated from its then-level of $0.37, could push its price below $0.20.\n\nCowen also offered alternative methods for assessing Cardano\u2019s potential price decline. He indicated that a 27% drop from a lower base could bring Cardano\u2019s price to around $0.16, a level it last saw in August 2020. He further highlighted other significant price levels for Cardano, such as the $0.11 mark, which was its high in 2019, and the pre-pandemic high that hovered around $0.07 or $0.08.\n\nCowen emphasized the unpredictability of the cryptocurrency\u2019s price if it enters a depression phase. He cautioned that Cardano could experience several consecutive weeks of price decline, with the possibility of brief recoveries that might tempt investors into taking greater risks. Specifically, Cowen mentioned that Cardano\u2019s price could \u201cpop back up for another couple of weeks just to make it so that people YOLO in one last time,\u201d underlining the overall high risk and advising investors to remain vigilant.\n\nFeatured Image via Midjourney"

        "content": "In an era where digital security has become paramount, the recent breach experienced by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin serves as a stark reminder of the lurking vulnerabilities. Buterin confirmed that his Twitter account, a platform with millions of users and significant influence, was compromised due to a SIM-swap attack. This incident underscores the risks associated with mobile-based security measures and emphasizes the need for heightened awareness and proactive measures, especially in sectors like cryptocurrency and social media platforms.\n\nThe intricacies of the SIM-swap attack\n\nA SIM-swap, or sim jacking, is a malicious technique where hackers manipulate telecom providers to gain control over a victim\u2019s mobile phone number. Once they control the number, these cybercriminals can bypass two-factor authentication (2FA) measures, granting them access to many personal accounts ranging from social media to banking and cryptocurrency wallets.\n\nButerin\u2019s experience with this attack method was particularly alarming. Speaking on the decentralized social media network Farcaster on September 12, he detailed how the attacker managed to engineer T-Mobile socially, leading to the unauthorized takeover of his phone number. He stated, \u201cYes, it was a SIM swap, meaning that someone socially engineered T-Mobile itself to take over my phone number.\u201d\n\nThis breach had severe consequences. On September 9, the hacker, having gained control over Buterin\u2019s Twitter account, posted a deceptive NFT giveaway. Unsuspecting users were lured into clicking a malicious link, ultimately leading to a collective loss of over $691,000.\n\nThe aftermath and lessons learned\n\nButerin\u2019s ordeal with the SIM swap attack highlighted some critical security insights. He emphasized the potential risks associated with linking phone numbers to online platforms, especially when they aren\u2019t used as a part of the 2FA process. \u201cA phone number is sufficient to password reset a Twitter account even if not used as 2FA,\u201d Buterin warned. He further advised users to consider removing their phone numbers from platforms like Twitter, admitting, \u201cI had seen the \u2018phone numbers are insecure, don\u2019t authenticate with them\u2019 advice before, but did not realize this.\u201d\n\nFollowing the incident, Ethereum developer Tim Beiko echoed Buterin\u2019s sentiments, strongly advocating removing phone numbers from Twitter accounts. He also emphasized the importance of enabling 2FA. Addressing platform owner Elon Musk, Beiko suggested, \u201cSeems like a no-brainer to have this default on, or to default turn it on when an account reaches, say, >10k followers.\u201d\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s troubled history with SIM-swap attacks\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first instance of T-Mobile being entangled in controversies related to SIM-swap attacks. The telecom giant has faced legal challenges due to similar security breaches. In 2020, T-Mobile was embroiled in a lawsuit for allegedly facilitating the theft of a staggering $8.7 million cryptocurrency through a series of SIM-swap attacks. The troubles didn\u2019t end there. In February 2021, another lawsuit was filed against the company when a customer lost $450,000 in Bitcoin again due to a SIM-swap attack.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese incidents serve as a stark reminder of the evolving nature of cyber threats and the importance of robust security measures. As technology continues to advance, so do the methods employed by cybercriminals. It\u2019s imperative for individuals and corporations alike to stay informed and vigilant, ensuring that their digital assets and personal information remain secure."

        "title": "The X account of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin was hacked in a phishing attack with $700000 worth of crypto ... - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In a shocking twist, the X account (formerly Twitter) of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin was recently compromised, leading to a crypto theft of as much as $700,000 worth of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nThe article delves into the details of this audacious phishing attack, shedding light on the tactics employed by the attackers and the tools used to execute their nefarious plan.\n\nVitalik Buterin: the phishing attack of the co-founder of crypto project Ethereum\n\nThe attack took place when Buterin\u2019s X account was covertly taken over by hackers.\n\nSubsequently, the compromised account was used to promote a fake NFT commemorative coin.\n\nThe bait was enticing, as the scam claimed to have a limited-time offer, inviting users to quickly mint these commemorative NFTs.\n\nHowever, the link provided led to a phishing website that posed a significant threat to unsuspecting victims.\n\nEstimates by cryptocurrency investigator ZachXBT and data on the chain indicate that the phishing attack resulted in the loss of approximately $700,000 in cryptocurrency and NFT assets.\n\nSpecifically, among the stolen assets was a valuable CryptoPunk NFT valued at 153 ETH, equivalent to $250,000. In addition, numerous individuals lost large amounts of Ether during the attack.\n\nThe modus operandi of the attack involved the use of a famous tool in the cryptocurrency world, known as \u201cPink drainer software.\u201d\n\nThis software, which is used to drain NFTs and cryptocurrencies from unsuspecting victims, has gained notoriety for its involvement in several high-profile phishing attacks throughout the year.\n\nIt is essential to understand that Pink drainer software is often created and sold by malicious actors to people interested in conducting phishing attacks.\n\nIn exchange for using this software, attackers typically share a portion of the ill-gotten gains with its creator. In some cases, the creators themselves engage in attacks using their own software, adding a layer of complexity to these malicious activities.\n\nNoteworthy targets\n\nThe attackers who compromised Vitalik Buterin\u2019s X account are not the first to use this method. They join a growing list of malicious actors who have targeted prominent individuals and organizations in the crypto space.\n\nThese attacks often involve perpetrators masquerading as journalists, claiming to be affiliated with crypto media. A common tactic is to persuade targets to insert a seemingly innocent document into their browsers, which ultimately enables the injection of malicious code.\n\nIn light of the persistent threat of phishing attacks, it is imperative that cryptocurrency enthusiasts and NFT holders take precautionary measures.\n\nOne effective strategy is to store valuable NFTs and larger cryptocurrencies in cold storage rather than hot wallets, which are more susceptible to attacks.\n\nEmerging tools such as Delegate Cash are also proving valuable, as they allow NFT owners to delegate the rights of their NFTs to other wallets.\n\nThis delegation allows access to exclusive areas of the NFT community, such as Discord servers, without the constant use of the wallet that holds the NFT.\n\nThe continuing battle against phishing attacks\n\nThe takeover of Vitalik Buterin\u2019s X account is just one episode in a long series of phishing attacks that have targeted prominent figures and organizations in the cryptocurrency and NFT ecosystem.\n\nThe scale and sophistication of these attacks underscore the importance of ongoing efforts to combat and mitigate these threats.\n\nOne of the key pillars of defense against phishing attacks is user awareness. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts, investors, and NFT collectors must remain vigilant and skeptical when linking to online content and links, especially when it comes to financial transactions or transferring valuable assets.\n\nBeing cautious of unsolicited messages, checking the authenticity of websites, and verifying the legitimacy of offers can be very helpful to avoid falling victim to phishing schemes.\n\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA)\n\nImplementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) is another key step in strengthening defenses against unauthorized access to online accounts.\n\nMFA requires users to provide two or more forms of authentication before granting access, making it much more difficult for attackers to compromise accounts.\n\nUsers are strongly encouraged to activate MFA whenever possible, particularly for their cryptocurrency wallets and accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nPhishing attacks are a collective concern within the crypto community, and collaboration among community members can be a powerful defense.\n\nReporting suspicious activity, sharing information about known threats, and collectively promoting stronger security measures within the industry can help reduce the overall impact of phishing attacks.\n\nRegulatory measures\n\nAs the crypto space matures, regulators increasingly recognize the need for robust security measures.\n\nRegulatory bodies and industry associations are collaborating to establish guidelines and standards that can help protect users from phishing attacks and other forms of fraud.\n\nCompliance with these regulations and adherence to industry best practices are essential to safeguarding both individual users and the cryptographic ecosystem at large.\n\nConclusion: the unfortunate incident involving Ethereum crypto co-founder Vitalik Buterin\n\nThe unfortunate incident involving the compromise of Vitalik Buterin\u2019s X account serves as a reminder of the persistent threat posed by phishing attacks in the cryptocurrency and NFT space.\n\nThese attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and target high-profile individuals and organizations. However, by remaining vigilant, implementing security measures such as multi-factor authentication, and actively participating in the crypto community\u2019s efforts to combat these threats, users can better protect themselves and their valuable assets.\n\nIn an industry that prides itself on decentralization and individual power, security awareness and proactive measures are key to maintaining the trust and integrity of the cryptocurrency and NFT ecosystem.\n\nThe cryptocurrency community continues to evolve, as does its commitment to the safety and security of its participants."

This isn\u2019t merely a currency but a tokenized representation of the platform\u2019s innovative spirit, and it plays a pivotal role in a rewards ecosystem that has the potential to redefine crypto-based incentives.\n\nWith its presale price witnessing an impressive 150% ascent since the presale started, whispers within the Ethereum and Bitcoin forums suggest that TCRV could be the next crypto darling, given its potential and the innovative solutions it brings to the table.\n\nCurrently priced at a humble $0.025 per token, market analysts predict a remarkable surge in value to $1.00 once Tradecurve Markets enters mainstream trading platforms. This could be the start of a new gold rush for crypto enthusiasts, and it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Enthusiasts Eyeing Tradecurve Markets (TCRV)\u2019s Promising Presale\n\nIn the realm of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has been the epitome of an exhilarating adventure, particularly during the recent second quarter. After experiencing a significant decline to $24,800 in mid-June, it defied expectations and swiftly surged to surpass $31,000 in just seven days.\n\nHowever, the celebration came to a halt when Bitcoin encountered a barrier at the $31,800 resistance level. Since then, it has been a challenging journey for Bitcoin, sliding down a slippery slope. After plummeting below the critical $29,500 \u2013 $30,000 range, Bitcoin has suffered a loss of over 20% and is currently trading around a rather subdued $25,850.\n\nPreviously, murmurs of potential Bitcoin ETF approvals brought a shimmer of hope, painting dreams of mainstream institutional influx. But with that shimmer fading, the big question looms: What\u2019s the next spark for Bitcoin\u2019s fireworks?\n\nAs Bitcoin continues its turbulent journey, Tradecurve Markets\u2019 presale is capturing attention as the fresh face in the market. The current TCRV discounts and bonuses give Bitcoin holders a chance to make gains while the ETF decision awaits.\n\n>>Register For The Tradecurve Markets Presale<<\n\nEthereum (ETH): Awaiting a Break Through the $2,100 Resistance Zone\n\nEthereum is no stranger to volatility. After seeing a steady rise in Q2 from $1,377 to a peak of $2,135, the Ethereum price has retraced back to $1,629 after falling from an ascending trendline.\n\nHowever, the declining price doesn\u2019t negate the positive developments in the Ethereum ecosystem. An impressive TVL of $21 billion underscores the growing momentum for Ethereum-based DeFi.\n\nEthereum holders, while happy with developments, are tired of holding Ethereum under the $2,100 resistance zone that has stopped growth for more than 15 months now. The Tradecurve Markets presale provides Ethereum holders a chance to make gains while they wait for the right moment.\n\nAnalysts note that surpassing the $2,100 is key to starting a new Ethereum bull run. Should this occur, a run to $10,000 is possible in the long run, but that is still a distant dream at the moment.\n\nFor more information about the Tradecurve Markets (TCRV) presale:\n\nWebsite: https://tradecurvemarkets.com/\n\nBuy presale: https://app.tradecurvemarkets.com/sign-up\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

        "title": "ETH Price Forecast 2023: Will Ethereum Price Rise or Fall More? - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, who co-founded Ethereum, may have a plan for his ETH holdings, according to Spotonchain; a community on CoinMarketCap which is the crypto analysis website. He might deposit more ETH to Bitstamp, a crypto exchange platform, based on his wallet and transaction analysis. His move could have various effects such as increasing liquidity, reducing volatility, or preparing for a major announcement.\n\nEthereum crypto plummeted by 2.04% in market value and surged by 89.94% in trading volume in the last 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap which is a crypto data and information website. Its market value is $189,854,788,251 and its trading volume is $8,707,931,879. There are 120,221,729 ETH in circulation.\n\nTechnical Analysis of ETH on 1-D Time Frame\n\nETH has been on a rising trend since November 2022 even before 2023 began. The ETH price found strong support around $1070 and was bought heavily at that time. The price climbed steadily without breaking the trendline from $1070 to $2140, reaching the yearly high by April 16th, 2023. The price also followed the Fibonacci levels and respected them effectively as seen on the charts.\n\nHowever, the ETH turned bearish by April 19th and broke the most important trendline that it was following faithfully on August 17th, 2023. The current market price is between the Fibo 50.00% and 61.80% level trying to hold but it slipped below the previous low. The market character will change due to this and turn the overall trend bearish as well.\n\nTherefore, to continue its uptrend, the price must treat this as a pullback and then it might rise up or beyond resistance levels of $1665 and $1735.\n\nHowever, if the price falls below the previous low then the change of character might lead to a downfall and the supports will be $1490 and $1397.\n\nSource: ETH/USD.1D.BITSTAMP by TradingView\n\nAt the time of publishing, Ethereum (ETH) is trading below the 20 and 50-day EMA, showing positive signs on daily charts. RSI is around 34, and below the neutral line whereas MACD indicates bearishness to consolidation as the gap is lean. Collectively, the indicators say that the prices may consolidate with a bearish bias.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe ETH crypto price prediction shows a neutral to negative outlook from investors and traders in the daily time frame. Ethereum price action reveals a neutral to downward trend at the time of writing. Moreover, the daily chart shows that the price might either consolidate or keep going down, according to the RSI, EMA, and MACD.\n\nTechnical Levels\n\nSupport levels: The nearest support levels are $1490 and $1397\n\nThe nearest support levels are $1490 and $1397 Resistance levels: The nearest resistance levels are $1665 and $1735\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn this article, the views and opinions stated by the author, or any people named are for informational purposes only, and they don\u2019t establish the investment, financial, or any other advice.

        "content": "Justin Sun has revealed plans to buy up FTX\u2019s holding tokens so as to relieve the market of the selling pressure.\n\nInvestors have been dumping ahead of a possible approval for FTX to liquidate its holding tokens later this week.\n\nTron founder Justin Sun has revealed his plans to save the crypto market from a possible price bloodbath. FTX bankruptcy filings have recently revealed that the collapsed exchange seeks to liquidate its holding tokens. With a court approval likely to be granted on September 13th, investors are concerned that billions worth of assets will be dumped on the market.\n\nAn updated FTX asset report shows that the exchange holds around $3.4 billion worth of assets. The biggest holding asset is Solana (SOL) worth around $1.16 billion. Bitcoin (BTC) is a little over $500 million and nearly $192 million in Ethereum (ETH). As for Tron (TRX), the stash accounts for 12 percent of the total, around $33 million.\n\nMarket experts have been quick to stop ongoing fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) that the exchange will dump all the assets upon approval. Contrary, the exchange will not flood the market with all the assets. There will be a structured framework to sell these tokens, such as $200m a week. In the case of SOL, the tokens are locked for years, OTC buyers will get FTX\u2019s vesting contract. Additionally, a majority of tokens will not be sold on the open market but will be sold on OTC or gradually via market makers.\n\nIt is unlikely that Sun would be able to buy the whole stash but his efforts will help shield the market from a plunge. This will go a long way to ensuring market stability during a potentially turbulent phase. Sun will likely buy the TRX stash first before making an offer for the rest of the tokens.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1701265627741335573?\n\nCrypto Market Reaction to FTX Liquidation\n\nSince the reports of the liquidation emerged, the crypto market has entered into a bearish trend. In the last 7 days, SOL which has been the greatest loser has lost nearly 7 percent. However, the altcoin has begun the week stronger, marking a marginal positive gain.\n\nTRX has responded positively to the news of its founder saving the market and has recorded a 2 percent gain in the last 24 hours.\n\nWith much of the uncertainty now addressed, investors are now more confident and have stopped dumping their stash on fears that the market will be flooded. As a result, the market is showing signs of revival with a majority of cryptocurrencies trading in the green. If the market can sustain the positive momentum, altcoins can climb back above key supports breached during liquidation woes.\n\nNoteworthy, on top of its crypto stash, FTX and its executives own 38 properties in the Bahamas which were all appraised at $199 million."

        "content": "Buterin Regains Control of T-Mobile Account, Unearths SIM-Swap Culprit\n\nEthereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has uncovered the truth behind the recent hack of his X (Twitter) account. In a revelation made on the decentralized social media platform Farcaster on September 12, Buterin confirmed that a SIM-swap attack was the cause of the breach.\n\nLessons Learned and Security Implications\n\nThe tech luminary, who has since regained control of his T-Mobile account, shed light on the incident. \"Yes, it was a SIM swap, meaning that someone socially-engineered T-Mobile itself to take over my phone number,\" explained Buterin.\n\nReflecting on the episode, Buterin shared valuable lessons and insights with the community. He emphasized that a phone number alone can serve as the gateway to resetting a Twitter account's password, even without being used as two-factor authentication (2FA). He urged users to consider removing their phone numbers entirely from their Twitter profiles, noting that he had previously underestimated the vulnerability associated with phone numbers in this context.\n\nScammers Exploit the Hack for a Fake NFT Giveaway\n\nThe security breach occurred on September 9, when Buterin's X account was commandeered by scammers. They used the account to orchestrate a fraudulent NFT giveaway, luring victims to click on a malicious link. Unfortunately, this scheme resulted in collective losses exceeding $691,000 for those who fell victim to the deception.\n\nIndustry Recommendations for Enhanced Security\n\nIn the wake of this incident, Ethereum developer Tim Beiko urged users to remove their phone numbers from their X accounts and activate 2FA as an additional layer of security. Beiko suggested that it should be standard practice for accounts with substantial followings, proposing an automatic activation of 2FA when an account reaches a certain follower threshold, such as 10,000 followers. These recommendations were conveyed to platform owner Elon Musk.\n\nTwitter opsec PSA:\n\n\n\nIf you have a phone number linked on your account, even with other 2FA, it can be used to reset your PW. Need to specifically disable it + remove phone #.\n\n\n\nIf your Twitter account pre-dates crypto, strongly recommend double-checking, and adding strong 2FA! pic.twitter.com/uXrvHYhQvJ \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) September 9, 2023\n\nSIM-Swap Attacks: A Persistent Threat\n\nA SIM-swap attack, also known as simjacking, is a technique employed by hackers to take control of a victim's mobile phone number. With access to the victim's number, scammers can manipulate two-factor authentication (2FA) processes, potentially gaining access to social media, banking, and cryptocurrency accounts.\n\nThis is not the first instance of T-Mobile being linked to such attacks. In 2020, the telecommunications giant faced a lawsuit over allegations that it enabled the theft of $8.7 million worth of cryptocurrency through a series of SIM-swap attacks. T-Mobile was once again embroiled in a legal dispute in February 2021 when a customer lost $450,000 in Bitcoin due to another SIM-swap attack."
