        "title": "Ethereum: Will Alameda\u2019s latest move affect ETH prices? - AMBCrypto English",
        "content": "Alameda Research\u2019s ETH holdings were moved.\n\nInterest from whales in ETH was high.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] price rallied quite a bit over the last few weeks, after BTC\u2019s prices surged. This momentum inspired optimism in the market towards ETH, however, it could soon come to an end.\n\nIs ETH in trouble?\n\nAlameda Research, the cryptocurrency trading firm founded by Sam Bankman Fried, recently, moved most of its assets.\n\nOne of the largest moves made by the firm was the offloading of a bunch of its ETH. According to lookonchain\u2019s data, the firm transferred 1,643 ETH. This amounted to almost $3.43 million.\n\nThis sell-off could affect the price of ETH going forward. Solana faced a similar issue when news broke that Alameda Research will be allowed to move its funds.\n\nHowever, SOL was one of their largest holdings, so the potential price response to this move would be very large. The same couldn\u2019t be said about ETH, as Alameda, despite holding a large amount of ETH, could not make a similar level of impact with its sell-off.\n\nWhales show faith\n\nHowever, the behavior of other whales coinciding with this move could affect market sentiment in the future.\n\nAt press time ETH was trading at $2,095.05 and its price had fallen by 0.05%. Luckily for ETH, other whales were not as interested in selling their ETH.\n\nAccording to Santiment\u2019s data, the percentage of addresses holding ETH had grown. This suggested that large addresses were continuing to show interest in ETH.\n\nIf the pattern persists, the growing interest shown by whales may help ETH in resisting massive sell-offs such as the Alameda Research move.\n\nThis will play a key role in the future of ETH, especially as the MVRV ratio for ETH grows, which means that the number of ETH holders will be profitable.\n\nDue to this, retail investors may want to sell their holdings in the future for some profit which whale interest may protect ETH against.\n\nState of the network\n\nHowever, the high concentration of whales may have negative consequences for ETH as well.\n\nThe whales may be able to manipulate the price of ETH, due to their large positions, and they could leave retail investors in the dust.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nComing to the state of the network, it was seen that the gas usage on Ethereum remained consistent.\n\nEven though gas usage was on the rise, interest in NFTs on Ethereum had started to fall."

        "title": "Chainlink: What It Is and How It Works - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is Chainlink?\n\nChainlink (LINK) is a cryptocurrency and technology platform that enables non-blockchain enterprises to securely connect with blockchain platforms. Chainlink is middleware that connects blockchain-based smart contracts with external data, such as baseball scores or stock prices. Chainlink's LINK currency pays Chainlink network operators and collateralizes the network's smart contract agreements.\n\nChainlink is a decentralized oracle network or blockchain abstraction layer. Chainlink uses blockchain technology to securely enable computations on- and off-chain, supporting what it calls hybrid smart contracts and its cross-chain interoperability protocol.\n\n\n\nThe Chainlink blockchain is hosted on the Ethereum platform, which uses the proof-of-stake operating protocol. In addition, Chainlink is an open-source blockchain project, meaning anyone can view the project's code and contribute.\n\nKey Takeaways Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that connects blockchains with off-chain data.\n\nChainlink uses hybrid smart contracts to integrate on-chain code and off-chain data infrastructure.\n\nChainlink tokens\u2014called LINK\u2014serve as currency to pay Chainlink network operators for retrieving and preparing off-chain data and performing computations.\n\nUnderstanding Chainlink\n\nThe Chainlink blockchain can support the secure sharing of inputs, outputs, and computations. Some features of Chainlink include:\n\nSupporting decentralized data feeds : Data from many sources can be securely collected and processed for hybrid smart contracts.\n\n: Data from many sources can be securely collected and processed for hybrid smart contracts. Providing verifiable sources of randomness : Applications such as games that require cryptographically secured randomness can use Chainlink.\n\n: Applications such as games that require cryptographically secured randomness can use Chainlink. Enabling automation : Chainlink smart contracts can automate critical functions and event-driven tasks for enterprises.\n\n: Chainlink smart contracts can automate critical functions and event-driven tasks for enterprises. Supporting cross-blockchain interoperability: Chainlink can connect blockchain platforms to support the exchange of messages, tokens, and specific actions.\n\nChainlink is a blockchain-based decentralized oracle network that was launched in 2017. Oracles are networking tools that connect blockchains to external systems, thereby allowing smart contracts to execute based on inputs and outputs originating from the blockchain.\n\nThough traditional oracles are centralized, Chainlink decentralizes the process of moving data on and off blockchains through \"hybrid smart contracts.\" LINK tokens are used to reward Chainlink network operators for retrieving data from off-chain feeds, formatting data into accessible formats, and performing off-chain computations.\n\nThe Chainlink decentralized oracle network is a system of nodes that adhere to set protocols. Node operators are required to stake\u2014lock a specific number of\u2014their LINK tokens. Node operators set their own fees based on demand for the off-chain resource they provide.\n\nChainlink node operators with the largest stakes are the best positioned to earn LINK rewards.\n\nBecause Chainlink allows blockchains to exchange data with off-chain systems in a decentralized and tamper-resistant way, the Chainlink oracle network has many use cases. Chainlink has been used to fairly distribute non-fungible tokens (NFTs), gamify personal savings, and facilitate recalibrations of cryptocurrency token supplies, among other applications.\n\nChainlink was created by Sergey Nazarov and Steve Ellis, who authored a 2017 white paper with Ari Juels. The network launched in 2019. LINK is an ERC-20 token, meaning that it is compatible with other currencies and smart contracts supported by the Ethereum platform.\n\n\n\nHow Does Chainlink Differ From Ethereum?\n\nThe Chainlink network is, in some ways, a complement to the Ethereum network and other blockchains. Chainlink can facilitate secure communications between Ethereum projects and various off-chain data. Because Chainlink's LINK token is built on the Ethereum platform, LINK is compliant with the Ethereum platform's protocols.\n\nEthereum tokens can be used to spend on purchases, facilitate smart contracts, and pay validators for operating the Ethereum network. Chainlink tokens have only a single use case, which is to pay node operators in the Chainlink network.\n\nThe proof-of-stake mechanism rewards network participants for placing a freeze on the ETH they \"stake\" or put up as collateral for the chance to earn rewards.\n\nGoals of Chainlink\n\nChainlink aims to continue to grow by expanding its support for blockchain environments and facilitating new use cases for hybrid smart contracts. Because significant stores of data and records are not yet maintained within blockchains, Chainlink may have countless opportunities to connect blockchain networks with off-chain information.\n\nIn 2021, the Chainlink network secured more than $75 billion of value as it grew to include over 1,000 projects. Chainlink has a maximum supply of 1 billion tokens, of which about 557 million have been issued (as of December 2023).\n\nWhat Can I Buy With LINK? LINK cryptocurrency is used to incentivize Chainlink node operators rather than being designed for everyday purchases. These network participants, tasked with securely transferring data to and from blockchains, are paid in LINK.\n\nWhy Is Chainlink Popular? The Chainlink decentralized oracle can connect many types of data with various blockchains, creating many potential applications for Chainlink. Chainlink could help to integrate blockchain technology with many industries and business functions.\n\nIs Chainlink Made by Oracle? Oracle Corp. (ORCL) is a computer technology company specializing in database management. Chainlink is not affiliated with Oracle Corp. Chainlink refers to itself as a decentralized oracle network, with the \"oracle\" being a broad-based group of intermediaries that connect blockchains with off-chain information systems.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nChainlink is a blockchain project designed to connect different networks and protocols together through oracles. Oracles are networking tools that allow cross-network communication. The project's goal is to provide support for all blockchains, facilitating data movement globally between blockchains.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "content": "Peter Szilagyi, the team lead of Ethereum, has expressed frustration over his alma mater's lack of interest in providing opportunities for students to collaborate with Ethereum (ETH).\n\nIn a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter), Szilagyi explained that he had always felt a lack of genuine interest when he returned to his old university to deliver talks about Ethereum.\n\nHe stated that the students appeared to be more focused on the price of Ethereum rather than the project itself. ETH has increased 20.10% over the last 30 days. At the time of publication, ETH's current price is $1,698.72.\n\n\u201cThe audience seems to have been stuck in the number go up aspect; and the organizers always used it as an ad campaign.\u201d\n\nOver the past years I've been asked many times to do talks at my old university about #Ethereum. I did a couple of them, but didn't feel genuine interest.\n\n\n\nThe audience seems to have been stuck in the number go up aspect; and the organizers always used it as an ad campaign. 1/4 \u2014 P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi (karalabe.eth) (@peter_szilagyi) December 2, 2023\n\nSzilagyi noted that this year he organized a grant for 9 students to participate in Devconnect, including flights and accommodation. However, he claims the students are not aware of who is funding the initiative.\n\n\u201cI haven't met the students myself, but someone supposedly has. They had no clue where the grant came from,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cFigured lets see if this piqued some interest. Wrote to a bunch of old university contacts (including the person through whom I have the grant) if they could recommend some students to potentially collab on some stuff (paid).\u201d\n\nHowever, Szilagyi insists that the university neglected to respond to his emails, leaving him in the dark about the outcome.\n\n\u201cTwo [weeks] later, zero effs, not even a response,\u201d he declared.\n\nHowever, recent reports suggest a growing demand for crypto and blockchain courses in universities.\n\nRelated: Ethereum price rallies toward key resistance but is ETH\u2019s strength sustainable?\n\nOn Feb. 24, Cointelegraph reported that major companies are helping to drive demand for crypto education.\n\nIn recent years, several blue-chip firms including Oracle, Amazon, and Google, have actively hired those with crypto and blockchain knowledge to help develop blockchain products.\n\nIt was also noted that there is an increase in interest from information systems students to learn about decentralized applications.\n\nIn more recent news, France has now opened the Institute of Crypto-Assets. The institute will support and conduct research related to blockchain technology and crypto.\n\nMagazine: Ethereum restaking: Blockchain innovation or dangerous house of cards?"

        "content": "The quest to quantify blockchain decentralization has led to various metrics, with the Nakamoto Coefficient being one of the prominent measures. However, in the recent listings of blockchains by their degree of decentralization, Cardano was notably absent from the top ranks, a position that has sparked curiosity and debate within the crypto community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardano is often distinguished from Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based chains due to its unique network structure and operational mechanics. Unlike Ethereum, which runs on the EVM, allowing for interoperability and similar structures across various networks, Cardano employs a different approach with its Ouroboros consensus algorithm.\n\nOuroboros is a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol, but it diverges from the standard PoS mechanisms. It is designed to achieve consensus in a more energy-efficient and scalable way. This dedication to a scientific philosophy in its protocol development sets Cardano apart, which may contribute to why it is often considered separately from other EVM-compatible chains.\n\nThe distinctiveness of Cardano's architecture is complemented by its layered structure. The settlement layer (Cardano SL) and the computation layer (Cardano CL) operate independently, which differentiates its operational functions from those of other blockchains where these layers are typically intertwined.\n\nCardano's network also emphasizes a community-driven approach to governance and development. The project's catalyst funds and the Voltaire phase, which aims to introduce a fully decentralized decision-making process, are testaments to its commitment to a high degree of decentralization, albeit not necessarily captured by the Nakamoto Coefficient.\n\nFurthermore, Cardano's method of staking and block production involves a randomized process for electing slot leaders, which is different from Ethereum's process. This adds another layer of complexity when comparing the two networks based on the number of entities that can collectively shut down or control the network, as the Nakamoto Coefficient attempts to measure."

Economic conditions and investor sentiment also play a crucial role. Ethereum vs. Bitcoin Market Cap: ETH\u2019s possibility of surpassing Bitcoin in market capitalization is uncertain, dependent on factors like adoption rates and network upgrades. Bitcoin currently leads with a significantly higher market cap.\n\n\u2018There is Potential for Ethereum\u2019\n\nEthereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency \u2013 Ether (ETH) \u2013 is yet another digital asset that has experienced a rapid price increase since the beginning of 2023. It currently trades at around $2,100 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data), with some wondering whether a new all-time high (ATH) could be achieved next year.\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, such a development could indeed occur should several vital factors be in place. The AI-powered language model noted market trends and technological advancements as the main ones.\n\nIt outlined Ethereum\u2019s shift from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS), suggesting other improvements of this type could be bullish for the asset.\n\nChatGPT estimated that positive regulatory developments might encourage institutional investments and thus trigger a rally. On the other hand, stricter rules could have the opposite effect.\n\nGlobal economic conditions, investor sentiment, adoption by mainstream finance, and historical performance are other elements worth observing.\n\nLastly, ChatGPT suggested that the potential rise of different blockchain protocols and cryptocurrencies could impact Ethereum, too.\n\n\u201cGiven these factors, while there is potential for Ethereum to reach new highs, it\u2019s important to approach such predictions with caution and consider the inherent risks and uncertainties of cryptocurrency investments,\u201d the AI language model concluded.\n\nCould ETH Flip BTC: Flippening Possible?\n\nAnother interesting question that has been circulating in the cryptocurrency space for quite some time is whether Ethereum could eventually outpace Bitcoin and become the largest digital asset by market capitalization. On that note, several months ago, we asked ChatGPT if such a scenario is plausible in the next five years.\n\nThe language model explained that this outcome is \u201cuncertain and depends on various factors.\u201d The primary ones are adoption rates and network upgrades. Overall economic condition, inflation, and other financial aspects are also worth considering, ChatGPT assumed.\n\nAs of the moment, Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization stands at over $750 billion, representing a dominance of around 50%. Ethereum is second with a market cap of approximately $250 billion, meaning it has a long way to go before flippening the leader."

Instead of everyone seeing a transaction, it\u2019s more exclusive as only a select few get to know about it.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that more and more transactions are choosing this exclusive route, and it\u2019s changing the crypto landscape.\n\nApproximately 50% of these transactions, which exclude any deceptive activities such as trading bots, are currently being routed through these private mempools.\n\nToday, ~15% of Ethereum Txs are landed thru Private Mempools. Cross-checking txs seen by public mempools, we are able to observe the trend of Ethereum txs moving towards private channels over time \u2013 thru metrics across the Tx Settlement Stack on Ethereum. \ud83d\udc40 \ud83e\uddf5\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/cQOqunKVMm \u2014 danning.eth\u26a1\ufe0f\ud83e\udd16 (@sui414) November 30, 2023\n\nNow, what does this mean for Ethereum? It\u2019s a bit like a double-edged sword.\n\nOn the positive side, it could mean smoother and more private transactions for regular users. Moreover, all these transactions are protected against sandwiches and front-running in general.\n\nBut, on the flip side, if more transactions go through these private channels, it might make things a bit trickier for keeping an eye on the overall Ethereum network.\n\nSo, while it gives users a more exclusive experience, Ethereum might need to figure out how to balance the secrecy with keeping an eye on the entire network to ensure everything runs smoothly.\n\nHow is ETH doing?\n\nOnly time will tell how ETH will be impacted by this. At press time, ETH was trading at $2,092.58 and had grown by 2.87% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe number of ETH holders also increased during this period. Overall, whale interest in ETH also surged.\n\nThis could help the price move towards green. However, a large concentration of whale holders may make the crypto more centralized.\n\nMoreover, the MVRV ratio for ETH also grew. This implied that ETH holders were largely profitable.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nThis development could affect ETH negatively going forward.\n\nWith more profitable holders, the incentive for them to sell their holdings rises. This could add increased selling pressure on ETH and could result in a correction going forward."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has recently displayed remarkable bullish behavior as the price broke through a critical resistance level. The latest charts illustrate an ascending trajectory that has left many investors and analysts contemplating the possibility of the ETH/USD chart reaching the coveted $3,000 mark in the near future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExamining the daily chart for Ethereum, we see a series of higher lows and higher highs, which is the go-to indication of a bull market. The price has now surpassed the dynamic resistance provided by the 50-day and 100-day moving averages.\n\nETH/USD chart by TradingView\n\nHowever, despite the recent uptick, the volume behind the movement is descending, suggesting a lack of strong momentum. This pattern often precedes a consolidation phase, where the price stabilizes before making a definitive move. Investors should watch for a possible consolidation, which could confirm the sustainability of the recent breakout.\n\nAdding to the market dynamics, the rise of Layer 2 solutions (L2s) has been gradually increasing Ethereum network fees. While L2s are designed to enhance scalability and reduce costs on the Ethereum network, the transition period could lead to a slow but steady climb in fees. This rise could potentially lead to a stalemate situation in network activity if users begin to balk at higher costs, influencing the ETH price as the network's utility comes under scrutiny.\n\nOn the technical front, the relative strength index (RSI) is approaching overbought territory, yet another sign that the market could be due for a pause. A retraction or sideways movement would allow the RSI to reset, providing a healthier foundation for future growth.\n\nThe confluence of these technical indicators and the fundamental backdrop of rising network fees due to the adoption of L2s presents a complex picture for Ethereum. While the current price action looks promising for a test of $3,000, the underlying volume and network fee trends suggest that a period of consolidation or even a minor pullback might be on the horizon before any further significant upward movements are observed."

        "title": "Celestia falls back on Ethereum for data security as TIA jumps - AMBCrypto English",
        "content": "The project integrated OP Stack and Arbitrum Nitro to help with data security.\n\nTIA reached a new ATH and its volume increased.\n\nModular consensus and data network Celestia [TIA] has introduced an L2 system called the \u201cEthereum fallback.\u201d Celestia described the Ethereum [ETH] fallback mechanism as one that backs up data availability if there is any downtime on the Celestia mainnet.\n\n2FA for the Celestia camp\n\nAccording to the project, two L2s are involved in the development\u2014 Arbitrum [ARB] and Optimism [OP]. Celestia revealed that its choice of Optimism\u2019s OP Stack was because the blockchain can back up rollup blocks and posts to Ethereum.\n\nIn the case of Arbitrum Nitro, Celestia wants it to engage its advanced calldata compression. This is to ensure that it stores on-chain data if primary data availability fails. Regarding both concepts, Celestia noted that:\n\n\u201cThese two functions work together to ensure that the Ethereum fallback mechanism operates correctly, allowing the rollup to continue functioning even during periods of downtime on Celestia.\u201d\n\nAs a result of this disclosure, AMBCrypto proceeded to assess Celestia\u2019s development activity. At press, the development activity was down to 1.06. This metric tracks the work done in a project\u2019s public GitHub repository.\n\nSo, the decrease means that there has been a lot of activity related to polishing the network.\n\nAs for the TIA price, it reached a new All-Time High (ATH) of $7.35. In a previous article, AMBCrypto discussed TIA as one of the new projects maintaining a good price action.\n\nTIA\u2019s uptrend resumes\n\nBut of late, the token was at the mercy of a 30% slump. As of this writing, the TIA/USD H4 chart has reclaimed its bullish market structure. However, it seems that the uptick was starting to get overheated.\n\nIf so, the price action might retrace from the northward direction. One of the reasons for this assumption is the Relative Strength Index (RSI). At press time, the RSI was 71.75 which is considered overbought.\n\nLike the RSI, the Bollinger Bands (BB) also reinforced the notion that TIA was overbought. This was because the upper band of the BB touched TIA at $7.30. If the lower band had hit the price, TIA would have been tagged oversold.\n\nTherefore, there is a chance for TIA to drop. Also, if the 26-day EMA (orange) becomes at par with the 12-day EMA (blue), the token value may retrace. However, there seems to be support around $6.32. Should the price reverse, it might not go below $6.50 in the short term.\n\nTwo other metrics to look at when analyzing Celestia are social dominance and volume.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s TIA\u2019s market cap in ETH terms\n\nAt the time of writing, TIA\u2019s volume was 188.40 million\u2014 a slight decrease from the 221.80 million peak. This means that there have been many TIA tokens exchanging hands lately.\n\nSo, it was not surprising that the social dominance rose to 1.878%, indicating an increase in discussion around the project."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nTraders and analysts are discussing the roots of the \"New Solana Summer\" as all core metrics of on-chain activity are rocketing. Some of them have already reached pre-FTX collapse levels. NFTs and meme coin segments might be contributing to this upsurge, data says.\n\nSolana (SOL) exceeds Polygon (MATIC), Optimism (OP) by transactional volume\n\nIn early December 2023, the aggregated on-chain trading volume on the Solana (SOL) blockchain surged above $240 million per day in equivalent. As such, the blockchain managed to surpass both Polygon (MATIC) and Optimism (OP), two mainstream Ethereum-based L2s by this indicator.\n\nImage by DefiLlama\n\nIn the first days of December, Polygon (MATIC) and Optimism (OP) demonstrate trading volumes of $137 million and $40 million per day, respectively. As such, Solana (SOL) processes more money on-chain than they do combined.\n\nAlso, in the last 24 hours, Solana (SOL) exceeded its another rival Avalanche (AVAX) by net value locked in dApps. Solana's dApp ecosystem is responsible for $688 million in TVL, Avalanche (AVAX) dApps logged $660 million. At that pace, Solana (SOL) might surpass the TVLs of Polygon (MATIC) and Optimism (OP) in the coming days.\n\nIn the last month, Solana's (SOL) TVL added over 60%, while the SOL price soared by 45%.\n\nHowever, it is still lagging behind Arbitrum (ARB), a dominant Ethereum (ETH) L2. Arbitrum (ARB) amassed almost $2.2 billion in TVL, while its daily trading volume exceeds $363 million in equivalent.\n\nSolScriptions and meme coins triggered Solana (SOL) comeback\n\nThe rally of Solana (SOL) and its network indicators can be attributed to a combination of powerful catalysts. For instance, the interest in Solana-based Ordinals \"SolScriptions\" and meme coins triggered the growth of SPL tokens minted on-chain.\n\nThen, Solana-based liquid staking protocols like Jito and Marinade Finance are actively attracting new customers and liquidity. Decentralized exchanges like Raydium and Orca are also gaining traction.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, CoinEx Research indicated the DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) sector as yet another powerful catalyst for Solana (SOL) ecosystem's rebound."

        "content": "There has been a hike in NFT and DeFi activity on Ethereum.\n\nDespite the high demand for ETH, its supply continues to fall.\n\nThe Ethereum [ETH] network has experienced a surge in activity around non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) in recent weeks, on-chain data reveals.\n\nThis growth in network activity follows an extended period of decline when NFT sales volume and DeFi total value locked (TVL) plummeted to new lows.\n\nEthereum\u2019s NFT and DeFi ecosystems\n\nIn November, Ethereum-minted NFTs recorded a sales volume of $348.61 million, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nAMBCrypto found that this marked the first time since February that the chain would record a month-over-month (MoM) uptick in sales volume.\n\nFor context, Ethereum registered an NFT sales volume of $949.49 million in February. However, as bearish sentiments ravaged the entire crypto market in the first and second quarters of the year, NFT trading activity declined severely.\n\nData from NFTGo showed that general NFT market capitalization peaked at $10 billion on 20th February and has since trended downward.\n\nBetween February and October, NFT sales volume on Ethereum fell by 82%. However, general market sentiments improved in November, leading to a resurgence in NFT trading activity.\n\nLast month, general NFT market capitalization grew by 39%. Mirroring the growth in the general market, Ethereum\u2019s MoM sales volume climbed by 108%.\n\nRegarding its DeFi vertical, it also experienced growth in TVL. Data from DefiLlama showed that between 1st and 30th November, the chain\u2019s TVL rose by 15%.\n\nThe network\u2019s TVL was $26.64 billion at press time, its highest since July.\n\nBut there is a catch\u2026\n\nWhile the growth in NFT and DeFi activity is good for the chain, it might result in a potential hike in ETH\u2019s supply due to the current increased demand for the altcoin.\n\nPseudonymous CryptoQuant analyst Nino found that the resurgence in NFT and DeFi activity on the Ethereum network has led to growth in the standard deviation (SD) of ETH withdrawal transactions from exchanges.\n\nThis means that ETH\u2019s average withdrawal transaction size is becoming more variable. In other words, there are more large and small withdrawal transactions than there used to be.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nTaking a cue from ETH\u2019s historical performance, Nino said:\n\n\u201cLike during past bubble periods, if there\u2019s a surge in demand for DeFi and NFTs, it would necessitate an increased supply of ETH. This could lead to higher volatility in its price.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, despite last month\u2019s NFT and DeFi activity hike, its supply continues to decline. Data from Ultrasound.money showed that 32,012 ETH tokens worth around $66.95 million have been removed from circulation in the last month."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum's price today is showcasing a bullish surge that is drawing attention across the crypto community. Ethereum is a bellwether for the altcoin market, and today's price action suggests that investors are increasingly confident in the asset's value proposition.\n\nThe technical chart for Ethereum indicates a strong push toward a key resistance level. After a period of consolidation, the price has broken out, suggesting a potential shift from a bearish to a bullish trend at around $2,100. This move aligns with a broader market recovery.\n\nAnalyzing the chart, Ethereum has been tracing an ascending trajectory, supported by a rising trendline that underscores a series of higher lows \u2013 a classic indicator of bullish sentiment. The 50-day moving average, which is often looked upon for trend confirmation, is positioned below the current price, serving as a dynamic support level. The price is pushing toward the $2,100 level, which has historically acted as a significant resistance zone.\n\nA breakthrough above this resistance could signal the start of a new uptrend, potentially challenging previous highs. However, traders will be watching closely for sustained volume to accompany this price increase, as higher trade volumes would lend credence to the breakout and suggest stronger conviction among buyers.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum indicator, is currently hovering in the upper neutral zone, nearing overbought territory. While this could indicate that a pause or pullback is due, it also reflects the strong buying pressure that has driven the recent price increase.\n\nDogecoin not joking\n\nAt the time of writing, Dogecoin's price hovers around $0.38, which has established itself as a significant resistance point. This level has been tested multiple times over recent weeks, with each attempt bringing increased selling pressure. However, the persistence of DOGE bulls is noteworthy, as they continue to push the price back up to this threshold, indicating a potential accumulation phase preceding a breakout.\n\nThe technical indicators on the chart reinforce this narrative. The moving averages are aligned in a bullish formation, with the 50-day moving average serving as dynamic support below the current price. This could embolden the bulls, offering a psychological boost as they rally to break past the current resistance.\n\nFurthermore, the formation of a small symmetrical triangle suggests that volatility may be on the horizon for Dogecoin. This pattern, characterized by converging trend lines, points to a period of consolidation that typically precedes significant price movement. Given the positioning of the price at the upper end of the triangle, there is an argument to be made for an impending bullish breakout.\n\nExamining the volume, we see a consistency that accompanies the consolidation pattern, hinting that a breakout could be accompanied by a substantial increase in trade volume. This would provide the necessary market confirmation for a genuine breakthrough, rather than a false breakout that could trap overzealous bulls.\n\nADA's consolidation continues\n\nThe Cardano (ADA) market has entered a phase of consolidation, marked by a confluence of technical indicators that suggest brewing momentum. With the price oscillating around $0.38, the question on many investors' minds is whether this is the quiet before the storm of a significant breakout.\n\nA close examination of the daily chart reveals diverging moving averages, with the 50-day moving average trending upward, suggesting a bullish undercurrent, while the 200-day moving average is moving lower, indicating potential longer-term bearish sentiment. This divergence can often signal a period of market indecision, with shorter-term bullish sentiment wrestling against longer-term caution.\n\nThe immediate resistance level for ADA sits at around $0.40, a threshold that has capped upward price movements in recent times. For a confirmed breakout, ADA bulls need to push and sustain the price above this level, ideally with an increase in volume to signify strong market conviction."

        "content": "One of the founding minds behind Solana Labs has expressed his disagreement with the phrase labeling the Solana network as an \u201cEthereum killer.\u201d\n\nIn a Dec. 2 post on X, Anatoly Yakovenko said he doesn\u2019t envision a scenario where Solana (SOL) flourishes at the expense of Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) demise.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/aeyakovenko/status/1731025584271274244?s=20\n\nSince its official introduction in 2020, Solana\u2019s inherent attributes have led many to hail it as an Ethereum killer, a moniker also attributed to renowned blockchains like Cardano (ADA), Tezos (XTZ), Avalanche (AVAX), and Polygon (MATIC).\n\nYakovenko, however, labels the term \u201cEthereum killer\u201d as \u201clame\u201d, arguing that despite the similarities between Solana and Ethereum, the latter won\u2019t be eclipsed by the former.\n\nYakovenko expressed concern over the growing tension, which he likened to a \u201ccold war,\u201d between Ethereum and other blockchain protocols, including Solana. He argued that such hostile narratives hinder the overall growth of the shared digital ecosystem.\n\nThe Solana co-founder views the connection between his blockchain and Ethereum as a path to shared growth and advancement.\n\nYou might also like: Solana reaches 18-month highs amid dominating short positions\n\nAlthough blockchain technologies like SOL and ETH, with their similar features, may appear to be in direct competition, Yakovenko insists that one\u2019s success does not necessitate the other\u2019s failure. He reinforced his stance with the concept of Pareto efficiency, explaining that technologies can share features and compete without causing harm.\n\nHe also spoke enthusiastically about the advancements in blockchain technology, notably danksharding, an Ethereum scaling solution aimed at increasing transactional capacity by providing more storage for roll-up transactions.\n\nHe sees a future where such technology could accommodate all of Solana\u2019s data, further reinforcing his belief in technological coexistence.\n\nAt one point, the Solana network, developed to provide smart contract functionalities akin to the Ethereum network, outperformed the Ethereum mainnet in terms of speed and power efficiency, courtesy of its proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus system.\n\nAt that time, Ethereum utilized the more power-hungry proof-of-work (PoW) consensus method and could only process approximately 30 transactions per second, a fraction of Solana\u2019s more impressive 50,000 to 65,000 transactions per second.\n\nRead more: Vitalik Buterin NFT collection triggers surge in Ethereum gas fees\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "For the major period of November, the Ethereum (ETH) coin witnessed high volatility leading to a sideways trend between the $2,143 and $1,910 price levels. However, this consolidation came after a significant rally indicating the buyers could have an opportunity to recuperate the bullish momentum after the further rally. Thus, a recent breakout from the range barrier sets the ETH price to further rally.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin & Ethereum Options Data Indicates Roadblock Ahead\n\nadvertisement\n\nWill ETH Price Hit $3000?\n\nA bullish breakout from the wedge pattern would set a directional uptrend\n\nThe rising price could face intense supply around $2250.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $10.2 Billion, indicating a 78% gain.\n\nCoinciding with the Bitcoin price ascent over the $38,000 mark, a renewed sense of optimism has begun to permeate the crypto market. Responding to this positive shift, the ETH price rebounded from the psychologically significant $2,000 mark, registering a 7.8% weekly increase to its current trading price of $2,153.\n\nDuring this rally, the Ethereum price surpassed the immediate resistance of $2,133, suggesting that buyers are poised to drive the price even higher. Despite a modest intraday loss of 0.5%, a retest of this breached resistance could confirm its role as a new support level, underpinning the buyer\u2019s ability to sustain higher price levels.\n\nHowever, with only a 3.5% increase, the ETH price is approaching a significant resistance level formed by the wedge pattern. Historical trends indicate that this trendline has often led to increased selling pressure and notable price declines.\n\nTherefore, a conclusive breakout above this barrier is crucial for confirming a more robust uptrend. Should the Ethereum price successfully navigate this challenge, its price could potentially soar by 50%, reaching around $3,400.\n\nBTC vs ETH Performance\n\nLong-term comparative analysis between Bitcoin and Ethereum reveals that both cryptocurrencies gained considerable momentum since mid-October. However, the Bitcoin price has demonstrated a more substantial recovery, characterized by a consistent pattern of higher highs and lows. On the other hand, the ETH price has faced some challenges, particularly noticeable supply pressure around the $2,200 mark.\n\nBollinger band: The uptick in the Bollinger band indicator reflects that buyers are aggressive and ready to buy ETH at a higher price.\n\nMoving Average Convergence Divergence: a bullish crossover between the MACD (blue) and signal(orange) line, accentuates a recovery sentiment return in this asset."

        "content": "Ethereum layer-2 networks achieved a significant milestone in November 2023 surpassing a total value locked (TVL) of almost $15 billion within their contracts, as reported by blockchain analytics platform, L2Beat.\n\nThe list of Ethereum layer-2 networks includes:\n\nArbitrum One\n\nOptimism, Base\n\nPolygon zkEVM\n\nMetis\n\nand various others.\n\nBefore June 15 2023, the total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum layer-2 networks was less than $10 billion, and the combined TVL had been decreasing since reaching a peak of $11.8 billion in April 2023.\n\nStarting from June 15 2023, there has been a positive growth in the total value locked (TVL) on Ethereum layer-2 networks. By October 31 2023, these networks had reached a new high of nearly $12 billion in combined TVL. The trend continued, surpassing the $13 billion TVL mark on November 10 2023 and reaching nearly $14.8 billion at the time of the latest data.\n\nThe number of such networks continues to increase as well as providing different options and advantages to users. The latest is Mara, the Africa-focused crypto startup, which is set to also launch its highly anticipated Ethereum layer 2 chain, Mara Chain.\n\nAccording to Metis decentralization coordinator, Elena Sinelnikova, Ethereum\u2019s high gas fees during the bull market left an indelible impact on users, leading to a desire for alternatives when demand started to come back.\n\n\u201cAt the time of bull market, Ethereum at peak times was very nonscaleable, which meant that transactions were slow and very expensive because of the bull market. It would be hundreds of dollars just in transaction fees for one transaction, so therefore it was not sustainable.\u201d\n\nAnother factor contributing to the success of layer 2 networks during the bear market is the effective marketing efforts by their development teams. Successful marketing has led to increased user activity, attracting more participants and contributing to higher yields within layer 2 networks.\n\n\u201cThey are deploying capital to attract new users and to attract new business into DeFi,\u201d Sinelnikova stated.\n\n\u201cDeFi people from all ecosystems, they always go where there are big yields, and this is just naturally happening, and is the nature of business.\u201d\n\nHowever, while layer-2 solutions have gained popularity for their scalability enhancements over the last year, they often introduce a trade-off in decentralization, insiders contend.\n\n\u201cAt the execution layer, where transactions are processed, centralized sequencer nodes are employed, raising concerns about potential censorship or government interference. This centralized aspect in layer-2 implementations challenges the core principles of decentralization and trustlessness that have underpinned the blockchain space,\u201d said Kelsey McGuire, Chief Growth Officer for layer-1 network, Shardeum.\n\nMcGuire anticipates that competition from layer 2 solutions will drive enhancements to layer 1 protocols, resulting in improved throughput and functionality for the foundational blockchain layers.\n\nFollow us on Twitter for the latest posts and updates\n\nJoin and interact with our Telegram community\n\n__________________________________________\n\n__________________________________________"

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nAnalyst Tom Crown has expressed a bullish outlook on Litecoin (LTC), noting its potential to gain traction amid the current market developments. Crown opened up about the impact of rising transaction fees within Bitcoin (BTC) and shared an interesting analogy using a South Park reference to illustrate the transaction queue.\n\nIn an interview with The Paul Barron Network, he pointed out that Litecoin\u2019s transaction fees are currently low, making it an attractive option for users seeking efficient transactions. Crown said that Litecoin historically served as a useful bridge for transferring value between different assets, especially during times of congestion in the Bitcoin network.\n\nHowever, despite the positive sentiment, Crown acknowledged that Litecoin\u2019s price chart does not fully reflect the current market conditions. While he sees a strong macro view for Litecoin, the coin is currently struggling on the charts. Crown discussed key support levels around $76 and suggested that Litecoin might present a compelling entry point for spot or long positions.\n\nCrown expressed a level of optimism for Litecoin\u2019s potential upside, even speculating on a return to near $100 over the next few months. He acknowledged the challenges but remained hopeful about Litecoin\u2019s future performance.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Potential and the Anticipation of an ETF\n\nSwitching focus to Ethereum (ETH), Crown discussed the growing anticipation of an Ethereum ETF, following the trend set by Bitcoin.\n\nHe mentioned that the introduction of an Ethereum ETF could attract new investors and potentially lead to positive price movements. Crown analyzed Ethereum\u2019s chart, pointing out a flat top building around $2,100 and a series of higher lows, indicating potential upward momentum.\n\nRegarding price predictions, Crown suggested that if Ethereum mirrors Bitcoin\u2019s move to $48,000 to $50,000, Ethereum could reach levels around $2,700 to $3,200.\n\nHe stressed the importance of maintaining the pattern of higher lows and indicated that Ethereum\u2019s performance might outpace Bitcoin during specific market phases."

        "content": "The Buterin Cards NFT collection triggered a 13% gas fee increase on the Ethereum (ETH) network. In the past 24 hours, transactions linked to the collection resulted in fees totaling 318.31 ETH, equivalent to $665,670.\n\nButerin-themed NFTs\n\nAs of 3:00 p.m. ET on Dec. 1, transactions linked to a new non-fungible token (NFT) project known as Buterin Cards reportedly accounted for over 13% of the total Ethereum network gas fees within three hours, surpassing fees from the Uniswap universal router address and Tether\u2019s public address, according to Etherscan data.\n\nThe surge in fees was a consequence of heightened demand for processing transactions associated with the Buterin Cards NFT collection.\n\nThe Buterin Cards project seeks to release 2,015 NFTs as a tribute to Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain. Utilizing a unique NFT minting process called JPEG mining, the project distinguishes itself by storing image data on-chain, deviating from conventional NFTs that only store metadata on-chain.\n\nTo ensure the integrity of the uploaded data and prevent arbitrary uploads, the smart contract verifies data correctness by computing its hash. The project\u2019s website explains that thanks to progressive JPEG technology, the NFT image gradually unveils as it undergoes the mining process.\n\nIn exchange for their contributions, miners are rewarded with a card featuring an image of Vitalik Buterin at various quality levels, according to the project\u2019s website.\n\nYou might also like: early investors of Ethereum and Cardano considering new crypto project\n\nThe Ethereum evolution\n\nIn recent times, Ethereum has undergone significant developments, most notably the shift to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, known as Ethereum 2.0. This transition replaced the energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) model, introducing staking, where validators stake 32 Ether (~$50,000) and are randomly selected to add blocks. This change has led to a remarkable 99.9% reduction in Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption.\n\nThe broader Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, consisting of phases like the Beacon Chain, the Merge, and Shard Chains, aims to enhance scalability and security. These adjustments address Ethereum\u2019s limitations, including scalability and energy consumption.\n\nIn terms of market performance, Ethereum\u2019s price has rebounded, surpassing the $2,000 level and approaching new 52-week highs, reflecting a robust 2023 performance.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum gas fees have experienced fluctuations, reaching their lowest levels since November 2022.\n\nThe decrease in gas fees has been attributed to a reduction in on-network activity, resulting in more manageable fees for Ethereum users. Factors influencing these changes include network congestion, Ethereum upgrades, and market speculation.\n\nHowever, the primary goal has been to enhance scalability and decrease fees. Even though the immediate effects of these upgrades may not be evident, they have also contributed to the fluctuations in gas fees.\n\nRead more: Forbes forks release of 30 under 30 to Ethereum blockchain\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Bitcoin is currently edging toward $40K, leading many altcoins to yield impressive gains and even outperform the market leader.\n\nTwo of those are Ethereum and Solana, up 2.98% and 2.71%, respectively.\n\nETH Hits Yearly High While SOL Nears Resistance\n\nEthereum is priced at $2,167 and has just created a new local high as its uptrend continues. The move has generated significant excitement, causing its trading volume to spike 27% in the last day.\n\nCrypto analyst Wolf recently said, \u201c$ETH is consolidating above an 18-month ascending triangle weekly resistance.\u201d\n\nThe analyst speculates that this will be followed by a decisive breakout, stating, \u201cThe clock is ticking for the bears.\u201d\n\nX commentator Neil is also significantly bullish, recently warning against shorting Ethereum at its current level.\n\nThe trader tweeted, \u201cPeople asking me for entries to short $ETH and altcoins here,\u201d he continued, \u201cYou\u2019re telling me, $ETH just closed its highest 4hr candle over a 2 year long resistance, and you want to short?\u201d\n\nEvidently, Ethereum\u2019s recent breakout is driving tremendous optimism among analysts.\n\nBesides its bullish price chart, another factor potentially influencing Ethereum\u2019s market sentiment is that ETH has turned deflationary again.\n\nA recent tweet by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode highlighted that the growth rate of Ethereum\u2019s validator set has slowed down, reducing the ETH emissions alongside it.\n\nConsequently, the network\u2019s burn mechanism is outpacing emissions, rendering ETH deflationary.\n\nMeanwhile, the market is also optimistic about Solana as it approaches its resistance after a meteoric rise in the past months.\n\nCrypto analytics company Cryptonary recently published a Solana trading theory, suggesting that \u201cSOL shorts are at risk.\u201d\n\nThe deep-dive tweet notes that open interest is up, but funding is down. Cryptonary proposes that this translates to strong shorting activity and increases the chances of a short squeeze.\n\nA short squeeze is a forced liquidation of short (or sell) positions as the asset\u2019s price rises, causing it to go even higher.\n\nThe tweet says that if Solana breaks $61, it could ignite a short squeeze, pushing it to potential highs of $80.\n\nSolana\u2019s price has risen since the analysis, currently at $63.54. This puts it in an advantageous position to pump based on Cryptonary\u2019s accord.\n\nAnother crypto that analysts are bullish on is Bitcoin Minetrix. It is currently undergoing a presale, meaning investors can still get in at a discounted price before it launches on exchanges.\n\nRevolutionary Bitcoin Minetrix Token Also Looks Bullish as ICO Nears $5M\n\nBitcoin Minetrix is a compelling new cryptocurrency that enables anyone to earn free Bitcoin by staking $BTCMTX on its Ethereum-based platform.\n\nIt works by users staking $BTCMTX for mining credits, which they can burn on the platform for cloud mining power.\n\nThe project simplifies Bitcoin mining through its decentralized and secure cloud mining solution. It is beginner-friendly and much easier and faster to get started than traditional Bitcoin mining.\n\nAs such, its presale has enjoyed significant success, raising over $4.6 million in just two months.\n\nTop analysts are rallying behind the project\u2019s novel use case. No Bs Crypto recently speculated that it could produce over 100x gains after it launches on exchanges.\n\nMeanwhile, Michael Wrubel explained why he is bullish to his 310K YouTube subscribers.\n\nOne of the project\u2019s main advantages is that the $BTCMTX token holds significant utility since users require it for staking, which will translate to high demand potential.\n\nFurthermore, its supply-side tokenomics are also promising, with most tokens being locked for staking and rewards paid out in mining credits, not $BTCMTX.\n\nThis creates optimal supply and demand dynamics, leading to significant price appreciation potential.\n\nInvestors can buy the Bitcoin Minetrix presale for $0.012, but they must hurry because its price will rise in three days.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is infamously known for its volatility, which can lead to major price shifts within a short period. In August, Bitcoin lost more than 10% of its value within the span of a few days, a clear nightmare for investors.\n\nDespite optimism among investors with hopes that Bitcoin will rise up and gain lost ground, the cryptocurrency experienced yet another decline, with the price dropping as low as $36,770 from its initial opening price of $37,250. Threading the same path, Ethereum also witnessed a decline in value, hitting a 24-hour low of 2,002 from its opening price of $2,050.\n\nHowever, there is a contrasting reality for Meme Moguls as analysts project a bullish momentum. While the reasons are not far-fetched, the following analysis sheds more light on why Bitcoin and Ethereum are taking a dive in the crypto market whereas investors are eagerly embracing Meme Moguls.\n\n>>Buy Meme Moguls<<\n\nBitcoin Takes a Dip Amidst Investor Optimism\n\nBitcoin recorded losses as it dipped by 0.69% as of the time of writing, signaling a further decline from its recent peak of $38,200. The largest and most popular cryptocurrency by market cap is now trading under $38,000, with a 24-hour trading volume of $19.7B according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe recent price action in Bitcoin in the last 24 hours also left the token market capitalization at $743,960,549,311, resulting in a change of 2.20%.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not surprising to witness this retraction in the price of Bitcoin, considering the cryptocurrency has enjoyed a smooth run for some time in the month of November. For more context, the cryptocurrency started the month at the price of $34,397 and achieved a recent new high slightly above $38,000, accounting for roughly 11% increase in less than three weeks.\n\nWhile experts remain bullish about Bitcoin, price prediction by Changelly forecasts a 3.23% increase from the current market price, portraying a potential value of $38,666 by November 28, 2023. But that remains to be seen. Investors are hopeful that bitcoin price will pick up as several factors continue to support gains for Bitcoin including optimism that U.S. regulators will soon approve the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in early 2024.\n\nEthereum Witnesses a Downside of 0.73%\n\nAs reported by CoinMarketCap, Ethereum has had its fair share in price drop at the time of writing declining by about 0.73%. The second largest cryptocurrency is currently trading slightly below $2,060, with a potential to swing back upward.\n\nIn comparison, the price of Ethereum was valued at $2,070 a day ago, further suggesting that despite the dip, there\u2019s been some slight bullish activity.\n\nGoing by recent claims by the CoinDCX research team while speaking with Republic World, Ethereum overcoming the resistance at $2,130 is important for a bullish scenario. If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,080 resistance, it just might lead to a fresh decline.\n\nInvestors More Excited to Jump on Meme Moguls (MGLS)\n\nAway from Ethereum and Bitcoin, Meme Moguls is another cryptocurrency gearing up to experience a tremendous jump in value. It is an innovative DeFi earning platform that lets users enjoy an absorbing fantasy gaming experience.\n\nWith Meme Moguls (MGLS), participants can create custom avatars using their most loved memes and build their fortune through their meme portfolio. They can also trade or sell character NFTs on the marketplace along with other rare NFT items and mined materials representing real-world assets. Meme Moguls is then the first world\u2019s meme-based assets exchange.\n\n\ud83d\udd25Hot dang Meme Moguls!\ud83d\udd25 Here\u2019s a sweet TUTORIAL on how to BUY $MGLS in under 2 minutes! \u23f1\ufe0f WATCH NOW \u2b07\ufe0f It\u2019s SO easy even this dancing banana can do it! \ud83c\udf4c\ud83d\udc83 Just follow along!

        "content": "Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko made a post on the X app warning the public about sparking a cold war between Ethereum (ETH) and other protocols including Solana (SOL) which are generally referred to as \u2018ETH Killer\u201d\n\nSOL and ETH Can Co-Exist\n\nIn Yakovenko\u2019s opinion, pushing such narratives against Ethereum is lame as it harms the ecosystem. He suggested that protocols could coexist without challenges or threats of killing each other.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cPareto efficient technologies can have overlapping features and will compete, but that\u2019s all ok. I don\u2019t see a future where solana thrives and somehow eth dies,\u201d the Solana co-founder said.\n\nFurthermore, Anatoly expressed positivity in a future where \u201cDanksharding,\u201d a technology that allows blockchain technology to add cheaper blocks, will have enough bandwidth that accommodate all of Solana\u2019s data. To put it in perspective, danksharding is an Ethereum rollup scaling method where transactional throughput is expanded through the provision of additional storage space for roll-up transactions.\n\nYakovenko\u2019s statement on Ethereum underscores the fact that SOL and ETH can coexist and even overlap without any inconveniences.\n\nSolana Founder Douses ETH Rivalry Push\n\nDespite the growing industry eulogy for Solana, Yakovenko has warned the community members against instigating unhealthy rivalry with the Ethereum protocol.\n\nThis was when MakerDAO Co-founder and CEO Rune Christensen announced plans to fork the protocol\u2019s NewChain on the Solana blockchain, away from Ethereum. The news sparked some reactions from Solana proponents who saw the transition as a battle of the best.\n\nYakovenko immediately pointed out that it was a general win for open source. \u201cI really hope that people in the Solana community don\u2019t use this as some cudgel to attack Ethereum,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nIn October, one Ethereum community member identified as jebus.eth tried to take a jab at Solana by referring to it as a \u201cCoallition of poors and wealthy ppl who don\u2019t understand where value actually comes from or how to create it, just that the things I want should be cheap.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Solana co-founder was quick to respond to him, emphasizing the fact that his protocol is a pursuit of an entirely stateless digital realm, where unhindered communication and transactions flow freely among the people, liberated from the control of capitalist middlemen and government surveillance."

I am such a techno optimist that I am certain that\u2026 \u2014 toly (@aeyakovenko) December 2, 2023\n\nThe outburst comes after Rune Christensen, MakerDAO co-founder and CEO revealed plans to remove the protocol\u2019s NewChain from Ethereum and fork it on the Solana blockchain. While his intentions may have been harmless, the community received it as a battle of the best between Solana and Ethereum. To Yakovenko, however, this battle can only be detrimental to the ecosystem.\n\nDiscrediting the perception that \u201cSolana thrives and somehow Ethereum dies,\u201d Yakovenko demonstrates optimism in Danksharding being able to have adequate bandwidth to contain the entire expanse of Solana data.\n\nNotably, Danksharding is a technology that enables blockchain technology to add cheaper blocks. It is an Ethereum rollup scaling method that expands transactional throughput by increasing storage space for roll-up transactions.\n\nNot the first time\n\nThis is not the first time Yakovenko is attempting to quell the Solana versus Ethereum feud. In an October citing, jebus.eth, an Ethereum community member took shots at Solana, likening it to the Democrat Party of crypto. He called it a \u201cCoalition of poors and wealthy people,\u201d who lack an understanding of value and its source, adding that it was a group of people who prioritized cheap over value.\n\nSol is like the dem party of crypto\n\n\n\nCoallition of poors and wealthy ppl who don't understand where value actually comes from or how to create it, just that the things I want should be cheap \u2014 Jebus.eth (@jebus911) October 1, 2023\n\nIn response, Yakovenko defended, \u201cIn the grand theatre of economic transformation, Ethereum presents itself not as a harbinger of genuine revolution, but merely as a novel spectacle of bourgeois upheaval.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Solana price remains committed to the north, boasting a 2% surge on the day, accompanied by an 11% climb in trading volume. The parity between price and trading volume points to strong interest in the asset by buyers. It also points to higher liquidity, better order execution, and a more active market for connecting a buyer and seller.\n\nAt the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading for $63.58, with eyes peeled on the $70.00 mark amid rising momentum and the presence of bulls in the SOL market. This is indicated by the northbound RSI and the green histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator (AO) in the positive territory."

        "content": "TLDR\n\nEddy Zillan\u2019s crypto investments reached over $500,000 in 2017 after committing $12,000 in 2012; he now has sights on Rebel Satoshi .\n\nRebel Satoshi is set to fuel a rebellious movement with a meme coin\n\nTeen investor Eddy Zillan hit it big with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) during 2017\u2019s bull market. Now 24, the youngster has found another top crypto to invest in with Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ).\n\nThis is a new rebel-inspired meme coin sensation modeled after Bitcoin\u2019s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. While the sentiment for Bitcoin and Ethereum is bullish, Rebel Satoshi may provide more substantial returns.\n\nEddy Zillan: From $12,000 to Over Half A Million Dollars In Five Years\n\nFor their bar mitzvah at 13 in 2012, Zillan\u2019s parents blessed him with $5,000 for an investment fund. While his folks expected the teenager to dabble in traditional markets like stocks, he took an alternative, obscure approach. Zillan started to buy top crypto coins, most notably Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nHe saved up an extra $7,000 through tennis club and other jobs. Thus, their total investment was $12,000. Through the years, the value of his holdings kept soaring and soaring. In November 2017, Zillan held over $500,000 in value, with a return surpassing 4,100%. Understandably, Zillan was featured in many media publications from late 2017 to 2018 following his success.\n\nEddy is still bullish on Bitcoin and Ethereum, particularly with the institutional interest both projects are receiving. Furthermore, predictions align with this sentiment. Bitcoin will likely be worth $40,000-$45,000 (or higher) in 2024. Meanwhile, Ethereum is expected to hit a minimum yearly peak of $3,000.\n\nStill, Zillan has eyes on Rebel Satoshi, rooted in decentralization and explosive potential.\n\nRebel Satoshi Introduces Rebellious Energies In Meme Coins\n\nRebel Satoshi is an eccentric meme coin pushing for rebellion and defiance against the status quo. It\u2019s inspired by Satoshi Nakamoto, who ushered in the digital revolution with Bitcoin, resulting in a flood of the best DeFi coins like Ethereum.\n\nThe 16th-century Guy Fawkes is another motivation, a symbol of social justice and freedom fighting. Both the spirits of Nakamoto and Fawkes resonate with Rebel Satoshi in their quest for decentralization. The prime long-term goal is to exceed $100 million in market cap, showing what a small yet like-minded community can achieve without a centralized financial system.\n\nIt provides an attractive ecosystem, which will be key to attaining this goal. The first part is the Rebel Artefacts Vault, a treasure chest of 9,999 unique collectibles and digital art in NFT form. The Revolutionary Staking Hub will also fuel much-needed buzzing trading activity. Here, users will stake the $RBLZ token, earning brilliant passive income while fortifying the network\u2019s security.\n\nThe Early Bird Round of Rebel Satoshi\u2018s presale was an exhilarating three weeks. It began on Bonfire Night (November 05, 2023) to honor Guy Fawkes. $RBLZ\u2018s value increased 30% from $0.010 to $0.013 in the current Rebel Rounds 1, indicating sheer demand.\n\nCurrent buyers can grab more tokens with a time-limited 15% bonus. The presale end comes with several exciting events. Firstly, the platform will \u2018burn\u2018 any unsold tokens, another symbolic nod to Fawkes. Moreover, the first NFT collection will be released. Finally, buyers can expect a 92% gain in their holdings as $RBLZ will be worth $0.025.\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Solana\u2019s creation was designed to work with all the functionalities of Ethereum and improve upon the issues that arose in the network\u2019s early days. The blockchain has since grown in popularity in the past few years, with many crypto participants touting Solana as the one to dethrone Ethereum in the altcoin market. However, it seems Solana\u2019s co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko is tired of the comparison, and just wants a situation where the network can thrive.\n\nAnatoly Yakovenko\u2019s Thoughts On The \u2018Ethereum Killer\u2019 Label\n\nSolana has done well since the October bottom which led to market gains in the wider crypto market. The crypto\u2019s price has done 197% gains since the middle of October and is up by 531% from its 2023 open of around $9.96. At the same time, Solana\u2019s TVL in DeFi has also grown spectacularly, adding 74.67% in the past month and $482 million since the beginning of 2023.\n\nFurthermore, according to the data provided by DeFiLlama, the daily trade volume of Solana\u2019s DeFi has been surpassing that of Ethereum L2 Chains like as Polygon and Optimism. All these on-chain metrics, coupled with the recent proposal by MakerDAO\u2019s co-founder Rune Christensen to utilize a fork of Solana\u2019s codebase for the creation of MakerDAO\u2019s upcoming native chain called \u201cNewChain\u201d appears to have sparked another round of assertions that Solana is a potential Ethereum killer.\n\nSOL market cap currently at $26.64 billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nYakovenko recently took to social media platform X to speak on the recent Ethereum killer making rounds again. According to him, both networks can co-exist even while competing and having most of the same features.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t bring back last cycle \u201ceth killer\u201d bs,\u201d Yakovenko said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a future where solana thrives and somehow eth dies,\u201d he continued.\n\nDon\u2019t bring back last cycle \u201ceth killer\u201d bs.

I am such a techno optimist that I am certain that\u2026 \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) December 2, 2023\n\nThe Future Of Ethereum And Solana\n\nSolana was initially created to address Ethereum\u2019s scaling solution, as the network could only process 15 transactions per second in its early days. Solana\u2019s solution then came with a combination of proof-of-history and delegated proof-of-stake protocols to process more than 50,000 transactions per second. Other networks like Cardano that serve the same use-case were also touted as potential Ethereum killers.\n\nHowever, this scalability issue has since been addressed on Ethereum and the network can now process up to 100,000 transactions per second. Layer-2 protocols have also been built, and Ethereum continues to retain its title as the king of altcoins.\n\nEthereum developers are also looking to increase transactional throughput by introducing a rollup scaling method called danksharding. Yakovenko also believes danksharding will eventually have enough bandwidth to accommodate all of Solana\u2019s data.\n\nSolana is currently trading at $63.43 and is on its way to the $70 price point. The first step would be to break above the yearly high of $65.5.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock"
