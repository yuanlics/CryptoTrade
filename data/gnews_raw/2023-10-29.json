        "title": "Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum ETF just entered a 240-day review process. Its Bitcoin cousin is expected in January - Fortune",
        "content": "The U.S. government on Friday published an application by crypto giant Grayscale to launch an Ethereum ETF for the spot market. Grayscale first applied for the ETF in early October, but the petition\u2019s appearance on the Federal Reserve is significant because it starts a 240-day clock by which the Securities and Exchange Commission must respond.\n\nThe start of the Ethereum ETF process also coincides with a surge in crypto prices this month that analysts believe is correlated to impending decisions by the SEC on a batch of Bitcoin ETF applications by Grayscale, BlackRock, and others.\n\nSince the start of October, Bitcoin prices have jumped around 27% while Ethereum has climbed 7%.\n\nMany in the crypto industry believe the approval of ETF products, which make it easy for retail investors to buy various assets in the form of shares, will result in a flood of new liquidity into the markets.\n\nWhile Grayscale has sought to launch a Bitcoin ETF for years, the SEC has rebuffed these efforts, leading the company to sue the agency last year. In late August, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals issued a unanimous and resounding decision that opened the door to widespread expectations that the SEC would issue an approval soon.\n\nMany industry watchers have circled early January for when the SEC is likely to grant approval, in part because that will coincide with another \u201cshot clock\u201d deadline for a Bitcoin ETF application by the crypto hedge fund Ark Invest.\n\nWhile Ark is currently at the head of the approval queue, it remains to be seen if the SEC will approve its application first or instead approve a larger batch of applicants all at once. It\u2019s also possible, though unlikely, the agency will find a new pretext to delay or not approve the Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nThe process has been slow and convoluted in part because it involves a two-part approval\u2014one to permit exchanges to list crypto ETFs, and a separate one for individual companies to issue the ETFs.\n\nIn a quirk of the regulatory process, the SEC has approved futures ETFs for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. While these are also crypto ETFs, the underlying assets they contain are not digital assets but instead futures contracts that are well understood only by investors well-versed in derivatives.\n\nIn response to a request for comment about the ETF application, a company spokeswoman said: \u201cThe filing reflects Grayscale\u2019s ongoing commitment to converting its entire family of crypto investment products to ETFs.\u201d"

        "content": "Ethereum price is consolidating gains below the $1,850 resistance against the US dollar. ETH must stay above the $1,750 support to start a fresh increase.\n\nEthereum is still struggling to gain pace for a move above $1,850.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,770 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key contracting triangle forming with support near $1,780 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could extend its decline if it fails to stay above the $1,740 support.\n\nEthereum Price Remains In Range\n\nEthereum failed to continue higher above the $1,850 level and started a downside correction. ETH corrected lower below $1,800, but the bulls remained active near $1,750.\n\nA low was formed near $1,741 and the price is now making a fresh attempt to gain pace, like Bitcoin. There was a move above the $1,780 level. The price tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,866 swing high to the $1,741 low.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $1,770 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key contracting triangle forming with support near $1,780 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nOn the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $1,800 level. The first major resistance is near the $1,815 zone. It is near the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,866 swing high to the $1,741 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA close above the $1,815 resistance could start a decent increase. In the stated case, Ether could revisit the $1,850 resistance. The next key resistance is near $1,865, above which the price could accelerate higher. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $1,920 level. The main hurdle sits at $2,000.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,815 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,780 level, the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, and the trend line.\n\nThe next key support is $1,740. A downside break below the $1,740 support might send the price further lower. In the stated case, Ether could drop toward the $1,700 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,720\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,815\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Rockets Up 8% \u2013 $2,000 ETH Incoming?\n\nThe Ethereum price has risen to $1,815 today, gaining by 1.5% in 24 hours and 8.5% in the past week amid rising investor positivity.\n\nETH has also risen by 14.5% in the past fortnight, while the altcoin is up by 51% since the beginning of the year.\n\nThis makes it one of the best-performing major tokens since January, and with its fundamentals and momentum remaining strong, it could easily see additional gains in the coming days and weeks.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: ETH Rockets Up 8% \u2013 $2,000 ETH Incoming?\n\n\n\nEthereum\u2019s indicators continue to look very strong, with both its relative strength index (purple) and 30-day moving average (yellow) signalling further rises.\n\nIts RSI has risen back above 70 after dipping a little a few days, implying that buying pressure remains very much with the coin.\n\nLikewise, ETH\u2019s 30-day average is climbing strongly towards its 200-day average (blue), with conventional wisdom suggesting that the current rally won\u2019t peak until the shorter term average is noticeably higher.\n\nThe coin\u2019s support level (green) also points to additional rises, while this indicator also suggests that ETH won\u2019t fall back down to its pre-rally level if it corrects in the near future.\n\nETH continues to be strong as a result of investor positivity regarding Bitcoin ETFs, with the SEC looking increasingly like it will approve a number of recent applications at the start of the next year.\n\nSuch positivity has fed into the rest of the market, with ETH recovering in the past week or so after investors spent a couple of months overselling it.\n\nFundametals\n\n\n\nThe coin\u2019s fundamentals weighed heavily against the selling it witnessed, yet now it has moved into a position where it\u2019s ready to make up for lost ground.\n\nAnd it should rally more than pretty much any over alt if and when the Bitcoin ETFs are approved, and for various reasons.\n\nFor one, the approval of Bitcoin ETFs opens the door to the approval of Ethereum ETFs, with institutions interested in ETH more than any other altcoin.\n\nSecondly, Ethereum continues to be the biggest layer-one blockchain network by some distance, with its total value locked in accounting for roughly 55% of the entire DeFi sector.\n\nThis percentage doesn\u2019t include Ethereum-based layer-two networks, which would bump its total to around 63%.\n\nOn top of this, Ethereum has also attracted the highest-profile adoption in recent months.\n\nThis includes Visa\u2019s stablecoin trials, as well as PayPal\u2019s Ethereum-based stablecoin, and not to mention Coinbase\u2019s own layer-two network.\n\nGiven such ongoing interest, the Ethereum price is likely to reach $2,000 in the next few weeks.\n\nFrom there, it could end 2023 at around $2,500.\n\nOther Altcoins With Strong Potential\n\n\n\nWhile ETH looks set to continue rising, it isn\u2019t the only high-potential altcoin in the market right now.\n\nA number of presale tokens also look very promising, with some of these likely to witness big rallies when they list on exchanges in the coming weeks.\n\nPerhaps the favorite the rise the most is Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), a tokenized cloud mining platform that has already raised over $2.7 million in its presale.\n\n#BitcoinMinetrix hits another major milestone!

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nGlobal investment manager VanEck has made a bold prediction about Solana, suggesting that the SOL token may reach a staggering price of $3,211 by 2030, potentially surpassing the returns of the more established Ethereum.\n\nDespite SOL falling steeply following the FTX debacle, Solana, a high-performance blockchain known for its scalability and speed, has been gaining significant attention in the world of cryptocurrency and decentralized applications.\n\nIn their report, VanEck outlined the factors that led to their bullish prediction for SOL in the next decade. They presented a range of scenarios, with the most conservative estimate being $9.81 and the most optimistic projection reaching a remarkable $3,211.28, depicting a 10,000% surge in price.\n\nOne of the most compelling aspects of VanEck\u2019s prediction is their belief that Solana could become the first blockchain to host an application that onboards over 100 million users. As per the firm, this achievement would be a significant milestone in the blockchain industry and a game-changer for SOL\u2019s adoption and value.\n\nNotably, the report assumed that Solana will monetize at only 20% of Ethereum\u2019s take rate, indicating that even a relatively modest market share could result in substantial returns for SOL token holders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, the firm suggested that Solana might achieve less than half of Ethereum\u2019s market share due to fundamental differences in community philosophy. This perspective highlights that while Ethereum emphasizes decentralization and community governance, Solana has taken a more pragmatic approach to scalability and speed, which could attract a different set of users and developers.\n\nVanEck\u2019s optimistic outlook is based on its vision of a credible path to $8 billion in revenues for SOL token holders by 2030. If this prediction materializes, it would not only be a significant achievement for Solana but also a testament to the growth and potential of the broader blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has been characterized by its volatility and rapid changes, making long-term predictions a challenging endeavour. However, VanEck has positioned itself to take on the crypto market with safer vehicles.\n\nLast Friday, the New York-based firm submitted a revised application for the highly-anticipated Bitcoin Spot ETF, aligning itself with industry leaders such as BlackRock, Ark Invest, and Fidelity, all eager to capitalize on the promising future of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency.\n\nAt press time, SOL was trading at $34.65, marking an impressive 6.8% gain in the last 24 hours, possibly spurred by the recent report. Notably, the cryptocurrency has been the top performer among the top 20 coins in the past week, with a substantial 19% increase, according to CoinMarketCap data."

        "content": "Dogecoin, Ethereum, and Everlodge are amongst the more interesting altcoins to watch in the ongoing crypto rally.\n\nAlbeit different, all of these projects are attempting to position themselves the best they can for what seems to be a much-anticipated bull market.\n\nSummary:\n\nDogecoin\u2019s price pumps 5.2%.\n\nAli Martinez predicts Ethereum to reach $1,900.\n\nEverlodge\u2019s price has increased from $0.02 to $0.023.\n\nVisit the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) Aiming To Surpass the $0.07 Level\n\nDogecoin, the original meme coin has been popular ever since its launch back in 2021. Dogecoin quickly climbed up the ranks after being promoted by top figures like Elon Musk. The meme coin hit an all-time high of $0.7376 in May 2021 before plummeting to the $0.06 level in October 2023.\n\nDespite this significant price drop, Dogecoin still remains a top ten largest crypto ranked by market capitalization. As of the time of this writing, the price of Dogecoin recently jumped by 7.7% to reach $0.069.\n\nAlso, there was an increase in DOGE\u2019s trading volume, highlighting increasing support for the meme coin. As a result, some analysts have predicted that the Dogecoin price could aim for the $0.07 mark and potentially surpass it in the coming days.\n\nEthereum (ETH) To Reach $1,900\n\nOn October 20th, crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, told his Twitter followers that Ethereum is heading for the $1,900 level. According to the analysts, ETH has formed an ascending triangle pattern, which is a bullish formation.\n\nAli said Ethereum is \u201cready\u201d to bounce off the ascending triangle\u2019s hypotenuse. Moreover, the analyst emphasized that the Ethereum coin must close above the 18-day SMA (around $1,745) to reach $1,900. As of October 30th, the price of Ethereum has increased by 8.1% in the past week to hit $1,818.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has shown great recovery together with the rest of the crypto market. Meanwhile, the last time Ethereum reached $1,900 was in July 2023.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) Captures Whale Attention With Unique Features\n\nJust like Dogecoin and Ethereum, investors in the Everlodge presale are sweeping tokens. Everlodge is working on a blockchain real estate marketplace. It will allow more people to invest in vacation homes, hotels, and fancy villas.\n\nWhat makes Everlodge unique over traditional platforms is its NFT fractionalization approach to property co-ownership. It is the first project in the world to combine fractional vacation home ownership with timeshare and NFT technology. Besides, users get extra benefits on the platform.\n\nIn addition, investors can trade their NFTs on Everlodge or other ERC-20 compatible marketplaces. They can also use their property-backed NFTs as collateral to obtain loans. Investors who buy the Everlodge token, ELDG, can stake them to earn passive income every month.\n\nInvestors who hold the ELDG token also get special discounts when they buy properties on the marketplace. The Everlodge project is currently in its sixth presale phase, selling its ELDG tokens for $0.023 each.\n\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale:\n\nWebsite: https://www.everlodge.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/everlodge\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "content": "The anticipation of a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) approval in the U.S. is one of the drivers of the recent crypto market surge. However, analysts expect a spot Ethereum (ETH) ETF to follow closely behind a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF.\n\nAccording to Raoul Pal, the spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are some of the most significant developments in the industry. The macro economy expert anticipates the spot BTC and ETH ETF to behave like a halving event. The expert does not expect a price surge instantly but in a gradual manner.\n\nAlso Read: Over $4.5B Worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum Options Set to Expire\n\nAccording to Pal, \u201cThe ETH spot ETF will happen as well; of course, it\u2019ll be later; as soon as the Bitcoin one is done, they\u2019ll front run it by going to the ETH one because they know that\u2019s the next one.\u201d\n\nPal further added, \u201cThe Bitcoin ETF, I don\u2019t think of the as a one-off event. People think of it as this liquidity injection into the crypto economy, and I\u2019m saying it\u2019s a trade agreement.\u201d\n\nWhy will a spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF boost the crypto market?\n\nSource: Bitcoinist\n\nAccording to Pal, one of the biggest hurdles for institutions entering the crypto industry is the lack of proper regulations. However, the introduction of a spot ETF may bring in more protection for institutions. Moreover, a spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETF will bring significant institutional money into the sector. The inflow of institutional funds will most likely lead to a surge in the price of both assets.\n\nAlso Read: $15 Trillion Could Enter the Markets for Bitcoin Upon Spot-Based ETF\n\nMoreover, Pal anticipates other institutions, such as pension funds and asset managers, to step into the crypto space over time. The new players will further boost the market\u2019s liquidity and growth."

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price has seen a near-15% ascent in the last since October 22.\n\nDespite the recent rally, ETH needs to hold above the $1,727 and $1,650 barriers to move higher.\n\nA daily candlestick close below $1,650 will invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is in a good position after last week\u2019s rally. But things are not a given, as bulls need to defend a few key levels before they\u2019re in the clear. Investors need to watch the key barriers to know where ETH will head next.\n\nEthereum price at critical point\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has cleared the $1,650, $1,670 and $1,727 hurdles as it rallied 19% between October 19 and 25. This move created a local top at $1,865 and is contemplating its next move.\n\nGoing forward, investors can expect Ethereum price to retrace the aforementioned barriers and finda support. This move will allow the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) to reset at the 50 mean level, further adding credence to the bullish thesis.\n\nA strong bounce could send Ethereum price to tag the $2,000 psychological level as well as the range high at $2,030. The last time ETH tried to overcome this hurdle in mid-April, it failed. So, a move into this zone will be critical for the long-term outlook of the smart contract token.\n\nClearing the $2,030 hurdle or flipping it into a support floor will open the path to the next key resistance level at $2,424.\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade is a step toward a scalable settlement layer: Goldman Sachs\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nWhile the bullish outlook makes logical sense, it is dependent on Ethereum price holding above the $1,727 barrier. A daily candlestick close below this level that leads to a breakdown of the $1,650 support level will invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nIn such a case, Ethereum price could revisit $1,551 or slide lower to collect the sell-side liquidity resting below swing lows formed on September 10 and October 10.\n\nAlso read: Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Crypto markets turn bullish on ETF approval hopes"

        "title": "Can SOL Really Pump 10000% by 2030? Bullish VanEck Forecast Points to \u201cEthereum Killer\u201d Resurgence - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nVanEck\u2019s latest model predicts that the price of SOL could rise to over $3,000 by 2030.\n\nTo get there, Solana needs to launch an application with 100,000 users or more.\n\nBut is the platform more likely to launch a \u201ckiller app\u201d before Ethereum?\n\nWhen Solana launched in 2020, its proponents heralded the new blockchain as an \u201cEthereum killer\u201d that could dethrone its more established rival as the preferred infrastructure for building decentralized apps (dApps). But after a strong first year, a string of setbacks fell upon the project, hitting its developer community and suppressing the price of SOL.\n\nNow, however, the latest crypto market rally has rekindled interest in Solana. Exemplifying the trend, VanEck recently modeled a 6-year forecast in which SOL could pump to over $3,000. But the fund manager\u2019s prediction comes with one crucial catch.\n\nVanEck Predicts 10,000% Solana Price Hike\n\nWith the price of SOL currently up over 66% in the last 30 days, VanEck\u2019s latest report signals a resurgence of the Ethereum killer narrative.\n\nNoting that blockchain technology has yet to deliver a \u201ckiller app\u201d that propels it into the everyday lives of global consumers, VanEck\u2019s model is built on the assumption that Solana, and not Ethereum, will host the world\u2019s first 100M user dApp.\n\nAs a base estimate for the valuation of Solana\u2019s native token SOL, the report forecasts a price of $335 by 2030. In the most bullish scenario, it anticipates the token rising to $3,211 per token. However, for that to happen, VanEck notes that Solana must achieve \u201cEthereum-like dominance\u201d in the market for on-chain transactions.\n\nSolana 2030 price predictions\n\nUltimately, however, the image of the Ethereum killer was never about SOL supplanting ETH as the world\u2019s second-most valuable cryptocurrency. As the report acknowledges, partly because of its lower transaction fees, Solana\u2019s \u201ctake rate,\u201d i.e. how much value the network extracts from end-market applications, is roughly \u2155 of Ethereum\u2019s.\n\nBut while economic metrics like market capitalization and total value locked are often used to rank blockchain projects, if Solana is to launch a 100,000-user app, developer activity is a crucial measure of success.\n\nActive Developer Count: Crucial Metric for Smart Contract Platforms\n\nAccording to Artemis , the current Ethereum developer community is significantly more active than Solana\u2019s. During the past three months, there were 1748 active weekly Ethereum developers. In contrast, there were just 337 active Solana developers in the same period.\n\nFacing such a major disadvantage, Solana \u201cneeds to increase its total developer count as well as its market share of developers to increase the probability of hosting tomorrow\u2019s blockbuster application,\u201d VanEck observed.\n\nWeekly active blockchain developers\n\nOne of the factors that has traditionally inhibited the growth of Solana\u2019s developer community is the need for proficiency in the Rust programming language.\n\nHowever, the pool of Rust developers equipped to build dApps on Solana is growing.\n\nResearch by Developer Nation found that in 2023, Rust emerged as the 11th most popular programming language among developers, having climbed from 14th place in 2021. Stack Overflow\u2019s annual developer survey has deemed Rust the most admired programming language for 7 years in a row. Of those surveyed, more than 80% of developers who used Rust in 2023 want to use it again next year.\n\nIn the end, Solana may never topple Ethereum. But in the coming years, Rust\u2019s rising popularity and the availability of tools that make Solana development more accessible could give the platform an edge over its peers."

        "title": "Bitcoin Mining vs. Ethereum Mining: Finding Your Path to Profits - Baltic Times",
        "content": "In the rapidly expanding world of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin and Ethereum have emerged as two of the most popular and valuable digital currencies. As individuals and investors seek opportunities to enter the crypto market, mining remains a lucrative avenue for potential profits. This article explores the key differences between Bitcoin mining and Ethereum mining, shedding light on their respective processes, rewards, and challenges. Whether you're a seasoned crypto enthusiast or a newcomer, understanding these distinctions will help you find your path to profits. For better insight you can visit https://bit-qt.app/.\n\nThe Rise of Cryptocurrency\n\nThe advent of cryptocurrencies brought about a revolution in the financial landscape, disrupting traditional monetary systems and offering innovative decentralized alternatives. Among the numerous platforms that facilitate online trading of cryptocurrencies. Aspiring miners can use this platform to enter the crypto market and explore the opportunities presented by Bitcoin and Ethereum mining.\n\nThe Pioneering Bitcoin Mining\n\nBitcoin, the pioneering digital currency created by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, has captured the attention of the world since its introduction in 2009. Bitcoin mining is the process by which new bitcoins are created and transactions are added to the blockchain. Miners use powerful computer hardware to solve complex mathematical puzzles, and the first one to solve the puzzle gets the right to add a new block to the blockchain and is rewarded with bitcoins.\n\nThe Challenge of Bitcoin Mining Difficulty\n\nOver the years, Bitcoin mining has become increasingly competitive and challenging. The Bitcoin network is designed to adjust the mining difficulty level approximately every two weeks to ensure that new blocks are added at a consistent rate. As more miners join the network, the difficulty increases, making it harder to mine new bitcoins. As a result, miners now require specialized, high-performance mining rigs to remain profitable.\n\nEthereum Mining: Beyond Digital Currency\n\nIn contrast to Bitcoin's primary focus as a digital currency, Ethereum is a decentralized platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). Ethereum mining is essential for processing transactions and securing the Ethereum network. Miners use graphics processing units (GPUs) to solve cryptographic puzzles, and those who succeed in solving them add new blocks to the Ethereum blockchain and are rewarded with Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the platform.\n\nThe Ethereum Mining Reward System\n\nEthereum's mining reward system differs from Bitcoin's in several ways. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum has not implemented a hard cap on its total supply, meaning that new Ether coins are continually being created through mining. However, Ethereum has proposed a shift from the current proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS), where miners are replaced by validators who secure the network by staking their Ether.\n\nEnergy Consumption: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum\n\nOne of the critical concerns surrounding cryptocurrency mining is its energy consumption. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum mining are energy-intensive processes due to the computational power required to solve the cryptographic puzzles. However, Bitcoin's PoW algorithm, known as SHA-256, demands more power compared to Ethereum's current Ethash algorithm. The proposed shift to PoS in Ethereum is expected to significantly reduce its energy consumption.\n\nDiversification or Specialization: Choosing Your Mining Path\n\nWhen considering entering the mining space, individuals must decide whether to focus on Bitcoin mining, Ethereum mining, or both. Bitcoin's long-standing position as the leading cryptocurrency and its widespread adoption make it a relatively stable choice for miners. On the other hand, Ethereum's potential shift to PoS and its versatile platform for DApps offer unique opportunities for those looking to diversify their crypto mining ventures.\n\nPool Mining vs. Solo Mining\n\nAnother crucial decision for miners is whether to join a mining pool or opt for solo mining. Pool mining involves combining computational resources with other miners to increase the chances of successfully mining a block. While this leads to more frequent but smaller rewards, solo mining offers the potential for higher individual rewards but with a lower probability of success.\n\nThe Future of Mining: Staying Profitable in a Changing Landscape\n\nAs the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, staying profitable in mining requires adaptability and staying informed about industry developments. Monitoring changes in mining difficulty, keeping an eye on energy costs, and understanding the implications of proposed upgrades like Ethereum's shift to PoS are vital for miners looking to make informed decisions.\n\nEmbracing the Journey: Bitcoin and Ethereum Mining\n\nIn conclusion, Bitcoin mining and Ethereum mining present distinct paths to potential profits in the world of cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin remains the gold standard and a stable choice for miners, Ethereum offers exciting possibilities with its shift to PoS and a versatile platform for DApps. Whichever path miners choose, leveraging reputable online trading platforms like Crypto Loophole can provide a solid foundation for exploring the exciting world of crypto mining. Embracing the journey with the right knowledge, tools, and determination will undoubtedly lead to rewarding experiences in the ever-evolving crypto market."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest crypto by market capitalization, has been in the spotlight due to its price action. A notable crypto analyst, Pentoshi, shed light on the asset\u2019s price trajectory, suggesting a possible uptick in value if current conditions prevail.\n\nIt is worth noting that this analyst\u2019s predictions come at a time when Ethereum trails behind Bitcoin\u2019s recent price rally. Notably, while Bitcoin has recorded a 12.5% increase over the past week, Ethereum\u2019s gains are modest, rising by 8.4% during the same timeframe.\n\nEthereum Price Bracket Significance\n\nAccording to the analyst\u2019s post, Ethereum\u2019s immediate future could see an upward trend if it manages to close the week within a specific price range. The suggested target zone, between $1,796 and $2,148, is critical, as highlighted by Pentoshi.\n\nShould ETH\u2019s closing price fall within this bracket, the analyst posits a potential path cleared for Ethereum to reach or even surpass the $2,200 mark. While Ethereum lags Bitcoin\u2019s recent performance, the analyst remains optimistic about its prospects.\n\nPentoshi indicates that Ethereum is approaching a \u201cdemand zone,\u201d on the BTC/ETH ratio. Notably, this could stimulate buying activity and influence its price positively.\n\n$ETH\n\nClosing this weekly back inside the range opens up the doors to $2,200 Despite it severely underperforming BTC it\u2019s now beginning to enter the demand zone on the btc /eth ratio BTC is bullish as long as above the 31.5-32.5k area thus I\u2019ll continue to have bullish bias\u2026 pic.twitter.com/Hwoi8jwr2O \u2014 Pentoshi \ud83d\udc27 euroPeng \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa (@Pentosh1) October 29, 2023\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Bullish Standpoint Maintained\n\nPentoshi is bullish on Bitcoin, the pioneer cryptocurrency, provided it remains above a particular threshold. The $31,500 and $32,500 area is highlighted as Bitcoin\u2019s support zone. The analyst maintains that staying above this range could sustain the positive outlook on Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, a dip below these levels would suggest re-evaluating this bullish analysis. Regardless, Bitcoin does not currently appear to be moving towards any support but instead seems to be pushing above any resistance.\n\nIn just four days, the asset has climbed from a trading price of $34,000 last Thursday to a present trading value of $34,760 at the time of writing. It\u2019s worth noting that BTC has embarked on a significant uptrend, ascending more than 20% in the last two weeks.\n\nEthereum has also experienced a rally but hasn\u2019t matched Bitcoin\u2019s momentum. Over the past 14 days, ETH has seen a 14.8% increase and is currently trading at $1,820, marking a 1.4% rise in the last 24 hours alone.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Technical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nLast week, Ethereum displayed an interesting sign by surpassing the 100-day moving average, indicating the growing interest.\n\nHowever, a significant hurdle lies ahead, represented by the 200-day moving average. A breakthrough at this level could reignite substantial demand in the market.\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nUpon inspecting the daily chart, a robust uptrend emerged from the crucial $1.5K support region, with buyers impulsively driving the price above the 100-day moving average at $1,7K. This surge revived hope and demand, evident in Ethereum\u2019s price action over the past weeks, as it convincingly breached the 100-day MA with a notably large bullish candlestick.\n\nPresently, ETH faces a pivotal obstacle at $1.8K, restricted by the 200-day moving average. A successful breakout above this level could result in a strong uptrend, targeting the solid resistance at $2K. However, given the substantial recent surge, the market might undergo a temporary correction before initiating another significant move.\n\n\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nThe 4-hour chart highlights intensified bullish momentum and a steadily rising demand, clearly visible in Ethereum\u2019s recent price action. The past weeks have witnessed a compelling uptrend for Ethereum, characterized by significant bullish candles that surpassed key resistance levels.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum exhibited a promising sign by breaching a significant resistance zone, encapsulated by the upper boundary of the descending wedge and the static resistance level of $ 1.7K, confirming the wedge\u2019s reversal signal.\n\nHowever, the price currently contends with a crucial resistance zone around $1,850, leading to a sideways consolidation phase. This period allows the market to regain demand and attempt to breach the resistance region.\n\nConsequently, there is a high probability of a continued consolidation correction stage before the market definitively determines its next direction.\n\n\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe fund market premium metric plays a crucial role as it signifies the excess of the market price over the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the funds, reflecting the underlying assets they hold. Elevated readings indicate robust buying pressure within a specific country.\n\nUpon analyzing the chart, it becomes evident that this metric had declined since Ethereum achieved its all-time high in mid-November 2021, indicating waning interest in Ethereum funds. However, a noteworthy shift occurred following Ethereum\u2019s lowest point during the bear market. At that juncture, the metric began a modest uptick.\n\nBetween January 2023 and the present date, there has been consistent growth in the premium for Ethereum funds, indicating a surge in investor enthusiasm for these assets. This trend points toward a growing demand for Ethereum within the market.\n\nShould the premium for Ethereum funds persist in its upward trajectory, it signifies a reduction in the gap between the market price and the actual market value of Ethereum contracts. This convergence strongly suggests that investors are increasingly optimistic about ETH\u2019s potential."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), one of the leading cryptocurrencies, is displaying remarkable resilience in the face of recent market fluctuations. Despite experiencing relatively modest gains compared to Bitcoin (BTC) and other major altcoins, ETH has managed to consolidate its position above the $1800 mark.\n\nThe big question on everyone\u2019s mind is whether Ethereum can sustain this level or if it will succumb to the prevailing market sentiment.\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrencies, prices are highly susceptible to market sentiment. Cryptocurrencies often exhibit dramatic price swings based on the emotions and perceptions of investors and traders. Positive sentiment tends to drive prices up, while negative sentiment can lead to sharp declines. In this particular instance, the catalyst for market sentiment is the upcoming US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Role Of FOMC In Influencing ETH And The Crypto Market\n\nThe FOMC is a key division of the US Federal Reserve responsible for setting monetary policy in the United States. One of the primary tools at its disposal is the adjustment of interest rates. When the FOMC meetings take place, the decisions made regarding interest rates can have a significant impact on various financial markets, including cryptocurrencies.\n\nIf the FOMC decision leans towards a hawkish stance, implying an increase in interest rates, it could result in a surge of bearish sentiment across the cryptocurrency market. In such a scenario, Ethereum sellers might exert pressure, potentially pushing the altcoin below the $1700 mark.\n\nConversely, a dovish or unchanged policy stance could lead to a more positive sentiment, allowing ETH to maintain its current position and even experience upward momentum.\n\nSource: Coingecko\n\nAs of the latest data available on CoinGecko, Ethereum is trading at $1,816, showcasing a 1.8% gain over the last 24 hours and a notable 8.8% increase over the past seven days. While these gains may appear modest when compared to the cryptocurrency market\u2019s usual volatility, they reflect Ethereum\u2019s capacity to maintain a steady footing in turbulent times.\n\nEthereum currently trading at $1,826.1 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nEthereum Layer 2 Solutions Break Records\n\nA noteworthy development in the Ethereum ecosystem is the remarkable performance of Layer 2 (L2) solutions. These scaling solutions are designed to alleviate Ethereum\u2019s network congestion and high gas fees.\n\nRecently, L2 solutions set a new all-time high in Total Value Locked (TVL), briefly touching $12 billion before stabilizing around $11.89 billion. This achievement surpasses the previous historic high registered back in April at $11.85 billion, signifying the increasing adoption of Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 solutions.\n\nWith the $1,800 threshold serving as a crucial psychological barrier, the ultimate direction of Ethereum\u2019s price movement hinges on the delicate balance between market sentiment and the decisions of key financial institutions.\n\n(This site\u2019s content should not be construed as investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens continued their bullish momentum in the new week on Monday. All the crypto tokens stepped in the early trades, continuing the weekend momentum. The euphoria around regulatory approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) listing helped the crypto surge lately.\n\n\n\nBitcoin continued to remain firm as the largest crypto token gained about a per cent and managed to hover strongly above 34,000-levels. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, was also seen half a per cent each but remained below $1,800-level. Majority of the altcoins were trading with gains.\n\n\n\nBitcoin sustained its position above the $34,000 threshold, driven by the prevailing positive outlook regarding the potential approval of Bitcoin Spot ETF applications in the United States, said Edul Patel, Co-Founder & CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) witnessed its second-largest trading week to date, racking up $1.7 billion in trading volume, while the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) recorded $800 million in trading volume, possibly amplifying the overall market's positive sentiment. Ethereum, on the other hand, maintained its trading value above $1,700,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAll of the majority of top crypto tokens were trading higher on Monday. Solana surged about per cent, while Chainlink and Polkadot gained 3 per cent each. Polygon, Cardano and XRP gained about 2 per cent each in the early trade. Even the dollar pegged stablecoins inched up.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly higher, rising up to $1.26 trillion-mark, as it jumped about a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes surged more than 13 per cent to $27.37 billion.\n\n\n\nBitcoin concluded the week with a remarkable 15 per cent gain. Throughout the weekend, BTC maintained a positive stance but remained below its local resistance at $35,000. Currently, the price hovers around $34,300, while ETH is trading slightly above the local support level of $1,765, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\n\n\"It's worth noting that this week carries significant weight for the crypto market due to various macro events, including the US FOMC meeting, the monthly announcement of the US unemployment rate, US job openings, and the US non-farm Employment Change. These events have the potential to introduce volatility to the crypto market,\" it added.\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nChainlink (LINK) is currently in a major rally on the back of RWA (Real world assets) narrative and wider positive sentiment in the market. The token has been on the sidelines for most of 2022 and 2023 but recently saw a considerable surge in price. LINK went from $5.9 in early September to $11.2 today, a 90% surge in price.\n\n\n\nImage: Chart-Chainlink\n\n\n\nThe token has broken the $10 key resistance level, and continued strong development is likely. The Bollinger Bands are currently wide as the price volatility increases near the $9 mark and the price action is trending well above the indicator\u2019s mean line. The upward shift has propelled the RSI index to the overbought territory and is currently sitting at 76.9. If the price manages to successfully surpass the $12 mark, this could lead to further increase towards the resistance level of $13.5.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $10, $9, $7.85\n\nResistance: $12, $13.5\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "title": "ETH Price | Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Regains Ground Above $1,800 - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) price has over the last few days, affirming the ongoing bullish grip with higher support above $1,800. Most investors have a long-term outlook for Ethereum, with many of them booking positions ahead of the next bull market.\n\nMeanwhile, corrections have significantly reduced, elevating October as one of the most bullish months. If traders focus on holding their long positions intact, Ethereum price is bound to quickly close the gap to $2,000 with the possibility of the second recovery phase following suit to $3,000.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhen Is Ethereum Price Expected To Hit $2,000\n\nAccording to the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, ETH\u2019s uptrend is far from over. Possibly, bulls are just starting their field day. Traders began paying more attention to Ethereum longs after the blue MACD line flipped above the red signal line, sending a vivid buy signal on October 20.\n\nIf these long positions remain open while more traders seek exposure to ETH, the climb to $2,000 would be a matter of when and not if.\n\nThe 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) also upholds the bullish outlook as it crosses above the signal line, forming a golden cross pattern. A golden cross is a bullish pattern whose appearance assures traders that the path with the least resistance is to the upside.\n\nUp 8% in the last seven days, Ethereum price is trading at $1,816 on Monday during the US business hours. The uptrend will go a long way if bulls keep the immediate support at $1,815 intact.\n\nHowever, not all will be lost in case of a brief pullback\u2014one that would sweep through liquidity preferably at $1,800 to build the necessary momentum for the next run-up to $2,000.\n\nInvestors feeling already sidelined by the bullish trend in October are likely to appreciate the correction, as it would offer them a chance to buy Ethereum at a lower price point while anticipating a bigger breakout beyond $2,000.\n\nIn the event, that the pullback to seek volatility causes fear among traders and investors and they start to sell to lock in the gains, the 200-day EMA (purple) would be in line to absorb the selling pressure at $1,714. Further losses would seek refuge at $1,680, a support area marginally below both the 21-day EMA and the 100-day EMA.\n\nStaked Ether Rises To A Quater of The Total Supply\n\nThe decentralized finance (DeFi) sector in the Ethereum ecosystem has been growing at a commendable rate, thanks to the protocol\u2019s transition from the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm to a proof-of-stake (PoW) mechanism.\n\nDefi Llama shows that of the $42 billion of the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi systems, $22.8 billion is accounted for by Ethereum.\n\nIn October alone, ETH TVL\u2019s balance has grown by $3 billion from $19.8 billion. This increase can be attributed to the trend reversal that has seen Ethereum price rally from $1,522 to $1,816 and the long-term view investors have for Ethereum.\n\nBlockchain data from IntoTheBlock and shared by @KriptoBaykusV2 on Twitter (now X), shows that staked Ether has continued to grow in 2023 such that it accounts for at least a quarter of the the network\u2019s total supply.\n\n$ETH arz\u0131n\u0131n neredeyse d\u00f6rtte biri \u015fu anda stake ediliyor.

Liquid staking protocols like Lido and Rocket Pool account for the highest number of staked Ether but platforms like Maker, AAVE, and Uniswap are also very competitive.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Comsos\u2019 active users increased by 182% in the last 30 days.\n\nThe project was shifting market sentiment at press time.\n\nOver the last 30 days, Daily Active Users on Cosmos [ATOM] grew by 182%, data by Token Terminal revealed. Thus, the number of active addresses grew at a faster pace compared to Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], and Coinbase\u2019s L2 Base.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ATOM\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nIt seemed necessary to compare Cosmos to Bitcoin and Ethereum because they are the top two blockchains, in a nutshell. For Base, since its introduction, it has amassed a lot of adoption.\n\nHowever, the hype and activity around Base has dropped significantly. In fact, Token Terminal showed that the project\u2019s Daily Active Users reduced by 12.5%.\n\nThe Daily Active Users can offer vital information about a network\u2019s health. Aside from being a metric that measures user adoption, the metric can indicate a shift in market sentiment. Sometimes, it also has a big impact on token prices.\n\nMore data transport, more growth\n\nSurprisingly, Cosmos\u2019 native token ATOM did not feel the impact of the active user growth. At press time, the ATOM\u2019s value was $7.02\u2014 a similar price it was 30 days back.\n\nOne of the factors that influenced the increase could be linked to the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol expansion to the Binance Smart Chain. The IBC is an open-source protocol developed to handle the movement of data between blockchains.\n\nBased on AMBCrypto\u2019s report a few weeks ago, the expansion would also offer more opportunities for those involved in staking ATOM. Besides that, Cosmos is also making movies to ensure that it lasts long in the list of blockchains with a good level of development activity.\n\nThe project seems to be using its builders\u2019 program to this effect.\n\nSentiment goes sideways\n\nInterestingly, Santiment\u2019s data showed that the efforts are paying off for Comsos, as indicated by the Development Activity metric. Development Activity shows the commitment of developers to ensure the proper functioning of a network.\n\nAt press time, Cosmos\u2019 development had jumped to 16.22. This means that there has been an increase in the number of features shipped via the project. Cosmos also experienced an up-and-down trend in terms of market awareness.\n\nTo measure perception, on-chain platform Santiment uses the Weighted Sentiment metric. This metric tracks the positive/commentary about a project via social media platforms.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ATOMs worth today?\n\nAn increase in Weighted Sentiment means a surge in positive comments. Conversely, a decrease means a growing negative perception.\n\nFrom the data above, Cosmos\u2019 Weighted Sentiment was 0.365. Looking at the chart, the comments about the project were largely positive as of press time. However, the optimism seemed to be waning."

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nSome analysts are defiant in their belief that crypto can\u2019t continue to go up while stocks are down. It would appear that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, have other ideas.\n\nAs wars rage, bond markets are teetering, banks are on the brink, and equities are falling, the crypto market is staging a recovery, and not any old dead cat bounce, but what might be turning into a full blown bull market.\n\nBitcoin ready to break bullish pennant\n\nBitcoin leads the way, as is its due. Up 112% for the year so far, the alpha cryptocurrency is not showing any signs of faltering. Currently inside of a bull pennant that has continued to lengthen, the bitcoin price looks ripe for a further explosion to the upside.\n\nSource: Trading View\n\nA measured move for the flag could take bitcoin to over $40,000, and with approval for the Spot Bitcoin ETF perhaps coming within days, and weeks at most, the future for bitcoin does look bright.\n\nEthereum waking up at last\n\nJust like bitcoin, ethereum has had its obstacles to overcome. It has lagged the king of the cryptocurrencies thus far, in that it is only just managing to consolidate above its 200-day moving average.\n\nSource: Trading View\n\nHowever, now it is above this extremely important indicator, a flag is forming from which price could be catapulted higher. The $ETH measured move here would likely be to over $2,150.\n\nSolana outperforms them all\n\nThe talk in technical crypto circles right now is on Solana\u2019s game-changing Firedancer which is set to enhance scalability and processing times to levels practically unheard of until now. According to analysts, latency times can be reduced to milliseconds - the same as is achieved on the world\u2019s major stock exchanges. An analyst quoted from a Messari report when he stated:\n\n\"They talk about how Firedancer puts Solana in the range of CEX latency times... And they go on and talk about things like security and expenses and processing times and, again, latency, which is so important,\"\n\nWith this kind of news in the forefront for Solana, the price of $SOL is being driven strongly. 335% up on the year, $SOL is emerging as one of the major catalysts for the crypto bull market.\n\nSource: Trading View\n\nAn upward sloping channel is guiding the price higher, and although this is usually a bearish chart pattern, if the price is forced out of the top of the channel, it would become very bullish for $SOL indeed.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "content": "With the recent surge of Bitcoin (BTC) comes a renewed optimism on other key cryptocurrencies. Ethereum (ETH) is expected by the cryptocurrency community to follow suit with all eyes looking at the $2,000 level.\n\nRecent Movements of Ethereum\n\nRecently, Ethereum has successfully overcame several barriers, including the $1,650, $1,670, and $1,727 thresholds, marking a notable 19% gain in value between October 19 and 25. This rally led to a local peak at $1,865, and now the digital asset finds itself at a crossroads.\n\nFXS suggest that, going forward, Ethereum is likely to retrace its steps to these aforementioned hurdles, subsequently finding support. Such a retracement would also provide an opportunity for the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) to reset at the 50 mean level. This RSI reset could provide additional weight to the bullish case, bolstering the confidence of investors.\n\nShould Ethereum experience a substantial bounce, the next major milestone for the cryptocurrency would be tagging the psychologically significant $2,000 level and the range high at $2,030. Notably, Ethereum faced this challenge earlier in April but couldn\u2019t overcome it. Thus, any move into this territory will be seen as pivotal in shaping the long-term prospects of this blockchain-based smart contract token.\n\nBeyond $2,030, the path forward for Ethereum would hinge on its ability to clear this hurdle or convert it into a supportive platform. Success on this front would pave the way for Ethereum to target the next notable resistance at $2,424, making this a critical juncture for the cryptocurrency\u2019s future.\n\nWhile the bullish outlook for Ethereum\u2019s price seems logically sound at this rate, it remains dependent on the cryptocurrency\u2019s ability to maintain its position above the $1,700 mark. In the event of a daily candlestick close below this level and a subsequent breach of the $1,650 support, the optimistic scenario may lose its footing. If this occurs, Ethereum\u2019s price could revisit $1,551 or potentially slide even lower, collecting sell-side liquidity resting beneath the swing lows established on September 10 and October 10.\n\nCurrent Status of Ethereum\n\nAs of this writing at 8:00 AM UTC time, Ethereum is moving sideways at around $1,790. The numbers are just 0.30% up on a 24-hour frame but ETH has witnessed a spike of 27% in trading volume to $5 billion in the same period. At present, the cryptocurrency has a market cap of $215 billion with a circulating supply of 120 million ETH.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey towards $2,000 is met with promise, but it\u2019s crucial for investors to remain vigilant. Ethereum\u2019s performance relies on maintaining key support levels, and a close watch on these barriers is warranted. Whether it successfully navigates these obstacles or encounters setbacks, Ethereum\u2019s price remains an engaging storyline in the cryptocurrency market."
