        "title": "Ethereum loses its shine as Bitcoin dominates, Solana climbs - Fortune",
        "content": "The rising crypto tide of 2023 has lifted all boats, but some of those vessels are floating higher than others. Bitcoin, riding a wave of ETF optimism, is worth far more than all of the other digital assets combined and is up a handsome 132% on the year. Ethereum rival Solana appears to have shaken off its Sam Bankman-Fried association once and for all and this week eclipsed XRP to become the fifth-biggest token in the market while climbing over 400% in 2023. And Ethereum? It\u2019s up a relatively modest 66%.\n\nPrice movements are hardly the only way to judge a currency of course. Meme coins like Doge or BONK or whatever regularly pop up by crazy amounts on the heels of social media hype but still lack any logical value proposition. Still, price reflects sentiment\u2014vibes if you prefer\u2014and right now the vibe around Ethereum feels decidedly stale.\n\nAs we embark on what looks like a new crypto bull market, Ethereum is facing familiar problems of absurdly high gas fees that make simple transactions unviable. Meanwhile, its vaunted layer-2 solutions do make the blockchain affordable but also introduce an unwelcome layer of complexity for casual crypto users. It\u2019s the same old story and there are no signs it\u2019s going to change anytime soon.\n\nMessari founder and crypto wiseman Ryan Selkis makes this case in his annual industry prognosis, writing that Ethereum is losing some of its luster:\n\n\u201cETH is straddled. BTC outperforms ETH as digital money thanks to institutional allocators\u2019 interest in the digital gold \u2018pure play\u2019 while broad availability of Ethereum substitutes (L0s, L1s, L2s) will likely lead to those substitutes\u2019 outperformance as they sop up onchain volumes relative to the Ethereum main chain. I don\u2019t see a scenario where ETH outperforms bitcoin AND its up-and-coming, higher-beta peers.\u201d\n\nSelkis, however, also points out that Ethereum losing a step was likely inevitable as competition increased in the smart contract industry that it pioneered:\n\n\u201cIf anything, being bearish on ETH relative to the field is not an indictment of Ethereum, but rather a clear-eyed realization that ETH as an asset has been incredibly dominant so far, and has set the bar impossibly high to maintain over a 60% market share in its network token peer group. When I think of Ethereum vs. Solana, I think of Visa vs. Mastercard, not Google vs. Bing in terms of relative strength.\u201d\n\nThat sounds about right. Ethereum has many strengths, including its inclusive developer ecosystem and the pedigree of integrity that its creator Vitalik Buterin bequeathed, but there was no way it was going to remain the only game in town. And for now, its role as the second-most-important blockchain remains unchallenged but, if the blockchain doesn\u2019t increase its vibe game in 2024, that could change.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nCrypto scammers are using a flaw in Twitter to create tweets containing URLs that look like they come from Binance, Ethereum, and other real sites.

The U.S., meanwhile, will likely continue to use regulatory enforcement actions to establish legal precedent within the digital asset marketplace, as development of a digital asset framework in the U.S. remains a more distant goal."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nSolana has overtaken Ethereum in key metrics like DEX volumes, NFTs, address activity, and stablecoin transfers.\n\nRunning Solana nodes is 5x more expensive than Ethereum, despite higher throughput.\n\nCostly nodes and developer gaps raise concerns about Solana.\n\nFiredancer client release aims to further decentralize and scale the network.\n\nEthereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) stand as two leading altcoins that have significantly contributed to the growth of cryptocurrency. Ethereum pioneered the use of smart contracts, introducing a new realm of possibilities in blockchain technology. Following this, Solana took these advancements further by significantly enhancing scalability, thereby expanding the potential applications and efficiency of blockchain-based solutions.\n\nIn a recent analysis , Ryan Watkins, co-founder of Syncracy Capital, shed light on Solana\u2019s rising prominence in the blockchain space, particularly in areas where Ethereum previously held dominance.\n\nSolana Is Rallying; Key Metrics Swell\n\nWatkins, in tweet , highlighted that Solana has overtaken Ethereum in several critical metrics. These include\n\nDecentralized exchange (DEX) volumes.\n\nNon-fungible token (NFT) trading volumes.\n\nThe number of active addresses.\n\nTransaction count.\n\nStablecoin transfers.\n\nChange happens fast. Solana now rivals or surpasses Ethereum across: \u2013 DEX Volumes\n\n\u2013 NFT Volumes\n\n\u2013 Active Addresses\n\n\u2013 Transaction Count\n\n\u2013 Stablecoin Transfers \u201cBut Solana isn\u2019t decentralized \ud83d\ude24\u201d Reality: Solana has ~40% the amount of nodes as Ethereum, they\u2019re only ~5x more\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ZBuLiTcXmf \u2014 Ryan Watkins (@RyanWatkins_) December 19, 2023\n\nThe swift change in Solana\u2019s metrics comes at a time when the network has become a focal point for developers and traders alike. In recent trading months, the price of SOL, Solana\u2019s native token, has experienced a significant uptrend. It has successfully breached key resistance levels, leading to the establishment of new highs for 2023.\n\nThe surge in SOL appears to be a catalyst for increased on-chain activities on the Solana network, as evidenced by the rise in transaction counts and metrics like the total value locked (TVL). Since September, SOL has seen its value more than triple from its lows.\n\nCorrespondingly, the network\u2019s decentralized finance (DeFi) TVL, according to data from DeFiLlama , has grown significantly, surpassing $1 billion. This marks a more than threefold increase from its July 2023 levels, which were around $270 million.\n\nSolana\u2019s growing preference among users and developers is largely attributed to its architecture and scalability, enabling cost-effective transactions and smart contract deployments. A key aspect of Solana\u2019s design is its reliance on independent nodes, which are incentivized for participation. This helps foster both decentralization and security within the network.\n\nCost Of Operating Nodes, Decentralization Comparison Arises\n\nWhile Solana\u2019s decentralization has been a topic of debate, Watkins points out that Solana operates with approximately 40% of the nodes that Ethereum has. A significant distinction, however, is the operational cost of Solana\u2019s nodes , which are about five times more expensive than those of Ethereum. According to Watkins\u2019 analysis, the network bears this higher cost in exchange for its throughput capabilities.\n\nData from Syncrancy reveals that running an Ethereum node costs around $550, whereas operating a high-end node on Solana\u2019s Firedancer platform can exceed $5,100. Despite the higher cost, Solana\u2019s nodes offer a substantial increase in throughput, with a transaction per second (TPS) rate of 55,000, compared to Ethereum\u2019s 100 TPS. This difference is a key factor in the shift towards Solana, despite the higher costs associated with its nodes.\n\nThe higher the Nakamoto Coefficient, the more decentralized a network is considered to be. As of December 19, the Nakamoto Coefficient stands at 21 for Solana, indicating no recent change. In comparison, Ethereum\u2019s coefficient is 2 according to Nakaflow data , suggesting that Solana is more decentralized than Ethereum. BeaconScan reports there are more than one million Ethereum nodes currently, while Solana Compass notes more than 2,900 Solana nodes .\n\nRyan Watkins, defending Solana, points out that decentralization involves more than just the node count and geographic distribution. He emphasizes the importance of diversifying Solana\u2019s developer ecosystem and integrating features like light clients for cost-effective user verification.\n\nI\u2019d wager we\u2019ll reach this within the next 3 years. Firedancer is already approaching this point, if it hasn\u2019t already reached it. While other chains will get better, Solana has dominated because it has continually improved on the protocol level, and the application layer \u2014 Joey | Stockpile (@joeymeere) December 20, 2023\n\nSolana\u2019s upcoming release of the Firedancer validator client is intended to further diversify and bolster the network\u2019s robustness and reliability. Notably, this client will enable nodes to produce blocks more rapidly, enhancing the network\u2019s capacity to process a larger volume of transactions on-chain. This development is a step towards scaling the mainnet without relying excessively on off-chain solutions."

        "content": "Despite recent hype surrounding Bitcoin and spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs_, JPMorgan believes that Ethereum will outperform Bitcoin in 2024.\n\nIn a Dec. 13 report, JPMorgan analysts wrote, \"We believe that next year Ethereum will reassert itself and recapture market share within the crypto ecosystem.\"\n\nThe analysts reason that the Ethereum EIP-4844 upgrade, also known as the Proto-Danksharding upgrade, is expected to take place during the first half of 2024 and is part of a multistep plan to make sharding more efficient on the Ethereum chain.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThough the process is complex, the idea is that it will allow shards to be analyzed in larger groups instead of a system that splits Ethereum into several shard chains. This upgrade will have a significant impact on Layer 2 solutions such as Polygon and Optimism. This is because it will allow these projects to have more access to network power, which will increase throughput and reduce transaction costs.\n\nJPMorgan believes that these upgrades will bring more investors to Ethereum and cause it to regain market share in the crypto sphere.\n\nJPMorgan is not saying that the price of Ethereum will appreciate. The analysts are \"cautious\" about crypto markets in 2024. They see Ethereum as one of the stronger tokens for 2024. While it may not go up in price, they still believe that it will perform better than other tokens, specifically Bitcoin.\n\nTrending: This brokerage offers custom rewards for users to switch \u2013 the biggest reward so far for 1 user is $19,977.48. Will yours beat it?\n\nDespite recent hype around spot Bitcoin ETF approvals and the upcoming Bitcoin halving, JPMorgan is still more bullish on ETH. The analysts believe that the spot Bitcoin ETFs are already priced in. Since approval seems imminent, they believe that markets have already priced in the impact this will have on Bitcoin. They cite the recent Bitcoin run-up as evidence for this.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey also think that the upcoming Bitcoin halving is already priced in. They looked at the ratio of Bitcoin's market price to production cost and saw that it decreased after the most recent halving in 2020. They expect a similar move will follow in 2024.\n\nOther topics discussed in the report revolved around their lack of confidence in decentralized finance (DeFi). They have not seen noticeable impacts of DeFi on the current financial system.\n\n\"The biggest applications of blockchain to traditional finance, i.e. overnight repo transactions via smart contracts in blockchain platforms hosted by companies such as Broadridge and JPMorgan, take place outside public blockchains,\" the analysts said.

        "title": "What Crypto Users Need to Know: The ERC20 Standard - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is ERC20?\n\nEthereum Request for Comment 20 (ERC20) is a standard for the Ethereum blockchain that requires nine scripting functions and two events that must be used when creating a fungible token within a smart contract. It is perhaps easiest to think of ERC20 as a set of instructions that a smart contract on the Ethereum network must include.\n\nKey Takeaways An ERC20 token is a standard for creating and issuing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nERC stands for \"Ethereum Request for Comment,\" and the ERC20 standard was implemented in 2015.\n\nPlenty of well-known digital currencies use the ERC-20 standard, including Maker (MKR), Basic Attention Token (BAT), Augur (REP), and OMG Network (OMG).\n\nHistory of ERC20\n\nERC20 was created by Ethereum developers on behalf of the broader Ethereum community in 2015 and was officially adopted in September 2017. In previous years, to create a standard of this type for Ethereum, a developer or group of developers submitted what was known as an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP), describing the new functionality along with its specific protocols and standards. A committee then reviewed, approved, amended and finalized that EIP\u2014at that point, it became an ERC.\n\nIn October 2023, Ethereum split ERCs and EIPs in two, creating two tracks for improvements. ERCs are standardization proposals for the application layer (how applications on Ethereum interact), and EIPs are blockchain improvement proposals for networking, interfaces, the consensus protocol, or other blockchain-specific improvements.\n\nSmart contracts and certain tokens within Ethereum are obligated to conform to one of the approved standards. While ERC20 is perhaps the most important and best-known of these ERC standards, it is not the only one in existence.\n\nERC20 Importance\n\nThe ERC20 standard has been a dominant pathway for creating new tokens in the cryptocurrency space for some time. There are tens of thousands of tokens that are ERC20 compliant.\n\nPer official documentation, the ERC20 standard \"...allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within Smart Contracts.\" In plain language, this means that a token (the alphanumeric sequence assigned to an asset) is created with the smart contract, making it only transferable if the conditions in the smart contract are met. An application programming interface (API) allows different applications that need access to the tokens the ability to do so.\n\nThis smart contract prevents parties from acting in bad faith because asset transfers are completed automatically, outside the control of the transactions, once they agree to the transaction.\n\nFor example, if Bob agreed to pay Alice 1 ETH for a new token she had created, it might be possible not to pay Alice once it was transferred. By keeping ownership locked to a smart contract, neither party needs to trust that the other would hold up their end of the bargain because the actions both need to take are completed for them.\n\nERC20 standardizes the way these smart contracts and tokens are created, letting them be reusable in other applications. This not only allows them to be easily inspected by interested parties, increasing transparency and trust in the system, but it also allows developers to use tokens and contracts that have already been created.\n\nContents of the ERC20 Standard\n\nERC20 contains nine functions that a compliant token must have:\n\nName : The token's unique name\n\n: The token's unique name Symbol : An abbreviation used as a ticker or for other identification purposes\n\n: An abbreviation used as a ticker or for other identification purposes Decimals : How many decimal places the token will use, signifying how small an amount can be transferred or owned\n\n: How many decimal places the token will use, signifying how small an amount can be transferred or owned TotalSupply : Provides information about the total token supply\n\n: Provides information about the total token supply BalanceOf : Provides account balance of the owner's account\n\n: Provides account balance of the owner's account Transfer : Executes transfers of a specified number of tokens to a specified address\n\n: Executes transfers of a specified number of tokens to a specified address TransferFrom : Executes transfers of a specified number of tokens from a specified address\n\n: Executes transfers of a specified number of tokens from a specified address Approve : Allows a spender to withdraw a set number of tokens from a specified account\n\n: Allows a spender to withdraw a set number of tokens from a specified account Allowance: Returns a set number of tokens from a spender to the owner\n\nAdditionally, these functions will trigger up to two events:\n\nThe Transfer Even t: Takes place whenever tokens are transferred\n\nt: Takes place whenever tokens are transferred The Approval Event: Activated whenever approval is required\n\nOther ERCs\n\nWhile ERC20 has seen widespread support in the form of new tokens and token-based products conforming to its standards, there are many other token standards proposed.\n\nThere are more than 80 total ERCs implemented, and many more are submitted and waiting for approval or rejection. Some notable approved proposals include ERC223, which aims to address a concern with the approval and transfer elements of ERC20; ERC721, the standard for non-fungible tokens; and ERC3156, a standardization of flash loans.\n\nIs ERC20 the Same As ETH Network? The blockchain Ethereum has its own cryptocurrency, ether (ETH). The Ethereum Request for Comment number 20 (ERC20) is an implemented standardization proposal for smart contracts. So, while they are all related, they are not the same thing.\n\nIs Coinbase an ERC20 Wallet? Coinbase is one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges. Its wallet accepts ECR20 tokens.\n\nWhich Wallets Support ERC20? Many of the popular wallets support ERC20. MetaMask, Trezor, Ledger Nano X, Binance, and Exodus all have ERC20 support.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nERC20 is a community-proposed standard for smart contracts and tokens associated with them. The standard allows users to transfer tokens and be re-used by any other Ethereum application. It also makes it easier for them to be approved because the standardized elements must all be present.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "content": "The PBS Foundation is opening applications for an initial $1 million in grants for research and development on Ethereum proposer-builder separation.\n\nThe non-profit\u2019s pilot phase drew support from Coinbase, Consensys, Fenbushi Capital, Flashbots, Paradigm, the Uniswap Foundation and Vitalik Buterin.\n\nGrants will be disbursed by a council. The council includes representatives from Blocknative, Consensys, the Ethereum Foundation and Flashbots, among others. The foundation\u2019s grant lead is Eugene Leventhal from the research group Metagov.\n\nRead more: For Ethereum rollups, dealing with data remains a bottleneck\n\nFirst proposed by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, proposer-builder separation (PBS) is the concept of separating proposers \u2014 which submit transaction bundles to validators on a blockchain \u2014 and builders, which organize the transactions in a specific order.\n\nPBS represents an attempt at decentralization, as the combination of proposing and building gives well-heeled centralized mining pools a competitive advantage.\n\nPBS first went into effect after Ethereum\u2019s Merge to proof-of-stake. Now, the PBS Foundation aims to promote research and infrastructure to address some of the challenges the concept currently faces.\n\nNotably, MEV-boost relays have become centralized since the Merge. Relayers operate between block builders and validators on maximal extractable value (MEV) boosted transactions, selecting blocks with the highest possible fees. Roughly 90% of transactions in the last 500 epochs, or roughly two days, made use of MEV-boost. Of MEV-boost transactions in the past 24 hours, roughly 97% have been handled by five relayers, according to relayscan.\n\nBlocknative, once among those top relayers, discontinued its service in September, citing economic viability concerns. Relayers do not currently collect fees. Uri Klarman, CEO of bloXroute, which runs a large relayer, has advocated fee structures outside of public goods funding to incentivize more relayers to join the fray.\n\nA spokesperson for the PBS Foundation said the grant funding could be used to fund relayers, with a particular emphasis on those who introduce novel designs for relaying.\n\nThe funding will also be focused on community and educational materials, data transparency on Ethereum\u2019s mempool and blocks, and research on how PBS can be improved \u2014 or even enshrined \u2014 on both the primary network and on layer-2 networks.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "In the middle of last year, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) assessed the readiness of the public Ethereum mainnet for enterprise use cases. It concluded it was ready but with a few caveats. Today the EEA published its latest assessment, reducing its caveats.\n\nLike the previous report, the paper doesn\u2019t sugarcoat the challenges. But it does come across as pretty bullish.\n\nThat said, it surprisingly undersells itself in one important area. It describes the advantages to business as the \u201cstrong ecosystem, security, and decentralization.\u201d The reference to the strong ecosystem is a bit of an understatement. The consumer reach of public blockchain, and Ethereum in particular, is like a magnet for financial services firms seeking global distribution. Private blockchains do fine for institutional usage.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why so many institutions are exploring public blockchain, including SWIFT, Standard Chartered, HSBC, Citi, UBS and and JP Morgan. Asset managers are leading the way with Franklin Templeton\u2019s high profile blockchain money market fund \u2013 although the biggest chunk of that is on Stellar.\n\nOne massive Ethereum accomplishment since the previous assessment was \u201cThe Merge\u201d, Ethereum\u2019s move to Proof of Stake (PoS) which addressed the environmental concerns.\n\nNonetheless, the EEA acknowledges that PoS comes with downsides. Businesses are probably a little less concerned about the possibility of greater centralization. But the potential to exclude or reorder transactions (frontrunning) to achieve Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) is recognized as a challenge for business.\n\nPrivacy and scalability\n\nPrivacy and scalability are two of the biggest issues. The takeup of Layer 2 solutions has grown enormously in the past 18 months, which addresses scalability and costs. However, that also comes with some tradeoffs. One of the biggest criticisms of private blockchains is fragmentation, which is happening because of numerous layer 2 solutions. They also add complexity but, at the same time, provide more choice.\n\nThe one upside is bridges that enable interoperability for layer 2 solutions can be more secure than cross chain bridges, but are still a risk. In 2022 the value lost in hacks was $3.8 billion, according to Chainalysis, with bridges making up the majority.\n\nBeyond layer 2 solutions, scalability will be addressed at the mainnet level with Ethereum\u2019s plans for sharding.\n\n\u201cPrivacy remains a paramount concern, particularly in the context of Ethereum\u2019s application in business and financial systems,\u201d the report says. \u201cAs a result, many opt for private chains, which pose their own set of challenges, including the complexities of maintaining nodes and establishing trust among participants.\u201d However, increasingly privacy is addressed with zero knowledge proofs and other privacy enhancing technologies. Over time their scalability is being addressed.\n\nEY\u2019s Paul Brody did a good job of managing expectations. \u201cThe most consistent thing missing from every analysis is a reasonable sense of timeline,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe blockchain industry is far too big to go back to the days of 100-200% annual growth. That\u2019s not sustainable.\u201d\n\nHe concluded, \u201cThis is a multi-decade project, and if we want to sustain our enthusiasm and our energy to complete this transformational and valuable task, we need to calibrate our expectations accordingly.\u201d\n\nThe author holds nominal amounts of Ethereum for experimentation."

        "content": "Ethereum developers have tentatively decided on Jan. 17, 2024, for the upcoming \u201cDencun\u201d upgrade\u2019s first testnet deployment during the latest bi-weekly dev meeting on Dec. 21.\n\nOriginally slated for the last quarter of 2023, the \u2018Dencun upgrade was pushed to 2024 due to the engineering complexities involved.\n\nTim Beiko, the protocol support lead at the Ethereum Foundation, noted that the date is not set in stone and could change if major issues arise. The team aims to release a blog post detailing the fork during the week of Jan. 8, 2024 \u2014 giving stakeholders a week to prepare for the update.\n\nDencun upgrade timeline\n\nThe meeting set out a draft timeline for the testing phase of the Dencun upgrade.\n\nFollowing the Goerli testnet on Jan. 17, 2024, developers plan to run tests on other networks \u2014 Sepolia on Jan. 31, 2024, and Holesky on Feb. 7, 2024.\n\nThe developers aim to deploy the changes on the mainnet by the end of February 2024 if everything goes smoothly. However, these dates are subject to change based on the results of the testnet forks.\n\nDencun will be Ethereum\u2019s first major upgrade since \u2018Shapella\u2019 earlier this year, which was a significant milestone in itself, enabling staked ether (ETH) withdrawals from the blockchain.\n\nSimilarly, a major aspect of the Dencun upgrade is the implementation of \u201cproto-danksharding.\u201d This new process is designed to enhance Ethereum\u2019s capacity for data storage, a move that is expected to reduce fees for Layer 2 rollups and scale the blockchain by increasing space for \u201cblobs\u201d of data.\n\nBy improving data handling capabilities and efficiency, it aims to enhance the performance of rollups and, consequently, the overall throughput and affordability of the Ethereum network.\n\n\u201cLayer 3 app-chains\u201d\n\nIn addition to the Dencun upgrade, the meeting also highlighted a collaboration between Avail and StarkWare. The partnership aims to augment data availability for appchains within the Starknet Layer 2 network. Leveraging Madara, a customizable sequencer, this initiative seeks to develop app-chains that will function as Layer 3 solutions within the Starknet ecosystem.\n\nThese Layer 3 app-chains, powered by the combined efforts of Avail and StarkWare, aim to revolutionize data availability modes, including validium and sovereign rollups. This, in turn, will help optimize transaction processing efficiency and finality, which is crucial for blockchain scalability.\n\nThe developers also touched upon Ethereum\u2019s role in the broader context of decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology. They reiterated their commitment to maintaining Ethereum\u2019s position as a leader in the space, emphasizing the need for continuous innovation and adaptation to meet the ever-evolving demands of the market.\n\nThe meeting also provided a platform for developers to discuss the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for Ethereum. From addressing network congestion issues to enhancing user experience, the developers explored a range of topics that are critical to Ethereum\u2019s roadmap and its users\u2019 needs."

        "content": "WAKEFIELD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) has today announced the release of the EEA Ethereum Business Readiness Report 2023 available as a free, downloadable document.\n\nThe over 100-page report contains what the EEA believes to be the most thorough and in-depth look at the business adoption of Ethereum available today. Continuing the work of the inaugural edition released in June, 2022, the report is a systematic assessment of the capabilities and potential of Ethereum as a business platform.\n\nPaul Brody, Member of the Board of the EEA and Global Blockchain Lead at EY, said: \u201cAlthough overall blockchain adoption in the enterprise may have slowed, the share taken by Ethereum has gained significantly. This by itself is a huge milestone because it starts to reduce the complexity firms experience when they enter the blockchain space. More and more, the default choice tends towards Ethereum.\u201d\n\nKaren Scarbrough, Member of the Board of the EEA and Senior Technical Program Manager at Microsoft, said: \u201c2023 was another year of the Ethereum ecosystem further addressing scalability and privacy in an accelerated manner compared to that of private blockchain implementations. In the future, we will assuredly look back on this year as one of the strongest foundational building years in Ethereum\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nThe report is based on a mix of quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative analysis has been based on EEA\u2019s unique, proprietary database of 260 \u201creal world\u201d, business-oriented projects outside the well-known worlds of consumer DeFi and NFTs. Qualitative data comes from an extensive series of interviews and case studies, many of which are printed in full in the Appendix of the report.\n\nWhat readers will find\n\nThe report is broken up into 5 main sections and an extensive Appendix, as follows:\n\nSection 1: The Year in Business Ethereum\n\nSection 2: A Snapshot of the Use of Ethereum & EVM in Business Today\n\nSection 3: Observations and Trends\n\nSection 4: Assessing the Business Readiness of the Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nSection 5: Conclusion\n\nCase Studies: Roxpay, XEROF, Shell Avelia, Rubey.be, Tokenchampions, Tokeny, Sage, Blocksquare, Fnality, BR\u00d8K, Opera Minipay Wallet, Circularise\n\nInterviews: Dan Heyman, Palm; Alex Tapscott, Author; Vikram Seth, Shell; Joe Lubin, Consensys; Rene Reinsdorf, Celo; Steven Goldfeder, Offchain Labs; Markus Schorn and Jens Herrmann, Deutsche Telekom\n\nThe report is available as a free download on the EEA website.\n\nAbout the EEA\n\nThe Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) enables organizations to adopt and use Ethereum technology in their daily business operations. The EEA empowers the Ethereum ecosystem to develop new business opportunities, drive industry adoption, and learn and collaborate. The EEA Community Projects provides a hub for open source development of code, APIs, standards, and reference implementations.

        "content": "Ethereum Foundation Developers set tentative dates for a major upgrade to scale crypto\u2019s biggest altcoin blockchain.\n\nDuring a biweekly call, developers disclosed that Jan. 17 is a possible date for testing the Dencun upgrade on Goerli\u2019s testnet. Dencun was delayed past Q4 2023 due to technical difficulties building its code.\n\nThe upgrade, known as EIP-4844, aims to increase blockchain space for data blobs and slash layer-2 rollup fees by activating proto-danksharding. This data storage expansion should scale Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, enabling more transaction capacity without hiking gas fees.\n\nBarring any disruption and assuming Dencun successfully tests on Goerli, devs plan to upgrade Sepolia\u2019s testnet by Jan. 31 and Holesky\u2019s network by Feb. 7. These forks represent the largest test chains on Ethereum.\n\nThe final soft target for shipping Dencun to the mainnet was set for February\u2019s end, however, this timeline is subject to change depending on developments. Dencun marks the first major technological upgrade since developers added withdrawal support for staked Ether (ETH) through Shapella\u2019s update.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1737898818488926282\n\nIn related news, the EthereumPoW network has moved toward complete autonomy by disbanding its core development team. This initiative was formed in 2022, shortly before ETH\u2019s blockchain transitioned from a proof-of-work model to proof-of-stake.\n\nRegarding ETH market performance for 2024, JPMorgan analysts believe the asset will reclaim market share from Bitcoin (BTC) and likely outclass most large-cap native blockchain tokens. An approved spot ETH ETF could also signal billions of dollars into defi\u2019s leading chain.\n\nEthereum price on Dec. 21 | Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "In a recent post on X, Sassal, an independent Ethereum educator, is doubling down on Ethereum (ETH). The angel investor said that based on current market sentiment, there are signals that the \u201cdeath of ETH\u201d narrative is losing steam.\n\nThis is a reason, in Sassal\u2019s view, to buy even more ETH ahead of the expected bull run.\n\nEthereum Bulls Confident, ETH Resistance At $2,400\n\nWith the bullish stance, the independent Ethereum educator appears to be convinced that Ethereum\u2019s fundamentals are strong. More importantly, the analyst is confident that the network is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for protocols, including those offering decentralized finance (defi) and non-fungible token minting services.\n\nThus far, Ethereum, despite the relatively sluggish performance compared to meme coins like BONK or PEPE, remains the second most valuable network only behind Bitcoin.\n\nFrom the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, the coin is within a bullish formation.\n\nThe coin rallied by nearly 60%, topping at December 2023 at around $2,400 before pulling back to spot rates. Even with the cool-off, buyers still have the upper hand.\n\nWhen writing on December 12, ETH prices found support at the dynamic reaction line, the 20-day moving average. It is also trading above the $2,100 support line, marking July 2023 highs. Accordingly, it means the bullish breakout formation of early December 2023 is valid.\n\nThis move could anchor optimistic buyers targeting $3,000 and even 2021 highs of around $5,000 in the days ahead.\n\nNetwork Is Upgrading: Will This Drive Prices Even Higher In January 2024?\n\nThe likelihood of trend continuation in 2024 also stems from plans by the platform\u2019s developers to enhance performance and scalability. With Ethereum 2.0 on, developers have been working on layer-2 scaling options like Arbitrum and Optimism to relieve the mainnet.\n\nHowever, going forward, on-chain scaling solutions like Sharding, where the network will be fragmented into units called \u201cshards\u201d that are interconnected, will be rolled out.\n\nEchoing Sassal\u2019s sentiment, another commentator on the X post noted that December and January have historically been \u201cmonster months\u201d for Ethereum in previous bull markets.\n\nThis suggests that even if Ethereum prices have not rallied by triple digits like some meme coins or even outperformed Solana (SOL), the coin could be poised for a significant price rally in the coming months.\n\nStill, how ETH prices will evolve in the upcoming sessions remains to be seen. As it is, $2,500 remains to be a key reaction point that if broken could trigger more demand.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Former Ethereum adviser Steven Nerayoff urges XRP holders to be concerned about ETHGate, emphasizing how the infamous theory affects XRP price.\n\nSteven Nerayoff, an early adviser to the Ethereum Foundation, has pointed out reasons why XRP community members should care about ETHGate.\n\nThe popular crypto adviser made this known yesterday during an exchange with an XRP holder who goes by the pseudonym XRP_Krnboy.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNerayoff Sues StormX Co-Founder\n\nIn his latest tweet, Nerayoff disclosed that he had sued StormX CEO Simon Yu and co-founder of U.S. Blockchain Coalition Arry Yu for colluding with the government in fabricating charges that led to his indictment in 2019.\n\nNerayoff, who has been commenting on ETHGate for months, alleged that Simon and Arry stole his tokens worth millions of dollars when they leveled extortion charges against him.\n\nThe crypto advisor revealed that he has enough evidence, including voice recordings, to show that Simon and Arry offered him more tokens in order to silence him.\n\nWhy XRP Holders Should Care About ETHGate\n\nCommenting on the development, XRP_Krnboy said XRP community members do not care about ETHGate. The X user stated that Ripple needs to settle its lawsuit with the SEC to set the stage for a potential XRP rally.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nFurthermore, XRP_Krnboy expressed concern about XRP\u2019s current price, suggesting that it seems stuck around the $0.60 level.\n\nResponding, Nerayoff highlighted two major reasons why XRP enthusiasts should care about ETHGate. According to Nerayoff, the so-called ETHGate theory is the major reason why XRP is still stuck around $0.60.\n\nIn addition, the former Ethereum advisor stated that XRP holders should be concerned about the corruption happening beyond their tokens if they care about living in a free society.\n\nInvestors in XRP don\u2019t give a shit about #ethgate? You should care because that why $XRP is as you say \u201c$0.6 omg\u201d. More importantly you should care about this level of corruption beyond your tokens if you care about living in a free society. \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) December 21, 2023\n\nETHGate Scandal and Debate\n\nFor context, ETHGate is a theory that has gone viral in the crypto space for years. Proponents of the theory alleged that the team behind Ethereum fostered relationships with prominent SEC officials to create a favorable regulatory environment for ETH to the detriment of other crypto assets.\n\nThis relationship, according to critics, prompted former SEC director William Hinman to declare ETH alongside Bitcoin as non-securities in 2018. In his remark, Hinman stated that ETH has become \u201csufficiently decentralized\u201d over the years and should no longer be classified as a security.\n\nOn the contrary, several crypto proponents, including Nerayoff, argued that Ethereum\u2019s 2014 ICO displayed less decentralization than initial sales of other digital assets.\n\nTo corroborate this claim, former Ethereum core developer Lane Rettig alleged that 70% of ETH supply was distributed during the pre-mine stage.\n\nHe added that only a few individuals purchased a huge percentage of the pre-mine ETH because they participated pseudonymously during the sales. To this day, no one knows the identity of the whales that scooped the huge amounts of pre-mined ETH."

        "content": "Solana\u2019s native asset SOL flipped XRP this morning to again become the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nAfter gaining more than 700% since its market bottomed out at the end of last year, SOL is now valued at nearly $34 billion. XRP and SOL trail only binance coin (BNB), tether (USDT), ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC).\n\nThis makes SOL one of the best performing top-100 cryptocurrencies of 2023. XRP, meanwhile, has only made about 80% \u2014 about the same as ether \u2014 but both have underperformed against bitcoin this year.\n\nXRP must still deal with a jury trial in Ripple\u2019s long-running US Securities and Exchange Commission saga. A federal court in July found the firm\u2019s programmatic sales to retail investors through crypto exchanges and other platforms didn\u2019t amount to securities, while direct sales to institutional investors did.\n\nRead more: Judge rules in SEC case vs Ripple\n\nThe trial, set for next spring, should finally determine to what extent Ripple Labs is culpable for flouting US securities laws, after the SEC dropped its charges against Ripple executives Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen in October. A settlement in the meantime is still possible.\n\nWhile Solana spent most of the third quarter of 2021 \u2014 peak bull market \u2014 ahead of XRP and a top-five coin behind tether, its more recent overperformance can in part be explained by how severely it crashed around the FTX debacle last November.\n\nClick play to watch Solana recover from its crash last year\n\nSam Bankman-Fried was invested heavily in projects across the Solana space, including SOL itself, and the crypto crashed by nearly two-thirds in three days when the market lost faith in cryptocurrencies orbiting the FTX co-founder. BTC and ETH meanwhile took only a 20% hit.\n\nSolana was a top-10 token before FTX\u2019s downfall, worth about half as much as XRP. In the months after, Solana ranked at the tail end of the top 20, behind polkadot (DOT), tron (TRX) and memecoin shiba inu (SHIB).\n\nNever underestimate the power of dog coins\n\nSolana has been busy catching up all year, propelled in part by a commitment from its developers to shake the network\u2019s association with Bankman-Fried, whose entities still hold claim to nearly $2 billion in SOL at current prices to be unlocked over the next few years.\n\nThe network boasts much of the same utility as smart contract-enabled blockchains like Ethereum, Tron, Avalanche and BNB Chain, albeit with its own unique brand of consensus, technology and tokenomics developed by San Francisco-based Solana Labs.\n\nApps and tokens run atop Solana, including decentralized exchanges, lending protocols and NFT marketplaces.\n\nSolana\u2019s overall dominance, which measures how much of the entire market is SOL, is at 2.13%, 0.6 percentage points lower than its November 2021 record.\n\nHype around new Solana-centric projects has helped inspire a certain Solanaissance. BONK, the network\u2019s resident dog coin, has seen its price multiply 100 times over the past two months \u2014 even after a healthy 50% correction this week.\n\nRead more: BONK\u2019s price pumped harder around Coinbase listing than any other crypto this year\n\nBONK mania even led to significant markups for Solana-branded smartphones upon realization that each one had been preloaded with 30 million BONK ($550) \u2014 about the same as the retail value of the device.\n\nElsewhere, the liquid staking protocol Jito airdropped $165 million worth of its new token, JTO, to its users earlier this month. Traders pushed the price of JTO higher following the distribution, with the whole process adding about $300 million in market value to the Solana ecosystem.\n\nLoading Tweet.. BONK and Jito are combining forces to seed Solana users with Christmas cheer\n\nThe anticipation of further airdrops scaled to Solana activity has since helped drive on-chain volumes to yearly highs.\n\nSolana\u2019s total value locked (TVL) across its network is also up, now at $1 billion compared to $300 million in September.\n\nAlthough, that jump is mostly attributed to the rising price of SOL; there\u2019s currently 14 million SOL locked on the network right now, one-third less than the 21 million SOL staked at the start of the year, and 25% less than in September.\n\nSolana almost closer than ever to flipping Ethereum\n\nIn any case, now that SOL seems set to stay ahead of XRP, some might wonder how far away it is from eclipsing BNB. The token is the native asset for Binance\u2019s blockchain network BNB Chain, and Binance users can also use it to cover trading fees and participation in initial coin offerings and the like.\n\nBNB faces its own set of challenges due to Binance\u2019s run-in with US regulators, which has resulted in mammoth fines, a years-long financial surveillance mandate and the exit of co-founder Changpeng Zhao as CEO.\n\nRead more: Binance says the SEC can\u2019t use DOJ plea deals as proof of guilt\n\nTurns out, outside of the last bull market\u2019s peak in late 2021, solana has never been closer to flipping BNB in their shared history. BNB\u2019s market cap is now just 20% more than SOL\u2019s, down drastically from 300% higher only three months ago.\n\nThe gap between Solana and Ethereum is still a long way off completely closing\n\nSolana\u2019s hopes of flipping Ethereum seem far less realistic right now. But there is progress: Ethereum\u2019s market value is now about 700% more than Solana\u2019s, its lowest point since peak bull market in 2021.\n\nETH was worth nearly 40 times more than Solana at the start of the year.\n\nSOL would still need to hit a price equal to more than twice its current all-time high, multiplying eight times to $625, to reach ETH\u2019s current valuation. Ethereum, of course, would have to stagnate the entire time.\n\nSo, if Solana flipping Ethereum were to happen at all, it would likely take multiple bull and bear cycles for Solana to properly narrow the gap.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Solana\u2019s DeFi DEX Volume Surpasses Ethereum\u2019s For the First Time\n\nSolana (SOL) has achieved a significant milestone by surpassing Ethereum (ETH) in terms of decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume over the past week. According to DefiLlama, DEX volume on Solana soared to $10.1 billion over the last seven days, while Ethereum recorded $8.8 billion in volume during the same period.\n\nSolana's recent surge in DEX activity can be attributed to its lower gas fees compared to Ethereum, and rise of memecoin trading. The chain\u2019s leading memecoin, BONK, dominated headlines after its meteoric rise to over a billion-dollar market capitalization, following Binance and Coinbase listings. Another Solana memecoin, Dogwifhat (WIF), has also captured attention, skyrocketing from obscurity to reach $322 million in market cap. BONK and WIF are among the top traded tokens on Solana DEXs over the past week, excluding stablecoins.\n\nThe success of these memecoins and heightened activity, coupled with major airdrops from protocols like Jito (JTO), have contributed to SOL's impressive rally, with the token flipping XRP and reaching a new 2023 high of $99, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nHowever, despite recent gains, SOL's market cap currently sits just above $41 billion, while Ethereum remains has a market cap of $268 billion, more than seven times larger than Solana.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "Ethereum is currently ranging around $2,200, with its price undergoing a calm volatility in the past 7 days. New data from Santiment has revealed the current sentiment among Ethereum whale addresses, as the total supply on exchanges recently hit a new low. According to the on-chain analytics platform, more than 240,000 ETH have left 10 of the biggest ETH exchange wallets in the past 24 hours.\n\nAs a result, the cumulative number of ETH deposited across crypto exchanges dropped from 8.03 million ETH to 7.79 million ETH in a single day, one of the largest it has ever seen. With the current price of ETH hovering around $2,200, this represents a drop of over $528 million worth of ETH in exchange balances.\n\nEthereum Exchange Supply Plummets\n\nEthereum is currently down by 1.74% in the past 24 hours and is currently retesting its breakout level of around $2,200 which seems to have turned into a support. However, the drastic drop in Ethereum balances on exchanges is a very bullish sign for ETH. With less ETH available on exchanges, supply is reduced.\n\nETH whales have been on a buying spree since the beginning of the month, as many look forward to an extended bull run at the dawn of the new year. Data from IntoTheBlock put a 98.52% increase in exchange outflow volume in the past 30 days. Just last week alone, whales bought more than 100,000 ETH worth $230 million.\n\nThis sentiment continued into this week, with 240,000 ETH leaving exchanges in 24 hours, leading to a 2.99% drop in coins held on exchanges. According to Santiment, only 8.07% of Ethereum\u2019s total supply currently sits on exchanges, the lowest it has ever been.\n\n\ud83d\udc4d As #Ethereum\u2018s market value hangs just above $2,170, the largest exchange wallets continue to move coins into smaller wallets or off exchanges entirely. 240K $ETH has been collectively moved from these wallets in 24 hours, a 2.99% drop in coins held. https://t.co/Fw7lKcVZan pic.twitter.com/AMFPDL4BXp \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 19, 2023\n\nETH has failed to clear the $2,250 price level, falling to $2,120 in the late hours of December 19. At the time of writing, ETH is now trading at $2,208. Price action suggests the crypto is still yet to gain strong traction among retail investors and is ongoing a retest.\n\nAccording to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Ethereum is bouncing around its breakout zone from an ascending triangle. If this consolidation continues, we could see a price range between $2,150 and $1,900 before a breakout to a target of $3,500.\n\n#Ethereum is currently retesting its breakout zone from an ascending triangle, hinting at preparation for a further climb. The price range between $2,150 and $1,900 could be the ideal zone for accumulation before #ETH sets its sights on a higher target of $3,500. pic.twitter.com/6lGZT0ZKgv \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) December 20, 2023\n\nEthereum is up by 82.67% this year and the outlook for 2024 remains bullish. According to crypto analyst Altcoin Daily, ETH\u2019s journey to $10,000 seems sure at the moment, pending Ethereum Spot ETFs a major catalyst for this price growth.\n\nETH bulls continue to maintain control | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Cointribune, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "MicroStockHub / iStock.com\n\nFollowing last year\u2019s disastrous landscape for the crypto ecosystem \u2014 a year marred by scandals, collapses, losses and lawsuits \u2014 2023 fared better. While the industry is still reeling from these developments, some assets have been slowly gaining ground.\n\nLost Money on Crypto in 2023? This Trick Could Help You Pay 0% Capital Gains Tax\n\nFind: 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\n\nIn turn, many experts argue that 2024 is off to a good start, with some cryptos poised to significantly progress. As of Dec. 20, the global cryptocurrency market cap was $1.72 trillion, according to CoinGecko.\n\nBitcoin\n\nPrice as of Dec. 20: $44,130\n\nPast year: up 160.9%\n\nYear-to-date: up 166.46%\n\nPast 30 days: up 17.8%\n\nAll-time high: $68,789.63 on Nov. 10, 2021\n\nMany experts are very bullish on Bitcoin for 2024 due to a combination of factors that could provide a perfect storm situation for the asset.\n\nAs David Waugh, lead analyst at Coinbits, explained, one significant development is the expected approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) in January- which could result- according to analysts from Galaxy Research- in $14.4 billion of institutional inflows into Bitcoin in the first year, exerting significant upward pressure on its price.\n\nAnother factor is that by the end of this year, Congress could also pass comprehensive crypto legislation providing the industry with much-needed regulatory clarity, making Bitcoin more attractive to banks \u2013 allowing banks to work with Bitcoin companies to enhance the services they can offer consumers, he said.\n\nFinally, another key catalyst is the Bitcoin halving event slated for April, which occurs once every four years and has always been associated with a massive price increase in the months before and after the event, according to Ric Edelman, founder, Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals.\n\n\u201cThe impact of these developments on bitcoin\u2019s price are expected to be substantial, with many predicting future bitcoin prices of $100,000 to $1.5 million,\u201d said Edelman. \u201cI\u2019m expecting Bitcoin\u2019s price to reach $150,000 by Dec 2025.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum\n\nPrice as of Dec. 20: $2,255\n\nPast year: up 84.7%\n\nYear-to-date: up 87.9%\n\nPast 30 days: up 10.3%\n\nAll-time high: $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021\n\nEther underperformed Bitcoin in 2023 with a gain of \u201conly\u201d 80%, trading roughly in line with its peer group in the smart contract platforms crypto sector, said Zach Pandl, Grayscale\u2018s managing director of research.\n\nPandl added that there has been extensive debate about Ethereum\u2019s competitive landscape as 2023 comes to a close, and he expects this to continue into 2024.\n\n\u201cGrayscale Research remains optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s outlook despite better performance from some other Smart Contract Platform tokens in 2023 (such as SOL or AVAX), as Ethereum network will go through an upgrade in the first quarter, that could support is \u201cmodular\u201d scaling plan,\u201d he said. Another driver could be any progress on the regulatory approval on spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. market, which could support token valuation, as well, he added.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP\n\nPrice as of Dec. 20: $0.621\n\nPast year: up 78.2%\n\nYear-to-date: up 84.25%\n\nPast 30 days: 0.00%\n\nAll-time high: Jan. 4, 2018, at $3.84\n\nAs Aaron Rafferty\u2019s CEO of StandardDAO and co-founder of BattlePACs, while XRP has increased significantly, it still remains 81.78% below its all-time high.\n\n\u201cWe have seen a turbulent albeit positive year with an SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) win and many acquisitions out of Ripple including toward real world asset tokenization,\u201d he said. \u201cExpect strong price trends for this payment rail.\u201d\n\nChainlink\n\nPrice as of Dec. 20: $14.66\n\nPast year: up 142%\n\nYear-to-date: up 164.85%\n\nPast 30 days: down 3.3%\n\nAll-time high: May 9, 2021, at $52.88\n\nAccording to Rafferty, the year-to-date rise demonstrates robust growth potential, standing 74% below its peak.\n\n\u201cPast bull run gains were 1400%+ and typically run prior to other players,\u201d he said. \u201cLINK\u2019s expansion into enterprise solutions, including collaborations with major players like Google, SWIFT, and Oracle, provides a vital security layer between blockchains and real-world data.\u201d\n\nOther Assets and Trends\n\nLee Taylor, the founder of MonarchX, said that in addition to Chainlink, if you\u2019re looking for the unicorn altcoins of 2024, I think Solana, Avalanche and Algorand should be top performers.\n\n\u201cALGO, which features low costs, is particularly well-suited to content creators. While seeing a dip earlier this year, it is up a whopping 38% over the past month, and it should continue to see high growth into 2024,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, AVAX is in a similar position, up over 75% in the past month alone. It is likely that these unicorns are well-positioned to see 100% growth over the next year.\n\nBitcoin-related assets, which have been on a roll lately, are also something worth watching, according to several experts.\n\nFor instance, \u201cOrdinals\u201d -NFTs on Bitcoin- or, as Decrypt explained, \u201cdigital assets inscribed on a satoshi, the lowest denomination of a Bitcoin,\u201d have garnered a lot of interest lately.\n\nNow, whether they have staying power remains to be seen, according to Grayscale\u2019s Pandl.\n\nAccording to Austin Alexander, co-founder of LayerTwo Labs, building on Bitcoin-related assets and networks is a big trend in the coming year.\n\n\u201cThere are many people who had never touched Bitcoin \u2013 they\u2019re altcoiners \u2013 who are now getting into Bitcoin because of Ordinals and other related assets,\u201d he said. \u201cBitcoin has the most liquidity of any decentralized network, and it\u2019s also the most secure, so this all makes BTC more desirable. Bitcoin\u2019s network effects are powerful, and I think we\u2019ll see the broader Bitcoin ecosystem flourish in the year ahead.\u201d\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Why Bitcoin, Ethereum and 2 More Cryptos Are Poised To Boom in 2024"

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin \u2014 the co-founder of the blockchain that unleashed smart contracts on the world \u2014 has seen tens of millions worth of holdings evaporate from his portfolio in mere days.\n\nAccording to data provided by blockchain analytics service Arkham Intelligence, Buterin\u2019s publicly-known crypto wallets became about $29 million lighter in the six days from Dec. 15 to Dec. 21. This means that the wallets cumulatively lost about 5% of their total value as the price of the assets they held fell from $572 million down to $543 million.\n\nButerin puts his money where his mouth is\n\nOut of the current $543 million held in the wallets, the near totality is Ethereum (ETH). The two top assets other than ETH are Kyber Network (KNC) with $623,000 and Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) with $431,000.\n\nAs a result of this portfolio nearly completely comprised of Ethereum, Buterin is very exposed to the fluctuation in the price of the cryptocurrency that he helped create. On Dec. 15, ETH reached a high of just under $2,300 \u2014 which accounts for much of its fall of over 4% towards its current price of just over $2,200.\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin NFT collection triggers surge in Ethereum gas fees\n\nWho is Vitalik Buterin\n\nVitalik Buterin is a Russian-Canadian programmer and writer known primarily for his contribution to the creation of Ethereum. He co-founded Bitcoin Magazine, a widely known Bitcoin-focused online publication that started publishing in 2012.\n\nAfter observing some of what he perceived as limitations of the Bitcoin network, Buterin published a white paper in 2014 proposing Ethereum \u2014 a blockchain-based distributed computing platform that could support smart contract functionality. Ethereum launched in 2015, with Buterin playing a key role as the project\u2019s co-founder.\n\nSince then, Ethereum has become the second-largest cryptocurrency platform, second only to Bitcoin in market capitalization.

        "content": "Ethereum bulls have been forced to defend against a wave of slander on Crypto X after some critics noticed the price of Ether (ETH) has been lagging against Bitcoin (BTC) and other strong-performing altcoins as of late.\n\nThe Ethereum to Bitcoin price chart \u2014 a measure of 1 Ether against 1 Bitcoin, temporarily fell below 0.05 BTC on Dec. 20, its lowest level in two years (since April 28, 2021), according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nDuring the last bull market, the ratio went up to a peak of 0.087 BTC on Sept. 12, 2021, but has trended downward since. At the start of 2023, the ratio sat around 0.072 but has also fallen since then.\n\nETH/BTC price chart over the last 12 months. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nCritics on social media appear to be pointing the finger at Ethereum\u2019s transaction fees, which they say have made it more enticing for crypto users to try competitor chains with lower fees.\n\n\u201cEthereum is broken. You don\u2019t have to pay those fees anymore. You have options,\u201d said Bitcoin proponent Jason A. Williams on Dec. 20.\n\nData from BitInfoCharts shows that fees on Ethereum averaged out at around $11 on Dec. 19, though Bitcoin fees are still pricier at approximately $32. On the other hand, Solana\u2019s fees are consistently under $0.01, according to CoinCodex.\n\nEven Vitalik Buterin, one of the creators of Ethereum, recently said Ethereum will ultimately \u201cfail\u201d unless transaction fees become cheaper, particularly during bull markets.\n\nBut other Ethereum bulls have been quick to come to its defense.\n\nAnthony Sassano, host of the Ethereum show The Daily Gwei was adamant Ethereum is undervalued in the current market, while Bankless co-host Ryan Sean Adams said he\u2019s \u201cgobsmacked\u201d at the negative sentiment he\u2019s seen on Ethereum:\n\n\u201cI never anticipated ETH would be viewed as non-consensus underdog again, yet here we are. Long ETH 2024.\"\n\nRelated: Solana price technicals hint at 40% crash by New Year\u2019s\n\nMeanwhile, Solana (SOL) bulls have also been quick to note that the price of SOL has been performing well against other cryptocurrencies including Ether, particularly over the last three months. SOL is up 12% to $83 over the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nSOL/ ETH price chart over the last month. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nOther pundits have pointed to Solana overtaking Ethereum in decentralized exchange (DEX), stablecoin and nonfungible token (NFT) trading volumes over both 24-hour and seven-day intervals this week, with the recent price action prompting others to even suggest that Solana will \u201cflip\u201d Ethereum one day.\n\nSolana absolutely ripping.

Mcap/TVL is a commonly used metric to measure a blockchain\u2019s intrinsic value.\n\nAs Ethereum\u2019s value is lower, it could suggest it is undervalued (relative to Solana).\n\nI'm honestly in disbelief with how undervalued ETH is right now and how it's somehow become a non-consensus bet.\n\n\n\nNo matter - I can keep buying ETH longer than the market can stay retarded. \u2014 sassal.eth/acc (@sassal0x) December 19, 2023\n\nMagazine: This is your brain on crypto \u2014 Substance abuse grows among crypto traders"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s forthcoming upgrade, \u201cCancun-Deneb\u201d (also known as \u201cDencun\u201d), will begin testing on Jan. 17, according to a note published on the official Ethereum GitHub repository. The upgrade will first be applied to the Goerli testnet, then added to Sepolia on Jan. 30 and Holesky on Feb. 7. The Ethereum team has yet to announce when Dencun will be implemented on the mainnet.\n\nThe new upgrade includes several tools intended to reduce fees, allow for new features of bridges and staking pools, and limit the use of self-destruct operations on smart contracts.\n\nAccording to its developer documents, Dencun will contain Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, also known as \u201cproto-danksharding.\u201d This will allow layer-2 rollup networks such as Arbitrum, Base, Polygon zkEVM and others to store certain transaction data temporarily, using a new format called \u201cblobs.\u201d Blobs can be deleted after 18 days, whereas the current practice is to include the data in the \u201cCALLDATA\u201d field and keep it on the blockchain forever. Ethereum developers believe that proto-danksharding will significantly reduce transaction fees on layer 2s.\n\nRelated: Ethereum\u2019s proto-danksharding to make rollups 10x cheaper \u2014 Consensys\n\nThe upgrade also contains several other proposals, including EIP-1153, which introduces a \u201ctransient storage\u201d system to further reduce fees, as well as EIP-4788, which increases transparency by storing the root of each Beacon Chain block in a smart contract that can be queried by applications. Developers expect the data provided by EIP-4788 to be used in new features for bridges and staking pools.\n\nIn addition, Dencun contains EIP-6780, a proposal to limit the use of the self-destruct keyword. If embedded within a contract before deployment, self-destructs can currently be used to erase the code for a smart contract and send all of its funds to the account that deployed it. After Dencun, this keyword will not erase the code unless it is called within the same transaction in which it was deployed. However, the keyword will still transfer all funds to the deployer, even if it is called in a future transaction.\n\nEthereum upgrades usually undergo testing for a few months before being deployed to the mainnet. The previous deployment, codenamed \u201cShapella,\u201d began testing on Feb. 7. It was launched to mainnet on April 12."

        "content": "A passionate cryptocurrency and blockchain author qualified to cover every event in the crypto space. Researching minute occurrences and bringing new insights lie within the prime focus of my task.\n\nAfter consolidating below $2000 for the first three quarters, the Ethereum price triggered a massive jump after hitting the lows below $1600. This caused the price to soar by over 55%, which began at the beginning of November, reaching a high close to $2400. This jump was believed to be the start of a fresh bullish run, intending to form a new ATH beyond $5000. However, the correction that followed the ETH price is displaying the possibility of offering a buy at the dip moment very soon.\n\nThe recent drop now indicates the price is all set to plunge by another 5% to 6% in the coming days. The trend is descending, heading towards the lower support close to $2000, offering another entry for the long trades. The volume profile of the previous consolidation structure is around $2053, which is a point of control where most of the contracts were traded. The markets usually react to these types of levels very strongly; hence, a bounce could be expected.\n\nThe bears are trying hard to outperform the bulls by exercising extensive upward pressure. The rally is now forming constant lower highs and lows, indicating the growing strength among the bears as the selling pressure accumulates. Also, the price has dropped below the elevating trend line that has been acting as a strong support in recent times. Furthermore, the bears thwarted a new attempt to rise above these levels.\n\nAdding more substance, the RSI is failing constantly to rise above average levels, suggesting the weakness piling up among the bulls. This could hamper the progress of the rally, which has already been flashing bearish signals. The ETH price is trying hard to rise above the crucial trend line, but if the bulls fail to do so, a fresh bearish wave may drag it lower towards support.\n\nHowever, the bulls may quickly jump into finding the token within the liquidity range, but if they manage to break above the upper resistance in the next few days, the bearish scenario may be invalidated. In such a case, the Ethereum price target for 2023 could be beyond $2,450 to $2,500."

        "content": "Crypto analyst and trader Ali Martinez says that the leading smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH) is setting the stage for an explosive rally.\n\nMartinez tells his 36,600 followers on the social media platform X that ETH could increase by more than 60% from its current value after a period of accumulation when people start to increasingly purchase the asset.\n\n\u201cEthereum is currently retesting its breakout zone from an ascending triangle, hinting at preparation for a further climb.

        "title": "Top Altcoins To Buy On December 20: Ethereum Express (ETE), BONK, Stacks (STX) - CoinGape",
        "content": "Investors are sifting through the noise to identify gems that are likely to significantly breakout ahead of Christmas and New Year celebrations. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) stand out as the most stable investments in a crypto portfolio, select best-performing top altcoins could be the game changer, considering the gains posted by Ethereum Express (ETH), Bonk (BONK) and Stacks (STX).\n\nAlthough the crypto market widely reversed gains accrued last week from Friday through to Monday, the anticipation of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) approval in January has helped to steady the prices and may explain the 3% increase in market cap to $1.66 trillion, live data by CoinMarketCap shows.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Express Tops Top Altcoins To Buy For 2024\n\nEthereum Express (ETE) is slowly catching investor interest, as one of the most viable tokens that could potentially break out this week. Up 8% in the last 24 hours, the crypto powering the network known for faster, safer, and cheaper layer 1 transactions, is trading at $0.0413.\n\nLike other cryptos, Ethereum Express encountered strong headwinds last week, forcing bulls to temporarily abandon the push for the uptrend at $0.043. A correction followed swiftly, as traders closed positions to protect their capital and accrued gains.\n\nThe first tentative support at $0.03 failed to relieve the selling pressure but ETE respected the next crucial level slightly above $0.021. This support area encouraged traders to enter new long positions, boosting Ethereum Express recovery.\n\nA cup and handle pattern drawn on the four-hour chart reveals a potential 71% breakout to $0.07. However, ETE must rise above the neckline resistance at $0.0413 to validate the breakout.\n\nBased on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator a stronger momentum backs the uptrend in ETE. Therefore, traders considering more exposure, could long Ethereum Express as soon as it breaks or successfully retests the neckline resistance.\n\nBonk Pauses Price Discovery, Here\u2019s What Next\n\nInvestors who bought Bonk to speculate on exchange listings on Coinbase and Binance last week have been selling to lock in the profits made. This has continued to weigh down on the meme coin built on the Solana blockchain, with losses extending from a recent all-time high of $0.000035 to $0.000019, down 1.4% in 24 hours.\n\nDespite the meltdown, Bonk upholds a 160% increase in a fortnight and 445% in a month.\n\nThe outlook from the MACD reinforces the bearish theory. Meanwhile, all eyes are on the confluence support created by the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (in red) and the purple horizontal ray at $0.00001891 to trigger another buying spree and boost Bonk\u2019s recovery back to the ATH.\n\nIf the downtrend carries on below the highlighted immediate support, traders may want to consider entering short positions in BONK and targeting lower support areas at $0.000016, $0.000013, and the 200 EMA (in purple) at $0.0000109.\n\nOn the other side of the fence, Bonk may resume the uptrend quickly if the confluence support holds and a breakout follows above the descending channel. While Bonk is still one of the best crypto performers in December, finding a good entry position is the tricky part.\n\nStacks Price Prediction: Will STX Validate Cup and Handle Breakout?\n\nStacks price extended the up leg on Tuesday with another 1.5% increase in 24 hours in addition to a 22% growth in seven days and an 87% rise in a month. The token native to one of Bitcoin\u2019s most reliable smart contracts layer, allowing developers to build apps is trading at $1.19 after running into resistance at $1.26.\n\nWith a short-term cup and handle likely to lead to another breakout, the headache investors have is finding a suitable entry position. However, if STX breaks above the neckline resistance at $1.19, the next breakout could rise 30% to $1.82.\n\nFor now, the path with the least resistance based on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is downwards. Bears have the upper hand, especially with Stacks trading below a broken support \u2014 now resistance at $1.2.\n\nIf declines continue in the handle section of the pattern, traders may want to spot other tentative support areas, starting with the 20 EMA at $1.12, the buyer congestion at $1.1, and the 200 EMA at $0.895.\n\nRelated Articles"

Crypto analyst Ali, known for insightful market observations, recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to share an optimistic outlook for Ethereum's price trajectory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#Ethereum is currently retesting its breakout zone from an ascending triangle, hinting at preparation for a further climb.\n\n\n\nThe price range between $2,150 and $1,900 could be the ideal zone for accumulation before #ETH sets its sights on a higher target of $3,500. pic.twitter.com/6lGZT0ZKgv \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) December 20, 2023\n\nAccording to Ali's tweet, ETH is presently in the process of retesting its breakout zone from an ascending triangle, suggesting a potential setup for significant upward movement. The analyst pointed to a specific price range, indicating that the zone between $2,150 and $1,900 could serve as an ideal area for accumulation before Ethereum aims for a higher target of $3,500.\n\nAs of the latest market data , Ethereum is currently trading at $2,218. Despite experiencing a marginal 1.05% dip in the last 24 hours, the cryptocurrency has shown remarkable resilience over the past month, boasting a notable 9.51% increase. This positive trend has captured the attention of investors and analysts who are closely monitoring Ethereum's movements in anticipation of a potential breakout.\n\nBullish continuation pattern\n\nThe ascending triangle pattern, often considered a bullish continuation pattern in technical analysis, suggests that ETH might be gearing up for sustained upward movement. Traders and investors are keenly observing key support and resistance levels within the mentioned price range, as they play a crucial role in determining the cryptocurrency's next move .\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has been characterized by heightened volatility in recent months, with Ethereum being a focal point for many traders. The potential breakout to $3,500, as suggested by analyst Ali, could signify a significant bullish sentiment and attract further interest from the broader market."

        "content": "Shiba Inu lead developer Shytoshi Kusama calls the broader crypto community to join SHIB\u2019s move for authentic domain naming and digital identities.\n\nThe enigmatic leader of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, Shytoshi Kusama, has invited the Ethereum community to support Shiba Inu\u2019s latest groundbreaking move related to top-level domain (TLD) extension.\n\nFor context, Shiba Inu has taken steps to be the first Web3 project to secure a top-level domain. The initiative involves creating a \u201c.shib\u201d TLD, enabling users to register distinct names for worldwide recognition within the domain name system.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe Shiba Inu team disclosed the initiative in its seventh edition of the Shib Magazine, published in the last 24 hours.\n\nGiven the pioneering nature of the endeavor, Kusama took to X to extend an invitation to the Ethereum community.\n\nNote that members of the Ethereum community currently use the \u201c.eth\u201d name tag, although their \u201c.eth\u201d extension does not resolve in all standard web browsers, since it is not a top-level domain.\n\nTagging Nick Johnson, the architect and lead developer of Ethereum Name Service (ENS), the Shiba Inu ecosystem leader remarked:\n\n\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cI hope you and the rest of the Ethereum family will support our charge!\u201d\n\n@nicksdjohnson so uhm\u2026 I hope you and the rest of the eth family will support our charge ! \u2014 Shytoshi Kusama\u2122 (@ShytoshiKusama) December 19, 2023\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s Coming TLD\n\nThe coming \u201c.shib\u201d domain extension will be unlike the ones in the crypto sphere, such as the \u201c.eth,\u201d which merely facilitates decentralized naming for wallet addresses.\n\nSpecifically, \u201c.eth\u201d aids in identifying Ethereum addresses in a human-readable format. This eliminates the need for users to memorize long strings of digits and letters when sharing their wallet information or receiving Ethereum tokens.\n\nHowever, the Shiba Inu ecosystem is pushing the boundaries of functionality even further. Shiba Inu has joined forces with D3 Global, a prominent domain firm, to pursue this ambitious objective.\n\nD3 Global specializes in bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3. Emphatically, through this collaboration with Shiba Inu, D3 Global will introduce digital identities for Shiba Inu enthusiasts under the \u201c.shib\u201d name.\n\nIt will provide users with a practical domain to access the advantages of Web3, including enhanced security, privacy, and interoperability."

Specifically, the current data presented shows that new Ethereum addresses soared to a higher high as of December 19.\n\nNew addresses entering a network hint at a growing interest in accumulation, a trend that might ultimately boost the price of the asset in question.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nDespite the inherent Ethereum FUD induced by Peter Brandt, after weeks of range-bound motion, Martinez is optimistic that this growing network activity could set the stage for ETH to resume its upward trajectory in the near term.\n\nEthereum Retesting Breakout Zone\n\nPer the charts, new addresses entering the Ethereum network have soared to their highest level since October 16. The current level represents the second major spike recorded within the network since the uptick recorded on November 20.\n\nThis ongoing network activity coincides with the point ETH bulls are making an effort to revive the price of the coin.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum changes hands at $2,234.32, up 1.32% in the past 24 hours.

If the accumulation scenario plays out, ETH might be on its way to the ultimate target of $3,500.\n\nEthereum and Market Influence\n\nWhile the current Ethereum on-chain data shows the second-largest digital currency has all it takes to pull a dramatic bullish run, market sentiment might stall this current optimism.\n\nDespite the Ethereum spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) sentiment in the market, the ripple effect of Bitcoin\u2019s instability is impacting ETH\u2019s performance in no small measure. While the broader crypto ecosystem is currently in a recovery mode, traders tracking ETH for the longer term may keep an eye on market dynamics."

        "content": "Sentiment over Ethereum has waned in recent weeks as Bitcoin took the limelight with a push to a new 2023 high.\n\nMoreover, rival blockchains such as Solana and Avalanche are gaining traction, with token price gains outpacing ETH.\n\nOn Dec. 21, Glassnode analyst \u201cCheckmatey\u201d opined that the decline in the market cap ratio between ETH and BTC might only be halfway.\n\nHe made the case that Bitcoin is likely to continue increasing its dominance relative to Ethereum.\n\nEthereum Sentiment Weakens\n\nMoreover, across derivatives markets, Bitcoin dominance continues to grow relative to Ethereum, he noted, adding that it is now in 70% territory.\n\nA monthly change in realized market capitalization shows much larger capital inflows for Bitcoin at $13.8 billion per month compared to just $6 billion for Ethereum.\n\n\u201cThis suggests Bitcoin is seeing stronger buyer demand,\u201d he said.\n\nIf history is any guide, the decline in market cap ratio between $ETH and $BTC may only be half-way\u2026 Below is a \ud83e\uddf5 covering a few different measures of market dominance between #Bitcoin and #Ethereum, which paints a case for continuation, not reversal.https://t.co/RiPVkb7zoF pic.twitter.com/x0Wa1tldmm \u2014 _Check\u0271ate \ud83d\udfe0\ud83d\udd11\u26a1\u2622\ufe0f\ud83d\udee2\ufe0f (@_Checkmatey_) December 20, 2023\n\nHe also noted that Ethereum\u2019s realized market cap remains overvalued compared to Bitcoin. As ETH holders capitulate and sell at a loss, locking in lower prices, Ethereum\u2019s realized cap will drop further.\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin tends to recover faster than Ethereum after drawdowns in realized market cap. Exchange flow metrics also show Bitcoin commands over 75% dominance in transfer activity.\n\nIt is not all doom and gloom for the world\u2019s second-largest crypto asset, however, and these sentiment lulls happen every cycle. On Dec. 21, Ethereum advocate Anthony Sassano commented on this:\n\n\u201cSeems like we\u2019ve finally reached the \u201cdeath of ETH party\u201d phase of the cycle. Just bought more ETH to celebrate.\u201d\n\nFellow Etherean Ryan Sean Adams said he was \u201cgobsmacked\u201d by all the negativity for ETH.\n\n\u201cI never anticipated ETH would be viewed as a non-consensus underdog again, yet here we are,\u201d he said.\n\nFundamentally, Ethereum is as strong as ever, as detailed by Sassano earlier this week.\n\nETH Prices Remain Flat\n\nEthereum prices have been flat for most of the past week, seesawing between $2,150 and $2,250. It has gained 83% since the beginning of this year, however, which is not bad for a dead coin.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum was changing hands for around $2,200, having gained 9% over the past 30 days."

        "content": "Solana (SOL) is extending its breakthrough for the year as its record-breaking transaction volume exceeds that of Ethereum (ETH) on key trading platforms.\n\nThe intriguing performance of Solana has placed the cryptocurrency on the radar of most traders. At press time, the digital currency soared as high as 12.23% in the past 24 hours to $87.18. In tandem, Solana\u2019s market capitalization has jumped by more than 12% to $37,245,046,339, as the 24-hour trading volume recorded a 100% jump to $4,455,508,322.\n\nWith the current outlook, Solana has now surpassed XRP in market capitalization, as the latter is now worth just $33,431,974,071.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSolana Outranking Ethereum\n\nAccording to insights from Kaiko Researcher Riyad Carey, Solana\u2019s trading volume on Upbit has surpassed that of Ethereum for 55 consecutive days. The same trend surfaced on MEXC, where Ethereum\u2019s volume has lagged behind Solana\u2019s for 15 days straight.\n\nKraken and Coinbase Global Inc are not left behind, with Solana outpacing Ethereum for 9 days out of the past 14 on the former and 3 of the past 13 days on the latter. This impressive performance has also rubbed off on the differentials in the price of the two assets,\n\nSOL has done more volume than ETH: 9 out of the last 14 days on Kraken\n\n3 out of the last 13 days on Coinbase\n\nThe last 15 days straight on MEXC\n\nThe last 55 days straight on Upbit The @blknoiz06 Effect pic.twitter.com/c4LLsX24ya \u2014 Riyad Carey (@riyad_carey) December 20, 2023\n\nWhile Solana has jumped by 345% in the past 3 months, Ethereum has only managed to grow by 40% within the same period. With the growing debate about Ethereum and Solana, by all metrics, the latter is winning as a high-performance outfit, however, its market capitalization is a fraction of the $270,614,040,135 that Ethereum boasts of.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe Solana Advantage\n\nAs blockchain networks with established developer ecosystems, it is worth noting that both Ethereum and Solana have robust developmental activity at this time. The shift in embrace, however, is based on sentiments that most traders are nursing at times.\n\nWhile Shiba Inu (SHIB) and other Ethereum-based memecoins have helped elevate the status of the blockchain in times past, investors are now more gravitating to BONK, the sensational memecoin built on Solana. The debut of an airdrop for BONK and Solana Mobile phone owners has also driven sentiment through the roof in recent times.\n\nBesides the influence of BONK, the fact that all fears related to the liquidation of SOL as a major asset owned by bankrupt FTX Exchange have been allayed is further giving investors the confidence to go all out on the coin. For its ecosystem potential, top firms like VanEck have tipped Solana to hit a high price target of $3,211 before the end of this decade."

        "content": "Ethereum Will Continue Losing Ground To Bitcoin: Glassnode\n\nThe price of Ethereum (ETH) has continuously lost ground to that of its older brother, Bitcoin (BTC), throughout the year \u2013 and on-chain data suggests it will continue to do so.\n\nAs of Thursday, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap dominance stood at 53.3%, versus Ethereum\u2019s 16.7%. A day prior, the ETH/BTC price ratio briefly fell below 0.05, its lowest value since April 2021.\n\nAccording to lead on-chain Glassnode analyst James Check, various other measures of market dominance between both top cryptocurrencies paint \u201ca case for continuation, not reversal\u201d of Ethereum\u2019s waning relative interest.\n\n\u201cAcross both futures and options derivatives markets, Bitcoin dominance continues to grow relative to Ethereum, pushing well above 60% and now into 70% territory,\u201d he explained in an X thread on Wednesday.\n\nIf history is any guide, the decline in market cap ratio between $ETH and $BTC may only be half-way\u2026 Below is a \ud83e\uddf5 covering a few different measures of market dominance between #Bitcoin and #Ethereum, which paints a case for continuation, not reversal.https://t.co/RiPVkb7zoF pic.twitter.com/x0Wa1tldmm \u2014 _Check\u0271ate \ud83d\udd11\u26a1\ud83c\udf0b\u2622\ufe0f\ud83d\udee2\ufe0f (@_Checkmatey_) December 20, 2023\n\nWhile volume in perpetual futures contracts for each asset reached parity 12 months ago, volume has since diverged into a 70/30 split in Bitcoin\u2019s favor.\n\nMuch the same can be said of both options volume and open interest, which have slowly moved towards Bitcoin since the start of the year.\n\nCheck also noted that ETH still appears \u201cquite overvalued\u201d next to BTC by realized cap \u2013 the market cap of ETH based on the price at which all coins were last moved.\n\nFor this to change, long-term ETH holders will need to sell their coins at a loss, and Bitcoin capital inflows will need to exceed Ethereum. \u201cThe capital rotation by this metric appears to be early in the trend,\u201d said Check.\n\nOver the past month, the 30-day change in realized cap shows less capital flowing into Ethereum ($6 billion) versus Bitcoin ($13.8 billion) or even stablecoins, which are viewed as a proxy for the broader altcoin market.\n\nFinally, Bitcoin is dominant when it comes to spot trading volume, dominating 75% of exchange flows between the two assets.\n\n\u201cBitcoin trading activity always moves first, often dominating beyond new market ATHs before ETH sees much of an activity pickup,\u201d concluded Check. \u201cThe king remains the king.\u201d\n\nBTC is now up 162% year to date, while ETH is up 82%. Even rival altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) are dwarfing gains made by crypto\u2019s number 2 this year, both rising 77% and 69% respectively over the past month alone, versus ETH\u2019s 13%.\n\nEven Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, was found moving $1 million of his ETH holdings to an exchange earlier this month."

        "content": "Wed 20 Dec 2023 \u25aa 4 min of reading \u25aa by Evans S.\n\nEthereum, traditionally perceived as a pillar of reliability and innovation in the crypto universe, is facing a potential reputation crisis. Recent revelations by Lane Rettig, a former lead developer, have shaken the foundation of this perception. He claimed that over two-thirds of Ethereum tokens were acquired during a controversial pre-mining. These statements raise questions about the transparency and integrity of the Ethereum blockchain, prompting deep inquiries.\n\nA Controversial Pre-mining Subject\n\nAccording to Rettig, about 70% of Ethereum tokens were pre-mined before the cryptocurrency was even accessible to the public.\n\nThis strategy is normally aimed at regulating the distribution of a new currency. However, in this case, it reached an extreme level. As a result, a limited circle of insiders now holds the majority of the tokens.\n\nThis practice raises questions about the fairness of the token distribution and the overall transparency of the process. For a technology touted for its decentralization and openness, these revelations could tarnish the reputation of Ethereum crypto and shake the confidence of investors and users.\n\nAnother concerning aspect revealed by Rettig is the concentration of wealth within Ethereum. A very small number of anonymous individuals hold a significant portion of the total supply of ETH. This situation creates an imbalance of power and goes against the ideal of decentralization of the blockchain.\n\nThese \u201cwhales\u201d of Ethereum, operating in the shadows, could have a disproportionate influence on the market, raising concerns about potential price manipulation and the overall health of the crypto ecosystem.\n\nImplications and Reactions from the Crypto Community\n\nThe revelation of these practices has ignited a heated debate in the crypto community. Ethereum supporters are forced to reconsider their stance, while critics feel vindicated in their doubts about the management of the blockchain.\n\nThese allegations, casting a shadow over Ethereum, forcefully remind us that in the crypto universe, transparency and fairness are not just ideals, but imperative necessities.\n\nFaced with these upheavals, the crypto market finds itself at a crossroads, swinging between skepticism and hope. Restoring trust becomes a major challenge. Will Ethereum manage to clear the clouds of doubt, or are the cracks in its foundations irreparable?\n\nThis controversial episode questions not only the integrity of Ethereum but also the fundamental principles of the crypto industry. As reactions and speculations abound, a crucial lesson emerges: not to blindly accept apparent truths, but to seek clarity behind statements and promises.\n\nEthereum, at a crossroads, must now demonstrate its ability to navigate this storm of indignation, in search of redemption that will redefine its place in the constantly evolving world of crypto. Meanwhile, Solana breaks records and challenges Ethereum.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

Discover SCENE\n\nAfter accelerating for weeks, momentum in the Solana ecosystem has finally accomplished the improbable: Transaction volume for decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on the blockchain has finally eclipsed that of exchanges on rival Ethereum, at least in the last week.\n\nDEX volume on Solana has soared to $9.03 billion over the last seven days, according to data from Defi Llama. In that same period, decentralized exchanges on Ethereum have seen $8.836 billion worth of transactions.\n\nThat victory may end up short-lived, as Ethereum is already edging out Solana in DEX volume over the last 24 hours, but it is nonetheless significant. Decentralized exchanges\u2014such as Uniswap on Ethereum and Orca on Solana\u2014facilitate the peer-to-peer exchange of all sorts of cryptocurrencies, particularly meme coins that aren\u2019t listed on centralized exchanges. Historically, the lion\u2019s share of that trading has always been concentrated on Ethereum.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut recently, DEX activity on Solana has surged, in large part thanks to the network\u2019s lower gas fees. Solana meme coin BONK dominated crypto discourse for weeks after soaring from humble origins to a staggering billion-dollar market capitalization.\n\nThen, earlier this week, the ecosystem found another gem in Dogwifhat (WIF), another dog-themed Solana coin that\u2019s skyrocketed an astounding 376,000% since launching a month ago. On Thursday, the coin briefly pushed past a $250 million market capitalization, before settling back down to $204 million, according to CoinGecko.\n\nBlockchain data aggregated by Dune from some of the top Solana decentralized exchanges shows that BONK and WIF are among the top traded tokens over the past week, outside of stablecoins.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the meantime, SOL has continued to surge off the network\u2019s good fortunes, flipping XRP on Wednesday and breaking another record for 2023 by topping $80. At writing, SOL is up higher still: above $89, according to CoinGecko.\n\nSolana users hailed these developments, along with other promising signs from the Solana NFT ecosystem, as evidence that the blockchain\u2019s time had finally come.\n\nSolana in the last 24 hours: - Flipped ETH in DEX Volume (First Time Ever)\n\n- Has 5% of TVL, proves it is a worthless metric\n\n- Jupiter flips Uniswap by Volume\n\n- 4 out of 10 Top DEX are from Solana\n\n- Solana doing 100% more NFT Volume than Ethereum\n\n- Tensor flips Blur It's over. \u2014 Gumshoe (@0xGumshoe) December 16, 2023\n\nETH influencers turning into SOL influencers right now: pic.twitter.com/1faz9h86qj \u2014 MinisterOfNFTs \ud83d\udd2e (@MinisterOfNFTs) December 20, 2023\n\nBut by other metrics, the chain still has a long way to go. Even with recent gains, SOL's market capitalization sits just above $37 billion. Ethereum is over seven times larger, at its current market cap of $268 billion.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

Data indicates that Solana's trading volume has reached $1.262 billion, marginally surpassing Ethereum's $1.167 billion. Arbitrum, BSC, and Avalanche follow behind.\n\nThis development marks yet another significant milestone for Solana since Ethereum has long been considered the dominant force in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.\n\nAnalyzing the top chains by trading volume\n\nThe landscape of DEX trading is fiercely competitive, with various blockchains vying for the top spot.\n\nSolana's recent surge to the forefront is attributed to several factors, including the total value locked (TVL) on its platform, which has topped $1 billion for the first time since the FTX collapse in November last year.\n\nThis resurgence has been driven by rising asset prices and consistent inflows to DeFi protocols.\n\nDecentralized exchanges on Solana, such as Orca, have seen remarkable increases in trading volume.\n\nSolana's market cap surpasses XRP\n\nFurther cementing its position in the cryptocurrency market, Solana's market capitalization has now outstripped that of XRP.\n\nAt the time of reporting, Solana's market cap stands at $35.42 billion. In contrast, XRP's market cap is slightly behind at $33.74 billion.\n\nSolana's recent performance can be partly attributed to the rise of meme coins like Bonk, a dog-themed token that now boasts a market cap of more than $1.2 billion. The speculative frenzy surrounding meme coins has played a significant role in the recent rally."

However, Litecoin brings a few unique traits of its own. Among its distinguishing features is a finite supply of 84 million coins compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 21 million.\n\nThe cryptocurrency can also be mined up to four times faster than Bitcoin, which means that transactions settle faster because the process of mining involves verifying transactions and adding them to the cryptocurrency\u2019s ledger. Litecoin is often referred to as the cryptocurrency equivalent of silver (Bitcoin is gold). As such, Litecoin often targets smaller transactions.\n\nHowever, both Bitcoin and Litecoin can be subdivided up to eight decimal places. In today\u2019s transactions, the smallest units are not currently in wide use. If or when the value of these cryptocurrencies increases well beyond their current values, the smaller increments will become more useful. Litecoin uses SegWit (Segregated Witness), a technology that allows more transactions within a block, which speeds up the processing time for individual transactions. Slow transaction completion times have been one of the leading criticisms of Bitcoin compared to alternatives.\n\nLitecoin can't yet support smart contracts, which are computer programs that live on the cryptocurrency\u2019s blockchain and govern transactions or perform other functions. Active development for smart contracts is centered on Ethereum.\n\nEndurance\n\nSince Bitcoin was invented in 2009, many cryptocurrencies have come and gone but Litecoin\u2019s endurance may speak to its future longevity.\n\nGovernment regulation of currencies or bans are also a concern. The fact that Litecoin has survived this long (since October 2011) and that it is one of the few currencies that has been available on the highly-selective Coinbase exchange could indicate a better future than other altcoins.\n\nA potential risk of owning Litecoin is that one of its main selling features, SegWit, a method of shrinking transaction sizes, is being considered for Bitcoin as well, which would eliminate a significant advantage of Litecoin. However, SegWit has been a topic of spirited discussion within the Bitcoin community for years and may never be added to Bitcoin.\n\nLike many cryptocurrencies, Litecoin enjoyed a massive runup in price at the end of 2017 and into early 2018. Prices have fallen since that time but remain substantially higher than early 2017 levels.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum was the brainchild of Toronto programmer and Bitcoin enthusiast Vitalik Buterin. In 2013, he released a white paper about Ethereum, detailing the potential uses of an alternative blockchain technology that could work as both a financial instrument and decentralized platform for developers to build applications.\n\nMore developers joined ranks and Ethereum had momentum and a growing community of high-tech enthusiasts. By 2015, Ether was a live cryptocurrency powering the Ethereum blockchain. Since its beginnings just a few years ago, ETH has grown into the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nBitcoin was built as a cryptocurrency platform. Ethereum is a decentralized application platform \u2014 one that also hosts a cryptocurrency, a fuel for the network. The difference may seem like semantics, but the distinction is a large part of why Ethereum has had such wide adoption in such a short amount of time.\n\nEthereum\u2019s smart contracts are code that lives and executes on the blockchain and can facilitate monetary exchanges, or transfer content, property, shares, or other items of value based on a set of rules built into each contract. Many think that we\u2019ve only scratched the surface of what can be done with Ethereum as a platform, comparing the current uses and applications to the early days of the internet and dial-up modems.\n\nSimilarities Between LTC and ETH\n\nBoth Litecoin and Ethereum are traded on Coinbase . Coinbase works in a similar manner to a market maker on stock exchanges, purchasing from sellers and selling to buyers at prices that approximate the real-time trading price. GDAX is the exchange\u2019s platform for advanced traders. Both platforms offer Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum.\n\n. Coinbase works in a similar manner to a market maker on stock exchanges, purchasing from sellers and selling to buyers at prices that approximate the real-time trading price. GDAX is the exchange\u2019s platform for advanced traders. Both platforms offer Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. Litecoin and Ethereum provide fast transactions. Bitcoin is slow, although still faster than many traditional bank transfers. Both Litecoin and Ethereum enable faster transactions than Bitcoin, but they use different approaches to speed those transactions. Regardless of the technical details, a faster transaction time helps a currency to be viable.\n\nDifferences Between LTH and ETH\n\nLitecoin is primarily viewed as a currency \u2014 a transactional supplement to Bitcoin. Both were inspired by Bitcoin, with Litecoin as a fork of Bitcoin. (A fork is a divergence of existing open-source code to start a new project or related project.) However, Litecoin and Ethereum have taken very different directions in development. Litecoin is a faster and cheaper version of Bitcoin and Ethereum and attracts the attention of developers who see more applications for the platform.\n\nBoth were inspired by Bitcoin, with Litecoin as a fork of Bitcoin.

Litecoin is a faster and cheaper version of Bitcoin and Ethereum and attracts the attention of developers who see more applications for the platform. Ethereum is on a roll. Rising from white-paper obscurity, the ambitious dream of a young coder, to the world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency is an impressive feat and speaks to the enthusiasm the community has for Ethereum and its long-term applications. With the ability to host applications, store data, transfer value, and communicate \u2014 all on the blockchain \u2014 it\u2019s not surprising that Ethereum has captured the imagination of investors and developers alike.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile it is impossible to predict the future of the cryptocurrency bull run, it is apparent that Ethereum as a project and foundation has much stronger fundamentals and progress than Litecoin. While there are a few people who still hold Litecoin, LTC's failure to reclaim its 2017 price by the end of April is a clear indicator of a dying currency. However, that doesn't mean that there isn't still money to be made.\n\nEthereum is the clear winner of this battle, and a much safer investment relative to LTC. It is important to remember that we are still in the very early days of crypto, blockchain and smart contracts - so all investments should be categorized as speculative. Don't invest any money you can't afford to lose.\n\nWant to learn more?

The analyst also highlights the project\u2019s high yields, which may attract new buyers. Moreover, ETH has very high developmental activity. Altcoin Daily also points to ETH\u2019s price-earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) being 98, which is higher than Amazon\u2019s.\n\nFurthermore, after moving to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, sell pressure from miners has evaporated.

Discover SCENE\n\nIn the day and change since the historic debut of 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs on Wall Street, one clear crypto winner has emerged: Ethereum.\n\nThough BTC has seen many ups and downs since Bitcoin ETFs were approved Wednesday, the coin\u2019s rival, ETH, appears to have reaped most of the benefits of the event, rocketing steadily upwards. ETH hit $2,698 on Friday, approaching $2,700 for the first time since the crypto bear market kicked off in April 2022.\n\nThe token has since leveled to $2,645 at writing\u2014still up 18.5% in the last week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMuch of that sprint can be attributed to growing optimism that a spot Ethereum ETF might become a reality in mere months, thanks to Bitcoin paving the way.\n\nOn Friday, for instance, Larry Fink, CEO of Wall Street goliath BlackRock, told a CNBC interviewer that he\u2019s all in on an Ethereum ETF.\n\n\u201cWe believe this is just the beginning,\u201d Fink said this morning. \u201cI see value in having an Ethereum ETF.\u201d\n\nIn November, BlackRock filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue a spot ETH ETF. Analysts have predicted that the application will be successful, as the legal realities that compelled the SEC to begrudgingly approve a spot Bitcoin ETF likely also apply to Ethereum.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFink\u2019s enthusiasm for an Ethereum ETF appears to be tied to his broader goal of onboarding blockchain technology into traditional finance.\n\n\u201cETFs are step one in the technological revolution in the financial markets,\u201d he said. \u201cStep two is going to be the tokenization of every financial asset.\u201d\n\nThe BlackRock CEO also voiced his enthusiasm at the great success Bitcoin ETFs have enjoyed in their first day on the market, saying he was \u201cvery happy with the flows.\u201d In their first day alone, spot Bitcoin ETFs cleared a whopping $4.5 billion worth of trading volume.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs allow traditional financial institutions and investors to gain exposure to BTC without holding any cryptocurrency themselves. A spot ETH ETF would do the same for Ethereum.\n\nAnalysts have estimated that spot Bitcoin ETFs have now exposed the cryptocurrency to $14 trillion worth of traditional American financial assets.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Having retested the $2,100 level, Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency globally, is poised for an upward movement. At the time of reporting, the Ethereum (ETH) price stands at $2,200, with a market capitalization of $264 billion.\n\nEthereum Exchange Outflows\n\nDespite the current ETH price volatility, the Ethereum supply at the exchanges has hit a new low. This is a positive indicator showing that more investors are willing to hold their ETH for the long term.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSantiment, an on-chain data provider, reports that with Ethereum\u2019s market value slightly above $2,170, major exchange wallets are actively transferring coins to smaller wallets or withdrawing them from exchanges altogether. In the past 24 hours, a total of 240,000 ETH has been shifted from these large wallets, representing a 2.99% decrease in the amount of coins held.\n\nRenowned crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe suggests that while altcoins are exhibiting strength, it might not be a definitive trend at this point. He notes that Ethereum (ETH) currently lacks momentum, but anticipates a shift in the coming weeks. Van de Poppe predicts a money flow from Bitcoin to Ethereum, leading to a strong performance by altcoins in the first quarter of 2024, potentially coinciding with a peak in Bitcoin dominance.\n\nETH Price Action\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s trading session, Ethereum made an early attempt at a rally, amidst the ongoing market noise. The $2100 level emerges as a crucial support, having played a significant role in the past. This level, once a resistance point in the broader market, witnessed repeated challenges from an ascending triangle. Short-term pullbacks are expected to find support around this area. Even in the event of a breakdown below $2100, the 50-Day EMA is anticipated to provide substantial support, warranting close attention to this zone.\n\nOn the optimistic side, traders are eyeing the $2500 level as a potential target, with a considerable push expected from market participants aiming to drive Ethereum in that direction. Beyond that, the $2700 level comes into focus. The prevailing trend indicates a scenario where traders consistently seize value during every dip, reflecting an active pursuit of value by the majority of crypto traders.\n\nHowever, a breakdown below the 50-Day EMA could have negative implications for Ethereum. Additionally, the market\u2019s sensitivity to changes in interest rates, particularly in the United States and other bond markets, is noted. Any resurgence in rates is likely to exert pressure on the market, potentially leading to a broader decline in the crypto markets, not limited to Ethereum."

Discover SCENE\n\nCrypto startup Immutable is a gaming-focused firm with a layer-2 Ethereum blockchain, Immutable X, as well as an upcoming zkEVM blockchain, which has launched its test network at time of writing.\n\nMany games have adopted Immutable's tech to provide faster and cheaper on-chain interactions than Ethereum's own mainnet, and several of those titles have started flooding into the Epic Games Store, a major mainstream PC gaming marketplace.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at all the games using one of Immutable\u2019s networks that have been listed on the Epic Games Store.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAvalon\n\nNot to be confused with the sci-fi blockchain metaverse game of the same name, the Avalon game using the Immutable zkEVM blockchain is a medieval, open-world MMORPG where you can create characters, craft items, complete quests, and explore a world with dragons, ships, and expansive leafy landscapes. In Avalon, everything from characters to mounts, buildings, and forges will exist as NFTs.\n\nAvalon is currently listed as coming out sometime in 2024 on the Epic Games Store for PC players.\n\nBlocklords\n\nBlocklords is a bird\u2019s-eye view medieval strategy and simulation MMO currently in early access on the Epic Games Store. Players must select their own plot of land, build and staff a village, fight off invaders, and direct workers to mine, harvest, and complete other tasks. In Blocklords, story-based \u201cchoose your own adventure\u201d moments will appear, where players must pick a response to various events\u2014and face a range of consequences.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlocklords currently uses the Immutable X and Polygon blockchains for its optional NFTs, according to its Epic Games Store page.\n\nDelysium\n\nDelysium is a sci-fi MMORPG in development that will use both blockchain and AI elements. The game is currently slated to launch sometime in 2025, according to its Epic Games Store page. Players will be able to vote on game changes with the ERC-20 governance token AGI and buy NFTs on Immutable\u2019s marketplace that can customize their characters and weapons.\n\nGods Unchained\n\nGods Unchained, the NFT trading card game from Immutable, was first released back in 2018. In the Hearthstone-like game, players can earn its GODS token and use NFT cards. In June 2023, Gods Unchained was added to the Epic Games Store, but was subsequently removed due to Epic\u2019s policies barring Adults Only-rated games from its platform. The game\u2019s developer, Immutable, did not confirm to Decrypt how long the game was missing from the store\u2014but Reddit users noted that the game had been missing from Epic\u2019s store since at least October.\n\nFollowing Decrypt\u2019s December investigation into the issue, Epic Games revised its policy on AO-rated games, allowing games that had been given AO ratings simply because of their crypto elements to return to its platform. Gods Unchained was previously listed as an honorable mention in this article, but has now been updated to reflect that it\u2019s been relisted on the Epic Games Store.\n\nIlluvium\n\nIlluvium is an open-world exploration and pet autobattler NFT game that\u2019s currently available in early access on the Epic Game Store. Illuvium\u2019s Epic listing effectively combines two Illuvium games: Overworld and Arena. The former is a third-person sci-fi open-world exploration game, and the latter is the pet autobattler title, where players use cards of Illuvials to fight the enemy\u2019s Iluvials on a small battle arena.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile the game is currently free-to-play and has optional NFTs, Illuvium is using the Immutable X blockchain for all its in-game NFTs, like Illuvials and cosmetic items.\n\nMetalcore\n\nMetalcore is a first-person sci-fi shooter and third-person mech operating game currently in early access on the Epic Games Store. The game will use the Immutable zkEVM blockchain to host its NFTs, which are vehicles, weapons, crafting elements, and other items.\n\nSpace Nation Online\n\nSpace Nation Online is an MMORPG in development with the apocalyptic sci-fi director Roland Emmerich attached, who is known for his work on films like \u201cIndependence Day\u201d and \u201cThe Day After Tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe world of Space Nation will have one to two different star systems to explore at launch, offering characters from 3-5 different races including \u201cTerrans,\u201d according to the game\u2019s Epic store page. Currently, its Epic listing does not indicate that it is a blockchain game, but there will be a blockchain version of Space Nation that will offer NFTs on the Immutable zkEVM network.\n\nThe Bornless\n\nLike Space Nation, The Bornless is an NFT-optional game that is not currently listed as a blockchain game on the Epic store. The Bornless is an upcoming first-person horror shooter game with current plans to launch on the Epic Games Store sometime in 2024.\n\nIn the game, players will be able to choose from different superpower-like abilities and then hop into a range of shooter game modes like multiplayer deathmatches or duo co-op matches.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven more games\n\nBut that\u2019s not all\u2014there are a bunch of other games listed on the Epic store that use Immutable for their crypto elements. The fantasy MMORPG Age of Zalmoxis, card game The Lost Glitches, plane crash game Aviatrix, the monster battler Chain Monsters, and the shooter game Citizen Conflict have also all been added to Epic\u2019s store.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published on December 3 and last updated with new information on December 20."

The Sepolia and Holesky testnet launches are scheduled for January 31 and February 7, 2024.\n\nSo, if no major issues arise, we're looking at the following schedule: \u2013 Goerli: Jan 17, 6:32:00 UTC\n\n\u2013 Sepolia: Jan 30, 22:51:12 UTC\n\n\u2013 Holesky: Feb 7, 11:34:24 UTC \u2026 and then, mainnet \ud83e\udee1 pic.twitter.com/JFRt0ZHAi8 \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) December 21, 2023\n\nAccording to Ethereum protocol support lead Tim Beiko, the dates for the three testnet phases are not yet final. They are thus subject to change if developers encounter major issues during the testnet.\n\nBeiko added that a blog post covering details of the fork will be released within the second week of January 2024 to provide stakeholders with ample time to adjust to the updates.\n\nThe meeting discussed pending issues with the Dencun upgrade. In particular, the developers discussed requirements for implementing \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d a process that would enhance Ethereums data storage capacity by using \u201cblobs.\u201d\n\nBlobs are a new type of transaction with extra space for data designed to lower Ethereum gas fees by moving rollup data from the expensive EVM layer to the consensus layer.\n\nProto-danksharding limits the number of blobs in each block (16 per block, limited to 128 KB each). This adds about 2 MB of space to each processed block. The proposal for proto-danksharding was first forwarded through EIP-4844.\n\nDevelopers also discussed recent developments for Layer 3 app-chains, particularly the recent partnership between Avail and StarkWare. Avail has partnered with StarkWare to integrate their data-availability solutions for app-chains within the latter\u2019s Layer 2 network. The integration will use StarkWare\u2019s Madara sequencer to build app-chains that can function as Layer 3 solutions.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade represents Ethereum\u2019s next major upgrade after the Shapella hard fork earlier in April, which introduced staked ether withdrawals."

He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nEthereum (ETH), the premier smart contract network, boasts over $28 billion in decentralized financial (DeFi) ecosystems. Recently, there has been a noticeable surge in open interest, coinciding with the ongoing altcoin renaissance. The network, valued at $265 billion, benefits from institutions and retail traders\u2019 widespread adoption of web3 products. As a result, Ether\u2019s price has followed an upward trajectory over the past 12 months despite significant regulatory scrutiny in the United States and other jurisdictions.\n\nEthereum is a globally recognized digital asset characterized by deep liquidity and a high daily trading volume. As the largest altcoin, it has increasingly distanced itself from the volatile speculation associated with smaller-cap altcoins. Furthermore, Ethereum plays a crucial role in providing liquidity to most DeFi-based tokens, imparting much-needed stability to the industry.\n\n#Ethereum is currently retesting its breakout zone from an ascending triangle, hinting at preparation for a further climb.\n\n\n\nThe price range between $2,150 and $1,900 could be the ideal zone for accumulation before #ETH sets its sights on a higher target of $3,500. pic.twitter.com/6lGZT0ZKgv \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) December 20, 2023\n\nAccording to market intelligence from Santiment, the total supply of Ether currently on exchanges is about 8.07 percent of the circulating supply, marking the lowest level since the network\u2019s inception.\n\nAt the time of this report, approximately 28.4 million Ether have been staked to bolster the Ethereum ecosystem. In addition, roughly 3.8 million Ether have been burned, contributing to the network\u2019s transition to a deflationary asset.\n\nPer the analysis of a renowned crypto analyst, Ali Charts, Ethereum\u2019s price is on the brink of a significant upswing, potentially reaching $3,500 in the upcoming months. This projection is based on the observation that Ether\u2019s weekly price is nearing the completion of a retest of the macro ascending triangle breakout."

        "title": "Solana Q4 activity soars, outpaces Ethereum: Report - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Solana has seen a 400% growth in user activity in Q4.\n\nIts DeFi and NFT sectors have also seen considerable growth in the past few months.\n\nDaily user activity on Solana [SOL] has seen a notable rise of almost 400% as the last quarter of the year nears its end. This dwarfed the meager 3% increase seen on Ethereum [ETH], on-chain data provider Messari noted in a new report.\n\nAccording to the research firm, the recent surge in new demand for Solana is due to the series of token airdrops completed by some protocols housed within the Layer 1 (L1) blockchain network.\n\nFor example, on the 20th of November, the Solana-based oracle network Pyth (PYTH) completed the airdrop of 250 million PYTH tokens worth around $77 million to its early users.\n\nAlso, on the 7th of December, Jito airdropped some of its native tokens worth $225 Million to some of its users on the Solana network.\n\nJupiter, a swap aggregator and one of the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols on Solana, recently announced that its highly anticipated airdrop of 4 billion JUP tokens will take place in January.\n\nApart from the series of airdrops by projects on the chain, the meteoric rise in BONK\u2019s value has contributed to the upswing in Solana\u2019s network activity.\n\nSolana\u2019s DeFi and NFT ecosystems see growth\n\nExchanging hands at $0.0000209 at press time, the dog-themed token has rallied by 544.4% in the last month, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nThe airdrops have culminated in a 30% growth in SOL\u2019s value in the last month. According to Messari:\n\n\u201cCombined with the recent airdrops and positive price appreciation, these factors have helped make Solana firmly the second-largest chain by DEX volumes, closely rivaling Ethereum for the top spot.\u201d\n\nIn the last month, there has been a significant increase in activity across the DEXes on Solana. AMBCrypto found that the total volume of transactions completed through Solana-based DEXes has grown by 255% in the last 30 days.\n\nAs of the 18th of December, this totaled $871 million, data from Artemis showed.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 SOLs worth today?\n\nAccording to Messari:\n\n\u201cNearly 60% of Solana\u2019s DEX volume is driven through DEX aggregator Jupiter, which has eclipsed Uniswap V3 on Ethereum. Jupiter\u2019s trades are routed to underlying DEXs that settle the order, the largest of which has been Orca. Orca is now the second largest DEX in all of crypto, behind Uniswap V3 on Ethereum.\u201d\n\nFurther, Solana\u2019s non-fungible token (NFT) vertical has also seen an impressive performance in the past few months. As highlighted in the report, sales volume on the chain has increased by almost 500% in the last 90 days."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s liquidation increased when its price reached the $2,270 mark.\n\nMost market indicators and on-chain metrics looked bearish.\n\nEthereum [ETH] is witnessing a massive surge in network activity of late. This happened at a time when the king of altcoins\u2019 liquidation levels increased.\n\nWill Ethereum\u2019s high network activity be enough to help paint the coin\u2019s chart green?\n\nEthereum\u2019s user activity is high\n\nUsers have shown immense interest in Ethereum in the recent past, as shown by its spiking network activity.\n\nAMBCrypto also looked at Glassnode\u2019s data, which revealed that Ethereum\u2019s Active Addresses had gained upward momentum since the 16th of December.\n\nThe blockchain\u2019s Number of New Addresses metric followed a similar increasing trend.\n\nHowever, while the blockchain\u2019s network activity was on the rise, the token witnessed a sell-off. AMBCrypto\u2019s look at Hyblock Capital\u2019s data pointed out that ETH\u2019s liquidation increased substantially near the $2,270 mark.\n\nThe hike in liquidation resulted in a price correction as the token\u2019s price sank.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, ETH was down by nearly 3% in the last seven days. At the time of writing, it was trading at $2,193.67 with a market capitalization of over $259 billion.\n\nA bearish signal was ETH\u2019s hike in volume, which legitimized the token\u2019s price downtick.\n\nEthereum has concerns to address\n\nAs ETH\u2019s price dropped, several on-chain metrics turned bearish on the token. For example, AMBCrypto found that selling pressure on Ethereum was high, evidenced by its rising Exchange Reserve at press time.\n\nMoreover, investors in the US and Korea seemed to have been selling their holdings. This was apparent from CryptoQuant\u2019s data, which revealed that both the Coinbase Premium and Korea Premium were red.\n\nThings on the derivatives side of the market also remained negative. Notably, ETH\u2019s Taker Buy Sell Ratio was red, meaning that selling sentiment was dominant in the Futures market.\n\nApart from metrics, several market indicators, like the MACD, looked bearish on the king of altcoins at press time. Its Money Flow Index (MFI) also went southward and was headed below the neutral mark.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nAnother bearish indicator was ETH\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which waned slightly.\n\nConsidering the aforementioned datasets, it seemed likely that investors might have to wait longer to witness ETH\u2019s bull rally, despite a rise in network activity."

The development of Dencun was impeded by technical issues that persisted until Q4 of 2023.\n\nProto-danksharding is an update (EIP-4844) that attempts to reduce layer-2 rollup fees and increase blockchain space for data blobs. By expanding Ethereum\u2019s blockchain\u2019s data storage capacity, this development should increase transaction capacity without increasing gas prices.\n\nThe developers want to upgrade Sepolia\u2019s Testnet by January 31 and Holesky\u2019s network by February 7, barring any disruptions and presuming Dencun tests properly on Goerli. The biggest Ethereum test chains are represented by these splits.\n\nThough this schedule is susceptible to change based on developments, the end of February was the last soft objective for deploying Dencun to the Mainnet.\n\nWith the release of Shapella\u2019s update, engineers enabled withdrawal capabilities for staked Ether (ETH). Dencun is the first significant technological advancement since then."

If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nWe\u2019re entering an exciting new chapter in the world of cryptocurrency, as some analysts at JP Morgan have intriguing predictions for 2024. They\u2019re expecting a bit of a shake-up in the crypto ranks. Ethereum is tipped to take the spotlight from Bitcoin, the long-time king of crypto. And keep an eye on some new ICOs like InQubeta (QUBE) and old horses like Avalanche (AVAX) \u2013 they\u2019re expected to make some significant moves too!\n\nInQubeta (QUBE): A Leap into AI Investment with Crypto\n\nIn the world of crypto, where innovation is the key, InQubeta stands out not just for its technological advancement but for its human-centric approach. It represents more than just a platform; it embodies the bridge between AI\u2019s untapped potential and the common investor. The platform\u2019s unique proposition of fractional investment in AI startups using QUBE tokens marks a departure from the elite circles of Silicon Valley, bringing AI investment opportunities to the doorstep of everyday investors.\n\nPicture this: You are not just investing in a startup; you\u2019re becoming a part of its journey, its challenges, and its successes. That\u2019s the story InQubeta offers through its popular NFT-based investment model. Each NFT is a story in itself, narrating the growth and innovation of an AI startup and offering you a piece of that future.\n\nAt the heart of InQubeta is the QUBE token, a testament to the project\u2019s vision of long-term value and community-driven governance. Its deflationary nature and rewarding tokenomics make it the best altcoin for investors. But more importantly, it empowers holders with a voice in shaping the AI future, making each investor a protagonist in the story of AI evolution.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Anticipated Supremacy in 2024\n\nMoving to the broader crypto landscape, Ethereum is poised to take a leading role, according to JP Morgan analysts. The expected technological upgrades, particularly EIP-4844, are set to enhance Ethereum\u2019s efficiency by reducing gas fees and boosting throughput. This improvement is not just a technical upgrade; it\u2019s a milestone in Ethereum\u2019s journey towards a more sustainable and user-friendly blockchain ecosystem.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX): The Rising Star in Smart Contract Platforms\n\nAvalanche, a formidable contender in the smart contract space, is gaining traction with its Ethereum compatibility and innovative multi-chain structure. Its ability to support a wide range of dApps, NFTs, and blockchain gaming positions it as a versatile and promising platform. The AVAX token, central to the Avalanche ecosystem, is not merely a good crypto to buy; it\u2019s a key to a secure and thriving network, rewarding validators and securing its future.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we look ahead to 2024, the crypto market is set to witness a paradigm shift. Ethereum\u2019s ascendancy, Avalanche\u2019s steady climb, and InQubeta\u2019s breakthrough in AI investment mark the beginning of a new chapter in the crypto narrative. Each of these players brings something unique to the table, reshaping the market dynamics and opening new horizons for investors. InQubeta, with its unique blend of technology and human touch, is not just another cryptocurrency ICO; it\u2019s a harbinger of a future where AI and crypto converge, creating a realm of limitless possibilities. As these players gear up for their respective journeys, the crypto world awaits with bated breath, ready to embrace the new champions of the digital age.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities"

At press time, only 8% of the coin\u2019s total circulating supply sits on exchanges.\n\nThis implies that only 9,615,238 ETH are held across all exchanges out of the coin\u2019s circulating supply of 120,190,475 ETH.\n\nThe whales are up to something\n\nThe decline in ETH\u2019s exchange reserve comes on the heels of a significant coin outflow from whale wallets observed within the past 24 hours.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter), Santiment noted that between 18th and 19th December, ETH\u2019s top 10 largest wallets transferred a total of 240,000 ETH from their wallets, causing a 2.99% decrease in the overall amount of coins held in these wallets.\n\n\ud83d\udc4d As #Ethereum's market value hangs just above $2,170, the largest exchange wallets continue to move coins into smaller wallets or off exchanges entirely. 240K $ETH has been collectively moved from these wallets in 24 hours, a 2.99% drop in coins held. https://t.co/Fw7lKcVZan pic.twitter.com/AMFPDL4BXp \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 19, 2023\n\nThe data provider claimed these transfers were either made to smaller wallets or personal wallets.\n\nThe motives behind this whale movement remain unclear but could range from a shift towards long-term investment strategies to concerns about exchange security or broader market uncertainties.\n\nInterestingly, amid the decline in market liquidity witnessed on 19th December, there was a notable rise in new demand for ETH.\n\nData from Santiment showed that the day saw the creation of 100,000 new ETH addresses, marking a 23% uptick from the previous day\u2019s 81,000.\n\nIt also marked a single-day high in new wallet creation; the highest since 10th June.\n\nThis uptick coincided with the coin\u2019s brief decline to $2,140 on that day. Therefore, it could be new entrants trying to \u201cbuy the dip\u201d in anticipation of a price rally.\n\nYet, as indicated by the coin\u2019s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicator, signaling the onset of a bear cycle, ETH accumulation has slowed since 11th December.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nIts key momentum indicators have since trended downward.

Additionally, Ethereum's value is intricately tied to interest rates, boasting a negative correlation.\n\nForex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list\n\nBitcoin, the pioneer of cryptocurrencies, has been on a significant upward trajectory, and it's no surprise that Ethereum is following suit. The $2100 level, nestled beneath the current Ethereum price, is a crucial support zone that traders are likely to defend vehemently. This level serves as a solid foundation for Ethereum's upward aspirations.\n\nA Potential Pullback as An Opportunity\n\nShould a pullback occur, it's expected to offer an enticing buying opportunity, attracting numerous investors eager to capitalize on Ethereum's potential. In the near term, the cryptocurrency may aim to break above the $2400 mark, with an eye on the $2500 level as the next target. However, market participants should exercise caution during the holiday season, as liquidity can be limited, potentially leading to volatile and erratic price movements.\n\nOne of the driving factors behind Ethereum's bullish outlook is the Federal Reserve's ongoing monetary policy, which continues to favor loose financial conditions. This policy stance enhances the appeal of Ethereum as an investment option, setting the stage for a promising 2024.\n\nDespite the short-term optimism, a lingering question looms over Ethereum's future: Will it find a compelling and widespread use case? The cryptocurrency market has yet to witness a \"must-have application\" that captures mainstream attention and adoption. Instead, it often appears that cryptocurrencies are solutions in search of problems to solve.\n\nEthereum's role as the backbone of numerous other digital currencies and ecosystems positions it as a prime candidate for betting on the success of these applications. However, the elusive killer application that catapults Ethereum into widespread use has yet to materialize.\n\nIn the end, Ethereum's recent rally is a testament to its resilience and the positive sentiment prevailing in the cryptocurrency market. Investors may find value in buying Ethereum during price dips, but the long-term success of Ethereum hinges on the emergence of a compelling use case that captures the imagination of the masses. Until then, the crypto market remains in search of its breakthrough moment, with Ethereum at the forefront of this ongoing quest.\n\nReady to trade ETH/USD?

        "content": "Thu 21 Dec 2023 \u25aa 4 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nThe Solana crypto platform is making waves. Its remarkable performance across key indicators, in comparison to Ethereum, is drawing attention. It\u2019s surely a sign of some dynamism. However, this comes with certain operational cost limitations. We\u2019ll explain everything.\n\nSolana outperforms Ethereum according to major crypto indicators\n\nRecent data indicates that the Solana blockchain protocol is quickly gaining ground and surpassing Ethereum in key metrics. This trend highlights a notable shift in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nData brought to light by Ryan Watkins, co-founder of Syncracy Capital, showcases Solana\u2019s impressive performance in terms of decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), active addresses, number of transactions, and stablecoin transfers.\n\nThis bullish momentum of Solana coincides with a significant rise in the price of SOL, Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency. It has reached new heights, breaking through immediate resistance levels in recent months of trading.\n\nThe bullish trend in the crypto market has propelled SOL prices. This has revitalized activities on this blockchain. It is evidenced by the increase in the number of transactions and the rise in its total value locked (TVL) in the decentralized finance (DeFi) segment.\n\nThe drivers of this momentum are due to Solana\u2019s scalability. A feature that allows deployed protocols to execute transactions and launch smart contracts at a lower cost. All this is supported by a blockchain infrastructure based on independent nodes rewarded for their commitment, which promotes decentralization and security. But there is a catch.\n\nChange happens fast. Solana now rivals or surpasses Ethereum across:\n\n\n\n\u2013 DEX Volumes\n\n\u2013 NFT Volumes\n\n\u2013 Active Addresses\n\n\u2013 Transaction Count\n\n\u2013 Stablecoin Transfers\n\n\n\n\u201cBut Solana isn\u2019t decentralized \ud83d\ude24\u201d\n\n\n\nReality: Solana has ~40% the amount of nodes as Ethereum, they\u2019re only ~5x more\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ZBuLiTcXmf \u2014 Ryan Watkins (@RyanWatkins_) December 19, 2023 Solana outpaces Ethereum in many areas, but the operational costs of nodes remain a major issue\n\nThe costly operation of nodes in Solana\n\nBeyond this remarkable performance, the analysis also highlights a crucial aspect concerning the operational cost of running Solana nodes. It turns out that operating a Solana node is about five times more expensive than running an Ethereum node.\n\nThe data provided by Syncrancy clearly puts this cost difference into perspective. Operating an Ethereum node costs about 550 dollars, whereas running a high-end Solana node on Firedancer costs 5,100 dollars.\n\nThis is paradoxical given that Solana boasts about having approximately 40 % of the number of nodes compared to Ethereum. Even though the platform seems to be addressing this weakness with its relevance in terms of decentralization. In this regard, the Nakamoto coefficient, a decentralization indicator, shows a higher figure for Solana, at 21 compared to only 2 for Ethereum.\n\nMoreover, Solana is committed to maximizing its lead in terms of decentralization. To this end, the crypto platform plans to launch the Firedancer validation tool, which aims to diversify and strengthen its network.\n\nThis is expected to enable it to accelerate block production. While allowing the mainnet to evolve towards processing more crypto transactions on the blockchain, without relying on external alternatives.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "The transferred stash was worth more than a million at press time.\n\nButerin\u2019s earlier claims of transfers being related to charity started doing the rounds.\n\nEthereum [ETH] co-founder Vitalik Buterin moved 500 ETH, worth $1.08 million as of this writing, to crypto exchange Coinbase, fueling speculations in the crypto community about the intention of the transfer.\n\nAMBCrypto scanned on-chain data and noticed movement of 500 ETH from address labeled \u201cvitalik.eth\u201d to a Coinbase custody wallet on 19th December.\n\nIncoming sell-pressure or just charity?\n\nGenerally, influential investors or whales moving a large chunk of their stashes to exchanges triggers anxiety among participants.\n\nThis is because of the dominant belief that they are likely to be sold off, putting downward pressure on the asset. However, this is not always true.\n\nIn the current scenario, Buterin might be using Coinbase\u2019 institutional custody services to secure his holdings or staking them to collect rewards.\n\nAmidst the suspense around the real intentions behind the moves, an earlier clarification by Buterin started doing the rounds as well.\n\nIn a discussion on decentralized social app Warpast some two months ago, he had said,\n\n\u201cIf you see an article saying \u201cVitalik sends XXX ETH to [exchange]\u201d, it\u2019s not actually me selling, it\u2019s almost always me donating to some charity or nonprofit or other project, and the recipient selling because, well, they have to cover expenses.\u201d\n\nButerin\u2019s explanation came in response to intense speculation following large movements of his Ethereum holdings to centralized exchanges back then.\n\nDid whales liquidate their holdings?\n\nHowever, the concerns of the ETH holders were not unfounded. At press time, ETH was exchanging hands at $2,209, per CoinMarketCap, with a 24-hour loss of 1.49%.\n\nEthereum whales were active over the last two days. This was evident as transactions worth more than $1 million spiked, according to AMBCrypto\u2019s observation of Santiment data.\n\nRead ETH\u2019s Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nMoreover. the amount of ETH moving to exchanges also rose in the same time.\n\nWhen the two indicators were examined together, it appeared that ETH whales did engage in profit-taking, resulting in some sell-pressure for the asset."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nRead U.Today's top three news stories to learn what's happening in the world of crypto.\n\nBlackRock inches closer to Bitcoin ETF\n\nIn his X post from Monday, Dec. 19, James Seyffart, ETF research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, reported that BlackRock updated its S-1 filing with the SEC. The amended document includes new details of the creation and redemption mechanisms for the proposed fund, which is denoted by the IBIT ticker. Bloomberg Intelligence's senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas commented on Seyffart's post, noting that BlackRock has now transitioned to a cash-only approach, and that it is a \"good sign.\" He explained that the move was done in order to create new ETF shares, rather than direct Bitcoin deposits. BlackRock is not the only company that updated its filings for a spot Bitcoin ETF; the same move was made by ARK Invest and 21Shares.\n\nShibarium hits record 130 million inscriptions\n\nIn a recent impressive development, Shibarium , Shiba Inu's layer-2 solution, hit over 130 million inscriptions, with its gas fees being the lowest in the industry. As stated by SHIB developer Kaal Dhairya, Shibarium achieved this faster than any other chain. He credits the Shibarium team's hard work for this accomplishment. With 130 million inscriptions, Shibarium is outpacing almost all of its competitors, except for Polygon being ahead of it, having 161 million inscriptions. Then comes BNB, which reports about 77 million inscriptions, and Avalanche C-Chain with 60 million. Other networks such as Fantom, Celo, Gnosis, Arbitrum One and zkSync Era report lower figures.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Buterin makes significant transfer to Coinbase Wallet"

Both market watchers and enthusiasts have been waiting for these top cryptocurrencies to rise again for a very long time.

        "title": "Dencun Dreams: Ethereum Devs Target January 2024 For 1st Testnet Deployment - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "A note on the official Ethereum GitHub repository states that the testing phase of the forthcoming Ethereum upgrade, named Dencun, will begin on January 17.\n\nThe Goerli testnet will be the first to receive the upgrade, with the Sepolia and Holesky testnets receiving it in the coming weeks. The Ethereum team has not, however, released the precise timing of the upgrade\u2019s mainnet rollout.\n\nThe renovation was originally scheduled for the last quarter of 2023, but because of the engineering difficulties, it was moved to 2024.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation\u2019s protocol support head, Tim Beiko, pointed out that the deadline is flexible and subject to modify in the event that significant problems develop.\n\nIn order to give stakeholders a week\u2019s notice to get ready for the upgrade, the team plans to publish a blog post describing the fork during the week of January 8, 2024.\n\nSource: GitHub\n\nWhat Does Dencun Mean?\n\nDeneb and Cancun, the names of a star and a city that they use for their consensus layer client upgrades and execution layer client upgrades, respectively, are the sources of the name of Dencun, an Ethereum network update.\n\nTechnically speaking, it will be significant for Ethereum since it will introduce the well-known EIP-4844, commonly referred to as Proto Dank Sharding.\n\nThe latest update comes with a number of tools designed to lower costs, provide additional functionality like staking pools and bridges, and restrict the use of smart contracts\u2019 self-destruct functions.\n\nSo, if no major issues arise, we\u2019re looking at the following schedule: \u2013 Goerli: Jan 17, 6:32:00 UTC\n\n\u2013 Sepolia: Jan 30, 22:51:12 UTC\n\n\u2013 Holesky: Feb 7, 11:34:24 UTC \u2026 and then, mainnet \ud83e\udee1 pic.twitter.com/JFRt0ZHAi8 \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) December 21, 2023\n\nThe Option To Abort\n\nDuring the call, Beiko indicated that they have the ability to cancel if they find a severe problem or an unanticipated issue. He also mentioned that the goal is to publish the fork\u2019s blog post during the first week of January, giving users a minimum of one week to finish their revisions.\n\n\u201cObviously if we find a major issue or something crazy before then we can always cancel,\u201d he said. \u201cThis would mean ideally we\u2019re putting out the blog post for the fork sometime during the week of January 8th, so people have at least a week to update.\u201d\n\nEthereum currently trading at $2,288.52 territory. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nDencun: Technical Aspect\n\nIn more technical terms, Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, or \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d is one of the main elements of Dencun. With the help of a recently developed format known as \u201cblobs,\u201d this proposal enables layer-2 rollup networks such as Arbitrum, Base, Polygon zkEVM, and others to temporarily store particular transaction data.\n\nBlobs have an 18-day deletion period, in contrast to the present practice of permanently preserving data in the blockchain\u2019s \u201cCALLDATA\u201d field. The creators of Ethereum predict that proto-danksharding will significantly reduce layer 2 transaction fees.\n\nThe testing phase for Ethereum updates often lasts several months prior to the mainnet rollout. Code-named \u201cShapella,\u201d the prior deployment, started testing on February 7. On April 12, the mainnet launch took place.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum was trading at $2,287, down 1.3% and 1.7% in the last 24 hours and seven days, respectively, data from Coingecko shows.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock"
