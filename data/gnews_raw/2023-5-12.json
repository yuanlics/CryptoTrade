        "title": "Ethereum Finality Hiccup a 'Fire Drill' That 'Could Have Been Avoided' - Blockworks",
        "content": "The Ethereum network suffered a hiccup Thursday; one that developers are still parsing for clues. But as a user, you would hardly have noticed.\n\nAt worst, it would have taken slightly longer for a transaction to be included in a block, and there was a somewhat lower certainty that a given action would be considered final \u2014 for about 25 minutes.\n\nThe blockchain\u2019s developer community saw the incident as a strong test of the network\u2019s resilience. It also served as further impetus to increase diversity of the independent software clients that make Ethereum run.\n\nThe extent of Ethereum\u2019s client diversity is unique among major blockchains, and a cause championed by members of the community such as the pseudonymous Superphiz \u2014 known as the \u201cEthereum community health consultant\u201d \u2014 who was one of the first to notice the issue.\n\n\u201cBarely a blip happened, but it was so uncharacteristic for the Ethereum network that it was a big deal anyway,\u201d he tweeted Friday.\n\nThe same issue resurfaced again Friday, which Superphiz called, \u201cnot surprising,\u201d adding, these things tend to happen in waves.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe precise cause is not yet known, but the effect was a failure to finalize blocks. It\u2019s likely to have involved a coincidence of \u201ctwo or three issues,\u201d according to Irina Timchenko, Ethereum blockchain manager at Everstake.\n\n\u201cDuring the incident, validators experienced issues with Prysm and Teku nodes. Some of these issues were resolved after a restart, while others returned to normal without requiring a restart,\u201d Timchenko told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cSubsequently, validators noticed a spike in CPU usage, which appears to be a second-order effect rather than the root cause of the problem,\u201d she added.\n\nAccording to a Prysm developer known as Potuz, \u201cseveral valid, but untimely attestations were broadcast in the network. This typically happens when a node that is struggling to be synced, attests with an old view of the chain.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nA fix is already in the works, which has become more urgent since the problem has recurred.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nTimchenko and others say the loss of finality could have been avoided entirely if less than a third of all validators ran the same consensus layer software client. Currently, two clients, Prysm and Lighthouse, are estimated to be operating on greater than a third of Ethereum nodes, according to clientdiversity.org.\n\nFreddy Zwanzger, Ethereum ecosystem lead at Blockdaemon agrees.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Ethereum does have multiple client implementations actually seemed to have prevented the blockchain from halting, and if all consensus clients would have less than 33% of the network, the finalization delay would also have been avoided,\u201d Zwanzger told Blockworks.\n\nSince blocks were still being produced, transactions were processed continuously, which is why end users didn\u2019t see much, if any, effect, he added.\n\nLiveness over safety\n\nIn designing blockchains with proof-of-stake consensus, developers have to make choices over how to prioritize one of two properties: safety and liveness.\n\nColloquially, safety is thought of as \u201cavoiding bad things.\u201d That means every node in the network agrees consistently on the state of the chain.\n\nEthereum prioritizes liveness, which is thought of as \u201cgood things happen eventually.\u201d The blockchain is designed to be very difficult to halt.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nIt could have been worse if Prysm were still installed on upwards of 66% of nodes, which has been the case in the past.\n\nWhen a consensus layer client causes a loss of finality \u2014 which is what happened Thursday \u2014 the network averts a fork (a \u201cbad thing\u201d in this case) so long it doesn\u2019t have a supermajority client. But liveness was impacted because Prysm remains above the 33% threshold.\n\nEthereum\u2019s specific consensus algorithm, called Gasper, saved the day, according to Gaetan Semp, a blockchain and DeFi consultant at Alyra.\n\n\u201cGasper is truly an amazing consensus algorithm,\u201d he tweeted, noting that even without a supermajority of nodes, the blockchain continued to be validated by LMD-Ghost, a \u201cweaker \u2018short-term consensus\u2019 as venture firm Paradigm has called it. LMD is short of \u201cLatest Message Driven\u201d and LMD-Ghost is part of Ethereum\u2019s \u201cfork-choice rule.\u201d\n\nThis is a trade-off, however, and one which not all users would approve of, Matt Fiebach of Blockworks Research noted.\n\n\u201cWithout the ability for nodes to reach consensus and achieve transaction finality, a user cannot be sure that their transaction will be included in the Ethereum canonical chain,\u201d Fiebach said.\n\nAlternative architectures from Solana and Cosmos favor a chain halt to preserve safety. \u201cA 30-minute loss of finality is unacceptable for end users because it puts transactions at risk of being reverted,\u201d Richard Patel, a software developer for Firedancer, tweeted in response to the Ethereum glitch.\n\nFiredancer, developed by Jump Crypto, will soon become the first independent client for Solana.\n\nVance Spencer, co-founder at Framework Ventures described the failure to finalize as \u201ca significant event,\u201d but one with \u201ca lot of nuance.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinalization is especially important for entities like exchanges which need to ensure on-chain transactions aren\u2019t reverted after they process them off-chain,\u201d Spencer told Blockworks.\n\nA resilience test\n\nMarius van der Wijden, who develops the Go Ethereum (or Geth) execution layer client for Ethereum, called the incident \u201ca great fire drill\u201d and explained that having client diversity was key to the ability of the network to heal itself.\n\n\u201cThe different implementations react slightly [differently] to extreme scenarios which provides a huge boost in reliability,\u201d van der Wijden told Blockworks. \u201cHaving different implementations means we can test [them] against each other, which can help us quickly pinpointing issues and determining the root cause of an issue,\u201d he added.\n\nVan der Wijden was confident that proof-of-work consensus algorithms would have performed \u201cmuch worse\u201d under the circumstances.\n\nIndustry observers, such as Fabrice Cheng, co-founder and CEO at Quadrata, sounded an optimistic note about the long-term prospects of the Ethereum network, coming out of this affair.\n\n\u201cEven when over 60% of all nodes went offline, the longest time you had you wait for your transaction to be included was [1 minute and] 24 seconds,\u201d he said.\n\nFriday\u2019s recurrence was more severe, but developers note that block production continues unabated.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nUpdated May 12, 2023, at 5:11 pm ET: Additional detail and comments.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Ethereum core developers rolled out patches for Prysm Labs and Teku clients in response to two Beacon Chain finality issues in 24 hours. The Beacon Chain serves as the consensus layer for the Ethereum network.\n\nOn May 11, Ethereum developers reported that the Beacon Chain was experiencing problems confirming transactions. Although new blocks could be proposed, an unknown issue prevented their finalization. The outage lasted around 25 minutes. A similar issue occurred on May 12, preventing block finalization for over an hour.\n\nFinality was unable to be reached for three and eight epochs, said the Ethereum Foundation in a statement shared by an Ethereum consultant on Twitter. The issue \u201cappears to have been caused by high load on some of the Consensus Layers clients, which in turn was caused by an exceptional scenario.\u201d\n\nThe beacon chain stopped finalizing about thirty minutes ago. I don't know why yet, but in general the chain is designed to be resilient against this, transactions will continue as usual and finalization will kick in when the problem is resolved. pic.twitter.com/utAS0uAWpG \u2014 superphiz.eth \ufe0f (@superphiz) May 11, 2023\n\nAlthough the network was unable to finalize, live and end users were able to transact on the network thanks to client diversity, \u201cas not all client implementations were affected by this exceptional scenario.\u201d\n\nClient diversity relates to the number of software clients available to network validators. Greater diversity among clients means a more robust and secure network.\n\nTeky and Prysm have released upgrades that implement optimizations to prevent beacon nodes from consuming excessive resources.\n\nA similar issue occurred on March 15, delaying the Goerli testnet version of Ethereum\u2019s \u201cShapella\u201d upgrade, which was successfully deployed on April 12. Ethereum\u2019s preexisting proof-of-work chain merged with the Beacon Chain on Sept. 15, 2022, enabling the network\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which is faster and less energy-intensive.\n\nRecent trading hype around memecoins has increased Ethereum\u2019s activity and staking rewards rates. According to on-chain data, validators earned $46 million in the first week of May, or 24,997 Ether (ETH), a 40% increase over the previous week\u2019s income of $33 million, when 18,339 ETH were distributed as rewards.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

The network\u2019s core developers tweeted shortly after confirming that the network was having trouble finalizing transactions and the issue was being investigated.\n\nFinality has been restored.

In this instance, the issue seemingly fixed itself without any developer intervention.\n\nTerence Tsao, co-founder of Ethereum Proof-of-Stake client Prysm, issued an update on Twitter, saying the team had identified areas where state caching could be improved so that nodes perform better during periods of degradation, like the one witnessed earlier in the day.\n\n\u201cGiven the chain has stabilized, as a staker / node operator, there\u2019s no action required moment,\u201d he said.\n\nMarius van der Wijden, another Etheruem developer, described the event as a \u201cgreat firedrill\u201d for the network.\n\n\u201cIt looks like two or three issues came together (as its often the case).

Fortunately, the issue was resolved before it got to this stage, which was likely one or two epochs of non-finality away, according to Ethereum developer Ben Edgington."

        "content": "Sharp Decline May Cast Doubt on Summer Rally\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nDive\n\nWith network activity plunging, Ethereum\u2019s transaction fees are now at their lowest level since the heady days of \u2018DeFi Summer\u2019 in mid-2020, according to data from Ycharts.\n\nEthereum\u2019s average fees are at their lowest level in two years, with transactions executing for less than 13 gwei a pop.\n\nSummer Rally\n\nThe sharp decline in on-chain activity may also cast doubt on the bullish signal that\u2019s been driving a summer rally in Ethereum and other DeFi names: The Merge.\n\nInvestors may have to reckon with the likelihood that more Ether may not be destroyed than new coins are issued after the network shifts to Proof-of-Stake consensus in September.\n\nIn August 2021, Ethereum\u2019s EIP-1559 upgrade went live, introducing the burning of base transactions fees. From then on, a portion of each Ethereum transaction fee is permanently destroyed.\n\nThe Merge\n\nCoupled with the rapidly approaching Eth2 Proof of Stake chain-merge, many analysts tipped the network to become deflationary \u2014 meaning more Ether is removed from supply through burning than is created as validator rewards \u2014 after The Merge is executed next month.\n\n\n\nBut with network activity plummeting amid the bear trend, Ethereum\u2019s deflationary narrative is currently looking uncertain. Demand for block space must increase by roughly one-third from current levels in order for the burn rate to keep pace with post-merge Ether issuance.\n\nEthereum\u2019s transaction fees are now at their lowest level since decentralized finance began to attract a significant user base during the \u2018DeFi Summer\u2019 of mid-2020. According to Ycharts, average daily transaction fees are currently around 12.5 gwei, its lowest level since April 2020.\n\nEthereum average transaction fees.

According to Ultra Sound Money, a website tracking Ethereum\u2019s burn rate, just 7,440 ETH was destroyed over the past seven days \u2014 its lowest level since EIP-1559 went live last year.\n\nBy contrast, the burn-rate peaked in January amid the top of the NFT bubble, when more than 12 ETH was burned every minute, equating to 121,000 per week.\n\nEthereum weekly burn-rate.

The upgrade has been tipped to usher in a more than 99% improvement in the network\u2019s energy efficiency and a 90% decrease in new Ether issuance.\n\nWhile many analysts are still tweeting that Ethereum will become deflationary when the upgrade goes live, the recent drop in network activity is challenging this hypothesis.\n\nBurn Rate\n\nThe current burn-rate would offset two-thirds of Ether issuance after The Merge, according to Justin Drake, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation. In a recent appearance on The Defiant Podcast, Drake predicted that 1,600 ETH will be issued daily once Ethereum has transitioned to Proof of Stake, equal to 11,200 Ether each week.\n\nEthereum\u2019s burn rate will change over time, steadily increasing as stakers lock up ETH to run a node and become a network validator.\n\nSpeaking during the fifth EthCC conference in July, Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder and chief scientist, said that new Ether will be issued annually at the complicated rate of 166 times the square root of the number of staked ETH.\n\nThis means that if 1M ETH is staked, 166,000 new Ether will enter into circulation each year, but if 100M ETH is staked, issuance will only be increased to 1.66M Ether.\n\nAccording to Staking Rewards, nearly 13,15M ETH or 10.8% of circulating Ether is currently locked up for staking, According to Buterin\u2019s equation, 1,649 new ETH would be issued daily under Proof of Stake, equal to 11,543 Ether weekly.\n\nDespite The Merge not yet taking effect, Ethereum has already produced 26 days of deflationary issuance since transaction fee burning was introduced.\n\nNFT Activity\n\nEthereum has posted two full weeks of deflationary issuance so far, according to data from Watch The Burn. The first week occurred at the end of October towards the peak of the broader digital asset markets, with surging NFT activity driving the second week of negative issuance in January.\n\nThe largest daily burn on record occurred on May 1 as fees soared amid the extreme gas wars surrounding Yuga Labs\u2019 Otherdeeds NFT land sale. More than 58,000 Ether were destroyed in a single day, worth nearly $160M at the time.\n\nEthereum\u2019s deflationary days.

        "title": "Accumulation of $1 billion worth of ETH prevents Ethereum price from falling below this key level - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price is trading at $1,800 after averting a potential decline to the critical support level of $1,700.\n\nThroughout May, more than 600,000 ETH has been accrued by the investors, which has helped offset the price drop.\n\nWhales, however, seem to be reluctant to bear any losses, shedding more than $1.7 billion worth of ETH in the last 12 days.\n\nEthereum price has been setting the path for most of the major and minor altcoins in the market, just as ETH investors are doing for it. The mixed behavior from different cohorts suggests that there is still some uncertainty regarding where the market could go. However, investors are doing their best to prevent a downfall.\n\nEthereum price hovers around monthly lows\n\nEthereum price trading at $1,795 is currently at a monthly low, following a decline of more than 10% in the last few days. The concern of losses among the investors could have actually driven the price down further, but the optimism outweighed the fear, preventing a drastic drawdown.\n\nMost of this fear was visible only in the large wallet holders who seemed to have bolted at the first sign of a potential decline. The addresses holding between 100,000 to 1 million ETH shed their balance by almost 1 million ETH worth $1.7 billion since the beginning of May, bringing it to 20.6 million ETH. Similarly, the cohort with a balance of 1 million to 10 million ETH in their wallet sold off over 200 million ETH in the same duration.\n\nEthereum whales\u2019 balance\n\nThis selling began first after Ethereum price posted two back-to-back red candles towards the end of April, noting a 4% drop, which could\u2019ve convinced these cohorts that a decline was on the way. This resulted in the selling noted above. However, some others saw it as an opportunity to churn some gains and accumulated ETH before the market recovered. (ref. ETH/USD 1-day chart)\n\nAs per the total supply present on cryptocurrency exchanges, at the beginning of the month, exchange wallets held about 13 million ETH. However, at the time of writing, this supply came down to 12.4 million ETH, suggesting about 600,00 ETH worth $1.07 billion was picked up by investors.\n\nEthereum supply on exchanges\n\nInterestingly, intentional or not, this accumulation ended up preventing a further decline in Ethereum price. Although the second-generation cryptocurrency is slightly below the $1,800 mark, it is still holding its own, keeping above $1,700.\n\nThis price level coincides with the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which acts as the critical resistance for the cryptocurrency. Although it cannot be said with absolute certainty, looking at the market, there is a chance that ETH might recover before falling further.\n\nETH/USD 1-day chart\n\nNevertheless, a decline to the $1,700 mark only warrants a 5.5% drawdown and losing this level could result in the Ethereum price falling to March lows of $1,430. As it is, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is in the bearish zone below the 50.0 neutral mark, further increasing the odds of a decline."

        "content": "The Ethereum price consolidation weakened as the bulls lost momentum, resulting in a nearly 4% loss in the last 24 hours and a 7% decline on the weekly chart. The technical analysis indicates considerable bearish pressure.\n\nThe coin\u2019s value remained stagnant at around $1,800, leading to waning interest from buyers and a significant decrease in demand and accumulation. As Bitcoin dropped below $26,000, major altcoins also experienced significant declines on their daily charts.\n\nTo break its resistance, Ethereum requires substantial buyer participation, as failure to do so could lead to the loss of a crucial support level.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin must recover and reach the $27,000 zone to initiate a short-term recovery for ETH. The declining market capitalization of Ethereum suggests a gradual departure of buyers from the market.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: One-Day Chart\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was priced at $1,770. After struggling around the $1,800 range, selling pressure eventually took over. The coin\u2019s resistance levels were identified at $1,798 and $1,821. Conversely, if the price continues to decline, the bulls will attempt to defend ETH at $1,740.\n\nHowever, a failure to hold above $1,740 would push Ethereum down to $1,690. A further drop would breach the $1,540 support line. Additionally, the recent session saw a significant increase in selling strength, reflected by the red volume of Ethereum traded.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nFollowing the decline from the $1,800 range, ETH has experienced a significant sell-off with a lack of recovery in buying strength. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) dipped below 40, suggesting a decrease in accumulation and nearing oversold territory.\n\nAdditionally, ETH dropped below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, indicating that sellers have been driving the market momentum. If ETH successfully surpasses the immediate resistance level, there is a possibility of moving above the 20-SMA line.\n\nSeveral technical indicators on the daily chart of Ethereum began showing sell signals. One of these indicators is the Awesome Oscillator, which not only reflects price momentum but also identifies potential trend reversals.\n\nIn this case, the indicator displayed growing red histograms below the half-line, indicating sell signals for the altcoin. This suggests a potential decline in price before any recovery takes place.\n\nAnother indicator, the Bollinger Bands, which reveal price fluctuation and volatility, started widening. This widening suggests that Ethereum could experience increased price volatility and fluctuations in the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nThis heightened volatility indicates the potential for significant price movements in either direction. Ethereum has to topple over its immediate resistance in order to stall the bears. In addition to that, broader market strength will also prove to be crucial for ETH.\n\nFeatured Image From UnSplash, Charts From TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDecrypting DeFi is Decrypt's DeFi email newsletter. (art: Grant Kempster)\n\nCrypto Twitter has been awash the past few weeks with talk of a strange new protocol called EigenLayer.\n\nSome are going as far as calling it the next Ethereum Meta, while others are already whipping up speculative airdrop guides. And at least one person is doing God\u2019s work, helping us all pronounce the project\u2019s name.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo, what in the hell is EigenLayer? Well, think of it as being like blockchain security-as-a-service.\n\nInstead of having to gather funds, hardware, and a series of validators to keep your newly-launched crypto project from getting 51% attacked (or worse), EigenLayer wants to put staked Ethereum back to work for you.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works.\n\nEthereum\u2019s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism means that the network is secured by economic incentives and penalties rather than massive warehouses of mining machines. So-called validators in such a network can join and begin earning ETH-denominated yield once they stake 32 ETH to the network. If, however, their validators go down or they behave maliciously by validating incorrect transactions, they\u2019ll be penalized; a portion of that 32 Ethereum gets taken away.\n\nFor reference, there\u2019s currently 19.7 million Ethereum enlisted to keep Ethereum secure, or about $34 billion today\u2014that\u2019s more than 16% of all Ethereum currently in circulation. Yes, it\u2019s a lot.\n\nEigenLayer takes this a step further by rehypothecating all that staked ETH to serve the same security purposes but for other, newer projects.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRehypothecation is basically another term for using the same money twice. And because that money\u2019s being used twice, stakers who opt-in will also enjoy an even higher yield. And the more projects that build (and gain traction), the more yield opted-in stakers can earn.\n\nGiven that the asset being staked here is also Ethereum, these other projects would also be Ethereum-based. EigenLayer\u2019s white paper includes bridge technologies and oracle providers that could all use this double-dipped Ethereum.\n\nIn many ways, this will also make the developers\u2019 deployment experience far easier, providing confidence that their pet project will ultimately be backed by the market\u2019s second-largest crypto network.\n\nIt\u2019s an odd, very crypto-native idea, but as mentioned, it\u2019s got a lot of folks fired up. ConsenSys founder Joe Lubin said EigenLayer is \u201cat the forefront of some of the most exciting work happening in Ethereum.\u201d\n\nAnd in March, the project raised $50 million in a Series A round from a host of notable investors.\n\nIt\u2019s early days, of course. For now, though, all eyes are on Eigen.\n\nDecrypting DeFi is our DeFi newsletter, led by this essay. Subscribers to our emails get to read the essay before it goes on the site. Subscribe here."

Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nDespite a small midweek growth spurt on news that the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s inflation readings were lower than expected, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) entered the weekend with moderate losses over the last seven days.\n\nBitcoin is down 7.9% and trades for $26,817. Even the news that the Principality of Liechtenstein will soon accept it as payment for state services could not stop the biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization from posting a larger loss than Ethereum this week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin has had to compete with a rising dollar this week. The cryptocurrency typically has an inverse relationship with the dollar so the latter\u2019s rise over the last two days has manifested in a pullback in Bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\nThe use of Bitcoin for Ordinals NFTs also appears to be slowing down, with trading volume dropping by 50% on May 11 and remaining far short of its range throughout most of May, according to the Dune dashboard of blockchain analyst Domo.\n\nBitcoin transaction fees also hit a brief two-year high on Tuesday when the average price hit $31.14, according to data by BitInfoCharts. That figure is now back under $10.\n\nEthereum dipped 5.8% over the seven days and currently changes hands at $1,800. It\u2019s one of lighter dips in a week where, broadly speaking, the damage was light across the market.\n\nCryptocurrencies that dipped more than 8% this week include Polygon (MATIC), which fell 11.5% to $0.856058, Avalanche (AVAX) dropped 11% to $15.01, Toncoin (TON) sank 11.8% to $1.85, and Internet Computer (ICP) dropped 9.2% to trade at $5.16.\n\nIn the news...\n\nOn Monday, American crypto exchange Bittrex filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The news comes weeks after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged the company with failing to register as a broker-dealer, exchange, and clearing agency and said the agency netted at least $1.3 billion in illicit revenue between 2017 and 2022.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBack in March, Bittrex said it was winding down U.S. operations, with CEO Richie Lai citing the \"current U.S. regulatory and economic environment\" as reasons for the decision.\n\nAt a hearing in Washington on Wednesday, Republican and Democrat lawmakers failed to find common ground over the extent to which new regulation is needed for digital assets. Their main difficulty is deciding whether a token should be considered a security or commodity, if the former, then regulatory jurisdiction would be given to the SEC, if the latter, it would go to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nThat same day, Texas lawmakers voted overwhelmingly in favor of an update to the state\u2019s Bill of Rights to include the right of the people to own, hold, and use digital currencies. It\u2019s still a long way from being passed though, and still has to pass one more vote in the House, one in the Senate and a people\u2019s vote.\n\nFinally on Thursday The U.S. Chamber of Commerce slammed the SEC for its regulation-by-enforcement approach toward the digital asset industry. It filed an amicus brief in support of Coinbase in the exchange\u2019s ongoing court petition to get the securities regulator to clarify its rules.\n\n\u201cThe SEC has deliberately muddied the waters by claiming sweeping authority over digital assets while deploying a haphazard, enforcement-based approach,\u201d the Chamber wrote. \u201cThis regulatory chaos is by design, not happenstance.\u201d"

Over the last few days, due to the hype around memecoins, gas prices on the Ethereum network surged.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nHowever, after the memecoin hype died down, gas fees on Ethereum declined. Over the last few days, the average gas price paid by Ethereum users fell from 155.84 ETH to 77.85 ETH.\n\nHow was ETH impacted?\n\nThis decline in gas prices could attract more users to the Ethereum network. Inasmuch, an increase in activity was observed.\n\nHowever, at press time, activity on the Ethereum network declined, as indicated by the low gas usage on the network. Another indicator of low activity was the decline in NFT trades.\n\nThe decline in gas prices could thus improve the sentiment around Ethereum. Due to the beacon chain debacle, people\u2019s perception of the protocol has turned negative.\n\nSome bumps in the road\n\nDevelopers have come out and explained the reasons as to why the issues on the network occurred. According to one of the developers, Potuz, the Ethereum network experienced a 25-minute loss of finality due to several valid but untimely attestations being broadcast. This stressed consensus clients, especially those on weaker hardware, causing them to struggle while following the chain.\n\nTo address this issue, Prysm has released a fix that ignores attestations with known old targets to prevent CPU stress and memory bloat. This maintains safety, as the ignored attestations will be processed as soon as the chain is seen.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nThese developments didn\u2019t have an immense impact on ETH\u2019s price. In the past few days, ETH\u2019s prices remained relatively stable. The velocity of ETH, during this period, increased, suggesting that the frequency with which ETH was being traded grew.\n\nHowever, network growth fell, indicating that interest in new addresses in ETH had fallen."

        "content": "In 2022, Ethereum formally adopted Proof of Stake (PoS) as a more secure and energy-efficient method to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain.\n\nPoS and other consensus mechanisms are integral to the security of a network. This shift has significant implications for the Ethereum ecosystem, particularly in terms of staking \u2013 the process of holding funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to support the operations of a blockchain network.\n\nRelated Reading: Will Listing Of Floki Inu On Brazil\u2019s Largest Exchange Boost Meme Coin\u2019s Price?\n\nWhile staking has been around for some time, several factors are now converging to potentially drive a significant increase in ETH staking. In fact, a leading staking service provider has predicted a surge in staking activity and has backed it up with compelling reasons.\n\nSo, what does this mean for Ethereum, and why is staking becoming such a critical part of its blockchain infrastructure?\n\nStaked Q2 Report Predicts Significant ETH Staking Rate Increase\n\nStaked, a research subsidiary of the Kraken exchange, has released its Q2 report, projecting that the ETH staking rate could see a significant increase of 20% to 35% over the next 12 to 18 months. This forecast was based on several factors, including the recent increase in average Ethereum staking yield from 5.2% to 5.8% on a year on year basis.\n\nMoreover, the Staked Q2 report\u2019s prediction of a significant increase in the ETH staking rate could also have broader implications for the cryptocurrency market as a whole. If more users begin staking their ETH, the circulating supply of the cryptocurrency will decrease, potentially leading to an increase in its price.\n\nThis, in turn, could have a ripple effect on the entire cryptocurrency market, making it a crucial trend to watch in the coming months.\n\nETH total market cap currently at $218 billion on the daily chart at TradingView.com\n\nWhat Increased ETH Staking Means For Investors\n\nOne of the most obvious benefits is that a higher staking yield means investors can earn more rewards for their staked ETH. This could be especially appealing to long-term investors who are looking to maximize their returns.\n\nAdditionally, the increase in staking could potentially lead to a decrease in the circulating supply of ETH, which could drive up its price. This means that investors who are holding ETH could see their holdings increase in value.\n\nBut the impact of increased ETH staking goes beyond just earning rewards and potential price increases. It also has a positive effect on the overall health and stability of the Ethereum network.\n\nBy staking their ETH, investors are essentially locking it up, making it more difficult for bad actors to attack the network. This makes the network more secure and trustworthy, which could attract more users and investors to the platform.\n\nSource: Coingecko\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of ETH stands at $1,798 according to CoinGecko, with a 2.4% rally in the past 24 hours. However, it\u2019s worth noting that ETH has experienced a seven-day slump of 8.5%, highlighting the volatility that is characteristic of the cryptocurrency market.\n\n-Featured image from Siam Blockchain\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "A staking service provider predicted the hike and backed it up with reasons.\n\nEther deposits have increased on the Beacon Chain, changing the course of stake effectiveness.\n\nStaking has become a critical element of Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] ecosystem since undergoing the transition from Proof-of-Work (PoW). And more recently, the Shanghai upgrade. According to the Staked Q2 report, the ETH stake rate could increase by 20% to 35% in the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nHigher than the former\n\nStaked, the research subsidiary of the Kraken exchange, noted that a lot of factors were considered before its projection. First, the report mentioned that the average Ethereum staking yield increased from 5.2% to 5.8% on a Quarter-To-Quarter (YoY) basis.\n\nStaking yield is defined as the estimated reward that validators get from committing their assets in order to maintain the security of a blockchain. Thus, implying an increase in participation in the activity.\n\nAlthough Staked admitted that Kraken was one of the first platforms to allow un-staking, the notable decreases in withdrawal queue could set Ethereum in motion for increased traction. The report noted:\n\n\u201cAverage daily deposits are now 6.5x higher than in April. There were more ETH staked in the six days after Shapella (750k) than the entire month of March (600k).\u201d\n\nHowever, it seems that the prediction by the leading provider of staking services to consumers and institutions could be well on track. This was because the validator rewards withdrawals on the Beacon Chain has significantly decreased.\n\nFor the unaccustomed, Ethereum created the Beacon Chain to ensure that the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus was effective enough to operate on the Mainnet. It is also the ledger responsible for coordinating the validation of\n\nstaked Ether [stETH]\n\non the network.\n\nPledges on the Beacon Chain\n\nIt was, however, a different case with Ether deposits on the consensus layer. At press time, this metric was as high as 58,800. Therefore, this means a large percentage of stakers were not yet willing to act in accordance with the withdrawal cycle conditions.\n\nFurthermore, the stake effectiveness also appeared to align with the projection.\n\nThis metric is the ratio of the total effective balance to the total staked balance. It also acts as a measure of the proportion of stETH actively participating in the consensus.\n\nSince its genesis, the stake effectiveness was on a consistent downward trend. But when the Ethereum Foundation announced Shanghai\u2019s success, the tides changed. At press time, the metric was 0.98.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nThis indicated that there has been a regular transfer of validator rewards to the Ethereum Mainnet and increased activity on the Beacon Chain.\n\nIn a case where the current momentum is sustained, then demand might increase. But whether it would be as high as predicted or not, depends largely on the participation rate."

Such thinking would have been unimaginable just six months ago, when the common consensus was that \"crypto winter\" would extend into much of 2023.\n\nBut are any cryptos really safe to buy right now? And, if so, which ones should investors be thinking about adding to their portfolios this month?\n\nBitcoin\n\nFirst up is Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), which is regaining its status as \"digital gold\" in the minds of many investors due to all the uncertainty in the market today. The correlation between Bitcoin and gold has been surging in recent months, and the growing consensus is that Bitcoin is probably the safest crypto to invest in right now. Of course, \"safest\" is a relative term, because we all know how risky and volatile Bitcoin can be. Last year, for example, the value of Bitcoin plummeted by nearly 65%.\n\nDollar dollar bill, y'all:Gen Z is using cash more than ever in the face of inflation\n\nBut one factor in Bitcoin's favor is its long track record, which has made it a favorite of both retail and institutional investors. Bitcoin, which was created back in 2013, has survived several different market crashes over the past decade, and has emerged stronger each time. Bitcoin continues to offer tremendous upside potential, based on the pace of its international adoption as both a form of payment and a store of value.\n\nIn fact, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest has modeled the long-term growth potential of this crypto and concluded that Bitcoin could soar past the $1.48 million price mark by 2030. Less aggressive estimates have Bitcoin hitting the $100,000 mark by the end of 2024. Thus, from my perspective, Bitcoin offers the optimal blend of risk and reward of any top cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum\n\nNext up is Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), which is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, trailing only Bitcoin. Ethereum offers investors a well-diversified ecosystem, with exposure to every key segment of the blockchain and crypto world. This includes non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), and blockchain gaming. Thus, by holding Ethereum, you are diversifying away some of the risk of holding crypto in your portfolio.\n\nMost impressively, Ethereum continues to upgrade its blockchain, ensuring that it remains the premier Layer 1 blockchain in the world. Last year, for example, Ethereum completed The Merge. This technological upgrade helped to make Ethereum faster, more efficient, and more scalable. And it prepared Ethereum for the next wave of growth in the blockchain world. And then, in March of this year, Ethereum came through again with Shapella (also known as \"Shanghai\"), another major upgrade to secure its status as a premier blockchain.\n\nAnd Ethereum shows no signs of stopping with future updates. Its founder, Vitalik Buterin, has already given investors a detailed roadmap for what's coming next in 2023 and 2024. The goal is to make Ethereum the highest-throughput, fastest, and most scalable blockchain in the world.\n\nSolana\n\nFor the third pick, I would have to go with Solana (CRYPTO: SOL), an Ethereum competitor with an $8.15 billion market cap. This is one of the few blockchain projects with the potential to outperform both Bitcoin and Ethereum this year. Year to date, Solana is already up 107%, which is more than Bitcoin (65%) and Ethereum (53%).\n\nWhile some might argue that this remarkable rebound in Solana is nothing more than a dead cat bounce after the FTX (CRYPTO: FTT) meltdown last year, there are several key steps that Solana has taken in 2023 that have me very optimistic about its future. One of these is the recent launch of Saga, the first-ever mobile phone by a major blockchain network. The Android-powered Saga has been described as a \"crypto phone\" due to its integration of crypto-friendly features. This mobile phone could be the key to Solana gaining a key foothold in the Web3 market, where Solana is preparing other initiatives.\n\nWhich crypto to buy first?\n\nIf there's one cryptocurrency to buy first this month, it's Bitcoin. As noted above, this is the one crypto that offers the optimal blend of risk and reward. This is an especially important consideration, given the economic headwinds swirling around the market right now. Thus far, at least, Bitcoin has proven to be a safe haven asset worth holding at a time when America's regional banks seem to be failing on a frequent basis.\n\nBut if you're really looking to outperform the market, that's when it's time to explore the altcoins that are much smaller (and hence, much riskier) than either Bitcoin or Ethereum. My personal pick is Solana, which has already skyrocketed to triple-digit gains in 2023. Solana comes with its share of drawbacks -- such as continued concerns about network stability -- but is a blockchain that I think is building a long-term future in the crypto world.\n\nDominic Basulto has positions in Bitcoin and Ethereum.

        "title": "Ethereum gas fees at 10-month high! Investors excited about 100x Meme Coins DigiToads and Pepe - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s gas fees recently surged up to a 10-month high, mainly off the back of increased buyer demand for ER20 tokens like PEPE, which saw 21,000% gains in just a few days. While nobody wants increased gas fees, we do want gains for our portfolio, and the altcoin growth season looks to be well underway. Other tokens like DigiToads are gaining momentum and could be about to explode like PEPE. That\u2019s why investors are licking their lips at the potential they see with the TOADS ecosystem. It could soon rival some of the bigger altcoins on the market. Here\u2019s why:\n\nDigiToads (TOADS)\n\nDigiToads has already been impressing industry onlookers in its early presale stages. And the good news is that there\u2019s still plenty of time left if you want to be part of TOADS\u2019 top ico, with price increases built in to guarantee you profits before it officially launches thanks to a presale model that\u2019s hard to beat.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all: the TOADS ecosystem will become the go-to P2E meme coin in the crypto world thanks to multiple ways to earn as part of a fun and rewarding environment that continues to attract more investors every day. So if you want to train, battle, and win with your unique DigiToad companions as part of the swamp battle arena, look no further than TOADS. Funds to help support the TOADS model are raised via a sales tax on transactions and then paid out to competitors every season in the form of TOADS tokens. You can also stake popular NFTs as part of the ecosystem for an extra way to earn long-term passive income. Investors continue to flock to the DigiToads world, and now is the perfect time to invest if you want to enjoy all these benefits and more while TOADS becomes the biggest meme coin player in town.\n\n>> Buy DigiToads Now <<\n\nPepe (PEPE)\n\nPEPE\u2019s recent massive surge in price shocked the market, as people haven\u2019t seen this level of price gains since the likes of Doge and Shib. While increased buyer demand has caused an upswing in ETH gas fees, this is seen as a positive for the wider alt coin world, and provides a new level of confidence that we could be entering the next bull season. Pepe is perfectly placed to lead the way at the front of any bull run, but there might be more room for profits with tokens like TOADS, since it has more room to grow.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nLast year\u2019s merge to ETH 2.0 was supposed to fix high gas-fee issues, and while it went a long way in addressing them\u2014recent buyer demand has shown that they can still become expensive. While ETH might not be the best investment right now when it comes to price action, it\u2019s still the backbone of the defi token world and home to countless innovative projects on its blockchain. That\u2019s why there will always be a place for ETH in the crypto world, and there should arguably always be a place for it as part of a diversified portfolio.\n\nConclusion\n\nPEPE\u2019s rise to glory caused Ethereum fees to surge, but this was good news for the crypto world: it shows massive gains are still possible. And TOADS is perfectly placed to be the next big meme coin breakout star, which is why you should seriously consider it for your portfolio immediately. Many experts believe it could be the next big thing in the crypto space, and discounts are still available during the groundbreaking TOADS presale.\n\nFor more information on DigiToads visit the website, join the presale or join the community for regular updates.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "3 Best Crypto To Buy Now: Cardano (ADA), Ethereum (ETH), And Collateral Network (COLT) - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "After its recent Shapella Upgrade, Ethereum (ETH) has become more popular than ever. Investors are staking Ethereum (ETH) at record rates, and the number of Ethereum investors has grown on both centralized and decentralized exchanges. Now, Cardano (ADA) and Collateral Network (COLT) are expected to follow this trend, with Collateral Network (COLT) on track for a 3500% increase in value.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) Stage One Is Close To Selling Out\n\nWith 60% of Collateral Network\u2019s stage one presale already sold out, tokens are being purchased at record rates before COLT increases from $0.014 to $0.0168. This would mark a return of 68% for investors who purchased early and is just a fraction of the 3500% ROI predicted by analysts.\n\nCollateral Network removes many of the unnecessary barriers and complexities of the crowdlending process. Instead of requiring extensive credit checks and copious amounts of paperwork, individuals looking to unlock cash from physical assets can bring them on-chain using Collateral Network and unlock liquidity against them, with the asset acting as collateral.\n\nEach asset is brought on-chain as a fractionalized NFT and sold to the Collateral Network community, which becomes lenders to fund the loan. In return, lenders receive a weekly passive income. Once funded, borrowers can receive cash in just 24 hours without impacting their credit rating.\n\nSmart contracts and AI are used throughout Collateral Network (COLT) to provide flexible and competitive rates as well as transparency and security, with 2FA security features being used for transactions.\n\nCollateral Network has a long-term roadmap and has been fully vetted and doxxed, with token liquidity locked for 33 years to prevent a rug pull.\n\nThe platform will accept a number of assets, including fine art, private jets, rare whiskers, diamonds, premium timepieces, and more. Just 38% of the Collateral Network (COLT) token supply will be available during its presale, with early investors being granted access to exclusive auctions for distressed assets, voting rights, and trading discounts. Following its 3500% rise, industry experts predict that Collateral Network (COLT) could rise an additional 100x after hitting mainstream exchanges worldwide.\n\nEthereum Dips Below $1.9, But Trading Volume Continues To Boom\n\nEthereum trading activity has boomed following its recent upgrade, which allowed Ethereum stakers to withdraw their assets. While some analysts believe this could have triggered turbulence, the upgrade has done quite the opposite. In just two weeks, over 100,000 Ethereum (ETH) was staked, with more investors staking Ethereum than withdrawing it.\n\nThat being said, recent memecoin activity caused the price of Ethereum trading fees to rocket, which has caused Ethereum (ETH) to drop in price by 1.03% in the last week. One Ether (ETH) is currently available for $1,847.01, at the time of writing, with over $5.8 billion worth of Ethereum transactions taking place daily.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCardano (ADA) Drops To $0.35 Though Analysts Predict A Bounce Back\n\nCardano is quickly becoming a key player in the crypto space. It recently introduced its Hydra Scaling Solution and has also started to influence the P2E gaming space with a number of Cardano-based games. In April alone, over 65 million Cardano transactions took place, with Cardano continuing to dominate transaction volume in May.\n\nAt the time of writing, one Cardano (ADA) was selling for $0.3582, a 7.72% decrease in the last month. Market experts believe this Cardano decline has been caused by the recent crash in Bitcoin (BTC); however, they expect Cardano to bounce back in the next few weeks, potentially surging in value as Cardano\u2019s influence on DeFi continues to grow.\n\nFor more information on Collateral Network visit the website, join the presale or join the community for regular updates.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Ethereum investors are increasingly choosing to self-custody their ETH.\n\nExchange ETH holdings have low numbers not seen since genesis.\n\nETH is down 7.2% in the past week.\n\nCentralized crypto exchanges are one of the most popular places to trade and hold digital assets. However, the FTX blowup last year spurred an exodus from centralized exchanges to self-custody.\n\nThe migration to self-custody has been so strong that ETH held on exchanges has reached low levels that haven\u2019t been since genesis.\n\nETH Holdings on Exchanges Hit All-Time Low\n\nETH is one of the most popular crypto assets in the industry. The second largest cryptocurrency has a $214 billion market cap and has recently entered a deflationary period.\n\nETH is also an asset that investors value and choose to self-custody instead of holding it on centralized exchanges. In fact, according to data from Santiment, ETH held on centralized exchanges has just hit an all-time low.\n\nCurrently, only 10.1% of all ETH in circulation is being held on centralized exchanges. This means that the remaining 89.9% of ETH is held by investors in self-custody wallets.\n\n\ud83d\udc5b As #Ethereum has dipped to $1,780 today, we've seen exchange supply continue to decrease. The percentage of $ETH on exchanges is at its lowest (10.1%) since public trading began in 2015. This is essentially the #AllTimeHigh for non-exchange holdings. https://t.co/WVmeAJhhMM pic.twitter.com/eMXoRh9R76 \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 11, 2023\n\nWhat\u2019s more interesting is that 10.1% of ETH held on exchanges is the lowest since public trading of ETH began in 2015. That\u2019s despite the fact that ETH has been experiencing a slump in the past week.\n\nETH Goes Down\n\nETH has been one of the best-performing assets since the start of the year. However, in the past week or so, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain has gone down significantly.\n\nAccording to data from CoinGecko, ETH is down 3.1% on the day and 7.2% in the past week. ETH is currently trading at $1,766.\n\nETH price chart. Source: CoinGecko.\n\nETH is trading below the levels before the Shapella upgrade was activated on mainnet on April 12. Shapella is the upgrade that enabled staked ETH withdrawals for the first time since 2020.\n\nMany saw Shappela as bearish for the price of ETH. However, ETH skyrocketed more than $200 on the successful upgrade and even broke the $2,100 mark.\n\nSince then ETH was trading sideways until the last few days. ETH, together with the whole crypto market, has gone down significantly. The total market cap of all cryptocurrencies now is $1.15 trillion, according to CoinGecko.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nETH has been deflationary ever since The Merge last August. However, in the past week or so, amid the memecoin mania, ETH has been super deflationary. For example, in the past seven days, over 66,000 ETH has been burned.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nETH is one of the most used cryptocurrency assets. The drama surrounding centralized exchanges has shown the importance of self-custody at all times.\n\nRead more about Polygon being pushed out of the top 10 cryptocurrencies:\n\nPolygon (MATIC) Pushed Out of Top 10 Cryptocurrencies by Solana (SOL)\n\nRead more about Ethereum OFAC-compliant blocks:\n\nEthereum\u2019s OFAC-Compliant Blocks Drop to 27%: What Does It Mean?"

        "content": "Ethereum has so far put up a tremendous run in 2021. Its price has hit multiple all-time highs this year, cementing it as one of the best digital assets to be invested in for the year. Major upgrades to the network like the London hard fork have seen the project move towards a deflationary mechanism, creating scarcity in the asset by burning one-third of the fees issued on the network.\n\nThe ETH mining industry also felt the heat when the Chinese government had begun its crackdown on crypto mining in the middle of the year. Like bitcoin, its mining revenue had been affected by the crackdown. However, ETH did not suffer as much as bitcoin did from this move. Hence, miners of the asset have seen good returns on their activity. The difference has been evident in the mining revenue between bitcoin and ethereum miners.\n\nEthereum Outpaces Bitcoin Mining\n\nMining revenues between Ethereum and bitcoin mining show a discrepancy in their figures. For one, Ethereum miners have definitely had the more profitable year out of the two. Although not a very wide gap, it is still a notable difference in the returns from both assets. While ETH miners saw a total of $17 billion in revenue from their mining activities, bitcoin miners only saw $13.6 billion.\n\nRelated Reading | Goldman Sachs Analysts Shoot For Ethereum At $8,000 With Expected 80% Rally\n\nVolatility between the two assets has also played into how the figures have turned out. Bitcoin mining is associated with high volatility. Yet, ETH has it beat as the asset with the most volatility. ETH mining volatility sat at a staggering 47% compared to bitcoin\u2019s 28%. This volatility in daily revenues plays a big role in the revenue figures for ETH miners.\n\nETH outpaces BTC mining metrics | Source: Arcane Research\n\nThe average daily revenue for BTC mining is $45 million. For ETH, this figure is $56 million. In metrics like average fee percentage of daily revenue and revenue correlation with fees, ETH also recorded higher figures.\n\nETH price trading above $4,500 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nETH Fees Go UP\n\nSince Ethereum miners\u2019 revenues are largely dependent on fees, the rate of sending transactions on the network greatly affects the mining revenue. As such, ETH\u2019s volatile fee nature can play a positive or negative role in the revenue returns of miners. When fees go up, so do the revenue returns for miners go up, and vice versa. Furthermore, ETH miners usually have a short window where they can collect the revenues, represented by the 0.55% fee correlation shown above.\n\nRelated Reading | PayPal Co-Founder Says Bitcoin Price Points To Crisis In The Economy\n\nThis correlation has played in the favor of ETH miners this year. The growing popularity and adoption of decentralized finance and NFTs have seen fees skyrocket on the network. Being largely dependent on fee revenue, miners have benefitted the most from this spike. Despite the fee burn, rewards for miners on the blockchain are up for the year.\n\nETH mining revenue from fees sits at 53% | Source: Arcane Research\n\nCompared to Ethereum, transaction fees on the bitcoin network have remained mostly low since the bull rally ended in April. ETH miner revenues were made up of 53% of fees for the year. Meanwhile, transaction fees only contributed 1% to the total miner revenue for bitcoin.\n\nFeatured image from Crypto News Flash, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "After exceptionally positive price surges during March and April, it seems that the bears might be heading back into the crypto town after Bitcoin broke beneath the April lows this week, dragging the number one ranked cryptocurrency as low as $26,840. Unfortunately, the fresh monthly low for Bitcoin has stalled any potential market growth in the altcoin sector as it drags the entire industry lower.\n\nEthereum is in the same boat after losing ground at $1,800 today. The cryptocurrency has set a fresh monthly low, dipping as low as $1,740 today. Despite the looming market crash, it seems that traders are starting to hedge their bets by buying into crypto presales during the dip as a method of parking their cash until the retracement is complete \u2013 evidenced by the overwhelmingly high fundraising milestones in the presale figures.\n\nWith the market heading lower, here is an Ethereum price prediction alongside three of the best crypto crash coins to buy in this coming dip.\n\nETH Price Prediction: Will Ethereum Break the April 2023 Lows Next?\n\nEthereum has seen a remarkable price performance over the past two months after surging by over 50% from the March lows of $1,370 to reach the peak of $2,140 in April. Unfortunately, the bulls couldn\u2019t push ETH above the April highs, and the market started trading in a range between $2,000 and $1,790.\n\nDespite the bearish sentiment, Ethereum is still on a bullish trajectory after surging as much as 55% from the 2023 opening price to the current price level;\n\nThe chart above shows Ethereum throughout 2023. We can clearly see the upward price swing from the start of the year has stalled since hitting the April highs. Over the past fortnight, Ethereum has traded sideways between $2,000 and $1,790, but today\u2019s break beneath the range indicates a short-term bearish trend.\n\nLooking ahead, if the sellers break the current support at $1,750 \u2013 provided by a .5 Fibonacci Retracement level the next support lies at $1,700 (July 2021 lows). This is followed up with support at $1,650 (June 2021 Lows) and $1,590. If the sellers continue to drive ETH lower, further support is located at $1,510 (March 2021 lows), $1,490, and $1,370 (March 2023 lows).\n\nOn the other side, the first level of resistance lies at $1,910. This is followed by $2,000, $2,060, $2,100, $2,160, and $2,2200.\n\nUnfortunately, the RSI is sitting beneath the midline, indicating that the sellers are in control of the market momentum. If the RSI continues to dip, we can expect the bearish momentum to increase and drag Ethereum beneath the April 2023 lows.\n\nAre Traders Hedging Bets by Dumping ETH to Buy Low Cap Crypto Presales\n\nWhile the bull market starts to show signs of weakness, it looks like traders are beginning to hedge their bets by selling ETH to invest in some low-cap crypto presales. This is evidenced by the fact that some presales are gaining significant momentum as their fundraising figures cross multiple millions in investment.\n\nHere are three top crypto presales active today that are worth investing in for significant gains down the line while the market retraces.\n\nAiDoge \u2013 Combining Memes and Artificial Intelligence to Create a Meme-to-Earn Ecosystem\n\nAiDoge is one of the hottest presales in town after its presale crossed the $6 million fundraising milestone this week. Investors are rushing to this presale because it combines two of the hottest trends in crypto right now \u2013 memes and artificial intelligence. Combining these trends has created a revolutionary meme-to-earn ecosystem where users are rewarded for creating epic memes that go viral across the internet.\n\nThe project has created a groundbreaking meme-generation platform that utilizes artificial intelligence to allow users with no artistic experience to create legendary memes. It\u2019s the first cryptocurrency project in the industry that uses artificial intelligence to create memes. The team behind the project wants to merge meme culture with AI technology to create a novel AI meme rewards platform.\n\nCreate Legendary Memes in Seconds and Earn Rewards\n\nThe team behind the project has made the process of meme creation extremely straightforward, providing users with a friendly interface where memes can be created using simple text-based prompts. These prompts are short descriptions written by the user to describe the type of meme they want to generate. The artificial intelligence will use this description to generate a ready-to-publish meme in a matter of seconds.\n\nThe innovative part of the project is that the artificial intelligence used to generate the memes has been trained on an extensive dataset of memes and crypto news, meaning that it knows exactly what type of memes users want to generate. Furthermore, the team will keep updating the AI with the latest news so it\u2019s always up-to-date to create timely memes.\n\nOnce a meme has been generated, it\u2019s sent straight to the Public Wall, a virtual space where users can upvote or downvote their favorite memes. Memes that rise to the top of the Public Wall are eligible to receive rewards in the native token each month to incentivize engagement in the platform. As a result, users are forced to think outside the box and use the AI to its fullest potential to create the best memes possible.\n\nThe presale for AiDoge is currently sitting in the ninth stage, selling the token for a price of $0.0000292. So far, it\u2019s raised over $6 million in fundraising and shows no signs of slowing down. The presale uses an increasing pricing strategy, meaning that the price for $AI will increase during each stage. For example, in the tenth stage, the price for the token rises to $0.0000296 and will continue to increase across the planned twenty stages. Therefore, getting invested as early as possible is essential to leave the fundraising with higher levels of unrealized gains.\n\nThe best part about investing in this token is that it\u2019s required to access the meme generator, giving it great utility. For example, users that wish to generate memes must purchase credits from the store using $AI tokens, helping to secure ongoing development and ecosystem sustainability.\n\nOverall, there\u2019s a solid reason why lots of ETH is being injected into AiDoge. Most investors are expecting huge returns from this project, with some even anticipating a 100x gain;\n\nBuy AiDoge Today\n\nyPredict \u2013 A Revolutionary AI-Powered Analytics Platform for Better Trading Decisions\n\nThe next crypto presale generating significant traction is yPredict, a next-generation AI-based trading research and analysis platform that provides traders with data-driven insights to help them make better trading decisions. With financial markets losing their predictability due to the increased usage of bots and algorithms, traders are losing their statistical edge in the market. yPredict intends to change this by providing state-of-the-art financial prediction models and metrics that help traders make better trading decisions.\n\nThe ecosystem is filled with artificial intelligence and machine learning experts, financial quants, and traders, who have grouped together to create a suite of products to help traders make wiser decisions when trading. The primary features of the platform are:\n\nThe prediction model marketplace.\n\nA trading analytics platform.\n\nA trading terminal.\n\nA high APY staking pool.\n\nThe best part about the platform is that it connects developers and traders together, allowing developers to provide a subscription-based model to list their financial prediction models in a results-as-a-service-based economy.\n\nyPred Ecosystem Provides Utility for YPRED Holders\n\nThe presale is currently selling the YPRED token at a price of $0.05 in its fourth stage. The native token behind the platform is essential to the ecosystem as it\u2019s required to access the trading analytics and is needed to subscribe to the prediction models on the marketplace.\n\nAll holders of YPRED are granted exclusive access to the yPredict Analytics platform, which helps them regain an edge in the market. The yPredict Analytics platform offers a new breed of trading tools that are entirely powered by AI that include pattern recognition, sentiment analysis, and indicator analysis. The AI is capable of alerting traders to potential breakouts and emerging trends before they happen, allowing them to get invested before the market moves.\n\nFurthermore, the YPRED token is also required to subscribe to the subscription-based financial models in the yPredict Marketplace. Developers can utilize their skills in finance to list their prediction models in a results-as-a-service, allowing traders to subscribe to them on a monthly basis using YPRED tokens. Through the revenue generated, 70% goes directly to the developer, with the remaining 30% being injected back into the ecosystem.\n\nThe subscription model makes YPRED an attractive investment opportunity as it provides great utility with room for price growth as the ecosystem grows. There are a total of 100 million YPRED tokens, with half of the total supply being locked when the token is listed \u2013 making it an undervalued project with great growth potential from launch.\n\nAgain, the presale uses a rising pricing strategy, meaning it\u2019s best to get invested earlier to take advantage of the higher unrealized gains when the presale ends.\n\nBuy YPRED Today\n\nLaunchpad.xyz \u2013 Find the Next Best Web3 Emerging Trend to Invest In\n\nThe next best crypto coin to buy in this coming crash is Launchpad.xyz, a platform that provides all the tools a user would need to be successful in the Web3 space. Launchpad.xyz describes itself as the solution to Web3 and provides insights and learning, trading alpha analytics, and strategy to find the next best Web3 emerging trend to invest in.\n\nThe project is on a mission to revolutionize how everybody invests in Web3 by providing one dashboard to analyze and invest from. The platform intends to help users look beyond NFTs (although they can find great NFT opportunities there) in Web3 to look for investment opportunities. It offers smart data, analytics, and insights on crypto and NFT investments \u2013 all in one place.\n\nThe goal of the platform is to humanize how people interact with the Web3 space by making the interface more inviting, inclusive, and easy to use \u2013 helping beginners overcome technical jargon.\n\nUse AI to Rank the Best Web3 Investment Opportunities.\n\nUsers can find the next best NFTs, fractionalized assets, utility tokens, presales, P2E ecosystems, metaverses, or crypto tokens on the platform. In addition, Launchpad.xyz provides an unbiased window into the latest Web3 investment opportunities. Its central portal helps individuals identify products relative to their interests to let them engage with as little friction as possible.\n\nThe best feature behind the platform is that all the best Web3 investment opportunities are ranked using an artificial intelligence alright, Launchpad Quotient (LQ). The LQ provides users with a single value to denote the risk-to-reward opportunity with any Web3 project. Using up to 400 data points, the LQ will provide a listing of the top opportunities using its bespoke AI model to help find emerging patterns to alert users.\n\nAlongside finding the best Web3 opportunities, Launchpad.xyz also contains a decentralized exchange, a Web3 wallet, and a trading terminal \u2013 meaning users don\u2019t need to leave the platform to interact with Web3 projects on different platforms. Instead, they can simply connect their wallets and invest straight from the Launchpad.xyz interface.\n\nLaunchpad.xyz is currently hosting a presale for its native token LPX. The token is required to access the platform in a stake-to-access subscription service, providing utility and demand for the native token. The presale has raised a total of $300,000 and is currently selling the token at $0.07. However, it\u2019s also using a rising pricing mechanism, so it\u2019s best to get invested as early as possible to take advantage of the low prices.\n\nBuy LPX Today\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum, Dogecoin, Bitcoin Drop: How PAT WARS' Presale Can Benefit Investors During Crypto Market Turbulence - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The crypto market has been experiencing significant turbulence recently, with insiders selling off Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) and transactions slowing down. This has caused the prices of these major cryptocurrencies to plummet, leaving seasoned investors wondering how to safeguard their investments. In this article, we will explore how investing in presale projects during market uncertainties can be beneficial, specifically in the case of PAT WARS (PAWS).\n\nETH And BTC Drop: How And Why\n\nOver the weekend and into Monday, the crypto market experienced a drop in prices, with insiders selling Ethereum and Bitcoin and transactions slowing down. Bitcoin fell due to Binance temporarily closing withdrawals, causing a backlog of transactions, while Ethereum prices fell after the Ethereum Foundation transferred nearly $30 million of tokens to the Kraken exchange.\n\nOther altcoins also experienced losses, with some down by double digits. The rapid recovery of cryptocurrency assets seen in recent months may have contributed to profit-taking. However, the high gas fees on Ethereum and Bitcoin are becoming an issue, making them almost unusable for smaller transactions. The crypto industry has seen improvements, but investors remain concerned about future drops in the market.\n\nA New Hope For Crypto: PAT WARS\u2019 Presale\n\nEver since its presale was launched, PAT WARS (PAWS) has been rapidly gaining popularity. This particular meme coin is designed specifically for cat lovers and Star Wars fans, much like other memecoins that target specific audiences such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. The PAT WARS clan consists of Jedi warrior cats that serve as the project\u2019s mascots. These cute feline creatures are one with the force of crypto, offering sage advice for those who come to them and using their great knowledge to construct their platform.\n\nDespite the intimidating world of crypto, PAT WARS is \u2013 first and foremost \u2013 committed to empowering its community by fostering strong bonds through its DAO and NFT collection, the first of which enables members to carry out votes and make decisions regarding the trajectory of PAT WARS, and the second offers exclusive content and opportunities for the community to bond over. The project is also focused on constant innovation and improvement, with its security and speed being enhanced by being built on the Ethereum network.\n\nPepe Coin Threatens Dogecoin\u2019s Status\n\nCrypto analyst LilMoonLambo recently suggested in a tweet that Pepe Coin (PEPE) could replace Dogecoin (DOGE) as a market sentiment indicator. LilMoonLambo proposed that a surge in the price of PEPE would signal a bullish trend in the broader market. Over the past few days, some large-scale investors or \u201ccrypto whales,\u201d including \u201cMachi Big Brother,\u201d have reportedly been purchasing significant amounts of PEPE, with its price standing at $0.00000193 as of now. However, some analysts have expressed concerns that the current frenzy surrounding meme coins like PEPE could be harmful to Bitcoin\u2019s performance. Despite this, PEPE still holds a market cap of over $809 million, even after it recently decreased from its all-time high.\n\nAs larger and more established coins struggle to keep their status and value, one might turn towards investing in smaller and newer projects. PAT WARS\u2019 presale can be a buoy in this market turbulence and can be an effective way to diversify one\u2019s portfolio and hedge against losses in other crypto assets. Plus, when a project is this new, the price of a token is so low that any loss would be minuscule, while gains can be quite high.\n\nLet the feline force flow through you and join the PAT WARS presale now:\n\nPresale: https://www.patwars.com/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://www.patwars.com/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/PATWARSOfficial\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PATWARSOfficial\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "You\u2019ve found the perfect spot if you\u2019re a meme or altcoin fan looking for the next big thing. This article will evaluate Big Eyes Coin (BIG), NEAR, and Ethereum (ETH). Which will be the ultimate meme coin?\n\nBig Eyes Coin \u2013 The FOMO Cure\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is a cryptocurrency that functions similarly to other meme coins, with its value determined by community enthusiasm and FOMO. But what distinguishes it from the competition? Although Big Eyes Coin has a purrfect cat crew, it takes pleasure in being the \u201cunderdog\u201d of the meme coin space, promoting itself as a genuinely community-driven enterprise.\n\nBig Eyes Coin, with a devoted staff and an engaged community, has the potential to become the next Dogecoin or Shiba Inu killer. Will it, however, live up to the hype?\n\nAt this point, the answer is simply YES; it definitely can, but in a crypto world, you need facts, and we can\u2019t be dull, so here are the facts.\n\nThe presale has so far raised $35.4 million. Big Eyes Coin is designed to help the community, which has been demonstrated through donating $15,926 to charity organisations.\n\nAnd if you think this is great, there is still more. As the presale is still taking place and will end on the 3rd of June, everyone can enter the promo code END300 at checkout for a 300% bonus.\n\nThe Big Eyes team is going BIG once again. The BIG Casino is about to be launched on August 29th, 2023; a gaming and betting website where you may play and earn BIG. Anyone can participate in the games by converting their crypto holdings into BIG tokens. This will increase the daily trade volume, the number of legitimate BIG holders, and the market capitalisation as the casino and P2E activities expand.\n\nNEAR Protocol (NEAR): The Altcoin for Scalable and Interoperable Decentralised Apps\n\nNEAR Protocol (NEAR) is another fascinating altcoin gaining traction in cryptocurrency. NEAR is also compatible with Ethereum.\n\nNEAR was created to make it simple for developers to construct blockchain-based decentralised apps (dApps). Because the platform is designed for scalability and interoperability, it is a popular choice among investors and developers.\n\nNEAR allows you to be a part of the future of fintech while supporting a thriving and innovative community. Near Protocol (NEAR) has had a significant price gain in recent months, with its native token presently trading at $1.93, up from $1.25 in early January 2023. But are they near to exploding the altcoin season? Time will tell.\n\nWhat a Terrific Time to be Optimistic About Ethereum\n\nEthereum (ETH) is one of the most well-known cryptocurrencies in the world. ETH is a decentralised platform that allows smart contracts and dApps to be developed and run without interruption or influence from a third party.\n\nETH is intended to be used as digital money, but it also has many other applications. It is quick, safe, and has various features, making it a popular choice among investors and developers. While not a meme coin, ETH is a significant participant in banking and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe most crucial aspect of meme coins is the project\u2019s community. Big Eyes Coin is a blossoming community of meme currency enthusiasts and investors thrilled about the project\u2019s potential. Ethereum, on the other hand, has a more established community but is not expressly designed for meme currencies.\n\nAnother critical aspect to consider is transaction speed and costs. NEAR is intended to be scalable, and its transaction costs are far lower than Ethereum. This makes it a more appealing platform for meme currencies that demand quick and inexpensive transfers.\n\nIt is difficult to precisely anticipate the price of any cryptocurrency or meme coin. However, Big Eyes Coin has the potential to be a top 10 meme coin based on current market trends and the excitement surrounding it.\n\nClick to know more about Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale:https://buy1.bigeyes.space/?source=RWfuttKewL\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nOpenSea: https://opensea.io/collection/big-eyes-lootbox-cards\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BigEyesCoin\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Binance: big news on BETH crypto - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Binance has just made an important announcement: from 18 May, all BETH crypto redeems within the exchange will be processed in just 5 days, significantly reducing the wait for users to redeem their ETH.\n\nBETH represents a liquid version of Ethereum stakes on Binance, where users can use it as liquidity while waiting to redeem ETH from the Beacon chain.\n\nBinance and the decision to reduce the wait time to redeem BETH crypto\n\nAs previously announced, Binance announced yesterday that as of 18 May at 08:00 UTC, all redemption requests for the BETH crypto, the liquid staking version of Ethereum, will be processed in just 5 days.\n\nThis is great news for users of the crypto exchange, as the average wait time to redeem stacked ETHs is currently around 15 days.\n\n#Binance will reduce the processing time for $ETH Staking withdrawals to 5 days from the original 15 days.https://t.co/2cLwhAHp1m \u2014 Binance (@binance) May 11, 2023\n\nThe decision to shorten the withdrawal processing timeframe is based on a commitment to providing the best end-user experience in a service where wait times are not only dependent on Binance, but also and most importantly on the traffic and participants within the Beacon Chain.\n\nIt is curious to note that, in fact, new validator activations far outnumber exit requests these days.\n\nSpecifically, there are 41,455 validators waiting to join the Beacon Chain, in a queue that will be cleared in approximately 23 days, while on the other side there are only 40 validators who will have completed the exit process within the next half hour.\n\nIn recent days, the number of outgoing validators has also dropped to zero.\n\nThis fact, along with the ability of the user side to withdraw their staked ETHs more quickly, either directly on the ETH 2.0 platform or through intermediaries such as Binance, reinforces the narrative of the longevity and resilience of the Ethereum network.\n\nAt the time of writing, the number of locked coins within the Beacon chain has reached a new all-time high of 19,767,969 ETH, easing selling pressure in the markets and creating scarcity.\n\nCrypto BETH and other liquid versions for ETH staking\n\nThe crypto BETH is just one of the liquid versions in circulation to support the staking of ETH and the transition from POW to POS that took place with the Shapella hard fork on 12th April.\n\nThis type of token can be redeemed at a 1:1 ratio with the amount of coins previously staked, now that the staking of ether on the Beacon Chain has been legitimised.\n\nBETH was launched by Binance in April 2021, and for two years served as a way for users to enjoy alternative liquidity while their ETHs were locked into the ETH 2.0 platform.\n\nThe crypto is actually priced the same as ETH (with a minimum spread) and can be traded for other assets on Binance\u2019s internal market and other exchanges such as Okx, Huobi and PancakeSwap.\n\nSome of the most popular liquid versions that have a parity relationship with ETH staked on the Beacon chain include Lido, Coinbase wrapped staked ETH, Rocket Pool and StakeWise.\n\nIn total, the liquid staking market for ETH is worth $15.56 billion, which is approximately 40 percent of the value deposited by users to support the blockchain\u2019s proof-of-stake. Lido has a dominant position with 74.35% of the market.\n\nThese tokens not only give users additional liquidity that they would not have had if they had decided to deposit their coins on ETH 2.0 themselves, but also allow those who do not have large amounts of capital to participate in the stakes.\n\nIn fact, in order to activate the validator software without relying on third-party intermediaries such as those mentioned above, it is necessary to have as much as 32 ETH at one\u2019s disposal, which is currently equivalent to $56,300.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how this niche market develops and whether there will be more or less of an influx towards liquid staking services in the coming years, both with regard to Ethereum\u2019s staking validators and for other protocols and blockchains.\n\n\u200b\u200bETH TVL chart in liquid betting logs\n\n15 May opens for Lido withdrawals: volatility on the way?\n\nAs the Beacon Chain attracts more and more inbound validators and fewer and fewer outbound validators, all eyes are on one date in particular: 15th May.\n\nOn that day, Lido, the largest liquid wagering platform on the market, will allow the release of no less than 270,000 ETHs, equivalent to around $500 million, which will most likely be poured into the cryptocurrency markets.\n\nThis is a large amount, but it is not the same as the remaining 6.29 million ETHs, which will gradually be released for an equivalent of $11 billion.\n\nVolatility is therefore expected in the price of the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation and the crypto market in general.\n\nAs the news was announced by Lido itself and spread by the various crypto influencers, traders could anticipate trades by going short ETH even over the weekend.\n\nEthereum may experience serious pressure on the price in the near future:\n\n\n\nThe largest staker of ETH coins, Lido Finance, announced the release of an update on May 15, in which the withdrawal of coins from staking pools will become available. The developers claim that the\u2026 pic.twitter.com/NOeiNwiFyv \u2014 CCC.io (@CryptoCoinCoach) May 10, 2023\n\nHowever, more than the number of ETHs to be taken by Lido per se, the fear of market declines is related to the mainstream narrative of \u2018potential selling pressure\u2019.\n\nIf we take a close look at the average trading volumes on Ethereum, we see that there have been $9.7 billion worth of trades in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe 270,000 ETH that MAY (not necessarily) be sold represent only 5% of the coins traded daily.\n\nBe careful because in such complex situations there are often manipulation attempts and up or down fakes that force the forced liquidation of leveraged positions.\n\nIt is much better to trade on the spot market or use low leverage to prevent the whales from getting the upper hand over small traders.\n\nBe on your guard!"

        "title": "Following Arbitrum (ARB)\u2019s $120M Airdrop to DAOs, DigiToads (TOADS) Spikes in Interest Among Ethereum Whales - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "Following the news that Arbitrum has already airdropped tokens worth $ 120 million to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) in its ecosystem, interest has surged in other ERC20 tokens that put the financial well-being of their community first. The most notable of these is DigiToads, built from the ground up with its community at the absolute heart of everything it does. TOADS has recently welcomed new investments across the board, especially from Ethereum whales, who see more upside and a better return over the coming months with DigiToads compared to even Ethereum itself. And when whales make moves in the crypto ocean, waves are felt across the industry. TOADS is making waves\u2014here\u2019s why:\n\nDigiToads (TOADS)\n\nThe TOADS community is already being heavily rewarded thanks to the ecosystem\u2019s incredibly compelling new ico presale. The journey is only just starting for TOADS, and it will continue gaining in price throughout its presale adventure. Early adopters have already seen their holdings grow and there\u2019s still time to join them.\n\nAs part of a compelling model for P2E gaming and meme coin potential, the TOADS community is at the core of the whole ecosystem. It\u2019s been built to help benefit all its holders, especially early investors, with an experience that\u2019s fun, rewarding, and sustainable. That\u2019s why TOADS has already made over $3 million in sales in just a couple of months. This growth looks set to continue.\n\nThe DigiToads community is continuously rewarded with a fun experience and more TOADS tokens, depending on how well your companions compete. You can also enjoy top NFT staking mechanics to earn residual income along the way. 2.5% of profits are also donated to charitable causes, especially those that aim to protect the planet, setting it apart from other resource-heavy crypto projects and making the TOADS ecosystem a community-first project.\n\n>> Buy DigiToads Now <<\n\nArbitrum (ARB)\n\nARB\u2019s airdrop of $ 120 million tokens to 125 DAOs has shown how much a community-first project can do in the crypto world. The airdrop is an important part of the ARB roadmap, which aims to pay out 1.13% of its total 10 billion tokens to qualifying DAO projects. ARB still leads the way as one of the best community-minded cryptos around and is, therefore, a strong pick for your portfolio. But some investors prefer projects like TOADS, which they believe has more room to grow over the next few months and beyond.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum is still the cornerstone of the altcoin world as the go-to development platform for ERC20 projects. But prices in ETH itself remain stagnant, causing whales to look elsewhere. And they don\u2019t have to look far, as there are plenty of strong options already on the Ethereum blockchain, like TOADS and ARB. With ETH whales starting to move into TOADS investments, others are looking to follow for the hottest new property in the crypto world.\n\nConclusion\n\nARB has shown how well a crypto community can be rewarded, but TOADS takes this community-first approach even further. Throughout the TOADS journey, its community of avid investors will be rewarded more than almost any other crypto project. That\u2019s one of the reasons why ETH whales are moving into TOADS and you should strongly consider joining them to diversify your portfolio and potentially accumulate long-term gains.\n\nFor more information on DigiToads visit the website, join the presale or join the community for regular updates.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.
