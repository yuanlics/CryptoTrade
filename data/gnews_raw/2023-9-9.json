        "title": "1 Year Later, What Have We Learned From Ethereum and The Merge? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "On Sept. 15, Ethereum (ETH -1.02%) will celebrate the one-year anniversary of The Merge -- a technological tour de force that was easily one of the most hyped and anticipated events of 2022 for the crypto market. One year ago, investors salivated at the thought of what impact The Merge might have on Ethereum's future price.\n\nBut guess what? Ethereum is still trading under $1,650, at almost exactly the same price that it was 12 months ago. This raises an interesting question: What exactly have we learned from Ethereum and The Merge? And how can those lessons be applied when evaluating other cryptocurrencies? Let's take a closer look.\n\nTech upgrades\n\nPerhaps the biggest lesson here is that tech upgrades, no matter how big, do not always lead to huge price increases. This is an important point to keep in mind, based on how much hype many of these tech upgrades get. They are usually presented as major catalysts capable of sending a crypto soaring. But the truth might be quite different.\n\nWhat's interesting in the case of Ethereum is that The Merge was a truly transformational change and theoretically should have had a dramatic impact on Ethereum's price. The Merge transformed Ethereum from an old, energy-intensive, proof-of-work blockchain into a modern, energy-efficient, proof-of-stake blockchain. So, The Merge was a very different type of event than a typical annual upgrade that many blockchains undergo, and yet it still didn't have an appreciable impact on Ethereum's price.\n\nFrom my perspective, it means that the \"tech upgrade = growth catalyst\" investment thesis is no longer useful for evaluating cryptocurrencies. Going forward, you can pretty much assume that either the market is going to price in these upgrades as they are announced or the market is going to ignore the upgrade entirely. So, trying to time your investment decisions around key upgrades is not likely to be an effective strategy.\n\nRegulatory risk\n\nThe second big lesson from The Merge is that new business models can lead to new regulatory headaches. As soon as Ethereum became a proof-of-stake blockchain, it meant that there was going to be much more of a focus on crypto staking, which is the process of \"locking up\" your crypto in exchange for a financial reward. Until The Merge, crypto staking was a sleepy backwater of the crypto industry. But after The Merge, everyone was trying to figure out how to capture those financial rewards.\n\nAnd that included, unfortunately, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). From the perspective of SEC chairman Gary Gensler, new crypto-staking products sounded a lot like securities, and he vowed to take a closer look. In February, the SEC ended up going after cryptocurrency exchange Kraken for its crypto-staking activities, and that immediately got the attention of the market. Right now, Coinbase Global (COIN 1.38%) is locked in an epic battle with the SEC over the future of crypto staking.\n\nIf you parse through all the filings, documents, and back-and-forth between market participants and regulatory authorities, it sounds a lot like the SEC is not so much opposed to the concept of staking as it is to the way staking is marketed to retail investors, who might think it's a no-brainer, no-risk guaranteed return of some kind. But still, if you're an investor in Ethereum, you have to be aware that some regulatory risk does exist here, and it was all brought about by a change in business model (i.e., the shift from mining to staking).\n\nMacroeconomic outlook\n\nThe third big lesson is that the macroeconomic outlook matters more for crypto than many of us would like to admit. Gone are the days when the crypto market was completely separate from traditional, mainstream financial markets. With a surge of new institutional money into crypto comes a surge of institutional thinking about the crypto market. And that means a 24/7 obsession with the macroeconomic outlook.\n\nThus, while 2023 should have been all about the new era of Ethereum 2.0, it has instead been all about regional bank crises, Federal Reserve policy, jobs data, and inflation data. Long story short, there is absolutely no way Ethereum is going to skyrocket in price if banks are failing, inflation is surging, and economic growth is anemic. This completely changes the game for many crypto investors, who need to take a much more holistic view of the financial markets into account when choosing where to invest.\n\nA framework for analyzing cryptocurrencies\n\nTaken together, these three lessons can offer the basic framework for evaluating just about any cryptocurrency. First, make sure you understand the underlying business model of a crypto. Next, layer in some macroeconomic analysis, with a focus on key events or metrics that are being watched by the biggest institutional investors. And only then can you start to focus on all the interesting features of a new tech upgrade. In short, the tech upgrade is just the cherry on top of the final dessert, not the main course.\n\nAnd Ethereum? I'm still bullish on this crypto, even if it hasn't taken off the way it was supposed to one year ago. It's still up 35% for the year, and recent developments seem to suggest that institutional investors are adding to their Ethereum positions. But I'm not trying to time the market around new tech upgrades. Instead, I'm investing in Ethereum because I have confidence in its long-term growth prospects."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) started the weekend with slightly higher prices than seven days ago.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency currently trades for $25,815, which is an increase of about 0.6% over the week, while its closest runner-up grew 0.8% to change hands at $1,630.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany other leading cryptocurrencies have also posted similar small gains. There are no substantial changes to the price of any of the top thirty cryptocurrencies by market capitalization from last weekend, except Stellar (XLM).\n\nXLM holders saw their stash grow 10% over the week, and the token now trades for $0.124846. The rally appears to have been caused by a tweet from the Stellar team, posted on Saturday, that says, \u201cSomething cool is dropping in 10 days.\u201d\n\nIn the news\u2026\n\nAfter the slow news cycles of the last fortnight, this week saw a return to the usual slew of adoption announcements, although any indication of political breakthroughs for crypto over in Washington was pretty thin on the ground.\n\nOn Monday, the London Stock Exchange Group announced that it is using blockchain technology to build an exchange offering tokenized versions of traditional financial assets. LSEG is currently in talks with multiple regulatory bodies about it, including the UK government and HM Treasury.\n\nThat day, European Central Bank executive board member Fabio Panetta took aim at stablecoins issued by private companies like PayPal, which launched its own dollar-pegged PayPal USD (PYUSD) last month.\n\nSpeaking at the European Parliament\u2019s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs meeting on Monday, Panetta said his main criticism of PYUSD and similar coins is that \u201cprivate providers of payment services, including PayPal, have no incentive to limit the take-up of their stablecoins or the range of services they provide. Quite the opposite: their objective is to expand their customer base and gain market share.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn the other hand, Panetta thinks the proposed European central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital euro, \u201cwould pay due attention to orderly adjustments in the financial sector while offering payment service providers a platform for innovations with pan-euro area reach,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, top-five South Korean financial conglomerate Hana Financial Group announced a partnership between its KEB Hana Bank and crypto custodian BitGo for late 2024.\n\nThe new deal ties a major domestic financial player to the crypto industry, although KEB Hana Bank has already taken steps into blockchain when it opened a digital branch in metaverse platform The Sandbox.\n\nCrypto-friendly payments giant Visa said on Tuesday that it has now expanded its settlement options to include USDC on the Solana blockchain. The company also announced that it was working with merchant acquirers Worldpay and Nuvei to allow them to settle using USDC instead of fiat.\n\nOn Wednesday, The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)\u2014recognized by the SEC as the designated accounting standard setter for public companies\u2014voted unanimously to change how companies disclose crypto holdings in order to give greater transparency to the trade. The new rules take effect in 2025.\n\nTwo global financial regulators, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the G20\u2019s risk watchdog, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), on Thursday released a white paper outlining their plans for coordinated action to ensure that there is a \u201ccomprehensive policy and regulatory response for crypto-assets [as it] is necessary to address the risks of crypto-assets to macroeconomic and financial stability.\u201d\n\nWhile the paper\u2019s authors acknowledge that crypto doesn\u2019t currently pose a risk to the financial system, they argue that widespread adoption would undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy.\n\nThe paper recommends constituencies \u201csafeguard monetary sovereignty and strengthen monetary policy frameworks, guard against excessive capital flow volatility and adopt unambiguous tax treatment of crypto-assets\u201d to protect themselves from risks.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s TVL continued bleeding as the market extended its uncertainty.\n\nETH\u2019s ecosystem maintained some health and top whales have been buying the dip.\n\nThe crypto market just concluded another one of its most dormant weeks so far in 2023. Ethereum [ETH] and other top networks have experienced a significant slowdown in activity as is usually the case under such circumstances.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThe impact of the current market conditions was evident in multiple facets of the Ethereum network. This includes its TVL, which was a long way from its historic high. It had a total value locked of $21.42 billion at the time of writing, which is a stark contrast compared to its historic peak above $108 billion in 2021.\n\nDespite the slightly improved conditions so far this year, the market is still in a state of caution. As such, we have seen significant outflows in TVL since April. An indication that investor confidence in ETH\u2019s bullish potential is not there yet.\n\nRegardless of the slow and negative TVL growth in the last few months, there are some areas in ETH\u2019s journey this year that inspire some more confidence. For example, Ethereum\u2019s total value locked in ETH deposit contracts just achieved a new historic peak at over 28.7 million ETH.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Total Value in the ETH 2.0 Deposit Contract just reached an ATH of 28,734,846 ETH View metric:https://t.co/SzbMPqvhlb pic.twitter.com/eiDkE5DVw4 \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) September 9, 2023\n\nThe total value locked also confirms that Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem is still experiencing healthy network activity. But how is ETH fairing especially as the market appears to be stuck in limbo?\n\nETH supply distribution reveals something interesting about whale activity\n\nNow that ETH\u2019s total value is up, let\u2019s take a look at what has been happening with whale activity. According to its supply distribution metric, addresses holding over 10 million ETH (denoted in red) have been accumulating in the last 4 weeks. This category controls the largest share of ETH\u2019s circulating supply at 23.55%.\n\nAddresses in the 10,000 to 100,000 ETH category have also been accumulating ETH since the start of September. However, the other top whale categories have been contributing some sell pressure which may explain why the sell pressure has been canceling out the prevailing demand.\n\nRead about ETH\u2019s price prediction for 2024\n\nSo, what\u2019s next for ETH?\n\nETH\u2019s price action has been stuck at its current support level since the start of September. It exchanged hands at $1,633 at press time.\n\nETH\u2019s money flow indicator already shows that liquidity has been flowing into ETH. In other words, there has been some accumulation within the current support zone, highlighting the gradual return of optimism. However, caution is still warranted since the market is not out of the woods yet."

Going by the analyst forecast, the ETH price may likely decline to below $1,400 by the end of October 2023.

        "content": "The price of Ethereum seems to be back under the influence of the current market sentiment despite enjoying a relatively positive week. On Wednesday, September 6, Ark Invest filed for the first Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States.\n\nThis ETF application had a tame impact on the price of Ether, with the cryptocurrency only climbing to $1,650 the following day. Moreover, the token has almost fully reversed the minor gains from the significant development.\n\nEthereum Price Registers 0.1% Rise Last Week \u2013 Here\u2019s Why\n\nEthereum currently changes hands at about $1,628, according to data from CoinGecko. A negligible 0.1% price increase in the last seven days underscores the struggling market performance of the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nA spot ETH exchange-traded fund is an investment vehicle that tracks the price of Ethereum on the spot market, allowing investors to buy and sell the crypto asset via a brokerage account. A product of this kind is expected to boost interest and investment in the Ether token.\n\nNevertheless, the price of ETH has remained relatively unmoved this week despite the optimistic news. A recent report by blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock has provided insight into why the news barely impacted the price of Ethereum.\n\n\u2018Supply & Demand Balance\u2019\n\nAccording to the data analytics platform, the current supply and demand balance is one of the primary reasons why the ETH price continues to move sideways. \u201cLarge holdings are concentrated close to ETH\u2019s current price, consolidating prices in a tight range,\u201d IntoTheBlock said.\n\nSource: IntoTheBlock\n\nIntoTheBlock data shows that a total of 5.1 million ETH was acquired below the $1,600 mark to create support, while a total of 6.5 million ETH was purchased at a price above this level to establish resistance. The blockchain analytics firm concluded that traders agree to transact within a narrow range with a large concentration of ETH positions.\n\n\u2018Automated Buying, Discretionary Selling\u2019\n\nAdditionally, IntoTheBlock believes that while bullish traders seemed to have bought the news, \u201cdiscretionary sellers\u201d overtook the narrative not too long after.\n\n\u201cA key factor behind the discretionary selling is likely to be FTX\u2019s upcoming liquidation of reportedly $3B in crypto holdings,\u201d the report read.\n\nWhile FTX has yet to disclose when it intends to execute these liquidations, it is likely that recent activity on the exchange\u2019s wallets alarmed the market.\n\nThis sentiment also seems to be reflected in the performance of SOL after global payment giant VISA disclosed that it will use the Solana network for payment settlements. While the value of SOL jumped by more than 5% to trade above $20 immediately after the announcement, the cryptocurrency is back trading beneath $19.5.\n\nWith the Ethereum and Solana tokens constituting a significant portion of FTX\u2019s holdings, it is likely that the slow market performance of these assets is driven by traders being cautious because of the impending liquidation.\n\nETH price continues to move sideways on the daily timeframe | Source: ETHUSDT chart on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, allegedly had his X (formerly Twitter) account compromised. According to prominent blockchain investigator ZachXBT, the incident has led to victims collectively losing over $691,000 after clicking on a malicious link.\n\nIn a Sept. 9 post on X, Dmitry Buterin, the father of Vitalik, announced that his son\u2019s account had been compromised:\n\n\u201cDisregard this post, apparently Vitalik has been hacked. He is working on restoring access.\u201d\n\nThe post he was referring to has since been deleted. It was published on Buterin\u2019s account, claiming to celebrate the arrival of \u201cProto-Danksharding coming to Ethereum.\u201c\n\nThe hacker shared a malicious link to an alleged free commemorative nonfungible token (NFT) available, enticing victims to connect their wallets before ultimately stealing all their funds.\n\nConsequently, this incident has led Ethereum developer Bok Khoo, better known as Bokky Poobah on X, to claim he has suffered losses in his CryptoPunk NFT collection.\n\nWARNING!

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a market that is often swayed by sentiment, Ethereum and Solana find themselves in a complicated spot. Despite a string of bullish news, including Visa's interest and the buzz around a potential spot ETH ETF, both digital assets seem to be grappling with a shadow cast by fear-driven market dynamics. The looming $3 billion liquidation on FTX is a case in point, steering the market's focus away from the positive strides these blockchains are making.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs of the latest data, Ethereum is priced at $1,623.49 USD, while Solana stands at $18.47 USD. These figures might not tell the whole story, but they do hint at a subdued market response to what should have been uplifting news.\n\nOver the past two weeks, both Ethereum and Solana have shown less than stellar price performance. This lackluster movement contradicts the positive news flow and suggests that the market is more attuned to potential risks, such as FTX's impending liquidation, rather than opportunities. It's as if the market has put on blinders, focusing solely on the pitfalls ahead.\n\nSo, what's the takeaway? Well, it is not that Ethereum and Solana lack promise; far from it. These platforms continue to innovate and attract institutional interest. However, the market seems to be in a state of selective hearing, tuning in only to news that feeds its anxieties. This restive behavior could be a temporary phase, but for now, it is dictating the tempo of the market.\n\nAs for now, the market needs to recalibrate its focus, shedding its tunnel vision to appreciate the broader landscape of possibilities that these blockchains offer. Until then, ETH and SOL will likely continue to dance in the shadows."

        "title": "Dangerous Pattern Emerging for ETH, Price Could Crash to $1.4K (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has taken a notably bearish turn, breaching several critical support levels and tilting on the verge of a concerning death cross.\n\nDespite these developments, there is a glimmer of hope as the price approaches a substantial support zone, hinting at the possibility of a temporary consolidation phase.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has recently experienced a significant downtrend, leading to a breach of multiple support levels, including the crucial 100 and 200-day moving averages. This rejection has also pushed the price below its previous major swing low at $1,625, marking a daily lower low. This shift strongly suggests transitioning from an uptrend to a potential downward trajectory.\n\nAdditionally, the 100-day moving average is on the verge of crossing below the 200-day moving average, forming a death cross pattern. If this breakout occurs, the market could anticipate a notable descent towards the $1.4K support region.\n\nHowever, amidst the bearish signals, the price has reached a critical support region characterized by the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. This range is often seen as the last line of support for Ethereum bulls. Should the price slip below this threshold, the likelihood of a sharp decline would increase.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nExamining the 4-hour timeframe, a temporary pause in the aggressive downtrend can be observed when Ethereum found support around the significant $1.6K region.\n\nSubsequently, the price experienced a bounce-back but encountered strong resistance at the 61.8% Fibonacci level. This led to a consolidation phase, during which the price formed an ascending flag pattern\u2014a recognized bearish continuation pattern.\n\nHowever, another impulsive retracement drove the price back toward the $1.6K range, bringing it close to the lower boundary of the flag pattern. As the $1.6K threshold aligns with the flag\u2019s lower trendline, it carries considerable psychological significance. Consequently, if sellers push the price below this critical level, the market could witness another swift and steep decline toward lower price levels.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe chart visually represents the Ethereum Coinbase Premium Index, a 30-day moving average added, and the price. This metric measures the price difference between Ethereum on Coinbase and its counterpart on Binance, two prominent global cryptocurrency exchanges. What makes this metric particularly relevant is its ability to serve as a barometer for gauging whether U.S. investors collectively lean towards buying or selling Ethereum compared to their global counterparts.\n\nWhat emerges as a compelling observation is the intriguing correlation between the price action of Ethereum and the Coinbase premium metric. The chart shows that this metric\u2019s corresponding spike or plunge has mirrored every significant price surge or dip in Ethereum\u2019s value.\n\nHowever, the more noteworthy development recently has been the noticeable shift in sentiment within the U.S. cryptocurrency market. This shift is made evident by the pronounced downward trajectory of the premium index, reaching a yearly low. This shift in sentiment is significant because many U.S. investors involved are either high-net-worth individuals or institutional entities whose actions can wield substantial influence in the cryptocurrency landscape. Hence, the market seems to be in total fear and uncertainty until a robust price surge and heightened buying pressure occur."

        "title": "2 Cryptocurrencies That Could Dwarf Ethereum - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH -1.09%) remains the second-most valuable cryptocurrency in the world by market capitalization, trailing only Bitcoin (BTC -0.71%). Given Ethereum's dominant position in so many key areas of the blockchain world, it can be hard to imagine any other cryptocurrency ever surpassing it.\n\nBut for the past few years, a long line of rivals have attempted to do exactly that. Many of them have been described as \"Ethereum killers,\" due to their superior performance metrics and rapidly growing blockchain ecosystems. And two that particularly stand out right now are Cardano (ADA 4.66%) and Solana (SOL 8.56%). Let's take a closer look at how they might eventually surpass Ethereum over the long haul.\n\n1. Cardano\n\nWith a market cap of nearly $9 billion, Cardano ranks as the seventh-largest cryptocurrency in the world. That might sound impressive, but Ethereum has a market cap of almost $200 billion, so Cardano needs to increase in value by a multiple of 20 to 25 just to reach Ethereum's current size. To dwarf Ethereum, Cardano would likely need to 50x in value.\n\nThat's a big ask, so it's important that the founder of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson, also happens to be one of the co-founders of Ethereum. If there's anyone who knows how to out-Ethereum Ethereum, it's Hoskinson. He's been very vocal about the structural flaws of Ethereum in the past, arguing that Cardano has superior blockchain technology. This summer, he even suggested that Cardano would eventually surpass Ethereum and Bitcoin to become the top cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nFrom my perspective, it all starts with decentralized finance (DeFi). But in 2021, Cardano upgraded its blockchain to support the smart contracts required for DeFi, and it has continually made new improvements and upgrades since then. This year, for example, Cardano saw the launch of its first stablecoin, as well as a burst of new activity on decentralized exchanges. If Cardano's DeFi ecosystem continues to grow quickly, this could lead to rapid gains in valuation.\n\nMoreover, growth in emerging markets could send Cardano soaring. As Hoskinson outlined in a recent interview, Cardano is looking for blockchain partners across Africa, South America, Asia, and the Middle East. If Cardano becomes the most popular blockchain network in these regions, then it could have a massive impact on its future valuation.\n\n2. Solana\n\nSimilar in size to Cardano, Solana has a market cap of $8 billion. So it will need the same types of growth catalysts as Cardano to ever surpass Ethereum. In short, Solana needs a big, think-outside-the-box idea to drive 50-fold valuation gains.\n\nAnd that big idea might just be mobile crypto. Back in summer 2022, Solana first unveiled its strategic vision for mobile crypto, including a new flagship Android-based mobile device optimized for crypto and a software development kit to help developers around the world build for mobile crypto. It sounded like a lot of hype, but this spring, Solana finally launched its Saga crypto phone. The concept was simple but brilliant: Everything you do on your phone involving crypto should be simple and intuitive, and you should be able to bring crypto with you wherever you go.\n\nThe problem is that the collapse of FTX last year had disastrous implications for Solana, which had extensive links to former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. All the fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) swirling around Solana since the FTX meltdown has taken a toll on the Solana ecosystem. Some high-profile NFT collections, for example, decided to migrate to other blockchains this year, and overall activity on the Solana ecosystem has just started to regain its previous footing. The good news is that Solana is up more than 100% for the year, so the worst may be behind it.\n\nWhat are the chances of overtaking Ethereum?\n\nFor either Cardano or Solana to ever overtake Ethereum, a lot has to go right. The fact that there have been so many purported \"Ethereum killers,\" and none of them have ever managed to unseat Ethereum tells you a lot. The bottom line is that it's very difficult to overtake a market leader with a first-mover advantage, especially within the tech sector.\n\nIf forced to choose between Cardano and Solana, I'd pick Solana. This is a crypto that is not just trying to out-Ethereum Ethereum, it's actually proposing a new approach to blockchain technology based around mobile. For me, that's an exciting concept and a big reason why I think Solana might just pull off what many people think is impossible."

        "content": "The Ethereum price has maintained its position above the $1,600 mark, along with the ascending support trendlines for the past three weeks. Frequent dips to this level, swiftly met with buying interest, underscore the resolve of buyers to hold the fort. However, is this fortified support enough to usher in a bullish turnaround?\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Discussions Spikes Amidst Spot ETF Filings, Is ETH Price Aiming Bulls?\n\nadvertisement\n\n$1600 Support Prevents ETH Price From Major Fall\n\nThe Ethereum chart continues to present demand pressure at the $1600 mark.\n\nA breakout above the overhead trendline will offer better confirmation of recovery\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $2.4 Billion, indicating a 14.5% loss.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nOn August 29, the Ethereum coin saw a dash of optimism as buyers propelled the price to $1,744. This move aimed to rekindle bullish hope among investors. Yet, this was short-lived, as prices swiftly retraced to the familiar territory of $1,600.\n\nAmidst the prevailing market uncertainty, ETH price presently stands at $1,620, showing a minor intraday loss of 0.77%. Notably, sellers made an attempt to pierce through the bottom trendline today.\n\nBut all is not bleak. Should buyers retain control and defend this crucial level, there\u2019s a potential bullish reversal on the horizon. Such a move would directly challenge the descending resistance trendline that has been the bane for ETH price over the past couple of months.\n\nA successful break above this could signal a broader recovery, possibly driving altcoin towards $1,875.\n\nWill Ethereum Plunge to $1500?\n\nIt should be noted that the inability of buyers to mount a substantial recovery, despite numerous bounce-backs from the bottom trendline, suggests tepid bullish confidence. This could be a harbinger of a more prolonged downturn. If the coin price dips below the support trendline and with a daily candle closing beneath it, it could spell a bearish continuation, potentially dragging Ether down to the $1,500 level. The long-term support trend hovering above this support could offer a major dip opportunity for traders\n\nExponential Moving Average: The 100-and-200-day EMA slope nearing a bearish crossover could intensify supply pressure in the market.\n\nRelative Strength Index: The daily RSI slope must rise above the 40% market to enter sufficient momentum of bullish reversal."

Besides \"technical\" addresses associated with wallets controlled by largest CEXes, the operator of an MEV bot becomes the #1.\n\n$70 million for 1.26 million transactions: Meet largest gas spender on Ethereum (ETH)\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) wallet associated with a maximal extractable value (MEV) bot dubbed Jared From Subway (jaredfromsubway.eth) spent almost 38,000 Ethers (ETH) on gas, or over $70 million in equivalent. The bot initiated 1.26 million on-chain transactions, as demonstrated on a Dune dashboard created by Dragonfly's Hildobby.\n\njaredfromsubway.eth has now spent 37k ETH ($70m) on gas, the most of any address on Ethereum \ud83e\udd2f\n\n\n\nsrc: https://t.co/Ftl9QzMJPr pic.twitter.com/TdAeRvvzjJ \u2014 hildobby (@hildobby_) September 8, 2023\n\nAs such, this bot becomes the largest Ethereum (ETH) wallet in terms of gas spending. To provide context, the second position is occupied by one of Binance-controlled wallets with over 7.73 million transactions. It spends on gas less than half of what Jared From Subway transferred to Ethereum (ETH) validators.\n\nIt should also be noted that the Ethereum (ETH) gas price inches closer to multi-month lows. The current gas price is 9.39 Gwei, which means that one Uniswap (UNI) exchange is charged with approximately a $4 fee, as per Etherscan.\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) community is thrilled by such impressive statistics of an Ethereum MEV bot. Meanwhile, the net profit or PnL data for the account are yet to be calculated.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, MEV bots are responsible for the majority of trading activity on DEXes. For instance, 80% of Uniswap's (UNI) trading volume across all pairs is generated by AI-powered MEV bots.\n\nWhat is special about MEV bot by JaredFromSubway?\n\nMEV bots are automated mechanisms designed to frontrun pending trades in the Ethereum (ETH) mempool by corrupting validators with higher fees. Once the bot identifies a large transaction, it can manipulate the price of this or that asset and execute the deal with a more attractive price.\n\nThe first signs of activity from the jaredfromsubway.eth-backed bot were registered in February 2023. Experts say that its algorithms are more sophisticated: It managed to have its transactions included in over 60% of Ethereum (ETH) blocks. In April 2023, it was spending over $1.1 million on gas daily.\n\nThe net number of jaredfromsubway.eth victims might exceed hundreds of thousands of DEX traders.\n\nThe bot is named after Jared Scott Fogle, a spokesperson of the American fast food chain Subway. Fogle advertised the restaurants for 15 years before being arrested for child sex tourism and child pornography storage in 2015."

        "content": "On-chain data showed that ETH was undervalued at press time.\n\nEthereum\u2019s application in traditional sectors could drive up demand for ETH.\n\nPredicting how much one would make from investing in cryptocurrencies is a Herculean task. While some have been successful in the venture, the volatility of the market, macroeconomic factors, and sometimes manipulation have put some experts out of business.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nFor Ethereum [ETH], it has been a long ride since 2014. Those who got in early and held for some years surely have their stars to thank for betting on the altcoin. According to CoinMarketCap, ETH\u2019s all-time performance was a staggering 58,014% increase.\n\nCloser to the green than red\n\nBut after almost hitting $5,000 in 2021, the altcoin was back below $2,000. Now, it has a 66.47% drawdown from its All-Time High (ATH). Despite the decline, many market players believe that ETH is a cryptocurrency to keep an eye on for the future.\n\nThis is because several opinions have tried to explain how undervalued the altcoin was.\n\nHowever, being undervalued can be subjective. For some, you only have to consider historical data. For others, one needs to be on the lookout for major development. In Ethereum\u2019s case, it seems like a combination of all.\n\nSo, this article will aim to assess if ETH could be profitable using on-chain data, and development that impact the altcoin price.\n\nA look at the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-Score seems like a great metric to begin with. The MVRV Z-Score compares the market value to realized value to evaluate whether an asset is overvalued or undervalued relative to its \u201cfair value.\u201d\n\nTypically, a significantly higher market value than the realized value signals a market top (red area). Conversely, a significantly lower market value than the realized value has often indicated market bottoms (green area).\n\nAccording to Glassnode, ETH\u2019s MVRV Z-Score was 0.36. This value was very close to the green zone and far away from the red region. A simple interpretation of this state meant that ETH was undervalued at press time.\n\nDemand to push up the price?\n\nInterestingly, this was also the conclusion Fidelity Investments made in its 30 August research. Titled \u201cEthereum Investment Thesis,\u201d the financial planning firm provided an in-depth evaluation of the Ethereum blockchain. It also assessed the blockchain\u2019s connection with its token ETH.\n\nFidelity admitted that Ethereum\u2019s fee volatility was a stumbling block to its adoption and may not supersede Bitcoin [BTC] as a monetary tool. However, the report did not fail to mention that ETH\u2019s potential as a yield-generating asset should not be questioned, noting that Ethereum\u2019s smart contract feature could help increase its demand in the long term.\n\nFidelity explained,\n\n\u201cMainstream applications being used on top of Ethereum would, by default, lead to demand for ether, which is why this longer-term trend could be one of the most compelling cases for ether as an aspiring alternative money.\u201d\n\nThe firm also used the ability to purchase treasuries, bonds, and money market funds on the Ethereum blockchain as reasons why ETH\u2019s demand could surge in the future. As a store of value, Fidelity noted that ETH\u2019s issuance reduction has made it a scarce asset, and one to significantly increase.\n\nFurthermore, the report considered the stock-to-flow ratio and compared it with Bitcoin. The stock-to-flow ratio compares the existing amount of a cryptocurrency to the flow of a new amount mined within a specific year.\n\nAs of July, Ethereum\u2019s stock-to-flow ratio was higher than Bitcoin\u2019s. This means that ETH could prove to be a better store of value than the king coin going forward.\n\nETH: Hit $2,000 first, then go parabolic\n\nFor ETH\u2019s short-term projection, AMBCrypto spoke with Gracy Chen, Managing Director at Bitget. Chen agreed that ETH has a higher value proposition than BTC in the long term.\n\nShe admitted that Bitcoin\u2019s current dominance in the market makes ETH weak, but also mentioned some positives around staking liquidity flow and deflation. As for ETH\u2019s potential price in September,\n\nChen said,\n\n\u201cIf BTC successfully breaks through $29,000, it\u2019s anticipated that a surge in altcoin market activity will occur, and ETH might attempt to surpass its previous resistance level of around $2,141.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Fidelity also considered Ethereum\u2019s burn mechanism\u2019s connection to the ETH value. Using the Shanghai/Capella upgrade as a reference, the firm noted that ETH\u2019s unstable supply could prove to be an obstacle. And at the same time, it could be an advantage.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nAs a pro, the report noted that the narrative around ETH being an ultrasound money could pick up steam, improve the demand, and in turn the price. But this would require the supply to be consistent, like other assets acting as a store of value.\n\nApart from these mentioned above, Fidelity concluded Ethereum\u2019s role in various protocol upgrades and scaling solutions also gives it an edge to yield good gains in the future. However, market participants would need to watch out for consistency in this regard."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nVitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has reportedly fallen prey to hackers who gained unauthorized access to his X account \u2014 X being the new name for Twitter following its acquisition by Elon Musk.\n\nBad actors posted some phishing links in an apparent attempt to scam Buterin's followers by luring them with a suspicious-looking \"commemorative\" non-fungible token (NFT) sham. Per social media reports, multiple NFTs were stolen following the incident.\n\nButerin himself has yet to address the incident.\n\nBuzz and banter\n\nThe hacking incident has triggered an immediate response from the online community, including speculation, memes and legitimate security concerns.\n\nOne user humorously mused about the fortunes the hacker could have amassed had they falsely tweeted about a massive Ethereum sell-off.\n\nObviously, a lot of users were puzzled by the fact that someone as tech-savvy as Buterin could fall victim to such an attack. Rumor has it that the incident was caused by a SIM swap attack.\n\nETH did not flinch\n\nThe ETH price remained remarkably steady in the wake of the major cyber-incident. At press time, it is trading at $1,626 following a minor 0.5% dip.\n\nThe coin's market cap hovers at about $195.5 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of approximately $3.3 billion."

        "content": "In the guise of an NFT promotion, a hacker attached a phishing link to the tweet.\n\nIt was estimated that the hacker managed to steal funds exceeding $100,000 through this attack.\n\nIn a recent turn of events, Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum [ETH], fell victim to a hacking incident involving his Twitter account. This breach of security raised concerns within the cryptocurrency community and could potentially impact the sentiment surrounding Ethereum.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nWhat the hack\n\nThe hacking incident involved the unauthorized use of Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Twitter account. The attacker, in the guise of promoting an NFT collection associated with the firm ConsenSys, attached a phishing link in the tweet.\n\nThe hacker\u2019s activities on Vitalik\u2019s account immediately raised alarms, prompting a warning from PeckhieldInc, a cybersecurity company specializing in the crypto sector.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that the swift response of the crypto community and cybersecurity experts resulted in the removal of the malicious tweets from Vitalik\u2019s account. At the time of writing, it appeared that Vitalik\u2019s Twitter account was back in safe hands.\n\nThe financial implications of this security breach were substantial. It is estimated that the hacker managed to steal funds exceeding $100,000 through this attack. An examination of the wallet\u2019s holdings revealed a balance of $397,138.21 at the time of discovery.\n\nYou can trace the activity of the @VitalikButerin hacker here on @ArkhamIntel:https://t.co/3rsPFJsK3T So far more than $100,000 in stolen funds.

This technique involves transferring a phone number from one SIM card to another, often accomplished through cooperation or fraud with mobile carriers.\n\nUnauthorized SIM swaps can lead to identity theft and unauthorized access to online accounts, posing severe risks to individuals\u2019 assets and personal information.\n\nHow is ETH doing?\n\nThis breach of safety could impact the sentiment around ETH as well. According to Santiment\u2019s data, the weighted sentiment around ETH declined materially over the last few days.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s price experienced a decline as well. At the time of writing, Ethereum was trading at $1623, signaling a drop in value.\n\nHowever, despite the price downturn, the number of Ethereum addresses holding non-zero balances continued to grow. Glassnode data revealed that the number of non-zero addresses reached an all-time high of 105,721,874."

If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nPomerdoge (POMD) has taken over the world, and everybody is talking about this presale. One Ethereum (ETH) whale has participated, and these whales only buy a token they believe in. What convinced this whale to participate? And why do analysts think that Pomerdoge could be the best-performing altcoin of 2023?\n\n\n\nThis article dives into these questions and more, examining the blazing trail of Pomerdoge and why this memecoin could quickly become 2023\u2019s hottest project.\n\nClick Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale\n\n\n\nPomerdoge (POMD) NFTs, Memecoins Tokenomics, and P2E\n\n\n\nPomerdoge continues its wildly successful presale and has nearly raised $2 million already. Whales have flipped bullish, and analysts believe that $POMD, the native token, could easily rally 3,500% in the coming weeks.\n\n\n\nIntroducing the new meta of P2E. Pomerdoge blends memecoin economics, the ability to rapidly soar, with utility in the form of the Pomergame, which gives the 3 billion users who actively play video games globally a platform to network and earn. Players level up their characters, and when they reach gold status, they can begin selling items in the Pomerplace!\n\n\n\nThe protocol has a collection of 7,777 unique NFTs. Although the team has not disclosed their function, analysts are hyper-bullish on this collection, believing it to be the key to the ecosystem. They are currently available to mint for just 0.2 $ETH for $POMD holders.\n\n\n\nPomerdoge\u2019s token $POMD continues to rise in price throughout the presale as demand increases, and with no buy or sell taxes, investors get to keep 100% of their profits. Liquidity will be locked, and Cyberscope and Solidproof, two leading smart contract auditors, have released their audits showing that Pomerdoge passed with fly colors.\n\n\n\nOne of the most exciting altcoins on the market, Pomerdoge is poised to shatter records and leap straight into the top 100 projects. Joining ICOs has always been one of crypto\u2019s most profitable endeavors, and joining the Pomerdoge presale today could be one of investors\u2019 best decisions.\n\n\n\nEthereum (ETH) Futures Product Coming Soon?\n\n\n\nEthereum is arguably the king of altcoins and slowly becoming the internet\u2019s value layer. Alternative layer one defined the last cycle, but layer twos will define the coming cycle. Why is this excellent for Ethereum? All layer twos ultimately settle on Ethereum and use $ETH as their native currency.\n\n\n\nMore bullish news comes from the increasing number of Ethereum ETF Futures products awaiting approval. Following the SEC\u2019s defeat in court against Greyscale, its approvals will likely be more lenient. But the end goal for many supporters is an Ethereum Spot ETF, and a Futures approval is the first tangible step towards this goal.\n\n\n\nPrice predictions for $ETH remain incredibly optimistic, with analysts forecasting a potential range between $4,395.39 and $5,124.95. With the pendulum swinging back towards an Ethereum-centric landscape, investors should focus on $ETH and all the ERC20 coins under its broad umbrella, like $POMD, in the coming months.\n\n\n\nVisit the links below for more information about Pomerdoge (POMD):\n\nWebsite: https://pomerdoge.com/\n\nTelegram Community: https://t.me/pomerdoge"

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility and ever-shifting dynamics, and recent developments have stirred up excitement for both Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ethereum (ETH) investors. However, amidst the frenzy, Everlodge (ELDG) has quietly emerged as a dark horse, experiencing a significant price surge.\n\nJoin the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB): A Familiar Rally\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB), referred to as the \u201cDogecoin killer,\u201d has a history of making headlines with its sudden price rallies. Recently, it experienced a surge in value driven by renewed interest and positive sentiment within the Shiba Inu community.\n\nThe anticipated Shibarium relaunch, which promised more utility for the Shiba Inu coin, was the leading cause for this rally. Furthermore, Lucie, the Shiba Inu marketing officer, drew attention to the deflationary aspect of SHIB. But Lucie warns that this does not guarantee that the Shiba Inu price will rise.\n\nDespite this, experts remain bullish for Shiba Inu as they forecast a surge to $0.00001078 by the end of 2023.\n\nEthereum (ETH): The Pioneer\u2019s Momentum\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has witnessed renewed momentum. In recent Ethereum news, several of its liquid staking providers have voluntarily imposed self-limit rules. Thus pledging not to accumulate more than 22% of the Ethereum staking market.\n\nThis initiative clearly demonstrates the Ethereum community\u2019s dedication to maintaining a decentralized network. As a result, this movement aligns with the core ethos of cryptocurrency \u2013 decentralization.\n\nEthereum\u2019s adaptability and commitment to its core principles make it an attractive choice in the crypto landscape for long-term investors. Due to all these reasons, many analysts in the field predict that the Ethereum price could sit between $2,048.41 and $2,335.71 within Q4 of 2023.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG): The Surprising Contender\n\nAmidst the buzz surrounding Shiba Inu and Ethereum, Everlodge (ELDG) has silently surged by an impressive 60%. Everlodge\u2019s unique approach to real estate investments has caught the attention of traders seeking alternatives in this market.\n\nThis groundbreaking platform aims to revolutionize the real estate industry by removing persistent issues. For instance, Investing in real estate often means being confined to one\u2019s geographical location. Everlodge opens the door to global real estate opportunities by digitizing and minting high-end properties into NFTs from regions worldwide.\n\nMoreover, Everlodge then fractionalizes these NFTs. As a result, even small-scale investors can become fractional owners of vacation homes for prices as low as $100. Once the property value increases, the NFT price will also rise \u2013 providing you with passive income.\n\nAt the core of this platform lies the ELDG native token, now in Stage 2 of its presale. It has already pumped from its starting price of $0.01 and is worth only $0.016. Those looking to obtain staking rewards, access to free nightly property stays, and more are now flooding the presale. In fact, demand is so high that experts foresee a $0.035 price before its launch.\n\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale\n\nWebsite: https://www.everlodge.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/everlodge\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The price struggles among various crypto projects following these last rocky couple of weeks haven\u2019t exempted even the biggest projects. Ethereum and Bitcoin also had major tumbles, leaving their investors and whales in unfavorable conditions.\n\nHowever, the good news is crypto investors and whales have now found hope in this fast-rising GameFi sensation called, Pikamoon (PIKA). With an uptick set for new profitable heights and high returns, it\u2019s about to be a turnaround for ETH and BTC whales as well as other investors once they switch to PIKA.\n\nEthereum Price Fall Might Not be Ending Soon\n\nEthereum price indicators continue to exhibit signs of a further bearish trajectory, backed up by the breach of the ascending trendline. This breach has also seen ETH fall below the critical support level of $1,687, paving the way for a possible 27% ETH price fall. Analysts believe ETH could potentially reach the psychological benchmark of $1,200, with intermediate support of $1,366.\n\nIn addition, the higher EMA 100 has just crossed with the lower EMA 50 from a downward viewpoint, symbolizing a bearish market momentum. Likewise, the histograms of the AO have transitioned to red, with powerful bodies placed below the zero line, showing signs of intensified selling pressure.\n\nConsidering this tricky situation, experts advise investors to seek alternatives in other promising altcoins as it will have a huge impact on a reversal in the ETH price trend.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction Leaves BTC Investors Worried\n\nAccording to chart analysts, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) set at around $27,300 has significantly influenced Bitcoin\u2019s price trajectory. The recent candle closures confirm a strong bearish trend. Then, there\u2019s a quick resistance at $26,200. Regardless, that there\u2019s a bearish engulfing candlestick and a two-day candle pattern beneath this level implies the bearish pressure will continue.\n\nShould this trend continue, Bitcoin\u2019s price could fall to $25,600, and possibly even lower to $25,200. Still, the breach of the $26,200 resistance could signal the subsequent resistance at $26,800, a momentum that could lead BTC\u2019s price toward levels of $27,300 and eventually $27,600. On the flip side, a breach below $25,200 might signal the possibility of more profound losses, potentially going downward to as low as $24,800.\n\nPikamoon (PIKA) Provides Ethereum and Bitcoin Whales With Hopes of a Comeback\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin whales are in luck as savvy investors identify Pikamoon as the hope they seek.\n\nPikamoon is a hybrid meme coin project that combines an advanced play-to-earn metaverse game, Pikamoon Adventure, and a hybrid deflationary token equipped with features inspired by advanced technologies and innovations to offer investors and gamers an easy path to explosive returns.\n\nHere are some of these features:\n\nUnique GameFi Offering\n\nPikamoon (PIKA) delivers GameFi uniquely, from the immersive gameplay, to the money-making opportunities, and the fast-growing token.\n\nAlso, Pikamoon\u2019s GameFi structure maximizes PIKA, positioning it for explosive ROIs by keeping it in demand. Furthermore, the addition of the exchange and in-game trading marketplace spices up the uniqueness of this GameFi setup for gamers and investors.\n\nPikamoon Makes Expansion Easier\n\nPikamoon ensures it grows easily by building on two powerful blockchains renowned for NFT and Metaverse excellence, MultiversX (formerly Elrond) and Ethereum. Therefore, the different parts of Pikamoon as a project get spread across both blockchains, allowing Pikamoon to expand and take on any level of user influx easier and faster.\n\nPIKA is Crucial to the Pikamoon Project\n\nPIKA is the project\u2019s utility, reward, exchange, and purchase token. These use cases will boost the token\u2019s demand, increasing the value of the token.\n\nInvestors are Already Making Profits in the Ongoing Pikamoon Presale\n\nPikamoon presale started on a high note right from the first phase recording a 100% price increase and six figures in sales. This drew in several investors and as experts predicted, that led to more profits in subsequent phases as PIKA completed a 300% ROI hitting $0.0006. This surge raised $4 million in PIKA sales.\n\nNow, experts predict more profits this year, foreseeing PIKA delivering a potential 10,000% ROI before 2023 ends. This is an opportunity you don\u2019t want to miss!\n\nFind out more about Pikamoon (PIKA):\n\nBuy Now: https://pikamoon.io/buy\n\nWebsite: https://pikamoon.io\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Pikamooncoin\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/pikamoonofficial\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Is Solana EVM Compatible and What Does It Actually Mean? - AMBCrypto Blog",
        "content": "Solana (SOL), a rapidly growing blockchain platform, has been turning heads in the crypto industry because of its remarkable scalability and transaction speed. However, one aspect that has grabbed particular attention is Solana\u2019s compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). If you also want to know whether Solana is EVM compatible, then keep reading.\n\nThis exhaustive piece explores what Solana EVM compatibility means, its advantages, and practical applications.\n\nUnderstanding EVM\n\nThe EVM is the runtime environment for executing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a decentralized computer featuring a sandboxed environment, meaning that it operates independently of the host computer system.\n\nThe EVM allows for the deployment and execution of arbitrary algorithms in a series of opcodes. Moreover, it provides the backbone for the decentralized apps (dApps) that are the hallmark of the Ethereum network.\n\nIn simpler terms, the EVM serves as a large, global, decentralized computer. Each smart contract is like a \u201cprogram\u201d that runs on this computer. Every Ethereum node runs its own EVM instance. This ensures that all computations are performed consistently. Consequently, the state of the blockchain remains synchronized across all nodes.\n\nWhy would you only learn about blockchains when you could be building one? Get started today.\n\nSolana and EVM: A compatible match\n\nThe Solana EVM serves as a bridge, letting dApps and transactions designed for the Ethereum network run seamlessly on the Solana blockchain as well. This compatibility layer means that Ethereum developers can transition their dApps to Solana without modifying any code.\n\nBuilt on the high-speed Solana blockchain, which can handle as many as 65,000 transactions per second, the Solana EVM offers far greater speed and scalability compared to Ethereum\u2019s 15 transactions per second.\n\nWhy is Solana\u2019s user activity plunging lower? Find out today.\n\nEVM compatibility: A game changer for Solana\n\nEVM compatibility is a significant breakthrough for Solana. This interoperability is a much-needed step towards addressing one of the biggest challenges that the crypto industry faces today.\n\nEVM compatibility brings about time savings, reduces knowledge transfer costs, and cuts back on development requirements. It attracts users, talent, and innovation from the Ethereum ecosystem to other blockchain platforms.\n\nThe boons of Solana EVM\n\nSolana EVM offers various benefits, including:\n\nEfficient scaling: Thanks to the Solana network, Web 3 developers can enjoy low gas fees and high throughput. This is due to its parallel processing (Sealevel) and unique innovations like Proof-of-History. The mechanism enables 400ms block times.\n\nIntegration with Solana ecosystem: Ethereum developers and creators have the opportunity to leverage Solana\u2019s robust ecosystem. This includes its developer community, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces. They can either migrate to or expand their applications with the use of Solana EVM.\n\nUsing familiar tools: EVM developers can continue using tools that they are already comfortable with. These include tools like MetaMask, Truffle, and Waffle, ensuring a seamless developer experience.\n\nAdapting smart contracts easily: Existing Ethereum dApps can be ported over to Solana Programs (i.e., Solana smart contracts) without any reconfiguration of the underlying smart contracts.\n\nDemocratizing access: Lastly, by using a Solana EVM, the users, talent, and innovation of the Ethereum ecosystem can easily adapt to projects on both blockchains.\n\nThe force behind Solana EVM\n\nNeon Labs is the company that developed the first EVM on Solana. The Neon EVM is a cross-chain solution that allows dApp developers to leverage the benefits of Solana to expand their services, offering new products like arbitrage or high-frequency trading, growing their user base, and reducing costs where possible, including gas fees.\n\nIts ERC-20/SPL wrapper is an implementation of the ERC-20 interface for SPL tokens that ensures Solana applications interact with Neon EVM contracts.\n\nGetting started with Neon EVM\n\nTo kickstart your journey with Neon EVM, the fastest route is to set up MetaMask and link it to the NeonEVM devnet either via Chainlist or by manual configuration. Developers eager to delve deeper can consult the Neon EVM documentation for further insights, and they can acquire test NEON tokens by utilizing either the NeonFaucet website or its API.\n\nThe future of blockchain with Solana EVM\n\nThe emphasis on EVM compatibility is poised to catalyze a new wave of multi-chain applications, strengthen network collaboration, and elevate the user experience as the focus shifts toward more scalable solutions. As the landscape evolves, the union of Solana and Ethereum ecosystems via EVM compatibility offers an intriguing glimpse into the future of blockchain tech. For developers keen on harnessing Solana\u2019s capabilities, the timing couldn\u2019t be better to delve into this cutting-edge platform and discover its vast potential.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo sum it up, Solana being EVM compatible signifies a significant leap in the blockchain ecosystem. It brings together the robustness of Ethereum with the efficiency of Solana.\n\nAs the crypto industry strives to resolve its scalability and interoperability issues, the advent of Solana EVM might just be the solution it needs. The future of blockchain technology looks promising with such innovative approaches. Lastly, it\u2019s exciting to see what\u2019s next on the horizon."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum creator Vitalik Buterin appears to have fallen victim to a hacker on Twitter, who went on to steal $691,000 from users who followed a corrupted link posted to his feed.\n\nThe hack was first noticed on Saturday when a post appeared on Buterin\u2019s post announcing the launch of a set of commemorative non-fungible tokens (NFTs) from software provider Consensys. This malicious link\u2014which could have been shown to many of his 4.9 million followers\u2014prompted victims to connect their wallets to mint the NFT, but in reality, it simply created a vacuum for the hacker to make off with their funds.\n\nOn Crypto Twitter, users were quick to raise the alarm about the fake link, but the first apparent acknowledgment that Buterin was hacked came from his father, Dmitriy \"Dima\" Buterin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDisregard this post, apparently Vitalik has been hacked. He is working on restoring access. https://t.co/2fjM0GhvIa \u2014 dima.eth (@BlockGeekDima) September 9, 2023\n\nThe post has since been deleted, but the damage was done, as a number of victims reported losing access to funds from their wallets. Within the hour, the hacker appeared to make off with more than $147,000, but that quickly increased to $691,000, according to blockchain investigator @ZachXBT.\n\nIn the day since the hack was first reported, Buterin has not yet commented publicly on the incident, his most recent post again being a retweet of a Sept. 6 post. @ZachZPT reported that the hacker subsequently sent a stolen NFT to Buterin.\n\nthey hacker just sent Vitalik this NFT they drained 0x909c74236ded54ecea95ea1568e1abf67624ccae436d1b9d94cd0c163b11eec5 pic.twitter.com/Fx6ekDYyWR \u2014 ZachXBT (@zachxbt) September 10, 2023\n\nIt is unknown just how many users were affected, but this latest incident adds to a growing list of hacks over social media that have netted millions in tokens.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter so many losses, there has been a debate on how victims should be compensated for their losses by developers themselves. Twitter\u2019s own security also came into question, including by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, who wrote that the platform\u2019s account security \"is not designed\u201d well compared to traditional financial accounts.\n\n\u201cIt needs quite a bit more features: 2FA, login ID should be different from handle or email, etc.,\u201d wrote Zhao, referring to two-factor authentication. \u201cIn the past, I have had my Twitter account locked a few times due to hackers trying to brute-force it (trying different passwords repeatedly). This was before the 'Elon era.'\u201d\n\nTwo-factor authentication is a widely recommended defense method for users to require two sets of information to verify their identity before accessing an account. It is supported by Twitter, but only for users who pay for Twitter Blue. Brute forcing is a tactic where hackers bombard an account with access requests until one eventually breaks through."

        "title": "How Bitcoin Spark Emerges as a Stronger Mining Alternative to Ethereum - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "There\u2019s been a need for careful governance and design considerations in the quest for a scalable and sustainable blockchain infrastructure. And Bitcoin Spark has emerged as a stronger alternative to Ethereum in this respect.\n\nHow to stake Ethereum\n\nEthereum staking came as a result of Ethereum\u2019s move from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) through what was known as The Merge. This transition was aimed at addressing the scalability issues that PoW systems face. In a PoS system, validators are chosen to create new blocks and validate transactions based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to stake as collateral rather than by solving complex mathematical puzzles, as in PoW. To stake Ethereum, you need to have a minimum amount of 32 ETH and run a compatible staking node. You can also opt to use a staking service provided by various platforms.\n\nThe move to PoS did address some of the scalability issues related to PoW, such as the energy and time used for block confirmation. However, there are still concerns with this system since small holders may need help to compete with those with significant amounts of ETH, leading to a concentration of power and influence in the hands of a few individuals, compromising on decentralization.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Spark?\n\nBitcoin Spark is a new Bitcoin fork that aims to solve its predecessor\u2019s limitations while carving out a distinct path for itself.\n\nThe Bitcoin Spark network offers faster and more cost-efficient transactions than traditional blockchain networks. It also offers a more scalable platform for building smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) through its multiple-layered design.\n\nBitcoin Spark is currently in its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) stage, offering investors a chance to get BTCS before the network\u2019s official launch. The project\u2019s team has allocated 19.05% of its maximum supply of 21 million to the ICO. BTCS will launch at $10 but is currently selling BTCS at $2.25, accompanied by a 10% bonus in Phase 4 of the ICO.\n\nHow to mine Bitcoin Spark\n\nThe Bitcoin Spark network introduces a novel consensus mechanism known as Proof-of-Process (PoP). The PoP combines elements of Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Work, requiring miners/validators to provide a stake and processing power to the network in order for them to confirm blocks and earn rewards. Bitcoin Spark combines the PoP with an algorithm that exponentially reduces rewards per additional stake and processing power to ensure rewards can be distributed more fairly between smaller and larger network participants. This, combined with a massive number of network nodes, allows Bitcoin Spark to have a greater number of miners/validators.\n\nThe Bitcoin Spark development team will launch the Bitcoin Spark application before making the network\u2019s repository public for developers to create their own mining software. To mine BTCS, you will need to install the application and grant it access to your device\u2019s processing unit. The app will be lightweight and compatible with Windows, Android, iOS, Linux, and Mac OS. Once granted access, the application will create a virtual environment separate from the device\u2019s operating system functions to ensure security. Miners will be able to choose the number of device resources permitted for mining use, although the app itself can automatically adjust itself to the resources it can use on the device to account for overheating, battery life, and simultaneous usage requirements.\n\nThe miners/validators\u2019 contributed power will be rented to organizations and individuals requiring significant amounts of remote computational power. Those using this service will be required to pay with BTCS, providing a unique real-world application for the Bitcoin Spark ecosystem. Unlike PoW and PoS systems, Bitcoin Spark miners/validators will be rewarded with newly minted BTCS coins, transaction fees, and income from renting out their processing power.\n\nBitcoin Spark\u2019s approach greatly reduces the power and work required for mining. This promotes true decentralization by opening up the validation process to many more individual miners while increasing the blockchain\u2019s security.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin Spark\u2019s focus on energy efficiency, scalability, sustainability, and inclusivity in its validation process positions it as a better alternative.\n\nFor more on Bitcoin Spark:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register"

        "title": "Phishing attack targets Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin's Twitter account - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "In an unsettling development that has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community, the Twitter account of Ethereum\u2018s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, was reportedly compromised. This unexpected breach, believed to be the result of a sophisticated phishing attack, has raised eyebrows and amplified concerns in the crypto community, especially considering the increasing number of high-profile hacks in recent times.\n\nDetails of the attack\n\nThe official Twitter account of Vitalik Buterin, one of the most prominent figures in the cryptocurrency world, was reportedly hacked. According to emerging reports, the hackers gained unauthorized access to Buterin\u2019s account and posted a malicious link. This link, which was disguised in a tweet, was said to be part of a phishing scheme.\n\nThe tweet spoke about Consensys, a blockchain technology company, offering a special NFT (Non-Fungible Token) to commemorate the introduction of \u201cProto-Danksharding\u201d to Ethereum. For those unfamiliar, NFTs are unique digital assets verified using blockchain technology, and \u201cProto-Danksharding\u201d refers to a potential upgrade in the Ethereum network. The hackers cleverly used this information to lure unsuspecting users into clicking the harmful link.\n\nPeckShieldAlert, a cybersecurity firm, quickly identified the breach and alerted the community about the phishing link associated with the compromised account. Their warning message was clear: \u201cIt seems Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Twitter account is hacked. And do NOT click the phishing link.\u201d\n\nRising concerns in the crypto community\n\nThis incident with Buterin\u2019s Twitter account is not an isolated one. The crypto community has recently witnessed a surge in high-profile account breaches. To put things into perspective, just a couple of months ago, in July 2023, the Twitter account of Uniswap\u2019s founder, Hayden Adams, was also compromised. Such incidents have raised alarms about the security measures in place for prominent figures in the crypto industry.\n\nThe nature of these attacks, especially phishing, is particularly concerning. Phishing attacks involve tricking individuals into providing sensitive information, like passwords or credit card numbers, by disguising them as trustworthy entities. In the context of the crypto world, this could lead to significant financial losses and damage to reputations.\n\nSwift recovery and moving forward\n\nDespite the initial shock and concern, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Twitter account was promptly recovered from the hackers. Post-recovery, Buterin\u2019s recent Twitter activities seem to be back to normal. One of his latest tweets highlights a blockchain privacy-related paper he co-authored with Ameen Soleimani, among other contributors.\n\nWhile the quick recovery is a silver lining, the incident is a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities even high-profile individuals face in the digital age. It underscores the importance of robust cybersecurity measures and the need for continuous vigilance in the ever-evolving landscape of online threats.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs the crypto community continues to grow and gain mainstream attention, it becomes imperative for individuals and organizations alike to prioritize security. The recent hacks, including the unsettling breach of Buterin\u2019s account, serve as a poignant reminder of the digital threats that lurk in the shadows. As technology advances, so do the techniques of malicious actors. It\u2019s a wake-up call to fortify their digital assets and online presence against potential threats."
