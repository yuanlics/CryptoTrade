        "title": "The ETH Question: Why does the SEC avoid taking action against Ethereum when all else are fair game? - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed suit against Binance today in a move that has rocked the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nThe complaint notably includes language in which the SEC clearly elucidates that it considers many of the tokens that traded on Binance to be unregistered securities and lays out its case against several it considers notable offenders. The SEC identifies these \u201ccrypto asset securities\u201d as including (but not limited to) Solana, Cardano, Polygon, Filecoin, Cosmos, The Sandbox, Decentraland, Algorand, Axie Infinity, and Coti.\n\nToday\u2019s filing contains some of the SEC\u2019s most explicit language to date in clarifying its judgment, but once again avoids taking on the big question: is Ethereum a security or not? If so, why is the SEC silent on it? And if not, what is it?\n\n\u201cCrypto Asset Securities\u201d\n\nThe SEC\u2019s argument for designating these tokens as \u201ccrypto asset securities\u201d is exhaustively outlined in Section VIII of the complaint (pages 85 through 123). Notable patterns emerge from the filing: the process of initial coin offerings (ICOs), vesting of tokens, allocations for the core team, and the promotion of profit generation through ownership of these tokens, are all repeated themes.\n\nBut Ethereum is not listed among these. Gensler has remained consistently vague on the question of whether Ethereum and its namesake coin count as securities. ETH is commonly held as an investment, suggesting it could be classified as a security, but it is also extensively used day-to-day as a medium of exchange across protocols, making its function more akin to cash or ACH settlement.\n\nGensler has previously suggested that \u201ceverything other than Bitcoin\u201d in the crypto space could be seen as a security, but has notably refused to clearly state as much about Ethereum. When pressed to say the words, \u201cI believe Ethereum is a security,\u201d the Hon. Chair just will not do it. Gensler\u2019s reluctance to classify Ether is curious when his SEC is so eager to claim as much for others. Why?\n\nThe Ethereum problem\n\nIt might be a simple matter of intragovernmental contention. Ethereum could potentially fall under the purview of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which regards Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether as commodities, not securities. Not only do the two categories differ wildly from one another, this overlap could create a regulatory tug-of-war that would Gensler\u2019s public stance on Ethereum while trying to avoid the appearance of infighting within the federal government.\n\nAnother analysis from Protos, argues that Gensler\u2019s evasion on the matter may be a consequence of the SEC\u2019s earlier inaction following the infamous DAO hack, which saw the blockchain fork into Ethereum Classic and put the entire ecosystem at risk. However, at the time the SEC did nothing, and now Gensler finds himself in the unenviable position of making up for his predecessors\u2019 oversights. Now that the Ethereum ecosystem has spent years recovering and building credibility, retroactively declaring it an unregistered security would have unforeseen, but no doubt disastrous, consequences for investors.\n\nIn other words, protecting investors in this case would mean protecting them from the protector.\n\nHowever, perhaps another reason could lie beneath Gensler\u2019s reluctance to clearly classify Ethereum: he may not know.\n\nCryptocurrencies and their underlying technologies are innovative and novel. They represent a fundamental shift in how we understand finance and asset ownership, and in the case of decentralized ecosystems like Ethereum, they introduce entirely new paradigms.\n\nIf this is true, it\u2019s not unreasonable to suspect that most people\u2014even those deeply involved in the space\u2014may not fully understand the implications of these innovations just yet. Anything that is fundamentally new will resist categorization, and Ethereum does so\u2014this lack of a concrete \u201cconcept\u201d that both defines Ethereum but fits into previous understandings is the core problem around regulating it.\n\nThis regulatory ambiguity presents a complex challenge for Ethereum, but it does not lessen the urgency to address it. The advancement of the crypto industry hinges on obtaining clear legal definitions for Layer 1 (L1) tokens, such as Ethereum, that function simultaneously as mediums of daily exchange and investment vehicles within their respective ecosystems. The ambiguity in their status poses a significant hurdle, stalling progress and fostering uncertainty in a space that is ripe for growth and innovation.\n\nThe dichotomy of these tokens\u2019 roles blurs the boundary between conventional asset classes, forcing us to confront inadequacies in existing legal structures. To propel the crypto industry forward, regulators must acknowledge and address this nuanced reality. Until a refined framework emerges that accurately captures the dual functionality of these L1 tokens, regulatory ambiguity will continue to shroud the industry, stifling its full potential and deterring mainstream adoption. This unique crypto space requires equally unique rules\u2014ones that can encapsulate its dynamism and complexity.\n\nMaking meaningful progress\n\nThe path towards comprehensive crypto regulation is obscured by two significant obstacles, which must be addressed urgently for the sector\u2019s responsible advancement.\n\nFirstly, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) must establish a formal position on Ethereum. Given the SEC\u2019s historical inaction in restraining Ethereum\u2019s growth when opportunities were present, it has inadvertently fostered an environment where investors are left in regulatory limbo. The SEC, as the protector of investors, has a duty to provide some form of regulatory guidance\u2014even if it proves to be temporary\u2014to offer a foundational starting point and eliminate the current state of speculation. The lack of clear regulation is not merely an inconvenience; it is a failure to provide the necessary protections for participants in an increasingly significant market.\n\nSecondly, authentic, open-ended discussions about the nature of digital assets are crucial. This implies engaging in conversations devoid of preconceived notions, biases, ideological posturing, or empty rhetoric. We often speak of making space to \u201chave the conversation,\u201d but acknowledging that conversation needs to take place and actually having one are two very different exercises indeed. Perhaps everyone in the industry\u2014as well as those watching over it\u2014would benefit from practicing the latter.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Ethereum has grown in popularity over time. Because of its rising usage, ETH has become a popular cryptocurrency and has evolved into the second-largest one. Even though there are multiple sites for buying, trading, and sending Ethereum, users wonder whether they can do the same on the Cash App.\n\nEven though the application is called \u201cCash App,\u201d it allows users to send and receive Bitcoin. However, can users buy Ethereum using the app? Before that, let us get to know the app a little better.\n\nWhat is Cash App?\n\nThe Cash App, which was formerly known as Square Cash, is a mobile payment service that was released in 2013. It was developed by Square, Inc., with its services available in the US and the UK.\n\nUsing a smartphone app, users can send and receive money between and among friends, family, and companies. Peer-to-peer money transfers, the opportunity to buy and sell Bitcoin, a card to make purchases, and the choice to invest in stocks and cryptocurrencies are just a few of the features offered by the app.\n\nTo ensure smooth transactions, users may connect their bank accounts or debit cards to their Cash App account. Because of its straightforward layout and practical payment alternatives, it has become increasingly popular.\n\nAlso read: How to Stake BNB?\n\nCan you buy Ethereum on Cash App?\n\nThe app does not currently support the purchase of Ethereum. While users can buy Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash through the app, Ethereum is not available for direct purchase on the platform.\n\nTo acquire Ethereum, individuals will need to utilize alternative cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase or Gemini. Both of these offer Ethereum trading options. It\u2019s important to note that cryptocurrency offerings can change over time, so it is recommended to verify the available options on the app to always double-check."

Therefore, a breakout above the overhead barrier of $1922 indicates the next significant resistance is directly at $2000 followed by $2138.\n\nIn addition, the low of the June 2nd candle stands as a important support, and therefore breakdown below it will offset the bullish thesis.\n\nWill Ethereum Price Ready to Hit $2000?\n\nThe wedge pattern breakout was a sign of a trend reversal which set the ETH price on a recovery path. In technical analysis, the swing highs formed during the development of the chart pattern are the significant target. Therefore, if the buyer breach $1922 in the coming week, the price will witness a sharp rally to $2000.\n\nBollinger Band: An uptick in the higher band of BB indicator projects the buying is still aggressive.\n\nStochastic: The indicator slopes K%(blue) and D%(orange) have spent most time above the 80% mark in the past few months, indicating the Ethereum coin is an outperformer."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nGlobal investment manager VanEck predicts that the price of ETH will reach $11,800 in 2030 and that ETH will become a competitor to U.S. Treasury bonds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVanEck discounted Ethereum at 12% to calculate its value in current dollars, finding that in the base case, the discounted price today is $5,359.71.\n\nVanEck, which manages a $69 billion ETF, predicts that the price of ETH will reach $11,800 in 2030, and ETH will become a competitor of U.S. Treasury bonds. The specific valuation methods are cash flow forecast and FDV calculation. https://t.co/bxTUJ3T4t3 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 5, 2023\n\nThis is stated in a report written by Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets, and Patrick Bush, a research senior investment analyst for digital assets.\n\nIn this report, VanEck presents the results of its analysis and offers a clear valuation methodology for Ethereum, taking into account transaction fees, MEV and \"security as a service.\"\n\nAdditionally, it evaluates market share across key sectors and investigates Ethereum's potential as a store of value in the burgeoning cryptocurrency market.\n\nVanEck projects that by 2030, ETH network revenue will have increased from a yearly average of $2.6 billion to $51 billion. This is predicated on the assumption that ETH controls 70% of the market for smart contract protocols.\n\nAccording to VanEck researchers' base case, Ethereum would generate $51 billion in revenue during the fiscal year that ends on April 30, 2030. It subtracts 1% for a validator fee and 15% for the global tax rate from this amount to get cash flows to Ethereum of $42.90 billion.\n\nThus, it arrives at a base-case 2030 price target of $11,848 per token. This is discounted to a current price of $5,300 at a 12% cost of capital derived from ETH's recent beta.\n\nEthereum to see economic shift\n\nThe main objective of Ethereum's EIP-4844, often known as \"proto-danksharding,\" is to increase the scalability of Ethereum.\n\nIt is intended to be deployed during the Deneb-Cancun upgrade, which is scheduled to occur in the latter half of Q3 or the first quarter of Q4, 2023.\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock, the introduction of EIP-4844 is expected to dramatically cut the costs associated with using Ethereum Layer 2 solutions, which are predicted to be at least 10 times lower and possibly even up to 100 times lower.\n\nAlthough there may be a short-term decrease in ETH burning due to the fee reduction on L2 solutions, the development of Ethereum's total economic activity is anticipated to lead to greater value accumulation in the medium term."

        "content": "Ethereum holders with more than 10,000 ETH declined to a two-year low.\n\nETH staking continues to increase as ETH attempts to break the $2,000 price barrier\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] holder metrics have been on a downward trend lately, indicating a decline in some key aspects. Recent data revealed that the number of certain ETH cohorts has reached an all-time low.\n\nAs holders appear to be diminishing, examining the state of ETH staking and its price dynamics becomes intriguing.\n\nEthereum holders decline\n\nRecent data from Glassnode Alert revealed a concerning trend in Ethereum cohorts holding over 10,000 ETH. The chart on Glassnode showed a gradual decline since April, with a steeper drop observed in May.\n\nAs of this writing, there were only 1,139 holders with more than 10,000 coins, marking a two-year low for this metric. To provide context, back in February, the number stood at approximately 1,213.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s supply on exchanges also experienced a decline in recent months, adding to the enigma surrounding ETH holdings. This decline is noteworthy, particularly considering the Shappella upgrade and ETH staking activation.\n\nMassive outflow dominates Ethereum flow\n\nThe Netflow metric on Glassnode provided insight into Ethereum\u2019s recent activity, revealing a significant level of movement. However, a predominant pattern observed on the chart was negative flow, indicating more outflow than inflow.\n\nAs of this writing, the Netflow showed a negative value surpassing 70,000 ETH. Notably, on March 26, there was a substantial outflow of over 451,000 ETH, marking the highest negative flow since February.\n\nThis observation suggested that the holdings released by various cohorts, particularly the 10,000 ETH holders, might not be immediately entering the market for sale on exchanges. Instead, it was plausible that these holdings were being directed toward ETH staking activities.\n\nETH staking landscape\n\nThe Ethereum total value staked demonstrated a clear and consistent upward trajectory, evident from observing the chart. It revealed a daily increase in the value of staked ETH, with new all-time highs achieved almost daily.\n\nAs of this writing, the total value staked surpassed 24 million ETH. To put this into perspective, just a day prior, it was slightly above 23 million ETH, signifying an impressive addition of nearly a million ETH in 24 hours.\n\nFurthermore, the total number of deposits also exhibited an upward trend, closely reflecting the uptrend in the total value staked. There were over 778,000 deposits at press time, further emphasizing the continuous growth in this metric.\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nEthereum price trend\n\nExamining the Ethereum price trend on a daily timeframe chart revealed a recent breakthrough above its short Moving Average (MA), represented by the yellow line. This breakout coincided with a 2.4% price increase observed on June 2. ,\n\nEthereum was trading at around $1,900 at press time, experiencing a slight loss. The current price level brought it closer to the $2,000 region, which was a psychological barrier for Ethereum\u2019s price."

        "content": "TRX has been bridged to Ethereum, according to an announcement from TRON founder and former CEO Justin Sun.\n\nTRON\u2019s TRX token has been introduced to the competing Ethereum blockchain thanks to an official effort to bridge the asset across the two networks.\n\nTRX Is Live On Ethereum\n\nJustin Sun, the founder and former CEO of TRON, wrote on Twitter:\n\n\u201c[TRON] has now expanded its reach by going live on the Ethereum blockchain ... TRX is now fully accessible within the Ethereum ecosystem.\u201d\n\nSun said that TRX was added to Ethereum via BitTorrent Bridge, a feature of TRON's BitTorrent Chain (BTTC). Sun and TRON began to acquire the BitTorrent brand in 2018 and have launched numerous products under the BitTorrent banner since then.\n\nTRX\u2019s price has seemingly benefited from the news. The token's value gained 10% over 24 hours on June 2 \u2014 the same day that the feature was announced. Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market saw gains of just 1.2% over the same 24-hour period.\n\nThough market speculation may have boosted prices, the actual use of TRX on Ethereum appears to be limited. Etherscan data indicated that just 29 addresses held the coin and that just 119 transfers took place on the first day of availability.\n\nEthereum Remains Dominant\n\nTRON's blockchain went live in 2018, about three years after Ethereum\u2019s 2015 launch. The two chains share some features, such as support for custom tokens, support for decentralized applications, high transaction throughput, and staking support.\n\nThough both blockchains are generally considered competitors, Ethereum (ETH) is by far the more successful project. Its token, ETH, is the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, with a total supply valued at $228 billion.\n\nTRON (TRX) has a considerably lower market cap of $7.5 billion but remains squarely among the top ten assets by market cap as it ranks at #7.\n\nEthereum (ETH) also has a higher trading volume. ETH had a $6.8 billion 24-hour trading volume on June 2, while TRON (TRX) reported a $580 million trading volume.\n\nTRON is also highly controversial. The most recent of those controversies concerns a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It alleged that Sun, TRON, and related parties illegally offered securities and engaged in wash trading."

        "content": "Cardano is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies today. A dedicated community of investors and users back this long-standing top-10 cryptocurrency. With smart contracts enabled on Cardano, we\u2019re seeing more DeFi, NFT, and other projects choosing Cardano.\n\nEven with its many advantages, ADA\u2019s price has decreased since the mainnet launched in 2017. After surviving the bear market of 2018-2019, the coin enjoyed a great rally in 2021.\n\nThere was about $95 billion in market capitalization when Cardano reached its all-time high at $3.10. On the other hand, some Cardano investors think the upside is much higher, and $100 is a common price target. Can it happen?\n\nBefore we decide whether the Cardano coin price can hit $100, let\u2019s talk about how it compares to Ethereum\u2019s market cap.\n\nCardano \u2013 Proof-of-Stake smart contract platform\n\nCharles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Ethereum, launched the Cardano blockchain project in 2015. An Initial Coin Offering (ICO) raised nearly $62 million for Cardano\u2019s development.\n\nThe Cardano mainnet launched in September 2017 with limited functionality. Cardano got a series of upgrades over the next few years that improved its decentralization and added smart contracts and Proof-of-Stake.\n\nThe Cardano blockchain uses ADA as its native asset. The ADA token helps the network pay transaction fees, incentivizing validators to keep it secure.\n\nCardano\u2019s ambitious roadmap and methodical development approach are heavily influenced by peer review. The Cardano blockchain\u2019s consensus protocol, Ouroboros, is a provably secure Proof-of-Stake protocol.\n\nCardano uses the EUTXO (Extended Unspent Transaction Output) model for its transactions, which makes it unique. The smart contract language Cardano uses, Plutus, is suited to formal verification because it\u2019s written in Haskell.\n\nCan Cardano reach $100?\n\nCardano should be compared to Ethereum if you\u2019re looking for a smart contract platform. Ethereum was worth $550 billion at its peak.\n\nCardano\u2019s native asset ADA is currently circulating at approximately 34 billion coins. If ADA were $100, Cardano\u2019s market cap would be $3.4 trillion, about six times greater than Ethereum.\n\nADA Price Implied Market Cap $5 $170 Billion $10 $340 Billion $20 $680 Billion $50 $1.7 Trillion $100 $3.4 Trillion\n\nThe calculations say there are 34 billion ADA in supply.\n\nCardano\u2019s low adoption makes it hard to match Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization and surpass it by a factor of 6. Cardano users make about 62,000 transactions daily, while Ethereum users make about 950,000.\n\nThe market cap for all cryptocurrencies was $2.9 trillion in November 2021. By January 2023, Cardano will also have $3.4 trillion in market capitalization at $100 per ADA. Apple has a market cap of $2.2 trillion, Saudi Aramco has a market cap of $1.9 trillion, and Microsoft has a market cap of $1.8 trillion.\n\nADA has a hard time reaching $100 based on these two comparisons alone. An asset with a market cap of $12.7 billion must rise 270x to reach $100. ADA can only reach $100 by reducing its supply. Since there\u2019s no burning mechanism, ADA\u2019s supply will only decrease slightly in the future.\n\nCardano price prediction \u2013 Will Cardano rise?\n\nThe price of Cardano still has the potential to rise, even though it seems unlikely in practical scenarios.\n\nThe project has a lot of key milestones to hit, so Cardano still has lots of upside potential. There are five major phases in Cardano development, also known as eras. Here\u2019s how they work:\n\n\u25cf Byron \u2013 Foundation\n\n\u25cf Shelley \u2013 Decentralization\n\n\u25cf Goguen \u2013 Smart contracts\n\n\u25cf Basho \u2013 Scaling\n\n\u25cf Voltaire \u2013 Governance\n\nWhile progress along these roadmap phases is sometimes linear, the Cardano project is now in the smart contracts phase. Currently, the project is focusing on improving Cardano\u2019s smart contract capabilities.\n\nConclusion\n\nCardano does not have a realistic chance of hitting $100 since that would mean a market cap of about $3.4 trillion. There needs to be more adoption or potential for Cardano to speculate on such a valuation.\n\nCan Cardano go high? Well, some crypto investors do not think Cardano is dead, but if there is a major cryptocurrency bull run shortly, it will reach and surpass its current high. It\u2019s more likely to happen if Cardano developers keep executing their ambitious roadmap.\n\nEven though the crypto market is cyclical, no cryptocurrency is guaranteed to reach its all-time highs. Crypto projects peaked during the 2017 bullish run and still have not matched their all-time highs.\n\nDisclaimer: GeekWire newsroom and editorial staff were not involved in the creation of this content.."

General Market Momentum: In addition to the specific developments in the Layer 2 space, Sassano also anticipates a potentially heated market overall in 2024. While this prediction is based on his own intuition, it further bolsters the notion of a promising \u201clayer 2 summer\u201d next year.\n\nPotential Layer 2 Projects Set To Rally\n\nWith the above-mentioned factors, there\u2019s no doubt Ethereum\u2019s price could be set for an explosive run next year. However, there are a few other crypto projects built on top of it which could possibly create new all-time highs as well:\n\nPolygon (MATIC): Touted as the most robust Layer 2 solution, Polygon boasts a slew of crypto projects harnessnig its technology with notable partnerships which include like Nike, Adobe, Starbucks and even facilitated the minting of former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s NFTs.\n\nTouted as the most robust Layer 2 solution, Polygon boasts a slew of crypto projects harnessnig its technology with notable partnerships which include like Nike, Adobe, Starbucks and even facilitated the minting of former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s NFTs.

It is on the edge of having a breakout\u2026\n\nI think the halving is going to take place in (August), which means that we still have six to eight weeks before it takes place. I think having a very strong rally is definitely likely if it breaks through $100.\n\nIf it breaks through $100\u2026 so then I\u2019m assuming we\u2019re going to peak out around the area of $160 to $180.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Litecoin is trading for $93.39, a slight decrease in the last 24 hours.\n\nVan de Poppe also says that the leading smart contract platform Ethereum is also in the same boat. According to the crypto strategist, ETH has a chance to take out its immediate resistance as long as it is trading above $1,800.\n\n\u201cOnce we start to take these out ($1,903), I think we can start accelerating towards $2,800. So as long as Ether stays above $1,800, I think this can actually go quite fast.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is worth $1,881, a fractional decrease on the day.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Well, this might seem to be an optimistic development, however, there\u2019s a catch. Zooming out and shedding light on the whole picture, the blockchain data and research platform tweeted,\n\n\u201cNew NFT mints have been on a decline since summer, with NFTs minted in May being 65% lower than that in April, AND the lowest it\u2019s been since June \u201921.\u201d\n\nTypically, whenever a new collection is minted, the percentage of new mints in profit is higher in the first month. However, that starts dropping after a few months, as illustrated below.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto, NFTs: UAE Central Bank Issues New AML, CTF Guidance for Institutions\n\nMacro state of affairs in the NFT market\n\nThe mint downtrend typically signifies that people are steering away from the NFT market currently.

Specifically, they\u2019ve diminished by 30-50% each in the same period and reflected respective values of 65.5k and 55.4k at press time.\n\nDespite the not-so-appealing trends, Ethereum is currently the top blockchain in terms of sales volume. Other counterparts like Bitcoin, Solana, and Polygon rank lower, for they\u2019ve only managed to settle $40 million to $188 million in volume in the same monthly window.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Flips Cardano, Solana to Claim 2nd Spot in NFT Sales"

Ethereum experienced a slightly less drastic drop of 1.6%, trading at $1,870.\n\nInterestingly, this uptick in social media chatter stands in stark contrast to recent trends in the global interest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nAs reported by U.Today, excitement surrounding cryptocurrencies has noticeably cooled off. Google Trends data shows that global interest in cryptocurrency has dipped to levels not seen since December 2020, marking a significant downturn in public engagement with the crypto sphere.\n\nDespite waning search interest, the increased Twitter conversations might hint at sustained or resurgent interest among a specific group of internet users. It is worth noting that Twitter, with its characteristic brevity and real-time updates, has often been the platform of choice for crypto enthusiasts and experts alike.\n\nNevertheless, it is still too early to declare a definitive rebound in wider public interest in cryptocurrencies based on this social media metric. It would be far-fetched to assume that Twitter chatter might forecast a revival of the struggling crypto market."

        "title": "ERC-4337 and account abstraction: Ethereum's game-changing standard - OKX",
        "content": "The crypto space has witnessed a remarkable variety of new token standards and exciting innovations. For example, the emergence of BRC-20 brought new possibilities to the Bitcoin network.\n\nNow, Ethereum has ERC-4337, which promises exciting new possibilities for the Ethereum ecosystem and wider Web3 adoption. Read on to find out more.\n\nTL;DR\n\nEnhances Ethereum wallets: ERC-4337's smart wallet agreements offer adaptable protection and features, allowing for versatile management of wallets through account abstraction.\n\nSubsidizes transaction fees: Enables subsidies for transactions, ultimately cutting expenses and increasing accessibility to Ethereum.\n\nSupports ERC-20 for fees : Provides the option to pay transaction fees using ERC-20 tokens, expanding the range of choices beyond solely relying on Ether (ETH).\n\nPrioritizes privacy: Combining signatures improves privacy and security, safeguarding personal information while conducting transactions.\n\nUser-friendly innovations: Using elements such as biometric identification and time-based social recovery enhances convenience and protection. This streamlines the process of accessing and retrieving wallets without requiring intricate protocol modifications.\n\nWhat are ERC-4337 and account abstraction?\n\nERC-4337 is an Ethereum standard that gives you access to smart wallet contracts. Smart wallet contracts allow you to program your wallet for greater security and usability through what's called account abstraction. Account abstraction upgrades the Externally Owned Account (EOA) \u2014 an Ethereum account required to interact with the Ethereum network \u2014 so it can be controlled by smart contracts. The result? Greater flexibility to program your own security rules, simpler account recovery should you lose your keys, and the option for social recovery.\n\nERC-4337 also allows for subsidized transaction fees, which means that you may have your transaction costs partially or fully covered by external sources. This opens up possibilities for more affordable and accessible transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nAnother significant feature of ERC-4337 is the ability to pay transaction fees with ERC-20 tokens. This means that instead of paying fees exclusively in Ether (ETH), you can use other tokens built on the Ethereum blockchain to cover transaction costs. This introduces a new level of flexibility and convenience should you hold various ERC-20 tokens in your wallets.\n\nPreserving privacy\n\nAlongside usability, one of the most significant aspects of ERC-4337 is its privacy features, which address concerns about data confidentiality. These features enable you to engage in transactions while safeguarding your privacy and sensitive information. To achieve this, the token standard incorporates aggregated signatures, which enhance security and reduce transaction costs by combining multiple signatures into a single, more efficient signature.\n\nERC-4337 goes beyond technical advancements by introducing user-friendly wallet features. These features include biometric authentication, allowing you to access your wallet using fingerprint or facial recognition to simplify the login process and enhance security.\n\nMeanwhile, time-locked social recovery provides a safety net for wallet access, allowing you to recover your account with the assistance of trusted friends or family members if you lose access to your wallet. What makes ERC-4337 even more remarkable is its implementation as an ERC standard, rather than requiring a complex protocol update.\n\nThis streamlines the adoption process, saving time and effort while providing compatibility with existing Ethereum infrastructure. As a result, the features of ERC-4337 are more readily available to all users, fostering Ethereum's growth and attracting newcomers to the world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe origins of account abstraction\n\nAccount abstraction, an intriguing concept in the Ethereum ecosystem, has been the subject of deliberation and exploration for several years. In 2016, Vitalik Buterin presented EIP-86, a proposal to enable smart contracts to initiate and authorize transactions. However, EIP-86 was never rolled out because it would have required changes to the Ethereum consensus layer.\n\nIn 2020, EIP-2938 and EIP-3074 were introduced, allowing smart contracts to be used as accounts. But similar to EIP-86, these two proposals would also require changes to the Ethereum consensus layer.\n\nIn response, ERC-4337 was proposed in 2021, presenting a solution that enabled account abstraction using a separate mempool. As a result, this approach required no consensus layer modifications.\n\nThe Ethereum community welcomed the introduction of ERC-4337, appreciating its ability to support account abstraction while maintaining the stability and integrity of the network.\n\nPotential drawbacks of ERC-4337\n\nERC-4337 does have some limitations when observing its impact on the Ethereum network.\n\nHigher gas fees\n\nGas fees are a primary drawback. Transactions using the ERC-4337 standard may incur higher gas costs than regular transactions, potentially making them less affordable for certain users. Gas fees are a fundamental part of Ethereum's blockchain, serving as the mechanism for allocating resources and preventing spam and abuse. However, the increased gas costs associated with ERC-4337 could create barriers to adoption and usage, limiting accessibility and hindering widespread acceptance of the standard.\n\nIt's crucial to balance the cost of transactions and the benefits offered by ERC-4337 to guarantee its viability and inclusivity within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nCentralization concerns\n\nAnother challenge for ERC-4337 is the potential for increased centralization. The standard relies heavily on smart contracts to manage accounts, which raises the possibility of a few developers and organizations gaining control over the underlying infrastructure.\n\nThis concentration of power contradicts the decentralized principles that Ethereum aims to uphold. Centralization can introduce risks such as limited transparency, biased decision making, and reduced user trust. Therefore, it's essential to make sure the development and governance of ERC-4337 remains inclusive, transparent, and open to community participation.\n\nAdded complexity\n\nThe arrival of ERC-4337 may bring increased complexity to the Ethereum ecosystem. The standard introduces new concepts and features that may be more challenging for developers to understand and apply effectively. This complexity could lead to errors and security vulnerabilities, potentially compromising the overall stability and security of the Ethereum network.\n\nMitigating the drawbacks\n\nMany believe it's possible to address the drawbacks of ERC-4337 by providing comprehensive documentation, educational resources, and developer support. These actions can help developers to effectively navigate the complexities of ERC-4337 and create secure and robust applications.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nAs Ethereum continues to push boundaries, other blockchains may need to incorporate similar features to remain competitive. This competition could drive innovation, benefiting users by creating a more dynamic and diverse ecosystem of blockchain platforms.\n\nWe're proud to be a part of a collaborative effort in building ERC-7579, along with Rhinestone, Biconomy, and ZeroDev. ERC-7579 tackles a common problem \u2014 the complexity and rigidity of existing standards, notably ERC-6900.\n\nWhile ERC-6900 advanced the development of modular smart accounts, ERC-7579 sought to simplify the approach further. It focused on standardizing essential interfaces for smart accounts and modules, offering developers greater flexibility and creativity without the burden of heavy restrictions.\n\nThe buzz surrounding ERC-7579 is due to the urgent demand in the blockchain arena for a consistent standard that can reduce division and enhance the compatibility of smart accounts.\n\nThe success of ERC-7579 hinges on its compatibility with ERC-4337 for account abstraction. This harmonization of standards allows smart accounts to seamlessly communicate with different decentralized applications (DApps), providing users with a uniform and user-friendly experience, irrespective of the technology used.\n\nBefore ERC-7579, smart accounts functioned independently, posing difficulties for developers to create modules that could work on different platforms.\n\nThe final word\n\nThe blockchain space continues to evolve with notable innovations such as ERC-4337 on Ethereum, which promises enhanced usability and wider Web3 adoption.\n\nThis standard introduces smart contract wallets with customizable security and simplified account recovery. It also uses ERC-20 tokens for transaction fees, making it more accessible and user-friendly without complicated protocol changes.\n\nThe development of ERC-7579 seeks to simplify blockchain standards by focusing on essential smart account interfaces. By improving compatibility and effectiveness between various platforms, ERC-7579 can effectively work alongside ERC-4337.\n\nThese developments mark a significant stride towards creating a more cohesive and accessible blockchain network, and could significantly strengthen Ethereum's position in the blockchain space."

        "title": "How Ethereum on exchanges dropped to a 5-year low - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum on exchanges hits a five-year low.\n\nThe number of ETH holders grows steadily as the price hovers around $1,900.\n\nNew data indicated a dwindling influx of Ethereum onto exchanges in the past few weeks. The most recent chart analysis revealed that the current balance of Ethereum on exchanges reached a new nadir, indicating a decline in overall liquidity on these platforms.\n\nEthereum on exchanges decline\n\nGlassnode Alerts recently unveiled a chart showcasing the ongoing decline of Ethereum on exchanges. It also showed that each passing day marked a new record low.\n\nThe latest data from Glassnode indicated that the current balance of ETH on exchanges stood at approximately 17.2 million, marking the lowest point witnessed in the past five years.\n\nComparatively, back in January, the balance on exchanges exceeded 19 million; at the start of May, it surpassed 18 million.\n\nThis downward trend implied a reduction in available liquidity within exchanges. However, it is important to note that a decrease in ETH on exchanges does not necessarily indicate a decrease in ETH holders.\n\nEthereum holders remain steady\n\nWhile it may seem that Ethereum is leaving exchanges at a higher rate than it is being deposited, the dynamics surrounding the total number of ETH holders tell a different story.\n\nThe Santiment chart showed a steady increase in the number of ETH holders. Currently, approximately 100 million individuals hold varying amounts of ETH.\n\nThis growth has been gradual, with around 98.4 million holders reported at the end of April.\n\nThe declining balance on exchanges and the simultaneous growth in the number of holders can be attributed to two main factors: self-custody and staking.\n\nFirstly, more individuals opt for self-custody, holding their ETH in personal wallets rather than leaving them on centralized exchanges. It provides users with greater control and security over their assets.\n\nSecondly, staking has become increasingly popular. Staking involves locking up a certain amount of Ethereum to participate in the network\u2019s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nIn return for securing the network, stakers receive rewards in the form of additional ETH. It incentivizes users to hold their ETH in staking contracts rather than on exchanges. As of this writing, the total number of ETH deposits for staking was over 780,000 and growing.\n\nThe ETH TVL and price\n\nAccording to data from DefiLlama, Ethereum\u2019s dominance in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL) remained steadfast. As of this writing, the TVL stood at approximately $27.35 billion, accounting for over half of the overall TVL.\n\nThis signified a continual influx of liquidity into the Ethereum ecosystem, emphasizing ETH\u2019s ongoing relevance and significance.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today\n\nAdditionally, a glance at CoinMarketCap data revealed that ETH boasted the third-highest trading volume in the last 24 hours. The total volume of the entire cryptocurrency market surpassed $19 billion, with ETH contributing over $3 billion in trading volume.\n\nFurthermore, ETH maintained its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, trailing behind Bitcoin. As of this writing, ETH was trading at approximately $1,900."

        "content": "Memecoins and MEV bot activity affected Ethereum\u2019s gas usage.\n\nRise in NFT trades, increased selling pressure on ETH holders, and shifting trader behavior observed.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] historically high gas prices have often deterred users from using the network, leading them to explore alternative protocols. However, the recent decline in gas usage could have positive implications for both Ethereum and ETH in the future.\n\nEthereum is gassed up\n\nAccording to Dune Analytics, Ethereum\u2019s daily average gas reached its lowest point in the past two months. As of 3 June, the average gas stood at 24gwei, with the press time gas at 17gwei.\n\nThe decrease in gas fees may be attributed to the recent hype surrounding memecoins, which has increased activity on the network. The utilization of Miner Extractable Value (MEV) bots could have further contributed to the decline as well.\n\nMEV bots are automated systems that leverage transaction sequencing to exploit profitable opportunities in the Ethereum network. The prevalence of these bots can impact gas fees by optimizing transaction execution, potentially reducing costs for users.\n\nThe NFT angle\n\nThere was consistent gas usage in the Ethereum protocol, facilitated by low gas fees. Moreover, the number of NFT trades on the Ethereum network rose alongside.\n\nNotably, prominent blue-chip NFTs like MAYC and Azuki drove the surge in NFT volume. DappRadar\u2019s data indicated that over the past week, the volume of these NFTs increased by 29.9% and 129% respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, ETH, was trading at $1,873 at press time. The coin\u2019s MVRV (Market-Value-to-Realized-Value) ratio increased over the last month, suggesting that the profitability of addresses holding ETH is relatively high.\n\nThis could incentivize these address holders to sell and secure profits, potentially impacting the price of ETH in the near future.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nLastly, the put-to-call ratio for Ethereum has declined during this period. This indicates a shift in trader behavior, with a decreased interest in protective put options relative to call options.\n\nSuch a trend may suggest growing optimism among traders regarding the future price movement of Ethereum."

        "content": "Quick take:\n\nA report by Nansen indicates that 67% of newly minted Ethereum NFTs are profitable.\n\nThe report also points out the declining number of new NFTs mints since the summer.\n\nThe current number of mints is the lowest since June 2021.\n\nThe NFT market has plummeted since June last year. Some say NFTs are dead, while others try to avoid being associated with the term completely. Yet despite the slump, Nansen Research has come up with some interesting statistics.\n\nAccording to a report published Monday, 67% of freshly minted Ethereum NFTs are profitable, which means their floor prices remain above the auction price.\n\nHowever, according to Nansen Research, new NFT mints have been on a decline since the summer, which could explain why the profitability rate remains high.\n\n\u201cNew NFT mints have been on a decline since summer, with NFTs minted in May being 65% lower than that in April, AND the lowest it\u2019s been since June \u201921,\u201d the company wrote in a tweet.\n\nSource: Nansen.ai/Twitter\n\nAs demonstrated in the graph above, NFT profits tend to be higher in the first few days after the mint before declining in the days after.\n\nEthereum NFTs still dominate the industry in terms of volume traded. According to a Dune Analytics board prepared by Hildobby, Ethereum NFTs generated nearly $139 million in transaction volume in May 2023, excluding wash trading. That is a significant decline from this year\u2019s best month of more than $650 million reported in February.\n\nSource: Hildobdy/Dune Analytics\n\nNonetheless, the data shows that the NFT market has rebounded significantly since the start of the year compared to the decline experienced in the second half of 2022.\n\nThe NFT market registered the best period during the first quarter of 2022, largely driven by the launch of the LooksRare NFT marketplace and X2Y2, albeit with significant volume driven by wash trading activity.\n\nA significant bump witnessed in February this year was a result of a ripple effect created by the emergence of Ordinals NFTs, which seemed to reignite the market.\n\n****\n\nStay up to date:\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter using this link \u2013 we won\u2019t spam!"

        "content": "Starknet is an open-source framework designed to enhance scalability and privacy for decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nStarknet has experienced significant growth in usage by various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on the network in recent months leading to a notable increase in its total value locked (TVL), which represents the amount of cryptocurrency assets secured within the protocol.\n\nAt the time of writing, Starknet\u2019s TVL is reported to be about $12 million. This represents a significant ten-fold increase compared to the TVL just 3 months ago.\n\nTotal Value Locked (TVL) is a widely used metric in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. It represents the total value of assets, typically in the form of cryptocurrencies, that are locked or deposited within a specific DeFi protocol, platform, or smart contract.\n\nTVL is used as an indicator of the level of activity and liquidity within the protocol, providing insights into its popularity and the extent to which users trust it with their assets.\n\nHow Starknet Scales Ethereum\n\nStarknet, developed by Israeli-based company, StarkWare, enhances the Ethereum network\u2019s performance by enabling off-chain computations and data storage while maintaining the security guarantees provided by the underlying blockchain.\n\nBy moving computations off-chain and storing only the necessary data on-chain, Starknet aims to improve transaction throughput and reduce transaction fees. This is achieved through a technology called ZK-rollups, which allows for the aggregation of multiple off-chain transactions into a single on-chain proof. This approach enhances scalability while preserving the decentralized and trustless nature of Ethereum.\n\n\u201cI certainly cannot give any investment advice, but there are many many developers that understand that in order to unleash Ethereum\u2019s scale reaching a global demand, you need new, safe, and battle-tested technologies,\u201d StarkWare President and Co-Founder, Eli Ben-Sasson, said in a recent interview, adding that Starknet is already recognized as a \u2018hell of a technology stack.\u2019\n\nStarknet utilizes a layer-2 scaling technique called zero-knowledge rollups to achieve scalability and cost-efficiency. Zero-knowledge rollups bundle numerous transactions together off-chain, known as the data availability layer, and generate a succinct proof that attests to the validity of these transactions. This proof is then submitted and verified on the Ethereum blockchain, known as the execution layer.\n\nJediSwap, a permissionless automated market maker (AMM) is currently the major player in the Starknet ecosystem, commanding over 57% of the TVL, which amounts to more than $6 million.\n\nStarknet is however under stiff competition in the Ethereum layer two market with the likes of Arbitrum and Optimism, for example, commanding TVLs of $2.4 billion and $884 million, respectively. The growth of these two, some of the earliest scaling technologies, comes following swift adoption among DeFi heavyweights on each network, including Uniswap, Aave, and Curve.\n\nStarknet, on its part, points to Cairo, a programming language inspired by Rust, as the key behind its growth. According to Ben Sasson, Cairo is \u2018the most modern and best smart contract language out there that developers are flocking to.\u2019\n\nSasson adds that Starknet is scheduled to upgrade to version 0.12 in June 2023 and is anticipated to bring notable improvements, particularly in terms of increased throughput.\n\nFollow us on Twitter for latest posts and updates\n\n____________________________________\n\n____________________________________"

This innovative application empowers users to customize their search results by setting specific parameters using publicly available data from the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe Advanced Filter acts as a search spotlight, allowing users to narrow down results based on their specific requirements. This focused search tool enables users to delve into the most relevant data points for their research, transaction tracking, or investigative needs.\n\nOne notable advantage of the Advanced Filter is its potential to enhance monitoring capabilities for non-fungible token (NFT) lending operations on platforms like Blur. Analysts can swiftly identify leading NFT collections utilized as loan securities using the filters. The tool also provides data on loan requests, identifying popular NFT collections in the lending sphere and assessing the demand for NFT-backed loans.\n\nWhile this tool shows promise, it is still a work in progress and requires refinement. Presently, the filter does not exclude tokens with unfavorable reputations, and there is no option to maintain a blacklist. Nonetheless, news of this development has generated enthusiasm among data analysts and blockchain investigators on Twitter. Many believe that this tool could significantly streamline the process of tracing fund movements associated with fraudulent activities and breaches.\n\nSuggestions for further enhancements have also emerged, including integrating public address name tags into Etherscan's API. Such enhancements could reduce the time spent manually combing through the website for on-chain sleuths. If realized, these advancements could pave the way for more intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly blockchain analysis tools in the future.\n\nTokenPost | [email protected]"

        "title": "Ethereum gas fees rising amid meme coin hype - crypto.news",
        "content": "It is widely recognized that cryptocurrencies are subject to volatility, which is no longer a surprising fact. The crypto winter in 2022 led to several incidents and events that brought digital currencies to the forefront of discussions. As anticipated, much of the attention revolved around bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH), the two largest coins in terms of market capitalization.\n\nWhile in the case of bitcoin, the focus fell entirely on the price drop, Ethereum made the news for several other reasons.\n\nThere are plenty of resources out there on how to open an account on an exchange platform or how to buy Ethereum. However, the most crucial step when getting into crypto is research. One must learn about the project\u2019s history and development to understand its pros and cons and make informed trading and investing decisions.\n\nYou might also like: Binance launches 10 week summer internship program\n\nSo, Ethereum\u2019s evolution over the past months has been interesting. After undergoing its biggest upgrade since inception, known as the Merge, on Sep. 15, 2022, Ethereum managed to complete the final step in the long-awaited transition from proof-of-work (POW) to proof-of-stake (POS) with its latest upgrade, Shanghai, which took place on April 12, 2023.\n\nEthereum is again in the spotlight due to its rising gas fees that reached a 12-month high of 240 gwei on May 5; an increase most likely fueled by the buzz surrounding meme coins.\n\nEthereum gas fees explained\n\nFor individuals not well-versed in the Ethereum network, explaining gas fees and their significance is crucial. Ethereum encompasses more than just a cryptocurrency that can be purchased or traded on exchange platforms.\n\nIt is a decentralized open-source blockchain platform with numerous use cases and applications, accompanied by its native coin called ether (ETH).\n\nAlthough \u201cEthereum\u201d and \u201cEther\u201d are sometimes used interchangeably, they refer to distinct entities, which can lead to confusion.\n\nTherefore, the Ethereum platform can be used to develop other crypto projects, conduct transactions and run smart contracts. However, to carry out these actions, users must pay certain fees for utilizing the network\u2019s resources, commonly called gas.\n\nThis represents the computational effort required for the execution of an operation on the Ethereum network. The gas price is expressed in gwei, tiny fractions of ether. One gwei is worth 0.000000001 ETH.\n\nGas prices also vary based on supply and demand and the volume of validation requests on the network.\n\nOn top of that, gas fees serve as an incentive for Ethereum validators, as they get to receive these fees for staking their tokens, verifying transactions, and adding new blocks to the blockchain. As a result, higher gas fees may lead to faster transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nHow the new meme coin season is rising Ethereum gas fees\n\nPaying gas fees is not a new practice for Ethereum users since this feature has been embedded in the platform\u2019s structure since the beginning. However, using the Ethereum network has become costlier as gas fees rise, reaching unprecedented levels. A recent analysis shows that a user had to pay a whopping $118,600 worth of ETH for only one transaction.\n\nGas fees have fluctuated significantly, so these rising values are expected. In May 2022, the gas price hit a high of 150 gwei. In the months leading to the Merge, the price gradually dropped and hovered around 20 gwei.\n\nTherefore, it was less common for gas fees to spike after the completion of the upgrade. Although the Merge didn\u2019t target this issue directly, lowering gas fees was viewed as a by-product of the overhaul, given that switching from miners to validators was expected to help de-congest the Ethereum network.\n\nHowever, since gas fees have gone up by more than 50% since April, it\u2019s clear that these expectations haven\u2019t been met. This unexpected surge is probably caused by the latest meme hype that has taken over the crypto sphere. The rise in activity on the Ethereum network coincides with listing the newly-launched meme coin, PEPE, on Binance can\u2019t be just a mere coincidence.\n\nAfter being pushed to the fringes of the crypto industry, the meme scene has entered a period of revival with the emergence of the PEPE token, an Ethereum-based meme coin that has been making waves in the crypto sphere. It began in April this year when the number of active addresses on Ethereum increased by 20,000 since November 2021.\n\nSince PEPE is now listed on all major crypto exchanges and its price soared over a few days, traders wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to cash in on the hype. With more people jumping on the meme bandwagon, the Ethereum network saw a spike in user activity. As a direct consequence, gas fees rose in tandem.\n\nHigher gas prices translate into higher revenue for the network. The fact that users are also eager to trade new coins shows that they\u2019re gaining more confidence, which can help solidify Ethereum\u2019s position in the market. However, there\u2019s also a downside to these events.\n\nGas fees have always been a highly debated topic among crypto enthusiasts and for a good reason. As the gas price rises, it can impede users who want to perform low-value transactions or smart contracts.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to say if gas fees will return to more reasonable values as the meme craze cools off. However, it\u2019s helpful to monitor this association closely from now on.\n\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

        "content": "Avorak Trade has been making waves in the crypto market while still in development. With the Ethereum (ETH) holding price better than Bitcoin (BTC), investors wonder whether Avorak Trade can help.\n\nEthereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) price\n\nCorrelations are incredibly important in the crypto markets. The correlation between the Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) prices was close to 1.0, which made it less crucial to track. However, recent reports indicate a decline in the correlation, dropping from 0.95 in mid-March to 0.82 in mid-April. ETH is gaining more value in relation to BTC as time progresses. This shift could be attributed to various factors, including Ethereum\u2019s recent technical upgrades. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s diversified ecosystem, encompassing decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, blockchain gaming, and more, sets it apart from Bitcoin, which is primarily used as a payment method. Investors increasingly recognize Ethereum\u2019s potential, and some speculate that with a stronger and more diversified ecosystem, Ethereum could eventually flip Bitcoin.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) recent hard fork, enabling users to withdraw staked Ether, is poised to position the cryptocurrency as a formidable contender against US treasury bills in the coming years, according to VanEck, a US asset manager controlling a $69 billion exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nBecause of this, along with expectations that ETH will account for 70% of smart contract protocols, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency could hit $11,800 in 2030, VanEck said in its recently released Ethereum price prediction report.\n\n\u201cAssuming ETH takes a 70% market among smart contract protocols, this implies a token price of $11.8k in 2030, which we discount to $5.3k today at a 12% cost of capital derived from ETH\u2019s recent beta.\u201d \u2013 VanEck wrote in the report.\n\nIf VanEck\u2019s projections were to materialize, it implies that Ethereum would see a price increase of 531% by 2030 from its current levels.\n\nFurther, VanEck also sees ETH network revenues surging from an annual rate of $2.6 billion to as high as $51 billion in 2030.\n\nVanEck\u2019s Calculations\n\nVanEck said the latest price forecast was made using cash flow projections and fully diluted valuation (FDV) calculations. More specifically, the fund manager evaluated Ethereum by estimating cash flows for the year that ended on April 30, 2030.\n\nThe asset manager arrived at its cash flow figures by projecting Ethereum revenues and deducting a global tax rate and a validator revenue cut. Then, VanEck said it used multiple estimates by applying a long-term estimated cash flow of 7%, minus the long-term crypto growth rate of 4%.\n\nFinally, the investment arrived at the FDV in 2030, divided that figure by the expected number of tokens in circulation, and discounted the final number by 12%.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nAt press time, ETH was changing hands at $1,870, down 1.82% in the past 24 hours.\n\nETH 1-day price data.

Memecoins like Troll (TROLL), APED, and BOBO ranked in the top 10 spenders rather than ETH, Wrapped Ether (WETH), or Tether.\n\n\u26fd\ufe0f A highly unusual shift in top 10 gas burning #altcoins has emerged today. Instead of $ETH, $WETH, and $USDT being at the top of the fee distribution list, we're seeing new assets like $TROLL, $APED, and $BOBO among them. Read our latest deep dive. \ud83d\udc47 https://t.co/7SlmJ59k2m pic.twitter.com/Y2kaLKZTrL \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) April 19, 2023\n\nAccording to the report, memecoins are becoming increasingly popular on decentralized platforms. As a result, mainstream centralized exchanges are taking longer to list them, which is another significant factor in the increase in Ethereum gas fees.\n\nNot only was the Ethereum memecoin craze in May, but Bitcoin Ordinals also saw a substantial increase in popularity. On the bitcoin blockchain, ordinals allow for decentralized storage of digital art. The bitcoin network, as a result, recorded numerous new memecoins, with Pepecoin (PEPE) reaching a $1 billion market cap.\n\nThe first Ordinals were released in January, and by the end of May, there were over 10 million inscriptions of them on the bitcoin blockchain. In May, the total fees paid for inscriptions on Ordinals increased by 700%, and they now stand at 1,639 Bitcoin.\n\nSource: Dune Analytics\n\nDue to the waning memecoin mania, Ethereum gas fees have been reduced and there have been sharp drops in both Ordinals inscriptions and gas fees.\n\nHow the rise of memecoins influenced Ethereum\u2019s gas charges\n\nETH\u2019s historically high gas prices have frequently discouraged users from utilizing the network, prompting them to investigate alternative protocols. However, the current drop in gas consumption may have favorable long-term effects for both Ethereum and ETH.\n\nEthereum is gassed up\n\nAccording to Dune Analytics, the daily average gas price for Ethereum dropped to its lowest point in the preceding two months. As of June 3, the national average gas price was 24 gwei; at press time, it was 17 gwei. Gas prices may have fallen as a result of the current hullabaloo surrounding memecoins, which has increased activity on the network. The use of MEV bots (Miner Extractable Value) may have also contributed to the decline.\n\nSource; Dune Analytics\n\nThe NFT Angle\n\nAutomated systems called MEV bots use transaction sequencing to take advantage of lucrative Ethereum network opportunities. By enhancing transaction execution, these bots\u2019 ubiquity may have an effect on gas prices, possibly lowering user expenses.\n\nLow gas prices made it possible for the Ethereum protocol to have consistent gas usage. The quantity of NFT trades on the Ethereum network also increased at the same time.\n\nSource; Santiment\n\nNotably, the increase in NFT volume was driven by well-known blue-chip NFTs like MAYC and Azuki. According to DappRadar\u2019s data, these NFTs\u2019 volume climbed by 29.9% and 129%, respectively, over the previous week.\n\nAt the time of publication, the price of ETH, the native crypto of Ethereum, was $1,873. The coin\u2019s MVRV (Market-Value-to-Realized-Value) ratio grew over the previous month, indicating that addresses holding ETH are profitable to some extent.\n\nThis would encourage the owners of these addresses to sell and collect gains, which might have an effect on the price of ETH soon.\n\nShapella hard fork and ETH\u2019s price surge: Uncertain impact\n\nHopes that ETH would prosper after switching from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism were dashed, at least temporarily. The price of the coin dropped by 25% in the three months from the date of The Merge to the beginning of 2023, and it didn\u2019t recover to its pre-transition levels until six months later.\n\nThe price of ETH threatened to surpass $2,000 for the first time since May 2022 after the Shapella hard fork on April 12, 2023, but given the post-Merge depression, it is unclear what effect the move will have on the price of the coin.\n\nFollowing a planned takeover by Binance (BNB) and its eventual cancellation, the FTX (FTT) exchange filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, causing a market drop that negatively impacted ETH."

        "content": "In a significant development for the crypto community, Etherescan has unveiled a groundbreaking feature that promises to revolutionize the way users access and interpret on-chain data. With its advanced filter, Etherescan has taken a giant leap forward in making blockchain analytics more accessible and user-friendly, catering to the growing demand for transparency and information in the world of crypto.\n\nEtherscan\u2019s Advance Filter \u2013 What is it?\n\nWhat exactly is the purpose of this new feature? The Advanced Filter is an extremely useful feature that allows users to filter and personalize their search results based on specified criteria. Users can use Etherscan\u2019s Advanced Filter to gain important insights and do customized analyses on the enormous Ethereum blockchain data.\n\nUsers can focus on transactions, addresses, and activities that are most relevant to their research, monitoring, or investigative needs by narrowing search results based on particular criteria.\n\nSource: Etherscan\n\nHow to use the Advance Filter\n\nNote that Advance Filter can be accessed through Etherscan\u2019s address page. The Advance Filter can be used in the following segments:\n\n1. To filter the transaction type\n\nUse this filter to narrow down your analysis to specific transaction categories of interest. How do you go about it?\n\n1. First, select All- and this Includes all the transaction types.\n\n2. Secondly, focus on transactions involving an EOA (Externally Owned Address, or what is referred to as a wallet address) sending ETH directly to other addresses.\n\n3. Then Internal Txs: Transactions that are consequences of smart contract logic triggered by regular transactions.\n\n4. Focus on ERC-20: These are transactions involving ERC-20 tokens.\n\n5. Then, the ERC-721 involves transactions involving non-fungible ERC-721 tokens (NFTs).\n\nSource: Etherscan\n\n6. ERC-1155 for the transactions involving semi-fungible ERC-1155 tokens (SFTs).\n\n7. Deposit: Focuses on transactions involving the deposit of ETH into the Beacon Chain Contract in order to validate Ethereum.\n\n8. Withdrawal: This involves transactions involving the withdrawal of ETH from the Beacon Chain as a result of automatic reward withdrawal or exiting as a validator.\n\n2. Method\n\nThis refers to the function being carried out in a transaction based on the decoded input data. It is part of the transaction\u2019s input data and specifies the name of the function as well as any required parameters. In addition, you can filter by any known function name and method ID. Typical operations include Transfer, Mint, and Swap.\n\nSource: Etherscan\n\n3. Etherscan Advance Filter on Age\n\nThis filter can be used to analyze transactions and activity over different time frames, providing insights into recent or historical events. The \u201cAge\u201d box allows you to choose between predefined time ranges (e.g., last 1h, last 24h, last 7d, last 30d, last 90d) and a custom length.\n\nSource: Etherscan\n\n4. Filter transaction from the said address to the receiver\n\nYou have the option of including or excluding transactions involving certain addresses. This filter also allows for the addition of multiple addresses, allowing for more intricate and precise filtering. You can enter up to 5 Ethereum addresses and choose whether to \u201cInclude\u201d or \u201cExclude\u201d them.\n\nSource: Etherscan\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that if you enter (many) addresses in either the \u201cfrom\u201d or \u201cto\u201d column, the Etherscan Advance filter will display transactions involving any of these addresses. If you use the \u201cExclude\u201d option, the filter will specifically exclude transactions containing the provided address.\n\n5. Etherscan Advance Filter\n\nAccording to the design, transactions can be filtered based on the amount transferred. It can be used to track transactions with predefined value thresholds or to analyze high-value transfers. You can select from predefined amount ranges (for example, 1-10, 1-100, 1-1K, 1-10K, 1-100K, 1-1M) or enter your own.\n\nSource: Etherscan\n\n6. Filter by assets\n\nThis filter allows you to look for transactions involving certain tokens by entering the token\u2019s name, symbol, or contract address. Users can include or exclude transactions relating to the chosen token by selecting the \u201cIs\u201d or \u201cIs Not\u201d options. Popular assets like WBTC, USDC, USDT, DAI, and WETH are also readily available for choosing.\n\nSource: Etherscan\n\nAdditionally, you can save the filter for future use. Here you can view your stored filters. To access this feature, you must sign in to your Etherscan account. The data displayed in the filter corresponds to the available information up to the specified block.\n\nThis is a Beta release, some limitations include:\n\n\u2013 Poor reputation tokens, ignore list tokens, and failed transactions displayed with no option to hide them\n\n\u2013 From and To addresses are only joined by OR operator\n\n\n\nLet us know what you'd like us to add or improve! \ud83d\ude4f \u2014 Etherscan (@etherscan) June 2, 2023\n\nUsing Etherscan\u2019s Advance Filter to analyze DeFi exploits\n\nDeFi exploits can be intricate and involve multiple addresses, necessitating in-depth analysis to obtain a thorough understanding of the incident. In the past, this required launching multiple Etherscan tabs to assemble the puzzle.\n\nFortunately, with Etherscan\u2019s Advanced Filter tool, community members can expedite their analysis by consolidating our findings across multiple filter fields and gaining a clearer view of the exploit.\n\nConsider the case of the Euler exploit, which occurred in March 2023. Because this hack involves a flash loan and numerous tokens, it was critical to concentrate on key transactions. You can accomplish this by filtering the transaction types to include ordinary transactions (txs), ERC-20 token transactions, and internal transactions.\n\nSource: Etherscan\n\nUsing the \u2018IS NOT\u2019 option, you can further focus your research by excluding spammy and irrelevant addresses. You can also specify an amount range to focus on key transactions and exclude irrelevant assets from your research."
