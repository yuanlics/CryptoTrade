        "title": "3 reasons why Ethereum price is down against Bitcoin - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The price of Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH) is trading around a 15-month low versus Bitcoin (BTC), and the lowest since Ethereum switched to proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nCointelegraph takes a closer look at some of the reasons for the continuous drop of the ETH/BTC pair.\n\nEther\u2019s historical price action has changed\n\nIn previous market cycles, Ethereum often outperformed BTC during bullish market trends, but this relationship began to change at the start of 2023. Ether and numerous altcoins struggled as the narrative around altcoins use within Web3, DeFi and NFTs came under pressure in 2022 and 2023.\n\nStringent regulations against the crypto industry, severely muted inflows from retail and institutional investors, an uptick in investors seeking shelter in US-dollar-pegged stablecoins also impacted sentiment for Etheruem.\n\nBitcoin dominance rises\n\nIn addition to a change in Ether\u2019s performance in its BTC pair, ETH was negatively impacted by the steady rise in Bitcoin dominance. As reported by Cointelegraph,\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s market dominance has reached 54%, its highest in the last 30 months, indicating the top cryptocurrency is strengthening just before the halving event scheduled for April 2024.\u201d\n\nBitcoin market dominance chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBitcoin dominance is a measure of BTC\u2019s market capitalization relative to the overall crypto market and it highlights the assets\u2019s strength and if often used by investors as a sentiment gauge. With the Bitcoin halving fast approaching (April 2024) and investors\u2019 belief that a spot BTC ETF is imminent, the drop in Ether\u2019s value in its BTC pair suggests that investors feel more bullish about BTC and possibly allocating less money to Ether investments.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin dominance hits 54% \u2014 Highest in 2.5 years as BTC halving approaches\n\nEthereum price breaks below critical support vs. Bitcoin\n\nThe ETH/BTC pair dropped to 0.050 BTC on Oct. 23 and has remained in a downtrend since then. A notable occurrence was the pair\u2019s fall below its 200-week exponential moving average near 0.058 BTC,which raises the possibility for further downside in the short-term.\n\nAccording to Cointegraph contributor Yashu Gola,\n\n\u201cThe 200-week EMA has historically served as a reliable support level for ETH/BTC bulls. For instance, the pair rebounded 75% three months after testing the wave support in July 2022. Conversely, it dropped over 25% after losing the same support in October 2020.\u201d\n\nThese factors are likely to continue impacting Ethereum's price relative to Bitcoin. The multifaceted market dynamics, investor sentiment and staunch regulatory environment could remain the dominant headwinds against the ETH/BTC pair for the foreseeable future.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Ethereum, often hailed as the pioneer of smart contracts, has cemented its position as the frontrunner in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology.\n\nRecent data reveals that Ethereum was the primary catalyst behind the surge in crypto Total Value Locked (TVL), amassing an impressive 75% of all deposited funds during the past week.\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey began with the groundbreaking innovation of smart contracts. It was the first protocol to introduce this game-changing technology, enabling the creation of self-executing contracts with predefined rules and conditions.\n\nThis innovation laid the foundation for the entire DeFi ecosystem, as it provided the framework for decentralized applications and automated transactions.\n\nOne of the most compelling indicators of Ethereum\u2019s continued dominance is the recent surge in decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes.\n\nIn the past week, Ethereum recorded a historic milestone, with over $9 billion in transactions settled on its network. This marks the highest weekly volume since mid-June and underscores the platform\u2019s pivotal role in facilitating peer-to-peer trading and liquidity provision.\n\n.@ethereum dominated this week\u2019s TVL growth rankings, accounting for $6.68B of the total $8.76B TVL growth across crypto last week. pic.twitter.com/45rqb3Seml \u2014 0xScope (\ud83e\udeac . \ud83e\udeac) (@ScopeProtocol) October 30, 2023\n\nETH Price Dynamics And The BlackRock Factor\n\nAs Ethereum continues to take center stage in the crypto landscape, the question on many investors\u2019 minds is how this data will impact the price of ETH. Currently, according to CoinGecko, Ethereum is trading at $1,798, showing a modest 0.6% increase in the last 24 hours, with a minor 0.9% decrease over the past seven days.\n\nVenture capitalist Arthur Cheong has provided intriguing insights into the potential price trajectory of Ethereum. Cheong, the founder of DeFiance Capital, suggests that ETH could experience a significant rally if a specific scenario unfolds.\n\nHe points to BlackRock, a financial giant, and its application for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF). If BlackRock\u2019s BTC ETF application is successful, it could pave the way for a similar Ethereum ETF application in the future.\n\n\u201cETH is probably the best six to 12 month long among large-cap assets now when BlackRock applies for a spot ETH ETF six to 12 months down the road,\u201d Cheong wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nETH is probably the best 6 to 12m long among large cap assets now when BlackRock applies for spot ETH ETF 6 to 12m down the road. Ethereum\u2019s ESG friendliness and native staking yield will be appealing to institutional investors should BTC spot ETF turn out to be a success. \u2014 Arthur (@Arthur_0x) October 24, 2023\n\nETHUSD currently trading at $1798.3 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nImplications And Future Prospects\n\nThe significance of Ethereum\u2019s role in DeFi and blockchain technology cannot be overstated. Its smart contract functionality revolutionized the crypto space and enabled the birth of countless decentralized applications and platforms. The recent surge in DEX volumes underscores its pivotal role in facilitating crypto trading.\n\nAs the crypto world closely watches developments surrounding BlackRock\u2019s potential ETFs, Ethereum\u2019s future appears promising. Should a BTC spot ETF materialize and pave the way for an Ethereum ETF, institutional investors may flock to Ethereum for its ESG attributes and staking yield opportunities.\n\n(This site\u2019s content should not be construed as investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum is reclaiming dominance relative to its Layer 2 ecosystem, with the daily activity on L2s falling by one-third in the last six weeks.\n\nAccording to L2beat, combined Layer 2 throughput is down 32% since peaking at 64.2 transactions per second (TPS) on Sept. 14, currently sitting at 43.8TPS. For comparison, Ethereum averages 12.6 TPS, a 1.6% increase over the same period.\n\nEthereum posted a brief spike to 18.8 TPS on Sept. 13 \u2014 buoyed by users bridging assets over to Base \u2014 but has consistently trended near 12 TPS throughout 2023.\n\nEthereum Mainnet Reclaims Dominance From Layer 2s\n\nL2 hype dies down\n\nMuch of the Layer 2 drawdown can be attributed to freshly deployed networks experiencing a retraction in activity after an initial wave of hype and incentives.\n\nThe initial frenzy of activity on Base, Coinbase\u2019s OP Stack-based L2, has well and truly died down following its August mainnet launch. Base is now processing just at 3 transactions per second, down from 21.3 TPS on Sept. 14.\n\nZkSync Era\u2019s throughput has slumped 50% since peaking at 15.2 TPS on Aug 26, despite Era now leading the Layer 2 sector by activity. Starknet is also down 53% from its Sep. 9 high at 4.7 TPS.\n\nThe top L2s by total value locked, long-standing incumbents Arbitrum and Optimism, suffered similar retracements. Arbitrum closely follows ZkSync Era with 7.3 TPS, down from a record high of 31.6 TPS amid the airdrop for its ARB token in March.\n\nThe OP Mainnet currently sits at 2.5 TPS, down from 10.4 in late July. However, the OP Labs team has since shifted its focus to supporting other L2s, including Base, with its OP Stack.\n\nDespite the pull-back, Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 project is emerging has succeeded in its mission.\n\nLayer 2 networks are driving more than 4.6 times as much activity than Ethereum\u2019s base layer, meaning Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem is facilitating far greater throughput at a fraction of the cost compared to before its L2 sector took off.\n\nTo continue reading this as well as other DeFi and Web3 news, visit us at thedefiant.io"

        "content": "The largest crypto exchange in the U.S. announced on Thursday that smaller investors, otherwise known as retail traders, are now be able to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum futures on its U.S. platform.\n\nCustomers can access the two new financial products through Coinbase Advanced, an offshoot of the exchange\u2019s main platform that lets investors trade more financially complex crypto products. As opposed to CME, a U.S. derivatives exchange that also sells Bitcoin and Ethereum futures, Coinbase\u2019s offering targets shallower-pocketed traders.\n\n\u201cThese contracts offer lower upfront capital requirements and can be an affordable investment option for a broader range of retail customers,\u201d the company wrote in a blog post announcing the products.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s unveiling of a futures contract in the U.S. for both Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, comes as the exchange looks to diversify its products to compete with the likes of Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world.\n\nFutures allow traders to not only speculate on the future price of an asset but to gamble with more assets than they actually own. Customers can front, for example, $100 as collateral and trade $200 worth of crypto, magnifying their losses and gains as a cryptocurrency\u2019s price waxes and wanes.\n\nBy most estimates, the global trading volume of the crypto derivatives markets, which include futures, far outpaces that of crypto spot markets, or the simple purchase or sale of cryptocurrencies. As of Wednesday, the 24-hour trading volume of crypto derivatives was approximately $37 billion on Binance compared with just about $9 billion in spot, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nBinance dominates the crypto derivatives market. The 24-hour trading volume of its nearest competitors OKX and BitMart was a little more than a fourth of Binance\u2019s. If its recent product announcements are any indication, Coinbase, which has historically been more willing than Binance to play nice with regulators and avoid risky crypto financial instruments, is looking for a slice of that pie.\n\nIn April, the publicly traded crypto exchange announced that it had obtained a regulatory license in Bermuda. In May, it then launched a Bermuda-based offshore exchange, which specializes in futures. And then, in late September, it opened up its offshore exchange to retail investors.\n\nThe exchange\u2019s most recent unveiling of crypto futures, however, is in the U.S., where it obtained a license to sell the risky financial instruments earlier this year."

However, it\u2019s worth noting that the token had gained over 14% over the past week, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nMATIC 24-hr price chart | Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe POL token is designed to support Polygon\u2019s upcoming staking layer. Validators will have the option to re-stake their POL tokens to secure multiple Polygon chains simultaneously. Additionally, they can offer various validation services, including transaction sequencing and proof generation.\n\nPolygon\u2019s ecosystem is diverse, featuring ZkEVM, a layer-2 rollup, PoS Chain, its established Ethereum sidechain, and Supernets, a layer-3 architecture. The project is also in the process of developing Miden, a ZK-STARK-based layer-2 solution.\n\nPOL token not tied to MATIC regulation\n\nAs reported by crypto.news earlier, recent regulatory events do not influence the transition from MATIC to POL. According to Polygon Labs, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s classification of MATIC and other tokens as securities in its lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase has no bearing on this upgrade.\n\nPolygon Labs had initially introduced these changes in June 2023 as part of their Polygon 2.0 roadmap. The roadmap also includes plans for a revamped decentralized governance structure, with a dedicated ecosystem council to oversee smart contract upgrades.\n\nWhile the POL token upgrade is a significant milestone for Polygon, it\u2019s clear that the project has a comprehensive roadmap ahead, promising further advancements in the Layer 2 space.\n\nRead more: Circle incorporates USDC on Polygon\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "The Ethereum layer-2 ecosystem continues to expand and diversify, according to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in a recent blog post. As new scaling solutions emerge, Buterin predicts increasing heterogeneity in layer 2 designs based on specific security and cost tradeoffs.\n\nRollups, validiums, sidechains, and other layer-2 constructions offer different balances between decentralization, security, and scalability. Financial applications demand the highest security guarantees, while social media and gaming can accept some downtime in exchange for lower fees.\n\nButerin notes that projects transitioning from independent layer-1s to Ethereum layer-2s will likely take a gradual, multi-stage approach. Moving all activity to a rollup at once would hurt usability, but waiting too long risks missing the opportunity. Centralized projects and niche layer 1s also want enough decentralization for added security assurances without sacrificing high throughput.\n\nHow differing layer-2s interact with Ethereum\n\nValidiums rely on zero-knowledge proofs to ensure correct computation without storing all data directly on Ethereum. This saves costs compared to rollups, but validiums face data availability risks if operators fail to make data available. Rollups guarantee users can always withdraw funds to the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nDisconnected systems like sidechains offer even lower costs but require trust in a small set of validators. Hybrid approaches are also emerging, such as validiums that allow users to pay for periodic Ethereum data availability.\n\nButerin emphasizes the importance of external chains maintaining tight links to Ethereum. This reduces security risks when bridging Ethereum-native assets and enables shared account abstractions across chains.\n\nValidating bridges can provide validium-level security, proving correct state transitions. However, handling edge cases like 51% of attacks requires a social commitment to coordinate upgrades. Reading Ethereum data and reverting when Ethereum reverts is also critical. Chains that only read Ethereum\u2019s finalized blocks avoid some complexity but give up functionality during periods of low finality.\n\nOverall, Buterin sees merit across a spectrum of layer-2 designs. Applications will continue tailoring solutions to their specific security, scalability, and decentralization needs. However, maintaining connections to Ethereum provides benefits regardless of the architecture. He believes that, as technology progresses, projects can strengthen their ties to Ethereum in stages over time."

The post comes in the wake of a pivotal moment in SOL's history that shook the crypto world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe focal point of Yakovenko's tweet can be traced back to a message Buterin shared on Dec. 30 last year, where he acknowledged the earnest and smart developer community at Solana. At that time, Solana was grappling with the consequences of the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX, which was closely intertwined with the blockchain.\n\nSOL to USD by CoinMarketCap\n\nThis unfortunate incident resulted in a significant drop in the price of SOL, hitting a three-year low of $7.78 per token.\n\nWhat added to the challenge was the dwindling number of developers within the Solana ecosystem, with only approximately 70 left. This raised concerns about the platform's future viability.\n\nCrypto unity\n\nYakovenko's appreciation for Buterin's message extends beyond the competition and rivalry between the Ethereum and Solana communities. He emphasizes that even though the two blockchain ecosystems may have their differences, they are united by the common goal of advancing the industry.\n\nWith all fairness @chainyoda, my read is that Mert isn\u2019t attacking ethereum folks or the community.\n\n\n\nWe are supposed to argue about tech and vision in the search of truth.

Recent reports indicating the behaviour of key metrics may provide insights, potentially revealing the answers within the charts.\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nEthereum supply on exchanges declines as\u2026\n\nAt the time of this report, Ethereum was trading with a minor loss of less than 1%. Notably, despite this slight dip, it remained above the $1,700-mark, hovering closely to the $1,800 price range. Furthermore, the consistent uptrends in Ethereum\u2019s price have coincided with a decreasing supply of ETH on exchanges.\n\nAs reported by Santiment, the decline in ETH supply on exchanges became apparent around October 23rd. Interestingly, this decrease aligned with the day ETH experienced its most significant surge in the recent bullish trend.\n\nAlso, this drop in supply suggested that investors\u2019 confidence had grown, and they were more inclined to purchase and hold Ethereum. Additionally, a further drop in supply could create scarcity and drive up demand. Right now, the supply of ETH on exchanges stands at approximately 10.7 million ETH.\n\nUSDT market cap growth shows liquidity\n\nAnother positive metric indicating a sustained uptrend is the market capitalization of USDT (Tether) in the Ethereum ecosystem. The chart revealed that the USDT market cap has been expanding alongside the rising price of ETH. This increase in USDT\u2019s market cap signified that more liquidity has been entering the market.\n\nThe continuous influx of liquidity is expected to bolster price growth and maintain the ongoing bullish trend.\n\nEthereum\u2019s social dominance and volume wane\n\nAs Ethereum\u2019s price began its ascent, there was a noticeable correlation with its trading volume, evident in the volume chart. According to Santiment, the chart displayed a remarkable spike, surging to over $19 billion during the period of upward price movement. This surge represented the highest trading volume seen in the last five months.\n\nHowever, in more recent times, the volume trend has revealed a decline. At the time of this report, the trading volume had fallen to approximately $7.4 billion. The drop in volume signified a reduction in momentum and a gradual loss of interest from traders.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum was seeing a gradual decline in its social dominance, as indicated by the corresponding chart. The data revealed that ETH\u2019s social dominance had dropped to around 7.2% at the time of this report.\n\nThis decline in the social dominance metric is a sign that discussions and conversations surrounding Ethereum are gradually waning. It also implies a diminishing level of interest in the cryptocurrency \u2013 A negative signal.\n\nPrice could go either way\n\nThe aforementioned metrics collectively indicate that Ethereum\u2019s ongoing uptrend, or a potential reversal, is contingent on a multitude of factors. Notably, the sentiment and behaviour of traders play a pivotal role. If momentum regains strength, with increased liquidity entering the market and traders persisting in their strategy of buying and holding, a price spike will be likely.\n\n\u2013 Is your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nConversely, should the opposite scenario unfold, with reduced momentum and a fall in buying and holding sentiment, a price decline could be on the horizon.\n\nSimply put, Ethereum\u2019s future price movement is closely tied to the actions and sentiments of market participants."

        "title": "Ethereum \u201cNot Yet Ready to Put Everything on A Rollup\u201d, Says Buterin as Layer 2 Projects Surge - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has provided insights into the dynamic and evolving landscape of Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 ecosystem. Buterin\u2019s analysis, published on his blog on Tuesday, October 31, delved into the diverse approaches to scale the Ethereum network while maintaining security and usability.\n\nThe Ethereum layer-2 ecosystem has grown significantly over the past year, with multiple layer-2 protocols and solutions emerging. Among the notable advancements have been Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) rollups, including Arbitrum, Optimism and Scroll, which have made substantial progress in enhancing security and scaling capabilities. Additionally, there are \u201calmost-EVMs\u201d like zkSync, extensions like Arbitrum Stylus, and broader efforts like Starknet and Fuel.\n\nHowever, one of the significant trends in the layer-2 space has been the increasing heterogeneity of projects. Buterin noted that he expects this trend to continue for several reasons. First, some projects operating as independent layer-1 blockchains want to integrate with the Ethereum ecosystem and transition into layer-2 solutions.\n\nHowever, Buterin noted that a gradual transition is preferred, as the technology is not yet fully ready to transition everything to a rollup.\n\n\u201cTransitioning all at once now would cause a decrease in usability, as the technology is not yet ready to put everything on a roll up. Transitioning all at once later risks sacrificing momentum and being too late to be meaningful.\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe crypto mogul also highlighted that centralized projects explore blockchain-based solutions to enhance user security. While these projects may not require the full decentralization of a rollup, they still seek a middle-ground solution. Their high throughput and specific needs may not be suitable for rollups in the short term, as per Buterin.\n\nHe further noted that Non-financial applications, such as games and social media, desire decentralization but may not require the same level of security as financial applications. Different parts of these applications can be treated differently, with high-value activities like username registration and account recovery being done on a rollup. In contrast, lower-value activities like posts and votes may require less security.\n\nButerin also emphasized that the cost of using rollups is a crucial consideration, especially for users from outside the blockchain world. Users are more likely to accept higher fees if they are already accustomed to paying higher prices for on-chain interactions.\n\nThat said, as Ethereum continues to evolve, it is clear that layer-2 scaling solutions will play a critical role in the network\u2019s development. With Ethereum\u2019s next scheduled hard fork introducing \u201cproto-dank sharding\u201d and improving data availability, the ecosystem is poised for further growth and development in the coming years."

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Analyzes Ethereum's Layer 2 Solutions - Blockchain.News - Blockchain.News",
        "content": "On October 31, 2023, Vitalik Buterin discussed Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystem, highlighting trade-offs between Rollups, Validiums, and Disconnected Systems, securing and scalability, pre-confirmations, trustless Ethereum interactions, and potential chain transformation into Validium.\n\nEthereum founder, Vitalik Buterin , delved into the intricacies of Layer 2 (L2) solutions on the Ethereum blockchain in a detailed post dated October 31, 2023. He acknowledged the rapid expansion of the L2 ecosystem, especially the ZK-EVM rollup segment, featuring notable projects such as StarkNet, Arbitrum , Optimism, and Scroll. He lauded the advancements in security, with L2beat mentioned as a good resource for tracking the progress of these projects.\n\nA notable observation by Buterin is the growing heterogeneity within L2 projects. He foresees a continuous trend driven by key factors:\n\n1. Independent Layer 1 (L1) projects seeking closer alignment with Ethereum, albeit cautiously to avoid compromising usability or losing momentum.\n\n2. Centralized projects exploring blockchain for enhanced security.\n\n3. Non-financial applications like games and social media, eyeing decentralization with a balanced approach to security based on the nature and value of activities conducted on-chain.\n\nHe emphasized that while current Ethereum L1 users might tolerate moderate rollup fees, newcomers from the non-blockchain realm are unlikely to accept any fee, especially when transitioning from a no-fee environment.\n\nButerin dissected the trade-offs among Rollups, Validiums, and Disconnected Systems, particularly focusing on the security and scalability aspects. The core question revolves around the assurance level of moving an asset from L1 to L2 and back to L1. He presented a comparative chart to explain the technology properties, security guarantees, and costs associated with each system type.\n\nHe also presented a spectrum of intermediate solutions like a validating bridge and discussed the cost of Ethereum's native data availability versus an application's needs, which would ultimately influence the choice between different L2 solutions.\n\nAn interesting concept introduced is \"pre-confirmations,\" providing a form of partial guarantee by attesting to the order and post-state root of transactions. This could be beneficial for low-value, high-frequency applications, offering a lower-security, low-latency solution within the same ecosystem accommodating high-security, high-latency applications.\n\nButerin highlighted the importance of a system's ability to trustlessly read the Ethereum blockchain, and the security implications it entails. He proposed two solutions: ensuring the top chain reads only finalized blocks of Ethereum or allowing the top chain to revert if Ethereum reverts.\n\nHe further delved into the concept of transforming a separate chain into a Validium through a two-way validating bridge. However, he pointed out that several edge cases, like handling 51% attacks or hard fork upgrades on Ethereum, require a social commitment to address exceptional scenarios.\n\nIn conclusion, Buterin explored two key dimensions of connectedness to Ethereum: the security of withdrawing to Ethereum and the security of reading Ethereum. He acknowledged the value of projects across different regions of this design space, advocating for a potential transition from looser to tighter couplings with Ethereum as technology evolves over time.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Ethereum price is still struggling to clear the $1,850 resistance against the US dollar. ETH might rally again if it clears $1,820 and $1,850.\n\nEthereum is still facing a key barrier near the $1,850 zone.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,785 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a major rising channel forming with support near $1,800 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could extend its increase if it clears the $1,820 resistance.\n\nEthereum Price Remains Supported\n\nEthereum started a slow and steady increase from the $1,740 zone. ETH was able to reclaim the $1,800 resistance zone and avoided a major downside correction, like Bitcoin.\n\nThe bulls even pushed the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downside correction from the $1,865 swing high to the $1,740 low. Moreover, there is a major rising channel forming with support near $1,800 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $1,785 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $1,820 level. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downside correction from the $1,865 swing high to the $1,740 low.\n\nIf ETH surpasses the $1,820 resistance, it could rise toward the key barrier at $1,850. A close above the $1,850 resistance could start a fresh rally. In the stated case, the price could rally toward $1,950.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next key resistance is near $2,000, above which the price could accelerate higher. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $2,120 level. The main hurdle sits at $2,250.\n\nBearish Wave in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,820 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,800 level, the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, and the trend line.\n\nThe next key support is $1,770. The main support is now forming near the $1,750 and $1,740 levels. A downside break below the $1,740 support might spark a bearish wave. In the stated case, Ether could drop toward the $1,650 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,740\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,820\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum futures premium hits 1-year high \u2014 Will ETH price follow? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) price has declined by 14.7% since its peak at $2,120 on April 16, 2023. However, two derivatives metrics indicate that investors have not felt this bullish in over a year. This discrepancy warrants an investigation into whether the recent optimism is a broader response to Bitcoin (BTC) breaking above $34,000 on Oct. 24.\n\nOne possible reason for the surge in enthusiasm among investors using ETH derivatives is the overall market's excitement regarding the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. According to analysts from Bloomberg, the ongoing amendments to the spot Bitcoin ETF proposals can be seen as a \u201cgood sign\u201d of progress and impending approvals. This development is expected to drive the entire cryptocurrency market to higher price levels.\n\nInterestingly, comments issued by the U.S. SEC Chair Gery Gensler's in 2019 reveal his perspective. During the 2019 MIT Bitcoin Expo, Gensler termed the SEC's position at the time as \"inconsistent\" because they had denied multiple spot Bitcoin ETF applications, while futures-based ETF products that do not involve physical Bitcoin had been in existence since December 2017.\n\nAnother potential factor in the optimism of Ethereum investors using derivatives may be the pricing of the Dencun upgrade scheduled for the first half of 2024. This upgrade is set to enhance data availability for layer-2 rollups, ultimately leading to reduced transaction costs. Moreover, the upgrade will prepare the network for the future implementation of sharding (parallel processing) as part of the blockchain's \"Surge\" roadmap.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin highlighted in his Oct. 31 statement that independent layer-1 projects are gradually migrating and potentially integrating as Ethereum ecosystem layer-2 solutions. Buterin also noted that the current costs associated with rollup fees are not acceptable for most users, particularly for non-financial applications.\n\nChallenges for Ethereum competitors\n\nEthereum competitors are facing challenges as software developers realize the associated costs of maintaining a complete record of a network's transactions. For instance, SnowTrace, a popular blockchain explorer tool for Avalanche (AVAX), announced its shutdown supposedly due to the high costs.\n\nPhillip Liu Jr., head of strategy and operations at Ava Labs, pointed out the difficulties users face in self-validating and storing data on single-layer chains. Consequently, the substantial processing capacity required often leads to unexpected issues.\n\nFor example, on October 18, the Theta Network team encountered a \"edge case bug\" after a node upgrade, causing blocks on the main chain to halt production for several hours. Similarly, layer-1 blockchain Aptos Network (APT) experienced a five-hour outage on October 19, resulting in a halt in exchanges' deposits and withdrawals.\n\nIn essence, the Ethereum network may not currently offer a solution to its high fees and processing capacity bottlenecks. Still, it does have an eight-year track record of continuous upgrades and improvements toward that goal with few major disruptions.\n\nAssessing bullish sentiment in ETH derivatives markets\n\nAfter evaluating the fundamental factors surrounding the Ethereum network, it's essential to investigate the bullish sentiment among ETH traders in the derivatives markets, despite the negative performance of ETH, which has dropped 14.7% since its $2,120 peak in April.\n\nThe Ether futures premium, which measures the difference between two-month contracts and the spot price, has reached its highest level in over a year. In a healthy market, the annualized premium, or basis rate, should typically fall within the range of 5% to 10%.\n\nEther 1-month futures basis rate. Source: Laevitas.ch\n\nSuch data is indicative of the growing demand for leveraged ETH long positions, as the futures contract premium surged from 1% on Oct. 23 to 7.4% on Oct. 30, surpassing the neutral-to-bullish threshold of 5%. This surge in the metric follows a 15.7% rally in ETH's price over two weeks.\n\nAnalyzing the options markets provides further insight. The 25% delta skew in Ether options is a useful indicator of when arbitrage desks and market makers overcharge for upside or downside protection. When traders anticipate a drop in Ether's price, the skew metric rises above 7%. Conversely, phases of excitement tend to exhibit a negative 7% skew.\n\nRelated: 3 reasons why Ethereum price is down against Bitcoin\n\nEther 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas.ch\n\nNotice how the Ether options 25% delta skew reached a negative 16% level on Oct. 27, the lowest in over 12 months. During this period, protective put (sell) options were trading at a discount, a characteristic of excessive optimism. Moreover, the current 8% discount for put options is a complete turnaround from the 7% or higher positive skew that persisted until Oct. 18.\n\nIn summary, the drivers behind the bullish sentiment among Ether investors in derivatives markets remain somewhat elusive. Traders may be expecting approval for Ether spot ETF instruments following Bitcoin's potential approval, or they may be banking on planned upgrades that aim to reduce transaction costs and eliminate the competitive advantage of other blockchain networks like Solana (SOL) and Tron (TRX).\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

This move is anticipated to yield up to 7% return in staking rewards and is expected to help the bankrupt firm maximize its assets.\n\n$156M transferred\n\nNansen, while adding FTX\u2019s recently unstaked Solana assets to the stream of transactions from the insolvent company to crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, estimated a movement of approximately $156 million worth of digital assets.\n\nAccording to Nansen\u2019s analysis, the new wave of transactions included 1,100 ETH valued at $2 million, 10.5 million USDC, and 7.6 million Render tokens worth $500,000.\n\nFTX also transferred 833,000 Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) tokens, equivalent to $616,000, and 108 million TRUE tokens worth $420,000. Further assets included 138,000 Band Protocol tokens valued at $221,000, 2.5 million The Graph tokens equivalent to $273,000, 845 Maker tokens valued at $1.17 million, and 9.5 million REN tokens worth $500,000.\n\nAdditionally, there were 695,000 Perpetual Protocol Tokens valued at $423,000, 767,000 Biconomy Tokens worth $182,000, and 23,000 Polygon tokens worth $15,000.\n\nFTX claims value rise\n\nPrices for FTX claims increased following reports of a $2 billion investment by Google in the artificial intelligence startup Anthropic.\n\nIkigai hedge fund manager Travis Kling posited that the investment had driven \u201cFTX bankruptcy pretty close to a full recovery.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with CryptoSlate, Thomas Braziel, an expert on FTX claims at 117 Partners, urged creditors to remain cautious. This was reiterated in a post on X (formerly Twitter), where he highlighted that there was no valuation mentioned in the Google-Anthropic investment, adding that:\n\n\u201cGreat to see this news tonight but the bankruptcy still have a big road ahead of it.\u201d\n\nData from Cherokee Acquisition shows that the claim\u2019s value has risen to between 50 and 53 cents on the dollar as of press time."

        "content": "The Ethereum layer-2 ecosystem is likely to continue evolving with diverse technological approaches, according to co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nThe co-founder of the smart contract blockchain unpacked the current landscape of Ethereum\u2019s scaling ecosystem on his personal blog, with several layer-2 protocols differing in their approaches to bring greater scaling capacity, lower costs and increased security.\n\nAs Buterin highlighted, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) rollups pioneered by Arbitrum, Optimism, Scroll and more recently, Kakarot and Taiko, have drastically improved the respective security of their solutions.\n\nDifferent types of layer 2shttps://t.co/ry4VTtWhJ1 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) October 31, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, \u201csidechain projects\u201d like Polygon have also developed their own rollup solutions. Buterin also highlights \u201calmost-EVMs\u201d like zkSync, extensions like Arbitrum Stylus and zero-knowledge proof pioneers Starknet as important players driving scaling technology for the ecosystem:\n\n\u201cOne of the inevitable consequences of this is that we are seeing a trend of layer 2 projects becoming more heterogeneous. I expect this trend to continue, for a few key reasons.\u201d\n\nButerin notes that some projects currently existing as independent layer 1s are looking to bring themselves closer to the Ethereum ecosystem and potentially become ecosystem layer 2s.\n\nRelated: Polygon\u2019s \u2018holy grail\u2019 Ethereum-scaling zkEVM beta hits mainnet\n\nThis type of transition remains difficult, as an \u201call at once\u201d approach would cause a decrease in usability given that technology is not at a stage where it can be completely included in rollup technology. Meanwhile, postponing such a transition runs the risk of \u201csacrificing momentum and being too late to be meaningful.\u201d\n\nButerin also notes that some centralized, non-Ethereum projects want to give users greater security assurances and are looking to blockchain-based solutions. Historically, these types of projects would have looked to \u201cpermissioned consortium chains\u201d to achieve this:\n\n\u201cRealistically, they probably only need a \u201chalfway-house\u201d level of decentralization. Additionally, their often very high level of throughput makes them unsuitable even for rollups, at least in the short term.\u201d\n\nLastly, Buterin considers non-financial applications like games and social media platforms that want to be decentralized but do not need high levels of security. Highlighting a social media use case, Buterin notes that different parts of the app would require separate functionality:\n\n\u201cRare and high-value activity like username registration and account recovery should be done on a rollup, but frequent and low-value activity like posts and votes need less security.\u201c\n\nHe adds that a chain failure leading to a user\u2019s post disappearing would be an \u201cacceptable cost,\u201d while a similar failure leading to the loss of an account would be far more serious.\n\nRelated: Vitalik Buterin voices concerns over DAOs approving ETH staking pool operators\n\nButerin also notes that the costs associated with paying for rollup fees might not be acceptable for non-blockchain users, while previous blockchain users are used to paying far higher prices for on-chain interactions.\n\nAn excerpt from Buterin\u2019s latest blog post on the Ethereum ecosystem titled \u201cDifferent types of layer 2s.\u201d Source: vitalik.eth.limo\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder then delves into the trade-offs between different rollup solutions and systems that offer varying scaling capabilities to the ecosystem. The \u201cconnectedness\u201d to Ethereum hinges on the security of withdrawing to Ethereum from layer 2s and the security of reading data from the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nRelated: Ethereum\u2019s proto-danksharding to make rollups 10x cheaper \u2014 Consensys zkEVM Linea head\n\nButerin notes that high security and tight connectedness are important for some applications, while others require something looser in exchange for greater scalability:\n\n\u201cIn many cases, starting with something looser today, and moving to a tighter coupling over the next decade as technology improves, may well be optimal.\u201d\n\nEthereum\u2019s next scheduled hard fork is set to introduce EIP-4844, commonly referred to as \u201cproto-dank sharding.\u201d The EIP is expected to drastically increase the amount of data availability of the network. Buterin also notes that improvements in data compression enable greater functionality.\n\nMagazine: Ethereum restaking: Blockchain innovation or dangerous house of cards?"

        "content": "Ethereum core developers have included EIP-7514 in the upcoming Dencun upgrade. This proposal slows the growing ETH staking while allowing developers to explore long-term solutions for unchecked staking.\n\nEIP-7514 is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal co-authored by Tim Beiko and Dapplion that is meant to slow down the rate of Ether (ETH) staking.\n\nThe proposal is part of Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade slated for activation in October 2023, and it is essentially an attempt to buy the community time to come up with a more practical reward scheme for stakers on the network.\n\nNext up, we continued a conversation from last week's ACDC call, about whether to add a constant cap to the validator activation queue. The proposal had since then been formalized as EIP-7514: https://t.co/sd4D4GlMRY \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) September 14, 2023\n\nAccording to some Ethereum developers, if the pace of staking remains unchecked, it will be possible to witness half of all ETH staked by May 2024, which could escalate to three-quarters by September 2024 and potentially hit 100% by December 2024.\n\nThe Beacon chain is growing exponentially\n\n\n\nWe all like up-only, but not when the safety of Ethereum is at stake. By doing nothing, next year we will enter unknown economic territory with >50% of total ETH stake\n\n\n\nToday ACD will vote to bound max growth to buy research time pic.twitter.com/iA7T6BHjak \u2014 Lion \u27e0 dapplion .eth (@dapplion) September 14, 2023\n\nWhile at first glance, this might appear positive, it could apply undue pressure on the network and render the rewards for staking less attractive.\n\nEIP-7514 is meant to bring changes to the way new validators, those responsible for processing transactions and creating blocks, can join the network.\n\nIt is a temporary fix to manage the increasing number of validators while also allowing developers to look for more permanent solutions. These future solutions could lead to big changes in Ethereum\u2019s economic rulebook, potentially sparking a new age of staking in the system.\n\nSo, how did it get to the point where a squeeze on ETH staking became necessary? And more importantly, what are the possible future ramifications of EIP-7514 on the price of ETH? Read on to find out more.\n\nThe Merge and the staking surge\n\nIn 2022, the Ethereum network successfully executed a large-scale software upgrade, commonly referred to as the \u201cMerge,\u201d that moved it from the energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to the more sustainable proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism.\n\nFor those not in the know, a consensus mechanism is a protocol used in a blockchain network to ensure all computers or nodes making up the network agree on a single data set. It serves as the standard for verifying and approving each transaction on the blockchain.\n\nThe Ethereum upgrade involved merging the original Ethereum mainnet with a separate PoS blockchain called the Beacon Chain, allowing the network to transition from a mining-based PoW blockchain to a staking-based PoS model.\n\nStaking is when users lock up their ETH tokens as a way of validating transactions on the network. In return, these validators are rewarded with more ETH tokens.\n\nThis feature is central to Ethereum because it provides the mechanism for achieving consensus in the network. It encourages security by ensuring validators have a vested interest in the network, particularly since they risk losing their staked ETH if they try to cheat the system.\n\nTo become a validator requires staking a minimum of 32 ETH, which is worth approximately $52,000 at current rates.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum goes red as active addresses, deposits spike\n\nStaked ETH withdrawal and the rise of liquid staking\n\nThe introduction of staking was met with soaring demand, sparking concerns regarding the potential for the Ethereum network to become overly congested.\n\nDriving this fervor for staking was EIP-4895, introduced as part of the April 2023 Shanghai upgrade, which allowed validators to withdraw staked ETH and staking rewards.\n\nAccording to Dankrad Feist, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, while the implementation of EIP-4895 was anticipated to grow Ethereum\u2019s validator network, the widespread impact of liquid staking was not fully realized at the time.\n\nLiquid staking is a solution that allows users to stake their ETH directly on Ethereum in exchange for an ERC-20 liquid staking token (LST) that represents their staked ETH. It enables the staked ETH to remain liquid or movable rather than locked on the blockchain.\n\nThe three biggest liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) on the Ethereum mainnet are stETH by Lido, rETH by RocketPool, and SETH2 by Stakewise. They allow users to stake and unstake any amount of ETH without waiting for a specific unlock period.\n\nIn Feist\u2019s opinion, the unwillingness of staking pools to self-regulate, especially those holding a dominant position in the liquid staking arena, could potentially jeopardize Ethereum\u2019s decentralization.\n\nThe researcher suggested a governance attack on a major staking protocol might pose significant challenges for Ethereum.\n\nMy reasoning on why I'm for EIP-7514. It is currently unclear if (especially liquid) staking will keep growing indefinitely. In the case that the withdrawal queue does not empty over the next few months, the lower churn limit will give the Ethereum community the time needed to\u2026 \u2014 Dankrad Feist (@dankrad) September 14, 2023\n\nETH developers foresee exponential growth in validator sets\n\nIn the PoS version of Ethereum, validators are randomly chosen to confirm transactions and create a set of consecutive blocks called an epoch.\n\nAn epoch is important as it helps in the management of the blockchain, ensuring not all validators are active at the same time, which would be inefficient and unnecessary. Each epoch lasts about 6.4 minutes and is made up of 32 slots, with each slot allocated 12 seconds.\n\nAt each slot, the system allows a validator to propose a block, even though not all slots may contain a block.\n\nAs mentioned previously, validators earn their status by staking ETH, and the potential for profit has seen more and more users joining as validators and increasingly staking higher amounts of ETH.\n\nHowever, this rapid growth in validators has raised a couple of issues. First, it could burden Ethereum\u2019s peer-to-peer (P2P) networking infrastructure, increasing the chances that nodes making up the network may fail due to higher computational and bandwidth demands caused by increased \u201cgossip messages\u201d among validators.\n\nSecondly, the expanding number of validators could complicate Ethereum\u2019s attempts to achieve single-slot finality, the quest to make a transaction final and irreversible in just one slot.\n\nThere are currently more than 795,000 active validators. With the next upgrade following Dencun not anticipated until May 2024 at the earliest, Dankrad Feist fears there may be more than 2 million validators by then.\n\nMoreover, he believes that the Ethereum community will find itself in uncharted waters if the combined LST market cap surpasses that of unstaked ETH.\n\n\u201cThis technical problem is exacerbated by an economical one: liquid staking tokens exceeding the remaining (unstaked) Ether market cap brings us in an untested economic regime. A point of no return might be reached when incentives lead to them having similar liquidity and utility in DeFi \u2013 even a staking yield close to 0% (but still positive) might be enough to keep the LST attractive\u201d Dankrad Feist, Ethereum Foundation researcher\n\nAt present, approximately 25.8 million ETH, representing 21% of all ETH in circulation and equivalent to a staggering $41.8 billion, has been staked, per data from beaconcha.in.\n\nAccording to projections by Ethereum developers Tim Beiko and Dapplion, should the current momentum persist, the percentage of staked ETH in relation to total ETH supply could mushroom to 50% by May 2024 and escalate to 100% by the end of that year.\n\nProjected validator set | Source: ethereum.org\n\nIf Beiko and Dapplion\u2019s projections were to hold true, the Ethereum network might find itself devoid of ETH, meaning that users will have no way to pay for transactions on the network.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum unveils new testnet called \u2018Hole\u0161ky\u2019\n\nThe EIP-7514 solution\n\nEIP-7514 doesn\u2019t directly address the potential technical and economic problems emanating from the unprecedented growth of ETH staking. Instead, it seeks to buy the Ethereum community a bit of time to find lasting solutions for them.\n\nIt essentially puts the brakes on the growth of staked ETH by restricting the churn limit, which is the number of validators that can enter or exit the network during an epoch.\n\nUsually, Ethereum\u2019s churn limit is dynamic, determined by calculations based on the total number of active validators divided by 65,536. As of Sept. 11, 2023, the upper churn limit was 12 per epoch, with the next determination set for Oct. 4.\n\nYesterday, the churn limit increased from 11 to 12. Next churn limit increase projected to occur around October 4!\n\n\n\nH/t: @dapplion pic.twitter.com/ftwhRxbGFE \u2014 Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) September 11, 2023\n\nBeiko and Dapplion\u2019s proposal seeks to do away with the dynamic calculations and instead establish a fixed maximum churn limit of 8 per epoch.\n\nIn so doing, EIP-7514 could theoretically extend the time it would take for staked ETH to reach 50% of total ETH supply by at least one year and as many as four years for it to get to 100%, therefore giving the community enough time to find lasting solutions for the imperfections in the validator reward system.\n\nThis proposed cap will not interfere with the churn limit that controls validator exits. That limit will keep adjusting dynamically, maintaining a balance with the expansion of the validator set.\n\nThe goal is to prevent a scenario where the staking withdrawal queue is constantly full, therefore complicating the efficient administration of validator rewards.\n\nWhile the proposal has largely been positively received, some sections of the Ethereum community have been critical of its rushed nature and have suggested it could compromise Ethereum\u2019s neutrality.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ryanberckmans/status/1702336972700942366\n\nPotential EIP-7514 impact on ETH price\n\nThe immediate impact of EIP-7514 on the price of ETH is unclear at this point, but some market watchers think it could have a noteworthy long-term effect.\n\nThe proposal is intended to slow down the rate of ETH staking, which, in turn, could potentially influence the coin\u2019s supply-demand dynamics.\n\nIf successfully executed, EIP-7514 could significantly reduce the amount of ETH being staked, therefore alleviating the potential pressure on the Ethereum network and making staking rewards more attractive.\n\nSome analysts believe the enhanced attractiveness of staking rewards and the reduced supply of ETH in the market could potentially increase its price.\n\nHowever, the proposal is only a temporary fix for managing an increased number of validators, and the Ethereum community will still have to find a more permanent solution. As such, the long-term effects of EIP-7514 on the price of ETH may be speculative at best, depending on what these future solutions could be.\n\nIf they result in a more efficient and secure network, it can potentially boost Ethereum\u2019s overall value, resulting in a price increase for ETH. Conversely, if these changes are not well-received or cause network instability, it could put downward pressure on the ETH price.\n\nRead more: Ethereum exchange deposits surge while staked ETH hits ATH\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

First, the firm has pointed out how the trading volume of the cryptocurrency has gone down since Ethereum\u2019s surge from a few days back.\n\nThe value of the metric has been sharply going down recently | Source: Santiment\n\nThe trading volume observing a significant decline while the price is trying to continue its rally could indicate that momentum is weakening for the cryptocurrency.\n\nOne positive for the asset, though, could be the fact that the supply on exchanges has gone down since the rally started, implying that the investors have made net withdrawals.\n\nLooks like the metric has plunged | Source: Santiment\n\nGenerally, investors transfer their Ethereum out of these central entities to hold onto it in self-custodial wallets for extended periods, so this decline in the supply on exchanges could be a sign of fresh accumulation.\n\nFollowing the latest rise in the asset, its social dominance has also seen a jump. The \u201csocial dominance\u201d here refers to the mindshare that Ethereum occupies on social media platforms among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap.\n\nInterest around ETH has grown in the last few days | Source: Santiment\n\nIt would appear that more eyes have been turning at Ethereum recently, which can be a sign that hype is building up among the traders. Historically, too much hype has been negative for the asset, as it has often led to top formations.\n\nSo far, though, the social dominance is still notably below the levels it was at when ETH hit its local top at the start of this month, as is apparent in the above chart. According to Santiment, this \u201cmay suggest there can be some room for it to go before things cool down.\u201d\n\nA signal that is more concretely bearish for Ethereum, however, is the 30-day MVRV ratio. In simple terms, what this ratio tells us is how the value that investors are holding (the market cap) compares against the capital that they invested into the asset (the realized cap).\n\nThe indicator appears to have entered the danger zone | Source: Santiment\n\nHere, Santiment has used the 30-day MVRV ratio, which means this indicator only keeps track of the investors/addresses who bought their coins within the last 30 days.\n\nAs shown in the chart, this Ethereum indicator has recently risen into a territory that the analytics firm labels as a \u201cdanger zone.\u201d Historically, the price has seen a correction not too long after the metric has reached this zone so another local top may be due for Ethereum right now.\n\nETH Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $1,800, up 1% in the past week.\n\nETH has been stuck in consolidation recently | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Semiconductor companies NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), known for their graphics processing units (GPUs), saw their stock prices benefiting from the boom in cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat Happened: These GPUs, originally designed for high-end video game graphics, have now become essential for computationally intensive applications such as data centers, artificial intelligence, and the creation of crypto assets.\n\nCryptography and blockchain creation require substantial computational power, making GPUs an ideal choice for these tasks. In 2018, as cryptocurrency prices soared, miners rushed to purchase GPUs, driving up the stock prices of Nvidia and AMD. GPUs played a vital role in the creation and management of crypto assets, to the extent that Nvidia even introduced a dedicated lineup of chips specifically for crypto mining in early 2021.\n\nThe Merge and Proof-of-Stake Approach\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation on September 15, 2022, completed \u201cThe Merge\u201d process, which means Ethereum was switched from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to Proof-of-Stake (PoW).\n\nWith this development, the validation of new transaction blocks no longer relies on hardware mining, making the millions of high-end graphics cards previously used for this purpose redundant. Consequently, a large number of these GPUs were expected to flood the used card market.\n\nHowever, since 2023, the AI industry experienced a remarkable upswing. With machine learning at the forefront, AI applications penetrated diverse sectors, capturing investors\u2019 attention and fueling the sector\u2019s success.\n\nAccording to PwC, the potential economic impact of AI is substantial, with an anticipated contribution of $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. This projection encompasses a $6.6 trillion boost in productivity and a staggering $9.1 trillion surge in consumption.\n\nWill The SEC Finally Approve Long-Awaited Bitcoin Spot ETF?

        "content": "Unveiling of L1 token DYDX, a pivotal step in dYdX Chain\u2019s growth.\n\nEnhanced network security and governance with the new L1 token.\n\nOpportunities for community engagement and revenue generation through staking.\n\nWhile Ethereum provides a reliable platform for thousands of blockchain projects, many eventually move to their native tokens. Most recently, the dYdX Chain has marked a significant milestone by launching a native chain and moving to an L1 token, DYDX.\n\nThe project departed from its previous ERC-20 token framework on Ethereum\u2019s layer two protocol. The project says the migration means better network governance, heightened security, and functionality, and a new revenue distribution model for validators and stakers.\n\ndYdX Chain\u2019s Transition to L1 Token, DYDX\n\nOn Wednesday, October 26, the dYdX Chain mainnet finally went live after the unveiling of its new L1 token. The first block was created by the Genesis Validators, as announced by the Operations subDAO (Ops subDAO). The move is a significant paradigm shift from its previous reliance on an ERC-20 token on Ethereum\u2019s layer two protocol.\n\nThis transition, following a community vote, expands the staking opportunities, which aims to bolster the blockchain. Moreover, the project claims that the shift amplifies the protocol\u2019s governance capabilities and reallocates the protocol\u2019s revenue streams.\n\nThrough this transition, the dYdX Chain says its framework will be more closely with the decentralized ethos of blockchain technology. The L1 token also marks a step towards a self-sustained, community-driven blockchain ecosystem. Importantly, all fees collected by the protocol, which include trading fees denominated in USDC and gas fees for DYDX-denominated transactions or USDC-denominated transactions, are distributed to Validators and Stakers, creating a direct financial benefit for network participants.\n\nWhat Is dYdX?\n\nAt its core, dYdX is a leading decentralized exchange supporting perpetual trading. It operates on smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to trade without intermediaries.\n\nThe project\u2019s features include perpetual trading on Layer-2 with up to 20x leverage, offering pairs like BTC-USD, ETH-USD, and LINK-USD, among others\u200b2\u200b. This aspect of dYdX demonstrates its commitment to providing advanced financial services in a decentralized manner.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nEthereum, where dYdX initially operated, is one of the most decentralized networks in the blockchain space.\n\ndYdX Chain might face an uphill battle to prove its chain is more decentralized than Ethereum.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe emergence of dYdX Chain and its L1 Token, dYDx, is a significant stride towards achieving a self-sustainable and community-governed blockchain ecosystem. It showcases the potential for blockchain projects to evolve and adapt to community needs while enhancing network security and governance.\n\nRead more about decentralized exchanges like dYdX:\n\nDecentralized Exchanges: Crypto\u2019s Wild West or Blockchain Essential?\n\n\n\nRead more about Solana\u2019s positive performance:\n\nUnpacking Solana\u2019s 7% Price Jump: What You Need to Know"

        "title": "What Are Smart Contracts on the Blockchain and How They Work - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is a Smart Contract?\n\nA smart contract is a self-executing program that automates the actions required in an agreement or contract. Once completed, the transactions are trackable and irreversible.\n\nSmart contracts permit trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out among disparate, anonymous parties without the need for a central authority, legal system, or external enforcement mechanism.\n\nWhile blockchain technology has come to be thought of primarily as the foundation for Bitcoin\u200b, it has evolved far beyond underpinning a virtual currency.\n\nWhat You Need to Know Smart contracts are scripts that automate the actions specific to a contract between two parties.\n\nSmart contracts do not contain legal language, terms, or agreements\u2014only code that executes actions when specified conditions are met.\n\nNick Szabo, an American computer scientist who invented a virtual currency called \"Bit Gold\" in 1998, defined smart contracts as computerized transaction protocols that execute the terms of a contract.\n\nInvestopedia / Laura Porter\n\nHistory of Smart Contracts\n\nSmart contracts were first proposed in 1994 by Nick Szabo, an American computer scientist who invented a virtual currency called \"Bit Gold\" in 1998, 10 years before Bitcoin was introduced. In fact, Szabo is often rumored to be the real Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous Bitcoin inventor, which he has denied.\n\nSzabo defined smart contracts as computerized transaction protocols that execute the terms of a contract. He wanted to extend the functionality of electronic transaction methods, such as POS (point of sale), to the digital realm.\n\nIn his paper, Szabo also proposed the execution of a contract for synthetic assets, such as derivatives and bonds. Szabo wrote, \"These new securities are formed by combining securities (such as bonds) and derivatives (options and futures) in a wide variety of ways. Very complex term structures for payments...can now be built into standardized contracts and traded with low transaction costs, due to computerized analysis of these complex term structures.\"\n\nSmart contracts do not contain the legal language or terms of a contract between two parties. They are scripts that contain if/then statements, functions, module imports, and other programming that automate the actions specified in a contract.\n\nMany of Szabo's predictions in the paper came true in ways preceding blockchain technology. For example, derivatives trading is now mostly conducted through computer networks using complex term structures.\n\nSmart Contract Uses\n\nBecause smart contracts execute agreements, they can be used for many different purposes. One of the simplest uses is ensuring transactions between two parties occur, such as the purchase and delivery of goods. For example, a manufacturer needing raw materials can set up payments using smart contracts, and the supplier can set up shipments. Then, depending on the agreement between the two businesses, the funds could be transferred automatically to the supplier upon shipment or delivery.\n\nReal estate transactions, stock and commodity trading, lending, corporate governance, supply chain, dispute resolution, and healthcare are only a few examples where smart contracts can be used.\n\nSmart Contract Pros and Cons\n\nThe primary benefit of smart contracts is similar to the benefit of blockchain technology\u2014they remove the need for third parties. Other benefits of this technology are:\n\nEfficiency : They speed up contract execution\n\n: They speed up contract execution Accuracy : There can be no human error introduced\n\n: There can be no human error introduced Immutability: The programming cannot be altered\n\nSome of the downfalls of smart contracts are:\n\nPermanent : They cannot be changed if there are mistakes\n\n: They cannot be changed if there are mistakes Human factor : They rely on the programmer to ensure the code addresses the terms of the contract\n\n: They rely on the programmer to ensure the code addresses the terms of the contract Loopholes: There may be loopholes in the coding, allowing for contracts to be executed in bad faith\n\nWhat Is an Example of a Smart Contract? The simplest example of a smart contract is a transaction between a consumer and a business, where a sale is made. The smart contract executes the customer's payment and the business's shipment or transfer of ownership.\n\nWhat Blockchain Has Smart Contracts? Ethereum has smart contract capabilities inherent to its blockchain. The Bitcoin blockchain received smart contract abilities after its Taproot upgrade, which allowed it to communicate to layers that have smart contracts enabled on their blockchains.\n\nWhat Are Smart Contracts in Simple Terms? Smart contracts are apps on a blockchain that make each side of a transaction complete its part. For example, a smart contract could initiate a fund transfer with a third party to verify that the transfer took place.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nSmart contracts are code written into a blockchain that executes the terms of an agreement or contract from outside the chain. It automates the actions that would otherwise be completed by the parties in the agreement, which removes the need for both parties to trust each other.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (\u201cICOs\u201d) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as $10 Billion Trading Volume Floods In \u2013 Are Whales Buying Again?\n\nThe Ethereum price has held still over the past 24 hours, with the altcoin struggling to rise above the $1,800 level.\n\nAt $1,803, ETH is now 2% up in a week and 14% up in a fortnight, with the market\u2019s biggest altcoin also having risen by 50% since the beginning of the year.\n\nAnd with its 24-hour trading volume remaining high at $10 billion, there\u2019s enough underlying activity to cause another rise in the coming days.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as $10 Billion Trading Volume Floods In \u2013 Are Whales Buying Again?\n\n\n\nEthereum\u2019s chart continues to look promising, in that its technical indicators lean more towards further gains than losses right now.\n\nFor instance, its 30-day average (yellow) is rising strongly towards its 200-day average (blue), a sign that more price gains will come as the shorter term indicator climbs over its longer term counterpart.\n\nETH\u2019s relative strength index (purple) is also looking good, having kept around the 70 level for over a week now.\n\nWhat this indicates is that buying pressure is still with Ethereum, which could therefore see further gains in the near term.\n\nThe coin\u2019s 24-hour trading volume supports this view, with it remaining just above $10 billion, compared to around $5 billion a week ago.\n\nThis suggests that whales remain interested in ETH, which has seen several transfers to exchanges in the past couple of days.\n\nWhile the Ethereum price has struggled to crack the $1,850 resistance level (red) in the past few days, it also looks like its support level (green) is holding up nicely, so significant falls aren\u2019t likely.\n\nIt had risen in the context of increasing positivity regarding Bitcoin ETF applications, yet its strong fundamentals also mean it should recover soon.\n\nIndeed, its total value locked in accounts for more than half of the entire crypto sector, while it has celebrated a number of high-profile adoptions this year, including PayPal and Coinbase.\n\nSuch developments bode very well for its future, while it also needs to be remembered that Ethereum has had a deflationary tendency ever since its shift to proof-of-stake last year.\n\nAs such, the Ethereum price is likely to reach $1,900 in the next few weeks, with the formal approval of Bitcoin ETFs potentially helping it reach $2,500 in the first couple of months of 2024.\n\nHigh-Potential Alternatives\n\n\n\nProbably the only downside with Ethereum is that, as a well-established token, it may not rise as aggressively as other, newer coins.\n\nTraders looking for quicker above-average profits may therefore prefer to look elsewhere, with several promising alts holding their presales right now.\n\nPossibly the most promising of these is Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), a tokenized cloud mining platform that has already raised more $2.9 million in its presale.\n\nChoosing #BitcoinMinetrix for effortless mining! \ud83d\udc8e Through cloud mining, bid farewell to worries about reselling equipment.#BTCMTX handles upgrades, enabling users to focus on their $BTC journey without the hassles of outdated hardware. \u2699\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/eT3BGAq4Wu \u2014 Bitcoinminetrix (@bitcoinminetrix) October 31, 2023\n\nThis figure suggests plenty of market confidence in Bitcoin Minetrix, which will enable users to mine Bitcoin (BTC) by staking its native token, BTCMTX.\n\nBy offering a stake-to-mine platform, Bitcoin Minetrix aims to widen access to Bitcoin mining, with the staking of BTCMTX providing users with tokenized mining credits in returns.\n\nUsers can then use these credits to buy Bitcoin hashpower, which can earn them newly minted BTC in exchange.\n\nStakers of BTCMTX will also receive new BTCMTX as well, making the token potentially very lucrative.\n\nThis perhaps explains why its presale has already done so well, with new buyers able to join the sale by going to official Bitcoin Minetrix website.\n\nEmbarking and discovering the ease of #Bitcoin cloud mining with #BitcoinMinetrix! \ud83d\ude80\u26cf\ufe0f \u2728 Perfect entry point for beginners.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Cost-effective, no equipment expenses.\n\n\ud83c\udfe0 Say goodbye to space, noise, and heat worries.\n\n\ud83d\udd01 Effortless, seamless upgrades. pic.twitter.com/PvmKeOweCY \u2014 Bitcoinminetrix (@bitcoinminetrix) October 31, 2023\n\nBTCMTX will have a capped supply of four billion tokens, with 1.4 billion going to the presale and another 10% going to community rewards.\n\nIts sale will have ten stages in total, with 1 BTCMTX currently costing $0.01130, although this will rise to $0.01190 by the final stage.\n\nAs for where the price could end up in the future, Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s originality as a platform could help it climb much higher, making its early investors a big profit.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix NowDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlockchain sleuth account on X app @OnchainDataNerd has reported that it had noticed another piece of ETH sent by Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin to the largest crypto exchange in the US \u2014 Coinbase.\n\nButerin keeps depositing ETH to Coinbase\n\nThis is not the first sale of ETH Buterin has made this year so far. He has been sending ETH not only to Coinbase but also to Bitstamp platforms. Previously, as reported by U.Today, he moved a substantial chunk of his brainchild crypto to Coinbase at the end of September this year.\n\n2 hours ago, Vitalik Buterin deposited 100 $ETH ($181K) to #coinbase at $1810. pic.twitter.com/vsEyN7sbbV \u2014 The Data Nerd (@OnchainDataNerd) November 1, 2023\n\nButerin has been selling ETH in small portions \u2014 400 ETH on Coinbase in September \u2014 and he has moved 100 ETH there now. According to the aforementioned source, Vitalik sold 100 ETH for $181,000 at the price of $1,810 per coin.\n\nIn August this year, Buterin deposited approximately 600 ETH (worth roughly $1 million) to Coinbase. On Oct. 7, he moved 1,000 ETH to the Bitstamp exchange and sold it for roughly $1.64 million. Overall, Buterin's wallet transferred 4,400 ETH to that centralized crypto exchange in September and October, per data shared by \"Smart Money\" tracker @lookonchain. This amount of ETH is the equivalent of approximately $7.23 million.\n\nZero impact on Ethereum price\n\nToday's ETH transaction to Coinbase made by Buterin and the likely sale that followed have not had any visible impact on the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum.\n\nSince Oct. 24, after experiencing a peak of 12.87% rise within 48 hours, when ETH surged to $1,848, Ethereum has lost 2.3% in total, still trading above the $1,800 price level.\n\nIn late October, the above-mentioned source reported that several new wallets made a remarkable ETH purchase on exchanges as they withdrew 47,760 ETH worth $82.97 million at that time to their cold wallets.\n\n$8,000 prediction for Ethereum\n\nAs reported by U.Today recently, global banking giant Standard Chartered stated that they expect Ethereum price to spike up to $8,000 within the next couple of years.\n\nThe grounds for making this bold prediction were the leading role of the Ethereum blockchain in the world of smart contracts, gaming, DeFi and the tokenization of traditional assets.\n\nAlso, recently, several large fund managers submitted filings to the U.S. regulatory agency, the SEC, to get permission to launch Ethereum spot ETFs. Many market players expect that should they be approved, the ETH price may skyrocket. So far, the SEC has around a dozen filings for Bitcoin spot ETFs under consideration, but Mike Novogratz, head of Galaxy Digital, expects the first BTC ETF to be approved this year."

        "content": "Blockchain analytics firm Nansen has recently revealed that wallets associated with bankrupt crypto exchange FTX have transferred approximately $156 million worth of digital assets, including Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), in a series of transactions over the past week.\n\nThe movement of these funds has raised concerns and attracted the attention of industry experts and investors. Nansen\u2019s report sheds light on the ongoing transfers and provides valuable insights into the extent of FTX\u2019s asset movements.\n\nBankrupt FTX Wallets Unstake $57 Million Worth Of SOL Tokens\n\nAccording to the Nansen report, funds from FTX wallets have continued to migrate to various exchanges since the previous update. The report specifies the following notable transactions:\n\n695,000 Perpetual Protocol (PERP) tokens worth $423,000\n\n767,000 Biconomy (BICO) tokens worth $182,000\n\n833,000 Kyber Network (KNC) tokens worth $616,000\n\n108 million TrueFI (TRU) tokens worth $420,000\n\n138,000 Band (BAND) tokens worth $221,000\n\n2.5 million Graph (GRT) tokens worth $273,000\n\n845 Maker (MKR) tokens worth $1.17 million\n\n7.16 million Render (RNDR) tokens worth $17.8 million\n\n10.5 million USD Coin (USDC)\n\n23,000 Polygon (MATIC) tokens worth $15,000\n\n9.5 million Ren (REN) tokens worth $500,000\n\n1.1 million ETH tokens worth $2 million\n\nAdditionally, the report highlights that an additional 1.6 million SOL tokens worth $57.6 million have initiated the unstaking process. While these funds have not yet left the associated wallet, their potential movement would bring the total SOL tokens moved by FTX to just under $90 million.\n\nMoreover, considering the unstaking of SOL and the new assets transferred by FTX to Coinbase and Binance, the total value of funds moved by FTX now stands at $156 million.\n\nMajor Transfers Of LINK, AAVE, And MKR Unveiled\n\nNansen\u2019s previous investigation revealed significant transfers from wallets linked to FTX and Alameda Research, FTX\u2019s trading arm.\n\nThese funds were initially withdrawn from FTX and Alameda wallets before being sent to intermediary wallets and eventually deposited into Binance and Coinbase. The report discloses the following noteworthy movements:\n\n2.2 million USD worth of Chainlink (LINK) tokens\n\n1 million USD worth of Aave (AAVE) tokens\n\n2 million USD worth of MKR tokens\n\n3.4 million USD worth of ETH tokens\n\nIn addition to these transfers, Nansen discovered that 943,000 SOL tokens, equivalent to approximately $32 million, were moved from the FTX Cold Storage wallet.\n\nOverall, the recent findings by Nansen regarding the movement of funds from wallets associated with the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX have sparked concerns within the cryptocurrency community.\n\nThe report highlights substantial transfers of various digital assets, including ETH and SOL, and provides insight into the scale of FTX\u2019s asset movements.\n\nAs of the current market conditions, FTX\u2019s native token, FTT, is trading at $1.23. Despite a false breakout on October 23, where the token briefly surpassed $1,360, it has since declined consistently.\n\nHowever, over the past 30 days, FTT has maintained a profit margin of 3.7%, signifying relative stability within this time frame.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Web3 interoperability layer deBridge has launched an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) turnkey solution that offers a subscription-based interoperability service to facilitate cross-chain movements on Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) Virtual Machines, according to a Nov. 1 statement shared with CryptoSlate.\n\nThe newly launched IaaS is designed to tackle key challenges hampering interoperability between the Ethereum and Solana ecosystems. To do this, the service is packaged as an all-in-one solution relying on some of deBridge\u2019s products.\n\nAs a result, the service will facilitate the transfer of authenticated messages via deBridge and promote high-performance cross-chain trading and value transfers using its DeSwap Liquidity Network (DLN).\n\nAlso, the IaaS would promote cross-chain asset custody with dePort, a native protocol for bridging and creating utility for assets on other blockchains.\n\nMeanwhile, deBridge also noted that IaaS will help project developers cross the hurdle of composability for their blockchains. By providing composability, deBridge hopes the product would help chains attract more users, developers, and liquidity from outside their ecosystem.\n\nOnboards Neon Labs\n\ndeBridge said it has onboarded Neon Labs, an Ethereum Virtual Machine on Solana, as its first client.\n\nThis strategic use of IaaS positions Neon for increased adoption, encompassing activities like cross-SVM contract calls from the EVM, native bridging from Solana, and the integration of cross-NFTs (cNFTs).\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that deBridge\u2019s new IaaS platform comes amid new partnerships for its DLN trade product. On Oct. 30, the interoperability layer announced that DLN has partnered with RockawayX and Fordefi to bring institutional-grade liquidity to cross-chain.\n\nAccording to DLN, the partnership will allow easy and fast movement of multi-million dollar cross-chain transfers."

        "content": "Bitcoin Price and Ethereum Prediction: Are BTC and ETH Poised for a Surge Ahead of FOMC Minutes Tomorrow?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are two of the most widely traded cryptocurrencies in the market, with both having experienced a lack of volatility over the past few days. As investors and traders eagerly await the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s (FOMC) minutes scheduled to be released tomorrow, the question on everyone\u2019s mind is whether BTC and ETH are poised for a surge.\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, has continued to rise and has gained some traction above the $25K mark. Meanwhile, the second most popular cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH), has surpassed $1,700 for the first time since September 2022.\n\nhttps://www.twitter.com/hzdcom/status/1627902479097634817?s=20\n\nBitcoin has risen 14 percent in the last seven days, indicating rapid growth. Other well-known cryptocurrencies, such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC), and Ripple (XRP), also saw marginal increases.\n\nThe total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies was $1.13 trillion, representing a 1.67 percent increase in a 24-hour period.\n\nHowever, the reason for its upward rally could be linked to improved macroeconomic conditions and investors\u2019 renewed market optimism. Furthermore, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has recommended new laws for cryptocurrency trading platforms in order to increase investor safety. This was regarded as yet another important factor influencing Bitcoin values.\n\nUS Dollar\u2019s Rally has Come to a Halt\n\nThe US dollar, which had been on an upward trend due to strong labor market statistics and persistent inflation, lost some of its momentum as traders awaited economic data to determine whether it was still justifiable to push the dollar higher. Despite having risen for three consecutive weeks, with a gain of about 1.7% in February, the US dollar index has now settled around 104, after reaching a six-week high of 104.67 on Friday.\n\n@Stablzone is incentivising the #DeFi industry because it provides a low-risk, high-yield investment opportunity. #USDT\n\n\n\nStable coins are digital assets that are pegged to a fiat currency, such as the US dollar, and are designed to maintain a stable value.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s $STABLZ Season \ud83d\udeeb pic.twitter.com/Z5pZNxxfnU \u2014 \ud835\udd4a\ud835\udd38\ud835\udd4b\ud835\udd46\ud835\udd4a\u210d\ud835\udd40 \ud835\udd44\ud835\udd38\u211d\ud835\udd42\ud835\udd3c\ud835\udd4b\ud835\udd40\u2115\ud835\udd3e (@MillionXSatoshi) February 20, 2023\n\nTherefore, the bearish US dollar has played a significant role in supporting BTC prices, since Bitcoin has a high inverse connection to the US Dollar Index (DXY).\n\nThe holiday-shortened trading week brings readings on manufacturing, the health of the consumer and US economic output. That\u2019s on top of minutes from the Fed\u2019s most recent meeting and speeches from a range of officials, including Cleveland Fed President Loretta (6/18) \u2014 Margin32 (@Margin32) February 20, 2023\n\nMoving on, the market is now waiting for the release of the minutes from the Fed\u2019s most recent meeting. However, traders are anticipating European and American manufacturing data later on Tuesday, as well as the core PCE price index on Friday, to help guide their next movements.\n\nHong Kong Proposes Crypto Platform Regulations\n\nCryptocurrency prices have received a further boost due to new licensing guidelines for crypto exchanges in Hong Kong, which are aimed at establishing the city as a hub for digital currencies. On Monday, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong issued regulations for virtual asset trading platforms and is now inviting public feedback.\n\nAccording to the announcement, all cryptocurrency trading platforms, including those that currently exist, should begin assessing and upgrading their systems and procedures to conform with the new regime. They further added that those who do not intend to apply for a license have to start making arrangements for a peaceful exit from the Hong Kong market. Stablecoin regulation will begin in Hong Kong in June of this year as well.\n\nBitcoin Price\n\nTechnical analysis shows that Bitcoin\u2018s price has been fluctuating slowly within a tight range of $23,700 and $25,200. If the BTC/USD price is able to break out above the $25,200 resistance level, it may continue rising toward the $26,000 level, which is the next significant level of resistance.\n\nHowever, the leading technical indicators, including RSI and MACD, are showing divergence. While the RSI is currently above 50 and in the buying zone, the MACD is forming histograms below 0 and in the selling zone. Investor indecision is often a result of this kind of disparity.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nIn the event that the price of Bitcoin drops below the present support level of $23,750, the 50% Fibonacci retracement mark would act as the next support level at $22,850.\n\nThe minutes from the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting are due out on Wednesday, so all eyes will be on that event in the coming week. Bitcoin\u2019s price movement may be affected by these minutes.\n\nBuy BTC Now\n\nEthereum Price\n\nThe ETH/USD pair has experienced a boost in positive momentum after establishing support near the $1,650 mark. Ethereum\u2019s price has been fluctuating within a narrow range during the past two hours, as evidenced by the formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern on the 2-hour timescale, which indicates market uncertainty.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price might hit $1,720 if the cryptocurrency has a positive rebound over the $1,650 level. Further gains for the bulls are possible if prices break out to the upside from the symmetrical triangle pattern and the $1,720 mark.\n\nEthereum Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nTo offset this decline, Ethereum has the support of around $1,650 and $1,625. Analyzing the price of Bitcoin is similar to analyzing the RSI and MACD, which are displaying divergence. The $1,760 and $1,800 price levels are expected to function as barriers in both cases.\n\nBuy ETH Now\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum Alternatives\n\nIn addition to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), there are several other altcoins in the cryptocurrency market that show significant potential. The CryptoNews Industry Talk team has conducted an analysis and created a list of the top 15 cryptocurrencies to watch in 2023.\n\nThis list is updated regularly with new altcoins and ICO projects, so it is recommended to check back frequently for the latest additions.\n\nDisclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.\n\nFind The Best Price to Buy/Sell Cryptocurrency"

        "content": "Bitcoin Price and Ethereum Prediction: Will BTC & ETH Bounce Back After 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, experienced a significant bearish correction on Friday, with Bitcoin retracing 38.2% of its recent gains. Ethereum suffered a similar decline.\n\nAs a result, many traders and investors are now questioning whether this drop is a temporary correction or the beginning of a more prolonged bearish trend.\n\nIn this analysis, we will assess the technical factors affecting BTC and ETH and make predictions about their future movements.\n\nCongratulations\uff01#BTC breaks 25,000, look for a continued price rise in the near future! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/msEGiwX2Wl \u2014 OpenBlock (@OpenBlockWallet) February 16, 2023\n\nDespite challenging inflation statistics and tighter regulation of stablecoins, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently trading at over $24,920, up more than 9% from the previous day.\n\nThe reasons behind this price surge can be attributed in part to Dubai\u2019s crypto-friendly laws, which have encouraged the growth of the sector by attracting Web3 and crypto firms, as well as established enterprises embracing innovative technologies like cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and the metaverse.\n\nThese factors suggest that the demand for cryptocurrencies continues to grow, even in the face of broader economic challenges and regulatory headwinds.\n\nBREAKING: \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddea Abu Dhabi launched $2 billion initiative to back Web3 and #Crypto startups \ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/vXccOBU91t \u2014 Keyur Rohit (@CryptoKingKeyur) February 15, 2023\n\nWhile new regulations are presenting a challenge for the cryptocurrency market, some investors are shifting their capital from altcoins to Bitcoin. This is likely due to the fact that Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that the SEC chair has classified as a commodity, providing it with a unique advantage in terms of regulatory clarity and stability.\n\nDespite these regulatory challenges, Bitcoin remains a popular choice for investors seeking exposure to the cryptocurrency market. As the market continues to evolve and new regulations are implemented, it will be interesting to see how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies respond to these changes.\n\nUnderstanding Crypto Fundamentals: Analyzing a Bullish Market\n\nDespite the US government\u2019s recent regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrencies, the market has seen a surge in prices, with many cryptocurrencies experiencing strong gains. This was particularly evident in the recent rise of Bitcoin, which unexpectedly regained its footing and sparked a broader rally in the market.\n\nWhile the US government\u2019s regulatory policies may present challenges for the market, the recent surge in prices suggests that investors remain confident in the potential of cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cThe crypto bear market is over.\u201d\n\n\n\nBro you\u2019re 16 stfu. \u2014 Michael A. Gayed, CFA (@leadlagreport) February 17, 2023\n\nThe recent upward trend in the cryptocurrency market coincides with the launch of the Bitcoin NFT Ordinals protocol and a new record for average block size.\n\nAccording to the most recent data from Blockchain.com, the average size of a Bitcoin block has surpassed 2.5 gigabytes for the first time since the introduction of the new protocol. This increase in block size suggests a rising demand for Bitcoin and highlights the growing usage of the network.\n\nWhat's going on with #Bitcoin ?\n\n\n\nDespite news of heavy #US regulatory moves and SEC crackdown, bitcoin is flirting with $25k.

This increase in network activity highlights a growing interest in the cryptocurrency, which has contributed to its recent bullish trend.\n\nMoreover, the rise in short liquidations has also played a role in driving BTC\u2019s upward price momentum. In the last 24 hours, traders have closed out approximately $85.87 million worth of short BTC positions, significantly contributing to Bitcoin\u2019s price surge.\n\nAbu Dhabi Embraces the Crypto Market: A New Era of Adoption\n\nDubai has supported the growth of the cryptocurrency industry by establishing robust regulations, which have attracted both domestic Web3 and crypto organizations, as well as traditional businesses that are now incorporating novel technologies into their operations, such as NFTs, cryptocurrencies, and the metaverse.\n\nHub71, Abu Dhabi's tech ecosystem, has started a new $2 billion initiative to back Web3 and blockchain technology startups in the region.@hub71ad pic.twitter.com/p0rWPnYFS1 \u2014 Smashi (@smashitv_en) February 15, 2023\n\nHub71, a tech company located in Abu Dhabi, has announced a new initiative to support the advancement of Web3 technologies by providing Web3 entrepreneurs with access to finance, partnerships, and programs.

This development is seen as yet another crucial factor that has positively impacted the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nBitcoin Price\n\nAs of today, the live Bitcoin price stands at $23,700 with a 24-hour trading volume of $38 billion. Over the last 24 hours, Bitcoin has experienced a 4% decline. It currently holds the top ranking on CoinMarketCap, with a live market cap of $457 billion.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Bitcoin has been unsuccessful in surpassing the $25,300 level and has experienced a sharp decline to reach the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $23,700.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nIf the price continues to fall below the $23,700 level, it may indicate a bearish breakout and expose Bitcoin to the next support area at the $23,300 mark, which is supported by the 50% Fibonacci retracement level.\n\nBuy BTC Now\n\nEthereum Price\n\nAs of today, the live Ethereum price is $1,660, and the 24-hour trading volume is $11 billion. Ethereum has decreased by over 2% in the last 24 hours. It currently holds the second position in CoinMarketCap\u2019s rankings, with a live market cap of $202 billion.\n\nCurrently, the ETH/USD pair is experiencing a consolidation phase within a narrow trading range of $1,635 to $1,675, after failing to surpass the $1,740 resistance level.\n\nOn the lower side, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level is providing support at the $1,640 level. However, a break below this level could push the ETH price even lower toward the $1,600 or $1,530 level.\n\nEthereum Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nConversely, a bullish breakout of the $1,675 level may expose the ETH price to the $1,740 level. The 50-day moving average and MACD indicators also indicate a buying trend, so we should only consider buying trades above the $1,630 mark.\n\nBuy ETH Now\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum Alternatives\n\nIn addition to BTC and ETH, there are several other altcoins in the market with high potential.

        "content": "Prominent cryptocurrency analyst Dmitry Noskov from the European-based trading platform StormGain has recently shed light on his predictions concerning Ethereum (ETH) and has revealed where the digital asset ought to be by the end of the year.\n\nDmitry Noskov On Ethereum (ETH) Price Movement\n\nThe crypto analyst predictions were fueled by the current growth of the cryptocurrency market due to the forthcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024. He highlighted that the market growth will continue to grow till the end of the year, and Ethereum is set to grow with it.\n\n\u201cWe can say that the cryptocurrency market is now on a wave of growth, which may continue until the end of the year. The target for Ethereum before the new year may be $1800-$1900. It can also break the psychological level of $2,000,\u201d Noskov stated.\n\nDmitry\u2019s recent ETH predictions can also be traced back to the excitement and propaganda from the cryptocurrency community and the positive development encompassing a potential approval of Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\n\u201cThe positive developments around the potential approval of a Bitcoin (BTC) spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) have boosted other cryptocurrencies, including ETH,\u201d Noskov stated.\n\nDmitry Noskov is not the only one who has shared projections on the price of Ethereum by the end of the year. Several other analysts have also shed light on their optimism about how Ethereum is expected to finish the year.\n\nIn July, finance platform Finder sought 32 fintech and cryptocurrency analysts for them to offer their year-end price predictions for Ethereum. From the details shared with Finbold, the experts believe that the digital asset will finish the year at $2,451, presenting over 30% price surge from the current price of Ethereum.\n\nThe future predictions for Ethereum were much more promising. Specifically, the experts predict that ETH will reach $5,845 by the end of 2025.\n\nOne of the finance experts Mitesh Shah, Chief Executive Officer and founder of Omnia gave his end-of-year predictions for Ethereum, which appeared to be in check with the panel\u2019s consensus projections. Shah also believes that the digital asset is the exceptional second choice of investment for institutional and ordinary investors alike.\n\n\u201cEthereum remains the standout second choice investment for both the retail and institutional investors alike. Following the successful upgrade to proof of stake, akin to \u201cchanging a jet plane engine, mid-flight,\u201d ETH has become more efficient and deflationary, to mention a few,\u201d Shah stated.\n\nLately, the cryptocurrency has garnered momentum, slowly heading toward the $1850 resistance level. The digital asset is set to go higher if it crosses the $1850 resistance level. Ethereum is currently sitting at approximately $1797 as of the time of writing.\n\nFeatured image from Seeklogo, chart by Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "For nearly two weeks, the Ethereum price recovery has witnessed intense supply pressure around the $1830 mark. The multiple higher price rejection candles in the daily chart at this barrier reflect the sellers are aggressively defending the higher ground. However, despite the overhead supply pressure, the buyers preventing the asset from falling below the $1,750 mark indicate the bullish momentum is not completely exhausted.\n\nAlso Read: Solana Vs Ethereum: A Deep-Dive Analysis of Two Popular Coins\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH Price Analysis: Dual Resistance Threatens for New Correction\n\nThe flag pattern governs the current correction trend in the Ethereum coin.\n\nA bullish breakout from the overhead trendline could set a rally beyond $2000\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $6.7 Billion, indicating a 5.9% loss.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nThe Ethereum price recovery faces a formidable hurdle at the $1,850 level, coinciding with the upper trendline of a bullish flag pattern. Amid the prevailing uncertainty emanating from the Bitcoin price consolidation, the ETH price has been trading sideways for over a week.\n\nAlthough sellers have attempted to take advantage in this market flux, the buyers have been steadfast in maintaining a floor at $1,750. Consequently, the coin price oscillates between this support level and the overhead trendline.\n\nA decisive breakout or breakdown from this range will offer a clearer outlook for near-term price action. Should the market supply pressure intensify, a drop below the $1,750 level could instigate a significant correction, maintaining the asset within its current flag pattern.\n\nIn such a scenario, the Ethereum coin could potentially slide toward its lower trendline, currently situated below the $1,500 mark.\n\nIs ETH Price Heading to $3000?\n\nWhile the current market sentiments remain uncertain, the ETH price is strictly following the flag pattern formation, evidenced by the multiple rebounds within its trendline. In theory, this pattern is a bullish continuation pattern, and therefore it should bolster buyers to break above the overhead trend line. A potential breakout with a daily candle closing would accelerate the buying momentum and could surge the altcoin to a potential target of $2,292 followed by a $3,000 mark\n\nVortex Indicator : The considerable gap between the VI+ and VI- slopes in a bullish crossover state confirms the recovery trend remains robust.\n\nExponential Moving Average: An impending bullish crossover between the 20-day and 200-day EMA slopes could further intensify buying interest in this asset."

The co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik is known for his transfers to several cryptocurrency exchanges and once again came into light.\n\nOn November 1, Vitalik\u2019s Ethereum transfers to Coinbase were worth around $181,000.\n\nadvertisement\n\nCrypto Community Cryptic About ETH Transfer:\n\nThe move has been taken as a suspicion of something coming up, as Vitalik had previously stated that he had not sold ETH for personal benefit since 2018.\n\nSpeculative about the transaction, a few crypto analysts said that it could be for personal reasons or to fund another project. However, the main reason or truth behind this cryptic transfer of 100 ETH worth $181,000 to Coinbase remains unclear.\n\nFurthermore, it is also not sure if Vitalik will continue to sell his holdings or if this is a one-time event.\n\nRead Also: XRP and Solana Continue to Rally Defying Crypto Market Consolidation\n\nVitalik Clarifies, Says Did Not Sell ETH for Personal Gains:\n\nIn a tweet shared on X, formerly known as Twitter, Vitalik Buterin said, he has not made any transaction with the purpose of business or personal benefits since 2018.\n\nHowever, he further clarified that the move of transferring ETH coins in the past few years is for charity and donations. Vitalik further informed that if there is any information with titles like \u201cVitalik sends XXX ETH to [exchange]\u201d, it\u2019s not for selling, but always donating to some charity or nonprofit or other projects. Whereas the receiver will eventually make money by selling the ETHs because they have to cover expenses.\n\nMeanwhile, overall, since September 17, 2023, Vitalik Buterin has deposited 3,700 ETH, worth around $6.12M to Bitstamp, Paxos, and Coinbase.\n\nThe Ethereum price traded at $1,804.02, noting a surge of 0.62% over the past 24 hours, while its volume from yesterday fell 13.47% to $6.65 billion.

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum prices are close to key psychological levels, $34,400 and $1,800, ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate decision.\n\nCryptocurrencies in the top 10 by market capitalization noted an increase in their prices in the week leading up to the Fed\u2019s decision.\n\nTraders foresee a 98.2% probability that the US Federal Reserve will leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday.\n\nBitcoin price rallied throughout October 2023, marking another profitable month for BTC holders. The upcoming US Federal Reserve interest rate decision has the potential to make or break Bitcoin\u2019s price rally.\n\nAltcoins like Ethereum will probably follow Bitcoin\u2019s coattails. A vast majority of market participants expect the interest rate to remain unchanged and a small percentage anticipate a rate cut by the US central bank.\n\nAlso read: Federal Reserve Preview: Powell set to lift US Dollar by leaving door open to more hikes\n\nUS Fed interest rate preview: Two scenarios for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices\n\nScenario 1: US Fed leaves rates unchanged\n\nAccording to the CME Fed Watch Tool, there is a 98% probability that the US Ccentral bank will leave interest rates unchanged on November 1. In September 2023, Bitcoin price noted no stark movements as the Fed left interest rates unchanged. A similar outcome is expected, in response to the Federal Reserve\u2019s November 1 decision.\n\nCME Fed Watch tool and expectation of interest rate hike\n\nBitcoin price could witness short-term volatility, with BTC hovering close to the $34,400 level. BTC is likely to momentarily retrace its weekly gains of 4.33%, a recovery in the asset\u2019s price could follow soon after.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rally is largely driven by the anticipation of a spot BTC ETF approval by the US financial regulator Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC\u2019s decision could therefore influence BTC price directly, as opposed to unchanged interest rates.\n\nScenario 2: US Fed cuts interest rates\n\nMarket participants believe that there is a 1.8% probability of an interest rate cut. In the event of a rate cut, risk assets like Bitcoin and altcoins are expected to rally. Typically, a rate cut makes it cheaper to borrow funds and engage in leveraging risk assets like Bitcoin for gains. An increase in demand and inflow of funds to the asset likely drive prices higher.\n\nIt is important to note that the interest rate cut is highly unlikely. Investors are focused on Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s speech to identify whether more interest rate hikes are on the horizon.\n\nExpert analysis on likelihood of further rate hikes\n\nYohay Elam, lead analyst at FXStreet analyzed the Fed\u2019s interest rate decision and the possibility of future rate hikes in his post here. Elam notes that the Federal Reserve's overnight rate stands at a range of 5.25%-5.50%, above both measures of inflation. The US Central bank has slowed the pace of its rate hikes and settled for one interest rate increase in the past three meetings.\n\nWhile market participants expect another \u201cno change\u201d decision from the US Fed, the Central bank left room for another hike in 2023. Elam says,\n\n\u201cThe bank's dot plot showed a target of 5.6% by year-end, leaving the door open to another move. With no new forecasts at this juncture, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely insist on another move, leaving his options open. One reason to do that is the buoyant jobs market.\u201d\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum prices hover at crucial levels\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are hovering around crucial levels, ahead of the bank\u2019s decision on Wednesday. Bitcoin price sustained above $34,400 while Ethereum is trading above its $1,800 psychological level."

        "title": "Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Indicates What's Next for L2s and Bridges - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) founder attempted to make a simplified classification of Layer-2 solutions on the top of Ethereum (ETH) and proposed two elegant designs to make L1/L2 bridging more secure and resource-optimized.\n\nFrom reading bridges to validation bridges: Vitalik Buterin on L1/L2 consistency\n\nIn 2023, there are three types of L2 solutions dominating the EVM ecosystem: rollups, validiums and disconnected system. While rollups store the data on L1, validiums use servers or other isolated systems for these purposes. Rollups verify the data via fraud-proof or zk-SNARKs, while validiums only support zk-SNARKS.\n\nDifferent types of layer 2shttps://t.co/ry4VTtWhJ1 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) October 31, 2023\n\nThis scheme was described by Vitalk Buterin in his latest blog post published today, Oct. 31, 2023.\n\nTwo factors are dominant, he says, when it comes to choosing this or that L2 design to build on. First, it is the cost of native Ethereum (ETH) data availability and then the application's own needs, i.e., its interest in higher speed or more enhanced security.\n\nThen, if the Ethereum (ETH) mainnet somehow reverts (unexpectedly splits into two independent versions), the L2 network can only read finalized blocks or revert as well: here are the two main models needed to keep the L1/L2 system consistent.\n\nAnother productive concept in this segment is the so-called validating bridge, i.e., a cross-blockchain mechanism that can prove the validity of its \"underlying\" blockchain:\n\n\"Now, let's make the bridge a validating bridge: it checks not just consensus, but also a ZK-SNARK proving that the state of any new block was computed correctly.\"\n\nOnce this is done, the top chain's validators can no longer steal your funds. They can publish a block with unavailable data, preventing everyone from withdrawing, but they cannot steal (except by trying to extract a ransom for users in exchange for revealing the data that allows them to withdraw).\n\nHowever, the L1/L2 equilibrium is still vulnerable until some \"form of governance gadget on Ethereum\" is able to make the bridge contract on Ethereum (ETH) aware of a hypothetical hard fork taking place.\n\nNo \"one-size-fits-all\" solution for Ethereum L2s, here's why\n\nAll of these \"add-ons\" to Ethereum (ETH) L2s' security and operability come with their own costs. In terms of security, they can be described as the security of withdrawing to Ethereum or the security of reading Ethereum.\n\nEvery dApp needs to find the perfect solution with its own requirements in mind. For some applications, high security and tight connectedness are of paramount importance. For their competitors, something looser is acceptable in exchange for more advanced scaling opportunities.\n\nHowever, for some systems, improving \"connectedness\" in the coming years, step by step, might be a perfect solution, Buterin concludes."

        "content": "Bitcoin Price and Ethereum Prediction: Will FOMC Meeting Minutes Impact BTC and ETH This Week?\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the two biggest cryptocurrencies in the world, continue to hold above the $24,000 and $1,600 marks, respectively. However, they experienced a slight decline this morning, with Bitcoin falling from $25,000 to $24,000.\n\nThe crypto market continues to fluctuate, investors are keeping a close eye on the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting minutes, which are set to be released this week.\n\n#BTC recovered back to the $24,500 level since the drop on Friday. pic.twitter.com/f8qHM4sPMD \u2014 Rupert Murdoch (@Sir_Ruper) February 20, 2023\n\nThe recent downward trend in cryptocurrency prices may be linked to positive economic data coming out of the United States. This has strengthened the belief that the Federal Reserve will continue with its plan to tighten monetary policy for a longer period than previously expected.\n\nAsian shares got off a subdued start as trading volume was dampened by a US holiday, while hawkish signals from Fed officials continued to weigh on sentiment. pic.twitter.com/m5vQUCapuT \u2014 Arthur Benta (@ArthurBenta) February 20, 2023\n\nIn addition, traders seem to be cautious about making large investments before the release of Coinbase\u2019s results and Hong Kong\u2019s new VASP licensing scheme, both of which are expected to have a significant impact on the market in the upcoming weeks.\n\nHow the Release of FOMC Meeting Minutes on Wednesday Could Impact Crypto Prices?\n\nThe release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes on Wednesday could have an impact on the price of Bitcoin. As the FOMC sets the monetary policy in the United States, any hint of a shift in this policy could affect financial markets, including the cryptocurrency market.\n\nIn a recent speech at the Economic Club of Washington, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell discussed the ongoing disinflation process and expressed confidence in the Fed\u2019s ability to lower inflation to their targeted rate of 2%.\n\nWhile Powell\u2019s response to the strong January jobs report did not indicate a change in the central bank\u2019s approach to future rate increases, he cautioned that sustained strong labor data could lead to a higher terminal level of the Fed funds.\n\nAt its February 2023 meeting, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for the fed funds rate by 25 basis points, now ranging from 4.5% to 4.75%. This is the second consecutive meeting where the size of the increase has been reduced, although borrowing costs are now at their highest point since 2007.\n\nBitcoin traders and investors will be closely watching the FOMC minutes for any indication of inflationary concerns or changes to interest rates, which could potentially impact the price of Bitcoin.\n\nExploring Mild Dips in the Cryptocurrency Market\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market has been performing well in recent days but experienced a slight decline in the most recent 24-hour period. At the time of writing, the market\u2019s total value was $1.11 trillion, representing a 0.68 percent drop in value.\n\nThe market\u2019s inactivity could be related to the fact that the United States is celebrating President\u2019s Day, which may cause traders to be cautious in placing any significant bids. As a result, Bitcoin has also seen a slight drop in value compared to the previous day.\n\nKeeping a close eye on $BTC. If it closes below 24.3k, the we\u2019ll expect to see BTC drop lower. Otherwise it\u2019ll range until it can break above 25.2k \u2013 then it\u2019ll have all the bulls coming out! \ud83d\ude09 #Bitcoin #BTC #cryptomarket #CryptoInvestor #crypto pic.twitter.com/QPQnKUQKqn \u2014 Crypto Guy (@Crypto_Guy360) February 19, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, Ether has also experienced a decline in the past 24 hours, likely for the same reason. As a result, other well-known cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), and Ripple (XRP) have also seen slight losses.\n\nCan a Strong US Dollar Undermine Cryptocurrency? Analyzing the Relationship Between the USD and Digital Assets\n\nThe US dollar has been experiencing significant gains and showing strength across the board, driven by positive US economic data that has pushed back predictions of a prolonged period of monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe market is anticipating that interest rates will need to rise due to recent statistics coming out of the world\u2019s largest economy, which indicate a tight labor market, persistent inflation, robust growth in retail sales, and increased monthly producer prices.\n\nhttps://www.twitter.com/IanCuIIey/status/1627298207666405376?s=20\n\nMarket forecasts indicate that the Fed funds rate is expected to reach a high of slightly under 5.3% by July. The US dollar has been strengthened by the hawkish views of Fed members, who believe that higher interest rates will be necessary to combat inflation successfully.\n\nTransitory disinflation\n\n\n\nOn Thursday we\u2019ll get fresh PCE data and it\u2019s expected to run hot with +0.5%\u2026 largest increase since mid-22 \ud83d\udd25\n\n\n\nFed funds rate is now seen peaking at 5.3% up from 4.9%\n\n\n\n=> Crumbling the basis of the rally is. Back inflation is. A clown JP is.. no balls pic.twitter.com/AB24WS8ne0 \u2014 Yoda Research (@YodaResearch) February 19, 2023\n\nTherefore, the strong US dollar has been considered an important factor contributing to the decline in cryptocurrency values, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nBitcoin Price\n\nLooking at Bitcoin from a technical standpoint, it has been trading sideways and maintaining a narrow range between $23,700 and $25,200. The immediate resistance level for the BTC/USD pair is currently at $25,200, and if the price breaks out above this level, it could potentially reach the $26,000 mark.\n\nHowever, the leading technical indicators, including RSI and MACD, are showing divergence. RSI is presently above 50 in a buying zone, while MACD is forming histograms below 0 in a sell zone. This type of divergence often indicates indecision among investors.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nIf Bitcoin\u2019s price falls below the current support level of $23,750, the next support level would be at $22,850, which is determined by the 50% Fibonacci retracement mark.\n\nIn the upcoming week, the focus will be on the FOMC meeting minutes, which are set to be released on Wednesday. These minutes could potentially impact the price action of Bitcoin.\n\nBuy BTC Now\n\nEthereum Price\n\nThe ETH/USD pair has seen a rise in bullish momentum after finding support near the $1,650 level. On the 2-hour timeframe, Ethereum has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, which suggests indecision in the market and has kept the price of ETH within a choppy range.\n\nIf Ethereum experiences a bullish bounce-off above the $1,650 level, it could potentially reach the $1,720 mark. Additionally, a bullish breakout above the $1,720 level and the symmetrical triangle pattern could drive further bullish price action. In either scenario, the price levels of $1,760 and $1,800 are likely to act as resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nOn the downside, Ethereum has support levels at approximately $1,650 or $1,625. The RSI and MACD are exhibiting divergence, which is comparable to the analysis of Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nThis indicates that investors may be waiting for a significant news event, such as the release of the FOMC meeting minutes, to determine the next market trends.\n\nBuy ETH Now\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum Alternatives\n\nIn addition to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), there are several other altcoins in the cryptocurrency market that show significant potential. The CryptoNews Industry Talk team has conducted an analysis and created a list of the top 15 cryptocurrencies to watch in 2023.\n\nThis list is updated regularly with new altcoins and ICO projects, so it is recommended to check back frequently for the latest additions.\n\nDisclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.\n\nFind The Best Price to Buy/Sell Cryptocurrency"

        "content": "Solana has seen a 22.47% increase over the past week.\n\nThe increase saw the token recover the FTX collapse.\n\nBreakpoint 2023 event catalyzes Solana\u2019s market metrics.\n\nThis week saw the crypto market buzzing with activity, fueled by macroeconomic events and optimism. Even so, Solana managed to stand out in performance.\n\nAfter almost a year, the altcoin recovered from the disastrous collapse of FTX, one of its largest holders. But what is fueling this recovery?\n\nWhat\u2019s Driving Solana\u2019s Performance\n\nOn Monday, November 1, Solana\u2019s price stood at $38.90, marking a significant 22.47% increase over the past week. This comes against a significant community event and a sense of optimism among investors.\n\nA recent event that has significantly impacted Solana\u2019s metrics is the Breakpoint 2023 conference. Held from October 30 to November 3, 2023, the event is taking place at the Solana Campus within TAETs Art and Event Park, located just 15 minutes from central Amsterdam.\n\nOne of the speakers was Anatoly Yakovenko, who drew some attention due to his commitment to the Halloween spirit. The Solana founder came to the stage in a dragon costume.\n\nThe conference\u2019s apparent success is also driving Solana\u2019s price, helping it recover to its price before the collapse of FTX.\n\nSolana\u2019s Comes Back After the FTX Collapse\n\nThanks to this rally, Solana has, for the first time, reached the level before the FTX collapse in November 2022.\n\nThe bankruptcy of FTX had a significant impact on Solana, as FTX was one of the largest holders of SOL. Its collapse led to a ripple effect on the broader Solana ecosystem, plummeting SOL prices. In December 2022, the altcoin fell below $10.\n\nSolana\u2019s ties to FTX have been a point of contention in the crypto space since the collapse. Moreover, traders were concerned about FTX\u2019s still significant SOL holdings. Despite these concerns, SOL has recovered steadily over the past 11 months.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nDespite the FTX collapse, the Solana Foundation continued to develop. This has boosted the community\u2019s confidence in the project.\n\nThe potential liquidation of SOL holdings by the FTX estate could still impact Solana\u2019s price negatively.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nSolana\u2019s recent performance shows resilience and could indicate its potential as a long-term player in the crypto space.\n\nRead more about Solana\u2019s latest surge:\n\nUnpacking Solana\u2019s 7% Price Jump: What You Need to Know\n\n\n\nRead more about the dYdX mainnet launch:\n\nBridging and Staking Debut with dYdX Chain Launch"

        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nGiven the recent gains made by the cryptocurrency market, analysts are optimistic that its bull run isn\u2019t going to be short-lived. Based on their observations and market indicators, many of them feel that Ethereum can potentially cross $2,500 in November.\n\nExperts are also full of praise for the newly launched decentralized platform InQubeta (QUBE) which has impressed investors with its strong presale performance. The decentralized platform helps startups leveraging artificial intelligence find investors for their projects.\n\nEven though it was rolled out just a few months ago, it is now on every analyst\u2019s best cryptocurrency ICO list after its presale funding hit the $ 4.1 million mark.\n\nInQubeta: Fast-tracking startup growth with blockchain\n\nInQubeta is among the altcoins to watch out for this year as it seeks to disrupt the startup and AI sectors with a dose of DeFi potential. By making a user-friendly DeFi solution more accessible to startups, it ensures that these budding companies don\u2019t have to stall their plans due to lack of funding.\n\nInvestors who back these projects also gain by investing in future-forward projects. Its native cryptocurrency QUBE token is used for all transactions, be it taxes or regular payments.\n\nPowered by the ERC-20 standard, the QUBE token is more than just a cryptocurrency facilitating transactions for a decentralized platform. It\u2019s a mainstay of InQubeta\u2019s governance structure that\u2019s based on the decentralized autonomous organization model. Under the model, community members are consulted on all major decisions, and their views are incorporated for all key protocol changes.\n\nIf a community member has a suggestion that could enhance the capability of the platform, they can forward it as a proposal. While the community discusses the proposal, token holders get the final say if it should be implemented.\n\nAll token holders get voting privileges that they can use during the voting process for a proposal. Using these voting privileges, token holders can act in the best interests of the platform.\n\nThe hype around the QUBE token is understandable when you consider its anti-inflationary character. The token supply is regulated to keep it intentionally scarce so that the asset\u2019s price doesn\u2019t fluctuate much. The feature helps keep token holders\u2019 returns intact when the markets are turbulent or inflation is high.\n\nInQubeta has become one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy in today\u2019s market with its transparent model. Its transparency ensures that startups and investors do not feel short-changed and get a fair deal. Before startups connect with investors, they submit a proposal that contains the reward they are ready to offer the investor.\n\nThese offers are then minted into NFTs and uploaded on InQubeta\u2019s online marketplace. Investors can assess, compare, and buy these NFTs. It\u2019s not necessary that an investor buys the entire NFT, they can also purchase a smaller part of the asset. This is made possible with fractionalization. InQubeta allows even retail users to invest in startups.\n\nEthereum-based spot ETFs may hit the market next: Raoul Pal\n\nEthereum is among the most versatile cryptocurrencies that you can find in today\u2019s market. It powers not just blockchain protocols but dApps, virtual machines, cryptocurrencies as well as NFTs.\n\nEthereum\u2019s key USP is that it\u2019s an entire ecosystem backed by a strong blockchain network with smart contract capability. The use of blockchain for smart contract execution further improves its efficiency. The platform\u2019s native token is called ETH and it is among the most demanded cryptocurrencies in the world.\n\nIt seems it\u2019s not just crypto analysts who are smitten by Ethereum but other experts too. In a recent media interview, macro expert Raoul Pal said it is only a matter of time before Ethereum-based spot ETFs hit the market. He said Ethereum spot ETFs could be seen as \u2018trade agreements\u2019 that could fetch great capital returns on investments.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith its ongoing successful run, the crypto market is a happening place with its fair share of cutting-edge financial instruments. As the recent performance of tokens like InQubeta and Ethereum shows, there is no dearth of options for anyone, whether you are an experienced or an amateur investor.\n\nIf you are wondering what cryptos to buy now, then consider the two coins described above as they have strong utilities and are guided by unique ecosystems.\n\nHowever, users must remember that diversification can help in reducing the risk in the long term.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale"

According to Pentoshi, the bulls are already celebrating SOL\u2019s big rallies as of late which tells him that the crypto asset may be close to witnessing a pullback.\n\n\u201cThe timeline is getting a little loud on this one. Probably local top soonish, in the purple box.\u201d\n\nLooking at the trader\u2019s chart, he seems to predict that SOL will likely meet resistance at $38.70. At time of writing, SOL is worth $38.59.\n\nAnother altcoin on the analyst\u2019s radar is the governance token of the Ethereum (ETH)-based decentralized finance lending protocol Aave (AAVE). According to Pentoshi, AAVE will see a big breakout rally if it manages to breach resistance at $90.\n\n\u201cThis one likely consolidates a bit more. A break above $90 likely brings $112-$115.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Dissects Evolving Landscape of Ethereum Layer 2 Scaling Solutions - Milk Road",
        "content": "As Ethereum continues to cement itself as the leading smart contract blockchain network, an array of layer 2 scaling solutions have emerged to help bring greater capacity, lower costs, and increased security to the ecosystem. According to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, the layer 2 landscape is likely to remain diverse and heterogeneous going forward.\n\nIn a recent blog post titled \u201cDifferent Types of Layer 2s,\u201d Buterin provided an overview of the current state of Ethereum layer 2 solutions and why he expects continued variation in technical approaches:\n\nDifferent types of layer 2shttps://t.co/ry4VTtWhJ1 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) October 31, 2023\n\nThe Expanding EVM Rollup Ecosystem\n\nEVM rollups like Arbitrum, Optimism, Scroll, and more recently, Kakarot and Taiko have made major advancements in improving the security of their solutions through innovations in fraud proof mechanisms and zero-knowledge proofs.\n\nPolygon, originally an independent layer 1 blockchain, has also built its own EVM rollup called Polygon zkEVM to complement its existing sidechain solution.\n\nBy bringing rollup technology to their sidechains, projects like Polygon aim to provide an incremental path toward greater Ethereum interoperability and security.\n\nBeyond EVM Rollups\n\nIn addition to EVM rollups, \u201calmost-EVMs\u201d like zkSync allow Ethereum developers to reuse their skillsets while enabling advanced scaling capabilities through zk-SNARKs.\n\nStarknet has also emerged as a leading permissionless decentralized rollup using STARK proofs.\n\nOther creative solutions like Arbitrum Stylus and Fuel Labs build on top of Arbitrum and Starknet, respectively, to extend functionality.\n\nMotivations for Heterogeneity\n\nAccording to Buterin, there are several key reasons driving continued innovation and heterogeneity across layer 2 solutions:\n\nTransitioning Independent Chains\n\nSome projects currently operating as standalone layer 1s wish to integrate more deeply with Ethereum to benefit from its security and liquidity.\n\nHowever, these projects need time to transition gradually, as shifting entirely to a rollup now would hurt usability, but waiting too long risks missing the opportunity.\n\nPartial Decentralization\n\nCentralized applications exploring blockchain integration only require \u201chalfway house\u201d decentralization, not the full security guarantees of a rollup.\n\nTheir high throughput needs also make rollups impractical in the short term. Validiums and sidechains are better suited for these use cases today.\n\nVariable Security Requirements\n\nConsumer apps like social media and gaming need modularity to handle different security requirements. High-value activities warrant rollup security, while low-value actions can rely on lower guarantees.\n\nPaying for Security\n\nWhile Ethereum native users may tolerate rollup fees to improve security, non-blockchain users are accustomed to zero fees. Solutions like sidechains and validiums can offer a smoother onboarding experience in the near term.\n\nEvaluating Tradeoffs\n\nWhen assessing the tradeoffs between solutions offering varying degrees of decentralization and Ethereum interoperability, Buterin highlights two key considerations:\n\nEthereum\u2019s native data availability is improving through innovations like proto-danksharding and data compression techniques. This expands the viability of highly secure rollup solutions over time.\n\nThe needs and sensitivities of specific use cases. Finance applications demand robust security guarantees. Consumer apps can better tolerate lower security and runaway fees.\n\nMeasuring Connectedness\n\nButerin notes two primary dimensions for evaluating a layer 2\u2019s \u201cconnectedness\u201d to Ethereum:\n\nWithdrawal Security\n\nThe guarantees allow users to withdraw assets issued on Ethereum back to the base layer. Rollups provide stronger assurances than validiums.\n\nReading Ethereum Data\n\nThe ability to read Ethereum state and sync revert actions Tighter coupling enables superior composability but requires more complex bridge logic.\n\nFor both dimensions, projects sit on a spectrum, ranging from loose integration to tight interleaving with Ethereum. There are merits to different approaches depending on the use case:\n\n\u201cIn many cases, starting with something looser today and moving to a tighter coupling over the next decade as technology improves may well be optimal.\u201d Buterin concludes.\n\nThe layer 2 landscape is primed to continue diversifying as Ethereum gears up for native scaling improvements in sharding and rollup interoperability.\n\nWhile rollups are likely to serve as long-term solutions for decentralized finance and other security-critical applications, alternative layer 2 technologies will also proliferate in the coming years to meet the needs of gaming, social media, the Internet of Things, and more."

        "content": "Bitcoin Price and Ethereum Prediction: Can FOMC Meeting Minutes Boost The Cryptocurrency Market?\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, has failed to maintain its upward momentum and has fallen below $24,000 in the last 24 hours, dropping from its peak of $25,100 due to a significant reversal in the cryptocurrency market. Following Bitcoin\u2019s lead, Ethereum has also seen a gradual decline in the past 24 hours.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market continues to experience volatility, all eyes are on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting minutes scheduled to be released today. The outcome of this event is expected to have a significant impact on the market, particularly on Bitcoin and Ethereum prices.\n\nCryptocurrency Market Analysis: A Fundamental Outlook\n\nThe downward trend in the cryptocurrency market can be mainly attributed to the upcoming release of preliminary GDP data and PCE figures from the United States, which are expected to increase market volatility.\n\nStart of new week seeing a lot of negative delta, while price still holds above $24,000\n\n\n\nIf we were to drop, I would be looking at the imbalance marked below, but in the meantime we could see a squeeze higher#BTC pic.twitter.com/v6vle4v8VB \u2014 JW (@JW100x) February 22, 2023\n\nIn addition, the upcoming release of the Federal Reserve\u2019s February meeting minutes is viewed as another factor causing investors to hesitate and contributing to Bitcoin\u2019s losses. The central bank is expected to deliver a hawkish stance in the Fed minutes, which is keeping cryptocurrency gains in check.\n\nMost Asian currencies fell on Tuesday, while the dollar advanced against a basket of currencies as markets awaited more cues on U.S. monetary policy from the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s February meeting and more inflation data. pic.twitter.com/hlICzmpzpA \u2014 Parkmoneyfx (@parkmoneyfx) February 21, 2023\n\nMoreover, the previously released higher-than-expected US PMI has given the Fed additional economic headroom to hike interest rates, adding to the cautious sentiment in the crypto market.\n\nRisk-Off Wave in the Crypto Market: Eyes on Key US Data\n\nDespite the emergence of several positive regulations for the cryptocurrency market, the global cryptocurrency market has failed to sustain its upward trend and has turned negative for the day. This is likely due to cautious investor sentiment ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s February meeting minutes, as investors await more clarity on US interest rates and the path of monetary policy.\n\nIn addition, the upcoming release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index is also expected to increase market volatility.\n\nBTC Daily Technical Outlook:$BTC closed bearish as the US stock indices declined sharply, one more bearish candle will make Bitcoin bearish for a couple of weeks.

Higher yields typically lead investors to withdraw their money from riskier investments.\n\nU.S. stocks ended higher after stronger-than-expected retail sales data offered evidence of a resilient economy, but gains were capped as investors worried about more interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve https://t.co/e6F5Tf1aMS pic.twitter.com/Qh1ew6YYEv \u2014 Reuters (@Reuters) February 16, 2023\n\nThis week, all eyes are also on Thursday\u2019s report of the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, which is expected to reveal that inflation remained strong in January.

The agency stated that these upgrades are a part of its ongoing efforts to remain competitive in the industry and be proactive in addressing issues related to virtual currencies.\n\nhttps://www.twitter.com/dumbwire/status/1628161667887681537?s=20\n\nThe recent improvements made by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to detect unlawful activity involving virtual currency among the organizations it supervises are seen as a positive development for the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe NYDFS is proactively taking steps to stay competitive and keep up with the evolving landscape of virtual currencies. The department recently announced additional capabilities to detect potential insider trading, market manipulation, and front-running activity associated with Department-regulated entities\u2019 and applicants\u2019 exposure or potential exposure to listed virtual currency wallet addresses.\n\nThis move is expected to aid in the expansion of cryptocurrencies. The NYDFS made the announcement on February 21 but did not provide any details about the \u201cnew insider trading and market manipulation risk monitoring tools.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s examine the technical aspect of the market.\n\nBitcoin Price\n\nLooking at the technical analysis of BTC/USD, the pair has broken a crucial support level of $24,500 and has begun to decline toward $23,900. However, the double bottom pattern has transformed this level into a significant support level for Bitcoin.\n\nIn the 2-hour timeframe, an ascending triangle pattern has formed with an upward trendline providing support near $24,000. If Bitcoin falls below this level, the next support level will be around $23,400. The RSI and MACD indicators are in the selling zone, which is adding selling pressure to Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nBitcoin\u2019s immediate resistance is at $24,500, and a rise in buying pressure could lead to a breakout above this level, exposing BTC to the next resistance level at $25,200.\n\nInvestors are keeping a close eye on the FOMC meeting minutes, which will be released today at 7:00 PM (GMT). This event is expected to impact future trends in the financial markets, making it crucial to remain focused.\n\nBuy BTC Now\n\nEthereum Price\n\nThe ETH/USD pair has broken below its choppy range of $1,675 to $1,725 and is currently showing a downward trend. Ethereum\u2019s next support level is expected to be around the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $1,630.\n\nIf the downward momentum continues and there is a bearish breakout below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, the downtrend could extend toward the $1,600 or $1,565 levels.\n\nEthereum Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nIf the ETH/USD pair can maintain above the $1,630 level, it may lead to a potential price rebound toward the $1,675 or $1,740 level.\n\nBuy ETH Now\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum Alternatives\n\nApart from Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), there are many other altcoins in the cryptocurrency market that are worth watching. To help investors stay up-to-date, the CryptoNews Industry Talk team has conducted an analysis and compiled a list of the top 15 cryptocurrencies to keep an eye on in 2023.\n\nThis list is regularly updated with new altcoins and ICO projects, so it is recommended to check back often for the latest additions.\n\nDisclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.\n\nFind The Best Price to Buy/Sell Cryptocurrency"

        "content": "Tue 31 Oct 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Evans S.\n\n\u25aa Altcoins\n\nThe unprecedented boom in options on the Ethereum crypto (ETH) has taken many in the ecosystem by surprise. ETH option block volumes recently passed the impressive threshold of $250 million. Behind this figure lies a complex phenomenon, tinged with both opportunities and challenges.\n\nThe spectacular rise of Ethereum options\n\nOn October 30, the market witnessed a massive flow of call options trading on the Ethereum crypto, reaching a total of over 140,000 contracts. These figures reflect growing optimism among institutional investors.\n\nAccording to a report from Greeks Live, a reference for crypto options traders, most of these trades involved the purchase of monthly options in the 1650/1700/1800 range, which will expire on November 24. More intriguingly, despite a 6.28% rise in put sales, call purchases jumped 12.85%.\n\nThe implications of these rising volumes\n\nThe remarkable increase in call option trading shows that investors are betting on a rise in the price of the Ethereum crypto. On the other hand, a 3% rise in short-term implied volatility suggests that the market is anticipating a price fluctuation in the near future.\n\nInterestingly, however, bullish investor sentiment on Ethereum contrasts with recent CoinShares data.\n\nDespite an influx into many altcoins due to optimism around Bitcoin, Ethereum saw an outflow of $6 million. These contradictory data beg the question: what will be the real impact of these option volumes on the market in the long term?\n\nAn evolving crypto market\n\nThe meteoric growth of ETH options block volumes is more than just a milestone for crypto and the Ethereum ecosystem. It testifies to the growing momentum and maturity of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nWith increasing liquidity and the potential stabilization of the market thanks to options, Ethereum seems to be well on the way to consolidating its position as one of the leading cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s vital to remember that the crypto sphere is inherently volatile. While the future of ETH options looks bright, it\u2019s crucial for investors and traders to remain informed and cautious.\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey has only just begun, and every step of the way will bring its share of surprises and lessons. Even the UN is taking an interest.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program! Earn points for each article you read and gain access to exclusive rewards.

        "title": "Best Crypto for Online Poker: Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Stablecoins? - Tight Poker",
        "content": "Of course there\u2019s more than one crypto. Bitcoin is easily the most famous crypto but Ethereum, Solana and USDC all have compelling features for playing online poker.\n\nToday we\u2019ll take a closer look at the most popular coins for online poker and which one might be right for you.\n\nThe Basics\n\nThere\u2019s a decent amount of variety between the different coins you can buy but if you\u2019re using it primarily for online there are some common features you\u2019ll likely prize highly including the following:\n\nAccessibility\n\nThe more exchanges or apps that offer a cryptocurrency the easier it will be for you to buy it. For instance Bitcoin is available on every crypto exchange and many apps like PayPal and Cash app. In addition an online poker site has to have built-in support for accepting the coin of your choice.\n\nReliability\n\nCrypto is already extremely volatile so it\u2019s best to pick the most stable assets (at least for crypto) when picking a coin for online poker use. You\u2019ll want to stick to the top coins by market cap and avoid meme coins that might not even exist in a few years.\n\nSpeed\n\nA faster coin means faster deposits and withdrawals, which is ideal for online poker. This is the one major downside of Bitcoin, which takes minutes or hours to settle. Altcoins can potentially settle in seconds.\n\nThe Easy Choice \u2013 Bitcoin\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to spend too much time on researching cryptocurrency then just use Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is, by far, the most popular crypto in the world with a market cap that has exceeded a trillion dollars at various times in its existence.\n\nYou\u2019ll find support for Bitcoin and every major exchange as well as payment apps such as PayPal, Venmo or Cash App. In other words: It\u2019s easy to buy.\n\nBitcoin, while still volatile, is significantly less risky than some of the smaller altcoins. It has the most impressive price performance over the longest period of time. Whenever the crypto market moves it tends to be Bitcoin at front and center with other coins playing catch up.\n\nFinally the two major downsides of using Bitcoin for online poker: 1. Bitcoin remains one of the slowest coins with transactions potentially taking hours. 2. It\u2019s not near as stable as stablecoins.\n\nPros\n\nThe most popular crypto in the world.\n\nAvailable everywhere crypto is sold as well as PayPal, Venmo Cash App and more.\n\nExceptional price performance over the last decade.\n\nCons\n\nSlow\n\nPrice still volatile compared to traditional currency or stocks\n\nNot as stable as stablecoins\n\nThe Faster Choice \u2013 Ethereum or Other Altcoins\n\nIf you\u2019re not interested in Bitcoin than the next best choice might be Ethereum.\n\nEthereum is the second most popular crypto in the world and it does offer some advantages over the venerable BTC.\n\nFor online poker the biggest reason to use Ethereum over Bitcoin will likely come down transaction speed. Ethereum is 2X to 3X faster than Bitcoin and transactions usually settle in seconds or a couple minutes meaning it\u2019s easy to confirm your online poker deposit.\n\nThe other major feature of Ethereum is that, outside of Bitcoin, it\u2019s probably proven to be the most reliable crypto over the last decade.\n\nThe major downside of Ethereum is that the fees can be quite expensive during peak times on the network. It\u2019s not unheard of for an Ethereum transaction to cost $5-$10 during busy times.\n\nOf course you could pick an altcoins like Solana (SOL) or Avalanche (AVAX) if you want even faster settlement times and cheaper fees but those are significantly less proven than Bitcoin or Ethereum and online poker sites don\u2019t always accept the more obscure coins.\n\nPros\n\nFaster than Bitcoin\n\nAvailable on every major crypto exchange and some apps\n\nUsable for NFTs, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) or Staking\n\nCons\n\nHigh fees\n\nVolatile\n\nNot as available as Bitcoin\n\nThe Stable Choice \u2013 Stablecoins\n\nStablecoins might be the best possible choice for online poker if you don\u2019t want to invest in crypto and just want a stable method of deposit and withdrawal. Stablecoins, unlike traditional crypto, are pegged to a real-world asset (such as USD) and always hold their value to that asset.\n\nThere are many different stablecoins \u2014 Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) are the most popular \u2014 but the all share similar traits.\n\nStablecoins eschew the volatility of traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum for a completely stable value. Stablecoins work on a variety of different networks including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche and others and offer extremely fast transactions and extremely low fees.\n\nThe downside of stablecoins is that you will never experience any of that legendary price appreciation of coins like Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nOn the other hand, if you\u2019re just looking to play poker than stablecoins might be the best possible choice.\n\nPros\n\nCompletely stable with no volatility\n\nFast transactions with low fees\n\nAvailable on most crypto exchanges\n\nCons\n\nStablecoins never appreciate\n\nMore regulation is coming for stablecoins\n\nNot available on all payment apps\n\nWhat\u2019s the Right Choice for Me?\n\nAt the end of the day only you will know what\u2019s right for you when it comes to picking a cryptocurrency for playing online poker.\n\nBitcoin is probably the most widely accepted and most supported crypto in the world and that makes it an easy choice for poker players.\n\nYou could argue that if you\u2019re only interested in playing online poker and don\u2019t want to speculate on the crypto market than stablecoins like USDC or USDT are actually the best choice.\n\nFinally if you\u2019re really interested in crypto and blockchain technology than you might want to learn about some of the newer coins such as Ethereum, Solana or Avalanche and buy some units of each.\n\nThe only thing we\u2019ll say for sure is that it\u2019s probably a good idea to avoid lesser-known coins for online poker. You can take your chances at the poker tables instead of on risky coins."

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum wallet and protocol communication protocol WalletConnect is facing heat for blocking users from Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThe protocol was criticized for defeating the purpose of blockchain and decentralization by controlling access to services.\n\nWalletConnect CEO Pedro Gomes cited legal and OFAC guidance as the reason behind the move.\n\nEthereum is called the home of decentralized finance (DeFi), owing to the vast array of protocols running on the chain, which amount to nearly 950. Thus, it does not come as a surprise when users react negatively to the supposed \u201cdecentralized\u201d applications and decide to alter who can and cannot access their protocols.\n\nEthereum dApps: Not so decentralized\n\nEthereum is the base chain that supports the operation of the open-source protocol that enables the communication and interaction between a wallet and dApps. The protocol recently became the target of crypto enthusiasts after WalletConnect decided to take some measures.\n\nThe protocol over the past 24 hours blocked all users from Russia and some parts of Ukraine. People using the service were given an \u201cerror 1009 access denied\u201d message. As this came to light, crypto users, as well as influencers, took to X, formerly Twitter, to express their anger over the app.\n\nPopular crypto researcher Chris Blec tweeted,\n\n\u201cWalletConnect, an app that is deeply baked into the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem, is now blocking normal users in Ukraine, Russia, North Korea, Iran, Cuba, and Syria. They are punishing these people for the sins of their tyrannical governments. This is the state of Ethereum in 2023.\n\nThese claims can be verified by accessing the source code of the protocol since it is open-source, wherein it is evident that not just Russia and Ukraine but users from North Korea, Syria, Cuba and Iran are also facing similar issues.\n\nUsers even suggested that the fact that such an option exists is proof that the protocol is not truly decentralized. The point of being decentralized is so that no one authority or entity can control the actions of other participants, which has been evidently flouted by WalletConnect. Another user stated,\n\n\u201cSeriously, I just lost my business forever. A custody interface platform ability to block usage by geo is not protection it is liability \u2014 this should not be engineered into their connect platform.\n\nWalletConnect supports over 75 top wallets on the blockchain, which makes this move rather significant, given about 6.76% of the entire traffic they receive comes from Russia, making it their third largest target country.\n\nWalletConnect traffic source\n\nWalletConnect blames regulation\n\nWalletConnect, upon being criticized for their decision, issued a statement on Twitter where they cited the latest legal and OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) guidance. The Delaware-based protocol is facing the same problems as other crypto companies in the United States: lack of clear regulations.\n\nBack when Russia attacked Ukraine in February this year, the regulatory authorities in the US ensured sanctions on certain Russian oligarchs and blocked their access on Binance, Coinbase and other top exchanges to prevent them from selling their crypto holdings.\n\nThus, in the end, the blame goes back to the regulatory issue in the USA. WalletConnect CEO Pedro Gomes, in the statement, also said that while some Ukraine areas\u2019 IP addresses were blocked initially, they have since been re-enabled. He also did not confirm the blocking of other countries mentioned in the GitHub source code, saying, \u201cWe can confirm that no other countries were blocked\u201d."

        "content": "Institutional Firms Project Ether As Crypto with The Biggest Growth Outlook: Survey\n\nGlobal wealth fund managers have backed Ethereum (ETH) as the asset with the highest growth projection despite a slow price increase in recent months, a new survey shows.\n\nA new CoinShares Digital Asset Quarterly Fund survey shows an analysis of market-related activities, regulation, and institutional investment in the ecosystem amongst others.\n\nAccording to the study, big investment firms believe that Ether has the best growth prospects amongst other top coins even as its products record a poor run this year.\n\nOf the 55 participants, 45% viewed ether with the most growth while 39% sided with the market leader, Bitcoin. Solana, which has been described as an institutional investor favorite in terms of related products, notched 6% of the votes.\n\nThis recent survey shows positive sparks around the biggest altcoin following weekly outflows in its investment products earning the tag \u201cleast loved altcoin in 2023.\u201d\n\n\u201dAlthough this sentiment has not been reflected in our fund flows report, which indicates $127 million of outflows this year, taking the place as the most unloved altcoin.\u201d\n\nInvestors eye yield\n\n\n\nMost institutional investors base their analysis on the high rate of validator entry queue due to profits from yields. Ethereum remains the largest decentralized blockchain and with many applications, users stand to gain from its ecosystem.\n\nAlthough this has been popular for years, the ETH Merge one year ago that saw the network transition to a Proof-of-Stake blockchain replacing miners with validators increased talks of wider adoption as investors looked to make more profit.\n\nThis was not reflected in the price of the asset as the asset plunged for most of last year due to wider market factors and slow growth.\n\nBitcoin remained fairly unchanged in terms of outlook despite many analysts describing it as a safe asset in the wake of the recent regulatory onslaught by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nInvestments in Ripple (XRP) have seen growth making up about 14% of the participant choices due to its legal victory over the SEC. Multi-asset positions declined by 6% culminating in outflows of $35 million.\n\nRegulation remains a major concern\n\n\n\nThe recent actions taken by authorities have led to an increase in confidence of some investors although many remain skeptical that overzealous regulators may scare users from the ecosystem.\n\nAccording to the survey, regulators remain a top risk for most fund managers although this quarter recorded a 7% drop in sentiments of a wider government ban. Other risks include accessibility and the general crypto winter.\n\nThe majority of participants delved into the crypto market as a result of the growth of blockchain technology while an increasing number bought assets for speculative reasons and good value.\n\nThe survey was conducted from responses by 58 global asset managers with over $500 billion in assets under management."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) price ran out of momentum slightly above $1,800 dampening investor optimism for a run-up above $2,000. While declines have been minor below the immediate support/resistance at $1,800, bulls lack the momentum to resume the uptrend.\n\nMeanwhile, a report of the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, transferring 100 ETH to Coinbase is raising concerns over the future of the ecosystem, with some expecting headwinds. Chinese reporter was the first to mention the transaction worth around $181,000 at the time of transfer.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Vitalik holding address vitalik.eth transferred 100 ETH ($181,000) to Coinbase today. Previously, Vitalik stated that he had not sold ETH for personal benefit since 2018, mainly donating it to a charity or non-profit organization or other projects.https://t.co/jmuDIPOOTM \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 1, 2023\n\nWhy Is Buterin Moving Ethereum\n\nThis is not the first time the co-founder has transferred his Ethereum holdings. He recently addressed similar concerns, saying that he had not sold any Ether since 2018 at least not for business or personal gain.\n\nButerin mainly donates his ETH holdings to charity, non-profit organizations, and other projects.\n\nHowever, the community accepted Buterin\u2019s statement with a grain of salt, with some like @JasonWavesRider (a user on X (formerly Twitter) raising more concerns that something bigger could be coming.\n\nInteresting to see Vitalik moving ETH, especially since he said he hadn't sold ETH for personal benefit since 2018. Wonder what he's up to. #ethereum #vitalikbuterin \u2014 Maket Waves Rider (@JasonWavesRider) November 1, 2023\n\nHe may be moving ETH due to personal reasons or it could be that he is financing another project. Either way, the real reason behind these frequent transfers remains unknown.\n\nWhere Is Ethereum Heading Amid Uncertainty\n\nThe uncertainty around the lack of transparency regarding transactions made by Buterin is not helping the token which must regain the ground above $1,800 to ensure investor confidence in the uptrend is not lost.\n\nBased on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) retreating from the overbought region, the price of Ethereum is likely to slide significantly below $1,800. Support at $1,740 may provide the necessary liquidity to create the momentum for a larger breakout toward $2,000.\n\nAs Ethereum rebounds above $1,800 traders will start to identify critical levels such as the descending trendline that stopped the bullish party in October. A successful breakout is needed at this price point to affirm the positive outlook as well as the uptrend.\n\nThe next key level would be the seller congestion at $1,900 which will either pave the way for the climb to $2,000 or delay the breakout for a period of consolidation, not to mention, the possibility of a correction back to $1,800 or a lower support area like $1,740.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Capuski / Getty Images\n\nCryptocurrency might have started as a Wild West of investing dominated by mavericks, but it\u2019s now firmly in the financial mainstream. Institutional investors and big banks treat it as a serious asset despite its volatility, the collapse of a major exchange and regulatory crackdowns. But how do you know what crypto is worth investing in? Keep reading to learn about the next big cryptocurrency.\n\nWhat Is the Next Big Cryptocurrency? 9 To Watch for 2023\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to get involved in the cryptocurrency market, you might be wondering which one will bring the biggest potential return. Although bitcoin might be the obvious choice, it\u2019s not necessarily the best one in 2023. Your chances of having a big payoff might be better with a smaller coin that hasn\u2019t already been pumped up by institutional investors.\n\nHere are nine cryptocurrencies to keep on your radar for 2023:\n\nEthereum (ETH) BNB (BNB) Tether (USDT) Decentraland (MANA) Algorand (ALGO) Render Token (RNDR) Everlodge (ELDG) Shiba Inu (SHIB) Aptos (APT)\n\n1. Ethereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum, commonly known as ether, is the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency behind bitcoin, even outperforming bitcoin at times. In 2021, Ethereum instituted a major upgrade that reduced the supply of ether, currently at 120.26 million coins as of Nov. 1. The upgrade also allowed the Ethereum network to handle more transactions per second, improve the platform\u2019s scalability and lower transaction fees.\n\nCompared to bitcoin, ethereum lacks scarcity \u2014 bitcoin\u2019s supply is capped at 21 million coins \u2014 and widespread acceptance by companies and governments. However, unlike bitcoin, ethereum isn\u2019t just a store of value. It also powers an infrastructure on which apps can be built. Other cryptocurrencies are issued on Ethereum, and it serves as the foundation of decentralized finance.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nMany metaverse projects, including Star Atlas, Axie Infinity and The Sandbox, use the Ethereum blockchain, as do most NFTs. Another upgrade, this one launched in September 2022, transitioned Ethereum to a Web3-ready proof-of-stake mechanism that reduced energy consumption by about 99.95% and further increased security and scalability.\n\nEthereum experienced a major slump last year, losing 70% of its value between November and June, which is about on par with other major cryptocurrencies. The price is on the rise again, so this might be the right time for investors who\u2019ve been waiting to test the cryptocurrency waters. The coin might also appeal to current investors who bought high and would benefit from dollar-cost averaging.\n\n2. BNB (BNB)\n\nBinance is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in terms of trading volumes. Formerly called binance coin, BNB puts about one-fifth of its profits each quarter into permanently getting rid of, or \u201cburning,\u201d BNB tokens, which raises the value of the remaining tokens. It burned 2.14 million BNB tokens \u2014 almost $482 million worth \u2014 in mid-October and expects to eventually burn 50% of the maximum supply.\n\nBinance has two blockchains, which reduce the kind of bottlenecks Ethereum is vulnerable to. It\u2019s also fast and scalable, and Binance is in the process of making the platform more regulator-friendly, according to Seeking Alpha \u2014 a feature that could be crucial to its longevity and widespread adoption, especially in light of the collapse of rival exchange FTX.\n\nIn addition, Binance recently launched Bifinity, a fiat-to-cryptocurrency payment platform that will help merchants prepare to accept digital assets as payments, CoinMarketCap reported. The payment processing platform supports more than 50 cryptocurrencies and major payment networks like Visa and Mastercard.\n\nOn the downside, the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at whether Binance acted improperly in its launch of BNB, mishandled investor funds and lied to regulators. A major fine or other sanction could hurt BNB prices.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\n3. Tether (USDT)\n\nTether is a type of \u201cstablecoin\u201d designed to provide a less volatile alternative to bitcoin because it is linked to another asset. In tether\u2019s case, that asset is the U.S. dollar. In valuation terms, tether usually has a 1-to-1 ratio with the dollar, meaning it is less volatile than cryptos such as bitcoin and ether \u2014 \u201cusually\u201d being the operative word.\n\nWith an $84.82 billion market cap, Tether is the largest stablecoin and the third-largest coin overall. It\u2019s also the most traded coin \u2014 cryptocurrency investors use it to hold funds or make transactions using funds they want to protect against the price swings to which bitcoin, ether and other non-stable cryptocurrencies are vulnerable.\n\n4. Decentraland (MANA)\n\nDecentraland is a virtual reality game on the Ethereum blockchain that uses the MANA token as an in-game currency. Users can purchase goods and services, buy land and visit other players, as well as create and monetize their content. MANA is also the fifth-largest gaming cryptocurrency in terms of market cap.\n\nAlthough Decentraland does have competition from the likes of The Sandbox and Axie Infinity, and in-game assets are quite expensive, it has some benefits that could push the MANA token forward. For example, users retain ownership of the digital assets they create in Decentraland and can convert them to cryptocurrencies other than MANA.\n\nIf the Decentraland metaverse needed a legitimacy boost, it got one in May 2022, when Millennium Hotels and Resorts launched M Social on the platform. According to a press release, this was the first metaverse hotel operated by a hospitality group. Decentraland has also signed a deal to integrate the upcoming film \u201cThe Infinite Machine\u201d and its NFT collection into its metaverse, Variety reported.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\n5. Algorand (ALGO)\n\nAlgorand, founded by noted computer scientist Silvio Micali, might be the next big cryptocurrency as it has positioned itself as a competitor to the Ethereum blockchain. Hundreds of companies, including the International Federation of Association Football, use it, as do the governments of El Salvador and the Marshall Islands.\n\nOne of Algorand\u2019s biggest advantages is its \u201cproof-of-stake\u201d algorithm, which offers a high degree of security and scalability and requires less electricity than Bitcoin and other platforms. This feature will only grow in importance as cryptocurrencies face more criticism \u2014 and possible regulation \u2014 for their massive energy consumption.\n\n6. Render Token (RNDR)\n\nRender Token is a graphic rendering network that lets miners with excess graphics processing unit bandwidth parcel it out to artists and creative studios that need extra computing power. RNDR is the native token creators and miners use in their transactions on the Render Network.\n\nThe cloud graphics company Otoy is behind Render. To further level the graphics-processing playing field, Otoy recently launched its Octane X RNDR app for iOS. The app includes the same Otoy GPU renderer that studios like Disney and Marvel use, Fast Company reported. This could help forge a path for RNDR to become a major player in metaverse rendering.\n\nRNDR was launched in a public sale in 2017, and despite fairly recently getting its listing on the Coinbase exchange, it\u2019s already the No. 1 gaming cryptocurrency by market cap, according to CoinMarketCap. While highly speculative, RNDR could benefit from the increased exposure it\u2019s getting on Coinbase, as well as the extraordinary rise of non-fungible tokens for digital art.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\n7. Everlodge (ELDG)\n\nEverlodge describes itself as being \u201cwhere Airbnb meets Web3.\u201d Indeed, the company is moving vacation rental ownership to the blockchain, where investors soon will be able to purchase fractional shares of short-term rental properties via NFTs.\n\nWhile backed by physical real estate, Everlodge investments will differ from traditional real estate investments in that they\u2019ll be completely decentralized and anonymous, and transactions will execute instantaneously \u2014 no paperwork or closings to contend with.\n\nEach property\u2019s NFT will be divided into fractional shares that investors can purchase for as little as $100. The NFTs will be linked to promissory notes representing the amount invested, according to the project\u2019s whitepaper. Investors will be able to trade their NFTs on third-party marketplaces such as OpenSea.\n\nEverlodge tokens, which will trade under the ELDG ticker, power the Everlodge platform and will serve as the official currency \u2014 investors will purchase their NFTs using ELDG tokens. Presale coins are currently available directly from Everlodge. As of Nov. 1, about 25 million of a total 40 million ELDG coins had sold, and the token price had risen to $0.025 from an initial offering price of $0.01. The launch price is expected to be 0.038.\n\nThis is a new, unproven project and a highly speculative investment. But if the idea takes off, it could revolutionize vacation rental ownership and drive up demand for the token. If that happens, investors could see gains not only from property appreciation, but from appreciation of the coin\u2019s value as well. Investors will also get use of the properties they invest in.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\n8. Shiba Inu (SHIB)\n\nShiba inu is a meme token developed to capitalize on the popularity of the dog breed that appears on dogecoin, the cryptocurrency hyped by Elon Musk. The coin\u2019s meme status is the result of an enthusiastic community of supporters who call themselves the ShibArmy. Despite having little or no practical use beyond raising awareness about the benefits of decentralization and cryptocurrency in general, SHIB is the 19th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe project\u2019s lead developer, who uses the pseudonym Shytoshi Kusama, recently emerged on the social media platform Telegram after a lengthy \u201cquiet mode,\u201d touting some new projects and suggesting that collaborations are in the works for the next stage in the development of the Shibarium blockchain.\n\nFor a typical floundering cryptocurrency, a lack of any specifics about what\u2019s in store for the project might raise suspicion that there\u2019s nothing in the pipeline. But with shiba inu, which has never really had a pipeline, riling up the community might be all it takes to trigger a rally. In fact, SHIB \u201cwhales\u201d \u2014 major holders \u2014 recently bought up 4.5 trillion tokens according to Watchter.Guru, citing data from IntoTheBlock.\n\n9. Aptos (APT)\n\nThe Aptos blockchain is a layer 1 blockchain like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but its developers say it can do what they haven\u2019t \u2014 follow a cloud infrastructure model for security, scalability and reliability to facilitate the widespread adoption of Web3. Its developers made and built Aptos\u2019 predecessor, Diem, which was backed by Meta but, stymied by regulatory issues and opposition from the Federal Reserve, sold off its assets in January 2022, The Verge reported.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nA flood of over $350 million in venture capital, including a $200 billion seed round led by Andreessen Horowitz, and lack of transparent tokenomics has led to criticism from the cryptocurrency community, according to The Crypto Times, and some analysts think aptos, the native token, is already overcapitalized. However, Aptos is already faster and more reliable than Ethereum and seems well positioned to emerge as a major force if it can live up to its hype. For example, the development team claims Aptos will eventually process 160,000 transactions per second \u2014 transactions users will pay for in Aptos\u2019 native token, APT.\n\nHow To Buy Cryptocurrency Buying cryptocurrency is relatively easy. Here are the steps you can take to buy the next big crypto: Open an account with a cryptocurrency exchange or broker: Exchanges such as Coinbase or Binance.US are easy to use and match buyers with sellers. Alternatively, you can choose a broker like Robinhood or SoFi, which execute the trades for you and typically have low fees but feature complicated interfaces. Fund your account: Before you can trade crypto, you\u2019ll need a way to pay for your purchases, such as a linked bank account, a wire transfer or a debit or credit card payment. Place your cryptocurrency order: Select the cryptocurrency you want to buy and indicate how many coins you want to purchase. To purchase fractional shares of cryptocurrency, specify a dollar amount instead of the number of coins.\n\nFinal Take To GO\n\nDespite the crypto market being highly volatile, many investors remain on the lookout for the next big payoff. In the crypto space, big crypto risks can come with big crypto rewards. No matter how you feel about the nuances of investing in crypto such as blockchain technology, decentralized applications, smart contracts or even just meme coins, it\u2019s good to familiarize yourself with the territory and stay on the lookout for the next big cryptocurrency.\n\nFAQ Here are the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions regarding the next big cryptocurrency. Which crypto will explode in 2023? To navigate which crypto will explode soon, you need to first analyze the profit and gains of that asset. When trying to identify the next big cryptocurrency, two things to keep an eye on are similar to what a stock investor would keep an eye on: market capitalization and price. Market cap shows how much has been invested in a specific network. As a general rule, the larger the market cap, the more stable the asset, though it also means the coin has less room to grow. It's also important to keep an eye on the price to determine whether investors are bullish or bearish on the cryptocurrency.\n\nWhat's the next big crypto to invest in 2023? Here are some cryptocurrencies to keep in mind and possibly invest in for 2023: Ethereum (ETH) Binance Coin (BNB) Tether (USDT) Decentraland (MANA) Algorand (ALGO) Render Token (RNDR)\n\nWhat is the next big cryptocurrency in 2024? Here are a few metrics to help you analyze what the next big cryptocurrency will be in 2024 or 2025: Volatility: The less volatile the price, the better for the crypto's value to remain stable. 24-hour volume: The total dollar value of all transactions over the past 24 hours can help you determine a coin's liquidity. Supply: As bitcoin's meteoric rise attests, scarcity can drive demand and prices. Increasing or infinite supply can have a dampening effect.\n\nHere are the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions regarding the next big cryptocurrency.\n\nDaria Uhlig and Caitlyn Moorhead contributed to the reporting for this article.\n\nData is accurate as of Nov. 1, 2023, and is subject to change."

To sustain its bullish momentum, Bitcoin will need to surpass the $34,700 resistance level, failing which it may find support near $34,000. Interestingly, today marks the 15th anniversary of the Bitcoin whitepaper's release, a milestone that coincides with Bitcoin's remarkable 108 percent price increase since the commencement of 2023. Ethereum, on the other hand, has been trading around $1800.\u201d\n\nParth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures, said, \u201cThe crypto market has slightly pushed up in the last 24 hours, with global crypto M.Cap. rising by 0.5 percent to continue being above $1.3 trillion. The top 40 cryptos by M.Cap. seem to be in the green. BTC (+0.2 percent) seems to be consolidating within a short range of $34,000-$34,800. However, given its recent price rally, short-term BTC holders (less than 155 days) are participating in one of the strongest profit-taking events in the past couple of years. Considering the macro conditions unfolding, investors are hopeful to see a bullish trend take over.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cMeme coins, notably PepeCoin, have witnessed impressive gains, doubling in value. Bitcoin, the pioneering crypto, also remains at the forefront of attention by trading near the $35,000 mark. On the other hand, Ethereum has also started its week by crossing the $1.8k mark and is maintaining its streak. This recent surge is partly attributed to growing optimism about SEC approval for the first U.S. Bitcoin ETF, potentially sparking a crypto influx.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cIn October, Bitcoin's remarkable 30 percent rise raised expectations of a long-awaited bull market in 2023. The crypto market, which held at $34,000 over the weekend, showed signs of investor greed with a Fear & Greed Index score of 72. The global crypto market capitalization reached 1, $26 trillion, up 0.85 percent in 24 hours, as positive sentiment and rising institutional interest played a pivotal role. This optimism revolves around the potential approval of the Bitcoin Spot ETF in the United States, further strengthened by the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and significant trading activity in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Institutional interest in Bitcoin is growing, with Bitcoin-focused products accounting for 73.3 percent of the market and $23.2 billion in assets under management.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cThe renewed interest in digital assets fuelled by growing number of Bitcoin ETF applications is pumping fresh capital in the digital asset market. The high possibility of Bitcoin ETF approval in the US is attracting interest from traders across the board and FOMO-driven trading is picking up pace. The open interest on Bitcoin options breached the at over $17 billion mark (as per glassnode data), exceeding the previous peak recorded during the 2021 bull run. BTC is sitting comfortably at $34,000 level while ETH is changing hands at around $1,800 mark at the time of writing.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cIn the last 24 hours, BTC has maintained its position above $34,000 mark, with ETH steadily trading at $1,800. From a technical perspective, as long as BTC remains above approximately $31,000, the market sentiment retains a bullish tone. Notably, crypto funds experienced their most substantial weekly inflow since July 2022, attracting over $326 million, as indicated by CoinShares data. Bitcoin-based funds took the lion's share, securing 90 percent of the total inflow, which amounted to $296 million.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum prices lift on ETF hopes while JPM coin\u2019s daily transactions exceed $1 billion\n\nData from CryptoCompare shows that the price of the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC) surged at the beginning of the past week, moving from around $30,600 to over $34,500 and has since shifted sideways to now remain at that level.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Ether, the second-largest digital asset by market capitalisation, moved in a similar way, starting the week off at around $1,650 and jumping to a $1,850 high before enduring a small correction to now trade at $1,815.\n\nThe prices of most digital assets surged over the week after it was revealed that BlackRock\u2019s proposed iShares spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) had been listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which provides post-trading clearing, settlement, custody, and information services for Nasdaq.\n\nIt was revealed shortly after, however, that the ETF had been listed on the DTCC\u2019s website since August. The move was nevertheless interpreted as a signal that the ETF could get approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the near future, boosting prices, to the point that BTC reached $35,919 on OKX.\n\nAs a result Bitcoin short sellers lost nearly $180 million over 24 hours, showing how strong demand for a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US appears to be. Backing that up, a recent report from crypto forensics firm Chainalysis revealed that the largest market in the cryptocurrency world is North America, with an estimated transaction volume of $1.2 trillion between July 2022 and June 2023.\n\nPer the report, North America\u2019s crypto transactions account for 24.4% of the total and are driven by institutional activity, with large transactions of over $1 million or more making up 76.9% of its total volume. Decentralised finance and centralized exchange, the report notes, share the region\u2019s on-chain activity.\n\nElliptic debunks claims of Hamas raising millions in crypto\n\nBlockchain forensics firm Elliptic has over the week clarified that the numbers that are being used to show how much crypto Hamas has raised aren\u2019t correct, noting there\u2019s little evidence showing terrorist groups are using digital assets effectively.\n\nElliptic said that Hamas started asking for Bitcoin donations in 2019, but stopped all public crypto fundraising in April. It said that Hamas was worried about the safety of donors using crypto. Per Ellitpic, only about $21,000 in crypto donations were sent to Hamas following its attack on Israel on October 7.\n\nThe possible use of cryptocurrencies by terrorist organisations gained attention earlier this month after the Wall Street Journal reported, using Elliptic data, that Hamas and other militant groups raised millions in crypto before launching its attack on Israel. The report was cited by more than 100 US lawmakers.\n\nElliptic clarified that there\u2019s no evidence suggesting \u201cthat crypto fundraising has raised anything close to this amount, and data provided by Elliptic and others has been misinterpreted.\n\nChainalysis has itself in a separate report that claims of millions of dollars in crypto being moved to fund Hamas\u2019 operations are likely to be \u201coverstated\u201d.\n\nJPMorgan moves more than $1 billion daily with its JPM coin\n\nJPM Coin, the digital asset launched by JPMorgan in 2020, is being used for over $1 billion in daily transactions, according to the company\u2019s global head of payments, Takis Georgakopoulos.\n\nGeorgakopoulos said that current payment systems are slow, especially for cross-border transactions. He also said that they separate money and information, which makes tracking and reconciling transactions difficult, and reduces the fungibility of money.\n\nMeanwhile, Charles III, King of the United Kingdom and the 14 other Commonwealth realms, has approved a bill that will help law enforcement agencies confiscate and freeze cryptocurrency that has been used for crime.\n\nIn the US, Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has argued that the Securities and Exchange Commission has overstepped its authority when it classified cryptocurrencies it listed as securities.\n\nCoinbase said in a recent court document that it wants to end the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against it. In it, the firm claimed the regulator\u2019s definition of a security was too broad and disputed that the cryptocurrencies the exchange offers were not within the SEC\u2019s authority.\n\nOver in Europe, Binance announced it will end its Visa debit card services in the European Economic Area (EEA) on December 20 over a decision from the card issuer, Contis Financial System.\n\nFrancisco Memoria is a content creator at CryptoCompare who\u2019s in love with technology and focuses on helping people see the value digital currencies have.

        "content": "In the crypto space, fortunes can be made and lost in the blink of an eye. So, it\u2019s good to keep an eye on the power players that are reshaping the landscape. In recent times, Dogecoin (DOGE), Ethereum (ETH), and Everlodge (ELDG) have been making waves. These digital assets are not only pushing the boundaries of technology but also providing innovative solutions to real-world problems. This piece will explore the growth potential of these projects.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE): Bullish Signs\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) is no longer a meme coin. It has become one of the biggest players in the crypto space. Elon Musk and other high profile figures have turned Dogecoin into more than just a joke. If the recent developments around it are any indication, Dogecoin has a very bright future.\n\n\n\nThe team behind Dogecoin is continuously working on improving its blockchain so that it can be faster and more efficient. The coin also has potential use cases outside of the internet, like tipping for example, or even funding space missions.\n\nBecause of this, experts are revealing a bullish Dogecoin price prediction. They foresee the DOGE coin trading at $0.098 within Q4 of 2023.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Options Trading Surges\n\nEthereum (ETH) has long been hailed as the pioneer of smart contracts and decentralized applications. Recent Ethereum news suggests that we could see a run that leaves investors cheering with bags full of money.\n\nOn October 30, more than 140,000 contracts were traded, predominantly involving the active buying of monthly options within the 1650/1700/1800 range, set to expire on November 24.\n\nWith experts predicting an Ethereum price surge to $2,335.71 by December 2023, it\u2019s clear that many are banking on its continued growth and relevance in the crypto space. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts know Ethereum for its strength in DeFi and NFTs. With this in mind you can see why many people are keeping their eyes peeled for the next opportunity to make money.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG): An Upcoming Market Disruptor\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) will not be your typical cryptocurrency. It will introduce a blockchain-powered solution to disrupt the real estate market. Offering fractional ownership and timeshare solutions on the blockchain, Everlodge provides a novel approach to real estate investment.\n\nBut what if we told you there was a way to buy your favorite luxury villa or vacation home without breaking the bank? Well with Everlodge it\u2019s possible. This platform combines property ownership with NFT technology and then fractionalizes them so that people can own pieces of these homes on the blockchain for as little as $100.\n\nAdditionally, the Everlodge Rewards Club is bound to generate some excitement. This innovative club will allow members to earn free nightly stays in Everlodge properties, similar to a timeshare model. Based on your tier, you can receive a fixed number of free nights per year, which can even be resold to generate a passive income.\n\nBut, this Rewards Club will only be available to ELDG native token holders. For this reason, countless individuals are rushing to this Stage 6 presale as one ELDG now costs only $0.023. Those who bought it early on are experiencing a 130% ROI. Moreover, experts predict that the price will reach $0.038 before its presale ends \u2013 excellent gains.\n\nVisit Everlodge\n\nJoin The Everlodge Community\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

This burgeoning contender is in its presale phase, yet showing potential to challenge the dominance of established giants like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nThis article delves into Everlodge\u2019s remarkable ascent, exploring whether it has what it takes to rival the market leaders\u2019 supremacy.\n\nEverlodge\u2019s innovative approach to luxury investment\n\nEverlodge is setting a new trend in the luxury real estate arena, making it possible for the average person to hold stakes in luxurious vacation properties starting at just $100. By leveraging the power of NFTs, each representing a share of a property, they are dismantling the longstanding barriers to elite real estate ventures.\n\nAll necessary legal and ownership details are carefully encrypted into the metadata of a strong smart contract. The resulting digital tokens are then segmented to allow interested investors to participate in prime real estate opportunities without spending a fortune.\n\nBut there\u2019s more. Everlodge isn\u2019t just a marketplace; it doubles as a launchpad for budding property developers. They can tap into the community, sourcing funds for their ambitious projects. It\u2019s a symbiotic setup \u2013 developers get the required capital, and users get a shot at lucrative early-bird opportunities.\n\nELDG is the primary currency in the Everlodge world. It serves as the platform\u2019s heartbeat. Holding onto ELDG tokens offers a range of benefits, such as trading discounts and reduced maintenance charges. Token staking provides an opportunity to earn a consistent monthly yield, enabling passive income.\n\nThe buzz is real. Currently, ELDG tokens are up for grabs at just $0.23 each in the sixth phase of the presale. This rate isn\u2019t here to stay, as it is set to keep rising as more people jump on board.\n\nOnce the presale ends, ELDG will debut in tier-one exchanges, potentially catapulting its value. Market whispers hint at a colossal 30x surge post the token\u2019s debut on leading exchanges.\n\nFor more information about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale you can visit their website or join their community here.\n\nEvaluating recent Bitcoin (BTC) price movements\n\nBitcoin\u2019s journey has been nothing short of a rollercoaster lately. After a promising kick-off to the year, the cryptocurrency took a surprising dip in mid-August, plummeting from $30k to a worrying sub-$25k. The price has since rebounded to the current price of $26.3K.\n\nSo, what\u2019s causing Bitcoin\u2019s fall from grace? The prevailing sentiment is a thirst for fresh liquidity in the Bitcoin market. The buzz surrounding a potential Blackrock ETF did give Bitcoin a short-lived 20% boost, but the uncertainty around the SEC\u2019s verdict has left the market in a lull.\n\nAll eyes are now on the anticipated Bitcoin halving in 2024. Historically, such events have revitalized Bitcoin\u2019s momentum, but the crypto realm remains inherently unpredictable. The consensus is growing that Bitcoin\u2019s resurgence is tied to the approval of the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF.\n\nWith whispers suggesting that an ETF decision might be pushed to 2024, several Bitcoin enthusiasts are exploring other opportunities. Many are gravitating toward the Everlodge presale, eager to secure tokens while they\u2019re still affordable.\n\nEthereum (ETH): price resistances and network activities\n\nEthereum remains a powerhouse within the DeFi arena, boasting an impressive Total Value Locked (TVL) that exceeds $20 billion across various platforms. Its foundational crypto role and robust developer resources underscore its sustained relevance.\n\nThe allure of Ethereum isn\u2019t limited to individual investors; institutional powerhouses are increasingly swayed by its capabilities, especially in the realm of smart contract development.\n\nA buzz surrounds the potential unveiling of an Ethereum-centric ETF by Blackrock, which, if realized, would catapult Ethereum into the portfolios of a broader spectrum of investors, promising significant growth.\n\nHowever, price-wise, Ethereum is wrestling with challenges. The resistance level within the $2,000 to $2,100 bracket has proven formidable. A recent slip saw Ethereum\u2019s price spiralling downwards by 15% in just one day.\n\nCoupled with this price dip, a drop in network activity and fears of substantial sell-offs have shadowed uncertainty over Ethereum\u2019s trajectory. This sentiment is underscored by a staggering 50% drop in Ethereum\u2019s TVL since its 2023 peak of $32 billion in April.\n\nAmidst this backdrop, Ethereum holders are looking over their shoulders at Everlodge, a nascent blockchain project whose potential challenges Ethereum\u2019s dominance. While Ethereum competes in a highly competitive atmosphere with other layer-1 platforms, Everlodge offers a unique product in the $280 trillion real estate market."

        "title": "TRON (TRX) Outshines Ethereum as Altcoins Surge, South Korean Investors Embrace Cryptocurrency Craze - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "Tron (TRX) continues to outperform competitor altcoins as global demand for altcoins surge significantly.\n\nSouth Korean investor\u2019s shift focus from Bitcoin to alternative digital assets, according to new reports.\n\nAltcoin season might be just around the corner, according to leading market players, and the Tron (TRX) token is unseating its competitors. Altcoin bulls are preparing for the new month, as they continue to collectively clear weekly and monthly losses. The market has seen a notable switch in positions as altcoins move from the red zone to the green zone.\n\nAssets like Tron (TRX) are unseating their competitors as they take in gains. Holding the position as the 10th most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, Tron (TRX) has outperformed Toncoin (TON), its closest competitor.\n\nAt the time of this report, Tron (TRX) is trading for $0.09508. Although the Toncoin (TON) trades at $2, TRX has surpassed the asset in weekly and monthly gains. The TRX token has increased more than 11% over the last week. TRX bulls have also sustained hourly gains of more than 4%, while TON continues to take a downward trajectory.\n\nSimilarly, TRX is attempting to go head-to-head with Ethereum (ETH), another leading altcoin. While Ether\u2019s weekly gains have surpassed that of Tron, Ether is still struggling to sustain momentum in the green zone, as weekly losses pile up.\n\nSouth Korean investors favor altcoins over Bitcoin\n\nIt is worth noting that the current upsurge in altcoins can be traced to fundamental factors. Notably, recent research revealed that South Korean cryptocurrency traders are focusing their attention on altcoins. While the apex cryptocurrency Bitcoin, has been the centre of attention for most of the year altcoins are gaining massive adoption at a global scale.\n\nAccording to a report from DeSpread Research, crypto investors in South Korea increased to 6 million this year. In a Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (KoFIU) survey, the report, was disclosed that the majority of these investors are mainly engaged in investment activities centered around centralized exchanges. As such, the influence of centralized exchanges in the Korean crypto market has become even more significant.\n\n\u201cKorean exchanges had an explosive reaction to news related to Ripple. The trading volume of the four major Korean exchanges, which recorded $27 billion in June, increased to $37 billion in July, a 37% increase from the previous month,\u201d DeSpread wrote in the report.\n\nOn the other hand, as centralized exchanges lose their appeal globally, local exchanges like Upbit record an upsurge in the demand for altcoins.\n\n\u201cThe majority of individual investors on Upbit show strong interest in altcoins with high-profit potential and tend to accept the associated high risks. This is considered one of the reasons for the high proportion of altcoin trading in the Korean market.\u201d The report added.\n\n."

        "title": "Cryptocurrencies: Solana Could Outperform Ethereum - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "A recent cryptocurrency report published by VanEck claims that the performance of SOL, Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency, could outperform ETH (Ethereum) in the coming years.\n\nHowever, this is not a precise prediction, but rather assumptions about more or less good scenarios within which the price could move.\n\nVanEck\u2019s proposed scenarios for the Ethereum and Solana cryptocurrencies\n\nVanEck\u2019s predictions relate to the performance of the SOL price over the next ten years.\n\nThey are therefore low-probability forecasts, consisting of an extremely wide range of possibilities.\n\nThe current price of Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency is around $36, having also fallen below $10 in December last year.\n\nThe worst-case scenario suggested by VanEck is that the price will fall below $10 in the next few years (9.8).\n\nHowever, as this is one of the two extremes of a very wide range, it should only be taken as a reference point.\n\nIn fact, the best case scenario would be to exceed $3,200, i.e. an increase of 10,000% from current levels.\n\nTaking an intermediate figure, we can say that VanEck sees the possibility of the SOL price rising above $1,500, but with a good chance of ending up well above or well below this figure.\n\nSolana\u2019s past\n\nIt should be noted that SOL debuted on the crypto markets in 2020 at under $0.6 and peaked at over $260 in November 2021. So from the time of its listing to its all-time high, the gains were over 40,000%.\n\nTypically, these incredible performances are very difficult to repeat, so a +10,000% from current values seems unlikely, although theoretically possible.\n\nHowever, taking the highs from $260 to $3,200 as a reference, the gain would be +1.100%, which is not at all absurd in the crypto markets in the long term.\n\nMoreover, the price of SOL seems to be well suited to the inflation of real speculative bubbles, such as the 2021 one. Suffice it to say that in July 2021, after the first big spike in early 2021, the price was below $30 and in less than four months it went up an incredible +1,000%. Within the next seven months, it went back to where it started, with the speculative bubble having completely deflated by then.\n\nThe starting price of $0.6 is probably of little use and not worth using as a reference point. Perhaps a better reference point would be the $9.8 reached in December 2020, which is probably not coincidentally the bottom identified by VanEck.\n\nThe other reference point could be $30, as the price of Solana has indeed been hovering around this level since June 2022, if we exclude the bracket below $10 opened by the FTX bankruptcy in November 2022 and closed already in January 2023.\n\nThe Solana boom\n\nIn fact, VanEck is predicting a real boom in the use of SOL.\n\nAccording to the report published yesterday, Solana could become the first blockchain to host an application with more than 100 million users. This hypothetical achievement would be a tipping point for the adoption and value of SOL, leading to a huge increase in value.\n\nAnother hypothesis is that Solana could reach a market share of just under half that of Ethereum, partly because it proposes a different model.\n\nWhile Ethereum relies heavily on decentralisation and community governance, Solana has a more pragmatic approach dedicated to scalability and speed, which could end up attracting a different type of user and developer less interested in decentralisation.\n\nCryptocurrencies: the comparison between Ethereum and Solana\n\nVanEck\u2019s idea is therefore not a direct competition between Solana and Ethereum, but rather a different approach aimed at different types of users.\n\nComparisons can only be made on price changes over time, while on a practical level these two things would not be directly comparable.\n\nOn the other hand, the price of ETH has already experienced two huge bull runs, the one in 2017 that took it from $10 to $1,200, and then the one in 2021 that took it from $600 to almost $4,900.\n\nAt this point, it is possible to imagine that the price of SOL could also go through another similar bull run, although it should be noted that, using historical highs as a reference, Ethereum\u2019s second bull run resulted in a x4 from the previous highs.\n\nShould the next bull run also lead to a x4 in the SOL price, the new high could be around $1,000.\n\nFinally, it should be mentioned that VanEck also offers an ETN on the SOL among its derivatives products."
