        "title": "3 Cryptos to Buy Before the Coming Ethereum Upgrade - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s (ETH-USD) dominance as the leading smart contract and Web 3.0 platform is facing its most significant test yet. The upcoming Deneb/Cancun upgrade could once again revolutionize interest in this token. However, it\u2019s also an upgrade that comes with some element of risk. Thus, it\u2019s wise to align your portfolio to benefit from any potential impact of this upgrade, and do so in a way that limits your downside exposure.\n\nThe main feature of this upgrade is called proto-danksharding. In plain English, this scaling solution should make Ethereum layer 2 rollups much faster and cheaper to use. For those unaware, rollups move computation and data storage off the main Ethereum chain. However, these computations still retain the underlying security and decentralization Ethereum provides.\n\nProto-danksharding allows large blobs of transaction data to be stored briefly on the main chain, just long enough for validation, before getting passed along to rollups. This eliminates the need for expensive calldata that has previously congested the Ethereum network.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile the upgrade could be a huge boost for many Web 3.0 projects built on smart contracts or reliant on transaction speeds, Web 3.0 assets remain highly speculative. As such, I only recommend allocating a small portion of your crypto portfolio to chase the upside in these tokens.\n\nWith that said, here are three cryptos to buy ahead of this major upgrade.\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD)\n\nCrypto currency etherium. ethereum coin on exchange charts. e-currency Ethereum. Ethereum price predictions\n\nSource: viktoryabov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the dominant smart contract and Web 3.0 ecosystem, Ethereum has the most to gain from its ambitious Deneb/Cancun upgrade. While the upgrade aims to solve Ethereum\u2019s nagging fee issues, Vitalik Buterin has hinted that base gas costs may still rise, keeping prices high for end users. However, developers could have a field day with greatly-improved layer-2 efficiency. This might just be enough to retain developers into Ethereum\u2019s orbit, rather than losing talent to rival chains like Solana (SOL-USD) or Avalanche (AVAX-USD).\n\nStory continues\n\nI remain adamantly bullish on Ethereum heading into the upgrade event. As a deflationary cryptocurrency, growing demand for Ethereum tokens fueled by Web3 apps should drive prices higher. And with Ethereum hosting most smart contract-based platforms, demand is likely to increase over time. Deneb/Cancun will be a definitive test of Ethereum\u2019s technical prowess and its ability to meet user needs.\n\nBeyond the upgrade, there are some promising emergent use cases that could propel Ethereum adoption. Decentralized finance (DeFi) retains strong activity, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are on the rise, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are transforming digital ownership and asset provenance, and even central banks are experimenting with the prospect of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) on Ethereum. As both a crypto asset and a decentralized network powering Web3, Ethereum remains a top long-term buy.\n\nOptimism (OP-USD)\n\nCrypto coins on a phone screen showing stats for various cryptocurrencies.. Cryptos to Buy Before the Market Swing. rising meme cryptos. altcoins\n\nSource: Chinnapong / Shutterstock\n\nAs a leading layer-2 scaling solution utilizing optimistic rollups for Ethereum, Optimism (OP-USD) checks all the boxes as a top Deneb/Cancun speculative buy. The project aims to provide faster and cheaper transactions for Ethereum dApps like decentralized exchanges, gaming platforms, and social networks.\n\nImportantly, Optimism is EVM-compatible, meaning developers can deploy existing smart contracts on Optimism with minimal effort. While the network is currently live, supporting prominent apps like Uniswap (UNI-USD), Synthetix (SNX-USD), and Chainlink (LINK-USD), wider usage has been hampered by throughput constraints. This could change in a big way once Optimism leverages proto-danksharding and blobs to enhance its rollups.\n\nOptimism offers an encouraging early sign of its upgrade readiness. Its team recently implemented the Ecotone hard fork on the Optimism Goerli test network. This hard fork trial enabled batch submission via EIP-4844 blobs, verifying that Optimism will hit the ground running with blob support on mainnet post-upgrade.\n\nWith strong fundamentals and a 25% market share of total value locked in layer-2 platforms at over $5.4 billion, Optimism looks poised to capitalize on the greater efficiency unlocked by Deneb/Cancun. As rollup activity expands, Optimism could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Ethereum\u2019s push to scale.\n\n0xGasless (0XGAS-USD)\n\nA close-up shot of the concept for a cryptocurrency exchange page. Cryptos to Sell Before a Recession\n\nSource: PixieMe / Shutterstock.com\n\n0xGasless (0XGAS-USD) is a Web 3.0 project focused squarely on expanding Ethereum\u2019s addressable market by eliminating gas fees. It\u2019s a great choice for investors seeking outsized upside from higher Ethereum transaction volumes after the upgrade.\n\nAt the core of 0xGasless\u2019 offering is support for ERC-4337 and account abstraction. This is a standard that replaces traditional externally owned accounts (EOAs) with smart contract wallets. These wallets feature built-in logic for transaction validation, authorization, and, crucially \u2013 gas payment. This shields users from managing seed phrases, paying volatile gas fees directly and losing funds to theft or mistakes.\n\n0xGasless also offers intriguing functionality that could hasten mainstream adoption. For example, users can deploy ERC-4337 smart contract wallets on the user-friendly Telegram platform. Additionally, a custom paymaster service enables gas fee payment using any ERC-20 token.\n\nProjects like 0xGasless building on account abstraction and user experience have asymmetric upside. The road to mass adoption starts by allowing users to easily access Ethereum applications without crypto\u2019s usual harsh learning curve.\n\nOn Low-Capitalization and Low-Volume Cryptocurrencies: InvestorPlace does not regularly publish commentary about cryptocurrencies that have a market capitalization less than $100 million or trade with volume less than $100,000 each day.

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to follow the strategy employed in approving spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds for spot Ethereum ETH +0.88% ETFs, starting with rejections and ultimately granting approval on the initial final deadline on May 23, according to Standard Chartered Bank.\n\n\"We expect pending applications for ETH U.S. spot ETFs to be approved on May 23, the final deadline for the first of the ETFs under consideration \u2014 the equivalent date to Jan. 10 for BTC ETFs,\" Geoffrey Kendrick, head of Standard Chartered Bank's forex and digital assets research, wrote in a report on Tuesday. \"If ETH prices perform similarly to how BTC prices performed in the lead-up to BTC ETF approval, ETH could trade as high as $4,000 by then.\"\n\nKendrick foresees the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs primarily on the grounds that the SEC has not categorized ether as a security in its legal actions against crypto companies, and the listing of ETH as a regulated futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange adds weight to this expectation.\n\n\"Grayscale also has an ETH trust that it wants to turn into an ETF, so a denial of that application would likely lead to another appeal by Grayscale,\" he said, adding that \"we see no fundamental reason for the SEC to view ETH differently than the CME already does.\"\n\nConsistently optimistic\n\nKendrick generally holds an optimistic outlook on crypto, especially regarding price trends. Earlier this month, before spot bitcoin ETFs were approved, he said those funds are expected to attract inflows of $50-100 billion this year, and as a result, the bitcoin price could rise to $100,000 by the end of the year and $200000 by the end of 2025.\n\nThe $100,000 price prediction \"still looks achievable,\" Kendrick said in today's report, adding that expected steady inflows in spot bitcoin ETFs will gradually raise the bitcoin price.\n\nBitcoin price declined after spot bitcoin ETF approvals, mainly due to outflows from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), but has since bounced back and is currently trading at around $43,540.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nKendrick said ether is less susceptible to the post-approval selling that bitcoin saw. \"The key reason for this is that the Grayscale Ethereum Trust has a smaller share of total ETH market cap than GBTC did before approval of BTC ETFs; and within that, FTX holdings are even lower,\" he noted.\n\nEthereum ETFs that include staking yields to be approved later\n\nOn May 23, Kendrick only expects simple Ethereum ETFs that replicate ether price movements to get approved, while ETFs that include staking yield rewards may be introduced later, he said.\n\n\"Both types exist in Europe; AETH [21Shares Ethereum Staking ETP] is the largest ETF that includes staking yield rewards. However, given that AETH has higher fees than ETH, staking rewards are offset by fees,\" he said.\n\nKendrick also commented on Ethereum's upcoming Dencun or Proto-Danksharding upgrade and said it would benefit the ether price. \"Overall, this upgrade should see more value captured within the ETH ecosystem as lower Layer 2 fees make ETH more competitive, and slower staking should keep staking rewards higher for longer. Both of these are positive for ETH prices,\" he concluded.\n\nAs a whole, crypto experts have been both optimistic and pessimistic that a spot ether ETF approval is on the horizon."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Nethermind client software saw a bug that pulled validators offline for four hours last week, raising concerns in the Ethereum community about client centralization.\n\nEthereum clients are software that enable users to interact with the blockchain, allowing them to send transactions and run smart contracts, for example.\n\nWhen a minority client shuts down, the penalty often involves losing ether. However, in this case, Nethermind going offline has also sparked similar concerns around what would happen if Geth, Ethereum\u2019s most popular execution client, failed as well.\n\nRead more: Coinbase confronts client diversity risk following Nethermind bug\n\nLast week, it was estimated that 84% of validators used Geth, meaning that Ethereum itself would not finalize if Geth were to go offline.\n\nMark Mackey, an Ethereum Core Developer at Sigma Prime, noted in a post on X that the reason Geth has become one of the most popular execution clients is correlated with its early mover advantage.\n\n\u201cBack in the day, we used to have 2 clients: Geth and Parity. They were roughly equal in their usage,\u201d Mackey wrote. \u201cBut then an exploit in the Parity wallet froze [500,000] ETH forever, including the vast majority of funds that were raised for the development of Polkadot.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nAfter Gavin Wood, the founder and CEO of Parity, decided to pull the plug on developing the execution client following the Parity wallet exploit, Geth became the only viable option, Mackey wrote.\n\nIn the aftermath of the recent Nethermind bug, a renewed interest in execution clients has arisen and crypto community members are now calling for client diversification.\n\nOne of the most prominent companies to respond to client diversification concerns was Coinbase Cloud, whose nodes currently solely rely on Geth.\n\nThe company noted that although Geth is the only execution layer software client that meets its technical requirements, it is also looking into other client execution layers for alternative options, with further details to be expected in February.\n\nCoinbase Cloud is not the only team to have looked into diversifying its execution client. Allnodes shared in a recent post on X that it had fully transitioned to Besu, noting that not a single one of its 23,895 validators is on Geth anymore.\n\nP2P, another proof-of-stake validator and RPC node provider, had also transitioned to using Besu. It noted in an X post that \u201cwe believe that together with the rest of the community, we can reduce GETH usage to below 66%.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Aave-Chan, a delegate platform, noted that it would be switching minority EL clients for all its ETH nodes.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be diversity maxi without putting our money where our mouth is,\u201d wrote Marc Zeller, founder of the Aave-Chan Initiative.\n\nA week following calls for client diversification, there are \u2014 as of today \u2014 an estimated 78% of validators using Geth, meaning that in just a week, around 6% of node operators had switched their execution client.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "What Is Ethereum Restaking? A Beginner's Guide - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Ethereum restaking, as proposed by the Ethereum-based middleware protocol EigenLayer, involves reusing staked ETH tokens to secure other protocols. Proponents of restaking believe it can be used to amplify trust across networks, while detractors are worried about its possible ramifications.\n\nRead on to learn what Ethereum restaking is, how it works, and the pros and cons of restaking ETH tokens.\n\nWhat Is Ethereum Restaking?\n\nBefore we can delve into restaking, we need to understand staking digital assets in PoS networks.\n\nStaking refers to network participants locking up a certain amount of cryptocurrency on-chain to secure the network in exchange for staking rewards.\n\nOn Ethereum, it means locking up 32 ETH into a validator, which acts as an economic incentive for validators to act honestly when verifying transactions. In this process, a validator commits to producing Ethereum blocks and maintains the integrity of the Ethereum network. The economic incentive for validators is earning ETH rewards.\n\nHowever, if they attempt to manipulate the network or act dishonestly, they are penalized and stand to lose their staked ETH in an act called slashing.\n\nEthereum restaking refers to simultaneously using your staked ETH to secure other protocols and earn rewards. In other words, you are depositing your already staked ether tokens in another protocol to extend the same trust generated by Ethereum\u2019s validators to the new protocol.\n\nDuring this process, your ETH will remain staked on Ethereum, and validators will continue confirming transactions, but your staking power will now expand to other protocols. Restakers will earn additional rewards for their ETH stake but will be penalized or \u201cslashed\u201d for failing to perform their staking duties.\n\nHow Does Ethereum Restaking Work?\n\nEigenLayer\n\ndeploys smart contracts on Ethereum so ETH stakers can restake their assets on external protocols. EigenLayer acts as the conduit through which you can restake your staked ETH tokens, as well as a decentralized trust marketplace for stakers looking to compound their yields.\n\nEigenLayer provides two ways to restake: native restaking or LSD restaking.\n\nNative restaking allows you to restake your ETH stake directly to EigenLayer by assigning your validator\u2019s withdrawal credentials to EigenLayer\u2019s smart contracts (EigenPod).\n\nLSD restaking is you restaking your liquid-staked tokens. You can stake ETH on liquid-staking platforms such as Lido and Rocket Pool. Liquid staking is less complicated and has a lower barrier of entry than running your Ethereum validator. You can then restake your liquid-staked tokens.\n\nEigenLayer\n\nallows you to stake Lido ETH (stETH), Rocket Pool ETH (rETH), Coinbase Staked Ether (cbETH), and more liquid staked assets.\n\nHow to Restake Ethereum\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a look at how you can restake your ETH.\n\nSet up a Web3 wallet: Get a Web3 wallet to allow you to interact with DeFi protocols and dApps. If you have already staked ETH on liquid staking platforms, you can deposit it directly into the wallet. Connect your wallet to the EigenLayer App: Navigate to app.eigenlayer.xyz and connect your wallet to the protocol. The page will display the assets supported on EigenLayer and the TVL of each locked in the smart contracts. Select a restaking option: Choose the method of restaking that works for you. If you are a validator running your node, then native restaking is optimum. Alternatively, you can select your preferred liquid staking token and input the desired amount. Confirm your transaction: Confirm your deposit on EigenLayer and in-wallet to ensure the transaction is complete.\n\nBenefits and Drawbacks of Restaking Ethereum\n\nHere, we explore several benefits and drawbacks of restaking Ethereum for validators, protocols, and developers.\n\nPros\n\nAdditional rewards: The most obvious advantage of Ethereum restaking for a validator is the ability to compound staking rewards by staking ETH on other protocols.\n\nReducing the start-up cost of new protocols: By restaking Ethereum\u2019s pool of assets, new protocols can benefit economically from Ethereum\u2019s security offerings without starting their validation services.\n\nProtocols can retain sovereignty: By building on EigenLayer, protocols will have the flexibility to customize their architecture without adhering to the rigid rules imposed on Ethereum Layer 2 chains.\n\nCons\n\nSlashing: When you stake ETH, you are exposed to slashing as an economic consequence of bad behavior. Staking amplifies the risk, and you could lose staked ETH if you engage in malicious activity on a secondary protocol.\n\nRisk to Ethereum performance: Restaking opponents fear that with Ethereum\u2019s computational power being redirected to secondary networks, there could be a computational overload on Ethereum\u2019s consensus.\n\nCentralization risks: Restaking protocols like EigenLayer may attract ETH stakers with the promise of high yields, resulting in the rise of centralized networks and a decline in individual ETH stakers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile still in its early stages, Ethereum restaking is an interesting approach to network security and validation and how users can actively contribute to both.\n\nEthereum restaking may set the precedent on how blockchain protocols incorporate the power of collective participation and pooled economic incentives to shape the future of decentralized finance."

        "content": "Ethereum price is attempting a recovery wave above the $2,240 zone. ETH could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $2,300 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum started an upside correction above the $2,200 zone.\n\nThe price is trading above $2,240 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $2,265 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair might start a steady increase if it clears the $2,300 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum Price Regains Strength\n\nEthereum price formed a base and started a recovery wave above the $2,220 resistance zone. ETH cleared the $2,240 resistance zone like Bitcoin to move into a short-term bullish zone.\n\nHowever, the bears were active near the $2,300 zone. A high was formed at $2,307 before there was a pullback. The price declined below the $2,280 level. It broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recovery wave from the $2,170 swing low to the $2,307 low.\n\nThe bulls are now active above the $2,240 support and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recovery wave from the $2,170 swing low to the $2,307 low. Recently, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $2,265 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $2,240 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the first major resistance is near the $2,280 level. The next major resistance is near $2,300, above which the price might rise and test the $2,350 resistance.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIf the bulls push the price above the $2,350 resistance, they could aim for $2,420. A clear move above the $2,420 level might start a decent increase. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $2,550 level.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,300 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,240 level.\n\nThe next key support could be the $2,220 zone. A daily close below the $2,220 support might start another major decline. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,170 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,120 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,220\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,300\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Standard Chartered Bank has projected that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will give the green light to spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by May 23, The Block reported Jan. 30, citing a research report.\n\nThis expectation mirrors the timeline and approach previously seen in the SEC\u2019s approval process for spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nEthereum\u2019s classification\n\nAccording to Geoffrey Kendrick, the head of forex and digital assets research at Standard Chartered, the approval of Ethereum ETFs seems likely given the SEC\u2019s previous stance on ETH.\n\nUnlike certain cryptocurrencies that have been classified as securities in legal actions against crypto firms, Ethereum has avoided such categorization. Additionally, ETH\u2019s presence as a regulated futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange bolsters the likelihood of approval.\n\nKendrick\u2019s predictions extend beyond mere approval, suggesting a potential spike in Ethereum\u2019s price to $4,000, akin to Bitcoin\u2019s price performance prior to its ETF approval. He noted:\n\n\u201cIf ETH prices perform similarly to how BTC prices performed in the lead-up to BTC ETF approval, ETH could trade as high as $4,000 by then.\u201d\n\nEthereum ETFs\n\nThe potential for Ethereum ETFs isn\u2019t without its nuances. Kendrick anticipates the initial approvals to focus on simple Ethereum ETFs that track the price movements of ETH. He predicted that more complex offerings, such as ETFs incorporating staking yield rewards, may emerge later, drawing on European models as a reference.\n\nFurthermore, Kendrick comments on Ethereum\u2019s impending network upgrades, like Dencun or Proto-Danksharding, viewing them as beneficial for price growth. These upgrades will enhance the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s value retention by reducing Layer 2 fees and maintaining higher staking rewards.\n\nKendrick also maintained a positive view of the broader cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin. His earlier projections anticipated a surge in the flagship cryptocurrency\u2019s price to $100,000 by year-end and a staggering $200,000 by the close of 2025, driven by inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs."

You might be familiar with names ending in .eth. These are ENS\u2019s original implementation that is akin to domain names for wallet address. Instead of remembering a long wallet address, people could use a .eth name instead. It\u2019s similar to how DNS-based domain names replace IP addresses.\n\nPeople could use real domain names in place of .eth domains for a while, but setting it up (or making changes) could be costly because of Ethereum gas fees that could be as high as 0.5 ETH.\n\nNow, a new smart contract eliminates the need for a large amount of DNSSEC proof needed to be saved to the Ethereum blockchain. Essentially, it will allow DNS records to be verified via an off-chain gateway and eliminate the gas fee.\n\nThis means you can use your real domain names in the ENS ecosystem for free.\n\nDomain name owners will need to enable DNSSEC and add a TXT record, but will no longer have to pay gas fees."

        "content": "Sei Labs is rolling out an upgrade that it hopes will attract Ethereum developers.\n\nHowever, it is not the only layer 1 competing in the crowded market.\n\nSei Labs, the company behind the layer 1 blockchain Sei, is betting on its Sei v2 upgrade to attract developers and remove barriers for those looking to deploy DeFi protocols on its blockchain.\n\nIt will allow developers to deploy protocols from Ethereum \u2014 the biggest blockchain ecosystem with over $57 billion worth of DeFi deposits \u2014 on Sei without having to reconfigure their code.\n\n\u201cGoing to a new execution environment is very risky,\u201d Sei co-founder Jay Jog told DL News. \u201cIf you don\u2019t completely understand it, and you create even one small, tiny bug, that could result in your entire smart contract getting completely drained.\u201d\n\nInvestor deposits ($) in Sei, as measured by total value locked on DefiLlama\n\nSei v2 is scheduled to go live in the first half of 2024 and will remove that risk for developers, Jog said.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nSei Labs is betting that Ethereum developers will opt to build on faster blockchains like Sei as the industry is growing more focused on interoperability, referring to the push to connect disparate blockchain ecosystems.\n\nTapping into Ethereum\n\nEthereum is currently where the vast majority of blockchain development takes place. A recent report from Electric Capital found that 71% of smart contract code was initially deployed on Ethereum.\n\nAlthough Ethereum is the birthplace for the majority of blockchain code, developers also frequently opt to deploy their projects on alternative blockchains that boast higher speeds and reduced transaction fees.\n\nBlockchains like Solana or Cardano have had a hard time attracting Ethereum developers because they use software that is incompatible with Ethereum\u2019s. Solana uses its own custom-made solution, while Cardano uses a UTXO model.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThis has created an opportunity for Sei and similar projects looking to court Ethereum devs.\n\nNeon EVM, an Ethereum-compatible layer 2 blockchain built on top of Solana, and Monad, a yet-to-be-launched blockchain, also offer Ethereum developers routes to deploy their code on a more performant blockchain without having to make alterations to it.\n\n\u2018The EVM is here to stay\u2019\n\nCurrently, blockchains fall into one of two broad categories: those that are compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine \u2014 or EVM for short \u2014 and those that are not.\n\nEVM-compatible blockchains make it easy for Ethereum developers to build on them, but many of those chains are prone to transaction congestion and high fees.\n\nWhile some EVM-compatible blockchains find a way around this using technologies like zero-knowledge proofs, such blockchains are still relatively new.\n\nOn the other hand, blockchains that use different software, like Sei and Solana, can achieve much higher transaction speeds.\n\nSei\u2019s answer to this situation is to upgrade its current architecture to make it fully compatible with Ethereum \u2014 a request that\u2019s at the top of developers\u2019 wishlist, Jog said.\n\n\u201cThe EVM is here to stay,\u201d Jog said. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily the cleanest and most elegant execution environment to be using, but it is the one that has already gotten most market share.\u201d\n\nSei currently requires developers to write their protocols using programming languages like Rust or C++. But after the Sei v2 upgrade, they will be able to use languages like Solidity and Vyper that are popular with Ethereum developers.\n\nEVM parallelisation\n\nSei already achieves high transaction speeds compared to other blockchains. To maintain these high speeds while also letting developers use the EVM, Sei is implementing a technique called EVM Parallelisation.\n\nThis allows Sei to run multiple execution environments that can simultaneously process transactions instead of having to process transactions one after the other, as most blockchains do.\n\nSei is not the only blockchain leveraging EVM Parallelisation.\n\nNeon EVM also uses EVM Parallelisation to let Ethereum developers tap into Solana.\n\nInvestors deposits ($) in Neon, as measured by total value locked on DefiLlama\n\nBut unlike Sei v2, where both EVM and non-EVM protocols will live on the same blockchain, Neon EVM is its own separate blockchain.\n\nThat means users must first bridge their assets to Neon EVM, introducing a point of friction, which hasn\u2019t prevented Neon from making inroads with Ethereum developers.\n\nStiff competition\n\nAave, the biggest lending protocol on Ethereum with over $7 billion worth of investor deposits, recently polled its token holders on whether it should deploy its v3 version to Neon EVM. The vote ended with over 83% of token holders signalling support.\n\nMonad, a soon-to-be-launched blockchain, is also promising developers EVM compatibility and fast transactions.\n\nBoasting a proprietary consensus algorithm, Monad claims it will achieve processing capabilities of up to 10,000 transactions per second upon its launch later this year.\n\nAlthough Neon EVM has a head start, the competition between these three EVM Parallelisation projects is only just beginning.\n\nSEI token price ($)\n\nSuccess isn\u2019t guaranteed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018if you build it, they will come,\u2019\u201d Jog said. \u201cBecause there\u2019s been dozens of other chains where no one has gone.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Sei Labs\u2019 focus on parallelisation, the Sei Foundation, an affiliated nonprofit that supports the Sei ecosystem, plans to launch a grants programme for those looking to develop on the Sei blockchain."

TD Cowen argued that approval is unlikely, stating:\n\n\u201c[The SEC] can eventually reject the rule change, which either will lead to a new application or litigation \u2026 Either will take another year or two to play out.\u201d\n\nIn that event, any possible spot Ethereum ETF approval is unlikely to occur until late 2025 or early 2026, the research group said.\n\nThe SEC must reach a decision on VanEck\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF application by May 23 but is not required to approve the fund. The securities agency is expected to reach a decision on similar applications at the same time.\n\nOther sources are divided on whether a May approval is likely. One Polymarket prediction market suggests 47% odds of approval, while one JP Morgan executive has suggested a 50% chance of approval. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart is slightly more optimistic and has predicted a 60% chance of approval.\n\nPolitical factors are at play\n\nTD Cowen said that its low approval expectations are based on partisan attitudes toward cryptocurrency. The research group wrote:\n\n\u201cThis is a political call. We believe there is no upside for SEC Chair Gary Gensler to approve a spot Ethereum ETF given how upset progressive Democrats were over the agency\u2019s approval of a spot bitcoin ETF earlier this month.\u201d\n\nTD Cowen noted that SEC Chair Gary Gensler, a Democrat, needs support from progressives in order to advance his agenda or potentially obtain a different government position in the event that U.S. President Joe Biden wins a second term. It suggested that approving a spot ETF would involve a \u201cneedless fight\u201d and that Gensler is likely in \u201cno hurry\u201d to approve such a fund.\n\nDemocrats broadly opposed the earlier approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, as TD Cowen observed. Within the SEC, two Democratic commissioners voted against the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF while two Republicans voted in favor of approval. Gensler voted in favor of approval in spite of his Democratic party membership and his broader concerns about cryptocurrency.\n\nOutside of the SEC, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren expressed complaints about the decision to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF on Jan. 12."

        "content": "Investment bank TD Cowen has provided a clearer timeline for when it thinks a spot Ethereum ETH +0.88% exchange-traded fund will be approved in the United States \u2014 late 2025 or early 2026. Earlier this month, the bank said the approval could come after the November 2024 election.\n\n\"We do not expect the SEC in 2024 to approve a spot Ethereum ETF,\" TD Cowen Washington Research Group, led by Jaret Seiberg, wrote in a note on Monday. \"This is a political call. We believe there is no upside for SEC Chair Gary Gensler to approve a spot Ethereum ETF given how upset progressive Democrats were over the agency's approval of a spot bitcoin ETF earlier this month.\"\n\nGensler needs the support of progressives to push forward his agenda in this election year, according to TD Cowen. Also, if Gensler pursues a different role, such as Treasury secretary, in the event of President Joe Biden winning a second term, he will still need the backing of progressives, the bank said.\n\nSo, \"there is no reason to provoke a needless fight,\" TD Cowen said. \"We say needless, as our view remains that Gensler is in no hurry to approve an Ethereum ETF as he would first like more experience with the performance of the recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs. This is consistent with his broader approach to crypto, which is to move incrementally and slowly when it comes to providing regulatory approvals or clarity.\"\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF applications\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nMore than half a dozen companies, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have applied for a spot Ethereum ETF. Last week, the SEC again postponed its decision on Grayscale Investments' proposal for a spot Ethereum ETF, following delays on other applications earlier this month.\n\nThe SEC can take its time reviewing spot Ethereum ETF applications, according to TD Cowen. \"It can eventually reject the rule change, which either will lead to a new application or litigation. Either will take another year or two to play out,\" the bank said.\n\nThe expected late 2025 or early 2026 approval deadline is possible even if Congress fails to enact broader crypto market structure legislation in 2025, TD Cowen said. Gensler's term ends in June 2026.\n\nCrypto experts have been both optimistic and pessimistic that a spot ether ETF approval is on the horizon. Some think such an approval could come as early as May \u2014 the initial deadline for approving such funds."

        "content": "On Jan. 24, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) pushed back its decision on BlackRock\u2019s proposed spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund application (ETF) a day before the deadline, citing the need for more time to review the proposed rule change. While the SEC must make a final decision on BlackRock\u2019s spot Ether (ETH) ETF decision by Aug. 7, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has predicted a final decision will be made on all pending spot Ether ETFs in May \u2014 similar to the way the SEC decided on 10 pending spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs in January.\n\nThe next day, the SEC also delayed its decision on whether to approve a spot Ether ETF from Grayscale Investments, opening the application to public comments. The SEC said it would institute proceedings to determine whether to approve or disapprove a proposed rule change allowing NYSE Arca to list and trade Grayscale Ethereum Trust shares. Opening the proposed investment vehicle to public comment will push the deadline for a decision by an additional 35 days upon publication in the Federal Register.\n\nThe SEC remains one of the most consistently anti-crypto forces in the United States. According to a report from litigation consulting firm Cornerstone Research, the number of crypto-related enforcement cases brought by the SEC in 2023 was the highest since 2013, suggesting that digital assets were a \u201ctop priority\u201d for the commission. Of the 46 enforcement actions in 2023, Cornerstone reported the SEC imposed $281 million in monetary penalties for settlements and tripled the number of administrative proceedings from 2022.\n\nFINRA believes that 70% of crypto asset public communications violate the law\n\nIn other news, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) reported that roughly 70% of crypto-related communications from a survey contained \u201cfalse, exaggerated, promissory, unwarranted or misleading\u201d claims or otherwise violated guidelines on public communications. FINRA reviewed over 500 crypto asset-related retail communications starting in November 2022. According to the regulator, it identified more than 70% of the reviewed communications that had \u201cpotential substantive violations\u201d of its rules on communications with the public.\n\nAccording to the regulator, crypto-related communications could range from a podcast to an ad spot in the Super Bowl. Violations potentially included misleading claims on crypto and misrepresenting how the protections of federal securities laws apply to digital assets. FINRA added that the targeted exam provided crypto firms with questions to consider in their public communications.\n\nContinue reading\n\nFlorida and Alaska revoke Binance.US\u2019s right to operate in their territories\n\nTroubled cryptocurrency exchange Binance.US continues to face pressure from regulators in the U.S. after the former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao\u2019s guilty plea. Regulators in Florida and Alaska have told Binance.US that the crypto exchange can no longer serve its residents. The Alaska Division of Banking and Securities reportedly denied renewing Binance.US\u2019s license in January 2024. Florida\u2019s Office of Financial Regulation has also issued an emergency suspension order against Binance.US\u2019s money transmitter license. The suspension reportedly came a week after Binance\u2019s founder and former CEO Zhao, also known as CZ, pleaded guilty to violating U.S. Anti-Money Laundering rules on Nov. 21, 2023. In late December, regulators in Arkansas, Illinois and South Dakota reportedly reached an agreement with Binance.US that would allow it to keep operating in those states. As part of that, Binance.US must make the transfer of Zhao\u2019s voting rights irreversible.\n\nContinue reading\n\nCrypto lender Abra settles with Texan regulators\n\nCrypto lending firm Abra \u2014 allegedly insolvent since March 2023 \u2014 has entered a settlement in principle with the Texas State Securities Board (TSSB). The company will return assets invested by the state\u2019s citizens. According to the document, Abra \u201cbegan winding down U.S. retail operations\u201d and will notify clients with more than $10 in their balances so they can withdraw their assets in seven days. The unclaimed assets will be converted to fiat currency and directed to remaining Texas investors.\n\nAccording to the settlement text, by the time the TSSB filed actions, Abra held $13.6 million of crypto on behalf of more than 12,000 investors in the United States. Only $1.8 million of them were owned by approximately 1,600 Texas residents. The company\u2019s X account has been silent since June 2023. Bill Barhydt confirmed the settlement, emphasizing that Abra \u201chas never (ever) frozen withdrawals for US users\u201d and \u201cvoluntarily wound down\u201d the Earn and Boost programs in 2023.\n\nContinue reading"

Moreover, the ETC price struggles to break out of its key resistance level, suggesting a bear power in the crypto space.\n\nThe ETC price traded in a closed range between $20.32 and $21.94 for a while, following which the market gained momentum and the Ethereum Classic price gained just enough momentum to break out of the resistance level.\n\nTradingView: ETC/USDT\n\nHowever, the rally was short-lived as the price faced rejection at $23.45, after which it traded sideways for a while.

        "content": "Mustafa has been writing about Blockchain and crypto since many years. He has previous trading experience and has been working in the Fintech industry since 2017.\n\nStory Highlights Analyst Benjamin Cowen predicts a potential value drop below $1,000 based on historical patterns and the ETH/BTC pair.\n\nBitcoin's performance significantly impacts Ethereum.\n\nPotential approval of Ethereum ETFs in March could boost its price, but the wait-and-see approach remains.\n\nWell, this could come as bad news for many! Benjamin Cowen, a respected analyst, has raised a red flag regarding Ethereum\u2019s future compared to Bitcoin. Widely recognized for his precise predictions, Cowen recently shared crucial insights on YouTube, pointing towards a potential downturn in Ethereum\u2019s value.\n\nAt present, Ethereum is cautiously navigating around $2,297, reflecting a modest 0.33% dip in the last 24 hours.\n\nBut what\u2019s coming next? Read on to find out.\n\nCowen\u2019s Bearish Analysis\n\nIn a recent video, Benjamin Cowen, known for his accurate crypto predictions shared his thoughts about Ethereum (ETH), he believes that Ethereum\u2019s value might drop a lot, possibly below $1,000 before entering into a bullish period.\n\nCowen looks at how Ethereum has behaved in the past and sees a historical pattern where it usually goes down, then a bit up, and then down again. This makes him think that Ethereum might still have to go down again before things get better.\n\nKey Indicator to Focus On\n\nCowen emphasizes the importance of the ETH/BTC pair, warning that a breakdown could lead to a significant drop in Ethereum\u2019s USD value. Historical data supports this correlation.\n\nThat\u2019s why Cowen predicts that Ethereum might go back to low values below $1,000, especially if the ETH/BTC pair breaks down.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Market Analysis: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Price Prediction For This Week\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin\u2019s Impact\n\nHighlighting the symbiotic relationship between Ethereum and Bitcoin, Cowen predicts that a surge in Ethereum\u2019s value hinges on a preceding uptick in Bitcoin. The gravitational pull of Bitcoin\u2019s market dynamics significantly shapes Ethereum\u2019s journey.\n\nAcknowledging the inherent unpredictability of predictions, Cowen factors in variables such as the Ethereum spot ETF and Bitcoin halving narratives. He emphasizes the intricate nature of market dynamics, recognizing their role in shaping Ethereum\u2019s future.\n\nCould An ETF Help?\n\nWhile Cowen urges caution, optimism surrounds the prospect of Ethereum\u2019s price surge if the SEC greenlights spot Ethereum ETFs. BlackRock\u2019s extension and other major players, including VanEck, ARK 21Shares, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, Grayscale, and Hashdex, submitting ETF proposals, with decisions looming by March 10 and deadlines ranging from May to July, add layers of anticipation.\n\nRead More: Approval for Ethereum ETFs Coming Soon? Key Challenges You Should Know\n\nAs Ethereum stands at a crossroads, Cowen\u2019s insights raise crucial questions about its future trajectory. Will Ethereum weather the storm, or will regulatory decisions reshape its path? We\u2019re all waiting and watching."

        "title": "Why Solana Beats Ethereum In This Bull Cycle: Crypto Expert - NewsBTC",
        "content": "In a recent analysis, Andrew Kang, co-founder and partner of Mechanism Capital, provided a comprehensive analysis of the cryptocurrency market, focusing on the comparative strengths of Solana (SOL) over Ethereum (ETH) in the current bull cycle. Kang shared his insights via X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.\n\nCentral to Kang\u2019s argument is the idea that in the current market, Solana presents a more favorable trading option than Ethereum. He states, \u201cThe definition of insanity is repeatedly trying to long ETHBTC when longing SOLBTC (or SOLETH) is the much better trade in a bullish environment.\u201d This succinctly captures his perspective on the shifting dynamics between these major cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhy Solana Is The Superior Trade Than Ethereum\n\nKang offers a retrospective view of Ethereum\u2019s journey, noting, \u201cOver the first 6-7 years of ETH\u2019s life, there was a lot of uncertainty and lack of education around ETH. There were a lot of Bitcoin holders to be converted to Ethereum holders.\u201d He recognizes Ethereum\u2019s early volatility and its eventual emergence as a stable trading asset.\n\nHowever, he suggests that this relative stability has now become a double-edged sword: \u201cETH also became a \u2018safe\u2019 risk-on asset that traders could get into in size. That\u2019s what made it a great cross to trade. But over time, people\u2019s allocation to eth vs btc started to harden and the amount of people left to convert whittled away.\u201d\n\nAddressing Ethereum\u2019s advancements in technology, Kang points out a paradox. He states, \u201cWhile these [Layer 2 solutions and Modular technology] might seem like good things, it is these characteristics/innovations that weighs heavy on ETH during risk on periods where ETH previously outperformed.\u201d He suggests that these developments, though innovative, have introduced new complexities that impact Ethereum\u2019s performance in bull markets.\n\n\u201cYes, you may have some conversion from BTC to ETH during risk on periods (much less so these days), but in this era ETH faces much more rotational pressure from those going from ETH as their base asset to these very L2s, modularity coins, SOL, those capitulating ETHBTC longs, and other shitcoins that it is supposed to benefit from,\u201d Kang claimed.\n\nIn contrast, the crypto expert highlights Solana\u2019s advantages, asserting, \u201cNot only does SOL not face these same issues but it also has crossed the chasm in becoming a blue-chip Layer 1.\u201d He emphasizes Solana\u2019s resilience and its appeal to conservative investors who previously focused mainly on Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nKang further elucidates, \u201cConservative giants that previously were comfortable with BTC and ETH have SOL as an easy, safe next step. It is this transition phase of becoming a new major or base asset that you want to ride. A young fast horse, not a horse encumbered by the troubles of age, baggage and Jared Gray.\u201d\n\nSignificantly, Kang notes a major shift in market dynamics, stating, \u201cThere was a secular shift in the collapse of ETHBTC volatility in 2023.\u201d He posits that this shift has redefined the comparative advantage in favor of Solana. Concluding his analysis, Kang confidently asserts, \u201cEven if that ever changes, SOLBTC will be the superior trade.\u201d\n\nAt press time, SOL was just 30% short of a new all-time high against ETH.\n\nFeatured image from securities.io, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

As a reminder, Binance is currently struggling with a $4 billion fine and ongoing regulatory challenges; considering this, Buterin's focus (described in his essay entitled \"Make Ethereum Cypherpunk Again\") on security, privacy and scalability, and concern for centralized exchanges and their vulnerability to hacking, feed rumors about possible cooperation between Buterin and Binance. However, neither Buterin nor Teng made any statements in this regard.\n\nShibarium: Thousands of projects to join L2 network with numerous partnerships \u2013 SHIB rep\n\nIn a recent X post, Shiba Inu team member Lucie shared Shibarium's plans for the future . Lucie wrote that the layer-2 solution aims to \"onboard 1,000 projects with numerous partnerships,\" reminding the community that supporting new projects does not necessarily mean canceling existing ones. The SHIB representative then called on all meme token supporters to stay strong as a community during challenging times, stating that there is hardly any point in giving up now if they got \"this far\" in their support for the project's team. Lucie's post has evoked mixed reactions among SHIB army members; even though many of them praised the SHIB developers, some users questioned the project team's ability to accomplish anything more than just making plans and promising new advances.\n\nJPMorgan: Bitcoin ETF hype cooling"

        "title": "Ethereum to Surge 70% If ETF Launches in May, Standard Chartered Says - Markets Insider",
        "content": "Ethereum could reach $4,000 ahead of a likely spot ETF approval in May, Standard Chartered wrote.\n\nThe SEC will probably handle the funds' approval similarly to how the bitcoin spot ETF was approached.\n\nBut unlike bitcoin, ethereum is less at risk of price downside after the ETFs' launch.\n\nNEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business \u2014 delivered daily.

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum's price could hit $4,000 before late May, if the token is able to secure its own spot exchange traded fund, Standard Chartered said on Tuesday.\n\nHead of FX Research Geoff Kendrick wrote in a note that this will likely happen, marking a 70% price upside from ethereum's current value.\n\n\"We expect pending applications for ETH US spot ETFs to be approved on 23 May, the final deadline for the first of the ETFs under consideration \u2014 the equivalent date to 10 January for BTC ETFs,\" he said.\n\nKendrick forecasts that the process will look similar to how the Securities and Exchange Commission handled the recent bitcoin spot ETF applications, which eventually led to the launch of 11 funds after months of regulatory pushback.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn theory, ethereum should follow bitcoin's performance in the run-up to the ETFs' approval. Originally, SEC delays first caused bitcoin to flatline, before Grayscale's court victory against the regulator sent the apex token rallying at the end of 2023.\n\nEthereum has already risen around 19% since Blackrock filed for an ETF on November 16. But that's a modest gain compared to what Kendrick says could happen in May, the final deadline date for VanEck and Ark21Shares' applications.\n\nStill, to reach the $4,000 price target, some conditions will have to be met.\n\nExpectations for the approval will have to be low, as happened ahead of the bitcoin ETF launch, Kendrick said. Market-side implications for an approval will also have to miss the mark \u2014 though some may worry that the SEC's stance that ethereum should be treated as a security could get in the way, the commission has already lost that argument in court, Kendrick outlined.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, a number of ETFs must be approved at the May deadline for ethereum to enjoy a boost.\n\nWhile the crypto's pre-ETF price action should resemble that of bitcoin, it's a different story once the funds are active.\n\nThough bitcoin jumped to an intra-day high of $49,000 on the ETFs' approval, it has since slid 6.7%. The surprising downside stems from massive outflows from Grayscale's fund, which previously functioned as a bitcoin trust.\n\nBut the Grayscale Ethereum Trust accounts for a much smaller market cap of the crypto than the bitcoin fund did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Grayscale ETH Trust's current market cap of USD 6bn is 2.2% of total ETH market cap, whereas the comparable share for BTC was 3.1% at the time of the ETF approval,\" Kendrick wrote.\n\nAnd while the failed crypto exchange FTX led the Grayscale bitcoin selloff, its holdings in the Ethereum Trust amount to just 0.05% of the token's market cap."

        "content": "The bank\u2019s report also predicted ETH could hit $4,000 in the lead-up to an approval.\n\nStandard Chartered Bank is eyeing May 23 as the date for the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds, according to a report shared with the bank\u2019s clients and reviewed by Unchained.\n\nThe Block first reported the news.\n\nThe SEC is likely to take a strategy similar to the one it took for approving spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to the report. If approved, Ethereum ETFs would be the second domino to fall after the long-awaited approval of Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 10, and be a boon for an industry that has undergone a prolonged bearish period.\n\nRead more: SEC Delays Decision on BlackRock\u2019s Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nUnder a section of the report entitled \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes,\u201d Geoffrey Kendrick, head of Standard Chartered Bank\u2019s crypto research, wrote that he expects \u201cpending applications for ETH U.S. spot ETFs to be approved on May 23, the final deadline for the first of the ETFs under consideration \u2014 the equivalent date to Jan. 10 for BTC ETFs.\u201d\n\nKendrick noted that if Ether follows how Bitcoin performed in the lead-up to its ETF approval, its price could hit $4,000 by late May. Ether is currently trading at around $2,370, according to CoinGecko.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t comment on individual filings,\u201d said an SEC spokesperson when asked for comment. \u201cBroadly speaking, if the Commission declares a registration statement effective, that is reflected on EDGAR. Any Commission 19b-4 orders will be posted on our website and then published in the Federal Register.\u201d\n\nStill, the SEC postponing decisions on two ETH ETFs (BlackRock and Fidelity) on Jan. 24 follows the same pattern as its deliberative process when it came to Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe market doesn\u2019t seem to agree with Kendrick, however, with a wide range of opinions about whether Ethereum ETFs will even be approved at all.\n\n\u201cBased on market commentary, we believe approval expectations are relatively low, likely below 50%,\u201d wrote Kendrick. Yet, he believes the market is wrong in this case."

Pick one of the Ethereum online casinos from our list\n\nBegin by selecting a reputable Ethereum casino from a trusted source. Consider factors such as security, reputation, and game selection. Also, check user reviews to make an informed choice.\n\n2. Open an account\n\nVisit the chosen Ethereum casino's website and sign up for an account. Provide the required information, including a valid email address and a password. Some casinos may require additional verification steps to ensure security.\n\n3. Buy Ethereum\n\nTo fund your account, you'll need to purchase Ethereum. Use cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance or Kraken to buy Ethereum.\n\nOf course, ETH isn\u2019t the only digital currency you can use. For instance, Binance Coin casinos are widely esteemed in the market. You should always take note of the different cryptocurrencies that you can use.\n\nIt's advisable to avoid platforms that may penalize gamblers. Follow the exchange's instructions to create an account.\n\nComplete the necessary verification process, and purchase Ethereum using fiat currency or other cryptos.\n\n4. Prepare your Ethereum\n\nOnce you have obtained Ethereum, it's important to store it in a secure wallet. Choose a non-custodial or hosted wallet that provides you with full control over your funds.\n\nPopular options include hardware wallets like Ledger or software wallets like MetaMask. Follow the wallet provider's instructions to set up and secure your Ethereum wallet.\n\n5. Check your account's deposit address\n\nIn your Ethereum casino account, navigate to the deposit section. You will find a unique deposit address, which is a cryptographic code or public key.\n\nDouble-check this address to ensure accuracy. Avoid sending funds to the wrong destination.\n\n6. Deposit and start playing\n\nTransfer the desired amount of Ethereum from your wallet to the provided address. Initiate the transaction from your wallet, following the prompts.\n\nOnce the ETH is successfully transferred, it will appear in your account balance. Next, you can start playing your favorite games.\n\n7. Withdraw your winnings\n\nIf you're fortunate enough to win, you can withdraw your winnings. Navigate to the withdrawal section of your casino account, and enter the desired amount.\n\nProvide the wallet address where you want to receive your Ethereum. Review the transaction details carefully, and confirm the request.\n\nThe Ethereum will be sent to your specified wallet address. You can manage it from there.\n\nHow To Select Your Ethereum Casino\n\nWhen you choose an Ethereum casino, there are several factors to consider. Let's explore each of these aspects in detail.\n\nAvailable payment systems and cryptos for deposit\n\nLook for Ethereum casinos that offer a wide range of payment methods. The emphasis should be on cryptocurrencies to deposit. The more options available, the better it is for you.\n\nLook for casinos that explicitly state their acceptance of Ethereum or cryptocurrencies. It's also a great feature if they support other cryptos like Bitcoin or Litecoin.\n\nAdditionally, consider sites that regularly add new currencies, as you might want to diversify your deposit options.\n\nYou should stick with casinos that accept fiat payment methods alongside cryptocurrencies. Ensure that the casino supports popular and reputable payment methods.\n\nThe list should include credit/debit cards, bank transfers, and e-wallets. A wide variety of payment options increases flexibility and convenience.\n\nWithdrawal speed and limits on Ethereum casinos\n\nEthereum transactions are known for their speed. However, some sites may introduce additional validation steps. This could delay your withdrawals.\n\nEnsure that the withdrawal speed offered by the casino is at least close to what ETH allows.\n\nAlso, check the withdrawal limits imposed by the Ethereum casino. This will ensure they align with your betting preferences and financial goals.\n\nAside from this, also assess the transaction fees associated with depositing Ethereum.\n\nSome casinos may charge additional fees for cryptocurrency deposits. In fact, this should be one of the main factors in your decision-making process.\n\nConsider casinos that offer competitive or low transaction fees, as this will maximize your betting budget.\n\nGames quality, variety, and exclusivity\n\nThe quality and variety of games available at an Ethereum casino are crucial factors. Look for casinos that offer a wide selection of high-quality games.\n\nThey should come from top software providers.

Other good options are Betsoft, Evolution, and Yggdrasil, among others.\n\nYou should also be aware of the Return to Player (RTP) percentage of specific games.\n\nStick with Ethereum casinos that welcome users from your country\n\nDifferent countries have varying laws and regulations regarding online gambling.\n\nYou should select an Ethereum casino that welcomes users from your country. This ensures compliance with local laws.\n\nYou can also mitigate legal risks and enjoy better protection of your information.\n\nETH casinos that cater to specific countries tailor their platforms to users\u2019 preferences. This can result in a more localized user experience, with relevant and varied language options, and better customer support availability during the day.\n\nIn addition, you can expect region-specific promotions or bonuses.\n\nYou should always pay close attention to the casino's terms and conditions, avoiding sites with unclear wording.\n\nReputation\n\nConsider the reputation of the Ethereum casino before making your choice. Look for casinos with robust security features and appropriate licenses.\n\nCuracao licensing is a standard in the crypto space, but be aware that it can be relatively easy to get.\n\nSearch for any complaints or feedback from players to gain insights into their experiences and the reliability of the site.\n\nEngage in thorough research by reading user reviews and ratings.

Here is a little more information about specific bonuses.\n\nWelcome bonuses\n\nThese are rewards for players and a way to attract them to join the platform.

These brands not only accept crypto deposits but also allow players to use their native currency.\n\nBe cautious of casinos that only accept crypto as a deposit method. They could convert the funds into another currency, and impose additional fees and spreads.\n\nBy considering these factors when selecting an Ethereum casino, you can make an informed decision.

Here are the reasons why you should choose ETH casinos today!\n\nGeo restrictions are a thing of the past\n\nIf you opt for an Ethereum casino, you definitely have fewer geo-restrictions. This is because it operates on a decentralized blockchain and is therefore accessible to players worldwide. This allows individuals from different regions to engage in online gambling activities.\n\nOn this note, it\u2019s important to underline that online gambling regulations vary from country to country. It is unwise to try and gamble in a country where online casinos play is banned.\n\nFaster transactions, higher limits\n\nWhen you pick an Ethereum casino, you can enjoy faster payments and higher limits. Ethereum speeds up transactions, so you can add or take out money faster than with other methods.\n\nWith Ethereum, there are no middlemen or third-party processors involved.\n\nIn addition, Ethereum casinos often allow higher limits. This means you have more flexibility and can bet larger amounts.\n\nEthereum's decentralized nature helps handle financial transactions efficiently. As a result, you have higher limits for deposits and withdrawals. This is useful if you like to bet big or need the freedom to manage your transactions.\n\nYour ETH balance could increase over time\n\nOn traditional online casinos, your winnings are paid out in fiat currency. On the other hand, Ethereum casinos allow you to gamble and accumulate Ethereum cryptocurrency.\n\nThe value of Ethereum has shown significant growth over the years. This makes it a possibly promising investment.\n\nThen, when you gamble with Ethereum, you can win prizes and also profit from the growth in value of your Ethereum holdings.\n\nYet don\u2019t forget that when you use Ethereum for gambling, the value of your balance can rise or fall. It will depend on the market price of Ethereum.\n\nIf the price of Ethereum increases, your balance could also increase. As a result, you can get additional gains.\n\nBut it's important to note that this applies to Ethereum and not stablecoins because these maintain a stable value by following major currencies.\n\nEthereum casinos give you higher privacy and anonymity\n\nPlaying on Ethereum casinos offers the advantage of higher privacy and anonymity. This is certainly superior to what you find with traditional online casinos.\n\nWhen you engage in gambling activities at Ethereum casinos, you can enjoy a greater level of privacy. Indeed, your personal information is not directly linked to your transactions.\n\nInstead of providing sensitive personal details, you can use your Ethereum wallet address.\n\nAnonymous casinos provide an added layer of security so that your identity and financial information are safe from breaches or misuse.\n\nNo bank involvement\n\nBy leveraging the power of blockchain technology, Ethereum casinos offer a more private experience.\n\nAs a result, when you play at Ethereum casinos, your bank or financial partner won't know about it. Ethereum transactions are pseudonymous, and your protection is huge.\n\nWith these platforms, you have a level of anonymity that isn\u2019t possible with traditional banking methods.\n\nCutting-edge sites\n\nEthereum casinos are often at the forefront of innovation. Not only do they take full advantage of blockchain technology to create immersive experiences, but also provide seamless user journeys and visually appealing interfaces.\n\nEthereum casinos are well-made and high-tech, so you can have a good time while playing.\n\nThey also offer a better user experience and modern designs. Aside from this, their interfaces are usually mobile-friendly. All these benefits enhance convenience and accessibility for players.\n\nSome Ethereum casinos even offer dedicated mobile apps, making them similar to the top real-money mobile casinos. This makes it possible to access your favorite games on the go.\n\nThe emphasis on innovation and user-centric design ensures that you have an engaging experience.\n\nCrypto or fiat?\n\nCrypto offers a decentralized and transparent financial system that operates independently of traditional banking institutions.\n\nChoosing Ethereum allows you to embrace the world of cryptocurrencies over traditional currencies.\n\nCrypto is considered cool and new, with many enthusiasts finding the concept and technology behind cryptocurrencies exciting. You too can now become part of this growing community.\n\nCrypto gives autonomy\n\nWith Ethereum, you don't need permission from any central authority. It's a decentralized system that empowers individuals with control over their money.\n\nYou can transact freely and securely, without relying on third parties. As a result, you enjoy the freedom in managing your finances.\n\nThe Cons of Using Ethereum Casinos\n\nWhile Ethereum casinos offer numerous advantages, it's important to consider the potential disadvantages. Let's explore these drawbacks in detail.\n\nA largely unregulated sector\n\nThe Ethereum casino industry operates in a legal gray zone due to the absence of regulation. Obtaining a Curacao license is common and easy.\n\nHowever, it may not provide the same level of protection as stricter regulatory bodies. Trust in an Ethereum casino often relies on its historical reputation within the crypto space.\n\nOne of the main concerns with a largely unregulated sector is the potential for fraud and scams. Without proper regulation, it becomes easier for malicious actors to create fake casinos or crypto bookmakers.\n\nThey can also manipulate the outcomes of bets. This can lead to individuals losing their hard-earned money without any legal protection.\n\nA lack of recourse\n\nThere is also no standardized system for dispute resolution. If a user has an issue with a bet or a payout, there is no governing body or regulatory authority to turn to for assistance.\n\nThis lack of accountability can result in frustration and financial loss.\n\nAnother drawback is the risk of money laundering and illegal activities. In an unregulated environment, it becomes easier for individuals to use ETH and launder money.\n\nThe lack of KYC (Know Your Customer) protocols and identity verification makes this issue worse.\n\nTransfers irreversibility\n\nEthereum transactions are processed quickly, with low fees. Sometimes, you won\u2019t face any limits. However, one of the downsides is the irreversibility of these transactions.\n\nIt is crucial to be extremely cautious when using a deposit address. Even a small error can result in sending your Ethereum to the wrong recipient. This means that you won\u2019t be able to recover your funds.\n\nThis lack of reversibility increases the importance of due diligence and caution. Be aware that errors or fraudulent activities can result in permanent losses.\n\nLess help if you have issues\n\nSince Ethereum casinos operate outside the traditional banking system, you need to do your research carefully to choose trustworthy Ethereum casinos.\n\nReliable brands are so crucial to play on because they always prioritize customer support and fair play.\n\nAnother point to consider is that in traditional casinos, regulatory bodies enforce responsible gambling practices. They also ensure that operators adhere to strict guidelines.\n\nHowever, in the unregulated Ethereum casino, there are no such mechanisms. This could make players more vulnerable.\n\nKnowing how to use Ethereum\n\nIf you decide to play on an Ethereum casino, you need to be familiar with crypto. For instance, it\u2019s vital to know how to create and manage an Ethereum wallet and interact with smart contracts.\n\nYou\u2019ll also need to learn how to navigate decentralized applications. This technical expertise could be a challenge for individuals new to crypto.\n\nUsers should also be aware of gas fees; that is, transaction fees paid to miners for processing transactions on the network.\n\nThe fluctuating nature of gas fees can impact the overall cost of casino betting. This is why users have to stay informed and adjust their strategies accordingly.\n\nVolatility of ETH value\n\nBeing a cryptocurrency, Ethereum can fluctuate in price, which could have a direct impact on the value of bets and payouts.\n\nThe unpredictable nature of ETH's value introduces an element of risk. This is not a great thing for individuals looking for stable betting environments.\n\nThis volatility of ETH value could eventually affect the profitability of casino and crypto sports betting platforms, as operators of Ethereum betting platforms need to account for the fluctuations in ETH price.\n\nThis is especially the case when determining the odds and setting the payout ratios.\n\nWhat Sorts of Games Are Available on Ethereum Casinos?\n\nEthereum casinos offer a wide variety of games to cater to different preferences and interests. Here are some of the popular game categories you can find on Ethereum casino.s\n\nETH casino classics\n\nEthereum casinos feature classic casino games that have been enjoyed by players for decades.\n\nThese include card games like crypto blackjack and baccarat. Players can test their skills and strategies as they aim to beat the dealer.\n\nOne of the most popular classic games is blackjack. This card game of skill and strategy challenges players to beat the dealer. They need to get a hand value as close to 21.\n\nEthereum blackjack offers the same thrilling gameplay as its traditional counterpart. However, you\u2019ll enjoy added benefits such as secure transactions and transparent gameplay\u2026\n\nOther \u201cclassics\u201d include roulette, slots, and video poker.\n\nLive casino games with Ethereum\n\nEthereum casinos also offer live casino games. They provide a captivating and authentic gaming experience.\n\nPlayers can engage in real-time gameplay with professional dealers, and also have the chance to interact with other participants.\n\nNotable providers such as Evolution Gaming and Pragmatic Play offer high-quality live casino games. Some of them are live blackjack, live roulette, live baccarat, and live poker.\n\nThese games are hosted by professional dealers who conduct the gameplay. The action happens in real-time through high-quality video streaming.\n\nLive games feature various betting options and table limits and cater to players of different preferences. The availability of live games with Ethereum ensures that you can find your favorite titles.\n\nEthereum Crash games\n\nCrash games have gained popularity in the Ethereum casino space. It's a thrilling and fast-paced game that offers the opportunity for big winnings.\n\nIn Ethereum Crash Games players bet on the \"crash point\" of a rising multiplier. The multiplier starts at a certain value and continues to rise until it suddenly crashes.\n\nThe goal is to predict the point at which the multiplier will crash. You have to cash out your bet before it happens.\n\nOne benefit of Ethereum Crash gambling is the potential for substantial winnings. As the multiplier continues to rise, so do the potential rewards.\n\nOther provably fair games\n\nEthereum casinos often feature provably fair games. They use blockchain technology to ensure transparency. These games include Mines, Plinko, Dice, Hi-Lo, and others.\n\nPlayers can verify the integrity of the game outcomes. They can enjoy the excitement of these provably fair options.\n\nWhat Is the #1 Exchange for Ethereum Casinos?\n\nChoosing an exchange for Ethereum casinos requires considering several factors. Some of them are reliability, security, and fees. While there are several exchanges available, we recommend Binance as the top choice.\n\nBinance is a widely recognized and reputable exchange. It comes with a user-friendly platform and a range of features.\n\nIt has established itself as a trusted platform in the crypto space. Binance has a strong track record in terms of security and reliability.\n\nOne of the pros of using Binance for casino Ethereum is the competitive fee structure. Binance offers relatively low transaction fees.\n\nThis allows users to maximize their funds for crypto gambling purposes. It could be beneficial for frequent gamblers who want to minimize costs.\n\nAnother significant advantage of Binance is that it welcomes gamblers. This is crucial to note, as some exchanges may freeze accounts if they are used for gambling transactions.\n\nHowever, Binance has a more open approach and does not penalize users.\n\nBenefits and Drawbacks of Using Ethereum on Casinos\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that has its own native cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH). This is the primary method of value exchange within the ETH ecosystem.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the pros and cons of using it for online gambling.\n\nPros of using Ethereum on online casinos\n\nHere are a few reasons why gamblers can\u2019t get enough of ETH:\n\nFast and secure transactions: Ethereum offers fast and secure transactions and allows quick deposits and withdrawals on casinos that accept it.

        "content": "Zameer is a financial analyst and writer with a particular interest in cryptocurrency markets. He has been studying cryptocurrencies and their market behavior for several years and deeply understands the factors that affect the price of cryptocurrencies. His expertise lies in his ability to use both technical and fundamental analysis to make informed predictions about the future direction of cryptocurrency prices. He has a strong understanding of market sentiment and uses this to inform his trading decisions and price predictions.\n\nAnalyst Crypto World has opened up about the current state of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The analyst discussed the key technical indicators and potential scenarios for each cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price bounces between $37,900 and $38,500 from a crucial support level. The analyst pointed out a bearish divergence still present on the daily chart, as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has not yet broken above a descending resistance line. However, the possibility of a bullish reversal is hinted at by the potential formation of a bullish cross in the daily MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence).\n\nWhile the bearish divergence is technically active, the analyst expressed neutrality in the short term. In the immediate short term, the 2-hour Bitcoin chart displayed a breakout above resistance levels between $41,700 and $42,200. The analyst expected support in this range and warned that a confirmed break below $41,700 could lead to a potential downturn toward $39,500.\n\nEthereum\n\nThe analyst observed that Ethereum Price is still under a bearish divergence on the daily chart. Despite this, the daily MACD indicated a reduction in bearish momentum, suggesting a more neutral outlook in the short term.\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, the analyst identified a potential short-term bullish scenario, comparing the current price structure to a historical fractal. The possibility of a slight bullish relief or sideways consolidation was mentioned, with a watchful eye on potential outflows from Grayscale influencing the market.\n\nSolana\n\nThe Solana price analysis focused on the 8-hour timeframe, where the price encountered resistance around $98 to $99. The analyst pointed out potential resistance levels at $102.50 and $108 to $109. A breakout above $99 and a rejection at $102 to $103 could lead to an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern, indicating a bullish trend reversal. Support levels were identified at $91 to $92 and $83.50 to $85.50."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Prediction as BTC Spikes Up 10% and ETH Approaches $2,500 \u2013 Time to Buy?\n\nAmidst a rally that has seen Bitcoin (BTC) spike over 10%, crossing the $43,000 threshold, and Ethereum (ETH) approach the $2,500 mark, the crypto market is riding a wave of bullish momentum. This surge sparks an intense focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum price predictions as investors gauge the sustainability of this uptrend.\n\nThis remarkable uptrend is partly fueled by Grayscale\u2019s decreased Bitcoin sales, injecting a wave of optimism among investors and contributing to the positive market sentiment.\n\nAdditionally, the buoyant performance of the US stock market and Google\u2019s renewed acceptance of Bitcoin ads have further bolstered BTC prices.\n\n#Bitcoin pump as market await Fed #rate verdict.

This is a big deal because it means companies like VanEck and BlackRock can now reach more people through Google, increasing awareness and attracting more investors.\n\nThis move shows that cryptocurrencies are gaining acceptance in finance. However, there are risks, like scams.

Bull run on its way\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/YKEou4EZnw \u2014 EvanLuthra.eth (@EvanLuthra) January 30, 2024\n\nConsequently, the news of Google allowing ads for Bitcoin ETFs could positively impact BTC prices by increasing visibility and attracting more investors, fostering mainstream acceptance and potentially contributing to a price uptick.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nBitcoin\u2019s technical posture on January 30 presents a pivotal moment for traders, as evidenced by its latest chart structure. Currently, Bitcoin trades narrowly above its pivot point, marked by the green line at $42,491. This level serves as a fulcrum for the price action, with immediate resistance waiting at $42,710. Beyond that, the subsequent resistance levels are charted at $42,989 and $43,769, potentially capping upward movements. Conversely, supports are arranged below, providing a safety net at $42,491, followed by more substantial floors at $41,675 and $40,586. These levels will be crucial if Bitcoin experiences a downturn. The RSI indicator, positioned at 65, suggests that the market is approaching overbought territory but not excessively so, hinting at a tempered bullish momentum. Ethereum Price Prediction Ethereum\u2019s price action, as of the latest four-hour chart snapshot, suggests a market in cautious ascent. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $2,346.5, with the pivot point established at $2357.7, indicated by the green line. Resistance levels are delineated at $2,359.5, $2,423.1, and $2,477.2, each forming a potential ceiling for upward price movements. On the downside, immediate support is found at $2,286.3, with further cushions at $2,263.9 and the more definitive level at $2,240.6. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 57, suggesting a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment without veering into overbought territory. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $2,263.9 provides additional support, reinforcing the positive bias as the current price is hovering above this line. Observing Ethereum\u2019s chart patterns, we see a recent break above the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level, typically a bullish sign. However, the proximity to the pivot point warrants vigilance, as a drop below could quickly shift the trend."

        "title": "Analyst Anticipates Spot Ethereum ETF Approval by Late May as SEC Delays Decision on Fidelity\u2019s - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its decision on Fidelity\u2019s proposal for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) until March 5.\n\nAccording to a filing on Thursday, the SEC cited the need for additional time to evaluate the proposed rule change and the associated issues thoroughly. Fidelity had initially applied for the Fidelity Ethereum Fund in November, referencing a court ruling from the previous year that questioned the SEC\u2019s rationale for rejecting spot crypto ETFs while permitting futures-based products.\n\nNotably, the delay had been widely anticipated, with Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart expressing his expectation on X, stating, \u201cFidelity #ethereum ETF delayed just now. Completely expected. Dates that really matter are late May, in my view.\u201d Seyffart\u2019s insight suggested that the crucial decisions regarding the Fidelity Ethereum ETF will likely transpire in late May.\n\nLast week, TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg noted that they anticipate the SEC will not approve ETFs for alternative crypto tokens, including Ethereum, \u201cany time soon.\u201d The reasoning behind this cautious approach is the SEC\u2019s intention to gain experience from the recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs before extending the approval to other cryptocurrencies. He further noted that the expectation is that Ethereum and other crypto token ETFs may face a longer wait, possibly extending beyond the 2024 U.S. presidential elections scheduled for November.\n\nNotably, the SEC recently granted authorization for 11 spot bitcoin ETFs to commence trading, prompting speculation within the industry about the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF. Fidelity, entering the race for a spot Ethereum ETF alongside industry giants BlackRock and Grayscale, is thus poised to play a significant role in shaping the regulatory landscape for Ethereum-related investment products.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin highlighted the significance of the SEC approving a spot Ether ETF, citing the inefficiency of existing financial instruments compared to ETFs. He distinguished Bitcoin and Ethereum, noting that while Bitcoin serves as a store of value or collateral currency, Ethereum is a commodity that powers transactions and storage on its network.\n\nRecently, BlackRock\u2019s CEO, Larry Fink, also expressed his endorsement for spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), coming on the heels of the triumphant launch of the asset management giant\u2019s long-awaited spot Bitcoin ETF, stating he sees \u201cvalue in having an Ethereum ETF.\u201d\n\nThat said, following the latest development, investors are vigilantly monitoring potential shifts in the regulatory landscape. Notably, the approval of a spot ETH ETF could also serve as a catalyst, paving the way for approvals in the realm of other cryptocurrencies like Solana, XRP, and Cardano according to some experts."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite Ethereum's position as a frontrunner in the altcoin sector, its growth has been stunted by a bearish trend that has held a tight grip on the market in recent weeks. A closer look at the ETH chart reveals that the expected volatility spike that could catalyze a bullish reversal has yet to materialize.\n\nLayer-2 network adoption and ecosystem expansion\n\nFirst, the surge of layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism could be a catalyst for Ethereum's growth. These networks aim to enhance Ethereum's ecosystem by providing the much-needed scalability and reduced fees, potentially driving renewed interest and increased adoption of the Ethereum network.\n\nETH/USD Chart by TradingView\n\nScalability and network efficiency\n\nSecond, Ethereum's persistent scalability issues must be addressed. Despite the implementation of EIP-1559, which was anticipated to make transaction fees more predictable, the network still struggles under high demand, leading to exorbitant fees and reduced network functionality. Resolving these scalability woes is crucial, as a more efficient and cost-effective network is vital for Ethereum to retain its value and utility.\n\nIntroduction of Ethereum ETF\n\nFinally, the establishment of an Ethereum ETF would be a strong bullish signal, mirroring the impact of the Bitcoin ETF. An Ethereum ETF would pave the way for institutional investment, providing a regulated and accessible means for traditional investors to gain exposure to ETH. This could secure Ethereum's future as a mainstream financial asset and provide a stable foundation for long-term growth.\n\nLooking at the Ethereum chart, we identify a local resistance level at approximately $2433.5, a price point that has acted as a hurdle in recent trading sessions. For a bullish case to solidify, Ethereum needs to break past this resistance with conviction. Should this occur, it could signal a shift in investor sentiment and open the path to higher price levels."

Discover SCENE\n\nToken trading on Solana decentralized exchanges briefly flipped that of Ethereum exchanges in December as meme coin mania raged, and now it\u2019s happened again\u2014this time ascribed to an impending token airdrop.\n\nAs of Sunday night, rolling 24-hour trading volume on Solana-based decentralized exchanges (DEXes) topped Ethereum exchanges, according to data from DeFi Llama, with about $705 million on Solana during the span compared to $698 million on Ethereum.\n\nEthereum is back on top as of this writing, but the networks remain close: DeFi Llama shows about $742 million in Ethereum DEX trading over the last 24 hours, while Solana remains steady right around $705 million. Ethereum is well ahead in terms of seven-day volume, however, at $8.9 billion compared to less than $4.5 billion for Solana.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven so, the recent short-lived reversals show that the long-dominant Ethereum is facing increasing pressure from Solana, as the rival chain offers much cheaper and faster transactions. That was the case in December when trading on Solana meme coins like BONK and Dogwifhat (WIF) helped spike DEX volume.\n\nNow, the culprit appears to be the impending launch of JUP, the official token of the popular Solana decentralized exchange aggregator Jupiter. It\u2019s set to debut on Wednesday with nearly a million wallets eligible to claim a share of JUP tokens.\n\nAccording to data from CoinGecko, Solana trading volume on Jupiter topped that of leading Ethereum DEX Uniswap V3 late Sunday, though much like with the broader chains, those places have already swapped as of Monday morning.\n\nUniswap V3 has over $629 million worth of trading volume over the past 24 hours, while Jupiter has about $571 million in DEX trading on Solana during that span.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether any recent trading will actually factor into Jupiter airdrop eligibility, however, as the protocol took a snapshot of early users on November 2. It said that some 955,000 wallets would be eligible for the eventual drop, which is now set to take place on Wednesday. However, Jupiter has additional tokens planned for future airdrops.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJupiter\u2019s launchpad was used for last week\u2019s WEN meme coin drop as a test run ahead of the JUP drop. More than a million wallets were eligible for the WEN airdrop, though the claim only lasted until Monday morning\u2014with over 280 billion WEN left unclaimed.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDogecoin, the cryptocurrency that started as a joke but became a favorite of the masses, including Elon Musk, has recently experienced a significant breakout.\n\nAfter a period of consolidation, DOGE has broken past a critical resistance level, stirring excitement among traders and investors. The coin is currently sitting above the $0.088 mark, which previously acted as substantial resistance. If DOGE manages to maintain its position above this level, it could solidify this area as new support.\n\nA break above the $0.095 resistance could signal a continued bullish trend, potentially leading Dogecoin to test the psychological barrier of $0.10. If the momentum is sustained and market sentiment remains positive, DOGE could attempt to reach higher highs, possibly moving toward the $0.105 to $0.11 range last seen during its peak periods of trading activity.\n\nImmediate support for DOGE is now at $0.088 which, if held, could act as a springboard for further climbs. However, should Dogecoin fail to maintain this level, it might fall back to its previous support near $0.078, where buyers have historically shown interest.\n\nA scenario where DOGE's breakout continues would likely involve increased adoption news or a resurgence of interest in meme coins, potentially sparked by social media or celebrity endorsements. Such catalysts could drive demand and push DOGE past the $0.095 level, cementing its breakout status.\n\nConversely, if the breakout fails to sustain, perhaps due to broader market bearishness or fading interest, DOGE could slide back below $0.088. This would retest the resilience of the $0.078 support. A drop below this level could lead to a bearish phase, with DOGE potentially seeking lower ground.\n\nSolana shows strength\n\nDuring this market cycle, Solana has established itself as a leader. With its stable and easily scalable performance, it outpaces giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the majority of DeFi volume went to the \"Ethereum killer.\"\n\nAs the DeFi ecosystem on Solana flourishes, it is becoming a hub for innovation, blending meme culture with decentralized applications. The network's efficiency and scalability are attracting a wide array of developers.\n\nThe cryptocurrency that has been on a strong upward trajectory. Currently, Solana is testing a resistance level at approximately $100, a significant psychological and technical barrier. A convincing break above this level could signal continued bullish momentum, potentially leading to testing the next resistance zone around $108, which coincides with recent highs.\n\nOn the downside, the 50-day moving average, sitting near $93.23, is providing dynamic support. This level has been defended multiple times, indicating its importance to traders. If Solana can maintain its footing above this moving average, it would reinforce the asset's stability and could serve as a springboard for further gains.\n\nThe next crucial test for Solana will be sustaining above $100. Should it consolidate above this level, it would not be unrealistic to envision a push toward $108, or even higher, as the market reassesses Solana's value proposition in the context of a rapidly evolving DeFi and NFT landscape.\n\nFundamental Ethereum problems\n\nAs it struggles to gain momentum, Ethereum's scalability suffering and the diminishing traction of meme coins on its network are at the forefront of the bearish case for the second-biggest cryptocurrency on the market.\n\nThe network's inability to handle high transaction volumes without exorbitant fees has led to the sentiment that Ethereum is becoming \"unusable\" for the day-to-day transactions that meme coins require.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Ethereum's price analysis paints a picture of uncertainty. The asset has been struggling to maintain momentum above crucial support levels. Currently, Ethereum is wavering around the $2,250 mark, with immediate support near the $2,150 level. A break below this support could see a decline toward the $2,000 psychological barrier, which would represent a significant bearish development.\n\nLayer-2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum have emerged as potential stopgaps, offering faster and cheaper transactions. However, their adoption has been less than stellar, with many viewing these platforms as temporary fixes rather than a comprehensive solution to Ethereum's underlying scalability problems."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Prediction as BTC Surpasses $42,000 Resistance and ETH Turns Red\n\nIn the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to be the key players with their recent price movements catching the attention of investors. Bitcoin, the trailblazer of the crypto market, has recently rebounded, breaking through the $42,000 resistance level and registering a current price of $42,292. This nearly 0.50% increase in the last 24 hours coincides with the overall crypto market valuation at $1.63 trillion, despite a slight 0.15% drop.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s surge is linked to favorable stock market trends and the significant achievement of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETFs amassing over $2 billion in Assets Under Management. This bullish trend in Bitcoin\u2019s price is a focal point for price prediction analyses.\n\nOn the other side, Ethereum, the second most notable cryptocurrency, has seen a minor setback, trading at $2,269 with nearly 0.50% decline. However, the buzz around the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF, as suggested by analyst James Seyffart, signals an optimistic future for Ethereum. The approval, expected in May, could attract more investment, influencing Ethereum\u2019s price positively.\n\nMoreover, the global interest in cryptocurrencies is evident with developments like Harvest Hong Kong\u2019s application for a Bitcoin ETF and a Binance survey revealing growing crypto acceptance in Europe. These factors collectively contribute to the evolving narrative of Bitcoin and Ethereum price predictions.\n\nHarvest Hong Kong\u2019s ETF Bid: A Global Boost for Bitcoin\u2019s Value\n\n\n\nHarvest Hong Kong, a prominent Chinese fund company, has officially submitted an application for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission.\n\nThe approval of this ETF, which is poised for launch after the Lunar New Year holiday on February 10, would mark Hong Kong\u2019s first Bitcoin spot ETF. This initiative follows the successful introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, igniting worldwide interest.\n\nRachel Aguirre of BlackRock has acknowledged the impressive performance of the U.S. ETF, which has surpassed expectations. China\u2019s entry into this sector adds a significant dimension to the dynamic landscape of digital asset investments, signaling a transformation in investor preferences.\n\nThus, Harvest Hong Kong\u2019s application for a Bitcoin ETF reflects increasing global interest. Its potential approval could further elevate Bitcoin\u2019s price by attracting additional investors and reinforcing its legitimacy in mainstream financial markets.\n\nBinance Report: Rising Crypto Acceptance in Europe and Bitcoin\u2019s Prospects\n\n\n\nBinance\u2019s latest survey reveals an increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in Europe, driven by their potential for high returns, decentralization, and continuous innovation. The study indicates that 73% of Europeans hold a positive view of digital currencies, with 55% utilizing them for regular transactions. This trend aligns with the global increase in cryptocurrency ownership, which soared from 432 million in January to 580 million by December 2023.\n\nSome really positive findings from our #Binance survey across Europe. 73% of respondents were optimistic about the future of crypto & with MiCA implemented soon, there\u2019s a lot to be excited about in the region! More details from @Finbold here \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/gE3l6e5MtT \u2014 Rachel Conlan (@RachelConlan) January 25, 2024\n\nDespite a temporary decline in adoption following the FTX exchange issues in late 2022, confidence rebounded, partly due to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) approval of 11 Bitcoin ETFs. High-profile sponsorships, including Crypto.com\u2019s collaboration with the LA Lakers and OKX\u2019s partnership with Manchester City, further enhanced trust in the sector.\n\nAs a result, the optimistic sentiment in Europe, highlighted by Binance\u2019s survey, may positively impact Bitcoin\u2019s price. The growing adoption, coupled with heightened optimism and usage, could attract more investors, potentially elevating the cryptocurrency\u2019s market value.\n\nSeyffart\u2019s Forecast: Ethereum ETF Approval in May Could Elevate ETH Value\n\n\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart sees a 60% chance of a spot Ethereum ETF getting approved in May. Despite recent delays for BlackRock and Grayscale proposals, Seyffart marks May 23 as a crucial date, expecting the SEC\u2019s decision around that time. The SEC, having approved Bitcoin ETFs, is now considering proposals from BlackRock, Grayscale, Ark 21Shares, and VanEck.\n\nThe Road Ahead: A View on ETH Spot This is intended to be a deep dive into the current landscape for crypto spot ETFs generally with emphasis on ETH. Will do this in 4 parts for ease of reference. 1 \u2013 General Roadmap\n\n2 \u2013 Threshold Issue\n\n3 \u2013 BTC Spot Approval\n\n4 \u2013 ETH Analysis\n\n\ud83e\uddf5 \u2014 Scott Johnsson (@SGJohnsson) January 25, 2024\n\nSeyffart is hopeful but acknowledges the SEC\u2019s ability to delay decisions. Grayscale aims for a summer 2024 SEC decision on turning its Ethereum Trust into an ETF. As May approaches, Seyffart keeps an eye on filings, with May 23 as a key date for potential updates. Consequently, the prospect of a spot Ethereum ETF approval, highlighted by James Seyffart, could positively impact ETH price.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nAs of January 29, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC/USD) technical analysis on the 4-hour chart underscores critical price points crucial for its short-term movement. The pivot point is set at $42,161, confronting immediate resistance at $43,394. Additional resistance levels are observed at $44,372 and $45,581. In contrast, the support levels are at $40,957, $39,644, and $38,618. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reads at 70, reflecting robust buying interest that is nearing overbought territory. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is located at $40,820, providing a key support line. A significant pattern on the chart is Bitcoin\u2019s ascend past a double top near the $42,160 region. A sustained closure above this level could be indicative of a strong upward trend. Thus, Bitcoin\u2019s trend remains bullish as long as it stays above the $42,160 threshold. Ethereum Price Prediction As of January 29, Ethereum (ETH/USD) continues to hover around the $2,250 mark, demonstrating a phase of consolidation. The 4-hour chart sheds light on essential levels that are shaping Ethereum\u2019s immediate market behavior. Its pivot point is identified at $2,321, facing immediate resistance at $2,388. Further resistance levels are located at $2,476 and $2,560. Conversely, Ethereum finds its initial support level at $2,241, followed by $2,169 and $2,102. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 54, suggesting a balanced market condition. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) stands at $2,314, reflecting a close alignment with Ethereum\u2019s current price movement. Technical analysis indicates that Ethereum has achieved a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $2,313. However, a descending trendline near the $2,300 level could act as an obstacle to any potential upward progression. In summary, Ethereum\u2019s trend appears bullish above the $2,320 level. Short-term expectations include testing the resistance at $2,388, offering essential insights for traders and investors monitoring Ethereum\u2019s market trends."

        "content": "The industry is bustling with the trading of the newly introduced spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States, yet there\u2019s no equivalent for Ethereum.\n\nHowever, Jag Kooner, Bitfinex\u2019s Head of Derivatives, suggests that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF could impact the SEC\u2019s view on an Ethereum ETF, likely influenced by Ether\u2019s classification as a security or commodity.\n\nWhile speaking to CryptoPotato, Kooner highlighted that Ethereum ETFs swiftly emerged in other regions following the launch of the first Bitcoin ETF, particularly in Canada, where regulators were comfortable with the product due to the presence of a regulated futures market for ETH. This environment facilitated risk management for market makers during the creation and redemption of units.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Path to ETF Approval\n\nThe Bitfinex exec also noted SEC chairman Gary Gensler\u2019s stance, suggesting that crypto other than Bitcoin are viewed as securities, contrasting with Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart\u2019s observation that the SEC appears to regard Ethereum as a commodity, given the implicit acceptance of Ethereum futures-based ETFs.\n\nThe entry of prominent financial entities like BlackRock into the Bitcoin ETF space signaled a positive trajectory for crypto ETFs, potentially extending to Ethereum ETFs, as institutional participation often validates the market for regulators.\n\nHowever, initial attempts by Grayscale and BlackRock to convert their Ethereum trusts into ETFs faced SEC pushback, underscoring the importance of Ether\u2019s categorization. While spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen favorable trends, driven partly by GBTC\u2019s substantial investment, a similar scenario could unfold for Ethereum, according to Kooner, albeit contingent on Ether\u2019s recognition as a commodity.\n\n\u201cHowever, it must be noted that ETFs serve the purpose of bridging tradfi US investors and traders and crypto and the same could most likely not be true for other crypto assets which have not stood the test of time and established the reputation of \u201cdigital gold\u201d or a commodity as the largest crypto asset by market capitalization. An example could be the lackluster performance on the launch of futures Ethereum ETFs in comparison to futures-based Bitcoin ETFs.\u201d\n\nWhen Spot Ethereum ETF?\n\nTD Cowen, through its Washington Research Group led by Jaret Seiberg, has outlined a clearer timeline for the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF in the United States, targeting late 2025 or early 2026.\n\nDespite previous speculation that approval could occur post-November 2024 elections, the bank now anticipates a delay, stating that the SEC is unlikely to approve a fund dedicated to Ether in 2024. This decision is speculated to have been influenced by political factors, particularly the potential backlash from progressive Democrats following the recent approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF."

        "content": "According to TD Cowen, several factors, including Gensler\u2019s \u201cgo-slow\u201d approach, make spot ETH ETF approval unlikely this year.\n\nIn a recent note, investment bank TD Cowen has doubled down on its prediction that the approval of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will not happen any time soon. According to TD Cowen, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will take its time before any more approvals of this sort. The note also contains a likely timeline for the approval:\n\n\u201cWe do not expect the SEC in 2024 to approve a spot Ethereum ETF. This is a political call. We believe there is no upside for SEC Chair Gary Gensler to approve a spot Ethereum ETF given how upset progressive Democrats were over the agency\u2019s approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this month.\u201d\n\nGensler Not in a Hurry to Approve Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nLed by Jaret Seiberg, the TD Cowen Washington Research Group had previously noted that SEC Chair Gary Gensler is \u201ctaking a go-slow approach\u201d with the ETH ETF. According to the note, one of the reasons for this approach is that Gensler\u2019s tenure runs until June 2026. This gives the Chair quite a bit of time to wade through court cases and more enforcement action, instead of supporting legislation. Essentially, TD Cowen believes that \u201cGensler is in no hurry to act\u201d.\n\nAfter rejecting applications for over a decade, the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this month. Since the first application by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss\u2019 Gemini in 2013, the SEC has disapproved all proposals due to fraud concerns. Consequently, recent submissions seemed to address these concerns by including a surveillance-sharing agreement (SSA), which promotes market transparency and reduces the risk of fraud. While this contributed to the SEC\u2019s recent decision to approve, another major factor is a court ruling against the agency.\n\nGrayscale Investments had dragged the SEC to court after the Commission\u2019s 2022 refusal of the company\u2019s proposal to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF. The company accused the Commission of \u201cfailing to apply consistent treatment to similar investment vehicles\u201d. According to Grayscale, the SEC was \u201cacting arbitrarily and capriciously\u201d. After the SEC lost the case, it seemed that approval was only a matter of time.\n\nTD Cowen Believes Gensler Is Treading Carefully on ETH ETF\n\nTD Cowen writes that Gensler might be unwilling to upset progressives any further as he would need them for any agenda he intends to push this year. Also, the investment bank believes that Gensler\u2019s possible interest in other roles, such as Treasury Secretary, might not come to fruition even if President Joe Biden wins a second term if the progressives are not on his side. The note also adds that Gensler would also like to monitor the performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs before approving ETH products.\n\nSo far, more than a dozen applicants have submitted proposals for spot ETH ETFs to the SEC. Last week, the Commission delayed decisions on Grayscale\u2019s and BlackRock\u2019s applications, stating that it needed more time to consider certain uses. For Grayscale, the SEC has instituted certain proceedings, including calling for public comments on the ETF."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nCryptocurrency and artificial intelligence (AI) have been two transformative forces reshaping the digital landscape, and Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin recently delved into the potential intersections and challenges when these technologies converge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCategories of crypto and AI intersection\n\nIn a blog post released today, Buterin explored the usage of AI as a player, an interface, the rules themselves and an objective of the game. The concept of AI acting as a player within a protocol emerged as the most viable and promising intersection.\n\nButerin stressed the potential for AI to participate in systems where incentives are driven by a protocol involving human input. This approach, similar to decentralized market-based reinforcement learning with human feedback, holds the immediate promise of enhancing the efficiency of mechanisms by introducing AI as players at a micro-scale.\n\nFor the second category, where AI serves as an interface to the crypto space, Buterin warned of associated risks. While emphasizing that AIs can play a role in real-time tutoring and protecting users from errors, Buterin noted that caution is necessary when using them against malicious actors, as many machine learning models are susceptible to adversarial examples.\n\nKnown for his deep thoughts, Buterin went on to state that the third category involves blockchains, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and similar mechanisms directly calling into AIs, essentially creating \"AI judges.\" Buterin urges caution, emphasizing the need to tread carefully due to the inherent biases present in AI systems.\n\nWhile the concept is intriguing, the potential pitfalls and ethical considerations call for thorough examination and responsible deployment.\n\nStriking balance in the crypto-AI interactions\n\nAs both blockchains and AIs continue to gain power, the intersection of these technologies offers a multitude of use cases.\n\nHowever, some applications make more sense and are more robust than others. Buterin highlighted the immediate promise of use cases where the underlying mechanism remains largely unchanged, with individual players evolving into AI, allowing for effective micro-scale operation.\n\nOn the other hand, applications attempting to create a decentralized, trusted AI present more challenges. Despite their promise, the highly technical Ethereum cofounder's statement highlighted that underlying assumptions may fail, warranting careful consideration, especially in contexts with high stakes. Buterin expressed anticipation for more constructive attempts at integrating AI into these areas, hoping to ascertain which applications prove viable at scale."

        "content": "Ethereum, the cornerstone of decentralized finance and the second-largest coin by market cap, is currently trading above $2,250. To reach our Ethereum price prediction of $10,000, the price of ETH would need a 5x increase. Is this feasible in 2024? Let\u2019s analyze \ud83d\ude09\n\nIs Ethereum a Good Investment in 2024?\n\nIn 2024, Ethereum remains a strong investment option. Its position as a leader in the DeFi space and its consistent performance, despite market fluctuations, make it a viable choice for long-term investors. The potential for growth, as indicated by various chart analyses, suggests a promising future for Ethereum.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Merge was NOT Enough\n\nInterestingly, the price of ETH dropped post-Merge, an event that was technically significant but had a limited immediate impact on price. This underscores the importance of understanding market psychology and the difference between short-term trading and long-term investing in Ethereum.\n\nIs Ethereum a Good Buy?\n\nEthereum is considered a good buy, especially for those looking at long-term investments. Its robust fundamentals, coupled with a growing ecosystem, make it a standout in the crypto market. Investors should, however, be aware of market dynamics and invest wisely.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Will ETH Reach $10,000 in 2024?\n\nOur Ethereum price prediction analysis, based on charting techniques, suggests that while ETH reaching $10,000 in 2024 might be ambitious, it\u2019s not out of the realm of possibility. The key price point to watch in 2024 is $3,300, as surpassing this level could signal the start of an accelerated uptrend towards our target.\n\nEthereum price history chart in USD \u2013 coinmarketcap\n\nHowever, the $10,000 looks like a far target as this means a 5x from current prices.. Since Ethereum is strongly correlated to Bitcoin, this means that Bitcoin would reach around $200,000, which is a target beyond 2024.\n\nWhere to Buy Ethereum in 2024?\n\nEthereum can be purchased on various exchanges, with Bitget being a notable option. Bitget offers a user-friendly platform with robust security measures, making it an excellent choice for buying and trading Ethereum. Additionally, Bitget fees are one of the lowest in the market, so you won\u2019t have to worry about high fees if you trade regularly.\n\n\u2013> CLICK HERE TO BUY ETH <\u2013\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

However, it has flourished over the past decade, expanding from investments to business transactions. Its promise to create a decentralized financial system beyond the control of banks and governments has captured our attention. And one of the leading cryptocurrencies is Ethereum (ETH-USD).\n\nIn 2021, the price of a single Ethereum broke $2,000 for the first time since its inception. And the value of the cryptocurrency market hit a staggering $2.5T. ETH continued to increase and set its all-time high at $4,878.26 in November 2021 before plunging in 2022.\n\nQuestions regarding their volatility have always surrounded ETH and all the other cryptocurrencies. But in the past two years, price swings have become more predictable. Their sensitivity to macroeconomic changes has become more evident. That is why investors are starting to doubt the reliability of cryptocurrencies as an inflation hedge.\n\nNevertheless, the returns have been much higher than stocks, making them more attractive. Hence, this article will discuss ETH and assess whether or not it is an attractive investment.\n\nWhy Ethereum Is Worth the Risk\n\nETH has been one of the leading cryptocurrencies over the years. And its bullish trend is expected to continue as the bull market heats up. It has much catching up to do, given its underperformance in the fourth quarter of 2023. These are the potential drivers of its uptrend.\n\nLower inflation may give upside potential to Ethereum\n\nThe crypto market has always been seen as a potential inflation hedge. Its very high volatility could hardly be connected to macroeconomic changes. Over the past decade, price swings in the cryptocurrency market have been driven purely by market sentiments. But things have changed in the past two years, as shown by the inverse relationship between inflation and Ethereum.\n\nIn the chart below, we can see how the price of Ethereum has moved in line with inflation in the past two years.\n\nImage Source: Yahoo Finance\n\nThey have an evident inverse correlation. In fact, it started to materialize as early as the first half of 2021. ETH price increases began to slow down when inflation started to accelerate. When it exceeded 7% for the first time in many years, ETH started to decrease.\n\nIt became more evident in the first quarter of 2022 when inflation surpassed 8%. That\u2019s when the downtrend became steeper, leading to a sudden crash. When inflation peaked in the second quarter of the same year, ETH hit its lowest point, reaching $1,000.\n\nThe following months were stable for ETH as inflation started decelerating. However, the series of interest rate hikes prevented it from rebounding. But it began to recover in the first quarter of 2023 as inflation decelerated and the Fed paused rate hikes.\n\nIt had a pullback in the third quarter amid the inflation uptick. But since the fourth quarter of last year, the price uptrend resumed as inflation became stable.\n\nTo prove our point, we can derive the correlation by their Multiple R, the correlation efficient. The value of 64.4% shows a strong correlation between the two.\n\nEven better, this may also show a higher predictability of ETH. Although its potential as an inflation hedge has somewhat decreased, it may be easier to forecast its future trend. In addition, their inverse relationship indicates that ETH will keep increasing as inflation increases.\n\nAs of the recent report, inflation rose to 3.4%, but it stayed reasonable, given the holiday spending splurge. But once consumption normalizes again, inflation will keep decreasing again. In turn, the ETH price may sustain its increase. It is possible this year as inflation becomes more relaxed, and the Fed plans to make a rate cut in the second half.\n\nHigh returns\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has been notorious for its high volatility, making it risky. Yet, the volatility in the market appears to be a double-edged sword that lets traders gain from sharp price increases. Ethereum has shown a similar trend, given its evident crests and troughs.\n\nMost importantly, its general trend has been bullish over the years. Indeed, its sharp uptrend makes ETH trading viable.\n\nIf we compare Ethereum to stock price indices, we can see how it outperformed the stock market.\n\nEthereum (ETH) S&P 500 (SPX) NASDAQ Composite (IXIC) Average Annual Returns 47.00% 12.12% 16.08% Risk-Free Rate 3.99% 3.99% 3.99% Standard Deviation 88.48% 17.95% 24.00% Sharpe Ratio 0.49 0.43 0.47\n\nETH returns are higher than the main stock indices in the US market. It was about six times their average annual returns. The downside is the notable volatility of ETH, which was also about six times higher than the SPX. But if we match the risks and returns of the three using the Sharpe Ratio, ETH will still be the optimal choice.\n\nWe can also refer to the Treynor Ratio and Jensen\u2019s Alpha to confirm the results further. We used the average annual returns of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and other primary Altcoins to do this. This will be the reference value for ETH, SPX, and IXIC. ETH and SPX have betas of 0.78 and 0.72, respectively.\n\nThe direction of their price returns or simply the slope is similar to the trajectory of the reference value of BTC and other Altcoins. On the other hand, IXIC only has a beta of 0.04. Given this, we can also derive their Jensen\u2019s Alpha.\n\nEthereum (ETH) S&P 500 (SPX) NASDAQ Composite (IXIC) Average Annual Returns 47.00% 12.12% 16.08% Risk-Free Rate 3.99% 3.99% 3.99% Beta 0.78 0.72 0.04 Jensen\u2019s Alpha 0.92 0.43 0.14\n\nJensen\u2019s Alpha of 0.98 shows that Ethereum has slightly underperformed relative to the crypto market average. This value is much larger than SPX with 0.43 and IXIC with 0.14.\n\nExpanding coverage\n\nFor many years, ETH has been solely used for investments. But recently, ETH has increased its business and public sector exposure. ETH contracts are so popular today that even some government agencies in the Asia Pacific use them as payments for their services.\n\nETH is also used in many crowdfunding groups like DAOs. And now, many small businesses are becoming more open to accepting other cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin. This acceptance can capture a higher demand for ETH holdings. And given the decreasing deployment of ETH contracts, the higher demand may also add upward pressure on the price.\n\nEven better, the fact that ETH is built with blockchain technology means it can run programs on its network. This token has other purposes besides trading and payment means in the financial sector. It has attestation services, so users may cryptographically prove their credit score without showing their actual score. This service can help them apply for home loans in banks and other lending institutions. Hence, it can expand some more and capture new potential holders.\n\nRecent underperformance\n\nEthereum has a Jensen\u2019s Alpha of 0.98, showing its underperformance relative to the market. But much of it was noticed in the past year. Its trend is consistent with the market while keeping volatility relatively manageable. However, returns are below the market average.\n\nEven so, its uptrend remains evident. Also, its recent underperformance means it is relatively cheaper than Bitcoin and many other Altcoins. Although it still has to catch up with the market, it has more room to speed up its increase. It is highly possible since the crypto market is starting to heat up. Additionally, its inverse relationship with inflation may drive its price increase.\n\nValuation\n\nAs ETH started to bounce back, a bullish breakout was immediately seen using the double-bottom pattern from the first low of $1,540 to $1,566. The pattern happened again when the price dipped to $1,773 before rebounding and dipping again to $1,789.\n\nThis proved the bullish breakout of ETH. We set our resistance level at $2,200, and it was surpassed in December. We tested it again at $2,600 as the momentum continued.\n\nImage Source: Yahoo Finance\n\nThere were some dips that the recent events in the crypto market may have driven. Inflation expectations may have also contributed to it. But after moving sideways and testing the $2,200 resistance level, it went up again and exceeded our new resistance level.\n\nThe uptrend may continue as ETH catches up with the market and macroeconomic indicators become more stable. We are setting our support level at $2,200-2,250 for the bullish trend to persist. At $2,466, we keep our resistance level within $2,650-2,700. If the price dips below $2,200, it may indicate a bull trap.\n\nNonetheless, we\u2019re optimistic about its uptrend, which may also be driven by better external factors and the heating up of the market. It is logical since the inverse relationship between inflation and Ethereum remains noticeable.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nEthereum remains one of the leading cryptocurrencies despite its slight underperformance in the past few months. But it opens more avenues for its sustained uptrend as it remains relatively cheaper than many other cryptocurrencies.\n\nSo, traders must watch new macroeconomic changes closely, given the influence of inflation on the ETH price. ETH remains an attractive investment, given its high returns, reasonable valuation, and the capacity of the price to increase more."

        "content": "TD Cowen Sees Slim Chances for Spot Ethereum ETF in 2024\n\nTD Cowen doesn\u2019t expect a Spot Ethereum ETF will be approved anytime soon, citing \u201cno upside\u201d for SEC Chair Gary Gensler.\n\nFollowing Bitcoin spot fund approvals, an Ethereum spot ETF is the next expected milestone in crypto markets.\n\nOn Monday, analysts led by Jaret Seiberg said they do not expect such an ETF will be approved this year.\n\n\u201cThis is a political call,\u201d they said. \u201cWe believe there is no upside for SEC Chair Gary Gensler to approve a spot Ethereum ETF given how upset progressive Democrats were over the agency\u2019s approval of a spot bitcoin ETF earlier this month.\u201d\n\nGensler would require backing from progressive lawmakers to push his agenda forward in the upcoming election year, the analysts added. Their support would be essential if he decides to transition to another position, such as Treasury Secretary, the note said.\n\n\u201cOur view remains that Gensler is in no hurry to approve an Ethereum ETF as he would first like more experience with the performance of the recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs,\u201d it added.\n\nThey expect it might unfold over one or two years, with a decision in late 2025 or early 2026.\n\nTD Cowen also pointed to Gensler\u2019s typically cautious and gradual approach to crypto regulation.\n\nIn a statement following bitcoin ETF approvals, Gensler noted that the decision doesn\u2019t reflect the commission\u2019s views of other crypto assets.\n\n\u201cIt should in no way signal the Commission\u2019s willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities,\u201d the Chairman said.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETFs Hang in the Balance\n\n\n\nOdds for immediate approval of Ether-based spot ETF applications recently fell after the SEC\u2019s postponement of its decision on applications from Grayscale Investments and BlackRock.\n\nTheir approval would offer a more convenient and regulated avenue to invest in Ether, the second-largest crypto by market value. But the SEC\u2019s hesitation shows its careful approach.\n\nOne major concern revolves around whether Ether should be categorized as a commodity or a security. This determination has consequences for its suitability as an underlying asset for an ETF.\n\nAn ETH ETF is likely up next.

Apart from TD Cowen, many other experts are speculating about when the first approval might occur, or whether they will at all.\n\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 digital assets head Mathew McDermott is confident that they will be approved in the coming months. Deutsche Bank estimates that the SEC will make its first decision on such a fund by May 23.\n\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg\u2019s ETF Analyst, Eric Balchunas, projected a 70% likelihood of a spot Ethereum ETF being approved by May."

Analysis of a forecast that reveals the regulatory obstacles to cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum ETFs, An Approval Complicated by Political Issues\n\nIn a recent memo, analysts from the investment bank TD Cowen are pessimistic about an imminent authorization of spot Ethereum ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the US stock market regulator.\n\nTD Cowen believes that political calculations by the Democratic chairman of the SEC, Gary Gensler, will lead him to defer this sensitive decision until after 2024. The idea being not to upset the left wing of his party, which is very wary of cryptocurrency.\n\nAn Initial Rejection that Would Delay the Deadline\n\nSpecifically, TD Cowen predicts that the SEC will reject the initial applications for direct Ethereum ETFs, particularly the one filed by VanEck. Following this refusal, new files will have to be compiled by the concerned financial actors.\n\nBetween the submission of new applications, their review by the SEC, and possible legal appeals in case of rejection, TD Cowen estimates that the green light for a spot Ethereum ETF could not occur before the end of 2025, or even early 2026.\n\nA Striking Contrast with Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThis forecast sharply contrasts with the SEC\u2019s recent approval of the very first ETFs directly linked to the price of Bitcoin. Yet, Gary Gensler had also faced strong criticism over this matter from Democrats.\n\nBut with his caution regarding Ethereum, the head of the SEC seems to be learning from the Bitcoin ETF controversy. He is clearly not willing to risk another confrontation with his own party before the end of his term.\n\nThe Slow Removal of Regulatory Obstacles\n\nTD Cowen\u2019s analysis sheds light on the political and regulatory obstacles that still slow down the emergence of crypto investment products in the United States. Despite advances such as the Bitcoin ETFs, the road is long before a smooth integration of crypto-assets.\n\nThe green light for Ethereum ETFs, likely not before 2025, will be another decisive milestone. The SEC and its chairman seem, however, determined to take their time before fully opening up crypto finance to mainstream investors.\n\nAccording to TD Cowen, patience is still required before the arrival of the first Ethereum ETFs. The bank does not anticipate SEC approval before at least 2025, due to political calculations. A cautious timeline that contrasts with the recently authorized Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

The revelation came from the CEO of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Richard Teng , who shared the news on his X page.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTeng expressed his gratitude for the privilege of hosting Buterin.\n\nIt was a privilege to have @VitalikButerin visit the #Binance office!\n\n\n\nThanks for taking the time to connect and talk to our team in person \ud83d\ude4f pic.twitter.com/PYrpX0HXsQ \u2014 Richard Teng (@_RichardTeng) January 29, 2024\n\nThe impromptu meeting sparked a flurry of speculation within the crypto community, as enthusiasts and experts alike pondered the potential collaboration between these two giants of the crypto market. Notably, Binance has been grappling with heightened regulatory scrutiny in recent months, leading to the legal predicament of its former CEO, Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao.\n\nVitalik and Binance connections\n\nThis unexpected rendezvous holds significance, given Buterin and Binance's history of active collaboration, such as Buterin's contribution to the proof-of-reserves concept for centralized crypto exchanges just two years ago. Against the backdrop of Binance's $4 billion fine and ongoing regulatory challenges, the nature of the discussions between Buterin and the Binance team remains shrouded in mystery.\n\nVitalik Buterin's recent focus, as evident in his essay titled \"Make Ethereum Cypherpunk Again,\" centers on security, privacy and scalability. Notably, he addressed concerns about centralized exchanges and their vulnerability to hacking \u2014 a topic that adds fuel to the speculation of potential collaborative efforts between Buterin and Binance.\n\nAs the crypto community eagerly awaits further developments, the surprise visit has sparked intense discussions about the future direction of these industry heavyweights."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCan artificial intelligence have a meaningful crossover with crypto?\n\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin published a blog post on Tuesday exploring the intersection between two of the biggest tech trends, comparing the potential role of AI within crypto to the components of a video game.\n\nThe famous developer argued that the most viable role for the former would be \u201cas a player in a game.\u201d Some versions of this have already been popular for nearly a decade, such as when trading bots earn money through arbitrage using blockchain-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis use case has existed for a long time, even with much simpler AIs than what we have today, but ultimately it is a very real AI + crypto intersection,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe promise and challenges of crypto + AI applications:https://t.co/ds9mLnshLU \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 30, 2024\n\nThat\u2019s just one application of many more to come, however: Prediction markets such as AIOmen, for example, may well start to emerge and use AIs as their players.\n\nThanks to AI\u2019s deep knowledge base and its willingness to bid for cheap where nobody else will, bots could be the spark that allows prediction markets to gain the liquidity that they\u2019ve lacked until now.\n\nBeyond that, Vitalik claims that AI can act as an \u201cinterface to the game,\u201d helping crypto users understand the world around them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe popular crypto wallet MetaMask, for example, already uses software that warns users when they are about to interact with an apparently malicious website or dapp. Similarly, Ethereum wallet Rabby wallet simulates the consequences of a transaction which a user plans to sign, giving them a heads up on potential scams.\n\n\u201cAI could give a much richer human-friendly explanation of what kind of dapp you are participating in, the consequences of more complicated operations that you are signing, whether or not a particular token is genuine\u2026 and so on,\u201d Vitalik wrote.\n\nYet there\u2019s a major risk to this approach: If AI is baked into an open-source wallet, then that means nefarious actors can review its code to launch hacks and scams that don\u2019t trigger the wallet\u2019s AI defenses.\n\nThe open-source nature of crypto also works at odds with AI when trying to use it as \u201crules of a game\u201d\u2014like using \u201cAI judges\u201d or tapping AI to help smart contracts or DAOs make certain subjective decisions. An attacker would be free to design optimized attacks to trick the model into believing that up was down, or that cats were dogs.\n\nWhile using zero-knowledge proofs could help with the process, Buterin said that it would only add to AI\u2019s already heavy computational intensity, and potentially make it easier for whoever trains the model to corrupt it with poisoning attacks.\n\nThat said, if developers can manage to piece together a \u201ctrustworthy black-box AI,\u201d he wrote, then the use cases could extend well beyond the blockchain.\n\n\u201cI look forward to seeing more attempts at constructive use cases of AI in all of these areas, so we can see which of them are truly viable at scale,\u201d Vitalik concluded.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "News that the Polygon network is on par with Ethereum regarding growth in user adoption sent shockwaves through the crypto industry.\n\nSimilarly, Galaxy Fox, the new P2E blockchain project is an interesting one as users wait to see if $BONK can recover from its massive sell-off during the recent market downturn.\n\nPolygon Nearly Levels Up with Ethereum in User Growth\n\nRecently, data revealed that Polygon Network experienced significant growth in 2023, making it almost exactly even with Ethereum in terms of growth in user adoption. While Ethereum gained 15.4 million users last year, Polygon came within a hair\u2019s breadth by gaining about 15.24 million \u2013 a remarkable 142% increase in its user adoption since 2022.\n\nAt the start of 2023, Polygon took the lead over Ethereum in user growth by acquiring an impressive 2.8 million users. However, the momentum slowed down a bit, allowing Ethereum to take over and maintain the lead till the end of the year. Moreover, both networks experienced their peak in user growth in May 2023.\n\nThis increase in the adoption of Polygon\u2019s network shows that it is getting better at attracting users with its faster and cheaper transactions. This update also hints that Layer-2 solutions, the basis of the Polygon network, will significantly make blockchain more scalable and increasingly adaptable.\n\nAlthough Ethereum still maintains the top spot in overall blockchain performance right now, several crypto experts believe it will continue to experience intense competition from Polygon\u2019s Layer-2 scaling solution over the coming years.\n\nBonk Price Prediction: Massive Sell-off Keeps $BONK Price in the Red\n\nAfter $BONK got listed on Binance and other major crypto exchanges, it experienced an uptrend, which saw its price rise 1000% within one month. However, this rally was followed by a decline when traders began to sell their $BONK tokens massively to lock in their profits.\n\nAmong the sell-offs that triggered a decline in the price of $BONK was the one that happened on December 15, 2023. According to data from Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics platform, a trader who had earlier bought 69 billion $BONK for $0.000021 sold over 70% of its $BONK portfolio for almost a million dollars gaining about $750,000 in the process.\n\nAs a result, the $BONK price dropped by over 65%, and it dipped from its all-time high of $0.00003419 to trade at the current price of $0.00001189.\n\nGalaxy Fox Reveals Features Worthy of Outpacing Top Coins\n\nWhile $BONK experienced a price decline due to massive selling pressure, $GFOX stands out as an interesting project, though it is yet to launch.\n\nGalaxy Fox blends many opportunities that bring much interest to the industry. These opportunities are not limited to token ownership but include staking, play-to-earn (P2E), and trading NFTs.\n\nNotably, Galaxy Fox ecosystem controls an interesting Web3 endless runner game in the play-to-earn aspect, allowing investors to have fun while earning rewards in $GFOX tokens. Top players who are among the 20% of the highest-ranked will also receive rewards from the prize pool every season. Also, players can temporarily boost their in-game abilities with cool NFTs to have better chances of winning.\n\nFor investors who choose to hold their tokens in loyalty to the ecosystems, Galaxy Fox ensures they are adequately rewarded by reserving rewards for them in the platform\u2019s central hub for distributing funds called Galaxy Fox Stargate. Funds get into this hub with contributions of 2% of every transaction within the ecosystem.\n\nGalaxy Fox also runs a treasury that provides funds for community initiatives and future developments to prove how transparent and accountable it can be. Moreover, it supports a strategy called \u2018token burn\u2019 to curb possible inflation of the $GFOX. Galaxy Fox is in stage 7 of its presale, and it sells for $0.00198. Over 93% of the tokens allocated for this stage have already been sold, and the presale is expected to progress to stage 8 within the next few days, where its price will increase by 10%.\n\nWhile Polygon continues gaining adoption, many analysts predict it might outpace Ethereum at some point. Meanwhile, $BONK\u2019s recent downtrend is expected to ease once the massive token dump stops. As for $GFOX, it serves as an interesting alternative to watch.\n\nLearn more about $GFOX here:\n\nVisit Galaxy Fox | Join the Community\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

Note in the above graph how staked supply increased in January despite ETH\u2019s drop.\n\nWill depleting rewards stem the flow?\n\nWhile ETH staking has grown in popularity over the months, it has reduced the staking yields, in pursuit of which users participated in the activity in the first place.\n\nAs seen from Staking Rewards data, the annualized average reward rate dipped from 5% at the beginning of January to 3.54% as of this writing.\n\nHowever, this was expected as the rewards are inversely related to the amount of ETH deposited on the network and the number of stakers involved.\n\nIt remained to be seen if the staking rate would be sustained in the long run as the yields continue to fall.\n\nHowever, one thing was clear \u2014 ETH holders were prioritizing guaranteed, stable returns over risk-laden market trading.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nETH\u2019s perception changes drastically\n\nETH\u2019s liquid supply, which is meant for active trading, has been going downhill over the last two years, according to CryptoQuant.\n\nA rotation of capital from trading to staking implied that the second-largest cryptocurrency was being perceived as a long-term investment asset."

And as the industry matures, change inevitably comes for the industry.\n\nThe big cryptocurrency investment strategy for this year is the rise of institutional capital. With the advent of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), large financial firms can now safely deploy capital into Bitcoin with the click of a button. ETFs also allow individual investors to readily access the Bitcoin market from their tax-sheltered retirement accounts. This change opens up a new frontier for digital assets.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrypto to Buy: Bitcoin (BTC-USD)\n\nUp trend Technical graph of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) in futuristic concept, BITI ETF is a Bitcoin short fund for investors betting against Bitcoin.\n\nSource: Sittipong Phokawattana / Shutterstock.com\n\nEarlier this month, the SEC dramatically changed the cryptocurrency game. On January 11th, the SEC approved the trading of 11 different ETFs devoted to Bitcoin. Those included funds such as iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ:IBIT) and Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (NYSE:BTCO), which have attracted substantial amounts of investor capital since launching a few weeks ago.\n\nUp until January 2024, investors had much more limited access to Bitcoin on American stock exchanges. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (NYSEARCA:GBTC) was operating as a trust but could only trade on the Pink Sheets. Previously, the SEC blocked Grayscale\u2019s petition to convert itself into an ETF.\n\nNow, though, Grayscale has been able to become an ETF, and that fund conversion has ushered in the approval of all other sorts of digital asset ETFs as well. With Bitcoin being the oldest and most well-known crypto, it stands to gain the lion\u2019s share of new capital flowing into the industry.\n\nCrypto to Buy: Ethereum (ETH-USD)\n\nCrypto currency etherium. ethereum coin on exchange charts. e-currency Ethereum. Ethereum price predictions\n\nSource: viktoryabov / Shutterstock.com\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD) should be the next cryptocurrency in line to benefit from this trend. The SEC is expected to rule on whether or not it will approve Ethereum ETFs later this spring. Some analysts are hopeful this could lead to a major rally in the price of ETH.\n\nStory continues\n\nBears might contend that cryptocurrency prices initially sold off in the wake of the Bitcoin ETF approvals, which is true. However, in that case, the Grayscale Bitcoin fund already had a large sum of capital in it, and once the ETFs were approved, a large chunk of money was transferred out of that GBTC product into other funds with lower expense ratios.\n\nWith that shift largely taken care of, future inflows into the Bitcoin ETFs should be a net positive for the ecosystem and support higher prices. In any case, there is not much money in Ethereum trusts; an Ethereum ETF would tap a more unclaimed market, potentially leading to significant upside later this year.\n\nCrypto to Sell: Floki Inu (FLOKI-USD)\n\nFloki Inu price predictions. An image of a corgi wearing a horned viking helmet above text saying Floki Inu on a black background.\n\nSource: Zie Project/ShutterStock.com\n\nThere is a flip side to the cryptocurrency investment strategy centered around capturing these institutional capital flows.\n\nThe arrival of all these big-name asset managers like BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) in the ETF space is that cryptocurrency is a more serious endeavor now. And in attracting this more professional class of investors, the overall digital asset landscape changes.\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen more speculative parts of the crypto landscape, like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), lose popularity. Meme coins are likely to be another loser during this shift.\n\nTake Floki Inu (FLOKI-USD) for example. The coin is one of the various meme tokens to emerge riding off the popularity of Dogecoin (DOGE-USD). However, given Floki Inu\u2019s high transaction tax, limited visibility and minimal utility, it seems Floki Inu will not have a promising future.\n\nIn the wild west days of crypto, meme coins with little more than social media support could enjoy significant popularity. With the rise of ETFs and institutional money in crypto, however, unproven oddities such as Floki Inu are likely to fall by the wayside as the smart money concentrates in the most promising tokens and projects.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "When Will Ethereum Hit New All-Time Highs? - Investing Haven",
        "content": "Ethereum set all-time highs on November 8th, 2021. Its highest daily closing price was $4807. Will Ethereum ever again hit its former all-time highs? If so, when exactly will Ethereum hit new all-time highs?\n\nRELATED \u2013 When Will Our Forecasted Price Of $10,000 Ethereum Be Hit?\n\nIn this article, we start by reviewing Ethereum\u2019s fundamentals. We re-iterate that fundamentals are not the primary driver of price. If it were the case, then ETH should have hit ATH already in 2024, with its solid fundamentals.\n\nWe then transition to ETH price analysis, with the intention to derive an answer to the question: when exactly will ETH hit new all-time highs? In answering this question, we obviously also look at the pint IF we believe ETH will ever hit ATH again, or not.\n\nEthereum\u2019s fundamentals are supportive of new ATH\n\nEthereum is considered a groundbreaking cryptocurrency project due to several key factors.\n\nSmart Contracts and Decentralized Applications (DApps): Ethereum introduced the concept of smart contracts, self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code. This innovation enables the creation of decentralized applications (DApps) on its blockchain, opening up a wide range of possibilities beyond simple transactions.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi): Ethereum is a cornerstone of the DeFi movement, providing the infrastructure for financial services like lending, borrowing, and decentralized exchanges without the need for traditional intermediaries. This has significantly expanded financial access and inclusivity.\n\nInteroperability: Ethereum is designed to be interoperable with other blockchains, fostering collaboration and compatibility between different projects and networks.\n\nUpgrades: Ethereum has undergone various upgrades, with Ethereum 2.0 being a significant one aimed at improving scalability, security, and sustainability. These upgrades demonstrate the commitment to evolving and addressing the challenges faced by the network.\n\nCommunity and Developers: Ethereum has a vibrant and active community of developers, contributors, and users. This ecosystem has played a crucial role in the ongoing development and improvement of the platform.\n\nBefore we wrap up the year, it\u2019s time to showcase the amazing projects that received funding last quarter \u2b50\ufe0f Dive into our Allocation Update: Q3 2023 blog post to learn more!https://t.co/DZGv2q1Jw4 \u2014 EF Ecosystem Support Program (@EF_ESP) December 19, 2023\n\nEthereum fundamentals vs. ETH price\n\nA critical point to understand is that fundamental value doesn\u2019t always dictate short to medium-term price movements.\n\nThat\u2019s why fundamental analysis will never answer the question whether ETH can hit new ATH. It certainly will never be able to answer WHEN ETH can hit new ATH.\n\nThese questions can only be answered by completing fundamental analysis with thorough chart analysis.\n\nIn traditional financial markets, company performance and earnings reports can have an immediate impact on stock prices. The crypto space operates in a realm where speculative sentiment, market trends, and macroeconomic factors often take precedence.\n\nFundamental developments like technological upgrades, partnerships, or protocol enhancements may indeed enhance the long-term viability of a cryptocurrency project. However, their impact on price is frequently delayed and subject to broader market dynamics.\n\nEthereum\u2019s ATH price forecast based on fundamentals\n\nApplying this principle to Ethereum, a prime example emerges. Ethereum is a powerhouse of decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contract functionality. Despite this, Ethereum\u2019s short to medium-term price movements are heavily influenced by market sentiment, speculative trading, and crypto market momentum. This is evident in the historical performance of Ethereum. The fact of the matter is that fundamental advancements, such as the Ethereum 2.0 transition, haven\u2019t always translated to immediate price surges.\n\nStill, the recognition of Ethereum\u2019s robust fundamentals positions it as a long-term player. Our forecast of a new all-time high (ATH) in 2025 or 2026 aligns with the understanding that, over time, the market tends to reward projects with solid fundamentals as they contribute to the sustained growth and adoption of the platform. This forecast reflects a belief in Ethereum\u2019s enduring strength rather than a prediction of short-term price movements based solely on immediate fundamental developments.\n\nWill Ethereum ever set new all-time highs?\n\nThe short answer: YES, Ethereum will set new all-time highs, in the not too distant future.\n\nThere is too much momentum in markets for ETH not to hit new ATH.\n\nIn order to answer the question \u2018will ETH ever hit new ATH\u2018, we have to look at the weekly chart.\n\nIt is clear from the long term ETH chart that a long consolidation is ongoing which has some similarities with the consolidation that occurred back in 2018/2019, after ATH were hit in the last days of 2017 / first days of 2018.\n\nThe current setup on Ethereum\u2019s price chart is bullish, it\u2019s a simple as that. Only if ETH falls below $900, which is seems very unlikely to happen in the coming 2 to 3 years, will the bullish setup invalidate.\n\nMoreover, as seen, there is a very important price point that will act as the \u2018line in the sand\u2019 which is $3525.50. Once past this price point, it is a given that ETH will hit ATH.\n\nWith the bullish long term chart reversal, and the pre-requisite that ETH will clear $3525.50 sooner or later, we believe that ETH will hit ATH in the not too distant future.\n\nWhen exactly will Ethereum set new all-time highs?\n\nThe next question that comes up, given the analysis discussed before, is WHEN ETH can set new ATH?\n\nInvestors nowadays tend to set expectations very high. They not only want to know WHEN but they also want the answer to be more precise. Many will ask WHEN EXACTLY will Ethereum print new all-time highs?\n\nNobody has a crystal ball. Any answer to the ATH prediction question has to be prefaced by the underlying assumptions as well as confidence levels.\n\nWe are saying, with a high level of confidence that Ethereum will move to new ATH in 2025.\n\nThe daily ETH chart helps us tremendously to come with this forecast. The rising channel on Ethereum\u2019s chart says it all: an uptrend, though a soft one, is headed towards $3525.50. That\u2019s where Ethereum will hit big resistance. We expect $3525.50 to be hit in 2024, with a very high level of confidence.\n\nOur base case outcome is a drop after $3525.50 is hit. This should result in a consolidation and fast move to previous all-time highs at $4807 in 2025. Frankly, the chart setup confirms our thinking.\n\nOne very important note: many investors tend to mix up chart analysis with technical analysis. The problem with technical indicators is that they are lagging. They are also not able to identify price targets, mostly not.\n\nAll charts shown above are based on advanced ETH charting analysis, not ETH technicals.\n\nNew ATH in ETH: if, when, conclusion\n\nIn summary, Ethereum\u2019s journey to new all-time highs is like a puzzle where its strong foundations meet the unpredictable nature of the crypto market. While Ethereum is known for its smart contracts, DeFi features, and regular upgrades, predicting its short-term price changes involves understanding how people speculate in the crypto world.\n\nOur belief that Ethereum will reach new all-time highs in 2025 or 2026 comes from looking at both its lasting strengths and how the market is right now. We use charts to help us see where the price might go. The $3525.50 price is crucial, and when Ethereum passes that point, it\u2019s a big deal. While it\u2019s hard to say exactly when this will happen, we\u2019re quite sure it will. Our forecast is like saying we expect a big jump in 2025.\n\nAs we keep exploring the world of crypto, watching Ethereum\u2019s comeback isn\u2019t just about numbers. It is about understanding the energy and strength in this special project. When exactly Ethereum reaches new all-time highs in 2025 will be part of the natural flow of the market. We will share updates, insights, and a better understanding of the crypto world in our ongoing analysis.\n\nLooking for more promising cryptocurrencies that have much more upside potential than Ethereum?

        "title": "Crypto Analyst Delivers a $480 Billion Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction - Bankless Times",
        "content": "A crypto analyst who has been highly accurate in the past delivered a strong Ethereum price prediction on Tuesday. In a note, the Standard Chartered analyst noted that ETH price has the potential to hit $4,000 by May if the SEC gives a greenlight of an Ethereum spot ETF.\n\nStandard Chartered ETH price prediction\n\nIf the analyst is correct, it means that Ethereum will need to rise by more than 71% from the current level of $2,337. Such a move will also trigger similar moves for other Ethereum-related cryptocurrencies like Ethereum Classic (ETC), Ethereum PoW (ETHW), and Ethereum Name Service (ENS). In most cases, these coins tend to move in the same direction.\n\nMost analysts believe that the SEC will consider allowing Ethereum\u2019s ETFs by following its precedence since it recently approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, there is a big difference between BTC and ETH. The SEC views BTC as a digital commodity while it sees Ethereum as a financial security that should be regulated more.\n\nAccording to the SEC, Ethereum became a security after the merge, which connected the previous proof-of-work (PoW) network with the beacon chain. As a result, Ethereum introduced the concept of staking that enables people to earn a return for just holding the ETH coin.\n\nThe SEC believes that any asset that offers such a return should be regulated to protect holders. For example, who determines the monthly return of the coin? Therefore, it is unclear whether the SEC will approve a spot Ethereum ETF in the near term. Companies like Ark Invest and Blackrock have filed for these ETFs.\n\nAn Ethereum ETF makes sense\n\nA case for a spot Ethereum ETF can be made, especially after the approval of a Bitcoin one. For example, it is the second-biggest cryptocurrency in the world with a market cap of over $200 billion. Unlike other altcoins, Ethereum is a highly liquid coin that has been around for more than a decade. It is also held widely by many crypto investors.\n\nEthereum plays a pivotal role in the crypto industry. For example, while its network has lower transaction speeds and high costs, it powers key areas in the industry. It is the biggest part in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) industry. Some of the key Ethereum DeFi networks are Compound, Maker, Uniswap, and AAVE.\n\nEthereum also powers the gaming and NFT industry. However, the key challenge is that it is facing substantial competition from other layer 1 networks like Solana, Avalanche, and Cronos. For example, Solana is taking some market share in an industry like meme coin. Solana tokens like Wen and Bonk have become some of the most popular meme coins in the sector.\n\nThe Standard Chartered analyst has been quite successful. A few months ago, he predicted that Bitcoin price would surge to $50,000 after the ETF approval. While it did not get to $50k, it moved to over $49k and analysts expect it to bounce above $50k soon."

        "content": "Jan 30, 2024 at 08:44 // PR\n\nGuest Author Author\n\nIt\u2019s only January, but 2024 has already featured massive price actions that set many tokens back by at least a month.\n\nWith the 2023 trading year ending on a profitable note thanks to Bitcoin\u2019s ETF approval, some of the best altcoins, like Ethereum (ETH) and Avalanche (AVAX), have lost all that profit in the recent bearish events. However, there are better gains up for grabs, and all you need to do is look in the right places: Algotech (ALGT)!\n\nEthereum ETH Price Prediction: ETH Could Be In for Market-Wide Dominance in 2024\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) institutional traders want increased access to altcoins in the crypto-verse, and BlackRock and Greyscale are the latest firms to submit requests for Ethereum (ETH) ETFs to the SEC. The commission has rescheduled hearings till March as they seek more time to review the ETF petitions.\n\nWhat impact does this have on the Ethereum ETH price prediction? While everyone expected an Ethereum (ETH) bounce this year, the ETF news could blow even the most prominent Ethereum (ETH) price prediction out of proportion. Ethereum's (ETH) price is already ahead of the rest of the market, spiking back to $2,200 as it gets ready for the SEC approval.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) Ecosystem Going into the Meme Coin Business\n\nSeeing as Solana has benefitted from meme coin launches in the past month, Avalanche (AVAX) seems to be warming up to the idea of hosting memes itself. Avalanche (AVAX) Foundation launched the Culture Catalyst program in 2022 to encourage community engagement, and now they have added meme coins to the mix.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) Foundation released a statement outlining rules for the prospective coins looking to join the Culture Catalyst program, ensuring that only meme projects with real potential and a growing community like Avalanche (AVAX) are supported by the program. The AVAX price could gain some bullish returns from the meme coin incorporation since Solana\u2019s meme coin airdrops paid off in December 2023.\n\nThe AVAX price could do with a boost in the coming weeks, as Avalanche (AVAX) has lost over 35% of its value in the past month. With the Foundation\u2019s involvement, the AVAX price could turn Avalanche (AVAX) into a top crypto to buy in 2024.\n\nAlgotech (ALGT) Is Bringing the Future to Financial Trading\n\nLooking beyond Ethereum (ETH) and Avalanche (AVAX), the Algotech (ALGT) project is introducing; its software programs border on futuristic aspects, as they aim to optimize trading to offer traders smoother, safer experiences.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Can $ETH Hit $4,000 by Q1 2024? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price prediction: Over the past two weeks, the smart contract giant Ethereum has witnessed aggressive correction in its native token ETH. The coin price plunged from a $2714 high to a recent low of $2171, registering a 20% loss. However, as the broader market witnessed renewed buying pressure, the Ethereum price managed to hold its ground above $2200. As the development of ETH ETF gains attention from market participants, the Ethereum price could find an opportunity to return on a recovery trend.\n\nDuring the last week, Ethereum\u2019s price fluctuated between $2,170 and $2,265, showcasing a tug-of-war between market bears and bulls. This pattern reflects a year of robust growth for Ethereum, with a notable 54% increase in value. This resilience is further underscored by a surge in trading volume, which reached a staggering $7.15 billion, reinforcing Ethereum\u2019s position as the second-largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $271 billion, according to Coinmarketcap.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Recent Trends and Bullish Signals\n\nEthereum reached its peak value of $2,717 on January 12. Since then, it has mostly hovered around the $2,200 mark, indicative of a sideways movement in its price trend. These oscillations within a defined range suggest a mix of market strength and uncertainty. Crypto analysts are leaning towards a bullish short-term forecast for Ethereum, fueling optimism about its future performance in the market.\n\nCrypto analyst Crypto Tony has been closely monitoring Ethereum\u2019s price movements. His analysis suggests a forthcoming surge in Ethereum\u2019s market value. He notes a prevailing positive trend that could catalyze a substantial rally. According to Tony, should Ethereum maintain its crucial $2,100 support level, it may be on track for considerable financial growth.\n\nEthereum price analysis reveals a significant trend in its daily chart, marked by an ascending channel formation. This pattern has been a key indicator for investors. However, Ethereum\u2019s recent downturn has led to a break below the channel\u2019s support line. Additionally, Ethereum struggled against the resistance posed by the EMA 21 during its last uptrend, hinting at a potential short-term bearish scenario for the cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Can ETH Sustain the Bullish Momentum?\n\nThe current support level at $2,200, reinforced by various technical indicators, forms a robust support zone. If Ethereum manages to sustain above this critical level, there\u2019s potential for a bullish surge. This upward movement could target the $2,400 mark. Beyond this, sustained bullish momentum could see ETH challenging higher resistance levels, potentially reaching $3,000 and possibly escalating to $4,000 by the end of February 2024.\n\nConversely, a drop below the pivotal $2,200 support level could trigger a downward trend for Ethereum. Such a decline could steer the price toward the lower support line near $2,120. If bearish forces continue to exert pressure, Ethereum might find its next support level around $2,000, potentially leading to a market correction.\n\nThe technical indicators for Ethereum are showing promising signs, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently positioned at 48. This figure, hovering just below the neutral 50 mark, suggests that buyers hold firm ground. The daily chart for Ethereum reflects a positive trend, particularly after it surpassed its 200-day moving average and moved out of a significant descending channel.\n\nMoreover, bullish signals are reinforced by the behavior of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). The MACD line\u2019s ascent above the signal line indicates growing bullish momentum, a sentiment echoed by the rising histogram. This bullishness is further bolstered by the upward movement of the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the crossing of the 50-day SMA over the 200-day SMA. Additionally, the Chaikin Money Flow indicator, currently at 0.01, resides in the positive zone, providing further evidence of a bullish market outlook for Ethereum.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThe approval of Bitcoin ($BTC) Spot ETFs has created a new precedent for digital assets having ETF products, and the Ethereum ($ETH) ETF will happen very fast. An Ethereum Futures ETF product already uses spot price as its base, making any argument against an approval nonsensical. BlackRock knows what it is doing, and an Ether Spot will be available later this year.\n\n\n\nNow is the right time to be bullish on Ethereum and Ethereum betas- these are the top cryptos to buy right now. Betas are smaller cap tokens whose performance is linked to a leading asset. Regarding Ethereum, here are the coins to buy now: $ETH, $ARB, $SNX, $OP, and $GFOX.\n\n\n\nGalaxy Fox ($GFOX) Ethereum Presale Beta\n\nGalaxy Fox is a hybrid meme/ P2E token and is an excellent play for anybody who is bullish on GameFi, memecoins, and Ethereum. Its unique positioning in dual narratives gives it tremendous upside potential, and the protocol itself has an excellent user acquisition model.\n\n\n\nIts Web3 runner game pays out prizes to skilled players, and anybody can compete. A new dimension is added with NFTs boosting in-game stats, and the ability to earn real money is a perfect incentive for new users to enter this ecosystem. Users stay for the staking rewards, and the protocol\u2019s token burn means they are earning yield on a deflationary asset.\n\n\n\nThis ICO launching in the Ethereum ecosystem while specualtive attention is focused here could easily produce a 100X run. $GFOX is a top crypto to buy now.\n\nEthereum ($ETH) Spot ETF Loading\n\nEthereum is the next narrative trade, and investors already have the playbook. Bitcoin was at $25,000 when Fink announced he had made an application for a Spot ETF. It rallied all the way to $48,000. Ethereum will do the exact same.\n\n\n\nBuying $ETH now has to be one of the most straightforward trades in the world. However, given $ETH\u2019s large market cap upside potential is certainly capped compared to the beta plays.\n\n\n\nArbitrum ($ARB) Leading Layer 2\n\n\n\nArbitrum ($ARB) is the leading layer two and is an easy beta play. $ARB\u2019s performance is heavily affected by $ETH\u2019s price, and if Ethereum rallies 5%, Arbitrum typically rallies 15%+.\n\n\n\nSet to benefit from the Dencun upgrade and the introduction of a new type of transaction known as a blob. Blobs will massively reduce the cost for rollup providers and end users. $ARB is one of the top 5 cryptos to invest in for anybody bullish long-term on Ethereum and the future of rollups.\n\n\n\nSynthetix ($SNX) Liquidity Provision King\n\n\n\nSynthetix ($SNX) is another of the top cryptos to buy right now, and this liquidity provision protocol is a crucial pick-and-shovel play. It is the backend for multiple protocols on Ethereum and Optimism, and a massive percentage of trading activity taking place on-chain feeds value back to $SNX stakers.\n\n\n\nOptimism ($OP) Rise of the OP Stack\n\n\n\nOptimism ($OP) is the second-largest rollup, and the propagation of the OP Stack, a modular framework for building rollups, promises to feed an incredible amount of value to $OP token holders.\n\n\n\nThey will control governance rights for all rollups constructed using the OP Stack, and the growing adoption of this tech standard increases Optimism\u2019s technological dominance. $OP is another top crypto to buy for anybody who is bullish on Ethereum and modular design.\n\n\n\nClosing Thoughts: Ethereum Uptrend Unlocks Huge Upside For Betas\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum Spot ETF will happen sooner than investors think, and beta plays are the top cryptos to buy now. As $ETH becomes dominant and starts to outperform Bitcoin, it gives these smaller caps riding on its coattails enormous upside potential.\n\n\n\nAs per raw ROI potential, Galaxy Fox is leaps and bounds beyond its competition, and $GFOX launching in the current conditions is a clear path to a 100X rally.

        "content": "Spot Ethereum ETF Approval Expected May 23rd and Could Surge in Value, New Report Says\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is looking to approve spot Ethereum ETFs by May 23rd of this year, a January 30 report revealed.\n\nA Positive Outlook\n\n\n\nThe Block\u2019s report stems from Standard Chartered Bank \u2013 a London-based, multinational bank in which its head of forex and digital assets research, Geoffrey Kendrick, expects approval for spot Ethereum ETFs to come sooner rather than later.\n\n\u201cWe expect pending applications for ETH U.S. spot ETFs to be approved on May 23, the final deadline for the first of the ETFs under consideration \u2013 the equivalent date to Jan. 10 for BC ETFs,\u201d Kendrick detailed in the report. \u201cIf ETH prices perform similarly to how BC prices performed in the lead-up to BTC ETF approval, ETH could trade as high as $4,000 by then.\u201d\n\nAn Ethereum ETF will be approved in May BlackRock/ Larry Fink is on a mission to tokenize the world. He will get it done! \u2014 borovik.eth (@3orovik) January 30, 2024\n\nConflicting Reports\n\n\n\nStandard Chartered Bank\u2019s was published just one day after New York-based investment bank TD Cowen surmised that SEC approval of spot Ethereum ETFs would be delayed to 2025 or 2026 due to the political climate in the United States.\n\n\u201cOur view remains that Gensler is in no hurry to approve an Ethereum ETF as he would first like more experience with the performance of the recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs,\u201d an analysis from TD Cowen stated on Monday.\n\nStandard Chartered Bank has joined numerous financial firms and ETF analysts in their expectation of a May 23rd approval date, given the SEC\u2019s deadline to approve or deny applications made by Ark21Shares and VanEck.\n\nI remember when BlackRock initially filed for the BTC spot ETF around $25k and how slow the bid came to the market in the proceeding days. Ethereum here feels the exact same. \u2014 McKenna (@Crypto_McKenna) January 30, 2024\n\nMoreover, in an interview earlier this month, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas estimated a 70% chance that spot Ethereum ETFs would be approved by May.\n\nA Good Sign for spot Ethereum ETFs?\n\n\n\nExperts\u2019 optimistic expectations for a spot Ethereum ETF follow the SEC\u2019s decision earlier this month to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs after nearly a decade, prompting the cryptocurrency\u2019s price to amount to over $49,000. Many analysts deemed this a \u201csell-the-news\u201d as the token\u2019s price eventually fell below $40,000, however.\n\nAdditionally, a recent mass unloading of GBTC by bankrupt crypto exchange FTX saw the market experience a not-insignificant downturn.\n\nCurrently, it seems to be on the rebound, with Bitcoin trading at over $43,000.\n\nNonetheless, numerous analysts are hopeful about what it could mean for spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\n\u201cSeeing big regulated institutions having that ability to issue Bitcoin ETFs is a very powerful statement for the market,\u201d Goldman Sachs\u2019 digital asset head Matthew McDermott told CNBC in a recent interview."

        "content": "Investors are anticipating that ethereum (ETH-USD) could be the next cryptocurrency included in a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), leading to a shift in market sentiment, an analyst told Yahoo Finance UK.\n\nZodia Markets CEO Usman Ahmad told Yahoo Finance Future Focus: \"Ethereum is where the market is looking next for a spot ETF approval.\"\n\nRead more: Turning assets into tokens on blockchain is $15tn market, says analyst\n\nAfter the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first US-listed ETFs to track bitcoin (BTC-USD) earlier in January, investors are anticipating the potential approval of spot ether ETFs.\n\nMarket focus has shifted to anticipate the approval of ethereum spot ETFs. (SOPA Images via Getty Images)\n\nMarket shifts focus to ether\n\nAhmad said that the market had initially priced in the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF. Once this became a reality, attention turned to ethereum. He highlighted a price increase of around 10% to 12% for ether after the approval of multiple spot bitcoin ETFs, indicating that ethereum is now in the spotlight for the next potential ETF approval.\n\n\"It is difficult to forecast whether ether will outperform bitcoin because now that bitcoin has an ETF wrapper, there is potentially more demand,\" Ahmad said. Bitcoin has seen increased demand due to its newfound accessibility through ETFs.\n\nRead more: Crypto live prices\n\nTaking a longer-term view, he expects bitcoin to continue performing well and experiencing a price increase as it becomes more widely accessible to the mass market.\n\nAhmad also observed that fund managers such as BlackRock (BLK), who filed an application for a spot ether ETF with the SEC in November 2023, might pave the way for the market to gain access to baskets of crypto assets within ETF wrappers in the future.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETF a 'sell the news' event\n\nAlthough the price of bitcoin has decreased from a post-ETF approval peak of over $48,000 to its current value of around $42,000, investors remain optimistic that spot Bitcoin ETFs will pave the way for mainstream capital to enter the cryptocurrency market.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: US crypto crackdown 'an opportunity for the UK'\n\nDespite the short-term fluctuations, Ahmad said: \"In the medium to longer-term, we will see a stabilization and long-term positive tailwinds for Bitcoin price action and volume activity going forward.\"\n\nPossibility of another rate pause\n\nSwitching gears to the macroeconomic perspective, Ahmad discussed the potential for a US interest rate pause and its implications for investor confidence in capital allocation strategies. He pointed out that after a rapid increase in rates following 15 years of near-zero interest rates, the market is now likely to experience another rate pause at this week's US Federal Reserve meeting.\n\nThis pause may provide investors, particularly those dealing with risk assets like bitcoin and digital assets, with more confidence to allocate capital to this asset class, according to Ahmad.\n\nWatch: Turning real assets into tokens on blockchain has $15 trillion market potential | Future Focus\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

        "content": "Ethereum has a bullish structure on the weekly chart.\n\nThe two key range resistance levels overhead line up well with the liquidation heatmap.\n\nEthereum [ETH] bulls took over a month to breach the resistance at the $2.4k mark. The Bitcoin [BTC] spot ETF approval news took Ethereum to the local high at $2.7k, but was rejected from there.\n\nThis price action presented the idea of a range within a range, which AMBCrypto explores here. In the meantime, the weekly market structure remained bullish, with the $2.1k level being the higher low.\n\nThe $2370 resistance could rebuff ETH bulls\n\nThe one-week chart showed that the $2.5k to $2.7k zone was a resistance from May 2022. It had been a support zone in March 2022 but was later breached. In the past two weeks, it served as a supply zone.\n\nThe range (purple) for Ethereum extended from $2.1k to $2.6k, with the mid-range mark at $2370.\n\nThe lows of the range saw candlewicks on the daily chart venture below $2.2k, but these were quick to bounce upward. The past few days saw another such reaction.\n\nUntil the push above $2.4k, the mid-range could be considered a range by itself. The price action since then has shown that expanding the range highs made sense.\n\nTherefore, the $2.4k and $2.6k levels are likely to oppose ETH gains.\n\nThe RSI was below neutral 50 to reflect bearish momentum, but this could change. On the other hand, the OBV fell to the December highs.\n\nThe OBV appeared to move within a range, just like the price. This meant that the buyers and sellers had been equally strong over the past month.\n\nThe liquidation heatmap could give more clues\n\nThe one-day price action suggested that a bounce to $2.4k was likely. It also underlined that the $2150-$2200 region was a firm demand zone.\n\nData from Hyblock agreed with both these inferences that AMBCrypto drew from the price action chart.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThe $2420-$2450 area was estimated to have close to $3 billion worth of liquidation levels.\n\nFurther north, the $2620-$2660 and $2750-$2800 regions were estimated to have $3.8 billion and $5 billion worth of liquidation levels respectively. This meant swing traders could book profits at these levels.\n\nDisclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion."

        "content": "Mon 29 Jan 2024 \u25aa 9 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nAt the intersection of cutting-edge technology and economic fluctuations, the world of cryptocurrencies never fails to astonish us. This week, we witnessed a series of events that not only redefine the value and function of digital currencies but also their impact on our society and global economy. From the depths of the Mt. Gox affair to the heights reached by Solana, not to mention the imminent challenges of Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as the intrigues surrounding SHIB, each story is a thread in the complex labyrinth of crypto. Join us on this weekly journey as we unravel these threads to bring you a clear and precise understanding of the latest developments in this fascinating universe.\n\nBitcoin: The Storm Nears with the Distribution of 200,000 BTC from Mt. Gox\n\nIn 2014, the Bitcoin world was shaken by the hacking of Mt. Gox, one of the largest exchange platforms at the time. Today, after a decade of twists and turns, Mt. Gox is set to repay its creditors, marking a major turning point. This process will result in the release of 200,000 BTC into the crypto ecosystem. Recently, the mtgoxinsolvency subreddit has been buzzing following the receipt of emails requesting confirmation of identity and account details.\n\nThe announcement of the distribution by Mt. Gox comes at a time when Bitcoin, already below the $43,000 mark, seems to be on a tightrope. On the one hand, the threat of a crash induced by the massive sale of recovered BTC looms. On the other, a breeze of optimism is blowing thanks to the successful introduction of a Bitcoin ETF by BlackRock, signaling a new influx of capital. Investors remain suspended between hopes of gains and fears of losses, making the Mt. Gox distribution a potentially seminal event for Bitcoin\u2019s recent history.\n\nBitcoin Halving 2024: Miners Soon to Go Bankrupt?\n\nThe Bitcoin halving scheduled for March 2024 will cut miner rewards in half, a situation that could be catastrophic for many mining players if not offset by a price increase. In 2024, Bitcoin mining requires colossal technological means, with professional miners investing massively in high-performance computing equipment and spending huge amounts on electricity to power their mining farms. According to Cantor Fitzgerald, the average cost to produce a single bitcoin currently sits around $8,500.\n\nSo far, the bitcoin reward awarded for each validated block allowed many miners to partially offset these deficits. But after the 2024 halving, this reward will be halved, potentially falling to 3.125 BTC. Such a drastic reduction in income, without an equivalent increase in price, could spell doom for most mining companies. Only those with the most aggressive production costs might hope to continue creating value. The Cantor Fitzgerald report warns that without a substantial rise in the price of bitcoin, the halving could trigger a \u201ccrypto winter\u201d and a wave of bankruptcies, making mining economically unviable and threatening the decentralized integrity of the Bitcoin network.\n\nSolana Launches Token Extensions: A Sizeable Revolution!\n\nSolana recently announced the introduction of token extensions, heralding the dawn of a new era in the crypto space. These extensions are not mere additions but cornerstones of a structure aiming to revolutionize the SPL Token standard. They promise to turn security, compliance, and ease of use into tangible realities for businesses in the crypto sphere. Solana\u2019s token extensions introduce innovations such as transfer hooks, adjustable transfer fees, and confidential transfers, offering secure and compliant navigation in the crypto space.\n\nAnatoly Yakovenko, the visionary behind Solana Labs, sees these extensions as the essence of what makes Solana unique. Their potential for massive adoption is particularly captivating, and the Solana Foundation envisions a future where crypto businesses dive into Web3 with assurance. Furthermore, despite recent volatility, the SOL crypto shows signs of underlying strength that is impressively resilient.\n\nEthereum Developers Announce Major Update\n\nEthereum developers have announced the deployment schedule for Dencun, a crucial update aimed at improving performance and reducing transaction fees. This update will first be activated on the Sepolia and Holesky testnets, on January 30 and February 7 respectively, before its deployment on the mainnet. These testnet activations are essential to ensure a smooth transition to this new version of Ethereum. Tim Beiko, one of the lead developers, emphasizes the importance of these tests to validate the robustness of Dencun and prepare for its official launch.\n\nDencun continues the revolutionary work started by Shapella in 2023, integrating the \u201cEIP-4844\u201d update, better known as \u201cProtodanksharding.\u201d This advancement is expected to lead to a dramatic decrease in transaction fees for Ethereum-based layer 2 solutions, with an estimated reduction of 90% for protocols like Optimism or Arbitrum. This radical drop in costs promises to increase the accessibility and usage of the Ethereum blockchain, thus stimulating the emergence of new layer 2 innovations.\n\nMysterious Transfer of 420 Billion SHIB: Is The Hype Back?\n\nA massive transfer of 420 billion Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens, worth $3.87 million, has recently puzzled crypto investors. On January 21, an anonymous investor transferred this astronomical sum of SHIB between two unidentified Ethereum addresses. The origin of the tokens, initially stored in a wallet associated with Coinbase Prime Custody\u2019s institutional custody solution, suggests possible involvement of professional investors. This transfer, of a rare magnitude, adds to the confusion and speculation surrounding the transaction.\n\nThis major movement of SHIB occurs shortly after a similar transaction was identified by Arkham Intelligence, involving large purchases of Shiba Inu by Robinhood. The SHIB price, which has recently dropped to its lowest level since early December 2023, shows signs of repurchase, hinting at a possible trend reversal. If the SHIB price manages to consolidate around its current level, some analysts estimate that a sustained crossing of the $0.00001 threshold could be feasible, potentially adding a bullish element to this scenario.\n\nOnly 5 Exchanges Control 98% of the Crypto Market in Euros\n\nA recent study by Kaiko reveals that only five exchange platforms control 98% of the total volume of crypto exchanges in euros. Among more than a dozen exchanges offering euro transaction services, Bitvavo, Kraken, Coinbase, Bitstamp, and Binance overwhelmingly dominate the market. This high concentration underlines the disparity in the distribution of market shares among crypto exchanges.\n\nEuropean traders have shown a marked preference for Bitcoin (BTC) in 2023, with exchange volumes exceeding 37 billion euros. In comparison, Ether (ETH) from Ethereum and Ripple\u2019s XRP recorded respective volumes of 15 billion euros and 9.5 billion euros. This dynamic highlights Bitcoin\u2019s preeminent crypto status.\n\nBitcoin Bonanza: Uncle Sam Prepares a Mega Sale of Silk Road\u2019s Crypto Treasury\n\nThe U.S. government is set to conduct a sensational sale of $130 million worth of bitcoins, seized in the course of the infamous Silk Road scandal. Silk Road, a virtual black market specialized in money laundering and drug trafficking, was shut down in 2013, but the confiscated bitcoins continue to haunt auctions. This sale undoubtedly represents a unique opportunity for bidders.\n\nThe seizure of 69,000 BTC related to the Silk Road case by the United States and the announcement of their imminent sale raise questions about the possibility of laundering a criminal past through government auctions. This situation shines a light on the moral dilemma surrounding the sale of seized goods from illegal activities.\n\nThat\u2019s the main news to remember for this week.

        "content": "The American independent investment bank, TD Cowen predicts a U.S. spot Ethereum ETF approval by late 2025 or early 2026, shifting from its initial post-November 2024 forecast, as reported by The Block.\n\nThe bank attributes the delay to political considerations, suggesting SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s reluctance to upset progressive Democrats, who were displeased with the recent spot bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nTD Cowen asserts Gensler\u2019s cautious approach to crypto, emphasizing the need for more experience with approved Bitcoin ETFs before endorsing an Ethereum counterpart.\n\nOver half a dozen firms, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have sought spot Ethereum ETF approval, but the SEC\u2019s pace, coupled with potential rule rejections, could extend the process into 2026.\n\nTD Cowen\u2019s prediction of a delayed U.S. spot Ethereum ETF approval, influenced by political dynamics and Gensler\u2019s cautious crypto stance, reflects ongoing uncertainties in the regulatory landscape despite optimistic projections."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently explored emerging intersections between crypto and artificial intelligence in an extensive blog post. He argued that certain applications appear to be far more robust than others currently.\n\nButerin categorized crypto + AI opportunities into four types, ordered by viability:\n\nMost Viable\n\nAI participates trustlessly in blockchain mechanisms as players.\n\nRewarded or penalized by assessed outcomes on-chain.\n\nArbitrage, predictions, and identity verification\n\nHigh Potential\n\nAI helps users interpret complex Web3 interactions.\n\nAssist in avoiding mistakes and detecting scams.\n\nSignificant risks remain around adversarial attacks.\n\nProceed Carefully\n\nOn-chain contracts directly integrate opaque AI components.\n\n\u201cAI judges\u201d pose numerous integrity and bias risks.\n\nCrypto techniques may boost transparency over time.\n\nLonger-Term Potential\n\nIncentivize ethical AI training via crypto protocols.\n\nEnables query limits and kill switches.\n\nAmbitiously complex to realize thus far.\n\nRead more: Floki Team Pushes Back On Hong Kong Regulator Warning\n\nThe analysis argues that AI acting as automated players within blockchain incentive structures is likely the simplest and most immediately viable model.\n\nButerin says AI can identify fake accounts\n\nButerin mentioned that it could involve prediction market information aggregation, identifying fake accounts, assessing data quality, and more\u2014all tied to transparent on-chain rewards adjudicating performance.\n\n\u201cThese applications have promise, both for functionality and for improving AI safety in a way that avoids the centralization risks associated with more mainstream approaches to that problem,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nOn the other hand, Buterin mentioned that relying directly on AI components in a smart contract or protocol seems much more dangerous.

        "title": "Ether Price Will Crash Hard Below $1,000, Says This Popular Analyst - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nBenjamin Cowen, a popular cryptocurrency trader-cum-analyst, has suggested that the price of Ethereum\u2019s native token ether (ETH) could experience further declines before finding a local bottom. Cowen expressed the possibility of ETH nosediving below the $1,000 level, attributing the potential dip to factors related to the asset\u2019s historical patterns.\n\nWill ETH Really Fall Below $1K?\n\nInvestors and traders have been closely watching ether\u2019s price in recent weeks since the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. The second-largest crypto set a new year-to-date high of $2,720 after the approvals, but it has since turned soft alongside the broader crypto market.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, analyst Benjamin Cowen has suggested that ETH historically \u201ctests the integrity\u201d of its major cycle lows roughly two times before proceeding into a new bullish phase. Cowen specifically spotlights 2015, 2016, and 2020 and confirms that another low in 2022 is yet to be revisited.\n\nAccording to the trader, ether will first break down in its Bitcoin confluence (ETH/BTC) in the coming months before ETH/USD follows.\n\n\u201cSo at some point, I think Ethereum will test the integrity of that low, back down below $1,000. But, history would also suggest that it won\u2019t test it until after ETH/BTC breaks down. And history also suggests that ETH/BTC probably won\u2019t break down in January because normally January is a good month for Ethereum,\u201d Bowen told his nearly 800,000 YouTube subscribers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the analyst noted that it could take some time before this scenario plays out amid increased speculation among investors about the possible introduction of a spot Ether ETF and Bitcoin\u2019s April halving event. According to experts, now that there is clarity after the Bitcoin ETFs, spot ETH ETFs may come sooner than expected.\n\nSpot ETH ETFs Aren\u2019t Far Away\n\nAs ZyCrypto previously covered, multiple companies including BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest are seeking regulatory approval to set up spot ether exchange-traded funds. However, the SEC recently delayed the verdict for these investment products.\n\nAlthough such delays could subsequently delay a parabolic ETH rally, the SEC\u2019s approval ultimately will propel the price of the asset to new heights. With spot ETH ETFs, U.S. investors will access a regulated, tax-advantaged way of gaining exposure to the industry\u2019s second-biggest crypto.\n\nBesides the potential ETF, technical developments within the Ethereum ecosystem could also propel the ETH price. Notably, ETH devs recently set the timeline for the final Dencun testnet upgrades. Dencun will be run through the Sepolia test network on January 30, and on the Holesky testnet on Feb.7. This puts the upgrade on track to hit the mainnet in late February or early March."

        "content": "BlackRock Eyes Ethereum ETF After Bitcoin; Avalanche and InQubeta Show Strong Market Performance\n\nAfter the success of its Bitcoin ETFs, speculation is rife that BlackRock now has its eyes set on an Ethereum (ETH) ETF. The investment company rolled out its ETF in January this year in US markets after approval from the country\u2019s regulatory watchdog Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThough there are concerns about whether Ethereum would be able to fulfill ETF acceptance criteria, analysts suggest that the possibility can\u2019t be denied either.\n\nMeanwhile, InQubeta (QUBE) and Avalanche (AVAX) have cemented their positions as two of the best crypto investments in the market today. The two tokens have surged with their impressive performance.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s price rally coincides with its impressive presale growth. So far, its ICO has raised over $8.4 million.\n\nInQubeta: Helping startups build robust business models\n\n\n\nInQubeta offers budding companies an uncomplicated way to raise funds for their AI projects and scale their businesses. The platform is a relevant addition to the startup ecosystem as fundraising is often riddled by unnecessary formalities.\n\nBuilt on the Ethereum network, InQubeta simplifies interactions between investors and startups through its NFT marketplace. All that investors have to do is evaluate NFTs and purchase them with InQubeta\u2019s native cryptocurrency \u2013 the QUBE token.\n\nThe NFTs are created from the offers proposed by the companies to potential investors. As the portal allows fractional investment, it\u2019s a budget-friendly investment mechanism too.\n\nThe QUBE token is among the best altcoins to buy now as it fulfills the need for a stable asset with its deflationary model. The feature kicks in whenever inflation is high and restricts the supply of the token.\n\nEven as demand is rising, the supply of the asset is reduced, so that price fluctuations are minimized. Even if the supply increases, it\u2019s brought down by burning the newly added tokens.\n\nThe InQubeta team has instituted a roadmap for the development of the platform. The team\u2019s plans for the platform include launches of new features and a staking dApp. Crypto users can also expect to see the QUBE token listed on centralized exchanges in the coming months.\n\nEthereum Layer 2 developer raises $23 million in Series A funding\n\n\n\nEthereum is a cutting-edge blockchain technology that can support a wide array of decentralized solutions like dApps, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs. It\u2019s considered a versatile blockchain as it can be paired with new technologies like zero knowledge for innovative applications. Its native token is known as ETH.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies these days due to speculation over Ethereum ETFs. There have been reports of investment company BlackRock mulling launching an Ethereum ETF. The company\u2019s Bitcoin ETF was among the 11 that debuted in the market on January 10 after a green light from US regulators. The reports have catapulted Ethereum into the limelight and have helped it rally ahead.\n\nThe ETH blockchain also hit the headlines recently after Polymer Labs, which is creating an Ethereum Layer 2 network, raised $23 million in funding. The Series A funding round saw participation by names like Coinbase Ventures, Blockchain Capital, North Island Ventures, and Maven 11, among others. The Layer 2 network will be providing interoperability-as-a-service to Ethereum and its rollups.\n\nAvalanche Foundation announces rules for buying meme coins\n\n\n\nAvalanche is a smart contracts protocol that enables developers to create scalable dApps. Its native token AVAX is used for all transactions that are confirmed via the proof-of-stake protocol.\n\nIt\u2019s considered a good crypto to buy if you are looking for something that taps into the latest developments in blockchain technology. It has been rising steadily in the market and has prompted an optimistic forecast from several analysts.\n\nThe Avalanche Foundation hit the headlines recently as it announced a new framework for buying meme coins. The eligibility framework mandates that the meme coins be native to the Avalanche blockchain and are independent of their creators. Other rules include that there should be no tokens set aside for team members.\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nEthereum, InQubeta, and Avalanche are top crypto coins that are expected to usher in a new era for altcoin gains in 2024. These cryptocurrencies represent the evolution of DeFi and are among the leading gainers of the market today.\n\nBy making cryptocurrencies easier to understand and use, they have paved the way for financial inclusion among the masses.\n\nWhat\u2019s making crypto users more confident in these coins is their strong security models. Their ecosystems have been vetted by leading blockchain audit companies.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale"

        "content": "How ICP steals the spotlight from Bitcoin and Ethereum: A Big Innovation in Blockchain. Raj Awasthi \u00b7 Follow 3 min read \u00b7 Jan 30, 2024 -- Listen Share\n\nSince we have introduced blockchain technology, we have explored what Bitcoin and Ethereum are. Now we have another blockchain product (ICP) that surely takes charge of its unlimited possibilities.\n\nIn the Bitcoin ecosystem, the objective was to develop a decentralized digital currency that facilitates security and immutability. Apart from this, the Ethereum ecosystem was more like a decentralized platform for the installation of dApps (decentralized applications), focusing on smart contracts and programmability.\n\nIn 2021, the ICP (the internet computer) entered the blockchain industry as the third invention of the blockchain that brought the concept of infinite blockchain and redefined the development of everything.\n\nPhoto by Pierre Borthiry - Peiobty on Unsplash\n\nIn this article, we\u2019re going to take a look at how ICP transforms the outlook of the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems.\n\nHow does ICP affect the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems?\n\nIntroducing Decentralized Identity (DID):\n\nWith the inclusion of a decentralized identity, it's now a much more secure approach to storing the data. Unlike traditional protocols, which have very few ways to provide identity and authentication,\n\nThis innovation provides the benefit of an extra identity layer to the users of Bitcoin and Ethereum for the sake of reducing fraud.\n\nSignificant evolution of smart contracts:\n\nAs the blockchain landscape is evolving, there is an important advancement in smart contracts. In ICP, canister smart contracts provide a reliable and secure alternative to Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts.\n\nWith the advancement of smart canisters, it may be beneficial for developers who want to create innovative applications on ICP that interact with Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nEnabling remarkable interoperability:\n\nNot only Bitcoin integration but also ICP bridges the gap with Ethereum and fosters a seamless collaboration between the two ecosystems. This eliminates the need for bridges and achieves full decentralization.\n\nThis direct interface creates unparalleled opportunities for frictionless interactions between ICP and the Bitcoin blockchain, opening up new routes for decentralized applications.\n\nIncluding scaling capabilities and cost efficiency:\n\nUnlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, IPC comes with infinite scaling capabilities, as there are no limitations on transactions per second (TPS), which is 7 for Bitcoin and 15-20 for Ethereum. It's very important to have such an amazing scaling capacity, as it\u2019s very important for the future growth of ICP.\n\nThe cost efficiency of storing 1GB of data on ICP is approximately $5 per year, which is around $350,000,000 for Ethereum. This cost-effectiveness is one of the biggest reasons for the inclination towards ICP.\n\nSeamless integration with Bitcoin and Ethereum:\n\nThe Internet Computer (ICP) is altering the decentralized environment with its distinct set of features and capabilities. Through direct integration with Bitcoin, smooth interaction with Ethereum, and the ability to offer interactive web content directly to consumers, ICP envisions a future in which blockchain technology fulfills its full potential. Whether you're a consumer looking for a more accessible and user-friendly blockchain experience or an investor looking for game-changing companies, ICP provides an attractive opportunity to investigate the possibilities of decentralized innovation. Embrace the power of the Internet and start on the road toward a decentralized future.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nThe third invention of blockchain technology holds an amazing future for integrating with other blockchain platforms like Bitcoin and Ethereum. ICP takes an important step towards improving scalability, security, and, of course, transparency. With its optimum utilization, now we can build everything differently. As we all know, it's the era of the digital revolution, and blockchain is not an exception.\n\nHowever, it's also important to understand that ICP is still in the process of development, and with time, it will pave the way to building a whole different world along with proper governance of it.\n\nSo there you have it. If you have any suggestions for this post, feel free to join the discussion.\n\nThis is Raj Awasthi.\n\nSigning off!"
