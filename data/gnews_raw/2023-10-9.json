        "title": "Ethereum is 'much more centralized than folks realize': Blocknative's Matt Cutler - Blockworks",
        "content": "Blocknative discontinued its MEV-boost relayer service on Ethereum last week. While other relayers do remain, a large majority of Ethereum transactions are now handled by just four entities.\n\nRelayers are responsible for bridging transactions between block builders and proposers. Without relayers, the network would face delays in transaction confirmations, reduced efficiency and potential bottlenecks, disrupting the smooth processing of transactions.\n\nThis development not only raises centralization concerns, but also underscores one of Ethereum\u2019s central obstacles post-Merge: Relayers are providing costly services without compensation.\n\nBlockworks: Some funding approaches would solicit community donations to reward relayers while keeping the service free. Why didn\u2019t you buy into these sorts of funding models?\n\nCutler: We\u2019re a US-based entity, and that means OFAC SDN is a fact of life for us. We work very hard to be ecosystem aligned, and there are a lot of hard line stances as it relates to OFAC SDN compliance. A number of the public goods funding approaches that were being discussed for relays explicitly carved out relays that were OFAC SDN compliant, and I had some in-depth conversations with [Ethereum Foundation] core devs who basically felt that this was a black and white issue.\n\nBy the way, each infraction of OFAC SDN is up to a $30 million fine and up to 30 years in jail, right? And each transaction can be considered an infraction. So it\u2019s like infinite liability. We were put in a sort of a rock and a hard place situation where we couldn\u2019t satisfy both.\n\nBlockworks: Were you told OFAC compliance would keep you from receiving funds from community relayer funds that are currently in the works?\n\nCutler: While this was a topic of active discussion, specifically we never got that far. I think from our perspective this is really not about covering our costs. I mean, certainly the costs are substantial, but you know we\u2019re trying to build a business here. And so just keeping the lights on and maybe not even paying for engineer salaries doesn\u2019t really cut it. We\u2019re trying to drive growth, right?\n\nBlockworks: One argument made against more baked-in revenue creation for relays is that charging fees creates a slippery slope where fees increase and users find ways to circumvent relays. What would you say to this?\n\nCutler: There is no other part of core Ethereum infrastructure which is really funded as a public good, maybe other than consensus clients, and they\u2019re funded pretty heavily. So why do we pass the hat for something which is operationally required?\n\nI was always an advocate for what I call \u201cmissed slot insurance.\u201d There\u2019s many examples of relays, including Blocknative, making staking pools pull due to missed slots. My answer was there should be a hard fee with a hard benefit. The hard fee is you\u2019re gonna pay into an insurance pool, and in the event where the relay network doesn\u2019t do its job, you can expect missed slot insurance. OK, conversely, if you\u2019re using a relay which is not part of the structure, you cannot expect insurance, but this is the bargain.\n\nReally what the network wants from the relay network is not competition. It wants utility. I flip on the light switch, and the lights come on, and I sort of understand that there\u2019s a whole set of people who might be involved in delivering the power, but I don\u2019t want to think about any of that. I don\u2019t want to hear that, like, the oil came out of the ground in Bahrain and then got put on a boat that got caught up in the Suez Canal, and you gotta call the boat company. You\u2019re like, \u201cno, I just want the lights to go on,\u201d right? You\u2019re receiving this massive benefit from our operations, and there should be some sort of fee structure that\u2019s associated with it.\n\nBlockworks: To zoom out for a second, why do relayers matter for Ethereum and the worldview it\u2019s trying to advance?\n\nCutler: The whole idea is we\u2019re building the foundation of the next economy that\u2019s fundamentally more equitable than the existing system, and maybe it\u2019s inevitable we recreate it, right? That\u2019s something that is concerning to me.\n\nAt the relayer network, we now have four entities \u2014 two in the US, two in Europe \u2014 that relay 93% of all the blocks on Ethereum. There\u2019s no explicit economic incentive, therefore there are implicit economic incentives that are opaque. There are all sorts of economic incentives to do things like colocation and there\u2019s all sorts of backroom deals that are possible and may even be happening right now. The network is much more centralized than folks realize and is on a trend to become more centralized. It\u2019s going in the wrong direction, and hey, Blocknative exiting, we can decide if this is a good or a bad thing or if it\u2019s a non event, but there\u2019s no question it\u2019s now more centralized this week than it was last week.\n\nThis interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin is the Co-founder of what is now the world\u2019s second-most valuable cryptocurrency, Ethereum, worth an estimated US$220.2bn. Involved in crypto from its beginnings, Buterin is also the founder of Bitcoin Magazine and is today a figure synonymous with all things crypto.\n\nBut how did he get here? We look at Buterin\u2019s rise to prominence as Co-founder of Ethereum.\n\nButerin: Capitalising on a gift\n\nBorn in Moscow Oblast in 1994, Buterin left his native Russia to live in Canada aged just six, as his parents sought greater employment opportunities.\n\nAn immigrant primary school student, Buterin was placed in a programme for the gifted, where his early nous for mathematics and programming made him a novelty to his teachers, let alone his fellow students.\n\nDespite his initial flippancy for education success in the traditional sense, Buterin developed a hunger to acquire knowledge during his four years at the private Aberald school.\n\nA fan of World of Warcraft, Buterin soon became opposed to centralised services in general, after game developer Blizzard removed a feature from the game, \u2018nerfing\u2019 one of his favourite characters.\n\nPerhaps it was here a love for the decentralised was born, as in 2011, Buterin developed a keen interest in the newly launched Bitcoin \u2013 the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency.\n\nUnable to purchase any Bitcoin tokens, Buterin sought out employment writing for this new mysterious industry, where he would earn 5 BTC per article.\n\nStriking a relationship with fellow crypto enthusiast Mihai Alisie, the pair launched their own publication, Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nButerin: Founding Ethereum\n\nLaunching a print edition in 2012, Bitcoin Magazine is regarded as the first publication exclusively dedicated to cryptocurrencies.\n\nDuring this time, Buterin attempted to join the crypto platform Ripple but was unable to do so because of US Visa issues.\n\nDetermined to make his way in the world of crypto, Buterin completed a whitepaper detailing his idea for what would later become Ethereum, summarised as a \u201cdecentralised mining network and software development platform rolled into one\u201d.\n\nEssentially, Ethereum would provide a platform that facilitated the creation of new crypto assets and associated programmes using the same blockchain, or cryptographic transaction ledger.\n\nInitially planning his idea to \u2018improve\u2019 Bitcoin \u2013 arguing it needed a scripting language to develop applications \u2013 Bitcoin\u2019s disregard of the proposal saw Buterin move ahead with Ethereum, co-founding the crypto platform alongside a string of other investors.\n\nThese included Bitcoin Magazine Co-founder Mihai Alisie, as well as computer programmers Jeffrey Wilcke and Gavin Wood, ConsenSys Founder Joseph Lubin, Charles Hoskinson, Anthony Di Lorio and Amir Chetrit.\n\nUnveiled in 2014 at a conference in Miami, the founders soon held an initial coin offering for Ether \u2013 Ethereum\u2019s native coin \u2013 raising US$18m to grow the Ethereum platform.\n\nThe team then established the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organisation based in Switzerland, that would run the crypto platform.\n\nDistinguishing five key principles \u2013 simplicity, universality, modularity, agility and non-discrimination/non-censorship \u2013 Ethereum was successfully launched, and Buterin was at the core of it all.\n\nEthereum: A leading crypto platform\n\nA rapid rise over a short space of time, Buterin looked back on Etehreum\u2019s unprecedented growth in 2020.\n\nHe said: \"I am truly grateful to have the opportunity to work in such an interesting and interdisciplinary area of industry, where I have the chance to interact with cryptographers, mathematicians and economists prominent in their fields, to help build software and tools that already affect tens of thousands of people around the world, and to work on advanced problems in computer science, economics and philosophy every week.\"\n\nPioneering in a new industry space, Ethereum\u2019s rise has not come without its issues, after a decentralised autonomous organization (DAO) using the Ethereum platform was hacked due to codebase flaws.\n\nAs a result, the Ethereum blockchain was hard forked (when nodes of new blockchain entries no longer accept older versions) to retrieve funds, a controversial move that flew in the face of blockchain being unchangeable and censorship-resistant.\n\nDespite these issues, Ethereum remains on a path to increased scalability after completing a transformative process known as The Merge.\n\nPer the upgrade, Ethereum adopted sharding, a process where its network is split into shard chains, making it possible to distribute the Ethereum network load across several avenues.\n\nA process that relieved network congestion, the crypto platform also moved to a proof-of-stake mining model \u2013 as opposed to the traditional proof-of-work model \u2013 reducing its energy output by as much as 99%.\n\nButerin: A crypto leader\n\nButerin\u2019s achievements with Ethereum, conceiving and creating the platform himself, make him a leader in the world of crypto. It has been said that Buterin today develops his time to research, removing the focus on him as a crypto pioneer.\n\nHis father, Dimitry Buterin, said to The New Yorker: \"He is trying to focus his time on research. He's not too excited that the community assigns so much importance to him. He wants the community to be more resilient.\"\n\nDespite this, we believe Buterin deserves saluting as a pioneer in the world of crypto nonetheless."

        "title": "ETF Prime: Islam on the Debut of Ethereum Futures ETFs and More - ETF Trends",
        "content": "On this episode of ETF Prime, host Nate Geraci speaks with a trio of individuals discussing several different ETF-related topics. His guests include VettaFi\u2019s Roxanna Islam who discusses the debut of Ethereum futures ETFs. Geraci also speaks with Baird\u2019s Rich Lee who discusses ETF trading volumes and more. To close the podcast Geraci talks with Texas Capital\u2019s Ed Rosenberg about the Texas Capital Texas Equity Index ETF (TXS).\n\nDebut of Ethereum Futures ETFs\n\nTo open the podcast Geraci brings on VettaFi\u2019s Roxanna Islam to discuss the debut of the Ethereum futures ETFs. Geraci first points out how last week seven Ethereum Futures ETFs launched, and he highlights how he feels that the SEC accelerated the launch of these funds. He mentions that the possible government shutdown could\u2019ve been what brought these funds to market so quickly. However, Geraci mentioned that despite the government accelerating the release of these funds they were not met with a lot of interest from the market. He says there are about $17 million in net assets from all seven funds following their initial release. Geraci then asks Islam for her initial reaction to this disappointing debut.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it has been much of a surprise especially when you compare it to those Bitcoin Future ETF launches a couple of years ago,\u201d said Islam.\n\nIslam continues by comparing the releases of these Ethereum funds to the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) which brought in close to a billion on its first-day trading. While these Ethereum funds only brought in about seven million on its first day on the market.\n\nDifferences Between Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nIslam then highlights several other reasons as to why these Ethereum Futures ETFs have had such a disappointing debut. She first points out that you need to look at pure Bitcoin versus pure Ethereum, not underneath the ETF wrapper but as cryptocurrencies. Islam mentions that Bitcoin by far has more popularity among investors when you compare the two.\n\n\u201cIt has about 50% market share in the crypto market versus Ethereum which has less than 20% of market share,\u201d Islam said.\n\nUltimately, Islam believes that it is safe to assume that interest in Ethereum is not as high as it is in Bitcoin. Islam then points out the fact that the cryptocurrency market is much different than it was back when the Bitcoin futures ETFs were first launched. Today the attitude on cryptocurrency is also in a different place than it was when funds like BITO first came to market. She also points out the differences between spot and future ETFs as another reason why these funds may have not garnered that much attention.\n\nTo close the segment the pair continue going in-depth into the future of these funds, and more.\n\nBond ETF Trading Volumes\n\nThe conversation then switches gears when Geraci brings on Rich Lee, Head of Program Trading and Execution Strategy at Baird to discuss a multitude of different topics. Geraci highlights how Lee himself is involved in several different areas of Baird\u2019s business, but he primarily helps institutional clients with their ETF trading strategies. He then asks for Lee\u2019s thoughts on bond ETF trading in today\u2019s market as last week there was a record amount of trade volume in the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG).\n\n\u201cLast week it quickly dawned on me that basically five of the top 10 most active ETFs that we traded were actually bond or treasury-related ETFs,\u201d said Lee.\n\nLee then highlights several different funds in the bond space that Baird\u2019s has specifically been trading. He mentioned that he and his firm have a significant amount of interest in the current fixed-income space. The pair discuss the concept of \u201cbottom fishing\u201d when pertaining to the significant number of flows that the bond space has seen this year.\n\nAdditionally, Geraci and Lee discuss concentration risk pertaining to the S&P 500, active management, and several other topics.\n\nThe TXS ETF\n\nTo close the podcast Geraci brings on Ed Rosenberg, the Head of ETF and Fund Management at Texas Capital to discuss his firm\u2019s TXS ETF. Prior to the conversation, Geraci mentioned that the TXS is the only state-specific ETF. Rosenburg joins the conversation by sharing his thoughts on what makes Texas Capital a full-service firm. Rosenberg attributes the number of different service offerings his firm gives its clients as one of the main reasons he considers Texas Capital a full-service firm. He then dives into what made the firm want to get into the ETF space.\n\n\u201cIt is another service offering for the clients of Texas Capital, and beyond,\u201d said Rosenburg.\n\nTo close the discussion Geraci and Rosenburg spotlight some of the key features of the TXS ETF as well as the philosophy behind investing in the state of Texas. The pair also touch on what the firm\u2019s future plans are within the ETF space.\n\nListen to the entire episode of ETF Prime Featuring Roxanna Islam, Rich Lee, and Ed Rosenberg:\n\nFor more ETF Prime podcast episodes, visit our ETF Prime channel."

        "content": "Ethereum price struggled to clear $1,660 and reacted to the downside against the US dollar. ETH remains at risk of more losses if it breaks the $1,550 support.\n\nEthereum resumed its decline and retested the $1,550 support.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,610 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could accelerate lower if there is a close below the $1,550 support zone.\n\nEthereum Price Dives Again\n\nEthereum failed to settle above the $1,665 resistance zone. ETH started a fresh decline from the $1,665 resistance zone and dived below the $1,650 level.\n\nThe bears pushed the price below the $1,600 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Ether retested the $1,550 support. A low was formed near $1,549 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,664 swing high to the $1,549 low.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $1,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,610 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nOn the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,600 level. The first major resistance is near the trend line and $1,610. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,664 swing high to the $1,549 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next major resistance is $1,620 or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, above which the price could rise toward the $1,665 resistance zone. A close above the $1,665 resistance might send the price toward the key resistance at $1,750. The next key resistance might be $1,820. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $1,880.\n\nDownside Break in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,600 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,565 level. The next key support is $1,550.\n\nA downside break below the $1,550 support might start another strong decline. In the stated case, the price could revisit the $1,465 level. Any more losses may perhaps send Ether toward the $1,420 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,550\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,620\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Ether (ETH) prices dropped by about 1.5% in the past few hours. This drop appears to be a reaction from traders after a wallet that certainly belonged to the Ethereum Foundation sold a portion of its allocated Ether tokens.\n\nThis specific wallet, with the address \u201c0x9eE457023bB3De16D51A003a247BaEaD7fce313D,\u201d exchanged more than 1,700 Ether for $2.7 million in USDC on Monday, according to data from Arkham.\n\nOn the blockchain tracking platform Etherscan, this wallet labeled as a \u201cGrant Provider\u201d had around $400,000 worth of tokens on Monday morning.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation did not reveal specifics how they intended to with the funds they received. Due to this lack of clarity, traders reacted by selling Ethereum (ETH), which led to over 2% drop in its price since ethereum foundation had sold its stake.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation develops applications and programs for the Ethereum network but is not a formal authority or a central organization that governs the Ethereum blockchain. It can affect the value of Ethereum tokens and the perception of Ethereum by investors and traders.\n\nIn April 2022, it held over almost $1.29 billion worth of ether (ETH), which accounted for more than 0.297% of the total ether supply at that time.\n\nAdditionally, they held around $300 million in investments outside of the cryptocurrency space."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nDespite facing sanctions from the U.S. Treasury in August 2022, Tornado Cash continues to dominate as the premier crypto mixer on the Ethereum network.\n\nRecent data from crypto analytics firm Arkham reveals that a staggering $77.35 million in assets passed through Tornado Cash contracts on the Ethereum Mainnet in just the last month.\n\nAn impressive comeback\n\nThe mixer, which operates across seven different chains, has made a name for itself by allowing users to obfuscate transfers of ten distinct crypto assets, with native ETH on the Ethereum mainnet being the most popular.\n\nAt its height in July 2021, Tornado Cash managed more than $700 million of ETH in its pool contracts. The platform did experience a significant setback post-sanctions, with assets plummeting by over 60% and a substantial decrease in transfer volume.\n\nNotably, this downturn was only temporary, as both total value locked (TVL) and transfer volume showed signs of recovery, even amidst the arrest of two of Tornado\u2019s three founders.\n\nAt present, Tornado's TVL sits at approximately 118.3K ETH, equivalent to about $187.9 million, according to data provided by Arkham.\n\nUnder scrutiny\n\nAs reported by U.Today, the U.S. Treasury sanctioned the cryptocurrency mixing service Tornado Cash, accusing it of enabling the laundering of funds linked to North Korea's Lazarus Group. Despite Tornado Cash's claims of being a tool for preserving financial privacy, the Treasury alleges it facilitated illicit transactions, including the laundering of $445 million stolen by Lazarus. Tornado Cash developers, Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, were charged with aiding in laundering over $1 billion, with Storm being arrested.\n\nA Coinbase-backed group has lost a lawsuit challenging the U.S. Treasury Department's actions against the popular mixer. Judge Robert Pitman has ruled that Tornado Cash is a recognizable entity with property interest in its smart contracts.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. government's sanctions against the decentralized service Tornado Cash emphasize the challenges of shutting such services down entirely since programmers utilize its open-source code to develop similar programs."

As liquidity in the pool increases and adjusts to the entry queue, rewards are expected to fluctuate between 0% and 4% in the first days after the launch.\n\n\n\n\u2013 For legal reasons, US-based users cannot use the pooled staking service through Ledger Live.\n\n\n\nPooled staking is now available on Ledger Live. Kiln allows you to stake any amount of ETH and earn rewards.\n\nEthereum\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism allowed holders to put their ETH to work and earn rewards. After that, Ledger Live users could solo stake their ETH with Kiln or use Lido for liquid staking. However, native staking requires a deposit minimum of 32 ETH while liquid staking is often considered risky due to the transferable receipt tokens.\n\nWith pooled staking, your ETH is combined with the stakes of other users to meet 32 ETH deposit thresholds.\n\nThe Kiln Staking Pool will be bootstrapped organically, relying on early adopters and platform integrations for its success. During this initial phase, the validator entry queue may be long, which can result in longer times for staked assets and rewards to accumulate. Currently, the queue stands at around 1 day and 15 hours. Learn more about Kiln pooled staking offer.\n\nFor Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Rochet, VP, International Development at Ledger, \u201cStaking is an indispensable function of many public, permissionless blockchains that allows users to participate in network governance and protect themselves from inflation. Ledger is pleased to see Kiln\u2019s innovative staking technology made available to all Ledger users.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince Kiln\u2019s integration into the Ledger Live apps catalog last year, which allowed staking multiples of 32 ETH, a growing number of Ledger users have eagerly awaited a pooling feature for staking any amount,\u201d said Laszlo Szabo, CEO at Kiln. \u201cToday, our staking pool launch within the Ledger ecosystem takes a significant step toward further democratizing staking, enabling all ETH holders to securely stake any amount using their Ledger devices. With Kiln, Ledger users can now access a complete staking experience, including secure staking of any amount of ETH, deployment of dedicated validators, and reward tracking through the Ledger Earn dashboard.\u201d\n\nComparing the staking options\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure which type of staking is right for you, take a look at our comprehensive guide that will help you select the right option based on the amount of ETH you want to stake.\n\nSolo staking:\n\nNative staking allows you to participate in the network as a validator and earn rewards. You need to deposit batches of 32 ETH and manage your own node or use a validator-as-a-service provider such as solo staking with Kiln through Ledger Live.\n\nPooled staking:\n\nWith pooled staking you can stake any amount of ETH. To meet the 32 ETH deposit requirement, your stake is combined with the stakes of other users in a staking pool. You need to use validator-as-a-service providers.\n\nLiquid staking:\n\nLiquid staking lets you stake any amount of ETH\u2014to meet the 32 ETH deposit requirement, your stake is combined with the stakes of other users. With liquid staking, you\u2019ll receive a transferrable receipt token in exchange for your stake.\n\nGetting started with pooled staking is easy\n\nTo get started:\n\nOpen the Ledger Live app and connect your Ledger Nano. In Ledger Live, navigate to Accounts \u2192 Ethereum. In the upper left corner, click Stake. A window will appear with the option to select solo or pooled staking with Kiln or liquid staking with Lido. Select Pooled Staking. Enter the amount you want to stake and click Stake.\n\nFor detailed, step-by-step instructions, check out this article.\n\nPut your ETH to work and reap the rewards\n\nWhen it comes to staking Ethereum, there are various options to choose from. Pooled staking is available if you want to stake your ETH without depositing 32 ETH or having to run your own validator node. Additionally, it is an alternative to liquid staking for users who want to avoid depeg risk.\n\nThrough its Ledger Live integration, Kiln allows you to leverage pooled staking securely and in just a few clicks."

        "content": "What is driving the price of Ethereum? Bullish and Bearish Factors for Q4\n\nThe price of Ethereum continues to range, with no clear momentum in either direction. What are the possible bullish and bearish factors likely to impact ETH\u2019s performance in Q4, 2023?\n\nEthereum (ETH) is currently the largest smart contract platform in the world by value of its native currency. Ether, the native currency that powers Ethereum, is also the second largest cryptocurrency in the world. Ethereum is also the largest smart contract chain by Total Value Locked (TVL) into Decentralized Finance (DeFi).\n\nEthereum currently has a market cap of ~US$201.3 billion, with each individual Ether currently priced at US$1583.17. Year to date the price of Ether is up ~32.0%. While YTD performance may suggest that ETH has had an excellent year, after hitting a cycle peak of ~US$2100 in April 2023, the price of the asset has steadily slid to a price level of around ~US$1600.\n\nTo evidence this middling 6-month period, if an investor was dollar cost averaging (DCA) Ether from the 1st of January, buying it weekly, they would be at a loss as of today. Dollar-cost averaging is the process of investing the same amount of money in a targeted asset at regular intervals over a certain period of time, regardless of price.\n\nBuying US$10 of ETH weekly from January 1, 2023, to October 3, 2023, would have turned US$400.00 into ~US$392, resulting in a loss of ~4.1%.\n\nSource: Brave new coin\n\nBackground\n\nEthereum was launched in 2015 and builds on the original blockchain innovations first introduced by Bitcoin.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum allow users to exchange value without payment providers or banks. Ethereum, however, differs because it allows application developers to build decentralized applications. It is able to do this because it supports more complex, programmable transactions than Bitcoin. These more complex transactions are facilitated by smart contracts, which are self-executing \u2018contracts\u2019 where the terms of agreement or conditions are written into lines of code. The \u2018contracts\u2019 in this case can be considered similar to traditional contracts for value exchange with penalties and rules predetermined and \u2018smart\u2019 because they can be triggered automatically.\n\nThe project has humble beginnings. A whitepaper for the project was written by 19-year-old Canadian developer Vitalik Buterin in 2013. After successful funding rounds in 2014 powered by the concept of Ethereum\u2019s vision of a new internet powered by decentralized applications, the project had its real coming out party in 2017 during the ICO bull run.\n\nBecause of its multi-purpose functionality, it became the platform of choice for Initial Coin Offerings, a method of fundraising blockchain projects through launching new tokens. With a swathe of highly successful projects conducting ICOs using Ethereum as a medium, value rushed into the network.\n\nAfter the emergence of Decentralized Finance in 2019 and 2020, alongside a re-emergence of Non-Fungible tokens (NFTs) and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), in 2021, Ethereum once again experienced an extreme surge in value. While this bull run shared similarities with the bull run from 2017\u2014 a rush of value from developers and projects choosing to finance themselves using Ethereum \u2014 a distinguishing feature of this bull run was institutional interest in Ethereum.\n\nDuring this period, for example, Real Vision Founder and noted Macro investor, Raoul Pal, said in an interview that the market cap of Ethereum could overtake that of Bitcoin by the next market cycle. A Former Goldman Sachs executive, Pal also said he believed Ethereum was the \u201cgreatest trade\u201d setup that he has ever seen because cryptocurrency\u2019s fundamentals suggested that it had an enormous value.\n\nDuring 2021, Ethereum went from a fringe technology to one that was advocated and accepted by a growing number of legacy financial traders.\n\nThe story Now\n\nTechnological strength and developer popularity \u2013 Bullish\n\nDespite six months of tepid price activity, Ethereum continues to evidence the powerful underlying macro fundamentals that Pal was referring to. \u201cThey\u2019re two entirely different things. One is this pristine collateral store-of-value asset. The other one is basically a technology platform that\u2019s the fastest-growing on Earth. Is that [second one] going to be worth more? Yeah,\u201d explained Pal when referring to Ethereum.\n\nEthereum remains the de facto platform to build blockchain projects on top of. It is the oldest and most trusted smart contract blockchain and because of this it has a wealth of open source code available to replicate. It also has well-known tooling like OpenZeppelin and applications on Ethereum are more auditable than many other blockchains. It remains the gateway blockchain for most new entrants, particularly institutions and brands.\n\nDespite having relatively higher costs and slower transaction processing speeds than many other comparable platform blockchains, Ethereum is also preferred thanks to its size and inherent security.\n\nVenture Capital firm Electric Capital is highly regarded for its analysis of the Crypto/Blockchain developer ecosystem. As of June 2023, it reports that Ethereum has 5946 active developers working on it in total and that 1901 of these developers are full-time. This dwarfs the next most popular chain by total developers, Polkadot, which has 1923 total developers and 645 full-time ones.\n\nThe only other major blockchains comparable to Ethereum in terms of developer growth are smaller platforms with lower market caps like Cosmos and Solana.\n\nIn the last yearly report for crypto developers by Electric Capital, at the end of 2022, it measured that in the 4 years between 2018 and 2022, Ethereum experienced a more than 5 times increase in monthly active developers, from 1,084 to 5,819.\n\nIt is difficult to verify Pal\u2019s assertion that Ethereum is the fastest-growing technology platform in the world. It is certainly the largest technology platform in the rapidly growing blockchain space but how it compares to other technology paradigms like Cloud and IoT is difficult to verify. Data from the State of Developer Ecosystem 2021 by Jetbrains would suggest, however, that it is much larger than IoT but much smaller than the cloud.\n\nEthereum, because of its incumbency as the most developed blockchain in the world, is in a strong position to be at the forefront of the Web3, Defi, NFT, and Metaverse revolutions. Groundbreaking apps like Compound, Opensea, and Decentraland were built on Ethereum first for a reason.\n\nProne to attacks- Bearish\n\nWhile Ethereum is a technology platform that is growing in popularity it is prone to being exploited. On 20 July 2016, a reentrancy attack on the Ethereum DAO\u2019s smart contract led to losses of 3.6 million ether (worth about US$50 million at the time). After initially blocking off the over 11 million within the DAO, the attacker made off with about a third of this by setting up a \u2018Child DAO\u2019 smart contract with a similar structure to the DAO. The attack led to community disagreements that forked Ethereum forever and led to a drop off in confidence across the Ethereum investment landscape.\n\nWhile Ethereum developers have become better at writing smart contracts, there are still numerous vectors that attackers are targeting. An example is cross-chain bridging platforms. Bridging applications will generally be set up with smart contracts on either blockchain and an intermediary that communicates between the two.\n\nBridging technology has helped users shift from incumbent chains like Ethereum to new networks like Metis with a few clicks and through easy-to-navigate portals. Bridges have helped promote the growth of emerging blockchains like Metis, Moonbeam, and Optimism. While also offering relevance to Ethereum as a feeder blockchain.\n\nWriting robust smart contracts across multiple blockchains, however, is no easy task. Bridging between blockchains is a complex operation with many moving parts. There are more points of failure and well-resourced hackers can often move faster than developers.\n\nRecent years have seen the emergence of government-funded, professional hacking groups who will find ways to exploit any sort of smart contract flaw in a permissionless web3 application. Bridges, because of their complexity and the high value of fund movements, appear to be more prone to attacks than many other application types.\n\nThe biggest DeFi hack ever was a bridge attack tied to Ether. Over 170,000 Ether, worth ~US$600 million was lost during the Ronin bridge hack. Ronin is the native blockchain of the popular NFT-based game Axie Infinity. Many users swap between Ronin and Ethereum to cash out winning or deploy earnings.\n\nBearish \u2013 Ethereum\u2019s \u2018invisible tax\u2019 \u2013 MEV\n\nThere are other attack vectors that have become very specifically tied to Ethereum, namely Maximal Extracted Value (MEV). MEV has been described as one of Ethereum\u2019s biggest threats. It affects decentralization and the bottom line of honest users.\n\nMEV refers to the maximum value that can be extracted from block production in excess of the standard block reward and gas fees by including, excluding, and changing the order of transactions in a block. By reordering transactions, value can be lost or gained by small amounts each time that steadily accrue. In 2022, according to Eigen Research MEV bots generated revenue of at least $307 million on Ethereum. This revenue was taken from honest everyday users which is why MEV is often called the invisible tax.\n\nIn today\u2019s Ethereum, Validators (previously miners) have the power to reorder or select transactions waiting in the mempool. The mempool can be described as the viewable pool of transactions submitted to a blockchain network that is valid and waiting to be added to the chain by miners or validators.\n\nIndependent network participants known as \"searchers\" are core to how MEV manipulators capture value. Searchers run complex algorithms that will seek out MEV opportunities across Ethereum and have bots automatically submit those profitable transactions to the network. An example of an MEV profit opportunity may be DEX arbitrage or a flash loan opportunity. DEX arbitrage would for example entail a difference in the exchange rate between an ETH/AXIE pair between two exchanges on Ethereum.\n\nMEV bots will pay extra to validators to process transactions that capture their profit opportunity first from the mempool before it dissipates. The MEV landscape is competitive and searchers are willing to pay up to 90% of the revenue they may gain from vectors like DeFi arbitrage. Searchers and validators both earn from this process but users on the applications like traders, stakers, and liquidity providers tend to lose out.\n\nIt should be noted that other smart contract blockchains with DeFi arbitrage and other application-based MEV opportunities like Solana also suffer from MEV challenges.\n\nThere is also a danger that MEV bots are censoring Ethereum transactions. A number of MEV bot services work by building proposer/block-builder separation (PBS) tooling.\n\nA block proposer, or Ethereum validator in a proof-of-stake network, can increase their ETH staking rewards by up to 60% by selling blockspace to a pool of block builders. The separation of Block proposers and block builders is a technical solution implemented post-merge.\n\nThe problem to some with many PBS-based MEV bots, including industry leader Flashbots, is that they openly state they will refuse to include transactions deemed to be forbidden by the USA\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). This can include transactions that are a part of the Tornado Cash mixing service built to make Ethereum transactions more private and less traceable. There is evidence to suggest that Tornado Cash was used by Money Launderers and Cyber Criminals from nations like North Korea.\n\n31% of the Ethereum blocks in the last month have been OFAC compliant.\n\nNeutral: Ethereum is just a higher beta version of Bitcoin\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin are fundamentally different assets but they are strongly correlated.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum allow users to exchange value without payment providers or banks. Ethereum, however, differs because it allows application developers to build decentralized applications. It is able to do this because it supports more complex, programmable transactions than Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum\u2019s value proposition is much broader than Bitcoin\u2019s and covers the range of Web3 including DeFi, NFTs, Metaverse projects, and new token launches. Bitcoin offers purity, deeper decentralization, a manageable roadmap, and a truly decentralized, public digital currency that has the best chance of being adopted over fiat.\n\nInvestors, however, tend to group Ethereum and Bitcoin together as \u2018risk assets\u2019 or assets with a tendency to fluctuate more than the market baseline. Mainstream investors, both institutional and retail tend to lump the two assets and other digital assets together as \u2018crypto\u2019\n\nParticularly during periods of market turmoil, BTC and Ether tend to be sold together. This may be down to a lack of broad understanding of how the two assets work and their significant differences.\n\nOver the last year, the correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum has hovered between 0.8-0.95. This is objectively high and suggests that the two assets are currently moving in step with each other.\n\nSource: Coinmetrics\n\nBitcoin has outperformed Ethereum and is up ~65.6% year-to-date. The original digital asset has observed greater resilience during the post-April period of bearish market activity. The two assets, however, have broadly shared similar characteristics of record-low volatility this year.\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nAbove are charts for Ethereum and Bitcoin\u2019s Realized Volatility. This is the standard deviation of returns measured against the mean return of a market. High values in realized volatility indicate a phase of high risk in that market.\n\nHere, Glassnode calculates the realized volatility based on daily returns and multiplies it with a factor of sqrt(365) to yield the annualized daily realized volatility over a rolling window of 2 weeks. For both assets, volatility has been muted for most of 2023.\n\nBoth Ethereum and Bitcoin have had to deal with characteristics of an uncertain global macroeconomic environment where it is uncertain whether major economies will face or when interest rate hikes will end. This has reduced mainstream interest in risk assets. Additionally, cyclical interest in blockchain technology has cooled following booms in 2022, not helped by the scandalous Luna/Terra and FTX incidents.\n\nBoth assets and crypto in general, are dealing with lukewarm demand as evidenced by the lower volatility.\n\n**Bullish: The Triple Halving and Ethereum\u2019s Ultrasound Money Characteristics **\n\nIn September 2022, the Merge upgrade was implemented on the Ethereum blockchain. The Ethereum Foundation states that the Merge will be \u2018the most significant upgrade in the history of Ethereum.\u2019 The Merge will witness the joining together or \u2018merging\u2019 of the execution layer, Ethereum as we know it today, with a consensus layer called the Beacon chain.\n\nThe Beacon chain uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus model that will replace the current Proof-of-Work (PoW) model that the mainnet currently uses. The switch to PoS will replace energy-intensive mining, and instead secure the network with staked ETH.\n\nThe bitcoin halving is pivotal in crypto markets because of the strong positive effect it has on the price of BTC. It occurs approximately every 4 years and cuts the supply rate of new Bitcoin in half. The halving reduces the rate of inflation and like clockwork, creates upward price pressure for Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum underwent something similar to a halving type of effect with the transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) leading up to the merge. Calculations from some analysts suggest that the inflation rate cut to Ethereum will be the equivalent of \u201cthree Bitcoin halvings.\u201d\n\nPoS makes securing the network much cheaper than with Proof-of-Work, and because of this, PoS validators are paid far less than PoW miners. Because of Ethereum\u2019s existing free burn model introduced as part of the London Hard Fork and EIP-1559, the supply impact of the Merge is set to be even more exaggerated. With less ETH being issued and the asset now being burnt, the potential for an ETH supply shock was massive.\n\nThe dashboard for Ultrasound.money, gives us insight into the rate of new supply and the simulated rate if Ethereum didn\u2019t switch to Proof-of-Stake.\n\nSource: Ultrasound.money\n\nSource: Ultrasound.money\n\nThe difference in new yearly supply of Ether with the new Proof-of-Stake compared with Proof-of-Work is estimated to be around 94% less.\n\nIf transaction activity is high enough then there is a possibility that Ethereum switches to becoming deflationary, meaning it has a negative inflation rate. This has occurred on numerous occasions in the last year. This should further buoy the price appeal of Ethereum.\n\nOther factors driving the price of Ethereum\n\nBullish\n\nStaking rewards for Ether\n\nCurrently, anyone holding Ether can delegate it to a Validator and earn a share of their Proof-of-Stake consensus earnings. Holders can currently earn ~3.8% on any Ether they stake. ~22% of all Ether is locked into staking. This ratio is low because once Ether is staked it cannot be used for activities like paying for gas. Native staking rewards add more value to a token as a store of value. More Ether staked also restricts the available supply of Ether and increases its supply.\n\nLayer-2 solutions boost the scaling capabilities of Ethereum\n\nLayer 2 refers to any secondary framework or protocol built on top of an existing blockchain that adds features that improve the scaling capabilities of the base chain. Base layer blockchains like Ethereum can slow down and become expensive when they are congested because of events such as popular NFT drops. Layer 2s are booming. The value of assets being deployed onto layer 2 platforms is hitting unprecedented levels in the billions of dollars. Layer-2\u2019s boost the value of networks like Ethereum by moving transactions off them. Ethereum, if layer-2\u2019s continue to flourish, should be in a good position to absorb rising transactions during the next bull run.\n\nBearish\n\nOther Smart contract blockchains pull value away from Ethereum\n\nOther smart contract networks like Solana, Polkadot, and Cosmos offer compelling alternatives to Ethereum. They offer faster and cheaper transactions, alternative architecture, more accessible programming languages for programmers, greater scalability, and many other advantages designed to improve upon Ethereum. Ethereum is the earliest version of blockchain technology and over time new flasher alternatives have and will arrive. This may pull money away from Ether.\n\nIs Ethereum censorship resistant?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, certain MEVbots publicly state they censor transactions that OFAC deems as non-compliant. Beyond this, Ethereum development platforms like Infura and Circle have stated they will ban Ethereum addresses believed to be attached to cyber criminals and illegal activity. Censorship resistance is a core tenant to blockchains and a decentralized ethos. In many users\u2019 views, an entity like OFAC should not decide what is and isn\u2019t allowed on the Ethereum network. If this trend continues Ethereum, may in some way have to pick sides during global conflicts, or will simply have to bend the knee if the US government decides transactions from a particular group should not be published on the network.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum\u2019s narrative in 2023 has played out as a mix of bullish and bearish signals, reflecting the evolving nature of this pioneering blockchain platform. The ecosystem\u2019s resilient development community, institutional interest, and cutting-edge upgrades like the Merge have solidified its position in the rapidly evolving digital landscape. Ethereum\u2019s adaptability and integration with Layer-2 solutions illustrate a blockchain that\u2019s not static but evolving, indicative of its potential to scale and adapt.\n\nHowever, this optimism is tempered by existing vulnerabilities, notably security challenges and the contentious issue of MEV \u2013 an \u2018invisible tax\u2019 that threatens user experience and the blockchain\u2019s decentralized ethos. The platform\u2019s correlation with Bitcoin underscores its susceptibility to broader market sentiments and macroeconomic factors, painting a picture of a digital asset still in the throes of maturation. Whether Ethereum is now censorship resistant because of its clear OFAC compliance approach will divide opinions but it is ultimately turning many original users away from the network who initially joined it because it promised a more free internet.\n\nThe future of Ethereum is likely not going to be linear. Investor sentiment is likely to continue to ebb and flow. Ethereum, however, remains central to the conversations and innovations shaping the future of the digital economy."

        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation exchanged 1700 ETH on Uniswap for $2.738 million worth of USD Coin (USDC) today, Oct. 9., at an average price of $1,611, according to on-chain data.\n\nIn the trading day since, ETH saw its price tumble as low as $1,553 before seeing a slight recovery to $1,577, where it stood at press time.\n\nThe Arkham Intelligence dashboard reveals that the Foundation received 1,700 ETH from a Gnosis Safe Proxy wallet. This ETH was subsequently converted into stablecoin via the Uniswap decentralized exchange (DEX). Later, the Foundation returned $3.23 million in USDC to the Gnosis wallet.\n\nThe Arkham Intelligence dashboard reveals that the Foundation holds digital assets worth $454,482 in its wallet, including 240.68 ETH valued at $390,000, 3.238 million USDC, 49,700 DAI, and 10,000 ARB tokens worth $8500.\n\nButerin\u2019s dumping spree\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation transactions are coming on the heels of similar moves made by the blockchain network\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin.\n\nOn Oct. 7, on-chain analyst Lookonchain reported that an address \u201c0xD04daa\u201d related to Buterin transferred 1000 units of ETH (worth $1.64 million) into Bitstamp, a centralized crypto exchange.\n\nAccording to the analyst, the same address has deposited 4,400 ETH, more than $7 million to Bitstamp in the last two months.\n\nBefore that, CryptoSlate had also reported that the Ethereum co-founder had consistently transferred his ETH holding to exchanges at different periods this year.\n\nFor context, Buterin sent over 1,000 ETH to exchanges, unknown addresses, and a Gnosis Safe Proxy wallet during a seven-day period in September. Before that, he had transferred 600 Ether to Coinbase in August and 200 ETH to Kraken in March.\n\nDespite these recent sales, Buterin still maintains a significant Ethereum holding. Data from the Arkham Intelligence dashboard reveals his ownership of approximately 250,000 ETH units, valued at around $400 million, within his cryptocurrency wallet."

        "content": "Ethereum Foundation swaps $27 million worth of ETH on Uniswap.\n\nEther\u2019s price experienced a sharp decline following the transaction.\n\nThe crypto community is closely monitoring the situation.\n\nJust as in traditional markets, supply and demand rule crypto. Most recently, the Ethereum Foundation, the largest holder of ETH, has performed a significant sale of tokens. This sale, used to finance its operations, has had a noticeable impact on the price of ETH.\n\nEthereum Foundation Sends ETH Tumbling\n\nOn Monday, October 9, 2023, the Ethereum Foundation, a key organization within the Ethereum ecosystem, executed a large-scale Ether swap on the Uniswap decentralized exchange. This move involved transferring $27 million worth of ETH, which impacted the crypto market.\n\nNotably, the transaction caused a drop in the value of ETH. On Monday, the price of ETH dropped by 2% and traded at $1,589.52. This has brought the market cap of the second-largest crypto down to $191.09 billion.\n\nAt the same time, the major transaction coincided with a surge in trading volume. ETH trading volume was up 59.89% in the last 24 hours and reached $4.71 billion.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Correction is Likely Temporary\n\nWhile the recent 2% drop in Ethereum\u2019s price may raise concerns among investors and traders, it\u2019s important to emphasize that this is likely a short-term adjustment rather than a reflection of Ethereum\u2019s long-term potential. Such corrections are not uncommon in the cryptocurrency market, where price volatility is a defining characteristic.\n\nOne key aspect to consider is that the Ethereum Foundation, like many blockchain organizations, periodically sells tokens to fund its operations and support the development of the Ethereum platform. The $27 million ETH swap on Uniswap may be part of the Foundation\u2019s financial strategy to ensure its sustainability and ongoing contributions to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThese token sales can create short-term fluctuations in price, as they introduce additional supply to the market. However, it\u2019s crucial to recognize that they are typically executed with the broader goal of bolstering the network, advancing technological improvements, and promoting Ethereum\u2019s long-term viability.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nIn the past, the Ethereum Foundation has faced criticism for its influence over the Ethereum network. For instance, the US Securities and Exchange Commission considers Ethereum a security .\n\nRecent reports suggest that Ethereum\u2019s next major upgrade may face delays, raising questions about the network\u2019s ability to meet its scalability and performance goals.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nFor crypto traders and enthusiasts, staying informed about developments like the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s token swaps and their impact on prices is vital. These events can present trading opportunities and risks, and being aware of them can help you make informed investment decisions.\n\nRead more about Ethereum\u2019s latest upgrade:\n\nEthereum\u2019s Next Major Upgrade Likely to Be Delayed: Core Devs\n\n\n\nRead more about the biggest crypto options exchange:\n\nDeribit Adds SOL, XRP, MATIC, Despite Market Downturn"

Discover SCENE\n\nAscending to 61% of all transactions, Ethereum\u2019s Layer-2 networks were home to a majority share of activity in the third quarter, according to Messari\u2019s latest State of Ethereum report.\n\nKunal Goel, senior research analyst for Messari, wrote that the surge was spawned by the explosive launch of Base\u2014which briefly overtook the number of transactions happening on Ethereum's mainnet\u2013along with the unexpected popularity of the Friend.tech social token platform.\n\nGoel said he was actually caught off guard by the aforementioned combination. \u201cThe most impressive thing is Base's quick growth and how just one app can turn things around for any blockchain,\u201d he told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe explained that new chains \u201ccan suffer from a cold start problem,\u201d but thankfully for Base, Friend.tech helped onboard a lot of users and funds. \u201cUsers need developers to make good apps, and developers need users to want to launch apps,\u201d Goel said, adding, \"it's very good for Base that Friend.tech chose it for launch.\u201d\n\nThe analyst remains cautious, however. \u201cIt is still a bear market, and interest and enthusiasm across the board is low.\u201d\n\nIncubated by Coinbase, Base has seen impressive growth since its launch in early August, which reports a total value locked (TVL) of $448 million, according to a Dune dashboard by 21.co. This firmly places it in the top four layer-2 solutions, behind Arbitrum, Optimism and zkSync Era.\n\nArbitrum continues to be the most utilized by Ethereum users, with 600,000 average daily transactions, offering a 200,000 margin from the main competitors mentioned by Messari: Base and Optimism. These two, wrote Goel, have \u201ccannibalized\u201d Arbitrum\u2019s network activity, with transactions dropping 36% during the third quarter.\n\n21.co\u2019s Dune dashboard reveals an important lead for Arbitrum in terms of TVL, as well. Its $4.22 billion is nearly threefold that of Optimism, which lands in second, at $1.27 billion. That said, both have been flipping their market capitalizations of late, and according to Coingecko, the former leads with a $30 million margin, sitting currently at $1.067 billion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs per Goel, the fact that Layer-2s are taking the lead in terms of transaction throughput is not surprising. He told Decrypt that \u201cthe longer-term view has always been that L2 transactions will overtake Ethereum's,\u201d adding, \u201cit was clear during the bull market of 2020-21 that Ethereum mainnet's block space alone wasn't going to be enough.\u201d\n\nThe view resonated with Eliezer Ndinga, head of research for 21.co. He told Decrypt that his company had predicted this to be the trend, since \u201cblockchains are quite limited in scale.\u201d\n\nNdinga explained that these scaling solutions are \u201canalogous to how bandwidth pushed the boundaries of what\u2019s possible on the Internet from the era of dial-up where web pages were taking minutes to load on a web browser.\u201d\n\nThe analyst bullishly called these layer-2s \u201ca force to be reckoned with,\u201d especially as \u201creputable financial institutions\u201d start to adopt the technology.\n\nWhat Goel unveiled today has him bullish\u2013as it should the Ethereum community at large. \u201cThe greater activity there is on L2s, the higher their market caps, the higher security they want from Ethereum, and higher demand for Ethereum's data availability service,\u201d he told Decrypt.\n\nHe also shared what \u201cthe biggest thing\u201d to watch is: how much cheaper L2s can get after the Dencun upgrade, and \u201conce they get cheaper,\u201d how much more activity they will see.\n\n\u201cMy long-term view is that all DEX trades should move to L2s as lower transaction fees help the most with high-velocity transactions,\u201d he concluded."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst is doubling down on his prediction for Ethereum (ETH), the top smart contract platform by market cap.\n\nIn a new strategy session, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen tells his 787,000 YouTube subscribers that Ethereum is likely to collapse by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cI think Ethereum returns home before it goes on any sustained bull run. A lot of people got excited \u2013 I mean, they can get excited all they want about this rally. It\u2019s still just a 2X move. You can celebrate a 2X move if you want, but you can get that in the stock market pretty easily. I mean, a lot of stocks do 2X moves\u2026\n\nYou ride a 50X move up, and then, you know, you take a side, whether you\u2019re bullish or bearish, and everyone celebrates $100 moves in either direction. But that\u2019s not what you\u2019re here for. What you\u2019ll notice is that every time Ethereum made a rally to new highs, it did not happen until Ethereum went home first. \u2018Home\u2019 is the lower regression band. Right now, we need to see Ethereum go home for new highs to come.\n\n[We\u2019ve] still got to see ETH go home, my friends, and it hasn\u2019t happened yet. So, I think that it will. And again, you can see on these lower time frames, at least over the last year and a little over a year, that it\u2019s trying to hold those levels. But again, at some point, it likely breaks, and when it does, that\u2019s likely when Ethereum starts to head home.\u201d\n\nAccording to an analysis published almost a year ago, Cowen says \u201chome\u201d for ETH is between $600-$800, where his own version of the logarithmic regression band sits.\n\nCowen says ETH will be coming \u201chome\u201d within the next several months.\n\n\u201cI think the most likely outcome is for Ethereum to drop below $1,200 within the next two and a half months and I mean it could certainly go lower.\u201d\n\nETH is worth $1,572 at time of writing, down 5% in the last week.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Why Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Bitcoin Cash Slumped Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nA divergence appears to be building, at least in Monday's price action, between certain top cryptocurrencies and the broader equity market. While most risk assets declined in morning trading Monday in response to surging oil prices and an escalating conflict in the Middle East, equities recovered during the afternoon, with crypto assets underperforming.\n\nAs of 3 p.m. ET, Ethereum (ETH 6.21%), Dogecoin (DOGE 30.24%), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH 7.31%) had declined 3.3%, 3.6%, and 5.1%, respectively, over the prior 24 hours.\n\nSo what\n\nEthereum's decline appeared to have been driven by more than just macroeconomic factors. News that the Ethereum Foundation (which supports development and innovation on the Ethereum blockchain) had swapped $2.7 million worth of Ethereum for stablecoin USDC (USDC 0.01%) on Monday sent the token lower. While swaps like this have been seen in the past, and are used by the Ethereum Foundation as a way to cover costs, sell-offs typically follow such transactions. This was the case once again on Monday.\n\nInterestingly, both Bitcoin Cash and Dogecoin appear to be increasingly seeing intraday moves that are more correlated with the overall market. Monday's outsized moves in both these tokens indicate investors may be viewing them as ways to play momentum in either direction in the crypto sector. In other words, Dogecoin's status as a meme token and Bitcoin Cash's status as a higher-volatility token could be viewed by traders as making them opportune ways to gain leverage to broader crypto market moves in the near term.\n\nNow what\n\nIt's rarely good news to see one of the most sophisticated developers in the crypto sector selling assets to cover its operating costs. And while that's not necessarily a novel concept for investors who follow Ethereum, the market's reaction to this sale speaks volumes about what I think could be a shifting narrative around the sustainability of this space.\n\nFor those looking at the crypto sector as a way to diversify their portfolios, investing in tokens tied to projects that continue to invest in themselves continues to be a good idea. In that regard, this move by the Ethereum Foundation may be viewed in a positive light by those who believe that most of the innovation in this sector continues to come from this blockchain.\n\nFor traders and speculators looking to play the broader moves in this sector (driven by Ethereum and Bitcoin, primarily), altcoins and higher-leverage tokens will always be around to trade. That said, if I had to pick one of these tokens to buy on Monday's decline, it would have to be Ethereum. That's partly because of the aforementioned continued reinvestment into the network's technology, as well as the fact that Ethereum has typically headed higher again in the wake of previous Ethereum Foundation sales."

        "title": "Ethereum Foundation Suffered from MEV Bot Attack in Eth Selling - Blockchain.News",
        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation suffered a Sandwich attack by an MEV Bot during a 1.7k ETH transaction on Uniswap V3, resulting in a $9,101 loss. The incident spotlights the rising menace of MEV exploits and underlines the necessity for enhanced security protocols in blockchain transactions.\n\nThe recent exploit faced by the Ethereum Foundation on the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Uniswap V3 casts a spotlight on the burgeoning issue of Sandwich attacks orchestrated by MEV (Miner Extractable Value) Bots within the blockchain and cryptocurrency domain. According to data unveiled by EigenPhi and shared by WuBlockchain, during a transaction that occurred at 16:18 UTC+8, the Ethereum Foundation endeavored to sell 1,700 ETH on Uniswap V3. However, this transaction was exploited by an MEV Bot, resulting in a loss of $9,101 for the Ethereum Foundation, while the MEV Bot was able to secure a profit of $4,060 after deducting the cost. The malevolent MEV Bot, denoted as (0x00\u20266B40), tactically capitalized on the transaction, shedding light on the imperative need for fortified security measures to avert such financial predations in the future.\n\nThe transaction conducted by the Ethereum Foundation on Uniswap V3 fetched a total of 2.738 million USDC . Following the transaction, the Ethereum Foundation's holdings were detailed as 240.68 ETH, 3.238 million USDC, 49,700 DAI, and 10,000 ARB, collectively valued at $3.687 million. The detailed account of this illicit activity, including the transaction hash, has been meticulously documented and can be referenced on EigenPhi's website. Further specifics regarding the Ethereum Foundation's assets post-transaction have been made available on Arkham Intelligence\u2019s platform.\n\nRead more: What is MEV Bot?\n\nThe term 'Sandwich attack' denotes a particularly malevolent activity within the blockchain community. In a Sandwich attack, a nefarious actor places a buy order, followed by a sell order, surrounding a victim's transaction. This tactic is employed to momentarily manipulate the price of the asset being traded to the perpetrator's advantage, facilitating a scenario where the attacker can buy low and sell high within a very short timeframe, thereby securing a profit at the victim\u2019s expense. The term \"Sandwich\" is derived from the attacker's orders enveloping or \"sandwiching\" the victim's transaction, hence its nomenclature.\n\nThe exploit underscores a growing concern within the blockchain and cryptocurrency realm. The MEV Bot-driven Sandwich attack on the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s transaction highlights the continual threat that MEV exploits pose to decentralized exchanges and the broader DeFi ecosystem. This incident brings to the forefront the urgent need for enhanced security protocols to mitigate the risks associated with MEV exploits and to foster a more secure transaction environment for all participants. The rising menace of MEV exploits and the resultant financial losses beckon a call for action towards the implementation of more robust security measures to safeguard against such malicious financial activities in the blockchain space.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nIt has been nearly two years since the Bitcoin upgrade that introduced Ordinals.\n\nAs the network has evolved, new use cases have expanded.\n\nToday, Bitcoin developers are working on new applications.\n\nThese may give the blockchain Ethereum-style capabilities.\n\nMany often credit Bitcoin Ordinals with significantly boosting the transaction volume on the Bitcoin network. Now, nearly 2 years after the upgrade that first enabled Ordinals, developers are using the technology to build Ethereum-style capabilities into the blockchain.\n\nBut with Ethereum advancing its own roadmap toward greater transaction volumes and more complex on-chain functions, does Bitcoin need to keep up?\n\nHow Ordinals Have Already Changed Bitcoin\n\nFirst introduced in November 2021, Bitcoin Ordinals enable the numbering, identification, and inscription of individual Satoshis, each representing one hundred millionth of a Bitcoin.\n\nThanks to Ordinals, the cost of inscribing data on the Bitcoin blockchain has dramatically reduced, and up to a 4 MB limit, it\u2019s possible to inscribe any kind of data on a single Satoshi.\n\nSince the 2021 upgrade, Ordinals have fueled a surge in activity on the Bitcoin network, driven by the development of new use cases like the BRC-20 NFT standard.\n\nAccording to Dune data, over 35M Ordinals inscriptions have occurred to date. Although the vast majority of these are text-based, more complex data formats have also helped power the surge in Ordinals inscriptions.\n\nOrdinals inscriptions\n\nFor example, users have recorded over 760,000 PNG images and more than 229,000 WEBP images on-chain as Bitcoin Ordinals. Advocates assert that Ordinals play a crucial role in diversifying the functionality of the Bitcoin network and are essential for ensuring its long-term survival.\n\nHowever, not everyone has been happy with Bitcoin\u2019s evolution to embrace a wider variety of transaction types. Purists argue that the blockchain should only be for its original purpose: the peer-to-peer transfer of value.\n\nFacing a slew of Bitcoin-based meme tokens and NFTs, critics have pointed out that transactions stemming from Ordinals inscriptions have occasionally clogged the network, leading to higher fees for users.\n\nIs Bitcoin Due a Layer 2 Revolution?\n\nAs well as expanding the range of Bitcoin token types available, the same upgrade that enabled Ordinals inscriptions is also leading to the development of new off-chain protocols.\n\nFor example, several projects have recently made advances toward realizing the vision of Ethereum-style rollups for Bitcoin.\n\nBy moving computation off-chain, recent innovations by Kasar Labs and Chainway could significantly scale transactions on the Bitcoin network and trigger an L2 revolution akin to Ethereum\u2019s.\n\n1/ We're thrilled to share that we're open-sourcing our Bitcoin Data Availability Adapter which allows Sovereign SDK to be compatible with Bitcoin. This is a crucial step in building our Bitcoin secured rollup \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f\n\nThe significance of this \ud83e\uddf5https://t.co/1dkuVL4Xbj \u2014 Chainway (@chainway_xyz) August 30, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, on October 9, a White Paper for a new system dubbed BitVM was published. The project\u2019s developers claim that BitVM enables the verification of any computable function on Bitcoin. Additionally, unless there are disputes with transactions, the resulting on-chain footprint remains minimal."

ETH failed to settle above the $1,650 level, struggled to clear $1,665, and underperformed vs Bitcoin.\n\nA high was formed near $1,664 before the price saw a fresh decline. It retested the $1,620 support. A low has formed near $1,617 and the price is now attempting another recovery wave. There was a minor increase above the $1,625 level.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $1,640 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support near $1,620 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nOn the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,640 level or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,664 swing high to the $1,617 low.\n\nThe next major resistance is $1,650 or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,664 swing high to the $1,617 low. The main resistance is still near the $1,665 level. A close above the $1,665 resistance might send the price toward the key resistance at $1,750.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nTo start a decent upward move, Ether must settle above the $1,720 and $1,750 levels. The next key resistance might be $1,850. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $1,920.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,665 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,620 level. The next key support is $1,600.\n\nThe first major support is now near $1,585. A downside break below the $1,585 support might start another strong decline. In the stated case, the price could revisit the $1,540 level. Any more losses may perhaps send Ether toward the $1,500 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,600\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,665\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

A peek into the foundation's wallet reveals a balance of 240.68 ETH, 3.238 million USDC, 49,700 DAI and 10,000 ARB, bringing their total assets to a cool $3.687 million.\n\nBut what exactly is a sandwich attack? For the uninitiated, a sandwich attack is a form of front-running tactic used in the world of decentralized exchanges. In this strategy, a malicious actor spots a pending transaction on the Ethereum network and quickly places their own transaction with a higher gas fee, ensuring it gets processed first.\n\nThey then place another transaction right after the target transaction, effectively \"sandwiching\" the original transaction. This allows the attacker to manipulate the price in a way that they can profit from the victim's trade.\n\nThe fact that the Ethereum Foundation, a central entity in the Ethereum space, fell victim to such an attack raises eyebrows. It brings forth questions about the security measures in place and the vulnerabilities that exist even for seasoned players in the crypto arena.\n\nInterestingly, there is a pattern observed on Ethereum Foundation's sales. It often liquidates Ethereum just before significant sell-offs occur. While it is speculative to draw conclusions, the timing of its sales in relation to market movements has not gone unnoticed by keen market observers."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been experiencing a challenging phase. The once-thriving DeFi and NFT sectors, which significantly contributed to Ethereum's meteoric rise, are currently subdued. The buzz and activity around these sectors have dwindled, leading to a noticeable decline in Ethereum's trading volume.\n\nFurthermore, the concept of Ethereum as \"ultrasound money\" is facing scrutiny. Touted as a deflationary asset due to the EIP-1559 upgrade, which introduced a mechanism to burn a portion of the transaction fees, Ethereum's current state suggests otherwise. The deflationary pressures are not as pronounced as many had anticipated, leading to questions about its long-term economic model.\n\nAmid these challenges, Ethereum has found itself at a relatively unnoticeable support level. This support, often overlooked in favor of more prominent price points, could play a pivotal role in determining ETH's trajectory in the coming weeks. If Ethereum manages to hold above this level, it could provide the foundation for a potential rebound. Conversely, a breach below could exacerbate the bearish sentiment.\n\nThe importance of this hidden support is magnified by the broader market context. With the overall trading volume on the decline and the DeFi and NFT landscapes not providing the bullish impetus they once did, Ethereum needs all the support it can get, both technically and sentimentally.\n\nShiba Inu remains oppressed\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) has been facing a challenging period recently. The token's price dynamics have been less than favorable, raising concerns among its vast community of holders.\n\nAt the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00000693, a value that is significantly suppressed from its all-time highs. A detailed analysis of its price movement reveals that SHIB is currently moving below the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a technical indicator that often provides insights into an asset's momentum. The position below this EMA suggests that SHIB is heavily suppressed and is currently in a downtrend.\n\nThe downtrend is further emphasized by the lack of attempts from the token to break through and reclaim higher levels. The 21 EMA acts as a dynamic resistance, and SHIB's consistent position below it indicates a strong bearish grip on its price action.\n\nAnother concerning factor for Shiba Inu's potential recovery is its trading volume. A robust trading volume often signifies strong interest and activity around an asset, which can be a precursor to significant price movements. However, in the case of SHIB, the trading volume is at an extremely low level. This diminished trading activity suggests a lack of buying interest, which can further dampen any hopes of a swift price recovery.\n\nSolana remains solid\n\nNot all setbacks are created equal, and Solana's (SOL) recent dip in price is one that should not raise too many alarms for investors.\n\nA detailed analysis of Solana's price reveals that the cryptocurrency is still one of the strongest performers on the market. Currently trading at $22.93, Solana has only seen a slight decline of a little over 7% in the past few days. This is a modest dip, especially when compared to other assets in the crypto space that have experienced losses of around 15% from their recent highs.\n\nThe resilience of Solana can be attributed to its robust ecosystem and the growing interest in its platform. As decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi projects continue to find a home on Solana, the demand for SOL, its native token, remains high. This demand acts as a buffer, preventing drastic price drops and ensuring stability even in turbulent market conditions.\n\nAnother positive sign for Solana is the decreasing trading volume. While a drop in trading volume can be a cause for concern in some scenarios, in this case, it is a silver lining. The reason being that Solana is currently bearish on more local time frames but remains bullish on longer-term charts. A decrease in trading volume during a short-term bearish phase can indicate a lack of strong selling pressure, which can pave the way for a potential rebound."

        "content": "The price of Ethereum has experienced a notable decline following a major Ether sale this week. The unexpected decrease has left the crypto community anxious about the stability of the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency and the long-term effects of the decline.\n\nEthereum Price Drops After Large-Scale Ether Swap\n\nOn Monday, October 9, the price of Ethereum declined following an extensive Ether swap by the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit community-run organization dedicated to enabling better human coordination.\n\nThe Ether transaction which took place on Uniswap, a decentralized crypto exchange platform, saw the ETH price drop 5% from its daily high of $1,635 to a local low of $1,553 before recovering once more.\n\nAccording to Arkham data, the Ethereum Foundation swapped approximately 1,700 ETH worth $2.7 million to a single wallet address which contained almost $400,000 worth of cryptocurrencies and was titled \u2018Grant Provider\u2019 by Etherscan.\n\nThe specific intentions behind the large-scale swap have not been disclosed by the Ethereum Foundation. However, the Ethereum Foundation, an organization that holds a considerable influential position, regularly swaps large amounts of tokens to fund its operations.\n\nPresently, Ethereum is trading at a price value of 1589.36 after recovering from the initial decline. The steep decline has left the crypto community worried about the health of the cryptocurrency and whether the price of Ethereum would recover.\n\nETH price recovers after 5% decline | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nETH Whales Dump $8.5 Billion\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has not been the only large wallet to sell in recent times as other ETH whales have taken advantage of the altcoin\u2019s price. According to crypto analyst Ali Charts on X, ETH whales dumped a whopping $8.5 billion worth of tokens.\n\nThis large selling started in February this year and has continued into October. As a result, the whale selling has seen over 5 million ETH sold and redistributed over this 8-month period. The analyst also points out that \u201cthis selling trend continues with no current indication of a shift towards #ETH accumulation yet.\u201d\n\nETH whales dump 5 million tokens | Source: X\n\nCompared to its all-time high of $4891.70 in 2021, the price of ETH has dropped by more than half and has been struggling to reclaim the $2,000 mark. However, this could present a unique buying opportunity for investors who could see the price decline as ETH being on discount.\n\nNevertheless, Ethereum continues to hold its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency in the market with a market cap of $191.5 billion at the time of writing. Over the last day, the altcoin has also seen some recovery, rising to $1,593 as bulls gear up to retest the $1,600 resistance.\n\nFeatured image from Techopedia, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum's co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently discussed potential protocol and staking pool changes for the Ethereum network, suggesting they could enhance decentralization and efficiency. However, his comments have drawn criticism from Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, and other members of the Cardano community.\n\nIn his post on X, Hoskinson took a not-so-veiled jab at Buterin by attaching an animated GIF of actor Christian Bale and Muppet Kermit the Frog nodding at one another.\n\nCopycat accusations\n\nButerin's posts detailed how modifications in staking design could benefit users who lack the resources to solo-stake, allowing them more involvement in staking and consensus decision-making. Additionally, the changes could reduce the consensus layer's operational burden, further decentralizing the Ethereum network.\n\nIn response, the Cardano community accused Ethereum of attempting to emulate Cardano's long-standing features.\n\nSome of them posted that Cardano had pioneered liquid staking and delegating to pools for consensus years ago, boasting about Cardano's uptime and decentralization metrics.\n\nEthereum was mocked for \"dressing up as Cardano for Halloween\" by allegedly copying its long-established features.\n\nUnhealthy obsession?\n\nThe community's reaction to the latest tweet was rather mixed. Some agreed with Hoskinson, but others questioned the focus Cardano's community places on Ethereum.\n\nInquisitor Glokta, a Cardano supporter, expressed frustration, noting that the Cardano community seems more engrossed in Ethereum's actions than in their own developments.\n\nHe highlighted that Buterin rarely, if ever, comments on Cardano, hinting at a possible \"inferiority complex.\"\n\nHowever, Hoskinson stands by his comments. \"They literally just admitted they need to copy Ouroboros,\" he responded."

        "content": "BitVM will enable sophisticated smart contracts on Bitcoin .\n\nThe BitVM proposal relies on off- chain processes .\n\nSeveral limitations require ironing out.\n\nBitcoin launched in 2009 as a response to the broken fiat money system, paving the way for countless other digital assets to make their mark. Over a decade on, there\u2019s no denying that Bitcoin\u2019s technical capabilities now pale against that of second and third-generation blockchains.\n\nDespite its technological shortcomings, Bitcoin remains the most decentralized and trusted protocol, securing its position as the top cryptocurrency in the market. However, in a bid for the best of both worlds, developer Robin Linus has proposed a groundbreaking upgrade that could revolutionize Bitcoin\u2019s technical capabilities, potentially rendering altcoins obsolete.\n\nDo Anything on Bitcoin\n\nOn October 9, Linus published a whitepaper titled \u201cBitVM: Compute Anything on Bitcoin\u201d, which detailed proposals for enhancing Bitcoin\u2019s technical capabilities and functionality without requiring a fork of the code or changes to the consensus rules, thus preserving Bitcoin\u2019s integrity.\n\nAccording to the white paper, the basic architecture of the upgrade moves computational load off the technologically limited base layer, relying instead on the off-chain interaction between a prover and a verifier. The prover claims a function produces a specific output for certain inputs while the verifier assesses the prover\u2019s claim.\n\n\u201cAs long as both parties collaborate, they can perform arbitrarily complex, stateful off-chain computation, without leaving any trace in the chain,\u201d read the BitVM whitepaper.\n\nCurrent Bitcoin smart contract capabilities are reduced to basic metadata, such as signatures and time locks. Still, BitVM enables a more expressive smart contract design, opening up new possibilities, including games, proof verification, bridges, and prediction markets. Nonetheless, BitVM faces several technical and practical challenges to overcome.\n\nChallenges and Limitations\n\nDetailing the limitations, Linus mentioned that BitVM could be more efficient by utilizing Bitcoin\u2019s higher-level operations, including script support for 32-bit numbers and fully using each block\u2019s 4MB capacity.\n\nFurther limitations lie in the model\u2019s two-party setup of prover and verifier. However, Linus revealed that research is underway to extend the system to include more participants, including exploring the possibility of chaining two-way channels together.\n\nBitcoin developer \u201cBob Bodily\u201d waded into the discussion to voice multiple drawbacks with BitVM, including it being slower, more expensive, and more complicated than Ethereum\u2019s virtual machine (EVM).\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nBitcoin has a history of proposals that struggle to gain traction , such as OKX \u2019s BRC-30 token standard .\n\nAlts provide a ground-up design to accommodate sophisticated functionality, whereas BitVM approaches the issue as an afterthought.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nSome have criticized Bitcoin as an inflexible protocol that cannot evolve. However, BitVM is challenging this notion and demonstrating that Bitcoin has the potential to compete with other cryptocurrencies in terms of functionality.\n\nFind out more details on CZ\u2019s post-halving Bitcoin price prediction here:\n\nCZ Forecasts Bitcoin\u2019s Next Future Peak: Here\u2019s When\n\n\n\nDiscover why the community is pushing back against THORSwap reinstating swap functionality here:\n\nTHORSwap Token Swaps Return, But at What Cost?"

This proposal highlights how BitVM can help the BTC network facilitate Turing-complete contracts without disrupting the original protocol.\n\nBitVM opens the door to more versatile Bitcoin contracts previously believed to require a soft fork for implementation. In simple terms, Linus said the technology would allow \u201cany computable function to be verified on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe BitVM creates a novel design space for more expressive Bitcoin contracts and also off-chain computation.\u201d\n\nTechnically, BitVM shares similarities with Ethereum\u2019s Optimistic Rollups in utilizing fraud proofs and a challenge-response protocol. It employs a prover and verifier system, enabling the verifier to scrutinize and penalize the prover for making false claims.\n\nFurthermore, the white paper envisions that BitVM would expand Bitcoin\u2019s computing capabilities beyond its traditional functions, including signatures, timelocks, and hash locks. It would introduce new functions such as supporting applications like Chess, Go, or Poker and verifying the validity of proofs in Bitcoin contracts.\n\nWhat are Bitcoiners saying?\n\nThe crypto community has reacted to the BitVM proposal with mixed feelings. Major stakeholders, including Tether\u2019s (USDT) CTO Paolo Ardoino, have expressed optimism about the development, while some have raised questions about it.\n\nVenture capital firm Paradigm researcher, Dan Robinson, pointed out a limitation of BitVM to be that \u201cit can\u2019t be used in rollups or other multiparty applications\u201d because it \u201conly works for two parties.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, an Ethereum enthusiast, Ryan Berckmans, said:"

Yesterday marked a notable sell-off in altcoins, encompassing all cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin. This sell-off has led to Binance Coin (BNB) and Ethereum (ETH) reaching new lows against Bitcoin this cycle.\n\nWhen evaluated in terms of USD, Binance Coin hit $208 for the third time. The Ethereum to Bitcoin ratio plunged to an all-time low of $0.057. Interestingly, Ethereum\u2019s USD-denominated value avoided hitting a new low, holding steady above its previous low of $1,544 in September.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin has been steadily amplifying its market cap dominance, now accounting for more than 51%, and seems to be approaching a new cycle high. This shift indicates a possible investor preference towards Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest and most established cryptocurrency, over its smaller counterparts like Ethereum and Binance Coin."

A total of 1,700 ETH was sold for 2.738 million USDC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sale was made at $1,611 per coin. Currently, ETH is changing hands at $1,590. Curiously, right after the sale, the ETH price slipped by 1.45%. Overall, today, the second-largest digital currency dropped nearly 3%, falling from $1,636 to the $1,591 level on the Bitstamp exchange.\n\nEthereum and the majority of other altcoins are currently going down, following the Bitcoin price dropping from $27,790 to the $27,500 zone.

        "title": "Are Ethereum ETFs Already A Failure? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Despite the highly anticipated launch of Ethereum ETFs in the United States, hopes of a significant boost to Ethereum price have remained unfulfilled as the cryptocurrency continues to underperform Bitcoin (BTC). But, is this a short term trend and is there a comeback around the corner?\n\nBitcoin Outperforms Ethereum Despite Ether ETFs\n\nIn a blog post on Monday, crypto research firm Kaiko analyzed this trend, highlighting what could have caused Ether\u2019s weakness. Notably, last week marked the launch of six futures-based ETH ETFs on U.S. markets, following an earlier-than-expected approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, these ETFs failed to generate significant trading volume or provide the anticipated boost to the overall crypto market.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAccording to Kaiko, among these newly launched ETFs by VanEck and ProShares, the two largest by trade volume struggled to achieve an average daily trade volume of just $0.5 million during their initial week of trading.\n\nIn contrast, the first Bitcoin futures ETF, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy (BITO), attracted more than $1 billion in trade volume on its debut day. The firm attributes the dull response to launch of Ethereum ETFs to the prevailing market conditions, marked by a September surge in risk-free rates driven by robust U.S. economic data and escalating macroeconomic uncertainties. These factors, it noted, have diminished interest in riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum\u2019s underperformance compared to the broader crypto market has also been evident since \u201cthe Merge\u201d with the ETH/BTC price ratio and volume being on a downward trend over the past year.\n\n\u201cETH\u2019s underperformance is likely due to the ongoing impact of the bear market, which historically has seen traders turn to BTC, the oldest and largest crypto asset,\u201d Kaiko wrote.\n\nAdditionally, despite the increase in open interest for ETH perpetual futures since early September, funding rates have also stayed neutral to negative, indicating a lack of clear market direction.\n\nAre Institutions Buying Ether ETFs?\n\nHowever, Kaiko noted that even though ETH futures ETFs did not attract significant trading volume, they still provide a liquid, cost-efficient, and transparent way for investors to gain exposure to Ethereum. This could potentially alter institutional investors\u2019 perceptions of ETH, which currently remains strongly correlated with BTC, despite their conceptual differences.\n\nMeanwhile, ETH extended its losses on Monday, after shedding approximately 7% over the past week to reach a trading price of $1,569. This contrasts BTC which was trading at $27,401 after losing just 2.22% over the same period."

Can y00ts make a comeback with its Ethereum move?\n\ny00ts Floor Jumps 2.2%\n\nIn a series of announcements on Sunday, October 8, DeLabs co-founder Rohun Vora, also known as Frank, disclosed that the migration of y00ts to Ethereum will begin this week, adding that holders can port their collectibles for free.\n\nAmid the announcement, the floor price for NFTs in the collection sits at 0.822 ETH, representing a 2.2% gain in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko at the time of writing.\n\nBut while the jump in floor price suggests potential excitement about the move, other metrics tell a different story.\n\nMuted Activity\n\nDespite the recent spike in floor price, the collection has not witnessed any trading activity in the past 24 hours, according to CryptoSlam data at the time of writing. Furthermore, the data suggests that activity surrounding the collection has declined for the past 30 days, with the sales volume at $655,612, representing a 78% slump.\n\nThe data sharply contrasts the initial surge in activity surrounding the collection when DeLabs announced the move in August 2023. At the time, y00ts sales volume surged by a whopping 278%. The current decline in activity suggests that not much is going on despite the planned migration, but it would be interesting to see if this changes as the migration enters full swing.\n\ny00ts\u2019 Ethereum migration is the collection\u2019s second in less than a year.

ETH would have to increase by 9.64% to hit our $ 1,757.01 target within the next five days. Moving forward, it will be important to monitor the ETH market sentiment, the key support and resistance levels, and other metrics. However, we have to keep in mind that the cryptocurrency markets are unpredictable, and even the largest crypto assets display a lot of price volatility.

        "title": "Ethereum's Centralization Concerns Rise Post-Merge and Shanghai, Says New Report - Blockonomi",
        "content": "Is Ethereum becoming more centralized after two major upgrades?\n\nA recent research analyzes the effect of The Merge and Shanghai. JPMorgan\u2019s new report shed light on Ethereum\u2019s greater centralization after The Merge and Shanghai, the two major upgrades of the network in a year.\n\nAccording to the insight, the transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake has seen a surge in Ethereum staking. However, this has led to a decline in the overall staking yield and the growing centralization.\n\nPeople don\u2019t want highly centralized systems, but it looks like Ethereum is going in that direction.\n\nGreater Centralization, Less Yield\n\nAs reported, the total staking yield for Ethereum has decreased to around 5.5%. Before the Shanghai upgrade, this figure stands at 7.3%.\n\nLido Finance is a go-to alternative for interested people who want to stake Ethereum without relying on a centralized entity. The protocol additionally has taken steps to mitigate centralization concerns by adding more node operators.\n\nHowever, despite Lido\u2019s efforts, there are still centralization risks. Lido currently accounts for \u201calmost one-third\u201d of staking on Ethereum.\n\nThe report noted that a, \u201cconcentrated number of liquidity providers or node operators could act as a single point of failure or become targets for attacks or collude to create an oligopoly that would promote their own interests at the expense of the interests of the community.\u201d\n\nApart from centralization, rehypothecation was also a highlighted risk in the bank\u2019s study. This is a common practice in traditional finance where an asset or collateral is used as collateral for multiple loans or other financial transactions simultaneously.\n\nWhile rehypothecation can reduce the cost of borrowing and increase liquidity in financial markets, it can also amplify risks, especially during periods of financial stress. A recently known example of this risk is the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Co-founder Warns of Liquid Staking\n\nLiquid staking offers a multitude of advantages to both users and the broader blockchain ecosystem. When users stake their tokens, they help make the network safer and earn extra rewards.\n\nPlus, these users retain the flexibility to actively engage in various projects within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. But it comes with high risks.\n\nLido Finance, while not the only platform offering ETH staking through its model, stands out with a substantial million ETH staked, representing approximately one-third of the total ETH staked on the Ethereum consensus layer.\n\nHowever, amassing such a significant portion of staking power raises concerns about increased risk.\n\nThe primary driver behind Lido\u2019s extensive ETH staking is its exceptionally high yield. With various options delivering attractive returns, investors are flocking to stake their ETH on the Lido platform. This influx can lead to an imbalance, particularly when a crisis hits.\n\nEthereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has raised concerns about the dominant role of liquid staking protocols, particularly Lido and Rocket Pool, in the Ethereum staking ecosystem.\n\nHe believes that although there are many validators, these two protocols still pose risks. To address this, he suggests changes to Ethereum itself, including giving more governance power to a small group of stakers.\n\nButerin also discussed the idea of integrating certain protocols and features directly into Ethereum\u2019s source code instead of keeping them separate. He highlighted ERC-4337, an account abstraction standard, as a priority but cautioned that this could be a complex process with potential challenges.\n\nDebates around PoS consensus have circled in the crypto community even before The Merge. Some express concerns that this shift, while aiming to enhance scalability, may compromise the security and decentralization valued in PoW.\n\nPreviously, censorship was a major concern during the transition. Ethereum is now poised for its next major upgrade, called Dencun, anticipated in early 2024."

The largest individual liquidation occurred on Binance, involving the ETH/BUSD pair with a value of $4.53 million.\n\nCoinGlass data reveals that a staggering $105 million of long positions, which were speculative bets on price increases, were entirely wiped out. These liquidations occur when an exchange terminates a leveraged trading position due to either a complete or partial loss of the trader\u2019s initial margin.

        "title": "Ethereum's Supply Flips Inflationary, Adding 30000 ETH in 30 Days - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nOver the past 30 days alone, Ethereum\u2019s token supply has increased by nearly 30,000 ETH, equivalent to over $47 million at current prices, according to data from ultrasound.money. This increase in ETH token supply is partly driven by lower network usage and fees stemming from the adoption of layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions.\n\nAccording to data from L2 analytics L2Beats, scaling solutions have gained significant user adoption and Total Value Locked (TVL). Currently, the TVL of L2 networks amounts to roughly $10.5 billion, more than double that of a year ago.\n\nIn comparison, Ethereum\u2019s TVL dropped more than 30% over the past year from nearly $30 billion to more than $20 billion, according to DefiLlama data.\n\nEther\u2019s deflationary narrative first emerged after the activation of EIP-1559 in August 2021, which introduced a fee-burning mechanism that burns a portion of ETH paid in fees by users. This acted as a deflationary force on ETH\u2019s circulating supply.\n\nEIP-1559, combined with The Merge\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus cut issuance by nearly 90%, significantly reducing Ethereum\u2019s inflation rate. Before The Merge, miners received approximately 13,000 ETH per day as block rewards. Since transitioning to PoS, only around 1,700 ETH is issued per day.\n\nDuring periods of high network usage and congestion, the amount of ETH burned in fees exceeds the new ETH created, slowing supply growth and benefiting prices. However, lower activity means fewer burns, increasing supply and potential inflation.\n\nThe increased supply in the past month can\u2019t be attributed only to low usage though, as Ethereum\u2019s daily active addresses and on-chain transaction volume have held relatively steady this year. The weekly average of daily transactions has increased nearly 7% since the start of the year, while the weekly average on-chain volume has jumped nearly 80% from more than $1 billion to roughly $1.9 billion over the same period, according to data from IntoTheBlock.\n\n."

The associated wallet now holds around $3.7 million in assets, including 240 ETH along with USDC, DAI, and ARB tokens.\n\nThe foundation\u2019s ETH reserves have declined from 395,000 ETH in Q1 2022, equal to 0.3% of total Ethereum supply. However, it still retains substantial holdings.\n\nJUST IN: Ethereum Foundation sold 1,700 ETH for $2.74 million $USDC. \u2014 Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) October 9, 2023\n\nEthereum Foundation\u2019s reasons for ETH sale are unclear\n\nWhile the reasons for the sale are unclear, the converted amount seems to align with funding the foundation\u2019s ongoing operations, including research grants.\n\nIn 2021, total expenses amounted to $48 million, including developer grants aimed at improving Ethereum infrastructure. Ongoing bear market conditions may have necessitated liquidating portions of ETH reserves to maintain funding.\n\nAlso read: Ripple vs. SEC: Lawyer\u2019s Predictions Point to a Potential 2027 Resolution\n\nThe converted ETH amounts to a small fraction of holdings prudently utilized to further Ethereum\u2019s growth during challenging markets.\n\nWhile the Ethereum Foundation still holds substantial assets, its activities are impacted by price declines like any other entity. ETH has dropped below $1,600 at press time, with a 2.4% drop in value over the last 24 hours. According to CoinMarketCap data, ETH is trading at $1,592."

        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nThe crypto market has been sluggish in recent days, with both Bitcoin and Ethereum prices facing significant sell-offs near resistance levels. Although the \u2018Uptober\u2019 trend experienced a revival in the last few days, whale players have not missed any opportunities to book their gains and exit the market profitably. This sentiment has created strong selling pressure and has substantially strengthened the resistance level.\n\nEthereum\u2019s $1,650 Stand Amid The \u2018Uptober\u2019 Mirage\n\nDespite the bullish \u2018Uptober\u2019 predictions that hinted at a bullish October for the crypto market, Ethereum has found itself struggling with bearish domination. The anticipated upward trend, which saw a ray of hope in the initial days of the month, has been now fading due to Ethereum\u2019s bearish price action. One can say that \u2018Uptober\u2019 is now becoming just a mirage.\n\nEthereum\u2019s struggle to maintain trading above the $1,650 mark has been evident amidst a massive selloff by whale investors. This activity has notably weakened buyer confidence, with Coinglass\u2019 liquidation data revealing over $12.5 million in total long-liquidations just minutes after ETH price faltered, failing to hold above $1,630.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock indicates a surge in large transactions yesterday, with whales suddenly becoming active following a $10 drop in ETH price from $1,639 to $1,629. The metric jumped from $1.38 billion to $1.7 billion, marking a $320 million increase. This uptick in large transactions was due to whales executing positions, serving as a key factor in the recent decline and further weakening the support level.\n\nNotably, the Ethereum Foundation, an entity in the development and ecosystem of the Ethereum network, recently divested a portion of its allocated Ether (ETH) tokens. The grant-issuing body executed a sale of 1,700 ETH in exchange for 2.738 million USDC on the decentralized exchange, Uniswap, at 16:18 UTC+8.\n\nWill Bulls Make A Reversal?\n\nEther faced a notable rejection at the resistance of $1,640 after the resistance of $1,650 was weakened. After the price reached a low of $1,585, it experienced a reversal following buyers\u2019 aggressive purchases. Currently, ETH price is trading at $1,594, declining over 2.1% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nThe 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $1,627 is currently displaying a declining trend, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovering around the oversold zone at 31. These indicators collectively suggest a selling sentiment in the market.\n\nHowever, ETH price has initiated a minor rebound from the pattern\u2019s support line. Should the price hold its current momentum, the bulls will make another attempt to breach the immediate resistance at $1,650. A successful breakthrough would result in the ETH price testing the level of $1,744.\n\nConversely, if the price continues to descend and falls below the pattern\u2019s line, it would imply that the price might trigger a bearish consolidation. In this scenario, ETH price might test buyers\u2019 patience at $1,530."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has been at the forefront of the crypto bull run, amassing significant gains in the past year.\n\nHowever, recent trends suggest that its upward trajectory might be under threat. Since February 2023, Ethereum whales, typically large holders with significant influence on market movements, have been consistently cashing in on the elevated prices. Their actions have led to the offloading or redistribution of over 5 million ETH, translating to an approximate value of $8.5 billion.\n\nThis whale-driven exodus is not a fleeting event. Ali Martinez, a noted crypto expert, highlighted on October 10 via X (previously known as Twitter) that there\u2019s a conspicuous absence of any signs indicating a shift toward ETH accumulation.\n\nETH whales selling spree.

Strong support lies at $1,498.81, with resistance hovering around the $1,666.23 mark. While the token has impressed with a 22% growth over the past year, outperforming 84% of the top 100 crypto assets, its recent performance raises eyebrows. Out of the last 30 days, only 16 have been in the green, at 53%, and is currently trading at $1,589.\n\nETH 1 day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAnother alarming signal is Ethereum\u2019s position concerning its 200-day simple moving average\u2014a key metric for understanding long-term market trends. Currently trading below this average, it reflects bearish sentiment. Not to mention Ethereum is also down 67% from its all-time high.\n\nIn the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies, the movements of big players, or \u2018whales\u2019, can often provide early warning signs of impending market shifts.\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s long-term prospects remain promising, given its historical performance and the myriad of real-world applications it supports, the recent actions of whales, coupled with some concerning technical indicators, suggest that investors should proceed with caution.\n\nFor now, the market watches and waits, with many hoping for a return to bullish sentiment soon.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

It launched in 2016 and rose to become a leading altcoin. Currently, Ethereum Classic ranks as a top 30 cryptocurrency by market capitalization, highlighting its influence.\n\nNotably, its value proposition revolves around hosting and supporting decentralized applications (dApps). At the heart of the Ethereum Classic ecosystem is ETC, used to execute transactions and smart contract functions.\n\nHowever, in recent times, there has been a growing exodus of investors. The key factor contributing to this departure is the need for significant ROI on investments.\n\nAave (AAVE): Diversification Grows\n\nAave (AAVE) is a decentralized crypto lending platform. Significantly, it allows users to borrow and lend cryptocurrencies, with smart contracts used to automate this process. Further, Aave specializes in overcollaterized loans, meaning users will deposit more crypto than the amount they wish to borrow.\n\nMoreover, Aave\u2019s unique value proposition makes it a key player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Presently, it is a top 50 cryptocurrency, which underscores its dominance in the broader crypto market.\n\nHowever, after declining by about 90% from its peak, holders are reconsidering their strategy.

Notably, its novel idea, which aims to revolutionize the trading ecosystem, has been met with enthusiasm. Consequently, over $6.4 million has been raised in the ongoing presale, and more than 18,000 users have been onboarded.\n\nIts unique solution in the crypto landscape will be a hybrid trading platform that intersects with centralized and decentralized exchanges. Therefore, users will enjoy the best of both worlds, including anonymity, institutional-level liquidity, and high leverage, to mention a few.\n\nFurthermore, as an all-in-one trading platform, users will be able to trade diverse assets, not limited to cryptocurrencies. As a result, it will enable users to trade stocks, forex, commodities, and other financial instruments, in addition to cryptocurrency. Interestingly, all of this will be on a single account.\n\nMoreover, it will be the only trading platform that allows users to deposit crypto and use it as collateral to trade derivatives without the need for KYC checks. Hence, by providing deep liquidity across thousands of assets and promising full anonymity, Tradecurve Markets is set to disrupt the trading world.\n\nMeanwhile, its ongoing presale offers the opportunity to be an early adopter of the exciting project. The presale phase is currently at stage 6 at a price of only $0.03, which analysts forecast will rise by 100x after launch.

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) and Vechain (VET) Prices Struggling Today, But Sees Bright Future Tomorrow. How High Can Reach ... - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) \u2013 The market sentiment for Ethereum leans towards a \u2018Sell\u2019 with the cryptocurrency showcasing restrained trading movements and indicators suggesting potential uncertainties ahead; it might be a cautious investment.\n\nVeChain (VET) \u2013 VeChain, known for its supply chain solutions, showcases a \u2018Strong Sell\u2019 sentiment and faces market resistance, indicating caution is required for potential investors.\n\nScapesMania \u2013 This emerging coin offers potential high returns, aligns with the massive gaming industry, and showcases significant promise; it\u2019s a good investment.\n\nFollowing a recent market analysis by Enigma Securities, a noted institutional digital asset liquidity and advisory firm, the cryptocurrency sphere appears to be entering a phase of low volatility. The firm\u2019s mid-week report forecasts a period of market consolidation, likely to stretch through the end of October, offering a ripe window for long-term investors to accumulate assets like Ethereum (ETH) and VeChain (VET). This notion was echoed by Vetle Lunde, a senior analyst at K33 Research, who noted a sideways market movement in the near term. Amidst this calm, the CoinDesk Market Index nudged a modest 0.8% higher.\n\nThe traditional markets too, exhibited a semblance of calm following a rough Tuesday session, as fresh jobs data showcased a cooling US labor market. The ADP\u2019s report of 89,000 new jobs in September, significantly below the anticipated 153,000, mirrored the smallest rise in private sector jobs since 2020, according to Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab.\n\nThe crypto market seems to be mirroring this broader financial stability, with Ethereum (ETH) and VeChain (VET) showcasing restrained trading movements. Ethereum (ETH), known for its smart contract functionality, has seen its trading value hover within a range of $1,570 to $1,733. Over the last month, its price edged up by a mere 0.48%, and 0.99% over the last week, reflecting a strong support at the $1,849 mark. Market sentiment for Ethereum (ETH) leans towards a \u2018Sell\u2019, with oscillators indicating a \u2018Neutral\u2019 stance and moving averages suggesting a \u2018Strong Sell\u2019.\n\nOn the other side, VeChain (VET), a blockchain platform designed to enhance supply chain management, has its trading value nestled between $0.0151 and $0.0192. Over the past month, the VeChain (VET) price appreciated by 7.45% and nudged slightly higher by 0.26% over the last week. Similar to Ethereum (ETH), the market sentiment around VeChain (VET) skews towards a \u2018Strong Sell\u2019, with both oscillators and moving averages indicating a selling bias.\n\nExperts opine that this phase of consolidation may extend the opportunity for discerning investors to bolster their crypto portfolios, as the market sentiment hints at a cautious approach. As traditional markets exhibit signs of steadiness, it\u2019s plausible that the crypto realm may follow suit, basking in a period of low volatility and potentially lucrative accumulation windows.\n\nIndeed, Ethereum (ETH) and VeChain (VET) present a solid foundation for portfolio concentration amid this consolidation phase, offering a semblance of stability in a typically volatile market. However, they may not deliver the sharp price escalations akin to promising presale coins like Scapesmania, a project expected to surge by over 500% after listing.\n\nHence, investors should diversify their attention towards such budding projects, which can potentially provide lucrative returns amidst a steady market backdrop. This balanced outlook could navigate through the existing market tranquility while also tapping into the high-reward potential of emerging coins, preparing a well-rounded portfolio for both present stability and future growth.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Forecast\n\nEthereum (ETH), a linchpin for smart contracts and decentralized apps, faces a delicate balance amid market pressures and intrinsic potential. Its price, fluctuating between $1,570 and $1,732, has seen peaks at $1,743 and troughs at $1,077, indicating a volatile ride. Key indicators like the 3-10 Day MACD Oscillator stalling at $1,667 and Price Crossing the 40 Day Moving Average at $1,658 hint at potential uncertainties ahead. The diverging expert forecasts, oscillating between the optimism of a 1-month high rebound and the reality of multiple price stalls, make the Ethereum (ETH) journey a focal point for crypto enthusiasts. As the Ethereum (ETH) future performance may potentially be volatile, it makes sense to consider new evolving contenders like ScapesMania.\n\nVeChain (VET) Price Forecast:\n\nVeChain (VET), known for blockchain-based supply chain solutions, treads a challenging path akin to Ethereum. Its price, ranging between $0.0151 and $0.0191, reflects market caution as it faced resistance at the 40-day moving average of $0.0232, hinting at a pause in bullish momentum. The 3-10-16 Day MACD Moving Average stalling at $0.0196 suggests a potential cooling phase. If VET breaks the 1-month high of $0.0233, it may reignite optimism among proponents, though its proximity to the 52-week low of $0.0153 requires cautious navigation amidst market hurdles.

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nEthereum is known for its high gas fees, which have been a significant roadblock to mainstream adoption. Yet, Ethereum gas prices have dropped to all-time lows in recent days, with the average Ethereum gas price reaching 8.8 gwei this week, surpassing the previous record low of 8.9 gwei set in January 2020, according to Etherscan data.\n\nGwei, short for gigawei, refers to the denomination used to calculate gas fees on the Ethereum network. One gwei is equal to 0.000000001 ETH.\n\nOne reason for lower costs is increased usage of layer 2 scaling solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum, which reduce congestion on the main Ethereum chain by processing transactions off-chain.\n\nEthereum\u2019s scaling solutions have seen a surge in both adoption and value. The total value locked (TVL) in L2 networks has soared to $10.5 billion, more than double from the previous year, according to L2Beat data. In contrast, Ethereum\u2019s TVL has experienced a drop of over 30% in the past year, settling at $20 billion.\n\nAdditionally, transaction volumes and active users on Ethereum have dropped over the past year as the broader crypto market has slumped. This lower demand for block space reduces competition for transactions, allowing fees to drop.\n\nEthereum\u2019s average weekly transactions are down nearly 20% over the last year, while the weekly average number of active Ethereum addresses is also down more than 20%, according to IntoTheBlock data."

        "content": "A Bitcoin developer has proposed a new way to bring more expressive off-chain smart contracts to Bitcoin without needing a soft fork.\n\nAnnounced in an Oct. 9 white paper titled \u201cBitVM: Compute Anything on Bitcoin\u201d by ZeroSync project lead Robin Linus, BitVM enables Turing-complete Bitcoin contracts without altering Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules.\n\n\"Any computable function can be verified on Bitcoin\"https://t.co/Itf9UHos0C pic.twitter.com/CLQv49Ydsg \u2014 \u044fobin linus (@robin_linus) October 9, 2023\n\nA Turing-complete system is one that can theoretically provide an answer to any computational problem.\n\nWith BitVM, the \u201clogic\u201d of Bitcoin contracts would be executed off-chain, but verification would be made on Bitcoin \u2014 similar to Ethereum\u2019s optimistic rollups.\n\nBitVM\u2019s architecture is based on fraud proofs and a challenge-response model where a \u201cprover\u201d can make claims and a \u201cverifier\u201d can perform a fraud proof to punish the prover when false claims are made.\n\nLinus explained that Bitcoin, in its current form, is limited to basic operations, such as signatures, timelocks and hashlocks \u2014 but that can now be broadened with BitVM, which Linus says can compute a host of interesting applications.\n\n\u201cPotential applications include games like Chess, Go, or Poker, and particularly, verification of validity proofs in Bitcoin contracts.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdditionally, it might be possible to bridge BTC to foreign chains, build a prediction market, or emulate novel opcodes,\u201d said Linus.\n\nLinus said a limitation of the model is that it is limited to a two-party setting with a prover and a verifier and that a significant amount of off-chain computation and communication is needed to execute programs.\n\nLinus said the next \u201cmilestone\u201d is to fully implement the BitVM in addition to Tree++, a high-level programming language to write and debug Bitcoin contracts.\n\nBitVM is enabled by the Taproot soft fork, which took place in November 2021.\n\nLinus cited Ethereum research into optimistic rollups and a study on Merkle trees in contributing to the eight-page white paper.\n\nBitcoiners respond to BitVM\n\nProminent Bitcoiner Eric Wall posted on X (Twitter) that the concepts outlined in the BitVM white paper \u201ccheck out\u201d and that he is \u201ccautiously excited\u201d to see what real-world experiments stem from it.\n\nBitcoin analyst Dylan LeClair is also impressed with BitVM\u2019s white paper. But Adam Back, a Bitcoin Core contributor, suggested that people shouldn\u2019t get too excited about the development just yet.\n\nfor people getting (over) excited, this is cool but effectively a generalization of a two-party game - it says right in the abstract - so it's a bit like Greg Maxwell's 2016 ZKP contingent payments implemented example https://t.co/OeHRsbFjud \u2014 Adam Back (@adam3us) October 9, 2023\n\nRelated: BIP-300 biff: Debate reignites over years-old Bitcoin Drivechain proposal\n\nOne builder in the blockchain space, \u201cdotta,\u201d noted that there is already a proof-of-concept on GitHub.\n\nAnother X user, Sam Parker, attempted to resolve a common fear among Bitcoin (BTC) maximalists by explaining that BitVM won\u2019t force Bitcoin\u2019s to be \u201clocked\u201d into these contracts.\n\n\u201cFinally, this is opt-in. If you don\u2019t trust your coins being locked to some Turing complete contract (totally reasonable) then don\u2019t lock them to a Turing complete smart contract. One of [the] beauties of the UTXO system is security sandboxing.\u201d\n\nOthers, such as \u201cPsage,\u201d say BitVM adds to the list of things that will push Bitcoin\u2019s price forward in the next bull market.\n\nThe bullish stuff around #Bitcoin is snowballing, lots of them controversial, nevertheless a few off my finger tips:\n\n- BitVM\n\n- Ordinals\n\n- Multiple Pres Candidates talking about it\n\n- ETF\n\n- Halving\n\n- Privacy improvements\n\n- Exponential Hash Rate increase\n\n- Countries mining\n\n.... \u2014 psage (@perspiringsage) October 9, 2023\n\nCointelegraph contacted Linus for comment but did not receive an immediate response.\n\nMagazine: Wolf Of All Streets worries about a world where Bitcoin hits $1M: Hall of Flame"

        "content": "One altcoin project soared over a 24-hour period as a crypto whale accumulated a massive amount of its tokens, according to on-chain data.\n\nBlockchain tracking firm Lookonchain says that the native token of the automated market maker (AMM) Bancor Network (BNT) witnessed a big burst to the upside in a day as a single wallet acquired millions of BNT.\n\nThe firm says that the wallet is thought to belong to Upbit, a South Korean cryptocurrency exchange.\n\n\u201cThe price of BNT has increased nearly 40% today. A wallet suspected to be Upbit has accumulated 4.71 million BNT ($2.54 million, 3.3% of the total supply) in the past 11 hours, which seems to be related to the rise in BNT price.\u201d\n\nAccording to the firm\u2019s chart, BNT was trading for $0.399 before rallying to around $0.55. The altcoin peaked at around $0.625 yesterday prior to witnessing a sell-off event.\n\nAt time of writing, BNT is trading for $0.52, down over 17% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe firm also noticed that blockchain infrastructure provider Orbs (ORBS) rallied more than 40% in one day as crypto players sent the coin\u2019s trading volume soaring.\n\n\u201cThe price of ORBS surged by 43% today. 93.8% of the trading volume came from the Korean exchange Upbit, and 4.8% came from the Korean exchange Bithumb.\n\n(Investment firm) DWF Labs deposited 24 million ORBS ($792,000) into Bithumb after the price increase.\u201d\n\nThe firm\u2019s daily chart shows Orbs shooting up from $0.02297 to $0.033.\n\nOrbs has since retraced and is trading for $0.026 at time of writing, down nearly 9% in the past day.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The non-profit arm of the Ethereum Foundation sold some of its holdings.\n\nTraders opened more short positions moments after the sale.\n\nOn-chain data from Arkham Intelligence showed that the Ethereum [ETH] Foundation sold 1,700 ETH, and exchanged it for 2.7 USD Coin [USDC] on 9 October.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nAccording to the foundation\u2019s wallet 0x9eE457023bB3De16D51A003a247BaEaD7fce313, the sell-off took place on the Uniswap [UNI] exchange.\n\nHowever, the foundation did not abruptly sell the altcoins without a prior plan. According to Arkham, the non-profit organization sent the coins from its Gnosis Safe Proxy wallet five days ago.\n\nFew ETH left in the wallet\n\nCommonly used by Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), a Gnosis Safe is a smart contract multi-sig wallet running on Ethereum that requires a minimum number of people to approve a transaction.\n\nAfter the sale, Ethereum returned 494,000 USDC to the foundation\u2019s wallet before resending it to the Gnosis Safe. Also, the assets left on the Ethereum Foundation wallet include 240.67 ETH, 49,658 DAI, 10,125 ARB, and 7,096 USDC.\n\nHowever, a look at the foundation\u2019s X (formerly Twitter) page showed that it was unclear why the coins were sold.\n\nETH immediately felt the impact of the sale as the price dropped by 1.45 % within 2 hours that the action took place. As a result, the coin price fell below the $1,600 threshold, which it had held for a while. But how about traders?\n\nAccording to Coinglass, ETH\u2019s 4-hour Long/Short Ratio was 0.87. Typically, values over 1 of this indicator suggest more long positions than shorts. Conversely, a Long/Short Ratio of less than 1 means that there are more short positions than long.\n\nWatch out for more downside\n\nTherefore, ETH\u2019s aforementioned Long/Short Ratio means traders share the sentiment that the price may decrease further.\n\nHowever, the price of ETH may not go below $1,500 in the short term. This is because the Supply on Exchanges stayed put around the same point it has since last week.\n\nSupply on Exchanges is a measure of the number of coins sent into exchange wallets from external addresses. If the metric spikes, then it means there could be an impending selling pressure.\n\nTherefore, the flatlined status means there was enough strength from ETH to withstand the foundation\u2019s sale.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nMeanwhile, traders who opt to go long may need to watch out for the rising Open Interest on exchanges. As an indicator of market sentiment, the Open Interest on exchanges can tell when there is an increase in exchange activity.\n\nHowever, the increase in this metric could be connected to spot or derivatives trading. While it may be uncertain which actions are being taken on these platforms, it is also necessary to be wary of opening long positions."

Source: Finbold\n\nAll things considered, Saylor\u2019s Bitcoin bet might yet pay off, and massively.

        "content": "A new report finds Ethereum liquid staking providers are exposed to illicit funds at a very low level.\n\n'The dark number is probably significantly higher,' Northstake head of compliance Sebastian Heine said.\n\nIllicit funds could raise concerns for institutional investors.\n\nDeFi protocols that pool users\u2019 Ether for staking are exposed to funds tied to money laundering, scams, sanctioned addresses and malicious actors, according to a new report by digital asset infrastructure provider Northstake shared with DL News.\n\nWhile the proportion of dirty to clean funds is small, it may still present challenges for institutional investors bound by stringent regulations.\n\nThe report looked at three of the top Ether liquid staking protocols and found each had been exposed to funds tied directly to illicit activities, as well as those connected to high-risk crypto exchanges and gambling sites that don\u2019t require users to pass know-your-customer checks.\n\nDark number\n\nSebastian Heine, Northstake\u2019s chief of risk and compliance, said they are likely underestimating exposure.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\n\u201cThe dark number is probably significantly higher,\u201d Heine told DL News, referring to the actual amount of illicit or otherwise questionable crypto found in the staking protocols Northstake analysed.\n\n\u201cEven though we have good tracking tools on blockchain, it still needs human effort, time, and expertise to identify these addresses and clusters which are related to sanctioned transactions,\u201d he said.\n\nNorthstake found that total illicit and high-risk exposure was small \u2014 between 0.46% and 1.56% across the three protocols the report examined. Still, according to Northstake, this creates a serious dilemma for regulated entities looking to dip their toes in liquid staking protocols.\n\nThe report doesn\u2019t identify the liquid staking protocols it analysed. Lido and Rocket Pool, the two largest liquid staking protocols, did not immediately return DL News\u2019 requests for comment.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u2018Regulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain.\u2019 \u2014 James Butterfill, CoinShares\n\n\u201cThe level of exposure raises concerns and questions about acceptable thresholds for exposure to illicit funds, which an institutional investor is either willing to accept or legally allowed to carry,\u201d the report said.\n\nLiquid staking protocols remove complexity in Ether staking and increase market efficiency. They stake depositors\u2019 Ether for them and give out placeholder tokens, called liquid staking tokens, in return. They are also sometimes called liquid staking derivatives, though some note that the term \u201cderivatives\u201d comes with regulatory baggage.\n\nStaking rewards\n\nThese liquid staking tokens automatically accrue Ether staking rewards while also letting holders use them elsewhere, like as collateral for taking out DeFi loans.\n\nThis year, the Ether liquid staking market has exploded. In January, Lido, the largest Ether liquid staking provider, held $5.8 billion in deposits. Over the course of the year, that figure increased to $14.5 billion \u2014 a 150% gain.\n\nInvestor deposits in liquid staking derivatives protocols\n\n\u2018A matrix of issues to grapple with\u2019\n\nThere\u2019s a lot institutional stakers must consider, according to James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares.\n\n\u201cRegulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain, whether this is through the use of liquid staking, validators or crypto staking ETPs,\u201d Butterfill said.\n\n\u201cRegulated institutions will bring rigorous due diligence to this analysis, helped by blockchain analytics, in an effort to select the platforms which present the lowest risk to them.\u201d\n\nBut Northstake\u2019s figures also have to be put in perspective. \u201cIf a rule is applied that an investor cannot invest if there are some rogue actors, then it may well exclude many investment asset classes,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to estimates from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, between 2% and 5% of global GDP is laundered every year. That equates to between $800 billion to $2 trillion a year.\n\nMeanwhile, only $16 billion worth of crypto is locked in liquid staking protocols, according to DefiLlama data.\n\n\u201cIf we assume the worst case that 1.5% is criminal behaviour, this equates to between 0.012% and 0.031% of global money laundering,\u201d Butterfill told DL News. \u201cThis is remarkably low relative to other currencies, given that at one point according to SOCA [the UK\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency], that 90% of all 500 Euro notes sold in the UK were in the hands of organised crime.\u201d\n\nChallenge for institutional investors\n\nIn traditional finance, it can be hard to ascertain one\u2019s actual exposure to illicit or questionable funds. Crypto is different, according to Northstake CEO Jesper Johansen.\n\n\u201cWe can actually document this on-chain,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of blockchain, the transparency. So the question is actually turned on its head: Would you, as an institutional investor, be willing to accept a half a percent documented exposure to sanctioned funds when making your investment? And I think the answer comes out at zero \u2014 as in, \u2018no, I would not accept that.\u2019 \"\n\nEther liquid staking protocols usually do not require users to pass any form of know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks \u2014 DeFi is largely permissionless after all.\n\nWhile institutional investors may remain hesitant due to the counterparty risk involved with using liquid staking protocols, they are popular with retail investors, who aren\u2019t affected by potential exposure to illicit funds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s purely from the institutional investor point of view that we see this issue,\u201d Johansen said, \u201cbecause they have a fiduciary obligation to their investors to record any exposure that they have in their investments to the relevant competent authorities.\u201d\n\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

        "title": "This Study Shows that Ethereum is becoming Centralized! Here's Why... - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News",
        "content": "Recent upgrades to Ethereum, specifically the Merge and Shanghai, have reportedly led to an increased centralization of the network. This rise in centralization is primarily attributed to the surge in ether (ETH) staking, which, while beneficial in some ways, has its drawbacks.\n\nIs Staking GOOD?\n\nStaking, especially in Ethereum, has grown in popularity. However, this has inadvertently caused the overall yield from staking to decrease. For instance, where staking yield once stood at a robust 7.3%, post the Shanghai upgrade, it has diminished to around 5.5%.\n\nMoreover, the allure of decentralized staking platforms had gained traction in the crypto community as they were viewed as preferable to their centralized counterparts. These decentralized platforms have been making efforts to increase their node operators. This strategy aims to ensure that no single operator controls a disproportionate amount of staked ether, addressing some centralization concerns.\n\nThe Risks of Centralization\n\nIt\u2019s essential to understand that any form of centralization, regardless of the entity or protocol, introduces potential risks. If too few liquidity providers or node operators control the majority of the network, it can lead to vulnerabilities. Such concentration could result in a single failure point, or in a worst-case scenario, create opportunities for malicious attacks. There\u2019s also the fear that these dominating entities might prioritize their interests over the community\u2019s welfare.\n\nRehypothecation: A Rising Concern\n\nAnother pressing concern is rehypothecation. This involves liquidity tokens being used simultaneously as collateral across multiple decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. DeFi encompasses a range of financial activities executed on a blockchain, such as trading and lending. The problem with rehypothecation is that it could trigger a series of liquidations if the staked asset suddenly drops in value or faces security breaches.\n\nStaking Yield\u2019s Diminished Appeal\n\nWith traditional financial assets witnessing increasing yields, Ethereum\u2019s declining staking yield makes it less attractive. The drop from 7.3% to 5.5% post the upgrades underscores this shift.\n\n\u2014> BUY CRYPTOS WITH BITPANDA <\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nEthereum BSC announces the beginning of its presale, a significant milestone on its journey to becoming a prominent cryptocurrency project.\n\nAfter weeks of eager anticipation and discussions among investors about the project\u2019s potential, the presale is now open for participation on the official website.\n\nIn a short time since the presale launch, Ethereum BSC has already secured over $31,000 in funding, reflecting the crypto community\u2019s high level of interest and confidence.\n\nThis presale marks an essential step in Ethereum BSC\u2019s broader fundraising strategy, aiming to raise approximately $2.1 million to support the platform\u2019s growth and development.\n\nEthereum BSC Initiates Its Presale Phase Amidst High Investor Enthusiasm\n\nEthereum BSC, a new cryptocurrency project aimed at providing opportunities for those who may have missed out on Ethereum\u2019s initial offerings, has officially announced the commencement of its $ETHBSC token presale, offering an attractive presale price of just $0.035 per token, a similar cost last seen in Ethereum\u2019s early days of 2014.\n\nThe presale is already in progress and will conclude upon reaching its fundraising goal of approximately $2.1 million, intended to fuel the platform\u2019s expansion and development.\n\nNotably, this presale has garnered significant attention from investors, amplified by recent discussions within niche channels regarding the project\u2019s potential, including the unique features of this BEP-20 token \u2013 Ethereum BSC.\n\nWhat truly sets Ethereum BSC apart is its robust staking mechanism, differentiating itself from energy-intensive traditional mining methods. Ethereum BSC employs a stake-to-earn model, allowing token holders to stake their ETHBSC holdings and, in return, earn rewards over time. This innovative and environmentally conscious approach aligns with the evolving digital currency landscape.\n\nWith a capped total supply of 120 million tokens, Ethereum BSC ensures scarcity, enhancing the potential for value appreciation. Each token carries significant weight, and as demand surges, the opportunity for price appreciation grows.\n\nThis announcement marks an optimistic beginning for Ethereum BSC, inviting novice and experienced investors to participate and contribute to the project\u2019s thriving journey.\n\n$ETHBSC\u2019s Hassle-Free Process to Buy the Token\n\nIf you\u2019re eager to get your hands on ETHBSC tokens, whether you\u2019re a novice or an experienced investor, you can choose one of these three methods to buy ETHBSC:\n\nPaying with BNB (Binance Coin)\n\nThe swiftest way to obtain ETHBSC tokens is through BNB. So, ensure you hold some BNB in your MetaMask or Trust Wallet in order to buy ETHBSC. The process involves a simple token swap. Also, remember to reserve a small amount of BNB in your wallet to cover the minimal gas fee.\n\nPaying with ETH (Ethereum)\n\nAlternatively, you can purchase ETHBSC tokens using ETH on the Ethereum chain. Connect your wallet to the Ethereum network to facilitate the payment. Make sure you have sufficient ETH in your wallet to cover the gas fee, as the claiming process occurs on the BNB Smart Chain.\n\nUsing USDT (Tether)\n\nFor added convenience, you can buy ETHBSC tokens using USDT, either on the Ethereum or BSC chains. Connect your wallet to the respective chain and choose USDT as your payment option. It\u2019s important to have ETH or BNB readily available to cover the associated gas fee.\n\nAbout Ethereum BSC\n\nEthereum BSC serves as a bridge between Ethereum and the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), offering a green BEP-20 version of Ethereum. It encapsulates the spirit of Ethereum\u2019s early stages, providing users with a distinctive staking mechanism.\n\nBy staking $ETHBSC tokens, rewards can be periodically earned using the BSC\u2019s efficient and environmentally friendly infrastructure.\n\nTheir goal with Ethereum BSC is to create an opportunity for individuals who may have missed Ethereum\u2019s initial offerings or find Ethereum mining too complex.\n\nAccess to the world of cryptocurrencies is democratized through a presale for $ETHBSC tokens and a simplified \u201cmining\u201d process introduced via staking.\n\nRegarding their launch plans, the project\u2019s team intends to roll out Ethereum BSC on a decentralized exchange within a few weeks after the presale begins. The exact timing of this launch will depend on how swiftly the presale concludes.\n\nStay Tuned\n\nIf you want to learn more about Ethereum BSC, its evolution, presale status, and various updates about the project, you can follow its activity on the official Ethereum BSC website, as well as on platforms such as Telegram and Twitter."

        "title": "The Latest Comparison Between Ethereum and Solana - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "Solana was or is still known as an Ethereum killer. But how realistic is this? There are strong believers in Solana that think it will get up to the same levels as Ethereum.\n\nHowever, many others don\u2019t. Where is the truth? So, it\u2019s time to look a bit deeper into this Solana vs Ethereum saga. Let\u2019s compare some platforms on market cap and TVL.\n\nThe Ecosystems\n\nSo, first things first, we\u2019re looking at the bigger picture. In other words, we compare their respective ecosystems.\n\nWill Solana ever reach Ethereum's current levels? Some people believe in that, while others don't. In this thread, I'll be featuring interesting projects on Solana, comparing them with Ethereum in terms of Mcap and TVL. In the end, I'll be sharing some personal thoughts! \ud83e\uddf5\ud83e\udee1 pic.twitter.com/C5jsmqIplW \u2014 DefiFerr (@dontbuytops) October 3, 2023\n\nWe include their respective market cap, TVL, and number of daily active addresses:\n\nEthereum:\n\nIts TVL is 20,206 billion.\n\nMarketcap = 202,74 billion.\n\nDaily Active Addresses = 315k.\n\nSolana:\n\nTVL = 333,7M. (64x from Ethereum)\n\nMarketcap = 9,57B. (~21x from Ethereum)\n\nDaily Active Addresses = 241k. (~1,3x from Ethereum)\n\nIt should come as no surprise that Ethereum has a clear lead here. Ethereum ranks as #1 of all chains. In contrast to Solana, that comes in at a respectable 9th spot. The picture below shows the current TVL for both chains.\n\nSource: Artemis\n\nDEXes\n\nFor DEXes, we look at the most popular ones. On Ethereum, that is Uniswap. On Solana, we look at the two current top-performing DEXes, Orca and Raydium. Here are the TVL and market cap of these dApps at the time of writing this article:\n\nEthereum (Uniswap (Uniswap $UNI ): TVL = 3.071 billion. Marketcap = 3.132 billion. Solana (Raydium $RAY): TVL = 30.53 million. Marketcap = 38.57 million. Solana (Orca (Orca $ORCA ): TVL = 44.62 million. Marketcap = 19.38 million.\n\n\n\nEthereum will have the upper hand in all comparisons we make. Both Solana DEXes don\u2019t come anywhere near the Ethereum TVL or market cap. I will comment on all the data at a later stage. The picture below shows the TVL for Uniswap between December 2022 and October 9th, 2023.\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nLending Protocols\n\nWith lending protocols, we do the same. We look at the biggest lending protocol on Ethereum, which is Aave. On Solana, the two top lending platforms are Solend and MarginFi.\n\nEthereum (Aave (Aave $AAVE TVL = 4,72 billion. Marketcap = 935.51 million.\n\n\n\nSolana (Solend $SLND) TVL = 50 million. Marketcap = 43.89 million.\n\n\n\nSolana ($MarginFi) TVL = 22.64 million. No token yet.\n\n\n\nOnce again, we see that both the Solana TVLs and market caps don\u2019t come close to Ethereum. The picture below shows Aave on DeFiLlama.\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nDerivatives\n\nFor derivatives, we add an extra metric, the derivative volume. For Ethereum, we look at dYdX. However, their move to the Cosmos Hub is imminent. On Solana, we look at Drift. They\u2019re the top platforms on their respective chains.\n\nEthereum ($DYDX):\n\nTVL = 343.66 million\n\nMonthly Derivatives Volume (September) = 858.43 million\n\nMarketcap = 348.33 million\n\nSolana (Drift)\n\nTVL = 18.59 million\n\nMonthly Derivatives Volume (September) = 8.97 million\n\nNo token yet.\n\nDrift drifts quite a long way from dYdX. Below you can see the DeFiLlama chart for dYdX.\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nLiquid Staking\n\nLiquid staking platforms take the current top positions for TVL. On Ethereum, Lido is miles away from its nearest competitor. On Solana, Marinate Finance is the undisputed leader, followed by Jito. However, Lido is on Jito\u2019s heals here.\n\nEthereum (Lido $LDO)\n\nTVL = 14.116 billion\n\nMarketcap = 1.361 billion\n\nSolana (Marinade Finance $MNDE)\n\nTVL = 124.94 million.\n\nMarketcap = 8.42 million.\n\nSolana (Jito)\n\nTVL = 54.99 million.\n\nNo token yet\n\nJito is seeing some great monthly changes on TVL. Well over 80%. But, as already pointed out, Lido is closing in on Jito. However, the picture below shows the Marinade Finance TVL chart on DeFiLlama.\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nMemecoins\n\nMemecoins are not our favorite coins at Altcoin Buzz. However, recently, they have been making waves. So, let\u2019s take a look at some memecoins and their market cap on both chains.\n\nEthereum ($PEPE)\n\nMarketcap = 279.5 million.\n\nSolana ($BONK)\n\nMarketcap = 8.258 million.\n\nSolana ($GUAC)\n\nMarketcap = 1.86 million.\n\nOnce more, it\u2019s Ethereum that is miles ahead of the Solana tokens.\n\nYield Aggregator\n\nFor yield aggregators, we look at Yearn on Ethereum. On Solana, we eye Hawksight and Meteroa.\n\nEthereum (Yearn Finance $YFI)\n\nTVL = 316.61 million.\n\nMarketcap = 173.25 million.\n\nSolana (Hawksight $HAWK)\n\nTVL = 2.03 million.\n\nMarketcap = 0.04 million.\n\nSolana (Meteroa)\n\nTVL = 9.37 million.\n\nNo token yet.\n\nThere are no surprises here, Hawksight and Meteroa have, once more, nothing on Yearn. The picture below shows the Yearn TVL on DeFiLlama.\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nConclusion\n\nIt should come as no surprise that Ethereum is ahead in all metrics we looked at. However, Ethereum has a clear first-mover advantage. So, this pays out in its history and the general adaption that the chain has. On the other hand, Solana has some great features that Ethereum still lacks. For instance, scalability, and fast and cheap transactions. However, Solana is a younger chain and is still building.\n\nCatching up on Ethereum is a big task. But in crypto, you never know how things can turn around.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information discussed by Altcoin Buzz is not financial advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Foundation Falls Victim to MEV Bot Attack - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain network, suffered a substantial setback through a sandwich attack, losing over $9K.\n\nThis data underscores an increasing problem of sandwich attacks in the crypto sphere, with over $1.3 million lost through such schemes in the past 30 days on the Ethereum chain.\n\nThe Sandwich Attack\n\nAccording to Eigenphi\u2019s data, on Oct. 9, the Ethereum network experienced a significant sandwich attack by the MEV bot (0x00\u20266B40), resulting in a profit of approximately $4,060 after factoring in costs.\n\nMEV bots are well-known for extracting miner-extractable value in blockchain transactions.\n\nVarious blockchain analysts, including EigenPhi, promptly identified this recent incident. Network data reveals that this sudden attack followed an Ethereum foundation attempt to sell 1.7K Ethereum tokens through Uniswap V3. The foundation aimed to exchange these tokens for 2.738 million USDC via Uniswap.\n\nData charts illustrate a series of transactions involving multiple tokens such as WETH, USDC, ETH, aUSDC, aWETH, and variable WETH, enabling the attacker to ultimately secure profits. The MEV bot generated approximately 5.616 ETH in revenue during these transactions, accumulating 3.111 ETH after deducting costs after the incident.\n\nAt the time of the attack, Ethereum was trading in the $1,600-$1,618 range. This implies that the MEV bot obtained revenue of approximately $9,101, with actual profits amounting to $4,060. Consequently, the attack resulted in a $9,101 loss for the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nDespite this significant setback, the foundation\u2019s address retains substantial assets, including 240.68 ETH, 3.238 million USDC, 49,700 DAI, and 10,000 ARB, totaling $3.687 million.\n\nThe Sandwich Problem in Blockchain\n\nA closer examination of Eigenphi\u2019s analysis suggests that there has been significant activity from sandwich attackers recently. Within 24 hours prior to the reports, 85 sandwich attackers managed to generate profits totaling $22.9K.\n\nOver the past seven days, approximately 20.4K victims have been reported, with 123 attackers accumulating profits of $239.4K. In the last 30 days alone, attackers have profited a minimum of $1.38 million through sandwich attacks.\n\nAlthough the Ethereum chain remains the primary target, BSC chains closely follow suit, with attackers earning $497.4K in the past 30 days.\n\nThese recent incidents serve as a clear reminder of the significant risks associated with the blockchain ecosystem, which can impact anyone."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency industry and community are abuzz with the latest Bitcoin update: BitVM. This computing paradigm, designed to express Turing-complete Bitcoin contracts, has the potential to revolutionize the Bitcoin network. What is even more intriguing is that this does not require any changes to the network's consensus rules. Instead of executing computations on Bitcoin, they are merely verified, drawing parallels with optimistic rollups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis mechanism allows any computable function to be verified on Bitcoin, paving the way for smart contracts on the Bitcoin network. But what does this mean for Ethereum and Cardano, two giants in the smart contract space?\n\nSource: BitVM Whitepaper\n\nEthereum, once the undisputed leader in the DeFi and NFT sectors, has been experiencing a downturn. The once-thriving DeFi and NFT landscapes have lost their sheen, with users becoming wary due to recurring scams and a perceived lack of innovation since the 2021 bull run. Cardano, on the other hand, has been positioning itself as a more efficient and scalable alternative to Ethereum, but it too faces challenges in gaining widespread adoption.\n\nWith Bitcoin's BitVM, the game could change dramatically. The ability to perform complex off-chain computation without leaving any trace on the chain, unless there is a dispute, is a game-changer. It offers a level of privacy and efficiency that could make Bitcoin a formidable competitor in the smart contract arena.\n\nIf Bitcoin can successfully implement and popularize this feature, it could potentially draw developers and users away from Ethereum and Cardano. The trust and security associated with Bitcoin, combined with the new capabilities of BitVM, could make it an attractive platform for developers looking to build decentralized applications.\n\nMoreover, the fact that Bitcoin is Turing-complete, allowing it to verify the execution of any program, further solidifies its position. While the current model is limited to a two-party setting, future generalizations could expand its capabilities."

        "content": "Bitcoin inscriptions, a new way to store data on the Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) blockchain, have surpassed 35 million since their inception in January.\n\nOrdinals are digital artifacts that can be inscribed onto Bitcoin using the Ordinals protocol.\n\nThey can be anything from text files, images, and audio to videos, and can be used to store a wide variety of data on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nAccording to a report by Galaxy Digital, text files represent the vast majority of Bitcoin inscriptions, accounting for approximately 95% of all inscriptions.\n\nAlso Read: People Are Going To Start Cashing Out Bitcoin \u2014 Here's Why\n\nImage-based inscriptions account for approximately 3.5% of all inscriptions, with the remaining 1.5% consisting of other types of digital artifacts.\n\nOrdinals Activity Since March: In the first 200 days since the first inscription on Bitcoin, a total of 1.14 million image-based inscriptions have been created.\n\nThis surpasses the number of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) minted on other blockchains, such as Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), Solana (CRYPTO: SOL), and Polygon (CRYPTO: MATIC), since the debut of NFTs on these respective networks.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Bitcoin's minting activity throughout the first 200 days is still much lower than the total minting activity for NFTs on other blockchains, illustrating how Ordinals still have a long way to go in terms of adoption relative to the broader NFT ecosystem.\n\nOrdinals Trading Volume: Despite the unfavorable market conditions for NFTs in 2023, Ordinals accomplished meaningful growth.\n\nBitcoin has accumulated the third-highest NFT trading volume by the network at $596.4 million.\n\nEven when excluding BRC-20s, which represent ~30% of all Ordinals volume ($187.5 million), Bitcoin remains the third most popular chain for digital collectible activity after Ethereum and Solana.\n\nOrdinals Marketplaces: The most dominant marketplaces by volume for Ordinals are now Magic Eden, Unisat, and OKX at 28%, 28%, and 38% respectively.\n\nImplications for the Future of Bitcoin: The growing popularity of Bitcoin inscriptions is a significant development for the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nIt suggests that Bitcoin is being used for more than just a store of value and a medium of exchange. It is also being used to store and share data, which could lead to new and innovative use cases for Bitcoin in the future.\n\nFor example, Bitcoin inscriptions could be used to create a decentralized social media platform or a decentralized storage platform. They could also be used to create new forms of digital art and collectibles.\n\nRead Next: Bitcoin To $20K, Ethereum To $1K?

        "content": "After a sharp downturn on Monday, Ethereum (ETH) briefly stabilized on Tuesday, only to face another threat. This turbulence resulted from a wallet seemingly linked to the Ethereum Foundation choosing to sell a portion of its allocated tokens, causing widespread panic.\n\nConsequently, Ethereum price slipped by approximately just over 2% within a few hours. This sudden decline came as a surprise to many, leaving traders scrambling to react. Monday was a particularly brutal day for cryptocurrency traders, as the market witnessed a dramatic sell-off. As a result, over $100 million worth of liquidations occurred, primarily affecting long positions\u2014those who had bet on price increases.\n\nadvertisement\n\nNotably, the chaos also unfolded against the backdrop of escalating tensions in the Middle East, where Israel\u2019s conflict with Hamas and increasing regional turmoil rattled investors, impacting risk assets across the board.\n\nEther\u2019s Imminent Danger\n\nHowever, even as Ethereum seemingly stabilized on Tuesday, concerns continued to loom. Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez issued a warning via Twitter, cautioning that Ethereum was precariously perched above a critical demand zone.\n\nHe emphasized the importance of monitoring the situation closely, highlighting that 1.59 million address bought $1.92 million ETH worth $2.9 billion along this area in the past.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Martinez pointed out that since February 2023, Ethereum whales had been capitalizing on surging prices, offloading or redistributing over 5 million ETH, which translates to approximately $8.5 billion. According to the pundit, what is particularly striking is that this trend of selling has persisted, with no current indications of a shift towards Ethereum accumulation.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s important to note that Ethereum has found itself under a shadow of negativity in recent times. From Vitalik Buterin\u2019s sale of his coins to the growing concerns within the cryptocurrency community regarding Ethereum\u2019s apparent centralization within its staking pools, these factors that have been exerting significant downward pressure on its price.\n\nAt press time, Ether was trading at $1,585 after a 0.45% drop over the past 24 hours."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA seven-figure sale of a CrypToadz NFT on Ethereum wasn\u2019t all that surprising during the market mayhem of late 2021. But such a sale today, amid significantly weakened demand for NFT assets, is sure to stand out. And today\u2019s $1.6 million purchase of a CrypToadz NFT is raising some red flags, too, thanks to a connection to Tornado Cash.\n\nCrypToadz #4030 was purchased today on the OpenSea marketplace for 1,055 Wrapped Ethereum (WETH), or more than $1.6 million worth. The buyer also paid OpenSea a fee of almost $42,000 worth of ETH on top of the base price.\n\nThe amount paid is dramatically more than the typical going rate for a CrypToadz NFT. Currently, they start at 0.53 ETH (about $835) on OpenSea, with the best listed offer on that particular NFT coming in a little higher at just below 0.6 ETH ($940). In other words, the buyer paid well above the market rate for this profile picture (PFP) project.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe purchasing wallet was funded by a wallet that has been pulling money out of Tornado Cashhttps://t.co/nNhKvSVhoz pic.twitter.com/aInHO8vNyG \u2014 TexasHedge (@0xTexasHedge) October 9, 2023\n\nInitially, Crypto Twitter commenters pointed to a \u201cfat finger\u201d mistake\u2014that the buyer may have zipped too quickly through the process and accidentally paid far more than intended. We\u2019ve seen apparent examples of this on the other side, too, where sellers have accepted bids that were well below the market price for a particular collection.\n\nHowever, a bit more digging reveals another potential answer: wash trading.\n\nSee, the wallet that purchased the CrypToadz NFT today was recently funded with about 1,116 ETH (about $1.76 million) from another wallet\u2014and that wallet received about 1,200 ETH (almost $1.9 million) from Ethereum coin mixing service Tornado Cash in September.\n\nTornado Cash is an automated service that lets users obscure the flow of cryptocurrency to and from wallets by mixing funds from various users into a pool. That breaks the public, on-chain flow of cryptocurrency between wallets, making it more difficult to trace how ETH is being sent around.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPrivacy advocates say that Tornado Cash lets them transact cryptocurrency with less fear of surveillance, but authorities have called it and similar tools a way to launder money. The service was banned in the United States following Treasury Department sanctions in 2022.\n\nGiven the use of Tornado Cash to funnel substantial amounts of ETH into the funding wallet, this may indeed be an attempt at wash trading or money laundering by the buyer, using an NFT purchase to further complicate the flow of funds between crypto wallets and assets. On the other hand, use of Tornado Cash does not necessarily imply illegal actions or intent.\n\nOpenSea did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

Readers should do their own research before taking any actions related to the company. U.Today is not responsible, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any content, goods or services mentioned in the article.\n\nAs technology advances and develops, the cryptocurrency ecosystem is seeing a remarkable shift from old-generation platforms to modernized blockchain networks with improved technology and adaptive consensus mechanisms. Bitcoin Spark is initiating a new beginning that solves the weaknesses and limitations found on the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks. The solutions provide a massive utility that has attracted whales and institutions to its ongoing ICO event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLimitations of Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are considered generation blockchains since their respective networks feature older technology that contains glitches and expensive limitations hindering the growth of developers. For instance, Bitcoin's network is highly outdated, and the transaction speeds on the network could be better. The platform also experiences limited scalability due to a lack of smart contracts. The network also charges high transaction costs that sometimes exceed the transacted amount.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum luckily underwent a major hard fork upgrade that converted it from a proof of work network to a proof of stake. However, the network still charges high transaction costs and the network's growth. Ethereum's smart contracts are also characterized by loopholes that have led to the vulnerability of decentralized applications to malicious hackers.\n\nBitcoin Spark Overcomes Bitcoin and Ethereum Shortcomings\n\nAlthough Bitcoin Spark is a Bitcoin hard fork, some applications provide alternative solutions to Ethereum's limitations. Bitcoin and Ethereum charge high transaction costs, keeping away participants.\n\nBitcoin Spark will be a gas network, but the transaction costs will be lower than those experienced on the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks. The gas token of the Bitcoin Spark network will be BTCS tokens. All transaction charges will be sent to the mining pools and distributed to miners by the Bitcoin Spark smart contract layer.\n\nBitcoin Spark's mainnet will launch soon, introducing a unique smart contract layer that will diversify the development of the network. The platform's smart contracts will deploy decentralized applications in EVM-compatible languages like Vyper or Solidity.\n\nThe Contract Wolf audited Bitcoin Spark smart contract will have four independent but interjecting layers programmable in low- and high-level languages. The smart contract will also have an underlying parallel layer to deploy contracts in Rust alongside a special feature that settles transactions on the Spark mainnet.\n\nThe four layers include the rewards layer, the mining layer, the consensus layer, and the execution layer. Mining BTCS tokens will take place in the mining layer of the network and allow network participants to donate idle processing power to the platform. Although serving different purposes, the layers will reach a common network finality to power a growing ecosystem supporting numerous utilities.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, Bitcoin Spark encourages network validators to join the ecosystem. Instead of wasting energy like in proof-of-work blockchains, Bitcoin Spark will trap idle energy during mining due to the network's lightweight nature.\n\nThe lightweight component of the mining process allows the mining activity to take place on devices that run on low power, like Laptops, PCs, mobile phones, and tablets. This also opens up BTCS mining to the general public. To get started, users need an updated smart device that can install the Bitcoin Spark mining application and connect the device to a stable internet connection.\n\nLearn more about Bitcoin Spark on:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/"

        "title": "Not Ethereum, But Bitcoin Minetrix Is The Hottest New Coin In Crypto \u2013 Here\u2019s Why - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The crypto market has entered a period of uncertainty in recent weeks, with majors like Ethereum struggling to maintain upward momentum.\n\nHowever, while legacy cryptocurrencies battle bearish sentiment, new disruptive projects are emerging to capture investor attention.\n\nOne such rising star is Bitcoin Minetrix, whose innovative cloud mining solution and wildly successful presale have propelled it into the spotlight. As Ethereum wavers below key support levels, all eyes are on whether Bitcoin Minetrix can sustain its epic start and become the next big thing in crypto.\n\nEthereum Price Struggles to Maintain Momentum\n\nEthereum has been facing some struggles this week. The price of ETH is now trading below the crucial and psychological $1600 level amid a broader crypto market downturn.\n\nAccording to top analyst Ali on Twitter, Ethereum whales have been capitalizing on surging prices since February 2023, offloading or redistributing over 5 million ETH \u2013 equivalent to roughly $8.5 billion. This selling trend is apparently continuing, with no indication yet of a shift towards ETH accumulation.\n\nAli notes that Ethereum is hovering above a critical demand zone, advising traders to keep a close watch. A daily close below $1530 could signal a steep correction ahead for ETH.\n\nFrom altFINS\u2019 technical analysis perspective, Ethereum recently saw a bullish breakout from the Falling Wedge pattern. This could suggest buyers have absorbed all the supply from sellers, and the price is ready to resume an uptrend.\n\nEthereum is currently retesting that breakout level around $1600. The upside potential is the $1800 horizontal resistance zone if bulls can maintain control. This area also coincides with the 200-day moving average, making it a stiff resistance point.\n\nThe Falling Wedge pattern usually results in a bullish breakout. When the price breaks above the upper trendline, it often continues trending higher. Traders can play the emerging pattern between the convergence lines before the breakout. However, most traders wait for a complete pattern and confirmed breakout before going long.\n\nThe momentum indicators are currently bearish for Ethereum. The MACD line is below the signal line, and the RSI is below 45. This reflects the recent downturn and loss of upside momentum.\n\nThe nearest significant support zone for Ethereum is $1600, which has already been broken on Monday. Below that lies $1500, which could see buyers emerge to defend this area. On the upside, resistance is seen at $1800 (previous support turned resistance), followed by the psychological $2000 level.\n\nHottest New Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Minetrix Raises Close To $1 Million\n\nWhile Ethereum faces some uncertainty in the short-term, an interesting new project called Bitcoin Minetrix has been gaining substantial momentum.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s presale recently hit a major milestone, raising $925,000 within the first few weeks. Hitting $1,000,000 is only a matter of time at this pace.\n\nWith its innovative approach to cloud mining and current low entry point, could Bitcoin Minetrix become the next explosive crypto success story that creates tremendous wealth?\n\n#BitcoinMinetrix has once more crossed a crucial milestone! \ud83d\ude80 We have raised over $900,000. pic.twitter.com/zWvJsUwiBb \u2014 Bitcoinminetrix (@bitcoinminetrix) October 10, 2023\n\nThe possibilities are certainly there for major upside. Bitcoin Minetrix aligns perfectly with the opportunity to enhance the user experience for Bitcoin mining. Its presale also offers investors a chance to buy in at a very low starting price.\n\nThe presale consists of ten rounds, with each round seeing a 10% token price increase. However, those purchasing now at $0.011 per token will be pleased to know this is the base price. It won\u2019t get any cheaper than this stage one cost.\n\nThe main feature of Bitcoin Minetrix is its decentralized cloud mining solution. It tackles the common issues of excessive hardware costs and deceptive scams associated with Bitcoin mining. Users can buy and stake BTCMTX tokens to gain cloud mining credits, ensuring a more secure and transparent mining process.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s novel Stake-to-Mine concept throws open the doors of Bitcoin mining to all crypto enthusiasts. Users can now participate in this potentially lucrative activity without grappling with technical complexity or sinking money into prohibitive hardware costs. By leveraging this innovation, the project strives to make BTC mining genuinely accessible and democratic like never before.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n\nUsers need an Ethereum-compatible wallet like MetaMask to purchase and stake BTCMTX tokens. Staking the BTCMTX tokens earns users non-tradable ERC-20 token credits. These credits must be burned in exchange for actual Bitcoin cloud mining power. This innovative Stake-to-Mine concept makes bitcoin mining accessible for regular crypto investors.\n\nCloud mining provides several advantages, including easy entry, cost efficiency, and avoiding the physical annoyances of noise and space from mining rigs. It removes the need for technical skills, hardware setup, and maintenance, making it user-friendly even for beginners.\n\nMarketing Efforts\n\nThe project\u2019s high potential yields have already attracted the attention of major crypto influencers. YouTube analyst Jacob Bury predicts returns of 10x or greater once BTCMTX makes its market debut after the presale. Meanwhile, Zach Humphries and Michael Wrubel have also endorsed Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s novel cloud mining approach.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix is currently undertaking massive marketing efforts across the crypto space. It\u2019s being featured on all the top crypto media outlets, including CryptoPotato, CaptainAltcoin, NewsBTC, Cryptonewsz, and many more.\n\nWhile Ethereum is facing some temporary uncertainty, Bitcoin Minetrix is just getting started on what could become an explosive journey.\n\nIts innovative cloud mining solution, coupled with a low-cost presale entry point, makes Bitcoin Minetrix a very intriguing crypto investment opportunity worth watching closely in the weeks ahead.\n\nVisit Bitcoinminetrix.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "A wallet apparently belonging to the Ethereum Foundation sold off a portion of its allocated tokens on Monday. Following the incident, ether prices dropped by about 1.5% as traders seemed to react to the transaction.\n\nWhat is the Ethereum Foundation?\n\nThe Ethereum foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting Ethereum, developing applications and programs for the network. It is not an official entity or a centralized group that controls what happens on the chain. However, it remains very influential and can impact token prices or Ethereum\u2019s inherent outlook among investors or developers.\n\nAs of April 2022, it held almost $1.29 billion worth of ether (ETH), which accounted for more than 0.297% of the total ether supply at the time. Also, the foundation has about $300 million in investments outside the crypto space.\n\nAccording to data from the blockchain analyst platform Arkham, the specific wallet with the address \u201c0x9eE457023bB3De16D51A003a247BaEaD7fce313D\u201d swapped over 1,700 ETH for $2.7 million in USDC on Monday. The transaction took place on the decentralized exchange Uniswap at 16:18 UTC+8.\n\nThe wallet is labeled as a \u201cGrant Provider\u201d on blockchain tracker Etherscan and holds nearly $400,000 worth of tokens as of Monday morning.\n\nAs of the time of writing, the Ethereum Foundation has not released any official statement regarding its intention with the funds. The lack of clarity has prompted various speculation and reaction in the crypto community.\n\nSome analysts perceive the move as the network\u2019s attempt to lock in profits and diversify assets, especially as the cryptocurrency market has displayed high volatility in recent months. Also, with stablecoins like USDC gaining market traction, some argue that the recent transactions appear to solidify the narrative around its growing utilization of in the digital economy.\n\nNevertheless, traders have reacted by selling Ethereum (ETH), which led to a 1.8% drop in its price in the last 24 hours, leading to other significant tokens also seeing a slide in value.\n\nCurrently, investors and stakeholders are closely monitoring the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s moves for clues about the direction the ecosystem is heading.\n\nYour crypto deserves the best security.

        "content": "Circle stablecoin issuer has unveiled its latest initiative of minting USD Coin (USDC) directly on the Ethereum layer-2 scaling protocol, Polygon. This development simplifies the process for users and developers, eliminating the need to bridge the stablecoin from Ethereum to another blockchain.\n\nUSDC on Polygon Enables Instant Transactions\n\nWith this new offering, Circle\u2019s Mint and developer APIs now seamlessly support Polygon-based USDC. Consequently, businesses and developers can now craft decentralized applications using USDC on Polygon. Moreover, this integration promises near-instant transactions with minimal fees. Such capabilities are crucial for a range of applications, from payments and remittances to trading, borrowing, and lending.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBefore this announcement, users relied on bridged USDC (USDC.e) from the Ethereum blockchain. However, this token wasn\u2019t issued by Circle. In contrast, the newly introduced offering guarantees redemption at a 1:1 ratio with the United States dollar. Additionally, Circle had previously facilitated deposits and withdrawals for USDC.e on Polygon through Circle Mint and its APIs. However, Circle will end this service on Nov. 10. They caution users that sending USDC.e to Circle Mint accounts after this date might make their assets irretrievable.\n\nPolygon-based USDC Enables Ethereum Transfers\n\nCircle\u2019s integration with Polygon is poised to revolutionize the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. By providing native Polygon USDC, Circle is paving the way for affordable global payments and remittances. Additionally, it ensures easier access to prominent DeFi protocols like Aave, Compound, Curve, Uniswap, and QuickSwap.\n\nFurthermore, Circle has plans in the pipeline to introduce a cross-chain transfer protocol on Polygon. This will foster interoperability with other blockchain networks, significantly enabling Polygon-based USDC transfers to and from the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIn related news, Circle made headlines in September by announcing native stablecoin liquidity access on the NEAR protocol ecosystem. Circle Account and Circle APIs now offer USDC NEAR access, marking a significant step in expanding the stablecoin\u2019s usability and accessibility across various blockchain networks.\n\nRead Also: SBF Trial: Recap of First Week of Broken Trusts as SBF Loyalists Testify"

        "content": "As we stand on the cusp of a new year, the world of cryptocurrencies continues to evolve at a breakneck pace. With each passing day, new tokens emerge, promising innovations and potential wealth for investors. But amidst this vast sea of digital currencies, which ones truly hold the potential to redefine our financial future? In this comprehensive guide, we delve into the most promising cryptocurrencies by the end of 2023, shedding light on their unique value propositions, growth trajectories, and the underlying factors that could make them the stars of the crypto universe.\n\nBest Cryptocurrencies Which will make you rich in 2023\n\nDiving deep into the cryptocurrency realm of 2023, we spotlight the following standout contenders:\n\nEthereum (ETH) ScapesMania Ripple (XRP) Solana (SOL) Cardano (ADA) Litecoin (LTC)\n\nFrom the steadfast presence of Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) to the promising potential of ScapesMania and the robust platforms of Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), the crypto landscape is a dynamic playfield. Each coin displays something unique, but the buzz around the innovations of ScapesMania expected to grow by 410% upon listing is particularly hard to ignore. Litecoin (LTC), as one of the older cryptocurrencies, continues to hold its ground, showcasing its resilience and adaptability.\n\nSeeing the True Value of ScapesMania\n\nScapesMania has rapidly become a synonym for originality in the relatively new cryptocurrency market. ScapesMania stands out from the crowd of underrated altcoins and well-established crypto titans because of its innovative revenue streams and meteoric rise in its presale.\n\nBacked by an award-winning team, ScapesMania is all about safety, having successfully passed audits by top-tier security labs. With a presence on key exchanges on the horizon, ScapesMania is poised for visibility and liquidity, which are going to fuel its growth.\n\n>>> Find Out More on the Official Site <<<\n\nWhat is a Presale?\n\nThe purpose of a crypto presale is to provide interested parties a chance to learn about and perhaps buy a new coin before it is officially released and listed on online trading platforms. Plus, it\u2019s a great way to acquire tokens at a much lower price than they will be once the project goes live.\n\nThe current ScapesMania presale is gathering steam by the day, giving traders a small window of opportunity to leverage this token while it is still in its initial stages. Joining the presale enables you to save significantly as ScapesMania is expected to surge in value upon listing. Such offers don\u2019t last long \u2013 as the clock is ticking, the opportunity to acquire discounted ScapesMania tokens is slipping away.\n\nIs ScapesMania Going to Be the Hottest Altcoin of 2023 and Beyond?\n\n\n\nSeveral factors point to ScapesMania being the most promising new cryptocurrency of 2023:\n\nInnovative Mechanisms: ScapesMania allows crypto-savvy people to benefit from the multi-billion gaming industry;\n\nInstantaneous Token Access: ScapesMania distinguishes itself from the crowd by letting purchasers take instant possession of and use their tokens after payment.\n\nStraightforward Tokenomics: The project\u2019s tokenomics are cutting-edge and simple to understand since they avoid any ambiguity;\n\nRising Presale Numbers: ScapesMania\u2019s impressive presale statistics indicate that it is gaining significant traction in the crypto world.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Response to US Dollar Risks\n\n\n\nExperts warn of US dollar risks due to the Federal Reserve\u2019s inflationary actions. This could boost cryptocurrency values, especially Ethereum (ETH).\n\nThe Federal Reserve may take strong monetary steps due to a $33 trillion U.S. debt issue, possibly affecting the dollar. Such moves could enhance cryptocurrencies, likening them to assets like gold. Christopher Wood of Jefferies views Bitcoin and gold as inflation shields.\n\nEthereum (ETH) value ranges from $1570 to $1733, with resistance at $1795 and $1957. Support levels at $1469 and $1307 indicate bearish points. Institutions are showing increased interest in cryptocurrencies, notably Ethereum (ETH). BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink is positive on digital assets.\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum (ETH) may grow due to US dollar issues, but investors should stay alert.\n\nRipple (XRP) Automated Market Maker Proposal\n\n\n\nRipple (XRP) CTO, David Schwartz, has proposed adding an Automated Market Maker (AMM) feature to the Ripple (XRP) Ledger (XRPL). If the community agrees, this addition could significantly influence Ripple (XRP) price. With community approval, the XRPL could implement this feature in just two weeks, enhancing Ripple (XRP) market position.\n\nCurrently, Ripple (XRP) trading range is between $0.466 and $0.556. With the positive buzz around the AMM feature and the adaptability of XRPL, Ripple (XRP) might challenge resistance levels at $0.597 and possibly aim for $0.687. However, it\u2019s essential to watch the support levels at $0.417 and $0.327, as they are key to Ripple (XRP) price stability. The community\u2019s decision will be pivotal in determining Ripple (XRP) next major price movement.\n\nSolana (SOL) Resilience and Innovation\n\n\n\nSolana (SOL) has shown resilience and innovation despite challenges, influencing its future price. With a 100% uptime this year and a TVL of $30.95 million, it indicates a strong ecosystem. Solana (SOL) efficient NFT minting positions it well against rivals, attracting more users.\n\nThe market should monitor FTX/Alameda\u2019s large Solana (SOL) holdings, as changes could affect prices.\n\nTrading between $18.53 and $22.99, given Solana (SOL) advancements, the price might approach $24.63 or $29.09. Supports at $15.71 and $11.25 are key for bullish trends. Solana (SOL) price seems set for growth, but investors should remain cautious.\n\nCardano (ADA) Development Surge\n\nCardano (ADA) surpassed Polkadot and Kusama in development, as noted by Santiment, hinting at a potential price rise. This development surge often aligns with positive market sentiment.\n\nCurrently, Cardano (ADA) price ranges from $0.241 to $0.264. With its development momentum, it might challenge $0.273 and aim for $0.296. Support levels at $0.227 and $0.204 are crucial for stability.\n\nGiven these factors, Cardano (ADA) price seems set for growth. Investors should closely watch these indicators in the Cardano (ADA) market.\n\nLitecoin (LTC) Market Fluctuations and Potential\n\nLitecoin (LTC) has faced market fluctuations recently. It\u2019s struggling to maintain above the $66.40 mark against the US Dollar after a drop from near $68.40. Yet, its retest of the $63.00 support could fuel a rally.\n\nLitecoin (LTC) price ranges between $59.60 and $70.37. Given its adaptability and recent events, it might approach resistance at $74.78 and target $85.55. Support levels at $53.24 and $42.47 are crucial for its price direction.\n\nA noted contracting triangle with resistance near $65.50 hints at a breakout. If breached, it could lead to a significant rally towards the mentioned resistances.\n\nConsidering market trends and Litecoin (LTC) history, its price may rise. However, investors should remain cautious and informed.\n\nUnderstanding the Crypto Landscape of 2023:\n\nScapesMania has rapidly become a synonym for originality in the relatively new cryptocurrency market. Its innovative revenue streams and rapid ascent in its presale make it stand out. On the other hand, Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Litecoin (LTC) each have their own unique value propositions and growth potential. From Ethereum (ETH) positioning amidst potential US dollar challenges to Ripple (XRP) potential integration of the AMM feature, and from Solana (SOL) resilience and innovation to Cardano (ADA) proactive approach in development, each coin offers something different to the market. Litecoin (LTC), being one of the pioneers, showcases its adaptability and potential for a rally.\n\nProceed with Caution:\n\nWhile the crypto world offers numerous opportunities, it\u2019s essential to remember the inherent risks. This article aims to provide insights and not financial advice. Always conduct personal research before investing in any cryptocurrency. The volatile nature of cryptocurrencies means they\u2019re not suitable for everyone. If any of these coins, be it ScapesMania, Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), Carnado (ADA), or Litecoin (LTC) resonate with you, ensure you\u2019re well-informed about their market dynamics, potential growth, and any regional restrictions or requirements. A careful review of ScapesMania\u2019s official website and community can offer clarity regarding restrictions and other essential information concerning eligibility requirements.\n\nSite: https://scapesmania.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/scapesmania\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

Meanwhile, the global cryptocurrency market cap declined 0.5% to around $1.09 trillion in the last 24 hours.Bitcoin was down 0.5% at $27,806, while Ethereum was below the $1,650 level.XRP, Solana, Dogecoin , Polygon, Polkadot, and Litecoin were trading in the red, while Toncoin was trading in the green.\"Bitcoin has been trading close to the $28000 level over the weekend.

Geopolitical uncertainty became a factor for traders during this period. The price of BTC exhibited resilience, avoiding significant downward volatility over the weekend. It recovered from a sudden test of the $27,000 level on October 6th, primarily due to surprising employment data in the United States that contrasted with policy adjustments by the Federal Reserve. As the new week began, the $28,000 resistance level became the primary focus for market participants.Bitcoin, after testing the crucial support level of $25,000 (Horizontal Trendline & 50% Fibonacci Retracement Level) has witnessed a relief rally and the prices went up to $28,580. The asset broke the downsloping trendline. However, it failed to break the resistance of $28,500. Currently, BTC is consolidating from $28,250 to $27,000. Once it breaks and sustains above $28,500, it may go up to $32,500 and to witness a rally, BTC needs to break, close and maintain above the key resistance level of $32,500.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "title": "Ethereum Futures ETFs launch to little fanfare as institutional tokenization efforts grow - CityAM - City A.M.",
        "content": "Ethereum Futures ETFs launch to little fanfare as institutional tokenization efforts grow\n\nData from CryptoCompare shows that the price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) moved sideways throughout most of the past week, starting at around $28,000 and dropping to roughly $27,500 after a sell-off over the weekend.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Ether, the second-largest digital asset by market capitalisation, saw a more pronounced decline over the week, starting above the $1,700 mark and now trading below $1,600.\n\nHeadlines in the cryptocurrency space this week were partly focused on the recent launch of Ether Futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. The products had a notably slow first day of trading, with less-than-stellar trading volumes reported across the board.\n\nWith a total of nine Ether futures ETFs launched early in the week, trading volumes were below $2 million on debut. Five of the ETFs only invest in Ether futures, while the other four combine them with Bitcoin futures contracts as well.\n\nOne of the more popular ETFs, EFUT by VanEck, had a trading volume of only $425,000, with an average price of $17 per share and about 25,000 shares traded. In comparison, ProShares\u2019 Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), had a trading volume of over $1 billion on its debut day back in October 2021, although it launched during a crypto bull market.\n\nNOW TRADING: The VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF, $EFUT.\n\n\n\nThe transformation happens when enough of us are ready. #EnterTheEther. pic.twitter.com/cb2KMG3wfW \u2014 VanEck (@vaneck_us) October 2, 2023\n\nBefore the Ether futures ETFs were launched, VanEck had announced it plans to allocate 10% of the profit generated from its EFUT offering to Ethereum\u2019s core developers for a period of \u201cat least 10 years.\u201d\n\nThe beneficiary of the act will be the Protocol Guild, a group that works on the development, governance, and improvement of the Ethereum protocol. It comprises developers, researchers, and other vital participants collaborating on the network.\n\nThe launch of these ETFs prompted Grayscale Investments, which has been trying to turn its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF, is now planning to do the same for its Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), aiming to turn it into a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nUBS pilots tokenized money market fund on Ethereum\n\nEthereum also saw UBS Asset Management, a global giant in the fund industry, launch its first \u201clive pilot\u201d of a money market fund tokenized on the Ethereum blockchain. The pilot lets the firm experiment with different fund operations on-chain, such as buying and selling shares.\n\nThe move came during the same week it was revealed during a panel discussion at CCData\u2019s Digital Asset Summit in London by Tyrone Lobban, Head of Blockchain Launch and Onyx Digital Assets at JPMorgan, that an overwhelming 99.9% of the firm\u2019s client conversations are centered on the tokenization of traditional financial assets rather than on cryptocurrencies.\n\nLobban observed that in the past year, nearly all major global bank, broker-dealer, or asset manager has started some kind of blockchain-related activity, either on permissioned or public blockchains. These initiatives are still in the testing phase, but the determination to exploit blockchain\u2019s potential is clear.\n\nOn JPMorgan\u2019s Onyx platform, financial institutions like Goldman Sachs, DBS, and BNP are running nodes and creating tokens for assets. The platform also enables clients to do repurchase agreements, or repos, with tokenized treasuries as collateral.\n\nFTX employees unearthed secret code favouring Alameda before the collapse\n\nAccording to reports some US-based employees of the now collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX found a secret feature on the platform\u2019s code allowing it to let its sister company Alameda Research access billions of dollars of customer funds.\n\nThe discovery was made before the firm collapsed in November 2022 amid a bank run. Those who uncovered the secret feature in FTX\u2019s code informed their division head, who spoke to one of the top executives of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. But nothing was done to resolve the problem.\n\nIn 2022, the leader of the team that challenged Alameda\u2019s access to customer funds was fired and the secret feature is now crucial evidence in the fraud case against Bankman-Fried, who is facing a criminal trial in a federal court in New York.\n\nThe former FTX boss has rejected any wrongdoing, but prosecutors say he took funds from FTX\u2019s customers partly by using the hidden feature. Court documents showed that inside FTX\u2019s code there was a hidden line that allowed Alameda to have a negative balance of up to $65 billion.\n\nAlameda line of credit from FTX: $65 Billion\n\n\n\nOther traders max line of credit from FTX: $1-10 Million pic.twitter.com/mzniCjmP9h \u2014 Rhett Creighton (@rhett_creighton) October 9, 2023\n\nFTX\u2019s regular users had to follow an automatic liquidation process that made them sell their assets before their balances went below zero.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suffered a major setback in its lawsuit against Ripple, the crypto firm associated with the XRP token, when a federal judge denied its motion for an interlocutory appeal.\n\nFrancisco Memoria is a content creator at CryptoCompare who\u2019s in love with technology and focuses on helping people see the value digital currencies have.

        "title": "Cryptocurrency Price Today: Israel-Hamas War Paints The Market Red, BTC Remains Under $28,000 - ABP Live",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s oldest and most valued cryptocurrency, failed to rise above the $28,000 mark over the weekend as popular altcoins \u2014 including the likes of Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC) \u2014 landed in the reds across the board. The stymying of price growth is largely caused due to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. However, the CoinMarketCap Market Fear & Greed Index stands at 45, which means investors are choosing to remain neutral for the time being, to see how things develop before taking any drastic calls.\n\nThe global crypto market cap stood at $1.09 trillion at the time of writing, registering a 24-hour dip of 0.47 percent.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Today\n\nBitcoin price stood at $27,939.49, registering a 24-hour loss of 0.23 percent, as per CoinMarketCap. According to Indian exchange WazirX, BTC price stood at Rs 23.91 lakh.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Today\n\nETH price stood at $1,634.72, marking a 24-hour dip of 0.09 percent at the time of writing. As per WazirX, Ethereum price in India stood at Rs 1.39 lakh.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) Price Today\n\nDOGE registered a 24-hour loss of 0.90 percent, as per CoinMarketCap data, currently priced at $0.06095. As per WazirX, Dogecoin price in India stood at Rs 5.22.\n\nLitecoin (LTC) Price Today\n\nLitecoin saw a 24-hour loss of 1.13 percent. At the time of writing, it was trading at $65.08. LTC price in India stood at Rs 5,520.10.\n\nRipple (XRP) Price Today\n\nXRP price stood at $0.5193, seeing a 24-hour dip of 0.61 percent. As per WazirX, Ripple price stood at Rs 44.60.\n\nSolana (SOL) Price Today\n\nSolana price stood at $23.27, marking a 24-hour loss of 1.04 percent. As per WazirX, SOL price in India stood at Rs 1,962.74.\n\nTop Crypto Gainers Today (October 9)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto gainers over the past 24 hours:\n\nLido DAO (LDO)\n\nPrice: $1.61\n\n24-hour gain: 2.33 percent\n\nTether Gold (XAUt)\n\nPrice: $1,860.28\n\n24-hour gain: 1.17 percent\n\nMultiversX (EGLD)\n\nPrice: $24.50\n\n24-hour gain: 0.94 percent\n\nIOTA (IOTA)\n\nPrice: $0.1565\n\n24-hour gain: 0.90 percent\n\nAlgorand (ALGO)\n\nPrice: $0.1011\n\n24-hour gain: 0.89 percent\n\nTop Crypto Losers Today (October 9)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto losers over the past 24 hours:\n\nAvalanche (AVAX)\n\nPrice: $9.97\n\n24-hour loss: 5.18 percent\n\nZcash (ZEC)\n\nPrice: $26.18\n\n24-hour loss: 3.41 percent\n\ndYdX (DYDX)\n\nPrice: $2.03\n\n24-hour loss: 2.88 percent\n\nBitcoin SV (BSV)\n\nPrice: $34.40\n\n24-hour loss: 2.87 percent\n\nStacks (STX)\n\nPrice: $0.5095\n\n24-hour loss: 2.58 percent\n\nWhat Crypto Exchanges Are Saying About Current Market Scenario\n\nMudrex co-founder and CEO Edul Patel told ABP Live, \u201cThe weekend saw Bitcoin trading in the vicinity of the $28,000 mark. This price movement coincided with the release of US Non-farm payroll data, which revealed the addition of 336,000 jobs in September, exceeding economist predictions of 170,000. This positive NFP report reflects an uptick in economic health and a resilient job market. Should Bitcoin sustain its position comfortably above its current level, it could potentially breach the $28,350 level. If not, there is support at the $27,800 level. Meanwhile, Ethereum has been trading above the $1620 level.\u201d\n\nParth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures, said, \u201cThe crypto market has been on a slight but gradual decline in the last 24 hours and over the weekend. As per CoinGecko, the global crypto M.Cap is down -0.2 percent since yesterday, but continues to be above $1.12 trillion. The crypto fear and greed index maintained its position in the neutral zone around the score of 50/100; no change in the last 24 hours. Trading close to $28,000, BTC (-0.2 percent) has been maintaining firm support at $27,000. Even though there has been a BTC sell-off from short-term holders, the support levels come in as long-term holders are buying more. In fact, last week, the supply held by the long-term buyers stood at 15.6 million BTCs, as opposed to the short-term holder supply of 3.8 million BTCs \u2014 the first time since November 2015. The market believes in a bull trend for BTC if consolidation continues, and BTC crosses the $28,000 resistance level.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin appears poised to challenge its $28,000 resistance level, and the prevailing sentiment suggests it may succeed. This marks a notable shift from the fear that dominated the market for most of the previous month. Additionally, Bitcoin's bollinger bands indicate that the market is currently in a consolidation phase.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin price currently is $27,950 . It is essential for traders and investors to closely monitor Bitcoin price dynamics. Bitcoin is currently facing a key resistance at $28,350 and a break of this level could pave the way for further gains at $29,400 and $30,785. Conversely, if the Bears take control, the support zones at $26,630, $25,260 and $24,556 come into play. Examining technical indicators, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering at 48, suggesting a somewhat neutral sentiment, albeit slightly bearish below 50. The 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $27,500 is serving as strong short-term bullish support.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cThe overall crypto market has been restricted under $1.10 trillion for the past few weeks due to the hawkish stance of the US fed and other macroeconomic factors. The latest tension between Israel and Hamas may result in further downslides across financial markets as it disturbs the peace equation involving multiple countries. Israel is an active player in Bitcoin mining and other blockchain-related activities and any disruption in the mining process may result in BTC hash rate going through the roof.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cOver the weekend, Bitcoin (BTC) showed resilience by holding its ground, trading just below the pivotal $28,000 level. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) maintained a position above the support level of $1,612. What's particularly intriguing is that this stability coincides with a backdrop of global uncertainty, such as the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict. In times of turbulence, crypto emerges as a beacon of opportunity for investors. They provide stability, open doors to cross-border financial transactions, and offer top-notch security, making them a compelling and secure choice for savvy investors seeking refuge in these uncertain times.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "title": "ETH20 Presale: Offering A Throwback To April 2014\u2019s Ethereum For Just $0.1 And Stake-To-Earn Incentives. - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, Ethereum has long cemented its position as the second-largest crypto leader with an impressive market cap of $200B. Known for its robust credibility and \u2018blue-chip\u2019 status, Ethereum seemed a promising investment till it hit saturation. Today, the dream of making multifold returns from Ethereum in 2023 seems far-fetched, especially given its current market position.\n\nHowever, what if you could turn back the hands of time to 2014 when investing in Ethereum for just $0.1 would be a possibility? Well, ETH20 is here to make that \u2018what if\u2019 a reality.\n\nETH20: Echoing Ethereum\u2019s Embryonic Stage\n\nThe latest name to stir the crypto market is ETH20, an ERC-20 crypto token that operates on the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol. Built atop the Ethereum blockchain, ETH20 aims to recreate the magic of Ethereum\u2019s early days promising a unique investment opportunity coupled with the potential for considerable passive income.\n\nJust as Ethereum in April 2014, ETH20\u2019s presale holds an initial circulating supply of 30 million tokens, each priced at a paltry $0.1. But that\u2019s not all. The project also lets early investors earn significant passive income through an Ethereum-based staking contract and also offers the opportunity to mint a unique NFT collection.\n\nThe ETH20 Strategy: Staking, Minting, and More\n\nETH20 has a total supply of 120 million tokens. Of these, 30 million tokens are up for grabs during the presale, each priced at $0.1. The project has earmarked a whopping 78 million tokens from the total supply to reward network participants through staking. Additionally, 12 million tokens have been specifically allocated for liquidity.\n\nETH20, a green, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) token, leverages the power of staking smart contracts to provide a secure, efficient, and flexible platform for digital transactions. Further, the project has adopted Ethereum\u2019s 12-second block rewards strategy for the distribution of rewards, offering staking returns to all members based on their proportionate share in the staking pool and the prevailing annual percentage yield.\n\nThe contract code of ETH20 has undergone a thorough manual audit by Coinsult and has been hailed as utterly secure. This bolsters faith and assurance in the ETH20 platform, marking a triumphant stride in the project\u2019s commitment to secure cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nTaking a Deep Dive into the NFT World with ETH20\n\nAnd the excitement doesn\u2019t end there! ETH20 is your ticket to an entirely new realm of collectibles \u2014 NFTs! ETH20 introduces the ETH20 Avatar NFT Collection, a dazzling array of 10,000 unique NFTs that encapsulate the essence of Ethereum and the artistic charm of pixel art. These digital collectibles are further enhanced with the ETH20 emblem, making them even more desirable.\n\nBy investing a minimum of $200 in ETH20 tokens, early investors can unlock the opportunity to mint a top-tier profile picture (PFP) NFT or multiple NFTs from the exclusive ETH20 Avatar NFT Collection, free of cost! Once the minting process is completed, investors can instantly reveal and initiate trading their NFTs on OpenSea. This prime opportunity can lead to considerable returns, particularly advantageous for those who seize the initiative early.\n\nThe Clock is Ticking: Seize Your Share of Crypto History\n\nThe ETH20 presale is in full swing but won\u2019t last forever. This is your chance to grab a piece of crypto history and relive the exhilarating early days of Ethereum, while also securing your financial future.\n\nETH20 tokens are available for purchase at a mere $0.1 each on the ETH20 website. Remember, the early bird gets the worm, and in this case, the early investor gets the chance to potentially earn substantial returns. So, don\u2019t delay, secure your ETH20 tokens today!\n\nVisit ETH20 Presale\n\n."

        "title": "Ethereum: slight growth in ETH inflation - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Since partial fee burns have been introduced on the Ethereum network, ETH\u2019s inflation has reduced dramatically, so that at times it becomes a deflationary currency.\n\nBut it can happen, as has happened recently, that it becomes inflationary again instead.\n\nThe inflation of Ethereum (ETH)\n\n\u201cInflation\u201d in crypto does not mean price increases, that is, the loss of purchasing power of coins. Instead, it means the eventual increase in the money supply, the so-called circulating supply.\n\nAs can be seen directly on Etherscan, until August 2021 the circulating supply of ETH increased sharply and very steadily.\n\nIn other words, ETH until a couple of years ago was an inflationary currency.\n\nBut then there was a change, due to the introduction of partial fee burns. Suffice it to say that between September 2021 and February 2022 the supply only increased by less than one million units, out of 117 million.\n\nBy the end of 2021, the inflation of Ethereum\u2019s money supply had fallen to 3.5 %, from 4.6 % in 2020.\n\nBut it was from 2022 onward that the effects of partial fee burns were most felt, partly due to the move to Proof-of-Stake.\n\nIn fact, last year ended with ETH\u2019s money supply inflation of only 2%, or less than half of two years earlier.\n\nThe metrics of 2023\n\nThe fee burn, however, is not constant because, precisely, it depends on how many fees are paid.\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, the average cost per transaction on the Ethereum blockchain rose above $4, then also rose above $6 in February. In mid-April it also jumped above $15, and in early May it even came close to $30.\n\nBy June it was down again to $4, but in July it was back above $6.\n\nStarting in September, however, it returned first below $4, and then even lately below $2.\n\nIn the months when the fees paid by users of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain were higher, the burns were also higher, so that ETH for a few months became a deflationary coin.\n\n2023 opened with a circulating supply of about 120.5 million ETH, and by June it had fallen to just over 120.2 million. That is, the first half of 2023 closed with negative ETH money supply inflation of about -0.25%. The lowest peak of 2023 occurred in August with less than 120.22 million ETH in circulation.\n\nThereafter, however, fees fell, and so did partial fee burns. Currently the circulating supply has risen a little since June, settling just below 120.25 million ETH.\n\nIn other words over the past two months there has been a not at all worrisome increase of 0.02%. Acquired inflation since the beginning of the year however remains negative at -0.22%.\n\nEthereum\u2019s (ETH) fluctuating inflation\n\nThe fluctuating inflation rate of the ETH money supply is due to the fact that there are two phenomena taking place simultaneously.\n\nThe first is the continuous creation of new ETH to remunerate validator nodes that validate transactions, and the second is precisely the partial burn of fees. The rate at which new ETHs are created is essentially invariable, but the burn of fees varies depending on the fees. The fewer fees are paid the less ETH is burned.\n\nThis results in ETH not having a fixed and predictable inflation rate, but a variable one. However, this variability is within a very narrow range, always less than 1 % per year, both positive and negative.\n\nBy contrast, for Bitcoin, for example, the money supply inflation rate is fixed and predictable, and actually halves every four years or so, with halving.\n\nAll this makes Bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy appear to be prefixed and predictable, while Ethereum\u2019s is not. Moreover, Bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy has never been changed, and no one is actually able to change it, while Ethereum\u2019s has already been changed several times, and no one knows for sure whether it will remain identical to the current one in the future.\n\nETH is not a deflationary currency\n\nAfter the introduction of the fee burn, and especially after the move to Proof-of-Work, ETH by some had been called a deflationary currency.\n\nThe numbers above reveal that it is incorrect to call it such, because it is deflationary only at times. Instead, at other times it reverts to inflationary.\n\nInstead, it is a currency with a variable rate of inflation of the money supply, although generally very limited, and probably negative in the long run.\n\nMoreover, since there is no certainty that this monetary policy will remain unchanged in the future, it is not even possible to say that ETH has a deflationary nature, while for example BTC does, since it inevitably tends, in the long run, toward deflation.\n\nAs for Ethereum much depends on its usage, because higher usage means higher fees, and therefore higher ETH burns."
