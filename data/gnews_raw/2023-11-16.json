        "content": "Nocturne, a protocol that enables private accounts on Ethereum, has launched its first version on mainnet.\n\nThe protocol is designed so that users are able to deposit or receive funds privately on what Vitalik Buterin calls stealth addresses.\n\nThis means that users can generate a secret spending and viewing key, which can then be used to create multiple meta-addresses that can be used to interact with other accounts.\n\nThese addresses are held within Nocturne smart contracts and are intended to be used to trade what the company refers to as \u2018hot assets,\u2019 or crypto assets that are not designed to be held.\n\nAccording to Nocturne, its smart accounts will be compatible with DeFi protocols that \u201crepresent state via output tokens.\u201d This means that it will only be compatible with tokens that are made valuable from a previous input \u2014 or tokens where a user must deposit collateral in order to mint the token.\n\nSuch tokens could include Uniswap liquidity tokens, Aave\u2019s aTokens, and Compound\u2019s cTokens.\n\nThere are plans to later extend smart account compatibility to arbitrary protocols with the help of zero-knowledge technology, which can prove ownership of assets without revealing the details of the assets owned themselves, Nocturne notes.\n\nLuke Tchang, CEO and co-founder of Nocturne, noted in a press release reviewed by Blockworks that the company is moving away from simply being a \u2018privacy tool.\u2019\n\n\u201cPrivacy should be embedded at the account layer and the v1 launch is the first step in making this possible,\u201d Tchang said. \u201cOur goal is to ensure that everyone, from individual users to large institutions, can transact securely without exposing their financial history to the world.\u201d\n\nUsers who wish to access Nocturne v1 can do so through a private vault user interface. The current capabilities of the interface are limited to deposits, transfer of tokens to burner addresses, and private swapping and staking, the company said.\n\nFuture versions of the protocol include the migration of a \u2018proof-of-innocence\u2019 protocol that can prove transactions are verified without revealing any information about the user\u2019s identity and further usability and functionality of Nocturne wallets by enabling compatibility with arbitrary smart contracts.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum vs Avalanche: The Ultimate Battle - Blockgeeks",
        "content": "In this blog post, we delve into the clash between two heavyweights in the cryptocurrency world: Ethereum vs Avalanche.\n\nEthereum, with its smart contract functionality, has long been at the forefront of blockchain innovation in the world of cryptocurrency. Its efficient transactions and ability to handle many transactions make it a popular choice for users. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s smart contract capabilities have paved the way for the rise of NFTs. But don\u2019t underestimate the rising star \u2013 Avalanche. This newer blockchain network promises efficient transactions, with low fees and high scalability, making it a formidable contender for many cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nBoth Ethereum and Avalanche have their own native tokens \u2013 ETH and AVAX respectively \u2013 fueling their respective cryptocurrency networks. These platforms operate on a platform chain architecture and also support the creation and trading of NFTs. While Ethereum, the leading cryptocurrency in the market, boasts a larger user base and an established ecosystem, Avalanche is gaining ground as a strong contender. With its former Elrond validators and platform chain approach, Avalanche is emerging as a potential winner in the growing market of NFTs.\n\nSo buckle up as we embark on this thrilling journey of speed, where the pos winner will be determined by the system!\n\nComparison of Ethereum vs Avalanche\n\nScalability\n\nEthereum, the former elrond system, faces scalability challenges that hinder its speed and place it behind other blockchain platforms in the race to be the winner. This is primarily due to ethereum v2\u2019s current consensus mechanism, which results in slower transaction speeds on the chain. However, there are efforts to address the scalability issue in Ethereum\u2019s chain speed through the development of Layer 2 solutions like Optimism and Elrond.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum v2 and Elrond take a different approach to scalability by implementing their own chain. Avalanche, on the other hand, takes a different approach to scalability. It utilizes a unique consensus protocol called Avalanche consensus, which enables high throughput and fast confirmation times. This makes it an ideal choice for projects that are built on the ethereum v2 chain or the elrond chain. This means that transactions can be processed quickly and efficiently on the Avalanche network, a chain that utilizes the Elrond protocol. As a result, Avalanche has become an attractive alternative to Ethereum for applications requiring high transaction volumes in the elrond chain.\n\nInteroperability\n\nInteroperability, including elrond, is essential for facilitating smooth communication and data exchange across various blockchains or networks. Ethereum and Elrond have made significant strides in achieving interoperability through projects like Polkadot, Cosmos, Chainlink, and Elrond. These projects allow Ethereum to connect with other blockchains like Elrond and share information effectively.\n\nAvalanche, a blockchain platform, also recognizes the importance of interoperability and supports it through the use of bridges. This allows for seamless connectivity between Avalanche and other chains.\n\nDecentralization\n\nDecentralization is a fundamental principle of blockchain technology that ensures no single entity, including elrond, has complete control over the network. In terms of decentralization, both Ethereum and Avalanche have their own approaches.\n\nEthereum currently follows a proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm where stakers validate transactions on the Ethereum chain.\n\nAvalanche takes a hybrid approach by combining Proof of Stake (PoS) with elements of Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) to create a chain. This combination aims to achieve both security and decentralization on the network chain. By utilizing the Avalanche chain hybrid consensus mechanism, Avalanche strives to maintain a robust and decentralized ecosystem.\n\nThe level of decentralization achieved by both blockchain platforms has implications for their resilience against attacks and censorship resistance. A more decentralized network, often referred to as a chain, is generally considered to be more secure and less susceptible to manipulation.\n\nHow Ethereum Works\n\nEthereum is a decentralized virtual machine that powers the world of cryptocurrencies through its blockchain chain. It operates as a platform for executing smart contracts and running decentralized applications (dApps) on the chain. Let\u2019s take a closer look at how Ethereum works.\n\nEthereum Network: A Decentralized Virtual Machine\n\nAt its core, Ethereum functions as a decentralized virtual machine. It provides developers with the infrastructure to build and deploy smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements written in code. These smart contracts enable the creation of dApps that can perform various functions without the need for intermediaries.\n\nStoring Transactions and Smart Contract Interactions\n\nOne of Ethereum\u2018s key features is its blockchain, which serves as a digital ledger that records all transactions and interactions with smart contracts. The blockchain stores a complete history of every transaction made on the network, making it transparent and immutable.\n\nWhen someone initiates a transaction or interacts with a smart contract on the Ethereum network, this information is added to a block. Each block contains a unique identifier called a hash and is linked to the previous blocks, forming an unbroken chain of transactions known as the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nSolidity: The Language of Smart Contracts\n\nTo create smart contracts on Ethereum, developers use Solidity programming language. Solidity allows them to write code that defines the rules and conditions for executing these contracts. Once deployed on the network, these smart contracts become accessible to anyone with an internet connection.\n\nSolidity offers powerful features like inheritance, libraries, and interfaces that make it easier for developers to build complex applications on top of Ethereum. It also includes built-in security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities like reentrancy attacks or integer overflows.\n\nGas Fees: Prioritizing Transactions\n\nTo prevent network congestion and prioritize transactions, Ethereum relies on gas fees. Gas is essentially the fuel required to execute operations within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Every operation in an EVM consumes a certain amount of gas, and users must pay these fees to have their transactions processed.\n\nGas fees serve two purposes: incentivizing miners to include transactions in blocks and preventing malicious actors from spamming the network. By attaching a higher gas fee to their transactions, users can ensure that their transactions are prioritized by miners and processed faster.\n\nThe Contract Chain: Enabling Interoperability\n\nWith the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, Ethereum is set to introduce significant improvements, including the introduction of shard chains. These shard chains will enhance scalability by dividing the network\u2019s workload among multiple chains.\n\nOne of these shard chains is called the \u201ccontract chain,\u201d which will focus specifically on executing smart contracts. This separation allows for greater efficiency and parallel processing of contract execution, enabling Ethereum to handle a larger number of transactions and dApps simultaneously.\n\nHow Avalanche Works\n\nAvalanche is an innovative blockchain platform that operates on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure known as the Avalanche protocol. This unique consensus mechanism allows for high scalability, parallel processing of transactions, and fast finality.\n\nMultiple Subnets for Parallel Processing\n\nOne of the key features of Avalanche is its ability to support multiple subnets within the network. These subnets enable parallel processing of transactions, which means that multiple transactions can be validated simultaneously. This greatly enhances the scalability of the network and ensures that it can handle a large number of transactions efficiently.\n\nRepeated Voting Rounds for Consensus\n\nValidators in the Avalanche network reach consensus through repeated voting rounds. During each round, validators vote on valid transactions and proposals. The voting process continues until a threshold is reached, at which point finality is achieved. This means that once a transaction has been confirmed by the network, it cannot be reversed or altered.\n\nThe repeated voting rounds allow for quick finality, ensuring that transactions are settled rapidly and reducing the risk of double-spending or other malicious activities. It also provides security against attacks such as 51% attacks, where a single entity controls more than half of the network\u2019s computing power.\n\nScalability without Compromising Security or Decentralization\n\nAvalanche\u2019s consensus mechanism enables high scalability without compromising security or decentralization. By allowing parallel processing and quick finality, it can handle a large number of transactions per second while maintaining the integrity and security of the network.\n\nThis scalability makes Avalanche well-suited for applications that require high throughput and low latency, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming platforms, and supply chain management systems.\n\nFurthermore, Avalanche employs a robust system for selecting validators to participate in the consensus process. Validators are chosen based on their stake in the network, ensuring that those with a significant investment have an incentive to act honestly and maintain the integrity of the network.\n\nUse Cases and Applications\n\nAvalanche\u2019s unique consensus mechanism opens up a wide range of possibilities for blockchain applications. Its high scalability and fast finality make it ideal for use cases that require quick settlement of transactions, such as micropayments, real-time gaming, and decentralized exchanges.\n\nMoreover, Avalanche\u2019s ability to support multiple subnets allows for the creation of specialized networks tailored to specific use cases. For example, developers can create subnets dedicated to DeFi applications or supply chain management systems, each with its own set of validators and rules.\n\nToken Comparison between Ethereum vs Avalanche\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrencies, tokens play a crucial role in facilitating transactions and powering decentralized applications (dApps). Two prominent blockchain networks that utilize their native tokens are Ethereum and Avalanche. Let\u2019s compare these tokens to understand their unique features and benefits.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Utility Token: ETH\n\nEthereum, often referred to as the pioneer of smart contract platforms, has its native token called ETH. This token serves a dual purpose within the Ethereum ecosystem. Firstly, it acts as a utility token for transaction fees on the network. Whenever users perform any action on Ethereum, such as executing a smart contract or transferring funds, they need to pay transaction fees in ETH.\n\nSecondly, ETH also functions as a store of value. Similar to how people invest in traditional assets like gold or stocks, individuals can hold ETH as an investment with the expectation that its value will appreciate over time. The market capitalization of ETH is substantial due to its longer existence and wider adoption compared to other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAvalanche\u2019s Native Token: AVAX\n\nOn the other hand, Avalanche introduces its native token known as AVAX. Just like ETH on Ethereum, AVAX is used for transaction fees within the Avalanche network. Users must pay AVAX when conducting any activity on this blockchain platform.\n\nHowever, AVAX goes beyond being just a utility token for transactions. It also plays an essential role in staking and governance participation within the Avalanche ecosystem. Staking involves locking up AVAX tokens to support network security and consensus mechanisms while earning rewards in return. Holders of AVAX have voting rights regarding protocol upgrades and changes through governance participation.\n\nMarket Capitalization Comparison\n\nWhen comparing market capitalizations between these two tokens, it is clear that ETH currently holds a larger share than AVAX due to its longer history and broader user base. However, it\u2019s important to note that market capitalization alone does not determine the value or potential of a token. Both ETH and AVAX have unique characteristics and cater to different ecosystems.\n\nFactors Influencing Value\n\nThe value of ETH is influenced by various factors, including the demand for dApps built on the Ethereum platform. As more developers and users adopt Ethereum for creating decentralized applications, the demand for ETH increases, potentially driving up its value. Market sentiment, technological advancements, and regulatory developments can also impact the value of ETH.\n\nOn the other hand, AVAX\u2019s value is closely tied to the growth and expansion of the Avalanche ecosystem. The success of new projects launching on Avalanche, increased adoption by developers and users, and improvements in network scalability can all contribute to an increase in AVAX\u2019s value over time.\n\nFee Comparison between Ethereum and Avalanche\n\nEthereum, one of the most popular blockchain platforms, has faced a significant challenge. This limitation is primarily due to its limited scalability. However, Avalanche aims to address this issue by offering low transaction fees even during peak usage, leveraging its scalable architecture.\n\nEthereum\u2019s High Transaction Fees\n\nDuring times of high demand on the Ethereum network, users have experienced exorbitant transaction fees. This can be attributed to the network\u2019s limited scalability, which leads to congestion and increased competition for block space. As a result, users often find themselves paying hefty fees just to complete their transactions in a timely manner.\n\nAvalanche\u2019s Low Transaction Fees\n\nAvalanche sets itself apart from Ethereum by providing low transaction fees even during periods of high network activity. Its scalable architecture allows for faster processing times and higher throughput, ensuring that transactions can be executed at a lower cost. This makes Avalanche an attractive option for users who are seeking cost-effective blockchain solutions.\n\nFactors Affecting Fee Structure\n\nThe fee structure on both Ethereum and Avalanche varies based on several factors. These factors include network demand and the gas optimization techniques employed by developers.\n\nOn Ethereum, gas fees are determined by the complexity of smart contracts and the amount of computational resources required to execute them. During times of heavy traffic, these fees can skyrocket as users compete for block space.\n\nAvalanche also utilizes gas fees but with a different approach. It employs a unique consensus mechanism called Avalanche consensus, which allows for sub-second finality without sacrificing security or decentralization. This efficient consensus mechanism contributes to lower transaction costs on the platform.\n\nCost-Effectiveness of Avalanche\n\nWith its low transaction fees even during peak usage, Avalanche offers a cost-effective alternative to Ethereum. Users who are looking for affordable blockchain solutions can benefit from Avalanche\u2019s scalable architecture and efficient fee structure.\n\nBy choosing Avalanche over Ethereum, users can save significantly on transaction fees, especially during times of high network congestion. This cost-effectiveness makes Avalanche an appealing option for individuals and businesses alike.\n\nDeFi Comparison between Ethereum and Avalanche\n\nWe discussed how Ethereum has established itself as a pioneer in the world of blockchain and DeFi, with a wide range of applications and a large developer community. On the other hand, Avalanche offers faster transaction speeds and lower fees, making it an attractive alternative for users looking for efficiency.\n\nWhile Ethereum remains dominant in terms of adoption and ecosystem maturity, Avalanche\u2019s innovative consensus mechanism and interoperability features make it a promising contender. It provides an environment that enables developers to build scalable DeFi applications without compromising on security or decentralization.\n\nAs you consider which platform to choose for your DeFi needs, it\u2019s important to evaluate your specific requirements. If you prioritize network effects, extensive developer support, and a wide range of existing DeFi projects, Ethereum may be the right choice for you. However, if speed, low fees, and scalability are your primary concerns, then Avalanche might offer a more suitable solution.\n\nUltimately, both platforms have their strengths and weaknesses. It\u2019s crucial to stay informed about new developments in this rapidly evolving space. Keep exploring different options as technology progresses to find the best fit for your needs.

        "title": "Ethereum Tests Crucial Support But Won\u2019t Drop Below $1,850: Here\u2019s Why To Be Bullish On ETH Price - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "In recent hours, the market has experienced significant liquidations. Bitcoin\u2019s price touched the $38K resistance mark only to trigger sellers to open short positions. Consequently, the price of Bitcoin nearly dropped by $1,000, while Ethereum\u2019s price lost its momentum above $2,000, now hovering around a critical support level. Despite this, Ethereum is showing signs of a comeback. On-chain metrics indicate an increasing accumulation, which is acting as a buffer against any decline.\n\nETHBTC Touches 1-Week Low\n\nThe latest data from Coinglass indicates significant market movements. In the past 24 hours, there was a liquidation event as Ethereum (ETH) struggled to maintain its value above $2,000. This downturn led to the liquidation of long positions worth approximately $37.5 million, strengthening the resistance level as the price did not meet buyers\u2019 expectations.\n\nFurther insights from TradingView show that the ETH/BTC pair has reached its lowest point of the week, trading at 0.053. This trend points to an increase in selling activities in the market. Additionally, there appears to be a decreased interest from major investors, or \u201cwhales,\u201d as Ethereum\u2019s price could not surpass the $2,100 threshold. Data from IntoTheBlock reveals a decline in whale transactions, dropping from a high of $6.6 billion to around $4 billion.\n\nThe potential for a decrease in Ethereum\u2019s price may not be significant this time, as BlackRock\u2019s initiative for a spot ETH ETF appears to have a positive impact, potentially maintaining the altcoin\u2019s price in a favorable buying zone.\n\nThe NVT (Network Value to Transactions) ratio has been fairly steady around 48.3. This stability indicates that even though the network value has dropped due to a decrease in price, the volume of Ethereum transactions has remained high enough to keep the NVT ratio balanced. Therefore, it supports ETH\u2019s price to hold above $1,850.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nEther\u2019s value fluctuated notably, with the price attempting to decline below $1,900. However, bulls continue to put pressure, keeping the price above EMA200. As of writing, the ETH price trades at $1,936, declining over 4.55 from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nHowever, the inability of the bulls to convert the $2,000 threshold into a stable support point is a concerning indicator. However, the positive move is that the buyers were able to maintain the price above the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) on the daily chart. Should the buyers manage to sustain ETH\u2019s value above $2,000, it could be a sign of strong purchasing activity at lower price points. In such a scenario, the price might aim to reach the higher zone, ranging from $2,140 to $2,200.\n\nOn the bearish side, if ETH\u2019s price decreases and falls below the 200-day EMA on the 4-h chart, it would suggest a comeback of bearish momentum. Such a downturn could potentially lead to a further drop towards $1,750."

At the time, Gensler appeared to be reflecting the opinion expressed by the SEC's former Director of Corporate Finance William Hinman in his much-cited \"sufficiently decentralized\" speech of June 2018."

        "title": "Ethereum L2 Starknet aims to decentralize core components of its scaling network - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum layer-2 scaling network Starknet has outlined plans to improve the decentralization of three core components of its zero-knowledge (ZK) proof rollup solution.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Cointelegraph, StarkWare product manager and blockchain researcher Ilia Volokh outlined the firm\u2019s intent to address certain centralized elements faced across L2s and introduce solutions to Starknet to make its system more robust.\n\nStarknet operates as a validity rollup using ZK-proof technology to bundle transactions, with cryptographic proofs submitted to Ethereum to achieve security and finality for layer-2 transactions.\n\nAccording to Volokh, Starknet\u2019s protocol remains dependent on StarkWare for creating L2 blocks, computing proofs and initiating layer-1 state updates to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n\u201cIn this sense, the operation of the network is centralized. This temporary situation, until full decentralisation, is not necessarily a bad thing. Although Starkware operates the network, it cannot steal money and can\u2019t do any invalid state transitions because they require executing the verifier on Ethereum,\u201d Volokh explained.\n\nWhile Starkware remains a \u201ccentralized gateway\u201d to enter Starknet, Volokh added that the protocol is \u201c100% honest\u201d and cannot falsify transactions or information, as Ethereum\u2019s layer-1 blockchain acts as a filter.\n\nThe only tangible way in which Starknet can \u201cmisbehave\u201d is either by being idle in not relaying proofs to Ethereum or by specifically censoring certain parties from including transactions or proofs.\n\n\u201cFor example, if the sequencer decides to exclude a transaction from a particular entity, they\u2019re free to do so. As long as the other things that they are trying to promote are valid.\u201d\n\nFor Starknet, the latter consideration is part of the main reason to decentralize parts of its protocol in an effort to combat two main causes of censorship in consensus-based systems.\n\nIntentional censorship is one consideration, while \u201cnon-robust\u201d systems that have a single point of failure present another threat to decentralization, given that all network participants would be \u201ccensored\u201d if this central point caused a network or system outage.\n\n\u201cWe want to solve both of these problems, and we think the obvious solution to both of them at the same time is to have as many people operating Starknet as possible.\u201d\n\nDecentralizing these different components of Starknet\u2019s system entails varying degrees of difficulty. This includes decentralizing block production through its consensus protocol, decentralizing the proving layer, which is in charge of computing proofs for blocks and decentralizing the process of L1 state updates.\n\n\u201cI want to emphasize that it\u2019s crucial to decentralize each of them because as long as even one of them is centralized, you haven\u2019t achieved much,\u201d Volokh added before unpacking the relevant challenges of each component.\n\nDecentralizing block production has been fairly straightforward given that all blockchains rely on a consensus protocol and sybil-resistance mechanism. Meanwhile, decentralizing Starknet\u2019s prover has required a more novel approach.\n\n\u201cAs far as I know, we\u2019re the first rollup that has come out with a fairly complete and concrete solution,\u201d Volokh said. He also went on to unpack how competing ZK-rollups all essentially aggregate transactions into proofs and post them on Ethereum, which by extension transfers its own decentralization to rollup solutions.\n\nHowever, these systems all rely on respective central entities to create and prove blocks, which means these layer 2s are \u201cequally centralized.\u201d Whether end users are concerned about the philosophical implications of the centralized components of L2s is another conversation altogether for Volokh:\n\n\u201cThe people who appreciate decentralization do so because they understand that it gives more security, and we share those values more than we think people will like them for commercial reasons.\u201d\n\nVolokh added that Starknet is still in the process of outlining the process of testing and implementing these decentralized mechanics in its network. This is likely to be carried out through a series of interconnected testnets to test the simultaneous functionality of the different components.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum has once again crossed the $2,000 threshold, a level it has not seen since April 2023. This resurgence in value is not just a number on a chart; it reflects broader sentiment and the movements of significant players on the market \u2013 whales. As the second largest digital asset gained bullish strength, partly fueled by the buzz around BlackRock's potential spot Ethereum ETF, market optimism has grown for a sustained rise in the near term\u200b\u200b.\n\nWhale activity has been particularly noteworthy, with a spike in transactions to their highest levels in seven months, indicating a flurry of activity among these large capital players\u200b\u200b. This is significant because whale behaviors often prelude broader market trends; when they move, the market watches closely. While some whales have booked profits in the wake of the rally, others have gone on a buying spree, picking up 3,200 ETH coins following the price surge\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nOne whale, previously inactive for nearly three years, transferred a staggering 26,406 ETH to crypto exchange Bitfinex, realizing a profit of nearly $50 million\u200b\u200b. Another smart whale moved 25,700 ETH to Binance just before the rally, netting gains of $1.5 million as the price pumped\u200b\u200b.\n\nHowever, not all actions by whales suggest a bullish continuation. Some whale investors have been unstaking their ETH and sending them to exchanges to lock in gains, a move that could be interpreted as preparation for a potential downturn\u200b\u200b. Also, a noticeable spike in exchange-related addresses could indicate that some whales are transferring their holdings to book profits, possibly hinting at a cautionary stance toward the immediate future of the market\u200b\u200b.\n\nEthereum still aims upward\n\nSolana (SOL) has been a standout performer in recent market activity, displaying robust momentum that has seen its price secure a position well above the $60 mark. This formidable strength in price action is not without its underlying factors, and market analysts are closely monitoring the potential for a surge beyond the $70 threshold.\n\nSolana's ascent can be partly attributed to the broader market's return to risk-on sentiment, where investors are gravitating toward assets with solid fundamentals and strong use cases. Furthermore, technical indicators on the daily chart are signaling a bullish trend, with SOL consistently making higher lows and higher highs \u2013 a classic sign of a sustained uptrend.\n\nThe chart reveals a potential support level at the $60 mark, which has recently transitioned from a resistance level to a support level following its breakout. This is a bullish indicator, as what was once a ceiling for price is now a floor, suggesting that SOL has the backing of buyers at this new price point.\n\nAs for when the rally might lose steam, traders are eyeing the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and trading volume for clues. The RSI is currently in a healthy range, neither overbought nor oversold, which typically provides room for further price appreciation. However, should the RSI approach overbought territory, above 70, the likelihood of a reversal could increase as the asset may be considered overextended.\n\nCardano's bullish trend still here\n\nCardano (ADA) has been showcasing a bullish trend, as evidenced by its recent breakout, which suggests the potential for a notable price increase. The asset has experienced an impressive surge in trading volume, a strong indicator of increased buying interest and market confidence\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe ADA/USDT daily chart on Binance highlights ADA's significant uptrend. Currently navigating around $0.3690, ADA's price stands well above both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. These key indicators underscore the asset's robust bullish momentum and point toward a continuation of the upward movement\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe surge in trading volume accompanying ADA's rally is a critical factor supporting optimistic market sentiment. This increased activity is not just reflective of growing investor confidence but also reinforces the likelihood of ADA's continued rise. Analysts project a 20% leap from current levels, aiming for a price point near $0.44, assuming support levels hold firm and bullish sentiment remains intact\u200b\u200b.\n\nHowever, the inherently volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market suggests that a pullback is always within the realm of possibility. Should ADA encounter resistance or face profit-taking activities, especially around the $0.38 to $0.40 range, we might see a temporary retracement before further gains\u200b\u200b."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum and Cardano are two blockchains at loggerheads.\n\nNow, their fans are arguing about a new blog post from Vitalik Buterin.\n\nCritics say Ethereum\u2019s Plasma is simply copying Cardano\u2019s Hydra.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently posted a proposal to revive Plasma , an earlier scaling approach, in response to major advancements in zero-knowledge proofs. Meanwhile, rival blockchain Cardano continues to develop Hydra , its own layer-2 scaling solution. This has reopened debates on whether the projects are copying each other\u2019s ideas on blockchain scaling.\n\nWhat Is Plasma?\n\nFirst proposed in 2017, Plasma aims to enable faster and cheaper transactions on Ethereum by moving some data and computation off the main blockchain while retaining security guarantees. This is achieved by using sidechains that run parallel to the main Ethereum chain and only occasionally batch-commit data to the mainchain.\n\nCongratulations on implementing Cardano\u2019s Hydra \u2014 HOSKY (@hoskytoken) November 14, 2023\n\nHowever, Plasma faced challenges around client-side data availability and complex exit games. Buterin\u2019s latest proposal outlines technical improvements to Plasma, particularly using zero-knowledge proofs to enable validity proofs for off-chain transaction batches. This could resolve issues around data availability and withdrawal game complexity.\n\nWhat Is Hydra?\n\nProposed in 2020, Hydra takes a different architectural approach by using state channels instead of sidechains. State channels allow transactions between two parties to be conducted instantly and freely off-chain, with only the final settlement being committed to the main Cardano blockchain.\n\nHydra is a family of layer 2 protocols designed to make #Cardano more scalable and adaptable for various use cases that require fast and cheap transactions. The first Hydra head recently opened on mainnet. This video is a great starting point for exploring the current release,\u2026 pic.twitter.com/g1moYifGNj \u2014 Input Output (@InputOutputHK) May 4, 2023\n\nThe key difference from Plasma is that state channels manage security and state progression requirements between channel participants instead of a separate chain operator. This avoids some pitfalls of sidechains but has liveness dependencies on the mainchain.\n\nSome critics are saying Ethereum\u2019s revisited Plasma is essentially equivalent to Cardano\u2019s Hydra, but with the footnote that Cardano\u2019s use of an Unspent Transaction Output (UTxO) model makes implementing it easier. \u201cIt seems to me that #Cardano is going in the right direction and #Ethereum is the one catching up,\u201d said one pro-Cardano commentator .\n\nIterating On Shared Ideas\n\nThe copycat accusations come amidst a bitter relationship between Ethereum and Cardano founders. Steven Nerayoff, the former Ethereum advisor, swiftly criticized Buterin\u2019s Plasma proposal. He accused Buterin of copying rival blockchain Cardano\u2019s Hydra scaling approach.\n\nWhat timing! This is why I just said @Cardano_CF is my top pick in crypto. You will hear on the recording me telling @VitalikButerin he made a major mistake in getting rid of @IOHK_Charles & should bring him back. Are the clueless smug @ethereum cultists who got rid of Charles\u2026 https://t.co/x5w6yDRB4M \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 15, 2023\n\nHe labeled Buterin\u2019s decision to part ways with Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson early on as a \u201cmajor mistake.\u201d The irony, Nerayoff asserts, is Ethereum emulating the very person they once dismissed.\n\nHowever, when it comes to Hydra\u2019s and Plasma\u2019s similarities, there are certainly conceptual similarities between using secondary chains or channels to enable faster processing. However, the architectures have fundamentally distinct security assumptions and trade-offs.\n\nIn the last paper, Vitalik talked about liquid staking and on-chain governance. Now we see a paper regarding the UTxO model and something that looks a lot like Hydra. It seems to me that #Cardano is going in the right direction and #Ethereum is the one catching up. \u2014 Cardano YODA (@JaromirTesar) November 14, 2023\n\nAdditionally, building on existing areas of research is quite common in cutting-edge fields like cryptography. For example, Buterin\u2019s proposal leverages recent advances in succinct zero-knowledge proofs to improve Plasma. Scientific progress often works by incrementally improving earlier theoretical foundations. Crypto developers are also known to get a little bitchy from time to time.\n\nOngoing Quest For Scalability Solutions\n\nScalability remains one of the most pressing issues hampering mainstream blockchain adoption. Both Ethereum and Cardano are leading the charge in exploring layer-2 scaling approaches to meet user demands.\n\nThe success of Plasma, Hydra, or any other credible scaling solution will be a boon for the entire blockchain and crypto industry. It may be productive to view the problem through a lens of open intellectual discourse rather than territorial copying accusations between projects. Doing so can keep the advancement of scalability firmly tied to solving user needs."

        "content": "Validium is an innovative addition to the suite of scaling solutions helping to solve Ethereum\u2019s scalability challenges.\n\nValidium is a protocol that was introduced to improve scalability issues on the Ethereum network. In this guide, we look at what Validium is, how it works, and its benefits and challenges.\n\nWhat Is Validium?\n\nValidium is a Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution that leverages zero-knowledge proofs (zk-proofs) to verify off-chain transactions. Its primary goal is to enhance the scalability, privacy, and security of the Ethereum network.\n\nAt the solution\u2019s core are sidechains or L2 solutions linked to but handling transactions separately from the Ethereum main chain. In this way, they move transactions off-chain and help ease transactional pressure on the Ethereum network.\n\nConsequently, users can enjoy faster confirmation times while moving more volumes. Furthermore, Validium significantly reduces gas fees due to the reduced computational overhead, as it doesn\u2019t need to verify every transaction individually.\n\nHow Does Validium Work?\n\nValidium bundles sidechain transactions into batches and generates zk-proofs for each batch. Zk-proofs ensure the validity of the transactions and that the off-chain chain has been updated correctly.\n\nEvery sidechain has a validator responsible for aggregating transactions and generating zk-proofs, which are then submitted to the Ethereum mainnet for verification.\n\nIf the proof is valid, the verifiers update the mainnet record to reflect the changes that occurred in the sidechain.\n\nUse Cases and Applications of Validium in Ethereum\n\nValidium has several potential use cases and applications within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nDeFi protocols can use Validium to improve their efficiency and usability. For example, they can adopt the technology to create faster DeFi investment platforms with lower gas fees. This efficiency broadens the platform\u2019s accessibility and enhances the user experience.\n\nGaming and NFTs\n\nValidium solutions can facilitate seamless in-game transactions and interactions with NFT marketplaces due to their low fees and faster confirmation times. This provides gamers and collectors with more enjoyable experiences.\n\nSupply Chain Management\n\nThrough Validium, manufacturers can set up more efficient and transparent supply chain management systems. They can track their consignments off-chain easily and cost-efficiently without overloading the blockchain with data.\n\nKey Benefits of Validium in Ethereum\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at some of the key benefits Validium brings to Ethereum.\n\nEnhanced Scalability\n\nValidium can process thousands of transactions per second (tps), compared to the Ethereum mainnet\u2019s 15-25 tps. This feature makes it ideal for high-throughput applications like decentralized exchanges and gaming platforms. Increased throughputs are crucial to Ethereum adoption as they guarantee timely transactions.\n\nPrivacy and Security\n\nValidium uses zk-proofs to verify transactions by allowing one party to prove to another party that they know something without revealing what the thing they know is. As such, zk-proofs provide an elevated level of security for transactions, ensuring that validators cannot cheat or steal user funds. Additionally, Validium improves privacy by excluding sensitive user data from the public Ethereum blockchain.\n\nLower Transaction Fees\n\nReduced computational overhead makes Validium settlements significantly cheaper than mainnet ones. This is a major benefit for users, making Ethereum more affordable.\n\nFaster Transaction Speeds\n\nDue to its off-chain processing, Validium operations are much faster than those on the mainnet. This is important for applications that require fast and reliable transactions, such as decentralized exchanges and gaming platforms.\n\nChallenges and Limitations of Validium\n\nDespite its benefits, Validium also has some challenges and limitations.\n\nCentralization of the Network\n\nUsers must trust the validator to process transactions correctly. This could lead to centralization concerns, as few validators could control a sizable portion of the network. Introducing a trusted third party contradicts the decentralization philosophy of cryptocurrencies.\n\nInteroperability and Compatibility\n\nIntegrating Validium with existing Ethereum smart contracts and protocols can be challenging due to potential data structure incompatibilities. Ethereum developers are working on ways to ensure seamless interaction between the mainnet and its sidechains.\n\nDependence on Data Providers\n\nThe technology relies on data providers to make off-chain data available. This dependence on them introduces an element of trust that runs counter to decentralization, a central tenet of cryptocurrencies.\n\nHaving external data providers also puts the data processed on the network at risk of hacking or unauthorized access by malicious parties.\n\nConclusion\n\nValidium is important in Ethereum\u2019s journey toward scalability. Its ability to significantly improve transaction speeds, lower costs, and streamline operations is poised to redefine the network\u2019s experience, with many developers seeking to integrate it into their products."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFinancial services giant Fidelity Investments is seeking regulatory approval to launch an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that would hold the Ethereum cryptocurrency, according to a Thursday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing comes a day after BlackRock submitted its own Ethereum ETF application.\n\nThe proposed Fidelity Ethereum Fund would track the price of Ethereum, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain network. The ETF's shares would trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange under the ticker symbol ETHF.\n\nFidelity said the ETF aims \"to seek to track the performance of Ether, as measured by the performance of the Fidelity Ethereum Index.\" The index represents the U.S. dollar price of ether based on trading activity across major ether trading platforms.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"They are the seventh filer for spot Ethereum,\" Jaymes Seyffart, ETF research analyst, wrote on Twitter, noting earlier filings by BlackRock, Grayscale, 21Shares/ARK, VanEck, and Hashdex.\n\nBlackRock is the most notable applicant, bringing with it the scale and expertise necessary to manage more than $9.4 trillion in assets. Hashdex joined the fray in August.\n\nThe filing comes as the SEC has faced mounting pressure to approve a spot bitcoin ETF after approving futures-based bitcoin ETFs last year. Cryptocurrency proponents argue that a spot ETF would provide a safer way for mainstream investors to gain exposure to digital assets.\n\nLate Friday, the SEC announced that it was delaying its decision on two spot Bitcoin ETFs\u2014from Franklin Templeton and Global X\u2014after pushing back Hashdex earlier this week.\n\n\"Heretofore, U.S. retail investors have lacked a U.S. regulated, U.S. exchange-traded vehicle to gain exposure to [Ethereum],\" Fidelity said in its proposal. \"Meanwhile, investors in other countries... are able to use more traditional exchange-listed and traded products.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe proposed Ethereum ETF would face regulatory hurdles similar to previous attempts at bitcoin ETFs. The SEC has typically required surveillance-sharing agreements between an ETF's listing exchange and the underlying spot market for an asset. It remains unclear if the SEC views the ether futures market, which launched in 2021, as mature enough to meet that standard.\n\nFidelity, which manages over $11 trillion in customer assets, has been growing its cryptocurrency business. The firm launched institutional cryptocurrency trading and custody services in 2018. Rival asset managers including Invesco and Galaxy Digital have also filed for crypto ETFs this year.\n\nThis story was drafted with Decrypt AI from sources referenced in the text, and fact-checked by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Asset management giant BlackRock made waves this week by filing for regulatory approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). The proposed ETF, titled iShares Ethereum Trust, aims to give investors direct exposure to ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nKeypoints\n\nBlackRock has filed for a spot Ethereum ETF with the SEC, seeking to provide direct exposure to ether. This comes after it filed for a spot bitcoin ETF in June.\n\nThe Ethereum ETF will be called the iShares Ethereum Trust and listed on Nasdaq if approved. The bitcoin ETF is called iShares Bitcoin Trust.\n\nCoinbase Custody will hold the Ethereum ETF\u2019s ether, similar to BlackRock\u2019s proposed bitcoin ETF.\n\nBlackRock joining the crypto ETF race shows growing institutional interest in direct cryptocurrency exposure.\n\nThe crypto industry hopes BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF filing could improve chances of regulatory approval after a court ruled the SEC was wrong to reject a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) comes just months after BlackRock sought approval for a spot bitcoin ETF called iShares Bitcoin Trust. Both filings represent a major bet on crypto by the world\u2019s largest asset manager.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s push into crypto ETFs signals growing confidence that the SEC will finally approve such products. The regulator has long rejected spot crypto ETFs over concerns about potential fraud and manipulation, instead approving only futures-based products.\n\nBut a landmark federal court ruling in August said the SEC was wrong to reject a spot bitcoin ETF proposed by Grayscale Investments. The decision gave the industry renewed optimism that physical crypto ETFs would soon get the green light.\n\nNow all eyes are on how regulators respond to BlackRock\u2019s filings. Approval would allow mainstream investors easy access to crypto returns without direct custody challenges. It would also boost confidence in the maturing crypto asset class.\n\nBlackRock has selected Coinbase Custody to hold the proposed Ethereum ETF\u2019s ether reserves. Coinbase will also custodian the bitcoin if BlackRock\u2019s bitcoin ETF is approved. The ETFs will use CF Benchmarks\u2019 reference rates as benchmarks.\n\nThe filings pit BlackRock against rivals like Grayscale, Valkyrie and Invesco in the race for first-mover advantage in crypto ETFs. While Grayscale and others focus solely on digital assets, BlackRock\u2019s size and influence could make it a formidable competitor.\n\nThe moves expand BlackRock\u2019s growing crypto footprint. The firm began trading bitcoin futures last year and recently invested in Coinbase. CEO Larry Fink says BlackRock is studying digital currencies and the metaverse.\n\nWith over $8 trillion in assets under management, BlackRock can singlehandedly drive mainstream adoption. Its backing of crypto ETFs gives individual investors a safer route to gain exposure without direct ownership. For a cautious Wall Street firm, it\u2019s an incremental but important step into the world of digital assets."

        "content": "Fidelity Investments filed for a spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list and trade shares of the Fidelity Ethereum Fund on the Cboe BZX Exchange.\n\nFidelity and BlackRock await SEC greenlight\n\nAccording to its filing, the fund is a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) that would hold Ethereum\u2019s ether (ETH).\n\nThe ETF, if approved, will trade in compliance with the Cboe BZX Rule. Fidelity\u2019s Ether ETF push comes after BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF filing. It is believed that ETFs could make it far easier for the average person to invest money in a crypto-linked asset.\n\nSecuring approval of a spot Ethereum ETF would represent a major win for crypto investors in the U.S., as regulators in the region are yet to approve any spot crypto ETF. Fidelity Investments has reportedly expressed confidence in securing regulatory approval, as it has cited an excerpt from the ruling in the Grayscale versus SEC legal battle.\n\nIn Fidelity\u2019s filing, submitted on Nov. 17, to the SEC, they seek approval to list and trade shares of the Fidelity Ethereum Fund on the Cboe BZX Exchange.\n\nAccording to the Registration Statement, each share is set to represent a fractional undivided beneficial interest in the Trust\u2019s net assets, predominantly comprising ETH held by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust.\n\nThis move places Fidelity among seven contenders, including BlackRock, Hashdex, Grayscale, and VanEck, vying for approval for a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nFidelity has highlighted the absence of a low-risk option for US citizens to engage with ETH and digital assets, pointing to the lack of US-regulated exchange-traded vehicles.\n\nIt also draws a comparison with Europe, where investors have access to products on regulated exchanges, providing exposure to various spot crypto assets. Fidelity argues that this disparity underscores the necessity for a similar avenue for US investors.\n\nAccording to the proposal, Fidelity aims to confront issues related to fraudulent and manipulative practices.\n\nYou might also like: US SEC accepts Blackrocks Spot Bitcoin ETF application\n\nSEC rejects spot crypto ETFs\n\nIn a court ruling, the U.S. securities regulator has faced criticism for rejecting Grayscale Investments\u2019 application to establish a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nThe court ruled that the dreaded regulator had not adequately justified its denial of Grayscale\u2019s product and mandated a reconsideration of the decision. This verdict holds the potential to open the door for the first-ever product of its kind, allowing investors exposure to the digital asset without the need to acquire the currency.\n\nPost the court\u2019s favorable decision, Grayscale is pressing the SEC for swift approval of its ETF proposal. The SEC\u2019s decision not to challenge its August court defeat regarding Grayscale\u2019s application further enhances the prospects for the spot Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nGrayscale is operationally poised to convert its Bitcoin Trust into an ETF upon SEC approval. The court\u2019s final verdict is yet to be determined, creating uncertainty about the SEC\u2019s approach to Grayscale\u2019s application and other ETF filings from financial giants like BlackRock and others.\n\nExpressing skepticism, BitGo CEO Mike Belshe expressed doubts over the imminent approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US.\n\nHe attributes this skepticism to unresolved market structure issues and predicts additional rejections by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for spot Bitcoin ETFs. While there is a general belief among market experts that approval is on the horizon after Grayscale\u2019s legal victory, Belshe warns of a challenging road ahead for Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nRead more: Grayscales Spot Bitcoin ETF encounters further setback\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

She specifically praised Solana for its speed and efficiency, positioning it as superior to the Ethereum network.\n\n\u201cEther was faster and cheaper than Bitcoin in the day \u2014 that\u2019s how we got Ether. Solana is even faster and cost-effective than Ether,\u201d she stated .\n\nWood highlighted Ethereum and Solana as pivotal additions to the blockchain ecosystem, emphasizing their roles as essential infrastructure layers with the capacity for a broader range of real-world applications compared to Bitcoin.\n\nWood explained :\n\n\u201cThe reason we have focused as much on Ether is that we think, that is the smart contract network, that is the decentralised finance network. Solana is doing a really good job. I mean if you look at Ether, [it] was faster and cheaper than Bitcoin in the day.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s that\u2019s how we got Ether. Solana is even faster and cost effective than Ether.

Presently, Solana is trading at just over $66, as per data from TradingView.\n\nWood also commented on the current market anticipation surrounding several pending spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) products. She emphasized the importance of staying focused on the fundamental significance of Bitcoin as \u201cthe money revolution\u201d and cautioned against becoming overly fixated on short-term price movements.\n\n$SOL price spikes 20% as Cathie Wood lauds its speed and cost over Ethereum \ud83e\udee1 Do you think it will hit $80 by this week? \ud83d\ude80@solana #Crypto #SolanaSeason #SolanaCommunity pic.twitter.com/ZxTUb6Lux3 \u2014 Poloniex Exchange (@Poloniex) November 16, 2023\n\nAcknowledging the possibility of a \u201csell on the news\u201d scenario, Wood noted that there might be an event where investors\u2019 anticipation of an approval exceeds the market demand for the actual event. This could result in a rapid selloff in the days following the anticipated news.\n\nShe said :\n\n\u201cWe put out a Bitcoin monthly piece every month and you can see the health of the network using our on chain metrics. The health of the network is almost as good as it gets and it seems like this is a bull market. Sure we\u2019ll have puts and takes. Nothing goes straight up, but I think this flight to quality.\u201d\n\nWood added she believes that Bitcoin will outperform in the long term, but the current exposure is diversified through equities.\n\nThere is a quest to identify the company poised to develop the pivotal digital wallet. According to her, the search includes assessing candidates such as Coinbase, Square with Cash App, Robin Hood in Latin America, MercadoLibre, or New Bank."

The asset scored above 28 on the social parameter, the highest on the list, while also doing well on the environmental and governance indices.\n\nEthereum, along with Solana, Polkadot, and Binance Coin earned the perfect \u201cAA\u201d grade. This was a significant improvement from the previous rankings where only Ethereum scored the AA grade.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s green credentials not up to the mark\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, could only manage a score of 57.37. The crypto\u2019s low score of 7 on the environmental parameter significantly impacted the final score. In fact, this was the lowest rating of any of the assets surveyed.\n\nUnsurprisingly, high energy consumption continues to damage Bitcoin\u2019s green credentials. The proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism makes the network a big power guzzler, resulting in more greenhouse emissions.\n\nWhy ESG rankings matter\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of ESG factors in investment decision-making. Projects that effectively manage ESG risks and opportunities are more likely to generate sustainable returns over time.\n\nMoreover, regulatory frameworks are also integrating ESG factors into their requirements. With the regulatory climate in some jurisdictions heating up, it made perfect sense for cryptos to concentrate on improving them."

        "title": "Who is Steven Nerayoff and What Does ETHgate Recording Mean for Ethereum and Buterin? - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nFormer Ethereum advisor Steven Nerayoff has promised to expose fraud and corruption he claims took place during Ethereum\u2019s formative years.\n\nIn his latest revelation, Nerayoff has released a recording of a conversation he had with Vitalik Buterin in 2015.\n\nThe recording has sparked fresh interest in the \u201cETHgate\u201d conspiracy theory.\n\nIn recent months, the former Ethereum advisor Steven Nerayoff has promoted allegations that Ethereum received preferential treatment from regulators, fueling a conspiracy theory known as ETHgate.\n\nClaiming to have evidence of corruption that implicates Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, on Thursday, November 16, Neyaroff published a recording of a conversation the two men had in 2015. The recording is certainly interesting, but is there any substance to Nerayoff\u2019s allegations?\n\nNerayoff Releases Long-Awaited ETHgate Recording\n\nAccording to Nerayoff, the recording in question originates from a meeting he held with Buterin after he received requests to assess Ethereum\u2019s long-term viability and potential restructuring.\n\nA qualified attorney who has founded and led several digital technology startups since 1998, Nerayoff\u2019s advice to Buterin was stark: \u201cVirtually everybody needs to go,\u201d he told the Ethereum founder. The restructuring he proposed would have entailed replacing most of the project\u2019s leaders, commissioning an independent audit of accounts, and establishing a new, for-profit entity funded by venture capital investments to direct Ethereum\u2019s development.\n\nETHEREUM RESCUE & RESTRUCTURE PLAN:\n\nIn late 2014 Ethereum was in trouble. Vitalik Buterin asked Steven Nerayoff to do a full diagnostic assessment and recommendations on how to save Ethereum and restructure it for long term success. Over the early months of 2015 Steven and\u2026 pic.twitter.com/o7H0dwMhiy \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 16, 2023\n\nOver the course of more than 3 hours, he proceeded to warn Buterin that Ethereum\u2019s initial fundraising and subsequent distribution of ETH landed it on some shady legal ground. \u201cI am fairly convinced that securities laws and these other laws have been tripped,\u201d he remarked at one point.\n\nEthereum Fraud Claims Still Unsubstantiated\n\nWhile it proves he warned Buterin about potential legal trouble, the ETHgate recording isn\u2019t quite the bombshell Nerayoff promised. Previously, he implied that he had evidence of a backroom deal with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) deal that helped Ethereum skirt regulatory scrutiny.\n\nIn one post on X, he even suggested that Buterin and Joseph Lubin, another key contributor in Ethereum\u2019s early days, were responsible for fraud that is \u201c1000x bigger than SBF,\u201d an accusation he has repeated on numerous occasions.\n\nCommenting on the recorded conversation with Buterin, the former Ethereum advisor noted that it \u201cisn\u2019t directly related to the fraud but will illuminate a lot of what was really happening.\u201d He has also hinted at a potential lawsuit, suggesting another reason for playing his cards close to his chest.\n\nFor now, Nerayoff\u2019s claims remain unsubstantiated. After saying he had evidence that could prove Buterin broke the law, all he has demonstrated so far is that the two men disagreed on what Ethereum should look like.\n\nTakeaways:\n\n1) @StevenNerayoff was charged with criminal extortion in 2019 by the US Department of Justice. This is another one of his attempts to shake someone down for profit.\n\n2) @StevenNerayoff had no intention of helping Vitalik, he was setting him up from the beginning. \u2014 Christopher Bischof (@UKECB) November 17, 2023\n\nWhile his supporters view him as an important whistleblower helping to expose corruption at Ethereum and US Federal agencies, critics have questioned his motives, often pointing to his previous arrest for criminal extortion to raise doubts about his character.\n\nIlluminating Ethereum\u2019s Difficult Start\n\nAt the very least, Nerayoff\u2019s latest disclosure sheds light on a rocky period of Ethereum\u2019s development.\n\nCharles Hoskinson, who had left Ethereum by 2015 after falling out with fellow co-founders, is often mentioned in the recording. Like Nerayoff, he disagreed with Buterin\u2019s vision for Ethereum, and would ultimately go on to launch Cardano as a rival platform.\n\nAfter all this time, however, Hoskinson appears to have moved on. He tends to make light of ETHgate, but in his assessment of Nerayoff\u2019s recording, Hoskinson said it revealed an uncomfortable truth about how close Buterin and his allies came to not being able to finish what they started. \u201cBut they did, and the rest is history,\u201d he emphasized.\n\nStriking a conciliatory tone, he said \u201cit\u2019s a shame that things have been so profoundly and deeply personal for so long,\u201d while steering clear of Nerayoff\u2019s more bombastic rhetoric.\n\nSo what next for ETHgate? As someone involved with Ethereum at a high level during its early years, Steven Nerayoff\u2019s endorsement has given the conspiracy theory a degree of credibility. Yet the whole thing often feels desperate.\n\nAt worst, the focus on speculation and absence of concrete evidence distracts from other concerns, such as the identity of Ethereum\u2019s earliest backers, who could potentially still excerpt control over the network today.\n\nRather than being grounded in facts, ETHgate is mostly fueled by SEC haters and disgruntled XRP supporters, often peddling misinformation to further their agendas. That doesn\u2019t mean the rumors and charges are true. But as Hoskinson cautioned: \u201cDon\u2019t believe just because somebody wrote a book or released a transcript that you now know everything.\u201d"

The rebrand marks the beginning \u201cof a new era\u201d where blockchain technology becomes more \u201caccessible, usable and fun.\u201d\n\nThe Avara founder adds that the company\u2019s new identity is inspired by the Finnish word \u201cAvara,\u201d which carries a number of definitions, including \u201cextensive,\u201d \u201copen,\u201d \u201cspacious\u201d and \u201cinclusive.\u201d Its colloquial use means \u201cseeing more than you see.\u201d\n\nRelated: Shared Web3 user base could power new social app integrations \u2014 Aave CEO\n\nKulechov also notes that liquidity protocol Aave will continue under the same brand name through Aave Labs and continue its focus on contributing to technological innovations within the DeFi landscape.\n\nThe rebrand announcement coincides with the acquisition of Los Feliz Engineering (LFE) and its flagship self-custodial Ethereum wallet, Family Wallet. The strategic deal means that Avara\u2019s product suite now encompasses a consumer wallet allowing users to send, receive, swap and hold cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe acquisition also includes ConnectKit, a developer library built by Family Wallet to facilitate connectivity between the wallet service and decentralized applications. LFE\u2019s team, including its CEO and founder Benji Taylor, will join Avara. Taylor takes up the role of senior vice president of product and design.\n\nAvara hopes to tap into LFE\u2019s experience building the messaging application Honk to continue the development of Lens Protocol. As Cointelegraph reported, the latter aims to be a social layer for the wider Web3 ecosystem, connecting users across a decentralized social networking environment and providing developer tools to build applications and communities.\n\nMagazine: Slumdog billionaire: Incredible rags-to-riches tale of Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal"

        "content": "The largest investment firm in the world is filing for a spot market Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) months after applying for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF.\n\nIn a new filing, BlackRock \u2013 which has over $8 trillion in assets under its management \u2013 is seeking the approval of the iShares Ethereum Trust, which would grant retail investors exposure to the second-largest crypto asset by market cap through traditional stock exchanges.\n\n\u201cThe Trust seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of Ether. The Trust seeks to reflect such performance before payment of the Trust\u2019s expenses and liabilities. The Shares are intended to constitute a simple means of making an investment similar to an investment in ether rather than by acquiring, holding and trading ether directly on a peer-to-peer or other basis or via a digital asset exchange.\n\nThe Shares have been designed to remove the obstacles represented by the complexities and operational burdens involved in a direct investment in ether, while at the same time having an intrinsic value that reflects, at any given time, the investment exposure to the price of ether owned by the Trust at such time, less the Trust\u2019s expenses and liabilities.\u201d\n\nLast week, the investment giant registered an Ethereum Trust in Delaware, a move similar to the one the firm made when it initially registered its BTC trust.\n\nIn July, BlackRock filed its bid to create a spot market BTC ETF. At the time of its filing, the SEC had already rejected numerous attempts by other firms to create Bitcoin ETFs. However, the regulatory agency was known to approve futures BTC ETFs.\n\nIn August, digital assets manager Grayscale won a lawsuit against the SEC when a federal judge ruled that the regulatory body must reconsider its stance on approving Grayscale\u2019s BTC ETF to remain consistent.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "BlackRock, the world\u2019s leading asset management giant, has made a significant move by officially submitting an application for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThis ETF, the iShares Ethereum Trust, aims to closely mirror the performance of Ethereum, as indicated in the Form S-1 filing submitted to the SEC by iShares yesterday (Nov 15). It\u2019s worth noting that the iShares brand is closely associated with BlackRock\u2019s suite of ETF offerings.\n\nThe filing of Form S-1 follows BlackRock\u2019s earlier registration of the iShares Ethereum Trust entity with the Delaware Department of State Division of Corporations, an action that raised speculation. Nasdaq then filed for the proposed ETF, further confirming BlackRock\u2019s commitment to bring a spot Ether ETF to market.\n\nBlackRock has chosen Coinbase Custody Trust Company to serve as the custodian for its proposed spot Ether ETF. Additionally, the asset manager has opted for the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate from CF Benchmarks, a Kraken subsidiary, as the ETF benchmark. These selections mirror those made for BlackRock\u2019s proposed spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nIn response to this development, the price of Ethereum experienced a notable increase, surging by nearly 2% to $2,080.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s S-1 filing shows that traditional financial players remain committed to bringing ETF products to US investors. As we\u2019ve seen with the BTC ETFs, these processes take a bit of time, but all journeys start with the first steps, and these are great initial ones for Ethereum.\u201d Sergito, senior director at Fireblocks, told nft now.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s S-1 filing shows that traditional financial players remain committed to bringing ETF products to US investors. As we\u2019ve seen with the BTC ETFs, these processes take a bit of time but all journeys start with the first steps and these are great initial ones for Ethereum.\u201d Sergito, Punk and Senior Director at Fireblocks\n\nOther ETF Prospects\n\nCrypto prices have been exhibiting heightened sensitivity to developments related to ETFs, especially following recent court rulings that went against the SEC\u2019s rejection of spot cryptocurrency ETF applications. These rulings have fueled optimism in the market, raising expectations for potential approvals.\n\nEarlier this week. An incident occurred when a fake registration for an iShares ETF linked to XRP sent the cryptocurrency surging by an impressive 10%. An entity named \u201ciShares XRP Trust\u201d was registered in Delaware, with initial speculations linking it to BlackRock. However, BlackRock swiftly distanced itself from this registration, emphasizing that it had no involvement in the matter. The Delaware Department of Justice has now initiated an investigation into the situation.\n\nCurrently, the SEC is actively reviewing several applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs, including one from BlackRock. The anticipation of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval has also played a significant role in the recent rally in Bitcoin\u2019s price. Last month, BlackRock\u2019s CEO, Larry Fink, highlighted how a false news report regarding the approval of their spot ETF had triggered a surge in Bitcoin prices, underscoring the burgeoning interest in the world of cryptocurrencies."

The ETF will be structured as a grantor trust and hold Ethereum on behalf of investors. The trust will issue shares representing fractional undivided beneficial interests in its net assets, consisting primarily of Ethereum. The filing states the ETF seeks to reflect the performance of the Ethereum price before fees and expenses.\n\nThe sponsor of the proposed ETF is iShares Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC, a subsidiary of BlackRock. Key service providers named in the filing include BlackRock Fund Advisors as the trustee, Coinbase Custody Trust Company as the custodian for Ethereum holdings, and an unnamed custodian for cash holdings.\n\nBlackRock outlined several benefits of investing in the ETF compared to direct ownership of Ethereum. These include avoiding the complexities of digital asset wallets and keys, the convenience of trading through traditional brokerage accounts, and the continuous creation and redemption of ETF shares.\n\nAccording to the prospectus, the ETF\u2019s net asset value (NAV) will be calculated daily using the CME CF Ether-Dollar Reference Rate index published by CF Benchmarks. This benchmark index aggregates trading activity across major Ethereum spot exchanges between 3-4 pm ET to produce a reference rate for Ethereum. The filing also discussed how the ETF will handle network forks, airdrops, and other events that may entitle it to new assets. As reported, the sponsor has discretion over whether to claim or abandon these assets. Abandoned assets will not be reflected in the ETF\u2019s net asset value.\n\nOn expenses, BlackRock stated the ETF would have a currently undisclosed management fee and additional operating expenses. The trust will periodically sell Ethereum to cover fees, creating taxable events for shareholders.\n\nOn listing, BlackRock intends to list the ETF on Nasdaq under an unnamed ticker and will continuously issue shares to authorized participants in exchange for Ethereum deposits. The filing did not provide a planned launch date for the ETF.\n\nOverall, the prospectus provides insights into the structure and mechanics of BlackRock\u2019s proposed Ethereum ETF. As a major financial player, an Ethereum ETF from BlackRock could significantly impact institutional adoption and trading volumes if approved by the SEC. However, the regulatory environment remains uncertain, with several Bitcoin ETF applications still pending approval."

        "content": "Quick Take\n\nBitcoin transaction fees have eclipsed Ethereum\u2019s on a single-day basis, reaching a notable $11.6 million, a feat not seen since late 2020, according to Cryptofees.\n\nThis surprising surge is attributed to an increasing inscription frenzy. Comparatively, Ethereum\u2019s daily transaction fees rest at a slightly inferior $8.5 million. However, when projected onto a seven-day scope, Ethereum retains its dominance by generating an average of $9 million in transaction fees, outpacing Bitcoin\u2019s $5.5 million average, according to Cryptofees.\n\nName 1 Day Fees 7 Day Avg. Fees Bitcoin $11,630,637.52 $5,555,761.45 Ethereum $8,445,996.89 $9,090,537.34\n\nSource: Cryptofees\n\nIt is pivotal to understand that while these markers denote a slight paradigm shift in daily metrics, Ethereum still maintains an upper hand in the weekly comparison. This emerging trend warrants further observation to decipher potential long-term implications on the digital currency dynamics."

        "content": "Amidst continuous advances in the sphere of artificial intelligence (AI), including Google Bard, the technology has already demonstrated its potential in multiple industries, including offering insights into the cryptocurrency market trends and deducing trends in the price of assets like Ethereum (ETH).\n\nWith this in mind, Finbold has asked Alphabet\u2019s (NYSE: GOOGL) AI platform for an analysis of the possible price of Ethereum at the start of 2024, taking into account its current price trends and historical movements, possible spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval, and other factors.\n\nBard\u2019s estimates for Ethereum\n\nAccording to Bard, a \u201cpotential price range for Ethereum at the start of 2024 could be between $2,500 and $4,500,\u201d which suggests \u201cthe possibility of continued upward momentum driven by technical indicators, ETF approval, community support, institutional interest, and network developments.\u201d\n\nHowever, the AI chatbot also recommends caution as \u201cthe cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile and subject to external factors that could impact the price,\u201d adding that the \u201cactual price of Ethereum at the start of 2024 could be significantly higher or lower than the proposed range.\u201d\n\nFactors at play\n\nAmong the main factors involved in the future price of Ethereum, the AI tool singled out its previous price movements that \u201chave been characterized by periods of both significant growth and sharp declines,\u201d including from the all-time high (ATH) of $4,891.70 in 2021.\n\nFurthermore, Bard noted that approving a spot ETH ETF \u201cwould make it easier for institutional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum, potentially boosting demand and driving up the price,\u201d as well as highlighted \u201ca strong and active community of developers and users\u201d paving the way to \u201clong-term sustainability.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, it pointed out that:\n\n\u201cSeveral technical indicators suggest that Ethereum may be in the early stages of a bullish trend. For instance, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is showing a bullish crossover, indicating that the upward momentum may continue.\u201d\n\nFinally, the chatbot referred to a survey of cryptocurrency experts from October 2023, which \u201crevealed an average price prediction of $3,026 for Ethereum at the end of 2023 and $7,184 at the end of 2024,\u201d suggesting a general consensus among experts about Ethereum\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nAs things stand, the second-largest crypto asset by market cap is currently changing hands at the price of $1,957.28, down 4.07% on the day and dropping 6.89% across the week while still holding onto the gain of 24.13% in the last month, as per data on November 17.\n\nEthereum price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nIndeed, Bard\u2019s current predictions regarding Ethereum\u2019s price at the year\u2019s turn are rather optimistic, seeing it at 27.73% or even 129.91% higher price than at the time of publication, pushed by positive sentiment around it and in the crypto sphere in general.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum whistleblowers Steven Nerayoff and TruthLabs have alleged numerous incidents of misconduct by early Ethereum insiders, with Nerayoff currently teasing the release of apparently never-before-heard audio recordings of Vitalik Buterin.\n\nNerayoff is promising to reveal scandalous evidence that he believes proves that Buterin copied his idea of issuing utility tokens via ICOs. He is also threatening to sue over his supposed invention.\n\nOf course, fraud by third-party creators who simply used the Ethereum platform to create scam tokens or NFTs is nothing new. Many Ethereum ICO fundraisers during the 2017-2018 craze turned out to be doomed. Indeed, most ICOs have fallen to near-$0.\n\nSimilarly, most NFTs are now worthless. Ethereum insiders, however, are not responsible for those scams.\n\nWhat is new, however, is the fact that Steven Nerayoff and an unrelated researcher, TruthLabs, have both alleged misconduct by Ethereum founders and their allies and want to release the supposedly irrefutable evidence.\n\nRead more: These six-figure NFTs are down 99%\n\nSteven Nerayoff: Baffling yet impossible to ignore\n\nNerayoff makes sweeping claims that are often difficult to understand, yet he does speak with some authority. He was a former legal advisor to the Ethereum Foundation. He claims that Vitalik Buterin once lived with him in New York and worked in an office that Nerayoff rented for the benefit of Ethereum.\n\nSome observers used to dismiss most of Nerayoff\u2019s claims due to his personal credibility taking a hit when the US Department of Justice (DoJ) charged him with criminal extortion in 2019. However, a New York judge dismissed that charge in May 2023, cleaning up his reputation considerably.\n\nAlthough Nerayoff has posted his recent, Ethereum-related claims to X, he says his legal team is working on organizing all the documents involved to substantiate his new claims. Curiously, he claims to have created a non-X platform to ostensibly ensure that the information he publishes will not be censored.\n\nOn November 14, he promised to publish specific allegations against Ethereum insiders \u201cwithin 48 hours, hopefully less.\u201d There have, however, been delays, with Nerayoff claiming that logistics and the creation of NFTs were responsible for most of the hold-ups.\n\nShould be within 48 hours hopefully less. Logistics, setting up Smart NFTs, etc. \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 14, 2023\n\nDid Vitalik Buterin ask Nerayoff to rescue the Ethereum Foundation?\n\nNerayoff claims that one of his upcoming NFTs will include a 2015 recording of Vitalik Buterin asking Nerayoff for a \u201crescue plan\u201d for the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nA transcript of Nerayoff\u2019s appearance on one of Mario Nawfal\u2019s \u201cTwitter Spaces\u201d indicates that the NFT will include audio asking Nerayoff to help restructure the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nGreat thread @CoinpediaNews . The NFT isn\u2019t about fraud it\u2019s a recording of a rescue plan to save Ethereum Vitalik asked me to create in 2015. It\u2019s a rare unedited historical view into what was really happening & crucial decisions made or not made which shaped much of crypto. https://t.co/4paTF5fseI \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 14, 2023\n\nThis continues Nerayoff\u2019s pattern of claiming he created many of the standards that made Ethereum successful, including the \u2018fungible\u2019 tokens behind ICOs. The ERC-20 standard originally described the most commonly used API for Ethereum-based fungible tokens. The document doesn\u2019t list Nerayoff as a contributor unless he was going by a pseudonym.\n\nDid Vitalik invent anything? No he did not. Ethereum never scaled bc of him. Only killer app was issuing Utility Tokens on ICOs both of which I invented. Vitalik & Lubin sabotaged crypto. Their focus was merely to issue hundreds or thousands of fraudulent ICOs fleecing people. \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 14, 2023\n\nNerayoff and TruthLabs question Ethereum\u2019s The DAO\n\nTruthLabs supposedly found evidence that the Ethereum Foundation and Slock.it were behind the infamous hack of The DAO that precipitated the hard fork between Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).\n\nNothing would surprise me but seems more likely others will flip on them. Now let me see, was the DAO an inside job? Oh there are too many to even count. They have a whole industry of people who could turn on them. Frankly I refused to cooperate at all but that\u2019s me most would. \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 16, 2023\n\nRead more: Ethereum centralization is becoming a serious problem\n\nAccording to Nerayoff, the DAO hack was an inside job. Publicly, Slock.it was hit hard, and eventually sold to Blockchains.com in 2019. Blockchains.com rebranded Slock.it to BC Development Labs.\n\nSo, what did the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) say about The DAO? According to Commissioners, The DAO insiders sold DAO tokens as unregistered securities. However, the SEC declined to file charges in that particular case.\n\nNerayoff and TruthLabs also call out ex-SEC Director Bill Hinman\n\nBy now, it is no secret that former SEC chief William Hinman likely had an Ethereum-related conflict of interest while working for the SEC. Protos has previously covered Hinman\u2019s financial conflict of interest and its potential impact on the SEC v. Ripple case.\n\nBill Hinman routinely met Simpson Thacher & Bartlett employees, which received funding from a pro-Ethereum entity, including an employee who worked for its Hong Kong division. Hinman also did not divest from his financial interest in the Simpson Thacher, which had done work for the Ethereum Foundation, despite being warned to by the SEC\u2019s ethics office.\n\nAfter the Empower emails, I said a \ud83d\ude4a could prove Hinman violated the criminal financial conflict laws. You can be found violating 18 USC 208 if you allow even only an appearance of impropriety w/o being told you\u2019re violating the law. Here, he was told multiple times but did it. \u2014 John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) June 13, 2023\n\nHowever, according to Nerayoff, the corruption among government officials might go far beyond just William Hinman\u2019s opining that ETH offers were not securities transactions.\n\nA transcript of a Mario Nawfal X audio space reveals that Nerayoff believes the SEC, DoJ, and FBI fabricated charges against him. \u201cThey were looking to get as many people in this industry as possible. And that all started at the very same time,\u201d he said. He also implied that Hinman was in on the Ethereum inside job.\n\nSome individuals were skeptical. However, attorney Michael Scotto opined that Nerayoff \u201chas a case.\u201d\n\nYes @StevenNerayoff has a case. IT EXISTS. We will be releasing all his filings in the near future. As his attorney I just wish he would stop talking until then, but he is very eager to share his experience. Although I won\u2019t go into details I will say everything he has said is\u2026 https://t.co/cKQuuzgxP9 \u2014 michael scotto (@mascotto89) October 28, 2023\n\nNerayoff acknowledged that his lawyers advised him not to post about it in a lengthy X post. However, he says he cares more about holding people accountable than the money he allegedly lost.\n\nMistakes in Gary Gensler\u2019s MIT course?\n\nPrior to becoming chairman of the SEC, Gary Gensler taught a course about blockchain at MIT.\n\nTruthLabs has questioned why Gensler used this class to spread, in TruthLabs\u2019 opinion, false information about Ethereum\u2019s history. According to TruthLabs, his allegedly false teaching material included Gensler\u2019s claim that Canadian VCs mostly supported Ethereum during its pre-ICO days. Rather than Canadian money, as Protos has covered, Ethereum\u2019s extensive ties to Chinese money. If deflecting attention from China to Canada was intentional, TruthLabs posits that William Hinman might not be the only SEC official with an interest in misrepresenting Ethereum\u2019s financial ties.\n\nWhy is Gary Gensler teaching a false history on Ethereum's ICO in his MIT class?\n\n\n\nIn this \ud83e\uddf5, I will show you that it was the CCP that invested in Ethereum in its pre-ICO days, and not Canadian VC's like Gary teaches. pic.twitter.com/xfGtlux85C \u2014 TruthLabs \ud83e\udee1 (@BoringSleuth) April 19, 2023\n\nOther claims made in Gensler\u2019s lecture on Ethereum included the idea that Joseph Lubin bought 10% of the ICO. Lubin disagrees with this percentage, claiming he never owned more than half a percent of Ethereum\u2019s supply.\n\nNerayoff called Lubin out on this, citing a video in which Lubin said buying large quantities of tokens, or buying them to speculate, could become a sign that the token is a security.\n\nLubin is saying if you buy tokens in large quantities or to speculate it\u2019s a security. Gensler on video said Lubin was a VC who bought Ether in large quantities to speculate.\n\n\n\nSo, Ether is a security according to Lubin & Gensler due to Lubin\u2019s actions.\n\n\n\nWanna brag some more Joe?\u2026 https://t.co/BFLi3ZRmPv \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 12, 2023\n\nRead more: Here\u2019s why \u2018news\u2019 attacking Gary Gensler is all over crypto media\n\nRevisiting Ethereum\u2019s ties to China\n\nAnyway, TruthLabs claims that Chinese entities Wanxiang Blockchain Labs and Fenbushi Capital were involved in setting up some of Lubin\u2019s Ethereum wallets.\n\nProtos has previously covered Ethereum\u2019s extensive ties to Chinese money.\n\nTruthLabs also found evidence that Wanxiang Blockchain Labs set the Ethereum Foundation wallet up. Wanxiang\u2019s Dr. Xiao Feng went on record about its early support for Ethereum, pledging $500,000 to help launch it.\n\nGary Gensler teached to the public that Joseph Lubin bought 10% of the ICO for himself. Whats his source? Lubin claims he never even owned half a percent of Ethereums supply. So whats up with this 10%? And did he know about how Lubin called to disguise all major investors? pic.twitter.com/zpYgnOaWNP \u2014 Mr. Huber\ud83d\udd25\ud83e\udd85\ud83d\udd25 (@Leerzeit) April 19, 2023\n\nTruthLabs also notes a coincidence that Wanxiang Group and MIT announced a \u2018partnership\u2019 in March 2018. TruthLabs notes that it is possible that Chinese government-connected individuals could have used proxy or puppet entities to exert influence over Ethereum.\n\nLaura Shin\u2019s book, The Cryptopians, detailed allegations that Vitalik Buterin tolerated an out-of-place Chinese national named Ming Chan, who served as the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s executive director, for a curious span of time \u2014 even after she clashed with other foundation members.\n\nInterestingly, Chan assumed that role in 2015 \u2014 the same year that Nerayoff alleges Buterin asked him about restructuring or saving the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nEthereum also famously published its whitepaper first in two languages: English initially, and then Chinese.\n\nFinally, and somewhat off-topic, Nerayoff makes yet another assertion: Vitalik Buterin could have shorted Ethereum at some point.\n\nAwaiting evidence from Steven Nerayoff, TruthLabs\n\nIn summary, Nerayoff and TruthLabs\u2019 allegations are seemingly impossible to ignore. However, it\u2019s important to remember that they are just that: allegations.\n\nNerayoff claims to be releasing another round of evidence today or tomorrow and intends to fight for his intellectual property rights in court.\n\nEthereum initially wanted to build a decentralized digital asset ecosystem. Much of its initial marketing billed it as a \u201cworld computer\u201d that could be used for blockchain applications like smart contracts. However, since inception, Ethereum has maintained strong ties to Chinese executives with curious motivations.\n\nBoth Nerayoff and TruthLabs claim to be interested in publicizing their version of the truth about Ethereum\u2019s origins and initial motivations. Many observers have been and will continue to await their allegedly irrefutable evidence.\n\nGot a tip? Send us an email or ProtonMail.

As reported by U.Today, the SEC has also deferred Hashdex\u2019s Bitcoin ETF conversion attempt.\n\nThe race for a spot Ethereum ETF\n\nSurprisingly, there is a notable race to launch a spot Ethereum ETF. BlackRock, the top manager, has recently entered the fray by officially filing for a spot Ethereum ETF with the formidable regulator.\n\nThe product, which is aimed at mirroring the performance of Ether's price, comes after BlackRock's June filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThis development indicates that investment behemoths of the likes of BlackRock are becoming increasingly comfortable with the second-largest cryptocurrency despite its murky regulatory status.\n\nIn various instances, SEC Chair Gensler has refrained from categorically stating whether Ether is considered a security under U.S. law.\n\nFor instance, during an April congressional hearing, Gensler did not give a direct answer when questioned about Ether's status as a security. In earlier statements, Gensler had suggested that Ether might be considered a security, especially following Ethereum's transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism\n\nExpectations for SEC approval in 2024\n\nJames Seyffart, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, believes Ethereum has effectively attained the status of a commodity, although the SEC has not formally acknowledged it as such.\n\nDespite the lack of explicit recognition from Gensler and his agency, Seyffart argues that the Bitcoin rival deserves the same spotlight as the crypto king.\n\nHe, along with other industry experts, anticipates that the SEC will likely treat Ethereum more like Bitcoin and approve spot Ethereum ETFs in 2024. This upbeat prediction is based on the regulator's past actions and Ethereum's growing recognition in the financial world."

When stored on-chain this process is often costly and time-consuming for network participants, particularly validators and other node operators.\n\nFull nodes on Ethereum mainnet \u2014 and there are roughly 11,000 of them active worldwide \u2014 download all the data of each block so that network participants can verify it. This redundancy make it difficult for invalid transactions to be mistakenly executed.\n\nAlthough great for security, the consensus process hinders scalability as it is inefficient and reduces throughput.\n\nWith Plasma, all data processing and computational tasks are kept off Ethereum mainnet \u2014 only final verified states are posted to the chain \u2014 and thus less data takes up Ethereum block space.\n\nThe problem with Plasma\n\nAccording to Buterin, Plasma was not considered by the current batch of roll-up solutions for its overwhelming costs around client-side data storage and its application limits. This made it difficult to build Plasma-powered apps which did more than simple payments.\n\nIn his recent blog post, Buterin discussed a previous Plasma implementation known as Plasma Cash. This system sees each individual coin as its own non-fungible token (NFT) with a unique history.\n\nOperators on Plasma chains create new blocks in the form of a root of a Merkle tree. This means that every time there is a transaction, the owner of that transaction can be found by stepping through the tree.\n\nIf an operator chooses to misbehave by publishing an invalid or unavailable block, the owner of that transaction will have seven days to cancel by showing that they are either not the latest owner, that there is a double spend, or that there is an invalid history. This can make for a clunky process in the real-world, Buterin explained.\n\n\u201cIf you receive 0.001 ETH each from hundreds of people who are buying coffees from you, you are going to have 0.001 ETH in many places in the tree, and so actually exiting that ETH would still require submitting many separate exits, making the gas fees prohibitive,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\nDefragmentation protocols do exist, Buterin said, but they are difficult to implement in practice. Further, it is difficult to apply the Plasma design to a generalized Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) as the design requires specific owners to object to false transactions.\n\nMany DeFi protocols on-chain, for example, do not have unique or individual owners, meaning that complex applications would not be able to work on Plasma.\n\nEnter zk-SNARKS\n\nButerin noted that concerns around Plasma can be resolved with the introduction of zk-SNARKS and validity proofs.\n\nZk-SNARKS, short for \u201czero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge,\u201d enables blockchains to prove that information is accurate without revealing the contents of the information itself.\n\nSNARKS are the proof system, and validity proofs are cryptographic proofs which attest that the information is indeed accurate.\n\n\u201cThe largest challenge of making Plasma work for payments, client-side data storage, can be efficiently addressed with validity proofs. Additionally, validity proofs provide a wide array of tools that allow us to make a Plasma-like chain that runs an EVM,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\nValidity proofs will be able to prove that each Plasma block that is on the blockchain is valid \u2014 meaning that it will no longer be necessary to worry about who the last owner of each individual transaction on a Merkle tree is.\n\n\u201cIn a validity-proven Plasma chain, such withdrawals would not be subject to any challenges at all. This means that, in the normal case, withdrawals can be instant,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\nConsiderations\n\nAlthough zk-SNARKs and validity proofs can address significant problems with the previous Plasma design, Buterin reasoned, there are still limitations.\n\nThis is most clearly highlighted when a particular state object, such as a token, does not have a clear economic owner.\n\nButerin drew on the example of Uniswap liquidity provider positions: \u201cIf you traded USDC for ETH in a Uniswap position, you could try to withdraw your pre-trade USDC and your post-trade ETH. If you collude with the Plasma chain operator, the liquidity providers and other users would not have access to the post-trade state, so they would not be able to withdraw their post-trade USDC.\u201d\n\nThis shows that although Plasma potentially offers useful solutions, there may still be concerns about bad actors, which should be addressed.\n\nDespite this, Buterin believes that Plasma remains an underrated design in the blockchain technology space and could help ease Ethereum transaction fees.\n\n\u201cRollups remain the gold standard, and have security properties that cannot be matched. This is particularly true from the developer experience perspective: nothing can match the simplicity of an application developer not even having to think about ownership graphs and incentive flows within their application,\u201d Buterin said.\n\n\u201cHowever, Plasma lets us completely sidestep the data availability question, greatly reducing transaction fees. Plasma can be a significant security upgrade for chains that would otherwise be validiums.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction - Forecast for 2021, 2022, 2025 & 2030 - Forex Crunch",
        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction\n\nThe price of Ethereum has seen huge boosts over the last couple of years. Just one year ago, one Ethereum was worth less than $400. Today, Ethereum has a market value of over $2,500, even crossing the $4,000 mark only a few months ago. And the trend is that the Ethereum stock price will continue to rise on average.\n\nThis article focuses on our Ethereum price prediction. We arrived at reliable conclusions through a study of the history of Ethereum\u2019s price over the years, a fundamental analysis of its price trajectory, and a collation of expert opinions.\n\nOur Ethereum forecast looks into the future to help investors make smart investment decisions. By looking at the Ethereum price chart, we are able to determine the price of Ethereum within the coming decade.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2021\n\nBitcoin may be the godfather of cryptocurrencies, but Ethereum is that young prodigy who has high potentials of outdoing and outclassing its master. So much is the faith experts have in Ethereum that Billy Bambrough, a senior contributor on crypto and blockchain at Forbes, believes that \u201cBitcoin Could Be Left In The Dust By Ethereum In 2021\u2033\u009d.\n\nThe price of Ethereum currently sits at just over $2,400 per Ether. This is a little over half of Ethereum\u2019s highest ever price. The recent bear market saw prices crash all across the cryptocurrency market, and Ethereum was no exception. However, Ethereum has been recovering steadily over the last two weeks and prices are looking up once again.\n\nWith these points in mind, found below are our Ethereum forecasts for a variety of upcoming timeframes:\n\nOne Month \u2013 The past few days have seen Ethereum consolidate after a bullish push. Once this area has been surpassed, expect to see Ethereum head towards the $4000 level over the next month.\n\n\u2013 The past few days have seen Ethereum consolidate after a bullish push. Once this area has been surpassed, expect to see Ethereum head towards the $4000 level over the next month. Three Months \u2013 It\u2019s likely that Ethereum will head towards May\u2019s highs over the next three months, which could prove to be a solid resistance level. We predict that these levels will be broken, seeing Ethereum head towards the $4800 level.\n\n\u2013 It\u2019s likely that Ethereum will head towards May\u2019s highs over the next three months, which could prove to be a solid resistance level. We predict that these levels will be broken, seeing Ethereum head towards the $4800 level. Start of 2022 \u2013 As this will be new territory for Ethereum, the sky is really the limit for this crypto. We believe that a valuation of $5000 per coin is likely by the beginning of 2022, providing a solid base for further momentum.\n\nEthereum Price History \u2013 the Story of 2021 So Far\n\nEthereum started the year with a modest price tag of $770 on January 1, 2021. By the end of January 2021, the price of Ethereum had nearly doubled and was at $1,400. This was great for investors, and despite occasional dips, the price of Ethereum continued to rise on aggregate.\n\nSometime around the middle of February, Ethereum reached an all-time high value of nearly $2,000. One week later, it dropped to around $1,500. On April 1, Ethereum finally broke the $2,000 mark, starting the day on a price tag of $2,100.\n\nThe price of Ethereum continued to experience a steady rise for most of April. By the middle of April, Ethereum had reached another milestone. On April 1, two weeks after breaking past $2,000 for the first time, Ethereum broke past $2,500. This set a new ATH.\n\nEthereum first broke past the $3,000 threshold on May 2, 2021. This was during the last bull run that saw prices soar all across the cryptocurrency market. Ethereum went as high as $4,000 per coin during this same period and reached an all-time high of over $4,300 on May 12, 2021. The onset of the bear market brought the price of Ethereum crashing down.\n\nHowever, the market has been recovering lately, as has the price of Ethereum. This keeps us optimistic that our $3,000 Ethereum forecast is most likely to become a reality. And this is most likely going to happen before the end of August.\n\nEthereum Price Forecast\n\nTaking a look at the growth trajectory of Ethereum so far in 2021, it is not hard to see why we envision sustained increments in the price of Ethereum. The current Ethereum price is only a shadow of its price peaks, meaning Ethereum can become much more valuable with time.\n\nMany experts share this sentiment. Billy Bambrough of Forbes believes that Ethereum will someday become more valuable than Bitcoin. This might seem far-fetched to the casual observer, but many experts believe this to be a possibility.\n\nAccording to a Finder panel, Ethereum will end the year as a better investment than Bitcoin. Returns on investment in Ethereum are expected to exceed those on Bitcoin by 35% in 2021. This panel predicts the price of Ethereum to hover around $17,000 by the end of 2021.\n\nWe are inclined to agree with the panel\u2019s optimism, although our research and analysis predicts that Ethereum will be valued at around $5000 by the end of 2021. It\u2019s unlikely that Ethereum will not experience some struggles over the upcoming months, as rumours surrounding crypto regulation and taxation begin to heat up.\n\nHowever, the signs do seem to point towards some great gains for Ethereum over the next year. The uptake of Ethereum\u2019s technology over 2022 could see the coin push past the $5000 level and head higher. Furthermore, as more companies adopt smart contracts and utilise Ethereum\u2019s platform, the valuation will increase more \u2013 and our analysis leads us to believe that Ethereum could be valued at over $8000 by the end of 2022.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction Long Term Outlook\n\nWe expect Ethereum to break through the $4,000 threshold again within the next three months. A $5,000 Ether price tag is also very realistic within this period. The end of the year often sees a rise in general cryptocurrency prices and this year will be no different.\n\nEthereum remains Bitcoin\u2019s closest competitor in the cryptocurrency market. The Ethereum blockchain utility token offers value that even Bitcoin doesn\u2019t. For example, the Ethereum blockchain is an open-source platform, as opposed to the bitcoin blockchain. The implication of this is its benefit for developers.\n\nDevelopers can deploy immutable and permanent decentralised applications on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can also interact with these applications. This means applications like games and NFT marketplaces can be programmed on the Ethereum blockchain. Combine these with the fact that Ethereum also has smart contract functionality and you can see why a $5,000 price for Ethereum is well within reach in the next three months.\n\nLet us visualize further in the future and discuss Ethereum price estimates for 2022. As is to be expected, every year sees its fair share of bull and bear runs. The coming year will not be an exception. While the price of Ethereum in 2022 will see inevitable ups and downs, there will be an aggregate increase in value. We predict unprecedented growth in the value of Ethereum in 2022. There are two reasons for this.\n\nGas Fees and Blockchain Transition\n\nFirst is the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies in general. The last year has seen a surge in both the number of cryptocurrencies on the market and the value of most of these cryptocurrencies. Some cryptocurrencies have experienced double, triple, and even quadruple-digit growth in market value.\n\nThe second and more important reason for the unprecedented growth we foresee in Ethereum\u2019s market value is the coming of Ethereum 2.0. Because of the high gas fees that currently plague the Ethereum network, Ethereum\u2019s founders are working hard to release a new version of Ethereum. This version is set to be released in 2022.\n\nEthereum 2.0 will mark the transition of the Ethereum blockchain from a Proof of Work mechanism to a Proof of Stake mechanism. This means significantly lesser gas fees, more token utility, and invariably, a surge in Ethereum\u2019s market value.\n\nCombining the above points, our Ethereum price prediction 2025 puts the crypto\u2019s value at $15,000. The next four years should see Ethereum\u2019s platform rise in popularity, as the use case for this cryptocurrency is much stronger than others. If more entities adopt Ethereum, there\u2019s every reason to believe this valuation could be met.\n\nLooking further into the future, our Ethereum price prediction 2030 has Ethereum\u2019s value reaching the $50,000 mark. Numerous analysts predict even higher values than this, although we are erring on the side of caution as nobody knows the outcome of the rumoured taxation laws. What we can be sure of is that Ethereum\u2019s price looks set to showcase some serious bullish momentum over the next five to ten years \u2013 and beyond!\n\nEthereum Price Chart\n\nEthereum has experienced price swings like every other cryptocurrency in the market. However, unlike many other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has been able to guarantee investors and speculators an aggregate growth in value, and a proof of it could be if we put a context of an Ethereum 5-year forecast as well.\n\nThe chart below reflects Ethereum price live. This price chart details the movement of Ethereum\u2019s market value over the last year.\n\nEthereum price chart | Image source: CoinCodex\n\nConclusion\n\nAs you may already know, Ethereum has emerged as one of the world\u2019s most profitable cryptocurrencies. It is also arguably the most commercially successful cryptocurrency of the year so far.\n\nWith its price currently sitting at around $2500, Ethereum has managed to gain almost a 300% increase in its market value in less than 8 months. This is laudable, considering that this year brought one of crypto\u2019s worst bear markets.\n\nExperts forecast has shown a progressive increase in the price of Ethereum for the rest of the year, following its recovering pace after a bear run which saw a huge price crash across every cryptocurrency market. Ethereum\u2019s growth will be further bolstered in 2022 when Ethereum 2.0 is released. There is no denying that Ethereum can only get bigger from this point.\n\nFAQs"

        "content": "Whales are dumping large ETH holdings.\n\nThe wave of mass selling follows the SEC\u2019s recent decision to delay ETF applications.\n\nEthereum faces significant sell pressure.\n\nLast week, a wave of excitement swept through the Ethereum community as BlackRock threw its hat in the ring to launch a spot Ethereum ETF product. But this excitement appears to be waning as the U.S. SEC has delayed its decision on earlier applications.\n\nOn-chain data suggests whales are dumping their holdings in response to the blow from the SEC.\n\nEthereum Whales Throw in the Towel\n\nOn November 15, the SEC announced it would defer its decision on Ethereum ETF applications from Grayscale and Hashdex until January 1, 2024. The agency asserted it needed more time to arrive at its decision.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s history of delaying spot ETF products has meant that the announcement was met with little surprise, but some whales are getting fed up with the wait.\n\nLookonchain, a crypto smart money tracker, has reported whale selling and exchange deposits of 42.9k ETH ($82.9 million) in the past two days. The most recent instance on Friday, November 17, saw a whale send 19.3k ETH (worth approximately $37.16 million) to Binance, contributing to the mounting selling pressure.\n\nAmid the whale selling, ETH is trading at $1,942 per CoinMarketCap data at the time of writing, representing a 1.19% decline over the past 24 hours.\n\nWhat a Spot ETF Approval Means for Crypto Users\n\nSpot ETFs are considered bullish for the nascent crypto market by many in the industry.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as 24-Hour Trading Volume Surges to $24 Billion \u2013 Time to Buy the ETH Dip?\n\nEther (ETH) continues to chop either side of the $2,000 level as bullish momentum cools following the cryptocurrency\u2019s rejection of a retest of the 2023 highs in the $2,100s earlier this month.\n\nThe ETH price was last down around 3.5% on the day in the $1,980s, but still within this week\u2019s $1,930 to $2,100 ranges.\n\nAs per CoinGecko, trading volumes recently surged to as much as $24 billion in 24 hours, indicative of the fact that market activity remains elevated in wake of BlackRock\u2019s recent moves to set up its own spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nPrice Prediction \u2013 Time to Buy the Dip?\n\n\n\nWith Ether back below $2,000 and down more than 7% from its recent highs, some traders might be asking whether now is a good time to buy the dip.\n\nWell, fundamentals certainly suggest so.\n\nNot only is Ether set to continue benefitting from optimism that spot Ethereum ETFs could be coming in 2024, but macro has also been a major tailwind for the crypto market this week, with US stocks pumping and the US dollar and US yields pulling aggressively lower.\n\nThose moves in traditional assets come as macro investors ramp up bets that a US Federal Reserve cutting cycle is coming in 2024 in wake of weaker-than-expected US inflation data for October, that came on the heels of soft US jobs and manufacturing data released earlier in the month.\n\nDovish policy pivots from the Fed (i.e. a switch from rate hikes to rates cuts) have in recent years generally been very bullish for Ether and other cryptos.\n\nEther\u2019s supply also recently turned deflationary again amid an upturn in on-chain activity, meaning a higher ETH token burn rate.\n\nAs per data presented by Glassnode, the ETH deflation rate was last around 2% per year and the narrative of ETH as a deflationary cryptocurrency could soon regain ground, supporting its price.\n\nChart analysis is also suggestive a positive outlook for ETH.\n\nEarlier this month and in wake of the BlackRock ETF news, Ether surged above a downtrend that had been in play since the prior annual highs.\n\nShould the cryptocurrency retest and find support at this downtrend in the $1,900 area, this could be seen as confirmation that a new bullish trend is intact.\n\nA subsequent break above prior yearly highs in the mid-$2,100s could open the door to a swift move higher towards the $3,000s.\n\nCrypto Alternatives to Consider\n\n\n\nThe Ether (ETH) outlook is potentially very strong, but for looking for a better probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in crypto presales.\n\nThis is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.\n\nThese tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.\n\nMany of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.\n\nIf an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.\n\nThe team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.\n\nHere is a list of 15 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2023.\n\nSee the 15 Cryptocurrencies"

        "title": "Ethereum Slammed as Cardano Wannabe by Former ETH Advisor - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Former Ethereum advisor accuses the project of copying Cardano.\n\nSteven Nerayoff holds a personal grudge against Ethereum.\n\nTechnical differences exist between Plasma and Hydra scaling solutions.\n\nAs the leading smart contract layer 1 platform, Ethereum has achieved enormous success, though it continues to face security vulnerabilities and scaling limitations. In order to strengthen the network, Ethereum\u2018s developers regularly propose complex new technical improvements, such as Vitalik Buterin\u2019s recent post about off-chain Plasma technology to boost scalability.\n\nSteven Nerayoff, a former Ethereum advisor, swiftly criticized this proposal. He accused Buterin of copying rival blockchain Cardano (ADA), even labeling the decision to part ways with Charles Hoskinson during the project\u2019s early days as a \u201cmajor mistake.\u201d\n\nEthereum Gets Blasted as a Copycat\n\nIn his latest tirade against Ethereum and its founders, Nerayoff alleged that the platform is merely copying Cardano\u2019s approach to scaling. According to Nerayoff, Buterin\u2019s \u201cmajor mistake\u201d was ditching Hoskinson, who later went on to build Cardano. The irony, as Nerayoff asserts, is that Ethereum has been emulating the very person they once dismissed.\n\n\u201cAre the clueless smug @ethereum cultists who got rid of Charles happy now that the boy genius is copying Cardano?\u201d remarked Nerayoff.\n\nDoubling down on the statement, Nerayoff claimed that the crypto industry would have been better off if Hoskinson and Gavin Wood had remained at Ethereum, and it had instead been Buterin and Joseph Lubin who departed.\n\nInterestingly, this is touched upon on the recording. I suggest everyone listen & I\u2019ll expand afterwards as it\u2019s not a simple answer but you ask a very poignant question. It\u2019s not apples to apples but their recent partnership could be extremely positive for crypto.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll say this\u2026 \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 15, 2023\n\nWhile some attribute Nerayoff\u2019s outbursts to his past conflicts with Ethereum, others contend that Ethereum is indeed replicating Cardano\u2019s approach to solving the blockchain trilemma.\n\nCardano Wannabe?\n\nNerayoff is not alone in accusing Ethereum of replicating Cardano\u2019s technology. Cardano YODA pointed out that Buterin\u2019s Plasma proposal bears a resemblance to Cardano\u2019s Hydra scaling approach. Additionally, Cardano YODA drew parallels between a prior paper authored by Buterin on liquid staking, which is a concept that Cardano implemented during the Shelley era in April 2020.\n\nIn the last paper, Vitalik talked about liquid staking.\n\n\n\nNow we see a paper regarding the UTxO model and something that looks a lot like Hydra.\n\n\n\nIt seems to me that #Cardano is going in the right direction and #Ethereum is the one catching up.\n\n\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong. \u2014 Cardano YODA (@JaromirTesar) November 14, 2023\n\nIn response to Buterin\u2019s proposal for Plasma scaling, Hoskinson posted the meme of Kermit the Frog and Christian Bale nodding at one another with no further commentary.\n\nButerin\u2019s vision for Plasma relates to scaling solutions that allow data and computation to be kept off-chain, opening the door to large scalability gains not bottlenecked by on-chain data availability. Plasma works by tracking asset histories separately and relying on users to exit their assets if issues arise.\n\nSimilarly, Hydra is Cardano\u2019s layer 2 scaling solution that facilitates fast, low-cost transactions within \u201cHydra heads,\u201d or state channels which are considered secure mini ledgers, that can eventually settle back to the Cardano mainchain.\n\nNonetheless, opinion remains split based on the technical differences between sidechains, off-chain protocols, and state channels.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nNerayoff has accused Buterin and his father of conspiring to damage his reputation. This accusation stems from Nerayoff\u2019s run-in with authorities regarding extortion charges , which were later dropped.\n\nNerayoff maintains that Ethereum is a fraudulent project that has corrupt ties to federal agencies.\n\nEthereum\u2019s network effect is much greater than Cardano\u2019s with more real-world adoption and a higher number of deployed dApps.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nWhile time will ultimately reveal whether Cardano\u2019s methodical approach or Ethereum\u2019s first-mover advantage prevails, Nerayoff\u2019s persistent accusations of fraud against Ethereum refuse to fade away. In an industry notorious for deception, these claims resonate deeply, casting a shadow of uncertainty over Ethereum, especially in light of the FTX scandal.\n\nLearn more about Ethereum\u2019s scaling woes as fees surge amid crypto rally:\n\nEthereum Fees Surge to Four-Month High Following Price Rally\n\n\n\nFind out the latest on Poloniex resuming normal operations following its recent hack here:\n\nPoloniex Close to Restoring Full Operations After $125M Hack"

        "content": "A popular crypto analyst is predicting that one Ethereum (ETH) competitor is on the verge of a massive collapse.\n\nPseudonymous trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 197,900 followers on the social media platform X that Avalanche (AVAX) could decline by more than 22% from its current value.\n\n\u201cAVAX: really key level for this one in my opinion. I don\u2019t see AVAX holding it unless Bitcoin (BTC) looks better. Not saying to short, but I think this current level seems important. Expecting a bit lower personally, like $16.\u201d\n\nThe trader\u2019s chart suggests AVAX will pull back after crossing a key resistance level at $21.17 based on a historical pattern.\n\nAVAX is trading for $20.60 at time of writing, down 9.4% in the last 24 hours.\n\nNext, the trader weighs in on Dogecoin (DOGE), and he says the memecoin is on the cusp of printing a bullish price pattern.\n\n\u201cDOGE: interesting moves the last few days. I think this is a key level. We\u2019re about to see if it can make a higher high [price]. If we see that plus a higher low formed, I think we see a bullish market structure.\n\nThat said, I still don\u2019t think DOGE is as good as it was in previous cycles due to MC (market capitalization). Would probably look for other memes down the risk curve.\u201d\n\nDogecoin is trading for $0.0819 at time of writing, up 6% in the last 24 hours.\n\nLastly, the trader says that the blockchain scaling solution Polygon (MATIC) will likely retrace to a key Fibonacci level and then bounce.\n\n\u201cMATIC: decent entry coming up here at $0.75 in my opinion.\u201d\n\nPolygon is trading for $0.80 at time of writing, down 9.7% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Grayscale Investments is using its Ether (ETH) futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) application as a \u201ctrojan horse\u201d to corner the United States Securities and Exchange Commission into approving its spot Ether ETF, said Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart.\n\nSeyffart said in a Nov. 15 X (Twitter) post following the SEC delaying Grayscale\u2019s ETH futures ETF bid that he believes, if the SEC approves Grayscale\u2019s application, it would enable Grayscale to argue for the approval of its spot Ether ETF application.\n\nIf the SEC denies Grayscale\u2019s bid, the asset manager could argue the SEC is treating Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether futures ETFs differently by allowing one under the Securities Act of 1933 but not the other.\n\n\u201cWatch [the SEC] try to either approve and argue why this is different from spot. Or Deny and argue why 1933 act products are meaningfully different from 1940 act products. Both are bad for SEC [in my opinion]. Genius move.\u201d\n\nGrayscale\u2019s Ether futures ETF bid was submitted via a 19b-4 form, which is filed to inform the SEC of a security-based swap request. Seyffart said none of the 40 or so approved Ether ETF products went through the 19b-4 approval process.\n\nSeyffart was initially unsure why Grayscale filed its Ether futures ETF via a 19b-4. He now believes Grayscale is playing \u201cchess\u201d with the SEC by using the Ether futures ETF as a \u201ctrojan horse\u201d to obtain a 19b-4 order from the regulator to corner them into a lose-lose situation.\n\nI was initially unsure why they would even file for this. But my thoughts have evolved over the last few weeks and they are basically this:\n\nGrayscale is playing Chess, not checkers here. They're likely hoping to force the SEC into issuing a 19b-4 decision on an ETH futures ETF.\u2026 \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) November 15, 2023\n\nSeyffart and Scott Johnsson, general president at Van Buren Capital General, agreed Grayscale wouldn\u2019t launch the Ether futures ETF.\n\n\u201cDoubtful this product ever trades, but useful as a vessel to get spot ETH over the finish line,\u201d Johnsson said.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETFs will drive institutional adoption in 2024 \u2014 Galaxy Digital\u2019s Mike Novogratz\n\nSeyffart\u2019s comments come as the SEC delayed its decision on Grayscale\u2019s Ether futures ETF on Nov. 15 \u2014 two days earlier than its Nov. 17 deadline. Seyffart said he wasn\u2019t surprised by the delay.\n\nHashdex\u2019s application to convert its Bitcoin futures ETF into a spot product was also put on hold by the securities regulator on Nov. 15.\n\nBlackRock shared a similar sentiment to Seyffart\u2019s last week, arguing that the SEC doesn\u2019t have a legitimate reason to treat cryptocurrency spot and futures ETF applications differently.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin ETF optimist and Worldcoin skeptic Gracy Chen: Hall of Flame"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, has submitted a Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a week after registering its iShares Ethereum Trust with Delaware\u2019s Division of Corporations. The strategic move by BlackRock signals a huge step toward offering its customers exposure to the performance of the industry\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum.\n\nBlackRock Files SEC Prospectus For Spot Ether ETF\n\nTraditional finance behemoth BlackRock has filed an S-1 form with the Securities and Exchange Commission to list a spot-based Ethereum exchange-traded fund.\n\nIn the application, BlackRock says that the iShares Ethereum Trust \u201cseeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of ether\u201d, with San Francisco-based crypto exchange Coinbase serving as the custodian for the underlying ETH.\n\nThe filing comes after the $9 trillion asset manager outlined its proposal for the ETH ETF in a filing with the Nasdaq stock exchange earlier this month. BlackRock further solidified its plans to launch an ETF for Ethereum last week by registering an entity dubbed \u201ciShares Ethereum Trust\u201d in Delaware.\n\nA spot Ethereum ETF would allow retail investors to gain exposure to the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization without having to directly procure the asset. The financial instrument could potentially open the door for billions of dollars of new capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlackRock has already made waves in the crypto and TradFi worlds by aspiring to list a spot Bitcoin ETF, a move that caused frenzied bullish price action and drove BTC to its current price of around $36,900. BlackRock\u2019s CEO Larry Fink has now become an outspoken Bitcoin proponent, essentially reversing his earlier skepticism.\n\nImplications For Ether\n\nThe price of ether jumped circa 2 percent to $2,079 on the BlackRock S-1 filing news before settling at $2,030 as of publication time.\n\nBesides BlackRock, other institutional giants, including Grayscale Investments, Ark Invest, and Valkyrie, have also submitted applications for spot Ethereum ETFs. Any approval could take months as the SEC has repeatedly rejected or delayed previous applications for proposed spot Bitcoin funds but has approved a host of crypto futures ETFs.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s generally believed by crypto and ETF market pundits that the first SEC approval of a spot-based crypto ETF is just around the corner. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas predict a 90% chance of a greenlight no later than January 10, 2024.\n\nOthers have suggested that rejection of spot crypto ETFs might ignite some legal turmoil for the SEC, which in August suffered an earth-shattering court loss when it was ruled the regulator must re-review Grayscale\u2019s bid to convert its flagship Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot ETF.\n\nAn ether spot ETF would have a similar impact as a Bitcoin counterpart, appealing to sophisticated investors who previously didn\u2019t feel comfortable buying crypto. Moreover, Ethereum adds an extra layer of intrigue as a proof-of-stake (PoS) token, which suggests investors could also stake the underlying ETH for more rewards.\n\nAll of this means that potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs would push the price of ether higher as fresh money enters the market of the second-largest crypto."

        "content": "In an unexpected turn of events, Bitcoin (BTC) has recaptured the lead in daily cryptocurrency transaction fees, topping Ethereum (ETH) for the first time in three years.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Finally Dominates Ethereum in Fees\n\nRecent data indicates that the Bitcoin (BTC) daily transaction fees have surged to $11.63 million, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s $8.44 million over the same period. This reversal of fortunes marks a departure from the trend observed three years ago when Ethereum surpassed Bitcoin in transaction fees.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum\u2019s ability to support a diverse range of Decentralized Applications (DApps) made it the preferred choice for users engaging in Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and new monetary evolution that encompasses smart contracts. This versatility propelled Ethereum to the forefront, positioning it as a multifaceted platform compared to Bitcoin, which primarily served as a digital currency.\n\nRecent developments, however, have seen Bitcoin experience a remarkable surge in average transaction fees, reclaiming its status as the transaction fee leader. Starting from the beginning of November, Bitcoin\u2019s fees have escalated significantly, reaching $18.69 per transaction on Nov. 16. This surge represents a staggering nearly 1,000% increase from the fee recorded on Nov. 1.\n\nIn addition to transaction fees, Bitcoin has also made strides in the realm of NFTs. Recent reports also indicates that Bitcoin\u2019s Ordinals inscriptions are outperforming Ethereum in NFT sales, signaling a broader diversification of use cases for the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency.\n\nImplications for Bitcoin Miners\n\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s transaction fees reclaim the spotlight, the implications for miners are significant. The surge in fees provides a much-needed boost to miners\u2019 revenue streams, especially in the face of reduced block rewards. Higher transaction fees are poised to play a crucial role in offsetting the impact of the upcoming halving and ensuring the continued viability of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem.\n\nThe recent surge in Bitcoin transaction fees, although posing some inconvenience for users, is seen as a positive development by experts who recognize its role in strengthening the network\u2019s security. As the crypto market continues to evolve, the competition between Bitcoin and Ethereum remains dynamic, with each blockchain platform vying for dominance in the rapidly expanding world of DeFi and NFTs."

For comparison, Ethereum recorded only $8.44 million over the same period of time.\n\nTaking Ethereum's crown\n\nThree years ago, Ethereum surpassed Bitcoin in terms of transaction fees, a development attributed to its versatile blockchain platform, which enabled a diverse range of decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nThis versatility attracted significant user activity, particularly in the burgeoning field of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), leading to higher transaction fees on the Ethereum network.\n\nThis period of dominance positioned Ethereum as a multifaceted platform compared to Bitcoin, which primarily functions as a digital currency.\n\nGame-changer?\n\nRecently, Bitcoin has experienced a sharp increase in average transaction fees. Starting from the beginning of November, fees have escalated significantly, with the fee on Nov. 16 reaching $18.69 per transaction. This surge represents a nearly 1,000% increase from the fee recorded on Nov. 1.\n\nSome experts view this rise in transaction fees as a positive development. They argue that higher fees contribute to the sustainability of the Bitcoin network, especially in the context of diminishing block rewards for miners.\n\nThe recent increase in Bitcoin's transaction fees comes at a critical time for Bitcoin miners, who have faced one of their least profitable years.\n\nThe upcoming Bitcoin halving, scheduled for next spring, will further reduce the block subsidy from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. In this scenario, higher transaction fees could become a more significant portion of miners' revenue, potentially accounting for 20%-30% of the block reward.\n\nThis shift toward fee revenue is seen as crucial for the long-term sustainability of Bitcoin's mining and transaction verification process.\n\nIt should be noted that Bitcoin's Ordinals inscriptions are now outperforming Ethereum in NFT sales."

        "content": "EigenLayer, a player in the Ethereum re-staking arena, is gearing up to launch its mainnet\u2019s second phase in the first half of 2024. This pivotal update stands to reshape the landscape by allowing users to delegate their staked Ethereum (ETH) to operators of EigenDA.\n\nConsequently, this move will facilitate rollups, a form of secondary scaling solutions, to efficiently integrate with it. EigenLayer\u2019s initiative is to leverage staked ether and other liquid staking tokens, bolstering blockchain and data scaling services, including EigenDA.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEigenLayer\u2019s Advancements\n\nFollowing the limited utility phase that marked EigenLayer\u2019s initial foray into the Ethereum mainnet, the upcoming phase promises significant enhancements. The test network activation of this phase has already started, laying the groundwork for operator registration and the commencement of EigenDA verification.\n\nEigenDA, as the first service actively validated (AVS) on EigenLayer, is expected to reduce transaction fees for rollups. This development could greatly benefit decentralized applications, particularly in gaming and social media, where high transaction costs have been a hurdle.\n\nThe Rise of Liquid Restaked Tokens (LRT)\n\nThe landscape is further enriched by the emergence of Liquid Restaked Tokens (LRT), designed to simplify the staking process. By depositing in an LRT protocol, users can bypass the complexities of direct staking via Eigenlayer, albeit at a fee. However, this also necessitates governance to select operators and manage risks, thereby creating new governance tokens and potential airdrops.\n\nThe growth in LRT protocols, such as Ether Fi, Stader Labs, Genesis LRT, and others, heralds a new era in Ethereum staking. With LRTs, users may anticipate earning from Ethereum staking yield, Eigenlayer restaking rewards, and LRT protocol token emissions, cumulatively amounting to a potential 25% APY on ETH.\n\nRead Also: Ethe\u00adreum\u2019s New Staking Solution Aims to Improve Security and Scalability"

        "content": "BlackRock has joined the Ethereum Spot ETF race as the asset management company has officially applied to the US SEC and is currently waiting for approval.\n\nBlackRock Files For An Ethereum Spot ETF\n\nFollowing its Spot Bitcoin ETF filing, BlackRock, an American investment company has taken the proactive step by filing an Ethereum Spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe asset management company submitted the application on November 15, however, BlackRock has stated it formed the Trust as early as November 9.\n\nAccording to BlackRock, the iShares Ethereum Trust would be used to facilitate the ownership of Ether through the issuance of shares, allowing investors to own a fractional undivided beneficial interest in the net assets of the Trust.\n\n\u201cThe Trust was formed as a Delaware statutory trust on November 9, 2023. The purpose of the Trust is to own ether transferred to the Trust in exchange for Shares issued by the Trust. Each Share represents a fractional undivided beneficial interest in the net assets of the Trust. The assets of the Trust consist primarily of ether held by the Ether Custodian on behalf of the Trust,\u201d BlackRock said in its filing.\n\nPresently, the US SEC has not approved any Ethereum Spot ETF filing as well as Spot Bitcoin ETF applications. The regulatory body has delayed multiple applications to be reviewed from January 2024.\n\nThe crypto community has remained enthusiastic that the regulatory agency would eventually approve the pending ETF applications, as this could significantly push the growth and development of the crypto ecosystem as well as the cryptocurrencies involved.\n\nEthereum Price Surges\n\nThe price of Ethereum is on the rise following BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF filing. The cryptocurrency\u2019s price climbed almost 2% moving to $2,080 at some point following the announcement of the filing.\n\nThe sharp reaction has caused a stir in the cryptocurrency community, as investors gear up for a potential bull run if the US SEC gives its official authorization of Ethereum Spot ETFs.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has also been growing steadily as new companies apply for Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Currently, Bitcoin\u2019s price is trading at $36,408, while ETH is down from its initial surge and trading at $1,952.\n\nThe crypto ecosystem is presently watching closely for more updates on the US SEC\u2019s ETF filing approvals and the price changes that follow them.\n\nETH price falls to $1,945 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Bitcoin News, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

The proposed ETF, named the iShares Ethereum Trust, aims to mirror the performance of Ethereum\u2019s price, as stated in the Form S-1 filed by iShares, a division known for its ETF products under BlackRock.\n\nThis move comes shortly after BlackRock established the iShares Ethereum Trust entity in Delaware and subsequent to Nasdaq\u2019s filing for the anticipated ETF.

This decision parallels the choices made for BlackRock\u2019s proposed spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nFollowing the announcement, the value of ether saw an approximate 2% increase, reaching a high of $2,079 at the time of writing.

Discover SCENE\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) oracles network Pyth will kick off an airdrop of roughly 255 million PYTH tokens to its users and community members beginning in just four days, the network announced Thursday.\n\nOver 90,000 wallets will be eligible to claim PYTH tokens through the airdrop once it opens on November 20 at 2:00 pm UTC, according to Pyth. Users of dapps that rely on Pyth network data across 27 blockchains\u2014including Ethereum, Solana, Aptos, Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, and Optimism\u2014may be eligible for a token allocation, according to the network. Pyth Network Discord administrators and holders of Pyth NFTs are also likely to receive an allotment.\n\nThe Claim Process for the Pyth Network Retrospective Airdrop will open on Monday, Nov 20 at 2 PM UTC. Stay tuned for more details on instructions on how the Claim Process works. Additionally, the Claim Process will be available for 90 days. The Airdrop Claim Page will be active\u2026 \u2014 Pyth Network \ud83d\udd2e (@PythNetwork) November 16, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter November 20, the airdrop will remain open until February 18. DeFi users can check their potential eligibility for the airdrop, as well as the amount of PYTH they are set to receive, at the network\u2019s airdrop check page.\n\nPyth users in several countries, however, will be ineligible to participate by default, due to mitigating legal factors. Residents of the United States and the United Kingdom will not be able to claim PYTH tokens; nor will residents of North Korea, Ukraine, Cuba, Syria, Iran, Yemen, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and eight other nations and territories.\n\nPyth\u2019s native token will have an initial circulating supply of 1.5 billion, according to the network. 8.5 billion additional PYTH tokens will unlock between six and 42 months from launch.\n\nDeFi oracle networks like Pyth connect blockchains with data sources from the off-chain world, allowing DeFi smart contracts to execute based on inputs and outputs from real-world events and data. They can enable smart contracts, for example, to automatically order products when an inventory drops; to pay out agreements that hinge on the price of stocks and commodities; or to track carbon emissions and tax a company if a certain level is exceeded. Oracle networks are central to the growing integration of the crypto market and traditional financial markets, as well as the application of smart contracts to traditional businesses.\n\nAs intermediaries of information, oracle networks can also be exploited. Last fall, a hacker managed to drain $100 million from decentralized exchange Mango Markets by manipulating the oracle-reported price of the MNGO token.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPyth is the fourth-largest such oracle network by total value secured, according to DeFi Llama; Pyth\u2019s chief competitor, Chainlink, boasts over nine times the value secured, and a dominant 45% market share, compared with Pyth\u2019s 4.83%.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

While Hoskinson wanted Ethereum to be designed for commercial purposes, Buterin supported the non-profit initiative.\n\nOver seven years after Hoskinson left Ethereum, Nerayoff revealed that he informed Buterin that he made a huge mistake getting rid of the Cardano boss.\n\n\u201cAre the clueless smug @ethereum cultists who got rid of Charles happy now that the boy genius is copying Cardano?\u201d he quizzed.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nButerin Copied Ripple Smart Contract Functionality\n\nAdditionally, Nerayoff alleged that Buterin copied innovative ideas from Ripple to develop Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality.\n\nFurthermore, Nerayoff claimed that Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin also stole his idea on Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and utility tokens.\n\nPer Nerayoff, Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality and ICO were the only two things that have been successful for the crypto project. Notably, Nerayoff\u2019s allegations have continued to raise questions about Ethereum\u2019s technological underpinnings.\n\nNerayoff\u2019s latest allegation comes a few hours after he promised to provide proof concerning Lubin and Buterin\u2019s alleged fraudulent activities.

Nerayoff even accused Buterin and Lubin of intentionally promoting fraudulent initial coin offerings on Ethereum\u2019s network, severely hindering the entire cryptocurrency industry.\n\nFraud Allegations Loom\n\n\n\n\u201cTheir focus was merely to issue hundreds or thousands of fraudulent ICOs fleecing people,\u201d Nerayoff declared.\n\nHe additionally asserted that revenue from facilitating ICOs was the primary business model early on for Lubin\u2019s company ConsenSys.\n\nThe insider also disputed the viability of Buterin\u2019s original Ethereum white paper, instead crediting Gavin Wood\u2019s subsequent technical specifications for enabling Ethereum\u2019s initial growth.\n\n\u201cHis [Buterin\u2019s] white paper was unworkable.

I know this much, the Free Pass is going to cost somebody something,\u201d he said.\n\nNerayoff also pointed to the lack of lawsuits or public denials as support for his allegations\u2019 validity.\n\n\u201cIf I was clean I\u2019d simply say no,\u201d he commented about the lack of rebuttals from Buterin and others.\n\nWith his bombshell revelations looming, Nerayoff says he has been contacted by many related parties since first speaking out.\n\n\u201cI made sure this story would go public & not dependent on me by giving info for major press before I came forward. Notice not a single denial or even answers to basic questions of impropriety from anyone. Makes one question how deep & wide this goes,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe price of Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency ether has failed to break through its 2022 highs amid Nerayoff\u2019s accusations and the impending release of his purported evidence. The crypto community awaits the latest chapter in this story, as the Ethereum insider\u2019s promised expos\u00e9 draws near."

        "title": "Solana vs Ethereum: The Crypto Showdown Of The Next Bull Run - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency world is gearing up for what many anticipate to be a major bull run, and two of the most talked-about players in this potential rally are Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH). Both blockchains offer unique strengths and have amassed significant interest from the crypto community. This article will explore the current state and future potential of Solana and Ethereum as they prepare for the next big wave in the crypto market.\n\nSolana\u2019s Bull Run Prospects\n\nSolana, renowned for its high-performance capabilities and smart contract functionality, has been on a remarkable rally. The price of SOL has soared by about 44% in a week, testing the $60 mark and currently trading around $59.5.\n\nThis surge is attributed to a combination of factors, including broader market trends and increased optimism about spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Notably, Solana has been one of the top performers in the crypto market, with a nearly 50% increase in 30 days\u200b\u200b.\n\nOn-chain metrics reflect a growing interest in Solana. The number of active addresses on the Solana network has been trending higher, reaching around 270,000 on average over the past week. Additionally, Solana\u2019s TVL (Total Value Locked) has surged to over $2.1 billion, its highest level since October 2022. This indicates a significant uptick in network activity and institutional interest\u200b\u200b.\n\nFurthermore, the Open Interest funding rate for Solana futures contracts has swung into positive territory, reaching its highest level since at least May. This suggests that traders opening long positions are paying premiums,\n\nEthereum: A Titan in the Crypto Space\n\nEthereum, the largest layer-one blockchain in terms of usage and adoption, continues to be a major player in the cryptocurrency market. Recently, Ethereum\u2019s price experienced a slight dip of nearly 0.5%, holding at the $2,051 level.\n\nDespite this minor loss, Ethereum has shown remarkable resilience and growth over the past months. It remains up by 8.5% in a week and an impressive 31% in the last 30 months. This growth has been partly fueled by enthusiasm related to Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and the general momentum of the crypto market. Since the beginning of the year, Ethereum has risen by 71%, with expectations of continued strong performance if ETF approvals usher in a new bull market\u200b\u200b.\n\nLooking ahead, ongoing optimism surrounding Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs indicates that Ethereum\u2019s price is likely to continue its upward trajectory in the coming weeks. Predictions suggest that Ethereum\u2019s price could reach $2,500 by the end of the year and possibly retest its all-time high in a fully-fledged bull market by 2024\u200b\u200b.\n\nA Unique Investment Opportunity\n\nIn the dynamic landscape of cryptocurrencies, where giants like Ethereum and Solana are vying for dominance, Meme Moguls presents itself as a unique and emerging contender. As a meme-backed stock market/exchange, Meme Moguls offers a blend of entertainment and investment, making it an appealing platform for a wide range of users.\n\nIts potential for significant growth and its unique position in the crypto market makes it an interesting alternative or complement to established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Solana.\n\nVisit Meme Moguls\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "BlackRock Inc. (NYSE: BLK), the world\u2019s largest asset manager, has formally submitted an Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) application to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe ETF, named iShares Ethereum Trust, aims to \u201cgenerally reflect the performance of the price of ether,\u201d as stated in the Form S-1 filed with the SEC by iShares on Wednesday, November 15. The iShares brand is affiliated with BlackRock\u2019s suite of ETF products.\n\nThis filing follows BlackRock\u2019s registration of the iShares Ethereum Trust entity with the Delaware Department of State Division of Corporations a week prior, for which there was a dispute on social media about whether it was real or fake, which led to a brief surge in XRP\u2019s price. Shortly after Nasdaq submitted the proposed ETF, it confirmed that BlackRock is actively developing a spot ether ETF.\n\nPrevious ETF developments\n\nIn June of this year, BlackRock applied to the iShares Bitcoin (BTC) Trust, significantly influencing market dynamics. The SEC is actively reviewing various applications for spot ETFs of this crypto, including one from BlackRock. While the asset manager\u2019s BTC ETF ticker, IBTC, has been listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp\u2019s website since August, it gained notice only in the latter part of last month.\n\nMajor trading firms, including Jane Street, Virtu Financial, and Jump Trading, are reportedly engaged in discussions to offer liquidity for BlackRock\u2019s proposed spot should it receive regulatory approval. The anticipation of approval for a spot in Bitcoin ETF has contributed to a recent surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nThe company\u2019s move into Ethereum indicates a growing interest in digital assets beyond BTC. Throughout history, ETFs have consistently drawn significant investments, offering a convenient entry point and streamlining asset acquisition for institutional players instead of their holdings\u2019 self-custody."

        "content": "Fidelity Follows BlackRock, Files For Spot Ethereum ETF \u2013 Where Next for Ether (ETH)?\n\nAsset management giant Fidelity just filed a 19b-4 with the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) to set up a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) called the Fidelity Ethereum Trust, just one day after BlackRock filed to set up the iShares Ethereum Trust, its own spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nThe latest move to offer a spot Ethereum ETF to investors comes as major asset managers double down on bets that cryptocurrencies have a bright future, and that their new proposed crypto investment vehicles will gain quick approval in the US.\n\nBoth asset managers plus a dozen others filed to set up spot Bitcoin ETFs back in June, with many analysts betting that these applications will gain approval as soon as January.\n\nFidelity manages over $4.5 trillion in investor funds, whilst BlackRock manages over $8 trillion, making it the largest asset manager in the world.\n\nEther (ETH), the official name of the cryptocurrency that powers the Ethereum network (though many also wrongly refer to the cryptocurrency itself as Ethereum), was relatively unmoved by the news of Fidelity\u2019s approval.\n\nETH was last changing hands just above $1,950, having dipped over 4% this week as traders take profit in wake of the cryptocurrency\u2019s recent failure to break above its yearly highs in the $2,100s.\n\nWhere Next for Ether (ETH)?\n\n\n\nDespite its recent pullback, ETH is still up an impressive 28% versus its October lows.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has been a beneficiary of a broader market rally driven by 1) optimism about expected near-term spot Bitcoin ETFs and 2) an improvement in the macro backdrop as investors bet the Fed\u2019s tightening cycle is over, with US stock rallying and US bond yields and the dollar dumping this month.\n\nMore recently, ETH has been supported by the news that major asset managers are looking to set up their own spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nBut this news hasn\u2019t resulted in a lasting market pump.\n\nIndeed, Ether\u2019s 28% gains since mid-October look weak when compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 45% gain over the same time period.\n\nEther\u2019s continued underperformance is difficult to understand in wake of the recent improvement in on-chain activity that has turned the Ether supply deflationary once again, as shown in data presented by Glassnode.\n\nPerhaps investors are still worried about the poor demand that recently launched Ether futures ETFs attracted in the US, and assuming that this might translate into poor demand for spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nBut with the outlook for the broader market looking up and Ether chart analysis looking bullish, Ether price risks are likely strongly tilted to the upside.\n\nIf Ether can break to the north of the hugely important support-turned-resistance $2,150 area, then the door is open (technically speaking) to a quick rally back towards the next major level around $3,600.\n\nNarratives around spot ETFs, a bullish macro backdrop and Ether deflation could all offer more support to the cryptocurrency in the coming months.\n\nAnd if long-term US government bond yields fall below Ether token staking returns (currently around 4%), which is highly likely if the Fed starts cutting interest rates, Ether could get another bullish narrative (i.e. the hunt for yield)."

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price remains under the $36,500 level as the absence of momentum leaves BTC susceptible to a slump.\n\nEthereum price risks at least 5% slump to the $1,864 level if it loses critical support at $1,935.\n\nRipple price risks a 10% drop to the late October lows if the support at $0.5981 gives way.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price remains steadfast below the $36,500 level as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) misses its target. Nevertheless, a new development concerning the sane has equally not done anything for BTC, with ETF specialist Erica Balchunas saying the financial regulator wants ETFs to do cash creats.\n\nMeanwhile, both Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) are losing ground as profit taking escalates.\n\nAlso Read: SEC allegedly wants spot Bitcoin ETFs to do cash creates, not crypto, after possible meet-up with exchanges\n\nBitcoin price likely to drop\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price remains trapped under the $36,500 level as hope for a spot BTC ETF approval in 2023 wears thin. All indicators show that momentum is waning due to multiple sell-signals in play. This leaves the king of cryptocurrency susceptible to a fall.\n\nUnless sidelined investors enter the fold, Bitcoin price could lose the support offered by the ascending trendline at $35,410. The ensuing selling pressure would then likely plunge BTC to $34,000.\n\nFurther, south, the slump could see Bitcoin price extend below the $32,000 mark before a test of the bullish breaker extending from $30,126 to $31,524. A break and close below the midline of this order block at $30,824 is likely to send BTC to the forecasted $30,000 psychological level.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, increased buying pressure could see Bitcoin price confirm its move north above the supply zone extending from $36,276 to $37,301 by decisively closing above the $36,788 level. Past this level, the likely move would be to clear the $37,972 barrier before an extension to the $40,000 psychological level.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price hit $38,000 despite US financial regulator\u2019s decision to delay two BTC ETF decisions\n\nEthereum price losing $1,935 support will be detrimental to ETH holders\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is testing the critical support at $1,935, and losing this level could send the largest altcoin by trading volume to the depths of $1,864, 5% below current levels.\n\nIn a more dire case, the fall could extend toward the $1,800 psychological level with the next support level likely to present itself around the $1,753 mark.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if the $1,935 mean threshold and ultimately the order block spanning from $1,864 to $2,004 holds as a support level, Ethereum price could pull north, restoring above the ascending trendline at $2,029.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, the gains could extend to the $2,136 range high, with such a move constituting a 10% climb above current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum is a commodity, but SEC will not admit it, expert says amid ongoing ETF race\n\nRipple price extends fall with 10% pullback possibly in the cards\n\nRipple (XRP) price could fall 10% below the $0.5981 support level to test the $0.5392 support, as the remittance token continues to extend its losses after breaking out of the symmetrical triangle.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows momentum is falling as it nosedives south, mirrored by the Awesome Oscillator (AO), whose histogram bars are soaked in red and edging south. This adds credence to the bearish thesis.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flip side, a re-entry by sidelined investors and late bloomers could see Ripple price correct, pulling north and potentially restoring above the lower boundary of the triangle at $0.6603. In a highly bullish case, the gains could extrapolate past the $0.0700 psychological level, balancing out the inefficiency represented by the Fair Value Gap (FVG) at $0.7512 with the potential to hit the $0.8000 psychological level.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price fails to show parity with Ripple\u2019s important victory over SEC, 5% pullback seems likely"

The Airdrop Claim Page will be active\u2026 \u2014 Pyth Network \ud83d\udd2e (@PythNetwork) November 16, 2023\n\nMore than 90,000 wallets will be eligible to participate in the campaign.\n\nThese include users of decentralized applications (dapps) that rely on Pyth network data across 27 blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Aptos, Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, and Optimism, as well as holders of Pyth NFTs and Pyth Network Discord administrators.\n\nPyth has opened an eligibility check page where DeFi users can verify their potential eligibility and find out the amount of PYTH tokens they are set to receive.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that certain legal restrictions apply, and residents of the United States, the United Kingdom, North Korea, Ukraine, Cuba, Syria, Iran, Yemen, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and eight other nations and territories will be ineligible to participate by default.\n\nThe native token of Pyth, PYTH, will have an initial circulating supply of 1.5 billion tokens, as stated by the network.\n\nAn additional 8.5 billion PYTH tokens will be unlocked over a period of six to 42 months following the platform\u2019s launch.\n\nOracle Networks Play a Crucial Role in Connecting Blockchains\n\n\n\nDeFi oracle networks like Pyth play a crucial role in connecting blockchains with real-world data sources, enabling smart contracts to execute based on external events and data.\n\nThese networks have the potential to automate various processes, such as ordering products when inventory levels drop, executing agreements based on stock and commodity prices, and tracking carbon emissions for taxation purposes.\n\nOracle networks are vital for integrating the crypto market with traditional financial markets and implementing smart contracts in traditional businesses.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that oracle networks can also be vulnerable to exploitation.\n\nIn the past, a hacker manipulated the oracle-reported price of the MNGO token, resulting in a $100 million loss for the decentralized exchange Mango Markets.\n\nDespite this risk, Pyth has managed to establish itself as the fourth-largest oracle network in terms of total value secured, according to DeFi Llama.\n\nThe project\u2019s chief competitor is Chainlink, a leading decentralized oracle network that ensures smart contracts can access real-world data.\n\nBack in August, Bloomberg reported that a large group of team members at Jump Crypto had jumped ship to start Douro Labs, where they now help develop the Pyth network."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nBlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has taken yet another significant step into the cryptocurrency space with its recent filing for an Ethereum-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nHowever, this move has drawn criticism from prominent Bitcoin advocate and Blockstream CEO Adam Back.\n\n\n\nBack, known for being mentioned in Satoshi Nakamoto's white paper, took to social media to express his disapproval, stating the move is \"bearish\" and \"impacts credibility.\" He further likened Ethereum and other altcoins to \"scammers clawing at the gate like a horde of zombies.\"\n\nBlackRock's bold move into Ethereum\n\nEarlier today, the asset management behemoth filed an S-1 form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the iShares Ethereum Trust, aiming to launch a spot Ether ETF.\n\n\n\nThis trust, a Delaware statutory entity, will issue shares representing fractional undivided interests in its net assets, primarily composed of Ether held by a custodian.\n\n\n\n\n\nBalancing Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nThe product aims to mirror the performance of Ether's price before expenses and liabilities.BlackRock's venture into Ethereum signifies a substantial shift for the cryptocurrency that is yet to attain regulatory clarity in the U.S.\n\nLarry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has previously noted a global client interest in cryptocurrencies, a stance that has evolved significantly from his earlier skepticism.\n\n\n\nBlackRock also applied for a spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this year.\n\n\n\nAs evidenced by the recent Ethereum ETF filing, its interest in crypto is not confined to Bitcoin alone.\n\nHowever, BlackRock's recent filing to spotlight Ethereum alongside Bitcoin has stirred discontent among Bitcoin maximalists.\n\n\n\nThey view this move as a deviation from the singular focus on Bitcoin that challenges the long-held dominance of the first and largest cryptocurrency."

        "title": "Spot Ethereum ETF Styled ETHETF Token Starts Mammoth Burn Program, Price to Pump 10x? - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Spot Ethereum ETF Styled ETHETF Token Starts Mammoth Burn Program, Price to Pump 10x?\n\nThursday, November 16th, 2023 \u2013 Two days after launching, $ETHETF coin has announced a 21 million token burn program, reducing total token supply by 21%.\n\nThe price of $ETHETF jumped 25% on the news to $0.01601 and is now up 12% at $0.1448. News of the burn program comes at the same time as fund giant BlackRock officially filed its application to issue a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nIn X/Twitter and Telegram posts, the ETHETF Token team has said that the tokens will be burned over a 21-day period, starting with 1 million tokens burned today.\n\nBurning is a method whereby tokens are sent to a null address on the blockchain that only has a receive function, effectively removing from circulation tokens sent to it.\n\nBy removing 21% of the total supply it helps to boost the price of the remaining tokens. For those considering buying the token, the burn program is a strong demonstration of the team\u2019s commitment to the project and its intention to continue seeking out ways to enhance the value of the token.\n\n21% supply burn + 2% transaction buy burn = $ETHETF price pump\n\n\n\nLinked to the spot Ethereum ETF theme, $ETHETF already has a burn mechanism, whereby each buy attracts a 2% token burn. These buy burns will cease when a spot Ethereum ETF is launched. Today\u2019s news of the 21% burn program hugely buttresses the value-creating deflationary properties of the token.\n\nYesterday, in another sign of the team\u2019s commitment to the project, more than half a million dollars of liquidity was locked. This move makes trading much smoother by facilitating both smaller and larger trades. It also is something that traders will look out for when seeking reassurance that a project is not a rug pull.\n\n$ETHETF now trades on the V2 and V3 liquidity pool versions of the Uniswap decentralized exchange. V3 has locked liquidity of $572k while V2 has liquidity of $241k.\n\nThe token has a market cap of $1.35 million and 405 holders, meaning it is early days for the coin with plenty of scope for upside progress. Following the strategic move by the team, the next three weeks will be price-supportive, as, no doubt, will be the news flow.\n\nBlackRock Ethereum ETF Fever can push ETHETF Token price higher 10x or more\n\n\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Form-S1 registration filing at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) states that the fund\u2019s name will be iShares Ethereum Trust, just as its Bitcoin stablemate will be named the iShares Bitcoin Trust.\n\nWhen the largest asset manager in the financial industry comes calling, it is time to sit up and take notice for all those not already inside the crypto tent.\n\nBlackRock doesn\u2019t make applications for ETFs unless it thinks it can gain approval for them. Bloomberg analysts put the chance of a spot Bitcoin ETF being approved at 90%. If the Bitcoin variant succeeds then an Ethereum product is likely a shoo-in.\n\nThe SEC has previously failed to approve spot Bitcoin products because of the lack of surveillance in the market and the dangers of price manipulation.\n\nHowever, in a recent court ruling the judge called out the SEC for being inconsistent and wrong by approving a futures product that depends on the same underlying pricing environment while applying a higher bar to a spot product.\n\nOn the second point about surveillance, BlackRock is teaming up with Coinbase in a \u2018surveillance-sharing agreement\u2019 to explicitly address those concerns.\n\nA steady flow of corroborating nuggets of news is expected over the coming days and weeks, all of which will reinforce the value of the $ETHETF token, making 10x gains a reasonable probability for this ETH derivative coin.\n\n2% Buy Tax: An innovative feature to enhance community growth, automatically burned with each purchase \ud83d\udd25 \ud83d\ude80 After the SEC approval of the #Ethereum Spot #ETF, the buy tax will be lifted, signifying a major step towards mainstream #Crypto adoption!$ETH #CryptoCommunity #Web3 pic.twitter.com/7YhR9vH2E6 \u2014 EthereumETF_Token (@ETHETFToken) November 16, 2023\n\nFOMO will grow as spot Ethereum ETF news flow hots up\n\n\n\nAll those looking for a way to play the spot Ethereum ETF theme are highly likely to come across ETHETF Token while conducting their due diligence research.\n\nChoosing to introduce the supplementary burn program at this time is a masterstroke. There is nothing like rising prices to encourage more buyers and further rises in price. Market participants watching this price action will be likely to succumb to FOMO.\n\nFor traders and investors hunting for a way to leverage the spot Ethereum ETF frenzy, $ETHETF presents a solid way to get ahead of the crowd. It is the perfect way to \u2018buy the rumor\u2019. And because $ETHETF buyers are getting in early, well before the ETF itself is launched, they are protected against any temporary \u2018sell the news\u2019 sell-off.\n\nEthereum is the most-used blockchain for running applications based on smart contracts and as such is the base layer of Web3 decentralized applications. There are many other blockchain ecosystems vying to be Ethereum-killers, but none comes close to Ethereum.\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to wait for the approval by the SEC and the subsequent launch of a spot Ethereum ETF, because $ETHETF is already trading on decentralized exchanges, enabling smart traders to get exposure to the Ethereum ETF investment theme immediately.\n\nTo purchase the ETHETF Token, connect a crypto wallet to Uniswap, copy and paste in the contract address to make sure you are buying the correct coin, and then make your purchase. Be sure to have at least $20 spare in your wallet to pay the transaction gas fee. You can also buy the token using the Uniswap widget available on the ETHETF Token website.\n\nBuy $ETHETF todayDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction As Double-Top Pattern Threatens ETH Rally, How To Stay Profitable - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) climbed above $2,000 and tested resistance at $2,130 for the first since April last week amid renewed euphoria around the filing of the first Ether spot exchange-traded fund by global leading asset manager BlackRock.\n\nInvestors are also looking forward to the potential approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) later this week, which could also be bullish for Ethereum and other altcoins.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, the approval of the spot ETFs is not guaranteed since the SEC can decide to postpone its decision.\n\nNevertheless, investors turned their attention back to Ethereum price the moment news broke that BlackRock had made the first step toward applying for a spot ETH ETF.\n\nCan Ethereum Price Uphold Support Above $2,000\n\nEther is trading at $2,010 at the time of writing on Wednesday during US business hours. Holding support above $2,000 seems critical for the continuation of the uptrend, especially with bulls having lost the support briefly after the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data was released on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, with inflation easing in the country, investors are expected to gain confidence in risk assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Moreover, geopolitical tensions occasioned by the Israel-Hamas war may continue to drive investors to crypto with ETH and BTC being the biggest contenders.\n\nMeanwhile, support above $2,000 would mean that Ethereum has the momentum to keep the uptrend intact. It could also help support the bullish outlook from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator.\n\nIf Ethereum slides below $2,000, it could create instability and possibly lead to a sell-off as traders may want to protect their wallets to avoid liquidations. Investors who bought after the breakout above the seller congestion at $1,900 may want to sell, thus increasing the overhead pressure.\n\nThe presence of a double-top pattern around $2,130 could further complicate the technical situation for the bulls. Another rejection may lead to a spike in selling pressure.\n\nFor that reason, market participants are likely to be concerned about Ethereum\u2019s decline below $2,000 which might trigger a sell-off to $1,900 and the local support at $1,800.\n\nTraders interested in shorting ETH may want to ensure that the blue MACD line crosses below the red signal line. The momentum indicator will have to persistently drop toward the neutral area to affirm the new bearish thesis.\n\nHowever, there is a very narrow chance that declines will intensify, especially with Ethereum forming double bullish crosses on the daily chart. The first pattern occurred with the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (red) moving above the 100-day EMA (blue) followed by the second cross where the same 50-day EMA flipped above the 200-day EMA (purple).\n\nCombined, these bull market indicators affirm the bullish outlook in the market, propping Ethereum price rally towards $3,000.\n\nEthereum Network Fees Hit 4-Month Highs\n\nAccording to blockchain data company Santiment, the Ethereum network fees have in the recent past increased to their highest level in four months. This increase also coincided with the token\u2019s climb above $2,000 suggesting that investors were transacting more on-chain.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 #Ethereum's fees have unsurprisingly risen as $ETH rose back above $2K last week & network utility surged. Relatively, though, transactions are still cheap compared to $14 May average fee levels we saw. Watch how other ERC-20's are impacted, as well. https://t.co/yuzXALw53z pic.twitter.com/ndw1PYeVEF \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 14, 2023\n\nThere is always a positive correlation between Ethereum price and the transaction fees. As the price of Ether rallies, investors tend to move more of the token on-chain, which contributes to the volatility and the subsequent uptrend.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "BlackRock taps Coinbase custodian for its Ethereum ETF\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, has officially filed a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on Ethereum.\n\nThe proposed ETF, named \u201ciShares Ethereum Trust,\u201d aims to provide investors with exposure to Ethereum\u2019s price movements through traditional stock exchange channels.\n\nThe filing, made with the Nasdaq stock exchange, outlines BlackRock\u2019s intention to create an ETF that reflects the performance of the price of ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain. The ETF would hold ether as its underlying asset, and Coinbase Global is designated as the custodian for the fund\u2019s ether holdings.\n\nThis move follows BlackRock\u2019s registration of the iShares Ethereum Trust entity with the Delaware Department of State Division of Corporations a week ago. The recent filing with the SEC provides more details about the proposed ETF, including the selection of Coinbase Custody Trust Company as the custodian and the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate as the benchmark.\n\nThe iShares Ethereum Trust filing comes in the wake of BlackRock\u2019s previous filing for the iShares Bitcoin Trust in June of this year. The SEC is currently reviewing multiple spot bitcoin ETF applications, and BlackRock\u2019s bitcoin ETF filing, known by the ticker IBTC, is awaiting approval.\n\nThe announcement had a muted impact on the price of ether, which experienced a modest increase of nearly 2% to around $2,080 following the news. BlackRock\u2019s interest in offering both bitcoin and ethereum ETFs reflects the growing demand for cryptocurrency investment products from institutional investors.\n\nIf approved, the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF would provide retail investors with a regulated way to gain exposure to Ethereum\u2019s price without directly holding the cryptocurrency. While the filing provides detailed information about the ETF\u2019s structure, the regulatory agency\u2019s decision is awaited amid previous rejections of spot Bitcoin ETF proposals.\n\nEarlier in October, Grayscale Investments, in partnership with NYSE Arca, also submitted its own application to the SEC seeking approval to transform the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nThe Grayscale Ethereum Trust currently stands as the world\u2019s largest ether investment product, managing almost $5 billion in assets. When launching a new crypto ETF, regulatory authorization is typically sought from the exchange that lists the ETF\u2019s shares, rather than the sponsor itself."

        "content": "A new meme coin prepares to join the race, but can it hang with the big boys?\n\nGameStop Memes: A Challenger for Bitcoin and Ethereum?\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of digital currency, where Bitcoin and Ethereum have reigned supreme for years, a new player has emerged on the scene - GameStop Memes Coin. The rise of GameStop Memes Coin has caught the attention of the crypto world, and it's making waves with its unique approach and, most notably, its association with the popular meme culture. In this article, we delve deep into the world of GameStop Memes Coin, its origins, potential, and whether it can truly challenge the giants - Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThe Genesis of GameStop Memes Coin\n\nGameStop Memes Coin, often referred to as \"GMS\" in the crypto community, has a fascinating story. It all started as a meme, much like the popular Dogecoin, which was created based on the Shiba Inu meme. The internet, known for its quirky sense of humor, loves to adopt these digital currencies, turning them into a form of satire. GameStop Memes Coin, with its roots in the GameStop stock market frenzy and meme culture, quickly garnered a cult following.\n\nA New Breed of Cryptocurrency\n\nGameStop Memes Coin is not your typical cryptocurrency. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which rely on blockchain technology for security and transactions, GMC takes a different approach. It operates on a blockchain, but its primary function is to serve as a satirical token, poking fun at the serious nature of traditional cryptocurrencies.\n\nGameStop Memes Coin vs. Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nMarket Capitalization\n\nOne of the key metrics to consider when comparing these cryptocurrencies is market capitalization. As of the latest data available, Bitcoin stands as the kingpin with a market cap exceeding $1 trillion. Ethereum is no slouch either, with a market cap of over $300 billion. GameStop Memes Coin, on the other hand, lags significantly behind, with a relatively modest market cap.\n\nPopularity and Community\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have established themselves as cryptocurrencies with strong and dedicated communities. They are recognized worldwide, with countless businesses and individuals accepting them as a means of payment. GameStop Memes Coin, while gaining popularity within meme culture, is yet to make a significant impact in mainstream transactions.\n\nUtility and Functionality\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum serve as decentralized digital currencies that enable secure peer-to-peer transactions and, in the case of Ethereum, smart contracts. Their utility in the real world is undeniable. GameStop Memes Coin, however, does not aim to be a serious player in the crypto world. Its primary purpose is satire, making it less practical for mainstream use.\n\nThe Power of Memes\n\nGameStop Memes Coin's strength lies in its association with internet memes. Memes have a unique way of spreading like wildfire across social media and online platforms. The power of memes can drive interest and curiosity in GameStop Memes Coin, even among those who are not actively involved in the crypto market.\n\nThe Uncertain Future\n\nWhile GameStop Memes Coin offers a breath of fresh air and humor in the world of cryptocurrencies, its long-term viability remains uncertain. The crypto market is highly volatile, and trends can change rapidly. Bitcoin and Ethereum have established themselves as reliable and secure assets over the years, which provides them with a level of stability that GameStop Memes Coin may struggle to match.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIn conclusion, GameStop Memes Coin has certainly made a splash in the crypto world, thanks to its association with internet memes and the GameStop stock market saga. However, it's important to remember that GameStop Memes Coin is more of a meme in itself, created for humor and satire rather than serious financial transactions. While it's entertaining and intriguing, it is unlikely to challenge the dominance of Bitcoin and Ethereum in the foreseeable future.\n\nFind Out More about GameStop Memes:\n\nWebsite: https://gamestmemes.com\n\nX (Twitter): https://twitter.com/GameStopMemes\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/GameStopMemes"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAn NFT painting of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin dressed as a jester has sold for 200 ETH, equivalent to $392,308 at the time of sale, on the secondary market\u2014injecting another glimmer of hope into the long-sluggish NFT ecosystem.\n\nThe digital painting, a one-of-one NFT titled \u201cEthBoy\u201d made by the crypto artists Trevor Jones and the late, pseudonymous Alotta Money, broke records when it first sold at auction in November 2020 for a whopping 260 ETH, making it at the time the most expensive NFT artwork ever sold. Based on fluctuations in the price of ETH over the intervening years, though, the value of that sale\u2014about $140,000 at the time\u2014pales in comparison to that of this week\u2019s resale.\n\nWhen \"EthBoy\" was first minted, it entered an NFT ecosystem very different to today\u2019s. Crypto art and PFP NFTs consistently broke sale records on their ascent to the eventual crescendo of the 2021 NFT bull run.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCritically, also, the novel medium was so eagerly embraced by traditional artists like Jones (a painter by trade), due to its prioritization of creator royalties\u2014fees, typically between 2.5% and 10%, that were then mandatorily tacked on to any secondary sales of an NFT, and given to the piece\u2019s creator.\n\nGm! Ethboy just sold on secondary for 200 ETH! \ud83e\udd2f pic.twitter.com/QpqoBu2RTM \u2014 Trevor Jones \ud83c\udfa8 (@trevorjonesart) November 16, 2023\n\nIn the last year, creator fees have become the focal point of an escalating crisis in the struggling NFT ecosystem. Once considered a key incentive for artists enforced by all major NFT marketplaces, the fees have now become optional at major platforms like OpenSea, which have struggled mightily to attract customers and keep revenue steady amidst the current bear market.\n\nThough \"EthBoy\" was sold this week via the OpenSea marketplace, it does appear that the NFT\u2019s new owner opted\u2014of their own accord\u2014to pay the work\u2019s creator fee, despite not being obligated to do so. The 10% creator royalty of 20 ETH, automatically paid to Async Art, the platform that coordinated the piece\u2019s creation, constituted what\u2019s essentially a $39,230 tip.\n\nWhen \"EthBoy\" was first minted, its creators\u2014then intent on demonstrating the unique selling points of on-chain art sales\u2014committed to sharing one third of creator fees generated by the artwork\u2019s future sales with the piece\u2019s first buyer, in perpetuity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat first owner, the pseudonymous MaxStealth, has held on to \"EthBoy\" since 2020. In addition to the base revenue they collected yesterday from the work\u2019s sale, they should thus also soon be receiving just over $13,000 worth of ETH as their portion of the creator fee. It\u2019s an enticing, but potentially soon to be outdated, taste of the NFT art market\u2019s economic potential.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

Discover SCENE\n\nCathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, has recently been vocal about Solana, which has been recently experiencing a huge price rally.\n\nIn her comments earlier this week, Wood praised the blockchain protocol for its efficiency and cost-effectiveness, especially when compared to Ethereum.\n\n\"Solana is doing a really good job. If you look at Ethereum it was faster and cheaper than Bitcoin in the day. Solana is faster and more cost-effective than Ethereum\", she said during an interview with CNBC\u2019s \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSolana saw a 15% increase on the day following her comments, with the price of Solana's SOL token extending its monthly rise to nearly 200% and eyes on the $100 target. Since she made her comments on Tuesday, SOL has gained another $10 and was trading at $62 as of this writing, according to CoinGecko.\n\nWood's sentiments this week echo her past comments because it's not the first time she's praised Solana.\n\nOn November 1, in another CNBC interview, Wood highlighted Solana's efficiency and indicated its potential to outpace Ethereum in terms of both speed and cost-effectiveness.\n\nCathie Wood has long been a fan of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market\u2014but has often voiced her frustration at the U.S. regulatory environment.\n\nShe has critiqued the SEC for its delay in approving a Bitcoin ETF, suggesting that the political ambitions of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler could influence the hesitation. She's also defended Bitcoin's decentralized and transparent nature against concerns over market manipulation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDespite regulatory hurdles, she remains optimistic about the future of cryptocurrencies, projecting that the market could grow to $25 trillion by 2030, with institutional adoption driving this growth.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This article was written with the assistance of AI.

        "content": "Discover crypto outlook of GameStop Memes, TRON, and Cardano. Explore meme-driven gains, versatile dApps, and academic research. Navigate Ethereum price fluctuations.\n\nEthereum Price Impact: GameStop Memes, TRON, and Cardano's Crypto Clash\n\nThe explosive growth of the crypto market has led to the emergence of numerous blockchain projects, each offering unique features and innovations. In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, investors and enthusiasts are constantly seeking the next big thing. The intriguing dynamics between three prominent players in the industry: GameStop Memes, TRON, and Cardano stay debatable with \u0650Ethereum price, which serves as the linchpin connecting these entities, intriguing both crypto investors and news followers.\n\nGameStop Memes: A New Player in the Crypto Arena\n\nGameStop Memes, a curious name in the crypto space, has recently caught the attention of investors and traders. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, GameStop Memes operates on a unique premise. It leverages the power of meme culture, tapping into social media-driven investments.\n\nGameStop Memes is essentially a community-driven cryptocurrency project that utilizes meme content to drive interest and investment. It encourages crypto enthusiasts to engage in \"presale\" events. These presales involve early investors acquiring tokens before they are officially listed on exchanges; potentially leading to significant gains as the Ethereum price fluctuates.\n\nTRON: The Versatile Blockchain Platform\n\nTRON is a blockchain platform that allows developers to create decentralized applications on its network. It aims to provide an alternative to traditional web services by offering a decentralized, user-centric environment. This versatile platform has made its mark, standing as a robust competitor in the crypto arena.\n\nTRON has been a significant player in the blockchain industry for some time now. It differentiates itself by offering a versatile platform that can host a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps). Understanding its role in the crypto world becomes crucial when exploring the Ethereum price's impact on this platform. Its utilization, however, is less reliant on the Ethereum price and more on the adoption of its platform.\n\nCardano: The Academic Blockchain\n\nCardano is a blockchain platform designed to provide a secure and scalable infrastructure for the development of smart contracts and decentralized applications. It has gained recognition for its academic approach to blockchain technology, focusing on rigorous research and development.\n\nInvesting in Cardano is a more calculated and research-driven endeavor. While Ethereum price fluctuations may influence overall market sentiment, Cardano's success is closely tied to the academic rigor and technological advancements it represents.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, GameStop Memes, TRON, and Cardano each bring a unique perspective to the table. GameStop Memes leverages meme culture and Ethereum price volatility to make its mark, while TRON provides a versatile platform for dApp development. Cardano, on the other hand, emphasizes academic research and development.\n\nUltimately, the choice between these entities depends on your investment goals and risk tolerance. While GameStop Memes may offer quick, meme-driven gains. For those seeking opportunities within the crypto space, GameStop Memes offers a unique avenue. Given the constant fluctuations in Ethereum price, engaging in presale events might prove fruitful for early adopters.\n\nFind Out More About GameStop memes:\n\nWebsite: https://gamestmemes.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GameStopMemes\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/GameStopMemes"

        "content": "In a significant move echoing the recent Bitcoin ETF momentum, BlackRock, the world\u2019s leading asset manager, has officially sought approval for an Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).\n\nThis development could mark the inception of the first-ever Ethereum ETF in the United States, opening avenues for investors to engage with Ethereum\u2019s market without direct cryptocurrency ownership.\n\nThe ETF, if approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), would precisely track Ethereum\u2019s spot price, offering investors a direct stake in Ethereum\u2019s value rather than in companies associated with the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nIn response to this news, the price of Ethereum (ETH) experienced a rapid surge, reaching its highest point this year at around $2,133, reminiscent of the Bitcoin rally following BlackRock\u2019s filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF in June.\n\nLet\u2019s dig a bit deeper\u2026\n\n>>> Buy The Best Coin Now<<<\n\nThere Are No Guarantees About ETH ETF Approval & 5 Promising Tokens to Invest In\n\nWhile anticipation surrounds the Ethereum ETF filing, certainty remains elusive. In stark contrast to the optimistic expectations for Bitcoin spot ETFs\u2019 approval by Q1 2024, the fate of spot-based Ethereum ETFs is less assured.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst James Seffart places a 90% likelihood on Bitcoin ETF approval by January 10, 2024, signalling a positive trend.\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s regulatory standing introduces complexity. The SEC\u2019s 240-day evaluation period pushes any potential Ethereum ETF release to late 2024, and the ambiguous categorization of ETH as a potential security adds an additional layer of uncertainty.\n\nAs the industry advocates for clearer regulatory guidelines, understanding Ethereum\u2019s SEC status becomes a pivotal determinant in shaping the ETF landscape.\n\n>>> Buy The Best Coin Now<<<\n\nBitcoin ETF (BTCETF) \u2013 Milestone Crusher \u2013 $740,000 In Less Than 10 Days!\n\nHave you explored the latest entrant into the crypto \u2013 Bitcoin ETF Token? Positioned as one of the most promising projects, BTCETF strategically aligns with Bitcoin\u2019s price fluctuations and the anticipated SEC approval of a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe project\u2019s roadmap links its trajectory to Bitcoin\u2019s potential surge and the market-shifting impact of an ETF approval.\n\nEven in the face of Bitcoin\u2019s decline, gains from BTCETF remain probable, with industry experts projecting a substantial Bitcoin valuation of $135,000 by 2025.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin ETF Now<<<\n\nFurthermore, the imminent prospect of an ETF approval signals a potential influx of billions or trillions into the market, offering BTCETF exponential growth possibilities.\n\nWith projections foreseeing remarkable gains, coupled with passive income opportunities through staking and a deflationary mechanism ensuring price stability, Bitcoin ETF Token emerges as a compelling investment choice.\n\nSeize the moment as BTCETF navigates through its presale stages, having already raised over $740k, and stay ahead of the impending price surge.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin ETF Now<<<\n\nBitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) \u2013 Mining Will Become Accessible to Everyone\n\nEnter the realm of decentralized Bitcoin mining with Bitcoin Minetrix. Currently navigating a successful presale that has amassed an impressive $3.8 million in just over a month, the project stands as a testament to its innovative use case and robust community interest.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix seeks to democratize Bitcoin mining, historically an exclusive domain requiring expensive hardware and technical expertise.\n\nUnlike its predecessors, the platform\u2019s cloud mining solution opens the doors to mass adoption. Users simply need an Ethereum-compatible wallet and $BTCMTX tokens to embark on their mining journey, exchanging tokens for Bitcoin mining credits and subsequently earning free Bitcoin.\n\nEarly birds can secure their stake at the current discounted presale rate of $0.0116, but that price is already set to increase in the next 48 hours as the token moves to the next stage.\n\nSeize the opportunity for a pioneering entry into decentralized Bitcoin mining with Bitcoin Minetrix.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin Minetrix Now<<<\n\nMeme Kombat ($MK) \u2013 Raked In $1.7 Million in Funding\n\nUnleash the power of memes with Meme Kombat, the latest entrant in the thriving meme coin arena, poised to secure Tier-1 cryptocurrency exchange listings.\n\nUnlike its counterparts, Meme Kombat ventures beyond mere hype, amalgamating three booming industries\u2014crypto, gaming, and gambling.\n\nEngage in thrilling battles featuring favorites like Pepe and Shiba Inu, with AI determining unpredictable and unbiased outcomes.\n\nThe platform, exclusively built on the Ethereum blockchain, introduces a dynamic gaming experience centered around iconic meme characters.\n\nParticipants stand to earn native $MK tokens through victories, challenges, and strategic betting on other players\u2019 battles.\n\nExcitingly, Meme Kombat offers a presale staking option, boasting an impressive APY of over 720%.

Details surrounding the nature of the revelation remain shrouded in mystery, however, the insider has promised to release several evidential documents and a possibly damning recording between him and the Ethereum Founder.\n\nCountdown To Nerayoff\u2019s Big Reveal\n\nFormer Ethereum Advisor, Steven Nerayoff announced previously that he would be releasing evidence of fraud accusations he made against ETH Founders, Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin. He committed to disclosing this information today, November 16, and urged the crypto community to prepare for its release.\n\nThe former Ethereum Advisor also stated that he would be publishing recordings of him and Buterin having a conversation about the Ethereum Network. He highlighted that the recording was not connected to his accusations of fraud but it would show his involvement with the ETH founder.\n\n\u201cThe recording isn\u2019t directly related to the fraud but will illuminate a lot of what was happening & show my involvement. The fraud will be in the lawsuit,\u201d Nerayoff stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post.\n\nHe added that \u201cthis recording won\u2019t necessarily affect anything other than the supposed genius, truthfulness, and selflessness of Vitalik & Lubin.\u201d\n\nThe Ethereum insider revealed that he was exposing himself to certain risks by revealing alleged truths about Ethereum. He emphasized his confidence and disregard for the possible repercussions of his decision. Nerayoff also declared that he would go through with his determination to unveil proof of his accusations against Buterin and Lubin.\n\n\u201cHow does one refute the truth backed up with documentation? And I know the risks I\u2019m taking & don\u2019t care. Might be hard for many to understand but after what they put me through for years it\u2019s as if I died & came back to life.

However, the two Ethereum founders have stayed silent, refraining from denying or confirming the allegations.\n\nNerayoff has called out the founders\u2019 silence, asserting that their quiet disposition was because of the evidence he had against them. The Ethereum insider claims to hold several potentially damning receipts, which he has promised to make public soon.\n\n\u201cVitalik & Lubin are vicious if they have leverage.

        "content": "Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Helius Labs, a prominent player in the SOL ecosystem, recently shared his thoughts on the ongoing comparison between Ethereum and Solana, two leading Layer 1 (L1) blockchains. Through a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter), Mumtaz outlined several performance aspects where Solana has shown superiority.\n\nSolana Vs. Ethereum\n\nMumtaz starts out by explaining; \u201cSpot the asymmetry: Solana has exceeded 700 user TPS regularly in the past week \u2014 Ethereum does 12 TPS. That\u2019s a 60x difference.\u201d He further emphasized the significant disparity in transaction finality speeds, with SOL achieving approximately 400 milliseconds compared to Ethereum\u2019s roughly 15 minutes. This represents a 2,250x difference.\n\nMoreover, he pointed out the stark contrast in average transaction fees, where Solana averages $0.00025, substantially lower than Ethereum\u2019s range of $1.5 to $20. Regarding network size, Mumtaz mentioned, \u201cSolana has ~3k nodes \u2014 Ethereum has around 8k nodes. That\u2019s a 2.6x difference.\u201d\n\nMumtaz acknowledged Ethereum\u2019s higher level of decentralization but questioned the practical impact of this difference beyond a certain threshold. He also remarked on the importance of balancing decentralization with performance and accessibility, suggesting that extreme skewing towards one aspect might not be ideal.\n\n\u201cThis is not a dunk on Eth [\u2026] Both Ethereum and Solana are decentralized. Ethereum is more decentralized, yes, but how much of a difference does that make past a certain threshold? At the end of the day, you need to be able to build cheap, fast, scalable apps,\u201d Mumtaz elaborated.\n\nMumtaz also speculated on the future of crypto activity, suggesting that even in an optimistic scenario, a combination of SOL with L2s might be the ideal solution: \u201cSo if you assume an overly optimistic future for crypto activity such that it pushes beyond the limits of a single L1 with Moore\u2019s law or all L2s combined, then the ideal solution would still approximate something like Solana + L2s.\u201d\n\nJoe McCann, CEO and CIO of Asymmetric, further contributed to the discussion by highlighting data from Galaxy Digital that emphasizes Solana\u2019s growing prominence in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. McCann pointed out, \u201cThe number of Solana DeFi users interacting with 10+ smart contracts (programs) daily is at a year-to-date high, representing 1.15% of all active DeFi addresses.\u201d\n\nThis statistic places SOL significantly ahead of Ethereum and other Layer 1 solutions in terms of daily active DeFi interactions. He noted that this represents an 11.5x increase over Ethereum and even greater multiples over other competitors: 6.88x more than Optimism, 16.4x more than Arbitrium and Avalanche, and more than 23x more than Polygon.\n\nCathie Wood Acknowledges SOL\n\nIn a recent interview with CNBC Squawk Box, prominent investor Cathie Wood discussed the evolving landscape of blockchain infrastructure. While acknowledging Ethereum\u2019s status as the leading smart contract and decentralized finance network, Wood also recognized SOL\u2019s growing significance.\n\nRelated Reading: FTX Bankruptcy Is Now One-Year Old \u2013 How Has Solana (SOL) Fared Since Then?\n\nWood explained, \u201cSolana is doing a really good job. I mean, if you look at Ether, it was faster and cheaper than Bitcoin back in the day. That is how we got Ether. Solana is even faster and cost-effective than Ether.\u201d\n\nShe emphasized the importance of infrastructure plays in the blockchain space, hinting at SOL\u2019s potential role in the development of Web3 and digital assets, including the implementation of online property rights.\n\nHer comments reflect a broader industry perspective that, while Ethereum currently holds a dominant position, Solana is gaining traction due to their enhanced performance characteristics and cost efficiency.\n\nAt press time, SOL traded at $64.30.\n\nFeatured image from WoolyPooly, chart from TradingView.com"
