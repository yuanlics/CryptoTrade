        "title": "So your layer-2 is 'secured by Ethereum' \u2014 what does that mean? - Blockworks",
        "content": "The chief selling point of layer-2 blockchains built atop Ethereum \u2014 aside from increased throughput \u2014 is security. Ideally, it should be faster and cheaper to interact with L-2s, but also as safe to transact as using Ethereum.\n\nUnsurprisingly, in practice it\u2019s complicated and not always black and white.\n\n\u201cSecurity,\u201d in this context, refers to the settlement guarantees on Ethereum mainnet. That translates to how certain a user can be that their L-2 transactions will be finalized correctly \u2014 without censorship \u2014 and whether assets remain safe from being stolen by the more performant layer-2.\n\nWe\u2019re not talking security from smart contract bugs at the level of applications (it\u2019s not about avoiding exploits or rugpulls), but whether the Ethereum Virtual Machine runs the code and reconciles its state per specifications.\n\nThere\u2019s not a universally accepted definition of what it means to be \u201csecured by Ethereum.\u201d According to Louis Guthmann, ecosystem lead at StarkWare, a key feature of assessing whether an L-2 qualifies is the existence of an \u201cescape hatch\u201d \u2014 a way to permissionlessly exit with one\u2019s assets back to Ethereum mainnet.\n\n\u201cA layer-2 requires a mechanism that allows itself to resolve its challenges using the main chain,\u201d Guthmann told Blockworks.\n\nData aggregator L2Beat defines a layer-2 as \u201ca chain that fully or partially derives its security from [Ethereum mainnet] so that users do not have to rely on the honesty of L2 validators for the security of their funds.\u201d\n\nIt provides a handy \u201crisk analysis\u201d framework for keeping track of various L-2 options. Projects are ranked by total value locked (TVL), not security, but the framework compares all active layer-2s across a spectrum of security-related criteria.\n\nSource: L2Beat\n\nOf these, the \u201cstate validation\u201d method is what L2Beat deems \u201cmost important\u201d because that is how the chain \u201censures that L2 validators cannot cheat and include invalid transactions in a L2 block, e.g. mint coins out of thin air or steal your coins,\u201d according to the site\u2019s FAQ.\n\nValidation occurs through either validity proofs (also known as ZK proofs) or fraud proofs (also known as fault proofs).\n\nA zero-knowledge proof is a cryptographic technique used in layer-2 rollups to verify the correctness of a transaction or computation without revealing any sensitive information.\n\nImagine you have a treasure chest with a secret combination lock, and you want to prove to your friend that you know the correct combination without actually telling them the numbers. With a zero-knowledge proof, you can demonstrate conclusively that you can open the chest and thus have the combination, without actually disclosing the code.\n\nFraud proofs are an alternative way to detect and prevent malicious activities or errors in the transaction processing on a rollup. It ensures that the transactions executed off-chain are honest and accurate.\n\nThe proof on Ethereum mainnet acts like a referee who checks the moves of a chess game to make sure they are legal. If anyone tries to cheat or submits an incorrect game state, the fraudulent or faulty action won\u2019t be accepted.\n\nData availability refers to whether transaction data is stored on Ethereum mainnet \u2014 the most secure \u2014 or elsewhere.\n\nCombining these two, we have four widely accepted varieties of Layer-2s. Per L2Beat:\n\nzkRollups \u2014 Validity Proofs with data on L1 Ethereum;\n\nOptimistic Rollups \u2014 Fraud Proofs with data on L1 Ethereum;\n\nValidium \u2014 Validity Proofs with data kept off-chain; and\n\nPlasma \u2014 Fraud Proofs with data kept off-chain.\n\nEach of these varieties entails tradeoffs, and some may be more suited to specific use cases than others.\n\nThe first zk proof-based rollup was Loopring, which launched a dex back in February 2020. But it has stagnated in recent years, L2Beat data shows, processing about one transaction every 10 seconds, while the chain\u2019s TVL has fallen 88% from its 2021 peak, and consists of over 50% LRC \u2014 the chain\u2019s own native token.\n\nA new focus on its smart wallet and gaming initiatives remains.\n\nOptimistic rollup launch\n\nThe first optimistic rollups to hit mainnet were Arbitrum (ARB), launched in August 2021, and Optimism (OP) which followed in December 2021. Both took up the \u201csecured by Ethereum\u201d mantle through the mechanism of fraud proofs.\n\nAccording to Optimism developer OP Labs, \u201cfault proofs\u201d is a more accurate term.\n\n\u201cThe system isn\u2019t always detecting \u2018fraud,\u2019 the majority of the time it\u2019s just \u2018fault\u2019 (i.e. a node wasn\u2019t synced and it agrees with an incorrect output root, etc.),\u201d an OP Labs spokesperson told Blockworks. But L2Beat uses the more common \u201cfraud proof\u201d and they are conceptually interchangeable.\n\nThe difference initially was in the details of the fraud proof implementation. Optimism opted for a simpler \u201csingle-round\u201d proof design, while Arbitrum developer Offchain Labs preferred \u201cinteractive proofs.\u201d\n\nA subsequent audit of Optimism by security researcher Yoav Weiss showed in March 2022 that \u201csingle-round fraud proofs are hard to secure,\u201d for which he received a retroactive grant from the Optimism team.\n\n\u201cIf fraud proofs become too complex, they could make full decentralization too risky,\u201d Weiss wrote. \u201cA malicious sequencer could corrupt and rugpull the entire rollup if it can make an unprovable state transition.\u201d\n\nThe sequencer is a key component of rollups responsible for transaction ordering and can be centralized or decentralized, but today\u2019s examples are predominantly centralized.\n\nOptimism switched to an approach more similar to Arbitrum\u2019s, in its \u201ccannon\u201d release, although Ben Jones, director at the Optimism Foundation, told Blockworks the \u201cvulnerabilities were not the driver for us changing course.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is true though that some flexibility is limited, and our decision to pioneer the first EVM equivalent L2 codebase made that flexibility and modularity more important than ever,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThis was the main driver, alongside research breakthroughs resulting from the development of cannon.\u201d\n\nOf the two major optimistic rollups by TVL and activity, only Arbitrum has implemented fraud proofs. That has been a major point of contention between the two teams over security claims, with Offchain Labs co-founder Steve Goldfeder going so far as to analogize Optimism\u2019s current status to \u201cbuilding cars without engines\u201d but then trying \u201cto sell one by putting a sticker on it that says \u2018very powerful engine\u2019.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nRelative immaturity\n\nOptimism\u2019s recent Bedrock upgrade introduced a number of improvements, but fault proofs were not among them. Jones didn\u2019t specify a timeline, but said \u201cfault proofs are a key priority on our decentralization roadmap.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are aiming towards reaching [L2Beat\u2019s] Stage 2 decentralization as quickly as possible, and in our view, Stage 2 requires multiple implementations of the fault proof.\u201d\n\nL2Beat released its framework of \u201cstages\u201d earlier this month, building upon Ethereum co-found Vitalik Buterin\u2019s proposed milestones. It notes the stages focus on decentralization \u201cmaturity\u201d which is not necessarily directly analogous to security \u2014 although there are clear parallels.\n\n\n\nBedrock now has multiple execution clients, a unique feature Jones said, that is \u201cpaving the way for multiple [fault] proofs.\u201d\n\nThe OP Stack\u2019s \u201csuperchain\u201d concept isn\u2019t limited to fault proofs, but can include zero-knowledge proofs as well. The Optimism Foundation recently put out a request for proposal to develop exactly that, encouraging teams such as Mina protocol\u2019s O(1) Labs to complete its design.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nJones said a successful candidate will improve composability between superchains in addition to providing redundancy.\n\n\u201cA very important note on this RFP is that it is for the same exact state machine which the fault proofs run,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThis means that having a ZK-secured chain will not require sacrifices to EVM equivalence.\u201d\n\nStarkware\u2019s Guthmann said \u201chaving more adoption of zk as their underlying proof system is very exciting for the ecosystem \u2014 it\u2019s more investment more research and hopefully more efficient provers and infrastructure for blockchain to develop.\u201d\n\nHe views L2Beat\u2019s concept of Stage 0-to-2 rollups as \u201ca bit too strict.\u201d\n\nTo reach Stage 1, a rollup must have deployed a \u201ccomplete and functional proof system,\u201d with \u201cat least five external actors who can submit fraud proofs,\u201d and users must be able to exit to Ethereum mainnet \u201cwithout the help of the permissioned operators.\u201d\n\nStage 2 further requires \u201cthe rollup becomes fully managed by smart contracts,\u201d with a permissionless fraud proof system \u2014 anyone can submit a proof \u2014 and at least a 30-day timelock for system upgrades, giving users \u201cample time to exit.\u201d\n\nThis goes back to the notion of an \u201cescape hatch.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe gap from 0 to 1 is tremendous,\u201d Guthmann said. \u201cAnd even from 1 to 2 is unrealistic for any L-2 that\u2019s going to have a governance, because basically number two assumes that you\u2019re never going to upgrade your system, which is problematic,\u201d he said.\n\nJones said \u201cpermissionless withdrawals are insufficient to be \u2018secured by Ethereum,\u2019 if there is still a multisig which can unilaterally break security properties.\u201d\n\nMulti-signature wallet schemes are frequently used to manage the upgradability of smart contracts.\n\n\u201cThe ability to withdraw to L1 \u2014 to another environment \u2014 is what makes them more interesting as a scaleability solution where you keep self-custody,\u201d Guthmann said. Governance of a system relies on some kind of upgradeability, whether it\u2019s Ethereum\u2019s social consensus process, or proof-of-stake token voting, or a multisig controlled by a smaller group.\n\nIt\u2019s fundamentally a question of where chains fall on the decentralization spectrum, and Gutman said zero-knowledge tech enables scaleability gains to come without undermining decentralization.\n\nOf the major rollups, only Arbitrum has reached Stage 1. (Decentralized exchange dYdX is listed based on its deployment on Starkware\u2019s StarkEx system, but it will soon migrate to a Cosmos-based sovereign rollup.)\n\nGuthmann thinks that classification is fully justified. \u201cThey\u2019re doing much better than any of the other teams combined,\u201d he said.\n\nBut ultimately, he expects zero-knowledge tech to become the standard on both a security and scalability basis.\n\n\u201cThere is a difference between Optimism and their lack of fraud proofs, and zkSync and what Starkware does. There is a difference of technological advancement.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The Ethereum Name Service (ENS), a decentralized domain name system built on the Ethereum blockchain, will implement Layer 2 interoperability with ENS domains, according to the project\u2019s developer, ENS Labs, during a community call on Thursday.\n\nThe team said it identified Layer 2 interoperability as a crucial upgrade in the pipeline. Layer 2 solutions, such as Arbitrum and Optimism, are \u2018off-chain\u2019 mechanisms designed to handle transactions away from the Layer 1 Ethereum blockchain to improve scalability and reduce costs. By providing a mechanism for Layer 2 solutions to interact with ENS domains, the team aims to make domain name registrations and transactions more accessible to a broader user base.\n\nThe team plans to utilize off-chain resolvers with the help of an ENS off-chain registrar contract and various service providers, including the Coinbase-operated project cb.id, Lens Protocol (on Polygon), and OptiNames (on Optimism), among others.\n\nGasless import of web names\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThe team announced that web-integrated domain name TLDs, including .art and .box, are collaborating with ENS Labs for close integration. This will allow users to register browser-supported names via ENS. Furthermore, it will also enable DNS names to be traded as NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain for the first time this year.\n\nIn this context, a new roadmap feature discussed during the call and included in the roadmap is the option to import DNS, the web naming protocol, into ENS at no transaction costs, thus making it \"gasless.\" This feature, slated for release in the third quarter of the year, has the potential to improve web accessibility to the ENS ecosystem and lower the barrier to entry for traditional internet users, the team noted.\n\n\u201cGasless DNS names and expanded Layer 2 interoperability, which we aim to launch before the end of Q3, are the next steps in our goal to make ENS names the standard for decentralized digital identity in Web3,\u201d Nick Johnson, ENS founder and lead developer, said in a statement to The Block. \u201cThese types of developments are key for us as we work towards simplifying onboarding and increasing the accessibility of Ethereum and crypto.\u201d"

        "title": "Why Ethereum, Shiba Inu, and Bitcoin Cash Are Rising Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nMost cryptocurrencies moved higher today, as more mainstream financial institutions filed to launch spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and as altcoins gained steam.\n\nSince late afternoon yesterday, the price of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH 0.42%), traded 3.4% higher as of 10:35 a.m. ET today. Meanwhile, the price of the meme token Shiba Inu (SHIB 0.73%) traded 4.5% higher, while the price of Bitcoin Cash (BCH 3.59%) had jumped nearly 26%.\n\nSo what\n\nEver since the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF, cryptocurrencies have been rallying on the belief that more interest in the sector from mainstream financial giants will ultimately increase exposure.\n\nWhile other spot Bitcoin ETFs have been rejected by the SEC, BlackRock's filing seemed to change the game because it proposed a surveillance-sharing agreement with the Nasdaq, where it intends to list the ETF. This agreement would share information about trading activity and the identity of customers, which the SEC believes is necessary to prevent market manipulation.\n\nFollowing BlackRock, a swarm of other players have proposed Bitcoin ETFs with the SEC and the latest is Fidelity, which has also proposed to have a surveillance-sharing agreement. These ETFs would ultimately make it easier for investors to gain access to Bitcoin without having to buy the cryptocurrency itself.\n\nIn other news, Bitcoin Cash has been exploding higher all week, most recently on a ton of trading volume out of investors in South Korea. The excitement continues to be fueled by the news that Bitcoin Cash is one of four cryptocurrencies being listed by a new exchange called EDX Markets, which is backed by Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and Citadel.\n\nInterestingly, the exchange decided to list Bitcoin Cash because it believes regulators are likely to determine that the cryptocurrency is a commodity and not a security. Whether or not cryptocurrencies are commodities or securities is a big point of contention in the crypto ecosystem right now. Commodities would be regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, while securities would be overseen by what is presumed to be the much stricter SEC.\n\nIn more regulatory news today, a new bill that formally recognizes cryptocurrencies as a regulated financial instrument and investment was officially made a law today in the United Kingdom. Many believe that regulatory clarity is a necessity for crypto to be able to move forward.\n\nNow what\n\nNews regarding spot Bitcoin ETFs has been the biggest driver of cryptocurrencies in recent weeks, so it makes sense that the news regarding Fidelity continued to fuel the sector today.\n\nBut the fact that investors are pouring into Bitcoin Cash because they think the token is likely to be deemed a commodity instead of a security is interesting and could represent a newer trend in the industry.\n\nWith the SEC seemingly getting more aggressive in its attempts to bring more cryptocurrencies under its purview, investors may start to favor those that they view as commodities. While I still like Ethereum the best in this group of cryptocurrencies, this is certainly a trend that bears watching."

        "title": "Ethereum founder says crypto is on the cusp of a \u2018broadband moment\u2019 - Fortune",
        "content": "Since the collapse of FTX in November, the conversation around crypto has been dominated by dark mutterings about its demise or endless chatter over regulation. That\u2019s why it was refreshing to speak to Joe Lubin, one of the cofounders of Ethereum who is now best known for overseeing ConsenSys, which has evolved from a chaotic crypto incubator to a software company known for the popular MetaMask wallet.\n\nUnlike many in the industry, Lubin is brimming with optimism. He still espouses the original gospel of Ethereum, which celebrates decentralized software projects and views blockchains as a vehicle for a new political and social order beyond the reach of Big Tech. In our recent chat, he told me he\u2019s untroubled by the fallout from FTX, which wiped out the likes of Voyager, Celsius, and other centralized crypto services.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t consider them real crypto companies. They co-opted our messaging to cheat naive consumers,\u201d says Lubin, suggesting the troubles of the past nine months amounted in part to a healthy cleansing.\n\nHe added that the demise of the centralized services has helped true crypto companies focus and rebuild, paving the way for \u201cour broadband moment\u201d\u2014an analogy for when widespread fiber build-outs helped millions of consumers appreciate the benefits of the internet. To this end, ConsenSys is rebranding\u2014replete with bright new colors\u2014with the goal of expanding its services beyond a select group of developers and end users. Lubin says the new focus will be on making crypto tools ever easier to use and empowering people of all stripes to participate in building a new version of the web, based around people, not data-gobbling monopolies.\n\nA lot of what Lubin had to say echoes the theories put forth by venture capitalist and Web3 evangelist Chris Dixon prior to crypto\u2019s massive downturn. I\u2019m not sure how much of this I buy\u2014especially since governments and old-line tech companies seem as powerful as ever, and as much of the public has soured on crypto. For now, it might be more prudent for the crypto industry to focus less on Web3 utopias and more on ensuring that people stop getting robbed.\n\nThat said, Lubin made a strong case that crypto is on the cusp of a new breakthrough to follow the sudden rise of DeFi and then of NFTs. He says the area to watch right now is wallets, especially as companies like Coinbase start building \u201cwallet as a service\u201d tools intended to make it easier for firms of any kind to integrate crypto into their operations. This doesn\u2019t feel far-fetched given how giant brands like Starbucks, Nike, and Reddit are also quietly using crypto and NFTs behind the scenes.\n\nIn the broader picture, though, Lubin\u2019s sunny vision feels far-fetched in many regards, but if even a portion of it is true, then the crypto industry is indeed poised for another big leap forward.\n\nA quick programming note: There will be no newsletter Monday or Tuesday given the July Fourth holiday. So have a safe and happy Independence Day, and to those of you north of the border, happy Canada Day. Go enjoy some hot dogs.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nBitcoin has been trading in a narrow range of $1,500 since hitting a 52-week high of $31,400 a week ago, a sign of ongoing strength, analysts say.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, experienced a sharp price drop recently, moving from $1,940 to $1,847. While various factors play into the volatility of cryptocurrency prices, the substantial sell-off by a particular \"whale\" is believed to have significantly contributed to Ethereum's decline in this instance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA \"whale\" in the crypto universe refers to an individual or entity that holds a large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. When such a player makes substantial trades, it often triggers notable price movements. In this case, an Ethereum whale strategically deposited 25,000 ETH (valued at approximately $47.24 million) to Binance, the popular crypto exchange platform, and withdrew 15.9 million USDT 12 hours later.\n\nThe smart whale who deposited 25K $ETH ($47.24M) to #Binance yesterday withdrew 16M $USDT again 9 hrs ago.\n\n\n\nThe drop in $ETH price 11 hrs ago was most likely due to the sell-off of this whale.\n\n\n\nAnd the whale may have ~8K $ETH ($14.7M) left unsold.https://t.co/EucQrT7C4w pic.twitter.com/Aogfv9vOdO \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 29, 2023\n\nRenowned for buying low and selling high, this crypto whale has maintained a perfect win rate for Ethereum trading over the past couple of months. This successful strategy, while profitable for the whale, has recently resulted in downward pressure on ETH's price.\n\nJust nine hours after the initial transaction, the whale proceeded to withdraw another 16 million USDT, further contributing to Ethereum's downward spiral. Analysts believe the sudden drop in Ethereum's price was largely attributed to this whale's substantial sell-off.\n\nWith approximately 8,000 ETH (roughly $14.7 million) yet to be sold, this influential whale's future trading activities could potentially exert additional selling pressure on Ethereum's market value. However, it is also crucial to note that crypto markets can be affected by a myriad of factors, including global economic trends, regulatory news and changes in investor sentiment.\n\nThis recent event underscores the amount of power and influence whales have on the cryptocurrency market. Retail investors should always stay cautious and track large wallets to avoid unexpected sell-offs like this one."

However, new records show that Hinman was repeatedly forewarned by colleagues that the speech would confuse markets.\n\nThe Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Lubin said, viewed Ether as a commodity. The three most valuable assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Tether, according to CFTC Chairman Rostin Benham, should be governed by his agency like commodities.\n\nGary Gensler, the current chairman of the SEC, has only publicly recognized Bitcoin as such and has refrained from declaring Ethereum to be either a security or a commodity. Legislation to clarify the situation is being drafted by Congressmen, including Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand, who have stated their agreement with the CFTC that Ether is a commodity alongside Bitcoin. According to Lubin, the regulatory decision that Ethereum is not a security is a \"forgone conclusion.\""

        "content": "Ethereum price is holding gains above the $1,800 level against the US Dollar. ETH could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $1,880 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum is attempting a fresh increase from the $1,820 zone.\n\nThe price is trading near $1,865 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $1,838 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could rise steadily if it clears the $1,880 resistance in the near term.\n\nEthereum Price Aims Fresh Increase\n\nEthereum\u2019s price started a downside correction below the $1,865 support. ETH even spiked below the $1,820 level but the downsides were limited, unlike Bitcoin.\n\nA low is formed near $1,817 and the price is now attempting a fresh increase. There was a break above the $1,840 resistance zone. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $1,838 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEther is now testing the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,912 swing high to the $1,817 low. It is also trading near $1,865 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nImmediate resistance is near the $1,875 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,912 swing high to the $1,817 low. The next major resistance is near the $1,900 level. The first breakout level is near the $1,920 level.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA close above the $1,920 zone could start a fresh rally. The next resistance sits near $2,000, above which the price could rise toward the $2,050 level. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $2,120 resistance.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,875 resistance or $1,880, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,860 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,840 level. The first major support is near $1,820. If there is a move below $1,820, the price could drop toward $1,790. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,740 support.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,820\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,880\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nJoe Lubin, Ethereum Co-Founder and the CEO of ConsenSys is not worried about ether (ETH) being classed as a security in the United States after the crypto\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model.\n\nSpeaking during a June 28 interview with CNBC, Lubin noted that a regulatory decision on ether has already been made. \u201cThe CFTC has spoken very crisply a number of times that they consider Ether like a commodity,\u201d he stated.\n\nNotably, the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC) boss Rostin Benham has previously said that the top three cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum, and Tether\u2019s USDT, belong under his agency\u2019s purview as commodities.\n\nBenham\u2019s opinion, however, directly contradicts that of Securities and Exchange Commission boss Gary Gensler, who has on multiple occasions indicated that \u201ceverything other than Bitcoin\u201d fits the definition of securities. Earlier this month, Gensler\u2019s hammer struck twice as the SEC filed landmark lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase for purportedly offering cryptocurrencies that the regulator deems to be unregistered securities.\n\nThe commission\u2019s chairman has also hinted that ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, fell under this umbrella after the network\u2019s monumental shift to a proof of stake consensus mechanism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Gensler wasn\u2019t always so trenchant a detractor. Before becoming the chair of SEC, he taught courses on digital currency at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and consulted with that school\u2019s Digital Currency Initiative. During this time, he believed ether had graduated from being a security into a commodity by 2018.\n\n\u201cThe SEC has spoken,\u201d Lubin opined, referencing former SEC director William Hinman\u2019s 2018 speech Ethereum speech where he declared the asset a non-security. Recently unmasked documents revealed that Hinman dismissed warnings from other SEC staffers who believed his comments would cause immense market confusion.\n\nNotably, Gensler refused to say whether ether was a security during a five-hour-long hearing in April. \u201cIt\u2019s really a forgone conclusion at this point,\u201d Lubin observed. \u201cThere may be a regulator or two in the United States that can\u2019t bring himself to utter the fact that Ether is not a security, but I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s the case.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, industry figures and billionaires like Mark Cuban are calling out the SEC for failing to provide crypto firms with a clear registration process to comply with."

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin Cash, a spin-off from the oldest digital asset, has struggled to find a market since launching in 2017. But it\u2019s been on a roll this month: since the start of June, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is up 98%, jumping from $113 to $224.\n\nThe slightly obscure digital asset\u2014one of many cryptocurrency \u201cforks\u201d\u2014is following Bitcoin, like many other coins and tokens which have surged in price since the biggest digital asset experienced a run. But BCH is doing by far the best.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhy? The coin is one of the lucky four chosen for EDX Markets, a new crypto exchange backed by major Wall Street players Charles Schwab, Citadel Securities, and Fidelity Digital Assets.\n\nEDX, which launched last week, decided to let its traders\u2014institutional investors only\u2014start off with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nThe reason is simple: regulatory clarity.\n\n\u201cThese specific cryptocurrencies are generally perceived as commodities by regulatory bodies, which significantly mitigates potential legal challenges,\u201d Sei Labs co-founder Jeff Feng told Decrypt.\n\nYouwei Yang, Chief Economist at BTCM, added that the four assets are \u201cwidely regarded as digital commodities, making them relatively safe\u201d from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission because they are made with electricity\u2014a commodity.\n\nIn perhaps its toughest regulatory crackdown yet, the SEC has gone after a number of major crypto brands for allegedly flogging unregistered securities. Earlier this month, it went after Coinbase for allegedly offering and selling unregistered securities via its staking service. It also targeted Binance, the world\u2019s biggest exchange, with a massive lawsuit for allegedly \u201coperating as a fking [sic] unlicensed securities exchange in the U.S.A. bro,\u201d according to the SEC.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn February, it hit Kraken with a $30 million fine for allegedly failing to register the offer and sale of its crypto asset staking-as-a-service program.\n\nThese regulatory enforcements are all because SEC Chairman Gary Gensler thinks\u2014and has said for years\u2014that most cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities.\n\nBut he has made it clear that Bitcoin is a commodity. He has been less clear on Ethereum, but the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CTFC) has said the asset is a commodity.\n\nAnd Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin are both Bitcoin forks\u2014new cryptocurrencies that emerged from the asset\u2019s original code\u2014meaning they are likely to have the same status in the eyes of regulators.\n\nGreg Moritz, Co-Founder at the crypto hedge fund AltTab Capital, said that \u201cnone have been listed by the SEC as unregistered securities,\u201d adding that all four assets are established and have history, \u201ckey factors in the decision-making process of EDX\u2019s backers.\u201d\n\nEDX Markets CEO Jamil Nazarali also said that he felt \u201cvery comfortable\u201d that the four assets weren\u2019t securities.\n\nFor now, these four \u201cold school\u201d cryptocurrencies will give \u201cold school\u201d investors a taste of the crypto world. But things could change, Feng noted. \u201cAs regulations evolve and the understanding of different cryptocurrencies becomes more nuanced, we could anticipate exchanges like EDX broadening their offerings,\u201d he added.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

Dhamodharan told Fortune that:\n\n\u201cA lot of the things people cover and talk about these days in crypto are the regulatory aspects of it and all the technology and investment as an asset and so forth,\u201d\n\nHe added that the underlying technology that powers crypto is \u201cactually quite useful.\u201d\n\nThe company confirmed its commitment to crypto in the official announcement, which flagged the move as a \u201cnatural evolution\u201d for a \u201cwider range of payment solutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur goal is to support the wider digital asset industry and interested parties to help fortify confidence in its future.\u201d\n\nMastercard\u2019s previous forays into the digital asset sector include non-fungible tokens (NFTs), crypto-linked credit and debit cards, crypto infrastructure, and developer tools.\n\nThe firm also offers products such as \u2018Crypto Secure,\u2019 \u2018Crypto Source\u2019 and \u2018Crypto Credential\u2019 which it claims bring \u201cmore transparency and trust to this space.\u201d\n\nPrograms and applications on the new \u2018app store\u2019 can be written in Solidity, the Ethereum programming language.\n\nMoreover, developers using the beta will be able to experiment with tokenized commercial bank deposits and blockchain data that state how much cash someone has in their bank account.\n\nMastercard plans to make MTN available in additional markets around the world over time, according to the announcement.\n\nCrypto Market Outlook\n\nCrypto markets have begun their retreat from Bitcoin\u2019s resistance zone above $30K. As a result, total market capitalization is down 1.4% today at $1.20 trillion, according to CoinGecko.\n\nBTC remains above $30K but only just, trading at $30,100 at the time of writing. Meanwhile, Ethereum prices are beginning to break down again, with a 1.8% decline to $1,831.\n\nThe entire top 50 altcoins were in the red at the time of writing."

        "content": "A recently organized team of researchers, the \u200b\u200bSpecial Mechanisms Group (SMG), demonstrated Thursday how to take advantage of a facet of the proposer-builder separation market to force through an Ethereum block containing just one transaction: theirs.\n\nProposer-builder separation (PBS) is intended to increase censorship-resistance by separating the roles of block builders and block proposers in the more-or-less unceasing Ethereum blockchain. But the group found a way to use the feature to make a very public point.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThe block\u2019s lone transaction embedded a URL to a presentation and research paper on SMG\u2019s website, describing the problem and proposing potential ways to address it.\n\nReactions were decidedly mixed.\n\nRyan Berckmans, a former software engineer at Augur, was among many who pointed out that Ethereum\u2019s gas fee market would make it difficult to delay transactions using this method for long, but noted it did reveal certain problems in the way some applications on Ethereum calculate fees needed to get transactions included in a block.\n\n\u201cThe interesting thing about the quoted method is that to censor all transactions for one block, they only have to outbid priority fees.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nEthereum is designed to be \u201ccredibly neutral,\u201d and therefore any time user transactions can be prevented from being included in a block, it\u2019s cause for alarm.\n\n(Technically, post-Merge they\u2019re called \u201cslots,\u201d but the terms are interchangeable.)\n\nBut most people conceptualize \u201ccensorship\u201d as preventing a transaction permanently, not merely delaying it for a short time. It\u2019s also not a new problem.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThe SMG group disagrees.\n\n\u201cWhen bidders in an auction, or agents in a financial system can censor their competition, the efficiency of these systems erodes,\u201d they tweeted. \u201cIn other words, censorship-resistance is about more than just ensuring a transaction gets on-chain \u2018eventually.\u2019 It needs to be fast.\u201d\n\nSMG\u2019s head of research and one of the paper\u2019s authors, Max Resnick, told Blockworks, \u201cwe are more worried about 12 seconds being enough time to cause a problem than 10 mins,\u201d although he said the critics overestimate the cost of increasing the delay period further.\n\nEven on a short timeframe, however, \u201cthere are a lot of useful mechanisms (like auctions) that we can\u2019t build on chain because it would be easy for participants to censor their competition\u2019s bids,\u201d Resnick said.\n\nSome use cases that don\u2019t tolerate inclusion delays could migrate to layer-2s, but not all, he said.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s use enshrined PBS as an example, because that is an auction that we want to run on-chain and can\u2019t really be run on a rollup.\u201d\n\nEnshrined PBS, or ePBS, would implement PBS at the protocol level \u2014 the Ethereum mainnet consensus layer \u2014 but how to do this is an active research topic and remains a relatively distant prospect.\n\n\u201cThis is particularly relevant in auctions, but also applies to fraud proofs and oracle updates to a lesser extent,\u201d Resnick said.\n\nIn other words, this case implies that it may be hard to reduce the window for producing a fraud proof in optimistic rollups, although it does not impact ZK rollups.\n\n\u201cI think if we could make the base chain more censorship resistant, then optimistic rollups would have better user experience,\u201d Resnick said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

For safety, it has to be a multi-sig, and multi-sigs for staking are still fairly difficult to set up. It gets complicated in a bunch of ways.\u201d\n\nMulti-sig refers to requiring more than one user to sign and authorize a transaction. Therefore, crypto assets remain secure even if a private key is compromised.\n\nIn 2021, Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake said he doesn\u2019t stake all his ETH. Explaining why, he used a sausage-making analogy, adding that rare, unpredictable events also influenced his decision.\n\n\u201cwhen you make the sausage, you know how it\u2019s made, and there\u2019s a bunch of tail risk that\u2019s difficult to quantify.\u201d\n\nInput-Output CEO and Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson seized upon Buterin\u2019s comments, saying he stakes all of his ADA \u2013 taking the opportunity to infer Ethereum is not \u201cproperly designed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had to listen to this a few times. I\u2019m just at a loss for words. All of our Ada is staked. Guess what, that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be for a properly designed Proof of Stake protocol.\u201c\n\nHowever, Max Radeleus, the co-Founder of INTU, a protocol that introduced dEOAs (decentralized externally owned accounts) at ETHDenver this year, argued that Buterin might be underestimating what\u2019s possible with continued Ethereum innovation.\n\nEOAs are the most basic type of Ethereum accounts using a public and private key pair. INTU introduced a cryptographic method to split private keys without needing a smart contract wallet, the kind of account likely referenced by Buterin when talking about multi-sigs.\n\n\u201cAs Mr Buterin so succinctly highlights, secure solutions on chain are currently difficult; I mean if he has issues with it, who wouldn\u2019t? However, we\u2019re not done innovating on Ethereum yet! dEOAs make it simple to launch multi-party (MPC) accounts which solve many of Vitalik\u2019s issues here, and just perhaps, this is what is needed for further staking adoption.\u201d\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Cardano's co-founder Charles Hoskinson has taken a swipe at Ethereum, the blockchain he helped create, over its staking mechanism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a pointed tweet, Hoskinson responded to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin's comments on the complications of staking Ether, the blockchain's native cryptocurrency.\n\nHoskinson claimed that \"all of our ADA is staked,\" insinuating that this is how a correctly designed proof-of-stake protocol should operate.\n\nThe comments came in reply to a user question about the percentage of Hoskinson's ADA that was staked, compared to Buterin's Ether.\n\nButerin had previously admitted that he only staked a relatively small portion of his Ether, explaining that the process was complex.\n\nHe noted that staking Ether required the associated keys to be made public, a requirement that raises safety concerns. As a solution, multi-signature (multi-sig) transactions are recommended, but Buterin admits these are still somewhat difficult to set up. \"And you know, it gets complicated in a bunch of ways,\" he added.\n\nHoskinson's criticism is the latest in a series of swipes at Ethereum. As reported by U.Today, he previously called Ethereum \"a dumpster fire.\" He also forecast that Ethereum could lose its popularity in the same way as older apps like MySpace and Netscape. His prediction suggested that Ethereum might eventually become obsolete, much like those early Internet giants that were eventually superseded by more innovative solutions.\n\nThe Cardano founder has also boldly suggested that Ethereum might one day migrate to Cardano, citing the potential for Cardano to become a better, faster, and cheaper platform with higher liquidity and more users"

Although it is extremely rare, penalties can be severe, Iyer explained.\n\nValidators could lose a cut of their stake or be removed from a network completely if they are slashed.\n\n\u201cWhen staking your ETH, even with the best technical set-up and expertise, mistakes can happen and slashing can occur,\u201d Hugh Karp the founder of Nexus Mutual said in a statement reviewed by Blockworks. \u201cThe most professional operators recognize this and put in place protection for their users.\u201d\n\nNexus Mutual itself dedicates a portion of the ether in its capital pool to staking as a way to generate revenue for the DAO.\n\nChorus One will provide base coverage for all users who stake Ethereum through OPUS, its multi-chain staking API for institutions, until the end of this year. This measure aims to protect customers from potential slashing losses.\n\nOPUS serves as a non-custodial staking solution that enables investors and institutions to stake their tokens securely. Additionally, institutions have the option to integrate OPUS into their products, allowing them to provide staking services to their customers.\n\n\u201cOur customers also have the option of going for an upgradable insurance cover on other networks outside of Ethereum as well,\u201d Iyer said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "It\u2019s official. ZK Stack is now available to developers.\n\nMatter Labs, developers of the zero-knowledge layer-2 scaling solution zkSync Era, recently released the open-source code to the public.\n\nSo what\u2019s so special about it?\n\nMatter Labs\u2019 Alex Gluchowski and Anthony Rose spoke to Blockworks on the 0xResearch podcast (Apple/Spotify) about the nuts and bolts of the Ethereum-compatible open-source protocol that rivals Optimism\u2019s OP Stack.\n\nZK Stack is a modular framework for building highly customizable blockchains, CEO Gluchowski told Blockworks. The layer-2 tech uses cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs rather than the \u201coptimistic\u201d approach to rollups, which assumes transaction validity unless proven otherwise.\n\nSenior vice-president of technology Rose says the system includes all the \u201ccore components\u201d that together would be used to form \u201chyperchains.\u201d\n\nThe stack will also include \u201cthe tooling around that,\u201d he says, like compilers, SDKs for configurations and so forth. \u201cEssentially,\u201d it\u2019s everything needed \u201cto be able to deploy a version of this system that looks like Era today, but over time could be more flexible.\u201d\n\nCustomize or copy-paste\n\n\u201cYou can start with all the defaults. Just copy the configuration of zkSync Era,\u201d Gluchowski explains. \u201cOr you can say, I want this component to look differently.\u201d\n\nGluchowski explains the sequencer can be customized to be centralized or decentralized in functionality, depending on the developer\u2019s needs and preferences.\n\nWhile certain enterprises, banks or gaming companies might not feel a need to decentralize the sequencer, Gluchowski expects most chains to sequence transactions in a decentralized manner.\n\n\u201cYou will be able to choose all of the parameters, which consensus algorithm you want to use, how you secure it, what token you want to use there and so on.\u201d\n\nThe data availability mechanism is also customizable, Gluchowski continues.\n\n\u201cZK rollup is an architecture in which you publish data availability through the Ethereum network,\u201d He says. \u201cYou rely on Ethereum\u2019s layer-1 as your data availability layer.\u201d\n\nBecause the technology relies on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet for security, it is \u201cby far, the most secure option,\u201d he says. But as of now, he admits, this security comes \u201cat a price.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the rollups on Ethereum \u2014 Optimistic and ZK rollups alike \u2014 share the same data bandwidth, the same limited block space which you can utilize for your data.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s currently pretty limited,\u201d he says, but will be extended once proto-danksharding is implemented on Ethereum. Data availability demands will be \u201ca bottleneck\u201d for now, he says, adding it may need to be managed by other parties in the meantime to handle demands.\n\nA seamless experience\n\nAccording to Gluchowski, one major advantage of the new tech is its ability to provide complex interactions between decentralized parties in seamless transactions.\n\nUsers will be able to interact with all the DeFi protocols like Uniswap or Curve \u201con the ZK rollup side,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cImagine Uniswap would launch their own \u2018Uni-chain\u2019 as a separate hyper chain in the zkSync network,\u201d he says. The chain would be fully separate with its own sequencer and enjoy all the benefits of security provided by Ethereum.\n\nIf an individual with funds in a wallet on zkSync Era wanted to interact with Uniswap on-chain and execute a trade, it would appear as one seamless transaction to the user, he says.\n\nThe transaction would bridge from Era over a \u201chyper-bridge\u201d to the Uniswap chain, where it would reach the smart contract and swap tokens. The tokens would then be sent back over the bridge to the user wallet.\n\n\u201cAll of that will happen asynchronously, but atomically,\u201d Gluchowski says. In other words, \u201call of these transactions will be scheduled and they cannot be stopped.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor you as a user, you just wait a couple of minutes and the funds come back.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

In a remarkable twist, Solana has taken the center stage as it relates to the overall trading volume of its non-fungible tokens (NFTs) when compared to that of Ethereum.\n\nPer the data embedded in the screenshot shared by Sol Bulletin, Solana's NFT trading volume topped $25.5 million in a 24 hour range while that of Ethereum was pegged at $24.5 million. Notably, this bullish growth milestone is the first time Solana will be beating Ethereum in terms of total NFT trading volume.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 BREAKING NEWS: @solana JUST FLIPPED @ethereum IN 24 HOUR SALES VOLUME FOR THE 1ST TIME IN HISTORY. pic.twitter.com/MDB6UwZyfK \u2014 Sol Bulletin \ud83d\udccc (@SolBulletin) June 30, 2023\n\nComparing Solana and Ethereum ecosystems\n\nAs Layer-1 blockchain protocols, the duo of Ethereum and Solana both have decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. While Solana has a notable functional DeFi ecosystem, it is by no means a match for Ethereum.\n\nData from DefiLlama pegs the total value locked (TVL) on Ethereum at $26.7 billion, a figure that surpasses more than half of the entire industry TVL. Solana's TVL, on the other hand, is pegged at $265.57 million.\n\nTheir respective market capitalization is also a major distinguishing metric, with Ethereum's pegged at $231.17 billion while that of Solana is pegged at a mere $7.38 billion.\n\nEthereum has been tagged as the most liquid blockchain for smart contracts, and while Solana is an able contender, it is still miles apart. While Ethereum dominates in many ways, Solana's developers are arguably more laser focused on introducing unique real world utility into the protocol, which has led to the launch of the Saga Mobile Phone.\n\nObvious similarity\n\nWith the diversity in their ecosystem that makes them different, the duo of Solana and Ethereum are powered via the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model. Solana was designed as a PoS protocol from the start, but Ethereum transitioned to this new model from proof of work (PoW) through the Merge as the call for scalability and sustainability takes shape."

If a cryptocurrency is labeled a security, it falls under a different regulatory framework, potentially limiting its market reach and disrupting its trading on many exchanges. This development has put pressure on Solana, which is currently under investigation by authorities for its possible classification as a security.\n\nMoreover, Solana has also been grappling with recovery after the FTX crash. While it managed to bounce back, the road to recovery has been steep and complicated by regulatory issues.\n\nButerin's empathetic sentiment sheds light on the challenges faced by the whole blockchain ecosystem. Instead of seeing this as a competitive struggle between Ethereum and other projects, he views the real competition as the expanding centralized world imposing itself on the blockchain and crypto space.\n\nIn his post, Buterin implied that Ethereum's victory would not be meaningful if it came at the expense of other projects getting kicked off exchanges due to regulatory pressures. He suggests that the entire industry should stand together to face the threats posed by the growing centralized world."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nPolygon Labs is moving ahead with plans to reinvent its entire architecture as part of its goal to become the \"value layer of the Internet.\"\n\nPolygon 2.0 will have a fundamentally different architecture that makes it easier and more seamless to spin up new chains in the Polygon ecosystem. Polygon itself is an Ethereum layer two. It was designed to address some of Ethereum's limitations through a sidechain solution.\n\nAs its upgrade seeks to make it easier to create new Polygon chains, it will also feature a shared bridge to improve interoperability between those chains and eliminate the need for wrapped tokens. A wrapped token, like Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), allows users to move assets off their native blockchain. In this case, WBTC allows users to move their Bitcoin onto the Ethereum and Tron networks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe way that\u2019ll work on Polygon 2.0, native Ethereum tokens will be deposited into a single contract on Ethereum mainnet. When a user wants to use their tokens across different Polygon chains, the corresponding assets will be mapped to the tokens deposited on Ethereum, which Polygon says will eliminate the need for wrapping them and improve user experience.\n\n\u201cThe coordination layer allows us to optimistically confirm cross-chain transactions in a way that\u2019s safe and nearly instant,\u201d said Polygon co-founder Brendan Farmer. \u201cIt\u2019s the first multi-chain design that will truly deliver unified liquidity.\"\n\nAs a further step, Polygon says it will integrate zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs as part of the system to improve. When using online services, for example to make a payment, personal identifying information like names or birth dates are required to access them. Using a ZK proof, a party must prove they know what is in a transaction without revealing the known information directly in order for it to be verified.\n\nIn the new system, both the original Polygon network and the new one will rely on ZK proofs that will store the validated transactions on the L1, and the actual transaction data on the L2 that will be added. Together, they will lower costs and improve privacy for Polygon users.\n\nPolygon co-founder Mihailo Bjelic said that the vision behind the upgrades is to fill in \"the missing piece of an Internet\" and contribute to a \"digital economy that serves everyone.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"The vision for Polygon 2.0 is to create the Value Layer of the Internet,\" Bjelic said in a press release. \"In the same way that the Internet allows anyone to create and exchange information, the Value Layer will allow anyone to create, exchange, and program value.\u201d\n\nThese changes echo in part suggestions from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin earlier in June. In a post titled \u2018The Three Transitions\u2019, Buterin said Ethereum's future would hinge on adaptations to greater privacy, increased use of L2 scaling solutions, and a move to smart contract wallets. Polygon 2.0 utilizes at least two of these elements."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAs Coinbase\u2019s Ethereum layer-2 network Base draws closer to a mainnet launch, the cryptocurrency exchange said Wednesday its technology has been extensively vetted by security researchers.\n\nMore than 100 people recently pored over the network\u2019s code as part of an audit contest, Coinbase said in a blog post. And across various parts of the network\u2019s architecture, experts couldn\u2019t find any major flaws.\n\n\u201cThe more eyes we can get on a codebase, the better,\u201d Coinbase said. \u201cWe [...] are happy to report there were no significant vulnerabilities discovered.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe contest conducted through Code4rena spanned 14 days and tasked people with looking for weak points in the network\u2019s smart contracts, bridges, and other areas. $100,000 in stablecoin USDC was ultimately up for grabs in awards, which no one appears to have won, based on Code4rena\u2019s page for Base that show no results.\n\nCoinbase said that engagement with its audit contest for Base was high, and the exchange is still sorting through all the submissions it received, working to address \u201cinformative or minor issues\u201d that were brought to light.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s layer-2 network is being constructed in collaboration with Optimism, known for its use of Optimistic Rollups to help scale Ethereum. Base uses Optimism\u2019s OP Stack, and its mainnet launch is expected to come sometime in 2023.\n\nLayer-2 solutions are designed to make transactions on networks like Ethereum cheaper and more efficient by processing transactions in a different space and then relaying results back to their respective network.\n\nThe latest round of critical eyes assessing Base\u2019s robustness follows security audits from Spearbit and Sherlock, Coinbase notes, adding that Coinbase\u2019s Protocol Security team has already vetted those findings.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOther measures are being developed to ensure Base\u2019s security, Coinbase said, such as a tool that lets developers scan smart contacts for flaws and another that will monitor Base\u2019s network for irregularities called Pessimism.\n\nAs Coinbase looks to diversify its revenue beyond a reliance on trading fees that come from customer trades, it has leaned into subscriptions and services, such as staking. In March, the company announced \u201cWallet as a Service,\u201d expected to dovetail with Base as a way for firms to add digital wallets to their apps.\n\nWhen Base was announced in February, Coinbase said the network will be home to its future on-chain products. It also expressed hopes that Base will also become a popular ecosystem among developers, courting projects to the emerging layer-2 network."

        "content": "Layer3\n\nSan Jose, CA, June 30, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In the last few years of blockchain development, the Layer paradigm has been changing from Layer 0 to Layer 3. Not long ago, Ethereum founder VitalikButerin stressed the significance of Layer 3, saying that the architecture can optimize and improve the network. The heavy-hitting Layer 3 super public chain will link every blockchain to build a truly open, transparent, inclusive, fast and secure decentralized world.\n\n\n\n\u25ce The congestion problem under the Ethereum boom needs to be solved\n\nAs the most mainstream smart contract platform, Ethereum is known for its security and decentralized characteristics, but it still lags behind in terms of scalability: Ethereum's current TPS (the number of transactions that can be processed per second) is between 10 and 15, and the supply is insufficient and the demand is strong, resulting in high fees determined by bidding, and each transaction needs to spend several dollars to tens of dollars.\n\n\n\n\u5fae\u4fe1\u56fe\u7247_20230628162753\n\nIn other words, on the first layer of the Ethereum blockchain, the growing demand for network usage has led to network congestion and pushed up transaction costs.Increased storage, network speed, and throughput are fundamental to meaningful mass adoption of Ethereum. Decentralization, Security, Scalability, the three can only choose two, which is also known as the blockchain impossible triangle. Ethereum's initial choice was to abandon scalability and bring it into line with the most important values of Web3.0. But if you implement scalability in a clean and crude way, you sacrifice security or decentralization! In this context, the congestion problem under the Ethereum boom needs to be solved.\n\n\n\n\u25ceLayer 3 brings the perfect solution for Ethereum cross-chain scaling\n\nThe congestion problem of the Ethereum boom caught the world's attention, and Scaling was the solution - and that's where Layer 3 came into being. Layer 3 has been actively looking for Ethereum scalability solutions, and after the full research and development of the technical team, it has determined the cross-chain expansion route combining on-chain and off-chain expansion. Layer 3 combines cross-chain technology with Layer 1 and Layer 2 expansion solutions to bring a new chain expansion solution, support cross-chain interaction between major public chains, complete block transactions faster with lower GAS fees, and bring users a silky transaction experience.\n\n\n\nLayer 3, as an Ethereum expansion solution, aims to solve the congestion problem of Ethereum and realize the decentralized, low-cost and high-concurrency Ethereum ecosystem that people yearn for. It can be said that Layer 3 public chains start from the underlying algorithms and consensus protocols to help different public chains connect with each other and exchange value. Layer 3 public chain From the architecture design, to ensure that every public chain, even if there is no first-mover advantage, can be mirrored on the Layer 3 public chain, so that thousands of people understand and use.\n\n\n\nThe Layer 3 public chain's original series of core technologies build a cross-chain ecosystem integrating public chain, wallet, decentralized transaction, decentralized application and other layers to serve finance, artificial intelligence, metauniverse and other fields.\n\n\n\nIn short, the Layer 3 super public chain brings a new paradigm of the digital economy.\n\n\n\nFrom the perspective of technical architecture, Layer 3, like Layer 2, also contains the application Layer, and Layer 3 has better cross-chain interoperability, which means that there will be a lot of use cases that can be migrated to Layer 3.\n\n\n\nIn addition, for those types of use cases that require greater transaction throughput support and strong demand for further reducing network use costs, such as decentralized exchanges and blockchain games, transaction efficiency can also be improved on Layer 3 and real cost reduction and efficiency can be experienced.\n\n\n\nLayer 3's Ethereum cross-chain scaling solution has been tested to be the most secure and widely used scaling solution. The Layer 3 super public chain will truly link every blockchain and build an open, transparent, inclusive, fast and secure decentralized world.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompany\uff1aLayer Three Expansion Technology Inc\n\nWebsite:https://www.layer3.team\n\nTwitter\uff1ahttps://twitter.com/eth_layer_3\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, or intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Cancun Upgrade: ETH price to Reach $3000 soon? - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is preparing for a significant upgrade known as Cancun-Deneb (Dencun). This upgrade is expected to enhance the scalability, security, and usability of the Ethereum network. With these improvements on the horizon, many are speculating whether this could be the catalyst that propels Ethereum\u2019s price to the $3,000 mark.Let\u2019s take a look a this Ethereum Cancun upgrade.\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun Upgrade: What to Expect\n\nThe Cancun upgrade follows the recent activation of Shanghai, another significant upgrade to Ethereum\u2019s execution layer. The Cancun fork includes the highly anticipated Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, also known as \u201cProto-Danksharding.\u201d This feature is a milestone that lays the groundwork for full Danksharding implementation, which is expected to significantly enhance the network\u2019s scalability.\n\nThe Importance of Proto-Danksharding\n\nEthereum core developer P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi has emphasized the importance of Proto-Danksharding, stating that it should be the primary focus of the upgrade. Proto-Danksharding will act as an intermediate upgrade to help scale rollups on the network, a crucial step towards improving Ethereum\u2019s scalability and transaction speed.\n\nOther Key Features of the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun upgrade may also include several other Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), such as EIPs 4758, 6046, 6190, which involve the removal of the SELFDESTRUCT function, and EIP-663, which allows for unlimited SWAP and DUP instructions. Other potential features include EIP-5920, the PAY opcode, and EIP-1153, which introduces transient storage.\n\nUnderstanding Danksharding\n\nDanksharding is the third and final part of the ETH2/Serenity upgrade, following the successful rollout of the Beacon chain and The Merge. This new sharding architecture will replace the project\u2019s initially proposed idea of introducing 64 shard chains. Instead of increasing the number of transactions, Danksharding focuses on increasing data availability for rollups, a Layer 2 technology that bundles together blockchain transactions and processes them off-chain.\n\nThe Role of Proto-Danksharding\n\nProto-Danksharding, proposed by Ethereum developers Protolambda and Dankrad Feist, is an interim upgrade to the Ethereum network. It is described as a \u201cstopgap\u201d solution that will dramatically reduce rollup gas fees ahead of full sharding implementation. This feature introduces a transaction type called \u201cblob-carrying transactions,\u201d which can contain up to two blobs and will be more cost-effective than the current transaction data storage method.\n\nThe Impact of the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade\n\nThe Cancun upgrade aims to prepare the network for full data sharding while scaling rollups in the interim. The introduction of blob-carrying transactions will increase data availability for rollups and make them considerably cheaper. After the activation of Cancun, Ethereum users should expect faster, cheaper payments when using the ecosystem\u2019s native cryptocurrency, applications, and ERC-based tokens.\n\nCan Ethereum Reach $3,000?\n\nETH/USD Weekly- TradingView\n\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to predict with certainty, the Cancun upgrade could potentially be a significant catalyst for Ethereum\u2019s price. By enhancing the network\u2019s scalability, security, and usability, the upgrade could attract more users and developers to the Ethereum ecosystem, thereby increasing demand for ETH and potentially driving its price towards the $3,000 mark. However, as with all investments, it\u2019s essential to do your research and consider the risks before making any decisions.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Path to $3,000: A Predictive Analysis\n\nAs of today, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $1,855.58. To reach the $3,000 mark, it would need to increase by approximately 62%. This is a significant leap, but not an impossible one, especially when considering the potential impact of the upcoming Cancun upgrade.\n\nHistorically, major network upgrades have often led to increased demand for cryptocurrencies. For instance, Ethereum\u2019s price increased by about 60% in the two months leading up to the launch of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s Beacon Chain in December 2020. If the Cancun upgrade has a similar effect, it could potentially push Ethereum\u2019s price towards the $3,000 mark.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s increasing adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) could also contribute to price growth. As more users and developers flock to the Ethereum network to take advantage of these innovations, demand for ETH could increase, driving up its price.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum (ETH) is priced at $1,855.58. For Ethereum to reach the $3,000 mark from its current price, we need to calculate the percentage growth required.\n\nThe formula to calculate percentage growth is:\n\n((Target Price \u2013 Current Price) / Current Price) * 100\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n\n((3000 \u2013 1855.58) / 1855.58) * 100\n\nThis calculation results in a required growth of approximately 61.7%.\n\nIn simpler terms, Ethereum\u2019s current price needs to increase by about 61.7% to reach the $3,000 mark. This is a significant increase, but it\u2019s not unprecedented in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nFor instance, if we consider Ethereum\u2019s performance in 2021, it has shown periods of rapid growth. From January 2021 to May 2021, Ethereum\u2019s price increased from around $730 to a peak of over $4,000, representing a growth of over 450%.\n\nWhile past performance is not a guarantee of future results, it does illustrate Ethereum\u2019s potential for rapid price increases. With the upcoming Cancun upgrade and the continued growth of applications like DeFi and NFTs on the Ethereum network, a 61.7% increase to reach the $3,000 mark is within the realm of possibility. However, investors should always consider the inherent risks and volatility associated with cryptocurrency investments.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is important to note that this is a predictive analysis and not a guarantee. Cryptocurrency prices are influenced by a wide range of factors, including market sentiment, regulatory news, and broader economic trends. As such, while the $3,000 target is achievable, it\u2019s essential for investors to do their own research and consider the risks before making any decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

The ratio will be calculated as the final settlement price of ETH divided by BTC and will always be positive across all contract months.\n\n\"Historically, Ether and Bitcoin have been highly correlated; however, as the two assets have grown over time, market dynamics may affect the performance of one more than the other, creating relative value trading opportunities,\" CME Group Global Head of Cryptocurrency Products Giovanni Vicioso said in a statement.\n\nEfficiently capture the relative value of ether and bitcoin in a single trade with Ether/Bitcoin Ratio futures, launching July 31. https://t.co/WDFhIt5rJ7 \u2014 CME Group (@CMEGroup) June 29, 2023\n\nA ratio futures contract is a type of financial derivative that allows investors to speculate on or hedge against the relative performance of two underlying assets. The contract sets a predetermined ratio between the two assets and allows traders to take positions based on their expectations of how the ratio will change in the future. The two assets can be related or unrelated, such as stocks, commodities, or indices.\n\nAccording to Vicioso, the ETH/BTC ratio futures will enable investors to capture the crypto industry\u2019s two largest assets \u201cin a single trade, without needing to take a directional view.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis new contract will help create opportunities for a broad array of clients looking to hedge positions or execute other trading strategies, all in an efficient, cost-effective manner,\" added Vicioso.\n\nStory continues\n\nCME\u2019s foray into crypto\n\nCME introduced its first Bitcoin futures contract in December 2017 amid the strong bull run that took the price of the leading cryptocurrency from $1,000 at the start of the year to above 20,000 before Christmas. The move was significant for the cryptocurrency market as it provided institutional investors with a regulated platform to trade Bitcoin futures, allowing for greater mainstream adoption and potentially increased liquidity in the market.\n\nThe launch of Bitcoin futures on CME was, however, attributed to the consequent market slump though, although Tim McCourt, Global Head of Equity and FX Products at CME Group, dismissed such speculations.\n\nCME executive: Bitcoin futures did not tank market in 2017\n\nThe launch of Ethereum futures trading on CME followed in February 2021, which made it easier for institutional investors to gain exposure to the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nThe exchange saw over 151,000 Bitcoin, or $4.67 billion in current prices, allocated in Bitcoin futures contracts in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinGlass.\n\nEthereum futures at CME saw 226,000 ETH, or $429.2 million, over the span.\n\nOver the past several years, the CME Group also expanded its digital asset offerings to both Bitcoin and Ethereum options, as well as for micro BTC and micro ETH futures contracts."

        "title": "Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: BTC edges closer to recovery after sweeping Monday's low - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price attempts to overcome the $30,711 hurdle after a 26% run-up.\n\nEthereum price looks primed for a breakout that could trigger a minimum rally of 21% to $2,439.\n\nRipple price continues to bounce between the $0.548 and $0.413 barriers, awaiting a breakout.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price seems to be edging closer to ending its ongoing sideways movement. This development comes after BTC swept this week's lows, suggesting that a potential rally in the opposite direction is likely not just for the big crypto but also for Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP) and other altcoins.\n\nBitcoin price at inflection point\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price remains still after its 26% ascent since June 15. After its recent uptick, BTC has set up a new high at $31,430 after taking out the previous local top at $30,968. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has flipped above the mean line at 50, and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) has produced a green histogram bar above the zero line. This development is a clear sign that bullish momentum is on the rise.\n\nTherefore, a decisive three-day candlestick close above the Momentum Reversal Indicator\u2019s (MRI) State Trend Resistance level at $30,711 will be a buy signal. A move after this flip will allow Bitcoin price to target the weekly Bearish Breaker\u2019s midpoint at $35,260.\n\nAlthough unlikely, if the bullish momentum continues to remain dominant, Bitcoin price could attempt a retest of the Bearish Breaker\u2019s upper limit at $41,273.\n\nBTC/USDT 3-day chart\n\nAdditionally, the lower timeframe chart, as seen below, shows a much more nuanced outlook for Bitcoin price. On June 28, BTC swept Monday''s low at $29,890. The intention of this move was to collect the sell-side liquidity, which often signals a move in the opposite direction. Therefore, the next short-term target for Bitcoin price could be the equal highs at $31,050 followed by the June 23 swing high at $31,500.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nThe bullish outlook for Bitcoin price makes sense considering the momentum indicators, but investors need to take a closer look at the RSI. While BTC has produced three higher highs since January, RSI has produced three lower highs. This setup is termed \u201cbearish divergence\u201d and often results in correction of the underlying asset.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin holds above $30k as investors await historically strong July, eye options expiry\n\nEthereum price awaits buy signal\n\nEthereum (ETH) price looks extremely promising, not just from a technical point of view, but the indicators are also suggesting a bullish outlook. Between May 31, 2022, and June 28, 2023, ETH has set up an ascending triangle with roughly three equal highs and four higher lows.\n\nThis technical formation forecasts a 45% ascent to $2,915 upon the breakout of the $1,865 hurdle. The theoretical target is obtained by measuring the distance between the first swing high and swing low and adding it to the breakout point of the $1,865 resistance level.\n\nTherefore, Ethereum price needs to produce a decisive flip of the aforementioned barrier to kickstart this massive bullish move.\n\nSupporting this outlook are the RSI and AO indicators, both of which have moved above their respective mean lines - 50 and 0. This development signals a shift in momentum favoring the bulls. Furthermore, the Wave Trend indicator has produced a bullish crossover just above the oversold zone, adding credence to the bullish thesis.\n\nTherefore, investors need to be patient as this is a long-term outlook that will take quite a while to play out.\n\nETH/USDT 3-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum price produces a decisive three-day candlestick close below $1,639, it will invalidate the ascending triangle\u2019s bullish thesis. A further spike in selling pressure could trigger a near 15% descent to $1,408.\n\nRipple price needs clarity\n\nRipple (XRP) price has been stuck trading between the $0.548 and $0.413 barriers since March 26. A decisive flip of the upper limit at $0.548 into a support floor would be a clear buy signal. In such a case, XRP could trigger a 40% ascent to $0.778, which is the target of the potential double bottom pattern, as shown in the chart below.\n\nInterestingly, the aforementioned Ripple price target also coincides with MRI\u2019s State Trend Resistance level, making it a key level to book profits.\n\nXRP/USDT 3-day chart\n\nWhile it is assumed that a breakout of $0.548 would lead to a Ripple price rally, investors need to take another look at the indicators. The RSI and AO indicators have produced clear lower lows, while the XRP price has produced equal highs. Such a setup is termed \u201cexaggerated bearish divergence,\u201d and it often leads to a steep correction for the underlying asset.\n\nThe Wave Trend indicator has also signaled a bearish divergence, aligning with the overall bearish outlook. Therefore, a pullback that breaks below the $0.413 support level will invalidate the bullish thesis. Such a move could result in a 17% correction to the next State Trend Support level at $0.334.\n\nAlso read: New evidence suggests SEC's common enterprise claim against Ripple doesn't hold, John Deaton says"

        "title": "Exclusive: Fxhash 2.0 Debuts Ethereum Integration and On-Chain Minting - nft now",
        "content": "Over the past few years, fxhash has solidified itself as a premiere, community-focused, and accessible platform for generative art. A longtime major facet of the Tezos NFT ecosystem, the platform is now seeking to double down on its mission to enhance and untether the creative potential of artists in the generative NFT space with an ambitious expansion.\n\nWith its forthcoming update, dubbed fxhash 2.0, the platform aims to bridge the gap between Tezos and Ethereum, fostering an environment that promotes the unique creative freedom of its users. This ETH integration is expected to expand the platform\u2019s capabilities, allowing for both minting and collecting unique generative artworks on both Tezos and Ethereum directly from within the fxhash ecosystem.\n\nFxhash 2.0\n\nBorn in 2021, fxhash easily carved a niche for itself as an open ecosystem for generative art, encouraging artists to mint their innovative creations without the barriers typical of curated platforms. The result has been a bustling, diverse marketplace boasting over two million unique pieces of art since its inception.\n\nWith its 2.0 upgrade, fxhash breaks new ground by integrating Ethereum, widely known as the leading blockchain network. Notably, this update responds to the fxhash community\u2019s feedback, showcasing the platform\u2019s commitment to user needs. With a dual-blockchain approach, artists and collectors can choose between Tezos and Ethereum depending on their unique needs, enhancing the creative and collecting experience.\n\nCredit: fxhash\n\nBeyond blockchain expansion efforts, the update also introduces fully on-chain minting on both Ethereum and Tezos, ensuring artists have expanded options and tools for immortalizing their works fully on-chain. According to a press release shared exclusively with nft now, this feature reflects fxhash\u2019s primary mission to empower its global community of artists to \u201cearn a living from their digital works of art, independent of their location on the planet.\u201d\n\nFxhash 2.0 features\n\nTo this end, previously established features like fx(params), redeemables, and third-party integration tools that are already on fxhash will now be compatible with Ethereum from day one of the fxhash 2.0 launch. Thus, the platform ensures a seamless transition for artists accustomed to the existing tools while expanding their potential reach.\n\nfxhash 2.0\n\n\u2014 a multichain future\n\n\n\nToday, we're super excited to share some major news with you! We've started working on a significant platform expansion built around integrating Ethereum & on-chain minting.\n\n\n\nLet's talk about what the fxhash 2.0 future looks like \ud83d\ude0e\u2b07\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/00z8qErpCD \u2014 fxhash (@fx_hash_) June 29, 2023\n\nFor the developers working on the 2.0 release, maintaining a unified front for showcasing generative art remains a key principle, regardless of the blockchain used for minting. This is evidenced by the fact that artworks will continue to be displayed together, with the focus being on the art and artist rather than the blockchain. As far as the marketplace aspect is concerned, pieces and collections will simply be denominated in either XTZ or ETH.\n\nBy adopting a multichain approach, fxhash 2.0 seems ready to punch above its weight, offering a seamless movement between Ethereum and Tezos that we have yet to see perfected by any single marketplace. Surely the integration will provide artists with exposure to different audiences and extend the reach of their generative projects. At the time of writing, the release of fxhash 2.0 is slated for late 2023 and promises to bring a series of URL and IRL events celebrating this milestone.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This article was written by an nft now staff member in collaboration with OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4."

        "content": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) recently received an influential exchange listing and a network upgrade, which triggered sudden investor interest in the token. On the other hand, Ethereum (ETH) whales have continued buying, with their holdings striking a new all-time high.\n\nMeanwhile, VC Spectra (SPCT) recently launched its initial public presale and is poised to skyrocket 10x of its current value. The platform has captivated investors with its unraveled precision in identifying profitable projects.\n\nBUY SPECTRA TOKENS NOW\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) Soars High as Global Adoption Skyrockets\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) has skyrocketed by 5.08% to $231.99 in the past 24 hours. With the Bitcoin offshoot platform experiencing increased adoption, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has attracted massive investor sentiment. Recent data shows that the number of unsettled futures or open interest soared to over $400 million earlier in the week from $75 million the previous week.\n\nMost of this trading interest emerged from Binance, where traders launched $240 million worth of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) on short or long positions. Furthermore, increasing open interest indicates new money flowing into the market as participants increase their allocation.\n\nDespite Bitcoin Cash\u2019s (BCH) improved performance, investors remain cautious as they seek to speculate and mine on digital assets. Recent reports show that Bitcoin Cash (BCH) registered a mining difficulty of approximately 369.96 (G) and a total hash rate of around 3.9 (EH/S).

According to the analyst, if Ethereum (ETH) overcomes that resistance zone, its price will skyrocket to $2,750.\n\nMeanwhile, stacked ETH has outpaced the Ethereum (ETH) balance on centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. Data from June 26, 2023, suggests 23.36 million ETH (approximately $44 billion) has been staked, accounting for 19.4% of the existing supply. Similarly, Ethereum (ETH) held by centralized exchanges fell to 23.35 million ETH on the same day.\n\nAccording to available data, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) holdings of centralized exchanges have been reduced by 5 million ETH after the Shapella upgrade.\n\nEthereum (ETH) trades at $1,882.79, representing a 0.16% surge in the past 24 hours. Moreover, as mentioned, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) value is projected to surge to $2,750 in the coming months.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) Projected to Surge Before Its Presale Ends\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) is a decentralized hedge fund driving innovation in the cryptocurrency world. It offers its users quarterly dividends and buybacks from the earnings it gains from investments.

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Drops Due Whale Selling, Key Levels To Watch - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, experienced a price drop of over 3% within the last 24 hours. The reason is presumably a significant sell-off carried out by a prominent whale. The whale deposited 25,000 ETH (worth around $47.24 million) on Binance, only to withdraw a significant amount of USDT shortly afterwards.\n\nAs the on-chain data provider Lookonchain reports, the whale has probably already sold a part of his ETH. According to the on-chain data, the whale withdrew 16 million in USDT. \u201cThe drop in ETH price [a few hours] ago was most likely due to the sell-off of this whale,\u201d the analysts note, further explaining that the whale still owns around 8,000 ETH ($14.7 million) unsold.\n\nNevertheless, ETH bulls continue to show strength. A look at the 1-hour chart of Ethereum reveals that the price has formed a bull flag. In technical analysis, a flag is a short-term consolidation pattern that occurs after a strong price move and indicates a temporary break in the trend.\n\nA bullish flag forms during an uptrend with the flagpole pointing upwards, followed by a consolidation phase before a possible continuation of the upward movement. For now, the pattern has held, ETH has bounced up from the 4H 200 EMA at $1,825. In this respect, the bulls remain in control (despite the whale) for the time being.\n\nBasically, two scenarios are conceivable. If the aforementioned support levels are broken to the downside, especially the underside of the flag, Ethereum could face a further price decline towards $1,750. Conversely, a breakout from the flag pattern to the upside (around $1,900) could trigger a price rise towards $2,000.\n\nHowever, according to analyst Ali Martinez, that\u2019s where the price will hit Ethereum\u2019s key supply wall, which is in the $2,000 to $2,060 range, where 832,640 addresses have bought over 26 million ETH. \u201cIf ETH can break through this resistance barrier, we can expect an upswing to $2,330 or even $2,750,\u201d Martinez believes.\n\nEthereum Options Expiry On Friday Confirms Outlook\n\nThe most important event this week for Bitcoin, Ethereum and the entire crypto market will be the expiration of over $7 billion in options tomorrow, Friday, June 30. The current options volume on the largest exchange Deribit is 14,107 calls, 9,445 puts and a put-call ratio of 0.67 for Bitcoin. For Ethereum, there are currently 76,776 calls, 39,779 puts and a put-call ratio of 0.52.\n\nA put-call ratio below 1 typically means that the number of call options is higher than the number of put options, which indicates a more bullish market sentiment. In this case, the put-call ratio for ETH is 0.52, which means that there are more call options compared to put options. Thus, the ratio indicates that market participants are more prone to bullish bets on the ETH price.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

This novel type of contract will enable individuals to invest simultaneously in bitcoin and ether, thereby streamlining the investment process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA futures contract, for those who may not know, is an agreement to buy or sell a particular asset at a predetermined price at a specific time in the future. It's essentially a bet on the future price of an asset. Traders can either go long, predicting the price will rise, or go short, predicting the price will fall.\n\nThe Ether/Bitcoin Ratio futures will be paid in cash based on the final prices of Ether and Bitcoin. This innovative product is aimed at unlocking opportunities for a broader clientele to hedge positions and implement various trading strategies in an economical way.\n\nCME Group has consistently broadened its cryptocurrency-related product offerings. In 2017, it unveiled plans to launch Bitcoin Futures in the fourth quarter, marking a pivotal moment in the mainstream financial world's acceptance of cryptocurrencies. However, this announcement was not without controversy.\n\nCritics argued that the introduction of Bitcoin futures would lead to increased market manipulation and volatility. Despite these concerns, the CME proceeded with the launch, and over time, these futures have become an essential tool for institutional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin.\n\nIn February 2021, the company launched Ether futures, further expanding its suite of crypto derivative products. Later in the same year, Micro Bitcoin futures and Micro Ether futures were launched, offering investors another way to gain exposure to these digital assets but with a smaller capital requirement. Additionally, CME Group incorporated Bitcoin Euro and Ether Euro futures into its portfolio in August."

        "content": "This year, Cardano has made significant strides regarding development.\n\nThe network\u2019s advancements are translating into real-world adoption.\n\nVodafone has sparked excitement by choosing Cardano over the competition.\n\nDespite recent regulatory troubles in the United States, Cardano has had a great year in network development, with upgrades ranging from node updates to governance and scalability.\n\nAs the network continues to evolve, it is beginning to attract greater real-world adoption and edge out competitors in some cases. In the latest instance, Vodafone, one of the world\u2019s largest telecommunications companies, has revealed that it will launch an NFT collection on the Cardano network, snubbing other popular NFT venues like Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana.\n\nVodafone Chooses Cardano\n\nOn Tuesday, June 27, Vodafone\u2019s German Customer Service Twitter account stirred up excitement within the Cardano community with a tweet hinting at the launch of an NFT collection on the Cardano network.\n\nAmidst the speculation that followed the cryptic tweet, NMKR founder Patrick Tobler has confirmed that the German arm of the telecommunications giant would be launching an NFT collection on the Cardano network in a tweet on Wednesday, June 28. The mint will notably take place on the prominent NFT marketplace.\n\nIn conversation with DailyCoin, however, Vodafone insisted that it was still testing the waters and was yet to fully commit to launching an NFT collection.\n\nStill, Vodafone hailed Cardano for its vibrant community, sustainability, and cross-chain capabilities in a message to community members on the project\u2019s Discord server.\n\n\"The reason we chose this particular chain comes down to community, sustainability as well as cross-chain possibilities. We are still in the early stages of this project, so everyone who is here now is already a super early supporter and we appreciate that,\" the message read.\n\nVodafone has notably emphasized that any planned NFT collection would focus on \u201creal utility and benefits for Vodafone customers.\u201d Still, the firm maintained that it was yet to decide what these benefits would be and was open to suggestions from community members.\n\nThe team noted that it could only guarantee direct benefits to German customers but was exploring avenues to include the international community.\n\nThe recent development has unsurprisingly sparked excitement within the Cardano community.\n\nCardano Community Excited\n\nProminent Cardano community influencer Chris O hailed the NMKR team for their effort, highlighting that Vodafone Germany had about 31 million customers and 40% of the market share.\n\n#Cardano, Amazing work by @Padierfind & @nmkr_io team! @vodafone_de will be launching a utility NFT for their German customers in the near term.

Vodafone auctioned its first-ever SMS for $121,000 worth of ETH in December 2021.\n\nVodafone Germany did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nIt is not immediately clear what the NFT project will focus on.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nVodafone choosing the Cardano network for its NFT launch over competitors like Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana suggests that institutions are beginning to recognize its potential for real-world adoption.\n\nRead this to learn more about one of the Cardano network\u2019s most recent upgrades:\n\nHow Cardano Improves Node Performance in New Update\n\nCoinbase wants the SEC case thrown out.

        "content": "Despite belonging to the same industry, the various networks in the crypto market often engage in conflicts. Ethereum [ETH], in particular, has faced criticism and backlash for its transition to the proof-of-stake [PoS] consensus mechanism. While Ethereum\u2019s staking mechanism has been successful, Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Cardano, took the opportunity to make a snide remark aimed at the second-largest cryptocurrency network.\n\nIn a tweet exchange, Charles Hoskinson called out Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum. This statement came in response to Buterin\u2019s comments about the challenges associated with staking Ether [ETH]. Buterin previously stated that only a small portion of his Ether is staked as it gets complicated. Buterin pointed out that staking Ethereum involves the need to make the associated keys public, which raises concerns about security. To address this, he suggested using multi-signature transactions. However, he admitted that setting them up can still be challenging.\n\nHoskinson emphasized that all of Cardano\u2019s native token ADA is staked. This statement implied that Cardano\u2019s proof-of-stake protocol is well-designed and functioning effectively. This was done by indirectly highlighting potential flaws in Ethereum\u2019s approach.\n\nI had to listen to this a few times. I'm just at a loss for words. All of our Ada is staked. Guess what that's how it's supposed to be for a properly designed Proof of Stake protocol. https://t.co/ye6va1DH06 June 29, 2023\n\nEthereum\u2019s deposit contract value hits all new high\n\nFollowing the implementation of the Shanghai upgrade, which introduced the ability to withdraw staked Ethereum, there has been a notable increase in the number of individuals opting to lock their coins in beacon deposit contracts. This surge in staked Ethereum is evident as the amount has rapidly grown and has set a new record since the update.\n\nThe number of Ethereum that has been staked has now surged to 25.8 million ETH, marking a new all-time high ATH. At present, this staked amount is valued at over $48 billion.\n\nAmidst this, Ethereum continued to struggle to hit $2,000. At press time, the second largest crypto asset was trading for $1,889.79 with a 2.66% daily surge."

        "content": "ETHBarcelona, the premier Ethereum conference in Spain, is scheduled to take place from July 5 to 9, 2023.

        "content": "Liquid Staking Tokens control 41% of staked ETH, raising concerns about dependency and leveraging risks.\n\nLido and Rocket Pool dominate, witnessing increased interest in stETH and rETH tokens.\n\nLiquid Staking Derivative protocols have been increasingly occupying the DeFi space, gradually becoming dominant players in the Ethereum[ETH] staking arena. As a result, the tokens associated with these protocols experienced a massive surge in interest and adoption.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nLSTs on the rise\n\nAccording to Kate Young Ju, an analyst on CryptoQuant, Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) have successfully utilized 41% of the total ETH staked in the ecosystem. This high level of utilization raises concerns, as it indicates a significant dependency on this particular form of staking.\n\nFurthermore, it was worth noting that these LSTs were leveraged by a factor of 2, introducing potential dangers and weaknesses to the ecosystem. Leveraging amplifies both gains and losses, making investments more volatile and susceptible to market fluctuations. This increased risk can pose challenges for participants involved in LSTs and may impact the stability and resilience of the ecosystem as a whole.\n\nAt press time, the largest players in this sector were Lido and Rocket Pool. The staked ETH tokens associated with both protocols, stETH and rETH respectively, witnessed a notable surge in interest and usage. This surge was evident from the growing number of token holders, indicating an increasing interest among various addresses.\n\nIn addition to the growing number of token holders, the velocity of these tokens also witnessed an uptick. This suggested that the frequency with which these tokens were being transferred and used also increased, reflecting a higher level of activity within the ecosystem.\n\nEthereum plays a big role\n\nHowever, it was essential to highlight that the growth of Liquid Staking Tokens was not solely driven by their own appeal, but also by the broader interest in the Ethereum protocol and ETH. Users are increasingly drawn to Ethereum, contributing to the rising traction and adoption of Liquid Staking Tokens.\n\nOver the past month, the revenue generated by validators witnessed a significant decrease of 62.07%. Despite a decline in revenue for validators on the Ethereum network, the number of validators experienced a notable surge of 7.65% in the last 30 days, reaching a count of 637,732 according to Staking Rewards\u2019 data. This sustained interest in staking remains intact, even in the face of falling revenue.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nAs for the price of Ethereum, it was trading at $1,855.10 at press time according to CoinMarketCap\u2019s data. It experienced a slight decline of 0.2% in the last 24 hours. Additionally, its trading volume decreased by 28.20% during the same period."

        "title": "Best NFT Wallets for 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "5 best NFT wallets\n\nHere are some of the top NFT wallets available right now.\n\n1. Metamask\n\nMetamask is one of the most popular cryptocurrency wallets. Its browser extension provides easy access to web3 sites such as NFT marketplaces with just a couple of clicks. Metamask also makes it easy to set up multiple addresses so you can hold your NFTs at an address that's separate from your cryptocurrency, or you can set up a single address for each NFT you purchase.\n\nConsenSys, the company behind Metamask, built a mobile application in 2020. Holdings sync flawlessly across the desktop and mobile versions of the wallet. The mobile application also includes a built-in browser for decentralized applications, or dApps, and NFT marketplaces.\n\nIf you need to swap currencies to buy an NFT, Metamask has a built-in swap feature. You can also limit how much you pay in gas fees, though there's the risk of a transaction failing. If you need to use a different blockchain, Metamask offers support for alternative platforms.\n\n2. MathWallet\n\nMathWallet offers a strong alternative to Metamask. Its biggest differentiator is that it supports more than 150 blockchains. It offers a web, desktop, and mobile version of the wallet that sync across devices, and it has integrations with several hardware wallets as well. Math Wallet will also let you create multiple addresses.\n\nMath Wallet has a dApp browser built in that enables users to view NFT marketplaces. It includes several other features for cryptocurrency holders -- staking, swapping, etc. -- and it also offers its own utility token.\n\n3. AlphaWallet\n\nAlphaWallet is an open-source cryptocurrency wallet. While it has a few limitations -- it's mobile-only and Ethereum-only -- its native support for blockchain games and NFTs makes it stand out.\n\nThe simple user interface makes it very easy for beginners to understand. There's a whole section of the wallet dedicated to NFTs and gaming tokens. It also allows users to add meta tags to their tokens so they can easily search and filter them when browsing their collection.\n\nAlphaWallet works directly with OpenSea, CryptoKitties, Dragonereum, and ChainZ Arena, among other NFT marketplaces and blockchain games. Like others, it has a built-in dApp browser to find more NFT marketplaces and direct access to DeFi applications such as Compound.\n\n4. Coinbase Wallet\n\nMany people know Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) for its cryptocurrency exchange. It also offers a non-custodial wallet suitable for holding NFTs and other tokens. Unlike holding cryptocurrency on Coinbase's exchange, holding assets in the Coinbase Wallet gives the user full control over their crypto.\n\nCoinbase released a browser extension in 2021, making it easier for users to use their wallet across devices to purchase NFTs and use other dApps. Users can also access dApps through the built-in browser in the mobile wallet.\n\nOne unique advantage of Coinbase Wallet is the ease of transferring tokens to others by using usernames instead of public wallet addresses. It can make transactions feel more personal and provide a greater sense of security knowing that you're sending assets to the right person.\n\nCoinbase also offers a one-click cloud backup for your private keys, storing them on your personal cloud drive. That can help ensure that you don't lose access to your NFTs or other funds held in the wallet.\n\n5. Ledger NFT Wallet\n\nLedger is a hardware wallet -- a small piece of kit that's usually around the size of a USB. You can use it to keep your crypto assets offline in what's known as \"cold storage.\" Generally speaking, hardware wallets are more secure than hot wallets, which are connected to the internet. There are several hardware crypto wallets that work with NFTs, including Trezor. However, Ledger stands out because it connects to top NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea and Rarible.\n\nLedger has several different devices at different price points. Each of them support multiple cryptocurrencies as well as NFTs. You can connect all Ledger products to Windows and Mac systems. Be aware the Ledger Nano S Plus, which is the lowest cost option doesn't connect to iPhones or iPads. Ledger also suffered a security breach in 2020. While no crypto assets were lost, hackers accessed customer information and the company's reputation took a hit."

        "content": "The crypto market is filled with excitement as investors and industry insiders closely watch the movement of whales, those with significant crypto holdings, who have been making strategic bets on promising projects. InQubeta (QUBE) has emerged as a dark horse, captivating the attention of whales who are choosing it over established crypto giants like Ethereum (ETH) and Polygon (MATIC) to potentially make exponential gains in 2023.\n\nWe explore the reasons why whales are flocking to InQubeta, its unique features, and the potential for significant growth, positioning it as an enticing investment opportunity.\n\nInQubeta: Disrupting the AI Funding Landscape\n\nInQubeta is revolutionizing the AI funding landscape by providing an ecosystem that connects AI startups with investors. Here\u2019s why whales are favoring InQubeta over Ethereum and Polygon:\n\nInnovative Fractionalized NFTs: InQubeta introduces fractionalized non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that enable investors to participate in funding AI projects. By fractionalizing NFTs, investors can gain exposure to high-potential startups with a smaller investment, spreading their risk across multiple projects. This democratized approach to AI funding appeals to whales who seek diversification and the potential for substantial returns. QUBE Token: Utility and Governance: InQubeta\u2019s native token, QUBE, plays a crucial role within the ecosystem. It serves as both a utility token for accessing services and a governance token, allowing holders to participate in decision-making processes. Whales recognize the value of QUBE in driving the ecosystem\u2019s growth and actively seek to accumulate the token, driving up demand and potentially increasing its value over time. Experienced Team and Advisors: InQubeta boasts a team of experienced professionals with deep expertise in the AI and blockchain industries. Their knowledge and connections position InQubeta for success, attracting whales who recognize the importance of a strong team in executing the project\u2019s vision. Additionally, the project has secured influential advisors who provide guidance and open doors to potential partnerships, further bolstering its appeal to whales. Burn Mechanism and Scarcity: InQubeta has implemented a burn mechanism for QUBE tokens, gradually reducing the token supply over time. This burn strategy creates scarcity and potentially contributes to price appreciation, attracting whales who anticipate a limited supply and increased demand for QUBE tokens in the future.\n\nInQubeta vs. Ethereum and Polygon: Differentiating Factors\n\nWhile Ethereum and Polygon are established players in the crypto market, InQubeta offers unique differentiating factors that attract whales:\n\nNiche Focus on AI: InQubeta focuses specifically on the AI industry, catering to a niche market with immense potential for growth. Whales recognize the significance of AI advancements and the transformative impact it can have across various sectors. By betting on InQubeta, they position themselves at the forefront of this disruptive industry, potentially reaping significant rewards. Early-Stage Investment Opportunities: InQubeta\u2019s ecosystem provides whales with early-stage investment opportunities in AI startups. This allows them to get in on the ground floor of potentially groundbreaking projects, maximizing their potential returns. In contrast, Ethereum and Polygon, being more mature platforms, may offer fewer opportunities for early-stage investments. Ecosystem and Community Development: InQubeta fosters a vibrant ecosystem and community where startups, investors, and AI enthusiasts converge. This collaborative environment creates opportunities for networking, knowledge sharing, and potential partnerships. Whales recognize the value of being part of a thriving community and the potential for additional growth and opportunities that it brings.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith its innovative AI funding ecosystem, fractionalized NFTs, utility and governance token (QUBE), and experienced team, InQubeta presents a unique investment opportunity that appeals to whales seeking exponential gains in 2023. While Ethereum and Polygon have their own merits, InQubeta\u2019s niche focus, early-stage investment potential, and community-driven approach make it an enticing choice for whales looking to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on the transformative power of AI.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

Moreover, QUBE serves as a governance token, empowering holders to propose ideas, vote on proposals, and shape the project\u2019s future direction. This inclusive approach enhances community involvement and aligns the project with the interests of its stakeholders. Verified Security and Audit: QUBE has undergone comprehensive security audits and verifications by renowned platforms such as Block Audit and Hacken, ensuring the integrity and reliability of its smart contracts. These third-party audits give investors confidence in the project\u2019s security measures and help mitigate potential risks.\n\nParticipating in the InQubeta QUBE Presale: Inclusivity and Convenience\n\nParticipating in the QUBE presale is straightforward and accessible to a wide range of investors.

Similarly, the provider\u2019s ultra-long Nasdaq 100 hedge fund returned 42 per cent in the financial year to June 23, but was down 70.36 per cent over the 12 months to December 31.\n\nGlobal X Australia head of investment strategy Blair Hannon said there had been a \u201csubstantial\u201d change in market sentiment for mega-cap tech stocks in the United States between 2022 and 2023. \u201cYou would have to live under a rock to avoid being inundated with news on generative AI and many of the FANG+ names are at the forefront of this trend,\u201d he said.\n\nNvidia\u2019s position as one of the leading companies producing AI hardware, coupled with Google and Microsoft\u2019s decisions to implement AI into their search engines also boosted the ETF, Mr Hannon added.\n\nBetaShares\u2019 global robotics and AI ETF also returned 39.6 per cent in the 12 months to June 23, 2023, but, likewise, was down 38.31 per cent over 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLosers\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Global X\u2019s ultra-short Nasdaq 100 hedge fund, Betashares\u2019 crude oil, currency hedged synthetic ETF and the Global X physical palladium ETF were the worst performers, followed by BetaShares US equities currency hedged ETF.\n\nHowever, in 2022, Global X\u2019s ultra-short Nasdaq 100 fund, and Betashares\u2019 crude oil and US equities currency hedged ETFs were among the 10 products with the highest returns.\n\nMr Hannon said Global X\u2019s ultra-short Nasdaq ETF struggled simply because the Nasdaq itself was performing well.\n\n\u201cIt is actually performing exactly as it is designed to do. This does underscore the need for investors to understand how geared ETFs work, so they can use them effectively in a portfolio,\u201d he said.\n\nStockspot\u2019s Mr Brycki said the lesson for investors is to simply pay \u201cno attention\u201d to one-year returns, as they have no bearing on future performance, \u201cor even whether some products are investible\u201d.\n\n\u201cInstead investors should be focusing on the areas that they can control when investing: diversification, costs and their own behaviour.\u201d"

        "content": "After the successful deployment of the Shapella upgrade that enabled staking withdrawals, the Ethereum (ETH) development team is preparing for the launch of the Dencun upgrade, expected in late 2023, which promises to bring lots of new updates and could even lead to an ETH price hike.\n\nSpecifically, \u2018Dencun\u2019 is a joint term for two major Ethereum upgrades \u2013 Cancun, which is the upgrade to Ethereum\u2019s execution layer (EL), and Deneb, which refers to the consensus layer (CL) upgrade, as described in an article published by Ethereum-focused cryptocurrency market news site EtherWorld on June 24.\n\nAs it happens, the Cancun upgrade introduces several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) focused on improving storage, scalability, and optimizing gas efficiency, such as through the regulation of block rewards and delaying the gradual increase in Ethereum mining difficulty for a smooth transition to Ethereum 2.0.\n\nAt the same time, Deneb focuses on expanding the size and efficiency of the Ethereum blockchain, with one notable EIP that aims to upgrade its proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm toward increasing its power and improving user experience.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nWhile the Ethereum crypto community eagerly awaits this major overhaul, the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is currently $1,888.99, recording an increase of 1.13% in the last 24 hours, 0.49% across the previous seven days, and 1.19% in its monthly chart, as per data on June 30.\n\nETH 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nTaking into account all the advances and innovations that Dencun aims to unlock, the price of Ethereum could react to this major upgrade as it nears, as well as after the development team fully deploys it, particularly as the token continues to gain investors\u2019 confidence as a go-to asset for passive income.\n\nIndeed, taking into account the best-case scenario data from the historical Ethereum Rainbow price chart patterns, the price of ETH, as the end of the year nears, could actually skyrocket toward $5,000 and even end up in the zone of around $7,000. However, if a more bearish chart pattern reoccurs, then ETH could well remain in the $1,880 area.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "The Ethereum ecosystem had a positive run in the second quarter of 2023. From the Shapella upgrade in April to May\u2019s memecoin frenzy, there was a lot of buzz surrounding the most prominent smart contract blockchain.\n\nThis was reflected in the network\u2019s on-chain activity and gas fees. According to the quarterly report by blockchain analytics company IntoTheBlock, Ethereum recorded an 83% increase in network fees in the past three months.\n\nEthereum Network Fees Surge Due To Memecoin Frenzy\n\nThe network fee surge experienced by the Ethereum network has been linked to the rise of Ethereum-based memecoins in the Q2 of 2023. In the last few months, new memecoins, like APED, BOBO, PEPE, etc., have taken over the market, with some of these tokens recording huge gains.\n\nAccording to an IntoTheBlock report, speculative activity in the memecoin market is one of the major forces behind the elevated Ethereum network fees.\n\nThe impact of memecoins on Ethereum\u2019s network activity was so high that it caused a shift in the top gas-burning altcoins at some point in April. Meme tokens, such as TROLL, APED, and BOBO, were amongst the top 10 gas-burning altcoins, displacing popular assets, like ETH, Wrapped ETH (WETH), and USDT, from their positions, according to a Santiment analysis.\n\nInterestingly, Bitcoin also saw increased network fees in 2023\u2019s second quarter, resulting from creating tokens via the BRC-20 standard. IntoTheBlock\u2019s report revealed that Bitcoin fees increased by over 300% in the second quarter \u2013 the highest since Q2 2021.\n\nQuarterly Update: #Bitcoin transaction fees increased 4x compared to last quarter, marking the highest increase since Q2 2021. The surge is primarily driven by Ordinals-related activity.\n\nStay tuned, we\u2019ll share more updates on this past quarter in the coming days. pic.twitter.com/sUuilxWBNN \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) June 30, 2023\n\nIt is worth noting that the Ethereum network fees have cooled since the May highs, returning to a range of 15-20 Gwei in recent weeks.\n\nETH Supply Reached All-Time Low In May\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s network fees rose in May, the supply of Ether tanked, reaching its all-time low. According to IntoTheBlock\u2019s analysis, Ether\u2019s annualized net issuance rate dropped as low as 3.75% during the memecoin frenzy.\n\nFollowing the Merge last September, the amount of ETH issued per block dipped by 90%, making Ether more prone to deflation during fee spikes. Notably, the ETH supply trend has stabilized since the network fees dropped back into the normal range.\n\nSource: IntoTheBlock\n\nAccording to CoinGecko data, ETH trades at $1,935, gaining 4.6% in the past 24 hours. The token is the second-largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of roughly $233 billion.\n\nETHUSD trading at $1,922 | Source: ETHUSD chart from TradingView"

Source: CryptoRank\n\nNotably, the Ethereum deposit contract balance had crossed the value of $40 billion in late May, demonstrating a sharp move upward since the introduction of the critical feature that was not present during Ethereum\u2019s transition from the proof-of-work (PoW) to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism after the Merge upgrade.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum was at press time changing hands at the price of $1,885.63. This represents an increase of 2.08% in the last 24 hours, a 0.24% gain across the previous seven days, and an advance of 0.80% on its monthly chart, as per the latest information retrieved on June 30.\n\nEthereum 24-hour price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nRecently, the richest Ethereum non-exchange addresses have been growing their holdings while the top exchange addresses marked record lows, near genesis levels, illustrating fears of further lawsuits against crypto exchanges, as Finbold reported on June 27.\n\nIndeed, after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued crypto trading platforms Coinbase and Binance, fears seem to have caused an increase in the migration of digital assets off them, including the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset, Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

What Now?\n\nETH Bullish Prediction Playing Out Exactly! What Now? Watch this price prediction in the 4-hour timeframe\n\nThe Ethereum price has smashed through our $1,933 bullish target in the 4-hour timeframe and the price is still currently pushing up higher! This shows that the bulls are still in control of this market for now.\n\nHowever, the question most traders are asking is \u201cHow long will this current rally last and what should we expect next?\u201d\n\nWell in this ETH analysis, we will be identifying the Bearish Divergence that is right now developing in the 4-hour timeframe. This bearish divergence is a clear warning to our readers to be cautious as this might be a sign that ETH does not have a long way to go to the upside.\n\nWhat Does A Bearish Divergence Mean?\n\nThe image above is what a completed bearish divergence should look like!\n\nBearish Divergence shows weakness in price. The bearish divergence is caused when the price is moving higher while the MACD indicator keeps on moving lower. Once this happens, it signifies that the asset might be weak and ready to sell off.\n\nRight now, the Ethereum price is rallying higher, but the MACD indicator is showing a clear sign of a downtrend.\n\nThis tells us that \u201cwhile the price might be moving up, bullish volume is dying down\u201d and if this continues, sooner or later the ETH price will reverse.\n\nFinal Verdict!\n\nThe ETH price has broken out of the 4-hour timeframe converging Triangle pattern and is pushing higher! So for now we remain bullish on the Altcoin price.\n\nHowever, we are beginning to see signs of weakness creep into the price chart as Ethereum is diverging from the MACD indicator. This is a sign of growing weakness in the bullish rally and we will stay cautious as we continue to watch the ETH price action develop.\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nHow to Trade Bitcoin (BTC)?\n\nTo understand the basics of Bitcoin trading, you can read our How To Trade Bitcoin Guide.

        "title": "Ethereum Co-founder Joseph Lubin Says Eth Is a Commodity - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "In an interview, Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin argued that ETH is a commodity, even if Gensler may not admit it. The regulatory landscape in the United States mainly tries to redeem cryptocurrencies and tokens into security; the Securities and Exchange Commission chair, Gary Gensler, once needed to specify the ETH classification during a screening.\n\nEthereum is a Commodity, says Joe Lubin\n\nThe recently released Hinman documents, which is a 2018 speech given by former SEC commissioner Bill Hinman, has garnered a lot of attention. People working in the agency argued that this could create confusion that the SEC has agreed on classifying ETH as non-security.\n\nMoreover, Lubin feels that when Ethereum transitioned from energy intensive proof-of-work (PoW) consensus to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is crossed the border of being called a security. The Canadian-Amarican entrepreneur, contributed heavily towards development of the second most powerful blockchain ecosystem. He is also the founder of a Brooklyn-based software production studio, ConsenSys.\n\nThe main factor slowing regulatory authorities from bringing a comprehensive regulatory framework is the classification of digital assets. The tussle between the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC is far from over. If they are classified as commodities, they come under CFTC; if they are securities, they\u2019ll be governed by the SEC.\n\nThe upcoming two digital assets legislation would provide significant power to the CFTC. Slated to be voted on in early July 2023, it would place CFTC ahead of the financial watchdog SEC in the race to instil crypto regulations.\n\nPer the Howey test used to classify assets as securities, a security is any financial instrument associated with a kind of investment contract. On the other hand, a commodity is an essential or natural good, for instance, gold, wheat, etc. Lubin argued that the CFTC often asserted that the agency considers Ether as a commodity.\n\nCFTC chairman Rostin Benham also argues that some of the cryptocurrencies are securities. He also thinks that the top three digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether, and Tether, fall under the jurisdiction of the CFTC.\n\nDuring his tenure as an MIT professor, SEC chair Gary Gensler lectured on classifying cryptocurrencies into securities and commodities. However, the regulatory crackdown on the crypto industry by the agency over the past few years, with an aim of declaring every other cryptocurrency as a security is contradictory to his statements as a professor.\n\nBerenberg argued in a June 21, 2023 report that after attacking digital assets and crypto exchanges for unregistered securities, their next target could be stablecoins and decentralized finance (DeFi). Stablecoins act as the backbone of the entire DeFi system. Hence a blow at the right point could hamper the whole ecosystem.\n\nMembers of Congress, including Cynthia Lummis and Kristen Gillibrand, are trying to clear the air surrounding the classification of cryptocurrencies. They are drafting legislation helping the cause and echoing CFTC\u2019s belief that Ether and Bitcoin are commodities.\n\nThe Hinman documents were unsealed on June 13, 2023, and they revealed that the financial watchdog of the United States might need to be a better agency to police the crypto industry. During a 2018 speech, he argued that Ether should not be classified as securities.\n\nThe regulatory action by the SEC against the crypto industry increased by 183% after the infamous FTX collapse. In their defence, the regulators are trying to safeguard the citizens from investing in an unregistered financial instrument, but their modus operandi is not welcomed by the crypto community."

        "content": "Key Takeaways:\n\nEther price is facing a major hurdle near the $1,910 and $1,935 resistance levels.\n\nETH/USD is following a major declining channel with resistance near $1,885 on the 4-hour chart.\n\nThe price could restart increase above $1,900 or correct further lower toward $1,780.\n\nEthereum Price Forms Bullish Technical Pattern | Photo by shutter_speed on Unsplash\n\nNew Delhi(CoinChapter.com): Ethereum\u2019s ETH is correcting gains below $1,900. The price is following a bullish flag but ETH seems to be losing momentum below $1,880.\n\nEthereum Price (ETH) Starts Correction\n\nThis past week, we saw a strong increase in Ethereum above the $1,800 level against the US dollar. The ETH/USD pair was able to clear the $1,880 resistance level.\n\nIt even spiked above the $1,920 level but there was no upside continuation. A high is formed near $1,938 and the price is now correcting lower, similar to Bitcoin. There was a break below the $1,880 support level and the 50 Simple moving average (4 hours, blue).\n\nEthereum price 4-hours price chart | Source: ETH/USD on TradingView.com\n\nThere was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,628 swing low to the $1,938 high. The bulls are now active above the $1,800 level.\n\nIt seems like ETH is following a major declining channel with resistance near $1,885 on the 4-hour chart. It is rising and approaching the 50 Simple moving average (4 hours, blue). The first major resistance is near the channel zone at $1,885.\n\nThe next major resistance is near the $1,910 level. The main resistance sits near the $1,935 level. A close above the $1,935 resistance might start a fresh rally. In the stated case, Ethereum could rise toward the $2,000 resistance. The next key resistance is near the $2,150 zone. Any more gains could send ETH price toward the $2,250 level.\n\nMore Losses?\n\nConversely, Ethereum price might struggle to clear the bullish flag resistance at $1,885. Immediate support is seen near the $1,820 level.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,780 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,628 swing low to the $1,938 high. The main support sits at $1,745. If there is a move below $1,745, there is a risk of an extended decline.\n\nIn this scenario, the price may perhaps test the $1,700 support. Any more losses below $1,700 could send the price toward the $1,625 zone.\n\nOverall, Ether\u2019s price is correcting gains below the $1,900 level. If the price fails to clear the $1,900 resistance, it could drop toward $1,780. On the other hand, it could rise toward $2,000."
